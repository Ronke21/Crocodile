<text>Chicken McNuggets are a type of chicken nuggets sold by the international fast food restaurant chain McDonald&#x27;s. They consist of small pieces of reconstituted boneless chicken meat that have been battered and deep fried. Chicken McNuggets were conceived by Keystone Foods in the late 1970s and introduced in select markets in 1981. The nuggets were made available worldwide by 1983 after correcting a supply issue. The formula was changed in 2016 to remove artificial preservatives and improve the nutritional value.

== Description and origin ==
The Chicken McNugget is a small piece of processed chicken meat that is fried in batter and flash-frozen at a central manufacturing facility, then shipped out and sold at McDonald&#x27;s restaurants. It was conceived by Keystone Foods founder Herb Lotman in the late 1970s.

McDonald&#x27;s first executive chef, René Arend, a native of Luxembourg, created the Chicken McNuggets recipe in 1979. &quot;The McNuggets were so well-received that every franchise wanted them&quot;, said Arend in a 2009 interview. &quot;There wasn&#x27;t a system to supply enough chicken&quot;. Supply problems were solved by 1983, and Chicken McNuggets became available nationwide in the United States. In Canada, the national release was in late January 1984.

According to McDonald&#x27;s, the nuggets come in four shapes: the bell, the bow-tie, the ball and the boot. The reason for the four different shapes is to ensure consistent cooking times for food safety. Four shapes were chosen because McDonalds states &quot;The 4 shapes we make Chicken McNuggets in was the perfect equilibrium of dipability and fun. 3 would’ve been too few. 5 would’ve been, like, wacky.&quot;

== Ingredients ==
As of August 1, 2016, the ingredients within the United States are as follows: White boneless chicken, water, salt, seasoning (yeast extract, salt, wheat starch, natural flavoring, safflower oil, lemon juice solids, dextrose, citric acid), sodium phosphates. Battered and breaded with water, enriched flour (bleached wheat flour, niacin, reduced iron, thiamine mononitrate, riboflavin, folic acid), yellow corn flour, bleached wheat flour, salt, leavening (baking soda, sodium acid pyrophosphate, sodium aluminum phosphate, monocalcium phosphate, calcium lactate), spices, wheat starch, dextrose, corn starch. Prepared in vegetable oil (canola oil, corn oil, soybean oil, hydrogenated soybean oil) with citric acid as a preservative. McDonald&#x27;s ingredients can vary outside of the US. In August 2016 McDonald&#x27;s announced that Chicken McNuggets no longer contained artificial preservatives.

== Sale ==
Chicken McNuggets are sold in various portion sizes depending on the country of purchase. In the United States, they come in packs of 4, 6, 10, 20 and 50 (in selected stores). In some markets, including the United Kingdom, they are sold in packs of 4 (as part of a Happy Meal), 6, 9 or 20 (as a &quot;ShareBox&quot;). In New Zealand and Australia, they are also available in 3-packs in Happy Meals and Heart Foundation-approved &quot;Tick healthy&quot; meals. In Canada, Chicken McNuggets are sold in packs of 4 (as part of a Happy Meal), 6, 10, and 20. A 50-piece McNuggets meal deal has been promoted at times for special events such as the NFL&#x27;s Super Bowl.

They have recently been introduced by McDonald&#x27;s in India, first as a part of its &quot;Breakfast Meal&quot; and later in the regular menu in May 2009. A halal version of the McNuggets have been sold at two franchises in Dearborn, Michigan, beginning in the early 2000s, bringing in double the average McNuggets sales.

== Variants ==
In September 2020, McDonald&#x27;s introduced Spicy Chicken McNuggets in the United States for a limited time along with Mighty Hot Sauce. Spicy Chicken McNuggets returned, for a limited time, in February 2021 and September 2023.

== Criticism ==
In a 2002 lawsuit against McDonald&#x27;s, a judge commented that Chicken McNuggets are a &quot;McFrankenstein&quot; creation. The judge identified that rather than being merely chicken fried in a pan, McNuggets included elements not utilized by the home cook, including unusual sounding ingredients such as extracts of rosemary, vitamins (niacin, thiamine mononitrate, riboflavin, and folic acid) all of which are common in enriched flour, and leavening (baking soda, calcium lactate, etc.).

The 2004 documentary &quot;Super Size Me&quot; states that &quot;[o]riginally created from old chickens that can no longer lay eggs, McNuggets are now made from chickens with unusually large breasts. They&#x27;re stripped from the bone, and ground-up into a sort of &#x27;chicken mash&#x27;, which is then combined with all sorts of stabilizers and preservatives, pressed into familiar shapes, breaded, deep-fried, freeze-dried, and then shipped to a McDonald&#x27;s near you.&quot; &quot;Super Size Me&quot; also alleged inclusion of ingredients such as TBHQ, polydimethylsiloxane, and others not used by a typical home cook. This was subsequently restated by CNN. Marion Nestle, a New York University professor and author of &quot;What to Eat,&quot; says that the ingredients in McNuggets probably pose no health risks.

Before August 2016, dimethylpolysiloxane and TBHQ were listed as ingredients in the McNuggets cooking process. According to Lisa McComb, a media relations representative for McDonald&#x27;s, dimethylpolysiloxane is used as a matter of safety to keep the frying oil from foaming. A review of animal studies by the World Health Organization found no adverse health effects associated with dimethylpolysiloxane. TBHQ is a common preservative for vegetable oils, cereals, nuts, cookies, chips and animal fats, found in other foods such as Girl Scout Cookies and Quaker Chewy Granola Bars. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration sets an upper limit of 0.02% of the oil or fat content in foods, which like other foods, applies to the oil used in McNuggets. Effective use of TBHQ was 1 gram per 5,000 grams of cooking oil (1 gram per 11.023 pounds of cooking oil).

== In culture ==

=== McNugget numbers ===

A mathematical problem, discussed on Eric W. Weisstein&#x27;s MathWorld and Brady Haran&#x27;s YouTube channel &quot;Numberphile,&quot; is that of determining the greatest number of McNuggets which cannot be made from any combination of pack sizes on offer. For example, in the UK, McNuggets are sold in boxes of 6, 9 or 20 (excluding Happy Meals). Consequently, the greatest number of McNuggets which cannot be purchased exactly is 43, the Frobenius number of the set {6,9,20}. This means that all natural numbers greater than 43 can be expressed, in some way, as the sum of some multiple of each of 6, 9, and 20. For example, 139 = (5 × 20) + (5 × 6) + (1 × 9).

<text>Charles Howard Gates (known as Swiftwater Bill; April 7, 1854 – February 13, 1933) was an American frontiersman and fortune hunter, and a fixture in stories of the Klondike Gold Rush.

In one famous Klondike story he presented Dawson dance hall girl Gussie Lamore her weight in gold. Gates was married briefly to Grace Lamore in 1898; he later married Bera Beebe, with whom he fathered two sons, Fredrick and Clifford. Gates subsequently abandoned her for 15-year-old Kitty Brandon, his niece. His biography &quot;The True Life Story of Swiftwater Bill Gates&quot; (c. 1908) was authored by Iola Beebe, his mother-in-law. 

Gates was known to be at the gold fields of Nome, Alaska at the same time as William H Gates I, grandfather of the Microsoft founder. However, despite the similarity in name and coincidences of gold, there is no apparent family relationship between &quot;Swiftwater Bill&quot; and Microsoft founder Bill Gates.

In fiction, he has been portrayed by Gordon Pinsent in the 1985 film &quot;Klondike Fever&quot; and Colin Cunningham in the 2014 miniseries &quot;Klondike&quot;.

<doc id="1007467" wikidata="Q14541638" url="?curid=1007467" title="Valgus deformity">
<text>A valgus deformity is a condition in which the bone segment distal to a joint is angled outward, that is, angled laterally, away from the body&#x27;s midline. The opposite deformation, where the twist or angulation is directed medially, toward the center of the body, is called varus. 

==Knee arthritis with valgus knee==

Rheumatoid knee commonly presents as valgus knee. Osteoarthritis knee may also sometimes present with valgus deformity though varus deformity is common. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to correct valgus deformity is surgically difficult and requires specialized implants called constrained condylar knees.

==Examples==

* Ankle: &quot;talipes valgus&quot; (from Latin &quot;talus&quot; = ankle and &quot;pes&quot; = foot) – outward turning of the heel, resulting in a &#x27;flat foot&#x27; presentation.
* Elbows: &quot;cubitus valgus&quot; (from Latin &quot;cubitus&quot; = elbow) – forearm is angled away from the body.
* Foot: &quot;pes valgus&quot; (from Latin &quot;pes&quot; = foot) – a medial deviation of the foot at subtalar joint.
* Hand: &quot;manus valgus&quot; (from Latin &quot;manus&quot; = hand)
* Hip: &quot;coxa valga&quot; (from Latin &quot;coxa&quot; = hip) – the shaft of the femur is bent outward in respect to the neck of the femur. Coxa valga &gt;125 degrees. Coxa vara &lt;125 degrees.
* Knee: &quot;genu valgum&quot; (from Latin &quot;genu&quot; = knee) – the tibia is turned outward in relation to the femur, resulting in a &quot;knock-kneed&quot; appearance. Common causes of knock-knee in adults include arthritis of the knee and traumatic injuries.
* Toe: &quot;hallux valgus&quot; (from Latin &quot;hallux&quot; = big toe) – outward deviation of the big toe toward the second toe, resulting in bunion.
* Wrist: &quot;Madelung&#x27;s deformity&quot; – deformity wherein the wrist bones are not formed properly due to a genetic disorder.

==Terminology==

Valgus is a term for outward angulation of the distal segment of a bone or joint. The opposite condition is called varus, which is a medial deviation of the distal bone. The terms &quot;varus&quot; and &quot;valgus&quot; always refer to the direction in which the distal segment of the joint points. The original Latin definitions for &quot;varus&quot; and &quot;valgus&quot; were the opposite of their current usage. For a discussion of the etymology of these words, see the entry under varus. A mnemonic to remember the two deformities is that valgus contains an &quot;L&quot;, for Lateral deviation.

<text>Marco Antonio Etcheverry Vargas (born 26 September 1970) is a Bolivian former professional footballer who played as a forward or midfielder. A creative playmaker, he is considered one of the greatest Bolivian players of all time. Etcheverry played for D.C. United of Major League Soccer from 1996 to 2003. He helped D.C United win eight trophies during that time, and was nominated to the MLS Best XI in four consecutive seasons from 1996 to 1999.

==Club career==
Etcheverry, is nicknamed &quot;El Diablo&quot; (The Devil).

Etcheverry was trained at Bolivia&#x27;s Tahuichi Academy, after which he played professionally with Bolivian sides (Destroyers, Bolívar, Oriente Petrolero), Spain (Albacete), Chile (Colo-Colo), Colombia (América de Cali) and Ecuador (Barcelona, Emelec).

Etchverry joined D.C. United of Major League Soccer in its 28th season of 1996, and led the team to three MLS Cups and was named MLS MVP in 1998. In eight years with the team, Etcheverry played 191 league games, scoring 34 goals and registering 101 assists (the games and assists were DC records). He retired at the end of the 2003 season.

===DC United honors===
In 2005, he was named to the MLS All-Time Best XI.

On 23 September 2006, Etcheverry was honored at a home game against the New York Red Bulls. During halftime he was put up on the &quot;D.C. United Tradition of Excellence&quot; sign in the stadium. After all of this Etcheverry walked over to the La Barra Brava part of the stadium and did his trademark clap in front of them, he did after every game, win or lose.

On 20 October 2007, Etcheverry was honored with a tribute match at RFK Stadium, prior to United&#x27;s regular-season finale versus Columbus. Etcheverry is the first United player to be so honored. Etcheverry, playing with teammates from the club&#x27;s 1997 MLS Cup winning side, defeated Hollywood United (a collection of former players and actors), 2–1, with Etcheverry drawing and scoring the winning penalty in the final minute.

==International career==
Etcheverry compiled 71 caps and scored 13 goals for the Bolivia national team between 1989 and 2003. He scored four times during qualification for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, including an 88th minute opening goal in a 2–0 defeat of Brazil in La Paz - the first ever loss by the &quot;Seleção&quot; in World Cup qualifying, to help Bolivia participate in its first FIFA World Cup since 1950. At the tournament finals, Etcheverry was sent off for kicking Lothar Matthäus four minutes after appearing as a substitute in the tournament&#x27;s opening game against Germany. The subsequent suspension meant that Etcheverry played no further part in Bolivia&#x27;s tournament, as &quot;La Verde&quot; finished bottom of Group C with two losses and a draw to South Korea.

Etcheverry scored twice in the 1997 Copa América as Bolivia reached the final to achieve its best performance in the competition since winning in 1963. He went on to represent the team in the subsequent FIFA Confederations Cup in 1999.

On 12 April 2006, the Bolivian Congress awarded him with the &quot;Order of Merit&quot; and a title of &quot;Distinguished Citizen&quot;, for his sport achievements, shortly after his retirement.

==Coaching career==
Etcheverry made his debut as football coach in early 2008 after he accepted an offer from second division club Sociedad Deportiva Aucas, but he was sacked after only four months in charge. On 6 October 2009, Etcheverry was announced as the new Oriente Petrolero coach, replacing Pablo Sánchez. But in the middle of the negotiations he decided not to go through.

He returned to the United States in 2023 to coach the under-15 boys&#x27; team for the D.C. United Academy.

<doc id="1007469" wikidata="Q870594" url="?curid=1007469" title="Numazu Station">
<text>is an interchange railway station on the Tōkaidō Main Line in the city of Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan, operated by Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central). The station is also a freight terminal and rail yard for the Japan Freight Railway Company (JR Freight).

==Lines==
Numazu Station is served by the Tōkaidō Main Line and the Gotemba Line. It lies 62.2 kilometers from and 126.2 km from Tokyo Station.

==Station layout==

Numazu Station has three ground-level island platforms serving six tracks, connected to each other and to the station building by both a footbridge and an underpass. The station building has automated ticket machines, TOICA automated turnstiles and a &quot;JR Ticket office&quot; staffed ticket office.

=== Platforms ===

== History==

Numazu Station opened on February 1, 1889 when the section of the Tōkaidō Main Line connecting Shizuoka with Kōzu was completed. A spur line to nearby Numazu Port was established in 1899. The first station building burned down in a fire of 1913 and the second in a fire of 1926. On December 1, 1934, Numazu was connected directly with Atami Station via the Tanna Tunnel, thus eliminating the previous long detour north to Gotemba Station in the section between Tokyo and Shizuoka. Numazu Station was rebuilt in 1937, but was burned down again, this time in the Bombing of Numazu in World War II. The next station building was erected in 1953, and rebuilt in 1973.

Station numbering was introduced to this station in 2018; Numazu Station was assigned station numbers CA04 for the Tōkaidō Line and CB18 for the Gotemba Line.

Standing at least Semjonova was the leading women&#x27;s basketball player in the world in the 1970s and 1980s. Wearing a men&#x27;s size 21 (US) / 58 (EU) shoe, she was known for having the largest feet ever in women&#x27;s basketball. For almost all of her playing career, she played for TTT Riga, which was part of Daugava Voluntary Sports Society. With TTT, she won 15 championships in the Soviet Union and the European Champion&#x27;s Cup 15 times. Semjonova was also very dominant in international play, winning two Olympic Gold medals while playing for the USSR in 1976 and 1980 and never lost a game in official international competition.

She was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour in 1976, and in 1993 became the first non-US woman enshrined into the Basketball Hall of Fame. She was an inaugural member of the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame in the class of 1999. In 2007, she was enshrined in the FIBA Hall of Fame. During the 2007 Latvian sports personality of the year award ceremony, Semjonova received the Lifetime Contribution to Sport award.

<text>Heat recovery ventilation (HRV), also known as mechanical ventilation heat recovery (MVHR) is a ventilation system that recovers energy by operating between two air sources at different temperatures. It is used to reduce the heating and cooling demands of buildings.

By recovering the residual heat in the exhaust gas, the fresh air introduced into the air conditioning system is preheated (or pre-cooled) before it enters the room, or the air cooler of the air conditioning unit performs heat and moisture treatment. A typical heat recovery system in buildings comprises a core unit, channels for fresh and exhaust air, and blower fans. Building exhaust air is used as either a heat source or heat sink, depending on the climate conditions, time of year, and requirements of the building. Heat recovery systems typically recover about 60–95% of the heat in the exhaust air and have significantly improved the energy efficiency of buildings.

Energy recovery ventilation (ERV) is the energy recovery process in residential and commercial HVAC systems that exchanges the energy contained in normally exhausted air of a building or conditioned space, using it to treat (precondition) the incoming outdoor ventilation air. The specific equipment involved may be called an Energy Recovery Ventilator, also commonly referred to simply as an &quot;ERV&quot;.

An ERV is a type of air-to-air heat exchanger that transfers latent heat as well as sensible heat. Because both temperature and moisture are transferred, ERVs are described as total enthalpic devices. In contrast, a heat recovery ventilator (HRV) can only transfer sensible heat. HRVs can be considered &quot;sensible only&quot; devices because they only exchange sensible heat. In other words, all ERVs are HRVs, but not all HRVs are ERVs. It is incorrect to use the terms HRV, AAHX (air-to-air heat exchanger), and ERV interchangeably.

During the warmer seasons, an ERV system pre-cools and dehumidifies; during cooler seasons the system humidifies and pre-heats. An ERV system helps HVAC design meet ventilation and energy standards (e.g., ASHRAE), improves indoor air quality and reduces total HVAC equipment capacity, thereby reducing energy consumption. ERV systems enable an HVAC system to maintain a 40-50% indoor relative humidity, essentially in all conditions. ERV&#x27;s must use power for a blower to overcome the pressure drop in the system, hence incurring a slight energy demand.

== Working principle ==
A heat recovery system is designed to supply conditioned air to the occupied space to maintain a certain temperature. A heat recovery system helps keep a house ventilated while recovering heat being emitted from the inside environment. The purpose of heat recovery systems is to transfer the thermal energy from one fluid to another fluid, from one fluid to a solid, or from a solid surface to a fluid at different temperatures and in thermal contact. There is no direct interaction between fluid and fluid or fluid and solid in most heat recovery systems. In some heat recovery systems, fluid leakage is observed due to pressure differences between fluids, resulting in a mixture of the two fluids.The purpose of an energy recovery system is to reduce the energy required for heating, cooling, or ventilating the space by repurposing the exhaust air&#x27;s energy.

==Types==
=== Thermal wheel ===
=== Fixed plate heat exchanger ===


Fixed plate heat exchangers have no moving parts, and consist of alternating layers of plates that are separated and sealed. Typical flow is cross current and since the majority of plates are solid and non permeable, sensible only transfer is the result.

The tempering of incoming fresh air is done by a heat or energy recovery core. In this case, the core is made of aluminum or plastic plates. Humidity levels are adjusted through the transferring of water vapor. This is done with a rotating wheel either containing a desiccant material or permeable plates.

Enthalpy plates were introduced in 2006 by Paul, a special company for ventilation systems for passive houses. A crosscurrent countercurrent air-to-air heat exchanger built with a humidity permeable material. Polymer fixed-plate countercurrent energy recovery ventilators were introduced in 1998 by Building Performance Equipment (BPE), a residential, commercial, and industrial air-to-air energy recovery manufacturer. These heat exchangers can be both introduced as a retrofit for increased energy savings and fresh air as well as an alternative to new construction. In new construction situations, energy recovery will effectively reduce the required heating/cooling capacity of the system. The percentage of the total energy saved will depend on the efficiency of the device (up to 90% sensible) and the latitude of the building.

Due to the need to use multiple sections, fixed plate energy exchangers are often associated with high pressure drop and larger footprints. Due to their inability to offer a high amount of latent energy transfer these systems also have a high chance of frosting in colder climates.

The technology patented by Finnish company RecyclingEnergy Int. Corp. is based on a regenerative plate heat exchanger taking advantage of humidity of air by cyclical condensation and evaporation, e.g. latent heat, enabling not only high annual thermal efficiency but also microbe-free plates due to self-cleaning/washing method. Therefore, the unit is called an enthalpy recovery ventilator rather than heat or energy recovery ventilator. Company&#x27;s patented LatentHeatPump is based on its enthalpy recovery ventilator having COP of 33 in the summer and 15 in the winter.

Fixed plate heat exchangers are the most commonly used type of heat exchanger and have been developed for 40 years. Thin metal plates are stacked with a small spacing between plates. Two different air streams pass through these spaces, adjacent to each other. Heat transfer occurs as the temperature transfers through the plate from one air stream to the other. The efficiency of these devices has reached 90% sensible heat efficiency in transferring sensible heat from one air stream to another. The high levels of efficiency are attributed to the high heat transfer coefficients of the materials used, operational pressure and temperature range.

=== Heat pipes ===
Heat pipes are a heat recovery device that uses a multi-phase process to transfer heat from one air stream to another. Heat is transferred using an evaporator and condenser within a wicked, sealed pipe containing a fluid which undergoes a constant phase change to transfer heat. The fluid within the pipes changes from a fluid to a gas in the evaporator section, absorbing the thermal energy from the warm air stream. The gas condenses back to a fluid in the condenser section where the thermal energy is dissipated into the cooler air stream raising the temperature. The fluid/gas is transported from one side of the heat pipe to the other through pressure, wick forces or gravity, depending on the arrangement of the heat pipe.

=== Run-around ===
Run-around systems are hybrid heat recovery system that incorporates characteristics from other heat recovery technology to form a single device, capable of recovering heat from one air stream and delivering to another a significant distance away. The general case of run-around heat recovery, two fixed plate heat exchangers are located in two separate air streams and are linked by a closed loop containing a fluid that is continually pumped between the two heat exchangers. The fluid is heated and cooled constantly as it flows around the loop, providing heat recovery. The constant flow of the fluid through the loop requires pumps to move between the two heat exchangers. Though this is an additional energy demand, using pumps to circulate fluid is less energy intensive than fans to circulate air.

=== Phase change materials ===
Phase change materials, or PCMs, are a technology that is used to store sensible and latent heat within a building structure at a higher storage capacity than standard building materials. PCMs have been studied extensively due to their ability to store heat and transfer heating and cooling demands from conventional peak times to off-peak times.

The concept of the thermal mass of a building for heat storage, that the physical structure of the building absorbs heat to help cool the air, has long been understood and investigated. A study of PCMs in comparison to traditional building materials has shown that the thermal storage capacity of PCMs is twelve times higher than standard building materials over the same temperature range. The pressure drop across PCMs has not been investigated to be able to comment on the effect that the material may have on air streams. However, as the PCM can be incorporated directly into the building structure, this would not affect the flow in the same way other heat exchanger technologies do, it can be suggested that there is no pressure loss created by the inclusion of PCMs in the building fabric.

== Applications ==
=== Fixed plate heat exchangers ===
Mardiana et al. integrated a fixed plate heat exchanger into a commercial wind tower, highlighting the advantages of this type of system as a means of zero energy ventilation which can be simply modified. Full scale laboratory testing was undertaken in order to determine the effects and efficiency of the combined system. A wind tower was integrated with a fixed plate heat exchanger and was mounted centrally in a sealed test room.

The results from this study indicate that the combination of a wind tower passive ventilation system and a fixed plate heat recovery device could provide an effective combined technology to recover waste heat from exhaust air and cool incoming warm air with zero energy demand. Though no quantitative data for the ventilation rates within the test room was provided, it can be assumed that due to the high-pressure loss across the heat exchanger that these were significantly reduced from the standard operation of a wind tower. Further investigation of this combined technology is essential in understanding the air flow characteristics of the system.

=== Heat pipes ===
Due to the low-pressure loss of heat pipe systems, more research has been conducted into the integration of this technology into passive ventilation than other heat recovery systems. Commercial wind towers were again used as the passive ventilation system for integrating this heat recovery technology. This further enhances the suggestion that commercial wind towers provide a worthwhile alternative to mechanical ventilation, capable of supplying and exhausting air at the same time.

=== Run-around systems ===
Flaga-Maryanczyk et al. conducted a study in Sweden which examined a passive ventilation system which integrated a run-around system using a ground source heat pump as the heat source to warm incoming air. Experimental measurements and weather data were taken from the passive house used in the study. A CFD model of the passive house was created with the measurements taken from the sensors and weather station used as input data. The model was run to calculate the effectiveness of the run-around system and the capabilities of the ground source heat pump.

Ground source heat pumps provide a reliable source of consistent thermal energy when buried 10–20 m below the ground surface. The ground temperature is warmer than the ambient air in winter and cooler than the ambient air in summer, providing both a heat source and a heat sink. It was found that in February, the coldest month in the climate, the ground source heat pump was capable of delivering almost 25% of the heating needs of the house and occupants.

=== Phase change materials ===
The majority of research interest in PCMs is the application of phase change material integration into traditional porous building materials such as concrete and wall boards. Kosny et al. analyzed the thermal performance of buildings that have PCM-enhanced construction materials within the structure. Analysis showed that the addition of PCMs is beneficial in terms of improving thermal performance.

A significant drawback of PCM used in a passive ventilation system for heat recovery is the lack of instantaneous heat transfer across different airstreams. Phase change materials are a heat storage technology, whereby the heat is stored within the PCM until the air temperature has fallen to a significant level where it can be released back into the air stream. No research has been conducted into the use of PCMs between two airstreams of different temperatures where continuous, instantaneous heat transfer can occur. An investigation into this area would be beneficial for passive ventilation heat recovery research.

== Environmental impacts ==

Energy saving is one of the key issues for both fossil fuel consumption and the protection of the global environment. The rising cost of energy and global warming underlined that developing improved energy systems is necessary to increase energy efficiency while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. One of the most effective ways to reduce energy demand is to use energy more efficiently. Therefore, waste heat recovery is becoming popular in recent years since it improves energy efficiency. About 26% of industrial energy is still wasted as hot gas or fluid in many countries. However, during last two decades there has been remarkable attention to recover waste heat from various industries and to optimize the units which are used to absorb heat from waste gases. Thus, these attempts enhance reducing of global warming as well as of energy demand.

=== Energy consumption ===
==Energy recovery ventilation==

=== Importance ===
Nearly half of global energy is used in buildings,and half of heating/cooling cost is caused by ventilation when it is done by the &quot;open window&quot; method according to the regulations. Secondly, energy generation and grid is made to meet the peak demand of power. To use proper ventilation; recovery is a cost-efficient, sustainable and quick way to reduce global energy consumption and give better indoor air quality (IAQ) and protect buildings, and environment.

=== Methods of transfer ===
During the cooling season, the system works to cool and dehumidify the incoming, outside air. To do this, the system takes the rejected heat and sends it into the exhaust airstream. Subsequently, this air cools the condenser coil at a lower temperature than if the rejected heat had not entered the exhaust airstream. During the heating seasons, the system works in reverse. Instead of discharging the heat into the exhaust airstream, the system draws heat from the exhaust airstream in order to pre-heat the incoming air. At this stage, the air passes through a primary unit and then into the space being conditioned. With this type of system, it is normal during the cooling seasons for the exhaust air to be cooler than the ventilation air and, during the heating seasons, warmer than the ventilation air. It is for this reason the system works efficiently and effectively. The coefficient of performance (COP) will increase as the conditions become more extreme (i.e., more hot and humid for cooling and colder for heating).

=== Efficiency ===
The efficiency of an ERV system is the ratio of energy transferred between the two air streams compared with the total energy transported through the heat exchanger.

With the variety of products on the market, efficiency will vary as well. Some of these systems have been known to have heat exchange efficiencies as high as 70-80% while others have as low as 50%. Even though this lower figure is preferable to the basic HVAC system, it is not up to par with the rest of its class. Studies are being done to increase the heat transfer efficiency to 90%.

The use of modern low-cost gas-phase heat exchanger technology will allow for significant improvements in efficiency. The use of high conductivity porous material is believed to produce an exchange effectiveness in excess of 90%, producing a five times improvement in energy recovery.

The Home Ventilating Institute (HVI) has developed a standard test for any and all units manufactured within the United States. Regardless, not all have been tested. It is imperative to investigate efficiency claims, comparing data produced by HVI as well as that produced by the manufacturer. (Note: all units sold in Canada are placed through the R-2000 program, a standard test equivalent to the HVI test).

== Exhaust air heat pump ==
An exhaust air heat pump (EAHP) extracts heat from the exhaust air of a building and transfers the heat to the supply air, hot tap water and/or hydronic heating system (underfloor heating, radiators). This requires at least mechanical exhaust but mechanical supply is optional; see mechanical ventilation. This type of heat pump requires a certain air exchange rate to maintain its output power. Since the inside air is approximately 20–22 degrees Celsius all year round, the maximum output power of the heat pump is not varying with the seasons and outdoor temperature.

Air leaving the building when the heat pump&#x27;s compressor is running is usually at around −1° in most versions. Thus, the unit is extracting heat from the air that needs to be changed (at a rate of around a half an air change per hour). Air entering the house is of course generally warmer than the air processed through the unit so there is a net &#x27;gain&#x27;. Care must be taken that these are only used in the correct type of houses. Exhaust air heat pumps have minimum flow rates so that when installed in a small flat, the airflow chronically over-ventilates the flat and increases the heat loss by drawing in large amounts of unwanted outside air. There are some models though that can take in additional outdoor air to negate this and this air is also feed to the compressor to avoid over ventilation.For most earlier exhaust air heat pumps there will be a low heat output to the hot water and heating of just around 1.8 kW from the compressor/heat pump process, but if that falls short of the building&#x27;s requirements additional heat will be automatically triggered in the form of immersion heaters or an external gas boiler. The immersion heater top-up could be substantial ( if you select the wrong unit), and when a unit with a 6 kW immersion heater operates at the full output it will cost £1 per hour to run.

==Issues==
Between 2009 and 2013, some 15,000 brand new social homes were built in the UK with NIBE EAHPs used as primary heating. Owners and housing association tenants reported crippling electric bills. High running costs are usual with exhaust air heat pumps and should be expected, due to the very small heat recovery with these units. Typically the ventilation air stream is around 31 litres per second and the heat recovery is 750W and no more.
All additional heat necessary to provide heating and hot water is from electricity, either compressor electrical input or immersion heater.
At outside temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius, this type of heat pump removes more heat from a home than it supplies. Over a year around 60% of the energy input to a property with an exhaust air heat pump will be from electricity.

Many families are still battling with developers to have their EAHP systems replaced with more reliable and efficient heating, noting the success of residents in Coventry.

He had an exemplary first year, anchoring the Crew defense along with Robin Fraser, who won the MLS Defender of the Year award that season, and helped the team to an eighteen-game unbeaten streak and the MLS Supporters&#x27; Shield. He finished the season with twenty-seven starts, and was a close second to Clint Dempsey in the voting for the MLS Rookie of the Year Award. He only played in twelve matches in 2007 due to ongoing concussion issues that threatened to end his career.

Marshall&#x27;s strongest campaign with the Crew came in 2008. He led the defense on the squad that won both the Supporters&#x27; Shield and the MLS Cup 2008, a game in which Marshall scored the game-winning goal. After the season, he was voted to the MLS Best XI and was also awarded the MLS Defender of the Year award, beating competition from Bakary Soumaré and Jimmy Conrad.

Marshall&#x27;s contract ran out after the 2008 campaign. After a brief trial for part of December with German 2. Bundesliga side Mainz 05 he re-signed with Columbus on December 26, 2008.

In 2009, Marshall was awarded MLS Player of the Month award while playing every minute of the Crew’s four games that month, scoring two game-winning goals, and helping Columbus to three shutout victories.

On March 17, 2011, Marshall was named captain of Columbus Crew for the 2011 season to fill the void left by departing captain Frankie Hejduk. In December 2011, Columbus signed Marshall to a long-term contract extension through the 2015 MLS season.

During the 2012 season, Marshall missed eight games due to a concussion.

On December 12, 2013, Marshall was traded to Seattle Sounders FC in exchange for allocation money and a third-round 2015 MLS SuperDraft pick. He scored his first goal as a Sounder, a game-winning header in the 84th minute, against the Philadelphia Union on May 3. He was named MLS Defender of the Year for the third time as the Sounders won the Supporters&#x27; Shield.

On May 22, 2019, Marshall announced his retirement from professional soccer due to injury, concluding a historic 16-year Major League Soccer career at age 34.

== International career ==
As a teenager, Marshall trained at the United States Soccer Federation&#x27;s exclusive Bradenton Academy and has played for several United States youth national teams. He played for the United States at the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship, now commonly known as the FIFA U-20 World Cup, in the United Arab Emirates. He later moved up and earned time with the Under-23 team.

Marshall earned his first cap and scored his first goal for the senior national team on March 9, 2005, against Colombia. Marshall was selected for the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup for the United States and received his first cap since 2005 in the side&#x27;s opening match against Grenada. Marshall went on to play in five games throughout the tournament and garnered Gold Cup All-Tournament honors.

On May 11, 2010, Bob Bradley, the U.S. Men&#x27;s National Team head coach selected Marshall for the 30-man preliminary roster for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.
On May 26, 2010, Bradley decided to keep Marshall off the 23 man roster for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

On January 6, 2017, after almost seven years of absence from international soccer, Marshall was called for the United States national team by coach Bruce Arena.

== Style of play ==

<text>George Washington Plunkitt (November 17, 1842 – November 19, 1924) was an American politician from New York State, who served in both houses of the New York State Legislature. He was a leader of the Tammany Hall political organization, a vehement critic of the Civil Service, and notably responsible for a series of colloquial and practical short talks recorded in &quot;Plunkitt of Tammany Hall,&quot; which comprise his observations and successful mastery of machine politics.

==Biography==
He was born on November 17, 1842, in Manhattan, New York City.

He served in the New York State Assembly (New York Co., 17th D.) between 1869 and 1873.

He was a member of the New York State Senate from 1884 to 1887 (11th D.), in 1892 and 1893 (11th D.), and from 1899 to 1904 (17th D.). He sat in the 107th, 108th, 109th, 110th, 115th, 116th, 122nd, 123rd, 124th, 125th, 126th, and 127th New York State Legislatures.

Plunkitt became wealthy by practicing what he called &quot;honest graft&quot; in politics. He was a cynically honest practitioner of what today is generally known as &quot;machine politics,&quot; patronage-based and frank in its exercise of power for personal gain.

In one of his speeches, quoted in &quot;Plunkitt of Tammany Hall&quot;, he describes the difference between dishonest and honest graft. For dishonest graft, one works solely for one&#x27;s own interests. For honest graft, one pursues, at the same time, the interests of one&#x27;s party, state, and person.

He made most of his money through the purchase of land that he knew would be needed for public projects. He would buy such parcels and then resell them at an inflated price. This was honest graft. Dishonest graft, according to Plunkitt, would be buying land and then using influence to have a project built on it.

Plunkitt defended his own actions, saying: &quot;I could get nothin&#x27; at a bargain but a big piece of swamp, but I took it fast enough and held on to it. What turned out was just what I counted on. They couldn&#x27;t make the park complete without Plunkitt&#x27;s swamp, and they had to pay a good price for it. Anything dishonest in that?&quot;

Plunkitt was also a thoroughgoing party man, believing in appointments, patronage, spoils, and all of the practices curtailed by the civil service law. He saw such practices as both the rewards and cause of patriotism. He hated the civil service system and fought against it politically.

Plunkitt is also remembered for the line he used to defend his actions: &quot;I seen my opportunities and I took &#x27;em.&quot;

On October 7, 1905, he underwent an operation for retro-peritoneal abscess, and almost died.

He died on November 19, 1924, in Manhattan, New York City. He was buried at the Calvary Cemetery in Queens.

<doc id="1007499" wikidata="Q201860" url="?curid=1007499" title="Clint Dempsey">
<text>Clinton Drew Dempsey (; born March 9, 1983) is an American former professional soccer player who is a sports analyst on the television program &quot;Soccer on CBS Sports&quot;. He played as a forward and midfielder for Premier League clubs Fulham and Tottenham Hotspur and in Major League Soccer for clubs New England Revolution and Seattle Sounders FC. Often debated as the greatest American player of all time, he is one of the most successful American players in Europe, and is tied with Landon Donovan for the record of most international goals scored by an American player (57).

A native of Nacogdoches, Texas, Dempsey spent his youth career with the Dallas Texans before joining Furman University&#x27;s men&#x27;s soccer team in 2001. In 2004, he was drafted by the New England Revolution, where he scored 25 goals in 71 appearances. In 2007, Dempsey signed for Premier League club Fulham for £2 million. With Fulham, he was an integral part of the team that were runners-up to Spanish club Atlético Madrid for the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League. He was awarded Fulham Player of the Season for 2010–11 and 2011–12, where he was the club&#x27;s top scorer for both. In 2012, Dempsey became the first American player to score a hat-trick in the Premier League. 

In 2012, Tottenham signed Dempsey for a fee of $9.6 million, then a record signing for an American. He scored 12 goals in his only season with Tottenham, giving him 72 goals across all competitions for Premier League clubs—the most by an American in a top-tier European league. He was signed by the Seattle Sounders the following year, and played 115 matches for the club, scoring 47 goals, and leading the club to win the 2014 Supporters&#x27; Shield. During the 2016 season, Dempsey was diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat and missed the team&#x27;s run to the MLS Cup. He returned the following season, before announcing his retirement from professional soccer in 2018.

Dempsey represented the United States at the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship and made his first appearance with the senior team on November 17, 2004. He earned more than 140 caps and scored 57 international goals, making him the nation&#x27;s fourth-most capped player and tying him with Landon Donovan as the top all-time scorer with 57 goals. Dempsey represented the United States at four CONCACAF Gold Cups (winning three), helped them to the final of the 2009 Confederations Cup, and scored in each of the three World Cups he attended. In 2022, Dempsey was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame.

==Early life and career==
Dempsey was born in Nacogdoches, Texas, and is of Irish ancestry on his father&#x27;s side. For much of his childhood, Dempsey&#x27;s family lived in a trailer park where he and his siblings grew up playing soccer with the complex&#x27;s large population of Hispanic immigrants.

In his teens, Dempsey maintained these ties playing in a local Mexican-dominated adult league. His older brother, Ryan, was offered a tryout for the Dallas Texans, an elite youth soccer club, and brought Dempsey, who was noticed and recruited while passing time juggling a ball on the sidelines.

Dempsey became a standout on the team at an early age but had to quit due to financial constraints as his eldest sister Jennifer was becoming a ranked youth tennis player. Several parents of his teammates with the Texans offered to assist the Dempseys with expenses and travel, allowing him to rejoin the club.

On November 27, 1995, Dempsey&#x27;s 16-year-old sister Jennifer died from a brain aneurysm. Dempsey was devastated with the family&#x27;s loss and later explained that this event helped him develop a deeper motivation to pursue soccer in honor of his sister.

He went on to be the captain and high scorer of the Texans and was honored with the MVP of the Tampa Bay Sun Bowl tournament. Dempsey studied the play of Argentina&#x27;s national team, especially Diego Maradona, and was heartbroken when the news came to Nacogdoches that Maradona would not be playing in the 1994 World Cup game played in the Cotton Bowl. He attended Furman University as a health and exercise science major and a key player for Paladins soccer. Dempsey was an &quot;outstanding&quot; midfielder while at Furman, named second team NSCAA All-American in 2002, and receiving All-Southern Conference first team honors in 2001 and 2002. He earned NSCAA All-South Region honors in 2002 and 2003 and was a member of the 2001 Soccer America and College Soccer News All-Freshman teams.

==Club career==

===New England Revolution===
The New England Revolution selected Clint Dempsey with their first pick (eighth overall) in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft. He made his Revolution debut in the 2004 season home opener, a 3-1 loss against the San Jose Earthquakes on April 17, 2004. The match was notable as the final home appearance for Revolution striker Joe-Max Moore. Dempsey scored his first MLS goal the following week, giving the Revolution a 12th minute lead against the MetroStars on April 25.

In his rookie season, Dempsey started 23 of 24 matches, playing at least three with a broken jaw, and scoring seven goals, tied for third on the team with Steve Ralston. Dempsey helped the Revolution to the 2004 Eastern Conference Finals and earned 2004 MLS Rookie of the Year Honors, beating out finalists Freddy Adu and Chad Marshall. He was also named the 2004 Man of the Year by the Midnight Riders, and was named an MLS All-Star. 

In 2005, Dempsey contributed ten goals and nine assists in 26 games, second in team scoring behind Taylor Twellman. He was named MLS Player of the Week for matchweek 4, and won MLS Goal of the Week in matchweek 5, a strike which was subsequently a finalist for 2005 MLS Goal of the Year. He scored the game-winning goal in the 4th minute of the Eastern Conference Final on his way to an appearance in the MLS Cup Final. He was again named an MLS All-Star, and also named a member of the MLS Best XI.

In March of 2006, Dempsey received a two-week suspension for fighting with teammate Joe Franchino in practice. During the regular season, Dempsey added eight more goals, but missed significant time in the playoffs due to injury, and time during the regular season due to the World Cup. Dempsey won MLS Player of the Week honors for week 14, and MLS Goal of the Week in matchweek 28 for his strike against D.C. United. He came on as a substitute in the MLS Cup Final, but the Revolution lost their second straight final, this time in a penalty shoot-out. He was named an MLS All-Star for a third time, and to the MLS Best-XI for a second time.

===Fulham===
====2006–07 season====
In December 2006, English club Fulham offered MLS $4 million for the transfer of Dempsey, then the largest amount ever offered for an MLS player, and he became another American addition to a &quot;Cottagers&quot;&#x27; squad which included U.S. internationals Brian McBride and Carlos Bocanegra.

On January 11, 2007, he was granted a work permit from the Home Office as Fulham announced his signing on a long-term deal. This made Dempsey the most expensive American export to the Premier League in a deal worth a reported £2 million. He made his Fulham debut in a 1–1 home draw against Tottenham Hotspur on January 20, 2007. His FA Cup debut followed seven days later in a 3–0 home win over Stoke City.

Dempsey scored his first goal for Fulham on May 5 when he struck the only goal of a 1–0 home win over Liverpool. This goal saved Fulham from relegation and effectively guaranteed their place in the top-flight for the following season.

====2007–08 season====
Dempsey was not in the starting XI for the first three matches of the 2007–08 season, but after an injury to Brian McBride, he came into the side as a striker and scored in a 2–1 defeat against Aston Villa. He followed this up by scoring in Fulham&#x27;s next fixture in a 3–3 home draw against Tottenham on September 1.

Two weeks later, he opened the scoring in Fulham&#x27;s 1–1 away draw against Wigan Athletic.

These goals gave Dempsey three in as many games. On September 29, Dempsey was involved in an aerial collision with John Terry during a 0–0 draw at Stamford Bridge which resulted in Terry later being substituted. There was some suggestion that Dempsey used a deliberate elbow on Terry; however, referee Martin Atkinson did not report the incident to The Football Association.

On November 3, Dempsey scored during Fulham&#x27;s 3–1 home win over Reading to secure just a second league win of the season.

He scored his last goals of the season in a 1–1 home draw with Wigan Athletic and a 5–1 away loss to Tottenham in December.

In May 2008, Fulham announced Dempsey had signed a contract extension which would keep him at the club until the summer of 2010. Fulham beat Portsmouth 1–0 on the final day of the season to secure Premier League status for another year. He ended the season as Fulham&#x27;s top Premier League goalscorer with six goals.

====2008–09 season====
Dempsey made the Fulham XI only once in the first eleven fixtures of the 2008–09 season but scored his first goal in a 1–1 away draw at Portsmouth on October 26 after coming on as a substitute. He replaced Zoltan Gera in the side and scored his first home goal of the season in a 3–0 win over Middlesbrough on December 20. Eight days later he scored twice in the West London derby against Chelsea which included a last-minute equalizer in a 2–2 home draw.

On February 24, 2009, Dempsey scored the first FA Cup goal of his career in a 2–1 home win over Swansea City in the fifth-round. His final home goal of the season came in a 2–1 defeat to Blackburn Rovers on March 11. Fulham came from a goal down to beat Manchester City 3–1 away from home as Dempsey scored two goals on April 12.

For the second successive season, Dempsey ended as Fulham&#x27;s top Premier League goalscorer joint with Andrew Johnson with seven goals. These goals helped Fulham secure a seventh-place finish in the Premier League, the highest in the club&#x27;s history, and confirmed their qualification for the newly formed UEFA Europa League for the following season.

====2009–10 season====
On August 13, 2009, Dempsey signed a contract extension to remain with Fulham through 2013.On August 20, he scored his first goal in European competition, in the new Europa League, netting Fulham&#x27;s second goal in a 3–1 win against Amkar Perm in the play-off round.

On December 30, &quot;La Gazzetta dello Sport&quot; named Dempsey as one of the top eleven Premier League players of the season.

On January 17, 2010, Dempsey suffered a suspected cruciate knee ligament injury in a 2–0 away defeat to Blackburn Rovers.

On March 11, Dempsey returned, coming on in the last minute of Fulham&#x27;s loss away to Juventus, and then completed 72 minutes of Fulham&#x27;s 3–0 away loss to Manchester United in the league.

On March 18, Dempsey came off the bench against Juventus in their second-leg, last-16 tie in the Europa League and scored the winner on a long chip shot. Fulham won the game 4–1, and this game resulted in the club winning an award, as well as Dempsey receiving an award for his goal.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; suggested that the goal &quot;might become the most famous goal in Fulham&#x27;s history&quot;.

On May 12, Dempsey replaced Bobby Zamora in the 55th minute of the 2010 UEFA Europa League Final, thus making history in becoming the first ever American to appear in a major European final. In the end, Fulham lost the match, as Atlético Madrid&#x27;s Diego Forlán scored in the 116th minute of extra time, giving Atlético a 2–1 win.

His performances throughout 2009–10 earned him the designation of Most Valuable Player among Americans in Europe by SoccerOverThere.com, among other sources.

====2010–11 season====
Dempsey was on the substitutes&#x27; bench for Fulham&#x27;s first two away games of 2010–11, but became a regular starter, one of only five U.S. players in the Premier League to do so. On September 18, 2010, he scored an equalizing goal on 56 minutes with a header against Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park in the 1–1 draw to continue Fulham&#x27;s unbeaten record in the Premier League.

On October 2, he scored against West Ham United past Robert Green, the same keeper that he had scored against in the World Cup. He continued his form by scoring two goals against Wigan Athletic on October 30 as Fulham ran out 2–0 winners.

On January 22, 2011, Dempsey scored another double versus Stoke City, putting Fulham temporarily out of relegation contention.

On March 19, Dempsey became the first American player to score ten goals in a Premier League season, beating Brian McBride&#x27;s previous record of nine, also set while at Fulham in the 2005–06 season and 2006–07 season.

Dempsey broke Fulham&#x27;s Premier League goalscoring record by netting twice in a 3–0 victory over Bolton on April 27, 2011. He has scored a total of 33 goals for the team in the Premier League, topping both Brian McBride and Steed Malbranque, each with 32. With these goals, he scored 12 goals for Fulham in the 2010–11 season.

Dempsey was voted Fulham player of the season for 2010–11 by the Fulham fans, and his 12 Premier League strikes meant he was the club&#x27;s leading goalscorer for the campaign.

====2011–12 season====
Dempsey scored a brace in the first leg of Fulham&#x27;s 2011–12 Europa League play-off clash against Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk at Craven Cottage. Dempsey ended with two goals as Fulham ran out 3–0 winners, setting up a comfortable second leg in Ukraine.

On December 5, 2011, Dempsey scored in the 85th minute to secure a 1–0 win against Liverpool at Craven Cottage. The goal propelled Dempsey to become the most prolific U.S. goalscorer in the Premier League, passing Fulham legend and fellow American Brian McBride. Dempsey scored his fifth Premier League goal of the campaign with a header in a 2–0 home win against Bolton on December 17, lifting his side six points clear of the drop zone.

In the club&#x27;s West London derby against rivals Chelsea on Boxing Day, Dempsey scored the equalizing goal as the game ended in a 1–1 draw. Dempsey became only the second American to post a hat trick in the FA Cup behind Chris Cleary with the first hat-trick of his career on January 7 against Charlton Athletic in their FA Cup third round game that ended in a 4–0 victory. On January 21, 2012, Dempsey scored his first Premier League hat-trick against Newcastle while the game ended in a 5–2 win for Fulham and sent his goal tally in the Premier League to nine for the season.

With his hat-trick against Newcastle, he became the first ever U.S. player to score a hat-trick in the Premier League. Dempsey scored his 10th Premier League goal of the season, sixteenth in all competitions, in a 1–1 draw against former manager Roy Hodgson&#x27;s West Brom on February 1, 2012.

Dempsey &quot;assisted&quot; another goal in a 2–1 win against Stoke City on February 11, 2012. His 28th-minute shot hit the crossbar and was deflected by Stoke goalkeeper Thomas Sørensen. It was therefore awarded as an own goal off the goalie. His form this season continued against Wolverhampton Wanderers where Dempsey scored twice in a 5–0 victory for Fulham.

On March 8, 2012, the day before Dempsey&#x27;s 29th birthday, Fulham manager Martin Jol revealed that the club had opened talks with Dempsey over a new three-year contract.

Dempsey scored his fourteenth and fifteenth Premier League goals of the campaign, bringing his tally to twenty-one in all competitions, in a 3–0 away win over Bolton Wanderers on April 7, the first a free kick and the second a header. The strikes moved Dempsey past Louis Saha&#x27;s record of thirteen Premier League goals for the club in a single season. Dempsey finished fourth on the FWA Footballer of the Year list behind the winner, Arsenal&#x27;s Robin van Persie, and Manchester United pair Wayne Rooney and Paul Scholes, who came in second and third, respectively. Dempsey became the first American player to reach the milestone of fifty goals in the Premier League, with a free kick against Sunderland in the last home game of the season.

On August 31, 2012, Fulham confirmed Dempsey&#x27;s transfer to Tottenham Hotspur.

===Tottenham Hotspur===
On August 31, 2012, Dempsey joined Tottenham Hotspur on a three-year contract for a fee believed to be in the region of $9 million.

The deal made Dempsey the highest salaried U.S. soccer player of all time. With the 23 shirt that he wore at Fulham and the number 8 that he usually wore on international duty unavailable, he opted for the number 2 jersey, more usually associated with the right-back, which he wore at Furman University. He scored his first and the eventual match-winning goal for Tottenham in a 3–2 win over Manchester United. It was the first time in 23 years that Tottenham had won at Old Trafford. He scored his second goal for Spurs in the 39th minute in an away game at Southampton in October. Dempsey&#x27;s third and fourth goals were scored against Everton in an eventual 2–1 loss and a deflected effort against Reading on New Year&#x27;s Day to help Spurs win 3–1. In the FA Cup 3rd round, he scored a double against Coventry City.

On January 20, 2013, in driving snow at White Hart Lane against league leaders Manchester United, Dempsey was able to salvage a dramatic 1–1 draw for Spurs by slotting home a pass from Aaron Lennon in the 93rd minute. The goal was his fourth in four appearances in 2013. On January 27, 2013, Dempsey scored a looping header against Leeds United at Elland Road, in the FA Cup to bring the score to 2–1, however Tottenham couldn&#x27;t draw level throughout the rest of the game, leaving the result at 2–1 to Leeds at the whistle.

Dempsey was unable to make an impression against his old club on March 17, when Fulham came away from White Hart Lane with a 1–0 victory. On April 21, he scored the first of three goals for Tottenham in a 3–1 win over Manchester City at White Hart Lane. On May 12, Dempsey scored a long range goal and added an assist while playing against Stoke City to help Spurs win 2–1, and keep them in contention for the fourth Champions League spot. On April 11, 2013, Dempsey scored two goals against Basel in the second leg of the Europa League quarter-finals to send the match into extra time. Tottenham eventually lost the match on penalties and thus were eliminated from the competition.

=== Seattle Sounders ===
On August 3, 2013, Dempsey signed with MLS club Seattle Sounders FC as a Designated Player on a four-year contract, for a transfer fee of $9 million. He again donned the number 2 shirt, forgoing the number 8 he usually wears for the United States and the number 23 he wore at Fulham. The previous user of the number 2 shirt, DeAndre Yedlin, moved to number 17. Dempsey made his league debut for Seattle on August 10, 2013, in a 2–1 victory over Toronto. Dempsey entered the match as a 34th-minute substitute, after Obafemi Martins came off with an ankle injury.

====Loan to Fulham====
On December 24, 2013, Dempsey re-signed with Fulham on a two-month loan. He made his return debut on January 4, 2014, in the Third Round of the FA Cup against Norwich City. Dempsey played the entire game which resulted in a 1–1 draw, and subsequently took part in the replay at Craven Cottage, a 3–0 victory for Fulham.

==== Return to Seattle ====

Although no announcement was made by Fulham, Dempsey appeared in the Seattle squad to face Sporting Kansas City in the season opener on March 10, 2014. Dempsey had made a return to form, scoring a hat-trick against Portland Timbers, and recording braces against FC Dallas and the Colorado Rapids, leaving his goal tally at 8 in 5 games for 2014. He earned the MLS&#x27;s Player of the Month award for April. Both Dempsey&#x27;s 15 goals and 10 assists were MLS career highs, as Seattle won the Supporters&#x27; Shield, but were eliminated in the conference finals of the MLS Cup by eventual champions LA Galaxy.

On June 16, 2015, in the fourth round of the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup against rivals the Portland Timbers, Dempsey was sent off for ripping up referee Daniel Radford&#x27;s notebook in protest at the dismissal of Michael Azira. The Sounders finished the match with seven men through three dismissals and an injury, and lost 1–3 at home. For the incident, he was given a three-match MLS suspension and a fine, and banned from the Open Cup for two years in addition to a second fine.

On July 13, 2016, Dempsey picked up his first MLS red card after putting his hands in the face of FC Dallas midfielder Juan Esteban Ortiz, who came in with a late challenge on Dempsey. Earlier in the game, Dempsey scored and provided an assist on Jordan Morris&#x27;s goal. On August 7, he scored a hat-trick against Orlando City SC to capture their second road victory of the 2016 season. Dempsey played his last game of the season on August 21 against Portland, picking up a brace in the 3–1 win, while simultaneously setting a franchise record for the most goals by a player against one team in MLS play, with the goals being his seventh and eighth. While his absence in Seattle&#x27;s next game at Houston was a scheduled rest, Dempsey was sidelined with an irregular heartbeat ahead of their Cascadia rivalry tie in Portland.

After returning to training in September, Dempsey was ruled out for the remainder of the season by general manager Garth Lagerwey on September 27.

Although there was speculation about the irregular heartbeat ending his career, Dempsey was eventually cleared to play in time for the 2017 MLS season. During the season Dempsey tallied 12 goals in 29 regular season appearances and was named MLS Comeback Player of the Year for 2017.

He announced his retirement from soccer on August 29, 2018.

==International career==

For the national team, Dempsey has frequently lined up as a striker due to his scoring threat and aerial ability, but his preferred and more normal role is off the striker.

===Early career: 2005 and 2007 Gold Cups and 2006 World Cup===

Dempsey first played for the United States national team at the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship in the United Arab Emirates. He made his first appearance with the senior team on November 17, 2004, against Jamaica in qualification for the 2006 World Cup, replacing Ramiro Corrales for the final 23 minutes of a 1–1 draw at the Columbus Crew Stadium.

On May 28, 2005, he scored his first international goal on his sixth cap, a consolation in a 2–1 defeat to England at Soldier Field, Chicago, by heading in after a save by goalkeeper David James. Dempsey&#x27;s first international tournament was the United States&#x27; victorious 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup campaign; he netted their first goal, equalising as they came from behind to defeat Cuba 4–1 at Qwest Field in Seattle.

Dempsey was named to the US roster for the 2006 World Cup in Germany. He was the only American player to score a goal in the tournament, a group stage elimination, with his equalizing goal in the Americans&#x27; eventual 2–1 loss to Ghana. He won the highest individual honor in soccer in America when he was named Honda Player of the Year for 2006, beating Fulham teammates Kasey Keller and Brian McBride in a poll of sportswriters. Dempsey received 237 points in voting by 207 sports journalists to claim the award.

Dempsey was also present as the United States defended their title at the 2007 Gold Cup, again scoring their opening goal, the sole goal in a victory against Guatemala at The Home Depot Center; his side-footed shot from Taylor Twellman&#x27;s assist gave the nation victory in Bob Bradley&#x27;s first match as coach.

===2009 Confederations Cup and 2010 World Cup===
In the United States&#x27; opening 2010 World Cup qualifier, Dempsey recorded the then fastest goal in U.S. qualifying history with a chest trap and sliding shot 53 seconds into an 8–0 defeat of Barbados. But thereafter, Dempsey experienced a dip in form leading some to doubt his first-choice status with the national team. However, Dempsey turned his fortunes around in the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup. In the final group stage match against Egypt, Dempsey scored a trademark diving header off a Jonathan Spector cross, making the final result 3–0. This, combined with Brazil&#x27;s 3–0 victory against Italy in the other group match that was being played simultaneously, put the United States through to the semi-finals. In the semi-final match against Spain, Dempsey scored to put the U.S. up 2–0 to send them to the finals. He was named the Man of the Match for his performance. Dempsey scored in his third straight game in the Confederations Cup Final against Brazil, redirecting a similar cross from Spector in the 10th minute to open the scoring.

Following the loss, he was awarded the Bronze Ball as the tournament&#x27;s 3rd best performer. He ended the World Cup qualifying campaign tied with Landon Donovan as the team&#x27;s second top scorer, behind Jozy Altidore, with five goals in thirteen matches.

On June 12, 2010, Dempsey became the second American (after Brian McBride) to score in more than one World Cup when he scored the equalizer goal against England in the Americans&#x27; first game of the 2010 World Cup after the England goalkeeper Robert Green made a major error. Dempsey&#x27;s disallowed goal later in the tournament against Algeria in the group stage was very controversial. Dempsey was called offside, but the replay showed that he was most likely not offside. Despite this call, his teammate Landon Donovan scored a late stoppage time goal to win the game 1–0.

===2011 Gold Cup===
During the 2011 Gold Cup, Dempsey played a key role in helping the United States advance to the final. In the group stages he recorded a goal in a 2–0 win over Canada, and in the quarter-finals, Dempsey also scored a goal in a 2–0 win over Jamaica. In the semi-finals against Panama, who had shockingly defeated the United States 1–2 in the group stage, Dempsey scored the only goal to advance the Americans to the final. With a sliding touch Dempsey redirected Landon Donovan&#x27;s pass into the net.

On February 29, 2012, Dempsey scored the lone goal in an international friendly win against four-time World champion Italy. Jozy Altidore assisted on the goal, allowing the United States to win for the first time against Italy in eleven games played since 1934.

===2014 World Cup and 2015 Gold Cup===
Dempsey broke his own fastest-goal record in World Cup qualifying on September 7, scoring just 39 seconds into a 2–1 defeat against Jamaica in Kingston. During a qualifying match against Guatemala on October 16, 2012, Dempsey scored his 29th and 30th international goal, tying him with Brian McBride for third most goals scored for the United States national team. The goals helped the United States advance into the final qualifying stage for the 2014 World Cup.

In March 2013, Dempsey was given the captain&#x27;s armband by Jürgen Klinsmann for the important World Cup qualifying matches versus Costa Rica and Mexico. On June 2, 2013, Dempsey scored two goals against Germany in a 4–3 win. The goals were his 34th and 35th overall for the national team, surpassing Eric Wynalda as second all-time top-goalscorer for the United States. Dempsey became the 14th American to reach 100 caps on September 6, 2013, netting a penalty in a 3–1 away defeat to Costa Rica in a qualifier.

In 2014, Dempsey was named as captain of the 23-man United States squad ahead of the FIFA World Cup. On June 16, he scored against Ghana 29 seconds into the group play match. It was the fastest goal in American World Cup history, and fifth fastest goal in all-time World Cup history. With this goal, Dempsey also became the first American player to score in three consecutive World Cups. Dempsey went on to suffer a broken nose midway through the first half as the United States defeated Ghana 2–1. In the following match against Portugal, Dempsey notched his fourth World Cup goal in a 2–2 draw. This goal drew Dempsey level with Bert Patenaude as the second-highest goalscoring American in the World Cup, one behind Landon Donovan.

Before the 2015 Gold Cup, Jurgen Klinsmann gave Michael Bradley the captain&#x27;s armband, in wake of the U.S. Open Cup incident.

During the Gold Cup, Dempsey scored both U.S. goals in a 2–1 group stage win over Honduras at the Toyota Stadium in his native Texas. Three days later, at his former club ground in New England, he struck the only goal to defeat Haiti, sending his team into the quarter-finals, where he scored his first international hat-trick in a 6–0 victory against Cuba. In the third-place play-off, he scored his seventh goal of the tournament to equalize for a 1–1 draw against Panama, and also netted his attempt in the penalty shootout which his team eventually lost; he finished the tournament as its top scorer.

===Copa América Centenario===
In June 2016, Dempsey started all three group stage games of the Copa América Centenario. Against Costa Rica, he recorded his 50th international goal, and against Paraguay he recorded his 51st international goal to help the U.S. finish first in the group and advance to the quarter-finals. The U.S. were eliminated in the semi-finals by Argentina. In the quarter-final win over Ecuador, Dempsey scored the opening goal and assisted on the second goal, which was scored by Zardes.

===2018 World Cup Qualification===
Dempsey&#x27;s first goal during qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup was scored in the 4–0 victory by the U.S. over Guatemala on March 29, 2016, at the MAPFRE Stadium in Columbus, Ohio. He also earned an assist on the fourth goal of the evening, scored by Jozy Altidore.

On March 24, 2017, during the final round of qualification, Dempsey scored a hat trick in the 6–0 victory by the U.S. over Honduras, one goal from a free kick and the other two assisted by Christian Pulisic at the Avaya Stadium in San Jose. Four days after that, on March 28, he scored the U.S.&#x27;s lone goal, again assisted by Pulisic, in a 1–1 draw with Panama at the Estadio Rommel Fernández in Panama City.

===2017 Gold Cup===
Dempsey was named to the 40-man preliminary roster for the 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup by head coach Bruce Arena on June 3, 2017.

Dempsey was not named to the 23-man roster released on June 25, but was eligible to be called up as one of six roster replacements following the conclusion of the group stage. On July 16, Dempsey was called in to replace Dom Dwyer. He assisted Eric Lichaj&#x27;s first international goal in the U.S.&#x27;s 2–0 victory over El Salvador in the quarter-finals on July 19, tying him with Claudio Reyna for fourth on the U.S. all-time assists list. On July 22, Dempsey assisted Altidore&#x27;s goal and scored a free kick to defeat Costa Rica 0–2, sending the U.S. to the final, and seeing Dempsey overtake Reyna for fourth place in assists with 20 and tie Landon Donovan for most U.S. goals of all time at 57.

==Style of play==

Dempsey is known for his versatility and ability to play either as a forward, winger or attacking midfielder, depending on the formation. As a result, he has been categorized interchangeably as a forward or midfielder, as evidenced in the 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cup squads where he was classified as a forward (FW) in the latter tournament and a midfielder (MF) in the former. During his time in Fulham, he established himself as goal-scorer who is able to score with both his head and feet, especially during important matches. Critics have described him as &quot;audacious&quot; due to his penchant for the odd &quot;wonder goal&quot; and reputation as &quot;the guy who walked onto the field and started doing backheels&quot;, leading former national team coach Bruce Arena to say of him, &quot;He tries shit.&quot;
Dempsey has occasionally been prone to aggressive play including physical altercations with opponents over the course of his career, which have sometimes resulted in suspensions.

==Personal life==
Dempsey is married to Bethany Keegan Dempsey. They have six children and live in Pinehurst, North Carolina.

Dempsey is a practicing Catholic. He grew up in a Catholic family, going to church every Sunday with his grandmother. He has spoken about his faith, saying: &quot;I play to the best of my abilities and am thankful for the many opportunities and amazing success God has given me. Through it all, I want to do right, not make mistakes, and live a life that is pleasing to Him.&quot;

Dempsey is a fan of the NFL&#x27;s Houston Texans. Although not known for his fandom of hockey, he sounded the siren before the Carolina Hurricanes 2022 Stanley Cup Playoffs Round 2, Game 5 matchup against the New York Rangers in Raleigh, North Carolina, on May 27, 2022.

===Music===
One of Dempsey&#x27;s passions outside of soccer is hip hop music. Using the alias &quot;Deuce&quot;, he, along with fellow Texas rappers XO and the late Houston rapper Big Hawk from the Screwed Up Click, is featured rapping the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Tread&quot; in a Nike soccer advertising campaign for the 2006 World Cup, with the intention to showcase both the sport&#x27;s working-class roots and the United States team ahead of the World Cup. The song&#x27;s video is dedicated to his sister Jennifer. The video ends with a shot of Dempsey placing a flower at his sister&#x27;s grave.
==Endorsements==
Dempsey, along with global cover star Lionel Messi, was featured on the cover of EA Sports&#x27; multi-platform video game &quot;FIFA 15&quot; in the U.S. and Canada.

<text>Jeff Parke (born March 23, 1982) is an American former soccer player. He played 11 seasons in Major League Soccer, appearing in over 250 matches.

==Youth==

Parke played for powerhouse youth club FC Delco. He then played four years of college soccer at Drexel University.

==Professional==
===New York===
Parke was drafted by the MetroStars with 60th and last overall pick of the 2004 MLS SuperDraft. He played in the 2005 pre-season, scoring the game-winning goal against Norway&#x27;s Viking FK in the 2005 La Manga Cup, which helped him earn a starting spot on the MLS team. He remained an important part of the team&#x27;s defense in 2005 and 2006, quickly becoming one of the team&#x27;s stalwarts on the back line. In 2006, he started a career-high 31 games, was named Red Bulls&#x27; Ironman of the Year for logging in a team-high 2,771 minutes, and was named Co-Unsung Player of the Year by members of the soccer media, sharing that honor with Seth Stammler. In 2007 Parke continued to be a fixture in the Red Bull lineup, appearing in 28 matches including 27 starts. In 2008, he appeared in 24 league matches for New York Red Bulls.

===Other MLS clubs===
On November 26, 2008, Parke was selected by Seattle Sounders FC in the third round of the 2008 MLS Expansion Draft, but he chose not to sign with Seattle. Instead, on March 31, 2009, Parke signed a one-year contract with the Vancouver Whitecaps of the USL First Division.

In May 2010, Parke did sign with Seattle. He remained with the club for three seasons and was voted Seattle&#x27;s defender of the year in both 2011 and 2012. In December 2012, Parke was traded to his hometown side Philadelphia Union in exchange for a 2013 MLS Supplemental Draft pick and allocation money.
On January 14, 2014, Parke was traded to D.C. United in exchange for Ethan White. Parke played only 13 games for the club, before a combination of foot injuries and migraines requiring inner-ear surgery sidelined him for the rest of the season.

==International==
On January 5, 2012, Parke was called into camp for the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team in preparation for friendly matches against Venezuela and Panama. He made his international debut against Panama, coming on in the 55th minute for Chris Wondolowski after Geoff Cameron received a red card.

==Drug controversy==
On October 16, 2008, Parke, along with goalkeeper Jon Conway, was suspended for 10 matches each and fined 10 percent of their annual salaries after testing positive for a banned performance-enhancing drug. Parke and Conway tested positive for androstenedione (ATD) and boldenone metabolites, two banned performance-enhancing steroids, after taking an over-the-counter supplement they purchased at The Vitamin Shoppe. The suspensions are currently the longest in MLS history.

<doc id="1007508" wikidata="Q323069" url="?curid=1007508" title="Trullo">
<text>A trullo (plural, trulli) is a traditional Apulian dry stone hut with a conical roof. Their style of construction is specific to the Itria Valley, in the Murge area of the Italian region of Apulia. Trulli were generally constructed as temporary field shelters and storehouses or as permanent dwellings by small proprietors or agricultural labourers. In the town of Alberobello, in the province of Bari, whole districts contain dense concentrations of trulli. The golden age of trulli was the nineteenth century, especially its final decades, which were marked by the development of wine growing.

==From the to the ==
The Italian term &quot;trullo&quot; (from the Greek word , cupola) refers to a house whose internal space is covered by a dry stone corbelled or keystone vault. is an Italianized form of the dialectal term, , used in a specific area of the Salentine peninsula (i.e. Lizzaio, Maruggio, and Avetrana, in other words, outside the Murgia dei Trulli proper), where it is the name of the local agricultural dry stone hut. has replaced the local term (pl. ) (Italian , pl. ), which was used by locals in the Murgia to call this type of house.

A stonemason specializing in the building of is a or in Italian. The corresponding dialectal term is ( in the plural), i.e. builder of .

==History==

There are many theories behind the origin of the design. One of the more popular theories is that due to high taxation on property, the people of Apulia built dry stone wall constructions so that they could be dismantled quickly when tax inspectors were in the area.

In available historical records from the mid-fourteenth century to the late sixteenth century, the area of Alberobello is referred to mostly as &quot;selva&quot; (&quot;forest&quot;) and occasionally, as a land from which grazing animals were excluded. Evidence is lacking as to the existence of dwellings in the area prior to the seventeenth century.

A &quot;Plan of the Territory of Mottala&quot; drawn by Donato Gallerano in 1704 reveals the existence of a nucleus of trulli in the midst of a large wood, making up the initial settlement of &quot;Arbore bello&quot; (&quot;beautiful tree&quot;).

In a geographical map drawn by Giovanni Antonio Rizzi Zannoni in 1808, one may see the &quot;selva&quot; of Alberobello and, in the midst of it, a clearing with a settlement pattern of scattered houses that bears a striking resemblance to the present-day urban pattern.

In an 1897 photograph of the &quot;rione Monti&quot; (the district of the Mounts), the trulli are far less densely packed than today, being surrounded by enclosed gardens.

The urban trulli still extant in Alberobello date from the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries. After having undergone a process of densification in the first decades of the twentieth century, the trulli settlements began to be deserted during the second half of the twentieth century.

The rural trulli, on cheaper land, ceased to be built when the cost of labour began to rise in the twentieth century. The sheer expense of handling the hundreds of tons necessary for a single house became prohibitive.

==Distribution==
The style of construction is specific to the Itria Valley, in the Murge area of the Italian region of Apulia. Trulli may be found in and out of Alberobello, and in the areas around Locorotondo, Fasano, Ostuni, Cisternino, Martina Franca, and Ceglie Messapica.

==Geology==
The Murgia is a karst plateau. Winter rains drain through the soil into fissures in the strata of limestone bedrock and flow through underground watercourses into the Adriatic. There is no permanent surface water, and water for living purposes must be trapped in catchment basins and cisterns. The surface forms a landscape of rolling hills and ridges punctuated now and again with dolines and other forms of enclosed depressions characteristic of karsts.

==Architecture==

===Grouping===
The trullo is essentially a rural building type. With its thick walls and its inability to form multi-storey structures, it is an inefficient use of ground space and consequently ill-suited for high density settlement. Being constructed of small stones, however, it has a flexibility and adaptability of form making the design most helpful in tight urban situations.

In the countryside, trullo domes were built singly or in groups of up to five, or sometimes, in large farmyard clusters of a dozen or two dozen, but never for the occupancy of more than a single rural family.

===Materials===

Depending on the area, the building material used could be either hard limestone or calcareous tufa.

===Masonry===
Traditionally trulli were built using dry stone masonry, i.e. without any mortar or cement. This style of construction also is prevalent in the surrounding countryside where most of the fields are separated by dry-stone walls.

===Walls===
In Alberobello, the structural walls of a trullo are laid directly on the bedrock, after removal of the topsoil when necessary. Their width varies from 0.80 metres to 2.70 metres (a measure recorded in the Trullo Sovrano). Their height (from ground level to where the vault starts) ranges from 1.60 metres to 2 metres. Their exterior facing has a 3 to 5% batter.

===Underground cistern===
The stones needed for starting to build a trullo were provided by digging a cistern (&quot;cisterna&quot;), an absolute necessity in an area devoid of water. The cistern was capped with a lime-mortared barrel vault or dome that in many cases, supported the floor of the house.

===Roofs===

The roofs are constructed in two skins: an inner skin of limestone voussoirs, capped by a closing stone, and an outer skin of limestone slabs that are slightly tilted outwardly, ensuring that the structure is watertight. The roof stones may be taken away without compromising the stability of the rest of the building.

===Plans===
The trullo may take on a circular or a square plan. The circular trullo is mostly a temporary shelter for animals and their fodder, or, for the peasant himself.

The trullo that is part of a grouping of three, four, or five follows a squarish plan. It may serve as a kitchen, bedroom, animal shelter, store room for food or tools, oven, or cistern, as the case may be.

In Alberobello, groupings did not exceed two &quot;trulli&quot;, as evidenced by nineteenth-century notarial deeds.

===Pinnacles===
In Alberobello, atop the cone of a trullo, there is normally a hand-worked sandstone pinnacle (&quot;pinnacolo&quot;), that may be one of many designs: disk, ball, cone, bowl, polyhedron, or a combination thereof, that is supposed to be the signature of the stonemason who built the trullo.

===Whitewashed symbols===

Additionally, the cone may have a symbol painted on it (as shown in the picture of the trulli in Alberobello.) Such symbols may include Christian symbols such as a simple cross, a cross on a heart pierced by an arrow (representing &quot;Santa Maria Addolorata&quot; (&quot;Our Lady of Sorrows&quot;), a circle divided into four quarters with the letters S, C, S, D in them (for &quot;Sanctus Christus&quot; and &quot;Sanctus Dominus&quot; according to one source, but more likely, the initials of &quot;Santo Cosma&quot; and &quot;Santo Damiano&quot;, the two saints to whom the local basilica is dedicated) and quite a few others.

The symbols now visible on a row of trulli in via Monte Pertica (cross, pierced heart, host with rays radiating from it, tree, dove symbolising the Holy Spirit, and crescent with a cross) were painted only in the late twentieth century and the early 2000s when the roof cones were renovated.

The quaint symbols that grace the trullo-like cones of bungalows at the Hotel dei Trulli in Alberobello first appeared in the late 1950s, when the hotel resort was built.

===Interiors===

The vast majority of trulli have one room under each conical roof, with additional living spaces in arched alcoves. Children would sleep in alcoves made in the wall with curtains hung to separate them from the central room.

A multi-room trullo house has many cones, each representing a separate room.

Along with its exterior wall, a trullo&#x27;s interior room and vault intrados often were rendered with lime plaster and whitewashed for protection against drafts.

The trulli used as dwellings all have an open fireplace complete with a flue (hidden in the masonry) and a stone-built chimney stack (rising high above the roof). Because of their design, trulli are difficult to heat: the walls are very thick and warm air will rise up the interior cone. An alternative heating solution was to use a central brasero with embers in it (a specimen may be seen in Alberobello&#x27;s Museo del Territorio).

The thick stone walls and dome of the trullo that cool pleasantly during the summer, tend to become unpleasantly cold during the winter months, condensing the moisture given off by cooking and breathing, making it difficult to feel warm even in front of the fire. The inhabitants simply leave the doors open during the day to keep the interior dry, and live more outdoors than in.

In trulli that were used as stables, the troughs the animals fed from may still be seen.

===Windows===
Owing to the concentration of houses, trulli have few openings except for their doorway and a small aperture provided in the roof cone for ventilation, this coupled with the extremely high thermal inertia makes them warmer in winter and cooler in the summer. On the other hand trulli can be quite dark inside.

===Façades===
Some trullo houses have had their perimeter walls raised substantially so that their cones may be hidden from view, making the buildings resemble ordinary houses.

A number of conical roofs have a truncated top with a round hole in it covered by a movable circular slab. Access to the hole is by an outside stairway built into the roof. These trulli were for storage of grain, hay, or straw.
==Trulli as a tourist attraction==
Today, the surviving trulli are popular with British and German tourists and are often bought and restored for general use. Anyone wishing to restore a trullo, however, needs to conform with many regulations, as trulli are protected under the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) world heritage law.

Since the beginning of the twenty-first century, a large number of trullo houses have been restored and converted into second homes or self-catering cottages. In 1999, rebuilding a trullo roof would cost about three million lira (about 1,500 euros) and in 2009, the cost rose up to 15,000 euros.

In late twentieth century the Monti district in Alberobello was largely a derelict area when Antonella Guido and Dino Barnaba began buying up a few dozen abandoned trulli, installed modern kitchenettes in them with a view to renting them out as mini apartments for the night for less than rooms cost at local hotels. They even painted good-luck symbols on the roof of each trullo.
In Apulia region some Trulli are still inhabited, most of them have been made compliant with hygienic norms; the ones closer to cities have often been converted into rooms for an adjacent home or villa built with modern techniques; this trend has slowed because most of these modifications are considered illegal due to the damage to the historical structure.

In the Alberobello region, local residents who still live in trulli do so only because they cannot afford to move out or, because they provide bed and board for tourists in their trulli.

===Climate===
Seiyo has a diverse climate, from the inland mountain plateau (Onogahara), where more than 2 meters of snow accumulates in winter, to the warm coastal area, and the basin with a lot of fog due to the influence of two dams. During the typhoon season, coastal areas are often damaged by high tides and high waves, and mountainous areas are often damaged by landslides caused by heavy rain. The temperature can differ by more than 10 degrees between the coastal area and Onogahara. In general, Seiyo has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light snowfall. The average annual temperature in Seiyo is 15.3 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1663 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in January, at around 26.1 °C, and lowest in January, at around 4.7 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Seiyo has decreased steadily since the 1960s.

== History ==
The area of Seiyo was part of ancient Iyo Province. During the Edo period, the areaway part of the holdings of Uwajima Domain or its subsidiary Iyo-Yoshida Domain. Following the Meiji restoration, the area was organized into towns and villages within Higashiuwa District and Nishiuwa District in Ehime Prefecture. The city of Seiyo was established on April 1, 2004, from the merger of the towns of Akehama, Nomura, Shirokawa and Uwa (all from Higashiuwa District), and the town of Mikame (from Nishiuwa District). 

==Government==
Seiyo has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 18 members. Seiyo contributes one member to the Ehime Prefectural Assembly. 

In terms of national politics, Seiyo is part of Ehime 3rd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan. Prior to 2022, the city was part of Ehime 4th district.

==Economy==
The industrial base of Seiyo is weak and the economy is poor. In the past, the Uwa neighborhood (Unomachi) and the Nomura neighborhood were distribution points for rural goods, but due to poor transportation connection and rural depopulation, commerce has declined. The main economic activity is agriculture, with citrus fruits, rice and chestnuts are mainly cultivated. Animal husbandry (pigs, dairy cows, beef cattle) is also practiced.

==Education==
Seiyo has 12 public elementary schools and five public middle schools operated by the city government. The city has three public high schools operated by the Ehime Prefectural Board of Education, and the prefecture also operates two special education schools for the handicapped.

===Castle Land===
A wealthy eccentric built a castle on the side of a mountain near the Nomura Dam in the former town of Nomura. It was originally a retreat for parties, complete with overnight lodging facilities.

<doc id="1007525" wikidata="Q454233" url="?curid=1007525" title="Amanda Vanstone">
<text>Amanda Eloise Vanstone (née O&#x27;Brien; born 7 December 1952) is an Australian former politician and a former Ambassador to Italy. She was a Liberal Senator for South Australia from 1984 to 2007, and held several ministerial portfolios in the Howard government. After her resignation from the Senate in 2007, she then served as the Australian Ambassador to Italy until July 2010. Her time as Minister for Immigration was marked by controversies within the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.

== Early life ==
Vanstone was born Amanda Eloise O&#x27;Brien on 7 December 1952 in Adelaide, South Australia. She is the youngest of four children. Her father died when she was three. Her mother remarried soon afterwards, but not long after this her stepfather also died. She was educated at the St Peter&#x27;s Collegiate Girls&#x27; School. Vanstone has said that she does not defer to male authority due to growing up in a female-headed household and attending a school run by women.

At the University of Adelaide, Vanstone received both Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Law degrees. She also earned a Graduate Diploma in Legal Practice and a Marketing Studies Certificate from the South Australian Institute of Technology which is now the University of South Australia. In the late 1980s, she married Tony Vanstone, a commercial lawyer from Adelaide, taking his surname. Prior to entering politics, she worked as a retailer in a large department store, and later had her own business selling prints and picture-frames. She also worked as a legal practitioner.

== Political career ==
In December 1984, at age 31, Vanstone was elected the youngest member of the Australian Senate as a representative for South Australia. She was one of 27 senators for the Liberal Party of Australia elected that year. Vanstone&#x27;s maiden speech to the Senate was made on 27 March 1985 and addressed issues that young Australians had with the then Labor Government led by Prime Minister Bob Hawke.

Vanstone was a member of the Opposition Shadow Ministry from 1987 to 1988, from 1989 to 1990 and from 1993 to 1996, serving as Shadow Attorney-General and Shadow Minister for Justice from 1994 to 1996.

In May 1990, as an opposition backbencher, Vanstone was instrumental in the introduction of televised proceedings in parliament.

In March 1996, Vanstone became one of the two women (with Jocelyn Newman) in John Howard&#x27;s cabinet when she was appointed Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. In this portfolio she presided over heavy cuts to the employment programs established by the Keating government, which drew strong criticism. In October 1997 she was dropped from Cabinet and appointed Minister for Justice, a title which was changed to Minister for Justice and Customs in October 1998.

Vanstone made a comeback in January 2001 when she was re-appointed to Cabinet as Minister for Family and Community Services. During this period she was also Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women. In the Family and Community Services portfolio she presided over the Australian social security programs including Centrelink, attracting criticism by welfare activists. Vanstone frequently defended the Howard government&#x27;s policies, and the then Shadow Minister for Family and Community Services, Wayne Swan, described her as &quot;a political hyena who takes delight in attacking society&#x27;s most vulnerable&quot;.

In his reshuffle in October 2003, Howard appointed Vanstone Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation, one of the most difficult portfolios in the government because of controversies over boat people and Australia&#x27;s &quot;Pacific Solution&quot;. Her biggest decision in this portfolio was to abolish the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). The abolition of ATSIC was generally supported, but there was controversy over what should replace it.

During 2005, Vanstone became involved in some major controversies, one of them involving a defecting Chinese diplomat, Chen Yonglin, whilst others involved the deportation of Australian citizens and permanent residents who her department considered undesirable – the Cornelia Rau, Vivian Alvarez Solon, Stefan Nystrom and Robert Jovicic cases. An inquiry by the former Australian Federal Police commissioner Mick Palmer was severely critical of the Immigration Department&#x27;s treatment of Cornelia Rau, an Australian citizen wrongly presumed to be an illegal immigrant, and held in a Brisbane women&#x27;s prison for six months.

She had also been criticised for overturning a deportation order and granting a visa in 2005 to Francesco Madafferi who had been implicated by Italian officials as a dangerous mafia figure. In fact Madafferi is thought to be a member of the Calabrian &#x27;Ndrangheta, known by the name Honoured Society in Australia, which, although similar, is a crime organization distinct from the Sicilian Mafia (however, common usage is to lump all such organizations together as Mafia). Francesco and his brother Antonio (&quot;Tony&quot;) Madafferi, a stall holder in Melbourne&#x27;s Wholesale Fruit and Vegetable market (known to have been controlled by the Honoured Society), were alleged in a report by Victoria Police&#x27;s organised crime squad to belong to a crime family involved in blackmail, extortion and murder. The report was aired in 2000 at a court hearing during Francesco&#x27;s fight against deportation, but was later dismissed by an Administrative Appeals Tribunal judge as containing information from unnamed and possibly unreliable police informers. Vanstone justified her decision to grant Madafferi a visa because of a mental illness he was said to be suffering. However it is alleged that relatives and associates of Madafferi donated up to $100,000 to the Liberal Party, and that four Liberal party politicians had discussed the visa case with Madafferi&#x27;s supporters or Vanstone&#x27;s office. In August 2008, Madafferi was arrested and charged, along with several of Australia&#x27;s other suspected crime bosses (including Australian &#x27;Ndrangheta boss Pasquale &quot;Pat&quot; Barbaro), after Australian Federal Police made the world&#x27;s biggest ecstasy haul, seizing drugs with a street value of $440 million.

In January 2006, a ministerial reshuffle saw Indigenous Affairs transferred to Mal Brough. Vanstone&#x27;s title was changed to Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. In January 2007, the Senator was removed from the cabinet after an election-year reshuffle, with Kevin Andrews replacing her as the Immigration Minister in the new Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC).

In July 2006, Vanstone was criticised for holding shares in the South Australian agribusiness Wasley&#x27;s Piggery. Wasley&#x27;s had come under fire after the group, Animal Liberation Australia, revealed footage of animal conditions which they say did not adhere to the state&#x27;s animal welfare regulations. Vanstone responded stating that she is &#x27;simply one shareholder in the business&#x27;. The RSPCA later conducted an inspection and found that while the sow stall sizes were smaller than regulation, the size was only a recommendation and could not be enforced.

In February 2007, she released the lyrics to her &quot;Ode to Australia&quot;, Under Southern Stars.

On 26 April 2007, Vanstone announced her immediate resignation from politics, telling reporters, &quot;It is always important to look to the future and with that in mind it is important for me to move on to the next phase of my life&quot;.

It was announced that she was to be appointed an Ambassador to Italy.

In October 2012, Vanstone joined the board of the Port Adelaide Football Club.

In 2012 Amanda Vanstone was the guest presenter on the ABC Radio National program &#x27;Counterpoint&#x27;, and as of 2013 is now its full-time presenter every Monday at 4pm.

In 2013 and 2014 she was a member of the Abbott government&#x27;s National Commission of Audit, which was established to improve the Australian government&#x27;s budget.

She is the Chairwoman of Vision 20/20 Australia.

== Political views ==

Vanstone is a former Liberal Party politician who, as host of the &quot;Counterpoint&quot; radio program since 2013, has become a political journalist at the ABC. She supported the leadership ambitions of Malcolm Turnbull over those of Tony Abbott in the 2015 Liberal leadership spill that saw Turnbull take the Prime Ministership. She describes herself as a &quot;liberal&quot; rather than a &quot;conservative&quot;.

She was a leading member of the Liberal Party of Australia&#x27;s moderate faction and a mentor to younger Liberal moderates, including fellow South Australian Christopher Pyne.

<doc id="1007531" wikidata="Q171357" url="?curid=1007531" title="Kecskemét">
<text>Kecskemét ( ) is a city with county rights in central Hungary. It is the eighth-largest city in the country, and the county seat of Bács-Kiskun.

Kecskemét lies halfway between the capital Budapest and the country&#x27;s third-largest city, Szeged, from both of them and almost equal distance from the two big rivers of the country, the Danube and the Tisza. It is the northern of two centres of the Hungarian Southern Great Plain () region (comprising the three counties Bács-Kiskun, Békés and Csongrád); the southern centre is Szeged, the seat of Csongrád county.

==Etymology==
The name of the city stems from the Hungarian word meaning &#x27;goat&#x27; and meaning &#x27;pass&#x27;.

== Geography ==
Kecskemét was established at the meeting point of a large sandy region and a sandy yellow soil; its elevation is above sea level. The territory west of the city is covered by wind-blown sand, characterised by the almost parallel northern-southern sand dunes and the plain between them. At the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th centuries, the pastures had become depleted. Overgrazing by cattle had destroyed the natural vegetation cover, and the movement of sand seriously endangered the town. Concentrated reforestation and planting of fruit and vines was carried out to stabilise the soil again.

Kecskemét is in the centre of Kiskunság, one of Hungary&#x27;s famous regions. The Kiskunság National Park was established in 1975 to preserve the many different regional species of plants and animals. It is a &quot;mosaic&quot;-type national park, consisting of units that are not connected.

=== Climate ===
The characteristic weather in the Kecskemét region of Kiskunság is continental warm, dry, sometimes extreme. The amount of sunlight makes it possible for the region to produce agricultural products such as wheat, apricots, red peppers, and tomatoes. The warmest month in Kecskemét is July, with an average temperature of ; the coldest is January, with .

Early spring and late autumn frosts are frequent on the Great Hungarian Plain. The possibility of frost usually ends only in the middle of April. After the third week of October, the temperature is frequently below .
== History ==
The first archaeological trace of a human in the area is about five thousand years old. The Sarmatians invaded the area in the first century B.C.; since then the area has been continuously inhabited by a variety of cultures. János Hornyik, the first town historian, believed that the settlement known as &quot;Partiskum&quot; of the Sarmatian Jazygian was here. Contemporary consensus among historians is that it is more likely permanent settlement occurred only after the Hungarian conquest. At the beginning of the 13th century, there were seven villages in the area, each with a population of 200–300 formed near the village church, a typical rural pattern. They were all destroyed by the Mongol Invasion. Some of the villages revived at the time of the Cumanians&#x27; colonization.

As Kecskemét was situated at an important trading route, it grew as a customhouse and a market-place; in 1368 it was identified in one of King Louis I of Hungary&#x27;s charters as an &quot;oppidium&quot; (town). The town&#x27;s active economic life and relatively dense population attracted more traders, craftsmen and residents, including Jews who became an important part of the town.

During the Turkish invasion, settlers from neighboring villages sought shelter in Kecskemét, which was protected by defensive palisades. They also were escaping the oppression of the &quot;spahi&quot; landlords. In addition to the protection of its setting, the town of Kecskemét had arranged to pay tax directly to the &quot;pasha&quot; in Buda, thus gaining his protection and enjoying a special situation.

Kecskemét gradually absorbed the lands of those who had taken refuge in the town. Residents created a large common field for the animals they were breeding. By the beginning of the 18th century, residents held nearly 30,000 cattle, which grazed on an almost field.

At the end of the 18th century, animal breeding started to decline in economic importance, as the fields had become overgrazed and denuded. It took nearly 100 years before the region developed its next major agricultural commodity. In the 19th century, Kecskemét was already part of an important wine district, but the city increased in importance after the vine-pest destroyed most vineyards in the hilly regions. Damage was less significant in the plains&#x27; areas of loose, sandy soil. In the 1870s, landowners planted large plantations of grapevines around the town. These were the basis of the 20th-century vineyards and wine industry of the 20th century in Kecskemét. Cottage-type settlements grew up at the vineyards to house workers, a pattern still characteristic of the rural areas around the town. The growth of the wine industry stimulated those of the food industry and trade. The city is still known for its &quot;barackpálinka&quot;, an apricot brandy.

With their accumulation of capital, peasants began to adopt bourgeois customs and goods, stimulating trade in the town. Such regional wealth led to construction of new buildings, especially those surrounding Kecskemét&#x27;s main square. This Art Nouveau complex is architecturally significant: the Town Hall, the New College, the Ornamented Palace, the Luther-Palace, the House of Trade (today the House of Young), and the Gentlemen&#x27;s Casino, now used as the Hungarian Museum of Photography.

The town&#x27;s growth suffered in the 1929–33 economic world crisis and Great Depression, followed by the upheaval and destruction of World War II. During the war and especially May–June 1944, Hungarian authorities rounded up and deported most of the Jews from the city to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where most were killed. Jewish Hungarians had been an important part of Kecskemét&#x27;s thriving culture and trade. After 1945, the new Communist government, strongly influenced by the Soviet Union, imposed a different social-political system. Kecskemét&#x27;s development slowed. Due to reorganisation in local government, Kecskemét lost its big territory; several new independent villages were formed in the area. They were economically connected to the town.

In 1950, for the first time, Kecskemét took on a significant political administrative role, as it was made seat of the country&#x27;s largest county, Bács-Kiskun. In the special system of the so-called &quot;controlled economy&quot; under the Communist regimes, such status provided political and financial advantages that greatly helped the city continue its growth. The architect József Kerényi (1900–1975) adapted and renovated several historic buildings for other uses, helping keep the varied historical character of the city alive. For instance, in the early 1970s, he renovated the early-eighteenth-century Franciscan monastery for use as the Zoltán Kodály Conservatory; it opened for classes in 1975.The Hungarian Association of Photographers formed the Hungarian Photography Foundation in 1990. It helped raise funds for the restoration of an 18th-century building in Kecskemét last used as an Orthodox synagogue. It was adapted for the Hungarian Museum of Photography (&quot;Magyar Fotográfiai Múzeum&quot;), which opened in 1991. The museum holds work by Hungarian and other photographers of international and national reputations. It especially collects Hungarian photographers who successfully worked abroad.

On 18 June 2008, German car manufacturer Daimler announced that it would build a Mercedes-Benz manufacturing plant in Kecskemét, planning to invest €800 million (US$1.24 billion). The plant, one of the biggest if not the biggest-ever in the region, provides work for 2,500 people.

== Economy ==
In March 2012, the German automobile manufacturer Daimler AG opened a plant nearby Kecskemét, to manufacture the new B-Class, A-Class and CLA-Class models. The Stuttgart-based company invested €800 million (US$1.24 billion) to build the new plant, which is expected to create 3,000 new jobs in the region. According to the plans, more than 100,000 vehicles will be produced annually at the factory.
As of 2021, the largest companies were:

* Mercedes-Benz – cars: 5,000 employees
* Duvenbeck IMMO – logistic: 1,100 employees
* ACPS Automotive – towbars: 1,000 employees
* Knorr-Bremse – brakes: 950 employees
* Phoenix Mecano – enclosures and mechanical components: 850 employees
* CabTec – cable: 800 employees
* Fornetti – baked goods: 800 employees
* Univer Product – canned goods: 800 employees

In the city, unemployment is extremely low. Over the last few years, thousands of jobs have been created to promote a low unemployment rate. In 2024, unemployment was 2,70%.

== Public transport ==
With the 1900s industrialisation of Hungary, Kecskemét developed public transportation by trams for a population of 50,000. Not until after World War II did bus travel begin in the city. In 2010, with competitive funding from the EU, the city launched a number of trolley bus lines and in 2011 completely rebuilt the town centre as a trolleybus and pedestrian tourist zone.

Currently, bus travel is the only public transportation to many destinations. Bus destinations ():

<doc id="1007534" wikidata="Q314366" url="?curid=1007534" title="Brian McBride">
<text>Brian Robert McBride (born June 19, 1972) is an American former soccer player who played as a forward for Columbus Crew, Fulham and Chicago Fire. He is the sixth-highest all-time leading goalscorer for the United States national team.

For much of his career, he played in United States with stints in both Germany and England. During his time at Fulham, McBride became a fan favorite, as well as team captain. He was eventually voted &quot;Player of the Season&quot; two times. After leaving the club, they renamed the sports bar at Craven Cottage &quot;McBride&#x27;s&quot; in his honor.

==Early career==

===High school ===
Born in Arlington Heights, Illinois, McBride played varsity soccer at Buffalo Grove High School, under coach John Erfort, where he led the Bison to the Illinois state championship in 1988, his junior year. During a playoff game against Fremd, McBride broke his nose in the first half, but came back into the game to score the game-winning goal. In his four years in high school, he scored 80 goals, 33 as a senior despite playing his senior season as a defender. In the regional final, during McBride&#x27;s senior season, against Stevenson High School, he played goalkeeper. In the final, McBride stopped four of eight penalty kicks taken against him, and he scored the fifth, and winning, goal on a counterattack in extra time after the game ended tied at regulation. McBride was also named an All-American by Parade Magazine. Later, as a professional, he signed a contract with Nike with the condition that the boys&#x27; varsity soccer team receive new uniforms every two years.

=== College ===
McBride had an illustrious career with Saint Louis University, from which he graduated in 1993. In his four seasons with the Billikens, he played (and started) in 89 games, and set career records for goals (72), assists (40) and total points (184). While at school, McBride was a 1992 second team and a 1993 first-team All-American. He also was named Most Valuable Player of the Great Midwest Conference three years straight, as well as being named to the All-Conference first-team during this stretch. He trained at the world-famous Magna Fitness Center. After being such a versatile player in his amateur career, McBride decided to become a striker at the professional level. Craig Burley warned McBride that he should expect to get clattered playing that position.

McBride is one of 22 college players to be part of the 40-40 club, having both 40 goals and 40 assists in their college career.

==Club career==

===Milwaukee Rampage ===
McBride briefly played for the minor league Milwaukee Rampage. In 18 games, he scored 17 goals and assisted another 18. That year also saw Tony Sanneh playing with the Rampage. Both Sanneh and McBride played professionally in Germany, in MLS and on the United States men&#x27;s national team.

They linked up for a historic goal at the 2002 FIFA World Cup. In a game against Portugal, Sanneh, playing right back, played a cross into the box which McBride put into the top corner. After the game, McBride mentioned, &quot;We joked about it in the locker room, it is a play we have done a thousand times [while teammates with the Milwaukee Rampage]. &quot;I took a step in at the far post and lost my marker. He delivered a beautiful cross and I knocked it home.&quot;

===VfL Wolfsburg===
In 1994, McBride left the United States to ply his trade in Germany. At the time, VfL Wolfsburg played in the German Second Division and provided several aspiring American players an opportunity to play soccer in Europe. These included Chad Deering, Claudio Reyna and Mike Lapper, as well as McBride. McBride struggled to find playing time with the club and also had difficulty scoring. However, one of his two goals came in a 2–1 victory over Bayern Munich&#x27;s reserve team in the DFB-Pokal quarterfinals – Wolfsburg went on to reach the final, although McBride did not feature. At the end of the season, McBride gained a release from Wolfsburg and when MLS was created, chose to return to play in the United States.

===Columbus Crew===
McBride returned to America in 1996 for the inaugural season of Major League Soccer, for whom he was the first overall pick of the MLS Inaugural Draft. McBride played eight years with the Columbus Crew, scoring 62 goals (no longer tied for the club record with Jeff Cunningham) and 45 assists in 161 league games, before his move to England. In 2005, he was named to the MLS All-Time Best XI.

In 2011, the Crew honored McBride by naming him the inaugural member of its Circle of Honor.

===Loan spells===
Whilst playing for Columbus, McBride had two loan spells in England. The first came in 2000 when McBride played for Preston North End, then managed by David Moyes. While McBride played well for the club, he sat out several games after having a blood clot surgically removed from his arm, which consisted of having a rib removed. The clot came as a result of a hard collision McBride had suffered during his first game with Preston. As McBride&#x27;s loan spell came to an end, Preston attempted to purchase his contract from MLS for $1.8 million. MLS rejected it, considering McBride to be worth twice that amount.
Two years later, Premier League club Everton were beginning to slide down the table. David Moyes, by then with Everton, remembered McBride&#x27;s success with Preston and sought the forward&#x27;s services. During McBride&#x27;s three months with the club, he did not disappoint Moyes, scoring four goals in eight games, including his first game with the club, a 4–3 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. He made close friends during the short time with players such as Leon Osman (with whom he still plays soccer) and Richard Wright.
Everton, unlike Preston, merely sought to extend McBride&#x27;s loan period, but MLS rejected it, preferring a transfer over an extended loan for McBride.

===Fulham===

In January 2004, Premier League club Fulham bought McBride&#x27;s rights from MLS for $1.5 million. He played 18 games during the last half of the 2003–04 season, scoring a total of five goals. In 2004–05, he played 31 league games and six cup games, scoring six league and three cup goals. In 2005–06, he played 38 league games and one cup game, scoring ten league goals and one cup goal. McBride&#x27;s original contract with Fulham continued only through the 2005–06 season. However, on March 10, 2006, he signed a one-year extension which took him through the end of the 2006–07 season. On February 2, 2007, he signed yet another one-year extension, taking him through the 2007–2008 season.

McBride was Fulham&#x27;s top scorer for their 2006–07 Premier League campaign with twelve goals to his name. He was given Fulham&#x27;s captaincy in August 2007.

When scoring the opening goal in a home match against Middlesbrough on August 18, 2007, McBride dislocated his kneecap. He did not make his return to action until a friendly against Cardiff City in late January 2008, and resumed his Premier League duties as a substitute against Aston Villa on February 3, 2008. McBride scored his first goal since his injury against Everton at Craven Cottage on March 16, 2008, in a 1–0 victory for Fulham. The then-Fulham manager Chris Coleman commented it was such a shame that McBride had not been &#x27;discovered&#x27; earlier in his career, and played more in England.

After scoring twelve goals in 2006–07 season which helped Fulham retain their Premier League status, on May 14, 2007, McBride won the club&#x27;s Player of the Year award. He won it again in 2008, and became such a popular figure that the club renamed a bar inside Craven Cottage &quot;McBride&#x27;s&quot; in June 2009.

On May 28, 2008, McBride announced that he would be leaving Fulham to return to the United States to play in MLS.

===Chicago Fire===

Following the end of his one-year contract extension, McBride decided to return to the United States to end his career in MLS. He expressed his desire to play for Chicago, his hometown. However, Toronto FC held the top spot in the allocation order, the process by which U.S. National Team players returning to MLS find teams in the league.

On July 30, 2008, the top spot in the allocation order was traded to the Chicago Fire for Chad Barrett, a first round pick in the MLS SuperDraft and conditional future considerations. The Fire used the top spot to obtain McBride. He made his Fire debut on August 16, 2008, coming on as a second-half substitute against D.C. United.
McBride scored his first goal against Houston Dynamo. McBride scored the first goal in the MLS Playoff Eastern Conference Championship against the Columbus Crew, his former club. However, Chicago lost that game 2–1 and was kept from being in the MLS Playoff final.

McBride scored nine goals during the 2009 season, including two goals in the three SuperLiga games in which he played.

On September 3, 2010, McBride announced that he would retire following the 2010 MLS season. McBride scored his 80th career goal (in MLS) during his final match before being substituted off to a standing ovation.

===Wembley===
In June 2012, he was one of several former professional players who agreed to join Wembley to play in their FA Cup campaign for the new season. McBride and fellow former internationals Ray Parlour, Martin Keown, Claudio Caniggia, Jaime Moreno, Danny Dichio and Graeme Le Saux, plus David Seaman (goalkeeping coach) and former England manager Terry Venables (technical advisor), came out of retirement to play for Wembley. They were knocked out in a replay by Uxbridge after initially setting up the tie by knocking Langford out in the previous round.

==International career==
McBride was a significant player for the United States national team, earning 96 caps and scoring 30 goals in his senior international career. He made his national team debut in 1993, though he was not a member of the squad for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. He is the first-ever spokesperson for the Central Ohio Diabetes Association and donated $100 to the association for every goal and assist he tallied for the U.S. National Team.

He was part of the U.S. team that played at the 1998, 2002, and 2006 FIFA World Cups. He scored at the 1998 and 2002 tournaments and in doing so, became the first American player to score at two World Cups. (Fellow Landon Donovan and Clint Dempsey have since equaled this feat, the latter surpassing them with three.) He was the only American player that scored in the 1998 tournament, which was in a 2–1 defeat to Iran. Overall McBride is fourth behind Bert Patenaude, Dempsey and Donovan for the most World Cup goals for an American with three.

On May 2, 2006, McBride was named to the U.S. roster for his third consecutive World Cup. At the 2006 World Cup, McBride was severely bloodied in a group stage match against Italy after being elbowed in the face by Daniele De Rossi. He needed three stitches. As punishment, De Rossi was banned for four matches and fined CHF 10,000. Following the end of the tournament, McBride announced his retirement from international duty on July 26, 2006.

In 2008 McBride briefly came out of international retirement after being named as one of the three overage players on the U.S. team for the 2008 Beijing Olympics and served as captain as the team finished in third place in the group stage for their group.

==Coaching==
McBride established the Brian McBride Soccer Academy which is based in Lake Zurich, Illinois.

In January 2020, McBride was named general manager of the United States men&#x27;s national team.

<text>No. 152 (Hyderabad) Squadron RAF was an aircraft squadron of the Royal Air Force during both World War I and World War II.

==Squadron history==
===World War I===
No 152 Squadron was first formed on 1 October 1918 at RAF Rochford as a Sopwith Camel night fighter unit. On 30 June 1919, the squadron was disbanded.

===World War II===
The squadron was reformed at RAF Acklington and became operational on 6 November 1939 flying the Gloster Gladiator. The squadron converted to Spitfires and while based at RAF Warmwell in 1940 they participated in the Battle of Britain defending the southern England sector which included Portland Naval Base. In April 1941, the squadron, now commanded by Derek Boitel-Gill, shifted to Portreath. From here it was engaged in flying protective patrols over shipping convoys and in June, began night-fighting duties.

From mid-November 1942 the squadron took part in the invasion of North Africa in Operation Torch. They continued to operate around the Mediterranean, including from bases in Malta and Sicily, during the invasions of Sicily in Operation Husky and mainland Italy in Operation Avalanche.

On 19 December 1943, under the command of Squadron Leader Mervyn Ingram, 152 Squadron moved to Burma and joined the RAF Third Tactical Air Force (TAF). During the Battle of Imphal, the squadron operated from front-line strips and supported the Fourteenth Army during its final conquest of Burma. It was disbanded on 10 March 1946 in Singapore where it had moved after the Japanese surrender.

===Post-war===
On 8 May 1946, No. 136 Squadron was renumbered No. 152 while in transit to Bombay, and began flying Spitfires in June pending the arrival of its Tempests. By early August it had received these, but spares problems led to its being disbanded on 15 January 1947.

The squadron was reformed at RAF Wattisham on 1 June 1954 as a night fighter unit flying the Meteor NF12 and NF14, until again disbanded at RAF Stradishall on 11 July 1958.

On 1 October 1958, No.152 Squadron was reformed, this time as a transport squadron in the Persian Gulf. It was disbanded on 15 November 1967.

<text>Mohammed Fazal (2 July 1922 – 4 September 2014) was an Indian politician who was the Governor of Maharashtra from 10 October 2002 to 5 December 2004. Born in a well-known &quot;zamindari&quot; (landlord) family, he studied at the Allahabad University and later at the London School of Economics at the University of London. In 1977 he was appointed the Secretary of Industrial Development, Government of India. He was the most senior member of the Planning Commission from April 1980 till his resignation in January 1985. He then founded and was the chairman of Hughes &amp; Hughes Chem Ltd. In 1999, he was appointed the Governor of Goa, a post he held until he was appointed Governor of Maharashtra. He suggested to Chief Minister of Maharashtra Sushilkumar Shinde that prostitution be legalised, which caused controversy.

His grandson Ali Fazal is an actor who had roles in films including &quot;3 Idiots&quot; and &quot;Victoria &amp; Abdul&quot;.

Fazal died on 4 September 2014 at the age of 92 at his residence in Abu Bakrpur, Allahabad. He had been suffering from low blood pressure, congestion in the chest, and short-term memory loss.

<doc id="1007552" wikidata="Q6643111" url="?curid=1007552" title="List of the longest English words with one syllable">
<text>This is a list of candidates for the longest English word of one syllable, i.e. monosyllables with the most letters. A list of 9,123 English monosyllables published in 1957 includes three ten-letter words: &quot;scraunched&quot;, &quot;scroonched&quot;, and &quot;squirreled&quot;. &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; lists &quot;scraunched&quot; and &quot;strengthed&quot;. Other sources include words as long or longer. Some candidates are questionable on grounds of spelling, pronunciation, or status as obsolete, nonstandard, proper noun, loanword, or nonce word. Thus, the definition of longest English word with one syllable is somewhat subjective, and there is no single unambiguously correct answer.

==List==
==Proper names==
Some nine-letter proper names remain monosyllabic when adding a tenth letter and apostrophe to form the possessive: 
* Laugharne&#x27;s 
* Scoughall&#x27;s 

In his short story, &quot;Strychnine in the Soup&quot;, P. G. Wodehouse had a character whose surname was &quot;Mapledurham&quot;, pronounced &quot;Mum&quot;. This is eleven letters, while &quot;Mapledurham&#x27;s&quot; is twelve.

It is productive in English to convert a (proper) noun into an eponymous verb or adjective:
* A 2007–08 promotion in France used the slogan &quot;Do you Schweppes?&quot;, implying a past tense &quot;Schweppesed&quot; (11 letters) for the putative verb.
* &quot;Schwartzed&quot; (10 letters) has been used to mean &quot;(re)designed in the style of Martha Schwartz&quot;
* &quot;Schwartzed&quot; has also been used to mean &quot;crossed swords with Justice Alan R. Schwartz&quot;
* &quot;Schmertzed&quot; (10 letters) has been used to mean &quot;received undue largesse from New York City through the intervention of negotiator Eric Schmertz&quot;

==Contrived endings==
In a 1970 article in &quot;Word Ways&quot;, Ralph G. Beaman converts past participles ending &quot;-ed&quot; into nouns, allowing regular plurals with &quot;-s&quot;. He lists five verbs in &quot;Webster&#x27;s Third International&quot; generating 10-letter monosyllables &quot;scratcheds&quot;, &quot;screecheds&quot;, &quot;scroungeds&quot;, &quot;squelcheds&quot;, &quot;stretcheds&quot;; from the verb &quot;strength&quot; in &quot;Webster&#x27;s Second International&quot;, he forms the 11-letter &quot;strengtheds&quot;.

The past tense ending &quot;-ed&quot; and the archaic second person singular ending &quot;-st&quot; can be combined into &quot;-edst&quot;; for example &quot;In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul&quot; (). While this ending is usually pronounced as a separate syllable from the verb stem, it may be abbreviated &quot;-&#x27;dst&quot; to indicate elision. Attested examples include &quot;scratch&#x27;dst&quot; and &quot;stretch&#x27;dst&quot;, each of which has one syllable spelled with ten letters plus apostrophe.

<text>Isobel Marion Dorothea Mackellar (1 July 1885 – 14 January 1968) was an Australian poet and fiction writer. Her poem &quot;My Country&quot; is widely known in Australia, especially its second stanza, which begins: &quot;I love a sunburnt country / A land of sweeping plains, / Of ragged mountain ranges, / Of droughts and flooding rains.&quot;

==Life==

The third child and only daughter of physician and parliamentarian Sir Charles Mackellar and his wife Marion Mackellar (née Buckland), the daughter of Thomas Buckland, she was born in the family home &quot;Dunara&quot; at Point Piper, Sydney, Australia in 1885. Mackellar was of the Anglican faith. Her later home was &quot;Cintra&quot; at Darling Point (built in 1882 by John Mackintosh for his son James), and in 1925, she commissioned a summer cottage (in reality a substantial home with colonnaded verandah overlooking Pittwater), &quot;Tarrangaua&quot; at Lovett Bay, an isolated location on Pittwater reachable only by boat (this home is currently the residence of the novelist and author Susan Duncan and her husband, Bob Story, and features prominently in a number of Duncan&#x27;s books). A woman of independent means, she published poetry and other works between 1908 and 1926 and was active in the Sydney literary scene of the 1930s, being involved with the Sydney Publishers, Editors and Novelists Club, the Bush Book Club of New South Wales and the Sydney PEN Centre. In her later years she ceased writing and, suffering poor health, her last eleven years were spent in a nursing home in Randwick where she died in 1968, aged 82. Her memorial service was held at St Mark&#x27;s Anglican Church in Darling Point, and she is buried in Waverley Cemetery, in the eastern suburbs of Sydney.

She built up a personal library of 300 books, mostly on poetry and literature. Many were signed by their authors. She outlived her siblings and died a relatively wealthy woman, leaving an estate valued for probate at $1,580,000.

==Literary works==
Although she was raised in a professional urban family, Mackellar&#x27;s poetry is usually regarded as quintessential bush poetry, inspired by her experience on her brothers&#x27; farms near Gunnedah, in the north-west of New South Wales. Her best-known poem is &quot;My Country&quot;, written at age 19 while overseas in England, and first published in the London &quot;Spectator&quot; in 1908 under the title &quot;Core of My Heart&quot;: the second stanza of this poem is among the best known in Australia. Four volumes of her collected verse were published: &quot;The Closed Door&quot; (published in 1911, contained the first appearance of &quot;My Country&quot;); &quot;The Witch Maid, and Other Verses&quot; (1914); &quot;Dreamharbour&quot; (1923); and &quot;Fancy Dress&quot; (1926). In addition to writing poems, Mackellar also wrote novels, one by herself, &quot;Outlaw&#x27;s Luck&quot; (1913), and at least two in collaboration with childhood friend Ruth Bedford. These are &quot;The Little Blue Devil&quot; (1912) and &quot;Two&#x27;s Company&quot; (1914). According to Dale Spender, little has been written or is yet known about the circumstances behind this collaboration.

==Honours ==
In the New Year&#x27;s Day Honours of 1968, Mackellar was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for her contribution to Australian literature. She died two weeks later in Paddington, New South Wales after a fall. Her memorial service was held at St Mark&#x27;s Anglican Church in Darling Point. She is buried with her father and family in Waverley Cemetery overlooking the open ocean. Her poem &quot;Colour&quot;, her own favourite, was read at the service.

==Legacy==
A federal electorate covering half of Sydney&#x27;s Northern Beaches is named in her honour as well as Mackellar Crescent in the Canberra suburb of Cook.

On Australia Day, 26 January 1983, a memorial to Mackellar was unveiled and dedicated in ANZAC Park, Gunnedah. The centrepiece of the memorial, a statue of Mackellar on horseback by Dennis Adams, was a temporary fibreglass version. The finished bronze version was installed in September 1983. In conjunction with the January unveiling, there was an exhibition of a series of 34 water colour paintings by Jean Isherwood illustrating &quot;My Country&quot;. The watercolours were eventually put on permanent display in the Gunnedah Bicentennial Regional Gallery. Isherwood set about painting a series of oils based on the watercolours which were exhibited at the Artarmon Galleries in Sydney in 1986.

In 1984, Gunnedah resident Mikie Maas created the &quot;Dorothea Mackellar Poetry Awards&quot;, which has grown into a nationwide poetry competition for Australian school students.

<text>The Gate Theatre is a theatre on Cavendish Row in Dublin, Ireland. It was founded in 1928.

==History==
===Beginnings===
The Gate Theatre was founded in 1928 by Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammóir with Daisy Bannard Cogley and Gearóid Ó Lochlainn. During their first season, they presented seven plays, including Ibsen&#x27;s Peer Gynt, O’Neill&#x27;s The Hairy Ape and Wilde&#x27;s Salomé. They offered Dublin audiences an introduction to the world of European and American theatre as well as classics from the modern and Irish repertoire. It was at the Gate that Orson Welles, James Mason, Geraldine Fitzgerald and Michael Gambon began their acting careers.

The company played for two seasons at the Peacock Theatre and then moved to the 18th Century Rotunda Annex - the ‘Upper Concert Hall’, the Gate&#x27;s present home, with Goethe&#x27;s Faust opening on 17 February 1930.

===Lord and Lady Longford===
The newly established Gate Theatre ran into financial difficulties and a meeting was called on 12 December 1930 to announce its closure. In a surprise announcement, Lord Longford offered to buy up the remaining shares, valued at £1,200 and the theatre was saved. Longford and his wife Lady (Christine) Longford worked with Edwards and MacLiammóir at the Gate until 1936, when a split occurred and two separate companies were formed which played at the Gate for six months each. The companies also toured for six months until the death of Lord Longford in 1961.

During this period Edwards and MacLiammóir (Gate Theatre Productions) performed in Dublin&#x27;s Gaiety Theatre and toured productions to Europe, Egypt and North America.

===1980s–2000s===
From the 1980s onwards the Gate, under the directorship of Michael Colgan, cemented its international relationship, touring plays around the world for audiences from Beijing to New York. The theatre established relationships with contemporary playwrights including Samuel Beckett, Harold Pinter and Brian Friel. In 1991 the first-ever Beckett Festival was produced, presenting all 19 stage plays over three weeks. The first-ever festival of Pinter&#x27;s plays followed, along with many premieres and productions of Friel&#x27;s work including the production of &quot;Faith Healer&quot; with Ralph Fiennes which won a Tony Award on Broadway. Among other firsts was the production of Chekhov&#x27;s Three Sisters in a new version by Frank McGuinness with three real sisters, the award-winning Sinéad, Sorcha and Niamh Cusack. The production also featured the veteran star of Irish theatre and father of the three actresses, Cyril Cusack and the Oscar-nominated actress Lesley Manville. The production opened in March 1990 and transferred to the Royal Court Theatre in London later that year.

With the support of funders, the fabric of the building was restored and renovated under the guidance of Ronnie Tallon and Scott, Tallon Walker Architects. This included the provision of a new wing, which incorporated a studio space – The Gate Studio – for rehearsals and workshops.

== Wheelchair accessibility ==
The Gate Theatre is an old building having been completed around 1791. It was not designed with wheelchair access as a priority. There is a wheelchair lift at the back of the building.

<text>Commandments is a 1997 American romantic comedy drama film written and directed by Daniel Taplitz, and starring Aidan Quinn, Courteney Cox and Anthony LaPaglia.

==Plot==
Ever since Seth Warner&#x27;s (Aidan Quinn) wife died two years ago, his life has gone to pieces. In his rage, he affronts God who seemingly responds by stopping his suicide attempt and his screaming at God above by crippling his dog and putting Seth in the hospital. So Seth sets out to break all the Ten Commandments. Moving in with his sister-in-law, Rachel (Courteney Cox), and her reporter-husband, Harry (Anthony LaPaglia), he systematically starts breaking each of the commandments, increasingly aided by Harry and Rachel. When Rachel finds out Harry has been having an affair, she responds by having an affair with Seth. Seth then steals all of Harry&#x27;s personally autographed guitars and pawns them, subsequently lying to the police that it was part of an insurance scam and Harry was in on it. Harry loses his job and finds out Rachel is pregnant with Seth&#x27;s baby. Seth attempts to kill himself but is swallowed by a whale and the belly is cut open and Seth is released. Rachel decides to marry Seth and raise the baby with him. Harry stands on top of a building with Seth&#x27;s crippled dog the same way Seth did before and asks for a sign from God. Perhaps to be saved like Seth was.

==Critical reception==
The film has received negative reviews, with a 24% &quot;rotten&quot; rating by the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 17 reviews.

<text>Russell Loris Arlett (January 3, 1899 – May 16, 1964), also known as Buzz Arlett, was an American baseball player, sometimes called &quot;the Babe Ruth of the minor leagues.&quot; Like Ruth, Arlett was a large man, and , who began his career as a pitcher before becoming his league&#x27;s dominant home run hitter. He was for many decades the all-time minor league home run king in the United States, until being surpassed by Mike Hessman on August 3, 2015. He spent one season with the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball (MLB).

==Early life==
Arlett was the youngest of four sons (Alexander, Harry, Leslie &quot;Dick&quot;, and Russell) born to German immigrant Beny and his English wife Lillian. He also had a sister Evelyn. During their youth, the Arlett brothers would often play baseball from sunrise till sundown.

==Professional career==
In 1918, Arlett began his professional career by joining his brother (Alexander &quot;Pop&quot; Arlett) on the staff of the Pacific Coast League&#x27;s Oakland Oaks as a right-handed spitball pitcher. He received his nickname &quot;Buzz&quot; because he was known to cut through opposing batters like a buzz saw. He won 108 games as a pitcher.

In 1923, Arlett became a full-time outfielder. As a batter, Arlett was the best slugger of the Pacific Coast League, often leading the league in batting statistics and setting several records. In his 13 years in the PCL, Arlett set league records with 251 home runs and 1135 runs batted in (RBIs).

In 1929 (considered to be his best season as a batter), Arlett hit 39 home runs, earned a .374 batting average and drove in 189 runs. He played only for the Oakland Oaks until the 1930 season.

On January 26, 1931, the Philadelphia Phillies purchased Arlett&#x27;s contract from Oakland. Arlett played the entire 1931 season for Philadelphia and it was his only MLB season. Already 32 years old, Arlett had an impressive season as a hitter but was regarded as a poor fielder. Although Arlett began his career at about 185 pounds, he had gained approximately 50 pounds during his career and had become a sluggish fielder. He was used in 94 games as an outfielder and only 13 as a first baseman. Although he compiled a .313 batting average and hit 18 home runs — fourth in the National League — his lackluster fielding led the Phillies to use him as a pinch-hitter for much of the season.

In 1932, Philadelphia sold Arlett&#x27;s contract to the Baltimore Orioles of the International League. Playing for the Orioles in 1932, Arlett twice hit four home runs in a single game. On June 2, 1932, he hit home runs in consecutive at bats against the team from Reading, Pennsylvania. He repeated the feat on July 4, 1932, again against Reading, hitting a grand slam batting right-handed and three more home runs batting left-handed. He led the league that year with 54 home runs and 144 runs batted in. Arlett&#x27;s record of 54 home runs in 1932 is the second-highest annual total in International League history, and through the 2003 season no International League batter has equalled or surpassed Arlett&#x27;s 54 home runs.

In 1933, Arlett led the league again with 39 home runs for the Orioles. In 1934, Arlett briefly started the season with the Birmingham Barons and then moved to the Minneapolis Millers of the American Association. During his season with the Millers, he hit 41 home runs that year with 132 runs batted in and earned a .319 batting average.

In 1935, he raised his batting average to .360 hitting 25 home runs and driving in 101 runs. In 1936, Arlett hit .316, but was limited to 193 at bats. In 1937, Arlett played briefly for the Syracuse Chiefs, but then retired. He returned to Minneapolis to settle with his family.

Arlett finished his career as the all-time minor league home run and RBI leader with career totals of 432 home runs and 1786 runs batted in. He now ranks second in both categories among all minor-league players. (He was surpassed by Héctor Espino for home runs and Nick Cullop for RBIs.) In his career as a minor-league player, Arlett earned a .341 batting average and a .604 slugging percentage. Arlett retired with a 108–93 record and a 3.42 earned run average as a minor-league pitcher.

==Personal life==
In 1927, Arlett married his first wife, Frances. They separated in 1932 and divorced in 1936. They had no children. In court papers, Arlett listed &quot;desertion&quot; as the cause for divorce. In 1936, Arlett married Vivian Johnson, who was secretary to Minneapolis Millers owner Mike Kelly. They had a son and a daughter.

After retiring from baseball, Arlett owned and operated a successful restaurant and bar in Minneapolis called Arlett&#x27;s Place. Arlett&#x27;s Place sponsored its own baseball team where Arlett participated as a player until the early 1940s.

==Death and legacy==
Arlett was inducted into the Pacific Coast League Hall of Fame in 1945.

In 1964, Arlett died of a heart attack in Minneapolis and was interred at Lakewood Cemetery. He was survived by his wife, son, daughter, and his older brothers Harry and Dick. In 1984, the Society for American Baseball Research voted Arlett the most outstanding player in the history of minor league baseball.

<doc id="1007599" wikidata="Q207777" url="?curid=1007599" title="Ussuri">
<text>The Ussuri ( ; ) or Wusuli ( ) is a river that runs through Khabarovsk and Primorsky Krais, Russia and the southeast region of Northeast China. It rises in the Sikhote-Alin mountain range, flowing north and forming part of the Sino-Russian border (which is based on the Sino-Russian Convention of Peking of 1860), until it joins the Amur as a tributary to it near Khabarovsk. It is approximately long. The Ussuri drains the Ussuri basin, which covers . Its waters come from rain (60%), snow (30–35%), and subterranean springs. The average discharge is , and the average elevation is .

==Names==
The Ussuri has been known by many names. In Manchu, it was called the Usuri Ula or Dobi Bira (River of Foxes) and in Mongolian the Üssüri Müren. &quot;Ussuri&quot; is Manchu for &quot;soot-black river&quot;.

==History==
* The Ussuri has a reputation for catastrophic floods. It freezes up in November and stays under the ice until April. The river teems with different kinds of fish: grayling, sturgeon, humpback salmon (&quot;gorbusha&quot;), chum salmon (&quot;keta&quot;), and others.
* During World War II, the river marked one of the boundaries which Soviet forces crossed into Manchuria in Operation August Storm in 1945.
* The Sino-Soviet border conflict of 1969 took place at the Soviet Damansky Island on the Ussuri River.

==Tributaries==
Major tributaries of the Ussuri are, from source to mouth:
*Arsenyevka (left)
*Sungacha (left)
*Muling (left)
*Bolshaya Ussurka (right)
*Bikin (right)
*Naoli (left)
*Khor (right)

<doc id="1007613" wikidata="Q2898260" url="?curid=1007613" title="Bell state">
<text>In quantum information science, the Bell&#x27;s states or EPR pairs are specific quantum states of two qubits that represent the simplest examples of quantum entanglement. The Bell&#x27;s states are a form of entangled and normalized basis vectors. This normalization implies that the overall probability of the particles being in one of the mentioned states is 1: formula_1. Entanglement is a basis-independent result of superposition. Due to this superposition, measurement of the qubit will &quot;collapse&quot; it into one of its basis states with a given probability. Because of the entanglement, measurement of one qubit will &quot;collapse&quot; the other qubit to a state whose measurement will yield one of two possible values, where the value depends on which Bell&#x27;s state the two qubits are in initially. Bell&#x27;s states can be generalized to certain quantum states of multi-qubit systems, such as the GHZ state for three or more subsystems.

Understanding of Bell&#x27;s states is useful in analysis of quantum communication, such as superdense coding and quantum teleportation. These mechanisms cannot transmit information faster than the speed of light, a result known as the no-communication theorem.

==Bell states==
The Bell states are four specific maximally entangled quantum states of two qubits. They are in a superposition of 0 and 1a linear combination of the two states. Their entanglement means the following:

The qubit held by Alice (subscript &quot;A&quot;) can be in a superposition of 0 and 1. If Alice measured her qubit in the standard basis, the outcome would be either 0 or 1, each with probability 1/2; if Bob (subscript &quot;B&quot;) also measured his qubit, the outcome would be the same as for Alice. Thus, Alice and Bob would each seemingly have random outcome. Through communication they would discover that, although their outcomes separately seemed random, these were perfectly correlated.

This perfect correlation at a distance is special: maybe the two particles &quot;agreed&quot; in advance, when the pair was created (before the qubits were separated), which outcome they would show in case of a measurement.

Hence, following Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen in their famous 1935 &quot;EPR paper&quot;, there is something missing in the description of the qubit pair given abovenamely this &quot;agreement&quot;, called more formally a hidden variable. In his famous paper of 1964, John S. Bell showed by simple probability theory arguments that these correlations (the one for the 0, 1 basis and the one for the +, − basis) cannot &quot;both&quot; be made perfect by the use of any &quot;pre-agreement&quot; stored in some hidden variablesbut that quantum mechanics predicts perfect correlations. In a more refined formulation known as the Bell–CHSH inequality, it is shown that a certain correlation measure cannot exceed the value 2 if one assumes that physics respects the constraints of local &quot;hidden-variable&quot; theory (a sort of common-sense formulation of how information is conveyed), but certain systems permitted in quantum mechanics can attain values as high as formula_2. Thus, quantum theory violates the Bell inequality and the idea of local &quot;hidden variables&quot;.

=== Bell basis ===
Four specific two-qubit states with the maximal value of formula_2 are designated as &quot;Bell states&quot;. They are known as the four &quot;maximally entangled two-qubit Bell states&quot; and form a maximally entangled basis, known as the Bell basis, of the four-dimensional Hilbert space for two qubits:
: formula_4
: formula_5
: formula_6
: formula_7

=== Creating Bell states via quantum circuits ===
Although there are many possible ways to create entangled Bell states through quantum circuits, the simplest takes a computational basis as the input, and contains a Hadamard gate and a CNOT gate (see picture). As an example, the pictured quantum circuit takes the two qubit input formula_8 and transforms it to the first Bell state formula_9 Explicitly, the Hadamard gate transforms formula_8 into a superposition of formula_11. This will then act as a control input to the CNOT gate, which only inverts the target (the second qubit) when the control (the first qubit) is 1. Thus, the CNOT gate transforms the second qubit as follows formula_12.

For the four basic two-qubit inputs, formula_13, the circuit outputs the four Bell states (listed above). More generally, the circuit transforms the input in accordance with the equation

formula_14.

In this example, Alice is trying to communicate two bits of classical information, one of four two bit strings: formula_15or formula_16. If Alice chooses to send the two bit message formula_17, she would perform the formula_18 gate to her qubit. Similarly, if Alice wants to send formula_19, she would apply the phase flip formula_20; if she wanted to send formula_16, she would apply the formula_22gate to her qubit; and finally, if Alice wanted to send the two bit message formula_23, she would do nothing to her qubit. Alice performs these quantum gate transformations locally, transforming the initial entangled state formula_24 into one of the four Bell states.

The steps below show the necessary quantum gate transformations, and resulting Bell states, that Alice needs to apply to her qubit for each possible two bit message she desires to send to Bob.

formula_25

formula_26

formula_27 

formula_28.

After Alice applies the desired transformations to her qubit, she sends it to Bob. Bob then performs a measurement on the Bell state, which projects the entangled state onto one of the four two-qubit basis vectors, one of which will coincide with the original two bit message Alice was trying to send.

=== Quantum teleportation ===

Quantum teleportation is the transfer of a quantum state over a distance. It is facilitated by entanglement between A, the giver, and B, the receiver of this quantum state. This process has become a fundamental research topic for quantum communication and computing. More recently, scientists have been testing its applications in information transfer through optical fibers. The process of quantum teleportation is defined as the following:

Alice and Bob share an EPR pair and each took one qubit before they became separated. Alice must deliver a qubit of information to Bob, but she does not know the state of this qubit and can only send classical information to Bob.

It is performed step by step as the following:

# Alice sends her qubits through a CNOT gate.
# Alice then sends the first qubit through a Hadamard gate.
# Alice measures her qubits, obtaining one of four results, and sends this information to Bob.
# Given Alice&#x27;s measurements, Bob performs one of four operations on his half of the EPR pair and recovers the original quantum state.

The following quantum circuit describes teleportation:
=== Quantum cryptography ===
Quantum cryptography is the use of quantum mechanical properties in order to encode and send information safely. The theory behind this process is the fact that it is impossible to measure a quantum state of a system without disturbing the system. This can be used to detect eavesdropping within a system.

The most common form of quantum cryptography is quantum key distribution. It enables two parties to produce a shared random secret key that can be used to encrypt messages. Its private key is created between the two parties through a public channel.

Quantum cryptography can be considered a state of entanglement between two multi-dimensional systems, also known as two-qudit (quantum digit) entanglement.

<doc id="1007621" wikidata="Q7197847" url="?curid=1007621" title="Pirate utopia">
<text>Pirate utopias were defined by anarchist writer Peter Lamborn Wilson, who coined the term in his 1995 book &quot;Pirate Utopias: Moorish Corsairs &amp; European Renegadoes&quot;, as secret islands once used for supply purposes by pirates. Wilson&#x27;s concept is largely based on speculation, although he admits to adding a bit of fantasy to the idea. In Wilson&#x27;s view, these pirate enclaves were early forms of autonomous proto-anarchist societies in that they operated beyond the reach of governments and embraced unrestricted freedom.

== On the Barbary Coast ==
Located on the Barbary Coast (Salé, Algiers, and Tunis), these bases were havens for renegade Muslim pirates from the 16th to the 18th century. The pirates, dubbed &quot;Barbary Corsairs&quot;, ravaged European shipping operations and enslaved many thousands of captives. Wilson focuses on the Pirate Republic of Salé, in 17th-century Morocco, which may have had its own lingua franca. Like some other pirate states, it even used to pass treaties from time to time with some European countries, agreeing not to attack their fleets. Wilson/Bey&#x27;s idea of Temporary Autonomous Zones developed from his historical review of pirate utopias. In describing them, Wilson has said:

== Connection to Islam ==
Wilson writes about the large influx of Europeans converting to Islam, forming the &quot;Renegados&quot; and joining the pirate holy war. He then takes an interesting approach regarding 17th century Europeans and their opposition to Islam. He asks if Europeans were opposed to Islam or if Islam had a &quot;positive shadow&quot; that made it so attractive for pirates? Was there something that was intriguing to a pirate about Islam, or was there a change in belief that many Europeans experienced? Wilson goes on to write that these men and women were not only apostates and traitors, as they were considered in their homelands, but their voluntary betrayal of Christendom can also be thought of as a praxis of social resistance.

==Libertatia==

Libertatia, also known as Libertalia, was a possibly fictional anarchist colony founded in the late 17th century in Madagascar by pirates under the leadership of Captain James Misson. Whether or not Libertatia actually existed is disputed. Captain Charles Johnson describes Libertatia in his book &quot;A General History of the Pyrates&quot;. Much of the book is a mixture of fact and fiction, and it is possible the account of Libertatia is entirely fabricated. According to Johnson&#x27;s description, Libertatia lasted for about 25 years. The precise location is not known; however, most sources say it stretched from the Bay of Antongil to Mananjary, including Île Sainte Marie and Foulpointe. Thomas Tew, Misson, and an Italian Dominican priest named Caraccioli were involved in founding it.

== In literature and popular culture ==
&quot;Cities of the Red Night&quot;, a novel by American author William S. Burroughs, revolves around a group of radical pirates who seek the freedom to live under the articles set out by Captain James Misson. The attempted establishment of a Republic of Pirates is a significant plot element in the Ubisoft video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed IV: Black Flag&quot;. In the movie &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean 3: At World&#x27;s End&quot; the main characters gather at &quot;Shipwreck Cove&quot;, a city built out of wrecked ships and constructed platforms.

The TV series &quot;Black Sails&quot; is largely based on the historical pirate inhabitants of Nassau, as well as characters based on Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s novel &quot;Treasure Island&quot;. Libertalia is also a central plot element and setting in the video game &quot;Uncharted 4: A Thief&#x27;s End&quot;; however, in this interpretation, Libertalia was founded by the pirate Henry Avery and others including Tew, Anne Bonny, and Edward England.

The 2015 video game &quot;Fallout 4&quot; features an area in the game called &quot;Libertalia&quot;. The area is a series of off-shore platforms (made of various debris) that has become home to a large gang of raiders. British Author Warren Ellis writes in Bruce Sterling&#x27;s book &quot;Pirate Utopia&quot; about Libertalia and the objections against its existence.

<text>James Mabbe or Mab (1572–1642) was an English scholar, translator, and poet, and a Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford. He was involved in translations from Spanish, notably of the Picaresque novel by Mateo Alemán, &quot;Guzmán de Alfarache&quot;, in 1622. He also translated some of the &quot;Novelas ejemplares&quot; of Miguel de Cervantes and, in 1631, &quot;Celestina, or the Tragicomedy of Calisto and Melibea,&quot; a 300-page play, or &quot;novel in dialogue,&quot; by Fernando de Rojas, under the title &quot;The Spanish Bawd&quot;.

James Mabbe may also be the &quot;I. M.&quot; who wrote the fourth commendatory verse to the First Folio of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays (1623), given that his friend and colleague Leonard Digges wrote the third.

<text>Takapau is a small rural community in the Central Hawkes Bay in New Zealand. It is located 20 kilometres west of Waipukurau, off State Highway 2, and has a population of more than 500.

The original township was founded in 1876 by farmer Sydney Johnston from Oruawharo station. Johnston&#x27;s family donated land for a school and churches, and built the local library, public hall and, later, Plunket rooms. Many streets are named after members of the family.

Takapau was once the centre of a large flax milling industry, and the community takes its name from the flax that grew in the expansive Takapau plains. The Māori word translates literally as &quot;mat&quot; or &quot;carpet&quot;.

The largest business in Takapau is now the Silverfern Farms meat-processing plant, founded by the Hawke&#x27;s Bay Farmers’ Meat Company in 1981. Kintail Honey, one of country&#x27;s largest honey-packing and beekeeping operations, is also based in the town.

There are two schools in Takapau. The Trappist monastery, the Southern Star Abbey, is also located nearby.

== Railway station ==

Takapau had a railway station from 12 March 1877 to 27 September 1981. It was the terminus of the line from Spit for 10 months, until 25 January 1878, when the extension to Kopua opened. Takapau at that time was on the northern edge of the Seventy Mile Bush.

Edmund Allan and Samuel Kingstreet had a £14,100 contract to build the extension of the Napier to Waipukurau railway south to Takapau. They built a 5th class station in 1875 and Donald McLeod, a Waipukurau carpenter, built a goods shed and platform in 1877. Initially, only one train a day ran from Takapau. In 1890 there were two trains a day. There was a post office at the station from 1887 to 1911. By 1896 there were x and x goods sheds and also a cart approach, loading bank, cattle yards, stationmaster&#x27;s house, urinals and a passing loop for 24 wagons, extended to 55 in 1911 and further extended in 1940. In 1905 a verandah was added and the platform extended. Electric lights were installed in 1921. Railway houses were built in 1928 and 1946.

On 27 September 1981 the old station closed and a new station and loop line opened near Oruawharo, to the east. The loop is still in use, with sidings linking to the Silver Fern Farms works and a platform and shelter remain, which appear weed-grown in a 2015 photo. There has been no regular passenger train since at least 1995. There is now only a single line passing through the original Takapau station site.

There was also a passing loop at Whenuahou, south of Takapau, which was originally used for construction of the viaduct to the south.

<text>Claudio Suárez Sánchez (; born 17 December 1968) is a Mexican former professional footballer who played as a centre-back.

==Club career==
Born in Texcoco, State of Mexico and nicknamed &quot;El Emperador&quot; (&quot;The Emperor&quot;), Suárez began his club career with UNAM, where he played from 1988 to 1996 where he became champion in 1991. He moved to Guadalajara as an important piece for the 1996 Apertura, and remained there for 3 years, through the 1999 Clausura where he became champion in the Verano 1997 tournament, and was called to the 1998 FIFA World Cup. After being in the All Mexican Team, as an important and solid defender he was transferred to Tigres.

Suárez then moved on to Tigres UANL, where he played from 1999 to the end of 2005. He led the team&#x27;s defense during that time, and was league runner-up twice, in 2001 and 2003. His last game with Tigres, and in the Mexico league, was a semi-final Clásico Regiomontano in which he was sent off in a controversial referee decision. Previous to this incident, he already had disagreements with the team&#x27;s management. Tigre&#x27;s directive organization had asked Suarez to retire for years and join the management, but Suarez had refused. Other differences in defensive style were also cause for conflict with the team&#x27;s management. The semi-final was the last excuse for separation.

In 2006, he moved to Major League Soccer to play for Chivas USA.

On 8 March 2009, after negotiations with his contract fell, Suarez announced his retirement. However, on 20 March 2009, he decided to return to professional soccer for another year. He was the last active soccer player left from Mexico&#x27;s 1994 FIFA World Cup squad until he announced his retirement on 26 March 2010.

On 5 September 2010, Suárez came out of retirement to play for the Carolina Railhawks in an exhibition game with the Pumas Morelos.

==International career==
Suárez was a member and starter for the senior national team in the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States as well as the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France. He missed 2002 FIFA World Cup due to injury before the tournament began, but was picked to go to the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany. This FIFA World Cup meant his third World Cup in his career. Despite being picked for the squad he saw no action, but he did wear his legendary number 2 jersey.

He captained the national team for many years and officially represented Mexico 177 times (178 in Mexican record keeping) making him the 2nd player with the most caps in history for the Mexico national football team.

On 25 March 2007, Suárez along with former national team and Chivas USA teammate Ramón Ramírez were honored in a friendly against Paraguay at Estadio Universitario.

He was selected as one of 3 overage players on the Mexico Olympic team at the 1996 Summer Olympics.

==Personal life==
Suárez currently resides in Southern California with his wife and three children, and works as a commentator for Fox Deportes.

<text>Frederick Robert Higgins (24 April 1896 – 6 January 1941) was an Irish poet and theatre director.

==Early years==
Higgins was born on the west coast of Ireland in Foxford, which is located in County Mayo. He was the eldest son of Joseph and Annie Higgins: his poem &quot;Father and Son&quot; is a loving tribute to his father. Joseph, a policeman, was stationed in Foxford at the time of his son&#x27;s birth. He grew up in Ballivor in County Meath, (&quot;our most lovely Meath&quot; as he described it), where his family had farmed for several generations. He also spent time living in Dublin and attend Saint Columba&#x27;s National School by North Strand Church. He spent the largest part of his adult life in Dublin, in a house he had built beside the River Dodder in Rathfarnham. His health was poor, and though his friends were inclined to regard him as a hypochondriac, his frequent predictions that he would die young proved to be accurate. He married Beatrice May Moore in 1921. The marriage was a happy one: even Frank O&#x27;Connor, who disliked him, praised him as a kind and considerate husband. He was however reputed to have had a number of affairs, notably with the actress Ria Mooney.

==Career==
Higgins was a student of William Butler Yeats and served on the board of the Abbey Theatre from 1935 until his death. His best-known book of poetry is &quot;The Gap of Brightness&quot; (1940). 
He is also well known for his poem, &quot;Father and Son.&quot; He wrote a moving elegy for his fellow poet Pádraic Ó Conaire. He was generally acknowledged to be a fine poet, but was less successful in his Abbey Theatre work: Frank O&#x27;Connor said unkindly that Higgins could not direct a children&#x27;s poetry recitation. He died suddenly of a heart attack in January 1941.

In 1937 he was tour manager of the Abbey Theatre production of Teresa Deevy&#x27;s &quot;Katie Roche&quot; which toured to the Ambassador Theatre (New York City), USA. There were five performances from 2 to 6 October. His Abbey career can be seen in the Abbey Theatre archives.

== Character ==
He was a popular and convivial man: even Frank O&#x27;Connor, who came to regard him with deep suspicion, admitted that he was a delightful person to know. His circle of friends included many of the leading Irish literary figures of his time, including Yeats, Padraic O Conaire, George William Russell, Lennox Robinson, and for a time Frank O&#x27;Connor. O&#x27;Connor however came to regard Higgins as untrustworthy and a troublemaker, and describes him unflatteringly in his memoir &quot;My Father&#x27;s Son&quot;. For Yeats, Higgins seems to have felt a genuine affection, once remarking that he never left Yeats&#x27; house without &quot;feeling like a thousand dollars&quot;. He was also capable of great kindness and generosity to younger writers like Patrick Kavanagh.

==Bibliography==
His five collections of poems are:
*&quot;Salt Air&quot; (1923)
*&quot;Island Blood&quot; (1925)
*&quot;The Dark Breed&quot; (1927)
*&quot;Arable Holdings&quot; (1933)
*&quot;The Gap of Brightness&quot; (1940)

== Plays ==
* &quot;Katie Roche&quot; (1937) - (Tour Manager)

It has short claws that do not extend beyond the pads of its webbed digits. With a total body length of , and a maximum weight of , it is the smallest otter species.

The Asian small-clawed otter lives in riverine habitats, freshwater wetlands and mangrove swamps. It feeds on molluscs, crabs and other small aquatic animals. It lives in pairs, but was also observed in family groups with up to 12 individuals.

It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, and is threatened by habitat loss, pollution, and in some areas also by hunting.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Lutra cinerea&quot; was the scientific name proposed by Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger in 1815 for an otter collected in Batavia. In the 19th and 20th centuries, several zoological specimens were described:
*&quot;Lutra concolor&quot; proposed by Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1832 was a uniform coloured otter from Assam. Rafinesque also proposed &quot;Amblonyx&quot; as name for a subgenus for otters with short, obtuse claws.
*&quot;Lutra leptonyx&quot; proposed by Thomas Horsfield in 1824 were two adult small-clawed otters collected in Java. It was subordinated to the genus &quot;Aonyx&quot; by John Edward Gray in 1843.
*&quot;Amblonyx cinerea nirnai&quot; proposed by Reginald Innes Pocock in 1940 was a dark brown small-clawed otter from Virajpet in South India.

=== Phylogeny ===
Results of a mitochondrial cytochrome B analysis published in 1998 indicated that it should be subordinated to the genus &quot;Aonyx&quot;. Results of a molecular study published in 2008 showed that the Asian small-clawed otter is a sister taxon of &quot;Lutrogale&quot;, lending support to retaining the genus &quot;Amblonyx&quot; or expanding &quot;Aonyx&quot; to make it monophyletic. They genetically diverged about .

The Asian small-clawed otter groups with the African clawless otter (&quot;Aonyx capensis&quot;) and the smooth-coated otter (&quot;Lutrogale perspicillata&quot;) into a sister clade with the genus &quot;Lutra&quot;. Hybridisation of Asian small-clawed otter females with smooth-coated otter males occurred in Singapore. The resulting offspring and their descendants bred back into the smooth-coated otter population, but maintained the genes of their small-clawed otter ancestors; a population of at least 60 hybrid otters are present in Singapore as of 2016.

== Characteristics==

The Asian small-clawed otter has deep brown fur with some rufous tinge on the back, but paler below. Its underfur is lighter near the base. The sides of the neck and head are brown, but its cheeks, upperlip, chin, throat and sides of the neck are whitish.
Its skull is short, and the naked rhinarium rounded above. The muzzle has long coarse vibrissae on either side. Its eyes are located toward the front of the head. The small ears are oval-shaped with an inconspicuous tragus and antitragus. Its paws are narrow with short digits that are webbed to the last joint. There are short hairs on the lower sides of the interdigital webs. The four-lobed plantar pads are longer than wide. The claws are short, almost erect, and in some individuals even absent.
Females have four mammary glands.

The Asian small-clawed otter is the smallest otter species in Asia. In head-to-body length, it ranges from with a long tail. The tapering tail is thick and muscular, especially at the base, and more than half the length of the body. Hind feet are long. Length of skull ranges from . It does not have upper premolars and only four cheek teeth above.
Adult captive otters range in weight from .

== Distribution and habitat==
The Asian small-clawed otter&#x27;s native range comprises parts of India to Southeast Asia including the islands of Sumatra, Java, Borneo and Palawan. It lives in freshwater wetlands such as swamps, meandering rivers, irrigated rice fields as well as estuaries, coastal lagoons and tidal pools. It occurs in West Bengal, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, and in coastal regions of Odisha. In Karnataka, Nilgiri and Palni hills in Tamil Nadu, it lives in shallow mountain creeks up to an elevation of .
In West Java, it inhabits areas along slow-flowing irrigation channels, pond areas and rice fields surrounded by vegetation that offers shelter. It also occurs in mangrove forests. In February 2025, the otter was confirmed to have returned to Nepal, after it was sighted in Makalu Barun National Park, for the first time in 185 years.

In the 1980s, a few Asian small-clawed otters escaped from captivity in England and established a population in the wild. There are no records of the species after the 1990s, and it is presumed to have been driven out by the recovery of the native Eurasian otter.

== Behaviour and ecology ==

The Asian small-clawed otter is mostly active after dark.
It lives in groups of up to 15 individuals. In the Bangladesh Sundarbans, 53 individuals were recorded in of water courses in 13 locations between November 2014 and March 2015. Group size ranged from one to 12 individuals.
Group members communicate using 12 or more distinct calls, and utter a variety of yelps and whimpers. When disturbed, they scream to rally the help of others.

When swimming on the surface, otters row with the forelimbs and paddle with the hind limbs. When diving under water, they undulate their bodies and tails. Captive otters swim at speeds of .

Observations of wild Asian small-clawed otters revealed that they smear their spraint at latrine sites, using their hind feet and tails. Large groups smeared more than groups of three or fewer animals. The frequency of latrines with smeared scats varied in different locations, indicating a preference for certain sites. Spraint smearing most likely facilitates social ties among group members and is associated with territorial marking displays. They use grassy or sandy banks for resting, sun bathing and grooming. In marshes, they use mostly islands.

=== Diet ===

The Asian small-clawed otter feeds mainly on crabs, mudskippers and &quot;Trichogaster&quot; fish. Its diet varies seasonally. When and where available, it also catches snakes, frogs, insects, rats and ricefield fish like catfish, &quot;Anabas testudineus&quot; and &quot;Channa striata&quot;.
The size of crabs found in spraints in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary ranged in carapace width from .
Captive Asian small-clawed otters were observed to leave shellfish in the sun so the heat causes them to open, making it possible for them to eat them without having to crush the shells.

=== Reproduction ===

Information about the Asian small-clawed otter&#x27;s mating and breeding behaviour has been studied in captive environments. Captive pairs are monogamous. The estrous cycle of females lasts 28 to 30 days with estrus lasting between one and 13 days. Usually, mating takes place in the water.
Gestation lasts 62 to 86 days. Interval between births is at least eight months.
About two weeks before parturition, both female and male engage in building a nest. They collect grass, hay or straw and carry this material into the breeding chamber. Between one and seven pups are born in a litter. Pups are born with closed eyes, which open in the fifth week.
Newborn pups weigh between and reach a weight of after 60 days. They start exploring the environs of the breeding den at the age of ten weeks. At about three months, they enter and paddle in shallow water under the guidance of the mother. They become independent at the age of four to five months.

== Threats ==
The Asian small-clawed otter is threatened by poaching for its fur, loss and destruction of habitats such as hill streams, peat swamp forests and mangroves for aquaculture projects. Threats in India include deforestation, conversion of natural habitat for tea and coffee plantations, overfishing of rivers and water pollution through pesticides.

It is the most sought after otter species for the illegal pet trade in Asia. At least 711 Asian small-clawed otters were offered for sale through online websites by 280 traders in Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam between 2016 and 2017.
Between December 2015 and October 2018, 49 Asian small-clawed otters were confiscated from wildlife traffickers in Thailand, Vietnam and Japan; 35 of them were bound for sale in Japan.

== Conservation ==

The Asian small-clawed otter was listed on CITES Appendix II and is protected in almost all range countries prohibiting its killing. Since August 2019, it is included in CITES Appendix I, thus strengthening its protection in regards to international trade.

=== In captivity ===
The Association of Zoos and Aquariums established a Species Survival Plan for the Asian small-clawed otter in 1983 to encourage research on captive breeding.

In Europe, Zoo Basel keeps Asian small-clawed otters together with Indian rhinoceros.

Asian small-clawed otters with osteoporosis display resorption of hyperactive bone and cartilage by osteoclasts in many bone sites, which causes pockmarks on all the bones.

<doc id="1007642" wikidata="Q7777619" url="?curid=1007642" title="Thebes tablets">
<text>The Thebes tablets, with inscriptions in Mycenaean Greek using Linear B, were discovered in Thebes, Greece. They belong to the Late Helladic IIIB context, contemporary with finds at Pylos. A first group of 21 fragments was found in the 1963–64 campaign; A further 19 tablets were found in 1970 and 1972. Using Near Eastern cylinder seals associated with the finds, the editors of the published corpus of the whole archive now date the destruction of the &quot;Kadmeion&quot;, the Mycenaean palace complex at Thebes, and thus the writing of the tablets, some of which were still damp when they were unintentionally fired, to shortly after 1225 BC. Chadwick identified three recognizable Hellenic divinities, Hera, Hermes and Potnia &quot;Mistress&quot;, among the recipients of wool. He made out a case for &quot;ko-ma-we-te-ja&quot;, also attested at Pylos, as the name of a goddess.

Quite early, before the more recent discoveries, Frederick Ahl made the provocative suggestion concerning the &quot;Phoenician&quot; or &quot;palm-leaf&quot; (&quot;phoinix&quot;) letters: &quot;Cadmus did bring writing to Thebes, but this writing was not the Phoenician alphabet, but Linear B&quot;.

== Discovery ==
A substantial additional portion, some 250 tablets, amounting roughly to 5% of the entire Mycenaean corpus from all sites, was discovered in Pelopidou Street and the &quot;Arsenal&quot; by Vassilis L. Aravantinos, the current archaeological superintendent of Thebes, from 1993 to 1995, in a rescue excavation. In 1996, a few more tablets were identified in a museum among finds from the 1963–1964 dig in Thebes.

The number of &quot;tablets&quot; given by the editors is actually misleading. For example, as Tom Palaima and Sarah James have independently demonstrated, the &quot;123 tablets&quot; of the Fq series actually are many fragments of texts that originally made up between 15 and 18 tablets.

== Publication ==
The Belgian and Italian professors and philologists Louis Godart and Anna Sacconi were charged with the publication of these tablets. During the following years, their preliminary glimpses of the contents suggested that the new tablets could reveal a new view of Mycenaean religion when the tablets were published in 2001, the effect of their overall content was perceived disappointing by some scholars 

== Findings ==
Many of the Thebes tablets can be read as containing information on divinities and religious rites; others mention quantities of various commodities. By the sites mentioned, the boundaries of the region controlled by the Theban palace can be estimated: the Theban palace controlled the island of Euboea and had a harbour in Aulis. The tablets contain a number of important terms previously unattested in Linear B, such as &quot;ra-ke-da-mi-ni-jo&quot; /Lakedaimnijos/ &quot;a man from Lacedaemonia (Sparta)&quot;, or &quot;ma-ka&quot;, which some want to interpret as /Mā Gā/ &quot;Mother Gaia&quot; (a goddess still revered in Thebes in the 5th century BC, as reported, for example, in Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot;); however, this is implausible, because &quot;ma-ka&quot; is a single word, and there are no examples in ca. 5,000 Mycenaean texts of two monosyllabic words being combined into a single lexical unit. Also &quot;ku-na-ki-si&quot; /gunaiksi/ &quot;for women&quot; exhibits the peculiar oblique stem of &quot;woman&quot;.

Vassilis L. Aravantinos, Louis Godart and Anna Sacconi read the tablets to indicate cult activity dedicated to Demeter, Zeus protector of crops, and to Kore, and they speculate that the roots of the Eleusinian Mysteries can be traced back to Mycenaean Thebes. Thomas G. Palaima, however, has criticized their suggestions as &quot;subject to very dubious interpretations&quot; and &quot;highly suspect on linguistic and exegetical grounds&quot;. Other arguments against the identification of cult activity in the texts have been advanced by Sarah James and Yves Duhoux.

Palaima attaches importance to one tablet (Uo 121) as evidence of linking sacrificial animals with foodstuffs at the end of LHIIIB. The same phenomenon, part of ritual Mycenaean feasting, occurs in the contemporary Pylos tablets.

== Vienna symposium ==
The Thebes tablets were discussed at a linguist symposium held in Vienna December 5–6, 2002, the results of which have been published. Günter Neumann (pp. 125–138) argues that the animals in the Thebes tablets are not sacred or &quot;divine&quot; but animals that would naturally be part of everyday life for both Mycenaean and later Greeks. He gathers historical evidence, including references to the animals being fed grains.

Michael Meier-Brügger (pp. 111–118) argues that &quot;de-qo-no&quot; as &quot;master of banqueting&quot; has no clear linguistic origin but could be &quot;deipnon&quot; &quot;main dinner&quot;, as in Homer; that &quot;di-wi-ja-me-ro&quot; may not refer to &quot;the part for the goddess Diwia&quot; but instead a &quot;two-day period&quot; (as also argued earlier by Melena and in the same volume by Killen). Meier-Brügger also argues that &quot;si-to&quot; is not a previously unattested god Sito (Grain) but &quot;siton&quot; &quot;grain&quot;.

José Luis Garcia Ramón (pp. 37–69) argues that, linguistically, &quot;a-ko-ro-da-mo&quot; may not be &quot;agorodamos&quot; &quot;mystic assembler of the people&quot;. He proposes the Greek male name Akrodamos. He believes that &quot;o-po-re-i&quot;, according to Mycenaean usage of gods&#x27; names and epithets, could not mean &quot;Zeus of the Fall Harvest&quot;. Instead, he posits that &quot;o-po-re-i&quot; is a personal name, parallel to another in the Thebes tablets, &quot;me-to-re-i&quot;; the names mean respectively &quot;on the mountain&quot; and &quot;beyond the mountain&quot;.

John T. Killen (pp. 79–110) specifically concludes (p. 103) that &quot;the fact that &quot;ma-ka&quot;, &quot;o-po-re-i&quot;, and &quot;ko-wa&quot; never all occur together, and that it requires a special hypothesis to explain this fact, combined with what I believe are the continuing difficulties with explaining &quot;o-po-re-i&quot; as a theonym /Opo:rehi/, make me reluctant for the present to accept the &quot;ma-ka&quot; = Ma:i Ga:i [i.e., Mother Earth] equation&quot;.

<text>TPG Inc., previously known as Texas Pacific Group and TPG Capital, is an American private equity firm based in Fort Worth, Texas. TPG manages investment funds in growth capital, venture capital, public equity, and debt investments. The firm invests in a range of industries including consumer/retail, media and telecommunications, industrials, technology, travel, leisure, and health care. TPG became a public company in January 2022, trading on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol “TPG”. 

== History and notable investments ==
===Founding and early history===
Texas Pacific Group, later TPG Capital, was founded in 1992 by David Bonderman, James Coulter and William S. Price III. Prior to founding TPG, Bonderman and Coulter had worked for Robert Bass, making leveraged buyout investments during the 1980s.

In 1993, Coulter and Bonderman partnered with GE Capital vice president of strategic planning and business development William S. Price III to complete the buyout of Continental Airlines.

In 1994, TPG, Blum Capital and ACON Investments created Newbridge Capital, a joint-venture to invest in emerging markets, particularly in Asia and, later, in Latin America.

In June 1996, TPG acquired the AT&amp;T Paradyne unit, a multimedia communications business, from Lucent Technologies for $175 million. Also in 1996, TPG invested in Beringer Wine, Ducati Motorcycles and Del Monte Foods.

In 1997, TPG raised over $2.5 billion for its second private equity fund. TPG&#x27;s most notable investment that year was its takeover of the retailer J. Crew, acquiring an 88% stake for approximately $500 million; the investment struggled due to the high purchase price paid relative to the company&#x27;s earnings. The company was able to complete a turnaround, beginning in 2002, and to complete an IPO in 2006.

In 1998, TPG led a minority investment in Oxford Health Plans. TPG and its co-investors invested $350 million in a convertible preferred stock that can be converted into 22.1% of Oxford shareholding. The company completed a buyback of TPG&#x27;s PIPE convertible in 2000, which would ultimately be acquired by UnitedHealth Group, in 2004.

In 1999, TPG invested in Piaggio S.p.A., Bally International (including Bally Shoe), and ON Semiconductor. T3 Partners was started in 2001 to invest alongside the main fund in technology-oriented investments.

===2000–2010===

In 2000 TPG and Leonard Green &amp; Partners invested $200 million to acquire Petco, the pet supplies retailer as part of a $600 million buyout. Within two years they sold most of it in a public offering that valued the company at $1 billion. Petco&#x27;s market value greatly increased by the end of 2004 and the firms would ultimately realize a gain of $1.2 billion. Then, in 2006, the private equity firms took Petco private again for $1.68 billion.

In 2000, TPG completed the controversial acquisition of Gemplus SA, a smart card manufacturer. TPG won a struggle with the company&#x27;s founder, Marc Lassus, for control of the company. Also in 2000, TPG completed an investment in Seagate Technology.

In 2001, TPG acquired Telenor Media, a Norwegian phone-directory company, for $660 million, and shortly thereafter acquired a controlling interest in silicon-wafer maker MEMC Electronic Materials.

In July 2002, TPG, together with Bain Capital and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, announced the $2.3 billion leveraged buyout of Burger King from Diageo. However, in November the original transaction collapsed, when Burger King failed to meet certain performance targets. In December 2002, TPG and its co-investors agreed on a reduced $1.5 billion purchase price for the investment. The TPG consortium had support from Burger King&#x27;s franchisees, which controlled approximately 92% of Burger King restaurants at the time of the transaction. Under its new owners, Burger King underwent a brand overhaul including the use of The Burger King character in advertising. In February 2006, Burger King announced plans for an initial public offering.

In November 2003, TPG provided a proposal to buy Portland General Electric from Enron. However, concerns about debt led to Oregon Public Utility Commission regulators to deny permission for the purchase on March 10, 2005.

TPG entered the film production business in late 2004, in the major leveraged buyout of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. A consortium led by TPG and Sony completed the $4.81 billion buyout of the film studio. The consortium also included media-focused firms Providence Equity Partners and Quadrangle Group, as well as DLJ Merchant Banking Partners. The transaction was announced in September 2004, and completed in early 2005.

Also in 2005, TPG was involved in the buyout of SunGard in a transaction valued at $11.3 billion. TPG&#x27;s partners in the acquisition were Silver Lake Partners, Bain Capital, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Providence Equity Partners, and Blackstone Group. This represented the largest leveraged buyout completed since the takeover of RJR Nabisco at the end of the 1980s leveraged buyout boom. At the time of its announcement, SunGard would be the largest buyout of a technology company in history, a distinction later ceded to the buyout of Freescale Semiconductor. The involvement of seven firms in the consortium was criticized by investors in private equity who considered cross-holdings among firms to be generally unattractive.

On May 15, 2006, Smurfit-Stone reported the definitive sale for $1.04 billion in cash of its consumer packaging division to the Texas Pacific Group.

In early 2006, as TPG was completing fundraising for its fifth private equity fund, co-founder Bill Price announced that he would reduce his work at the firm.

On December 1, 2006, it was announced TPG and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts had been exploring the possibility of a $100 billion leveraged buyout of Home Depot.

In early 2007, the firm officially changed its name to TPG, rebranding all of its funds across different geographies.

In August 2007, Midwest Air Group, parent company of Midwest Airlines, signed a definitive merger agreement to be acquired by an affiliate of TPG Capital in a transaction valued at approximately $450 million.

On April 7, 2008, TPG led a $7 billion investment in Washington Mutual. On September 25, 2008, Washington Mutual was taken over by the U.S. government, costing TPG a $1.35 billion investment. It has been called by some analysts &quot;the worst deal in private equity history.&quot;

On October 31, 2008, TPG completed the purchase of a 35% interest in P.T. Bumi Resources, from its previous owner Bakrie &amp; Brothers, Indonesia, for $1.3 billion.

In June 2009, Republic Airways Holdings Inc., a provider of regional flights for larger carriers, agreed to buy Midwest Airlines from TPG Capital.

On March 12, 2010, Gretchen Morgenson, in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, discussed TPG&#x27;s role as a private equity investor in Greek mobile phone operator WIND Hellas, formerly TIM Hellas, which filed for bankruptcy protection late 2009. Morgenson raised questions about the circumstances in which TPG and fellow private equity investors Apax Partners of London redeemed a significant quantity of &quot;convertible preferred equity certificates&quot; held by them to repay their own &quot;deeply subordinated shareholder loans&quot; during a period in which a significant and apparently unexplained spike occurred in the market value of the certificates.

===2010–2020===
On June 10, 2010, TPG announced an acquisition of Vertafore, a provider of software for the insurance industry, for $1.4 billion.

On July 13, 2011, affiliates of TPG Capital acquired PRIMEDIA for approximately $525 million, or $7.10 per share in cash. TPG and fellow private equity firm Apollo Global Management are set to IPO their stake in Norwegian Cruise Lines in 2013.

In July 2013, TPG announced it would buy global education publisher TSL Education, later TES Global, publishers of TES magazine) from Charterhouse Group, for a fee of around $600 million.

TPG and movie producer Robert Simonds, Jr., announced in March 2014 that they had entered a partnership with China&#x27;s Hony Capital to produce up to 10 &quot;star-driven&quot; films a year, with mid-range budgets of about $40 million per film.

In April 2014, it was announced that TPG had invested £200 million in Victoria Plumb after buying a majority stake. In November 2014, Prezzo Holdings agreed to a £303.7 million takeover by TPG.

In the first half of 2014, the company started to raise funds for a real-estate specific fund. It had a goal of $1.5 billion to $2 billion. By October 2015, the company had exceeded its goal, raising more than $2 billion.

In 2016, TPG partnered with Bono and Jeff Skoll to launch The Rise Fund, a social impact investment fund.

On January 25, 2017, TPG announced that after a nearly two-year search, it had hired Bradford Berenson as its general counsel. Berenson had been vice president and senior counsel for litigation and legal policy for General Electric (GE), where he was &quot;responsible for litigation, government and internal investigations, compliance, and legal policy worldwide.&quot; From 2001 to 2003, Bereson served as Associate White House Counsel to President George W.

<doc id="1007645" wikidata="Q1969638" url="?curid=1007645" title="Native title in Australia">
<text>Native title is the set of rights, recognised by Australian law, held by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups or individuals to land that derive from their maintenance of their traditional laws and customs. These Aboriginal title rights were first recognised as a part of Australian common law with the decision of &quot;Mabo v Queensland (No 2)&quot; in 1992. The doctrine was subsequently implemented and modified via statute with the &quot;Native Title Act 1993&quot;.

The concept recognises that in certain cases there was and is a continued beneficial legal interest in land held by Indigenous peoples which survived the acquisition of radical title and sovereignty to the land by the Crown. Native title can co-exist with non-Aboriginal proprietary rights and in some cases different Aboriginal groups can exercise their native title rights over the same land.

The Federal Court of Australia arranges mediation in relation to claims made by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and hears applications for, and makes, native title determinations. Appeals against these determinations can be made to a full sitting of the Federal Court and then to the High Court of Australia. The National Native Title Tribunal (NNTT), established under the &quot;Native Title Act 1993&quot;, is a body that applies the &quot;registration test&quot; to all new native title claimant applications, and undertakes future act mediation and arbitral functions. The Attorney-General&#x27;s Department advises the Australian Government on legal and legal-policy regarding on native title, and assists the Attorney-General to administer the &quot;Native Title Act 1993&quot;.

==Definitions: Native title/land rights==
According to the Attorney-General&#x27;s Department:

The &quot;Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976&quot; (see below) covers the granting of land to Aboriginal Land Trusts; setting up Aboriginal land councils; mineral rights; decision-making processes for dealing with land; dealing with income from land use agreements; and negotiations about leases for development on Aboriginal land. The &quot;Native Title Act 1993&quot; (NTA) gives recognition that &quot;Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have rights to land, water and sea, including exclusive possession in some cases, but does not provide ownership&quot;. It allows for negotiations over land, but does not provide for a veto over development, and nor does it grant land, as the &quot;Aboriginal Land Rights Act&quot; (ALRA) does.

===Native title definitions===
National Native Title Tribunal definition:

Commonwealth Government&#x27;s indigenous.gov.au website:

Native title has also been described as a &quot;bundle of rights&quot; in land, which may include such rights as camping, performing ceremony, etc. If native title is granted, specific rights are decided on a case-by-case basis, and may only sometimes includes freehold title.

==History==
===Pre-Mabo===
====1971 – Milirrpum====

Australia did not experience litigation involving Aboriginal native title until the 1970s, though several earlier cases tangentially involved issues of native title. In 1835, John Batman purported to sign Batman&#x27;s Treaty with Aboriginal elders in the Port Phillip District. Governor Bourke declared Batman&#x27;s Treaty was &quot;void and of no effect as against the rights of the Crown&quot; and declared any person on &quot;vacant land of the Crown&quot; without authorization from the Crown to be trespassing. The proclamation was approved by the Colonial Office. The official objection to the Treaty was that Batman had attempted to negotiate directly with the Aboriginal people, whom the British did not recognise as having any claim to any lands in Australia.

In 1971, in &quot;Milirrpum v Nabalco Pty Ltd&quot; (the &quot;Gove land rights case&quot;) in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory, Justice Richard Blackburn explicitly rejected the concept of native title, ruling against the claimants on a number of issues of law and fact.

====1972–1976: &quot;Aboriginal Land Rights Act&quot; ====
In the wake of &quot;Milirrpum&quot; and the election of the Whitlam government in 1972, the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission (also known as the Woodward Royal Commission) was established in 1973 to inquire into appropriate ways to recognise Aboriginal land rights in the Northern Territory. Prime Minister Gough Whitlam introduced a new policy of Aboriginal self-determination, and initiatives such as the Aboriginal Land Fund and the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee was set up. The latter consisted of elected Aboriginal representatives, who would advise the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs. The Whitlam government introduced legislation later passed by the Fraser government as the &quot;Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976&quot;, which established a procedure to transfer almost 50 per cent of land in the Northern Territory (around 600,000 km2) to collective Aboriginal ownership. The Fraser government continued to implement many of the previous government&#x27;s initiatives, under the description &quot;self-management&quot; rather than self-determination.

====1979 – &quot;Coe v Commonwealth&quot;====
In 1979, Paul Coe, a Wiradjuri man from Cowra, New South Wales, commenced an action in the High Court of Australia arguing that Aboriginal people retained rights to land as an Aboriginal nation or nations existed pre-settlement and continues to exist, and that their land had been taken by conquest rather than by settlement. The court held in &quot;Coe v Commonwealth&quot; (1979) that no Aboriginal nation holds any kind of sovereignty, distinguishing the US case of Cherokee Nation v Georgia (1831). However, the substantive issue of continuing land rights was not heard due to the lack of precision, vagueness and other serious deficiencies with the statement of claim presented to the court. Justice Gibbs said, at paragraph 21, &#x27;The question what rights the aboriginal people of this country have, or ought to have, in the lands of Australia is one which has become a matter of heated controversy. If there are serious legal questions to be decided as to the existence or nature of such rights, no doubt the sooner they are decided the better, but the resolution of such questions by the courts will not be assisted by imprecise, emotional or intemperate claims. In this, as in any other litigation, the claimants will be best served if their claims are put before the court dispassionately, lucidly and in proper form&#x27;.

====1981 – &quot;Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Land Rights Act&quot;====

The South Australian &quot;Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Land Rights Act 1981&quot; was introduced by Premier Don Dunstan in November 1978, several months prior to his resignation from Parliament. An amended bill, following extensive consultation, was passed by the Tonkin Liberal government in March 1981. This legislation gave significant rights well in advance of any other to date in Australia. In 1981, SA Premier Tonkin returned of land (10.2% of the state&#x27;s land area) to the Pitjantjara and Yankunytjatjara people. However, it did not give the people the power of veto over mining activities; any disputes would need to be resolved by an independent arbitrator.

In 1984 Premier John Bannon&#x27;s Labor government passed legislation to return lands to the Maralinga Tjarutja people. The legislation was proclaimed in January 1985 and was followed by a ceremony in the desert attended by Maralinga Tjarutja leader Archie Barton, John Bannon and Aboriginal Affairs Minister Greg Crafter. This granted rights over of land in the Great Victoria Desert, including the land contaminated by the British nuclear weapons testing at Maralinga.

===Mabo and the &quot;Native Title Act&quot;===
====1988–1992 – Mabo====
&quot;Mabo v Queensland (No 2)&quot; (1992) was the foundational case for native title in Australia. In 1992 the rejection of native title in &quot;Milirrpum v Nabalco&quot; was overruled by the High Court in &quot;Mabo v Queensland (No 2)&quot;, which recognised the Meriam people of Murray Island (Mer) in the Torres Strait as native title holders over part of their traditional lands. The Court rejected the notion that all Indigenous rights to land were abolished upon acquisition of sovereignty over Australia. The Court held that native title rights continued to exist, and that these rights existed by virtue of the continuing connection of Indigenous People to land, independent from a grant from the Crown. Native title would continue to exist as long as traditional laws and customs continue to be observed, unless the rights were otherwise extinguished by an incompatible grant by the Crown. Justice Gerard Brennan in this landmark decision stated:

However, when the tide of history has washed away any real acknowledgment of traditional law and any real observance of traditional customs, the foundation of native title has disappeared. Thus although over some parts of Australia native title has been lost, in large areas of the nation&#x27;s interior, native title could be recognised.

As Justice Brennan stated in &quot;Mabo (No. 2)&quot;, &quot;native title has its origin and is given its content by the traditional laws acknowledged by and the customs observed by the Aboriginal inhabitants of a territory&quot;.

====1993 – &quot;Native Title Act 1993&quot;====

One year after the recognition of the legal concept of native title in &quot;Mabo&quot;, the Keating government formalised the recognition by legislation with the enactment by the Australian Parliament of the &quot;Native Title Act 1993&quot;. The Act attempted to clarify the legal position of landholders and the processes to be followed for native title to be claimed, protected and recognised through the courts. The Act also established the National Native Title Tribunal.

===Wik and 1998 amendment===
====1996 – Wik====

After the Mabo decision it was uncertain as to whether the granting of pastoral leases would extinguish native title. The Wik Decision in 1996 clarified the uncertainty. The court found that the statutory pastoral leases (which cover some 40% of the Australian land mass) under consideration by the court did not bestow rights of exclusive possession on the leaseholder. As a result, native title rights could co-exist, depending on the terms and nature of the particular pastoral lease. Where there was a conflict of rights, the rights under the pastoral lease would prevail over native title rights.

====1998 – &quot;Native Title Amendment Act 1998&quot;====

The Wik decision led to amendments to the &quot;Native Title Act&quot; 1993 by the &quot;Native Title Amendment Act 1998&quot;. This Act, also known as the &quot;10 Point Plan&quot;, was introduced by the Howard government. The amendments substantially restricted Native Title by narrowing the right to negotiate and extinguishing Native Title on most pastoral and mining leases granted before 1994.

===Cases after the 1998 amendment===
====1998–2002 – Yorta Yorta====

&quot;Yorta Yorta v Victoria&quot;, addressed a native title claim by the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal people of north central Victoria, which was dismissed by Justice Olney of the Federal Court in 1998. Appeals to the Full Bench of the Federal Court in 2001, and the High Court in 2002 were also dismissed.

The determination by Justice Olney in 1998 ruled that the &#x27;tide of history&#x27; had &#x27;washed away&#x27; any real acknowledgement of traditional laws and any real observance of traditional customs by the applicants. The 2002 High Court decision adopted strict requirements of continuity of traditional laws and customs for native title claims to succeed.

==== 1998–2003 – Miriuwung Gajerrong ====
&quot;Ward v Western Australia&quot; (1998) addressed an application made on behalf of the Miriuwung and Gajerrong people of the east Kimberly, over land in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Justice Malcolm Lee of the Federal Court ruled in their favour in recognition of the native title. Western Australia appealed the decision to the Full Court of the Federal Court, then to the High Court.

The High Court held in &quot;Western Australia v Ward&quot; that native title is a bundle of rights, which may be extinguished one by one, for example, by a mining lease. In this case, the lease did not confer &#x27;exclusive possession&#x27;, because the claimants could pass over the land and do various things. But some parts of native title rights were extinguished, including the rights to control access and make use of the land.

The claim was remitted to the Full Court of the Federal Court to determine in accordance with the decision of the High Court. The claimants reached an agreement about the claim area and a determination was made in 2003. &quot;Exclusive possession native title was recognised over Lacrosse Island, Kanggurru Island, Aboriginal reserves within the Kununurra townsite, Glen Hill pastoral lease and Hagan Island. Non-exclusive rights were recognised over a number of areas including islands in Lake Argyle.&quot;

====2001 – Yarmirr====

&quot;Yarmirr v Northern Territory&quot; (2001), addressed an application made on behalf of a number of clan groups of Aboriginal people to an area of seas and sea-beds surrounding Croker Island in the Northern Territory. It was the first judgment by the High Court of native title over waters. The judge, Olney J, determined that members of the Croker Island community have a native title right to have free access to the sea and sea-bed of the claimed area for a number of purposes. The case established that traditional owners do have native title of the sea and sea-bed; however common law rights of fishing and navigation mean that only non-exclusive native title can exist over the sea. The decision paved the way for other native title applications involving waters to proceed.

====2002 &amp; 2004 – Nangkiriny====

&quot;Nangkiriny v State of Western Australia&quot; (2002 &amp; 2004), in which John Dudu Nangkiriny and others were plaintiffs, were cases addressing the claims of the Karajarri people in the Kimberley region, south of Broome. Land rights were recognised over of land (half the size of Tasmania) via an ILUA on 5 July 2011.

====2004 – Maralinga====
In May 2004, following the passage of special legislation, South Australian Premier Mike Rann handed back title to 21,000 square kilometres of land to the Maralinga Tjarutja and Pila Nguru people. The land, north-west of Adelaide and abutting the Western Australia border, was then called the Unnamed Conservation Park. It is now known as Mamungari Conservation Park. It includes the Serpentine Lakes, and was the largest land return since 1984. At the 2004 ceremony Rann said the return of the land fulfilled a promise he made to Archie Barton in 1991 when he was Aboriginal Affairs Minister, after he passed legislation to return lands including the sacred Ooldea area (which also included the site of Daisy Bates&#x27; mission camp) to the Maralinga Tjarutja people. The Maralinga Tjarutja lands now total 102,863 square kilometres.

====2005 – Wotjobaluk, Jaadwa, Jadawadjali, Wergaia and Jupagalk====

The Aboriginal peoples of the Wimmera region of Western Victoria won recognition of their native title on 13 December 2005 after a ten-year legal process commenced in 1995 when they filed an application for a determination of native title in respect of certain land and waters in Western Victoria. It was the first successful native title claim in south-eastern Australia and in Victoria, determined by Justice Ron Merkel involving Wotjobaluk, Jaadwa, Jadawadjali, Wergaia and Jupagalk people. In his reasons for judgment Justice Merkel explained the significance of his orders:

::&quot;The orders I propose to make are of special significance as they constitute the first recognition and protection of native title resulting in the ongoing enjoyment of native title in the State of Victoria and, it would appear, on the South-Eastern seaboard of Australia. These are areas in which the Aboriginal peoples suffered severe and extensive dispossession, degradation and devastation as a consequence of the establishment of British sovereignty over their lands and waters during the 19th century.&quot;

====2005 – Noongar====
In 2005 the Federal Court brought down a judgment recognising the native title of the Noongar people over the Perth metropolitan area. Justice Wilcox found that native title continues to exist within an area in and around Perth. It was the first judgment recognising native title over a capital city and its surroundings. The claim area itself is part of a much larger area included in the &quot;Single Noongar Claim&quot;, covering the south-western corner of Western Australia. An appeal was subsequently lodged and in 2008 the Full Court of the Federal Court upheld parts of the appeal by the Western Australian and Commonwealth governments against Justice Wilcox&#x27;s judgment.

====2008 – Blue Mud Bay sea rights====
The 2008 decision by the High Court decided the &quot;Blue Mud Bay sea rights case&quot;, establishing a precedent for sea rights over an intertidal zone for the first time. The Yolngu people of Baniyala were involved in this case, which involved Blue Mud Bay in East Arnhem Land.

===2007 &amp; 2009 amendments===

In 2007 the Howard government passed the &quot;Native Title Amendment Act 2007&quot;, and the &quot;Native Title Amendment (Technical Amendments) Act&quot; 2007, a package of coordinated measures and technical amendments to improve the performance of the native title system. These are aimed at making the native title process more efficient and to speed up the determination of whether native title exists on the 580 claims that had been registered but not yet determined.

The &quot;Native Title Act 1993&quot; was further amended by the Rudd government by the &quot;Native Title Amendment Act 2009&quot;. It allows the Federal Court to determine who may mediate a claim, whether that be the court itself, the Native Title Tribunal, or otherwise.

===Further significant determinations===
====2008–2019 – Timber Creek====
&quot;Northern Territory v Mr Griffiths and Lorraine Jones&quot; was a 2018 High Court of Australia case, ruled in 2019, regarding land around Timber Creek, Northern Territory, involving a compensation claim by Ngaliwurru and Nungali lands surrounding Timber Creek. It related to various earlier cases since 1997. Described as &quot;the most significant [case]… since Mabo&quot;, the High Court ruled for the first time on compensation for the extinguishment of native title in Australia. It is considered a &quot;landmark&quot; native title case, because the clauses contained within the &quot;Native Title Act 1993&quot; pertaining to the determination of compensation payable due to the extinguishment of native title had never been heard before in the High Court.

====2020 – Yamatji====

Yamatji Marlpa Aboriginal Corporation was involved in a large native title claim from 1996, based on the &quot;Native Title Act 1993&quot;, resulting in an historic determination in February 2020, involving both native title and an ILUA, covering an area of in Western Australia.

====2020 – Gurindji, Wave Hill Station====

A claim was lodged in 2016 by the Central Land Council on behalf of the Gurindji peoples in the area, as there were mining interests in area covered by Wave Hill Station&#x27;s pastoral lease. On 8 September 2020, the Federal Court of Australia recognised the native title rights of the Gurindji people to of the Wave Hill Station, allowing them to receive royalties as compensation from resource companies who explore the area. Justice Richard White said that the determination recognised Indigenous involvement (Jamangku, Japuwuny, Parlakuna-Parkinykarni and Yilyilyimawu peoples) with the land &quot;at least since European settlement and probably for millennia&quot;. The court sitting took place nearly south of Darwin, and descendants of Vincent Lingiari and others involved in the Wave Hill walk-off celebrated the determination. The owners will participate in the mining negotiations and exploration work, from which royalties may flow in the future, but just as important is the right to hunt, gather, teach and perform cultural activities and ceremonies, and allow the young people to connect with their land.

====2023 – Eastern Maar====
In March 2023, 8578.35 kilometres along the coast of the Grey River in Victoria. The case was the first Native Title case heard in the state of Victoria for 10 years. At the Federal Court at Warnambool designated the land as native title rights.

==Native title rights and interests==
Native title concerns the interaction of two systems of law:

* The traditional laws and customs that regulated the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders prior to the colonisation of Australia by the British (&quot;Aboriginal customary law&quot;). 
* The English-derived legal system, which was brought to Australia with colonisation, which includes the common law and enacted laws (&quot;Australian law&quot;). As Australia was (and remains) designated as a &quot;settled&quot; colony, the laws of England were imported with any local laws not recognised (as they would be in &quot;conquered&quot; or &quot;ceded&quot; colonies).

Native title is the term adopted in Australian law to describe the rights to land and waters possessed by Indigenous Australians under their customary laws that are recognised by the Australian legal system. Native title is able to be possessed by a community or individual depending on the content of the traditional laws and customs; it is inalienable other than by surrender to the Crown; and rights over the land may range from access and usage rights to rights of exclusive possession. Native title rights and interests are based on laws and customs that pre-date the British acquisition of sovereignty; they are distinct from the rights granted by government such as statutory land rights of the kind found in the &quot;Land Rights Act&quot;. Native title rights and interests may exist over land and waters to the extent that they are consistent with other rights established over the land by law or executive action.

According to the National Native Title Tribunal (2013): &quot;The native title rights and interests held by particular Aboriginal people will depend on both their traditional laws and customs and what interests are held by others in the area concerned. Generally speaking, native title must give way to the rights held by others. The capacity of Australian law to recognise the rights and interests held under traditional law and custom will also be a factor... The source of native title is the system of traditional laws and customs of the native title holders themselves.&quot; Native title rights and interests may include the right to live in an area or to access it for traditional purposes; to visit and protect sacred sites; to hunt, fish or gather resources; or to teach law and custom. Exclusive possession can only be recognised over certain parts of Australia, such as vacant Crown land, or areas already held by Indigenous Australians.

A 2015 review of the &quot;Native Title Act&quot; by the Australian Law Reform Commission reported that &quot;Courts have indicated that native title is not to be understood in terms equivalent to common law property interests, but they often still tend to draw on these concepts... The prevailing view of the nature and content of native title is hybrid, drawing on traditional laws and customs for content, but also at times idiosyncratically adopting common law terms to describe the nature or character of the rights&quot;. It is a complex area of law. The Act continues to be reviewed and amended.

==Native title determinations==
The National Native Title Register (NNTR), maintained by the NNTT, is a register of approved native title determinations. A determination can be that native title does or does not exist. As part of the determination of native title, native title groups are required to nominate a Native Title Prescribed Body Corporate to hold (as trustee) or manage (as agent) their native title. Following a determination, Prescribed Bodies Corporate are entered onto the NNTR. At this point, the corporation becomes a Registered Native Title Body Corporate (RNTBC).

On 1 July 2011, the 160 registered determinations of native title covered some (approximately 16 per cent) of the land mass of Australia; and registered Indigenous land use agreements (ILUAs) covered about (about 16 per cent) of the land mass, as well as about of sea.

==Mediation==

Native title in Australia frequently involves mediation between native title parties and other groups with an interest in native title, such as the Australian Government, state and territory governments, miners and pastoralists. Amendments to the NTA made in 2012 meant that the NNTT would henceforth only conduct native title claim mediation by referral from the Federal Court, which may also order mediation by other agencies or persons. The purpose of mediation is to assist parties to clarify the issues in dispute, to explore options for settlement and to reach agreement. Mediation is a structured process, with the intention of a mutually agreed outcome rather than having a decision imposed by a judge.

==Alternative agreements==
Alternative settlements (also termed &quot;broader settlements&quot;) may be negotiated out of court, often being resolved more quickly and efficiently than via the court process under the &quot;Native Title Act&quot;. They can give traditional owner group recognition in areas where native title rights have been extinguished, or where it is difficult for a group to prove that it persists. Such agreements are resolved through negotiation, and recognition of traditional ownership and various other land rights in land may be achieved without an actual native title determination. Examples of such arrangements are the Indigenous land use agreement or, in Victoria, a settlement under the &quot;Traditional Owner Settlement Act 2010&quot; (TOSA).

Alternative settlements agreements can be made alongside the &quot;Native Title Act&quot;, but usually the traditional owners are required to withdraw any existing native title claims. Such settlements can include any matters agreed to by all parties, which may included recognition of traditional owner rights, grants of freehold for specified purposes, or the right to be consulted and participate in natural resource management.

===Types===

====ILUAs====
An Indigenous land use agreement (ILUA) is a voluntary agreement between a native title group and others about the use of land and waters, provided for under the Act. They must be about native title matters, but can include other matters. They enable people to negotiate flexible and pragmatic agreements to suit their particular circumstances.

An ILUA may exist over areas where native title has, or has not yet, been determined; may be entered into regardless of whether there is a native title claim over the area or not; and may be part of a native title determination, or settled separately from a native title claim. An ILUA is binding between a native title group or Registered Native Title Body Corporate/s (RNTBC) and other parties, and bind all persons holding native title in the area of the ILUA, regardless of whether they are parties or not.

ILUAs are an alternative to making an application for native title determination, generally processed within less than six months, and may deal with a wide range of issues, including such topics as:
*native title holders agreeing to a future development;
*how native title rights coexist with the rights of other people;
*access to an area;
*protection of sacred sites
*extinguishment of native title;
*compensation;
*employment and economic opportunities for native title groups;
*cultural heritage; and
*mining.

There are three types of ILUAs: Body Corporate Agreements, Area Agreements and Alternative Procedure Agreements.

====TOSA settlements (Vic.)====
The &quot;Traditional Owner Settlement Act 2010&quot; (TOSA) &quot;provides for an out-of-court settlement of native title. The Act allows the Victorian Government to recognise traditional owners and certain rights in Crown land. In return for entering into a settlement, traditional owners must agree to withdraw any native title claim, pursuant to the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) and not to make any future native title claims&quot;.

===Traditional owner===

Alternative agreements require that the claimants demonstrate that they are the &quot;traditional owners&quot; (or &quot;traditional custodians&quot;) of the country in question. However, this term has sometimes proved problematic in law: it is not mentioned in the NTA, but Indigenous Land Use Agreements (see below), which are provided for under the Act, require that the Indigenous group or groups party to the agreement assert &quot;traditional ownership&quot; of the area.

The definition of the term &quot;&quot; varies among jurisdictions. According to the &quot;Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976&quot;, the term refers to &quot;a local descent group of Aboriginals who: (a) have common spiritual affiliations to a site on the land, being affiliations that place the group under a primary spiritual responsibility for that site and for the land; and (b) are entitled by Aboriginal tradition to forage as of right over that land&quot;. A similar definition was incorporated in the &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot; (EPBC), but legislation differed in various states, such as the South Australian legislation referring to an &quot;Aboriginal person who has, in accordance with Aboriginal tradition, social, economic and spiritual affiliations with, and responsibilities for, the lands or any part of them&quot;.

A further complexity is introduced in a form of ranking of rights, for example in New South Wales, a traditional owner must be both born in the country and have a cultural association with the land. Peter Sutton distinguishes between &quot;core&quot; and &quot;contingent&quot; rights, which he says are recognised among most Aboriginal peoples. So there are sometimes challenges in finding &quot;the right people for the right country&quot;, complicated by the fact that there are cases where both primary and secondary rights holders are described by the term. Distinguishing between &quot;historical people&quot; and others who have been custodians of the land for many generations add to the complexity. In the case of some agreements, historical people may be recognised as parties even when they don&#x27;t have &quot;traditional&quot; associations with the land.

The term Traditional Owner Corporation (TOC) is used to refer to various types of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations. Such a corporation is usually the negotiating body when determining native title outcomes. (A TOC is distinct from the Registered Native Title Body Corporate (RNTBC), which manages the land after a native title determination has been made.)

In Victoria, a &quot;traditional owner group&quot; is defined in the &quot;Traditional Owner Settlement Act 2010&quot; to include those people recognised by the Attorney-General as traditional owners, based on their traditional and cultural associations with the land, and there are government guidelines detailing what these terms mean. They state that &quot;traditional&quot; &quot;Denotes linkages with the past that are actively kept alive by the traditional owner group members. It is not restricted to features or activities understood to be fully continuous with, and identical to, such activities or features in pre-contact Aboriginal society&quot;.

Apart from the legal definitions, the terms traditional owners or traditional custodians of the land are included in Acknowledgment of Country wording which is used to pay respects to the people of that Country.

===Examples of alternative settlements===

*South West Native Title Settlement for Noongar people in Western Australia aims to resolve native title claims in exchange for statutory recognition of the Noongar people as the traditional owners of south-Western Australia. it is the largest native title settlement in Australian history, affecting about 30,000 Noongar people and encompassing around in south-western Western Australia. It has been described as &quot;Australia&#x27;s first treaty&quot;.
*An Indigenous Land Use Agreement (ILUA) was agreed with the Kaurna Yerta Aboriginal Corporation (KYAC) in Adelaide, South Australia and effected on 19 November 2018.

==By state and territory==
===ACT===
No native title claim has ever been granted in the ACT, because of the lack of historical records enabling such a determination to be made.

===South Australia===

An Indigenous Land Use Agreement (ILUA) was agreed with the Kaurna Yerta Aboriginal Corporation (KYAC) and effected on 19 November 2018. The agreement was among the South Australian government, the federal government and the Kaurna people, with formal recognition coming after the Federal Court judgment, 18 years after lodgement. This was the first claim for a first land use agreement to be agreed to in any Australian capital city. The rights cover Adelaide&#x27;s whole metropolitan area and includes &quot;17 parcels of undeveloped land not under freehold&quot;. Some of the land is Crown land, some belongs to the state government and some is private land owned by corporations. Justice Debra Mortimer said it would be &quot;the first time in Australia that there [had] been a positive outcome within the area of (native title) determination&quot;.

===Victoria===
, four native title claims have been determined in Victoria; three of them resulted in the recognition of native title by agreement via a consent determination in the Federal Court. In &quot;Yorta Yorta v Victoria&quot; (see above) in 2003, native title was determined not to exist by the Federal Court. The native title determinations are:
*Wotjobaluk, Jaadwa, Jadawadjali, Wergaia and Yupagalk Peoples (known as the &quot;Wimmera claim - see above) (2005)
*Gunditjmara People (2007)
*Gunaikurnai People (October 2010)
Although the Yorta Yorta people&#x27;s claim did not meet the legal standard for native title under the Act, in 2004 the Victorian Government entered into a Cooperative Management Agreement with the Yorta Yorta Nation Aboriginal Corporation, which was the first Victorian agreement reached outside the native title process, and applies to designated areas of Crown land in north central Victoria, with direct engagement between Yorta Yorta, Parks Victoria and the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP). In October 2010, the State entered into a Traditional Owner Land Management Agreement with the Yorta Yorta, which established the Yorta Yorta Traditional Owner Land Management Board to jointly manage Barmah National Park (a TOSA settlement, under the &quot;Traditional Owner Settlement Act 2010&quot;).

===Western Australia===
An alternative settlement, the South West Native Title Settlement for Noongar people in Western Australia, aims to resolve native title claims in exchange for statutory recognition of the Noongar people as the traditional owners of south-Western Australia. it is the largest native title settlement in Australian history, affecting about 30,000 Noongar people and encompassing around in south-western Western Australia. It has been described as &quot;Australia&#x27;s first treaty&quot;.

The &quot;Noongar (Koorah, Nitja, Boordahwan) (Past, Present, Future) Recognition Act 2016&quot; recognises Noongar ownership, and the settlement includes six individual Indigenous Land Use Agreements (ILUAs). On 19 December 2019, the Federal Court upheld the Native Title Registrar’s decision to register the six ILUAs, and settlement is expected to begin in the second half of 2020.

==National Native Title Council==
The National Native Title Council (NNTC) is a not-for-profit organisation whose website states that it is the &quot;peak body for the native title sector&quot;. Its members include regional Native Title Representative Bodies (NTRBs), Native Title Service Providers (NTSPs), local Prescribed Body Corporates (PBCs) and Traditional Owner Corporations (TOCs).

==Human rights reports==
Under the &quot;Native Title Act 1993&quot;, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner was required to prepare an annual report to the Attorney-General on the operation of the NTA and its effect on the exercise and enjoyment of human rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and to report on other matters as and when requested by the Attorney-General.

The objectives of the Commissioner were to provide and promote a human rights perspective on native title; to assist in developing more efficient native title processes; and to advocate for the co-existence between Indigenous and non-Indigenous interests in land based on compatible land use. All of the reports from 1994 to 2016 have been published online. Changes brought about by the &quot;Human Rights Legislation Amendment Act 2017&quot; removed the statutory obligation for an annual Social Justice and Native Title Report such as those produced up to and including 2016.

<text>Pontarlier ( ; Latin: &quot;Ariolica&quot;) is a commune and one of the two sub-prefectures of the Doubs department in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region in eastern France near the Swiss border.

==History==

Pontarlier occupies the ancient Roman station of Ariolica, in Gallia and is placed in the &quot;Tables&quot; on the road from Urba (modern Orbe, Canton Vaud, Switzerland), to Vesontio (modern Besançon). Although the distances in the Antonine Itinerary do not agree with the real distances, French geographer D&#x27;Anville recognized a transposition of the numbers. The Theodosian Tabula names the place &quot;Abrolica&quot;, which William Smith states as a possible error of transcription.

After the Burgundian invasion in the 5th century, Pontarlier became an unavoidable way of trade from the kingdom of Burgundy to Switzerland, Germany or Lombardy. Until the 17th century it lay on the easiest way to cross Jura mountains.

Pontarlier is one of the staging posts from northern France, Britain and the Benelux countries for the Via Francigena, now a walking route to Rome with a starting point in Canterbury, England. It is recorded as being the stop on day 57 of Sigeric the Serious, the then Archbishop of Canterbury on his return from Rome in 990 AD, having been given his pallium, or token of rank. Discussion continues as to whether he came over the Jura from the direction of Yverdon-les-Bains to the south-east or through a valley from Jougne to the south.

The city of Pontarlier is briefly mentioned in Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Les Misérables&quot;. It was to this city that convict Jean Valjean was to report for his parole after being released from the galleys. Breaking these instructions is a major turning point in the novel, and also creates some major conflict for Valjean later in the story. The city is also the main location of the 1962 French film &quot;The Seventh Juror&quot;.

Pontarlier was famous for the production of absinthe until its ban in 1915. The distilleries switched over to producing a particular type of pastis, the &quot;Pontarlier&quot;. With the ban partially lifted in the 1990s, Pontarlier distilleries are once again producing absinthe.

==Population==
==Transportation==
The commune has a railway station, , on the Frasne–Les Verrières and Neuchâtel–Pontarlier lines between France and Switzerland.

<text>Self-verifying theories are consistent first-order systems of arithmetic, much weaker than Peano arithmetic, that are capable of proving their own consistency. Dan Willard was the first to investigate their properties, and he has described a family of such systems. According to Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem, these systems cannot contain the theory of Peano arithmetic nor its weak fragment Robinson arithmetic; nonetheless, they can contain strong theorems.

In outline, the key to Willard&#x27;s construction of his system is to formalise enough of the Gödel machinery to talk about provability internally without being able to formalise diagonalisation. Diagonalisation depends upon being able to prove that multiplication is a total function (and in the earlier versions of the result, addition also). Addition and multiplication are not function symbols of Willard&#x27;s language; instead, subtraction and division are, with the addition and multiplication predicates being defined in terms of these. Here, one cannot prove the formula_1 sentence expressing totality of multiplication:
formula_2 
where formula_3 is the three-place predicate which stands for formula_4
When the operations are expressed in this way, provability of a given sentence can be encoded as an arithmetic sentence describing termination of an analytic tableau. Provability of consistency can then simply be added as an axiom. The resulting system can be proven consistent by means of a relative consistency argument with respect to ordinary arithmetic.

One can further add any true formula_5 sentence of arithmetic to the theory while still retaining consistency of the theory.

<text>Hispanic and Latino Americans are Americans that have Spanish or Latin American background, culture, or family origin. These demographics include all Americans who identify as Hispanic or Latino regardless of race. As of 2020, the Census Bureau estimated that there were almost 65.3 million Hispanics and Latinos living in the United States and its territories.

&quot;Origin&quot; can be viewed as the ancestry, nationality group, lineage or country of birth of the person or the person&#x27;s parents or ancestors before their arrival in the United States of America. People who identify as Hispanic or Latino may be of any race, because similarly to what occurred during the colonization and post-independence of the United States, Latin American countries had their populations made up of multiracial and monoracial descendants of settlers from the metropole of a European colonial empire (in the case of Latin American countries, Spanish and Portuguese settlers, unlike the Thirteen Colonies that will form the United States, which received settlers from the United Kingdom), in addition to these, there are also monoracial and multiracial descendants of Indigenous peoples of the Americas (Native Americans), descendants of African slaves brought to Latin America in the colonial era, and post-independence immigrants from Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia. As one of only two specifically designated categories of ethnicity in the United States, Hispanics and Latinos form a pan-ethnicity incorporating a diversity of inter-related cultural and linguistic heritages, the use of the Spanish and Portuguese languages being the most important of all. The largest national origin groups of Hispanic and Latino Americans in order of population size are: Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Salvadoran, Dominican, Brazilian, Colombian, Guatemalan, Honduran, Ecuadorian, Peruvian, Venezuelan and Nicaraguan. The predominant origin of regional Hispanic and Latino populations varies widely in different locations across the country. In 2012, Hispanic Americans were the second fastest-growing ethnic group by percentage growth in the United States after Asian Americans.

Hispanic Americans of Indigenous American descent and European (typically Spanish) descent are the second oldest racial group (after the Native Americans) to inhabit much of what is today the United States. Spain colonized large areas of what is today the American Southwest and West Coast, as well as Florida. Its holdings included all of present-day California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Florida, as well as parts of Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas and Oklahoma, all of which constituted part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, based in Mexico City. Later, this vast territory (except Florida, which Spain ceded to the United States in 1821) became part of Mexico after its independence from Spain in 1821 and until the end of the Mexican–American War in 1848. Hispanic immigrants to the New York/New Jersey metropolitan area derive from a broad spectrum of Hispanic countries.

==Terminology==

The terms &quot;Hispanic&quot; and &quot;Latino&quot; refer to an ethnicity. &quot;Hispanic&quot; first came into popular use to refer to individuals with origins in Spanish-speaking countries after the Office of Management and Budget created the classification in 1977, as proposed by a subcommittee composed of three government employees, a Cuban, Mexican, and Puerto Rican American. The United States Census Bureau defines being Hispanic as being a member of an ethnicity, rather than being a member of a particular race and thus, people who are members of this group may also be members of any race. In a 2015 national survey of self-identified Hispanics, 56% said that being Hispanic is part of both their racial and ethnic background, while smaller numbers considered it part of their ethnic background only (19%) or racial background only (11%). Hispanics may be of any linguistic background; in a 2015 survey, 71% of American Hispanics agreed that it &quot;is not necessary for a person to speak Spanish to be considered Hispanic/Latino&quot;. Hispanic and Latino people may share some commonalities in their language, culture, history, and heritage. According to the Smithsonian Institution, the term &quot;Latino&quot; includes peoples with Portuguese roots, such as Brazilians, as well as those of Spanish-language origin. The difference between the terms &quot;Hispanic&quot; and &quot;Latino&quot; is ambiguous to some people. The US Census Bureau equates the two terms and defines them as referring to anyone from Spain or the Spanish- or Portuguese-speaking countries of the Americas. After the Mexican–American War concluded in 1848, term &quot;Hispanic&quot; or &quot;Spanish American&quot; was primarily used to describe the Hispanos of New Mexico within the American Southwest. The 1970 United States census controversially broadened the definition to &quot;a person of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race&quot;. This is now the common formal and colloquial definition of the term within the United States, outside of New Mexico. This definition is consistent with the 21st century usage by the US Census Bureau and OMB, as the two agencies use both terms Hispanic and Latino interchangeably. The Pew Research Center believes that the term &quot;Hispanic&quot; is strictly limited to Spain, Puerto Rico, and all countries where Spanish is the only official language whereas &quot;Latino&quot; includes all countries in Latin America (even Brazil regardless of the fact that Portuguese is its only official language), but it does not include Spain and Portugal.

The terms &quot;Latino&quot; and &quot;Latina&quot; are loan words from Italy and are ultimately from ancient Rome. In English, the term Latino is a condensed form of &quot;latinoamericano&quot;, the Spanish term for a Latin American, or someone who comes from Latin America. The term &quot;Latino&quot; has developed a number of definitions. This definition, as a &quot;male Latin American inhabitant of the United States&quot;, is the oldest definition which is used in the United States, it was first used in 1946. Under this definition a Mexican American or Puerto Rican, for example, is both a Hispanic and a Latino. A Brazilian American is also a Latino by this definition, which includes those of Portuguese-speaking origin from Latin America. In English, Italian Americans are &quot;not&quot; considered &quot;Latino&quot;, as they are for the most part descended from immigrants from Europe rather than Latin America, unless they happen to have had recent history in a Latin American country.

Preference of use between the terms among Hispanics in the United States often depends on where users of the respective terms reside. Those in the Eastern United States tend to prefer the term &quot;Hispanic&quot;, whereas those in the West tend to prefer &quot;Latino&quot;.

The US ethnic designation &quot;Latino&quot; is abstracted from the longer form &quot;latinoamericano&quot;. The element &quot;Latino-&quot; is actually an indeclinable, compositional form in &quot;-o&quot; (i.e. an &quot;elemento compositivo&quot;) that is employed to coin compounded formations (similar as &quot;franco-&quot; in &quot;francocanadiense&quot; &#x27;French-Canadian&#x27;, or &quot;ibero-&quot; in &quot;iberorrománico&quot;, etc.).

The term &quot;Latinx&quot; (and similar neologism &quot;Xicanx&quot;) have gained some usage. The adoption of the &quot;X&quot; would be &quot;[r]eflecting new consciousness inspired by more recent work by LGBTQI and feminist movements, some Spanish-speaking activists are increasingly using a yet more inclusive &quot;x&quot; to replace the &quot;a&quot; and &quot;o&quot;, in a complete break with the gender binary. Among the advocates of the term &quot;LatinX&quot;, one of the most frequently cited complaints of gender bias in the Spanish language is that a group of mixed or unknown gender would be referred to as Latinos, whereas Latinas refers to a group of women only (but this is changed immediately to &quot;Latinos&quot;, if even a single man joins this female group). A 2020 Pew Research Center survey found that about 3% of Hispanics use the term (mostly women), and only around 23% have even heard of the term. Of those, 65% said it should not be used to describe their ethnic group.

Some have pointed out that the term &quot;Hispanic&quot; refers to a pan-ethnic identity, one that spans a range of races, national origins, and linguistic backgrounds. &quot;Terms like Hispanic and Latino do not fully capture how we see ourselves&quot;, says Geraldo Cadava, an associate professor of history and Hispanic studies at Northwestern University.

According to a 2020 American Community Survey data, more than two-thirds of Brazilians in the U.S. described themselves as Hispanic or Latino. In 2017, a small minority of Portugal (2%), and the Philippines (1%) self-identified as Hispanic.

==History==


===16th and 17th centuries===
Explorers were pioneers in the territory of the present-day United States. The first confirmed European landing in the continental United States was by Juan Ponce de León, who landed in 1513 at a lush shore he christened &quot;La Florida&quot;. In the next three decades, the small numbers of Spanish individuals became the first Europeans to reach the Appalachian Mountains, the Mississippi River, the Grand Canyon and the Great Plains. Ships sailed along the Atlantic Coast, penetrating to present-day Bangor, Maine, and up the Pacific Coast as far as Oregon. From 1528 to 1536, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca and three fellows (including an African named Estevanico), from a Spanish expedition that foundered, journeyed from Florida to the Gulf of California. In 1540, Hernando de Soto undertook an extensive exploration of the present United States.
Also in 1540, Francisco Vásquez de Coronado led 2,000 mostly Mexican natives across today&#x27;s Arizona–Mexico border and traveled as far as central Kansas, close to the exact geographic center of what is now the continental United States. Other Spanish explorers of the US territory include, among others: Alonso Alvarez de Pineda, Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón, Pánfilo de Narváez, Sebastián Vizcaíno, Gaspar de Portolà, Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, Tristán de Luna y Arellano, and Juan de Oñate, and non-Spanish explorers working for the Spanish Crown, such as Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo. In 1565, the Spanish created the first permanent European settlement in the continental United States, at St. Augustine, Florida. Spanish missionaries and colonists founded settlements including in the present-day Santa Fe, New Mexico, El Paso, San Antonio, Tucson, Albuquerque, San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.

Settlements in the Americas were part of a broader network of trade routes that connected Europe, Africa, and the Americas. The mostly Tlaxkalan settlers established trade connections with other indigenous peoples, exchanging goods such as furs, hides, agricultural products, and manufactured goods. These trade networks contributed to the economic development of colonies and facilitated cultural exchange between different groups.

===18th and 19th centuries===

As late as 1783, at the end of the American Revolutionary War (a conflict in which Spain aided and fought alongside the rebels), Spain held claim to roughly half the territory of today&#x27;s continental United States. From 1819 to 1848, the United States increased its area by roughly a third at Spanish and Mexican expense, acquiring the present-day U.S states of California, Texas, Nevada, Utah, most of Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona, and parts of Oklahoma, Kansas, and Wyoming through the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo after the Mexican-American War, as well as Florida through the Adams-Onís treaty, and the U.S territory of Puerto Rico through the Spanish-American War in 1898. Many Latinos residing in those regions during that period gained U.S. citizenship. Nonetheless, many long-established Latino residents faced significant difficulties post-citizenship. With the arrival of Anglo-Americans in these newly incorporated areas, Latino inhabitants struggled to maintain their land holdings, political influence, and cultural traditions.

The discovery of gold in California in 1848 attracted people from diverse backgrounds, including Hispanic and Latino miners, merchants, and settlers. The Gold Rush led to a population boom and rapid economic growth in California, transforming the social and political landscape of the region.

Many Hispanic natives lived in the areas that the United States acquired, and a new wave of Mexican, Central American, Caribbean, and South American immigrants had moved to the United States for new opportunities. This was the beginning of a demographic that would rise dramatically over the years.

===20th and 21st centuries===
During the 20th and 21st centuries, Hispanic immigration to the United States increased markedly following changes to the immigration law in 1965. During the World Wars, Hispanic Americans and immigrants had helped stabilize the American economy from falling due to the industrial boom in the Midwest in states such as Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. While a percentage of Americans had fled their jobs for the war, Hispanics had taken their jobs in the Industrial world. This can explain why there is such a high concentration of Hispanic Americans in Metro Areas such as the Chicago-Elgin-Naperville, Detroit-Warren-Dearborn, and Cleveland-Elyria areas.

Hispanic and Latino Americans were actively involved in the broader civil rights movement of the 20th century, advocating for equal rights, social justice, and an end to discrimination and segregation. Organizations such as the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and the United Farm Workers (UFW) fought for the rights of Hispanic and Latino workers and communities.

Hispanic contributions in the historical past and present of the United States are addressed in more detail below (See Notables and their contributions). To recognize the current and historic contributions of Hispanic Americans, on September 17, 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson designated a week in mid-September as National Hispanic Heritage Week, with Congress&#x27;s authorization. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan extended the observance to a month, designated National Hispanic Heritage Month. Hispanic Americans became the largest minority group in 2004.

Hispanic and Latino Americans increasingly sought political representation and empowerment during the 20th century. The election of individuals such as Edward Roybal, Henry B. González, and Dennis Chávez to Congress marked significant milestones in Hispanic political representation. Additionally, the appointment of individuals like Lauro Cavazos and Bill Richardson to cabinet positions highlighted the growing influence of Hispanic and Latino leaders in government.

Hispanic and Latino Americans became the largest minority group in the United States, contributing significantly to the country&#x27;s population growth. Efforts to preserve and promote Hispanic and Latino culture and heritage continued in the 21st century, including initiatives to support bilingual education, celebrate cultural traditions and festivals, and recognize the contributions of Hispanic and Latino individuals and communities to American society.
==Demographics==

As of 2020, Hispanics accounted for 19–20% of the US population, or 62–65 million people. The US Census Bureau later estimated that Hispanics were under-counted by 5.0% or 3.3 million persons in the US census, which explains the 3 million range in the number above. In contrast, Whites were over-counted by about 3 million. The Hispanic growth rate over the April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2007, period was 28.7%—about four times the rate of the nation&#x27;s total population growth (at 7.2%). The growth rate from July 1, 2005, to July 1, 2006, alone was 3.4%—about three and a half times the rate of the nation&#x27;s total population growth (at 1.0%). Based on the 2010 census, Hispanics are now the largest minority group in 191 out of 366 metropolitan areas in the United States. The projected Hispanic population of the United States for July 1, 2050 is 132.8 million people, or 30.2% of the nation&#x27;s total projected population on that date.

===Geographic distribution===


US Metropolitan Statistical Areas with over 1 million Hispanics (2014)
States and territories with the highest proportion of Hispanics (2021)
Of the nation&#x27;s total Hispanic population, 49% (21.5 million) live in California or Texas. In 2022, New York City and Washington, D.C. began receiving significant numbers of Latino migrants from the state of Texas, mostly originating from Venezuela, Ecuador, Colombia, and Honduras.

Over half of the Hispanic population is concentrated in the Southwest region, mostly composed of Mexican Americans. California and Texas have some of the largest populations of Mexicans and Central American Hispanics in the United States. The Northeast region is dominated by Dominican Americans and Puerto Ricans, having the highest concentrations of both in the country. In the Mid Atlantic region, centered on the DC Metro Area, Salvadoran Americans are the largest of Hispanic groups. Florida is dominated by Cuban Americans and Puerto Ricans. In both the Great Lakes states and the South Atlantic states, Mexicans and Puerto Ricans dominate. Mexicans dominate in the rest of the country, including the West, South Central and Great Plains states.

===National origin===

As of 2022, approximately 60.1% of the nation&#x27;s Hispanic population were of Mexican origin (see table). Another 9.6% were of Puerto Rican origin, and with about 3.9% each of Cuban and Salvadoran and about 3.7% Dominican origins. The remainder were of other Central American or of South American origin, or of origin directly from Spain. In 2017, Two thirds of all Hispanic Americans were born in the United States.

There are few immigrants directly from Spain, since Spaniards have historically emigrated to Hispanic America rather than to English-speaking countries. Because of this, most Hispanics who identify themselves as &quot;Spaniard&quot; or &quot;Spanish&quot; also identify with Hispanic American national origin. In the 2017 Census estimate approximately 1.76 million Americans reported some form of &quot;Spanish&quot; as their ancestry, whether directly from Spain or not.

In northern New Mexico and southern Colorado, there is a large portion of Hispanics who trace their ancestry to settlers from New Spain (Mexico), and sometimes Spain itself, in the late 16th century through the 17th century. People from this background often self-identify as &quot;Hispanos&quot;, &quot;Spanish&quot; or &quot;Hispanic&quot;. Many of these settlers also intermarried with local Native Americans, creating a mestizo population. Likewise, southern Louisiana is home to communities of people of Canary Islands descent, known as Isleños, in addition to other people of Spanish ancestry. Californios, Nuevomexicanos and Tejanos are Americans of Spanish and/or Mexican descent, with subgroups that sometimes call themselves Chicanos. Nuevomexicanos and Tejanos are distinct southwest Hispanic cultures with their own cuisines, dialects and musical traditions.

Nuyoricans are Americans of Puerto Rican descent from the New York City area. There are close to two million Nuyoricans in the United States. Prominent Nuyoricans include Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, US Supreme Court Judge Sonia Sotomayor, and singer Jennifer Lopez.
===Race and ethnicity===

Hispanics come from multi-racial and multi-ethnic countries with diversity of origins; therefore, a Hispanic can be from any race or mix of races. The most common ancestries are: Native American, European and African. Many also have colonial era New Christian Sephardic Jewish ancestry. As a result of their racial diversity, Hispanics form an ethnicity sharing a language (Spanish) and cultural heritage, rather than a race.

Hispanic origin is independent of race and is termed &quot;ethnicity&quot; by the United States Census Bureau.

On the 2020 United States census, 20.3% of Hispanics selected &quot;White&quot; as their race. This marked a large drop when compared to the 2010 United States census in which 53.0% of Hispanics identified as &quot;White&quot;. These Hispanics make up 12,579,626 people or 3.8% of the population.

Over 42% of Hispanic Americans identify as &quot;some other race&quot;. Of all Americans who checked the box &quot;Some Other Race&quot;, 97 percent were Hispanic. These Hispanics make up 26,225,882 people or 42.2% of the Hispanic population.

Over half of the &quot;two or more races&quot; respondents were Hispanics. These Hispanics make up 20,299,960 people or 32.7% of the Hispanic population.

The largest numbers of Black Hispanics are from the Spanish Caribbean islands, including the Cuban, Dominican, Panamanian and Puerto Rican communities.

In Puerto Rico, people have some Native Indigenous American ancestry as well as European and Canary Islander ancestry. There&#x27;s also a population of predominantly African descent as well as populations of Native American descent as well as those with intermixed ancestries. Cubans are mostly of Iberian and Canary Islander ancestry, with some heritage from Native Indigenous Caribbean. There are also populations of Black Sub-Saharan ancestry and multi-racial people. The race and culture of each Hispanic country and their United States diaspora differs by history and geography.

Welch and Sigelman found, as of the year 2000, lower interaction between Latinos of different nationalities (such as between Cubans and Mexicans) than between Latinos and non-Latinos. This is a reminder that while they are often treated as such, Latinos in the United States are not a monolith, and often view their own ethnic or national identity as vastly different from that of other Latinos.

===Genetics===
An automosal DNA study published in 2019, focusing specifically on Native American ancestry in different ethnic/racial groups within the US, found that self-identified Hispanic Americans had a higher average amount of Native American ancestry compared to Black and non-Hispanic White Americans. On average, Hispanic Americans were found to be 52% European, around 38% Native American, and less than 10% African. However, these results, being an average of the entire Hispanic population, vary sharply between individuals and between regions. Hispanic participants from the West Coast and West South Central regions, where the Hispanic population is predominantly Mexican-American, had an average of 43% Native American ancestry. On the other hand, those from the Mid-Atlantic region, where the Hispanic population is predominantly of Puerto Rican or Dominican descent, averaged only 11% Native American ancestry.

===Age===
As of 2014, one third, or 17.9 million, of the Hispanic population was younger than 18 and a quarter, 14.6 million, were Millennials. This makes them more than half of the Hispanic population within the United States.

==Education==
===Hispanic K–12 education===
With the increasing Hispanic population in the United States, Hispanics have had a considerable impact on the K–12 system. In 2011–12, Hispanics comprised 24% of all enrollments in the United States, including 52% and 51% of enrollment in California and Texas, respectively. Further research shows the Hispanic population will continue to grow in the United States, implicating that more Hispanics will populate US schools.

The state of Hispanic education shows some promise. First, Hispanic students attending pre-K or kindergarten were more likely to attend full-day programs. Second, Hispanics in elementary education were the second largest group represented in gifted and talented programs. Third, Hispanics&#x27; average NAEP math and reading scores have consistently increased over the last 10 years. Finally, Hispanics were more likely than other groups, including White people, to go to college.

However, their academic achievement in early childhood, elementary, and secondary education lag behind other groups. For instance, their average math and reading NAEP scores were lower than every other group, except African Americans, and have the highest dropout rate of any group, 13% despite decreasing from 24%.

To explain these disparities, some scholars have suggested there is a Hispanic &quot;Education Crisis&quot; due to failed school and social policies. To this end, scholars have further offered several potential reasons including language barriers, poverty, and immigrant/nativity status resulting in Hispanics not performing well academically.

====English-language learners====
Currently, Hispanic students make up 80% of English-language learners in the United States. In 2008–2009, 5.3 million students were classified as English Language Learners (ELLs) in pre-K to 12th grade. This is a result of many students entering the education system at different ages, although the majority of ELLs are not foreign born. In order to provide English instruction for Hispanic students there have been a multitude of English Language programs. Schools make demands when it comes to English fluency. There are test requirements to certify students who are non-native English speakers in writing, speaking, reading, and listening, for example. They take an ELPAC test, which evaluates their English efficiency. This assessment determines whether they are considered ELL students or not. For Hispanic students, being an ELL student will have a big impact because it&#x27;s additional pressure to pass an extra exam apart from their own original classes. Furthermore, if the exam is not passed before they attend high school, the student will fall behind in their courses due to the additional ELD courses instead of taking their normal classes in that year. However, the great majority of these programs are English Immersion, which arguably undermines the students&#x27; culture and knowledge of their primary language. As such, there continues to be great debate within schools as to which program can address these language disparities.

====Immigration status====
There are more than five million ELLs from all over the world attending public schools in the United States and speaking at least 460 different languages. Undocumented immigrants have not always had access to compulsory education in the United States. However, since the landmark Supreme Court case &quot;Plyler v. Doe&quot; in 1982, immigrants have received access to K-12 education. This significantly impacted all immigrant groups, including Hispanics. However, their academic achievement is dependent upon several factors including, but not limited to time of arrival and schooling in country of origin. When non-native speakers arrive to the United States, the student not only enters a new country, language or culture, but they also enter a testing culture to determine everything from their placements to advancement into the next grade level in their education. Moreover, Hispanics&#x27; immigration/nativity status plays a major role regarding their academic achievement. For instance, first- and second- generation Hispanics outperform their later generational counterparts. Additionally, their aspirations appear to decrease as well. This has major implications on their post-secondary futures.

===Simultaneous bilingualism===
The term &quot;simultaneous bilinguals&quot;, which was coined by researcher Guadalupe Valdez, refers to individuals who acquire two languages as a &quot;first&quot; language. Most American circumstantial bilinguals acquire their ethnic or immigrant language first and then English. The period of acquisition of the second language is known as incipient bilingualism.

===Hispanic higher education===
Those with a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher ranges from 50% of Venezuelans compared to 18% for Ecuadorians 25 years and older. Amongst the largest Hispanic groups, those with a bachelor&#x27;s or higher was 25% for Cubans, 16% of Puerto Ricans, 15% of Dominicans, and 11% for Mexicans. Over 21% of all second-generation Dominican Americans have college degrees, slightly below the national average (28%) but significantly higher than US-born Mexican Americans (13%) and US-born Puerto Rican Americans (12%).

Hispanics make up the second or third largest ethnic group in Ivy League universities, considered to be the most prestigious in the United States. Hispanic enrollment at Ivy League universities has gradually increased over the years. Today, Hispanics make up between 8% of students at Yale University to 15% at Columbia University. For example, 18% of students in the Harvard University Class of 2018 are Hispanic.

Hispanics have significant enrollment in many other top universities such as University of Texas at El Paso (70% of students), Florida International University (63%), University of Miami (27%), and MIT, UCLA and UC-Berkeley at 15% each. At Stanford University, Hispanics are the third largest ethnic group behind non-Hispanic White people and Asians, at 18% of the student population.

====Hispanic university enrollments====


While Hispanics study in colleges and universities throughout the country, some choose to attend federally-designated Hispanic-serving institutions, institutions that are accredited, degree-granting, public or private nonprofit institutions of higher education with 25 percent or more total undergraduate Hispanic full-time equivalent (FTE) student enrollment. There are over 270 institutions of higher education that have been designated as an HSI.

==Health==

===Longevity===
As of 2016, life expectancy for Hispanic Americans is 81.8 years, which is higher than the life expectancy for White Americans (78.6 years). Research on the &quot;Hispanic paradox&quot;—the well-established apparent mortality advantage of Hispanic Americans compared to White Americans, despite the latter&#x27;s more advantaged socioeconomic status—has been principally explained by &quot;(1) health-related migration to and from the US; and (2) social and cultural protection mechanisms, such as maintenance of healthy lifestyles and behaviors adopted in the countries of origin, and availability of extensive social networks in the US.&quot; The &quot;salmon bias&quot; hypothesis, which suggests that the Hispanic health advantage is attributable to higher rates of return migration among less-healthy migrants, has received some support in the scholarly literature. A 2019 study, examining the comparatively better health of foreign-born American Hispanics, challenged the hypothesis that a stronger orientation toward the family (familism) contributed to this advantage. Some scholars have suggested that the Hispanic mortality advantage is likely to disappear due to the higher rates of obesity and diabetes among Hispanics relative to White people, although lower rates of smoking (and thus smoking-attributable mortality) among Hispanics may counteract this to some extent.

===Healthcare===
As of 2017, about 19% of Hispanic Americans lack health insurance coverage, which is the highest of all ethnic groups except for Indigenous Americans and Alaska Natives. In terms of extending health coverage, Hispanics benefited the most among US ethnic groups from the Affordable Care Act (ACA); among non-elderly Hispanics, the uninsured rate declined from 26.7% in 2013 to 14.2% in 2017. Among the population of non-elderly uninsured Hispanic population in 2017, about 53% were non-citizens, about 39% were US-born citizens, and about 9% were naturalized citizens. (The ACA does not help undocumented immigrants or legal immigrants with less than five years&#x27; residence in the United States gain coverage).

According to a 2013 study, Mexican women have the highest uninsured rate (54.6%) as compared to other immigrants (26.2%), Black (22.5%) and White (13.9%). According to the study, Mexican women are the largest female immigrant group in the United States and are also the most at risk for developing preventable health conditions. Multiple factors such as limited access to health care, legal status and income increase the risk of developing preventable health conditions because many undocumented immigrants postpone routine visits to the doctor until they become seriously ill.

==Mental health==

===Family separation===
Some families who are in the process of illegally crossing borders can suffer being caught and separated by border patrol agents. Migrants are also in danger of separation if they do not bring sufficient resources such as water for all members to continue crossing. Once illegal migrants have arrived to the new country, they may fear workplace raids where illegal immigrants are detained and deported.

Family separation puts US-born children, undocumented children and their illegal immigrant parents at risk for depression and family maladaptive syndrome. The effects are often long-term and the impact extends to the community level. Children may experience emotional traumas and long-term changes in behaviors. Additionally, when parents are forcefully removed, children often develop feelings of abandonment and they might blame themselves for what has happened to their family. Some children that are victims to illegal border crossings that result in family separation believe in the possibility of never seeing their parents again. These effects can cause negative parent-child attachment. Reunification may be difficult because of immigration laws and re-entry restrictions which further affect the mental health of children and parents. Parents who leave their home country also experience negative mental health experiences. According to a study published in 2013, 46% of Mexican migrant men who participated in the study reported elevated levels of depressive symptoms. In recent years, the length of stay for migrants has increased, from 3 years to nearly a decade. Migrants who were separated from their families, either married or single, experienced greater depression than married men accompanied by their spouses. Furthermore, the study also revealed that men who are separated from their families are more prone to harsher living conditions such as overcrowded housing and are under a greater deal of pressure to send remittance to support their families. These conditions put additional stress on the migrants and often worsen their depression. Families who migrated together experience better living conditions, receive emotional encouragement and motivation from each other, and share a sense of solidarity. They are also more likely to successfully navigate the employment and health care systems in the new country, and are not pressured to send remittances back home.

===Vulnerabilities===
The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 significantly changed how the United States dealt with immigration. Under this new law, immigrants who overstayed their visas or were found to be in the United States illegally were subject to be detained and/or deported without legal representation. Immigrants who broke these laws may not be allowed back into the country. Similarly, this law made it more difficult for other immigrants who want to enter the United States or gain legal status. These laws also expanded the types of offenses that can be considered worthy of deportation for documented immigrants. Policies enacted by future presidents further limit the number of immigrants entering the country and their expedited removal.

Many illegal immigrant families cannot enjoy doing everyday activities without exercising caution because they fear encountering immigration officers which limits their involvement in community events. Undocumented families also do not trust government institutions and services. Because of their fear of encountering immigration officers, illegal immigrants often feel ostracized and isolated which can lead to the development of mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. The harmful effects of being ostracized from the rest of society are not limited to just that of undocumented immigrants but it affects the entire family even if some of the members are of legal status. Children often reported having been victims of bullying in school by classmates because their parents are undocumented. This can cause them to feel isolated and develop a sense of inferiority which can negatively impact their academic performance.

===Stress===
Despite the struggles Hispanic families encounter, they have found ways to keep motivated. Many immigrants use religion as a source of motivation. Mexican immigrants believed that the difficulties they face are a part of God&#x27;s bigger plan and believe their life will get better in the end. They kept their faith strong and pray every day, hoping that God will keep their families safe. Immigrants participate in church services and bond with other immigrants that share the same experiences. Undocumented Hispanics also find support from friends, family and the community that serve as coping mechanisms. Some Hispanics state that their children are the reason they have the strength to keep on going. They want their children to have a future and give them things they are not able to have themselves. The community is able to provide certain resources that immigrant families need such as tutoring for their children, financial assistance and counseling services. Some identified that maintaining a positive mental attitude helped them cope with the stresses they experience. Many immigrants refuse to live their life in constant fear which leads to depression in order to enjoy life in the United States. Since many immigrants have unstable sources of income, many plan ahead in order to prevent future financial stress. They put money aside and find ways to save money instead of spend it such as learning to fix appliances themselves.

===Poverty===
Many Hispanic families migrate to find better economic opportunities in order to send remittances back home. Being undocumented limits the possibilities of jobs that immigrants undertake and many struggle to find a stable job. Many Hispanics report that companies turned them down because they do not have a Social Security number. If they are able to obtain a job, immigrants risk losing it if their employer finds out they are unable to provide proof of residency or citizenship. Many look towards agencies that do not ask for identification, but those jobs are often unreliable. In order to prevent themselves from being detained and deported, many have to work under exploitation. In a study, a participant reported &quot;If someone knows that you don&#x27;t have the papers ... that person is a danger. Many people will con them ... if they know you don&#x27;t have the papers, with everything they say &#x27;hey I&#x27;m going to call immigration on you.&#x27;&quot;. These conditions lower the income that Hispanic families bring to their household and some find living each day very difficult. When an undocumented parent is deported or detained, income will be lowered significantly if the other parent also supports the family financially. The parent who is left has to look after the family and might find working difficult to manage along with other responsibilities. Even if families are not separated, Hispanics are constantly living in fear that they will lose their economic footing.

Living in poverty has been linked to depression, low self-esteem, loneliness, crime activities and frequent drug use among youth. Families with low incomes are unable to afford adequate housing and some of them are evicted. The environment in which the children of undocumented immigrants grow up in is often composed of poor air quality, noise, and toxins which prevent healthy development. Furthermore, these neighborhoods are prone to violence and gang activities, forcing the families to live in constant fear which can contribute to the development of PTSD, aggression and depression.

==Economic outlook==

===Median income===
In 2017, the US census reported the median household incomes of Hispanic Americans to be $50,486. This is the third consecutive annual increase in median household income for Hispanic-origin households.

===Poverty===
According to the US census, the poverty rate Hispanics was 18.3 percent in 2017, down from 19.4 percent in 2016. Hispanics accounted for 10.8 million individuals in poverty. In comparison, the average poverty rates in 2017 for non-Hispanic White Americans was 8.7 percent with 17 million individuals in poverty, Asian Americans was 10.0 percent with 2 million individuals in poverty, and African Americans was 21.2 percent with 9 million individuals in poverty.

Among the largest Hispanic groups during 2015 was: Honduran Americans &amp; Dominican Americans (27%), Guatemalan Americans (26%), Puerto Ricans (24%), Mexican Americans (23%), Salvadoran Americans (20%), Cuban Americans and Venezuelan Americans (17%), Ecuadorian Americans (15%), Nicaraguan Americans (14%), Colombian Americans (13%), Argentinian Americans (11%), and Peruvian Americans (10%).

Poverty affects many underrepresented students as racial/ethnic minorities tend to stay isolated within pockets of low-income communities. This results in several inequalities, such as &quot;school offerings, teacher quality, curriculum, counseling and all manner of things that both keep students engaged in school and prepare them to graduate&quot;. In the case of Hispanics, the poverty rate for Hispanic children in 2004 was 28.6 percent. Moreover, with this lack of resources, schools reproduce these inequalities for generations to come. In order to assuage poverty, many Hispanic families can turn to social and community services as resources.
==Cultural matters==


The geographic, political, social, economic and racial diversity of Hispanic Americans makes all Hispanics very different depending on their family heritage and/or national origin. Many times, there are many cultural similarities between Hispanics from neighboring countries than from more distant countries, i.e. Spanish Caribbean, Southern Cone, Central America etc. Yet several features tend to unite Hispanics from these diverse backgrounds.

=== Language ===
====Spanish====
As one of the most important uniting factors of Hispanic Americans, Spanish is an important part of Hispanic culture. Teaching Spanish to children is often one of the most valued skills taught amongst Hispanic families. Spanish is not only closely tied with the person&#x27;s family, heritage, and overall culture, but valued for increased opportunities in business and one&#x27;s future professional career. A 2013 Pew Research survey showed that 95% of Hispanics adults said &quot;it&#x27;s important that future generations of Hispanics speak Spanish&quot;. Given the United States&#x27; proximity to other Spanish-speaking countries, Spanish is being passed on to future American generations. Amongst second-generation Hispanics, 80% speak fluent Spanish, and amongst third-generation Hispanics, 40% speak fluent Spanish. Spanish is also the most popular language taught in the United States.

Hispanics have revived the Spanish language in the United States, first brought to North America during the Spanish colonial period in the 16th century. Spanish is the oldest European language in the United States, spoken uninterruptedly for four and a half centuries, since the founding of Saint Augustine, Florida in 1565. Today, 90% of all Hispanics speak English, and at least 78% speak fluent Spanish. Additionally, 2.8 million non-Hispanic Americans also speak Spanish at home for a total of 41.1 million.

With 40% of Hispanic Americans being immigrants, and with many of the 60% who are US-born being the children or grandchildren of immigrants, bilingualism is the norm in the community at large. At home, at least 69% of all Hispanics over the age of five are bilingual in English and Spanish, whereas up to 22% are monolingual English-speakers, and 9% are monolingual Spanish speakers. Another 0.4% speak a language other than English and Spanish at home.

====American Spanish dialects====

The Spanish dialects spoken in the United States differ depending on the country of origin of the person or the person&#x27;s family heritage. However, generally, Spanish spoken in the Southwest is Mexican Spanish or Chicano Spanish. A variety of Spanish native to the Southwest spoken by descendants of the early Spanish colonists in New Mexico and Colorado is known as Traditional New Mexican Spanish. One of the major distinctions of Traditional New Mexican Spanish is its use of distinct vocabulary and grammatical forms that make New Mexican Spanish unique amongst Spanish dialects. The Spanish spoken in the East Coast is generally Caribbean Spanish and is heavily influenced by the Spanish of Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico. Isleño Spanish, descended from Canarian Spanish, is the historic Spanish dialect spoken by the descendants of the earliest Spanish colonists beginning in the 18th century in Louisiana. Spanish spoken elsewhere throughout the country varies, although is generally Mexican Spanish.

Heritage Spanish speakers tend to speak Spanish with near-native level phonology, but a more limited command of morphosyntax. Hispanics who speak Spanish as a second language often speak with English accents.

====Spanglish and English dialects====


Hispanics have influenced the way Americans speak with the introduction of many Spanish words into the English language. Amongst younger generations of Hispanics, Spanglish, a term for any mix of Spanish and English, is common in speaking. As they are fluent in both languages, speakers will often switch between Spanish and English throughout the conversation. Spanglish is particularly common in Hispanic-majority cities and communities such as Miami, Hialeah, San Antonio, Los Angeles and parts of New York City.

Hispanics have also influenced the way English is spoken in the United States. In Miami, for example, the Miami dialect has evolved as the most common form of English spoken and heard in Miami today. This is a native dialect of English, and was developed amongst second and third generations of Cuban Americans in Miami. Today, it is commonly heard everywhere throughout the city. Gloria Estefan and Enrique Iglesias are examples of people who speak with the Miami dialect. Another major English dialect, is spoken by Chicanos and Tejanos in the Southwestern United States, called Chicano English. George Lopez and Selena are examples of speakers of Chicano English. An English dialect spoken by Puerto Ricans and other Hispanic groups is called New York Latino English; Jennifer Lopez and Cardi B are examples of people who speak with the New York Latino dialect.

When speaking in English, American Hispanics may often insert Spanish tag and filler items such as , , and , into sentences as a marker of ethnic identity and solidarity. The same often occurs with grammatical words like .

===Religion===
According to a Pew Center study which was conducted in 2019, the majority of Hispanic Americans are Christians (72%), Among American Hispanics, as of 2018–19, 47% are Catholic, 24% are Protestant, 1% are Mormon, less than 1% are Orthodox Christian, 3% are members of non-Christian faiths, and 23% are unaffiliated. The proportion of Hispanics who are Catholic has dropped from 2009 (when it was 57%), while the proportion of unaffiliated Hispanics has increased since 2009 (when it was 15%). Among Hispanic Protestant community, most are evangelical, but some belong to mainline denominations. Compared to Catholic, unaffiliated, and mainline Protestant Hispanics; Evangelical Protestant Hispanics are substantially more likely to attend services weekly, pray daily, and adhere to biblical liberalism. As of 2014, about 67% of Hispanic Protestants and about 52% of Hispanic Catholics were renewalist, meaning that they described themselves as Pentecosal or charismatic Christians (in the Catholic tradition, called Catholic charismatic renewal).

Catholic affiliation is much higher among first-generation Hispanic immigrants than it is among second and third-generation Hispanic immigrants, who exhibit a fairly high rate of conversion to Protestantism or the unaffiliated camp. According to Andrew Greeley, as many as 600,000 American Hispanics leave Catholicism for Protestant churches every year, and this figure is much higher in Texas and Florida. Hispanic Catholics are developing youth and social programs to retain members.

Hispanics make up a substantial proportion (almost 40%) of Catholics in the United States, although the number of American Hispanic priests is low relative to Hispanic membership in the church. In 2019, José Horacio Gómez, Archbishop of Los Angeles and a naturalized American citizen born in Mexico, was elected as president of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops.

===Media===

The United States is home to thousands of Spanish-language media outlets, which range in size from giant commercial and some non-commercial broadcasting networks and major magazines with circulations numbering in the millions, to low-power AM radio stations with listeners numbering in the hundreds. There are hundreds of Internet media outlets targeting US Hispanic consumers. Some of the outlets are online versions of their printed counterparts and some online exclusively.

Increased use of Spanish-language media leads to increased levels of group consciousness, according to survey data. The differences in attitudes are due to the diverging goals of Spanish-language and English-language media. The effect of using Spanish-language media serves to promote a sense of group consciousness among Hispanics by reinforcing roots in the Hispanic world and the commonalities among Hispanics of varying national origin.

The first Hispanic-American owned major film studio in the United States is based in Atlanta, Georgia. In 2017, Ozzie and Will Areu purchased Tyler Perry&#x27;s former studio to establish Areu Bros. Studios.

====Radio====
Spanish language radio is the largest non-English broadcasting media. While other foreign language broadcasting declined steadily, Spanish broadcasting grew steadily from the 1920s to the 1970s. The 1930s were boom years. The early success depended on the concentrated geographical audience in Texas and the Southwest. American stations were close to Mexico which enabled a steady circular flow of entertainers, executives and technicians, and stimulated the creative initiatives of Hispanic radio executives, brokers, and advertisers. Ownership was increasingly concentrated in the 1960s and 1970s. The industry sponsored the now-defunct trade publication &quot;Sponsor&quot; from the late 1940s to 1968. Spanish-language radio has influenced American and Hispanic discourse on key current affairs issues such as citizenship and immigration.

====Networks====
Notable Hispanic-oriented media outlets include:
* CNN en Español, a Spanish-language news network based in Atlanta, Georgia;
* ESPN Deportes and Fox Deportes, two Spanish-language sports television networks.
* Telemundo, the second-largest Spanish-language television network in the United States, with affiliates in nearly every major U.S. market, and numerous affiliates internationally;

* &quot;Vida Latina&quot;, a Spanish-language entertainment magazine distributed throughout the Southern United States

===Sports and music===
Because of different cultures throughout the Hispanic world, there are various music forms throughout Hispanic countries, with different sounds and origins. Reggaeton and hip hop are genres that are most popular to Hispanic youth in the United States. Recently Latin trap, trap corridos, and Dominican dembow have gained popularity.

Soccer is a common sport for Hispanics from outside of the Caribbean region, particularly immigrants. Baseball is a common among Caribbean Hispanics. Other popular sports include boxing, gridiron football, and basketball.

===Cuisine===
Hispanic food, particularly Mexican food, has influenced American cuisine and eating habits. Mexican cuisine has become mainstream in American culture. Across the United States, tortillas and salsa are arguably becoming as common as hamburger buns and ketchup. Tortilla chips have surpassed potato chips in annual sales, and plantain chips popular in Caribbean cuisines have continued to increase sales. The avocado has been described as &quot;America&#x27;s new favorite fruit&quot;; its largest market within the US is among Hispanic Americans.

Due to the large Mexican-American population in the Southwestern United States, and its proximity to Mexico, Mexican food there is believed to be some of the best in the United States. Cubans brought Cuban cuisine to Miami and today, cortaditos, pastelitos de guayaba and empanadas are common mid-day snacks in the city. Cuban culture has changed Miami&#x27;s coffee drinking habits, and today a café con leche or a cortadito is commonly had at one of the city&#x27;s numerous coffee shops. The Cuban sandwich, developed in Miami, is now a staple and icon of the city&#x27;s cuisine and culture.

===Familial situations===

====Family life and values====
Hispanic culture places a strong value on family, and is commonly taught to Hispanic children as one of the most important values in life. Statistically, Hispanic families tend to have larger and closer knit families than the American average. Hispanic families tend to prefer to live near other family members. This may mean that three or sometimes four generations may be living in the same household or near each other, although four generations is uncommon in the United States. The role of grandparents is believed to be very important in the upbringing of children.

Hispanics tend to be very group-oriented, and an emphasis is placed on the well-being of the family above the individual. The extended family plays an important part of many Hispanic families, and frequent social, family gatherings are common. Traditional rites of passages, particularly Roman Catholic sacraments: such as baptisms, birthdays, first Holy Communions, quinceañeras, Confirmations, graduations and weddings are all popular moments of family gatherings and celebrations in Hispanic families.

Education is another important priority for Hispanic families. Education is seen as the key towards continued upward mobility in the United States among Hispanic families. A 2010 study by the Associated Press showed that Hispanics place a higher emphasis on education than the average American. Hispanics expect their children to graduate university.

Hispanic youth today stay at home with their parents longer than before. This is due to more years spent studying and the difficulty of finding a paid job that meets their aspirations.

====Intermarriage====

Hispanic Americans, like many immigrant groups before them, are out-marrying at high rates. Out-marriages comprised 17.4% of all existing Hispanic marriages in 2008. The rate was higher for newlyweds (which excludes immigrants who are already married): Among all newlyweds in 2010, 25.7% of all Hispanics married a non-Hispanic (this compares to out-marriage rates of 9.4% of White people, 17.1% of Black people, and 27.7% of Asians). The rate was larger for native-born Hispanics, with 36.2% of native-born Hispanics (both men and women) out-marrying compared to 14.2% of foreign-born Hispanics. The difference is attributed to recent immigrants tending to marry within their immediate immigrant community due to commonality of language, proximity, familial connections, and familiarity.

In 2008, 81% of Hispanics who married out married non-Hispanic White people, 9% married non-Hispanic Black people, 5% non-Hispanic Asians, and the remainder married non-Hispanic, multi-racial partners.

Of approximately 275,500 new interracial or interethnic marriages in 2010, 43.3% were White-Hispanic (compared to White-Asian at 14.4%, White-Black at 11.9%, and other combinations at 30.4%; &quot;other combinations&quot; consists of pairings between different minority groups and multi-racial people). Unlike those for marriage to Black people and Asians, intermarriage rates of Hispanics to White people do not vary by gender. The combined median earnings of White/Hispanic couples are lower than those of White/White couples but higher than those of Hispanic/Hispanic couples. 23% of Hispanic men who married White women have a college degree compared to only 10% of Hispanic men who married a Hispanic woman. 33% of Hispanic women who married a White husband are college-educated compared to 13% of Hispanic women who married a Hispanic man.

Attitudes among non-Hispanics toward intermarriage with Hispanics are mostly favorable, with 81% of White people, 76% of Asians and 73% of Black people &quot;being fine&quot; with a member of their family marrying a Hispanic and an additional 13% of White people, 19% of Asians and 16% of Black people &quot;being bothered but accepting of the marriage&quot;. Only 2% of White people, 4% of Asians, and 5% of Black people would not accept a marriage of their family member to a Hispanic.

Hispanic attitudes toward intermarriage with non-Hispanics are likewise favorable, with 81% &quot;being fine&quot; with marriages to White people and 73% &quot;being fine&quot; with marriages to Black people. A further 13% admitted to &quot;being bothered but accepting&quot; of a marriage of a family member to a White and 22% admitted to &quot;being bothered but accepting&quot; of a marriage of a family member to a Black. Only 5% of Hispanics objected outright marriage of a family member to a non-Hispanic Black and 2% to a non-Hispanic White.

Unlike intermarriage with other racial groups, intermarriage with non-Hispanic Black people varies by nationality of origin. Puerto Ricans have by far the highest rates of intermarriage with Black people, of all major Hispanic national groups, who also has the highest overall intermarriage rate among Hispanics. Cubans have the highest rate of intermarriage with non-Hispanic White people, of all major Hispanic national groups, and are the most assimilated into White American culture.

===Cultural adjustment===
As Hispanic migrants become the norm in the United States, the effects of this migration on the identity of these migrants and their kin becomes most evident in the younger generations. Crossing the borders changes the identities of both the youth and their families. Often &quot;one must pay special attention to the role expressive culture plays as both entertainment and as a site in which identity is played out, empowered, and reformed&quot; because it is &quot;sometimes in opposition to dominant norms and practices and sometimes in conjunction with them&quot;. The exchange of their culture of origin with American culture creates a dichotomy within the values that the youth find important, therefore changing what it means to be Hispanic in the global sphere.

====Transnationalism====
Along with feeling that they are neither from the country of their ethnic background nor the United States, a new identity within the United States is formed called &quot;latinidad&quot;. This is especially seen in cosmopolitan social settings like New York City, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Underway is &quot;the intermeshing of different Latino subpopulations has laid the foundations for the emergence and ongoing evolution of a strong sense of &quot;latinidad&quot;&quot; which establishes a &quot;sense of cultural affinity and identity deeply rooted in what many Hispanics perceive to be a shared historical, spiritual, aesthetic and linguistic heritage, and a growing sense of cultural affinity and solidarity in the social context of the United States.&quot; This unites Hispanics as one, creating cultural kin with other Hispanic ethnicities.

====Gender roles====
In a 1998 study of Mexican Americans it was found that males were more likely to endorse the notion than men should be the sole breadwinners of the family, while Mexican American women did not endorse this notion.

Prior to the 1960s countercultural movement, Mexican men often felt an exaggerated need to be the sole breadwinner of their families. There are two sides to machismo, the man who has a strong work ethic and lives up to his responsibilities, or the man who heavily drinks and therefore displays acts of unpleasant behavior towards his family.

The traditional roles of women in a Hispanic community are of housewife and mother, a woman&#x27;s role is to cook, clean, and care for her children and husband; putting herself and her needs last. The typical structure of a Hispanic family forces women to defer authority to her husband, allowing him to make the important decisions, that both the woman and children must abide by. In traditional Hispanic households, women and young girls are homebodies or &quot;muchachas de la casa&quot; (&quot;girls of the house&quot;), showing that they abide &quot;by the cultural norms ... [of] respectability, chastity, and family honor [as] valued by the [Hispanic] community&quot;.

Migration to the United States can change the identity of Hispanic youth in various ways, including how they carry their gendered identities. However, when Hispanic women come to the United States, they tend to adapt to the perceived social norms of this new country and their social location changes as they become more independent and able to live without the financial support of their families or partners. The unassimilated community views these adapting women as being &quot;de la calle&quot; (&quot;of [or from] the street&quot;), transgressive, and sexually promiscuous. A women&#x27;s motive for pursuing an education or career is to prove she can care and make someone of herself, breaking the traditional gender role that a Hispanic woman can only serve as a mother or housewife, thus changing a woman&#x27;s role in society. Some Hispanic families in the United States &quot;deal with young women&#x27;s failure to adhere to these culturally prescribed norms of proper gendered behavior in a variety of ways, including sending them to live in ... [the sending country] with family members, regardless of whether or not ... [the young women] are sexually active&quot;. Now there has been a rise in the Hispanic community where both men and women are known to work and split the household chores among themselves; women are encouraged to gain an education, degree, and pursue a career.

====Sexuality====
According to polling data released in 2022, 11% of Hispanic American adults identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. This is more than twice the rate of White Americans or African Americans. Over 20% of Hispanic Millennials and Gen Z claimed an LGBT identity. The growth of the young Hispanic population is driving an increase of the LGBT community in the United States. Studies have shown that Hispanic Americans are over-represented among transgender people in the United States.

According to Gattamorta, et al. (2018), the socially constructed notion of machismo reinforces male gender roles in Hispanic culture, which can lead to internalized homophobia in Hispanic gay men and increase mental health issues and suicidal ideation. However, according to Reyes Salinas, more recent research shows that there has been an explosive growth of LGBT self-identification among young Hispanic Americans, which may signal that the Hispanic attitudes towards LGBT have broken down. According to Marina Franco, polling conducted in 2022 suggests that the Hispanic community in America is largely accepting of LGBT people and gay marriage, which is significant in light of the rapid growth of LGBT self-identification among Hispanics.

===Relations with other minority groups===
As a result of the rapid growth of the Hispanic population, there has been some tension with other minority populations, especially the African-American population, as Hispanics have increasingly moved into once exclusively Black areas. There has also been increasing cooperation between minority groups to work together to attain political influence.
* A 2007 UCLA study reported that 51% of Black people felt that Hispanics were taking jobs and political power from them and 44% of Hispanics said they feared African-Americans, identifying them (African-Americans) with high crime rates. That said, large majorities of Hispanics credited American Black people and the civil rights movement with making life easier for them in the United States.
* A Pew Research Center poll from 2006 showed that Black people overwhelmingly felt that Hispanic immigrants were hard working (78%) and had strong family values (81%); 34% believed that immigrants took jobs from Americans, 22% of Black people believed that they had directly lost a job to an immigrant, and 34% of Black people wanted immigration to be curtailed. The report also surveyed three cities: Chicago (with its well-established Hispanic community); Washington, D.C. (with a less-established but quickly growing Hispanic community); and Raleigh-Durham (with a very new but rapidly growing Hispanic community). The results showed that a significant proportion of Black people in those cities wanted immigration to be curtailed: Chicago (46%), Raleigh-Durham (57%), and Washington, DC (48%).
* Per a 2008 University of California, Berkeley Law School research brief, a recurring theme to Black/Hispanic tensions is the growth in &quot;contingent, flexible, or contractor labor&quot;, which is increasingly replacing long term steady employment for jobs on the lower-rung of the pay scale (which had been disproportionately filled by Black people). The transition to this employment arrangement corresponds directly with the growth in the Hispanic immigrant population. The perception is that this new labor arrangement has driven down wages, removed benefits, and rendered temporary, jobs that once were stable (but also benefiting consumers who receive lower-cost services) while passing the costs of labor (healthcare and indirectly education) onto the community at large.
* A 2008 Gallup poll indicated that 60% of Hispanics and 67% of Black people believe that good relations exist between US Black people and Hispanics while only 29% of Black people, 36% of Hispanics and 43% of White people, say Black–Hispanic relations are bad.
* In 2009, in Los Angeles County, Hispanics committed 30% of the hate crimes against Black victims and Black people committed 70% of the hate crimes against Hispanics.

==Politics==


===Political affiliations===


Hispanics differ on their political views depending on their location and background. The majority (57%) either identify as or support the Democrats, and 23% identify as Republicans. This 34-point gap as of December 2007 was an increase from the gap of 21 points 16 months earlier. While traditionally a key Democratic Party constituency at-large, beginning in the early 2010s, Hispanics have begun to split between the Democrats and the Republican Party. In a 2022 study, it was found that 64% of Latinos surveyed had positive attitudes towards President Obama&#x27;s executive actions on immigration, which was notably four percentage points lower than that of non-Hispanic Black respondents. It was also noted that support for undocumented immigrants was lowest among Latinos living in developing &#x27;bedroom communities&#x27; or newly built suburbs designed for commuters. This was also the case for Latinos of affluent income levels, however they were still most likely to display a positive attitude towards undocumented immigrants, especially when compared to their non-Hispanic White counterparts.

Cuban Americans, Colombian Americans, Chilean Americans, and Venezuelan Americans tend to favor conservative political ideologies and support the Republicans. Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Dominican Americans tend to favor progressive political ideologies and support the Democrats. However, because the latter groups are far more numerous—as, again, Mexican Americans alone are 64% of Hispanics—the Democratic Party is considered to be in a far stronger position with the ethnic group overall.

Some political organizations associated with Hispanic Americans are League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), the National Council of La Raza (NCLR), the United Farm Workers, the Cuban American National Foundation and the National Institute for Latino Policy.

===Political impact===


The United States has a population of over 60 million of Hispanic Americans, of whom 27 million are citizens eligible to vote (13% of total eligible voters); therefore, Hispanics have a very important effect on presidential elections since the vote difference between two main parties is usually around 4%.

====Elections of 1986–1996====
During the 1986 midterm elections, Hispanic voter turnout was increasing, although it remained lower compared to other demographic groups. The political concerns of Hispanic communities during this period included immigration reform and civil rights, with modest gains for Latino candidates at state and local levels. In the 1988 presidential election, George H.W. Bush (Republican) and Michael Dukakis (Democrat) were the main contenders, and although Hispanic voters were becoming more engaged, their influence was still emerging. The 1990 Census highlighted the substantial growth of Hispanic populations in the United States, leading to greater attention from political parties to Hispanic issues and concerns.

The 1992 presidential election marked a significant shift as Bill Clinton (Democrat) engaged actively with Hispanic voters, resulting in increased Latino support and signaling a broader Democratic outreach. Clinton&#x27;s administration would further stimulate Hispanic political activity. The 1994 midterm elections saw Republican gains and were significantly impacted by debates over immigration and welfare reform, including California&#x27;s Proposition 187, which sought to limit public services for undocumented immigrants and mobilized many Latino voters.

By the 1996 presidential election, Bill Clinton&#x27;s successful re-election campaign reflected the growing influence of Hispanic voters. Key issues for the Latino community during this time included immigration, education, and healthcare. The period also witnessed an increase in Latino representation in Congress with figures such as Bob Menendez and Luis Gutiérrez emerging as prominent leaders. Overall, the period from 1986 to 1996 marked a critical phase in the evolving political influence and representation of Hispanic and Latino Americans in the United States.

====Elections of 1996–2006====
In the 1996 presidential election, 72% of Hispanics backed President Bill Clinton. In 2000, the Democratic total fell to 62%, and went down again in 2004, with Democrat John Kerry winning Hispanics 54–44 against Bush. Hispanics in the West, especially in California, were much stronger for the Democratic Party than in Texas and Florida. California Hispanics voted 63–32 for Kerry in 2004, and both Arizona and New Mexico Hispanics by a smaller 56–43 margin. Texas Hispanics were split nearly evenly, favoring Kerry 50–49 over their favorite son candidate and Florida Hispanics (who are mostly Cuban American) backed Bush, by a 54–45 margin.

In 1998, California Proposition 227, which sought to eliminate bilingual education in public schools, was passed. This initiative highlighted the political mobilization of Latino communities and their influence on educational policy in California.

The 2000 presidential election was notably close, with George W. Bush winning the presidency over Al Gore. Bush&#x27;s outreach to Hispanic voters, particularly in battleground states such as Florida, was a significant factor in his narrow victory. Despite the growing visibility of Hispanic candidates, their representation at the national level remained limited. By the 2002 midterm elections, there was a notable increase in Hispanic representation in Congress, with more Latino candidates successfully winning seats in the House of Representatives. This trend continued to grow, reflecting the expanding political engagement of Hispanic Americans. In the 2004 presidential election, George W. Bush was re-elected, with a notable increase in Hispanic support attributed to his campaign&#x27;s targeted outreach efforts. Prominent Latino figures, including New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson and U.S. Senators Ken Salazar, gained national recognition during this period.

In the 2006 midterm election, however, due to the unpopularity of the Iraq War, the heated debate concerning illegal Hispanic immigration and Republican-related Congressional scandals, Hispanics went as strongly Democratic as they have since the Clinton years. Exit polls showed the group voting for Democrats by a lopsided 69–30 margin, with Florida Hispanics for the first time split evenly.

The runoff election in Texas&#x27; 23rd congressional district was seen as a bellwether of Hispanic politics. Democrat Ciro Rodriguez&#x27;s unexpected (and unexpectedly decisive) defeat of Republican incumbent Henry Bonilla was seen as proof of a leftward lurch among Hispanic voters; majority-Hispanic counties overwhelmingly backed Rodriguez and majority European-American counties overwhelmingly backed Bonilla.

====Elections 2008–2012====
In the 2008 Presidential election&#x27;s Democratic primary, Hispanics participated in larger numbers than before, with Hillary Clinton receiving most of the group&#x27;s support. Pundits discussed whether Hispanics would not vote for Barack Obama because he was African-American. Hispanics voted 2 to 1 for Mrs. Clinton, even among the younger demographic. In other groups, younger voters went overwhelmingly for Obama. Among Hispanics, 28% said race was involved in their decision, as opposed to 13% for (non-Hispanic) White people. Obama defeated Clinton.

In the matchup between Obama and Republican candidate John McCain, Hispanics supported Obama with 59% to McCain&#x27;s 29% in the June 30 Gallup tracking poll. This was higher than expected, since McCain had been a leader of the comprehensive immigration reform effort (John McCain was born in Panama to parents who were serving in the US Navy, but raised in the United States). However, McCain had retreated from reform during the Republican primary, damaging his standing among Hispanics. Obama took advantage of the situation by running ads in Spanish highlighting McCain&#x27;s reversal.

In the general election, 67% of Hispanics voted for Obama. with a relatively strong turnout in states such as Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada and Virginia, helping Obama carry those formerly Republican states. Obama won 70% of non-Cuban Hispanics and 35% of the traditionally Republican Cuban Americans who have a strong presence in Florida. The relative growth of non-Cuban vs Cuban Hispanics also contributed to his carrying Florida&#x27;s Hispanics with 57% of the vote.

While employment and the economy were top concerns for Hispanics, almost 90% of Hispanic voters rated immigration as &quot;somewhat important&quot; or &quot;very important&quot; in a poll taken after the election. Republican opposition to the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 had damaged the party&#x27;s appeal to Hispanics, especially in swing states such as Florida, Nevada and New Mexico. In a Gallup poll of Hispanic voters taken in the final days of June 2008, only 18% of participants identified as Republicans. The 2010 midterm elections highlighted the growing influence of Hispanic Americans in U.S. politics. Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, won a Senate seat, enhancing the visibility of Latino politicians in national politics.

Hispanics voted even more heavily for Democrats in the 2012 election with the Democratic incumbent Barack Obama receiving 71% and the Republican challenger Mitt Romney receiving about 27% of the vote. Some Hispanic leaders were offended by remarks Romney made during a fundraiser, when he suggested that cultural differences and &quot;the hand of providence&quot; help explain why Israelis are more economically successful than Palestinians, and why similar economic disparities exist between other neighbors, such as the United States and Mexico, or Chile and Ecuador. A senior aide to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas called the remarks racist, as did American political scientist Angelo Falcón, president of the National Institute of Latino Policy. Mitt Romney&#x27;s father was born to American parents in a Mormon colony in Chihuahua, Mexico. The Hispanic vote was crucial to Obama&#x27;s re-election, particularly in swing states such as Florida, Colorado, and Nevada. The Obama campaign&#x27;s focus on issues important to Latino voters, including immigration reform and healthcare, helped secure substantial support from the Hispanic community.

====Elections 2014–2022====


&quot;More convincing data&quot; from the 2016 United States presidential election from the polling firm Latino Decisions indicates that Clinton received a higher share of the Hispanic vote, and Trump a lower share, than the Edison exit polls showed. Using wider, more geographically and linguistically representative sampling, Latino Decisions concluded that Clinton won 79% of Hispanic voters (also an improvement over Obama&#x27;s share in 2008 and 2012), while Trump won only 18% (lower than previous Republicans such as Romney and McCain). Additionally, the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study found that Clinton&#x27;s share of the Hispanic vote was one percentage point higher than Obama&#x27;s in 2012, while Trump&#x27;s was seven percentage points lower than Romney&#x27;s. Trump&#x27;s campaign was marked by controversial statements and policies regarding immigration, which galvanized Latino voters.

On June 26, 2018, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a millennial, won the Democratic primary in New York&#x27;s 14th congressional district covering parts of The Bronx and Queens in New York City, defeating the incumbent, Democratic Caucus Chair Joe Crowley, in what has been described as the biggest upset victory in the 2018 midterm election season and at the age of 29 years, became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. She is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America and has been endorsed by various politically progressive organizations and individuals. According to a Pew Research Center report, the 2020 election will be the first one when Hispanics are the largest racial or ethnic minority group in the electorate. A record 32 million Hispanics were projected to be eligible to vote in the presidential election, many of them first-time voters. On September 15, 2020, President Donald J. Trump announced his intent to nominate and appoint Eduardo Verastegui, to be a member of the President&#x27;s Advisory Commission on Hispanic Prosperity if re-elected after days of the Democratic convention.

Hispanic communities across the United States were long held as a single voting bloc, but economic, geographic and cultural differences show stark divides in how Hispanic Americans have cast their ballots in 2020. Hispanics helped deliver Florida to Donald Trump in part because of Cuban Americans and Venezuelan Americans (along with smaller populations such as Nicaraguan Americans and Chilean Americans); President Trump&#x27;s reelection campaign ran pushing a strong anti-socialism message as a strategy in Florida, to their success. However the perceived anti-immigrant rhetoric resonated with Mexican Americans in Arizona and the COVID-19 pandemic (Arizona being one of the states hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States). Many Latino voters in Nevada are members of the Culinary Union Local 226 and supported Biden based on Right-to-work standards. The takeaway may be this may be the last election cycle that the &quot;Hispanic vote&quot; as a whole is more talked about instead of particular communities within it, such as Cubans, Puerto Ricans, Mexican Americans and so on. In Texas like in Arizona and Nevada, the Hispanic community mainly being Mexican American; one in three Texan voters is now Hispanic. Biden did win the Hispanic vote in those states. But in Texas, 41 percent to 47 percent of Hispanic voters backed Trump in several heavily Hispanic border counties in the Rio Grande Valley region, a Democratic stronghold. In Florida, Trump won 45 percent of the Hispanic vote, an 11-point improvement from his 2016 performance reported NBC News. Recognizing Hispanics as a population that can not only make a difference in swing states like Arizona, Nevada, Texas or Florida, but also really across the country, even in places like Georgia, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the number of Hispanic eligible voters may be the reason for the thin margins. In 1984, 37 percent of Hispanics voted for Ronald Reagan and 40 percent voted for George W. Bush in 2004.

In Florida, even though Trump won Florida and gained Hispanic voters, Biden kept 53% of the Hispanic vote and Trump 45%. According to NBC News exit polls, 55% of Cuban Americans, 30% of Puerto Ricans and 48% of other Hispanics voted for Trump.

Subsections of Hispanic voters have a range of historical influences vying to affect their votes. Cuban American voters, mostly concentrated in South Florida, tend to vote Republican in part because of their anathema for socialism, the party of Fidel Castro&#x27;s government that many of their families fled. Mexican Americans, however, have no such historical relationship with either party. Puerto Rican voters who have left the island might be influenced by the territory&#x27;s move towards statehood, as a referendum for Trump&#x27;s relief effort after Hurricane Maria, or regarding how it is taxed. The 2020 presidential election was a major event, with Joe Biden defeating incumbent President Donald Trump. Biden&#x27;s campaign focused on issues such as immigration reform, healthcare, and economic recovery, which resonated with many Latino voters. Despite Biden&#x27;s win, Trump made significant inroads with Hispanic voters compared to 2016, particularly in Florida and Texas. This election highlighted the diverse political preferences within the Latino community and the growing complexity of its electoral impact.

Nationwide, Hispanics cast 16.6 million votes in 2020, an increase of 30.9% over the 2016 presidential election.

After representative Filemon Vela Jr. resigned, Mayra Flores won a special election to succeed him, she won the election to the United States House of Representatives in June 2022. She was the first Mexican-born woman to serve in the House, but would go on to lose in the 2022 General election to Democrat Vicente Gonzalez.

====Elections 2024–Present====

Hispanic voters in the United States have traditionally leaned toward the Democratic Party, but recent elections reveal a significant shift toward the Republican Party, particularly in key battleground states. In the 2024 election, Republican candidate Donald Trump garnered that George W. Bush received in 2004. This shift continues a trend that began in 2020, when Trump made notable inroads among Latino voters, especially in states like Florida and Texas, where Hispanic voters played a crucial role in his victories. Trump&#x27;s support among Hispanic men has grown particularly strong, with 55% of Latino men voting for him in 2024, a significant increase from 2020. In Central California, a region with a sizable Latino population, there is also a noticeable trend toward the Republican Party. This trend allowed Trump to flip several Hispanic Counties, rural ones such as Starr and Imperial, and urban ones such as Riverside and Miami. Many Latino voters in this area feel neglected by the Democrats and increasingly courted by Republicans.

While the majority of Hispanic voters still align with the Democratic Party, the growing rightward shift is increasingly evident among certain demographic groups. Economic concerns—such as inflation, healthcare costs, and housing affordability—have become more central to many Latino voters, especially older generations, rather than the social issues like immigration or reproductive rights that were focal points in Democratic campaigns.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused a temporary decline in immigration to the U.S., but as restrictions have eased, immigration has surged, particularly from Latin America and parts of Asia. Currently, Chinese, Indians, and Filipinos are the three largest Asian ethnic groups immigrating to the United States. Asians in the U.S. are a highly diverse group that is growing fast. Asian immigrants comprise 6% of the United States population and are estimated to rise to 10% by 2050. In 2023, border encounters reached record highs, driven by a combination of economic instability, violence, and natural disasters in countries like Venezuela, Honduras, and El Salvador. Additionally, the U.S. has seen an influx of refugees from conflict-ridden regions, including Afghanistan, Syria, and Ukraine, as ongoing wars and political instability continue to displace millions. Additionally, ideological factors played a significant role, particularly among Cuban and Puerto Rican communities, in response to the backlash following a comedian&#x27;s offensive remark at a Trump rally, where Puerto Rico was described as an &quot;island of garbage&quot;. Despite these gains for the GOP, the Democratic Party retains a substantial advantage, particularly among younger, urban, and more progressive Hispanic voters. As Professor Carl Tobias of the University of Richmond noted, Trump&#x27;s hardline stance on immigration resonated more with some Latino voters than the approach advocated by Vice President Kamala Harris. This trend was especially evident in areas along the Mexican-American border and communities affected by recent immigration patterns.

==Notable contributions==
Hispanic Americans have made distinguished contributions to the United States in all major fields, such as politics, the military, music, film, literature, sports, business and finance, and science.

===Arts and entertainment===
In 1995, the American Latino Media Arts Award, or ALMA Award was created. It is a distinction given to Hispanic performers (actors, film and television directors and musicians) by the National Council of La Raza. The number of Latin nominees at the Grammy Awards lag behind. Talking to &quot;People&quot; magazine ahead of music&#x27;s biggest night in 2021, Grammy nominees J Balvin and Ricky Martin reflected on what it is mean to continue to represent Hispanics at awards shows like the Grammys. Martin, who served as a pioneer for the &quot;Latin crossover&quot; in the &#x27;90s told &quot;When you get nominated, it&#x27;s the industry telling you, &#x27;Hey Rick, you did a good job this year, congratulations.&#x27; Yes, I need that&quot;, the 49-year-old says. &quot;When you walk into the studio, you say, &#x27;This got a Grammy potential.&#x27; You hear the songs that do and the ones that don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s inevitable.&quot; Like Selena Gomez tapping into her roots, the influence Hispanics and reggaetón are having on the mainstream is undeniable.

====Music====

There are many Hispanic American musicians that have made a significant impact on the music industry and achieved fame within the United States and internationally, such as Christopher Rios better known by his stage name Big Pun, Jennifer Lopez, Joan Baez, Selena Gomez, Demi Lovato, Fergie, Pitbull, Victoria Justice, Linda Ronstadt, Zack de la Rocha, Gloria Estefan, Héctor Lavoe, Celia Cruz, Tito Puente, Kat DeLuna, Selena, Ricky Martin, Marc Anthony, Miguel, Carlos Santana, Christina Aguilera, Bruno Mars, Mariah Carey, Jerry García, Dave Navarro, Santaye, Elvis Crespo, Romeo Santos, Tom Araya, Sonny Sandoval, the Mars Volta, Los Lobos, Villano Antillano, South Park Mexican, Cuco, Malo, OhGeesy, Malu Trevejo, Ice Spice, Young M.A, Lloyd Banks, Exposé, Sweet Sensation, Jellybean, Immortal Technique, Brujeria, Fuerza Regida, Xavi, Aventura, Lunay, Myke Towers, Jay Wheeler, J.I., Amara La Negra, Joseline Hernandez, Lele Pons, Snow Tha Product, the Marías, Ángela Aguilar, Tego Calderón, Prince Royce, Don Omar, Eddie Palmieri, Wisin &amp; Yandel, Melanie Martinez, Mariah Angeliq, That Mexican OT, MC Magic, TKA, La India, George Lamond, Sa-Fire, Cynthia, Lisa Lisa, Julieta Venegas, Intocable, Marisela, Pepe Aguilar, Jon Secada, Chayanne, DannyLux, Eslabon Armado, Iván Cornejo, Grupo Frontera, Yahritza y su Esencia, Herencia de Patrones, Omar Apollo, Eladio Carrión, Kid Frost, Cypress Hill, N.O.R.E., Fat Joe, Mellow Man Ace, Chicano Batman, Delinquent Habits, Lil Rob, Ritchie Valens, Ozomatli, BIA, Plan B, Chencho Corleone, Maye, Kap G, Tha Mexakinz, Brownside, Psycho Realm, A Lighter Shade of Brown, Gilberto Santa Rosa, Noriel, Baby Rasta, Brytiago, Farruko, J Álvarez, Darell, Ñengo Flow, Luis Fonsi, José Feliciano, Daddy Yankee, Lil Suzy, Judy Torres, Nayobe, Willie Colón, Jenni Rivera, Baby Bash, Frankie J, Larry Hernandez, Arcángel, De la Ghetto, Giselle Bellas, Juan Luis Guerra, Residente, Anuel AA, Ozuna, Lil Pump, 6ix9ine, Becky G, Ivy Queen, Cardi B, Kali Uchis, Bad Bunny, Rauw Alejandro, all of the members of all-female band Go Betty Go, Camila Cabello, two members of girl group Fifth Harmony: Lauren Jauregui and Ally Brooke, and two members of the nu metal band Nonpoint.

Hispanic music imported from Cuba (chachachá, mambo, and rhumba) and Mexico (ranchera and mariachi) had brief periods of popularity during the 1950s. Examples of artists include Celia Cruz, who was a Cuban American singer and the most popular Latin artist of the 20th century, gaining twenty-three gold albums during her career. Bill Clinton awarded her the National Medal of Arts in 1994.

Among the Hispanic American musicians who were pioneers in the early stages of rock and roll were Ritchie Valens, who scored several hits, most notably &quot;La Bamba&quot; and Herman Santiago, who wrote the lyrics to the iconic rock and roll song &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot;. Songs that became popular in the United States and are heard during the holiday/Christmas season include &quot;¿Dónde Está Santa Claus?&quot;, a novelty Christmas song with 12-year-old Augie Ríos which was a hit record in 1959 and featured the Mark Jeffrey Orchestra, &quot;Feliz Navidad&quot; by José Feliciano; and Mariah Carey’s 1994 song &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is You&quot;, which is the best-selling holiday song by a female artist. Miguel del Aguila wrote 116 works and has three Latin Grammy nominations.

In 1986, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine introduced the Hot Latin Songs chart which ranks the best-performing songs on Spanish-language radio stations in the United States. Seven years later, &quot;Billboard&quot; initiated the Top Latin Albums which ranks top-selling Latin albums in the United States. Similarly, the Recording Industry Association of America incorporated &quot;Los Premios de Oro y Platino&quot; (The Gold and Platinum Awards) to certify Latin recordings which contains at least 50% of its content recorded in Spanish.

In 1989, Univision established the Lo Nuestro Awards which became the first award ceremony to recognize the most talented performers of Spanish-language music and was considered to be the &quot;Hispanic Grammys&quot;. In 2000, the Latin Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences (LARAS) established the Latin Grammy Awards to recognize musicians who perform in Spanish and Portuguese. Unlike The Recording Academy, LARAS extends its membership internationally to Hispanophone and Lusophone communities worldwide beyond the Americas, particularly the Iberian Peninsula. Becky G won favorite female Latin artist, a brand new category at the AMAs in 2020. For the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, the academy announced several changes for different categories and rules: the category Latin Pop Album has been renamed Best Latin Pop or Urban Album, while Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album has been renamed Best Latin Rock or Alternative Album.

====Film, radio, television, and theatre====

American cinema has often reflected and propagated negative stereotypes towards foreign nationals and ethnic minorities. For example, Hispanics are largely depicted as sexualized figures such as the Hispanic macho or the Hispanic vixen, gang members, (illegal) immigrants, or entertainers. However representation in Hollywood has enhanced in latter times of which it gained noticeable momentum in the 1990s and does not emphasize oppression, exploitation, or resistance as central themes. According to Ramírez Berg, third wave films &quot;do not accentuate Chicano oppression or resistance; ethnicity in these films exists as one fact of several that shape characters&#x27; lives and stamps their personalities&quot;. Filmmakers like Edward James Olmos and Robert Rodriguez were able to represent the Hispanic American experience like none had on screen before, and actors like Hilary Swank, Michael Peña, Jordana Brewster, Ana de Armas, Jessica Alba, Natalie Martinez and Jenna Ortega have become successful. In the last decade, minority filmmakers like Chris Weitz, Alfonso Gomez-Rejon and Patricia Riggen have been given applier narratives. Portrayal in films of them include &quot;La Bamba&quot; (1987), &quot;Selena&quot; (1997), &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; (1998), &quot;Nothing like the Holidays&quot; (2008), &quot;Dora and the Lost City of Gold&quot; (2019), Being the Ricardos (2001), &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; (2022) and Josefina López&#x27;s &quot;Real Women Have Curves&quot;, originally a play which premiered in 1990 and was later released as a film in 2002.

Hispanics have also contributed some prominent actors and others to the film industry. Of Puerto Rican origin: José Ferrer (the first Hispanic actor to win an acting Academy Award for his role in &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;), Auliʻi Cravalho, Rita Moreno, Chita Rivera, Raul Julia, Rosie Perez, Rosario Dawson, Esai Morales, Aubrey Plaza, Jennifer Lopez, and Benicio del Toro. Of Mexican origin: Emile Kuri (the first Hispanic to win an Academy Award – for Best Production Design – in 1949), Ramon Novarro, Dolores del Río, Lupe Vélez, Anthony Quinn, Ricardo Montalbán, Katy Jurado, Adrian Grenier, Jay Hernandez, Salma Hayek, Danny Trejo, Jessica Alba, Tessa Thompson, and Kate del Castillo. Of Cuban origin: Cesar Romero, Mel Ferrer, Andy García, Cameron Diaz, María Conchita Alonso, William Levy, and Eva Mendes. Of Dominican origin: Maria Montez and Zoe Saldana. Of partial Spanish origin: Rita Hayworth, Martin Sheen. Other outstanding figures are: Anita Page (of Salvadoran origin), Fernando Lamas, Carlos Thompson, Alejandro Rey and Linda Cristal (of Argentine origin), Raquel Welch (of Bolivian origin), John Leguizamo (of Colombian origin), Oscar Isaac (of Guatemalan origin), John Gavin and Pedro Pascal (both of Chilean origin).

One of the first Latina actresses to achieve success in Hollywood was Lupe Vélez. She was born in Mexico, where she started her film career before moving to the US, where she rose to fame in American and international cinema. During the early sound era of film, Vélez became well-known for her roles and lively personality. In 1927, she began her career in silent cinema. &quot;The Gaucho&quot;, starring Douglas Fairbanks and directed by F. Richard Jones in 1928, is one of her well-known films. Being a Latina actress in Hollywood in the early 1900s, she was often cast in roles that reflected the image of Latina women as hostile and seductive. Hollywood&#x27;s perception of Latinx identities frequently impacted these roles, and Vélez&#x27;s portrayals were typically limited to these stereotypical representations of Latina women. Despite her adjustment and assimilation to Hollywood&#x27;s expectations, Vélez was proud of her Mexican background.

In stand-up comedy, Cristela Alonzo, Anjelah Johnson, Paul Rodríguez, Greg Giraldo, Cheech Marin, George Lopez, Freddie Prinze, Jade Esteban Estrada, Carlos Mencia, John Mendoza, Gabriel Iglesias and others are prominent.

Some of the Hispanic actors who achieved notable success in U.S. television include Desi Arnaz, Lynda Carter, Jimmy Smits, Charo, Jencarlos Canela, Christian Serratos, Carlos Pena Jr., Eva Longoria, Sofía Vergara, Ricardo Antonio Chavira, Jacob Vargas, America Ferrera, Benjamin Bratt, Ricardo Montalbán, Hector Elizondo, Mario Lopez, America Ferrera, Karla Souza, Diego Boneta, Erik Estrada, Cote de Pablo, Freddie Prinze, Lauren Vélez, Isabella Gomez, Justina Machado, Tony Plana, Stacey Dash, and Charlie Sheen. Kenny Ortega is an Emmy Award-winning producer, director and choreographer who has choreographed many major television events such as Super Bowl XXX, the 72nd Academy Awards and Michael Jackson&#x27;s memorial service.

Hispanics are underrepresented in U.S. television, radio, and film. This is combatted by organizations such as the Hispanic Organization of Latin Actors (HOLA), founded in 1975; and National Hispanic Media Coalition (NHMC), founded in 1986. Together with numerous Hispanic civil rights organizations, the NHMC led a &quot;brownout&quot; of the national television networks in 1999, after discovering that there were no Hispanic on any of their new prime time series that year. This resulted in the signing of historic diversity agreements with ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC that have since increased the hiring of Hispanic talent and other staff in all of the networks.

Latino Public Broadcasting (LPB) funds programs of educational and cultural significance to Hispanic Americans. These programs are distributed to various public television stations throughout the United States.

The 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards was criticized by Hispanics; there were no major nominations for Hispanic performers, despite the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences publicizing their improved diversity in 2020. While there was a record number of Black nominees, there was only one individual Hispanic nomination. Hispanic representation groups said the greater diversity referred only to more African American nominees. When the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported the criticism using the term &quot;Black&quot;, it was itself criticized for erasing Afro-Hispanics, a discussion that then prompted more investigation into this under-represented minority ethnic group in Hollywood. John Leguizamo boycotted the Emmys because of its lack of Hispanic nominees.

====Fashion====
In the world of fashion, notable Hispanic designers include Oscar de la Renta, Carolina Herrera, Narciso Rodriguez, Manuel Cuevas, Maria Cornejo, among others. Christy Turlington, Lais Ribeiro, Adriana Lima, Gisele Bündchen and Lea T achieved international fame as models.

====Artists====

Notable Hispanic artists include Jean-Michel Basquiat, Judith Baca, Carmen Herrera, Patssi Valdez, Gronk, Luis Jiménez, Félix González-Torres, Ana Mendieta, Ester Hernandez, Joe Shannon, Richard Serra, Abelardo Morell, Bill Melendez, María Magdalena Campos Pons, Sandra Ramos, Myrna Báez, Soraida Martinez and Yolanda Gonzalez.

===Business and finance===
The total number of Hispanic-owned businesses in 2002 was 1.6 million, having grown at triple the national rate for the preceding five years.

Hispanic business leaders include Cuban immigrant Roberto Goizueta, who rose to head of The Coca-Cola Company. Advertising Mexican-American magnate Arte Moreno became the first Hispanic to own a major league team in the United States when he purchased the Los Angeles Angels baseball club. Also a major sports team owner is Mexican-American Linda G. Alvarado, president and CEO of Alvarado Construction, Inc. and co-owner of the Colorado Rockies baseball team.

There are several Hispanics on the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans. Alejandro Santo Domingo and his brother Andres Santo Domingo inherited their fathers stake in SABMiller, now merged with Anheuser-Busch InBev. The brothers are ranked No. 132 and are each worth $4.8bn. Jorge Perez founded and runs The Related Group. He built his career developing and operating low-income multifamily apartments across Miami. He is ranked No. 264 and is worth $3bn.

The largest Hispanic-owned food company in the United States is Goya Foods, because of World War II hero Joseph A. Unanue, the son of the company&#x27;s founders. Angel Ramos was the founder of Telemundo, Puerto Rico&#x27;s first television station and now the second largest Spanish-language television network in the United States, with an average viewership over one million in primetime. Samuel A. Ramirez Sr. made Wall Street history by becoming the first Hispanic to launch a successful investment banking firm, Ramirez &amp; Co. Nina Tassler is president of CBS Entertainment since September 2004. She is the highest-profile Hispanic in network television and one of the few executives who has the power to approve the airing or renewal of series. Hispanics have also entered the eyewear business, including Geraldo Delgado—an eyewear designer, entrepreneur, and founder of Nerdy Frames.

Since 2021, magazine &quot;Hispanic Executive&quot; has released a list of 30 under 30 executives in the United States. Members include financial analyst Stephanie Nuesi, fashion entrepreneur Zino Haro, and Obama scholar Josue de Paz.

===Government and politics===

As of 2007, there were more than five thousand elected officeholders in the United States who were of Hispanic origin.

In the House of Representatives, Hispanic representatives have included Ladislas Lazaro, Antonio M. Fernández, Henry B. Gonzalez, Kika de la Garza, Herman Badillo, Romualdo Pacheco and Manuel Lujan Jr., out of almost two dozen former representatives. Current representatives include Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Jose E. Serrano, Luis Gutiérrez, Nydia Velázquez, Xavier Becerra, Lucille Roybal-Allard, Loretta Sanchez, Rubén Hinojosa, Mario Díaz-Balart, Raul Grijalva, Ben R. Lujan, Jaime Herrera Beutler, Raul Labrador and Alex Mooney—in all, they number thirty. Former senators are Octaviano Ambrosio Larrazolo, Mel Martinez, Dennis Chavez, Joseph Montoya and Ken Salazar. As of January 2011, the U.S. Senate includes Hispanic members Bob Menendez, a Democrat and Republicans Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, all Cuban Americans.

Numerous Hispanics hold elective and appointed office in state and local government throughout the United States. Current Hispanic Governors include Republican Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval and Republican New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez; upon taking office in 2011, Martinez became the first Hispanic woman governor in the history of the United States. Former Hispanic governors include Democrats Jerry Apodaca, Raul Hector Castro, and Bill Richardson, as well as Republicans Octaviano Ambrosio Larrazolo, Romualdo Pacheco and Bob Martinez.

Since 1988, when Ronald Reagan appointed Lauro Cavazos the Secretary of Education, the first Hispanic United States Cabinet member, Hispanic Americans have had an increasing presence in presidential administrations. Hispanics serving in subsequent cabinets include Ken Salazar, current Secretary of the Interior; Hilda Solis, current United States Secretary of Labor; Alberto Gonzales, former United States Attorney General; Carlos Gutierrez, Secretary of Commerce; Federico Peña, former Secretary of Energy; Henry Cisneros, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; Manuel Lujan Jr., former Secretary of the Interior; and Bill Richardson, former Secretary of Energy and Ambassador to the United Nations. Rosa Rios is the current US Treasurer, including the latest three, were Hispanic women.

In 2009, Sonia Sotomayor became the first Supreme Court Associate Justice of Hispanic origin.

In 2022, Robert Santos became the first Director of the U.S. Census Bureau of Hispanic origin (Mexican American).

The Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC), founded in December 1976, and the Congressional Hispanic Conference (CHC), founded on March 19, 2003, are two organizations that promote policy of importance to Americans of Hispanic descent. They are divided into the two major American political parties: The Congressional Hispanic Caucus is composed entirely of Democratic representatives, whereas the Congressional Hispanic Conference is composed entirely of Republican representatives.

Groups like the United States Hispanic Leadership Institute (USHLI) work to achieve the promises and principles of the United States by &quot;promoting education, research, and leadership development, and empowering Hispanics and similarly disenfranchised groups by maximizing their civic awareness, engagement, and participation&quot;.

==Anti-Latino sentiment==


In countries where the majority of the population is descended from immigrants, such as the United States, opposition to immigration sometimes takes the forms of nativism, racism, religious intolerance and xenophobia. Throughout US history, anti-Latino sentiment has existed to varying degrees at different times, and it was largely based on ethnicity, race, culture, Anti-Catholicism (see Anti-Catholicism in the United States), xenophobia (see Xenophobia in the United States), economic and social conditions in Hispanic America, and opposition to the use of the Spanish language. In 2006, &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that the number of hate groups in the United States increased by 33 percent since 2000, primarily as a result of anti-illegal immigrant and anti-Mexican sentiment. According to Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) statistics, the number of anti-Hispanic hate crimes increased by 35 percent since 2003 (albeit from a low level). In California, the state with the largest Hispanic population, the number of hate crimes which were committed against Hispanics almost doubled.

In 2009, the FBI reported that 483 of the 6,604 hate crimes which were recorded in the United States were anti-Hispanic, comprising 7.3% of all recorded hate crimes, the highest percentage of all of the hate crimes which were recorded in 2009. This percentage is contrasted by the fact that 34.6% of all of the hate crimes which were recorded in 2009 were anti-Black, 17.9% of them were anti-homosexual, 14.1% of them were anti-Jewish, and 8.3% of them were anti-White.

===Discrimination===
It is reported that 31% of Hispanics have reported personal experiences with discrimination whilst 82% of Hispanics believe that discrimination plays a crucial role in whether or not they will find success while they are living in the United States. The current legislation on immigration policies also plays a crucial role in creating a hostile and discriminatory environment for immigrants. In order to measure the discrimination which immigrants are being subjected to, researchers must take into account the immigrants&#x27; perception that they are being targeted for discrimination and they must also be aware that instances of discrimination can also vary based on: personal experiences, social attitudes and ethnic group barriers. The immigrant experience is associated with lower self-esteem, internalized symptoms and behavioral problems amongst Mexican youth. It is also known that more time which is spent living in the United States is associated with increased feelings of distress, depression and anxiety. Like many other Hispanic groups that migrate to the United States, these groups are often stigmatized. An example of this stigmatization occurred after 9/11, when people who were considered threats to national security were frequently described with terms like migrant and the &quot;Hispanic Other&quot; along with other terms like refugee and asylum seeker.

==Immigration reform==

===1965: Immigration and Nationality Act (Hart-Celler Act)===
The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), enacted in 1952, serves as a foundational piece of US immigration law by consolidating and reorganizing various provisions into a unified framework. Since its enactment, the INA has undergone numerous amendments, reflecting its evolving role in immigration policy. It is codified in Title 8 of the United States Code (USC), which is the comprehensive collection of US laws. Title 8 specifically addresses &quot;Aliens and Nationality,&quot; and the INA&#x27;s sections are aligned with corresponding US Code sections for clarity. For accuracy, the official U.S. Code is provided by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel of the US House of Representatives, with links available through USCIS.

===1986: Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA)===
The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), detailed in House Report 99–1000, introduced significant changes to US immigration law. Title I of the Act focused on controlling illegal immigration by making it unlawful for employers to hire or continue employing unauthorized aliens without verifying their work status. It established an employment verification system requiring employers to attest to and maintain records of employees&#x27; work eligibility. The Act also set up procedures for monitoring the verification system and addressing violations, while explicitly prohibiting the use of such verification for national identity purposes. Additionally, Title I outlined employer sanctions, including a public education period and a phased enforcement approach. Title II of the Act provided a legalization program for certain undocumented aliens who met specific criteria, including continuous residence in the U.S. since January 1, 1982. It authorized adjustment from temporary to permanent resident status under certain conditions and required the Attorney General to manage and disseminate information about the program. Title III addressed the reform of legal immigration, including provisions for temporary agricultural workers and adjustments to visa programs. The Act also established various commissions and reports to assess and improve immigration policies and enforcement measures.

===1996: Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA)===
The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 expanded the definition of &quot;qualified alien&quot; under section 431 of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 (8 USC 1641) to include certain categories of battered aliens. The new provisions added to 8 USC 1641 recognize battered aliens. Those who have experienced battery or extreme cruelty by a spouse or parent, or by a member of their family residing with them. As eligible for benefits if there is a substantial connection between the abuse and the need for assistance. This includes aliens with pending petitions for various statuses under the Immigration and Nationality Act, such as spousal or child status of a US citizen or applications for suspension of deportation. The act extends protections to aliens whose children have been subjected to similar abuse, provided there is no active participation by the alien in the abuse. It also includes alien children who reside with a parent who has been abused. These provisions do not apply if the abuser resides in the same household as the victim. The Attorney General is tasked with issuing guidance on the interpretation of &quot;battery&quot; and &quot;extreme cruelty&quot; and establishing standards for determining the connection between such abuse and the need for benefits.

===2012: Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)===
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is a policy established on June 15, 2012, by Janet Napolitano, then Secretary of Homeland Security, under the Obama administration. The policy provides temporary relief from deportation and work authorization to certain young undocumented immigrants who meet specific criteria. DACA does not offer a pathway to permanent legal status. Instead, it grants temporary protection that requires renewal every two years. To be eligible, applicants must have arrived in the United States before the age of 16, be currently under the age of 31, and have continuously resided in the US since June 15, 2007. They must also be enrolled in school, have graduated from high school, or have been honorably discharged from the US Armed Forces or Coast Guard. Upon its implementation, DACA initially benefited approximately 832,881 individuals. The policy has been associated with various socioeconomic improvements among its recipients. According to a 2019 survey, DACA recipients experienced an 86 percent increase in their average hourly wage. This rise in wages has contributed to enhanced financial independence and increased consumer spending, which in turn has had positive economic effects. Recipients also reported improved job conditions and expanded educational opportunities, reflecting the broader impact of the policy on their quality of life. Overall, DACA has been a significant, though temporary, measure aimed at addressing the status of undocumented young immigrants and has had notable effects on their economic and educational outcomes.

DACA&#x27;s future has faced legal challenges, including a 2020 Supreme Court ruling that blocked the Trump administration&#x27;s attempt to end it and a 2021 decision declaring DACA unlawful, though it did not immediately affect current recipients. The Biden administration has since reaffirmed its support and proposed regulatory changes to secure the program&#x27;s future.

<text>The Dean Martin Show is a TV variety-comedy series that ran from 1965 to 1974 for 264 episodes. It was broadcast by NBC and hosted by Dean Martin. The theme song to the series was his 1964 hit &quot;Everybody Loves Somebody&quot;.

This was Martin&#x27;s second run as a variety show host, as he previously hosted two variety shows that aired on the NBC anthology series &quot;Ford Startime&quot; (1959–1960).

The series was a staple for NBC, airing Thursdays at 10:00 p.m. for eight years until its move to Fridays at 10:00 p.m. for the final season and a change in format. It was more popular among white-collar workers than with blue-collar ones; a 1968 survey ranked the show #2 overall among white-collar workers and the highest-ranked first-run series (the highest-rated show among white collar workers was a Saturday night movie umbrella showcase), ranking ahead of the overall first place program &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; in that demographic.

&quot;The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast&quot;, a series of specials spun off from the final season, generated solid ratings for 10 years on NBC.

==Development==
Martin was initially reluctant to do the show, partially because he did not want to turn down movie and nightclub performances. His terms were deliberately unrealistic: as author Lee Hale recalled, &quot;He presented [NBC] with a list of demands he thought it would be impossible to fill. He asked for an outrageous amount of money, of course, but there was more. He only wanted to work one day a week, and that day had to be Sunday. He didn&#x27;t want to do anything but announce the acts. He didn&#x27;t even want to sing if he didn&#x27;t feel like it... But surprisingly NBC agreed to each of his demands. &#x27;They should have thrown them in my face,&#x27; Dean said later, &#x27;but they agreed to it all. So what the hell, I had to show up!&#x27;&quot; As daughter Deana Martin recalled, after meeting the network and making his demands, Martin returned home and announced to his family, &quot;They went for it. So now I have to do it.&quot; (The terms of employment, and not having to appear for rehearsals, allowed Martin to appear in a series of Matt Helm films concurrent with the show&#x27;s run, as well as other projects such as a co-starring role in the first &quot;Airport&quot; film in 1970.)

Martin believed that an important key to his popularity was that he did not put on airs. His act was that of a drunken, work-shy playboy, although the ever-present old-fashioned glass in his hand often only had apple juice in it. The show was heavy on physical comedy rather than just quips (he made his weekly entrance by sliding down a fireman&#x27;s pole onto the stage.) Martin read his dialogue directly from cue cards. If he flubbed a line or forgot a lyric, Martin would not do a retake, and the mistake—and his recovery from it—went straight to tape and onto the air.

&quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot; was shot on color videotape beginning in 1965 at Studio 4 inside NBC&#x27;s massive color complex at 3000 West Alameda Avenue in Burbank, California. The same studio was used for Frank Sinatra&#x27;s yearly TV specials in the late 1960s, and Elvis Presley&#x27;s 1968 &quot;Comeback Special&quot;. Studio 4 is currently one of two used in the production of the soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;.

==Regular segments==
*Martin sang two solo numbers per show, one a serious ballad. He would join his weekly guests in song medleys, trading lyrics back and forth. Some of these duets were deliberately played for laughs—with Liberace, for example—with special lyrics by Lee Hale to suit the performers.
*One recurring segment was based on Martin&#x27;s club act, in which he would begin to sing a popular song and suddenly insert a gag lyric in an attempt to make his pianist Ken Lane laugh hard enough to break his concentration. The segment usually began with Martin leaping onto Lane&#x27;s piano; in one episode, the real piano was secretly replaced with a phony one that collapsed when Martin tried to leap onto it.
*A knock on the &quot;closet&quot; door occurred each week, with Martin opening the door to reveal an unannounced celebrity guest. Most of the time, Martin did not know who the guest would be, to keep his reactions more spontaneous, according to Hale&#x27;s book &quot;Backstage at the Dean Martin Show&quot;.
*A regular gag during one season was the &quot;Mystery Voice Contest&quot;, wherein Martin invited viewers to write in to guess who was singing a particular song. Invariably, it was the famous Frank Sinatra hit &quot;Strangers in the Night.&quot; Finally on one episode, Sinatra appeared to announce that he was the mystery singer. Martin handed over the prize, a trip to Los Angeles, where they already lived.
*The finale was typically a production number featuring Martin and the guest stars. Occasionally it would be a musical sketch with Martin appearing as &quot;Dino Vino&quot;, a disc jockey who played old records. A vintage record would then be heard, with Martin and his guests mouthing the words and pantomiming outrageously.
*During the show&#x27;s eighth season, the finale was a selection of songs from a popular MGM film musical. Clips from the selected film would be shown, with Martin and guests singing a medley from the films. Among those saluted were &quot;Easter Parade&quot;, &quot;Words and Music&quot;, &quot;Till the Clouds Roll By&quot; and the 1951 film version of &quot;Show Boat&quot;.
*When the show was canceled in 1974, a series of &quot;Dean Martin Celebrity Roast&quot; specials were produced in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand Hotel. This tradition was started during the final season of the variety show and continued until 1984.

==Regulars and recurring guests==
In later seasons, many regular performers were added, such as Dom DeLuise and Nipsey Russell in sketches set in a barber shop; Kay Medford and Lou Jacobi in sketches set in a diner, and Medford also pretending to be the mother of Martin&#x27;s pianist, Ken Lane. Leonard Barr, Guy Marks, Tom Bosley, Marian Mercer, Charles Nelson Reilly, and Rodney Dangerfield were also featured on multiple occasions, while bandleader Les Brown was a regular.

During the inaugural 1965–1966 season, the Krofft Puppets were seen in eight episodes. Sid and Marty Krofft recall that they were fired because of an incident involving Liberace, for whom they had previously worked, and who was a great fan of their puppets. Sid Krofft states: &quot;And he [Liberace] asked his fan club to write Dean Martin a letter and tell Dean Martin that there isn&#x27;t enough puppetry on the show.&quot; Many of the letters were nasty and came in great numbers: &quot;And so, can you imagine getting over 250 thousand letters like that in a matter of a couple of weeks, and well, he really didn&#x27;t like that and fired us.&quot;

==Summer replacement series==

For Martin&#x27;s Thursday night time slot, the network and Martin&#x27;s production crew created original summer programming (without Martin) to hold his usual weekly audience. Rowan and Martin hosted the first. Dean Martin&#x27;s 1966 summer series proved so successful that two seasons later it spawned one of television&#x27;s most memorable series, &quot;Rowan and Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;.

From July to September 1967, the summer show was co-hosted by Martin&#x27;s daughter Gail Martin, Vic Damone and Carol Lawrence.

In 1968, Martin&#x27;s staff came up with a new format: a salute to the 1930s, with a variety show performed as if television existed at that time. Producer Greg Garrison recruited a dozen chorus girls, naming the group the Golddiggers after the Warner Brothers musicals of the 1930s. The series, &quot;Dean Martin Presents the Golddiggers&quot;, starred Frank Sinatra Jr. and Joey Heatherton as musical hosts, with comedy routines by Paul Lynde, Stanley Myron Handelman, Barbara Heller, Skiles and Henderson, and neo-vaudeville musicians The Times Square Two. The summer show was a hit, returning the following year with a new cast. Lou Rawls and Gail Martin took over as hosts and six-foot-six dancer Tommy Tune was featured.

The Golddiggers also toured the nation&#x27;s nightclubs as a live attraction. After the summer series ran its course, the Golddiggers were seen on Martin&#x27;s own program, and four of them were used in another group, the Ding-a-Ling Sisters.

Toward the end of the Thursday-night run, the summer series was devoted to European comedians. Marty Feldman was featured in &quot;Dean Martin&#x27;s Comedy World&quot;, hosted by Jackie Cooper.

From 2003 until August 2007, a 29-volume &quot;Best of The Dean Martin Variety Show&quot; collection was sold by direct marketing firm Guthy-Renker via infomercials and a website.

In mid-2007, NBC Universal filed suit in U.S. District Court against several parties, including Guthy-Renker, claiming copyright infringement, forcing Guthy-Renker to temporarily withdraw the DVDs from sale. The lawsuit dealt with a dispute over rights to footage used in the DVD series, material for which NBC claimed it still held the copyright. The conflict was discovered when NBC Universal looked into plans to release its own DVD set. &quot;The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast&quot; specials were not affected by the litigation.

Also named as a defendant in the lawsuit was longtime &quot;Dean Martin Show&quot; producer Greg Garrison. NBC claimed that Garrison had rights only to use excerpts from selected episodes of the show for the DVDs, episodes that the network claimed Garrison had purchased years earlier for a syndicated run of the show from 1979 to 1981. Garrison died in 2005 before the lawsuit was brought forward.

After a settlement was reached on January 2, 2008, Guthy-Renker began selling the collection again, and its televised infomercials returned.

Two other lawsuits were brought over rights to the show&#x27;s material, neither of which affected sales of the home-video collection.

Total revenues from DVD sales of &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot; have been rumored to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The shows have not been aired on television since their original telecasts.

A new package of DVDs was released on May 24, 2011, by Time-Life Video. Unlike the earlier Guthy-Renker collection, which was marketed via mail-order subscription, the new sets were aimed largely at the retail sector. NBC disclosed its participation with Time-Life on the project.

Dean&#x27;s daughter Deana Martin claimed that the first Time-Life sets had sold so well that a second collection was being planned, and that she would be contributing commentary for it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beck/Smith Hollywood&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The second release of DVDs produced by Time-Life was titled &quot;King of Cool: The Best of The Dean Martin Variety Show&quot; and was made available in one- and six-disc configurations.

==Use of screenshots for Billy Meier&#x27;s alien hoax==
The UFO religion leader Billy Meier has passed off images of The Golddiggers performing on &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot; as photographs of extraterrestrials that he met who physically resemble humans from Earth. This was first revealed by Meier&#x27;s ex-wife, Kalliope Zafiriou, that the photographs Meier claimed were of the alien women &quot;Asket&quot; and &quot;Nera&quot; were actually photographs of Michelle DellaFave and Susan Lund from The Golddiggers. It was later confirmed that the images of the so-called &quot;aliens&quot; were a hoax and were indeed screenshots taken from a Golddiggers performance featuring DellaFave and Lund on an episode of &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot; and thus of earthly and not extraterrestrial origin and were photographs of earthlings.

<doc id="1007681" wikidata="Q1974953" url="?curid=1007681" title="Non Phixion">
<text>Non Phixion (pronounced &quot;Non-Fiction&quot;) is an American hip-hop group from Brooklyn, New York City. Though the group did not become a household name during their initial period of activity, the Village Voice said Non Phixion was &quot;integral to the timeline of underground hip-hop.&quot; The group endured a series of missed opportunities on their way to their only LP release and broke up after their first decade. In the months leading up to the 20th anniversary of their formation, the group reunited and was still active and touring. Their logo is a direct nod to the Canadian metal band Voivod.

== History ==
In late 1994, MC Serch (of 3rd Bass fame) took protégé Sabac Red and teamed up with DJ Eclipse and Ill Bill (La Coka Nostra/Heavy Metal Kings), thereby creating the group known as Non Phixion. Within six months, Goretex (now known as Lord Goat), a childhood friend of Ill Bill from Glenwood Houses, had joined the crew after freestyling for MC Serch in Bill&#x27;s Starrett City apartment. Six months later, they had released their first single, &quot;Legacy&quot;. It went on to sell over 25,000 copies worldwide, with little distribution, establishing the group as an international touring force. Necro was a member during the beginning of the group.

MC Serch secured the group a deal by letting them choose what label they desired, which was with major label Geffen Records, due to their growing roster of like-minded artists such as Killah Priest, the Roots, and GZA. Russell Simmons was also interested in the group after Serch brought them to his penthouse for a live meeting and performance, which due to scheduling never came to fruition. Serch kept releasing singles for the group through his own independent imprint Serchlite, and they continued to garner underground worldwide notoriety. Eventually, a series of miscommunications and incidents between the group and Serch over the mysterious whereabouts of money led to Non Phixion being dropped by the label during a merger with MCA Records, by way of then-owner Seagram.

Following their attempt at a major label release, the members of Non Phixion spent their time performing live around the world at such places as Roskilde Festival, and Hultsfred Festival opening for contemporaries such as Gang Starr, Slayer, Black Moon, Rage Against the Machine, Fat Joe, Beastie Boys, Portishead, Queens of the Stone Age, Cypress Hill, GZA, The Beatnuts, Mos Def, and The Roots. After 1998 saw the release of their &quot;I Shot Reagan&quot; 12&quot; on Uncle Howie Records, Non Phixion secured a deal for a full-length with Matador Records, however, this never came to fruition. Eminem manager Paul Rosenberg showed interest in managing Non Phixion, but due to timing this also never happened. Around 2000, Rick Rubin was attempting to bring Non Phixion to Warner Bros. and executive produce their record, but this too never materialized. Ultimately, their debut LP &quot;The Future Is Now&quot; was released on Ill Bill&#x27;s own Uncle Howie Records on March 26, 2002. &quot;The Future Is Now&quot; features the production of hip hop giants such as Pete Rock, Large Professor, DJ Premier, The Beatnuts, Ill Bill&#x27;s brother Necro, and Dave 1 from funk band Chromeo. A heavy metal remix for &quot;The CIA Is Trying To Kill Me&quot; produced by T-Ray was also included and features Christian Olde Wolbers, Raymond Herrera from Fear Factory, and guitarist Stephen Carpenter from Deftones. &quot;The Future Is Now&quot; also contains a rare at the time guest appearance from MF Doom. The cover artwork was created by Los Angeles artist Mear One from California graffiti crew C.B.S.

After the release of their seminal album, Non Phixion&#x27;s members put out their first round of solo material: Ill Bill released &quot;What&#x27;s Wrong with Bill?&quot; on March 2, 2004; this was followed by Sabac&#x27;s &quot;&quot; on June 15, 2004, and Goretex&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Dying&quot; on October 26, 2004. All of their solo efforts were released on Necro&#x27;s Psycho+Logical-Records. The following year, Ill Bill and Goretex released an album with Necro and Mr. Hyde as The Circle of Tyrants on September 13. At the time, there was talk of another full-length Non Phixion album called &quot;The Nuclear Truth&quot; with the same producers and ideas being extended from &quot;The Future Is Now&quot;. Non Phixion went on temporary hiatus in 2006 before a second LP was started. Goretex (now known as Lord Goat) left to work on solo material and develop his new record label, Supercoven.

Sabac moved to Oakland and Ill Bill started a new group with a number of other emcees called La Coka Nostra. MC Serch did not appear on Non Phixion&#x27;s first album &quot;The Future Is Now&quot;. All of Non Phixion&#x27;s work and solo material are highly regarded in the underground hip hop scene, as well as other genres. In January 2003, Non Phixion contributed a track to the film &quot;Biker Boyz&quot;, which starred Kid Rock and Laurence Fishburne. A track was also used for exploitation film &quot;Bully&quot;, but was pulled at the last minute due to subject matter.

Goretex dropped his second solo record titled &quot;Electric Lucifer&quot; under the name &quot;Gore Elohim&quot;, in November 2013 on Supercoven Records.

The band&#x27;s logo was created by Michel &quot;Away&quot; Langevin using the same font style that was used for his own futuristic metal band Voivod.

=== Reunion ===
In 2020, Ill Bill, Sabac and Goretex (now known as Lord Goat) reunited on the DJ Skizz-produced song &quot;Watch The City Burn&quot; from Ill Bill&#x27;s fifth solo studio album &quot;La Bella Medusa&quot;.

<doc id="1007688" wikidata="Q165058" url="?curid=1007688" title="Holodomor">
<text>The Holodomor, also known as the Ukrainian Famine, was a mass famine in Soviet Ukraine from 1932 to 1933 that killed millions of Ukrainians. The Holodomor was part of the wider Soviet famine of 1930–1933 which affected the major grain-producing areas of the Soviet Union.

While most scholars are in consensus that the main cause of the famine was largely man-made, it remains in dispute whether the Holodomor was intentional and whether it was directed at Ukrainians and whether it constitutes a genocide, the point of contention being the absence of attested documents explicitly ordering the starvation of any area in the Soviet Union. Some historians conclude that the famine was deliberately engineered by Joseph Stalin to eliminate a Ukrainian independence movement. Others suggest that the famine was primarily the consequence of rapid Soviet industrialisation and collectivization of agriculture. A middle position is that the initial causes of the famine were an unintentional byproduct of the process of collectivization but once it set in, starvation was selectively weaponized and the famine was &quot;instrumentalized&quot; and amplified against Ukrainians as a means to punish Ukrainians for resisting Soviet policies and to suppress their nationalist sentiments.

Ukraine was one of the largest grain-producing states in the USSR and was subject to unreasonably high grain quotas compared to the rest of the USSR in 1930. This caused Ukraine to be hit particularly hard by the famine. Early estimates of the death toll by scholars and government officials vary greatly. A joint statement to the United Nations signed by 25 countries in 2003 declared that 7 to 10 million people died. More recent scholarship has estimated a lower range of between 3.5 to 5 million victims. The famine&#x27;s widespread impact on Ukraine persists to this day.

Public discussion of the famine was banned in the Soviet Union until the &quot;glasnost&quot; period initiated by Mikhail Gorbachev in the 1980s. Since 2006, the Holodomor has been recognized by Ukraine and 33 other UN member states, the European Parliament, and 35 of the 50 states of the United States as a genocide against the Ukrainian people carried out by the Soviet government. In 2008, the Russian State Duma condemned the Soviet regime &quot;that has neglected the lives of people for the achievement of economic and political goals&quot;.
== Etymology ==
&quot;Holodomor&quot; literally translated from Ukrainian means &quot;death by hunger&quot;, &quot;killing by hunger, killing by starvation&quot;, or sometimes &quot;murder by hunger or starvation.&quot; It is a compound of the Ukrainian , and . The expression means &quot;to inflict death by hunger.&quot; The Ukrainian verb () means &quot;to poison, to drive to exhaustion, or to torment.&quot; The perfective form of is . In English, the Holodomor has also been referred to as the &quot;artificial famine&quot;, &quot;terror-genocide&quot; and the &quot;great famine&quot;.

It was used in print in the 1930s in Ukrainian diaspora publications in Czechoslovakia as &quot;Haladamor&quot;, and by Ukrainian immigrant organisations in the United States and Canada by 1978; in the Soviet Union, of which Ukraine was a constituent republic, any references to the famine were dismissed as anti-Soviet propaganda, even after de-Stalinization in 1956, until the declassification and publication of historical documents in the late 1980s made continued denial of the catastrophe unsustainable.

Discussion of the Holodomor became possible as part of the Soviet &quot;glasnost&quot; (&quot;openness&quot;) policy in the 1980s. In Ukraine, the first official use of &quot;famine&quot; was in a December 1987 speech by Volodymyr Shcherbytskyi, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, on the occasion of the republic&#x27;s 70th anniversary. Another early public usage in the Soviet Union was in a February 1988 speech by Oleksiy Musiyenko, Deputy Secretary for ideological matters of the party organisation of the Kyiv branch of the Union of Soviet Writers in Ukraine.

The term &quot;holodomor&quot; may have first appeared in print in the Soviet Union on 18 July 1988, when Musiyenko&#x27;s article on the topic was published. &quot;Holodomor&quot; is now an entry in the modern, two-volume dictionary of the Ukrainian language, published in 2004, described as &quot;artificial hunger, organised on a vast scale by a criminal regime against a country&#x27;s population.&quot;

According to Elazar Barkan, Elizabeth A. Cole, and Kai Struve, the Holodomor has been described as a &quot;Ukrainian Holocaust&quot;. They assert that since the 1990s the term &quot;Holodomor&quot; has been widely adopted by anti-communists in order to draw parallels to the Holocaust. However this term has been criticized by some academics, as the Holocaust was a heavily documented, coordinated effort by Nazi Germany and its collaborators to eliminate certain ethnic groups such as Jews. By contrast, there is no definitive documentation that Stalin directly ordered the mass murder of Ukrainians. Barkan et al. state that the term &quot;Holodomor&quot; was &quot;introduced and popularized by the Ukrainian diaspora in North America before Ukraine became independent&quot; and that the term &#x27;Holocaust&#x27; in reference to the famine &quot;is not explained at all.&quot;

== History ==
=== Scope and duration ===
The famine affected the Ukrainian SSR as well as the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (a part of the Ukrainian SSR at the time) in spring 1932, and from February to July 1933, with the most victims recorded in spring 1933. The consequences are evident in demographic statistics: between 1926 and 1939, the Ukrainian population increased by only 6.6%, whereas Russia and Belarus grew by 16.9% and 11.7% respectively. The number of Ukrainians as ethnicity decreased by 10%. 

From the 1932 harvest, Soviet authorities were able to procure only 4.3 million tons of grain, as compared with 7.2 million tons obtained from the 1931 harvest. Rations in towns were drastically cut back, and in winter 1932–1933 and spring 1933, people in many urban areas starved. Urban workers were supplied by a rationing system and therefore could occasionally assist their starving relatives in the countryside, but rations were gradually cut. By spring 1933, urban residents also faced starvation. It is estimated 70% to 80% of all famine deaths during the Holodomor in eight analyzed Oblasts in the Soviet Union occurred in the first seven months of 1933.

The first reports of mass malnutrition and deaths from starvation emerged from two urban areas of the city of Uman, reported in January 1933 by Vinnytsia and Kyiv oblasts. By mid-January 1933, there were reports about mass &quot;difficulties&quot; with food in urban areas, which had been undersupplied through the rationing system, and deaths from starvation among people who were refused rations, according to the December 1932 decree of the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Communist Party. By the beginning of February 1933, according to reports from local authorities and Ukrainian GPU (secret police), the most affected area was Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, which also suffered from epidemics of typhus and malaria. Odesa and Kyiv oblasts were second and third respectively. By mid-March, most of the reports of starvation originated from Kyiv Oblast.

By mid-April 1933, Kharkiv Oblast reached the top of the most affected list, while Kyiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa, Vinnytsia, and Donetsk oblasts, and Moldavian SSR were next on the list. Reports about mass deaths from starvation, dated mid-May through the beginning of June 1933, originated from raions in Kyiv and Kharkiv oblasts. The &quot;less affected&quot; list noted Chernihiv Oblast and northern parts of Kyiv and Vinnytsia oblasts. The Central Committee of the CP(b) of Ukraine Decree of 8 February 1933 said no hunger cases should have remained untreated. &quot;The Ukrainian Weekly&quot;, which was tracking the situation in 1933, reported the difficulties in communications and the appalling situation in Ukraine.

Local authorities had to submit reports about the numbers suffering from hunger, the reasons for hunger, number of deaths from hunger, food aid provided from local sources, and centrally provided food aid required. The GPU managed parallel reporting and food assistance in the Ukrainian SSR. Many regional reports and most of the central summary reports are available from present-day central and regional Ukrainian archives.

=== Causes ===

Olga Andriewsky writes that scholars are in consensus that the cause of the famine was man-made. The term &quot;man-made&quot; is, however, questioned by historians such as R. W. Davies and Stephen Wheatcroft, according to whom those who use this term &quot;underestimate the role of... natural causes&quot;, though they agree that the Holodomor was largely a result of Stalin&#x27;s economic policies. Among contemporary historians it is debated whether the famine was an intended result of such policies, whether the Holodomor was directed at Ukrainians, and whether it constitutes a genocide, the point of contention being the absence of attested documents explicitly ordering the starvation of any area in the Soviet Union. Some historians conclude that the famine was deliberately engineered by Joseph Stalin to eliminate a Ukrainian independence movement. Others suggest that the famine was primarily the consequence of rapid Soviet industrialisation and collectivization of agriculture. A middle position, held for example by historian Andrea Graziosi, is that the initial causes of the famine were an unintentional byproduct of the process of collectivization but once it set in, starvation was selectively weaponized and the famine was &quot;instrumentalized&quot; and amplified against Ukrainians as a means to punish Ukrainians for resisting Soviet policies and to suppress their nationalist sentiments.

Some scholars suggest that the famine was a consequence of human-made and natural factors. The most prevalent man-made factor was changes made to agriculture because of rapid industrialisation during the First Five Year Plan. There are also those who blame a systematic set of policies perpetrated by the Soviet government under Stalin designed to exterminate the Ukrainians.

==== Low harvest ====
According to historian Stephen G. Wheatcroft, the grain yield for the Soviet Union preceding the famine was a low harvest of between 55 and 60 million tons, likely in part caused by damp weather and low traction power, yet official statistics mistakenly reported a yield of 68.9 million tons. (Note that a single ton of grain is enough to feed three people for one year.) Historian Mark Tauger has suggested that drought and damp weather were causes of the low harvest. Mark Tauger suggested that heavy rains would help the harvest while Stephen Wheatcroft suggested it would hurt it which Natalya Naumenko notes as a disagreement in scholarship. Another factor which reduced the harvest suggested by Tauger included endemic plant rust. However, in regard to plant disease Stephen Wheatcroft notes that the Soviet extension of sown area combined with lack of crop rotation may have exacerbated the problem, which Tauger also acknowledges in regard to the latter.

==== Collectivization, procurements, and the export of grain ====

Due to factional struggles with Bukharin wing of the party, peasant resistance to the NEP under Lenin, and the need for industrialization, Joseph Stalin declared a need to extract a &quot;tribute&quot; or &quot;tax&quot; from the peasantry. This idea was supported by most of the party in the 1920s. The tribute collected by the party took on the form of a virtual war against the peasantry that would lead to its cultural destruction and the relegating of the countryside to essentially a colony homogenized to the urban culture of the Soviet elite. Leon Trotsky, however, opposed the policy of forced collectivisation under Stalin and would have favoured a voluntary, gradual approach towards collective farming with greater tolerance for the rights of Soviet Ukrainians. This campaign of &quot;colonizing&quot; the peasantry had its roots both in old Russian Imperialism and modern social engineering of the nation state yet with key differences to the latter such as Soviet repression reflecting more the weakness of said state rather than its strength.

In this vein by the summer of 1930, the government instituted a program of food requisitioning, ostensibly to increase grain exports. According to Natalya Naumenko, collectivization in the Soviet Union and lack of favored industries were primary contributors to famine mortality (52% of excess deaths), and some evidence shows there was discrimination against ethnic Ukrainians and Germans. In Ukraine collectivisation policy was enforced, entailing extreme crisis and contributing to the famine. In 1929–1930, peasants were induced to transfer land and livestock to state-owned farms, on which they would work as day-labourers for payment in kind.

Food exports continued during the famine, albeit at a reduced rate. In regard to exports, Michael Ellman states that the 1932–1933 grain exports amounted to 1.8 million tonnes, which would have been enough to feed 5 million people for one year. The collectivization and high procurement quota explanation for the famine is somewhat called into question by the fact that the oblasts of Ukraine with the highest losses were Kyiv and Kharkiv, which produced far lower amounts of grain than other sections of the country. Historian Stephen G. Wheatcroft lists four problems Soviet authorities ignored during collectivization that would hinder the advancement of agricultural technology and ultimately contributed to the famine:

* &quot;Over-extension of the sown area&quot; — Crops yields were reduced and likely some plant disease caused by the planting of future harvests across a wider area of land without rejuvenating soil leading to the reduction of fallow land.
* &quot;Decline in draught power&quot; — the over extraction of grain led to the loss of food for farm animals, which in turn reduced the effectiveness of agricultural operations.
* &quot;Quality of cultivation&quot; — the planting and extracting of the harvest, along with ploughing was done in a poor manner due to inexperienced and demoralized workers and the aforementioned lack of draught power.
* &quot;The poor weather&quot; — drought and other poor weather conditions were largely ignored by Soviet authorities who gambled on good weather and believed agricultural difficulties would be overcome.

Mark Tauger notes that Soviet and Western specialist at the time noted draught power shortages and lack of crop rotation contributed to intense weed infestations, with these both being also factors Stephen Wheatcroft lists as contributing to the famine. Natalya Naumenko calculated that reduced agriculture production in &quot;collectivized&quot; collective farms is responsible for up to 52% of Holodomor excess deaths.

====Discrimination and persecution of Ukrainians ====
It has been proposed that the Soviet leadership used the human-made famine to attack Ukrainian nationalism, and thus it could fall under the legal definition of genocide. For example, special and particularly lethal policies were adopted in and largely limited to Soviet Ukraine at the end of 1932 and 1933. According to Timothy Snyder, &quot;each of them may seem like an anodyne administrative measure, and each of them was certainly presented as such at the time, and yet each had to kill.&quot; Other sources discuss the famine in relation to a project of imperialism or colonialism of Ukraine by the Soviet state.
According to a Centre for Economic Policy Research paper published in 2021 by Andrei Markevich, Natalya Naumenko, and Nancy Qian, regions with higher Ukrainian population shares were struck harder with centrally planned policies corresponding to famine such as increased procurement rate, and Ukrainian populated areas were given lower numbers of tractors which the paper argues demonstrates that ethnic discrimination across the board was centrally planned, ultimately concluding that 92% of famine deaths in Ukraine alone along with 77% of famine deaths in Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus combined can be explained by systematic bias against Ukrainians. The paper found from its analysis that &quot;the regime intended to take more grain from Ukrainian areas after conditioning for factors such as production capacity&quot; and noting that &quot;in areas that the Bolshevik regime marked as important for grain production, ethnic Russians replaced ethnic Ukrainians as the largest ethnic group&quot;.

Mark Tauger criticized Natalya Naumenko&#x27;s work as being based on: &quot;major historical inaccuracies and falsehoods, omissions of essential evidence contained in her sources or easily available, and substantial misunderstandings of certain key topics&quot;. For example, Naumenko ignored Tauger&#x27;s findings of 8.94 million tons of the harvest that had been lost to crop &quot;rust and smut&quot;, four reductions in grain procurement to Ukraine including a 39.5 million puds reduction in grain procurements ordered by Stalin, and that from Tauger&#x27;s findings which are contrary to Naumenko&#x27;s paper&#x27;s claims the &quot;per-capita grain procurements in Ukraine were less, often significantly less, than the per-capita procurements from the five other main grain-producing regions in the USSR in 1932&quot;.

Other scholars argue that in other years preceding the famine this was not the case. For example, Stanislav Kulchytsky claims Ukraine produced more grain in 1930 than the Central Black Earth Oblast, Middle and Lower Volga and North Caucasus regions all together, which had never been done before, and on average gave 4.7 quintals of grain from every sown hectare to the statea record-breaking index of marketabilitybut was unable to fulfill the grain quota for 1930 until May 1931. Ukraine produced a similar amount of grain in 1931; however, by the late spring of 1932 &quot;many districts were left with no reserves of produce or fodder at all&quot;. Despite this, according to statistics gathered by Nataliia Levchuk, Ukraine and North Caucasus Krai delivered almost 100% of their grain procurement in 1931 versus 67% in two Russian Oblasts during the same period versus 1932 where three Russian regions delivered almost all of their procurements and Ukraine and North Caucasus did not. This can partially be explained by Ukrainian regions losing a third of their harvests and Russian regions losing by comparison only 15% of their harvest.

Ultimately, Tauger states: &quot;if the regime had not taken even that smaller amount grain from Ukrainian villages, the famine could have been greatly reduced or even eliminated&quot; however (in his words) &quot;if the regime had left that grain in Ukraine, then other parts of the USSR would have been even more deprived of food than they were, including Ukrainian cities and industrial sites, and the overall effect would still have been a major famine, even worse in &quot;non-Ukrainian&quot; regions.&quot; In fact in contrast to Naumenko&#x27;s paper&#x27;s claims the higher Ukrainian collectivization rates in Tauger&#x27;s opinion actually indicate a pro-Ukrainian bias in Soviet policies rather than an anti-Ukrainian one: &quot;[Soviet authorities] did not see collectivization as &quot;discrimination&quot; against Ukrainians; they saw it as a reflection of—in the leaders&#x27; view—Ukraine&#x27;s relatively more advanced farming skills that made Ukraine better prepared for collectivization (Davies 1980a, 166, 187–188; Tauger 2006a).&quot;

Naumenko responded to some of Tauger&#x27;s criticisms in another paper. Naumenko criticizes Tauger&#x27;s view of the efficacy of collective farms arguing Tauger&#x27;s view goes against the consensus, she also states that the tenfold difference in death toll between the 1932-1933 Soviet famine and the Russian famine of 1891–1892 can only be explained by government policies, and that the infestations of pests and plant disease suggested by Tauger as a cause of the famine must also correspond such infestations to rates of collectivization due to deaths by area corresponding to this due Naumenko&#x27;s findings that: &quot;on average, if you compare two regions with similar pre-famine characteristics, one with zero collectivization rate and another with a 100 percent collectivization rate, the more collectivized region&#x27;s 1933 mortality rate increases by 58 per thousand relative to its 1927–1928 mortality rate&quot;. Naumenko believes the disagreement between her and Tauger is due to a &quot;gulf in training and methods between quantitative fields like political science and economics and qualitative fields like history&quot; noting that Tauger makes no comments on one of her paper&#x27;s results section.

Tauger made a counter-reply to this reply by Naumenko. Tauger argues in his counter reply that Naumenko&#x27;s attempt to correspond collectivization rates to famine mortality fails because &quot;there was no single level of collectivization anywhere in the USSR in 1930, especially in the Ukrainian Republic&quot; and that &quot;since collectivization changed significantly by 1932–1933, any connection between 1930 and 1933 omits those changes and is therefore invalid&quot;. Tauger also criticizes Naumenko&#x27;s ignoring of statistics Tauger&#x27;s presented where &quot;in her reply she completely ignored the quantitative data [Tauger] presented in [his] article&quot; in which she against the evidence &quot;denied that any famines took place in the later 1920s&quot;. To counter Naumenko&#x27;s claim that collectivization explains the famine Tauger argues ( in his words) how agro-environmental disasters better explain the regional discrepancies: &quot;[Naumenko&#x27;s] calculations again omit any consideration of the agro-environmental disasters that harmed farm production in 1932. In her appendices, Table C3, she does the same calculation with collectivization data from 1932, which she argues shows a closer correlation between collectivization and famine mortality (Naumenko 2021b, 33). Yet, as I showed, those agroenvironmental disasters were much worse in the regions with higher collectivization—especially Ukraine, the North Caucasus, and the Volga River basin (and also in Kazakhstan)—than elsewhere in the USSR. As I documented in my article and other publications, these were regions that had a history of environmental disasters that caused crop failures and famines repeatedly in Russian history.&quot; Tauger notes: &quot;[Naumenko&#x27;s] assumption that collectivization subjected peasants to higher procurements, but in 1932 in Ukraine this was clearly not the case&quot; as &quot;grain procurements both total and per-capita were much lower in Ukraine than anywhere else in the USSR in 1932&quot;.

==== Peasant resistance ====
Collectivization in the Soviet Union, including the Ukrainian SSR, was not popular among the peasantry, and forced collectivisation led to numerous peasant revolts. The OGPU recorded 932 disturbances in Ukraine, 173 in the North Caucasus, and only 43 in the Central Black Earth Oblast (out of 1,630 total). Reports two years prior recorded over 4,000 unrests in Ukraine, while in other agricultural regions - Central Black Earth, Middle Volga, Lower Volga, and North Caucasus - the numbers were sightly above 1,000. OGPU&#x27;s summaries also cited public proclamations of Ukrainian insurgents to restore the independence of Ukraine, while reports by the Ukrainian officials included information about the declining popularity and authority of the party among peasants. Oleh Wolowyna comments that peasant resistance and the ensuing repression of said resistance was a critical factor for the famine in Ukraine and parts of Russia populated by national minorities like Germans and Ukrainians allegedly tainted by &quot;fascism and bourgeois nationalism&quot; according to Soviet authorities.

=== Regional variation ===
The collectivization and high procurement quota explanation for the famine is called into question by the fact that the oblasts of Ukraine with the highest losses were Kyiv and Kharkiv, which produced far lower amounts of grain than other sections of the country. A potential explanation for this was that Kharkiv and Kyiv fulfilled and over fulfilled their grain procurements in 1930 which led to raions in these oblasts having their procurement quotas doubled in 1931 compared to the national average increase in procurement rate of 9%. While Kharkiv and Kyiv had their quotas increased, the Odesa oblast and some raions of Dnipropetrovsk oblast had their procurement quotas decreased.

According to Nataliia Levchuk of the Ptoukha Institute of Demography and Social Studies, &quot;the distribution of the largely increased 1931 grain quotas in Kharkiv and Kyiv oblasts by raion was very uneven and unjustified because it was done disproportionally to the percentage of wheat sown area and their potential grain capacity.&quot;
=== Repressive policies ===

Several repressive policies were implemented in Ukraine immediately preceding, during, and proceeding the famine, including but not limited to cultural-religious persecution the Law of Spikelets, Blacklisting, the internal passport system, and harsh grain requisitions.

==== Preceding the famine ====

Coiner of the term genocide, Raphael Lemkin considered the repression of the Orthodox Church to be a prong of genocide against Ukrainians when seen in correlation to the Holodomor famine. Collectivization did not just entail the acquisition of land from farmers but also the closing of churches, burning of icons, and the arrests of priests. Associating the church with the tsarist regime, the Soviet state continued to undermine the church through expropriations and repression. They cut off state financial support to the church and secularized church schools.

By early 1930 75% of the Autocephalist parishes in Ukraine were persecuted by Soviet authorities. The GPU instigated a show trial which denounced the Orthodox Church in Ukraine as a &quot;nationalist, political, counter-revolutionary organization&quot; and instigated a staged &quot;self-dissolution.&quot; However the Church was later allowed to reorganize in December 1930 under a pro-Soviet cosmopolitan leader of Ivan Pavlovsky yet purges of the Church reignited during the Great Purge. Changes in cultural politics also occurred.

First soviet show trial in Ukraine in connection to the member of the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party has taken place as early as 1921. Yet, the first show trial related to Ukraine in the period of the First five-year plan was a trial in 1928 in North Caucasus Krai, known as Shakhty Trial. Prior to this in October 1925 Shakhty Okrug (previously part of Donets Governorate) was transferred from Ukrainian SSR to RSFSR and thus the trial was held in Moscow.Yet, one of the central ones, was the &quot;Union for the Freedom of Ukraine&quot; Trial in which 45 intellectuals, higher education professors, writers, a theologian and a priest were publicly prosecuted in Kharkiv, then capital of Soviet Ukraine. Fifteen of the accused were executed, and 248 with links to the defendants were sent to the camps. Ukrainian Youth Association was also considered a &quot;sub-division&quot; of the &quot;Union for Freedom of Ukraine&quot; and thus its members were also trialed. Other notable Ukrainian processes included &quot;People&#x27;s Revolutionary Socialist Party&quot; trial in 1930 (it was claimed that this was an illegal armed insurgent organisation created in December 1929, which existed in Ukraine and Chechnya) and &quot;Ukrainian National Center&quot; trial in 1931 (another non-existent counter-revolutionary organisation). In RSFSR at that time some other show trials such as Industrial Party Trial (1930) and the 1931 Menshevik Trial were held. The total number is not known, but tens of thousands of people are estimated to have been arrested, exiled, and/or executed during and after the trial including 30,000 intellectuals, writers, teachers, and scientists.

==== During the famine ====
The &quot;Decree About the Protection of Socialist Property&quot;, nicknamed by the farmers the Law of Spikelets, was enacted on 7 August 1932. The purpose of the law was to protect the property of the kolkhoz collective farms. It was nicknamed the Law of Spikelets because it allowed people to be prosecuted for gleaning leftover grain from the fields. There were more than 200,000 people sentenced under this law.

Stalin wrote a letter to Lazar Kaganovich on 11 September 1932, shortly before Kaganovich and Vyacheslav Molotov were appointed heads of special commissions to oversee the grain procurements in Ukraine and Kuban (a region populated primarily by ethnic Ukrainians at the time), in which Stalin urged Kaganovich to force Ukraine into absolute compliance:

The blacklist system was formalized in 1932 by the 20 November decree &quot;The Struggle against Kurkul Influence in Collective Farms&quot;; blacklisting, synonymous with a board of infamy, was one of the elements of agitation-propaganda in the Soviet Union, and especially Ukraine and the ethnically Ukrainian Kuban region in the 1930s. A blacklisted collective farm, village, or raion (district) had its monetary loans and grain advances called in, stores closed, grain supplies, livestock, and food confiscated as a penalty, and was cut off from trade. Its Communist Party and collective farm committees were purged and subject to arrest, and their territory was forcibly cordoned off by the OGPU secret police.

Although nominally targeting collective farms failing to meet grain quotas and independent farmers with outstanding tax-in-kind, in practice the punishment was applied to all residents of affected villages and raions, including teachers, tradespeople, and children. In the end 37 out of 392 districts along with at least 400 collective farms where put on the &quot;black board&quot; in Ukraine, more than half of the blacklisted farms being in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast alone. Every single raion in Dnipropetrovsk had at least one blacklisted village, and in Vinnytsia oblast five entire raions were blacklisted. This oblast is situated right in the middle of traditional lands of the Zaporizhian Cossacks. Cossack villages were also blacklisted in the Volga and Kuban regions of Russia. Some blacklisted areas in Kharkiv could have death rates exceeding 40% while in other areas such as Vinnytsia blacklisting had no particular effect on mortality.

The passport system in the Soviet Union (identity cards) was introduced on 27 December 1932 to deal with the exodus of peasants from the countryside. Individuals not having such a document could not leave their homes on pain of administrative penalties, such as internment in labour camps (Gulag). On 22 January 1933, Joseph Stalin signed a secret decree restricting travel by peasants after requests for bread began in the Kuban and Ukraine. Soviet authorities blamed the exodus of peasants during the famine on anti-Soviet elements, saying that &quot;like the outflow from Ukraine last year, was organized by the enemies of Soviet power.&quot;

There was a wave of migration due to starvation and authorities responded by introducing a requirement that passports be used to go between republics and banning travel by rail. During March 1933 GPU reported that 219,460 people were either intercepted and escorted back or arrested at its checkpoints meant to prevent movement of peasants between districts. It has been estimated that there were some 150,000 excess deaths as a result of this policy, and one historian asserts that these deaths constitute a crime against humanity. In contrast, historian Stephen Kotkin argues that the sealing of the Ukrainian borders caused by the internal passport system was in order to prevent the spread of famine-related diseases.

Between January and mid-April 1933, a factor contributing to a surge of deaths within certain regions of Ukraine during the period was the relentless search for alleged hidden grain by the confiscation of all food stuffs from certain households, which Stalin implicitly approved of through a telegram he sent on 1 January 1933 to the Ukrainian government reminding Ukrainian farmers of the severe penalties for not surrendering grain they may be hiding.

On the other hand, considerable grain reserves were held back by the Soviet government. By 1 July 1933, around 1,141,000 tons of grain were kept in partially secret reserves which the government did not want to touch. Stephen Wheatcroft, Mark Tauger, and R.W. Davies conclude: &quot;it seems certain that, if Stalin had risked lower levels of these reserves in spring and summer 1933, hundreds of thousands – perhaps millions – of lives could have been saved&quot;.

In order to make up for unfulfilled grain procurement quotas in Ukraine, reserves of grain were confiscated from three sources including, according to Oleh Wolowyna, &quot;(a) grain set side for seed for the next harvest; (b) a grain fund for emergencies; (c) grain issued to collective farmers for previously completed work, which had to be returned if the collective farm did not fulfill its quota.&quot;

==== Near the end of and after the famine ====
In Ukraine, there was a widespread purge of Communist party officials at all levels. According to Oleh Wolowyna, 390 &quot;anti-Soviet, counter-revolutionary insurgent and chauvinist&quot; groups were eliminated resulting in 37,797 arrests, that led to 719 executions, 8,003 people being sent to Gulag camps, and 2,728 being put into internal exile. 120,000 individuals in Ukraine were reviewed in the first 10 months of 1933 in a top-to-bottom purge of the Communist party resulting in 23% being eliminated as perceived class hostile elements. Pavel Postyshev was set in charge of placing people at the head of Machine-Tractor Stations in Ukraine which were responsible for purging elements deemed to be class hostile. The secretary of the Kharkiv Oblast referred to &quot;bourgeois-nationalistic rabble&quot; as &quot;class enemies&quot; even near the end of the famine. By the end of 1933, 60% of the heads of village councils and raion committees in Ukraine were replaced with an additional 40,000 lower-tier workers being purged.

Bandura is a traditional Ukrainian musical instrument, whereas bandurists were the carriers of traditional songs and folklore. One of the communist newspapers in 1930 already stated that &quot;being in love with nationalist romance is not a communist thing&quot; and in December 1933 during the All-Ukrainian Union of Art Workers, the bandura and kobza were declared class-enemy instruments, which lead to the beginning of the repressions against the musicians playing them.

Despite the crisis, the Soviet government refused to ask for foreign aid for the famine and persistently denied the famine&#x27;s existence. What aid was given was selectively distributed to preserve the collective farm system. Grain producing oblasts in Ukraine such as Dnipropetrovsk were given more aid at an earlier time than more severely affected regions like Kharkiv which produced less grain. Joseph Stalin had quoted Vladimir Lenin during the famine declaring: &quot;He who does not work, neither shall he eat.&quot;

This perspective is argued by Michael Ellman to have influenced official policy during the famine, with those deemed to be idlers being disfavored in aid distribution as compared to those deemed &quot;conscientiously working collective farmers&quot;. In this vein, Olga Andriewsky states that Soviet archives indicate that the most productive workers were prioritized for receiving food aid.

Food rationing in Ukraine was determined by city categories (where one lived, with capitals and industrial centers being given preferential distribution), occupational categories (with industrial and railroad workers being prioritized over blue collar workers and intelligentsia), status in the family unit (with employed persons being entitled to higher rations than dependents and the elderly), and type of workplace in relation to industrialization (with those who worked in industrial endeavors near steel mills being preferred in distribution over those who worked in rural areas or in food). According to James Abbe, who visited Ukraine at that time, while the Soviet government insisted on him as well as other foreigners to sign an affidavit stating that &quot;they had seen no forced labor in the Ukraine&quot;, &quot;only the actual industrial workers had received enough to eat and even their families had suffered&quot;. Describing the coal mines he visited in Donetsk region, James Abbe mentions: &quot;The next day we went into the question of forced labor. Of course, the armed soldiers situated in the mine shafts, power houses and tipples had bayonets fastened to their rifles and revolvers strapped to their belts; but they were doubtless guarding the property — though the superintendent failed to tell us what they were guarding the mines against. Anyhow, the system of issuing and revoking food cards is far more sinister and effective than bayonets&quot;.

There was also migration in to Ukraine as a response to the famine: in response to the demographic collapse, the Soviet authorities ordered large-scale resettlements, with over 117,000 peasants from remote regions of the Soviet Union taking over the deserted farms. Areas depopulated by the famine were resettled by Russians in the Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, but not as much so in central Ukraine. In some areas where depopulation was due to migration rather than mortality, Ukrainians returned to their places of residence to find their homes occupied by Russians, leading to widespread fights between Ukrainian farmers and Russian settlers. Such clashes caused around one million Russian settlers to be returned home.

=== Torgsin system === 
Torsion networks appeared in 1931.They were selling goods for foreign currency or exchanging them for precious metals. Originally only exclusively for foreigners, but later soviet citizens were also allowed to exchange the goods. During Holodomor people brought family heritage - crosses, earrings, wedding rings to Torgsins and exchanged it for special stamps, for which they could obtain basic goods - mostly flour, cereals or sugar. Torgsins operated at highly speculative prices and were known for long queues. With that mechanism authorities were able to extort from the population whatever could have been hidden during the confiscations. Many families survived, in particular thanks to Torgsin. Yet the network was also a cause of a psychological trauma, since people had to give up on family valuables and relics that had not only material, but also spiritual value. During the Holodomor, the network of torgsins expanded considerably—by the end of 1933, there were already about 300 such shops in Soviet Ukraine. In 1933, the population brought 45 tons of pure gold to torsgins. The network existed until 1936.

=== Cannibalism ===
Evidence of widespread cannibalism was documented during the Holodomor:
Survival was a moral as well as a physical struggle. A woman doctor wrote to a friend in June 1933 that she had not yet become a cannibal, but was &quot;not sure that I shall not be one by the time my letter reaches you.&quot; The good people died first. Those who refused to steal or to prostitute themselves died. Those who gave food to others died. Those who refused to eat corpses died. Those who refused to kill their fellow man died. Parents who resisted cannibalism died before their children did... At least 2,505 people were sentenced for cannibalism in the years 1932 and 1933 in Ukraine, though the actual number of cases was certainly much higher.

Most cases of cannibalism were &quot;necrophagy, the consumption of corpses of people who had died of starvation&quot;. But the murder of children for food was common as well. Many survivors told of neighbors who had killed and eaten their own children. One woman, asked why she had done this, &quot;answered that her children would not survive anyway, but this way she would&quot;. She was arrested by the police. The police also documented cases of children being kidnapped, killed, and eaten, and &quot;stories of children being hunted down as food&quot; circulated in many areas. When nearly all grain and all kinds of animal meat had been exhausted, &quot;a black market arose in human flesh&quot; and it &quot;may even have entered the official economy.&quot; The police kept a close eye on butcher shops and slaughterhouses, trying to prevent them from bringing human flesh into circulation. The Italian consul, Sergio Gradenigo, nevertheless reported from Kharkiv that the &quot;trade of human meat becomes more active.&quot;

In March 1933, the secret police in Kyiv province collected &quot;ten or more reports of cannibalism every day&quot; but concluded that &quot;in reality there are many more such incidents&quot;, most of which went unreported. Those found guilty of cannibalism were often &quot;imprisoned, executed, or lynched&quot;. But while the authorities were well informed about the extent of cannibalism, they also tried to suppress this information from becoming widely known, the chief of the secret police warning &quot;that written notes on the subject do not circulate among the officials where they might cause rumours&quot;.
And the information secretly collected failed to spur the Soviet government into action. Various reports of the horrors of the famine, including the cannibalism, were sent to Moscow, where they were apparently shelved and ignored.

=== Ukrainians in other republics ===
Ukrainians in other parts of the Soviet Union also experienced famine and repressive policies. Rural districts with Ukrainian populations in parts of the Soviet Union outside of Ukraine had higher mortality rates in Russia and Belarus than other districts, this discrepancy did not however apply to urban Ukrainians in these areas. This is sometimes viewed as being connected to the Holodomor in Ukraine.

==== Kuban and the North Caucasus of Russia ====
In 1932–1933, the policies of forced collectivization of the Ukrainian population of the Soviet Union, which caused a devastating famine that greatly affected the Ukrainian population of the Kuban. The number of documented victims of famine in Kuban was at least 62,000. According to other historians, the real death toll is many times higher. Brain Boeck thinks the figure more in the &quot;hundreds of thousands&quot;. One source estimate that during the Soviet famine of 1932–1933 Krasnodar lost over 14% of its population. Purges were also extensive in the region. 358 of 716 party secretaries in Kuban were removed, along with 43% of the 25,000 party members there; in total, 40% of the 115,000 to 120,000 rural party members in the North Caucasus were removed. Party officials associated with Ukrainization were targeted, as the national policy was viewed to be connected with the failure of grain procurement by Soviet authorities. In this vein the Kuban corresponding to the famine had a reversal of the previously attempted policy of Ukrainisation. Prior to the reversal of Ukrainianization, the policy was failing in the Kuban with most local districts not completing it partially due to opposition by local Cossack nationalists and Russian chauvinists in the Kuban including by sabotage despite punitive threats from the state to complete the process made in May 1932.

The large Cossack stanitsa Poltavskaia sabotaged and resisted collectivization more than any other area in the Kuban which was perceived by Lazar Kaganovich to be connected to Ukrainian nationalist and Cossack conspiracy. Kaganovich relentlessly pursued the policy of requisition of grain in Poltavskaia and the rest of the Kuban and personally oversaw the purging of local leaders and Cossacks. Kaganovich viewed the resistance of Poltavskaia through Ukrainian lens delivering oration in a mixed Ukrainian language. To justify this Kaganovich cited a letter allegedly written by a stanitsa ataman named Grigorii Omel&#x27;chenko advocating Cossack separatism and local reports of resistance to collectivization in association with this figure to substantiate this suspicion of the area. However Kaganocvich did not reveal in speeches throughout the region that many of those targeted by persecution in Poltavskaia had their family members and friends deported or shot including in years before the supposed Omel&#x27;chenko crisis even started. Ultimately due to being perceived as the most rebellious area almost all (or 12,000) members of the Poltavskaia stantisa were deported to the north. This coincided with and was a part of a wider deportation of 46,000 cossacks from Kuban. According to the Holodomor Museum, 300,000 people were deported from the North Caucasus between 1930 and 1933, two thirds of them from the Kuban region.

Likely in connection to the affairs in Poltavskaia, Ukrainization was officially reversed in a decree on 26 December 1932; as stated in this decree, there was a two-week deadline to transfer all publishing and paperwork in the region to Russian, and the Ukrainian language was effectively banned in Kuban until 1991. A representative of the Ukrainian state publishing house claimed 1,500 Ukrainian teachers in the Kuban were either deported or killed though this number has not been verified. The professional Ukrainian theatre in Krasnodar was closed. All Ukrainian toponyms in the Kuban, which reflected the areas from which the first Ukrainians settlers had moved, were changed. The names of Stanytsias such as the rural town of Kyiv, in Krasnodar, was changed to &quot;Krasnoartilyevskaya&quot;, and Uman to &quot;Leningrad&quot;, and Poltavskaia to &quot;Krasnoarmieiskaya&quot;. Russification, the Holodomor of 1932–1933 and other tactics used by the Union government led to a catastrophic fall in the population that self-identified as being Ukrainian in the Kuban. Official Soviet Union statistics of 1959 state that Ukrainians made up 4% of the population, in 1989 – 3%. The self-identified Ukrainian population of Kuban decreased from 915,000 in 1926, to 150,000 in 1939.

====Kazakhstan====
Ethnic minorities in Kazakhstan were significantly affected by the Kazakh famine of 1930–1933 in addition to the Kazakhs. Ukrainians in Kazakhstan had the second highest proportional death rate after the Kazakhs themselves. Between the 1926 and 1937 censuses, Ukrainian population in Kazakhstan decreased by 36% from 859,396 to 549,859 – mainly from famine and epidemics but also including emigration – while Uzbeks, Uighurs, and other ethnic minorities in Kazakhstan each lost between 12% and 30% of their populations.

=== Aftermath and immediate reception ===

Despite attempts by the Soviet authorities to hide the scale of the disaster, it became known abroad thanks to the publications of journalists Gareth Jones, Malcolm Muggeridge, Ewald Ammende and Rhea Clyman, and photographs made by engineer Alexander Wienerberger and others. To support their denial of the famine, the Soviets hosted prominent Westerners such as George Bernard Shaw, French ex-prime minister Édouard Herriot, and others at Potemkin villages, who then made statements that they had not seen hunger.

During the German occupation of Ukraine, the occupation authorities allowed the publication of articles in local newspapers about Holodomor and other communist crimes, but they also did not want to pay too much attention to this issue in order to avoid stirring national sentiment. In 1942, Stepan Sosnovy, an agronomist in Kharkiv, published a comprehensive statistical research on the number of Holodomor casualties, based on documents from Soviet archives.

In the post-war period, the Ukrainian diaspora disseminated information about the Holodomor in Europe and North America. At first, the public attitude was rather cautious, as the information came from people who had lived in the occupied territories, but it gradually changed in the 1950s. Scientific study of the Holodomor, based on the growing number of memoirs published by survivors, began in the 1950s.

=== Death toll ===
The Soviet Union long denied that the famine had taken place. The NKVD (and later KGB) controlled the archives for the Holodomor period and made relevant records available very slowly. The exact number of the victims remains unknown and is probably impossible to estimate even within a margin of error of a hundred thousand. However, by the end of 1933, millions of people had starved to death or otherwise died unnaturally in the Soviet republics. In 2001, based on a range of official demographic data, historian Stephen G. Wheatcroft noted that official death statistics for this period were systematically repressed and showed that many deaths were un-registered.

Estimates vary in their coverage, with some using the 1933 Ukraine borders, some of the current borders, and some counting ethnic Ukrainians. Some extrapolate on the basis of deaths in a given area, while others use archival data. Some historians question the accuracy of Soviet censuses, as they may reflect Soviet propaganda.

Other estimates come from recorded discussions between world leaders. In an August 1942 conversation, Stalin gave Winston Churchill his estimates of the number of &quot;kulaks&quot; who were repressed for resisting collectivisation as 10 million, in all of the Soviet Union, rather than only in Ukraine. When using this number, Stalin implied that it included not only those who lost their lives but also those who were forcibly deported.

There are variations in opinion as to whether deaths in Gulag labour camps should be counted or only those who starved to death at home. Estimates before archival opening varied widely such as: 2.5 million (Volodymyr Kubiyovych); 4.8 million (Vasyl Hryshko); and 5 million (Robert Conquest).

In the 1980s, dissident demographer and historian Alexander P. Babyonyshev (writing as Sergei Maksudov) estimated officially non-accounted child mortality in 1933 at 150,000, leading to a calculation that the number of births for 1933 should be increased from 471,000 to 621,000 (down from 1,184,000 in 1927). Given the decreasing birth rates and assuming the natural mortality rates in 1933 to be equal to the average annual mortality rate in 1927–1930 (524,000 per year), a natural population growth for 1933 would have been 97,000 (as opposed to the recorded decrease of 1,379,000). This was five times less than the growth in the previous three years (1927–1930). Straight-line extrapolation of population (continuation of the previous net change) between census takings in 1927 and 1936 would have been +4.043 million, which compares to a recorded −538,000 change. Overall change in birth and death amounts to 4.581 million fewer people but whether through factors of choice, disease or starvation will never be fully known.

In the 2000s, there were debates among historians and in civil society about the number of deaths as Soviet files were released and tension built between Russia and the Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko. Yushchenko and other Ukrainian politicians described fatalities as in the region of seven to ten million. Yushchenko stated in a speech to the United States Congress that the Holodomor &quot;took away 20 million lives of Ukrainians,&quot;. Former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued a public statement giving the death toll at about 10 million.

Some Ukrainian and Western historians use similar figures. David R. Marples gave a figure of 7.5 million in 2007. During an international conference held in Ukraine in 2016, &quot;Holodomor 1932–1933 loss of the Ukrainian nation&quot;, at the National University of Kyiv Taras Shevchenko, it was claimed that during the Holodomor 7 million Ukrainians were killed, and in total, 10 million people died of starvation across the USSR.

However, the use of the 7 to 20 million figures has been criticized by historians Timothy D. Snyder and Stephen G. Wheatcroft. Snyder wrote: &quot;President Viktor Yushchenko does his country a grave disservice by claiming ten million deaths, thus exaggerating the number of Ukrainians killed by a factor of three; but it is true that the famine in Ukraine of 1932–1933 was a result of purposeful political decisions, and killed about three million people.&quot; In an email to Postmedia News, Wheatcroft wrote: &quot;I find it regrettable that Stephen Harper and other leading Western politicians are continuing to use such exaggerated figures for Ukrainian famine mortality&quot; and &quot;[t]here is absolutely no basis for accepting a figure of 10 million Ukrainians dying as a result of the famine of 1932–1933.&quot; In 2001, Wheatcroft had calculated total population loss (including stillbirth) across the Union at 10 million and possibly up to 15 million between 1931 and 1934, including 2.8 million (and possibly up to 4.8 million excess deaths) and 3.7 million (up to 6.7 million) population losses including birth losses in Ukraine.

In 2002, Ukrainian historian , using demographic data including those recently unclassified, narrowed the losses to about 3.2 million or, allowing for the lack of precise data, 3 million to 3.5 million. The number of recorded excess deaths extracted from the birth/death statistics from Soviet archives is contradictory. The data fail to add up to the differences between the results of the 1926 Census and the 1937 Census. Kulchytsky summarized the declassified Soviet statistics as showing a decrease of 538,000 people in the population of Soviet Ukraine between 1926 census (28,926,000) and 1937 census (28,388,000).

Historians estimate a quarter of the death toll was from children and extrapolate a further 600,000 lost births.

Similarly, Wheatcroft&#x27;s work from Soviet archives showed that excess deaths in Ukraine in 1932–1933 numbered a minimum of 1.8 million (2.7 including birth losses): &quot;Depending upon the estimations made concerning unregistered mortality and natality, these figures could be increased to a level of 2.8 million to a maximum of 4.8 million excess deaths and to 3.7 million to a maximum of 6.7 million population losses (including birth losses)&quot;.

A 2002 study by French demographer Jacques Vallin and colleagues utilising some similar primary sources to Kulchytsky, and performing an analysis with more sophisticated demographic tools with forward projection of expected growth from the 1926 census and backward projection from the 1939 census estimates the number of direct deaths for 1933 as 2.582 million. This number of deaths does not reflect the total demographic loss for Ukraine from these events as the fall of the birth rate during the crisis and the out-migration contribute to the latter as well. The total population shortfall from the expected value between 1926 and 1939 estimated by Vallin amounted to 4.566 million.

Of this number, 1.057 million is attributed to the birth deficit, 930,000 to forced out-migration, and 2.582 million to the combination of excess mortality and voluntary out-migration. With the latter assumed to be negligible, this estimate gives the number of deaths as the result of the 1933 famine about 2.2 million. According to demographic studies, life expectancy, which had been in the high forties to low fifties, fell sharply for those born in 1932 to 28 years, and for 1933 fell further to the extremely low 10.8 years for females and 7.3 years for males. It remained abnormally low for 1934 but, as commonly expected for the post-crisis period peaked in 1935–36.

According to Snyder in 2010, the recorded figure of excess deaths was 2.4 million. However, Snyder claims that this figure is &quot;substantially low&quot; due to many deaths going unrecorded. Snyder states that demographic calculations carried out by the Ukrainian government provide a figure of 3.89 million dead, and opined that the actual figure is likely between these two figures, approximately 3.3 million deaths to starvation and disease related to the starvation in Ukraine from 1932 to 1933. Snyder also estimates that of the million people who died in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic from famine at the same time, approximately 200,000 were ethnic Ukrainians due to Ukrainian-inhabited regions being particularly hard hit in Russia.

Russian historian Aleksandr Shubin and Kulchytsky believe that figures recorded by Soviet censuses are reliable, and that the figure of unrecorded deaths is not substantial. Shubin writes that for 10 years only around 300 000 deaths could go unrecorded in the whole Soviet Union, and estimates the number of direct deaths as between 1 and 2 millions.

As a child, Mikhail Gorbachev, born into a mixed Russian-Ukrainian family, experienced the famine in Stavropol Krai, Russia. He recalled in a memoir that &quot;In that terrible year [in 1933] nearly half the population of my native village, Privolnoye, starved to death, including two sisters and one brother of my father.&quot;

Wheatcroft and R. W. Davies concluded that disease was the cause of a large number of deaths: in 1932–1933, there were 1.2 million cases of typhus and 500,000 cases of typhoid fever. Malnourishment increases fatality rates from many diseases, and are not counted by some historians. From 1932 to 1934, the largest rate of increase was recorded for typhus, commonly spread by lice. In conditions of harvest failure and increased poverty, lice are likely to increase.

Gathering numerous refugees at railway stations, on trains and elsewhere facilitates the spread. In 1933, the number of recorded cases was 20 times the 1929 level. The number of cases per head of population recorded in Ukraine in 1933 was already considerably higher than in the USSR as a whole. By June 1933, the incidence in Ukraine had increased to nearly 10 times the January level, and it was much higher than in the rest of the USSR.

Estimates of the human losses due to famine must account for the numbers involved in migration (including forced resettlement). According to Soviet statistics, the migration balance for the population in Ukraine for 1927–1936 period was a loss of 1.343 million people. Even when the data were collected, the Soviet statistical institutions acknowledged that the precision was less than for the data of the natural population change. The total number of deaths in Ukraine due to unnatural causes for the given ten years was 3.238 million. Accounting for the lack of precision, estimates of the human toll range from 2.2 million to 3.5 million deaths.

According to Babyonyshev&#x27;s 1981 estimate, about 81.3% of the famine victims in the Ukrainian SSR were ethnic Ukrainians, 4.5% Russians, 1.4% Jews and 1.1% were Poles. Many Belarusians, Volga Germans and other nationalities were victims as well. The Ukrainian rural population was the hardest hit by the Holodomor. Since the peasantry constituted a demographic backbone of the Ukrainian nation, the tragedy deeply affected the Ukrainians for many years. In an October 2013 opinion poll (in Ukraine) 38.7% of those polled stated &quot;my families had people affected by the famine&quot;, 39.2% stated they did not have such relatives, and 22.1% did not know.

== Genocide question ==
Scholars continue to debate whether the human-made Soviet famine was a central act in a campaign of genocide, or a tragic byproduct of rapid Soviet industrialization and the collectivization of agriculture. Whether the Holodomor is a genocide is a significant and contentious issue in modern politics. A number of governments, such as Canada, have recognized the Holodomor as an act of genocide. The decision was criticized by David R. Marples, who claimed that states who recognize the Holodomor as a genocide are motivated by emotion, or on pressure by local and international groups rather than hard evidence. In contrast, some sources argue that Russian influence and unwillingness to worsen relations with Russia would prevent or stall the recognition of Holodomor as a genocide in certain regions (for example, Germany).

Scholarly positions are diverse. Raphael Lemkin (a pioneer of genocide studies who coined the term &quot;genocide&quot;, and an initiator of the Genocide Convention), called the famine an intentional genocide. James Mace and Norman Naimark have written that the Holodomor was a genocide and the intentional result of Soviet policies under Stalin. According to Lemkin, Ukraine was &quot;perhaps the classic example of Soviet genocide, its longest and broadest experiment in Russification – the destruction of the Ukrainian nation&quot;. Lemkin stated that, because Ukrainians were very sensitive to the racial murder of its people and way too populous, the Soviet regime could not follow a pattern of total extermination (as in the Holocaust). Instead the genocidal effort consisted of four steps: 1) extermination of the Ukrainian national elite, 2) liquidation of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, 3) extermination of a significant part of the Ukrainian peasantry as &quot;custodians of traditions, folklore and music, national language and literature&quot;, and 4) populating the territory with other nationalities with intent of mixing Ukrainians with them, which would eventually lead to the dissolution of the Ukrainian nation. 
Because of these four factors, Lemkin considered the Holodomor an attempt to destroy the whole Ukrainian nation, not just the Ukrainian peasantry.
The &quot;rediscovery&quot; of his 1953 address about the Holodomor has influenced Holodomor scholars, especially his view of genocide as a complex process targeting institutions, culture, and economic existence of a group and not necessarily meaning its &quot;immediate destruction&quot;.

Stanislav Kulchytsky, who recognizes Holodomor as genocide, believes that historians should approach the study of the famine with realization that in the Soviet socialist construction &quot;appearance belied reality&quot;, and that the real intentions of some ideas and policies would not be put on paper. He nevertheless believes that there is enough evidence that proves that Stalin felt hostility and distrust towards Ukrainians and wanted to suppress any potential disobedience from their side. Kulchytsky bases his claims among other things on Stalin&#x27;s telegrams and letters sent to the highest-ranked officials shortly before and during the time when most lethal policies were applied and executed in Ukraine and Kuban. He believes that while the famine started rather as a result of collectivization, near the end of 1932 it was turned into an instrument of intentional starvation of millions of Ukrainians to death.

Timothy Snyder states that, in his opinion, Holodomor meets the criteria of the Genocide convention. He does, however, refrain from using the term and prefers the term &quot;mass killing&quot; instead, arguing that the public misinterprets the term &quot;genocide&quot; as an intention to murder every member of the national or ethnic group, something that the Armenian genocide and Holocaust are closer to than any other cases, including the Holodomor.

Other historians such as Michael Ellman consider the Holodomor a crime against humanity, but do not classify it as a genocide. Economist Steven Rosefielde and historian Robert Conquest consider the death toll to be primarily due to state policy, and poor harvests. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Conquest was granted access to the Soviet state archives alongside other western academics. In 2004, Wheatcroft published a private correspondence that he had with Conquest. In the exchange, Conquest wrote that he is now of the opinion that the Holodomor was not purposefully inflicted by Stalin but &quot;&quot;What I argue is that with resulting famine imminent, he could have prevented it, but put &quot;Soviet interest&quot; other than feeding the starving first – thus consciously abetting it&quot;&quot;. In an interview recorded in 2006 Conquest stated the Holodomor should be recognized as an attack on the Ukrainian people and discussed problems with the use of the term &quot;genocide&quot;.

Robert Davies, Stephen Kotkin, Stephen Wheatcroft and J. Arch Getty reject the notion that Stalin intentionally wanted to kill Ukrainians, but conclude that Stalinist policies and widespread incompetence among government officials set the stage for famine in Ukraine and other Soviet republics. Anne Applebaum believes that the famine was planned to undermine Ukrainian identity but discusses how shifts in understanding of the term &quot;genocide&quot; mean that it is more difficult to apply now that it was when the term was initially conceived. Another argument she puts forward is that the question of genocide is not as important as it once was because it was a proxy debate about Ukraine and Ukrainians&#x27; right to exist, a right which no longer needs historic justification.

== Soviet and Western denial and downplay ==
Scholars consider Holodomor denial to be the assertion that the 1932–1933 famine in Soviet Ukraine did not occur. Denying the existence of the famine was the Soviet state&#x27;s position and reflected in both Soviet propaganda and the work of some Western journalists and intellectuals including George Bernard Shaw, Walter Duranty, and Louis Fischer. In Britain and the United States, eye-witness accounts by Welsh freelance journalist Gareth Jones and by the American Communist Fred Beal were met with widespread disbelief.

In the Soviet Union, any discussion of the famine was banned entirely. Ukrainian historian Stanislav Kulchytsky stated the Soviet government ordered him to falsify his findings and depict the famine as an unavoidable natural disaster, to absolve the Communist Party and uphold the legacy of Stalin.

== In modern politics ==
The event is considered a genocide by Ukraine and the European Parliament, and the lower house of parliament of Russia condemned the Soviet regime &quot;that has neglected the lives of people for the achievement of economic and political goals&quot;.
On 10 November 2003 at the United Nations, 25 countries, including Russia, Ukraine, and United States signed a joint statement on the seventieth anniversary of the Holodomor with the following preamble:
In the former Soviet Union millions of men, women and children fell victims to the cruel actions and policies of the totalitarian regime. The Great Famine of 1932–1933 in Ukraine (Holodomor), took from 7 million to 10 million innocent lives and became a national tragedy for the Ukrainian people. In this regard, we note activities in observance of the seventieth anniversary of this Famine, in particular organized by the Government of Ukraine. Honouring the seventieth anniversary of the Ukrainian tragedy, we also commemorate the memory of millions of Russians, Kazakhs and representatives of other nationalities who died of starvation in the Volga River region, Northern Caucasus, Kazakhstan and in other parts of the former Soviet Union, as a result of civil war and forced collectivisation, leaving deep scars in the consciousness of future generations.In 1984, the United States Congress established the U.S. Commission on the Ukraine Famine, which compiled its 1988 &quot;Report to Congress.&quot; In the report, the US government concludes with anecdotal evidence, that the Soviets had purposely prevented Ukrainians from leaving famine-struck regions. This was corroborated following the discovery of Stalin&#x27;s letter to Molotov titled, &quot;Preventing the Mass Exodus of Peasants who are Starving&quot;, restricting travel by peasants after &quot;in the Kuban and Ukraine a massive outflow of peasants &#x27;for bread&#x27; has begun&quot;, that &quot;like the outflow from Ukraine last year, was organized by the enemies of Soviet power.&quot; The commission published the earlier-mentioned letter written by Stalin to Lazar Kaganovich on 11 September 1932.

The Ukrainian parliament first recognized the Holodomor as a genocide in 2003, and criminalized both Holodomor denial and Holocaust denial in 2006. In 2010, the Kyiv Court of Appeal ruled that the Holodomor was an act of genocide and held Joseph Stalin, Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, Stanislav Kosior, Pavel Postyshev, Mendel Khatayevich, Vlas Chubar and other Bolshevik leaders responsible.

The &quot;Holodomor&quot; has been compared to the Irish Famine of 1845–1849 that took place in Ireland under British rule, which has been the subject of similar controversy and debate.

Russia&#x27;s war strategy in the war against Ukraine in 2022 has drawn parallels with the Holodomor for the intentional impediment of relief supplies to civilians, the blockade of Ukrainian ports that threatened to cause famine in other countries, and the deliberate targeting of civilian infrastructure to deprive Ukrainians of the necessities of life. Ukraine&#x27;s Defense Ministry claims that Russian forces have plundered at least 500,000 tons of grain from farmers since the invasion started. This looting included the seizure of industrial farm equipment, such as tractors, and forcing farmers to surrender 70% of their grain yields. Russia&#x27;s use of starvation as a weapon of war in 2022 has been cited as part of a genocidal pattern in a major report by 35 legal and genocide experts.

=== Government recognition of Holodomor ===
== Remembrance ==
To honour those who perished in the Holodomor, monuments have been dedicated and public events held annually in Ukraine and worldwide.

=== Ukraine ===

Since 1998, Ukraine has officially observed the Holodomor Memorial Day on the fourth Saturday of November, established by a presidential decree of Leonid Kuchma. In 2006, customs were established for a minute of silence at 4 o&#x27;clock in the afternoon, flags flown at half-mast, and restrictions on entertainment broadcasting. In 2007, three days of commemorations on the Maidan Nezalezhnosti included video testimonies of communist crimes in Ukraine and documentaries, scholarly lectures, and the National Bank of Ukraine issued a set of commemorative coins.

 Ukrainian schoolchildren take a more extensive course of the history of the Holodomor.

The National Museum of the Holodomor-Genocide was erected on the slopes of the Dnieper river, welcoming its first visitors on 22 November 2008. The ceremony of the memorial&#x27;s opening was dedicated to the 75th anniversary of the Holodomor. The year 2008 was declared by president Viktor Yushchenko as the &quot;Year of Remembrance&quot; to commemorate victims of the famine.

In an October 2013 opinion poll, 33.7% of Ukrainians fully agreed and 30.4% rather agreed with the statement &quot;The Holodomor was the result of actions committed by the Soviet authorities, along with Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, and was the result of human actions&quot;. In the same poll, 22.9% of those polled fully or partially agreed with the view that the famine was caused by natural circumstances, but 50.5% disagreed with that. Furthermore, 45.4% of respondents believed that the Holodomor was &quot;a deliberate attempt to destroy the Ukrainian nation&quot; and 26.2% rather or completely disagreed with this.

In a November 2021 poll, 85% agreed that the Holodomor was a genocide of Ukrainians. A poll undertaken in Ukraine in 2022 recorded 93% agreeing that the Holodomor was a genocide with 3% disagreeing.

On 19 October 2022, Russian occupation authorities dismantled a Holodomor monument in the destroyed city of Mariupol on the basis that it was not a monument but a symbol of &quot;disinformation at the state level&quot;. Ukrainian culture minister Oleksandr Tkachenko said &quot;such acts signifies that the current Russian regime is a true successor to the one guilty of crimes against humanity and the Ukrainian people&quot;.

=== Germany ===
Perhaps the first public commemoration of victims was a procession held by Ukrainians displaced in the Second World War in 1948 in Munich, the administrative centre of the American zone of occupation in Germany. The most recent countries to recognize Holodomor as a genocide are Germany and Vatican City.

=== Canada ===
The first public monument to the Holodomor was erected and dedicated in 1983 outside City Hall in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, to mark the 50th anniversary of the famine-genocide. Since then, the fourth Saturday in November has in many jurisdictions been marked as the official day of remembrance for people who died as a result of the 1932–1933 Holodomor and political repression.

On 22 November 2008, Ukrainian Canadians marked the beginning of National Holodomor Awareness Week and Holodomor Memorial Day (the fourth Friday of November in Schools and the fourth Saturday of November globally). The success of this initiative is attributed to Valentina Kuryliw, as chair of the National Holodomor Education Committee of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress. Citizenship, Immigration, and Multiculturalism Minister Jason Kenney attended a vigil in Kyiv. In November 2010, Prime Minister Stephen Harper visited the Holodomor memorial in Kyiv, although Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych did not join him.

Saskatchewan became the first jurisdiction in North America and the first province in Canada to recognize the Holodomor as a genocide. The Ukrainian Famine and Genocide (Holodomor) Memorial Day Act was introduced in the Saskatchewan Legislature on 6 May 2008, and received royal assent on 14 May 2008.

On 9 April 2009, the province of Ontario unanimously passed bill 147, &quot;The Holodomor Memorial Day Act&quot;, which calls for the fourth Saturday in November to be a day of remembrance. This was the first piece of legislation in the Province&#x27;s history to be introduced with Tri-Partisan sponsorship: the joint initiators of the bill were Dave Levac, MPP for Brant (Liberal Party); Cheri DiNovo, MPP for Parkdale–High Park (NDP); and Frank Klees, MPP for Newmarket–Aurora (PC). MPP Levac was made a chevalier of Ukraine&#x27;s Order of Merit.

On 2 June 2010, the province of Quebec unanimously passed bill 390, &quot;Memorial Day Act on the great Ukrainian famine and genocide (the Holodomor)&quot;.

On 25 September 2010, a new Holodomor monument was unveiled at St. Mary&#x27;s Ukrainian Catholic Church, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, bearing the inscription &quot;Holodomor: Genocide By Famine in Ukraine 1932–1933&quot; and a section in Ukrainian bearing mention of the 10 million victims.

On 21 September 2014, a statue entitled &quot;Bitter Memories of Childhood&quot; was unveiled outside the Manitoba Legislative Building in Winnipeg to memorialize the Holodomor.

A monument to the Holodomor has been erected on Calgary&#x27;s Memorial Drive, itself originally designated to honour Canadian servicemen of the First World War. The monument is located in the district of Renfrew near Ukrainian Pioneer Park, which pays tribute to the contributions of Ukrainian immigrants to Canada.

On 21 October 2018, a memorial statue was unveiled on Canada Boulevard in Exhibition Place of Toronto. The site provides a place for an annual memorial on the fourth Saturday of November.

=== Poland ===
On 16 March 2006, the Senate of the Republic of Poland paid tribute to the victims of the &quot;Great Famine&quot; and declared it an act of genocide, expressing solidarity with the Ukrainian nation and its efforts to commemorate this crime.

On 22 January 2015, a Holodomor monument was erected in the city of Lublin.

=== United States ===
&quot;The Ukrainian Weekly&quot; reported a meeting taking place on 27 February 1982 in the parish center of the Ukrainian Catholic National Shrine of the Holy Family in commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the Great Famine caused by the Soviet authorities. On 20 March 1982, the &quot;Ukrainian Weekly&quot; also reported a multi-ethnic community meeting that was held on 15 February on the North Shore Drive at the Ukrainian Village in Chicago to commemorate the famine which took the lives of seven million Ukrainians. Other events in commemoration were held in other places around the United States as well.

On 29 May 2008, the city of Baltimore held a candlelight commemoration for the Holodomor at the War Memorial Plaza in front of City Hall. This ceremony was part of the larger international journey of the &quot;International Holodomor Remembrance Torch&quot;, which began in Kyiv and made its way through thirty-three countries. Twenty-two other US cities were also visited during the tour. Then-Mayor Sheila Dixon presided over the ceremony and declared 29 May to be &quot;Ukrainian Genocide Remembrance Day in Baltimore&quot;. She referred to the Holodomor &quot;among the worst cases of man&#x27;s inhumanity towards man&quot;.

On 2 December 2008, a ceremony was held in Washington, D.C., for the Holodomor Memorial. On 13 November 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama released a statement on Ukrainian Holodomor Remembrance Day. In this, he said that &quot;remembering the victims of the man-made catastrophe of Holodomor provides us an opportunity to reflect upon the plight of all those who have suffered the consequences of extremism and tyranny around the world&quot;. NSC Spokesman Mike Hammer released a similar statement on 20 November 2010.

In 2011, the American day of remembrance of Holodomor was held on 19 November. The statement released by the White House Press Secretary reflects on the significance of this date, stating that &quot;in the wake of this brutal and deliberate attempt to break the will of the people of Ukraine, Ukrainians showed great courage and resilience. The establishment of a proud and independent Ukraine twenty years ago shows the remarkable depth of the Ukrainian people&#x27;s love of freedom and independence&quot;.

On 7 November 2015, the Holodomor Genocide Memorial was opened in Washington D.C.

In the 115th Congress, both the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives adopted resolutions commemorating the 85th anniversary of the Holodomor, &quot;the Soviet Union&#x27;s manmade famine that it committed against the people of Ukraine in 1932 and 1933.&quot; The Senate Resolution, S. Res. 435 (115th Congress) was adopted on 3 October 2018 and stated that the U.S. Senate &quot;solemnly remembers the 85th anniversary of the Holodomor of 1932–1933 and extends its deepest sympathies to the victims, survivors, and families of this tragedy.&quot;

On 11 December 2018, the United States House of Representatives adopted H. Res. 931 (115th Congress), a resolution extending the House&#x27;s &quot;deepest sympathies to the victims and survivors of the Holodomor of 1932–1933, and their families&quot; and condemned &quot;the systematic violations of human rights, including the freedom of self-determination and freedom of speech, of the Ukrainian people by the Soviet Government.&quot; On 12 May 2022, and at the 117th United States congress, a new H. Res. 1109 was adopted, recognizing the Holodomor as a genocide and the resolution to serve as a reminder of the repressive Soviet policies including the blockade policy that prevented the delivery of humanitarian aid and people from escaping.

=== On film ===
The 2019 feature film &quot;Mr Jones&quot;, starring James Norton and directed by Agnieszka Holland, focuses on Jones and his investigation of and reporting on the Ukrainian famine in the face of political and journalistic opposition. In January 2019, it was selected to compete for the Golden Bear at the 69th Berlin International Film Festival. The film won Grand Prix Golden Lions at the 44th Gdynia Film Festival in September 2019.

=== Vatican City ===
On 23 November 2022, Pope Francis held a ceremony to remember the victims of the famine. He referred to the Holodomor as a genocide. &quot;Let us remember long-suffering Ukraine. This Saturday marks the anniversary of the terrible genocide of the Holodomor in 1932–1933 artificially caused by Stalin. Let us pray for the victims of this genocide and pray for the all Ukrainians, the children, the women and the elderly, the babies, who are today suffering the martyrdom of aggression.&quot;

<text>The Lancashire League is a competitive league of local cricket clubs drawn from the small to middle-sized mill towns, mainly but not exclusively, of East Lancashire. Its real importance is probably due to its history of employing professional players of international standing to play in the League. After declining earlier opportunities to have this status, the league became an ECB Premier League from the 2023 season.

==History==
The Lancashire Cricket League was formed on 16 March 1892, growing from the North East Cricket League which had been formed 17 months earlier. Currently in membership are Accrington CC, Bacup CC, Burnley CC, Church CC, Clitheroe CC, Colne CC, Crompton CC, Darwen Cricket Club, East Lancashire CC, Enfield CC, Great Harwood CC, Greenmount CC, Haslingden CC, Littleborough CC, Lowerhouse CC, Middleton CC, Nelson CC, Norden CC, Ramsbottom CC, Rawtenstall CC, Rishton CC, Rochdale CC, Todmorden CC (actually in Yorkshire) and Walsden CC (in West Yorkshire). In the early years, Bury CC were also members, but they withdrew after participating for two seasons.

The early 1890s saw the sudden emergence of cricket leagues all over Lancashire, with the first in 1888 – the Bolton Association. The North Lancashire League and the Central Lancashire League each started the same year as the Lancashire League in 1892. The Football League had set a trend in season 1888–89 and also had its heart in Lancashire, and with professionals and regular friendlies and local derbies, the leagues quickly became very popular institutions, with games played at weekends when working people had rare leisure time.

In the early years, until 1899, it was possible for each team to field two professionals, but this was restricted for the 1900 season to one. The League Centenary was celebrated in 1992, and in 1998 a major exhibition about the League was mounted by Horse and Bamboo Theatre at their centre with the involvement of the author Ron Freethy.

In 1981, the League&#x27;s name was amended to include the name of a sponsor, initially Blackburn brewer Matthew Brown, later E. W. Cartons and Sponsorbank, among others, and currently J. W. Lees.

The Lancashire League, in its first season of 1892, consisted of only thirteen clubs (the fourteen current members, minus Todmorden) before Bury played in 1893 and 1894 to give the league fourteen clubs. Bury left for the 1895 season, before Todmorden joined in 1897. The membership of the League did not then change for another 120 years, until three new clubs—Clitheroe, Darwen and Great Harwood—joined in 2017. In 2018, the number of member clubs was increased to 24 with the admission of Crompton, Norden, Littleborough, Middleton, Milnrow, Rochdale and Walsden; however, in 2019 Milnrow resigned from the League after two seasons, to be replaced in 2020 by Bury&#x27;s Greenmount CC. In addition, Edenfield entered the 20/20 Cup between 2007 and 2014, but did not enter any other Lancashire League competition.

==Senior competitions==
===1st XI League===
The league&#x27;s 22 current member clubs are divided into two divisions. Games start out as 50 over matches but if rain affects play they can be reduced to a minimum of 20 overs. The method for working out reduced targets is to take 3/4 of the first innings run rate off the first innings score for every over that is lost in the second innings. One over is lost for every 7 minutes in the first innings and every 3½ minutes in the second innings. The second innings can be less than 20 overs as long as there were more than 20 overs bowled in the first innings and the team batting second believe they can chase the full total posted in the first innings or the team bowling second believe they can bowl their opponents out in the allocated overs. If the team batting second get the full total then they win. If the team bowling second bowl out the team batting second then they win. If neither team does this then it is a No Result. For example, Lowerhouse scored 124-7 off their allocated 31 overs. Nelson opted to chase 125 for victory off 12 overs. They ended up on 82-7 so neither team won and it was a no result. 10 points are awarded for a win, 7 points for a tie, 3 points for a no result and 2 points for bowling the opposition out. Up to 5 bonus points are then awarded to the team who lost. If the team that lost bowled second they get 1-point for 5 wickets, 2 for 6 wickets, 3 for 7 wickets, 4 for 8 wickets and 5 for 9 wickets. If they batted second they get 1-point for being within 50 runs, 2 points for being within 40 runs, 3 points for being within 30 runs, 4 points for being within 20 runs and 5 points for being within 10 runs. 1 point is deducted for slow over rate in an innings of more than 40 overs. One over is expected to be bowled in 3¾ minutes. One bowler may bowl up to 17 overs while no other bowlers may bowl more than 14 overs.

===Worsley Cup===
Every club in the league competes in this knockout tournament with two teams being given a random bye to the second round (there are four rounds in all). All games have to be 50 overs and if not completed on the given date have to be continued on weeknights or, if still in the first innings, the following Saturday. The first game is generally played on a Sunday and the reserve date is always a Saturday. Bowlers can bowl no more than ten overs each.

===Ron Singleton Colne Trophy===
The League winner plays the Worsley Cup winner in this competition. If a team wins both competitions then the Double winners play the team that finished second the previous year. It is played on the Saturday before the League starts. It is played to the same match rules as the Worsley Cup except that overs are deducted for bad weather. The Colne Trophy has to be a minimum of 20 overs. If the game cannot be completed then the trophy is shared.

===20/20 Cup===
There are three groups: two consisting of six teams and one group consisting of five. The top three clubs from each group (top two from the group of five) go through to the quarter-final. In the group stage, each team plays each other team once. Two points are awarded for a win and one point for a draw. Each team must face a minimum of five overs for a game to be valid. The method for working out reduced targets is to subtract the full run rate for every over lost in the second innings. Games are played mainly on a Friday night, but are occasionally played on a Thursday night. Teams can play in colours if they wish. Bowlers can bowl no more than four overs.

==The professionals==
A remarkable number of exceptional cricketers from all over the world have come to live in Lancashire and play in the League, including Dik Abed, Bill Alley, Nyron Asgarali, Nathan Astle, Sydney Barnes, Allan Border, Chris Cairns, Michael Clarke, Sir Learie Constantine, Kapil Dev, Allan Donald, Bruce Dooland, Roy Gilchrist, Dennis Lillee, Trevor Chappell, Jason Gillespie, Kerry O&#x27;Keeffe, Charlie Griffith, Andrew Hall, Wes Hall, Roger Harper, Chris Harris, George Headley, Michael Holding, Murali Kartik, Charlie Llewellyn, Clive Lloyd, Manny Martindale, Mark Orchard, Cec Pepper, Viv Richards, Andy Roberts, Fred Root, Jacques Rudolph, Peter Sleep, &#x27;Big&#x27; Jim Smith, Hugh Tayfield, George Tribe, Lou Vincent, Shane Warne, Chester Watson, Steve Waugh, Bilawal Bhatti, Alviro Petersen, Robin Peterson, Vijay Hazare , and Everton Weekes. It is a rule of the competition that each team must have a professional player in their squad. Should the professional be unavailable, then a substitute must be found. Teams not playing a pro can be fined.

==Documentaries==
===&quot;Beyond a Boundary&quot;===
In C.L.R. James&#x27; autobiographical &quot;Beyond a Boundary&quot;, the Trinidadian writer writes about his visits as a young man to his friend Learie Constantine, at that time living in Nelson while playing as a professional for the town Lancashire League team. He gives a vivid sense of what it must have been like for a young West Indian to arrive in the wet and strange East Lancashire. He also describes how his subsequent education at university in Paris is helped by a local baker, and how his gradual politicisation is given a boost by meetings with local socialists, concerned with the harsh treatment and conditions suffered by the local working class millworkers. Although an extreme example, the meetings between other professional cricketers from the British Empire, and the mainly working-class amateurs of the Lancashire League, must have resulted in many other instances of mutual support and understanding.

===&quot;Race and Pace: West Indians in the East Lancashire League&quot;===
The league and its relationship with West Indies professional cricketers is the subject of a 2017 BBC television documentary: &quot;Race and Pace: West Indians in the East Lancashire League&quot;. The film features original footage of the players, shots of the ground and interviews with Wes Hall, Viv Richards, David Lloyd, and Learie Constantine&#x27;s daughter.

<text>The Downham Estate is a London County Council cottage estate in Downham, south east London. It is mainly in the London Borough of Lewisham and partly in the London Borough of Bromley.

The Downham Estate provides an example of the programme of building council housing occurring in Britain between the First and Second World Wars. The estate was constructed between 1924 and 1930 to plans by the LCC architect George Topham Forrest. One of the first houses to be completed was ceremonially opened in 1927 by King George V.

Among other similar developments around London (for example Becontree), it was developed to help alleviate the chronic shortage of housing in London, partly brought about by the complete cessation of building during World War I. It was intended to show what could be achieved by public-sector house-building: particularly in order to provide better housing for those who had lived in the slums of the city. The building of the Estate attracted subsidies from central government and was constructed under the auspices of the London County Council.

The estate covered an area of 522 acres (2.1 km2), of which 461 acres (1.9 km2) were in the Metropolitan Borough of Lewisham, (from 1965 the London Borough of Lewisham) and 61 acres (0.2 km2) in the Municipal Borough of Bromley (from 1965 the London Borough of Bromley); altogether it covered a distance of 1.25 miles (2 km). The land had previously been mainly rural although around Grove Park railway station in the east of the area there had been some development; between Lewisham and Bromley was virtually the end of London at that time. 5659 houses were constructed of varying sizes; and there were also 408 flats (apartments) in blocks up to four storeys in height.

Downham was named in honour of Lord Downham, who was chairman of the London County Council during 1919–20. The first tenants of the estate were mainly former residents of inner city areas, such as Rotherhithe and the accommodation was spacious and luxurious compared with their former dwellings.

<text>Thomas Cornelius Murray (17 January 1873 – 7 March 1959) was an Irish dramatist who was closely associated with the Abbey Theatre. He was born in Macroom, County Cork, and educated at St Patrick&#x27;s Teacher Training College in Drumcondra, Dublin. He worked as a schoolteacher and in 1900 was appointed headmaster of the national school in Rathduff, Co. Cork. His first play, &quot;The Wheel of Fortune&quot;, was produced by the Little Theatre in Cork in 1909. It was revised and renamed &quot;Sovereign Love&quot; in 1913. Murray had co-founded the theatre with Daniel Corkery, Con O&#x27;Leary and Terence McSwiney. In 1915, he moved to Dublin as headmaster of the Model Schools at Inchicore, where he remained until his retirement from teaching in 1932.

His play &quot;Birthright&quot; was performed in the Abbey Theatre in 1910 and established him as a writer of force. In all, he wrote 15 plays, all of which were produced by the Abbey. His two most highly regarded works are &quot;Maurice Harte&quot; (1912) and &quot;Autumn Fire&quot; (1924). Both of these and &quot;Birthright&quot; were performed in New York on Broadway, with &quot;Autumn Fire&quot; having a run of 71 performances. Murray also wrote an autobiographical novel &quot;Spring Horizon&quot; (1937).

With regard to the character of Murray&#x27;s plays and their writerly impact, Sean O&#x27;Casey according to Patrick Maume told Joseph Holloway how &quot;he didn&#x27;t like to watch Murray&#x27;s plays because their unrelieved tragedy affected him too deeply; he inserted numerous humorous touches into his own plays as a result&quot;. Maume cites Daniel Corkery comparing their different styles &quot;...how Murray often achieves a kind of hidden tension -the very stuff of drama- that Synge only rarely reached and Sean O&#x27;Casey knows nothing of&quot;. Maume cites the example of Murray&#x27;s early play &#x27;Maurice Harte&#x27; wherein &quot;a clerical student who lacks a vocation is driven mad by the pressure of family expectations&quot;.

It has been stated both by A. DeGiacomo and by R. Allen Cave that, in the Art competitions at the 1924 Olympics in Paris, France, Murray was awarded a bronze medal for his play &quot;Birthright&quot;. However, according to the official record for the games, although Murray was a participant in the literature category with this play and also with &quot;Maurice Harte&quot; he did not win a medal.

&quot;Birthright&quot; was staged at the Finborough Theatre in London in 2023, its first staging in London in 90 years.

<text>The Yorkshire League and the Lancashire League formed two sections of the Rugby Football League Championship for much of its history. Initially, the 22 clubs that broke away in 1895 played in one combined league; however, the following season saw the addition of many clubs, and the League was split into two separate county competitions.

==History==
This situation endured until 1901–1902, when the top teams in each league resigned and formed a new combined first division. The following season, the remaining clubs formed a second division. From then until 1907, when there was another re-organisation, the county leagues were not played.

The new structure initiated for the 1907–1908 season saw the clubs playing every other team in their own county home and away, and playing once each against the clubs from the other county. Results from all games counted towards the Rugby Football League Championship, whilst results within the county counted towards the respective county leagues.

The championship often included teams from outside the Yorkshire and Lancashire heartlands; these were allocated to a county league on a practical basis. Briefly, in the 1908–1909 season, there were enough clubs from Wales to add a third Welsh League to the structure. The sole winner of this title was Merthyr Tydfil.

The Yorkshire and Lancashire Leagues were abandoned in 1970.

==Results==

The RFL Lancashire League was an annual competition from 1895 to 1970 for professional rugby league teams in Lancashire. Other teams from Cheshire and Cumbria also competed in the league. During the period 1896–1901 the county leagues were played as there was no national league championship during this period. After they were played alongside the RFL Championship until 1970. Teams also competed in the Lancashire Cup.

To keep the number of teams equal in both county leagues, clubs from Yorkshire were often invited to play in the Lancashire League. Halifax joined the Lancashire League in 1930, remaining there until the start of the Second World War. Following the demise of Belle Vue Rangers in 1955, it was initially decided that the Yorkshire League champions would compete in the Lancashire League during the following season, but clubs were later elected into the league on a voluntary basis instead.
