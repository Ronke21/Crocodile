<text>The Tupolev Tu-28 (NATO reporting name Fiddler) is a long-range interceptor aircraft introduced by the Soviet Union in the 1960s. The official designation was Tu-128, but this designation was less commonly used in the West. It was the largest and heaviest fighter ever in service.

==Background==
In the 1950s, the Soviet Union sought means to defend against nuclear-armed American bombers possibly penetrating its borders (especially its long and vulnerable northern border). Contemporary interceptors, such as the Yakovlev Yak-28P, were able to cover a radius of just a few hundred kilometers flying from northern Soviet bases like Talagi and Savatiya; the newly developed surface-to-air missiles had even shorter range. Considering both, the sheer numbers required to defend a 5,000 km air front were economically impossible to maintain. This left the Soviet Union able to provide a modern air defense only for selected valuable areas. The PVO decided to cover the entire territory, but with a looser defence. In 1955 it placed a requirement for a large area-defense interceptor, that would achieve it with sparse airbases. The PVO requirement called for a supersonic aircraft with enormous fuel tanks for both a good patrol time and long range, a capable radar, and the most powerful air-to-air missiles possible. The first attempt, although unsuccessful, was the Lavochkin La-250, a 30-tonne interceptor prototype which was the last of the Lavochkin design bureau&#x27;s aircraft.

==Design and development==

Iosif Nezval of Tupolev Design Bureau led development of the new interceptor aircraft. The work began in 1958, based on an existing single prototype of the unsuccessful Tu-98 supersonic bomber. The military designation of the interceptor was at first Tu-28, but it was changed in 1963 to Tu-128, identical to the designation used by the OKB.

The Tu-128 had a broad, low/mid-mounted swept wing carrying the main landing gear in wing-mounted pods, and slab tailplanes. Two Lyulka AL-7F-2 turbojet engines were mounted in the fuselage. The two-man crew of pilot and navigator were seated in tandem.

The Tu-128, with its maximum weight of 43 tonnes, was the heaviest fighter to enter service. A pure interceptor with high wing loading, unsophisticated but reliable avionics, and poor visibility, it was not an agile aircraft and was intended only to engage NATO bombers like the B-52, not dogfight smaller aircraft.

The interceptor made its initial public appearance in the 1961 Tushino air parade. Western experts, unaware that the bulge on the belly carried testing instruments, mistook it for a large ventral radar for a mixed interceptor/AWACS role. The production version lacked the bulge and had a large nose radome housing a radar, known as RP-S &quot;Smerch&quot;, having a detection range of about 50 km (31 mi) and a lock-on range of about 40 km (25 mi).

Armament of the Tu-128 was four Bisnovat R-4 air-to-air missiles (known as K-80 during development; NATO reporting name AA-5 &#x27;Ash&#x27;). Usually two of them were R-4Rs with semi-active radar homing and two were R-4T infrared-homing missiles, with the former on the outer pylons and the latter on the inner underwing pylons. There was no internal weapons bay.

Production of the Tu-128 ended in 1970 with a total of 198 aircraft having been built.

Development of various projects designated Tu-28A, Tu-28-80, Tu-28-100, Tu-138, and Tu-148 were proposed by the Tupolev Design Bureau but all were abandoned.

==Operational history==
The Tu-128&#x27;s only publicly reported combat operation was the destruction of NATO reconnaissance balloons. The aircraft remained in service until 1990. Through the 1980s, units armed with the Tu-128 converted to the Mikoyan MiG-31, which features more advanced sensors and weapons.

==Variants==

;Prototype of Tu-28 (&#x27;Fiddler-A&#x27;)
:Development test aircraft, one built. OKB designation was 128. In the West, Fiddler-A was used for all the aircraft with twin ventral fins — these included a prototype and a few of initial production (perhaps two planes).
;Tu-128 (also known as Tu-28; &#x27;Fiddler-B&#x27;)
:Main version, first deployed operationally in 1964 (or 1966 – sources differ). The military designation was at first Tu-28, but the existing aircraft were renamed in 1963. The entire weapon complex (aircraft, radar, missiles) was designated Tu-128S-4. In the Western sources, but not in Soviet, often the more precise, but erroneous, designation of this version is mentioned as either Tu-28P or Tu-128P.
;Tu-128UT (also known as Tu-28UT)
:Training version with an additional cockpit forward of the normal one, in place of a radar. Ten built and four converted from standard interceptors.
;Tu-128M
:A 1979 modernization of almost all existing aircraft for better interception at low altitude. Development originated in 1970. Engines and airframe were not altered. The full designation of the entire weapons complex was Tu-128S-4M. It contained a new RP-SM &quot;Smerch-M&quot; radar, and new missile set: R-4RM plus R-4TM.

===Abandoned===

;Tu-28A
:New development, abandoned.
;Tu-28-80
:Development designation, abandoned.
;Tu-28-100
:Development designation, abandoned.
;Tu-138
:New development, abandoned.
;Tu-148
:New development, variable geometry wings, abandoned.

<text>The 1964 AFC Asian Cup was the 3rd edition of the men&#x27;s AFC Asian Cup, a quadrennial international football tournament organised by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). The finals were held in Israel from 26 May to 3 June 1964.

The tournament used a round-robin system which had to be increased in size to five teams, with the winners from the Western, Central 1 and 2 and Eastern zones, as well as the host nation (Israel) competing for the title. Eleven of the 17 nations withdrew from qualification resulting in only one zone (a combined Central 1 and 2) playing any qualifying matches. The two remaining teams from the Western and Eastern zones respectively qualified uncontested. 

The final tournament was subsequently a four-team competition, the same format as previous editions, with Israel winning the title with a perfect record of three wins. In keeping with previous editions of the tournament, all the matches were only 80 minutes in duration.

He went on to hold various command and staff appointments in the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) and the Joint Staff before his appointment as Chief of Navy in 1991 with the rank of Rear-Admiral (Two-Star) before leaving the SAF on 7 December 1992 to contest in the 1992 by-elections in Marine Parade GRC.

Teo was awarded the Commendation Medal (Silver) (Military) and the Public Administration Medal (Gold) (Military) in the 1981 and 1992 National Day Awards respectively.

===Political career===
Teo made his political debut in the 1992 by-elections in Marine Parade GRC as part of a four-member PAP team led by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. After the PAP team won 72.9% of the vote against three opposition parties, Teo was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) representing the Joo Chiat ward of Marine Parade GRC. He was subsequently appointed as Minister of State for Finance, Minister of State for Communications and Minister of State for Defence.

In April 1995, Teo was appointed as Senior Minister of State for Defence and Acting Minister for the Environment. In January 1996, he was promoted to full Minister and given the Cabinet portfolios of Minister for the Environment and Second Minister for Defence.

Teo switched to contesting in Pasir Ris GRC during the 1997 general election and the four-member PAP team led by him won 70.9% of the vote against the Workers&#x27; Party. Teo thus elected as the MP representing the Pasir Ris Loyang ward of Pasir Ris GRC. In subsequent Cabinet reshuffles, he became Minister for Education while continuing to serve as Second Minister for Defence.

During the 2001 general election, Teo led the five-member PAP team contesting in the newly formed Pasir Ris–Punggol GRC and won an uncontested walkover. After winning the general election, he continued to hold his previous Cabinet portfolios while becoming the MP representing the Pasir Ris West ward of Pasir Ris–Punggol GRC. On 1 August 2003, Teo was appointed as Minister for Defence and Minister-in-charge of the Civil Service.

During the 2006 general election, Teo led a six-member PAP team to contest in Pasir–Ris Punggol GRC again and won 68.7% of the vote against the Singapore Democratic Alliance. He retained his parliamentary seat and continued holding his Cabinet portfolios. On 1 April 2009, Teo was appointed as one of two Deputy Prime Ministers, in addition to his portfolios as Minister for Defence and Minister-in-charge of the Civil Service.

Teo led a six-member PAP team to contest in Pasir–Ris Punggol GRC in the 2011 general election and won 64.79% of the vote against the Singapore Democratic Alliance. On 18 May 2011, Teo relinquished his Cabinet portfolio of Minister for Defence and took up the positions of Minister for Home Affairs and Coordinating Minister for National Security, while concurrently serving as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister-in-charge of the Civil Service.

On 1 May 2019, Teo relinquished his appointment as Deputy Prime Minister to become a Senior Minister, while retaining his position as Coordinating Minister for National Security. In his new role, he also oversaw four departments under the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office; Smart Nation and Digital Government Group, National Security Coordination Secretariat, National Population and Talent Division, and the National Climate Change Secretariat.

==Personal life==
Teo was married to Chew Poh Yim, who was the director of the business consultancy and part-time marketing management at Nanyang Polytechnic&#x27;s School of Business Management. Chew graduated from the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology in 1977 with a Bachelor of Science with honours degree in biochemistry. In 2015, she founded Stroke Support Station, a volunteering organisation that provides assistance to stroke survivors and caregivers. Chew died on 31 October 2021 at the age of 67. The couple have one son and one daughter.

Teo was also President of the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) between 1984 and 2014, and an advisor to the Singapore Dragon Boat Association.

<text>The 1996 AFC Asian Cup was the 11th edition of the men&#x27;s AFC Asian Cup, a quadrennial international football tournament organised by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). The finals were held in the United Arab Emirates between 4 and 21 December 1996. Saudi Arabia defeated hosts United Arab Emirates in the final match in Abu Dhabi.

==Tournament summary==
The tournament began with host United Arab Emirates against South Korea in group A, where the Emiratis played in a 1–1 draw. Subsequently, Kuwait was surprisingly held to a draw by Indonesia, the lead even being taken by the Indonesians. However, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and South Korea eventually established their position, with South Korea finishing in third place due to losing to Kuwait and inferior goal difference and qualified only as one of two best third-placed teams, while the host comfortably seized first place, leaving Indonesia bottom after two consecutive defeats to South Korea and the UAE. 

Group B easily saw Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq took three leading places in their group, with both teams managed to beat Thailand, which finished bottom with three defeats, and also each three of them suffered one defeat one to another. Iraq only finished third due to inferior goal difference, but qualified as the best third-place finisher. 

Meanwhile, group C was more entertaining, with both three last finishers grabbed one win each only. Debutant Uzbekistan, on its just first ever competitive participation of a major tournament and was regarded low, stunned entire of Asia by beating China with two late goals to gain three points in the team&#x27;s just first competitive match. Defending champions Japan however emerged as the only team to collect all three victories, while China recovered following the defeat to beat Syria. The Syrians grabbed its only win, a 2–1 win over Uzbekistan, but the team&#x27;s poor performance, with two defeats to Japan and China, cost the team from reaching the quarter-finals. Uzbekistan finished last despite the win over China, and was eliminated as well. 

The quarter-finals saw entire of East Asia slumped out. Defending champions Japan was crushed down by Kuwait, China lost after a seven-goal thriller with Saudi Arabia, while South Korea suffered a denting 2–6 loss to Iran, with Iran scored five goals in the second half. The host UAE continued its quest to win the trophy with a successful 1–0 win over Iraq thanked for the golden goal of Abdulrahman Ibrahim. The semi-finals became a West Asian affair and rematches of group A and B: Saudi Arabia took a successful revenge on Iran following the group stage, beating the Iranians on penalty, while the UAE killed Kuwaiti dream for the second time with another 1–0 win to set up final with Saudi Arabia. Iran eventually took third place after beating Kuwait on penalty, the match ended 1–1 draw. 

The final between the UAE and Saudi Arabia happened to be boring than expected. The two teams played defensively and lacking enthusiastic attacks in front of 60,000 spectators. Eventually, penalty had to be brought out, where the UAE missed two while Saudi Arabia only missed one, thus Saudi Arabia was crowned for its third trophy in the country&#x27;s fourth consecutive Asian Cup final. Thanked for the win, Saudi Arabia gained automatic berth to qualify for the 2000 AFC Asian Cup held in Lebanon.

<text>The 2000 AFC Asian Cup was the 12th edition of the men&#x27;s AFC Asian Cup, a quadrennial international football tournament organised by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). The finals were held in Lebanon between 12 and 29 October 2000. Japan defeated defending champion Saudi Arabia in the final match in Beirut.

==Qualification==
42 teams participated in a preliminary tournament. It was divided into 10 groups and the first-placed team of each group thus qualified. A total of 84 games were held, starting with the Oman versus Kyrgyzstan game on 3 August 1999.

The 12 qualifying teams were:

==Tournament summary==
Lebanon participated in the country&#x27;s first ever football competition in the history as host, but began disappointingly, losing 0–4 to Iran. Lebanon sought to reinvigorate the team against Iraq and Thailand, but all ended up in just draws, and Lebanon finished bottom in the group, the first host nation since Qatar 1988 to not progress from the group stage. Iran and Iraq managed to survive in the group A with seven and four points respectively, and Thailand took the third, but did not progress due to inferior points, having won no match in their group. Group B saw South Korea failed to achieve a top two finish, falling behind group winner China and Kuwait, but qualified as the best third place team, with the team&#x27;s only win was against Indonesia. Indonesia was the only team to not score a single goal in the tournament, being beaten by South Korea and China, and a goalless draw with Kuwait. Group C witnessed Uzbekistan to become the worst-performed team in the tournament, being heavily beaten 1–8 by Japan and 0–5 by defending champions Saudi Arabia. The Japanese scrambled to top the group with a famous 4–1 win over the Saudis, though Saudi Arabia would go on to progress together after an unpromising group stage performance. Qatar, another participant in the group, finished in third and progressed thanked for one point ahead of Thailand, having drawn in all three matches.

The quarter-finals saw Iran lost 1–2 to South Korea by a golden goal of Lee Dong-gook, and the same happened in Saudi Arabia&#x27;s victory over Kuwait, also by a golden goal of Nawaf Al-Temyat. China and Japan easily passed through their Arab rivals Qatar and Iraq, with 3–1 and 4–1 wins respectively, to set up an entirely East Asian affair in the semi-finals, with Saudi Arabia being the only non-East Asian team to be here.

The first semi-finals saw Saudi Arabia sealed the victory over the South Koreans, with two goals by Talal Al-Meshal at 76&#x27; and 80&#x27; meant Lee Dong-gook&#x27;s late equalizer was too little, too late. Japan beat China in a thriller in Beirut, 3–2, to once again face the Saudis in the final. In the third place match, South Korea won bronze with a 1–0 win over China.

The final in Beirut was filled with majority of Saudi supporters, and was seen as the rematch of the 1992 final and earlier group stage encounter. Hamzah Idris had a chance to take the Saudis ahead of Japan at 10&#x27;, but he missed the opportunity. Eventually, the missing penalty was what the Saudis regretted the most, because Shigeyoshi Mochizuki, who had accidentally given the Saudis the failed opportunity on the penalty earlier, became the hero of Japan with a goal in 30&#x27;. Saudi attempt proved to be fruitless, and Japan won the game by just one goal margin, to conquer its second Asian trophy, repeating Japan&#x27;s victory over Saudi Arabia eight years ago. Subsequently, Japan, the winner, automatically qualified for the 2004 AFC Asian Cup.

<text>Marcos Moshinsky Borodiansky (; ; 1921–2009) was a Mexican physicist of Ukrainian-Jewish origin whose work in the field of elementary particles won him the Prince of Asturias Prize for Scientific and Technical Investigation in 1988 and the UNESCO Science Prize in 1997.

==Early life==
He was born in 1921 into a Jewish family in Kyiv, Ukrainian SSR. At the age of three, he emigrated as a refugee to Mexico, where he became a naturalized citizen in 1942. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and a doctorate in the same discipline at Princeton University under Nobel Laureate Eugene Paul Wigner.

==Career==
In the 1950s he researched nuclear reactions and the structure of the atomic nucleus, introducing the concept of the &quot;transformation bracket for eigenstates of the quantum harmonic oscillator&quot;, which, together with the tables elaborated in collaboration with Thomas A. Brody, simplified calculations in the nuclear shell model and became an indispensable reference for the study of nuclear structure. In 1952, his work on the transient dynamics of matter waves led to the discovery of diffraction in time.

After completing postdoctoral studies at the Henri Poincaré Institute in Paris, France, he returned to Mexico City to serve as a professor at the UNAM. In 1967 he was chosen president of the Mexican Society of Physics and in 1972 he was admitted to the National College. He was the editor of several international scientific reviews, including the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot;, and authored four books and more than 200 technical papers. He received the Mexican National Prize for Science (1968), the Luis Elizondo Prize (1971), the Prince of Asturias Prize for Scientific and Technical Investigation (1988) and the UNESCO Science Prize (1997).

In 1990 he was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society &quot;for his many fundamental contributions to the description of many-body quantum systems through the use of group-theoretical techniques&quot; 

While practicing physics, he wrote a weekly column in the newspaper &quot;Excélsior&quot; on Mexican politics.

<text>Donna Douglas (born Doris Ione Smith; September 26, 1932 – January 1, 2015) was an American actress and singer, known for her role as Elly May Clampett on &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; (1962–1971). Following her acting career, Douglas became a real estate agent, gospel singer, inspirational speaker, and author of books for children and adults.

==Early life==
Douglas was born Doris Ione Smith in the community of Pride, East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, on September 26, 1932. The younger of two children, she was the only daughter of Emmett Ratcliff Smith Sr., who worked most of his life for Standard Oil, and his wife, Elma (née Robinson), a former telephone operator.

Douglas attended St. Gerard Catholic High School, where she played softball and basketball, and was a member of the school&#x27;s first graduating class. Douglas was named Miss Baton Rouge and Miss New Orleans in 1957.

==Career==
Douglas moved to New York City to pursue a career in show business, and started as an illustration model for toothpaste advertisements. She was featured as the &quot;Letters Girl&quot; on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Perry Como Show&quot; in 1957 and as the &quot;Billboard Girl&quot; on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; in 1959. These and other television appearances led New York photographers and newspaper reporters to award her the &quot;Miss By-line&quot; crown, which she wore on CBS&#x27; &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;.

Douglas appeared in a 1958 episode of &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot; &quot;Bilko and the Crosbys&quot; credited as Doris Bourgeois, her given name and her married name from her first marriage.

Hal B. Wallis saw the Sullivan episode and cast her in the role of Marjorie Burke in the movie drama &quot;Career&quot; (1959), starring Anthony Franciosa, Dean Martin, and Shirley MacLaine. This was followed by a bit part in the musical comedy &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; (1959) and the role of a secretary in the comedy/romance &quot;Lover Come Back&quot; (1961), starring Rock Hudson and Doris Day.

She made numerous television appearances in the late 1950s and early 1960s, including &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; (1960). She played Barbara Simmons in four 1961 episodes of the CBS detective series &quot;Checkmate&quot;. Her other credits include &quot;U.S. Marshal&quot;, &quot;Tightrope&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot;, &quot;Bachelor Father&quot;, &quot;Adam-12&quot;, and &quot;Route 66&quot;. Douglas also appeared in &quot;Thriller&quot;, season one, episode 16, &quot;The Hungry Glass&quot;.

===&quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;===
Although Douglas was an active actress in the 1960s, she was still relatively unknown when selected from among 500 young actresses to work on &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; (1962–1971). Continually typecast as a result of her &quot;Hillbillies&quot; role, Douglas decided to focus on her career as a gospel singer.

During the 1966 summer hiatus of &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, Douglas made her only starring feature-film appearance, cast as Frankie in Fred de Cordova&#x27;s &quot;Frankie and Johnny&quot; (1966) with Elvis Presley. The film proved popular, but did little to advance Douglas&#x27;s big-screen career.

With the 1973 death of &quot;Hillbillies&quot; co-star Irene Ryan, the 1980 death of Raymond Bailey, and Max Baer Jr.&#x27;s refusal to participate, Douglas joined Nancy Kulp and Buddy Ebsen in 1981 as the only original cast members to appear in the reunion movie &quot;Return of the Beverly Hillbillies&quot;. Douglas was a guest star on a number of other television programs and the subject of paper dolls, dolls, coloring books, and various toys during the height of the show&#x27;s popularity. In a 2003 interview with &quot;Confessions of a Pop Culture Addict&quot;, she summed up her views on the role: &quot;Elly May was like a slice out of my life. She is a wonderful little door opener for me because people love her, and they love the Hillbillies. Even to this day, it&#x27;s shown every day somewhere. But, as with any abilities, she may open a door for you, but you have to have substance or integrity to advance you through that door.&quot;

In 1992, Douglas and Baer attended Ebsen&#x27;s 84th-birthday celebration in Beverly Hills, California. In 1993, Douglas, Ebsen, and Baer reunited on &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot;, and for a final time in a CBS-TV television special, &quot;The Legend of The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;.

In December 2010, Mattel released a new collection of three Barbies called the Classic TV Collection. These dolls were Samantha Stephens (from &quot;Bewitched&quot;, played by Elizabeth Montgomery); Jeannie (from &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, played by Barbara Eden); and Elly May Clampett.
===After acting career===
Douglas received her real-estate license after &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; finished production. She did not work in that field long, however, as she remained in show business and found other projects.

Douglas frequently performed as a gospel singer and was a speaker at church groups, youth groups, schools, and colleges across the United States. One focus of her charitable work was speaking in support of various Christian children&#x27;s homes, mostly in the American South. She appeared at conventions and trade fairs. She recorded several gospel albums, the first released in 1982, and recorded a few minor country music records during the 1970s and 1980s.

Douglas wrote and published a religion-based children&#x27;s book titled &quot;Donna&#x27;s Critters and Kids: Children&#x27;s Stories with a Bible Touch.&quot; The book included Bible stories featuring animals combined with a coloring book. In November 2011, she released a new children&#x27;s book titled &quot;Miss Donna&#x27;s Mulberry Acres Farm&quot;. In 2013, Douglas published a cookbook, &quot;Southern Favorites with a Taste of Hollywood&quot;, which collects recipes of Southern cooking from show-business friends and colleagues such as Ebsen, Phyllis Diller, Valerie Harper, and Debbie Reynolds. The book also has a section on good manners called &quot;Hollywood Social Graces&quot;.

==Personal life==
Douglas married her first husband, Roland Bourgeois Jr., in 1951, with whom she had her only child, Danny Bourgeois, in 1954. The couple divorced that same year. She married Robert M. Leeds, director of &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, in 1971; they divorced in 1980.

In 1982 in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, Douglas enrolled at Rhema Bible Training Center, where she graduated in 1984 with an emphasis in children&#x27;s ministry.

Douglas and Buddy Ebsen remained close friends for 32 years. In a 2011 interview with &quot;The Lincoln Times-News&quot;, she described Ebsen as &quot;a wonderful man, very much like my own father, a quiet, reserved, and caring person&quot;.

In 2003, both Ebsen and Douglas&#x27;s mother, Elma Smith, died. Douglas and Max Baer, Jr had visited Ebsen in the hospital, and following his death, both delivered a eulogy at his funeral. A decade later, Douglas revealed the depth of her feelings for Ebsen in an interview with &quot;Confessions of a Pop Culture Addict&quot;: &quot;I loved Buddy Ebsen. He reminded me so much of my own dad. Most of my scenes were with Buddy, and most of Max&#x27;s with Irene. Buddy was just a wonderful man. I related to him so easily. The night before he died, Max and I went up to the hospital to see him.&quot;

===Lawsuits===

====&quot;Sister Act&quot;====
On June 10, 1993, Douglas and her partner Curt Wilson in Associated Artists Entertainment, Inc., filed a $200 million lawsuit against The Walt Disney Company, Whoopi Goldberg, Bette Midler, their production companies, and Creative Artists Agency claiming that &quot;Sister Act&quot; was plagiarised from a book, &quot;A Nun in the Closet&quot;, owned by the partners. Douglas and Wilson claimed that in 1985, they had developed a screenplay from the book.

The lawsuit claimed that more than 100 similarities and plagiarisms existed between the movie and the book/screenplay owned by Douglas and Wilson. The lawsuit claimed that the developed screenplay had been submitted to Disney, Goldberg, and Midler three times during 1987 and 1988. In 1994, Douglas and Wilson declined a $1 million offer to settle the case. The judge found in favor of Walt Disney Pictures and the other defendants. Wilson stated at the time, &quot;They would have had to copy our stuff verbatim for us to prevail.&quot;

====Mattel====
On May 4, 2011, Douglas filed a federal lawsuit claiming that Mattel and CBS Consumer Products used her name and likeness for a Barbie doll in the Classic TV Collection without her authorization. The suit alleged that packaging for the &quot;Elly May&quot; Barbie doll featured a photo of her portraying the character. She maintained that she had never endorsed the doll nor given Mattel permission to use her name to promote its sale, and she sought $75,000 in damages. She claimed that CBS and Mattel needed her approval to design the doll, while CBS and Mattel maintained that they did not need her consent or approval because the network held the exclusive rights to the character. It was settled on December 27, 2011, and details were confidential, but both sides claimed to be content with the outcome.

==Final years and death==
In addition to her frequent travelling for celebrity appearances and speeches, Douglas enjoyed gardening, spending time with friends and family, and answering her fan mail.

Douglas died of pancreatic cancer at Baton Rouge General Hospital on January 1, 2015, aged 82. She was buried in East Feliciana Parish, Louisiana&#x27;s Bluff Creek Cemetery.

Charlene Smith, Douglas&#x27;s niece by marriage, said that Douglas returned to live in East Baton Rouge Parish around 2005: &quot;She was always happy, always beautiful. You always saw her with all her makeup on. She never looked her age.&quot;

<text>Ricardo Enrique Alegría Gallardo (April 14, 1921 – July 7, 2011) was a Puerto Rican scholar, author, cultural anthropologist, and archaeologist known as the &quot;father of modern Puerto Rican archaeology&quot;. He was a professor at the University of Puerto Rico and the first director of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture. Alegria was the founder of the Museo de las Américas and of the Alpha Beta Chi fraternity.

==Early life==
Alegría was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico on April 14, 1921. His father, José S. Alegría, was a former vice president and founding member of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. It was Alegría&#x27;s father who instilled in him a sense of love and pride for Puerto Rico, its history, and culture. 

He received his primary and secondary education in San Juan, before attending the University of Puerto Rico. While there Alegría and Yamil Galib founded a new fraternity, Alpha Beta Chi. In 1942, Alegría earned his Bachelor of Science degree in archeology from the University of Puerto Rico. He continued his academic education at the University of Chicago where in 1947 he earned his master&#x27;s in Anthropology and History. In 1954, Alegría earned his Ph.D (doctorate) in Anthropology from Harvard University.

==Career==
Governor Luis Muñoz Marín named Alegría the first director of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture in the late 1950s. Alegría established the Center of Popular Arts, the Institute of Puerto Rican book publishing division. Alegría was responsible for the renovation and restoration of historical Old San Juan under the leadership of the San Juan mayor Felisa Rincón de Gautier. He also spearheaded the restoration of the ruins of the Caparra Archaeological Site and Fortín de San Gerónimo. As a result of his work Old San Juan was declared a Historical World Treasure. 

In 1976, Alegría opened the Center of Advanced Studies of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean. In 1992, he established the Museo de las Américas. He also formed the General Archive of Puerto Rico and the Puerto Rican Theater Festival. Alegría was also a professor at the University of Puerto Rico, where he created the Archaeological Research Center. 

Alegría was a pioneer in the anthropologic studies of the Taino culture and the African heritage in Puerto Rico. &quot;Caribbean Business&quot; points out that, &quot;His extensive studies have helped historians understand how the Taínos lived and suffered, before and after the Spanish conquistadors arrived on the island.&quot; Alegría estimated that about one-third of all Puerto Ricans have Taíno blood—results of recent DNA studies have proved him right.

==Awards and recognition==

In 1993, President Bill Clinton presented Alegría with the Charles Frankel Prize of the National Endowment for the Humanities for contributions to the field of archaeology. Alegría received the James Smithson Bicentennial Medal in 1996. Alegría received The Haydee Santamaria Medal in 2001. In 2002, the Puerto Rican Governor Sila Calderónpresented the Luis Muñoz Marín Medal to Alegríain recognition of his life achievements.
Alegría received recognition and honorary degrees from cultural and architectural organizations in Peru, Venezuela, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic. The city of Havana recognized his influence in the project to remodel the city&#x27;s historical district (similar to Alegría&#x27;s work in Old San Juan) by honoring him with a plaque, placed in front of the basilica de San Francisco de Asis in Old Havana, Cuba.

Puerto Rican folk duo &quot;Los Niños Estelares&quot; dedicated a tribute song to Alegría, named &quot;Alegría, Doctor Alegría&quot;, in their 2010 album, &quot;Namasté&quot;. In it they describe many of Alegría&#x27;s accomplishments, his educational background, and -partly in jest, due to Alegría&#x27;s impressive credentials- likened him to Indiana Jones. In the lyrics, they name Alegría &quot;the last Puerto Rican hero.&quot;

In 2011, the Museo de las Américas host a special exhibit, &quot;Richard Alegría: An Intimate Look&quot;, featuring photographs by Chendo Pérez. In 2021, the museum and filmmaker Amalia García Padilla released the documentary &quot;500 and 100: Ricardo Alegría on the Isleta de San Juan,&quot; commemorating the 500th anniversary of San Juan with narration by Alegría. 

Puerto Rican artist Lorenzo Homar honored Alegría in an artistic graphic poster. Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa was inspired by Alegría and included a fictional character based on him, named Ricardo Santurce, in the play &quot;El loco de los balcones&quot;.

==Personal life==
Alegría lived in Old San Juan in his later years, until his death on July 7, 2011. He had been hospitalized in San Juan&#x27;s &quot;Centro Medico&quot; (Medical Center Hospital) a few weeks before his death. After a brief recovery, he relapsed and was returned to the medical center, where he died of heart failure. Flags of Puerto Rico government offices were flown at half staff for five days of mourning. He was buried at Santa María Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

<text>The Douglas AIR-2 Genie (previous designation MB-1) was an unguided air-to-air rocket with a 1.5 kt W25 nuclear warhead. It was deployed by the United States Air Force (USAF 1957–1985) and Canada (Royal Canadian Air Force 1965–1968, Air Command 1968–1984) during the Cold War. Production ended in 1962 after over 3,000 were made, with some related training and test derivatives being produced later.

==Development==

The interception of Soviet strategic bombers was a major military preoccupation of the late 1940s and 1950s. The revelation in 1947 that the Soviet Union had produced a reverse-engineered copy of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, the Tupolev Tu-4 (NATO reporting name &quot;Bull&quot;), which could reach the continental United States in a one-way attack, followed by the Soviets developing their own atomic bomb in 1949, produced considerable anxiety.

The World War II-age fighter armament of machine guns and cannon were inadequate to stop attacks by massed formations of high-speed bombers. Firing large volleys of unguided rockets into bomber formations was not much better, and true air-to-air missiles were in their infancy. In 1954 Douglas Aircraft began a program to investigate the possibility of a nuclear-armed air-to-air weapon. To ensure simplicity and reliability, the weapon would be unguided, since the large blast radius made precise accuracy unnecessary.

The then top-secret project had various code names, such as &quot;Bird Dog&quot;, &quot;Ding Dong&quot;, and &quot;High Card&quot;. Full-scale development began in 1955, with test firing of inert warhead rockets commencing in early 1956. The final design carried a 1.5-kiloton W25 nuclear warhead and was powered by a Thiokol SR49-TC-1 solid-fuel rocket engine of thrust, sufficient to accelerate the rocket to Mach 3.3 during its two-second burn. Total flight time was about 12 seconds, during which time the rocket covered . Targeting, arming, and firing of the weapon were coordinated by the launch aircraft&#x27;s fire-control system. Detonation was by time-delay fuze, although the fuzing mechanism would not arm the warhead until engine burn-out, to give the launch aircraft sufficient time to turn and escape. However, there was no mechanism for disarming the warhead after launch. Lethal radius of the blast was estimated to be about . Once fired, the Genie&#x27;s short flight-time and large blast radius made it virtually impossible for a bomber to avoid destruction.

The new rocket entered service with the designation MB-1 &quot;Genie&quot; in 1957. The first interceptor squadrons to carry the MB-1 declared initial operational capability on 1 Jan. 1957, when a handful of rockets and 15 F-89 interceptors capable of carrying them were deployed at Wurtsmith Air Force Base in northern Michigan and Hamilton Air Force Base outside of San Francisco. By the next year, 268 F-89s had received the necessary wing pylon and fire-control system modifications to carry the weapon. While officially known as the MB-1 &quot;Genie&quot;, the rocket was often nicknamed &quot;Ding-Dong&quot; by crews and pilots. About 3,150 Genie rockets were produced before production ended in 1963. In 1962 the weapon was redesignated AIR-2A Genie. Many rounds were upgraded with improved, longer-duration rocket motors; the upgraded weapons sometimes known (apparently only semi-officially) as AIR-2B. An inert training round, originally MB-1-T and later ATR-2A, was also produced in small numbers – the training version was known to Canadian crews as the &quot;dum-dum&quot;.
A live Genie was detonated only once, in Operation Plumbbob on 19 July 1957. It was fired by USAF Captain Eric William Hutchison (pilot) and USAF Captain Alfred C. Barbee (radar operator) flying an F-89J over Yucca Flats. Sources vary as to the height of the blast, but it was between above mean sea level. A group of five USAF officers volunteered to stand uncovered in their light summer uniforms underneath the blast to prove that the weapon was safe for use over populated areas. They were photographed by Department of Defense photographer George Yoshitake who stood there with them. Gamma and neutron doses received by observers on the ground were negligible. Doses received by aircrew were highest for the fliers assigned to penetrate the airburst cloud ten minutes after explosion. 

While in service with the U.S. Air Force, the Genie was carried operationally on the F-89 Scorpion, F-101B Voodoo, and the F-106 Delta Dart. While the Genie was originally intended to be carried by the F-104 Starfighter using a unique &#x27;trapeze&#x27; launching rail, the project never proceeded beyond the testing phase. Convair offered an upgrade of the F-102 Delta Dagger that would have been Genie-capable, but it too was not adopted. Operational use of the Genie was discontinued in 1988 with the retirement of the F-106 interceptor.

The only other Genie user was Canada, whose CF-101 Voodoos carried Genies until 1984 via a dual-key arrangement where the missiles were kept under United States custody, and released to Canada under circumstances requiring their use. The RAF briefly considered the missile for use on the English Electric Lightning.

Safety features included final arming by detecting the acceleration and deceleration of a fast aircraft at high altitude. The weapon was built too early to use a permissive action link security device.

The F-89J that was used to launch the only live test is on static display at the Montana Air National Guard in Great Falls, Montana.

dBase product line; A Windows version was planned for release by Borland in 1992, but was delayed until January 1993, by which time Microsoft&#x27;s Access for Windows was available. It was last updated in 2009.

==Paradox for DOS==
Paradox for DOS was a relational database management system originally written by Richard Schwartz and Robert Shostak, and released by their Belmont, California-based company Ansa Software in 1985.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;among the first of an emerging generation of software making extensive use of artificial intelligence techniques,&quot; and noted that &quot;Paradox&quot; could read the competing Ashton Tate&#x27;s dBase files.

In September 1987, Borland purchased Ansa Software, including their Paradox/DOS 2.0 software. Notable classic versions were 3.5 and 4.5. Versions up to 3.5 were evolutions from 1.0. Version 4.0 and 4.5 were retooled in the Borland C++ windowing toolkit and used a different extended memory access scheme.

Paradox/DOS was a successful DOS-based database of the late 1980s and early 1990s. At that time, dBase and its xBase clones (Foxpro, Clipper) dominated the market. Other notable competitors were Clarion, DataEase, , and DataFlex.

The features that distinguished Paradox/DOS were:
* An enhanced design and implementation of visual Query by Example that was supported by an AI engine for heuristic, dynamic query optimization.
* Effective use of conventional, extended, and expanded memory – caching data tables and particularly indexes, which caused Paradox to execute tasks very quickly in contrast to the explicit skills required for xBase performance optimisation.
* An innovative programming language, the Paradox Application Language (PAL), that was readable, powerful, and could be recorded from keyboard actions (rather like Lotus 1-2-3 macro recording).
*Lotus-like text menus and windows, which was the native interface (in contrast to dBase, which had a command-line interface with menus layered on top).
* Particularly in Paradox 1.0 and 2.0, the user and programming manuals won readability awards – they were copiously illustrated, well laid out, and explanations were written in common English.

There are a few MSDOS emulators, among which are dbDOS (a paid-for product) and https://www.vdos.info/ (which has a freeware option), both of which provide the ability to run Paradox for DOS applications (such as Paradox 4.5 for DOS) on Windows Vista and above 64-bit operating systems.

==Paradox for Windows==
Paradox for Windows is distinctly different from Paradox for DOS, and was produced by a different team of programmers. Paradox for Windows applications are programmed in a different programming language called ObjectPAL. Although key features of the DOS product, the QBE and the database engine, were ports keeping the DOS code, there was a major break in compatibility from PAL to ObjectPAL and in the shift to a GUI design metaphor for Forms and Reports. The ObjectPAL changes were controversial but forced since PAL was based on keystroke recording actions that had no equivalent in Windows. An object-based language based on ideas from Hypercard was used in place of keystroke recording. The Forms and Reports designers used device-independent scaling including ability to work in zoomed mode for detailed layout. The mouse right-click was used for access to Forms and Reports properties, inspired by the Xerox Alto and Smalltalk, in a way now almost universal to Windows programs. The ObjectPAL was (like Hypercard) associated with the visual objects - also revealed by right click. Property inspection and layout tools could be &quot;pinned up&quot; to stay on screen, an idea borrowed from the NeXT and now fairly widely adopted in Windows.

For approximately the first year of development the object-oriented code was written in C aided by macros, until Turbo C++ was available, at which point the remaining parts of the code were written in C++. The product manager up until shipping version 1.0 was Joe Duncan. The development and QA team totaled about 30 people.

Both Paradox for Windows and Quattro Pro for Windows, a closely related project, started development under beta versions of Windows 3.0, in the spring of 1990. Paradox/Windows ended up delayed about a year beyond its original plan, shipping in early 1993. The reasons were many, but not entirely surprising for a major rewrite, in an OO language with new tools, shifting to a GUI paradigm, on what was essentially a first version operating system. Still it was a big problem for the company and Microsoft managed to ship Access a couple of months ahead of Paradox for Windows, a major marketing win for Microsoft.

In 1990, Borland also started work on an internal dBASE clone for both DOS and Windows, written in assembler, which was planned to ship in 1992. By early 1992 it became clear that Ashton-Tate was in difficulties on developing Windows versions of their products and so Borland switched plans, instead acquiring the company and anointing their internal project as the official successor. Part of the Ashton-Tate acquisition was the InterBase rdbms and it was decided that Paradox/W should be able to work with InterBase as well as the Paradox engine, and this led to the creation of an IDAPI engine based around InterBase.

The acquisition also shifted focus. Paradox had historically competed against dBASE in some markets, and Paradox/W originally was designed to improve the competitive position in the developer-oriented market. After dBASE was acquired, this was no longer desirable, and emphasis shifted toward an ease-of-use market. However the product could not be changed to match the emphasis (this occurred in later releases) at that late stage, making the product somewhat overly complex for the entry level market.

Microsoft&#x27;s first desktop database program, Microsoft Access, did a good job of addressing that same market, and got there first when it debuted at COMDEX November 1992. In response to Borland&#x27;s acquisition of Ashton-Tate, Microsoft acquired FoxPro and incorporated its Rushmore technology into the Access Jet Engine to significantly improve its performance.

Microsoft Access offered many features that were easier for end users and developers to implement, including a more intuitive query interface using Windows links between fields rather than the Paradox text tagging of fields in QBE, and the Access Basic programming language which was more similar to PAL than ObjectPAL. Access and Paradox significantly differed in the way they presented results from queries. Access showed records before a query was completed and without the overhead of creating an output table. Paradox showed the results only after all the records were retrieved and an ANSWER table created. This performance difference was significant for large datasets and negatively impacted Paradox/W.

Taking a cue from Borland&#x27;s low price Quattro Pro spreadsheet debut against Microsoft Excel,
Microsoft Access debuted with a $99 price. This undercut the traditional DBMS prices of Paradox DOS, Paradox Windows, and dBase of around $799, which negatively impacted Borland more than any other firm.

The Borland management team, with its 85% market share of the desktop database market, severely underestimated the threat of Microsoft and Microsoft Access. Still, Paradox/W sold well for a while. Meanwhile, Borland was going through some serious problems caused by the Ashton-Tate acquisition. Many product lines were discontinued, corporate reorganization and consolidation was painful, and, even worse, the internal dBASE project at the center of the acquisition rationale was eventually canceled for technical reasons, leaving Borland with a collapse in revenues and a serious need to develop the missing dBASE for Windows in a hurry. Borland lost the strength to fight the multiple marketing battles it needed for its range of products. Paradox was minimally marketed to the developers since the company decided it would hold out for a replacement of dBASE, which eventually came out in 1994, too late for the company.

To make matters worse, while the dBASE for DOS clone (FoxBase) copied dBASE closely, the Windows version of this product was developed without an existing dBASE for Windows model. One of dBASE for DOS&#x27;s strengths was multi-vendor support, and this was lost in the various Windows xBase products. Borland&#x27;s Visual dBASE for Windows couldn&#x27;t run Microsoft&#x27;s Foxbase for Windows programs and vice versa. Faced with a fragmented market and the need to rewrite programs to take advantage of Windows, there was little incentive for xBase users to stay loyal to the brand they&#x27;d used for DOS.

In 1995, Microsoft bundled Access into their Microsoft Office Professional Suite with Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. This effectively killed the end-user desktop database market for standalone products.
Despite solid follow-on versions with improvements to usability for entry-level users, Paradox faded from the market. It was included in the sale of Borland products to WordPerfect, which were in turn resold as WordPerfect got into financial products, and, at the time of writing, Paradox for Windows, WordPerfect, and Quattro Pro for Windows are all owned by Corel and sold as part of their office suite. dBASE for Windows came out too late to be a significant player in the Windows market: most dBASE programmers by then had migrated to Microsoft FoxBASE, a very similar database tool. Borland itself retained the InterBase/IDAPI server and focused efforts on its Delphi tools, which over the years gave it an influential but small part of the data-oriented developer market.

==Paradox Engine==
Paradox Engine was a precompiled C library allowing DOS programmers to use Paradox databases. It was available for Microsoft Quick C and Turbo C versions. Source code was not published, but all the functions included in the library were well documented.

==Corel Paradox==
Corel acquired certain rights to develop and market Paradox in the mid-1990s and released Corel Paradox 8 in 1997.

Paradox was also bundled in the professional version of Corel&#x27;s WordPerfect Office suite. Subsequent releases included Office Professional Edition versions 9, 10, 11, 12, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, X8, X9, and 2020. However, it has not been updated since 2009 with the Paradox Hot Fix 1 for X4. All later releases carry same version of 11.0.0.676.

==Users==
There is a strong Paradox user base, mainly centered on the &quot;Paradox Community&quot; and its associated newsgroups. On 30 July 2024, Larry DiGiovanni announced to the community that eventually the pnews.thedbcommunity.com server would go read-only and then be shut down entirely and that it would be replaced with a Google group, .

Although there are many fans of ObjectPAL, the programming language for Paradox/Windows, PAL/DOS scripts could not easily be migrated; the object and event models were completely different, forcing developers using PAL to completely rewrite their database applications.

==Reception==
Evaluating a prerelease beta of Paradox 3, &quot;BYTE&quot; in 1989 said that it &quot;has the potential of overtaking dBASE IV&quot; without being a dBASE clone. The magazine said that it &quot;has all the capabilities necessary for even the most advanced applications&quot; yet was, unlike competitors, easy to use.

<doc id="1013513" wikidata="Q360888" url="?curid=1013513" title="Geertgen tot Sint Jans">
<text>Geertgen tot Sint Jans (c. 1465 – c. 1495), also known as Geertgen van Haarlem, Gerrit van Haarlem, Gerrit Gerritsz, Gheertgen, Geerrit, Gheerrit, or any other diminutive form of Gerald, was an Early Netherlandish painter from the northern Low Countries in the Holy Roman Empire. No contemporary documentation of his life has been traced, and the earliest published account of his life and work is from 1604, in Karel van Mander&#x27;s &quot;Schilder-boeck&quot;.

According to van Mander, Geertgen was probably a pupil of Albert van Ouwater, one of the first oil painters in the northern Low Countries. Both painters lived in the city of Haarlem, where Geertgen was attached to the house of the Knights of Saint John, perhaps as a lay brother, for whom he painted an altarpiece. In van Mander&#x27;s book he states that Geertgen took the name of St. John without joining the order, thus his last name &quot;tot Sint Jans&quot; was derived from the order&#x27;s name and means &quot;unto Saint John&quot;.

==Biography==

Though van Mander calls him &quot;Geertgen tot Sint Jans, painter from Haarlem&quot;, indicating he was from Haarlem, it is possible that he was perhaps born in Leiden, then in the Burgundian Netherlands in the Holy Roman Empire, around the year 1465. The assignment of Leiden as his birthplace is traceable to a 17th-century print by Jacob Matham, where he is referred to as &quot;Gerardus van Leydanus&quot;. There is no known archival evidence for this claim by Matham. This print of &quot;The Lamentation of Christ&quot; from 1620, shows in the lower left corner &quot;&quot;Cum privil. Sa Cae. M. – Gerardus Leydanus Pictor ad S. Ia Bapt. Harlemi pinxit&quot; indicating he was a painter from Leiden at St John the Baptist in Haarlem. In the lower right hand corner it says &quot;Theodorus Matham Sculpsit. Iac Matham excud.&quot;&quot;, which means that son Theo made the sketch from the painting, and father Jacob Matham engraved it. It was printed in Haarlem in 1620, indicating that the painting was still there at that time. According to van Mander, this painting of the &quot;Lamentation&quot; was originally on the inside right door of a wood-panel triptych for the high altar of the St. John&#x27;s church in Haarlem, and the two side panels were sawed off from the central panel into two separate paintings after the Protestant Reformation. Both side panels are quite fragile and are located in separate museums today. Modern acceptance of Leiden as Geertgen&#x27;s birthplace is roughly traceable to Johann Kessler&#x27;s dissertation of 1930.

He died, probably still in his twenties, around the year 1495, in Haarlem, where he was buried in the commandry. Modern scholars have attempted to calculate the artist&#x27;s death date with the information from &quot;The Painting-Book&quot; (Middle Dutch: &quot;Het Schilder-boeck&quot;) by Karel van Mander, published in 1604. The reconstruction of Geertgen&#x27;s active dates has recently been done by Kemperdick and Sander in 2007 stating:

:(Geertgen&#x27;s) two paintings in Vienna indicate a self-assured artist; of the works attributed to Geertgen, they are certainly among the most mature and independent. If the artist was really only twenty-eight when he died, then the altarpiece began at about thirteen years of age and lasted four to six years, so that Geertgen can have ended his training at the earliest by the age of about eighteen. Should he have gone to work for one or two years as a journeyman, then the age at which he began to live by his art correspondingly rises. Accordingly, Geertgen worked a maximum of ten years independently. ...If one now dates the altarpiece for the Knights of St John to around 1490, then Geertgen must, roughly speaking, have been born around 1462/1467 – after the inscription on Matham&#x27;s engraving in Leiden – and would have begun his apprenticeship around 1475/80.

In the 14th century Haarlem was a major city. It was the second largest city in historical Holland after Dordrecht and before Delft, Leiden, Amsterdam, Gouda and Rotterdam. In 1429 the city gained the right to collect tolls, including ships passing the city on the Spaarne river. At the end of the Middle Ages Haarlem was a flourishing city with a large textile industry, shipyards and beer breweries.

Around 1428 the city was put under siege by the army of Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut. Haarlem had taken sides with the Cods in the Hook and Cod wars, and thus against Jacoba of Bavaria. The entire Haarlemmerhout wood was burnt down by the enemy. In 1469 the commandry of St. John in Haarlem was promoted to a special status that fell directly under the grand Prior of Germany. Before that it was a subordinate commandry of the Balij of Utrecht, which had 12 commandries reporting to it. The commandry of St. John became quite wealthy from donations by the local families Berkenrode, Assendelft, van Brederode, Tetrode, Schoten, and Adrichem. Schoten was also the location of a St. Lazarus church (currently part of Museum van de Geest) that later came into the possession of the St. Janskerk.
Geertgen painted &quot;The Lamentation of Christ&quot; for the altarpiece of the church of the Knights of Saint John in Haarlem. The painting Lamentation was copied by Jacob Matham in 1620, a mirror image engraving, that includes a Latin poem by Joan Albert Ban, a dedication to Jacob van Campen, and Latin quote by Albrecht Dürer, showing that three men were inspired by this painting. The other side of this altarpiece is showing the burning of the bones of St. John and probably contains a group portrait of the Haarlem members of the order of St. John, with the Commandeur or Precepteur holding the finger of St. John. The St. John&#x27;s church in Haarlem is where this painting formed the main altarpiece, currently home for the North Holland Archives.

==Painting==
Of the paintings mentioned by Van Mander, the only one to survive is one wing of his triptych for an altar of the Knights of St. John at Haarlem, the two sides of which were sawn apart in about 1600, and are now in Vienna as &quot;The Legend of the Relics of St. John the Baptist&quot;, and the &quot;Lamentation of Jesus&quot;. The rest was destroyed during the siege of Haarlem in 1573.

As is typical of the art of the time it was done primarily on oak panels with oil paints made by mixing pigments with drying oil. This allowed the painter to build up layers of paint to provide different visual effects.

The number of works attributed to him (varying between 12 and 16) is under dispute among scholars who discuss the artist (Kessler, Boon, Snyder, Chatelet, Fiero, and Koch).

His paintings are in the collections of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the Gemäldegalerie in Berlin, the National Gallery, London (&quot;Nativity at Night&quot;), the Musée du Louvre (&quot;The raising of Lazarus&quot;) in Paris, Museum Catharijneconvent in Utrecht (&quot;Man of Sorrows&quot;) and the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.

==Reception==
Van Mander states that Albrecht Dürer said of Geertgen &quot;Truly he was a painter in his mother&#x27;s womb&quot;, although Dürer&#x27;s journal of his Netherlandish travels doesn&#x27;t mention the painter, and it has been suggested that Van Mander was using a form of epideictic rhetoric to build esteem for a fellow Haarlemer.

==Technique==
Like most painters of his time, he painted with oil paint on wood panels. His paintings depict scenes derived from the New Testament and belong to the early Dutch School. Some of his paintings were destroyed during the Reformation. Around twelve surviving paintings are attributed to him (see below), with others believed to be copies by others of lost originals by him. Painting at that time was a trade to which one entered by apprenticeship at a young age in an established workshop. With modern techniques it is now possible to see some underdrawings that Geertgen made on his panels.

==Portrayal of music==

In his &quot;The Glorification of the Virgin&quot;, also known as &quot;Madonna with Musical Angels&quot; and originally part of the so-called &quot;Rotterdam-Edinburgh Diptych&quot;, the figures of Maria and the infant Jesus are surrounded by three concentric rings which appear to be surrounding a central halo. This &quot;halo&quot; is usually associated with the biblical verse in the Book of Revelation referring to the woman clothed in the Sun, interpreted as representing the Madonna in heaven.

The original diptych was first presented with a left panel of identical size usually referred to as Geertgen&#x27;s &quot;Passion of Christ&quot;. Within the concentric rings of the halo in the &quot;Madonna with Musical Angels&quot; panel are found a variety of musical instruments. This painting shows some of the oldest pictures of musical instruments known in the Netherlands (c.1480–1490). In the central depiction of the infant Jesus with the Madonna, the infant Jesus is depicted as playing a pair of bells, and seems to be playing music as if in response to one of the angels in the outermost concentric ring, holding an identical set of bells and looking directly back at the infant Jesus.

<text>Open House London, now known as Open House Festival, is an annual festival celebrating the architecture and urban landscape of London. It is staged by the charity Open City which campaigns to make London a more accessible, equitable and open city. Starting in London in 1992 the festival has spread to over 60 of cities across the world. During the Open House Festival, many buildings considered to be of architectural significance open their doors for free public tours.

The 2019 event featured over 800 buildings, neighbourhood walks, architects&#x27; talks, cycle tours, and more. Well-known buildings not usually open to the public which were open on Open House weekend in 2005, for example, included Marlborough House, Lancaster House, Mansion House, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and Horse Guards.

Outside of the Open House festival, Open City organises other projects including year-round tours, lectures and educational events for children and young people.
== The Open House Key ==
The Open House festival uses a key as its emblem, the blade formed in the shape of London&#x27;s skyline.

<doc id="1013518" wikidata="Q7487182" url="?curid=1013518" title="Shalford Mill">
<text>Shalford Mill is an 18th-century Grade II* listed watermill located on the River Tillingbourne in Shalford, near Guildford, Surrey, England. In 1932, the mill was endowed to the National Trust by a group of eccentric young female philanthropists calling themselves Ferguson&#x27;s Gang.

==History==
The Domesday Book records a mill being present on the site in 1086 - one of the five mills recorded as part of the great manor of Bramley. In the 15th century, the mill was owned by John atte Lee, and in the 16th by Sir Edmund Walsingham; in 1599 it was sold to George Austen.

The present timber-framed building, built around 1750 by John Mildred of Guildford, was unusual in that it originally housed two separate mills, each with its own waterwheel and machinery. The mill was operated for most of the 18th century by the Mildred family, first by John, then by his sons, Thomas and John, and then by his grandson, Daniel. In 1794 it was sold to Robert Austen and remained in his family, later the Godwin-Austens, for the rest of its working life. The eastern half of the mill ceased operation about 1870 and the machinery was removed. The western half remained in operation until 1914. Subsequently, the mill was used as a seed store and later as a furniture store. By 1927 it was unused.

===Enter Ferguson&#x27;s Gang===
In danger of being demolished with its timbers sold off and the land marketed as building plots, Peggy Pollard, alias Bill Stickers, and Brynhild Catherine Jervis-Read, alias Sister Agatha, of Ferguson&#x27;s Gang, persuaded the Godwin-Austen trust to donate the watermill to the National Trust on the understanding that the Gang would raise the money for its repair and future running costs. The repair was supervised by the conservation architect John Eric Miers Macgregor OBE who went on to become an important member of Ferguson&#x27;s Gang and was given the pseudonym &quot;The Artichoke&quot;. The titular head of the Godwin Austen Estate, Major Arthur Godwin-Austen was admitted to the Gang and given the pseudonym of &quot;The Pious Yudhishthira&quot;. From 1932 until 1966, Ferguson&#x27;s Gang had its headquarters at Shalford Mill.

The gang&#x27;s headquarters are opened to the public by the present tenant of Shalford Mill on request. Amongst other 1930s memorabilia there are two bunks salvaged from the R100 airship.

The National Trust converted the eastern half to residential accommodation. The western half with its machinery was preserved and restored though not to working order.

==The Mill==
The mill was constructed to a very high standard, presumably as a demonstration of John Mildred&#x27;s status. The timber-framed building has a clay tile roof and the walls are tile-hung to the level of the brick base. Diamond pattern leaded lights echo the tiling. Uniquely in Surrey, it has a lucam or projection of the upper story over the roadway to allow wagons to be loaded and unloaded easily.

===Machinery===
Originally each half of the mill had two pairs of millstones, the eastern sets were used to produce high quality flour for the domestic market. The western sets consisted of a coarse pair for grinding animal feed and a fine pair for grinding corn. Each pair was driven by a diameter breastshot water wheel. After the eastern side was closed a third pair of stones was added to the western half.

===Millers===
Though the Mildreds were the original proprietors, they probably employed a miller to do the actual work.
After the sale in 1794 the following millers are known:
*John Sparkes, until 1830
*John Lambert
*Charles, Abraham and Daniel Lambert, sons of John
*George Lambert, John&#x27;s grandson, until 1882
*Thomas and Frederick Botting
*Henry Botting, until 1917.

==Public access==
The mill opens to the public on Wednesdays and Sundays during the summer months.

<text>St. Paul, originally known as St-Paul-de-Métis or St-Paul-des-Métis, is a town in East-Northern Alberta, Canada that is surrounded by the County of St. Paul No. 19. It was known as St. Paul de(s) Métis between 1912 and 1936.

The community of St-Paul-de-Métis has historical significance related to the Métis people in the region. The area was settled by Métis families who played a vital role in the fur trade and the early development of the region. The Métis, with their mixed Indigenous and European ancestry, established themselves in the area and contributed to its cultural heritage.

The community takes its name from the Catholic mission and parish established in the late 19th century. The parish was dedicated to Saint Paul the Apostle and became a focal point for religious, social, and cultural activities for the local Métis population.

The community was founded as a Métis colony in 1896 after missionary Albert Lacombe petitioned the Canadian government for a land grant reserved for the Métis people to farm. The colony was founded as Saint-Paul-des-Métis on four townships of federal government property which was leased for 99 years at a rate of $1 per year. Each Métis family which settled in the area received 80 acres of land, livestock, farming equipment and access to collective land, and soon after a chapel, boarding school, sawmill and windmill were constructed in the colony. The colony experienced significant hardships due to storms and a fire in 1905 which resulted in the colony&#x27;s failure and termination of the government lease in 1908. One of the original structures of the colony, the Old St. Paul Rectory, a mission site built as the administrative centre for the Oblate priests remains standing today, and is designated an Alberta Provincial Historical Resource.

Following the failure of the Métis colony the area was opened up to other Canadians, and under the care of Father Thérien, 450 people including French-Catholic Canadian homesteads were registered in the area in on 2 days in 1909, and the community was incorporated as the Village of St. Paul &quot;de&quot; Métis on June 14, 1912, though it was referred to as St. Paul &quot;des&quot; Métis by June 6, 1922, and would later incorporate as the Town of St. Paul, removing any mention of the Métis on December 15, 1936. The community would construct a 48 km railroad track to connect the village with the Canadian railway network in 1920, which had stopped at Spedden, Alberta.

== Attractions ==
St. Paul is home to the world&#x27;s first UFO landing pad, built as part of the 1967 Canadian Centennial celebrations in an effort to attract both tourists and Martians to the community. The pad consists of a 30-tonne raised platform with a map of Canada embossed on the back stop, consisting of stones provided by each province of Canada. On June 3, 1967, Paul Hellyer, Minister of National Defence, flew in by helicopter to officially open the Pad. The pad was one of over 100 Centennial Projects organized by the town. The idea for the UFO landing pad is credited to former town Mayor Jules Van Brabant and a couple of local business owners, the concrete and steel materials for the landing pad were donated by local construction companies, and a local designer developed the blueprint for the mushroom-shaped pod.

The sign beside the pad reads: &quot;The area under the World&#x27;s First UFO Landing Pad was designated international by the Town of St. Paul as a symbol of our faith that mankind will maintain the outer universe free from national wars and strife. That future travel in space will be safe for all intergalactic beings, all visitors from earth or otherwise are welcome to this territory and to the Town of St. Paul.&quot; Mentioned in George Fox&#x27;s song, Real Canadian Town. The UFO Landing pad was also featured across Canada as a film crew with Cineplex Entertainment was in the town in May 2014 filming a pre-show piece to be played in Cineplex movie theatres across Canada throughout the month of June. The UFO landing pad was visited by Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip during their 1978 tour of Canada, which also included stops at the Vegreville egg and in other communities in Eastern Alberta.

<text>Playland, often called Rye Playland and also known as Playland Amusement Park, is an amusement park located in Rye, New York, along the Long Island Sound. Built in 1928, the park is owned by the Westchester County government. Beginning in 2022 the park has been operated under contract by Standard Amusements.

==History==
===Late 19th and early 20th centuries===

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Playland&#x27;s waterfront area of Westchester County along the Long Island Sound was the site of a growing collection of recreational developments, including hotels, resorts, and &quot;amusement areas&quot;. Local residents concerned about &quot;unsavory crowds&quot; petitioned the Westchester County Park Association to purchase two existing theme parks, Rye Beach and Paradise Park, and replace them with a local-government-sponsored amusement park.

Frank Darling, a veteran park manager with experience at Coney Island and the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley, was hired to design and run the new park, called Playland. The well-known NYC architectural firm Walker &amp; Gillette and landscape architect Gilmore D. Clarke were commissioned to produce a comprehensive design of both buildings and grounds, making Playland the first planned amusement park in the country.

Construction commenced in September 1927, and was completed in six months. The park began operation on May 26, 1928. Rides that were operating on Playland&#x27;s opening day included the Grand Carousel, Derby Racers, The &quot;Original&quot; Whip (there is a historic sign referencing its 1928 creation) and the Dragon Coaster. The Airplane Coaster was added in 1928 while the Casino opened in 1929.

===Late 20th century===
In 1966, a major fire at the amusement park claimed some of Rye Playland&#x27;s all-time classic attractions, including the original Bumper Car ride and the &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; Funhouse.

The Marriott Corporation managed the park in 1981 and 1982 as part of a two-year experimental period. During those two seasons, the park was run at a loss in excess of $5 million. Westchester County took over operation in 1983.

Playland was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987. At the time, it was the United States&#x27; only Art Deco amusement park.

===21st century===

By 2001, Playland was Westchester&#x27;s most visited park, seeing one million visitors that year. For the 2002 season, Playland unveiled three new rides: the Kite Flyer, Crazy Mouse, and Sky Skater. Until the beginning of the 2002–2003 National Hockey League season, the New York Rangers practiced at the Playland Ice Casino. Currently, , the hockey team from Manhattanville College, located in nearby Purchase, plays its home games at Playland.

In 2012, Hurricane Sandy claimed parts of Playland&#x27;s boardwalk, flooded and caused substantial damage to the Ice Casino, and scattered debris throughout Read Sanctuary. As a result of damage sustained during the hurricane, the north boardwalk remained closed until 2018.

In May 2016, the Westchester County Board of Legislators voted 13–4 to give control of the park to a management company called Standard Amusements. Standard Amusements agreed to invest $27.5 million into the park, which it will manage for 30 years. Westchester County maintains ownership of the park, and will receive an annual base rent and 8% of the park&#x27;s profits after Standard Amusements has recouped its initial investment.

In 2019, Playland unveiled its first ride since 2008, a Disk&#x27;O half-pipe made by Zamperla. Playland did not operate its 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Standard Amusements leased the park for three decades starting in 2022. Playland began its $125 million 5-year revitalization project the same year. The project saw the rebuild of the Derby Racer canopy, new and updated bathrooms across the park, new and updated midway games, as well as 3 new rides: Old Rye Motorbike Factory, Catch N&#x27; Air, and the Tornado. In January 2025, Standard Amusements sought to terminate its agreement to operate Playland, claiming that the county had not upheld an agreement to upgrade the park. As a result, the Westchester County government took over operations for the 2025 season.

==Attractions==
Admission to Playland is free for Westchester residents who wish to observe the attractions. However, visitors must pay for a wristband that will give them all-day access to ride all of the attractions. Non-Westchester residents must pay admission to get inside Playland and an additional fee for the wristband. Westchester residents generally also pay a lower price for the wristbands than non-Westchester residents. To keep the price of each ride low, Westchester County&#x27;s government offers sponsorships to businesses in exchange for annual naming rights for a ride, in addition to sponsorships for concerts, fireworks, and revues.

Walker &amp; Gillette&#x27;s asymmetrical beaux arts plan integrated Playland&#x27;s three major components. The first component, a swimming park, is defined by a semi-elliptical beach, boardwalk, and arcade. At the center of this arcade, a Spanish Revival bathhouse and pool terminates the automobile approach along Playland Parkway and its twin towers frame a view of Long Island Sound. The second component, an amusement park, is laid out along an axial landscaped mall at roughly 90 degrees to the Parkway approach. An entrance plaza with central fountain at the beach end of this axis is defined by corner pavilions and anchored by a casino and ice rink building. The axial mall is flanked by colonnades which serve to visually organize the various rides, games, and restaurants on each outboard side. A midway cross-axis terminates in a gate at the large parking lot on its inland end and at a promontory at its waterside end. The main axis terminates in a 100 foot tall Music Tower that now has a performance stage at its base. All original amusement park buildings are in an Art Deco style. The third component, a boating lake, lies beyond the tower. Its boathouse consists of two pavilions symmetrically flanking a central colonnade, facing a terrace and boat dock and the lake.

Playland is home to the &quot;Grand Carousel&quot;, a 1915 Mangels-Carmel carousel. It has four rows with 48 jumpers, 18 standers and three chariots. It was originally in New Haven, Connecticut, and moved to Playland when the park opened in 1927. The Grand Carousel has a rare band organ built by the Gavioli company in Italy. The organ enclosure features two male figures that strike bells in time to the music while the central female figure moves a baton. The Grand Carousel contains designs including those on the horses that are completely hand-carved and painted by Charles Carmel from Brooklyn, New York. The horses possess many unique traits that include elaborate &quot;fish scale&quot; blankets, inlaid gemstones, armor and lolling tongues on several.

Playland is also home to one of only three still in existence. The Derby Racer was built in 1927 for Playland by Prior &amp; Church with horses carved by Marcus Charles Illions, a turn of the century New York carousel horse carver. The Derby Racer rotates at - three times the speed of a normal carousel. The horses move back and forth as well as up and down, simulating a true gallop as it races around the track. The other &quot;Derby Racing Carousels&quot; are located at Cedar Point, in Sandusky, Ohio; and Blackpool Pleasure Beach, in Blackpool, Lancashire, United Kingdom. Playland also features an upcharge Go Kart track.

Playland was used for some scenes in the Movie &quot;Big&quot;.

It also had a full service fine-dining restaurant and an outdoor café. It had smaller dining rooms upstairs for upscale private dinners. A renovation in the 1970s added a kiddie rink as well as a mid-sized ice rink. A renovation to the main ice rink that included a new surface, boards and glass was completed in 2007 for the Empire State Games.

== Emergency services ==
The Westchester County Police provides law enforcement services throughout the year, but the park is only officer-patrolled on a 24-hour basis from April to October. In addition to County Police, the park employs seasonal park rangers. Uniformed park rangers work under the supervision of county police officers. They assist park users, provide information on park rules and procedures, help in searches for lost children, and make regular security checks of buildings and facilities.

Westchester County Parks Emergency Medical Service provides basic life support services to the guests and employees of the park, and maintains the park&#x27;s two first aid stations. Paramedic and ambulance transport services are provided through Port Chester-Rye-Rye Brook Emergency Medical Service. The Rye Fire Department handles all fire and rescue calls at Playland.

==Incidents==
===Dragon Coaster===
* On September 2, 1988, an 8-year-old girl choked to death while chewing gum on the ride.

===Mind Scrambler===
* On May 22, 2004, a 7-year-old girl from New Rochelle was killed when she fell out of the ride after she opened her restraining bar.
* On June 29, 2007, a 21-year-old female park employee from White Plains was killed when the ride was started by a second employee while the victim was still assisting guests with their safety restraints. Park officials stated that a safety precaution (put in place after the 2004 Mind Scrambler incident) was not followed. A report issued by the State&#x27;s Labor Department on August 24, 2007, stated that the ride operators were running the ride improperly. The ride owner was cited for providing inadequate training. Due to this incident the Mind Scrambler was closed permanently.

===The Whip===
* On August 18, 1938, a 19-year-old man was killed after being flung off The Whip.

===Wild Mouse===
* On July 8, 1984, six people were taken to the hospital after suffering injuries when one of the trains they were riding in collided into another. The ride was shut down for investigation and later reopened. Park officials stated that a mechanical failure was the cause of the accident.

=== Music Express ===

* On July 28, 2023, the Music Express ride malfunctioned, leaving riders spinning backwards on the ride despite efforts to stop it until power was disconnected from the ride.

===Ye Old Mill===
* On August 3, 2005, a 7-year-old boy from Norwalk, Connecticut died of blunt force trauma to the head after he climbed out of a boat on the Ye Old Mill ride, where he became trapped underwater by a conveyor belt. The victim&#x27;s family sued the county that owned Playland, and on March 24, 2009, the defendants were ordered to pay US$1.25 million, as well as create a scholarship in the victim&#x27;s name. The scholarship will be awarded annually to Playland employees who exhibit excellence in safety and customer service.

===Accidental drowning===
* On July 4, 2006, a 43-year-old woman from Queens drowned after walking into a man-made lake that is off-limits to swimmers. An autopsy showed the victim had a blood alcohol level seven times the legal limit.

<text>Manuel Guillermo Pinto (1783 – June 28, 1853) was an Argentine general and lawmaker.

Pinto was born in Buenos Aires, and studied at the Royal College of San Carlos. He completed further studies in Spain, but returned to fight during the British invasions of the Río de la Plata, in 1807. He was among the signatories to the Cabildo abierto that voted in favor of Independence on May 22, 1810, and fought during the Argentine War of Independence in various auxiliary posts, reaching the rank of colonel in 1815.

Pinto served as leader of the Council of Representatives during the progressive tenure of Buenos Aires Province Governor Martín Rodríguez, from 1821 to 1824, and represented Misiones Province from 1824 to 1827. He was again elected President of the Buenos Aires Legislature in 1833, but stepped down upon the granting of absolute power to Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas, in 1835.

He returned to public life following the defeat of Rosas in the Battle of Caseros in 1852, and following the September 11, 1852, uprising by the province in a bid for greater autonomy, he twice served as provisional governor: from September 11 to October 31, 1852, and December 7, 1852, until his death.

<doc id="1013539" wikidata="Q2705814" url="?curid=1013539" title="BMW iDrive">
<text>iDrive is an in-car communications and entertainment system, used to control most secondary vehicle systems in late-model BMW cars. It was launched in 2001, first appearing in the E65 7 Series. The system unifies an array of functions under a single control architecture consisting of an LCD panel mounted on the dashboard and a control knob mounted on the center console.

iDrive introduced the first multiplexed MOST Bus/Byteflight optical fiber data busses with a very high bit rate in a production vehicle. These are used for high-speed applications such as controlling the television, DVD, or driver assistance systems like adaptive cruise control, infrared night vision or head-up display.

iDrive allows the driver (and, in some models, front-seat passengers) to control the climate (air conditioner and heater), audio system (radio and CD player), navigation system, and communication system.

iDrive is also used in modern Rolls-Royce models, as Rolls-Royce is owned by BMW, and in the 2019 onwards Toyota Supra is a collaboration between BMW and Toyota. BMW also owns the Mini brand, and a pared-down version of iDrive is available on those cars, branded as &quot;Connected&quot;.

==iDrive Generations==

===iDrive (1st Gen)===

An early prototype iDrive (called the Intuitive Interaction Concept) was featured on the BMW Z9 concept in 1999.
The production version debuted in September 2001 in the BMW 7 Series (E65) and was built on the VxWorks kernel while the Navigation computer used Microsoft Windows CE for Automotive; this can be seen when the system reboots or restarts after a software crash, displaying a &quot;Windows CE&quot; logo.

The first generation of iDrive controllers in the 7 Series was equipped with only a rotary knob. The GPS computer (&quot;NAV01&quot;, located in the trunk) was only capable of reading map CDs.

In October 2003, a menu and a customizable button was added to the controller. The new GPS computer (&quot;NAV02&quot;) was updated to read DVDs, featured a faster processor and the ability to display the map in bird&#x27;s-eye view (&quot;perspective&quot;).

In April 2005, the iDrive controller was changed again, the turn knob having a new leather top. The last hardware update of the GPS unit (&quot;NAV03&quot;) got a faster processor again. The map display is antialiased. The 8.8&quot; wide-screen display was updated, having a brighter screen and the ability to control a MP3 capable 6 CD-changer or a BMW iPod Interface. Possible options include a TV tuner, DVD changer, BMW Night Vision, side view camera and a rear view camera.

===iDrive Business (M-ASK)===
M-ASK stands for MMI Audio System controller and is manufactured by Becker. This is a limited version of the iDrive computer with a small 6.6&quot; display and is only found on 5, 6 Series and the X5 or X6, without the navigation option.

In addition, it can be ordered as an option in Europe on the 1 Series, 3 Series and 5 series as &quot;Business navigation&quot;, which has basic navigation abilities. Early versions of the Business navigation could only display directional arrows, but the latest version can also display 2D maps. iDrive Business Navigation uses a different map DVD than iDrive Professional Navigation. In addition, as only one optical drive is available, one cannot use both navigation and listen to a CD simultaneously.

When iDrive Professional is ordered the M-ASK system is replaced by iDrive CCC Professional with a dual slot dash mounted drive computer and larger 8.8&quot; display.

iDrive Business is available on the following cars;
* iDrive Business Navigation (optional)
** 1 Series E81/E82/E87/E88
** 3 Series E90/E91/E92/E93
** 5 Series E60/E61
* iDrive Business (default when navigation is not ordered)
** 6 Series E63/E64
** X5 E70
** X6 E71

The above list can vary depending on the region.

===iDrive Professional Navigation (CCC) [iDrive 2.0]===

It debuted in 2003 with the E60/E61 5 Series and is based on Wind River VxWorks, a real-time operating system.
CCC stands for Car Communication Computer and uses a larger 8.8&quot; wide-screen display. It was available on the following cars as an option;

* 1-Series E81/E82/E87/E88 - 06/2004 – 09/2008
* 3-Series E90/E91/E92/E93 - 03/2005 – 09/2008
* 5-Series E60/E61 - 12/2003 – 11/2008
* 6-Series E63/E64 - 12/2003 – 11/2008
* X5 E70 - 03/2007 – 10/2009
* X6 E71 - 05/2008 – 10/2009

CCC based systems use a map DVD from Navteq in a dedicated DVD drive.

====CCC - Update 1====

This is a minor update to iDrive Professional debuted in March 2007. It adds additional programmable buttons in the dashboard to directly access frequent functions and it removes the haptic feedback from the iDrive controller. It is available on the following cars as an option;
* 1 Series E81/E82/E87/E88 manufactured between March 2007 and September 2008
* 3 Series E90/E91/E92/E93 manufactured between March 2007 and August 2008
* 5 Series E60/E61 manufactured between March 2007 and August 2008
* 6 Series E63/E64 manufactured between March 2007 and August 2008
* X5 E70 manufactured until MY2010
* X6 E71

====CCC - Update 2====

This is a minor update debuted in September 2008 for Model Year 2009 cars equipped with iDrive Professional that did not get the new CIC based system. These cars get the new iDrive controller that is also used on cars with CIC. The actual iDrive computer (CCC) remains the same. This update is available on the following cars;
* 5 Series E60/E61 manufactured in September 2008 to February 2009 (to October 2008 for European production)
* 6 Series E63/E64 manufactured in September 2008 to February 2009 (to October 2008 for European production)

===iDrive Professional Navigation (CIC) [iDrive 3.0]===
It debuted in September 2008 with F01/F02 7 Series. CIC stands for Car Information Computer and is manufactured by Becker, utilizing the QNX operating system. It is available on the following cars as an option:

* 1-Series E81/E82/E87/E88 - 09/2008 – 08/2013
* 1-Series F20/F21 - 09/2011 – 03/2013
* 3-Series E90/E91/E92/E93 - 09/2008 – 10/2013 
* 3-Series F30/F31/F34/F80 - 02/2012 – 11/2012
* 5-Series E60/E61 - 11/2008 – 05/2010
* 5-Series F07 - 10/2009 – 07/2012 
* 5-Series F10 - 03/2010 – 09/2012
* 5-Series F11 - 09/2010 – 09/2012
* 6-Series E63/E64 - 11/2008 – 07/2010
* 6-Series F06 - 03/2012 – 03/2013
* 6-Series F12/F13 - 12/2010 – 03/2013 
* 7-Series F01/F02/F03 - 11/2008 – 07/2013 
* 7-Series F04 - 11/2008 – 06/2015

* X3 F25 - 10/2010 – 04/2013
* X5 E70 - 10/2009 – 06/2013 
* X6 E71 - 10/2009 – 08/2014
* Z4 E89 - 02/2009 – 08/2016

The CIC system is a major update to iDrive, replacing the display, computer and the controller. The display is of a higher resolution, and is generally more responsive than CCC, to address one of the common complaints of iDrive. Internet access is also supported.

CIC-based systems use maps from TeleAtlas that are installed on an internal 2.5&quot; 80 GB Hard Disk Drive (HDD). This HDD can also store up to 8 GB of music files for playback. For facilitating the uploading of music files to the HDD, a USB port is provided in the glove box.

Following 2009 LCI production, all CIC-based iDrive systems support DVD video. This, however, is only operational when the vehicle is in the &quot;Park&quot; position for automatic transmissions, or while the parking brake is set for vehicles that have a manual transmission. DVD audio will continue to play while driving.

===iDrive Professional NBT (Next Big Thing) [iDrive 4.0]===

BMW introduced a further update to the iDrive Professional System in early 2012, calling it the &quot;Next Big Thing&quot; (NBT). It was introduced in current generation cars as an option, including:

* 1-Series F20/F21 - 03/2013 – 03/2015
* 2-Series F22 - 11/2013 – 03/2015
* 3-Series F30/F31 - 11/2012 – 07/2015
* 3-Series F34 - 03/2013 – 07/2015
* 3-Series F80 - 03/2014 – 07/2015
* 4-Series F32 - 07/2013 – 07/2015
* 4-Series F33 - 11/2013 – 07/2015
* 4-Series F36 - 03/2014 – 07/2015
* 5-Series F07 - 07/2012 – 2016
* 5-Series F10/F11/F18 - 09/2012 – 2016
* 6-Series F06/F12/F13 - 03/2013 – 2016
* 7-Series F01/F02/F03 - 07/2012 – 06/2015
* X3 F25 - 04/2013 – 08/2017
* X4 F26 - 04/2014 – 08/2017
* X5 F15 - 08/2014 – 07/2016
* X5 F85 - 12/2014 – 07/2016
* X6 F16 - 08/2014 – 07/2016
* X6 F86 - 12/2014 – 07/2016
* i3 - 09/2013 – 09/2017 
* i8 - 04/2014 – 09/2017

The update includes extensive hardware and software changes including cosmetic enhancements, faster processor, more memory, detailed 3D maps and improved routing. In addition, the capacity of the internal HDD has been increased from 10GB to 20GB. NBT also introduced a redesigned iDrive controller with optional handwriting recognition capabilities and gesture controls. This was achieved through a capacitive touch pad on top of the iDrive controller. NBT also removed the need for a separate COMBOX module for A2DP and USB media as those functions were integrated directly into the NBT Head Unit. BMW Online was also replaced with the newly introduced Connected Drive, which relied on a hardware TCB module with a built-in SIM card for mobile connectivity.

===iDrive Professional NBT EVO [iDrive 5.0/6.0]===
NBT EVO (Evolution) was released starting in 2016 and represented the first major change in the operational logic of iDrive since being introduced in 2001. The familiar vertical list of text menus was replaced by a horizontal set of dynamic tiles, each able to show real time information. This update saw major updates to the iDrive hardware, including the ability to interact with the system via touch screen for the first time. BMW&#x27;s Connected Drive services were further enhanced with this upgrade to the iDrive system, and the TCB module was replaced with a newer, faster ATM module. NBT EVO also introduced basic gesture controls as an optional extra on select BMW models.

Three Interface options exist for NBT EVO. ID4 looks like CIC NBT while ID5 and ID6 feature the new horizontal tile interface.

NBT EVO was available on the following BMW Models:

* 1-Series F20/F21 - 03/2015 – 2019
* 2-Series F22 - 03/2015 – 2021
* 2-Series F23 - 11/2014 – 2021
* 3-Series F30/F31/F34/F80 - 07/2015 – 2018
* 3-Series G20 - 2019 - 2022 (base system, when no Live Cockpit Plus or Professional is equipped) 
* 4-Series F32/F33/F36 - 07/2015 – 2019
* 5-Series G30 - 10/2016 – 2019
* 6-Series F06/F12/F13 - 03/2013 – 2018
* 6-Series G32 - 07/2017 – 2018
* 7-Series G12 - 07/2015 – 2019
* X1 F48 - 06/2015 – 06/2022
* X2 F39 - 11/2017 – 10/2022
* X3 F25 - 03/2016 – 2017
* X3 G01 - 11/2017 – present 
* X4 F26 - 03/2016 – 2018
* X5 F15/F85 - 07/2016 – 2018
* X6 F16/F86 - 07/2016 – 2019
* i3 (ID6.0) 09/2018–07/2022
* i8 (ID6.0) 09/2018- 2020

BMW is reportedly releasing iDrive 9 on a new infotainment head unit based on Android OS starting in March 2023.

== Rationale ==
The design rationale of iDrive is to replace an array of controls for the above systems with an all-in-one unit. The controls necessary for vehicle control and safety, such as the headlights and turn signals, are still located in the immediate vicinity of the steering column. Since, in the rationale of the designers, the air conditioning, car audio, navigation and communication controls are not used equally often, they have been moved into a central location.

The &quot;iDrive&quot; M-ASK and CCC systems were based around the points of a compass (north, south, east, west) with each direction corresponding with a specific area. These areas are also colour-coded providing identification as to which part of the system is currently being viewed.

* North (blue) for communication
* East (green) for navigation (In some models without navigation, this option is replaced by the On Board Computer)
* South (brown) for entertainment
* West (red) for climate control

Starting in 2007, iDrive added programmable buttons (6 USA/Japan, 8 in Europe) to the dashboard, breaking tradition of having the entire system operated via the control knob. Each button can be programmed to instantly access any feature within iDrive (such as a particular navigation route, or one&#x27;s favorite radio station). In addition, a dedicated AM/FM button, and a Mode button (to switch between entertainment sources) were added for North American-market vehicles.

Older versions of iDrive used a widescreen display that was split into a 2/3 main window, and 1/3 &quot;Assistance Window&quot;. This allowed the driver to use a function or menu, while simultaneously maintaining secondary information. For example, if the driver was not in the Navigation menu, they could still see a map on the assistance window. Other information that could be displayed included navigation route directions and a trip computer.

== Controversy ==
iDrive caused significant controversy among users, the automotive media, and critics when it was first introduced. Many reviewers of BMW vehicles in automobile magazines disapproved of the system. Criticisms of iDrive included its steep learning curve and its tendency to cause the driver to look away from the road too much. Most users report that they adapt to the system after about one year of practice, and the advent of voice controls has reduced the learning curve greatly.

A new iDrive system (CIC) was introduced in September 2008 to address most of the complaints. iDrive NBT, introduced in 2012, brought further improvements.

<doc id="1013540" wikidata="Q568631" url="?curid=1013540" title="Marc Davis (animator)">
<text>Marc Fraser Davis (March 30, 1913 – January 12, 2000) was a prominent American artist and animator for Walt Disney Animation Studios. He was one of Disney&#x27;s Nine Old Men, the famed core animators of Disney animated films, and was revered for his knowledge and understanding of visual aesthetics. After his work on &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; he moved to Walt Disney Imagineering to work on rides for Disneyland and Walt Disney World before retiring in 1978.

Walt Disney once said of Davis, &quot;Marc can do story, he can do character, he can animate, he can design shows for me. All I have to do is tell him what I want and it&#x27;s there! He&#x27;s my Renaissance man.&quot;

==Early life==
Davis was born in Bakersfield, California, on March 30, 1913. The family moved a lot, so Davis was in 26 schools before he was in high school. As a child, schoolyard bullies were an impetus for Davis to start drawing. He found when he drew that the other kids wanted his art, and the bullies wouldn&#x27;t beat him up.
Davis studied at the Kansas City Art Institute, the California School of Fine Arts in San Francisco, and the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles. As a student, he spent his days sketching zoo animals; in the evening, he studied animal anatomy at the public library.

==Disney animator==
Marc Davis began his Disney career in 1935 as an animator on &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; and was responsible for many Disney characters, becoming so well regarded for his work on female characters that he was called &quot;ladies&#x27; man&quot;.

===Introduction===
As one of Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Nine Old Men,&quot; Marc Davis&#x27;s importance to the Disney Studio is immediately evident. Davis was creative and skilled, able to set himself apart from the distinguished group of veteran animators. His mastery of drawing and painting led him to champion animation, followed by three-dimensional characters and storytelling. “I haven&#x27;t used Marc as I should,&quot; Disney once admitted to Alice Davis: &quot;I have a whole building over there filled with animators and that&#x27;s all they can do. Marc can do story, he can do character, he can animate, he can design shows for me. All I have to do is tell him what I want and it&#x27;s there. He&#x27;s my Renaissance Man.&quot; An even higher compliment from Disney circled back to Davis over the years. When asked what piece of the Studio&#x27;s animation he fancied most, Disney replied, &quot;I guess it would have to be where Cinderella gets her ballroom gown.&quot; It was Davis who animated Cinderella during her transformation, with George Rowley animating the pixie dust itself.

===Disney&#x27;s Ladies&#x27; Man===
Despite his skill with animal anatomy and caricature, Davis and Milt Kahl were stuck with over a decade of &quot;difficult-to-draw&quot; and &quot;dull&quot; human characters. In Davis&#x27;s own words, &quot;Milt got stuck with the prince a lot and I got stuck with the girls.&quot; Despite his distaste for this role, his commitment to artistic excellence never let him forget that he &quot;still had to put personality into the characters. You had to believe the characters were alive, give a performance like an actor, and make them come alive for the audience.&quot; Davis follows through on this commitment, as seen through his involved work with reference images, voice actors, and live actors. Davis became a master of observing and capturing life, &quot;evident in his acting, posing, and movement.&quot;

Voice actors for Maleficent, Briar Rose, and Cruella De Vil have all discussed the influence on Davis&#x27;s animation of their respective characters. Mary Costa, the voice of Briar Rose, recalled not even being invited to the premier of &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; because, at the time, the voice acting was hardly recognized. Even though Hollywood did not acknowledge voice acting&#x27;s importance, Davis did. In an interview Costa described working with Davis at Disney: &quot;Marc would sit in the sound booth and sketch my every gesture and expression.&quot; He recalled how despite hiring Helene Stanley as the live-action reference for Briar Rose, it was her &quot;mannerisms&quot; that made it to the big screen. When her mother saw the film, she exclaimed: &quot;Oh Mary, she looks just like you!&quot; Eleanor Audley, voice of Maleficent, remembered Davis telling her that &quot;the voice is the most necessary thing in the world.&quot; In the end, Davis admitted that Maleficent &quot;looked a lot like Eleanor.&quot; When it came to Cruella, one of the only characters to ever be completely controlled by a single animator, Davis claimed his greatest inspiration was the vocal performance of Betty Lou Gerson. Gerson commented in an interview how Davis incorporated her high cheekbones into Cruella&#x27;s face and how closely she had to work with him to perfect &quot;the laugh.&quot;
Live-action references also influenced Davis&#x27;s work, though his distinct style still shone through, unlike many animators who just regurgitated reality. Davis&#x27;s most famous scene from &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; is when Briar Rose spins around with her arms out in the forest. Though he followed the live-action reference footage, &quot;Davis exaggerated the foreshortening and sweeping arcs of the arms,&quot; making an artistic choice, rather than one from reality, that made the princess look &quot;more appealing.&quot; Fellow animator Frank Thomas criticized Davis for going &quot;overboard&quot; with Cruella De Vil, making the villain&#x27;s face more &quot;of a skull.&quot; However, Davis&#x27;s skill in capturing personality made it so &quot;her key poses and facial angles&quot; retained a &quot;certain glamor.&quot; Another example of this talent is how Davis perfectly captured and articulated Tinker Bell&#x27;s notorious sass and personality through pantomime and facial expression alone. Margaret Kerry, the live-action reference for the fairy, remembered asking Davis for guidance on who he wanted Tinker Bell to be and getting a response that she described as &quot;wonderful.&quot; Davis told her he wanted &quot;her to be you!&quot; Davis had vision for the characters he animated beyond just what they looked like, he knew how they would behave, sound, move, and what they would wear. A clear example of Davis&#x27;s forethought is with Briar Rose&#x27;s dress. Davis instructed his wife, Alice, on how he wanted the princess&#x27;s dress to flow so she could make the correct costume for when the live-action model arrived. 
Davis&#x27;s contribution to Disney animation is undeniable. When asked how he would like to be remembered, he responded, &quot;Well, I think as a really decent person and a pretty damn good artist.&quot;

Significant characters he designed and animated are :
* Snow White from &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937)
* Bambi, Thumper, And Flower, from &quot;Bambi&quot; (1942)

==Personal life==
As a professor at the Chouinard Art Institute, Davis first met Alice Estes as a student there in 1947. After her graduation, they married in June 1956, and remained so for 44 years until his death in 2000.

==Awards and honors==
In 1982, Davis was the recipient of the Winsor McCay Award.
In 1985, Davis was the recipient of the Golden Award for 50 years of service from the Motion Picture Screen Cartoonists.
In 1989, he was inducted as a Disney Legend. In 1993, Davis was the recipient of the DFC Disney Legend Award given by the Disneyana Fan Club. He was also the recipient of the much-coveted Mousecar (the Disney equivalent of an Oscar).
Davis, along with his wife Alice, received the honor of having their names on side-by-side windows on Main Street, U.S.A. at Disneyland. Marc&#x27;s reads: “Far East Imports – Exotic Art – Marc Davis – Proprietor”.

==Legacy==
Starting in 1994, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has annually presented &quot;the Marc Davis Lecture on Animation&quot; series featuring noted creators and luminaries in the industry.

Davis died on January 12, 2000. That month, the Marc Fraser Davis Scholarship Fund was formally established at the California Institute of the Arts.

In 2014, the Walt Disney Family Museum presented the exhibition &quot;Leading Ladies and Femmes Fatales: The Art of Marc Davis&quot;.

In October 2014, &quot;Marc Davis: Walt Disney&#x27;s Renaissance Man&quot; , a hardcover book on Davis&#x27; art and career, was published by Disney Editions. It was followed by the September 2020 release of &quot;Marc Davis in His Own Words: Imagineering the Disney Parks&quot; , a two-volume hardcover set covering his work at WED.

<doc id="1013550" wikidata="Q2122176" url="?curid=1013550" title="Quantum channel">
<text>In quantum information theory, a quantum channel is a communication channel that can transmit quantum information, as well as classical information. An example of quantum information is the general dynamics of a qubit. An example of classical information is a text document transmitted over the Internet.

Terminologically, quantum channels are completely positive (CP) trace-preserving maps between spaces of operators. In other words, a quantum channel is just a quantum operation viewed not merely as the reduced dynamics of a system but as a pipeline intended to carry quantum information. (Some authors use the term &quot;quantum operation&quot; to include trace-decreasing maps while reserving &quot;quantum channel&quot; for strictly trace-preserving maps.)

== Memoryless quantum channel ==

We will assume for the moment that all state spaces of the systems considered, classical or quantum, are finite-dimensional.

The memoryless in the section title carries the same meaning as in classical information theory: the output of a channel at a given time depends only upon the corresponding input and not any previous ones.

=== Schrödinger picture ===

Consider quantum channels that transmit only quantum information. This is precisely a quantum operation, whose properties we now summarize.

Let formula_1 and formula_2 be the state spaces (finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces) of the sending and receiving ends, respectively, of a channel. formula_3 will denote the family of operators on formula_4 In the Schrödinger picture, a purely quantum channel is a map formula_5 between density matrices acting on formula_1 and formula_2 with the following properties:

#As required by postulates of quantum mechanics, formula_5 needs to be linear.
#Since density matrices are positive, formula_5 must preserve the cone of positive elements. In other words, formula_5 is a positive map.
#If an ancilla of arbitrary finite dimension &quot;n&quot; is coupled to the system, then the induced map formula_11 where &quot;I&quot;&quot;n&quot; is the identity map on the ancilla, must also be positive. Therefore, it is required that formula_12 is positive for all &quot;n&quot;. Such maps are called completely positive.
#Density matrices are specified to have trace 1, so formula_5 has to preserve the trace.

The adjectives completely positive and trace preserving used to describe a map are sometimes abbreviated CPTP. In the literature, sometimes the fourth property is weakened so that formula_5 is only required to be not trace-increasing. In this article, it will be assumed that all channels are CPTP.

=== Heisenberg picture ===

Density matrices acting on &quot;HA&quot; only constitute a proper subset of the operators on &quot;HA&quot; and same can be said for system &quot;B&quot;. However, once a linear map formula_5 between the density matrices is specified, a standard linearity argument, together with the finite-dimensional assumption, allow us to extend formula_5 uniquely to the full space of operators. This leads to the adjoint map formula_17, which describes the action of formula_5 in the Heisenberg picture:

The spaces of operators &quot;L&quot;(&quot;H&quot;&quot;A&quot;) and &quot;L&quot;(&quot;H&quot;&quot;B&quot;) are Hilbert spaces with the Hilbert–Schmidt inner product. Therefore, viewing formula_19 as a map between Hilbert spaces, we obtain its adjoint formula_5* given by

:formula_21

While formula_5 takes states on &quot;A&quot; to those on &quot;B&quot;, formula_17 maps observables on system &quot;B&quot; to observables on &quot;A&quot;. This relationship is same as that between the Schrödinger and Heisenberg descriptions of dynamics. The measurement statistics remain unchanged whether the observables are considered fixed while the states undergo operation or vice versa.

It can be directly checked that if formula_5 is assumed to be trace preserving, formula_17 is unital, that is,formula_26. Physically speaking, this means that, in the Heisenberg picture, the trivial observable remains trivial after applying the channel.

=== Classical information ===

So far we have only defined a quantum channel that transmits only quantum information. As stated in the introduction, the input and output of a channel can include classical information as well. To describe this, the formulation given so far needs to be generalized somewhat. A purely quantum channel, in the Heisenberg picture, is a linear map Ψ between spaces of operators:

:formula_27

that is unital and completely positive (CP). The operator spaces can be viewed as finite-dimensional C*-algebras. Therefore, we can say a channel is a unital CP map between C*-algebras:

:formula_28

Classical information can then be included in this formulation. The observables of a classical system can be assumed to be a commutative C*-algebra, i.e. the space of continuous functions formula_29 on some set formula_30. We assume formula_30 is finite so formula_29 can be identified with the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space formula_33 with entry-wise multiplication.

Therefore, in the Heisenberg picture, if the classical information is part of, say, the input, we would define formula_34 to include the relevant classical observables. An example of this would be a channel

:formula_35

Notice formula_36 is still a C*-algebra. An element formula_37 of a C*-algebra formula_38 is called positive if formula_39 for some formula_40. Positivity of a map is defined accordingly. This characterization is not universally accepted; the quantum instrument is sometimes given as the generalized mathematical framework for conveying both quantum and classical information. In axiomatizations of quantum mechanics, the classical information is carried in a Frobenius algebra or Frobenius category.

== Examples ==

=== Time evolution ===

For a purely quantum system, the time evolution, at certain time &quot;t&quot;, is given by

:formula_41

where formula_42 and &quot;H&quot; is the Hamiltonian and &quot;t&quot; is the time. This gives a CPTP map in the Schrödinger picture and is therefore a channel. The dual map in the Heisenberg picture is

:formula_43

=== Restriction ===

Consider a composite quantum system with state space formula_44 For a state

:formula_45

the reduced state of &quot;ρ&quot; on system &quot;A&quot;, &quot;ρ&quot;&quot;A&quot;, is obtained by taking the partial trace of &quot;ρ&quot; with respect to the &quot;B&quot; system:

:formula_46

The partial trace operation is a CPTP map, therefore a quantum channel in the Schrödinger picture. In the Heisenberg picture, the dual map of this channel is

:formula_47

where &quot;A&quot; is an observable of system &quot;A&quot;.

=== Observable ===

An observable associates a numerical value formula_48 to a quantum mechanical &quot;effect&quot; formula_49. formula_49&#x27;s are assumed to be positive operators acting on appropriate state space and formula_51. (Such a collection is called a POVM.) In the Heisenberg picture, the corresponding &quot;observable map&quot; formula_52 maps a classical observable

:formula_53

to the quantum mechanical one

:formula_54

In other words, one integrates &quot;f&quot; against the POVM to obtain the quantum mechanical observable. It can be easily checked that formula_52 is CP and unital.

The corresponding Schrödinger map formula_56 takes density matrices to classical states:

:formula_57

where the inner product is the Hilbert–Schmidt inner product. Furthermore, viewing states as normalized functionals, and invoking the Riesz representation theorem, we can put

:formula_58

=== Instrument ===

The observable map, in the Schrödinger picture, has a purely classical output algebra and therefore only describes measurement statistics. To take the state change into account as well, we define what is called a quantum instrument. Let formula_59 be the effects (POVM) associated to an observable. In the Schrödinger picture, an instrument is a map formula_60 with pure quantum input formula_61 and with output space formula_62:

:formula_63

Let

:formula_64

The dual map in the Heisenberg picture is

:formula_65

where formula_66 is defined in the following way: Factor formula_67 (this can always be done since elements of a POVM are positive) then formula_68.
We see that formula_52 is CP and unital.

Notice that formula_70 gives precisely the observable map. The map

:formula_71

describes the overall state change.

=== Measure-and-prepare channel ===

Suppose two parties &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; wish to communicate in the following manner: &quot;A&quot; performs the measurement of an observable and communicates the measurement outcome to &quot;B&quot; classically. According to the message he receives, &quot;B&quot; prepares his (quantum) system in a specific state. In the Schrödinger picture, the first part of the channel formula_51 simply consists of &quot;A&quot; making a measurement, i.e. it is the observable map:

:formula_73

If, in the event of the &quot;i&quot;-th measurement outcome, &quot;B&quot; prepares his system in state &quot;Ri&quot;, the second part of the channel formula_52 takes the above classical state to the density matrix

:formula_75

The total operation is the composition

:formula_76

Channels of this form are called &quot;measure-and-prepare&quot; or &quot;entanglement-breaking.&quot;

In the Heisenberg picture, the dual map formula_77 is defined by

:formula_78

A measure-and-prepare channel can not be the identity map. This is precisely the statement of the no teleportation theorem, which says classical teleportation (not to be confused with entanglement-assisted teleportation) is impossible. In other words, a quantum state can not be measured reliably.

In the channel-state duality, a channel is measure-and-prepare if and only if the corresponding state is separable. Actually, all the states that result from the partial action of a measure-and-prepare channel are separable, which is why measure-and-prepare channels are also known as entanglement-breaking channels.

=== Pure channel ===

Consider the case of a purely quantum channel formula_52 in the Heisenberg picture. With the assumption that everything is finite-dimensional, formula_52 is a unital CP map between spaces of matrices

:formula_81

By Choi&#x27;s theorem on completely positive maps, formula_52 must take the form

:formula_83

where &quot;N&quot; ≤ &quot;nm&quot;. The matrices &quot;K&quot;&quot;i&quot; are called Kraus operators of formula_52 (after the German physicist Karl Kraus, who introduced them). The minimum number of Kraus operators is called the Kraus rank of formula_52. A channel with Kraus rank 1 is called pure. The time evolution is one example of a pure channel. This terminology again comes from the channel-state duality. A channel is pure if and only if its dual state is a pure state.

=== Teleportation ===

In quantum teleportation, a sender wishes to transmit an arbitrary quantum state of a particle to a possibly distant receiver. Consequently, the teleportation process is a quantum channel. The apparatus for the process itself requires a quantum channel for the transmission of one particle of an entangled-state to the receiver. Teleportation occurs by a joint measurement of the sent particle and the remaining entangled particle. This measurement results in classical information that must be sent to the receiver to complete the teleportation. Importantly, the classical information can be sent after the quantum channel has ceased to exist.

== In the experimental setting ==

Experimentally, a simple implementation of a quantum channel is fiber optic (or free-space for that matter) transmission of single photons. Single photons can be transmitted up to 100 km in standard fiber optics before losses dominate. The photon&#x27;s time-of-arrival (&quot;time-bin entanglement&quot;) or polarization are used as a basis to encode quantum information for purposes such as quantum cryptography. The channel is capable of transmitting not only basis states (e.g. formula_86, formula_87) but also superpositions of them (e.g. formula_88). The coherence of the state is maintained during transmission through the channel. Contrast this with the transmission of electrical pulses through wires (a classical channel), where only classical information (e.g. 0s and 1s) can be sent.

== Channel capacity ==

=== The cb-norm of a channel ===

Before giving the definition of channel capacity, the preliminary notion of the norm of complete boundedness, or cb-norm of a channel needs to be discussed. When considering the capacity of a channel formula_60, we need to compare it with an &quot;ideal channel&quot; formula_90 . For instance, when the input and output algebras are identical, we can choose formula_90 to be the identity map. Such a comparison requires a metric between channels.
Since a channel can be viewed as a linear operator, it is tempting to use the natural operator norm. In other words, the closeness of formula_60 to the ideal channel formula_90 can be defined by

:formula_94

However, the operator norm may increase when we tensor formula_60 with the identity map on some ancilla.

To make the operator norm even a more undesirable candidate, the quantity

:formula_96

may increase without bound as formula_97 The solution is to introduce, for any linear map formula_60 between C*-algebras, the cb-norm

:formula_99

=== Definition of channel capacity ===

The mathematical model of a channel used here is same as the classical one.

Let formula_100 be a channel in the Heisenberg picture and formula_101 be a chosen ideal channel. To make the comparison possible, one needs to encode and decode Φ via appropriate devices, i.e. we consider the composition

:formula_102

where &quot;E&quot; is an encoder and &quot;D&quot; is a decoder. In this context, &quot;E&quot; and &quot;D&quot; are unital CP maps with appropriate domains. The quantity of interest is the &quot;best case scenario&quot;:

:formula_103

with the infimum being taken over all possible encoders and decoders.

To transmit words of length &quot;n&quot;, the ideal channel is to be applied &quot;n&quot; times, so we consider the tensor power

:formula_104

The formula_105 operation describes &quot;n&quot; inputs undergoing the operation formula_106 independently and is the quantum mechanical counterpart of concatenation. Similarly, &quot;m invocations of the channel&quot; corresponds to formula_107.

The quantity

:formula_108

is therefore a measure of the ability of the channel to transmit words of length &quot;n&quot; faithfully by being invoked &quot;m&quot; times.

This leads to the following definition:

:A non-negative real number &quot;r&quot; is an achievable rate of formula_52 with respect to formula_106 if

:For all sequences formula_111 where formula_112 and formula_113, we have

:formula_114

A sequence formula_115 can be viewed as representing a message consisting of possibly infinite number of words. The limit supremum condition in the definition says that, in the limit, faithful transmission can be achieved by invoking the channel no more than &quot;r&quot; times the length of a word. One can also say that &quot;r&quot; is the number of letters per invocation of the channel that can be sent without error.

The channel capacity of formula_52 with respect to formula_106, denoted by formula_118 is the supremum of all achievable rates.

From the definition, it is vacuously true that 0 is an achievable rate for any channel.

=== Important examples ===

As stated before, for a system with observable algebra formula_34, the ideal channel formula_106 is by definition the identity map formula_121. Thus for a purely &quot;n&quot; dimensional quantum system, the ideal channel is the identity map on the space of &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrices formula_122. As a slight abuse of notation, this ideal quantum channel will be also denoted by formula_122. Similarly, a classical system with output algebra formula_124 will have an ideal channel denoted by the same symbol. We can now state some fundamental channel capacities.

The channel capacity of the classical ideal channel formula_124 with respect to a quantum ideal channel formula_122 is

:formula_127

This is equivalent to the no-teleportation theorem: it is impossible to transmit quantum information via a classical channel.

Moreover, the following equalities hold:

:formula_128

The above says, for instance, an ideal quantum channel is no more efficient at transmitting classical information than an ideal classical channel. When &quot;n&quot; = &quot;m&quot;, the best one can achieve is &quot;one bit per qubit&quot;.

It is relevant to note here that both of the above bounds on capacities can be broken, with the aid of entanglement. The entanglement-assisted teleportation scheme allows one to transmit quantum information using a classical channel. Superdense coding achieves two bits per qubit. These results indicate the significant role played by entanglement in quantum communication.

=== Classical and quantum channel capacities ===

Using the same notation as the previous subsection, the classical capacity of a channel Ψ is

:formula_129

that is, it is the capacity of Ψ with respect to the ideal channel on the classical one-bit system formula_130.

Similarly the quantum capacity of Ψ is

:formula_131

where the reference system is now the one qubit system formula_132.

== Channel fidelity ==
Another measure of how well a quantum channel preserves information is called channel fidelity, and it arises from fidelity of quantum states. Given two pure states formula_133 and formula_134, their fidelity is the probability that one of them passes a test designed to identify the other: formula_135 This can be generalized to the case where the two states being compared are given by density matrices: formula_136

The channel fidelity for a given channel is found by sending one half of a maximally entangled pair of systems through that channel, and calculating the fidelity between the resulting state and the original input.

== Bistochastic quantum channel ==
A bistochastic quantum channel is a quantum channel formula_137 that is unital, i.e. formula_138. These channels include unitary evolutions, convex combinations of unitaries, and (in dimensions larger than 2) other possibilities as well.

<text>Jean Richafort ( – ) was a Netherlandish composer of the Renaissance, a member of the third generation of the Franco-Flemish School.

He was probably born in Hainaut, and his native language appears to have been French. According to the poet Ronsard, Richafort studied with Josquin des Prez, an association further borne out by the fact that he composed a requiem &quot;in memoriam Josquin Desprez&quot;. Richafort served as choir master at St. Rumbold&#x27;s Cathedral in Mechelen between 1507 and 1509, and at St. Giles&#x27; church in Bruges between 1542 and 1547—leaving a huge gap in the record of his activity. At some time between these dates he was associated with the French royal chapel, since some of his music is for official occasions connected with Louis XII, and there is some evidence he may have been in Brussels in 1531 in the service of Queen Mary of Hungary, who was regent there.

Musically, Richafort was a representative of the first generation after Josquin, and he followed his style in many ways. In some of his music he used fragments of Josquin&#x27;s compositions as a tribute. Richafort&#x27;s compositional techniques are typical of the period (smooth polyphony, pervasive imitation, etc.) but he was unusually attentive to the clear setting of text so the words could be understood.

He wrote a requiem for six voices (&quot;Requiem in memoriam Josquin des Prez&quot;, 1532), masses, motets, settings of the Magnificat, two secular motets, and chansons.

<text>The Rebellion of 1088 occurred after the death of William the Conqueror and concerned the division of lands in the Kingdom of England and the Duchy of Normandy between his two sons William Rufus and Robert Curthose. Hostilities lasted from three to six months starting around Easter of 1088.

== Background ==
William on his deathbed in 1087 decided how his sons would inherit the lands of his native Normandy and recently conquered England. His eldest son Robert was made Duke of Normandy and his third eldest son (second eldest surviving son) William Rufus was made King of England. This came to pass on William&#x27;s death.

The division of William the Conqueror&#x27;s lands into two parts presented a dilemma for those nobles who held land on both sides of the English Channel. Since the younger William and his brother Robert were natural rivals, these nobles worried that they could not hope to please both of their lords, and thus ran the risk of losing the favour of one ruler or the other, or both. The only solution, as they saw it, was to unite England and Normandy once more under one ruler. The pursuit of this aim led them to revolt against William in favour of Robert, under the leadership of the powerful Bishop Odo of Bayeux, who was a half-brother of William the Conqueror.

The rebels, led by William the Conqueror&#x27;s half-brothers Odo of Bayeux and Robert, Count of Mortain, with Odo the stronger of the two and the leader, decided to band together to dispose of young King William II and reunite Normandy and England under a single ruler, Robert.

Among King William&#x27;s initial supporters were all the bishops of England, a few major magnates including Alan Rufus (in the east of England north of London up to Yorkshire), William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey (from Sussex to Yorkshire) and Hugh of Avranches (in the west, around Cheshire, and in Lincolnshire), and lesser tenants-in-chief such as Robert Fitzhamon and Walter D&#x27;Aincourt. However, the rebels&#x27; ranks were made up many of the most powerful barons in England: of the ten largest baronial landholders in the Domesday Book, six were counted amongst the rebels. They were spread far and wide geographically from Kent, controlled by Bishop Odo, to Northumberland, controlled by Robert de Mowbray, to Gloucestershire and Somerset under Geoffrey de Montbray (Bishop of Coutances), to Norfolk with Roger Bigod, through Shropshire and Sussex and other counties with Roger of Montgomery, and a vast swathe of territory in the south-west, centre and south of England under Count Robert. In support of the rebels were Eustace III, Count of Boulogne and &quot;Hugh de Grantmesnil, who had the government of Leicestershire, with Robert de Rhuddlan his nephew, and other knights of distinguished bravery&quot;.

== Rebellion ==

With the coming of summer in 1088, the barons set out on a campaign to lay waste the lands of William II and his supporters. They fortified their own castles and stocked them with provisions, and waited for a response from the king. If for some reason no response came, they knew they could easily live by plundering neighbouring territories, and thus reduce the kingdom to feudal anarchy, a situation the king would eventually have to address.

The king&#x27;s response was threefold. First, he divided his enemies by promising those who sided with him that they would receive as much money and land as they wanted. Second, he appealed to the English people as a whole, promising them &quot;the best law that had ever been in this land&quot;. This had a positive effect in allowing regional garrisons the support they needed to fight the rebels. Finally, he attacked the rebels personally. In a six-week siege of Pevensey Castle in Sussex he captured the rebel leader Odo.

In a stroke of luck for the king, the troops Robert was sending from Normandy were driven back by bad weather on the seas. Meanwhile, the king, together with some of his allies took Rochester Castle in Kent, and with Robert&#x27;s failure to arrive, the rebels were forced to surrender and the rebellion was over.

Those of William&#x27;s barons who had remained loyal urged leniency for the rebel barons, Orderic Vitalis says, addressing the king:

:If you temper your animosity against these great men, and treat them graciously here, or permit them to depart in safety, you may advantageously use their amity and service, on many future occasions. He who is your enemy now, may be your useful friend another time.

Odo, previously the richest man in England, was stripped of his belongings and banished to Normandy for life, while his nephew Robert Curthose was allowed to stay in England and keep his estates in Normandy, on the proviso that he recognise William II as king and set aside his claim to the throne. Roger of Montgomery had left the rebels and joined with the king after promises of land and money. The king pragmatically kept those aristocrats whom he needed and removed those who were a threat.

William de St-Calais, Bishop of Durham, who had abandoned the king&#x27;s army during the campaign, was tried later in the year, deposed, and exiled to Normandy, but in 1091 returned and was reinstated.

<doc id="1013587" wikidata="Q1284314" url="?curid=1013587" title="Mini-Me">
<text>Mini-Me is a fictional character from the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; film franchise, portrayed by Verne Troyer. He debuts in the second film in the trilogy, &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,&quot; and appears again in the third film, &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot;.

==History==
Before Dr. Evil was sent back in time to 1969, his minions made him a clone. The clone was similar in every manner although he was one-eighth his size (although Mini-Me is approximately one-third Dr. Evil’s size). Upon being introduced to his clone, Dr. Evil immediately declared, &quot;Breathtaking. I shall call him... Mini-Me.&quot;

Mini-Me has almost no spoken dialogue in the films beyond an occasional frightened &quot;Eeeee!&quot;. Otherwise, he is silent except for when he does his evil laugh with Dr. Evil. He also likes to lip sync the occasional line when Dr. Evil raps. At the beginning of &quot;Goldmember&quot;, Dr. Evil asks him to &quot;Use your words like a big boy clone!&quot;. At one point, he asks Dr. Evil to hug him after meeting Fat Bastard, who wants to eat him. Mini-Me often uses the middle finger as a means of insulting someone (even though he only uses it once during the third movie). On most other occasions, Mini-Me prefers to express himself through written notes.

Mini-Me has a pet called Mini-Mr. Bigglesworth, which has only appeared once in the series, in which Mini-Me tried to gnaw on his ear. Mini Mr. Bigglesworth is a kitten version of Dr. Evil&#x27;s cat. Mini-Me loves chocolate and disrespecting Scott Evil, Dr. Evil&#x27;s son and his rival for affection. He is sometimes referred to and treated as a dog or other small objects. Scott refers to him as &quot;That vicious little... Chihuahua thing&quot;, and Dr. Evil illustrates him like a small carry-on luggage, as &quot;he fits easily into most overhead storage bins&quot;. Austin says upon Mini-Me being knocked out, &quot;Poor little bugger... he&#x27;s like a dog or something.&quot; In the third movie&#x27;s opening scenes, Dr. Evil uses a leash to restrain Mini-Me from attacking Scott, saying, &quot;Heel, Mini-Me! Heel!&quot; He also tends to dry hump random things. Nigel Powers, upon seeing him, says &quot;Blimey, I thought I smelled cabbage,&quot; thinking he is a carny (referring back to a quip from the first &quot;Austin Powers&quot; movie). Mini-Me is appropriately confused by the remark.

Despite his small size, Mini-Me is a powerful and effective fighter, once giving Austin Powers a considerable thrashing, until the spy took advantage of his small size and flushed him out into space through a toilet. Despite being a clone of Dr. Evil, Mini-Me is shown to be far stronger and tougher than his larger counterpart, as seen in &quot;Goldmember&quot; when they&#x27;re lifting weights in prison. He was also given a significant beating in &quot;Goldmember&quot;, in which he was tied in a pillowcase by Powers and slammed through shelves and glass tables, only to stand up without a scratch.

A memorable gag had him passing a series of notes to Foxxy Cleopatra, first stating she was so beautiful, she must be the clone of an angel. When she smilingly disagreed, the second note asked if she was sure she didn&#x27;t have a little clone in her. The third asked if she&#x27;d like to. As seen by Nigel Powers&#x27; reaction to Mini-Me&#x27;s genitals (&quot;My Word! You&#x27;re a tripod!&quot; and &quot;If you ever get tired, you can use it as a kickstand&quot;), he seems to have a large penis. He uses this as an advantage at the end of &quot;Goldmember&quot; when he gets Britney Spears&#x27; cell phone number.

In &quot;Austinpussy&quot;, the film within a film in &quot;Goldmember&quot;, the role is played in cameo by Danny DeVito.

Mini-Me has a brief cameo in the music video for Madonna&#x27;s song, &quot;Beautiful Stranger&quot;.

In &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot;, where Looney Tunes characters have scattered to different digital worlds based on Warner Bros. films, Elmer Fudd takes on the role of Mini-Me in the Austin Powers world, while Sylvester the Cat has become Mr. Bigglesworth.

Mike Myers has acknowledged that the character was directly inspired by the character of Majai in the 1996 film &quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot;, who is similarly a miniature version of Marlon Brando&#x27;s titular villain character.

== In popular culture ==
In 2021, the Hungarian government party Fidesz released an ad based on Mini-Me&#x27;s introduction scene. The ad&#x27;s aim was to emphasize the alleged similarities between opposition candidate Péter Márki-Zay (Mini-Me) and former prime minister Ferenc Gyurcsány (Dr. Evil).

<text>The Newmark-beta method is a method of numerical integration used to solve certain differential equations. It is widely used in numerical evaluation of the dynamic response of structures and solids such as in finite element analysis to model dynamic systems. The method is named after Nathan M. Newmark, former Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, who developed it in 1959 for use in structural dynamics. The semi-discretized structural equation is a second order ordinary differential equation system,

formula_1

here formula_2 is the mass matrix, formula_3 is the damping matrix, formula_4 and formula_5 are internal force per unit displacement and external forces, respectively.

Using the extended mean value theorem, the Newmark-formula_6 method states that the first time derivative (velocity in the equation of motion) can be solved as,

:formula_7

where

:formula_8

therefore

:formula_9

Because acceleration also varies with time, however, the extended mean value theorem must also be extended to the second time derivative to obtain the correct displacement. Thus,

:formula_10

where again

:formula_11

The discretized structural equation becomes

formula_12

Explicit central difference scheme is obtained by setting formula_13 and formula_14

Average constant acceleration (Middle point rule) is obtained by setting formula_13 and formula_16

== Stability Analysis ==
A time-integration scheme is said to be stable if there exists an integration time-step formula_17 so that for any formula_18, a finite variation of the state vector formula_19 at time formula_20 induces only a non-increasing variation of the state-vector formula_21 calculated at a subsequent time formula_22. Assume the time-integration scheme is 

formula_23

The linear stability is equivalent to formula_24, here formula_25 is the spectral radius of the update matrix formula_26.

For the linear structural equation 

formula_27

here formula_28 is the stiffness matrix. Let formula_29, the update matrix is formula_30, and 

formula_31

For undamped case (formula_32), the update matrix can be decoupled by introducing the eigenmodes formula_33 of the structural system, which are solved by the generalized eigenvalue problem

formula_34

For each eigenmode, the update matrix becomes

formula_35

The characteristic equation of the update matrix is 

formula_36

As for the stability, we have 

Explicit central difference scheme (formula_13 and formula_14) is stable when formula_39.

Average constant acceleration (Middle point rule) (formula_13 and formula_16) is unconditionally stable.

<text>George Clarke (7 May 1661 – 22 October 1736), of All Souls, Oxford, was an English architect, print collector and Tory politician who sat in the English and British House of Commons between 1702 and 1736.

==Life==
The son of Sir William Clarke, he enrolled at Brasenose College, Oxford in 1676. He was elected a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford in 1680. He was returned in a contested by-election on 23 November 1685 as Member of Parliament for Oxford University, but never took his seat as Parliament had been prorogued. He became Judge Advocate to the Army and was Secretary at War in Ireland from 1690 to 1692 and in England from 1693 to 1704 under William III of England and Queen Anne. He served as secretary to Prince George of Denmark, Queen Anne&#x27;s consort and the Lord High Admiral and Generalissimo of England.

Clarke was returned as Member of Parliament for Winchelsea at the 1702 English general election, coinciding with his office as Joint Secretary of the Admiralty. At the 1705 English general election he was returned as MP for East Looe. He was not nominated for a seat at the 1708 British general election. He was returned in a by-election on 29 May 1711 as MP for Launceston from 1711. He did not stand at the 1713 British general election. Over the latter period he was Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty from 20 December 1710 until 14 October 1714, when he was dismissed following the accession of George I.

Clarke returned to the House of Commons as MP for Oxford University at a by-election on 4 December 1717 following the death of William Whitelock. He was reelected in 1722, 1727, and 1734, by which point he had lost his left eye and was losing sight in the other.
He was also an amateur architect. His known work is largely confined to Oxford, (Clayton&#x27;s DNB entry for Clarke offers more detail of his architectural endeavours) and he is known to have designed buildings and also to have collaborated with Nicholas Hawksmoor, amongst others.

Timothy Clayton discusses Clarke&#x27;s print collection, noting &quot;John Vanburgh, Alexander Pope and George Vertue travelled to Oxford to use his library with its unique collection of notes and drawings by [Inigo] Jones&quot; (Clayton 1992, p. 124).

The library of Worcester College, Oxford houses Clarke&#x27;s collection of books, MSS, prints and drawings. Building work on the library, which was started within a few years of the college&#x27;s founding in 1714, was completed in 1736. A spat between Clarke and All Souls resulted in the bequest to Worcester.

<text>A cactolith is a type of igneous intrusion, a &quot;quasi-horizontal chonolith composed of anastomosing ductoliths, whose distal ends curl like a harpolith, thin out like a sphenolith, or bulge discordantly like an akmolith or ethmolith&quot;; i.e. a laccolith which looks like a cactus.

The term was coined by Charles B. Hunt, a USGS researcher, in his paper &quot;Geology and geography of the Henry Mountains region, Utah&quot; (1953). He was in fact describing an actual geological feature that resembled a cactus, but said later that the deliberately-absurd term was &quot;intended to call attention satirically to the absurd nomenclature geologists were developing by applying new names to the infinite variety of shapes intrusions can form&quot;.

<text>The Oxford Advanced Learner&#x27;s Dictionary (OALD) was the first advanced learner&#x27;s dictionary of English. It was first published in 1948. It is the largest English-language dictionary from Oxford University Press aimed at a non-native audience.

Users with a more linguistic interest, requiring etymologies or copious references, usually prefer the &quot;Concise Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, or indeed the comprehensive &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, or other dictionaries aimed at speakers of English with native-level competence.

==History==
The &quot;Oxford Advanced Learner&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, previously entitled the &quot;Oxford Advanced Learner&#x27;s Dictionary of Current English&quot;, started life as the &quot;Idiomatic and Syntactic Dictionary&quot;, edited by Albert Sydney Hornby. It was first published in Japan in 1942. It then made a perilous wartime journey to Britain where it came under the wing of OUP, which decided it would be the perfect counterpart for the prestigious OED.

A. S. Hornby was a teacher of English studies at a small college in Japan; he had gone there in 1923 to teach literature, but his experiences in the classroom drew his attention to the need for sound principles of language teaching. At that time Harold E. Palmer headed the Institute for Research into English Teaching in Tokyo, and in 1931 he invited Hornby to work on vocabulary development at the Institute. The result of this was the &quot;Idiomatic and Syntactic Dictionary&quot;, published by Kaitakusha in 1942. A year before publication, Hornby had managed to send an advance copy in sheets of the book to B. Ifor Evans at the British Council, a tough feat during the war. Ifor Evans offered him a job, and in 1942 Hornby came back to Britain and joined the Council, which posted him to Iran.

The sheets reached Humphrey S. Milford, then publisher to the University of Oxford and effectively OUP&#x27;s managing director. Milford saw immediately that the dictionary could fill a troublesome gap in the Press&#x27;s lists, since it was compiled for non-English speakers and rested on Hornby&#x27;s solid experience in teaching the language overseas. Thus it explained spelling, grammar, phonetics, and usage much more extensively than would a dictionary for native English speakers. With the cachet of the Press to promote it, it could take the &quot;Oxford dictionary&quot; brand to readerships that might be intimidated or puzzled by the more magisterial OED.

But the command economy of World War II under which all British publishers were then operating posed a problem: everything was in short supply, and Milford appealed to the British Council for help in getting the paper and cloth. He referred the matter to E.C. Parnwell, who was looking after the Press&#x27;s overseas projects, Milford being by then too unwell to manage the Press without substantial assistance, as he had been doing since 1904.

Hornby had brought with him the world rights to the book excluding Japan and China; Kenneth Sisam, then Secretary to the Delegates of the Press, gave a favourable report to the Delegates on the book. Milford also used hostility to Japan to push for a subsidy from the British Council, saying that &quot;the Japanese are very cheap producers&quot; and were likely to capture the market.

The book had more than 1,500 pages and for an edition of 10,000 copies would need ten tons of paper. Milford applied for a special release to acquire this paper &quot;in the direct interest of British culture and overseas trade, particularly in the non-sterling areas&quot;. He had adequate paper stock to begin the edition but this was all earmarked for &quot;essential reprints&quot; and he could only use it if replacements were guaranteed. Milford&#x27;s niece, Eleanor M. Booker, was now working at the India Office, and he lobbied for paper through her.

Finally the book came out between 1943 and 1948 and became an instant success. Today it is one of the most used resources by learners of the English language worldwide.

The book is useful for all competitive exams.

<text>Daniel Lloyd Davey (born 25 July 1973), known professionally as Dani Filth, is an English singer who is the lead vocalist, lyricist and founding member of the extreme metal band Cradle of Filth.

== Personal life ==
Daniel Lloyd Davey was born to Susan Janet Moore and Laurence John Davey in Hertford and is the eldest child of four.

He married Toni King on 31 October 2005 in Ipswich. The couple have a daughter. Separated since 2018, he is currently in a relationship with Russian-born, Ipswich-based tattoo artist Sofiya Belousova.

== Career ==
Dani Filth&#x27;s present and primary band is Cradle of Filth. He also has been lending his voice to the band Devilment, a side project that has taken off into a full-time job in between Cradle records. His earliest bands were Carnival Fruitcake, The Lemon Grove Kids, PDA, Feast on Excrement, the Bondage Boys, and Hash Gordon and the Drug Barons. He named Judas Priest, Venom, Emperor, Destruction, Slayer, Iron Maiden, Sabbat, Misfits, Paradise Lost and Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; among his major influences.

At the age of eighteen, Filth took up a job at a Chinese restaurant. He later chose his career in music over an internship at a newspaper, although his &quot;Dani&#x27;s Inferno&quot; column ran for two years in &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; during the late 1990s.

He has co-written and released &quot;The Gospel of Filth&quot; with Gavin Baddeley. The book, which Filth describes as an &quot;occult study,&quot; features contributions from Clive Barker, Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pierson. He had been accused many times of being a Satanist, but has denounced such rumours, claiming instead to being &quot;more of a Luciferian.&quot;

Away from Cradle, Filth appeared on the &quot;Roadrunner United&quot; CD in 2005 (contributing vocals to &quot;Dawn of a Golden Age&quot;), and recorded the song &quot;(She&#x27;s) The Mother of Tears&quot; with Claudio Simonetti and Simonetti&#x27;s band Daemonia, for the soundtrack of Dario Argento&#x27;s film &quot;The Mother of Tears&quot;.

Filth participated in the Temple of the Black Moon project in 2012 with guitarist Rob Caggiano, black metal musician King ov Hell on bass, and drummer John Tempesta. The supergroup aimed to combine rawer, extreme metal with the softer more melodious sounds of progressive rock, describing the band&#x27;s sound as a &quot;cross between Celtic Frost and Tool&quot;. Filth has also released two albums with Devilment since 2014.

His high profile has led to a handful of film and television roles. In 2000, Filth appeared in the movie &quot;Cradle of Fear&quot; as The Man, a deranged psychopath taking revenge on his father&#x27;s persecutors. &quot;Cradle of Fear&quot; unfolds four stories all linked by the thread of an incarcerated child killer wreaking vengeance on those responsible for his imprisonment. The movie&#x27;s tagline on some posters was, &quot;It&#x27;s not &quot;if&quot; they die... It&#x27;s &quot;how&quot;...&quot;. In 2003, he provided the voice of the eponymous main character in the feature-length animation &quot;Dominator&quot;. Moreover, Filth has appeared numerous times on British television, most notably 1998&#x27;s &quot;Living With the Enemy&quot;, &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; in 2001, &quot;Big Brother&#x27;s Big Mouth&quot; in 2008. He has also appeared on the American series &quot;Viva La Bam&quot; in 2005, and was interviewed for two episodes of the &quot;Metal Evolution&quot; series, on shock rock and extreme metal in 2012 and 2014 respectively.

In 2010, he was ranked 95 in the Hit Parader&#x27;s Top 100 Metal Vocalists of All Time.

Scottish death metal band Party Cannon dedicated Dani the song &quot;I Believe in Dani Filth&quot;, released in December 2021 with an animated version of Dani in a &quot;Street Fighter&quot;-styled video.

<text>Toscanelli is a tiny, bowl-shaped lunar impact crater that is located to the north of the prominent crater Aristarchus, in the northwestern part of the Moon. The crater lies at the southern end of a rille that proceeds towards the north. This rille is part of a nearby system that has the designation Rimae Aristarchus. Just to the south of Toscanelli is a fault line in the surface named the Rupes Toscanelli, after the crater. This break in the surface continues to the south for a distance of about 70 kilometers.

<text>Spleen and Ideal is the second studio album by Australian band Dead Can Dance. It was released on 25 November 1985 by 4AD. The album spearheaded the group&#x27;s sonic transition from their post-punk and gothic rock-influenced roots towards a neoclassical dark wave style.

== Musical style ==
&quot;Spleen and Ideal&quot; was produced by band members Lisa Gerrard and Brendan Perry together with producer John A. Rivers. The album saw the band abandon guitars in favour of a wider array of instrumentation, incorporating instruments such as cello, trombone and timpani, as well as the use of a drum machine and a sampler. The album included influences from medieval and classical music and has been described as having &quot;an almost world-spanning monastic feel&quot;, while still retaining the post-punk and gothic rock elements from their 1984 debut album.

Discussing the album&#x27;s musical style, AllMusic commented that with &quot;Spleen and Ideal&quot;, Dead Can Dance &quot;fully took the plunge into the heady mix of musical traditions that would come to define its sound and style for the remainder of its career. The straightforward goth affectations are exchanged for a sonic palette and range of imagination&quot;.

== Title and cover image ==
The band&#x27;s official website stated that the album title was taken &quot;from 19th Century symbolist ideals&quot;. The title is directly taken from &quot;Spleen et Idéal&quot;, a collection of poems by French poet Charles Baudelaire which form a section of his magnum opus &quot;Les Fleurs du mal&quot;.

The cover image shows the partial demolition of Grain Elevator No. 2 at Salford Quays, part of Manchester and Salford Docks.

== Critical reception ==
In a retrospective review, AllMusic praised the album, calling it &quot;amazing [...] &#x27;haunting&#x27; and &#x27;atmospheric&#x27; barely [scratch] even the initial surface of the album&#x27;s power&quot;.

<text>Steve Kimock (born October 5, 1955) is an American rock guitarist. He was a member of San Francisco Bay Area bands Zero and KVHW. 

His tone and some of his playing approach has been compared to Jerry Garcia, who was a friend of his, and he has been affiliated with musicians connected to Grateful Dead, including the bands the Other Ones, RatDog, and Phil Lesh and Friends. Garcia cited Kimock, along with Frank Gambale and Michael Hedges, as his favorite guitar players during the later part of his life. 

==Early life and education==
Kimock was born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in the Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania on October 5, 1955, to his parents Joseph and Mildred Kimock. He briefly attended Liberty High School, but was expelled in his freshman year. He was subsequently sent to the Lehigh Centennial School for the socially and emotionally disturbed.

==Career==
In the mid-1970s, Kimock moved to San Francisco to play guitar with the folk-rock group the Goodman Brothers. In 1979, after working with Martin Fierro in the salsa band the Underdogs, he joined the Heart of Gold Band with Keith Godchaux, Donna Jean Godchaux, and drummer Greg Anton. Other groups that Kimock has played with include KVHW, which he formed with Bobby Vega, Ray White, and Alan Hertz, and the Steve Kimock Band, which included drummer Rodney Holmes.

In 1984, Kimock, Anton, and John Cipollina, formerly of Quicksilver Messenger Service, co-founded the instrumental psychedelic rock group Zero. When Judge Murphy joined the band in 1991, it was no longer instrumental. The album &quot;Chance in a Million&quot; had songs written by lyricist Robert Hunter of the Grateful Dead. Zero toured and recorded until 2000. Band members included Chip Roland, Melvin Seals, Liam Hanrahan, Pete Sears, Bobby Vega, Nicky Hopkins, and Vince Welnick. In March 2006, Zero reunited and toured until the death of Martin Fierro two years later. The band reunited again in 2011 for the twentieth anniversary of the &quot;Chance in a Million&quot; recording sessions. They played a benefit concert at the Great American Music Hall for Judge Murphy, who had cancer.

Kimock has toured and recorded with many Grateful Dead-themed bands, including Keith and Donna Godchaux&#x27;s Heart of Gold Band (1979–80), Bob Weir&#x27;s Kingfish (1986), Merl Saunders and the Rainforest Band (1990–91), Vince Welnick&#x27;s Missing Man Formation (1996–97), Phil Lesh and Friends (1998–99), and The Other Ones (1998–2000). He was also a member of the Rhythm Devils in 2006, a supergroup formed by Grateful Dead drummers Bill Kreutzmann and Mickey Hart, also featuring Mike Gordon of Phish. In July 2007, Kimock was asked to fill in for a few months for Mark Karan in Bob Weir&#x27;s RatDog and rejoined Ratdog in 2013. In October 2016, Kimock was added to Bob Weir&#x27;s Campfire touring band in support of Weir&#x27;s 2016 solo release &quot;Blue Mountain&quot;. He tours with his own band, Steve Kimock &amp; Friends and occasionally Zero. He has also toured with Jorma Kaukonen and Hot Tuna throughout the past decade and is an instructor at Jorma&#x27;s Fur Peace guitar camp.

In addition to those affiliations, Kimock also toured and recorded with Jerry Joseph&#x27;s Little Women (1988), with Henry Kaiser and Freddy Roulette as The Psychedelic Guitar Circus (1993), and as Steve Kimock &amp; Friends (early 1990s). In 2001, he recorded with Pete Sears on his album &quot;The Long Haul&quot;. Kimock featured on two recordings by Bruce Hornsby (&quot;Big Swing Face&quot; and &quot;Here Come the Noise Makers&quot;), and toured as featured guitarist with Hornsby and his band in 2002. Kimock was also featured along with Bobby Vega and Jimmy Sanchez in the Pete Sears written soundtrack for the film, &quot;The Fight in the Fields: Cesar Chavez and the Farmworkers&#x27; Struggle&quot;.

Kimock released a solo record &quot;Last Danger of Frost&quot; (2016), and &quot;Satellite City&quot; (KIMOCK, 2017) with his son John Kimock and singer/multi-instrumentalist Leslie Mendelson.

Kimock was a member of Jazz is Dead on its 2023 tour.

==Personal life==
Kimock has been married since 2000 to Jennifer Kimock and has four children. In 2019, he moved back to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in the Lehigh Valley.

<doc id="1013634" wikidata="Q2893000" url="?curid=1013634" title="Jordanian annexation of the West Bank">
<text>The Jordanian administration of the West Bank officially began on 24 April 1950, and ended with the decision to sever ties on 31 July 1988. The period started during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, when Jordan occupied and subsequently annexed the portion of Mandatory Palestine that became known as the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. The territory remained under Jordanian control until it was occupied by Israel during the 1967 Six Day War and eventually Jordan renounced its claim to the territory in 1988.

During the December 1948 Jericho Conference, hundreds of Palestinian notables in the West Bank gathered, accepted Jordanian rule and recognized Abdullah as ruler. The West Bank was formally annexed on 24 April 1950, but the annexation was widely considered as illegal and void by most of the international community, including the Arab League, which ultimately decided to treat Jordan as a temporary trustee pending future settlement. Recognition of Jordan&#x27;s declaration of annexation was granted only by the United Kingdom, Iraq, and possibly Pakistan. The United States while avoiding public approval, also recognized this extension of Jordanian sovereignty.

When Jordan transferred its full citizenship rights to the residents of the West Bank, the annexation more than tripled the population of Jordan, going from 400,000 to 1,300,000. The naturalized Palestinians were given half of the seats of the Jordanian parliament.

==Background==
===Partition and 1947/48 diplomacy===
Prior to hostilities in 1948, Mandatory Palestine (modern-day West Bank, Gaza Strip and Israel) had been administered by the British Empire pursuant to the Mandate for Palestine, having captured it from the Ottomans in 1917. The British, as custodians of the land, implemented the land tenure laws in Palestine, which it had inherited from the Ottomans (as defined in the Ottoman Land Code of 1858). Toward the expiration of the British Mandate, Arabs aspired to independence and self-determination, as did the Jews of the country.

On 29 November 1947 the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 181 which envisaged the division of Palestine into three parts: an Arab State, a Jewish State and the City of Jerusalem. The proposed Arab State would include the central and part of western Galilee, with the town of Acre, the hill country of Samaria and Judea, an enclave at Jaffa, and the southern coast stretching from north of Isdud (now Ashdod) and encompassing what is now the Gaza Strip, with a section of desert along the Egyptian border. The proposed Jewish State would include the fertile Eastern Galilee, the Coastal Plain, stretching from Haifa to Rehovot and most of the Negev desert. The Jerusalem Corpus separatum was to include Bethlehem and the surrounding areas. The proposed Jewish State covered 56.47% of Mandatory Palestine (excluding Jerusalem) with a population of 498,000 Jews and 325,000 Arabs while the proposed Arab State covered 43.53% of Mandatory Palestine (excluding Jerusalem), with 807,000 Arab inhabitants and 10,000 Jewish inhabitants and in Jerusalem, an international trusteeship regime where the population was 100,000 Jews and 105,000 Arabs.

In March 1948, the British Cabinet had agreed that the civil and military authorities in Palestine should make no effort to oppose the setting up of a Jewish State or a move into Palestine from Transjordan.
The United States, together with the United Kingdom, favoured the annexation by Transjordan. The UK preferred to permit King Abdullah to annex the territory at the earliest date, while the United States preferred to wait until after the conclusion of negotiations brokered by the Palestine Conciliation Commission.

===Entry of Transjordan forces into Mandate Palestine===
Following the end of the British Mandate for Palestine and Israel&#x27;s declaration of independence on 14 May 1948, the Arab Legion, under the leadership of Sir John Bagot Glubb, known as Glubb Pasha, was ordered to enter Mandatory Palestine and secure the UN-designated Arab area.

===Armistice===
By the end of the war, Jordanian forces had control over the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. On 3 April 1949, Israel and Jordan signed an armistice agreement. The main points included:
* Jordanian forces remained in most positions they held in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and the Old City.
* Jordan withdrew its forces from its front posts overlooking the Sharon plain. In return, Israel agreed to allow Jordanian forces to take over positions in the West Bank previously held by Iraqi forces.
* A Special Committee was to be formed to make arrangements for safe movement of traffic between Jerusalem and the Mount Scopus campus of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, along the Latrun-Jerusalem Highway, free access to the Holy Places, and other matters. The committee was never formed, and access to the Holy Places was denied to Israelis.

The remainder of the area designated as part of an Arab state under the UN Partition Plan was partly occupied by Egypt (Gaza Strip), partly occupied and annexed by Israel (West Negev, West Galilee, Jaffa). The intended international enclave of Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Jordan.

==Jordanian occupation and annexation==
===The road to annexation===
After the invasion, Jordan began making moves to perpetuate the Jordanian occupation over the Arab part of Palestine. King Abdullah appointed governors on his behalf in the Arab cities of Ramallah, Hebron, Nablus, Bethlehem, Ramla and the Arab controlled part of Jerusalem, that were captured by Legion in the invasion. These governors were mostly Palestinians (including Aref al-Aref, Ibrahim Hashem and Ahmed Hilmi Pasha), and the Jordanians described them as &quot;military&quot; governors, so that it would not anger the other Arab states, which opposed Jordan&#x27;s plans to incorporate the Arab part of Palestine into the kingdom. The king made other smaller moves towards the annexation of the West Bank: He ordered Palestinian policemen to wear the uniforms of the Jordanian police and its symbols; he instituted the use of Jordanian postage stamps instead of the British ones; Palestinian municipalities were not allowed to collect taxes and issue licenses; and the radio of Ramallah called the locals to disobey the instructions of pro-Husseini officials and obey those of the Jordanian-backed governors.

The December 1948 Jericho Conference, a meeting of prominent Palestinian leaders convened by King Abdullah I voted in favor of annexation into what was then Transjordan. Transjordan became the &quot;Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan&quot; on 26 April 1949. Military occupation concluded on 2 November 1949 via promulgation of the Law Amending Public Administration Law in Palestine whereby the laws of Palestine were declared to remain applicable. In the Jordanian parliament, the West and East Banks received 30 seats each, having roughly equal populations. The first elections were held on 11 April 1950. Although the West Bank had not yet been annexed, its residents were permitted to vote.

===Annexation===
A 1949 amendment to the British Mandate&#x27;s 1928 Nationality Law in 1949 effectively imposed Jordanian citizenship on the region&#x27;s 420,000 local Palestinians, 280,000 Palestinian refugees in the West Bank and 70,000 Palestinian refugees in the East Bank, ahead of formal annexation on 24 April 1950. Then in 1954, Jordan&#x27;s Nationality Law clarified the conditions under which Palestinian Arabs could obtain Jordanian citizenship.

Unlike any other Arab country to which they fled after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Palestinian refugees in the West Bank (and on the East Bank) were given Jordanian citizenship on the same basis as existing residents. Elihu Lauterpacht described it as a move that &quot;entirely lacked legal justification.&quot; The annexation formed part of Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Greater Syria Plan&quot; expansionist policy, and in response, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and Syria joined Egypt in demanding Jordan&#x27;s expulsion from the Arab League. A motion to expel Jordan from the League was prevented by the dissenting votes of Yemen and Iraq. On 12 June 1950, the Arab League declared the annexation was a temporary, practical measure and that Jordan was holding the territory as a &quot;trustee&quot; pending a future settlement. On 27 July 1953, King Hussein of Jordan announced that East Jerusalem was &quot;the alternative capital of the Hashemite Kingdom&quot; and would form an &quot;integral and inseparable part&quot; of Jordan. In an address to parliament in Jerusalem in 1960, Hussein called the city the &quot;second capital of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan&quot;.

Only the United Kingdom formally recognized the annexation of the West Bank, &quot;de facto&quot; in the case of East Jerusalem. In 1950, the British extended formal recognition to the union between the Hashemite Kingdom and that part of Palestine under Jordanian control - with the exception of Jerusalem. The British government stated that it regarded the provisions of the Anglo-Jordan Treaty of Alliance of 1948 as applicable to all the territory included in the union. The United States Department of State also recognized this extension of Jordanian sovereignty. Pakistan is claimed to have recognized Jordan&#x27;s annexation too, but this is disputed. Despite Arab League opposition, the inhabitants of the West Bank became citizens of Jordan.

Tensions continued between Jordan and Israel through the early 1950s, with Palestinian guerrillas and Israeli commandos crossing the Green Line. Abdullah I of Jordan, who had become Emir of Transjordan in 1921 and King in 1923, was assassinated in July 1951 during a visit to the Jami Al-Aqsa on the Temple Mount in East Jerusalem by a Palestinian gunman following rumours that he was discussing a peace treaty with Israel. The trial found that this assassination had been planned by Colonel Abdullah el-Tell, ex-military governor of Jerusalem, and Musa Abdullah Husseini. He was succeeded by his son Talal and then his grandson Hussein.

===Access to holy sites===

Clauses in the 3 April 1949 Armistice Agreements specified that Israelis would have access to the religious sites in East Jerusalem. However, Jordan refused to implement this clause, arguing that Israel&#x27;s refusal to permit the return of Palestinians to their homes in West Jerusalem voided that clause in the agreement. Tourists entering East Jerusalem had to present baptismal certificates or other proof they were not Jewish.

The special committee that was to make arrangements for visits to holy places was never formed and Israelis, irrespective of religion, were barred from entering the Old City and other holy sites. Significant parts of the Jewish Quarter, much of it severely damaged in the war, together with synagogues such as the Hurva Synagogue, which had also been used as a military base in the conflict, were destroyed. It was said that some gravestones from the Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives had been used for construction, paving roads and to build latrines for a nearby Jordanian army barracks.
The Jordanians immediately expelled all the Jewish residents of East Jerusalem. Mark Tessler cites John Oesterreicher as writing that during Jordanian rule, &quot;34 out of the Old City&#x27;s 35 synagogues were dynamited. Some were turned into stables, others into chicken coops.&quot;

==Aftermath==
===Six-Day War and end of Jordanian control===

By the end of the Six-Day War, the formerly Jordanian-controlled West Bank with its one million Palestinian population had come under Israeli military occupation. About 300,000 Palestinian refugees were expelled or fled to Jordan. After 1967, all religious groups were granted administration over their own holy sites, while administration of the Temple Mount – sacred to Jews, Christians, and Muslims – remained in the hands of the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf.

===Jordanian disengagement===
Following the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel occupied the West Bank (including East Jerusalem). Although the sides were technically at war, a policy known as &quot;open bridges&quot; meant that Jordan continued to pay salaries and pensions to civil servants and to provide services to endowments and educational affairs and in general to play an active role in West Bank affairs.
In 1972, King Hussein conceived a plan to establish a united Arab federation which would include the West Bank and Jordan. This proposal never came to fruition.

In 1974, the Arab League decided to recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. The decision forced King Hussein to relinquish his claim to speak for the Palestinian people during peace negotiations and to recognize an independent Palestinian state that is independent of Jordan.

On 28 July 1988, King Hussein announced the cessation of a $1.3 billion development program for the West Bank. He explained that the aim of this move was to allow the PLO to take more responsibility for these territories. Two days later the king dissolved Jordan&#x27;s lower house of parliament, half of whose members represented constituencies in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

On 31 July 1988, King Hussein announced the severance of all legal and administrative ties with the West Bank, except for the Jordanian sponsorship of the Muslim and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem, and recognised the PLO as &quot;the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people&quot;. In his speech to the nation held on that day he announced his decision and explained that this decision was made with the aim of helping the Palestinian people establishing their own independent state.

The 1993 Oslo Accords between the PLO and Israel &quot;opened the road for Jordan to proceed on its own negotiating track with Israel.&quot; The Washington Declaration was initialled one day after the Oslo Accords were signed. &quot;On July 25, 1994, King Hussein met with Israeli Prime Minister Rabin in the Rose Garden of the White House, where they signed the Washington Declaration, formally ending the 46-year state of war between Jordan and Israel.&quot; Finally, on 26 October 1994, Jordan signed the Israel–Jordan peace treaty, which normalized relations between the two countries and resolved territorial disputes between them.

<text>The Bronfman family is a Canadian family, known for its extensive business holdings. It owes its initial fame to Samuel Bronfman (1889–1971), the most influential Canadian Jew of the mid-20th century, who made a fortune in the alcoholic distilled beverage business during American prohibition, including the sale of liquor through organized crime, through founding the Seagram Company, and who later became president of the Canadian Jewish Congress (1939–62).

The family is of Russian-Jewish and Romanian-Jewish ancestry; the patriarch, Yechiel (Ekiel) Bronfman, was originally a tobacco farmer from Bessarabia. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; staff reporter Nathaniel Popper, the Bronfman family is &quot;perhaps the single largest force in the Jewish charitable world&quot;.

==Early history==
The name &quot;Bronfman&quot; (Yiddish בראָנפמאַן &quot;bronfman&quot;) comes from Yiddish בראָנפֿן &quot;bronfn&quot;, &#x27;liquor, whisky/whiskey, spirits&#x27;, which is cognate with German &quot;Branntwein&quot; (in Germany the term refers to any distilled spirits), Dutch &quot;brandewijn&quot; (which became English &quot;brandywine&quot;, i.e., &#x27;brandy&#x27;), and Afrikaans &quot;brandewyn&quot;, plus Yiddish מאַן &quot;man&quot;, &#x27;man&#x27;; it coincidently translates to &#x27;spirits-man&#x27;, referring to one who makes or sells whiskey. The Bronfman family in Canada began with tobacco farmer Yechiel Bronfman (aka Ekiel Bronfman; 16 November 1855 - 24 December 1919) and his wife, Mindel (née Elman; 25 May 1863 - 11 Nov 1918), who emigrated from Moldova to Canada with their children in 1889, escaping the anti-Semitic pogroms of Imperial Russia.

In addition to Samuel Bronfman, Yechiel and Mindel&#x27;s children at the time of emigration included Abe (15 March 1882, Russia - 16 March 1968, Safety Harbor, Florida), Harry (15 March 1886, Russia - 12 November 1963, Montreal, QC), and Laura Bronfman (1 Jan 1887, Russia - 1976); in total they had 8 children.

The family settled at a homestead near Wapella, Saskatchewan, but soon moved to Brandon, Manitoba. In 1903, the family borrowed money to buy a hotel (the Anglo-American Hotel) in Emerson, Manitoba, which turned out to be profitable due to railway construction. In 1906, the family moved to Winnipeg. With the advent of Prohibition in Canada, Samuel and his brothers turned their energy toward selling mail-order liquor. Following the government&#x27;s crack-down on the business, the brothers took another route: As it was still legal to sell alcohol as medicine, the brothers rebranded their liquor using names like &quot;Liver &amp; Kidney Cure&quot;, &quot;Dandy Bracer-Liver&quot;, and &quot;Rock-a-bye Cough-Cure&quot;. Samuel took control of the business after prohibition came to an end in the United States, and was known as &quot;Mr. Sam&quot;.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; staff reporter Nathaniel Popper, the Bronfman family is &quot;perhaps the single largest force in the Jewish charitable world&quot;. The family owes its initial fame to Samuel Bronfman (1889–1971), who made a fortune in the alcoholic distilled beverage business during American prohibition through founding the Seagram Company, and who later became president of the Canadian Jewish Congress (1939–62).

Saidye Bronfman, Samuel&#x27;s wife, was president of the Young Women’s Hebrew Association (YWHA) beginning in 1929, and later founded the women’s division of the Combined Jewish Appeal. In 1952, the couple formed The Samuel and Saidye Bronfman Family Foundation to make grants primarily in support of education, the arts, heritage preservation, and Jewish community initiatives. Their daughter, Phyllis Lambert, founded the Canadian Center for Architecture.

For years, Seagram was run by Samuel and Saidye&#x27;s sons, Edgar and Charles Bronfman; and their grandson Edgar Bronfman Jr. oversaw the sale of company to Vivendi. Charles was also co-founder of the Historica Foundation of Canada and Heritage Minutes, as well as chairman and principal owner of the Montreal Expos.

The youngest daughter of Edgar Sr., Clare Bronfman, was a benefactor of Keith Raniere and has been sentenced to almost seven years for her role in the NXIVM case. Samuel&#x27;s nephews Edward and Peter Bronfman (sons of Allan Bronfman), founded Edper Investments (now Brookfield Asset Management).

In 1994, the Bronfman family in collaboration with McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, supported the establishment of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada (MISC), a nonpartisan Canadian research institute.

In 1922, Samuel&#x27;s younger sister, Rose Bronfman (3 February 1898, Manitoba - 31 May 1988), was a substitute teacher and community activist. She married physician Maxwell Rady (born as Avraham Radishkevich, 24 November 1899 - 3 March 1964) - himself a Russian Jewish immigrant, who moved to Manitoba in 1893 - and the couple remained notable philanthropists in Winnipeg. The University of Manitoba named its health sciences faculty and its College of Medicine in Rady&#x27;s honor. The Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, and its Rady Children&#x27;s Institute for Genomic Medicine, are named after the Rady family in honor of its largest donor, Ernest S. Rady (b. 1937), Rose and Max&#x27;s son.

Jeremy and Eli Bronfman founded Lincoln Avenue Capital, a real estate investor and developer in affordable housing.

<text>Goleen () is a small rural village in County Cork on the south-western tip of Ireland. Farming, tourism and construction work are among the main occupations of the local people.

==Location==
Goleen is located towards the south-western end of the Mizen Peninsula, in West Cork. The land surrounding the village is unsuitable for farming, being hilly and rocky with limited soil cover.

Mizen Head, at the southern tip of the Mizen peninsula, about five miles from the village, is often claimed to be the most southerly point on the island of Ireland, but is in fact the country&#x27;s most southwesterly point. The distinction of being Ireland&#x27;s most southerly point belongs to nearby Brow Head, from where Guglielmo Marconi experimented with transatlantic radio signals at the beginning of the 20th century.

==Amenities==

The village has four pubs, a small shop, and a petrol station.

The town also has a community pitch on which locals play Gaelic football and soccer. In the sports hall beside the pitch is a table tennis club.

The village has a large Roman Catholic church; there is a smaller Church of Ireland church situated just outside the village but this has been deconsecrated and is the site for a sail-maker.

In 1852, shortly after the famine, the parish priest John Foley started to build a new parish church with the help of donations by Irish emigrants. The church was erected in the Neo-Gothic style with a cruciform aisleless ground plan, four bays, and a triplet window in the chancel behind the high altar. Bishop William Delaney of the diocese of Cork consecrated the church on 11 October 1854.

==Transport==
Bus Éireann run the 237 bus service from Cork City to Goleen.

The local nougat is one of the 13 desserts of Provence and highly appreciated throughout the country. Montelimar nougat is mentioned in the opening lines of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Savoy Truffle&quot; from &quot;The White Album&quot;. Travellers used to buy &quot;nougat de Montélimar&quot; on their way to the south of France (or when returning) as the city is next to the Rhône and to the primary route N7. Since the construction of the A7 autoroute, many nougat factories have been forced to close as tourists no longer stop in Montélimar but bypass it instead.

==Climate==
Montélimar has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) according to the Köppen climate classification.

<doc id="1013659" wikidata="Q1003502" url="?curid=1013659" title="Secunderabad">
<text>Secunderabad () is a twin city of Hyderabad and one of the six zones of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) in the Indian state of Telangana. It is the headquarters of the South Central Railway zone. Named after the Mir Akbar Ali Khan Sikander Jah, Asaf Jah III, Nizam of the Asaf Jahi dynasty, Secunderabad was established in 1806 as a British cantonment. Although both the cities are together referred to as the twin cities, Hyderabad and Secunderabad have different histories and cultures, with Secunderabad having developed directly under British rule until 1948, and Hyderabad as the capital of the Nizams&#x27; princely state of Hyderabad. Since 1956, the city has housed the Rashtrapati Nilayam, the winter office of the president of India. It is also the headquarters of the 54th Infantry Division of the Indian Army. There are also many residential areas and apartments, particularly in the small neighbourhood of Yapral, with many Indian Armed Forces officials living here.

Geographically divided from Hyderabad by the Hussain Sagar lake, Secunderabad is no longer a separate municipal unit and has become part of Hyderabad&#x27;s Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation. Both cities are collectively known as Hyderabad and together form the sixth-largest metropolis in India. Being one of the largest cantonments in India, Secunderabad has a large presence of army and air force personnel. Secunderabad also has a large number of lakes, with the northern part of the Hussain Sagar Lake being a part of the city and Fox Sagar Lake being the largest lake in Secunderabad. The city also houses the famous Ramoji Film City.

== History ==

 Following the dissolution of the Chalukya empire into four parts in the 11th century, the areas around the present-day Hyderabad and Secunderabad came under the control of the Kakatiya dynasty (1158–1310), whose seat of power was at Warangal, northeast of modern Hyderabad.

In 1310, the area of present-day Hyderabad and Secunderabad came under the rule of the Delhi Sultanate after the capture of Warangal, the Kakatiya capital. The modern city of Hyderabad was built and founded in 1592 by the Golconda Sultanate under Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah. The modern Secunderabad is also the site where the then Mughal emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur was defeated in the year 1754 by the Maratha Empire; the emperor arrived after the death of Nawab Anwaruddin Khan nearby at the Battle of Ambur in 1749. Anwaruddin Khan was the Nawab of Arcot.

The area around Secunderabad changed hands among various rulers, and the area was part of Nizam&#x27;s Hyderabad by the 18th century.

Modern Secunderabad was founded as a British cantonment after Nizam Asaf Jah II was defeated by the British East India Company. He was then forced to sign the 1798 Treaty of Subsidiary Alliance to get the favour of British troops camped in the village of Ulwul, north-east of Hussain Sagar, the lake that separates Secunderabad from its twin city Hyderabad. In 1803, Nizam Sikandar Jah, the third Nizam of Hyderabad, changed Ulwul&#x27;s name to Secunderabad after himself. The city was formed in 1806, after the order was signed by the Nizam allotting the land north of Hussain Sagar to set up the British Cantonment.
The drinking water needs of the British army in the cantonment and civilians in the cantonment area (areas now under Marredpally, Bowenpally and Tirumalgherry) were taken from &quot;Picket Lake&quot; (also known as Picket Tank), and from a few other water bodies. Picket Lake was located at the entrance of the cantonment. Picket Lake was connected to Hussainsagar through a channel. Gradually over the years, the channel turned into a municipal drain. The lake was gradually encroached upon and later a bus station was built in its location.

The twin cities are separated by the man-made Hussain Sagar lake, which was built during the reign of the Qutb Shahi dynasty in the 16th century. Unlike Hyderabad, the official language of Secunderabad was English. Secunderabad was exempted from customs duty on imported goods, thus making trade very profitable. Various new markets such as Regimental Bazaar and General Bazaar were created. After the First War of Indian Independence of 1857, the construction of a wall was started at Trimulgherry and completed in 1867.

Secunderabad Junction railway station, one of the largest in India and the zonal headquarters of South Central Railway, was established in 1874. The King Edward Memorial Hospital, now known as Gandhi Hospital, was established in 1851. A civil jail (now a heritage building known as Old Jail complex near Monda Market) was also established. Originally constructed in 1860 as the country house of the British Resident at Hyderabad, the Residency House is now known as the Rashtrapati Nilayam, the official retreat of the President of India.
Sir Winston Churchill, the prime minister of the United Kingdom during World War II, was posted in Secunderabad during the 1890s as a subaltern in the British Army. Sir Ronald Ross conducted his initial research on the cause of malaria in the city of Secunderabad. The original building is today called the Sir Ronald Ross Institute and is located on Minister Road.

Secunderabad Municipality was first formed in 1945. Later in 1950, along with Hyderabad Municipality, it was upgraded to Secunderabad Municipal Corporation under the Hyderabad Corporation Act, 1950. In 1960, by the Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Act of 1955, Secunderabad Municipal Corporation was merged with Hyderabad Corporation to form a single municipal corporation. Today Secunderabad is part of the Hyderabad district.

Post-Independence, the Secunderabad Cantonment Board came under the jurisdiction of the Indian Armed forces. Consequently, large military units were established. The popular neighbourhoods in Secunderabad are Tarnaka, Paradise Circle, Trimulgherry, Jawaharnagar colony, Marredpally, Jeera, General Bazar, Sitaphalmandi, Kharkhana, Ranigunj, Yapral, Kowkur and New Bhoiguda. Begumpet Airport is close to Secunderabad and served the twin city until early 2008.

== Demographics ==
As per the 2011 census report, males constituted 51% of the population and females 49%. Secunderabad had an average literacy rate of 73%, male literacy was 78%, and female literacy was 68%. 11% of the population was under 6 years of age. The city has a sizable population of Anglo-Indians, who mainly resided in the South Lallaguda area of Secunderabad which was popularly known as Little England. Many Anglo-Indians have emigrated to other countries in the English-speaking world over the last few decades.

== Culture ==
The camp transformed into an English town, and then into a truly cosmopolitan city where the Anglo-Indians, who had a colony popularly called &quot;Little England&quot;, rubbed shoulders with the Mudaliars of Tamil Nadu, the Rajasthani trading community, the Parsis, and the Sikhs, as the historian Narendra Luther book Laskar vividly captures the flavour in the chapter, &quot;Colours of the rainbow&quot;.

Due to the presence of communities such as Parsis and Anglo-Indians alongside British and native inhabitants, Secunderabad was historically a cosmopolitan city. Secunderabad used to be referred to by the locals as &quot;Lashkar,&quot; meaning the army and the city&#x27;s culture reflected the same. Secunderabad was a liberal city compared to Hyderabad due to the presence of the British.

The popular Secunderabad Club was established in 1878, at a country house gifted by Salar Jung I. Secunderabad has a more laid-back atmosphere because it is mainly a residential area with fewer government offices and corporate establishments. On 16 January 2022, a massive fire engulfed most of the Secunderabad Club, destroying many iconic structures. The club is also one of the oldest clubs in India.

Many outdoor events such as the Republic Day parade and fairs are held in the Gymkhana or Parade grounds. Christmas is celebrated by the Christian residents. An annual festival known as the Bonalu is celebrated by the Hindus of the Telangana state. It is usually held during the Ashadha, which is at the start of the monsoon season. Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting, is observed by the local Muslims. There are old temples like Laxminarayana Swami Temple and Mahakali Temple. Local churches like Wesely church and St. Mary&#x27;s church add to the cosmopolitan culture of the city. Many mosques can be found in Secunderabad, serving the Muslim population of the city. The culture of Secunderabad is distinctly different from that of Hyderabad&#x27;s Nawabi culture.

===Cinemas in Secunderabad===
Some of the popular cinemas in Secunderabad were Sangeet, Tivoli, Anand, Natraj, Ajanta etc. These cinemas were also popular landmarks in the city. However, most of these cinemas are either closed or transformed. Sangeet was a popular cinema theatre that screened only American movies. Plaza Cinema was the only theatre in India where viewers could sip a beer while watching a movie. 

== Economy ==

ITC, Infosys, Intergraph, and Coromandel International are some of the major private companies that have their offices in Secunderabad. Being the headquarters of South Central Railway, Secunderabad is a major centre for railway activity. Industrial areas such as Bolarum, Moula-Ali, Nacharam, Ghatkesar, Uppal, etc. are in Secunderabad. Secunderabad Cantonment Board houses a large number of defence units. Units of the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), such as Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research (AMD), Nuclear Fuel Complex (NFC), and ECIL are close to Secunderabad. There are also many hotels here, like Taj Krishna and ITC hotels.

== Government ==

The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), established in 2007, is responsible for the administration and infrastructure of Secunderabad. Secunderabad Municipality was first formed in 1945. Later in 1950, along with Hyderabad Municipality, it was upgraded to Secunderabad Municipal Corporation under the Hyderabad Corporation Act of 1950. In 1960, by the Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Act of 1955, Secunderabad Municipal Corporation was merged with Hyderabad Corporation to form a single Municipal Corporation. During Nizam&#x27;s period, Secunderabad Cantonment was under the control of the British Raj. Today those areas, and most parts of Secunderabad where defence installations are located, are under the purview of Secunderabad Cantonment Board. There are eight civilian wards in Secunderabad Cantonment Board, with a population of four lakh.

The Secunderabad Municipality office which was located on Sardar Patel Road is to be demolished for the metro rail project. The new office is located at West Marredpally.

<text>Andrew Christopher Denton (born 4 May 1960) is an Australian television producer, comedian, Gold Logie–nominated television presenter and former radio host, and was the host of the ABC&#x27;s weekly television interview program &quot;Enough Rope&quot; and the ABC game show &quot;Randling&quot;. He is known for his comedy and interviewing technique. He is also responsible for introducing the troupe of &quot;The Chaser&quot; to Australian audiences.

==Early life==
Denton is the son of Kit Denton, writer and the author of the novel &quot;The Breaker&quot;, about Australian soldier Breaker Morant. He went to Roseville Primary School in Sydney, before attending Blue Mountains Grammar School in Wentworth Falls. In 1977 he attended Guildford Grammar School in Perth. He then studied at Mitchell College of Advanced Education (MCAE) (now Charles Sturt University) in Bathurst, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in communications in 1982. He was involved in the campus radio station, 2MCE.

==Career==
===Radio===
Denton worked on Australian radio stations early in his media career, beginning as a writer for radio presenter Doug Mulray on Triple M Sydney. He had an early involvement in the Sydney Theatresports movement.

Denton worked as a morning radio host for the Triple M in Sydney. His time on Triple M included the &quot;House From Hell&quot; reality TV program, in which various contestants were placed in a house together and involved in various stunts, tricks and tortures. Denton has said in radio interviews that he regrets being involved in the program due to the unacceptable level of human manipulation.

===Television===
Denton made his first television appearance as an extra on the ABC television series &quot;The Investigators&quot;, and progressed to being a member of the team that was runner-up on the Australian improvised comedy show &quot;Theatresports&quot; in 1987.

Between 1988 and 1995 he hosted the TV shows &quot;Blah Blah Blah&quot; (1988), &quot;The Money or the Gun&quot; (1989–1990), &quot;Live and Sweaty&quot; (1991–1995), all on ABC-TV, as well as a comedy talk show, &quot;Denton&quot; (1994–1995), which aired on Seven Network. These shows were talk-based. &quot;Live and Sweaty&quot; focused on sports and was panel-based.

Each week on &quot;The Money or the Gun&quot;, Denton had a musical guest play a cover version of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; in a different musical style, usually the genre of the guest&#x27;s own musical style.

Robert Plant and Jimmy Page, musicians from Led Zeppelin, later appeared on &quot;Denton&quot; to perform a Rolf Harris song. (Harris performed a notable version of &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, with wobble board solo.) Denton saw the beginning of the Musical Challenge segment, and challenged musical guests to perform a song from a barrel full of well-known songs. This segment evolved during his time on Triple M, resulting in three albums, with tracks including Tina Arena singing Cold Chisel&#x27;s &quot;Cheap Wine&quot;, The Wiggles singing AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to the Top&quot;, Neil Finn performing Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;Sexual Healing&quot;, James Reyne performing Kate Bush&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, Barenaked Ladies performing Prince&#x27;s &quot;When Doves Cry&quot;, and Paul Kelly performing Prince&#x27;s &quot;Little Red Corvette&quot;. Three volumes were released on CD titled &quot;Andrew Denton&#x27;s Musical Challenge&quot;. In the early 1990s, Denton was the first guest programmer on &quot;Rage&quot;.

Denton appeared as a contestant on the Nine Network&#x27;s &quot;Sale of the Century&quot;.

While presenting his talk show &quot;Denton&quot;, he launched a public subscription scheme to hire a bounty hunter to capture fugitive businessman Christopher Skase, who was attempting to avoid extradition to Australia at the time. He had a cameo appearance in the Australian film &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Skase&quot;.

In 2003, Denton began hosting &quot;Enough Rope with Andrew Denton&quot;. He was executive producer and script editor for ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Election Chaser&quot; and &quot;CNNNN&quot;. In an audience development survey in 2004, respondents named Denton as one of the &quot;most liked and recognisable&quot; personalities on Australian television. &quot;Enough Rope&quot; ended in late 2008. Also in 2003, Denton provided the narration for the ABC TV animated documentary series &quot;Human Contraptions&quot;.

Asked about the best skill an interviewer can bring to the job, Denton said: &quot;Research, clearly. Listening, obviously. And leaving myself open to the possibility it won&#x27;t go the way I expect.&quot;

In 2009, Denton hosted the second season of &quot;Elders&quot;, a series of interviews with ageing notable Australians. After this series finished, Denton took a few years off being in front of the camera and spent more time behind the scenes. In 2012, he returned to hosting duties, to ABC&#x27;s game show, &quot;Randling&quot;.

In 2014, Denton appeared on the SBS TV program &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, tracing his Jewish family line to Poland. Traced also to Meir Katzenellenbogen He visited the Treblinka extermination camp and contemplated what his fate might have been had his grandfather not moved to England.

In 2018, Denton hosted &quot;Interview&quot;, produced by Legacy Media for the Seven Network.

===Film===
Denton&#x27;s first feature-length documentary, &quot;God on My Side&quot;, documents his visit to the National Religious Broadcasters Convention. It was first shown at the Sydney Film Festival in June 2006 with plans to show it as a TV special on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Enough Rope&quot;. It was screened in Australian cinemas from 2 November 2006. Denton insists he is not anti-Christian.

In 2011, Denton served as executive producer on the crowd-funded horror film &quot;The Tunnel&quot;. The film was directed by Carlo Ledesma, co-written, co-produced and co-edited by Julian Harvey and Enzo Tedeschi, and produced with Denton&#x27;s production company Zapruder&#x27;s Other Films.

===Stage===
Denton appeared as Malcolm Turnbull in the Belvoir Street Theatre production of &quot;A Royal Commission into the Australian Economy&quot;, written by John Clarke and Ross Stevenson, and participated in the early years of the ABC&#x27;s &quot;World Series Debating&quot;.

===Production===

<text>Auspitz&#x27;s sign is the appearance of punctate bleeding spots when psoriasis scales are scraped off, named after Heinrich Auspitz. It may also be seen in Darier&#x27;s disease and actinic keratosis.

Importantly, as with many eponymous clinical signs, Heinrich Auspitz was not the first to discover the sign named after him. It was Auspitz&#x27;s mentor at the Medical University of Vienna (Ferdinand von Hebra) and Parisian dermatologist Marie Devergie who first noted the punctate hemorrhages underlying psoriasis scales.

This pinpoint bleeding results from a thinning of the epidermal layer overlying the tips of the dermal papillae. Blood vessels within the papillae are dilated and tortuous, and often bleed readily when the scale is removed.

Although classically associated with psoriasis, subsequent research has found Auspitz&#x27;s sign to be of very little diagnostic value for the disease. This is because several other diseases display the sign (including Darier&#x27;s disease and actinic keratosis). Additionally, only a minority of psoriasis scales show it when removed (&lt;18%). This overall indicates that Auspitz&#x27;s sign is neither highly sensitive nor specific for psoriasis, and thus should only be used in combination with other findings to make a diagnosis.

<text>Darier&#x27;s disease (DD) is a rare, genetic skin disorder. It is an autosomal dominant disorder, that is, if one parent has DD, there is a 50% chance than a child will inherit DD. It was first reported by French dermatologist Ferdinand-Jean Darier in 1889.

Mild forms of the disease are the most common, consisting of skin rashes that flare up under conditions such as high humidity, high stress, or tight-fitting clothes. Short stature, combined with poorly-formed fingernails that contain vertical striations, is diagnostic even for mild forms. Symptoms usually appear in late childhood or early adulthood between the ages of about 15 and 30 years and will vary over the lifespan in an intermittent pattern of relapse (flareups) and remit.
More severe cases are characterized by dark crusty patches on the skin that are mildly greasy and that can emit a strong odor. These patches, also known as keratotic papules, keratosis follicularis, or dyskeratosis follicularis, most often appear on the arms, chest, back and legs.

DD was initially studied by dermatologists. Recent research however shows DD has a whole-body effect, including cognitive (learning and intellectual) deficits, and mental health issues, particularly depression.

==Diagnosis and symptoms==

Diagnosis of Darier disease is often made by the appearance of the skin and nails, family history, and/or genetic testing for the mutation in the ATP2A2 gene. However, many individuals are never diagnosed because of the mildness of their symptoms. Mild cases present clinically as minor rashes (without odor) that can become exacerbated by heat, humidity, stress, and sunlight.

Clinical symptoms of the disease:
* Fragile or poorly formed fingernails with vertical striations (as distinct from nail biting). The malformed nails often have V-shaped nicks at the edge of the nail.
* Rash that covers many areas of the body, sometimes with weeping. In severe cases, it is often associated with an unpleasant odor. The rash can be aggravated by heat, humidity, and exposure to sunlight.
* Seborrhoeic areas. Areas where excess oil and sebum is released. Overall greasy or scaly skin either in the central chest and back or in the folds of the skin.
* Painful skin and itching (pruritus).

Other less common or less noticed symptoms are:

* Acrokeratosis verruciformis. Acrokeratosis (AKV) is characterized by several small wart-like and flat-topped bumps that line the skin on typically the hand and feet.
* Hypermelanotic macule. Dark patches on the skin that contain excess pigment.
* Subungual hyperkeratotic fragments. Thickened skin that is often discolored, under nails, on either hands or feet.

== Epidemiology and mental health ==
Worldwide prevalence of DD is estimated as between 1:30,000 and 1:100,000. Case studies have shown estimated prevalence by country to be 3.8:100,000 in Slovenia, 1:36,000 in north-east England, 1:30,000 in Scotland, and 1:100,000 in Denmark.

DD is seen in males and females equally. Symptoms typically arise between the ages of about 15 and 30, and vary over the lifetime in a relapse and remit pattern, in particular flareups that need to be managed. DD is inherited (genetic), and in particular can be traced in family groups in specific geographic localities.

Darier&#x27;s disease is a non-communicable disorder, but secondary infections by bacteria and viruses can be spread to others.

DD was initially identified and studied by dermatologists (skin specialists) as a purely skin disease. Recent research however suggests DD has a whole-body effect, including cognitive and mental health issues.

A study of 100 British individuals diagnosed with Darier&#x27;s disease reported that affected individuals display elevated frequencies of neuropsychiatric conditions. They had high lifetime rates for mood disorders (50%), including depression (30%), bipolar disorder (4%), suicidal thoughts (31%), and suicide attempts (13%).

A Swedish study of 770 individuals with DD showed a six-fold risk of being diagnosed with an intellectual disability, compared to matched Swedish population controls.

A study of 76 DD patients found that 41% reported learning difficulties, notably reading difficulties, and 74% reported a family history of learning disabilities. The full range of learning difficulties is not known.

== Etiology and genetics ==
Skin changes in Darier&#x27;s disease are related to a type of nutritional vitamin A deficiency that is caused by genetic mutations. The skin displays follicular dyskeratosis (degeneration of the skin in hair follicules), which reflects as hypovitaminosis A (systemic Vitamin A deficiency). The skin reactions are caused by an abnormality in the desmosome-keratin filament complex leading to a breakdown in cell adhesion.

Mutations in a single gene, ATP2A2, are the ultimate cause for the development of Darier&#x27;s disease. It is an autosomal dominant disorder, that is, if one parent has DD, there is a 50% chance than a child will inherit DD.

=== Subtypes of Darier&#x27;s disease ===
Subtypes of DD have been preliminarily suggested. A large number of mutant alleles of ATP2A2 have been identified in association with Darier&#x27;s Disease. One study of 19 families and 6 sporadic cases found 24 specific, novel mutations associated with DD symptoms. This study reported a loose, imperfect correlation between the severity of ATP2A2 mutations with the severity of the condition. Significant variability in disease severity between members of the same family carrying the same mutation was also reported by this study, suggesting that genetic modifiers contribute to the phenotypic penetrance of certain mutations.

One subtype is linear Darier&#x27;s disease. These cases result from somatic mutations to ATP2A2 in epidermal stem cells. Such individuals display phenotypic mosaicism, where the Darier&#x27;s phenotype only affects the subset of epidermal tissue arising from the mutated progenitor cell.  Somatic mutations are not inherited by the offspring of such individuals.

== Treatment ==
Two recent reviews of the medical literature have evaluated treatment strategies for DD. Management and treatment of Darier disease depends on the severity of the presented clinical symptoms. Mild symptoms are often treated with moisturising creams, and more severe symptoms with topical and oral retinol or other medications (oral medications having higher strength than topical equivalents), and medical procedures.

In many mild cases, DD can be managed by avoiding excessive perspiration and non-breathable and abrasive clothing (producing contact dermatitis), washing with salty water, and gentle abrasion with a gauze pad. This is supplemented by moisturising lotions and topical sunscreens. Most patients with Darier&#x27;s disease can live normal healthy lives.

In more severe cases of DD, application of topical and oral medications, particularly retinoids, is prescribed. Hospitalisation may be required for seriously affected individuals who display frequent relapse and remit patterns and severe infections.

Rapid resolution of rash symptoms can be complicated by the increased vulnerability of affected skin surfaces to secondary bacterial or viral infections. Bacterial overgrowth can produce an odour. The main bacteria is epidermal Staphylococcus aureus. The main viruses are human papillomavirus (HPV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Infections are treated with antibiotics (for bacteria) and antiviral medications (for viruses).

Treatments that have evidence-based support (though not for all persons treated) can be classified into a number of groups. Because DD is a product of systemic Vitamin A deficiency, retinoids, chemical compounds (molecules) that are forms of (or related to) Vitamin A, are often recommended. Vitamin A acid compounds are often preferred as being less toxic than Vitamin A itself.

1. Topical medications: Retinoids (Adapalene, Tretinoin, Isotretinoin, Tazarotene gel). Topical retinoids help in the reduction of hyperkeratosis. They work by causing the skin cells in the top layers to die and be shed off.
* Vitamin A analogs (Calciptriol, Tacalitol).

2. Other topical medications. 
* 5-fluouracil, a chemotherapeutic agent.
* Benzoyal peroxide 5% gel. Antibacterial effect and removes dead skin, but frequent use can cause skin irritation and other side effects, as well as bleaching of hair and clothes.
* Topical corticosteroids.

3. Oral medications: Retinoids (Acitretin, Isotretinoin). If symptoms are severe, oral retinoids have been proven to be very effective. However, there can be many adverse (and sometimes serious) side-effects associated with prolonged use.
* Systemic Vitamin A analogs.

4. Medical Procedures: Surgical excision and dermabrasion, laser procedures, radiation procedures (grenz-ray, X-ray, radiology).
* Dermabrasion. Removal of the top layer of skin to help smooth and stimulate new growth of the skin.
* Electrosurgery. Used to help stop bleeding and remove abnormal skin growths.

== Support groups ==
Further information on and advocacy work for Darier&#x27;s disease are provided by support groups.
* FIRST Skin Foundation (Foundation for Ichthyosis and Related Skin Disorders, Colmar, Pennsylvania). Ichthyosis refers to a group of skin disorders characterised by dry, scaly or thickened skin (mostly inherited, including DD).

== History ==
Darier&#x27;s disease was first described by the French dermatologist Ferdinand-Jean Darier in the journal &quot;Annales de dermatologie et de syphilographie&quot;. Darier was a well-regarded dermatologist of the time who was the head of the medical department at the Hôpital Saint-Louis. Darier was an early proponent of histopathology, or the examination of samples of diseased flesh under a microscope to determine the cause of illnesses. Using this technique, he was able to uncover the origins of Darier&#x27;s disease and a host of others that also bear his name.

James Clarke White, a dermatologist at Harvard Medical School, independently characterized and published his observations on this dermatological disorder in the same year as Darier (1889), which is why DD is sometimes referred to as Darier-White disease.

=== Court case ===
In Singapore, a man escaped the death penalty for murder as a result of Darier&#x27;s disease. Ong Teng Siew, a Malaysian chicken slaughterer aged 27, was charged with murdering an 82-year-old opium addict Ng Gee Seh in December 1995. Ong was sentenced to death in August 1996 after the trial court found him guilty of murder, and while he was appealing against his conviction, Ong was hospitalized in September 1996 for an outbreak of Darier&#x27;s disease, which had previously went undiagnosed. After his lawyer discovered that the disease had a causal link to psychiatric disorders, this new evidence enabled Ong to successfully apply for a re-trial. The court accepted the new evidence and that Ong was suffering from diminished responsibility as a result of Darier&#x27;s disease, and therefore he was found guilty of a lesser offence of manslaughter and was re-sentenced to life imprisonment.

<text>Anant Pai (17 September 1929 – 24 February 2011), popularly known as Uncle Pai, was an Indian educationalist and a pioneer in Indian comics. He is most famous as the creator of two comic book series viz. &quot;Amar Chitra Katha&quot;, which retold traditional Indian folk tales, mythological stories, and biographies of historical characters; and &quot;Tinkle&quot;, a children&#x27;s anthology.

==Early life and education==
Pai was born in Karkala, in what was the erstwhile Madras Presidency of British India on 17 September 1929 to a Konkani-speaking Goud Saraswat Brahmin couple, Venkataraya and Susheela Pai. He lost both his parents at the age of two. He was then brought up by his maternal grandfather until his death in 1944 after which he moved to Bombay (now Mumbai), where he studied in Orient School, Mahim. He pursued his higher education in chemistry, physics and chemical engineering at the Institute of Chemical Technology (formerly UDCT) and was a dual degree holder from the University of Bombay.

==Professional career==
Endowed with a passion for publishing and comics, his failed attempt at creating a children&#x27;s magazine (Manav, 1954) was followed by a career as a junior executive in &quot;The Times of India&quot; books division, putting him in the thick of affairs when &quot;Indrajal Comics&quot;, which was famous for publishing comic book series like &quot;Mandrake&quot; and &quot;The Phantom&quot;, was launched by the Times Group.

The idea behind starting a comic book series devoted to Indian culture and history came to Pai from a quiz contest aired on &quot;Doordarshan&quot; in February 1967, in which participants could easily answer questions pertaining to Greek mythology, but were unable to reply to the question &quot;In the Ramayana, who was Rama&#x27;s mother?&quot;

He left his job at &quot;The Times of India&quot; the very same year and started &quot;Amar Chitra Katha&quot;, a comic-book series which retold traditional Indian folk tales, Hindu mythology and biographies of historical persons, with the help of late G. L. Mirchandani of &quot;India Book House&quot;, when most other publishers from &quot;Allied Publishers&quot; to &quot;Jaico&quot; had rejected the concept. He took on the role of writer, editor and publisher. The series went on to become a publishing milestone for the Indian comic book scene, selling over 86 million copies of about 440 titles.

In 1969, Pai founded &quot;Rang Rekha Features&quot;, India&#x27;s first comic and cartoon syndicate. In November 1980, he started &quot;Tinkle&quot; under this syndicate. It is a children&#x27;s anthology of short stories, jokes and educational articles in comic-book format. &quot;Tinkle&quot; too replicated the success of &quot;Amar Chitra Katha&quot;, with the magazine currently in its 669th issue as in June 2017. Pai&#x27;s involvement with the above, and the personal rapport he shared with his readers earned him the title &quot;Uncle Pai&quot;. In 1989, again through this syndicate, Pai launched &quot;Chimpu Comics&quot;, which included his own works like &quot;Ramu and Shamu&quot;, &quot;Kapish&quot;, &quot;Little Raji&quot; and &quot;Fact Fantasy&quot;. This venture failed to repeat the success of &quot;Amar Chitra Katha&quot; and &quot;Tinkle&quot; and eventually its publication was stopped. Pai remained managing director of &quot;Rang Rekha Features&quot; until 2000, when he sold it to a Hyderabad-based animation studio named &quot;Color Chips&quot;.

Besides comics, Pai was also a specialist in personality development. He founded the &quot;Partha Institute of Personality Development&quot; in August 1978, which conducted personality development classes through correspondence for children and teenagers.

==Works==
===Comics===
Under &quot;Rang Rekha Features&quot;, Pai created a large number of comic strips such as &quot;Ramu and Shamu&quot;, &quot;Kapish&quot;, &quot;Little Raji&quot;, and &quot;Rekha&quot; along with one-off short stories in comic format. Most of these continue to appear in newspapers and magazines. He also created educational strips such as &quot;Fact Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Funland&quot; and &quot;Funtime&quot;.

===Video===
Pai has written and produced two video films, &quot;Ekam Sat&quot; (the Vedic Concept of God) and &quot;The Secret of Success&quot;, in both English and Hindi.

===Miscellaneous===
Pai&#x27;s other works include a number of books on personality development for children and teenagers such as &quot;How To Develop Self-confidence&quot; &quot;How to Achieve Success&quot;, &quot;How To Develop A Super Memory&quot; and audio books like certain titles of &quot;Amar Chitra Katha&quot; in audio book format and &quot;Storytime with Uncle Pai&quot;, where he plays the role of narrator-storyteller.

==Awards and recognitions==
*&quot;Lifetime Achievement Award – at the First Indian Comic Convention, New Delhi on 19 Feb 2011 (six days before his death) was given by Pran, Creator of Chacha Chaudhury&quot;
*&quot;Karpoorchand Puraskar of Uttar Pradesh Bal Kalyan Sansthan (1994)&quot;
*&quot;Yudhvir Memorial Award in Hyderabad (1996)&quot;
*&quot;Maharashtra Rajya Hindi Sahitya Academy Award (1996)&quot;
*&quot;Dr. T. M. A. Pai Memorial Award in Manipal (1997)&quot;
*&quot;University of Bombay Department of Chemical Technology&#x27;s Distinguished Alumnus Award (1999)&quot;
*&quot;Millennium Konkani Sammelan Award, Illinois, USA (2000)&quot;
*&quot;Raja Rammohan Roy Library Foundation&#x27;s Award (2001)&quot;
*&quot;Priyadarshni Academy Award (2002)&quot;
*&quot;Vishwa Saraswat Sammaan (2003)&quot;

===Google Doodle===
Google&#x27;s international and India search pages honoured Pai with a comic-style doodle of him on 17 September 2011, the 82nd birth anniversary of Pai. The doodle featured Pai sitting in his office, surrounded by shelves full of his own creations. Two such pictures, one in which Uncle Pai is sitting and the other in which he is standing, form the doodle, with the writing of &quot;Google&quot; connecting the two.

===Amar Chitra Katha Biography===
On 18 February 2012, &quot;ACK Media&quot;, a Mumbai-based edutainment company which had been managing &quot;Amar Chitra Katha&quot; and &quot;Tinkle&quot; since 2007, released an &quot;Amar Chitra Katha&quot; title on Anant Pai, which was scripted by Gayathri Chandrasekaran, assistant editor of &quot;Tinkle&quot;, and illustrated by Dilip Kadam, who had illustrated many of &quot;Amar Chitra Katha&#x27;s&quot; most famous titles.

In 1961, at the age of 31, Pai married Lalita, who was 20 at the time. She later died in 2015 four years after his own demise in 2011. The couple was childless. He resided in an apartment in Prabhadevi, Mumbai.

==Death==
Anant Pai died of a heart attack on the evening of 24 February 2011. He had been recovering from hip surgery which was necessitated following his falling down from the stairs a week prior to his death. His last rites were performed later that night at the Shivaji Park crematorium, Mumbai.

<text>In the anatomy of the brain, the centromedian nucleus, also known as the centrum medianum, (CM or Cm-Pf) is a nucleus in the posterior group of the intralaminar thalamic nuclei (ITN) in the thalamus. (This must not be confused with the central medial nucleus, which is in the anterior group of the ITN.) There are two centromedian nuclei arranged bilaterally.

In humans, each centromedian nucleus contains about 2200 neurons per cubic millimetre and has a volume of about 310 cubic millimetres with 664,000 neurons in total. It measures less than 10 millimetres in every dimension. It belongs to the caudal intralaminar group of thalamic nuclei and is situated within the medial thalamus. It is bordered superiorly by the mediodorsal nucleus, medially by the parafascicular nucleus, and posteriorly by the pulvinar.

==Input and output==
It sends nerve fibres to the subthalamic nucleus and putamen. It receives nerve fibres from the cerebral cortex, vestibular nuclei, globus pallidus, superior colliculus, reticular formation, and spinothalamic tract.

==Function==
Its physiological role involves attention and arousal, including control of the level of cortical activity. Some frequencies of extracellular electrical stimulation of the centromedian nucleus can cause absence seizures (temporary loss of consciousness) although electrical stimulation can be of therapeutic use in intractable epilepsy and Tourette&#x27;s syndrome. Specifically, the centromedian nucleus has been proposed as a target for neuromodulation-based treatment of generalized epilepsy.

General anaesthetics specifically suppress activity in the ITN, including the centromedian nucleus. Complete bilateral lesions of the centromedian nucleus can lead to states normally associated with brain death such as coma, death, persistent vegetative state, forms of mutism and severe delirium. Unilateral lesions can lead to unilateral thalamic neglect. (See hemispatial neglect.)

A patient with electrodes implanted into more than 50 different regions in his brain (including regions giving him orgasmic feelings) chose to self stimulate the electrode in his centromedian nucleus more than all other electrodes. The patient&#x27;s explanation of this: &quot;The subject reported that he was almost able to recall a memory during this stimulation, but he could not quite grasp it. The frequent selfstimulations were an endeavor to bring this elusive memory into clear focus.&quot;

<doc id="1013680" wikidata="Q625561" url="?curid=1013680" title="Evaluation Assurance Level">
<text>The Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL1 through EAL7) of an IT product or system is a numerical grade assigned following the completion of a Common Criteria security evaluation, an international standard in effect since 1999. The increasing assurance levels reflect added assurance requirements that must be met to achieve Common Criteria certification. The intent of the higher levels is to provide higher confidence that the system&#x27;s principal security features are reliably implemented. The EAL level does not measure the security of the system itself, it simply states at what level the system was tested.

To achieve a particular EAL, the computer system must meet specific &quot;assurance requirements&quot;. Most of these requirements involve design documentation, design analysis, functional testing, or penetration testing. The higher EALs involve more detailed documentation, analysis, and testing than the lower ones. Achieving a higher EAL certification generally costs more money and takes more time than achieving a lower one. The EAL number assigned to a certified system indicates that the system completed all requirements for that level.

Although every product and system must fulfill the same &quot;assurance&quot; requirements to achieve a particular level, they do not have to fulfill the same &quot;functional&quot; requirements. The functional features for each certified product are established in the &quot;Security Target&quot; document tailored for that product&#x27;s evaluation. Therefore, a product with a higher EAL is not necessarily &quot;more secure&quot; in a particular application than one with a lower EAL, since they may have very different lists of functional features in their Security Targets. A product&#x27;s fitness for a particular security application depends on how well the features listed in the product&#x27;s Security Target fulfill the application&#x27;s security requirements. If the Security Targets for two products both contain the necessary security features, then the higher EAL &quot;should&quot; indicate the more trustworthy product for that application.

== Assurance levels ==

=== EAL1: Functionally Tested ===

EAL1 is applicable where some confidence in correct operation is required, but the
threats to security are not viewed as serious. It will be of value where independent
assurance is required support the contention that due care has been exercised with
respect to the protection of personal or similar information.
EAL1 provides an evaluation of the TOE (Target of Evaluation) as made available to the customer, including
independent testing against a specification, and an examination of the guidance
documentation provided. It is intended that an EAL1 evaluation could be successfully
conducted without assistance from the developer of the TOE, and for minimal cost. An
evaluation at this level should provide evidence that the TOE functions in a manner
consistent with its documentation, and that it provides useful protection against
identified threats.

=== EAL2: Structurally Tested ===

EAL2 requires the cooperation of the developer in terms of the delivery of design
information and test results, but should not demand more effort on the part of the
developer than is consistent with good commercial practice. As such it should not
require a substantially increased investment of cost or time.
EAL2 is therefore applicable in those circumstances where developers or users require a
low to moderate level of independently assured security in the absence of ready
availability of the complete development record. Such a situation may arise when
securing legacy systems.

=== EAL3: Methodically Tested and Checked ===

EAL3 permits a conscientious developer to gain maximum assurance from positive
security engineering at the design stage without substantial alteration of existing sound
development practices.
EAL3 is applicable in those circumstances where developers or users require a moderate
level of independently assured security, and require a thorough investigation of the TOE
and its development without substantial re-engineering.

=== EAL4: Methodically Designed, Tested and Reviewed ===

EAL4 permits a developer to gain maximum assurance from positive security engineering based on good commercial development practices which, though rigorous, do not require substantial specialist knowledge, skills, and other resources. EAL4 is the highest level at which it is likely to be economically feasible to retrofit to an existing product line. EAL4 is therefore applicable in those circumstances where developers or users require a moderate to high level of independently assured security in conventional commodity TOEs and are prepared to incur additional security-specific engineering costs.

Commercial operating systems that provide conventional, user-based security features are typically evaluated at EAL4. Examples with expired Certificate are AIX, HP-UX, Oracle Linux, NetWare, Solaris, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 9, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, Windows 2000 Service Pack 3, Windows 2003, Windows XP, Windows Vista, 
Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, z/OS version 2.1 and z/VM version 6.3.

Operating systems that provide multilevel security are evaluated at a minimum of EAL4. Examples with active Certificate include SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 (EAL 4+). Examples with expired Certificate are Trusted Solaris, Solaris 10 Release 11/06 Trusted Extensions, an early version of the XTS-400, VMware ESXi version 4.1, 3.5, 4.0, AIX 4.3, AIX 5L, AIX 6, AIX7, Red Hat 6.2 &amp; SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 (EAL 4+). vSphere 5.5 Update 2 did not achieve EAL4+ level it was an EAL2+ and certified on June 30, 2015.

=== EAL5: Semiformally Designed and Tested ===

EAL5 permits a developer to gain maximum assurance from security engineering based
upon rigorous commercial development practices supported by moderate application of
specialist security engineering techniques. Such a TOE will probably be designed and
developed with the intent of achieving EAL5 assurance. It is likely that the additional
costs attributable to the EAL5 requirements, relative to rigorous development without
the application of specialized techniques, will not be large.
EAL5 is therefore applicable in those circumstances where developers or users require a
high level of independently assured security in a planned development and require a
rigorous development approach without incurring unreasonable costs attributable to
specialist security engineering techniques.

Numerous smart card devices have been evaluated at EAL5, as have multilevel secure devices such as the Tenix Interactive Link. XTS-400 (STOP 6) is a general-purpose operating system which has been evaluated at EAL5 augmented.

LPAR on IBM System z is EAL5 Certified.

=== EAL6: Semiformally Verified Design and Tested ===

EAL6 permits developers to gain high assurance from application of security
engineering techniques to a rigorous development environment in order to produce a
premium TOE for protecting high-value assets against significant risks.
EAL6 is therefore applicable to the development of security TOEs for application in
high risk situations where the value of the protected assets justifies the additional costs.

Green Hills Software&#x27;s INTEGRITY-178B RTOS has been certified to EAL6 augmented.

=== EAL7: Formally Verified Design and Tested ===

EAL7 is applicable to the development of security TOEs for application in extremely high risk situations and/or where the high value of the assets justifies the higher costs.

Practical application of EAL7 is currently limited to TOEs with tightly focused security functionality that is amenable to extensive formal analysis.
The ProvenCore OS, developed by ProvenRun, has been certified to EAL7 in 2019 by the ANSSI. The Tenix Interactive Link &quot;Data Diode Device&quot; and the Fox-IT &quot;Fox Data Diode&quot; (one-way data communications device) claimed to have been evaluated at EAL7 augmented (EAL7+).

== Implications of assurance levels ==

Technically speaking, a higher EAL means nothing more, or less, than that the evaluation completed a more stringent set of quality assurance requirements. It is often assumed that a system that achieves a higher EAL will provide its security features more reliably (and the required third-party analysis and testing performed by security experts is reasonable evidence in this direction), but there is little or no published evidence to support that assumption.

=== Impact on cost and schedule ===

In 2006, the US Government Accountability Office published a report on Common Criteria evaluations that summarized a range of costs and schedules reported for evaluations performed at levels EAL2 through EAL4.

In the mid to late 1990s, vendors reported spending US$1 million and even US$2.5 million on evaluations comparable to EAL4. There have been no published reports of the cost of the various Microsoft Windows security evaluations.

=== Augmentation of EAL requirements ===

In some cases, the evaluation may be &quot;augmented&quot; to include assurance requirements beyond the minimum required for a particular EAL. Officially this is indicated by following the EAL number with the word augmented and usually with a list of codes to indicate the additional requirements. As shorthand, vendors will often simply add a &quot;plus&quot; sign (as in EAL4+) to indicate the augmented requirements.

=== EAL notation ===

The Common Criteria standards denote EALs as shown in this article: the prefix &quot;EAL&quot; concatenated with a digit 1 through 7 (Examples: EAL1, EAL3, EAL5). In practice, some countries place a space between the prefix and the digit (EAL 1, EAL 3, EAL 5). The use of a plus sign to indicate augmentation is an informal shorthand used by product vendors (EAL4+ or EAL 4+).

<text>Émilie Marie Bouchaud (14 May 1874 – 14 October 1939), better known by her stage name Polaire, was a French singer and actress, who became internationally known. She performed also in the United States and London, and in films. 

She was notable for her wasp waist which, achieved through corsetry, reportedly measured less than 16 inches (41 cm). She was also known for her eccentric stage presence, which generated mixed receptions.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Émilie Marie Bouchaud was born in Agha, Algiers, French Algeria on 14 May 1874; according to her memoirs she was one of eleven children. Only four – Émilie, her two brothers Edmond and Marcel, and a sister, Lucile – survived infancy. Their father died of typhoid fever when Émilie was five. Their widowed mother, unable to support the four children, temporarily placed 
them with their grandmother in Algiers. Bouchaud&#x27;s brother Marcel died shortly after.

In 1889, after their mother began a relationship with a man named Emmanuel Borgia, she took her children with her when she moved with him to Paris. There her mother found work, and also tried to find domestic employment for her eldest daughter. Eventually however, after her sister Lucile fell sick and died, Émilie was sent back to her grandmother in Algiers.

Borgia, her mother, and Edmond, the only surviving sibling, remained in Paris. Émilie was unhappy and in September 1890 ran away to rejoin her mother in France. Afraid of meeting her mother&#x27;s partner, Borgia (whom she accuses in her memoirs of having tried to molest her), she first approached her brother Edmond. 

He had already gained some fame as a café-concert singer under the name of &#x27;Dufleuve&#x27;. With his help Bouchard at about age 17 auditioned successfully for her first job as a café singer.

===Career===

Polaire&#x27;s career in the entertainment industry stretched from the early 1890s to the mid-1930s, and encompassed the range from music-hall singer to stage and film actress. Her most successful period professionally was from the mid-1890s to the beginning of the Great War (First World War).

Adopting the stage name &quot;Polaire&quot; (&quot;Pole Star&quot;), she worked first as a music-hall singer and dancer. One of her earliest hits was performing the French version of &quot;Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay&quot;. Having quickly made a name for herself – artist Toulouse-Lautrec portrayed her on a magazine cover in 1895 – Polaire briefly visited New York, appearing there as a &quot;chanteuse&quot; at various venues, but without achieving major success. 

On her return to Paris, she extended her range and gained acting roles in serious theatre. Her first major appearance was in 1902, at the Théâtre des Bouffes Parisiens, in the title role of a play based on Colette&#x27;s &quot;Claudine à Paris&quot;. A comedic actress, Polaire became one of the major celebrities of her day. Later, as cinema developed, she appeared in several films.

In 1909, Polaire was cast in her first silent-film role in &quot;Moines et guerriers&quot; (Monks and Warriors). In 1910 she returned to the stage, appearing in London and later in New York. (1910 was the date of her first visit as a celebrity to the U.S.; publicity releases did not mention her earlier appearances in 1895.) In 1912, back in France, she was offered a role in a film by the up-and-coming young director Maurice Tourneur. She appeared in six of his films in 1912 and 1913. After returning to the musical stage, she sailed back to the US for a second tour. 

Crossing the Atlantic again, she returned to London to perform at the Coliseum Theatre. In 1915 Polaire made frequent appearances in London, and was involved in wartime fund-raising efforts. She returned to films in 1922 but, in the declining years of her career, had to be content with lesser roles.

Her precise filmography is difficult to determine due to confusion between her and a younger Italian actress with the screen name &quot;Pauline Polaire&quot;, who also featured in early films. Her last film appearance was in 1935 in &quot;Arènes joyeuses&quot;, directed by Karl Anton.

===Appearance===
Polaire was skilled in using her appearance to attract attention. In her early days as a café singer in the 1890s, she wore very short skirts and also cropped her hair, fashions that did not become common in the rest of society until the 1920s. A brunette, she wore unusually heavy eye makeup, deliberately evocative of the Arab world. At a time when tightlacing among women was in vogue, she was famous for her tiny, corsetted waist, which was reported to have a circumference no greater than . That accentuated her large bust, which was said to measure . She stood tall. Her striking appearance, both on and off stage, contributed to her celebrity.

For her 1910 supposed &quot;debut&quot; in New York, she provocatively allowed herself to be billed in the advance publicity as &quot;the ugliest woman in the world&quot;. When departing on a transatlantic liner, she was apparently accompanied by a &quot;black slave&quot;. 

Returning to America in 1913, she brought a diamond-collared pet pig, Mimi, and wore a nose-ring. Talk of her figure and her lavish overdressing in fur coats and dazzling jewels preceded her appearances wherever she went. Jean Lorrain said of her:

She was a frequent subject for artists; those who painted her include Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Antonio de La Gandara, Leonetto Cappiello, Rupert Carabin, Mme. Dreyfus Gonzales and Jean Sala.

===Death===
Polaire&#x27;s finances suffered from a series of actions by the French tax authorities, and she struggled to find stage or screen roles as she aged. She may have suffered from depression.

She died on 14 October 1939, aged 65, in Champigny-sur-Marne, Val-de-Marne, France. Her body was buried at the Cimetière du Centre, in the eastern Paris suburb of Champigny-sur-Marne.

<text>Crookhaven () is a village in County Cork, Ireland, on the most southwestern tip of the island of Ireland. With an out-of-season population of about sixty, it swells in the summer season to about four hundred, when the occupants of the seasonal holiday homes arrive.

==History==
The village name is attributed to an association with the Crooke family, and initially with Sir Thomas Crooke, 1st Baronet who also founded Baltimore, County Cork about 1610. The Crooke family were granted large estates in west Cork in the early 17th century, but their association with the area ended around 1665, on the death of Sir Thomas&#x27;s son and heir Sir Samuel. In the late 1500s and early 1600s the village was used as a base for piracy - where not only the local justices (including the vice-admiral of Munster) but the broader population were involved. These activities were unaffected by official discouragement under King James VI and I, but the Dutch attack on Crookhaven in 1614 did significant damage and English piracy in the region declined thereafter.

The village was an important port of call for shipping between Europe and the United States, and many inhabitants were in the business of supplying the ships as they sheltered in Crookhaven after or before a long voyage. In 1959 Crookhaven was the subject of a film by English film maker James Clarke in his film &quot;Irish Village&quot;. At that time the film records the population of the town and local farms as being 69.

Crookhaven was also used by Guglielmo Marconi as a location for experiments in wireless communication and ship-to-shore communication. Some of these tests and experiments took place between the Fastnet lighthouse, Crookhaven, and Cape Clear Island - since they were so closely connected. The area was useful for these purposes as a fixed telegraph line also connected Crookhaven and Cape Clear Island - located eight miles away. Marconi worked here from 1901 until 1914 when he sold the rights. The station was ultimately destroyed in 1922.

==Amenities==
The village has three pubs and also has a shop and post office.

As with certain other amenities, the Crookhaven Harbour Sailing Club also only opens in the summer.

==Places of interest==
The road to the village comes from Goleen and curves around the harbour. As one drives from Goleen, one passes a road to the left leading onto Rock Island. Originally this was the site of a coast guard station - which replaced an earlier station to its south. The &quot;new&quot; station was occupied from 1907 until 1921. During the Irish War of Independence, British forces were stationed there to protect the station and nearby signal station at Brow Head. In August 1920, the IRA raided the Brow Head station and it was subsequently destroyed. Also on Rock Island was a fishery plant. From here most of the shellfish of Ireland was exported to Europe. The ponds were open until the late 1970s, then it became a food processing plant packaging garlic butter and mussels - but since fell derelict.

==Transport &amp; communications==
The village is located in south-western Ireland, from Cork and from Dublin. The nearest airport to Crookhaven is Cork Airport, and the regional road R591 ends in the village. Crookhaven has no scheduled public transport.

==Notable people==
Jeremiah Coghlan, naval captain in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, &quot;an officer almost unrivaled in heroic exploits&quot;.

<doc id="1013711" wikidata="Q1247288" url="?curid=1013711" title="Vesre">
<text>Vesre (from Spanish &quot;(al) revés&quot; &#x27;reverse&#x27;) is the reversing of the order of syllables within a word in Spanish. It is a feature of Rioplatense Spanish slang and Tango lyrics, and is associated with lunfardo.

Vesre is mostly from Buenos Aires, and other cities in Argentina have their own customs. Rosario has its &quot;Rosarigasino&quot; method for obfuscating words, and Córdoba has an entirely different set of colloquial conventions. Yet, most Argentines and Uruguayans have been exposed to vesre through tango lyrics or the media.

Even though vesre has spread to other countries, and can be heard in Peru, Chile and Ecuador, Spanish speakers outside the Río de la Plata area are usually less inclined to use it. Popular speech has created some instances; for example, natives of Barranquilla, Colombia often call their city &quot;Curramba&quot;, in a stylized form of vesre.

When the syllables of the noun are switched, the original gender - masculine or feminine - is kept; e.g., &quot;un café -&gt; un feca&quot;

==Examples==
Examples include: 
*revés → vesre (reverse; backwards). &quot;verre&quot; is much more commonly used in Argentina, as in: &quot;Nosotros hablamos al vesre, ¿viste? (&quot;We speak wardsback, see?&quot;)
*café → feca (coffee) e.g., &quot;¿Querés un feca?&quot; (Would you like some coffee?&quot;)
*caballo → llobaca (horse)
*botella → llatebo (bottle)
*pelo → lope (hair)
*leche → chele (milk, used primarily to refer to semen)
*libro → broli (book) e.g., (usually plural) &quot;¡Che, agarrá los brolis más seguido!&quot; (Dude, get the books and learn something!)
*amigo → gomía (friend) e.g., &quot;¡Eh!, ¡¿qué hacés gomía?!&quot; (Hey! How goes it, my friend?!)
*doctor → tordo (doctor, usually meaning &quot;physician&quot; but also used for lawyers. &quot;Tordo&quot; is also the name in Argentina of the opportunistic shiny cowbird).
*carne → nerca (meat, not to be confused with &quot;merca&quot;)
*pizza → zapi (&quot;Zapi&quot; even became the name of a pizza chain)
*maestro → troesma (master)

Occasionally, vesre is a stepping-stone towards further obfuscation, achieved by evolving into a longer word. For example:

*coche (car) → checo → checonato (after a once-famous sportsman named Cecconatto)
*cinco (the number five) → cocín → cocinero (literally &quot;cook&quot;; used mostly on the racetrack to mean &quot;the five horse&quot;)

The original and &quot;vesre&quot; versions of a word are not always synonyms; sometimes the reversal adds some extra nuance to the meaning. For instance, the word &quot;hotel&quot; bears the same meaning as in English (i.e. a normal tourist hotel), whereas &quot;telo&quot; implies that the establishment is actually a love hotel.

These reversed words are only spoken; rarely found in writing.

==In other languages==

* Colloquial French has a form of intentional metathesis known as verlan.
* Greek has Podaná with the same morphological construction.
* Serbian has a form of slang called Šatrovački followed in the 1990s with a more ambiguous slang called utrovački.
* Romanian has Totoiana with a similar morphological construction, spoken in the village of Totoi.
* Italian has &quot;riocontra&quot; featuring inversion of syllables, spoken in Milan and &quot;trancorio&quot;, spoken in the Mompiano neighborhood of Brescia.
* English has Pig Latin, with a similar morphological construction, moving the first consonant to the end of the word and following in with the suffix &quot;-ay&quot;.

<text>Ronneby is a locality and the seat of Ronneby Municipality in Blekinge County, Sweden with 12,029 inhabitants in 2010.

Ronneby is regarded as the heart of &quot;the Garden of Sweden&quot;, and in 2005 the park &quot;Brunnsparken&quot; in Ronneby was voted Sweden&#x27;s most beautiful park. 2006 the park was voted Europe&#x27;s 4th most beautiful park. The church &quot;Heliga Kors kyrka&quot; was founded in the 12th century, modified and extended until the 15th century, and badly damaged during Northern Seven Years&#x27; War in the 16th century.

==History==
The city&#x27;s oldest surviving city privileges are from 1387. The first recorded spelling of the name (around the year 1300) is &quot;Rotnæby&quot;, &quot;the village upon the roaring (river)&quot;, so named because of the rapids on the spot. In the Middle Ages, Ronneby was an important trading and shipping town.

In 1564, Ronneby was the location of a bloody battle during the Northern Seven Years&#x27; War between the Swedish and the Danish armies during which the Swedes under King Erik XIV besieged the city, killed many inhabitants (Ronneby Bloodbath) and burnt it to the ground. Erik later reported that &quot;The Water was red from blood of the Danes.&quot; The number of victims was heavily exaggerated, for different propagandistic reasons, by both sides.

Following the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658, whereby Blekinge and other southern provinces became Swedish, a navy base was built in Karlskrona – east of Ronneby – which accordingly was granted city rights, while revoking the city rights of Ronneby.

But Ronneby did attract some industries in the 18th century. Besides the industry, it also hosted the Ronneby spa, with water believed to have healing qualities. The park around the spa can still be visited. The first source of chalybeate (ferruginous) water was found in May 1705. But the high period of the spa was in the 19th century.

After a fire in 1864, Ronneby was rebuilt according to a check pattern, which is still the model of today. Ronneby finally regained its city title in 1882. From 1971 it is the seat of the larger Ronneby Municipality.

In the 1970s, the local diving club discovered a shipwreck off the coast of Ronneby that was eventually identified by archaeologists as &quot;Gribshunden&quot;, a 15th-century Danish warship. The shipwreck is significant as one of the best-preserved wreckages from the early modern period.

==Arms==

Ronneby did use a coat of arms with the letter R between a star and a crescent at least since 1542. In 1882, the arms were redesigned, with the R substituted with the Ronnebyå River. The same coat of arms is used today by the municipality.

== Images ==

==Education==
* Knut Hahn Secondary School, a school aimed primarily at students in their late teens. It was completely renovated in 2004, at a cost of well over 100 million SEK (roughly US$16 million). It is funded and run by the Ronneby Municipality. It features most of the national programmes, teaching arts, science, industrial work and economics among many other subjects. It has about 700 students. 
*Blekinge Institute of Technology (moved to Karlskrona in August 2010)

Ronneby also has many schools for lower ages, all run by the municipality save for a secondary school which is run by a company, called Thoren Framtid.

==Climate==
Ronneby has an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;), similar to most of Southern Sweden. The climate is very similar to neighbouring city Karlshamn, but has a somewhat higher rainfall and cooler nights throughout the year at the site located inside the premises of the local airport.

==Sports==
These are two of the more prominent sports clubs in Ronneby:
*Ronneby BK, association football
*Fredriksbergs BK, bandy

==Notable residents==
* Josefina Wettergrund (1830–1903), writer
* Messiah Marcolin, vocalist best known for his work in the Swedish doom metal band Candlemass

<doc id="1013717" wikidata="Q992768" url="?curid=1013717" title="Chéticamp, Nova Scotia">
<text>Chéticamp (; ) is an unincorporated town on the Cabot Trail on the west coast of Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, Canada. It is a local service centre. A majority of the population are Acadians. Together with its smaller neighbour, Saint-Joseph-du-Moine, Chéticamp makes up the largest Francophone enclave on Cape Breton Island. The 2006 population was 3,039 people.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Chéticamp&quot; derives from the name given by the Mi&#x27;kmaq First Nations, who still live on Cape Breton Island (but not in Chéticamp). The name is &quot;Awjátúj&quot; (Francis-Smith orthography) in the Micmac language, meaning &quot;rarely full&quot;, presumably making reference to the mouth of Chéticamp harbour that once had a large dune that grew during low tide.

The French spelling of the town&#x27;s name went through several variations including &quot;Ochatisia&quot; (1660), &quot;Ochatis&quot; (1689), &quot;Chetecqan&quot; (1689 Pierre Detcheverry map of the Gulf of St Lawrence for Governor Antoine Parat) &quot;Chétican&quot;, &quot;Chéticamps&quot; (1725) and &quot;Chétifcamp&quot; (1803). The current spelling appeared for the first time on 3 May 1815, in the writings of the missionary Antoine Manseau. In French, the name has been pronounced successively &quot;Le Chady, Le Grand Chady, Le Chady Grand, Île de Chedegan&quot; and finally, the current version, &quot;Chatican&quot; (). Chéticamp is usually pronounced phonetically in French outside of the area.

The name does not always take the acute accent on the &quot;e&quot; in English (i.e., &quot;Cheticamp&quot;).

A village in western Nova Scotia, Saint Alphonse de Clare, was originally called Chéticamp de Clare. Its name was changed to avoid confusion for postal delivery.

== History ==
Chéticamp was a fishing station used during the summer months by Charles Robin, a merchant from the island of Jersey, and is considered one of the Acadian capitals of the world. In the years following the Great Expulsion, many Acadians came to this area. The first permanent settlers following that era were the families of Pierre Bois and Joseph Richard, who arrived in 1782, although both brothers John and Paul Chiasson along with many other French settlers like the AuCoin family were believed to have predated Bois, Richard and Robin by over 100 years. Chiasson is looked at today as the oldest family name on record in the town. Many of the original family names still reside in and around the small town. They, like all the original founding family names of Chéticamp, can be found chiseled in stone in the town still to this day. Settlement was formally established in 1785 by a grant of land to the 14 original settlers. Today Chéticamp, which is at the entrance of the Cape Breton Highlands National Park, is a popular tourist spot.

==Geography==

Chéticamp is at the western entrance to Cape Breton Highlands National Park which contains the Acadian Trail. The downtown area overlooks a harbour that is protected from the Gulf of Saint Lawrence by Chéticamp Island. The Chéticamp River flows into the Gulf of St. Lawrence approximately 5 km northeast of the village.

===Climate===

Chéticamp experiences a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;). Temperature and precipitation patterns are greatly influenced by the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and Cape Breton Highlands. The highest temperature ever recorded in Chéticamp was on 10 August 2001. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 27 January 1994.

== Economy ==
Apart from an important gypsum mine which operated off and on until the Second World War, the main industry in Chéticamp historically has been fishing. As ground fish quotas have declined, tourism has taken on more importance and is one of the two largest industries at this time along with the shellfish fisheries, lobster and crab.

The tourism industry is based on culture and the scenery found in the coastal village at the entrance of Cape Breton&#x27;s national park. Chéticamp has also marketed its traditional rug hookers (&quot;tapis hookers&quot;), Acadian music and food. Activities for visitors include whale watching, hiking, swimming, cross country skiing, golfing, snowmobiling, cultural events and festivals and photography. They also host an International Dance Festival, and La fête nationale de l&#x27;Acadie (August 15).

==Tourist attractions==
The local beach named St. Peter&#x27;s Beach gives the locals as well as tourists a place for swimming, camping, and other recreational activities. There are a great deal of accommodations for visitors and hospitality is a trademark.

The Northern Inverness Recreational Association also manages the local golf course, Le Portage, which is considered part of &quot;Cape Breton&#x27;s Fabulous Foursome&quot; and is renowned for the beautiful views and challenging course.

Chéticamp extends itself for four kilometres along the Cabot Trail. One kilometre northeast is Petit Étang, then further east is La Prairie. South of La Prairie is Le Platin and Belle-Marche. Even further south is Pointe-à-la-Croix (Point Cross). From Main street Chéticamp, you can view the typical Chéticamp houses. Saint Peter&#x27;s is unique and rich in Acadian history.

The Université Sainte-Anne has a campus in Saint-Joseph-du-Moine.

<doc id="1013718" wikidata="Q7302254" url="?curid=1013718" title="RecQ helicase">
<text>RecQ helicase is a family of helicase enzymes initially found in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; that has been shown to be important in genome maintenance. They function through catalyzing the reaction ATP + H2O → ADP + P and thus driving the unwinding of paired DNA and translocating in the 3&#x27; to 5&#x27; direction. These enzymes can also drive the reaction NTP + H2O → NDP + P to drive the unwinding of either DNA or RNA.

==Function==
In prokaryotes RecQ is necessary for plasmid recombination and DNA repair from UV-light, free radicals, and alkylating agents. This protein can also reverse damage from replication errors. In eukaryotes, replication does not proceed normally in the absence of RecQ proteins, which also function in aging, silencing, recombination and DNA repair.

==Structure==
RecQ family members share three regions of conserved protein sequence referred to as the:
* N-terminal – Helicase
* middle – RecQ-conserved (RecQ-Ct) and
* C-terminal – Helicase-and-RNase-D C-terminal (HRDC) domains.

The removal of the N-terminal residues (Helicase and, RecQ-Ct domains) impairs both helicase and ATPase activity but has no effect on the binding ability of RecQ implying that the N-terminus functions as the catalytic end. Truncations of the C-terminus (HRDC domain) compromise the binding ability of RecQ but not the catalytic function. The importance of RecQ in cellular functions is exemplified by human diseases, which all lead to genomic instability and a predisposition to cancer.

==Clinical significance==

There are at least five human RecQ genes; and mutations in three human RecQ genes are implicated in heritable human diseases: &quot;WRN&quot; gene in Werner syndrome (WS), &quot;BLM&quot; gene in Bloom syndrome (BS), and &quot;RECQL4&quot; in Rothmund–Thomson syndrome. These syndromes are characterized by premature aging, and can give rise to the diseases of cancer, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, and atherosclerosis, which are commonly found in old age. These diseases are associated with high incidence of chromosomal abnormalities, including chromosome breaks, complex rearrangements, deletions and translocations, site specific mutations, and in particular sister chromatid exchanges (more common in BS) that are believed to be caused by a high level of somatic recombination.

==Mechanism==

The proper function of RecQ helicases requires the specific interaction with topoisomerase III (Top 3). Top 3 changes the topological status of DNA by binding and cleaving single stranded DNA and passing either a single stranded or a double stranded DNA segment through the transient break and finally re-ligating the break. The interaction of RecQ helicase with topoisomerase III at the N-terminal region is involved in the suppression of spontaneous and damage induced recombination and the absence of this interaction results in a lethal or very severe phenotype. The emerging picture clearly is that RecQ helicases in concert with Top 3 are involved in maintaining genomic stability and integrity by controlling recombination events, and repairing DNA damage in the G2-phase of the cell cycle. The importance of RecQ for genomic integrity is exemplified by the diseases that arise as a consequence of mutations or malfunctions in RecQ helicases; thus it is crucial that RecQ is present and functional to ensure proper human growth and development.

===WRN helicase===

The Werner syndrome ATP-dependent helicase (WRN helicase) is unusual among RecQ DNA family helicases in having an additional exonuclease activity. WRN interacts with DNA-PKcs and the Ku protein complex. This observation, combined with evidence that WRN deficient cells produce extensive deletions at sites of joining of non-homologous DNA ends, suggests a role for WRN protein in the DNA repair process of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). WRN also physically interacts with the major NHEJ factor X4L4 (XRCC4-DNA ligase 4 complex). X4L4 stimulates WRN exonuclease activity that likely facilitates DNA end processing prior to final ligation by X4L4.

WRN also appears to play a role in resolving recombination intermediate structures during homologous recombinational repair (HRR) of DNA double-strand breaks.

WRN participates in a complex with RAD51, RAD54, RAD54B and ATR proteins in carrying out the recombination step during inter-strand DNA cross-link repair.

Evidence was presented that WRN plays a direct role in the repair of methylation induced DNA damage. The process likely involves the helicase and exonuclease activities of WRN that operate together with DNA polymerase beta in long patch base excision repair.

WRN was found to have a specific role in preventing or repairing DNA damages resulting from chronic oxidative stress, particularly in slowly replicating cells. This finding suggested that WRN may be important in dealing with oxidative DNA damages that underlie normal aging (see DNA damage theory of aging).

===BLM helicase===

Cells from humans with Bloom syndrome are sensitive to DNA damaging agents such as UV and methyl methanesulfonate indicating deficient DNA repair capability.

The budding yeast &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; encodes an ortholog of the Bloom syndrome (BLM) protein that is designated Sgs1 (Small growth suppressor 1). Sgs1(BLM) is a helicase that functions in homologous recombinational repair of DNA double-strand breaks. The Sgs1(BLM) helicase appears to be a central regulator of most of the recombination events that occur during &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; meiosis. During normal meiosis Sgs1(BLM) is responsible for directing recombination towards the alternate formation of either early non-crossovers or Holliday junction joint molecules, the latter being subsequently resolved as crossovers.

In the plant &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;, homologs of the Sgs1(BLM) helicase act as major barriers to meiotic crossover formation. These helicases are thought to displace the invading strand allowing its annealing with the other 3&#x27;overhang end of the double-strand break, leading to non-crossover recombinant formation by a process called synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) (see Wikipedia article &quot;Genetic recombination&quot;). It is estimated that only about 5% of double-strand breaks are repaired by crossover recombination. Sequela-Arnaud et al. suggested that crossover numbers are restricted because of the long-term costs of crossover recombination, that is, the breaking up of favorable genetic combinations of alleles built up by past natural selection.

===RECQL4 helicase===

In humans, individuals with Rothmund–Thomson syndrome, and carrying the RECQL4 germline mutation, have several clinical features of accelerated aging. These features include atrophic skin and pigment changes, alopecia, osteopenia, cataracts and an increased incidence of cancer. RECQL4 mutant mice also show features of accelerated aging.

RECQL4 has a crucial role in DNA end resection that is the initial step required for homologous recombination (HR)-dependent double-strand break repair. When RECQL4 is depleted, HR-mediated repair and 5&#x27; end resection are severely reduced &quot;in vivo&quot;. RECQL4 also appears to be necessary for other forms of DNA repair including non-homologous end joining, nucleotide excision repair and base excision repair. The association of deficient RECQL4 mediated DNA repair with accelerated aging is consistent with the DNA damage theory of aging.

<text>Thomas Walter Hampson (born June 28, 1955) is an American lyric baritone, a classical singer who has appeared world-wide in major opera houses and concert halls and made over 170 musical recordings.

Hampson&#x27;s operatic repertoire spans a range of more than 80 roles, including the title roles in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot; and &quot;Il barbiere di Siviglia&quot;, Thomas&#x27; &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;. The center of his Verdi repertoire remains Posa in &quot;Don Carlo&quot;, Germont in &quot;La traviata&quot;, the title roles in &quot;Macbeth&quot; and &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot;, and more recently also Amfortas in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Parsifal&quot; and Scarpia in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot;.

As a recitalist Hampson has won worldwide recognition for his thoughtfully researched and creatively constructed programs that explore the rich repertoire of song in a wide range of styles, languages, and periods. He is one of the most important interpreters of German Romantic song – especially known for his interpretations of the music of Gustav Mahler – and, with his &quot;Song of America&quot; project collaboration with the Library of Congress, has become known as the &quot;ambassador&quot; of American song.

Hampson&#x27;s diverse and expansive discography has earned him an Edison Award for Lifetime Achievement, four Edison Awards, four Echo prizes, numerous VEB Deutsche Schallplatten, Gramophone Awards, and Grand Prix du Disque, as well as six Grammy Award nominations, and one Grammy Award. Vienna Acoustics, an Austrian music company, named one of their speakers &quot;The Hampson Edition.&quot;

Dame Elisabeth Schwarzkopf once said of her student, &quot;[Thomas Hampson is] the best singer in Europe right now.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Born in Elkhart, Indiana, Hampson has two older sisters, with whom he sang in church as a child. He grew up in Spokane, Washington, where he enrolled at Eastern Washington State College (now Eastern Washington University) in Cheney, majoring in political science/government. Concurrently, Hampson earned a BFA in Voice Performance at Fort Wright College under the tutelage of Sister Marietta Coyle. During the summers of 1978 and 1979, he studied under Gwendolyn Koldowsky and Martial Singher at the Music Academy of the West, where he won the Lotte Lehmann Award. He then continued his studies at the University of Southern California Thornton School of Music, where he worked with vocal coach Jack Metz and the baritone Horst Günter, a lifelong mentor. In 1980, as a consequence of winning the San Francisco Opera audition, he competed in the Merola Opera Program, in which he met Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. In 1981, he was one of the winners in the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions national finals.

==Early career==
An audition tour in Europe in the early 1980s brought him a contract with the Deutsche Oper am Rhein in Düsseldorf, as well as the opportunity to study with Dame Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, whom he had met at the Merola program. In his three years as a member of the Düsseldorf ensemble (1981–84), he honed his stage experience with a number of smaller roles, but also had bigger assignments, both in Düsseldorf and elsewhere. He sang the title role in Henze&#x27;s &quot;Der Prinz von Homburg&quot; in Darmstadt, and Guglielmo, in a Jonathan Miller production of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; at the Opera Theatre of Saint Louis, which brought him significant attention in the United States.

In 1984, he began an engagement at the Opernhaus Zürich as a principal lyric baritone, among others participating in the legendary Harnoncourt-Ponnelle Mozart cycle, including all of the Da Ponte operas and the title role of the famed 1987 production of &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. Engagements during this time also included those with companies in Hamburg, Cologne, and Vienna, and his 1984 London recital debut at Wigmore Hall.

His U.S. recital debut occurred April 14, 1986 at The Town Hall in New York, where &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised him for &quot;good looks, a commanding stage presence and, even within the confines of the recital format, an apparently vivid theatricality...&quot;. Shortly after, he made his Metropolitan Opera debut on October 9, 1986 as the Count in &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot;. In 1986, he was invited to audition for Leonard Bernstein, which led to Hampson&#x27;s participation in the 1987 semi-staged performance of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot; in Rome, led by Bernstein, and, soon after, their legendary performances with the Vienna Philharmonic of Gustav Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Kindertotenlieder&quot; (1988), &quot;Rückert-Lieder&quot; (1990) and &quot;Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen&quot; (1990). From this point forward, he was recognized as &quot;among the leading lyric baritones of the late century.&quot;

==1990s==
The next years brought performances in many of the world&#x27;s most important concert venues (including Avery Fisher Hall, Barbican Centre, Carnegie Hall, Concertgebouw, Royal Albert Hall, Théâtre du Châtelet), opera houses (including Lyric Opera of Chicago, Metropolitan Opera, Paris Opera, Royal Opera House Covent Garden, San Francisco Opera, Vienna State Opera) and festivals (Mostly Mozart Festival, Maggio Musicale, the Salzburg Festival), where Hampson performed with some of the world&#x27;s most renowned pianists (incl. John Browning, Geoffrey Parsons, Wolfram Rieger, Craig Rutenberg, Wolfgang Sawallisch), orchestras (incl. Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Houston Symphony, New York Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, San Francisco Symphony, Orchestra dell&#x27;Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome, Spokane Symphony, Staatskapelle Berlin, UBS Verbier Orchestra) and conductors (incl. Daniel Barenboim, Christoph Eschenbach, Daniele Gatti, Vladimir Jurowski, James Levine, Fabio Luisi, Kurt Masur, Zubin Mehta, Seiji Ozawa, Antonio Pappano, Michael Tilson Thomas, and Franz Welser-Möst).

In 1990, Hampson released his first solo recital album on Teldec titled &quot;Des Knaben Wunderhorn&quot;, in collaboration with Geoffrey Parsons. The piano used for the recording had belonged to Mahler himself. &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the recording, saying that &quot;the performances have a luminous beauty and cast a storyteller&#x27;s spell.&quot; In February and March of the same year, Hampson continued his partnership with Bernstein, first in a widely appreciated performance of Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Rückert-Lieder&quot; and &quot;Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen&quot;, and then for his Carnegie Hall debut, performing Mahler&#x27;s two cycles with the Vienna Philharmonic (Bernstein&#x27;s last public performances in the venue). In November, he made his San Francisco Opera debut, performing the title role in Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;Il ritorno d&#x27;Ulisse in patria&quot; and role debut as Don Giovanni at the Metropolitan Opera.

In 1991, Hampson opened the New York Philharmonic season in a Live from Lincoln Center telecast, singing Aaron Copland&#x27;s &quot;Old American Songs&quot; in a performance conducted by Kurt Masur. He also sang in the 25th Anniversary Gala of the Metropolitan Opera, which was recorded live for video/CDV. The same year, he released a Cole Porter tribute album on EMI/Angel.

In 1992, he was named the Musical America&#x27;s Singer of the Year, alongside John Corigliano, Robert Shaw, Christoph von Dohnányi, and Yo-Yo Ma. The year included many notable performances, including: the Rossini 200th birthday gala at Avery Fisher Hall, the title role in Britten&#x27;s &quot;Billy Budd&quot; at the Met, the Count in &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; at Florence&#x27;s Maggio Musicale conducted by Zubin Mehta, Brahms&#x27; &quot;Ein deutsches Requiem&quot; with Daniel Barenboim at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and two performances of Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Dichterliebe&quot;: one in Geneva and the other in his first recital at Carnegie Hall.

Hampson began 1993 by performing his first rendition of the title character in Thomas&#x27; &quot;Hamlet&quot; in Monte Carlo. The performance was subsequently recorded for EMI/Angel. That year, he continued to add to his repertoire with performances including &quot;Il barbiere di Siviglia&quot; at The Royal Opera House, Covent Garden and the Met, his debut in the role of Posa in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Don Carlo&quot; in Zürich, the title role in Henze&#x27;s &quot;Der Prinz von Homburg&quot;, and Chorebe in &quot;Les Troyens&quot; by Berlioz at the Metropolitan Opera. 1993 also saw the beginning of Hampson&#x27;s institutional involvement in the classical world, when he gave a series of master classes at the Tanglewood Festival in Lenox, Massachusetts. He was also awarded an honorary doctorate of music in his hometown of Spokane, Washington from Whitworth College that same year, and took a large role in the publication of a new critical edition of Mahler songs, alongside which he released a recording in collaboration with Geoffrey Parsons.

In January 1994, Hampson made his debut with the Houston Symphony Orchestra, singing Mahler and Copland, and conducted by Christoph Eschenbach. Later that month he was named Male Singer of the Year by the International Classical Music Awards. He then embarked on a five-month tour that led him to over twenty cities, featuring recitals debuts in Reutlingen, State College, Washington, D.C., Iowa City, Fort Worth, Quebec, and Buffalo, New York. In July, he opened the Mostly Mozart Festival in a telecast Live from Lincoln Center, and then in August he performed at the Salzburg Festival with a solo recital of Barber and Mahler. In September, he sang the leading role in the world premiere of the Conrad Susa and Philip Littell&#x27;s opera, &quot;The Dangerous Liaisons&quot; and then in October recorded the &quot;20 Lieder und Gesänge&quot; based on his and Dr. Renate Hilmar-Voit&#x27;s research.

In 1995, Hampson received two awards for his contribution to classical music: the Cannes Classical Music Award for Singer of the Year in 1994, and the Echo Music Prize for Best Male Singer. That year, he went on to perform in a number of significant productions, including &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; at Carnegie Hall under the baton of James Levine, a Live from Lincoln Center telecast with Kathleen Battle, a performance of Britten&#x27;s &quot;War Requiem&quot; in Rome conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch, a recital of all of Gustav Mahler&#x27;s songs (Hampson&#x27;s new critical edition) for the Mahler Festival at Concertgebouw, and another engagement with Sawallisch and the Philadelphia Orchestra at the Academy of Music.

Hampson began to develop his interest in American Song in 1996, first with his January performance at a Gala benefit for WNET and next with the &quot;I Hear America Singing: Great Performances&quot; project, shot in May. In February 1996, President Bill Clinton extended Hampson&#x27;s first invitation to sing at the White House during a state dinner honoring French President Jacques Chirac. Additionally, he was inducted as an Honorary Member of the Royal Academy of Music in London in June. Other important appearances of Hampson&#x27;s in 1996 include a series of master classes at the Mozarteum University of Salzburg, and two productions of &quot;Don Carlos&quot; in the original French (directed by Luc Bondy), one in Paris and one in London.

In April 1997, he made his first performance as Eugene Onegin in Tchaikovsky&#x27;s opera of the same name at the Vienna State Opera, and in May he reunited with Harnoncourt for a rare production of Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Alfonso und Estrella&quot; at Theater an der Wien in Vienna. Hampson also cemented his role as an American musical fixture, first by serving as Artistic Director, Creative Consultant, and Performer on the PBS production &quot;Thomas Hampson: I Hear America Singing,&quot; and next by winning EMI&#x27;s Artist of the Year Award. He also made his first appearance as Riccardo in Bellini&#x27;s &quot;I puritani&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera, his performance being hailed as &quot;the most serious &quot;bel canto&quot; effort&quot; by the Metropolitan Opera Guild. In October he débuted yet another role: Antonio in Donizetti&#x27;s rarely performed &quot;Linda di Chamounix&quot; at the Vienna State Opera.

Hampson began 1998 with the world premiere of Richard Danielpour&#x27;s &quot;Elegies in Jacksonville, Florida&quot; and later reprised the role at Carnegie Hall. In February he teamed up with Jerry Hadley, Cheryl Studer, and Craig Rutenberg to perform &quot;I Hear America Singing&quot; at the Barbican Centre in London. Late in the year, Hampson found himself engaged at the Vienna State Opera once more, this time debuting the title role of Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot;.

Early 1999 saw Hampson back at the Metropolitan Opera, this time in the title role in the baritone version of Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Werther&quot;, alongside Susan Graham. In April he performed with soprano Renée Fleming at the White House for a gala. In July, he made yet another role debut: Wolfram in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;, a role that would later win him the 2002 Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording. In August he made another debut in Busoni&#x27;s &quot;Doktor Faust&quot;.

==2000s==
In early 2000, Hampson returned to his fascination with Gustav Mahler, performing a Mahler-centric recital at Carnegie Hall in February. He also reprised his performance in &quot;Doktor Faust&quot; at the Met. That year, he served as a member of the Artistic Committee for the Kennedy Center Honors and sang at the Centennial Celebration for Elinor Remick Warren at the Washington National Cathedral. Appearing again with Renée Fleming, Hampson also put out a recording of Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Thaïs&quot; late in the year.

In February 2001, he sang Amfortas in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Parsifal&quot; at the Paris Opera and the Royal Opera House in London, took a four-month recital tour across Europe and the U.S., performing with Vladimir Jurowski and Franz Welser-Möst.

2002 bore a number of role débuts, including an April performance as Mandryka in &quot;Arabella&quot; by Richard Strauss at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris alongside Karita Mattila, another as the title role in the world premiere of Friedrich Cerha&#x27;s &quot;Der Riese vom Steinfeld&quot; in June, and then two performances in October: one as the title role in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot; at the Vienna State Opera under the baton of Daniele Gatti and the direction of Peter Stein, and one in the world premiere of Wolfgang Rihm&#x27;s &quot;Sechs Gedichte von Friedrich Nietzsche&quot; in Cologne. Finally, in December, he made his first stage appearance in the role of Athanael in &quot;Thaïs&quot; at the Lyric Opera of Chicago.

In 2003, Hampson performed in a recital dedicated to the works of composer Hugo Wolf, first in February at Carnegie Hall (appearing with pianist/conductor Daniel Barenboim) and then at the Salzburg Festival in a piece titled &quot;The Hugo Wolf Project&quot;, created by Hampson and featuring a number of his famous contemporaries. That year, he also reprised his roles in &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; and &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, and sang an arrangement of the poem &quot;Dover Beach&quot; with the Emerson String Quartet. Later that year, he also appeared with the Vienna Philharmonic in a performance of Friedrich Cerha&#x27;s &quot;Baal-Gesänge&quot; under Zubin Mehta.

Hampson returned to the Metropolitan Opera in 2004 to sing the title role in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, directed by Marthe Keller. He reprised this role again on in the Japan tour of the Vienna State Opera under the baton of Seiji Ozawa. He also appeared in &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; once more, directed by Otto Schenk and conducted by Mark Elder. That year, he also began a collaboration with the Library of Congress that led to the creation of the Hampsong Foundation.

He debuted in &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; and another performance at the 2005 Salzburg Festival, this time as Germont in &quot;La traviata&quot;. That year, he also launched his website, www.thomashampson.com. Finally, Hampson&#x27;s collaboration with the Library of Congress then led him on a 12-city concert tour that extended through summer 2006.

In 2006, in a collaboration between the Heidelberger Frühling Festival and the Hampsong Foundation, the 200th anniversary of the printing of &quot;Des Knaben Wunderhorn&quot; was celebrated in concerts, symposium, and master classes. That year was also the 50th anniversary of the Vienna State Opera&#x27;s reopening, and Hampson was invited to sing at a gala in the venue&#x27;s honor. Hampson also sang at the Salzburg Festival once more, this time in honor of Mozart&#x27;s 250th Birthday. The year&#x27;s performances included the title role in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;, the title role in &quot;Doktor Faust&quot; once more and Mandryka in a new production of &quot;Arabella&quot;.

In 2007, Hampson returned to &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot; at the Met. In May, he performed with the San Francisco Symphony at Carnegie Hall, to great praise.

In 2008, Hampson appeared as Carlo in a revival of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Ernani&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera. He also took once more to the role of Athanael in Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Thaïs&quot;, again opposite Renée Fleming and sang at the opening nights of both the Metropolitan Opera and Carnegie Hall. Both performances were broadcast worldwide. In June, Hampson seized control of his media output and established his own independent record label, Thomas Hampson Media (THM), re-releasing six albums through iTunes.

In 2009, as part of the Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s 125th Anniversary celebration, Hampson sang the last scene of &quot;Parsifal&quot; with tenor Plácido Domingo. In February, he performed in the world premiere of Michael Daugherty&#x27;s &quot;Letters From Lincoln&quot; with the Spokane Symphony and then as the title role in &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; at the Met. In March, he made his role début as Scarpia in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot; at the Zürich Opera. In May, he held a recital at the Supreme Court of the United States. Starting in September of that year, Hampson became the New York Philharmonic&#x27;s first Artist-in-Residence. In November, Hampson launched www.songofamerica.net, an interactive database that details the culture and history of American Song and re-embarked on his &quot;Song of America&quot; tour, holding 13 recitals between July 2009 and February 2010.

==2010s==
In addition to his performance schedule, much of Hampson&#x27;s modern career has centered on music scholarship and education. As such, in March 2010 he spearheaded the first-ever live streaming classical music available on a mobile app: a master class on Mahler songs, hosted by the Manhattan School of Music&#x27;s Distance Learning Program. That year, he performed in the composer John Adams&#x27;s 19-minute musical monologue, &quot;The Wound-Dresser&quot;. He also appeared in a trouble-ridden production of &quot;La traviata&quot; that year, under the baton of Leonard Slatkin, who later removed himself from the production.

Also in 2010, Hampson was elected into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

In 2011, Hampson sang the role of Rick Rescorla in the world premiere of Christopher Theofanidis&#x27; &quot;Heart of a Soldier&quot; with the San Francisco Opera, based on a true story from 9/11. Hampson continued activities in the Mahler community, performing in over 50 concerts of Mahler&#x27;s music in 2011 in honor of the centennial of Mahler&#x27;s death. That year also saw the debut of the &quot;Song of America&quot; radio series, co-produced by the Hampsong Foundation and the WFMT Radio Network of Chicago. Hosted by Hampson, the series consists of 13 hour-long programs exploring the history of American culture through song; it has aired in more than 200 U.S. markets.

Hampson&#x27;s 2012 engagements included role debuts as Iago in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot; and the title role in Hindemith&#x27;s &quot;Mathis der Maler&quot;, both at Zurich Opera, and his house debut as Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera. Among other season highlights include concerts with the National Symphony Orchestra and Christoph Eschenbach, the Munich Philharmonic and Zubin Mehta, the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Gustavo Dudamel, the Pittsburgh Symphony and Manfred Honeck and the Israel Philharmonic and Zubin Mehta. He was featured in CNN&#x27;s &quot;Fusion Journeys&quot; series, which filmed him in South Africa in a musical exchange with Ladysmith Black Mambazo. In 2013, he recorded Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot; for Decca Classics, with costars Kristine Opolais and Joseph Calleja. That same year, he was inducted into the Gramophone Hall of Fame.

He received an Honorary Doctor of Music degree from New England Conservatory in 2015, the same year that he premiered a new work by Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Jennifer Higdon at Carnegie Hall. In 2016, Hampson added another role to his operatic repertoire with the world premiere of Miroslav Srnka&#x27;s &quot;South Pole&quot; at the Bavarian State Opera. He starred as Roald Amundsen, opposite tenor Rolando Villazón as Robert Falcon Scott, in the real-life story of the Antarctic explorers&#x27; race to reach the South Pole. In 2017, he was awarded the Hugo-Wolf-Medaille alongside Wolfram Rieger, for their outstanding achievements in the art of song interpretation.

==2020s==
Hampson received the 2020 Heidelberger Frühling Music Award.

==Personal life==
Hampson is married to Andrea Herberstein, and has 3 step-children from her. He has one daughter, Meghan, from his first marriage, which ended in divorce in 1986. His eldest daughter Catherine is married to singer Luca Pisaroni, to whom she was introduced by her father. Having settled in Vienna long-term, Hampson later began dividing his time between New York City and Zürich.

==Teaching and scholarship==

In addition to his performance schedule, much of Hampson&#x27;s modern career has centered on music scholarship and education. In 2007, he was instated as a member of the board of the Manhattan School of Music where he is also part of the Artistic Advisory Board, positions which allow him to frequently teach master classes for the school&#x27;s Distance Learning Program that are streamed live to Internet and smart phone users worldwide.

In March 2011, Hampson continued his dedication to song with the opening of the first Lied Academy as part of the Heidelberger Frühling Festival. Under the artistic direction of Hampson, and with the contribution of prominent visiting artists, such as Graham Johnson, Brigitte Fassbaender and Nikolaus Harnoncourt, the Academy each year transforms the German city into an international meeting point for the Lied.

<text>Bluem of Youth () is a Japanese pop group which achieved greatest success in the late 1990s after it was the subject of a reality television series called &quot;Susunu! Denpa Shōnen&quot;. The name is a mix of &quot;bloom of youth&quot; and &quot;blue&quot;. Its members are Yuji Bessho (別所悠二) and Hiroyuki Matsugashita (松ヶ下宏之). They went on permanent hiatus on New Year&#x27;s Eve of 2002, but played a 10th anniversary concert commemorating their debut in 2005.

The duo traveled across Russia by Trans-Siberian Railway for seven months from March to October 1999, for a Japanese television program called &quot;Susunu! Denpa Shōnen&quot;. Their career was at a crossroads due to poor sales and their contract with their record label was not renewed.

<text>My New Partner, also called Le Cop, is a 1984 French comedy film directed by Claude Zidi that stars Philippe Noiret and Thierry Lhermitte. Noiret plays a streetwise Paris policeman who takes kickbacks from the minor criminals on his beat to allow them to continue but is assigned an idealistic new partner fresh from training. His efforts to enmesh his colleague in the prevailing corruption succeed spectacularly.

The original French title is Les Ripoux, backslang for &quot;les pourris&quot; meaning &quot;the rotten ones&quot;. It won the César Award for Best Film in 1985 and was followed by two sequels: &quot;Ripoux contre Ripoux&quot; (1990) and &quot;Ripoux 3&quot; (2003).

==Plot==
René has spent 20 years policing a tough quarter of Paris. Passionate about betting on horses, his dream being to become an owner, he lives with Simone, a retired prostitute. He knows all the petty crooks on his patch and lets them earn a living in exchange for favours and information. When François, an idealistic young cop from the provinces, is assigned to work alongside him, he tries to teach the new man the facts of big city life. He also fixes him up with an expensive young prostitute, Natacha. 

Slowly, François&#x27; irritating high-mindedness is worn down, especially after he is beaten up by Natacha&#x27;s pimp. When the pair learn that a huge consignment of heroin is to be exchanged for cash, they decide to lift the money. The crooks give chase and François succeeds in getting away with the loot but René is caught by the pursuing police. Because his official record is glowing, he only gets two years in jail. Simone and Natacha greet him on release, and out of the morning mist François arrives with the racehorse he has bought for Réné.

<doc id="1013725" wikidata="Q307629" url="?curid=1013725" title="Abd Allah al-Mahdi Billah">
<text>Abū Muḥammad ʿAbd Allāh ibn al-Ḥusayn (; 31 July 874 – 4 March 934), better known by his regnal name al-Mahdī biʾllāh (, &quot;The Rightly Guided by God&quot;), was the founder of the Isma&#x27;ili Fatimid Caliphate, the only major Shi&#x27;a caliphate in Islamic history, and the eleventh Imam of the Isma&#x27;ili branch of Shi&#x27;ism.

He was born as Saʿīd ibn al-Ḥusayn () in Askar Mukram to a family that led the secret Isma&#x27;ili missionary network (), propagating on behalf of the hidden imam, Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il, who would return as the prophesied Islamic messiah (). Orphaned at a young age, he moved to Salamiya, the family&#x27;s base of operations, where he was adopted by his uncle. In the mid-890s Sa&#x27;id succeeded to the leadership of the expanding , which had expanded and gained adherents across the then Muslim world. However, his claims of not merely being a trustee of the hidden imam, but of him and his ancestors holding the imamate itself, led in 899 to a schism in the Isma&#x27;ili movement: those who did not recognize his claims split off to become the Qarmatians. The schism was followed by uprisings of pro-Isma&#x27;ili Bedouin in Syria in 902–903, launched without his consent by over-eager supporters, who aimed to force him to come forward as the . The Bedouin uprising was suppressed by the Abbasids, but drew the attention of the Abbasid Caliphate&#x27;s authorities to him, forcing him to abandon Salamiya, and flee first to Ramla, then Fustat in Egypt, and finally Sijilmasa in what is now Morocco. There he remained, living as a merchant, until one of his missionaries, Abu Abdallah al-Shi&#x27;i, at the head of the Kutama Berbers overthrew the Aghlabid dynasty of Ifriqiya in 909.

Proclaimed caliph and assuming power in Ifriqiya in January 910, he proclaimed his right to conquer the world in the name of God, but soon fell out with Abu Abdallah and other leading missionaries, who were disappointed that he was not the semi-divine they had been propagating for. Al-Mahdi was able to purge these dissidents, but had to overcome a series of revolts against his authority, either due to opposition to the exactions of the Kutama, the backbone of his power, or due to disillusionment of his followers with his failure to realise the Isma&#x27;ili millennialist promises. The state that al-Mahdi built, although underpinned by a messianic ideology, was otherwise conventionally organized, and relied heavily on the personnel of the previous Aghlabid regime and the swords of the Kutama. His expansionist aims achieved only moderate success: two invasions of Egypt were beaten back by the Abbasids, leaving only the Cyrenaica in his hands, while the war with the Byzantine Empire in southern Italy was characterized by raids for plunder and slaves, and did not result in any lasting successes. In the west, his repeated attempts to impose Fatimid rule over the unruly Berbers were challenged not only by Berber rivalries, but also by the Umayyads of al-Andalus, and only secured temporary success. In 921 he moved his court to the newly built fortified palace city of Mahdiya on the Tunisian coast, and spent the rest of his life there. After his death in 934, he was succeeded by his only son, al-Qa&#x27;im.

== Early life ==
=== Origin ===

The origin, identity and early history of the man who founded the Fatimid Caliphate is obscure, and even his name and the place and date of his birth are disputed. According to his official biography, he was born in Askar Mukram, in the Persian province of Khuzistan, on 31 July 874 (12 Shawwal 260 AH), or exactly one year earlier according to a different tradition. Other traditions report that he was born in Baghdad or Kufa in Iraq, or the town of Salamiya, on the western edge of the Syrian Desert. His original name most likely was Sa&#x27;id ibn al-Husayn, although in later life he insisted that is real name was Ali, and Sa&#x27;id was just a cover name. 

His father died in 881/2, and Sa&#x27;id was sent to be fostered by his uncle, Abu Ali Muhammad, also known as Abu&#x27;l-Shalaghlagh, at Salamiya. On his journey he was joined by Ja&#x27;far, a boy who was a few months older than Sa&#x27;id and had been reared with him by the same wet-nurse. He became a eunuch and Sa&#x27;id&#x27;s close confidant and chamberlain, and is one of the main sources about his life. A younger brother, known only as Abu Muhammad, did not follow Sa&#x27;id to Salamiya. 

=== Early Isma&#x27;ilism and Salamiya ===
Abu&#x27;l-Shalaghlagh and Sa&#x27;id lived the life of a wealthy merchant household, but in secret the family headed an underground political and religious movement, the Isma&#x27;ili (&#x27;invitation, calling&#x27;). This movement was part of the wider Imami branch of the Shi&#x27;a, which held that the leadership of the Muslim community was entrusted by God to a singular, divinely invested and guided imam (leader). The first such imam was Ali ibn Abi Talib, the son-in-law of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and fourth caliph, who according to the Shi&#x27;a had been designated as successor by Muhammad, only for this instruction to be ignored by the latter&#x27;s Companions, who chose Abu Bakr as caliph instead. Shi&#x27;a doctrine holds that the imamate was the birthright of Ali&#x27;s descendants via Fatima, Muhammad&#x27;s daughter. The Imamis hold that the existence of an imam at all times is a necessity for the world&#x27;s existence, as the imam is the proof of God, and has the sole authority and divine inspiration to interpret God&#x27;s revelation; indeed, the imam is considered to be infallible, at least in doctrinal matters. The Imamis especially held that the imamate was the preserve of the Husaynid line of the Alids, where it could only be passed in hereditary succession from father to son via an explicit act of designation () by the previous imam, a choice that is held to have been ordained by God. 

In 765, a succession conflict gave rise to the split of the Imami Shi&#x27;a, into Isma&#x27;ilis and Twelvers: the sixth imam, Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq, died without a clear successor. Al-Sadiq had most likely designated his second son, Isma&#x27;il—after whom the Isma&#x27;ilis are named—but according to most accounts, Isma&#x27;il predeceased his father. Some of al-Sadiq&#x27;s followers then held that the designation automatically passed on to Isma&#x27;il&#x27;s son, Muhammad, or even that al-Sadiq had designated his grandson while he lived, while others claimed that Isma&#x27;il himself was not dead and merely in hiding to escape persecution by the ruling Abbasid Caliphate. Most of al-Sadiq&#x27;s followers, however, followed Isma&#x27;il&#x27;s younger brother, Musa al-Kazim, and his descendants, becoming the Twelver branch of Shi&#x27;ism. According to his followers, Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il fled the Hejaz and went into concealment (), to escape both Abbasid persecution as well as the hostility of his uncle&#x27;s supporters. He died sometime in Khuzistan, after which the fate of the Isma&#x27;ili movement is obscure, until it re-emerged in the late ninth century. 

During the second half of the ninth century, a wave of millennialist expectations spread in the Muslim world, coinciding with a deep crisis of the Abbasid Caliphate: the Anarchy at Samarra in the 860s, followed by the Zanj Rebellion, enfeebled the Abbasid regime, allowing the rise of breakaway and autonomous regimes in the provinces. Belief in a messiah of Alid descent, the (&#x27;the Rightly Guided One&#x27;) or (&#x27;He Who Arises&#x27;), who would usher in the end times, was widespread in the early Islamic world. According to the various traditions heralding his coming, the would rapidly overthrow the Abbasid Caliphate and destroy their capital Baghdad, restore the unity of the Muslims, conquer Constantinople (capital of the Byzantine Empire, the oldest non-Muslim antagonist of the early caliphates), ensure the final triumph of Islam and establish a reign of peace and justice. Thus the leader of the Zanj uprising claimed Alid descent, and proclaimed himself as the , the restorer of heavenly justice to those downtrodden and disenfranchised. As the historian Michael Brett comments, &quot;the Mahdist expectations [...] were focused upon the coming of a more and more mysterious, increasingly supernatural, ultimately eschatological figure in the form of a second Muhammad destined to complete the history of the world&quot;. For the Isma&#x27;ilis, the expected was none other than their hidden imam, Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il.

While the imam remained hidden, however, he was represented towards his followers by an agent, living proof of the imam&#x27;s existence, the (). That was the role claimed, according to later sources, by Sa&#x27;id&#x27;s great-grandfather, Abdallah al-Akbar. Leaving his native Askar Mukram, after some wanderings Abdallah al-Akbar had settled in Salamiya, from where he and his successors directed the growth of the . According to later Isma&#x27;ili tradition and the reconstruction of modern scholars, Abdallah al-Akbar was in turn succeeded in 827/8 by his son Ahmad, followed by Ahmad&#x27;s son, Abu&#x27;l-Shalaghlagh. It is possible, however, that the origins of the Salamiya-based movement were far more recent than that, and that it had come about only following the start of the anti-Alid and anti-Shi&#x27;a policies adopted by the Abbasids under Caliph al-Mutawakkil (). These policies led not only to a series of Alid/Shi&#x27;a uprisings in the decades that followed, but also the increasing persecution of the Twelver imams until the disappearance and supposed &quot;occultation&quot; of the last Twelver imam in 874. It is exactly this period which saw the Isma&#x27;ili message of the imminent return of Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il as the gain traction, aided by dissatisfaction among the Twelver adherents with the political quietism of their leadership, and above all the vacuum left by the occultation, that removed a visible and accessible imam as a source of loyalty and religious guidance.
Despite its activity, this stage of the Isma&#x27;ili movement is scarcely covered in later Isma&#x27;ili sources, and most of what happened in the last decades of the ninth century, culminating in the &quot;Qarmatian schism&quot; of 899, has been reconstructed and elaborated by a succession of modern scholars—chiefly Vladimir Ivanov, Samuel Miklos Stern, Wilferd Madelung, and Heinz Halm—using mostly anti-Fatimid polemic works. According to this version, Isma&#x27;ili s, led by Hamdan Qarmat and his brother-in-law Abdan, spread their network of agents to the area around Kufa in the late 870s, and from there to Persia and Khurasan, while a particularly important role was played by Yemen, whence the Isma&#x27;ili agent Ibn Hawshab sent missionaries to Sindh (al-Haytham, 883/84), Bahrayn (Abu Sa&#x27;id al-Jannabi, 899), and Ifriqiya (Abu Abdallah al-Shi&#x27;i, 893). 

In medieval sources as well as modern accounts building on them, all this activity is attributed to a single unified movement, a &quot;secret revolutionary organization carrying on intensive missionary efforts in many regions of the Muslim world&quot; according to Wilferd Madelung. This was the movement headed by Abu&#x27;l-Shalaghlagh at Salamiya. The true head of this movement remained hidden even from the senior missionaries, and a certain Fayruz functioned as chief missionary () and &#x27;gateway&#x27; () to the hidden leader. Brett however cautions that this &quot;grand conspiracy theory of Fatimid origins&quot; reflects mostly the bias of later sources, pro-Fatimid as well as anti-Fatimid, and that it obscures a reality of multiple, separately evolving millennarian movements that existed at the time, and whose political or doctrinal relation to one another is now difficult to reconstruct. According to Brett, the movement at Salamiya was one of many, and only after the establishment of the Fatimid Caliphate were these movements united into a single coherent network, retrospectively, by Fatimid and anti-Fatimid propaganda alike. Indeed modern scholars point out the existence of independent strands of Isma&#x27;ili thought in the eastern regions of the Islamic world, propagated by missionaries like Abu Hatim al-Razi (d. 934/5) in Adharbayjan and Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Nasafi (d. 943) in Khurasan; it was only later, during the second half of the 10th century, that some of these Isma&#x27;ili communities were reconciled to Fatimid leadership, with the official Fatimid doctrine coming to incorporate many of their teachings.

=== Leadership of the Isma&#x27;ili and the Qarmatian schism ===
Abu&#x27;l-Shalaghlagh did not have heirs, as his son and grandchild had reportedly been captured and imprisoned by the Abbasids. Sa&#x27;id was thus designated as his successor, and given his uncle&#x27;s daughter in marriage. Sa&#x27;id&#x27;s only child, Abd al-Rahman, the future caliph al-Qa&#x27;im bi-Amr Allah, was born in March or April 893. His brother, Abu Muhammad, apparently went to Taleqan in the Daylam, a region where already Abdallah al-Akbar had lived and preached for a while. 

The eunuch Ja&#x27;far reports that Abu&#x27;l-Shalaghlagh—perhaps encouraged by the rapid progress of the , which was now establishing armed strongholds in preparation of the &#x27;s arrival—secretly declared himself to a few senior members of the not as the for Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il, but the actual imam; and that he claimed for his nephew Sa&#x27;id the title of , and for the latter&#x27;s infant son Abd al-Rahman the title of . This claim was taken up by Sa&#x27;id when he succeeded his uncle, although later Fatimid doctrine insisted that Sa&#x27;id&#x27;s father, al-Husayn, had been a hidden imam in succession to Ahmad ibn Abdallah al-Akbar, rather than Abu&#x27;l-Shalaghlagh; the latter in turn is accused in these works of trying to usurp the position of Sa&#x27;id. Various genealogies were later put forth by the Fatimids and their followers to justify their claim to the imamate, generating a heated controversy that lasts until the present day. In the most common version, Abdallah al-Akbar was proclaimed to be the son of Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il, but even in pro-Isma&#x27;ili sources, the succession line and names of the hidden imams who supposedly preceded Sa&#x27;id are not the same, partly due to the Isma&#x27;ili practice of using codenames and hiding their identity () to avoid persecution. Anti-Isma&#x27;ili Sunni and Twelver Shi&#x27;a sources naturally rejected the claim of Fatimid descent from Ali ibn Abi Talib altogether and considered them as impostors, some even claiming they were of Jewish descent. The situation is further complicated by the use of the title , until then a synonym for the , for Sa&#x27;id&#x27;s son. This has led to claims, already in medieval times, that whereas Abd al-Rahman was a genuine imam, Sa&#x27;id descended from a line of s and was neither Abd al-Rahman&#x27;s father nor a legitimate imam, but merely a usurping steward.

Abu&#x27;l-Shalaghlagh died sometime after 893, and Sa&#x27;id became the head of the . In 899, the letters being sent to the senior missionaries from Salamiya revealed changes in the official doctrine of the movement. This worried Hamdan Qarmat, who sent his brother-in-law to Salamiya to investigate the matter. It was only there that Abdan learned of the new claim: that the hidden imam was not Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il, as commonly believed, but Sa&#x27;id. Upon learning of this, Hamdan denounced the leadership in Salamiya, gathered the Iraqi s and ordered them to cease the missionary effort. Shortly after he disappeared from his headquarters, and Abdan was assassinated at the instigation of Zakarawayh ibn Mihrawayh, who had apparently remained loyal to Salamiya. These events caused a major split in the Isma&#x27;ili movement, between those who recognized Sa&#x27;id&#x27;s claims to the imamate and those who rejected them. The latter are generally known today by the term &quot;Qarmatians&quot;, although the original connotation of the name is unclear, and was also applied by non-Isma&#x27;ili authors to the supporters of the Fatimids as well. The Isma&#x27;ili communities that adhered to the Qarmatian view represented mostly the eastern Islamic world: Iraq, Bahrayn and northern Persia around Rayy, while the communities in Yemen, Sindh, Ifriqiya and possibly Khurasan remained loyal to Salamiya.

=== Bedouin uprising and flight to Ramla ===

After his role in the murder of Abdan, Zakarawayh ibn Mihrawayh escaped from Iraq and resumed his missionary efforts among the Bedouin tribes of the eastern Syrian Desert, but with little success. His sons, al-Husayn and Yahya, however, succeeded in converting many members of the tribal group of the Banu Kalb in the northwestern Syrian Desert. Assuming the cover names of (&#x27;Man with the Mole&#x27;) and (&#x27;Master of the She-Camel&#x27;) respectively, they and their followers adopted the name (&#x27;Fatimids&#x27;) and rose in revolt in 902. It remains a matter of contention whether Zakarawayh and his sons were followers of Sa&#x27;id and acted in his name, as contended by Ivanov and Halm, or unrelated. The account of the contemporary Baghdadi official and historian al-Tabari knows nothing of the Isma&#x27;ili leadership at Salamiya, and provides a garbled account of the rebels&#x27; belief system, claiming that a certain Faraj ibn Uthman was their , while the 11th-century pro-Fatimid narrative of al-Naysaburi insists that the revolt was instigated by the three renegade sons of an Isma&#x27;ili . 

Whatever the truth, the uprising was apparently without the knowledge or authorization of Sa&#x27;id, although later Fatimid sources claim that Zakarawayh sent Sa&#x27;id&#x27;s brother to the Bedouin as the representative of the hidden imam and figurehead of the revolt. Indeed, the revolt, whether by over-eager followers or not, placed Sa&#x27;id in mortal danger, as it alerted the authorities to the danger posed by militant Isma&#x27;ilism and revealed the whereabouts of the leadership of the . It also led to the renewed direct Abbasid military involvement in Syria, which for the last thirty years had been ruled not by Baghdad, but by the autonomous Tulunid dynasty based in Fustat, in Egypt.

While the Bedouin scored their first successes against government troops, Sa&#x27;id was informed via pigeon post from his agents in Baghdad that the Abbasid governor of Salamiya had discovered his true identity. Under cover of night, Sa&#x27;id left the town, accompanied only by his son, the chief missionary Fayruz, and four slaves. The women of the household, including his mother and two daughters, as well as his niece, were left behind under the protection of the slave Su&#x27;luk. The group speedily went south. In three days they passed Homs, Tripoli, Damascus, and Tiberias, until they reached Ramla, where the local governor was secretly an Isma&#x27;ili initiate and could protect them. Sa&#x27;id and his party had escaped in the nick of time: in Damascus, the caliphal courier with his description and orders for his arrest arrived right after they had left the city, and another courier arrived at Ramla in the same evening that they settled there.

In the meantime, Zakarawayh&#x27;s sons had made for Salamiya to pay homage to their master, according to pro-Fatimid sources, or because the town had been settled with Hashemite families related to the Abbasid dynasty, as al-Tabari claims. According to the detailed accounts of pro-Fatimid sources, the two brothers initially held Abu Muhammad to be their imam, until the women of the household corrected them. Yahya went on to lay siege to Damascus, while al-Husayn reportedly went to Ramla to meet Sa&#x27;id. Although later Fatimid sources are at pains to disassociate Sa&#x27;id from the brothers&#x27; uprising, Sa&#x27;id at that time may have condoned their operations, and even ordered money to be paid to them. After the death of Yahya before Damascus in July 903, al-Husayn abandoned the siege and turned north. He captured Salamiya, Homs, and other towns, and, in the expectation that the would finally come forth, began to establish the institutions of a state: at the mint of Homs, coins were issued on behalf of the yet unnamed , and in the Friday sermon the name of the Abbasid caliph al-Muktafi was dropped in favour of the &quot;Successor, the rightly-guided Heir, the Lord of the Age, the Commander of the Faithful, the Mahdi&quot;. Encamped at Salamiya since August 903, the Bedouin apparently expected that Sa&#x27;id would return and announce himself. Despite repeated entreaties, however, Sa&#x27;id refused to leave the safety of Ramla. Al-Tabari preserves two letters, one sent to the shadowy and one from him, that were captured by Abbasid troops, in which the is named Abdallah ibn Ahmad ibn Abdallah. If this was indeed Sa&#x27;id, he thus had by this time assumed his eventual regnal name, while apparently omitting his father&#x27;s.

In the end, the Abbasid government sent an army under Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Katib, which on 29 November 903 routed the &#x27;Fatimid&#x27; Bedouin army at the Battle of Hama. Enraged about the apparent abandonment by the supposed divinely-guided imam, al-Husayn turned against him: the residence at Salamiya was destroyed, and all family members and servants encountered there executed. Sa&#x27;id&#x27;s women, however, were rescued by Sul&#x27;uk, who eventually brought them to rejoin his master upon the conquest of Ifriqiya. This atrocity, along with the failure of the uprising, led later Fatimid historians to try and excise Sa&#x27;id&#x27;s relationship with the sons of Zakarawayh in what the historian Heinz Halm calls an act of &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;. Al-Husayn himself was captured shortly after, and under torture revealed what he knew about the leader of the Isma&#x27;ili movement. Zakarawayh himself remained at large, and in 906 tried to revive the uprising in Iraq in a movement that, according to historian Farhad Daftary, now &quot;acquired the characteristics of dissident Qarmatism&quot;. This revolt too was defeated in 907 by Abbasid forces, and Zakarawayh was captured and died of his wounds shortly after.

=== Flight to Egypt and Sijilmasa ===
Once again, Sa&#x27;id and his entourage had to flee the Abbasid manhunt, making for Tulunid Egypt. Sa&#x27;id arrived in Fustat, the capital of Egypt, in early 904, and settled there in the house of a local convert, with the help of the local , Abu Ali. According to the generally considered reliable report of Ibn Hawqal, the latter was none other than Hamdan Qarmat, who had returned to Sa&#x27;id&#x27;s allegiance. Sa&#x27;id assumed the guise of a wealthy Hashemite merchant, but local authorities, warned by Baghdad, became suspicious. The loyal eunuch Ja&#x27;far was even questioned under torture, but revealed nothing. Sa&#x27;id remained in Fustat until January 905, when the Abbasid troops under Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Katib invaded Egypt and ended the Tulunid regime, bringing the province once again directly under Abbasid control.

To escape the Abbasids, Sa&#x27;id was once again forced to flee. His entourage apparently expected him to head to Yemen, where the missionaries Ibn Hawshab and Ibn al-Fadl had conquered most of the country in the name of the Isma&#x27;ili imam. Instead, Sa&#x27;id resolved to turn west to the Maghreb, much to the surprise and dismay of his followers: while Yemen was part of the civilized Arab world, the Maghreb was wild and uncultured, far from the centres of the Islamic world, politically fractured, and dominated by Berber tribes. Indeed, the chief missionary Fayruz abandoned his master and made for Yemen on his own. The reason for Sa&#x27;id&#x27;s choice is unknown, but the historian Wilferd Madelung suggests that he had doubts about Ibn al-Fadl&#x27;s loyalty; the latter would indeed eventually renounce his allegiance and declare himself to be the awaited . At the same time, however, the situation in the Maghreb was promising. The Abu Abdallah al-Shi&#x27;i had converted the Kutama Berbers to his cause, and by 905 had achieved some first victories against the autonomous Aghlabid dynasty that ruled Ifriqiya (modern Tunisia and eastern Algeria) under nominal Abbasid suzerainty. The later Fatimid apologist, Qadi al-Nu&#x27;man, insists that Abu Abdallah had already sent messengers to Salamiya inviting his master to the Maghreb, in an effort to make the decision appear foreordained; but as Halm and Brett have remarked, the episode throws light on the improvised manner in which Sa&#x27;id appears to have run his movement. 

Sending the trustworthy Ja&#x27;far back to Salamiya to dig up the treasures hidden there, Sa&#x27;id joined a merchant caravan going west, accompanied by Abu Abdallah&#x27;s brother, Abu&#x27;l-Abbas Muhammad. On the way, the caravan was attacked by Berber tribes, which left Abu&#x27;l-Abbas Muhammad wounded, and Sa&#x27;id&#x27;s library and many of his possessions in the hands of their attackers. The party made a stop at Tripoli, where they waited for Ja&#x27;far to join them with the recovered treasure. In the meantime, Abu&#x27;l-Abbas Muhammad was sent ahead to Kairouan, the Aghlabid capital. Unbeknownst to him, news of Sa&#x27;id and his identity as one sought by the Abbasid government had already reached the city, and he was immediately arrested. As a result, once again Sa&#x27;id had to alter his plans: instead of crossing the Aghlabid domains and making for the country of the Kutama, he joined another caravan heading west, skirting the southern fringes of Aghlabid territory. He was accompanied only by his son and Ja&#x27;far. Pressuring and even bribing the caravan leader to make haste, they eventually arrived in Sijilmasa.
An oasis town in modern eastern Morocco, Sijilmasa was the terminus of several trans-Sahara trade routes, and far from the reach of the Aghlabid emirs. Indeed, its Midrarid ruler, al-Yasa ibn Midrar, like most Berbers, espoused Kharijism, making them foes of the Abbasid caliphs. Posing once again as a wealthy merchant, Sa&#x27;id bought a nice residence in the city, and was slowly joined by the rest of his household over the following months. There he remained for the next four years, continuing his mercantile activities which apparently brought him additional wealth, all the while remaining in contact with Abu Abdallah al-Shi&#x27;i, who now embarked on the conquest of Ifriqiya. His identity did not remain a secret for too long: the Aghlabid emir, Ziyadat Allah III, informed the Midrarid emir of the true nature of the merchant from the east, but, aided by rich gifts from Sa&#x27;id, the emir of Sijilmasa saw no reason to do anything about it. Already before the conquest of the Aghabid emirate was complete, Abu Abdallah sent a troop of Kutama to escort Sa&#x27;id to Ifriqiya, but they were waylaid by the Rustamid emir of Tahert and had to turn back.

== Reign ==
=== Establishment of the Fatimid Caliphate ===
On 18 March 909, the Kutama under the Abu Abdallah decisively defeated the last Aghlabid army at al-Aribus. The next day, Ziyadat Allah III fled his palace city of Raqqada for Egypt, taking many of his treasures with him, but leaving most of his extensive harem behind, and taking care to torch the offices of the land tax department and all fiscal records contained therein. Chaos broke out once this became known, as the palaces were ransacked and any thought of further resistance vanished. A delegation of notables surrendered Kairouan, and on the next day, 25 March 909, Abu Abdallah entered Raqqada and took up residence in the palace of the emir.

==== Regency of Abu Abdallah al-Shi&#x27;i ====
As his master was still in faraway Sijilmasa, it was up to Abu Abdallah to establish the new Shi&#x27;a regime in Ifriqiya. He issued a letter of pardon () to the citizens of Kairouan and all former servants of the Aghlabid regime, took stock of the contents of the palaces, installed governors, and ordered changes to the coinage, calls to prayer and the sermon, and official seals to reflect the new regime. The new ruler was not yet named in public; instead, the new formulas used Quranic verses or paraphrases that exalted the Family of Muhammad, the fulfillment of God&#x27;s promise, the victory of God&#x27;s truth (), and of the Proof of God (, i.e., the ). Abu&#x27;l-Abbas Muhammad, who had escaped from prison and emerged from hiding after his brother&#x27;s victory, began to spread the Isma&#x27;ili doctrine, holding disputations with the local Sunni jurists in the Great Mosque of Kairouan. Abu Abdallah also chose a new chief (judge), in the person of the local Shi&#x27;ite Muhammad ibn Umar al-Marwarrudhi.

As soon as his rule was stable enough, on 6 June 909, Abu Aballah set out from Raqqada at the head of a large army, to find his master and hand over power to him. In his stead at Raqqada, he left Abu Zaki Tammam ibn Mu&#x27;arik, with his brother Abu&#x27;l-Abbas Muhammad as his aide. On the way, Abu Abdallah received the submission of Muhammad ibn Khazar, leader of the nomadic Zenata Berbers, and overthrew the Rustamid imamate at Tahert, installing a Kutama governor there. Learning of the approach of the Kutama army, the emir of Sijilmasa had Sa&#x27;id questioned and put under house arrest along with his son, but otherwise treated well. Their servants on the other hand were thrown into prison, and regularly whipped.

==== Proclamation of al-Mahdi and coming to Ifriqiya ====
On 26 August 909, the Kutama army reached Sijilmasa, and demanded the release of their captive imam. After brief clashes with the Midrarid troops, Emir al-Yasa fled his city, which was occupied and plundered. Mounted on horseback and dressed in fine clothes, Sa&#x27;id and his son were presented to the army, amidst shouts and tears of religious exaltation. On the next day, 27 August, Sa&#x27;id was enthroned and acclaimed by the troops. As the historian Michael Brett explains, the occasion had double meaning: on the one hand, it acknowledged Sa&#x27;id&#x27;s caliphate, but on the other, it recognized the Kutama soldiery as &#x27;faithful&#x27; () or &#x27;friends of God&#x27; (), an elite distinct from the mass of ordinary Muslims.

The army remained at Sijilmasa for several weeks, during which delegations offering submission came from across the western Maghreb. The fugitive emir of Sijilmasa was captured, and the Kutama chieftain Ibrahim ibn Ghalib installed as governor. On 12 October, the army began its return march. On the way it relieved Tahert, which in the meantime had come under attack by the Zenata under Ibn Khazar, attacked the tribe of Sadina in its mountain strongholds, and launched an expedition to capture Ibn Khazar, but the latter managed to flee into the desert. The army then turned northeast, and Sa&#x27;id visited Ikjan, the original base of Abu Abdallah&#x27;s mission among the Kutama. There Sa&#x27;id arranged the affairs of the Kutama tribes, and took care to gather the treasures that had for years been hoarded in his name. 

After twenty days, the army marched on towards Kairouan, where on 4 January 910 the city notables came forth to greet their new ruler. Asked for a renewal of Abu Abdallah&#x27;s , Sa&#x27;id immediately guaranteed their lives, but pointedly did not say anything about their possessions. The new caliph did not enter Kairouan—which he seems never to have visited during his life—and instead rode straight for Raqqada. On the next day, Friday, 5 January 910, in the sermon of the Friday prayer, a manifesto hailing the return of the caliphate to its rightful possessors, the Family of Muhammad, was read, and the name and titles of the new ruler were formally announced: &quot;Abdallah Abu Muhammad, the Imam rightly guided by God, the Commander of the Faithful&quot;.

=== Domestic policies ===
====Challenges of a revolutionary regime====

The proclamation of al-Mahdi as caliph was the culmination of the decades-long efforts of the Isma&#x27;ili , and the first time since the caliphate of Ali ibn Abi Talib (656–661) that a member of the Family of Muhammad governed a major part of the Muslim world. The establishment of the Fatimid Caliphate was part of a wider rise of Shi&#x27;a regimes in the 10th-century Muslim world, the so-called &quot;Shi&#x27;a Century&quot;, which included the Zaydi principalities in Yemen and Tabaristan, the Hamdanids in Syria, and the Buyids in Persia and Iraq. 

As Shi&#x27;a imams, al-Mahdi and his successors were not only the secular rulers of a state (), but concurrently also Shi&#x27;a imams, at the head of the still extant and wide-ranging network of the , and thus posed a direct ideological challenge to the Sunni Abbasids for the leadership of the entire Islamic world. Already in his inaugural proclamation, al-Mahdi claimed a mandate to &quot;conquer the world to East and West, in accordance with God&#x27;s promise, from sinful rebels&quot;.

However, in those universalist claims lay the very problem of the new regime; as the historian Hugh Kennedy writes, &quot;the moment when a revolutionary movement achieves power is always of crucial importance&quot;, since it has to fulfill its promises to its followers. Al-Mahdi had come to power riding a wave of millennialist and messianic promises, his followers expecting a divinely inspired leader capable of performing miracles. Once in power, however, he would prove to be a mere mortal, and focused more on his legitimist claim on the caliphate as a descendant of Ali, rather than attempting to fulfill the overblown expectations placed on the &#x27;Proof of God&#x27; that Abu Abdallah had heralded. 

The way that al-Mahdi tried to manage expectations can be seen in the choice of his regnal name: &#x27;Abdallah Abu Muhammad&#x27; was the exact reverse of the name of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and also ensured that his son, now known as Abu&#x27;l-Qasim Muhammad rather than Abd al-Rahman, would bear the same name as the Islamic prophet, as had long been prophesied for the : Abu&#x27;l-Qasim Muhammad ibn Abdallah. As Halm points out, this allowed al-Mahdi to shift the millennialist expectations of his followers onto his son, buying time. At the same time, however, this also meant that the singular, semi-divine figure of the was now reduced to an adjective in a caliphal title, &#x27;the Imam rightly guided by God&#x27; (): instead of the promised messiah, al-Mahdi was merely one in a long sequence of imams descending from Ali and Fatima. 

====Setting up a new administration====
A major problem faced by al-Mahdi was the narrow basis of the new regime. The Fatimid dynasty was brought to power by the Kutama, who were, according to Brett, &quot;indispensable&quot;, but also &quot;a liability and a threat&quot; to its survival. Halm has described the early Fatimid regime as being little more than a &quot;hegemony of the Kutama&quot;. The position of these semi-civilized tribesmen as the chosen warriors of the imam-caliph was greatly resented, not only by the other Berber tribes, but chiefly by the inhabitants of the cities, where the Arabic culture predominated. As Halm writes, the situation was similar to a scenario where, &quot;in the early eighteenth-century North America, the Iroquois, converted to Catholicism by Jesuit missionaries, had overrun the Puritan provinces of New England, installed their chieftains as governors in Boston, Providence and Hartford, and proclaimed a European with dubious credentials as King of England&quot;. In Kairouan and the old Aghlabid palace city of al-Qasr al-Qadim, therefore, local Arabs were appointed: al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn Abi Khinzir and his brother Khalaf. In the provinces, where Kutama governors were appointed, the first years of Fatimid rule were marked by revolts by the local inhabitants against the arrogance and exactions of the Kutama.

While he appointed the Kutama to garrisons and governorships and gave them rich rewards, in order to administer his new state, al-Mahdi required the expertise of the Arab urban population. As Kennedy remarks, unlike the regimes of later radical Isma&#x27;ili groups, al-Mahdi&#x27;s administration was &quot;surprisingly conventional&quot;. For this purpose, al-Mahdi had to take over most of the personnel of the Aghlabid emirs, often men of dubious loyalty, like Ibn al-Qadim. The latter had initially followed Ziyadat Allah III into exile, only to abandon him and return to Ifriqiya with a considerable portion of the former emir&#x27;s treasure. Al-Mahdi now appointed him to two crucial posts as head of the land tax bureau () and of the postal service (). The new caliph established a series of new fiscal departments in emulation of Abbasid practice, but notably not a vizierate, instead using the post of secretary () to supervise the function of his government. This post was held initially by a holdover from Aghlabid times, Abu&#x27;l-Yusr al-Baghdadi, but after his death in January 911 he was replaced by Abu Ja&#x27;far Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Baghdadi, who would continue serving in this capacity under al-Mahdi&#x27;s successors. After the purge of Abu Abdallah al-Shi&#x27;i, the caliph also instituted a new department, the &#x27;bureau of detection&#x27; () under the supervision of the Muhammad al-Baghdadi. Unlike contemporary Abbasid practice, which relegated this task to a dedicated department, al-Mahdi was careful to hear and judge petitions for redress against abuse by officials () in person.

In another notable department from usual practice, there was no department for the army, as the tribally organized Kutama represented the bulk of the Fatimid military. To complement them, al-Mahdi also took over the surviving Aghlabid slave soldiers (), usually of Slavic () or Greek () origin, as well as recruiting black Africans. The Arabic settler army of Kairouan was also retained, albeit relegated to secondary status due to their dubious loyalty.

====Purge of Abu Abdallah al-Shi&#x27;i====
The first serious challenge to the new regime arose within the ranks of the very men who had brought it to power, the Kutama chieftains. The prophetic traditions about the , while diffuse, had insisted that his coming would be heralded by celestial signs and portents, that he would be a young man of exceptional beauty, and that he would rapidly and miraculously lead his armies to victory. Not only did al-Mahdi, a 35-year old former merchant accustomed to an easy life, wine, and rich clothing, not match these expectations, but his luxurious lifestyle clashed with the austere doctrines propagated by Abu Abdallah al-Shi&#x27;i and hitherto followed by the Kutama. Even Abu Abdallah criticized his master, accusing him of corrupting the Kutama with power, money and luxury and gifts. At the same time, while al-Mahdi reaped the fruits of their sacrifices, the Kutama chieftains saw themselves excluded from the administration, which was staffed with non-Kutama officials, and even with high-ranking members of the Aghlabid government that they had fought against. 

As a result, Abu Abdallah became disillusioned with his master. As historian Najam Haider writes, this was a &quot;failure of expectations&quot;, as al-Mahdi &quot;did not live up to [Abu Abdallah&#x27;s] vision of a divinely appointed and inerrant figure&quot;. An immediate conflict was averted as Abu Abdallah was called to lead an army west in July 910. During the previous months, Sijilmasa had been lost to the Midrarids, Tahert was once more closely besieged by the Zenata, and an uprising broke out among the Kutama, led by a certain Baban. The latter was quickly subdued by loyalist Kutama, and Abu Abdallah managed to defeat the Zenata near Tubna, relieving Tahert and even reaching the Mediterranean coast at Ténès. He then campaigned against the Zenata and Sadina tribes in modern central Algeria, before returning to Raqqada in the winter of 910/11.

At Ténès, however, a conspiracy had begun among the Kutama chieftains: led by Abu Abdallah, they decided to confront the caliph and put his claims to the test. The sources differ on the details, but the Kutama confronted al-Mahdi in a public audience, demanding that he perform a miracle. Abu Abdallah, his brother Abu&#x27;l-Abbas Muhammad, Abu Zaki, and the &#x27;supreme shaykh&#x27; Abu Musa Harun openly accused him of being a fraud and an impostor. When Abu Musa Harun was murdered shortly after, the other conspirators decided to assassinate al-Mahdi. Possibly due to the doubts of Abu Abdallah, or because they could not agree on his successor, they delayed their action. Informed of their intentions, al-Mahdi moved first. Commanders whose loyalty was suspect were sent to missions away from the capital, and replaced by loyal ones, so that on 18 February 911, Abu Abdallah and Abu&#x27;l-Abbas Muhammad were assassinated by loyal Kutama soldiers in the caliph&#x27;s own palace. News of the death of Abu Abdallah al-Shi&#x27;i spread quickly. Al-Mahdi hesitated for two days, but then executed the remaining Kutama leaders involved in the conspiracy.

According to Brett, who rejects or doubts the early association of Abu Abdallah with a central movement based at Salamiya, al-Mahdi&#x27;s triumph in the contest with Abu Abdallah meant the takeover of &quot;an apocalyptic movement on behalf of a messiah in waiting, which had germinated at some time after the [disappearance of the Twelver imams in 874], and flourished on the periphery of the Abbasid empire&quot;. Brett further suggests that the events of 911, with the questions raised about al-Mahdi&#x27;s identity and the murder of Abu Abdallah, are the origins for the story of the schism of 899 and the death of the missionary Abdan, via a garbled transmission in later anti-Fatimid sources.

====Suppression of antinomianism====
The new regime also had to contend with the more extremist tendencies among its own followers. Early Isma&#x27;ili doctrine preached that all previous revealed religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam itself—and their scriptures were but veils: they imposed outer () forms and rules that were meant to conceal the inner (), true religion as it had been practised in Paradise. The coming of Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il as the in the end times would reveal these esoteric truths () and release mankind from the obligations of religious law (). Al-Mahdi&#x27;s modification of Isma&#x27;ili doctrine to allow for an indefinite number of imams before the final arrival of the end times changed these expectations, but they continued to be widely held, notably by the Qarmatians and other extremist () groups; as Daftary points out, these doctrines and acts like the Qarmatian sack of Mecca in 930 &quot;were also seized upon by Sunni polemicists to accuse all Isma&#x27;ilis of libertinism and antinomianism&quot;.

As late as 921, al-Mahdi had to take measures against about two hundred of his own Isma&#x27;ili followers, who openly flouted Islamic law by eating pork and drinking wine in the month of Ramadan. The arrested, among them several prominent men from different cities, regarded the previous obligations restrictions imposed by religious law as lifted, and some of them even went as far as to regard al-Mahdi as god manifest on earth. 
This was anathema to al-Mahdi and his nascent regime: as Halm explains, &quot;Antinomianism meant anarchy, and so long as the Kingdom of God had not dawned – and according to the revised doctrine, it had not yet dawned — the beneficent reins of the law could not be dispensed with&quot;. Official Fatimid doctrine henceforth insisted on the continued validity of the and the outer strictures of Islamic law, even for those Isma&#x27;ili faithful who had been be initiated into the inner truths; but the latent antinomian tendencies of Isma&#x27;ilism would re-emerge in the future, in movements such as the Druze and the Order of Assassins.

====Maliki hostility====
During the 9th century, Kairouan had become one of the greatest centres of Islamic jurisprudence. Its Sunni jurists adopted a critical stance against the Aghlabid emirs, and ambitious chief s played an important, and at times autonomous, political role. Dominated by the conservative Maliki school since the mid-9th century, the city&#x27;s jurists were from the beginning a major source of opposition to the new Fatimid regime and its practices. 

Abu Abdallah and his brother had held disputations with the jurists, trying to win them over to backing the Fatimids&#x27; claims of the primacy of Ali and his progeny or the tenets of Isma&#x27;ili doctrine, but in vain. During the campaign of Abu Abdallah to Sijilmasa, the people of Kairouan apparently hoped that he would never return. In October/November, two prominent jurists were publicly executed and their corpses drawn through the city as a warning. The letters sent by Abu Abdallah, first from Sijilmasa, and then from Ikjan, about the success of his mission and the imminent arrival of &quot;the Imam, our lord and master, the Mahdi, and his son&quot; were read publicly in Kairouan and sent to all cities of the realm, to discourage opposition. Al-Mahdi also tried to reconcile the Malikis, at least at first, but also did not hesitate to impose Isma&#x27;ili ritual practices against their vehement objection; leading to constant tensions between the citizens of Kairouan and the Fatimid governors of the city, who were responsible for their implementation.

For the duration of the Fatimids&#x27; rule in Ifriqiya, the Maliki elites rejected Fatimid legitimacy. Maliki authors call them merely &quot;Easterners&quot; or even &quot;Unbelievers&quot;, and the caliphs by their first names rather than their regnal titles. Al-Mahdi himself was derisively called by the diminutive form of his first name as Ubayd Allah (&#x27;Little Abd Allah&#x27;); whence the dynasty is usually labelled in hostile Sunni sources as &quot;Ubaydid&quot; (). Consequently, al-Mahdi sought and found support among the Malikis&#x27; rivals, the minority Hanafi school, especially as many of them claimed to have Shi&#x27;a sympathies. Men like the first Fatimid chief , al-Marwarrudhi, and the scholar and later Isma&#x27;ili , Ibn al-Haytham, belonged to this group. In contrast to Kairouan, the court in the palace city of Raqqada was dominated by Isma&#x27;ilis: it had its own Isma&#x27;ili Kutama , and al-Mahdi&#x27;s companions from the time of his flight served as its chamberlains.

The chief , al-Marwarrudhi, was a particular object of hatred by the Maliki Kairouanis due to his uncompromising stance in persecuting any deviation from Isma&#x27;ili precepts. In the end, the many death sentences became too much even for al-Mahdi, who had him executed in 915. His replacement, Muhammad ibn Mahfuz al-Qamudi, was another Ifriqiyan, who lasted in office until his death in 919. His successor was Ishaq ibn Abi&#x27;l-Minhal, but he proved too moderate for al-Mahdi and was replaced in October 923 by a more determined and fanatical Isma&#x27;ili partisan, Muhammad ibn Imran al-Nafti. As al-Nafti died within a few months of taking office, Ibn Abi&#x27;l-Minhal was restored to the post. Another figure accused of tyranny was the governor of Kairouan, Abu Sa&#x27;id al-Dayf, appointed in 918. The Kairouanis turned to the heir-apparent, al-Qa&#x27;im, for assistance in mediating an audience with al-Mahdi to air their grievances. Isolated instances show that the caliph&#x27;s spy network, complemented and extended by the Isma&#x27;ili to far beyond the borders of his realm, was active in identifying and eliminating figures who actively opposed the Fatimid regime. On the other hand, according to Halm, the tales in Maliki sources of thousands of martyrs perishing in the dungeons of the caliphal palace are very likely a gross exaggeration: al-Mahdi was willing to tolerate dissent as long as it did not break out into public opposition.

====Anti-Kutama riots and the uprising of the anti-====
In summer 911, a quarrel between a Kutama soldier and a merchant in the old Aghlabid palace city of al-Qasr al-Qadim led to an uprising in the latter. The revolt, led by men associated with the previous regime, subsided after a few clashes with the Kutama, but after enough time had passed, al-Mahdi launched purges of the uprising&#x27;s leaders, which encompassed his minister Ibn al-Qadim. This was but the first of many uprisings against the Kutama, however, who quickly became hated. In Tahert, a revolt broke out that killed or drove out the Kutama garrison, and then called the Zenata under Ibn Khazar for aid. A Kutama army defeated the Zenata with heavy losses, and sacked Tahert on 1 October. Its former governor, Dawwas ibn Sawlat al-Lahisi, was recalled to Raqqada and executed. In April 912, another quarrel between the Kutama and a local merchant led to bloody clashes in the streets of Kairouan, in which all Kutama in the city were killed; the sources report 700 dead. When al-Mahdi tried to discover the leaders of this affair to punish them, he was met with silence, and had to content himself with a delegation of city notables seeking his pardon.

This incident rankled with the Kutama, and, coupled with the previous doubts about al-Mahdi, helped spark a new uprising. A young boy, Kadu ibn Mu&#x27;arik al-Mawati, was proclaimed as the true , new s were appointed, and a new holy book written. Starting from Ikjan, the original centre of Abu Abdallah&#x27;s mission, the revolt spread to the cities of Mila and Constantine, while a loyalist army sent against them was thrown back after many of the Kutama in its ranks defected. In response, in April/May 912, al-Mahdi officially proclaimed his son, Abu&#x27;l-Qasim Muhammad, as heir-apparent (), gave him the regnal name (&#x27;He who executes God&#x27;s command&#x27;), and placed him in nominal charge of the army sent to quell the revolt. On 21 June 912, the loyalist army decisively defeated the rebels near Mila. The anti- al-Mawati and the other rebel leaders were soon captured, and prominently featured in al-Qa&#x27;im&#x27;s triumphal entry into Kairouan in autumn.

====Foundation of Mahdiya====
The anti-Kutama riots in Kairouan and al-Qasr al-Qadim highlighted the vulnerability of the palace city of Raqqada, which was poorly fortified. Already in 912, al-Mahdi began seeking a new, and more defensible, site for his residence. He personally travelled the coast for this purpose, even visiting the ruins of ancient Carthage, before settling on the small peninsula of Jumma. A rocky peninsula of about length and only wide at its base, it was eminently defensible from a land-based attack, and included an ancient Punic artificial harbour cut into the rock.
Construction began on 11 May 916 with a massive landward wall, whose single gate was considered an engineering masterpiece: the trick of installing the doors on beds of glass, so that a single person could open them, was said to have come from al-Mahdi himself. The new palace city was fortified on the seaward side as well, and included a great congregational mosque—the only Fatimid-era structure to survive to modern times—two palaces, one for the caliph and one for his heir-apparent, and other buildings for the caliphal court and administration. The only weakness of Mahdiya was its lack of natural resources, especially water; large grain stores and cisterns were built for rainwater, but in case of a siege, the city would have to be supplied by sea.

As heavy rainfall damaged the palaces in Raqqada, al-Mahdi expedited the move into the new residence with his court, which took place on 20 February 921, although construction was still ongoing. Mahdiya was palace city, arsenal, treasury, and military stronghold in one; only the Fatimid family and its most loyal members were settled there. The garrison was provided by black African slave troops (), as well as by Slavic slave soldiers and Kutama. The Zawila and Kutama soldiers lived mostly in the city&#x27;s suburb outside the landward wall. The Arab and its leaders, whose loyalties were suspect, was deliberately excluded.

====Death and succession====
Al-Mahdi died at Mahdiya on 4 March 934, after a period of illness. Al-Qa&#x27;im kept his death secret for a hundred days, before announcing a period of public mourning. As the designated () successor of the imam-caliph, al-Qa&#x27;im did not face any opposition. His numerous half-siblings by concubines—six sons and seven daughters—never played an important role, and al-Mahdi had deliberately kept them in the palace, not entrusting them with a gubernatorial or military command. Only once, during al-Qa&#x27;im″s 928 campaign against the Berbers, when he was out of contact with Mahdiya for several weeks and feared lost, did al-Mahdi allow another son, Abu Ali Ahmad, to play a leading role in public ceremonies. The motivation for this unusual move—whether as a result of palace intrigues or due to a genuine concern that al-Qa&#x27;im might be dead—and whether al-Mahdi truly intended to promote Ahmad as an alternative successor, remains unknown. Al-Qa&#x27;im rushed back to his father&#x27;s side and consolidated his position, but the affair left a lasting rift between al-Mahdi and his son. However, in Tripolitania a certain Muhammad ibn Talut claimed to be a son of al-Mahdi and laid claim to the caliphate. He managed to rally a large following among the local Berbers, before his deception was discovered and he was executed by his own followers. Otherwise the transition into the new reign was smooth, with al-Qa&#x27;im taking up residence in the caliphal palace of Mahdiya and retaining al-Mahdi&#x27;s ministers in their duties.

===Imperial expansion===
Immediately after stabilizing his rule over the former Aghlabid domains, al-Mahdi was virtually obliged to engage in imperial expansion. As Brett puts it, this was ultimately &quot;the goal on which his credibility rested, the conquest of the world to East and West&quot;. This meant military operations in three directions at once, against three political and ideological powers that dominated the Mediterranean world: the Muslim &quot;usurpers&quot;, the Abbasid Caliphate in the east and the Umayyad Emirate of Córdoba in the west; and the main Christian enemy, the Byzantine Empire, in the north, in Sicily and southern Italy.

====East: Cyrenaica and Egypt====
Following the consolidation of his rule in Ifriqiya, al-Mahdi&#x27;s first objective was Egypt, the gateway to Syria and Iraq, the old heartlands of the Islamic world and seat of their Abbasid rivals. The Fatimids hoped for help from their sympathizers in Egypt; not only had al-Mahdi himself stayed at Fustat in 904–905, but the sources record that the local Abbasid governor was forced to execute several people for corresponding with al-Mahdi and his son, al-Qa&#x27;im.

=====Conquest of Tripoli=====
The first step east was Tripoli, which submitted to the Fatimids following the fall of the Aghlabid emirate. The local Hawwara Berbers quickly came to resent the overbearing behaviour of the Kutama soldiery, as well as the heavy tax demands placed upon them. A first uprising and siege of Tripoli in 910–911 was followed by a general revolt of the Hawwara in summer 912. The Fatimid governor of Tripoli fled, and all Kutama in the city were slaughtered. Al-Qa&#x27;im led a combined land and naval expedition, laying siege to Tripoli until it capitulated in June 913. Al-Qa&#x27;im left one of the principal Kutama generals, Habasa ibn Yusuf, there, to prepare the further eastward expansion of the Fatimid empire.

=====Loss of Yemen=====
Al-Mahdi apparently also entertained hopes of a pincer movement against Egypt from two sides, with the support of his missionaries in the Yemen. It was not to be: Ibn al-Fadl, who had conquered most of Yemen from his base in the south of the country, renounced al-Mahdi and proclaimed himself as the in August 911.

The reasons for this are unclear, but are likely related to the contemporary processes of disillusionment with al-Mahdi in Ifriqiya, and the news of the execution of Abu Abdallah al-Shi&#x27;i. Al-Mahdi had also sent a letter to the Yemeni faithful, addressing concerns as to his identity and documenting his supposed genealogy. This letter caused much unease and dissension, for al-Mahdi effectively repudiated the title of &#x27;Proof of God&#x27; and the notion of a &#x27;second Muhammad&#x27;, which had been associated with the until then and in whose name Abu Abdallah had proclaimed his victory. In the same letter, he claimed descent from Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq, the last common imam recognized by Twelvers and Isma&#x27;ilis alike, via al-Sadiq&#x27;s eldest son Abdallah al-Aftah, whom he named as the father of his own great-grandfather, Abdallah al-Akbar. Not only did this contradict all previous Isma&#x27;ili propaganda, which emphasized that the legitimate imamate had followed the line of al-Sadiq&#x27;s younger son Isma&#x27;il, but the claimed genealogy was patently false: Abdallah al-Aftah died young, and was commonly known to not have had any offspring. The same letter further upended previous doctrine by emphasizing that though he was the expected , his rule would not bring about the end times, but merely represent another link in a line of imams that was to continue endlessly into the future, thereby contradicting all millennialist expectations vested in his person.

The other Isma&#x27;ili in the Yemen, Ibn Hawshab, remained loyal to al-Mahdi, but was forced to capitulate against Ibn al-Fadl&#x27;s forces, and hand over his son Ja&#x27;far as a hostage. Both s died within a few months of each other in 915—Ibn al-Fadl was said to have been poisoned by agents of al-Mahdi posing as physicians—leading to the swift collapse of Isma&#x27;ili rule in the Yemen. By 917 the Sunni Yu&#x27;firids had completed the reconquest of the country in the name of the Abbasid caliph.

=====First invasion of Egypt=====

The first expedition against Egypt was launched on 24 January 914, led by Habasa ibn Yusuf. Advancing along the coast, on 6 February it entered Barqa, the capital of Cyrenaica. There Habasa executed two chieftains of the Mazata tribe, who nine years before had waylaid and robbed al-Mahdi during his journey to Ifriqiya; their sons were also killed, and their womenfolk sold into slavery and their possessions confiscated. Encouraged by this success, on 11 July al-Mahdi sent al-Qa&#x27;im with another army east to assume command of the expedition. Disregarding these orders, however, the ambitious Habasa led his forces into Egypt, entering Alexandria on 27 August.

The news of the Fatimid invasion threw Baghdad into a panic. The Abbasid government had paid little attention to the affairs of Ifriqiya and the claims of al-Mahdi—al-Tabari refers to him vaguely as al-Khariji (&#x27;the Kharijite&#x27;) or Ibn al-Basri (&#x27;Son of the Basran&#x27;)—but now urgent inquiries were made as to his origin and intentions. The Fatimid campaign in Egypt ultimately failed. The attempts to cross the Nile at Giza and capture Fustat were beaten back, and reinforcements arrived from Syria under Mu&#x27;nis al-Muzaffar in April 915, greatly shoring up the Abbasid position in the country. The Fatimid army was also plagued by indiscipline and a divided command, as al-Qa&#x27;im fell out with Habasa. The latter eventually deserted the campaign and returned to Ifriqiya. Alarmed by this, al-Qa&#x27;im evacuated Alexandria hastily and without battle, leaving much of his armament and equipment behind, returning to Raqqada in 28 May 915. In his rear, Cyrenaica rose in revolt and overthrew Fatimid control; in Barqa, the entire Kutama garrison was killed.

The expedition&#x27;s failure rocked the Fatimid regime&#x27;s very foundation and the belief in the divine mission of the imam-caliph was shaken. As a result, discontent arose, particularly among the Kutama sub-tribe of the Malusa, from whom Habasa, now hounded as a criminal, originated. His eventual capture and imprisonment led to the revolt of his brother Ghazwiyya, who had played a crucial role in securing al-Mahdi&#x27;s regime up to that point, and who had recently been given charge of the entire Kutama country to the west of Ifriqiya. The revolt was quickly crushed, however, and Ghazwiyya and Habasa were executed. When their heads were brought before al-Mahdi, he is said to have exclaimed &quot;Once did these heads enclose the East and West; and now they are contained within this basket!&quot;.

=====Second invasion of Egypt=====

Al-Mahdi immediately began preparations for a second assault on Egypt, starting with the recapture of Cyrenaica. This was accomplished with the surrender of Barqa after an 18-month siege, in April 917. The expedition against Egypt began on 5 April 919, when al-Qa&#x27;im, placed in sole command of the campaign, set out from Raqqada. Although Alexandria&#x27;s Abbasid garrison had been reinforced, it was abandoned without battle upon the arrival of the Fatimid army. Having already acknowledged Fatimid sovereignty during the first invasion and hence now considered in revolt, the city was sacked by the Fatimid troops.

Once again, the Abbasids concentrated at defending the Nile crossing at Giza. Al-Qa&#x27;im did not move against Giza, however, giving time for Abbasid reinforcements under Mu&#x27;nis al-Muzaffar to arrive. On 12 March 920, the Fatimid invasion fleet was destroyed by the Abbasid admiral Thamal al-Dulafi, crippling the invaders. Pressed for supplies, al-Qa&#x27;im repeated his manoeuvre of 914, occupying the Fayyum Oasis. Fatimid troops also succeeded in occupying much of Upper Egypt, cutting off the grain supply to Fustat.

For an entire year after that, both sides avoided open conflict, and engaged rather in a diplomatic and propaganda battle. Mu&#x27;nis offered promises of safe-conduct as well as recognition of the Fatimids as autonomous rulers of Ifriqiya in the style of the Aghlabids, if al-Qa&#x27;im and his father submitted to the Abbasid caliph. Al-Qa&#x27;im rejected these overtures, reiterating the Fatimid claims to universal dominion as the rightful heirs of Muhammad. He also sent letters to Fustat urging the Egyptians to rise in revolt, and to the two holy cities of Islam, Mecca and Medina, demanding recognition of the Fatimid claims to sovereignty over the Islamic world.

Finally, in late spring 921, the Abbasids launched their attack, capturing Alexandria and then moving onto Fayyum. Cut off in the oasis, al-Qa&#x27;im was forced to abandon all his heavy equipment, and with his army crossed the desert to Barqa.

=====Raids into Egypt and relations with the Qarmatians=====
For a few years, the Fatimids continued to launch raids from Barqa into Egypt: in 922/23 and 928, Fatimid troops fought Abbasid troops at Dhat al-Himam, some west of Alexandria. In 923/24, the Fatimid commander Masrur ibn Sulayman ibn Kafi raided one of the oases of the Western Desert (likely Dakhla Oasis), defeated the local governor and occupied the place, before the outbreak of a disease forced him to retreat. 

These attacks on Egypt coincided with almost a decade of intensive attacks against the Abbasids by the Qarmatians of Bahrayn, under the leadership of Abu Tahir al-Jannabi; but contrary to the claims by contemporary Arab historians, and the hypotheses put forth by some early 20th-century scholars of Isma&#x27;ilism, no coordination between al-Jannabi and al-Mahdi can be established. When the Qarmatians sacked Mecca in 930 and stole the Black Stone, al-Mahdi even sent a letter to Abu Tahir in reproach, and urged him to immediately return of the Black Stone.

Towards the end of his reign, al-Mahdi may have begun organizing a third invasion of Egypt, but it was not launched until after his death, in 936, during a period of turmoil in the province. Like the previous two attempts, it was unsuccessful: it was beaten back by Muhammad ibn Tughj al-Ikhshid, who took over power in Egypt and established his own dynasty there. It was not until 969, when the balance of power had shifted much more decisively in favour of the Fatimids and the Ikhshidid regime had declined, that another invasion was undertaken, leading to the Fatimid conquest of Egypt.

====West: Maghreb and al-Andalus====
=====Subduing Berber resistance=====
The core territories of Fatimid Ifriqiya were the same as in late antique times, when the area had been the Byzantine Exarchate of Africa: Tunisia, northeastern Algeria, and Tripolitania, which had been highly urbanized since antiquity and were used to regular administration and taxation. Outside these areas, the native Berber tribes resisted fiercely any attempts to impose Fatimid rule. From the sedentary farmers of the Nafusa Mountains south of Tripoli, to the inhabitants of the Aurès Mountains in western Tunisia and eastern Algeria—known to Arab authors as the &quot;refuge of all rebels&quot;—to the nomadic Zenata tribesmen of the central Algerian plateau and the settled farmers of Ouarsenis in northwestern Algeria, the mountainous areas generally escaped tight Fatimid control.

In Tripolitania, the Hawwara Berbers were subdued as part of the consolidation of Fatimid rule over Tripoli, and their western neighbours, the Berbers of the Nafusa Mountains, were conquered in a series of campaigns in 922–923 by the Sulayman ibn Kafi al-Ijjani.

An exception was Tahert, which served as a westerly outpost of Fatimid Ifriqiya, located some from the eastern edge of Ifriqiya proper. Its Fatimid governor, Masala ibn Habus, was a Miknasa Berber, which brought his tribe under the Fatimid banner. The efforts of the Miknasa to spread Isma&#x27;ilism in Ouarsenis, on the other hand, failed miserably, as the missionaries were simply killed by the local population. Likewise, in 922, the Kutama commander Fahlun and his men, trying to impose Fatimid rule in the Aurès, including heavy taxation and the dispatch of hostages to Mahdiya, were overwhelmed by the locals and killed in their sleep.

Masala faced the Zenata under their leader Ibn Khazar, who repeatedly tried to wrest control of Tahert from the Fatimids. Masala was killed by his rival in November 924, and was succeeded by his brother, Yasal. Although the latter was able to repel a Zenata attack on Tahert in 925, the defeat of a Fatimid relief army by Ibn Khazar encouraged other Berber tribes in the area to rise in revolt. This forced al-Mahdi to send al-Qa&#x27;im to deal with the revolt in person. The heir-apparent set out in April 927, issuing a call to arms not only for the Kutama tribes, but also the Arab and the subdued Berber tribes such as the Hawwara and Ajisa; to ensure the latter&#x27;s loyalty, the families of their chiefs were sent as hostages to Mahdiya. Al-Mahdi&#x27;s old slave Su&#x27;luk, now known as the chamberlain Ja&#x27;far ibn Ubayd, subdued the Kiyana tribe in the Hodna Mountains, whereupon al-Qa&#x27;im established a new city, named al-Muhammadiya (modern M&#x27;Sila) after himself, to cement Fatimid control over the area. One of the earliest Isma&#x27;ili partisans, Ali ibn Hamdun al-Andalusi, was made its first governor. Ziri ibn Manad, the leader of another Berber tribe, the Sanhaja, also offered his submission to al-Qa&#x27;im at this time.

Al-Qa&#x27;im then entered the Zenata lands in the Zab Mountains, denying them food and pasture, and launching a pursuit of Ibn Khazar. Conditions were hard: uninterrupted rainfall for over a month cut off communications with Mahdiya, where the court feared that the entire expedition was lost. Although Ibn Khazar managed again and again to escape his hunters, in March 928 al-Qa&#x27;im sacked the Zenata capital, Zabraqa. The victorious army then returned to Tahert and thence Ifriqiya, being given a triumphal reception at Mahdiya in November 928. His victory dispatch prompted the circulation of a poem, where the al-Qa&#x27;im announces himself as the &quot;Son of the Messenger of God&quot; who is about to &quot;roam throughout God&#x27;s earth...to Egypt and Iraq, and afterwards I shall concern myself with Baghdad&quot;.

Despite this success, Fatimid rule over the remote areas of the Maghreb was fragile. Even in Tahert, the local population felt at liberty to nominate their own governor, Masala&#x27;s son Ali, when Yasal died in 931. Al-Mahdi had to send a military expedition to the city to install his preferred candidate, Yasal&#x27;s son Hamid.

=====Rivalry with Córdoba=====

Apart from the Abbasids, al-Mahdi faced a major Muslim rival closer to Ifriqiya, in the form of the Umayyads of Córdoba, rulers of al-Andalus (Islamic Spain). However, the confrontation between the two major Islamic powers of the western Mediterranean took place mostly via propaganda and proxies, rather than direct conflict. At the time of al-Mahdi&#x27;s accession, the Umayyad emirate was plagued by internal dissension, notably the uprising of Ibn Hafsun, who in his conflict with Emir Abdallah () pledged his allegiance to al-Mahdi. Al-Mahdi sent robes of honour and two Isma&#x27;ili s to the rebel leader, in whose territories the Friday sermon was read in the name of the Fatimid caliph.

Al-Mahdi&#x27;s campaigns in the western Maghreb, in what is now Morocco, were in part meant to &quot;spread fear on the threshold of the Iberian Peninsula&quot;, according to historian Farhat Dachraoui, but the restiveness of the Berber tribes limited the ability of the Fatimid ruler to project power beyond Tahert and seriously contemplate an invasion of al-Andalus. Nevertheless, the Fatimid threat was taken seriously by the Umayyad emir Abd al-Rahman III (), who reinforced his fleet and established patrols along his southern coasts as one of his first measures upon his accession. During the first two decades of his rule, Abd al-Rahman was occupied with suppressing revolts, most notably that of Ibn Hafsun; but as his power grew, in 927 an Umayyad fleet captured Melilla, establishing it as a military base in the Moroccan coast, followed by Ceuta in 931. Abd al-Rahman also entered into an alliance with Ibn Khazar, recognizing him as the &#x27;paramount emir of the Zenata&#x27; and sending him frequent gifts, in exchange for the Berber leader&#x27;s recognizing Umayyad suzerainty. Finally, once he had secured his own position in al-Andalus, in 929 Abd al-Rahman III claimed the title of caliph for himself, establishing the Caliphate of Córdoba, in a direct challenge to al-Mahdi&#x27;s pretensions, both temporal and religious.

=====Attempts to conquer Morocco=====

In June 917, a Fatimid expedition under Masala ibn Habus sacked the coastal town of Nakur (modern Al Hoceima), the seat of a small emirate. Its ruler was killed, but his sons fled to Malaga on the Spanish coast. Once Masala withdrew his army, however, the exiled princes of Nakur returned with the backing of Emir Abd al-Rahman III, and in a single night managed to overthrow the Fatimid garrison of the town. In exchange, Nakur&#x27;s new emir became a vassal of the Emir of Córdoba. 

Next Masala moved against the domains of the Idrisid dynasty, an Alid clan that ruled over what is now northern and central Morocco. At the time, Idrisid rule over Morocco had fractured into various local principalities, led by competing lines of the dynasty that were fighting each other as well as local rivals. Masala forced the Idrisid ruler of Fes, Yahya IV, to acknowledge Fatimid suzerainty and pay tribute. Yahya&#x27;s authority was limited to Fes and its environs, while the rest of the country was given to the governorship of Masala&#x27;s cousin, Musa ibn Abi&#x27;l-Afiya.

Masala returned to Morocco in 921, forcing the emir of Nakur to abandon his capital without a fight. Influenced by the ambitious Musa ibn Abi&#x27;l-Afiya, Masala marched on Fes, deposed Yahya IV, and installed a Fatimid governor in the city. On the return march, Masala once more imposed Fatimid rule over Sijilmasa, installing a pliant Midrarid as a Fatimid vassal. 

The Idrisids&#x27; response to the appearance of the Fatimids varied. Prior to the Fatimid invasion, the Idrisids appear to have been aligned with the Umayyads of Córdoba. Some Idrisids accepted al-Mahdi&#x27;s claims to Alid descent and thus tended to side with the Fatimids, while others resisted Fatimid expansion and turned to the Umayyads of Córdoba for support. One of the latter, al-Hasan al-Hajjam, rose in revolt and recovered Fes. His rule lasted for about two years, before Ibn Abi&#x27;l-Afiya retook the city through treachery and had him killed. Ibn Abi&#x27;l-Afiya then launched a widespread manhunt against the remaining Idrisids across Morocco, which ended only after local chieftains warned him of the inappropriateness of hunting down descendants of Muhammad. It is likely that at this point, according to the historian Chafik Benchekroun, Ibn Abi&#x27;l-Afiya was acting as an independent agent, &quot;without being really neither pro-Fatimid nor pro-Umayyad&quot;. In 929/30, Ibn Abi&#x27;l-Afiya brutally sacked Nakur and extended his rule over the coast around the mouth of the Moulouya River. Another expedition against Ibn Khazar failed to capture the Zenata chieftain.

Then, in 931/2, Ibn Abi&#x27;l-Afiya defected to Abd al-Rahman III. As Halm writes, &quot;with this, Fatimid rule over the far west collapsed with one blow&quot;, and the territories held by Ibn Abi&#x27;l-Afiya and Ibn Khazar became an Umayyad protectorate. The governor of Tahert, Hamid ibn Yasal, was immediately sent west to restore Fatimid control. He managed to defeat Ibn Abi&#x27;l-Afiya and reoccupy Fes, but this was ephemeral: shortly after the Fatimid troops left the city, it was lost again, and Hamid was imprisoned at Mahdiya for his failure. Ibn Abi&#x27;l-Afiya returned to Umayyad allegiance, but was soon after killed by the Idrisids.

====North: Sicily and Italy====
Along with Ifriqiya, al-Mahdi inherited the island of Sicily from the Aghlabids, which had gradually been conquered from the Byzantine Empire during the previous decades. Some Byzantine strongholds remained in the mountainous northeast of the island (the Val Demone), as well as a Byzantine province across the Strait of Messina in Calabria. Sicily was the centre of a perennial war with the Byzantines, which was important from an ideological and propaganda perspective, allowing the Fatimids to &quot;appear as champions of the &quot; against the old Christian enemy of the Muslim world, as the historian Yaacov Lev puts it. At the same time, Lev stresses that the Fatimids were interested more in raiding than outright conquest, that for the Byzantines this was a secondary front, that the fleets involved were small, and that periods of hostility frequently alternated with truces and &quot;a practical policy of &quot;modus vivendi&quot;&quot;.

=====Revolts in Sicily=====
In August 910, al-Mahdi sent his governor of Kairouan, al-Hasan ibn Ahmad ibn Abi Khinzir, as the first Fatimid governor to Sicily. Soon he had made himself so unpopular with the Sicilians, apparently due to heavy taxation—Shi&#x27;a jurisprudence entailed a 20% income tax known as the &#x27;Fifth&#x27; ()—that they rose in revolt, imprisoned him, and asked for his replacement. His replacement, the elderly Ali ibn Umar al-Balawi, arrived in August 912, but he too was deposed in early 913, and the island rose in revolt under the Aghlabid Ahmad ibn Ziyadat Allah ibn Qurhub, who renounced Fatimid allegiance and received recognition from the Abbasid caliph.

In July 914, the Sicilian fleet, commanded by Ibn Qurhub&#x27;s younger son Muhammad, raided the coasts of Ifriqiya. At Leptis Minor, the Sicilians caught a Fatimid naval squadron by surprise on 18 July: the Fatimid fleet was torched, and 600 prisoners taken. Among the latter was the former governor of Sicily, Ibn Abi Khinzir, who was executed. The Sicilians defeated a Fatimid army detachment sent to repel them, and proceeded south, sacking Sfax and reaching Tripoli in August 914. Only the presence of al-Qa&#x27;im, who was then on his way to invade Egypt, deterred an attack on the city.

In the next year, however, a similar undertaking failed, with the Sicilian fleet being defeated. Some areas, such as Agrigento, defected back to the Fatimids. Ibn Qurhub tried to flee to al-Andalus, but was captured and delivered to al-Mahdi. Along with his supporters he was brought to Raqqada, lashed on the tomb of Ibn Abi Khinzir, mutilated, and publicly crucified. The island&#x27;s capital, Palermo, resisted until March 917. After its capitulation, a Kutama garrison was installed under the governor Salim ibn Asad ibn Abi Rashid. The stronger Fatimid presence allowed Salim to secure relative tranquility for the island over twenty years, remaining in office until another revolt overthrew him in 937.

=====War with the Byzantines=====
In August 918, Salim led a night attack on Reggio Calabria, which was captured and sacked. In the following year, however, a truce was signed with Taormina and the other Byzantine strongholds of the Val Demone, possibly so that the Muslim forces could be concentrated on the Italian mainland. There an expedition of 20 ships under Mas&#x27;ud al-Fati attacked the fortress of St. Agatha near Reggio in 922/3. In April 924 a major fleet was sent to Sicily, commanded by the chamberlain Ja&#x27;far ibn Ubayd. After wintering on the island, he raided Bruzzano near Reggio, before sailing on to sack Oria in Apulia. Over 11,000 prisoners were taken, and the local Byzantine commander and bishop surrendered as hostages in surety for the payment of tribute. The chamberlain returned in triumph to Mahdiya in September 925.
At about the same time, al-Mahdi made contact with the Bulgarian emperor, Simeon I, who sent envoys to propose a joint attack on the Byzantine capital Constantinople. The Bulgarian ruler suggested that the Bulgarians would invade by land, and the Fatimids come by sea; all spoils would be divided equally, with the Bulgarians keeping Constantinople and the Fatimids gaining the Byzantine territories in Sicily and southern Italy. As a result of a long war with the Byzantines, by 922 the Bulgarians controlled almost the whole Balkan peninsula, but Constantinople remained out of Simeon&#x27;s reach because he lacked a navy. According to the Byzantine source that reports on these negotiations, al-Mahdi accepted the proposal, but the ship carrying the Bulgarian and Fatimid envoys to Simeon was captured by the Byzantines near the Calabrian coast. When the Byzantine emperor Romanos I learned about the negotiations, the Bulgarians were imprisoned, while the Arab envoys were allowed to return to Mahdiya with rich gifts for the caliph. The Byzantines hastened to renew the 917 peace agreement, including the payment of tribute, and Simeon&#x27;s death in 927 put an end to his ambitions.

Warfare with the Byzantines resumed in 928, when a fleet was sent to Sicily, led by the governor of Kairouan, Sabir al-Fata. He attacked a locality named (&#x27;the caves&#x27;) in Apulia, and proceeded to sack the cities of Taranto and Otranto. The outbreak of a disease forced them to return to Sicily, but then Sabir led his fleet up the Tyrrhenian Sea, forcing Salerno and Naples to ransom themselves with money and precious brocades. In 929, he defeated the local Byzantine on the Adriatic coast, and sacked Termoli. He returned to Mahdiya on 5 September 930, bringing 18,000 prisoners with him. Encouraged by these successes, al-Mahdi planned a new and larger naval offensive against the Byzantines in Italy, but the arrival of a Byzantine embassy led to the conclusion of another truce in 931/2, which was adhered to until after the caliph&#x27;s death.

==Legacy==
The truth of the descent and legitimacy of al-Mahdi&#x27;s claims has been a subject of intense debate since his appearance on the world stage in the early 900s, and eludes a definite answer. Medieval as well as modern scholars have pointed out the problems in the claims put forth by al-Mahdi or on his behalf by later Isma&#x27;ili writers, but his achievement is undeniable: as the orientalist Marius Canard summarized, &quot;Whoever ʿUbayd Allah-Saʿīd may have been, he laid the foundations of the dynasty in North Africa.&quot;

Dachraoui attributes to al-Mahdi &quot;tenacity and prudent wisdom&quot; and stresses that, no matter whether al-Mahdi&#x27;s claims of Alid descent and possession of the imamate were genuine, he was able to successfully establish a new state, end the concealment of the Isma&#x27;ili , and &quot;conduct moderate but firm policies within his provinces, and to wage tireless warfare beyond his frontiers&quot;. Brett points out that al-Mahdi&#x27;s emphasis on constructing a state and dealing with the realities of its governance, left him little time to adapt the Isma&#x27;ili doctrine to the new situation and &quot;develop this Caliphate of God into a full-blown creed of the Imamate&quot;. This was not achieved until the reign of the fourth Fatimid imam-caliph, al-Mu&#x27;izz (). It was also left to al-Mu&#x27;izz to try and woo over the Qarmatians, the Seveners who after the schism of 899 still expected the messianic return of Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il. In this, the caliph would have some success, as the Iranian communities returned to the Fatimid allegiance, enriching the official Isma&#x27;ili doctrine with their intellectual vigor; the Qarmatians of Bahrayn, however, refused to accept the Fatimids as legitimate imams.

== Genealogy claimed by al-Mahdi ==
In a letter sent to the Isma&#x27;ili community in Yemen by al-Mahdi Billah, which was recorded by Ja&#x27;far ibn Mansur al-Yaman, the following genealogy is given:

<text>Karlshamn () is a locality and the seat of Karlshamn Municipality in Blekinge County, Sweden. It had 13,576 inhabitants in 2015, out of 31,846 in the municipality.

Karlshamn received a Royal Charter and city privileges in 1664, when King Charles X Gustav, in Swedish Karl, realized the strategic location near the Baltic Sea. In 1666 the town was named Karlshamn, meaning &quot;Karl&#x27;s Port&quot; in honour of the Swedish king.

== History ==

At the outlet of the stream Mieån was found a harbour and fishing village &quot;Bodekull&quot; and a farm &quot;Bodetorp&quot;. In the lower parts of &quot;Mörrumsån&quot; was a prosperous salmon fishery.

Sweden gained supremacy over the territory through Treaty of Roskilde 1658. The king Charles X Gustav immediately inspected the coast and found here a tremendously beautiful and incomparable harbour. Fortifications designed by Erik Dahlberg were erected on Boön 1659 and on Friesholmen 1675, called &quot;Kastellet&quot;. Troops loyal to the Danish king attacked the town twice in 1676–78. The location attracted foreign merchants and in 1664 royal privileges were issued to establish a town named after the king, meaning &quot;Karl&#x27;s Port&quot;. The settlement expanded rapidly to count 647 citizens in the year 1700. Pestilence reduced the population in 1710.

Industries based on agricultural and mineral products were established during the 18th century. A fire of 1763 destroyed the northern part of the town, another fire ravaged in 1790. The intercontinental war of 1810 gave Karlshamn a rare possibility to trade goods and the citizens prospered. Punch, tobacco and snuff powder were produced in town. Craftsmanship was common until circa 1880, when industrial production took over. The town had 6529 citizens by 1883, the town plan covered 63 hectares and buildings were erected on 693 plots. The railway inaugurated in 1874 connected Karlshamn to Vislanda in the northern province. 1890, the coastal railroad was built. 1876, L.O. Smith established production of aquavit in the town and built a new distillery in 1884 which was effective until 1893, whereafter it was converted into a sugar refinery. In 1912 was established production of vegetable oil in the old refinery, a still continuing operation under the label AAK. Stone cutting in granite quarries was a heavy export industry circa 1850–1940. In Mörrum a paper mill was built in 1962. Since 1975 the port of Karlshamn has gradually transferred its operations to the Stilleryd location, west of town. 1965 was a new hospital building in operation.

Karlshamn is considered to situate in strategically sensitive area, about 50 kilometres from the Swedish main naval base at Karlskrona. Gazprom would lease Karlshamn&#x27;s port to construct Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline after the national government dropped its objections.

==Climate==
Karlshamn has an oceanic climate typical of Southern Sweden, with relatively mild winters for the latitude and summers that are relatively warm. It is influenced by its southerly position on the coastline, which causes particularly mild autumn average temperatures as the maritime influence moderates the cooling. The precipitation pattern is highly variable from year to year depending on prevailing wind patterns.

== Education ==
University 
In Karlshamn a branch of the Blekinge Institute of Technology (BTH) was established in 2000. It focuses on media technology, such as digital games, digital visual production, digital audio production and interactions with web technologies. 
Secondary Schools The upper secondary school (grade 10 to 13) is Väggaskolan in Karlshamn. There are many primary schools (grade 0-9) in the boroughs.

==Culture==

===Performing arts===
The theatre association is named &quot;Teatersmedjan&quot; and draws members from all ages, although the youth dominates. They have rehearsal and venues in a converted locomotive workshop called &quot;Lokstallarna&quot;, this is also the venue for young musical bands - &quot;Musikforum&quot;, which was saved economically by the music producer Johan &quot;Shellback&quot; Schuster, who comes from Karlshamn, in 2014. There are several vocal choirs. The most notable secular choirs are &quot;Karlshamn Chamber Choir&quot; and &quot;ABF-kören&quot;. The parishes also have choirs. Classical music is performed by &quot;Karlshamns musiksällskap&quot;. &quot;Karlshamns musikkår&quot; is a concert band of wind instruments marching through the city center regularly during the summer season. The jazz association &quot;Munthe&quot; invites musicians to play on restaurant &quot;Gourmet Grön&quot;. A musical outdoor fair &quot;Östersjöfestivalen&quot; is held in the town centre the third week of July each summer. There is a municipal music school.

===Media===
&quot;Karlshamns Allehanda&quot; is the name of the daily newspaper founded in the 19th century and since 2003 merged with the regional daily &quot;Blekinge Läns Tidning&quot;, owned by &quot;Gota media&quot;. The second newspaper covering the region is &quot;Sydöstran&quot;. Radio and television has local agencies in the county main town Karlskrona.

Karlshamn is the port where Karl Oskar and Kristina Nilsson and their family departed for America in 1850 in the well-known historical novel The Emigrants by Vilhelm Moberg.

==Townplan and architecture==

The settlement of Bodekull naturally took place on the flat area between the steep rocks east and west of town. The designer of the regular town plan for Karlshamn from 1666 is not known. This first map &quot;Regulierung der Gassen in Bodekulla&quot; shows 24 rectangular blocks of which one is open as a square. The main street &quot;Drottninggatan&quot; is parallel to the river and linear with the navigable inlet to the inner harbour. The grid expanded gradually during the 18th and 19th centuries. Later the town expanded over the meadows and hills to merge with the adjacent Asarum, a rural village north of town. Two old houses remain from the founding time at the square, one is &quot;Asschierska huset&quot; erected as town hall in 1682. The streets of the town was orderly lined with one-two storey buildings, generally a block was subdivided into ten lots on more posh streets and even smaller subdivisions in poorer parts of the town. The church was erected north of the square 1680–1702, the drawing being approved by Erik Dahlbergh. The separate belltower is from 1792. &quot;Skottsbergska gården&quot; is a courtyard shaped by a complete set of merchant buildings from 1766 open to visitors. During the early 19th century the merchants of the town experienced a boom which materialised in added storeys and more decorations on the facades. At the end of this century and the following years some public buildings were erected: the school at the southeast corner of the square inaugurated 1864, the girls school 1879 (now parish&#x27;s meeting rooms) the navigation school 1863 (demolished), the hospital erected 1883 (now partly police post and music school) the Bodestorp folk school 1909, the &quot;realskola&quot; designed 1912-17 by architect Gunnar Asplund and his 1929 addition in modernist/&quot;functionalist&quot; style. 1900 the town hall eas erected south of the square replacing a wooden building. It was substantially expanded in 1990-95 by a series of additional buildings designed by Nyréns 
architects.

==Buildings and structures==
Near Karlshamn, in the village of Gungvala, you can find Gungvalamasten, a 335 metre tall guyed mast for FM- and TV-transmission. It is together with three other guyed masts, of same height, the tallest structure in Sweden.
At Karlshamn, there is Stärnö Power Station with its three chimneys and the static inverter of HVDC SwePol, the power cable to Poland.

==Tourism==
Karlshamn attracts visitors to the salmon fisheries in &quot;Mörrumsån&quot;, to the rocky coastline and the Hällaryd archipelago and to the wooded hinterland. East of the city centre the famous Eriksbergs Viltpark is located. It is an old farmstead with surrounding land now host to a variety of native animals such as European Bison, Crown Deer, Moose and wild boar amongst others. Tourism peaks in June–August, when there is regular boat connection and accommodation service to islands like Tärnö.

==Sports==
The following sports clubs are located in Karlshamn:

* IFK Karlshamn - &quot;football&quot;
* Högadals IS - &quot;football&quot;
* CI85 - &quot;floorball&quot;
* Karlshamns HF - &quot;handball&quot;

==Transport==

===Road===
The bikepath network of Karlshamn is gradually expanding, connecting the localities Mörrum-Svängsta-Asarum-Karlshamn. The road network is mostly covered by tarmac. The European trunk road E22 transverses the municipality, and the national road 29 connects the port to the province Småland in the north.

===Rail===
The railroad &quot;Blekinge kustbana&quot;, electrified in 2006, connects the towns of the region with trains every hour. 

===Port===
The port in Stilleryd is number six in Sweden as related to tonnes of cargo, is the largest and deepest in southeast Sweden and has a regular ferry service with Klaipėda in Lithuania.

<text>Sir John Eldon Gorst (born John Lowndes Gorst; 25 June 1861 – 12 July 1911) was a British diplomat and colonial administrator. He was British Consul-General in Egypt from 1907 to 1911.

==Career==
Gorst was the son of Sir John Eldon Gorst, Solicitor General for England and Wales and Vice-President of the Committee of the Council on Education. Born in New Zealand but raised in London, Gorst attended Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge.

In 1885 he became both a barrister and a member of the British diplomatic corps, going to Egypt the following year as controller of direct taxes, becoming undersecretary for finance in 1892, adviser to the Egyptian Interior Ministry in 1894, and Financial adviser to the Egyptian government in 1898. He was promoted to a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902, and received the order and knighthood on 22 September 1902, during a visit to King Edward VII at Balmoral Castle. He was back in Egypt in time to receive Lord Kitchener during a short visit in late October 1902, when Kitchener was &quot;en route&quot; to take up the appointment as Commander-in-Chief, India. In 1904 Gorst returned to London where, as undersecretary of state, he effectively represented Lord Cromer in the Foreign Office.

After the Liberal Party came to power, the British government sent Gorst to replace Cromer with instructions to give Egyptians greater responsibility to manage their internal affairs. As British Agent and Consul General in Egypt, Gorst quickly improved the Agency&#x27;s relationship with Khedive Abbas Hilmi II, brought more Egyptians into responsible government positions, and weakened the Egyptian National Party. However, his efforts to rein in the burgeoning corps of Anglo-Egyptian officials offended many old Egypt hands. The appointment of Boutros Ghali as prime minister, popularly ascribed to Gorst, angered the Nationalists and many other Egyptians, leading to press attacks and eventually to Boutros Ghali&#x27;s assassination. The revival of the Press Law in 1909 alienated Europeans as well as Egyptians and proved unenforceable. Gorst&#x27;s attempt to extend the Suez Canal Company&#x27;s concession in 1909–1910 to raise additional funds for development in Egypt and the Sudan was disliked by all Egyptians; when he put the issue to the Egyptian General Assembly, vehement opposition from the Nationalist press led to its rejection.
This rejection, together with the murder of Boutros Ghali, caused Gorst to abandon his lenient policy in favor of a harsher one, using the Exceptional Laws and various penal measures to stifle the Nationalists. He had almost restored British control when he became stricken with cancer and went back to England to die.

An unprepossessing and egotistical man, disliked by the older British colonial administrators in Egypt and distrusted by the Egyptians as sphinxlike, Gorst was never accorded the respect that his intelligence and strong will warranted, although he received the Grand Cordons of the Osmanieh and Mejidiye Orders and was a Knight Commander of Sts. Michael and George. His autobiographical notes and diaries are at St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford and other papers are in the possession of his grandson, Paul Lysley.

Eldon Gorst was also the lover for two years in the 1880s of (Christina Anne) Jessica Sykes, née Cavendish-Bentinck, whose son Sir Mark Sykes, 6th Bt., later married 1903 Eldon&#x27;s younger sister Edith.

<doc id="1013741" wikidata="Q5765264" url="?curid=1013741" title="John Eldon Gorst">
<text>Sir John Eldon Gorst, (24 May 1835 – 4 April 1916) was a British lawyer and politician. He served as Solicitor-General for England and Wales from 1885 to 1886 and as Vice-President of the Committee on Education between 1895 and 1902.

==Background and education==
Gorst was born in Preston, Lancashire, the son of Edward Chaddock Gorst, who took the name of Lowndes on succeeding to the family estate in 1853. He graduated third wrangler from St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in 1857, and was admitted to a fellowship.

==New Zealand==
After beginning to read for the bar in London, his father&#x27;s illness and death led to his sailing to New Zealand. The Māori had at that time set up a king of their own in the Waikato district and Gorst, who had made friends with the chief Tamihana (William Thomson), known as the kingmaker, established a Māori trade school in Te Awamutu and later acted as an intermediary between the Māori and the government. Sir George Grey made him inspector of schools, then resident magistrate, and eventually civil commissioner in Upper Waikato which the Kingite Māori considered their own land. Tamihana&#x27;s influence secured his safety at the start of the conflict when chief Rewi Maniapoto of the Ngāti Maniapoto tribe and his warriors attempted to kill Gorst. As Gorst was forewarned they made do by destroying the trade school, destroying a printing press and scaring all the settlers out of the Waikato where they had lived peacefully since 1830. This incident and the ambush and killing of British troops walking along a beach near New Plymouth, led to a restart of the war between the Māori King Movement and the New Zealand government in 1863. In 1884 he hosted the Māori King when he and his party came to England to seek an audience with Queen Victoria over issues to do with land. At that time Gorst was a member of the liberal Aborigine Protection League. In 1908 he published a volume of recollections, under the title of &quot;New Zealand Revisited: Recollections of the Days of my Youth&quot;.

==Political and legal career==
Gorst then returned to England and was called to the Bar, Inner Temple, in 1865, becoming a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1875. He stood unsuccessfully for Hastings as a Conservative in the 1865 general election, but the next year he entered parliament as member for Cambridge. He served as chairman of the inaugural meeting of the National Union of Conservative and Constitutional Associations in November 1867. He was not re-elected at the 1868 general election. After the Conservative defeat of that year Benjamin Disraeli entrusted him with the reorganization of the party machinery, and in five years of hard work he paved the way for the Conservative success at the general election of 1874.

At a by-election in 1875 Gorst reentered parliament as member for Chatham, which he continued to represent until 1892. He joined Sir Henry Drummond-Wolff, Lord Randolph Churchill and Arthur Balfour in the Fourth Party as an advocate of Tory democracy. When the Conservatives came to power in 1885 under Lord Salisbury he was made Solicitor-General and knighted. The government fell in January 1886 but when the Conservatives returned to office, in July of the same year, he was appointed Under-Secretary of State for India by Salisbury. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1890 and the following year he became Financial Secretary to the Treasury, a post he held until 1892. Between 1888 and 1891 he also served as deputy chairman of committees in the House of Commons.

At the general election of 1892 Gorst became one of the two members for Cambridge University. On the formation of the third Salisbury administration in 1895 he became Vice-President of the Committee on Education, which he remained until August 1902, when the post was renamed President of the Board of Education. However, he was never a member of the Cabinet. In 1897 he was rumoured to have been the next Governor of New Zealand, although Lord Ranfurly was chosen (and Gorst was said to have twice refused the Cape governorship, a more exalted position) .

Gorst remained committed to the principles of Tory democracy which he had advocated in the days of the Fourth Party, and continued take an active interest in the housing of the poor, the education and care of their children, and in social questions generally, both in parliament and in the press. However, he became exceedingly independent in his political action. In 1905 he contributed to Robert Morant&#x27;s dispute concerning a school inspection report by Katherine Bathurst about elementary education for under fives. The report&#x27;s outspokeness had been encouraged by Gorst who was trying to gain a revenge on Morant. This dispute resulted in Bathurst having to resign and for the ministry publishing her report but (unusually) with Morant&#x27;s apologies and annotations.

Gorst objected to Joseph Chamberlain&#x27;s proposals for tariff reform, and at the general election of 1906 he stood as an independent Free Trader, but came third, behind the two official Unionist candidates, and lost his seat. He then withdrew from the vice-chancellorship of the Primrose League, of which he had been one of the founders, on the ground that it no longer represented the policy of Benjamin Disraeli. In 1910 he contested Preston as a Liberal, but failed to secure election.

==Family==
Gorst married Mary Elizabeth Moore, daughter of Lorenzo Moore, in Geelong in 1860; they had met on the &quot;Red Jacket&quot; travelling from England to Melbourne. Their elder son, Sir Eldon Gorst, became Consul-General in Egypt. Gorst died in London in April 1916, aged 80, and lies buried in St Andrew&#x27;s churchyard, Castle Combe, Wilts. An account of his connection with Lord Randolph Churchill will be found in the &quot;Fourth Party&quot; (1906), by his younger son, Harold Edward Gorst.

His illegitimate older half brother was Edward Frankland.

<doc id="1013749" wikidata="Q2011029" url="?curid=1013749" title="Comprachicos">
<text>Comprachicos are groups in European folklore who were said to physically cripple and deform children to work as beggars or living curiosities. The most common methods said to be used in this practice included stunting children&#x27;s growth by physical restraint, muzzling their faces to deform them, slitting their eyes, dislocating their joints, and causing their bones to malform. The term, a compound Spanish neologism meaning &quot;child-buyers&quot;, was coined by Victor Hugo in &quot;The Man Who Laughs&quot;, an 1869 novel which triggered moral panics over supposed &quot;cripple factories&quot; across Europe. The words comprapequeños, cheylas and zaghles are also used. The resulting dwarfed and deformed adults made their living as mountebanks and freak show performers or were sold into bondage as pages, jesters, or court dwarfs.

==Historical references==
One of the common creations of the comprachicos was supposed to be artificial dwarfs, formed &quot;by anointing babies&#x27; spines with the grease of bats, moles and dormice&quot; and using drugs such as &quot;dwarf elder, knotgrass, and daisy juice&quot;. The conception was known to Shakespeare, as Beatrice K. Otto pointed out, quoting &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;:
Get you gone, dwarf;&lt;br&gt;You , of hindering knot-grass made;

Other means of creating this result were conjectured to include physical stunting by breaking or dislocating bones, and forcible constraint, whereby growth was inhibited for a long enough period to create permanent deformation. 

==Hugo==
Victor Hugo&#x27;s novel &quot;The Man Who Laughs&quot; is the story of a young aristocrat kidnapped and disfigured by his captors to display a permanent malicious grin. At the opening of the book, Hugo provides a description of the Comprachicos:

The Comprachicos worked on man as the Chinese work on trees. A sort of fantastic stunted thing left their hands; it was ridiculous and wonderful. They could touch up a little being with such skill that its father could not have recognized it. Sometimes they left the spine straight and remade the face. Children destined for had their joints dislocated in a masterly manner; thus gymnasts were made. Not only did the Comprachicos take away his face from the child; they also took away his memory. At least, they took away all they could of it; the child had no consciousness of the mutilation to which he had been subjected. Of burnings by sulphur and incisions by the iron he remembered nothing. The Comprachicos deadened the little patient by means of a stupefying powder which was thought to be magical and which suppressed all pain.

According to John Boynton Kaiser, &quot;Victor Hugo has given us a pretty faithful picture of many characteristic details of social England of the 17th century; but the word Comprachicos is used to describe a people whose characteristics are an unhistorical conglomeration of much that was once actual but then obsolete in the history of human society.&quot;

==Modern references==
The term &quot;comprachico&quot; is very uncommonly used in modern English except in reference or allusion to the antiquated folklore, but similar stories do exist in the English-speaking world. For instance, a tale circulating since at least the 1980s tells of a Japanese bride who disappears during her honeymoon in Europe; years later her husband discovers she has been abducted, mutilated, and forced to work in a freak show. The shock documentary &quot;Mondo Cane&quot; (1962) shows apparently actual criminals arrested for crippling children to be used as beggars. The novel &quot;Q &amp; A&quot; (2005) and its film adaptation &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; (2008) portrays a gang that blinds children to create beggars, something that is a known occurrence in some parts of India and China.

&quot;Comprachico&quot; has been adopted as a morbid or pejorative term used for individuals and entities who manipulate the minds and attitudes of children in a way that will permanently distort their beliefs or worldview. Twentieth-century philosopher Ayn Rand referred to educators of the time as &quot;the Comprachicos of the mind&quot; in her article &quot;The Comprachicos&quot;. Her criticism was targeted especially toward educational progressivists, but also grade-school and high-school educators who, in her view, used psychologically harmful methods of education.

James Ellroy refers to them and Victor Hugo&#x27;s novel in &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot;, where the concept is a major motivation for the murder of Elizabeth Short.

<doc id="1013754" wikidata="Q7075778" url="?curid=1013754" title="Occupation of the Gaza Strip by the United Arab Republic">
<text>The occupation of the Gaza Strip by the United Arab Republic began in 1959 following the dissolution of the All-Palestine Protectorate, which had ruled the Gaza Strip as a client state of Egypt since the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and its merger with the United Arab Republic.

The 1949 Armistice Agreements, which ended the Arab–Israeli War by delineating the Green Line as the armistice line between Israel and the Arab countries, left the Kingdom of Egypt in control of a small swath of territory that it had captured and occupied in the former British Mandate for Palestine, namely the Gaza Strip. This period saw the creation of the All-Palestine Government within the All-Palestine Protectorate, an Egyptian client state that lasted until 1959, a year after the Republic of Egypt and the Second Syrian Republic merged to form a single sovereign state known as the United Arab Republic. The Egyptian occupation of the Gaza Strip was briefly subsumed by Israel during the 1956 Suez Crisis and ended entirely during the 1967 Six-Day War, after which the territory becameoccupied by Israel with the establishment of the Israeli Military Governorate.

Ultimately dissolved by Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1959, the All-Palestine Government was largely symbolic since it was established in 1948, but nonetheless garnered diplomatic recognition from most members of the Arab League. Since the 1979 Egypt–Israel peace treaty, the official Egyptian position has supported the creation of an independent Palestinian state that encompasses the Gaza Strip in addition to the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

== Background ==
=== British Mandate ===
After the First World War, the League of Nations granted the United Kingdom authority over the Mandate for Palestine composed of former Ottoman territory, including the Gaza Strip. What became known as the British Mandate for Palestine was formally confirmed by the Council of the League of Nations on 24 July 1922 and which came into effect on 26 September 1923.

=== 1948 Arab–Israeli War ===
On 15 May 1948, just over three years after the end of the Second World War in Europe, the British Mandate for Palestine ended. Prior to this, on 29 November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly approved the 1947 UN Partition Plan to create in Palestine two states, one Jewish and one Arab. The 1947–1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine broke out in response. On 14 May 1948, David Ben-Gurion issued the Israeli Declaration of Independence and the following day the armies of Egypt, Jordan and Syria declared war and invaded, aided by soldiers sent from the Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq, starting the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Egypt made gains early in the war, but these were reversed in late December 1948 when the Israeli army, in &quot;Operation Horev&quot;, drove Egyptian forces out of the Negev Desert and encircled the Egyptian forces in the Gaza Strip, forcing Egypt to withdraw and accept a ceasefire. On 7 January 1949, a truce was achieved. Israeli forces proceeded to withdraw from Sinai and Gaza, leaving them to be occupied by Egypt.

=== Egypt&#x27;s All-Palestine Protectorate (1948–1959) ===
The All-Palestine Protectorate was an entity established by the Arab League on 22 September 1948, during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, purportedly to provide Palestinian governance for Palestine. After the war, the Gaza Strip was the only former-Mandate territory under the jurisdiction of the All-Palestine Government. However, the members of the Government were consequently removed to Cairo, and had little or no influence over events in the Gaza Strip.

On 24 February 1949, the Israel–Egypt Armistice Agreement was signed in Rhodes. Under the agreement, the armistice line was drawn along the international border (dating from 1906) except near the Mediterranean Sea, where the Kingdom of Egypt remained in control of a strip of land along the coast, which became known as the Gaza Strip. (See 1949 Armistice Agreements.)

According to Avi Shlaim:[T]he contrast between the pretensions of the All-Palestine Government and its capability quickly reduced it to the level of farce. It claimed jurisdiction over the whole of Palestine, yet it had no administration, no civil service, no money, and no real army of its own. Even in the small enclave around the town of Gaza its writ ran only by the grace of the Egyptian authorities. Taking advantage of the new government&#x27;s dependence on them for funds and protection, the Egyptian paymasters manipulated it to undermine Abdullah&#x27;s claim to represent the Palestinians in the Arab League and in international forums. Ostensibly the embryo for an independent Palestinian state, the new government, from the moment of its inception, was thus reduced to the unhappy role of a shuttlecock in the ongoing power struggle between Cairo and Amman.

==== Suez Crisis (1956) ====
The Egyptian monarchy was abolished in June 1953, with the Kingdom of Egypt being superseded by the Arab Republic of Egypt. In 1956, Egypt blockaded the Gulf of Aqaba, assumed national control of the Suez Canal, and blocked it to Israeli shipping—both threatening the young State of Israel and violating the Convention of Constantinople of 1888. France and the United Kingdom supported Israel in its determination that the canal should remain open to all nations as per the convention.

On 29 October 1956, Israel, France and the United Kingdom invaded the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula initiating the 1956 Suez War. Under international pressure, the Anglo-French Task Force withdrew before the end of 1956, and the Israeli army withdrew from the Sinai and Gaza in March 1957.

==History==
=== United Arab Republic (1958–1971) ===
In 1959, the Gaza Strip was officially merged into the short lived United Arab Republic (UAR, which united Egypt and Syria). In September 1961, Syria became an independent state again by withdrawing from the UAR. However, Egypt continued to be officially called the UAR up until 1971, when it was officially renamed as the Arab Republic of Egypt once again. In 1962, the UAR government established a Palestinian Legislative Council elected by the population. The constitutional document began with the following:
The Gaza Strip is an indivisible part of the land of Palestine and its people are part of the Arab Nation. The Palestinians in the Gaza
Strip shall form a National Union composed of all Palestinians wherever they may be - its aim being the joint work to recover the usurped lands of Palestine, and the participation in fulfilling the call of Arab Nationalism. The National Union shall be organised by a decree from the Governor-General.

When the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was founded in 1964, Nasser proclaimed that it would hold authority over Gaza, but that power was never granted in practice. A year later, conscription was instituted for the Palestinian Liberation Army (PLA).

==== 1967 Arab–Israeli War ====
On 5 June 1967, weeks after Egypt blockaded the Straits of Tiran and cut off Israeli shipping, Israel attacked Egypt, initiating the Six-Day War. It quickly defeated the surrounding Arab states and occupied the Gaza Strip, along with the West Bank and other territory, ending Egypt&#x27;s occupation.

=== Camp David Accords (1978) ===
In 1978, Israel and Egypt signed the historic Camp David Accords which brought an official end to the strife between them. The second part of the accords was a framework for the establishment of an autonomous regime in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The Arab Republic of Egypt thus renounced any territorial claims over the Gaza Strip.

=== Egypt–Israel peace treaty (1979) ===
In 1979, the Egypt–Israel peace treaty was signed. Egypt became the first Arab country to recognize Israel&#x27;s sovereignty and has since supported the two-state solution, advocating the creation of an independent Palestinian state encompassing the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, both of which have been under Israeli occupation since the 1967 war.

== Economy and demographics ==
The influx of over 200,000 refugees into Gaza during the 1948 war resulted in a dramatic decrease in the standard of living. Because the Egyptian government restricted movement to and from the Gaza Strip, its inhabitants could not look elsewhere for gainful employment. In 1955, one observer (a member of the United Nations Secretariat) noted that &quot;For all practical purposes it would be true to say that for the last six years in Gaza over 300,000 poverty stricken people have been physically confined to an area the size of a large city park.&quot;

<text>In Spanish grammar,  () is the use of as a second-person singular pronoun, along with its associated verbal forms, in certain regions where the language is spoken. In those regions it replaces , i.e. the use of the pronoun and its verbal forms. can also be found in the context of using verb conjugations for with as the subject pronoun (verbal voseo).

In all regions with , the corresponding unstressed object pronoun is and the corresponding possessive is .

 is used extensively as the second-person singular in Rioplatense Spanish (Argentina and Uruguay), Chilean Spanish, Eastern Bolivia, Paraguayan Spanish, and much of Central America (El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica); in Mexico, in the southern regions of Chiapas and parts of Oaxaca. It is rarely used, if at all, in places such as Cuba and Puerto Rico. 

 had been traditionally used in Argentina, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Paraguay, the Philippines and Uruguay, even in formal writing. In the dialect of Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay (known as &#x27;Rioplatense&#x27;), the usage of is prevalent, even in mainstream film, media and music. In Argentina, particularly from the second half of the 20th century, it has become very common to see billboards and other advertising campaigns using .

 is present in some regions of other countries, for instance in the Maracucho Spanish of Zulia State, Venezuela (see Venezuelan Spanish), the Azuero peninsula of Panama, in a few departments in Colombia, and in parts of Ecuador (Sierra down to Esmeraldas). In Peru, is present in certain Andean regions and Cajamarca, but the younger generations have ceased to use it. It is also present in Judaeo-Spanish, spoken by Sephardic Jews, where it is the archaic plural form that replaced.

 is seldom taught to students of Spanish as a second language, and its precise usage varies across different regions. Nevertheless, in recent years, it has become more commonly accepted across the Hispanophone world as a valid part of regional dialects.

==History==

Classical Latin, and the Vulgar Latin from which Romance languages such as Spanish are descended, had only two second-person pronounsthe singular and the plural . Starting in the early Middle Ages, however, languages such as French and Spanish began to attach honorary significance to these pronouns beyond literal number. Plural pronouns were often used to refer to a person of respect to aggrandize them. , the second-person plural inherited from Latin, came to be used in this manner.

Already by the late 18th century, however, itself was restricted to politeness among one&#x27;s familiar friends. The following extract from a textbook is illustrative of usage at the time:

The standard formal way to address a person one was not on familiar terms with was to address such a person as (&quot;your grace&quot;, originally abbreviated as ) in the singular and in the plural. Because of the literal meaning of these forms, they were accompanied by the corresponding third-person verb forms. Other formal forms of address included (&quot;your excellence&quot;, contracted phonetically to ) and (&quot;your lordship/ladyship&quot;, contracted to ). Today, both and are considered to be informal pronouns, with being somewhat synonymous with in regions where both are used. This was the situation when the Spanish language was brought to the Río de la Plata area (around Buenos Aires and Montevideo) and to Chile.

In time, lost currency in Spain but survived in a number of areas in Spanish-speaking America: Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia (east), Uruguay, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and some smaller areas; it is not found, or found only in internally remote areas (such as Chiapas) in the countries historically best connected with Spain: Mexico, Panama, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru and Equatorial Guinea. evolved into : ; in fact, is still abbreviated as either or ). Note that the term is a combined form of (meaning literally &#x27;ye/you others&#x27;), while the term comes from (&quot;we/us others&quot;).

In the first half of the 19th century, the use of was as prevalent in Chile as it was in Argentina. The current limitation of the use of in Chile is attributed to a campaign to eradicate it by the Chilean education system. The campaign was initiated by Andrés Bello who considered the use of a manifestation of lack of education.

==Usage==

===&quot;Vos&quot; in relation to other forms of &quot;tú&quot;===
The independent disjunctive pronoun also replaces , from the set of forms. That is, is both nominative and the form to use after prepositions. Therefore, (&quot;for you&quot;) corresponds to the form , etc.

The preposition-pronoun combination (&quot;with you&quot;) is used for the form .
The direct and indirect object form is used in both and .

The possessive pronouns of also coincide with &lt;, , &gt; rather than with &lt;, &gt;.

===&quot;Voseo&quot; in Chavacano===
Chavacano, a Spanish-based creole spoken in the Philippines, employs , while the standard Spanish spoken in the country does not. The Chavacano language below in comparison of other Chavacano dialects and level of formality with in both subject and possessive pronouns. Note the mixed and co-existing usages of , and .

===Conjugation with &quot;vos&quot;===
All modern conjugations derive from Old Spanish second person plural , , , and (as in , &#x27;you are&#x27;). The 14th and 15th centuries saw an evolution of these conjugations, with originally giving , giving (or ), giving , and giving . Soon analogous forms and appeared. Hence the variety of forms the contemporary American adopts, some varieties featuring a generalized monophthong (most of them), some a generalized diphthong (e.g. Venezuela), and some combining monophthongs and diphthongs, depending on the conjugation (e.g. Chile). In the most general, monophthongized, conjugation paradigm, a difference between forms and respective forms is visible exclusively in the present indicative, imperative and subjunctive, and, most of the time, in the &quot;preterite&quot;. Below is a comparison table of the conjugation of several verbs for and for , and next to them the one for , the informal second person plural currently used orally only in Spain; in oratory or legal language (highly formal forms of Spanish) it is used outside of Spain. Verb forms that agree with are stressed on the last syllable, causing the loss of the stem diphthong in those verbs, such as and , which are stem-changing.
General conjugation is the one that is most widely accepted and used in various countries such as Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, parts of Bolivia, Ecuador, and Colombia, as well as Central American countries.

Some Uruguayan speakers combine the pronoun &quot;tú&quot; with the &quot;vos&quot; conjugation (for example, &quot;tú sabés&quot;). Conversely, speakers in some other places where both &quot;tú&quot; and &quot;vos&quot; are used combine &quot;vos&quot; with the &quot;tú&quot; conjugation (for example, &quot;vos sabes&quot;). This is a frequent occurrence in the Argentine province of Santiago del Estero.

The verb forms employed with &quot;vos&quot; are also different in Chilean Spanish: Chileans use and &#x27;you are&#x27; instead of or and or . Chileans never pronounce these conjugations with a final &quot;-s&quot;. The forms for &#x27;you are&#x27;, and and for &#x27;you have&#x27; are also found in Chilean Spanish.

In the case of the ending &quot;-ís&quot; (such as in &quot;comís, podís, vivís, erís, venís&quot;), the final &quot;-s&quot; is pronounced like any other final in Chilean Spanish. It is most often pronounced as an aspiration similar to the &#x27;h&#x27; sound in English. It can also be pronounced as a fricative , or be dropped completely. Its variable pronunciation is a phonological rather than a morphological phenomenon.

Venezuelan Maracucho Spanish is notable in that they preserve the diphthongized plural verb forms in all tenses, as still used with &quot;vosotros&quot; in Spain. Chilean Spanish also notably uses the diphthong .

In Ladino, the &quot;-áis&quot;, &quot;-éis&quot;, &quot;-ís&quot;, &amp; &quot;-ois&quot; endings are pronounced , , , &amp; .

In Chile, it is much more usual to use &quot;tú&quot; + &quot;vos&quot; verb conjugation (tú sabís&quot;). The use of &quot;pronominal vos&quot; (vos sabís&quot;) is reserved for very informal situations and may even be considered vulgar in some cases.

==== Present indicative ====
# General conjugation: the final -r of the infinitive is replaced by -s; in writing, an acute accent is added to the last vowel (i.e. the one preceding the final -s) to indicate stress position.
# Chilean:
## the -ar ending of the infinitive is replaced by -ái
## both -er and -ir are replaced by -ís, which sounds more like &quot;-íh&quot;.
# Venezuelan (Zulian): practically the same ending as modern Spanish &quot;vosotros&quot;, yet with the final -s being aspirated so that: &quot;-áis&quot;, &quot;-éis&quot;, &quot;-ís&quot; sound like &quot;-áih&quot;, &quot;-éih&quot;, &quot;-íh&quot; (phonetically resembling Chilean).

Unlike &quot;tú&quot;, which has many irregular forms, the only &quot;voseo&quot; verbs that are conjugated irregularly in the indicative present are &quot;ser&quot;, &quot;ir&quot; and &quot;haber&quot;. However, &quot;haber&quot; is seldom used in the indicative present, since there is a strong tendency to use preterite instead of present perfect.

==== Affirmative imperative ====
&quot;Vos&quot; also differs in its affirmative imperative conjugation from both &quot;tú&quot; and &quot;vosotros&quot;. Specifically, the &quot;vos&quot; imperative is formed by dropping the final &quot;-r&quot; from the infinitive, but keeping the stress on the last syllable. The only verb that is irregular in this regard is &quot;ir&quot;; its &quot;vos&quot; imperative is not usually used, with &quot;andá&quot; (the &quot;vos&quot; imperative of &quot;andar&quot;, which is denoted by *) being generally used instead; except for the Argentine province of Tucumán, where the imperative &quot;ite&quot; is used. For most regular verbs ending in &quot;-ir&quot;, the &quot;vos&quot; imperatives use the same conjugations as the &quot;yo&quot; form in the preterite; almost all verbs that are irregular in the preterite (which are denoted by ‡) retain the regular &quot;vos&quot; imperative forms.

Again, the conjugation of &quot;tú&quot; has far more irregularities, whereas &quot;vos&quot; has only one irregular verb in the affirmative imperative.

In Chile, the general &quot;vos&quot; conjugation is not used in the affirmative imperative.

==== Subjunctive ====
In most places where &quot;voseo&quot; is used, it is applied also in the subjunctive. In the Río de la Plata region, both the &quot;tú&quot;-conjugation and the &quot;voseo&quot; conjugation are found, the &quot;tú-&quot;form being more common. In this variety, some studies have shown a pragmatic difference between the &quot;tú&quot;-form and the &quot;vos&quot;-form, such that the &quot;vos&quot; form carries information about the speaker&#x27;s belief state, and can be stigmatized. For example, in Central America the subjunctive and negative command form is &quot;no mintás&quot;, and in Chile it is &quot;no mintái&quot;; however, in Río de la Plata both &quot;no mientas&quot; and &quot;no mintás&quot; are found. &quot;Real Academia Española&quot; models its &quot;voseo&quot; conjugation tables on the most frequent, unstigmatized Río de la Plata usage and therefore omits the subjunctive &quot;voseo&quot;.

=== Verbal &quot;voseo&quot; and pronominal &quot;voseo&quot; ===
* &#x27;Verbal &quot;voseo&quot;″ refers to the use of the verb conjugation of &quot;vos&quot; regardless of which pronoun is used.
:Verbal &quot;voseo&quot; with a pronoun other than &quot;vos&quot; is widespread in Chile, in which case one would use the pronoun &quot;tú&quot; and the verb conjugation of &quot;vos&quot; at the same time. E.g.: &quot;tú venís&quot;, &quot;tú escribís&quot;, &quot;tú podís&quot;, &quot;tú sabís&quot;, &quot;tú vai&quot;, &quot;tú estái&quot;.
:There are some partially rare cases of a similar sort of verbal &quot;voseo&quot; in Uruguay where one would say for example &quot;tú podés&quot; or &quot;tú sabés&quot;.
* &#x27;Pronominal &quot;voseo&quot;″ is the use of the pronoun &quot;vos&quot; regardless of verb conjugation.

==Geographical distribution==
===Countries where &quot;voseo&quot; is predominant===


In South America:
# Argentina – both pronominal and verbal &quot;voseo&quot;, the pronoun &quot;tú&quot; is not preferred.
# Paraguay – both pronominal and verbal &quot;voseo&quot;, the pronoun &quot;tú&quot; is uncommon in most of the country.
# Uruguay – dual-usage of both pronominal and verbal &quot;voseo&quot; and a combination of the pronoun &quot;tú&quot; + verb conjugated in the &quot;vos&quot; form, except near the Brazilian border, where only pronominal and verbal &quot;tuteo&quot; is common.

In Central America:
# Guatemala – three-tiered system is used to indicate the degree of respect or familiarity: &quot;usted&quot;, &quot;tú&quot;, &quot;vos&quot;. &quot;Usted&quot; expresses distance and respect; &quot;tú&quot; corresponds to an intermediate level of familiarity, but not deep trust; &quot;vos&quot; is the pronoun of maximum familiarity and solidarity. Pronominal &quot;tú&quot; is frequent with verbal &quot;voseo&quot;.
# Honduras – three-tiered system is used to indicate the degree of respect or familiarity: &quot;usted&quot;, &quot;tú&quot;, &quot;vos&quot;. &quot;Usted&quot; expresses distance and respect; &quot;tú&quot; corresponds to an intermediate level of familiarity, but not deep trust; &quot;vos&quot; is the pronoun of maximum familiarity and solidarity.
# Nicaragua – both pronominal and verbal voseo throughout all social classes; &quot;tú&quot; is mostly used in writing&quot;.
# Costa Rica – &quot;voseo&quot; has historically been used, back in the 2000s it was losing ground to &quot;ustedeo&quot; and &quot;tuteo&quot;, especially among younger speakers. &quot;Vos&quot; is now primarily used orally with friends and family in Cartago, Guanacaste province, the San José metropolitan area and near the Nicaraguan border and in advertising signage. &quot;Usted&quot; is the primary form in other areas and with strangers. &quot;Tuteo&quot; is rarely used, but when it is used in speech by a Costa Rican, it is commonly considered fake and effeminate.
# El Salvador – three-tiered system is used to indicate the degree of respect or familiarity: &quot;usted&quot;, &quot;tú&quot;, &quot;vos&quot;. &quot;Usted&quot; expresses distance and respect; &quot;tú&quot; corresponds to an intermediate level of familiarity, but not deep trust; &quot;vos&quot; is the pronoun of maximum familiarity and solidarity and also lack of respect.

===Countries where &quot;voseo&quot; is extensive, but not predominant===
In South America:
# Bolivia – in the Lowlands of Eastern Bolivia—with mestizo, &quot;Criollo&quot; and German descendants majority—(Santa Cruz, Beni, Pando, Tarija and the Lowlands of La Paz) &quot;voseo&quot; is used universally; while in the Highlands of Western Bolivia—with indigenous peoples majority—(highlands of La Paz, Oruro, Potosí, Chuquisaca and Cochabamba) &quot;tú&quot; is predominant, but there is still a strong use of &quot;voseo&quot;, especially in verb forms.
# Chile – verbal &quot;voseo&quot; and pronominal &quot;tú&quot; is used in informal situations, whereas pronominal &quot;voseo&quot; is reserved only for very intimate situations or to offend someone. In every other situation and in writing, the normal &quot;tú&quot; or &quot;usted&quot; pronouns are used.

==Synchronic analysis of Chilean and River Plate verbal &quot;voseo&quot;==

The traditional assumption that the Chilean and River Plate &quot;voseo&quot; verb forms are derived from those corresponding to &quot;vosotros&quot; has been challenged as synchronically inadequate in a 2014 article, on the grounds that it requires at least six different rules, including three monophthongization processes that lacks phonological motivation. Alternatively, the article argues that the Chilean and River Plate &quot;voseo&quot; verb forms are synchronically derived from underlying representations that coincide with those corresponding to the non-honorific second person singular &quot;tú&quot;. In both Chilean and Rioplatense Spanish, the form assigns stress to the syllable following the verb&#x27;s root, or its infinitive in the case of the future and conditional conjugations. This alone derives all the Rioplatense verb conjugations, in all tenses. Chilean verb forms also undergo rules of semi-vocalization, vowel raising, and aspiration. In semi-vocalization, becomes the semivowel when after ; thus, becomes , and becomes &#x27;you are&#x27;. The vowel raising rule turns stressed into , so becomes . Aspiration, the norm in both Chilean and Rioplatense Spanish, means that syllable or word-final becomes pronounced like an .

The proposed theory requires the use of only one special rule in the case of Chilean &quot;voseo&quot;. This rule plus other rules that are independently justified in the language make it possible to synchronically derive all the Chilean and River Plate &quot;voseo&quot; verb forms in a straightforward manner. The article additionally solves the problem posed by the alternate verbal forms of Chilean &quot;voseo&quot; like the future indicative (e.g. &quot;bailaríh&quot; or &#x27;you will dance&#x27;), the present indicative forms of &quot;haber&quot; (&quot;habíh&quot; and &quot;hai&quot; &#x27;you have&#x27;), and the present indicative of &quot;ser&quot; (&quot;soi&quot;, &quot;eríh&quot; and &quot;eréi&quot; &#x27;you are&#x27;), without resorting to any ad hoc rules. All these different verb forms would come from different underlying representations. The future forms and come from underlying and , the latter related to the historical future form , which was documented in Chile in the 17th century. and come from and , while and come from and . The form also comes from , with additional semi-vocalization. The theoretical framework of the article is that of classic generative phonology.

==Attitudes==
In some countries, the pronoun &quot;vos&quot; is used with family and friends (T-form), like &quot;tú&quot; in other varieties of Spanish, and contrasts with the respectful &quot;usted&quot; (V-form used with third person) which is used with strangers, elderly, and people of higher socioeconomic status; appropriate usage varies by dialect. In Central America, &quot;vos&quot; can be used among those considered equals, while &quot;usted&quot; maintains its respectful usage. In Ladino, the pronoun &quot;usted&quot; is completely absent, so the use of &quot;vos&quot; with strangers and elders is the standard.

&quot;Voseo&quot; was long considered a backward or uneducated usage by prescriptivist grammarians. Many Central American intellectuals, themselves from nations, have condemned the usage of in the past. With the changing mentalities in the Hispanic world, and with the development of descriptive as opposed to prescriptive linguistics, it has become simply a local variant of Spanish. In some places it has become symbolically important and is pointed to with pride as a local defining characteristic.

<text>Bon-Bon Blanco (sometimes B3 or B3) is a Japanese rock group during 2002–2009. The group used to belong to Columbia Music Entertainment, but has moved to Bouncy Records in 2006.

==Members==
Its members are: 
* Anna Santos (サントス・アンナ &quot;Santosu Anna&quot;, born July 9, 1987) – Main Vocals
* Izumi (中台泉美 &quot;Nakadai Izumi&quot;, born January 2, 1988) – Conga
* Mako (桜井真子 &quot;Sakurai Mako&quot;, born October 7, 1986) – Maracas, ex-leader
* Ruri (水谷光里 &quot;Mizutani Ruri&quot;, born January 7, 1990) – Bongo
* Tomoyo (松本知世 &quot;Matsumoto Tomoyo&quot;, born March 2, 1987) – Timbales, current leader

==History==

===Formation of the group===
The group formed in 2002 with 4 members of a group named Nansho Kids: Mako Sakurai, Izumi Nakadai, Tomoyo Matsumoto, and Ruri Mizutani (sister of a famous actress, Yuri Mizutani) and added Santos Anna (who appeared in a Japanese version of &quot;Annie&quot;) as a vocalist and debuted at Bandai display corner at the Tokyo Toy Show in May of the same year. Their unique style, 4 percussionists and 1 vocalist, attracted a lot of attention from media in Japan even before they debuted. With an average age of 14 at the time of debut, they were also gracing the cover of music magazines. In June of the same year, their official Website “B3 TV” was opened.

===First single===
On July 17, 2002, they released their first single “Ai want you!!”. The song was written by Paninaro 30 (lyric) and ex-Wands Kosuke Oshima (music). During July 24 to August 28, they performed weekly concerts at a live house named Harajuku Ruido. The low cost of the cover (500 yen including drinks, roughly 5 dollars USD), the completeness of the performance, as well as the word of mouth helped to fill the house consistently.

The quality of their music had been assured because one of Japanese major record labels, Being, has been supporting them since their debut. And as the members started to improve in terms of their percussion skills, their popularity also shot up. On December 26, they had a concert at Harajuku Ruido again, and this time the live house was sold out within the same day. The door of the live house wouldn&#x27;t close due to the amount of audience.

During this period of time, a selection of songs were performed without instruments and was called &quot;Dance Version&quot;. This was met with a decent amount of critics approval, labeling them as a dance unit. With the improved abilities of the members, the frequency of the &quot;Dance Versions&quot; of the songs decreased, and there have been fans that wish to bring some of the dancing back.
===Smashing Hit===
The turning point had come in 2004. Their 6th single, &#x27;Bon Voyage&#x27; was used as a theme of a famous animation program, &#x27;One Piece&#x27;, and it became No. 8 at hit charts in Japan. And Bon-Bon Blanco&#x27;s name finally was recognized by a lot of people. And with 7th single, &#x27;Tenohira wo Taiyo ni&#x27;, they visited a lot of elementary schools, including the school Anna graduated. This song is the 4th cover song of the group after &#x27;Conga&#x27; from Miami Sound Machine and &#x27;Come to me&#x27; from Bobby Caldwell, And &#x27;Ureshii Tanoshii Daisuki&#x27; from Dreams Come True, all of which are included in their 2nd album, &#x27;B3 masterpieces 2002–2004&#x27;.

===Rise and Fall===
However, after the hit of &#x27;Bon Voyage&#x27;, the gap between the group aiming at and what fans require was widened graduately, and the sales of copies of each single descended along with that. And after they released &#x27;Ai ga ippai&#x27; in 2005, although the group was sometimes guested to some concerts including a musical named &#x27;Angel Gate&#x27;, they had to take a factual leave continued for one and half years.

===Revival===
On July 25, 2006, they had a concert at Shibuya Bpxx, and it was the beginning of their return. On August 30, they released &#x27;Yura Yura Yureru&#x27;, from a new record label set up by the producer of Bon-Bon Blanco, Bouncy Records. This is the song they performed in Angel Gate. In this song, and they renewed the group&#x27;s image changing their costumes from jeans and T-shirts to sexy bikinis. Anna challenged to rapping first time.

In 2007, the group started its activity from the concert held at Shibuya O-EAST on January 27. On February 21, they released their 11th single, &#x27;∞Changing∞. They had several free concerts in Akihabara from March to July. From July, they started monthly concert titled &#x27;Onnna Matsuri&#x27;(女祭) at Shibuya O-West. On February 6, 2008, their first live DVD which includes this &#x27;Onna Matsuri&#x27; was released.

===Present===
On May 14, 2008, Izumi left the group, and other members announced that they will continue their activity as a quartet on their official web site.

<text>Lynne Cox (born January 2, 1957) is an American long-distance open water swimmer, writer, and speaker. She is best known for being the first person to swim between the United States and the Soviet Union, in the Bering Strait, a feat which has been recognized for easing the Cold War tensions between U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.

==Achievements==
In 1971, she and her teammates were the first group of teenagers to complete the crossing of the Catalina Island Channel in California. She has twice held the record for the fastest crossing of the English Channel from England to France (1972 in a time of 9 hours 57 minutes and 1973 in a time of 9 hours 36 minutes). In 1975, Cox became the first woman to swim the , Cook Strait in New Zealand. In 1976, she was the first person to swim the Strait of Magellan in Chile, and the first to swim around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa.

Cox is perhaps best known for swimming 2 hour 6 minutes in the Bering Strait on August 7, 1987, from Little Diomede in Alaska to Big Diomede, then part of the Soviet Union, where the water temperature averaged around . At the time people living on the Diomede Islands, only apart, were not permitted to travel between them, although the Inuit communities there had been closely linked until the natives of Big Diomede were moved to the Russian mainland after World War II. Her accomplishment a few years before the end of the Cold War earned praise from both U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.

At the signing of the INF Missile Treaty at the White House, Gorbachev made a toast. He and President Reagan lifted their glasses and Gorbachev said: &quot;Last summer it took one brave American by the name of Lynne Cox just two hours to swim from one of our countries to the other. We saw on television how sincere and friendly the meeting was between our people and the Americans when she stepped onto the Soviet shore. She proved by her courage how close to each other our peoples live&quot;.

In May 1992, Lynne Cox swam in the Andean Lake Titicaca, which, at elevation, is considered the world&#x27;s highest navigable lake. While Titicaca&#x27;s water, at , is warmer than that of the Bering Strait, the high elevation and unidentified biting creatures offered an unusual challenge. The swimmer covered the distance of around 10 miles from Copacabana, Bolivia, to the village of Chimbo, Peru, in 3 hours 48 minutes. The Bolivian Navy provided support boats.

Another of her accomplishments was swimming more than a mile (1.6 km) in the waters of Antarctica. Cox was in the water for 25 min, swimming . Her book about the experience, &quot;Swimming to Antarctica&quot;, was published in 2004.

Her second book, &quot;Grayson&quot;, details her encounter with a lost baby gray whale during an early morning workout off the coast of California. It was published in 2006.

In August 2006, joined by local swimmers, Lynne Cox swam across the Ohio River in Cincinnati from the Serpentine Wall to Newport, Kentucky, to bring attention to plans to decrease the water-quality standards for the Ohio River.

In 2011, she published &quot;South with the Sun&quot;, both a biography of Roald Amundsen and a chronicle of her 2007 swimming expedition to Greenland, Baffin Island and Alaska, tracing Amundsen&#x27;s Northwest Passage expedition.

<doc id="1013768" wikidata="Q642141" url="?curid=1013768" title="LAPACK">
<text>LAPACK (&quot;Linear Algebra Package&quot;) is a standard software library for numerical linear algebra. It provides routines for solving systems of linear equations and linear least squares, eigenvalue problems, and singular value decomposition. It also includes routines to implement the associated matrix factorizations such as LU, QR, Cholesky and Schur decomposition. LAPACK was originally written in FORTRAN 77, but moved to Fortran 90 in version 3.2 (2008). The routines handle both real and complex matrices in both single and double precision. LAPACK relies on an underlying BLAS implementation to provide efficient and portable computational building blocks for its routines.

LAPACK was designed as the successor to the linear equations and linear least-squares routines of LINPACK and the eigenvalue routines of EISPACK. LINPACK, written in the 1970s and 1980s, was designed to run on the then-modern vector computers with shared memory. LAPACK, in contrast, was designed to effectively exploit the caches on modern cache-based architectures and the instruction-level parallelism of modern superscalar processors, and thus can run orders of magnitude faster than LINPACK on such machines, given a well-tuned BLAS implementation. LAPACK has also been extended to run on distributed memory systems in later packages such as ScaLAPACK and PLAPACK.

Netlib LAPACK is licensed under a three-clause BSD style license, a permissive free software license with few restrictions.

==Naming scheme==
Subroutines in LAPACK have a naming convention which makes the identifiers very compact. This was necessary as the first Fortran standards only supported identifiers up to six characters long, so the names had to be shortened to fit into this limit.

A LAPACK subroutine name is in the form codice_1, where:

* codice_2 is a one-letter code denoting the type of numerical constants used. codice_3, codice_4 stand for real floating-point arithmetic respectively in single and double precision, while codice_5 and codice_6 stand for complex arithmetic with respectively single and double precision. The newer version, LAPACK95, uses generic subroutines in order to overcome the need to explicitly specify the data type.
* codice_7 is a two-letter code denoting the kind of matrix expected by the algorithm. The codes for the different kind of matrices are reported below; the actual data are stored in a different format depending on the specific kind; e.g., when the code codice_8 is given, the subroutine expects a vector of length codice_9 containing the elements on the diagonal, while when the code codice_10 is given, the subroutine expects an array containing the entries of the matrix.
* codice_11 is a one- to three-letter code describing the actual algorithm implemented in the subroutine, e.g. codice_12 denotes a subroutine to solve linear system, while codice_13 denotes a rank-1 update.

For example, the subroutine to solve a linear system with a general (non-structured) matrix using real double-precision arithmetic is called codice_14.

==Use with other programming languages and libraries==
Many programming environments today support the use of libraries with C binding (LAPACKE, a standardised C interface, has been part of LAPACK since version 3.4.0), allowing LAPACK routines to be used directly so long as a few restrictions are observed. Additionally, many other software libraries and tools for scientific and numerical computing are built on top of LAPACK, such as R, MATLAB, and SciPy.

Several alternative language bindings are also available:

* Armadillo for C++
* IT++ for C++
* LAPACK++ for C++
* Lacaml for OCaml
* SciPy for Python
* Gonum for Go
* PDL::LinearAlgebra for Perl Data Language
* Math::Lapack for Perl
* NLapack for .NET
* CControl for C in embedded systems
* lapack for rust

== Implementations ==
As with BLAS, LAPACK is sometimes forked or rewritten to provide better performance on specific systems. Some of the implementations are:

; Accelerate: Apple&#x27;s framework for macOS and iOS, which includes tuned versions of BLAS and LAPACK.
; Netlib LAPACK: The official LAPACK.
; Netlib ScaLAPACK: Scalable (multicore) LAPACK, built on top of PBLAS.
; Intel MKL: Intel&#x27;s Math routines for their x86 CPUs.
; OpenBLAS: Open-source reimplementation of BLAS and LAPACK.
; Gonum LAPACK: A partial native Go implementation.

Since LAPACK typically calls underlying BLAS routines to perform the bulk of its computations, simply linking to a better-tuned BLAS implementation can be enough to significantly improve performance. As a result, LAPACK is not reimplemented as often as BLAS is.

=== Similar projects ===
These projects provide a similar functionality to LAPACK, but with a main interface differing from that of LAPACK: 

; Libflame: A dense linear algebra library. Has a LAPACK-compatible wrapper. Can be used with any BLAS, although BLIS is the preferred implementation.
; Eigen: A header library for linear algebra. Has a BLAS and a partial LAPACK implementation for compatibility.
; MAGMA: Matrix Algebra on GPU and Multicore Architectures (MAGMA) project develops a dense linear algebra library similar to LAPACK but for heterogeneous and hybrid architectures including multicore systems accelerated with GPGPUs.
; PLASMA: The Parallel Linear Algebra for Scalable Multi-core Architectures (PLASMA) project is a modern replacement of LAPACK for multi-core architectures. PLASMA is a software framework for development of asynchronous operations and features out of order scheduling with a runtime scheduler called QUARK that may be used for any code that expresses its dependencies with a directed acyclic graph.

<text>In finance, systemic risk is the risk of collapse of an entire financial system or entire market, as opposed to the risk associated with any one individual entity, group or component of a system, that can be contained therein without harming the entire system. It can be defined as &quot;financial &quot;system&quot; instability, potentially catastrophic, caused or exacerbated by idiosyncratic events or conditions in financial intermediaries&quot;. It refers to the risks imposed by &quot;interlinkages&quot; and &quot;interdependencies&quot; in a system or market, where the failure of a single entity or cluster of entities can cause a cascading failure, which could potentially bankrupt or bring down the entire system or market. It is also sometimes erroneously referred to as &quot;systematic risk&quot;.

==Explanation==
Systemic risk has been associated with a bank run which has a cascading effect on other banks which are owed money by the first bank in trouble, causing a cascading failure. As depositors sense the ripple effects of default, and liquidity concerns cascade through money markets, a panic can spread through a market, with a sudden flight to quality, creating many sellers but few buyers for illiquid assets. These interlinkages and the potential &quot;clustering&quot; of bank runs are the issues which policy makers consider when addressing the issue of protecting a system against systemic risk. Governments and market monitoring institutions (such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and central banks) often try to put policies and rules in place with the justification of safeguarding the interests of the market as a whole, claiming that the trading participants in financial markets are entangled in a web of dependencies arising from their interlinkage. In simple English, this means that some companies are viewed as too big and too interconnected to fail. Policy makers frequently claim that they are concerned about protecting the resiliency of the system, rather than any one individual in that system. Systemic risk arises because of the interaction of market participants, and therefore can be seen as a form of endogenous risk.

The risk management literature offers an alternative perspective to notions from economics and finance by distinguishing between the nature of systemic failure, its causes and effects, and the risk of its occurrence. It takes an &quot;operational behaviour&quot; approach to defining systemic risk of failure as: &quot;A measure of the overall probability at a current time of the system entering an operational state of systemic failure by a specified time in the future, in which the supply of financial services no longer satisfies demand according to regulatory criteria, qualified by a measure of uncertainty about the system&#x27;s future behaviour, in the absence of new mitigation efforts.&quot; This definition lends itself to practical risk mitigation applications, as demonstrated in recent research by a simulation of the collapse of the Icelandic financial system in circa 2008.

Systemic risk should not be confused with market or price risk as the latter is specific to the item being bought or sold and the effects of market risk are isolated to the entities dealing in that specific item. This kind of risk can be mitigated by hedging an investment by entering into a mirror trade.

Insurance is often easy to obtain against &quot;systemic risks&quot; because a party issuing that insurance can pocket the premiums, issue dividends to shareholders, enter insolvency proceedings if a catastrophic event ever takes place, and hide behind limited liability. Such insurance, however, is not effective for the insured entity.

One argument that was used by financial institutions to obtain special advantages in bankruptcy for derivative contracts was a claim that the market is both critical and fragile.

Systemic risk can also be defined as the likelihood and degree of negative consequences to the larger body. With respect to federal financial regulation, the systemic risk of a financial institution is the likelihood and the degree that the institution&#x27;s activities will negatively affect the larger economy such that unusual and extreme federal intervention would be required to ameliorate the effects.

A general definition of systemic risk which is not limited by its mathematical approaches, model assumptions or focus on one institution, and which is also the first operationalizable definition of systemic risk encompassing the systemic character of financial, political, environmental, and many other risks, was put forth in 2010.

The Systemic Risk Centre at the London School of Economics is focused on the study of systemic risk. It finds that systemic risk is a form of endogenous risk, hence frustrating empirical measurements of systemic risk.

==Measurement==

===TBTF/TCTF===
According to the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, there are two key assessments for measuring systemic risk, the &quot;too big to fail&quot; (TBTF) and the &quot;too (inter)connected to fail&quot; (TCTF or TICTF) tests. First, the TBTF test is the traditional analysis for assessing the risk of required government intervention. TBTF can be measured in terms of an institution&#x27;s size relative to the national and international marketplace, market share concentration, and competitive barriers to entry or how easily a product can be substituted. Second, the TCTF test is a measure of the likelihood and amount of medium-term net negative impact to the larger economy of an institution&#x27;s failure to be able to conduct its ongoing business. The impact is measure beyond the institution&#x27;s products and activities to include the economic multiplier of all other commercial activities dependent specifically on that institution. The impact is also dependent on how correlated an institution&#x27;s business is with other systemic risks.

====Too big to fail====
The traditional analysis for assessing the risk of required government intervention is the &quot;too big to fail&quot; test (TBTF). TBTF can be measured in terms of an institution&#x27;s size relative to the national and international marketplace, market share concentration (using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index for example), and competitive barriers to entry or how easily a product can be substituted. While there are large companies in most financial marketplace segments, the national insurance marketplace is spread among thousands of companies, and the barriers to entry in a business where capital is the primary input are relatively minor. The policies of one homeowners insurer can be relatively easily substituted for another or picked up by a state residual market provider, with limits on the underwriting fluidity primarily stemming from state-by-state regulatory impediments, such as limits on pricing and capital mobility. During the recent financial crisis, the collapse of the American International Group (AIG) posed a significant systemic risk to the financial system. There are arguably either no or extremely few insurers that are TBTF in the U.S. marketplace.

====Too connected to fail====

A more useful systemic risk measure than a traditional TBTF test is a &quot;too connected to fail&quot; (TCTF) assessment. An intuitive TCTF analysis has been at the heart of most recent federal financial emergency relief decisions. TCTF is a measure of the likelihood and amount of medium-term net negative impact to the larger economy of an institution&#x27;s failure to be able to conduct its ongoing business.

Network models have been proposed as a method for quantifying the impact of interconnectedness on systemic risk.

The impact is measured not just on the institution&#x27;s products and activities, but also the economic multiplier of all other commercial activities dependent specifically on that institution. It is also dependent on how correlated an institution&#x27;s business is with other systemic risk.

====Criticisms of systemic risk measurements====
&quot;Criticisms of systemic risk measurements:&quot; Danielsson et al. express concerns about systemic risk measurements, such as SRISK and CoVaR, because they are based on market outcomes that happen multiple times a year, so that the probability of systemic risk as measured does not correspond to the actual systemic risk in the financial system. Systemic financial crises happen once every 43 years for a typical OECD country and measurements of systemic risk should target that probability.

===SRISK===
A financial institution represents a systemic risk if it becomes undercapitalized when the financial system as a whole is undercapitalized. In a single risk factor model, Brownlees and Engle build a systemic risk measure named SRISK. SRISK can be interpreted as the amount of capital that needs to be injected into a financial firm as to restore a certain form of minimal capital requirement. SRISK has several nice properties: SRISK is expressed in monetary terms and is, therefore, easy to interpret. SRISK can be easily aggregated across firms to provide industry and even country specific aggregates. Last, the computation of SRISK involves variables which may be viewed on their own as risk measures. These are the size of the financial firm, the leverage (ratio of assets to market capitalization), and a measure of how the return of the firm evolves with the market (some sort of time varying conditional beta but with emphasis on the tail of the distribution).

Whereas the initial Brownlees and Engle model is tailored to the US market, the extension by Engle, Jondeau, and Rockinger is more suitable for the European markets. One factor captures worldwide variations of financial markets, another one the variations of European markets. This extension allows for a country-specific factor.

By accounting for different factors, one captures the notion that shocks to the US or Asian markets may affect Europe, but also that bad news within Europe (such as the news about a potential default of one of the countries) matters for Europe. Also, there may be country specific news that does not affect Europe or the US, but matters for a given country. Empirically the last factor is less relevant than the worldwide or European factor.

Since SRISK is measured in terms of currency, the industry aggregates may also be related to Gross Domestic Product. As such one obtains a measure of domestic, systemically important banks.

The SRISK Systemic Risk Indicator is computed automatically on a weekly basis and made available to the community. For the US model, SRISK and other statistics may be found under the Volatility Lab of NYU Stern School website and for the European model under the Center of Risk Management (CRML) website of HEC Lausanne.

====Pair/vine copulas====
A vine copula can be used to model systemic risk across a portfolio of financial assets. One methodology is to apply the Clayton Canonical Vine Copula to model asset pairs in the vine structure framework. As a Clayton copula is used, the greater the degree of asymmetric (i.e., left tail) dependence, the higher the Clayton copula parameter. Therefore, one can sum up all the Clayton Copula parameters, and the higher the sum of these parameters, the greater the impending likelihood of systemic risk. This methodology has been found to detect spikes in the US equities markets in the last four decades capturing the Oil Crisis and Energy Crisis of the 1970s, Black Monday and the Gulf War in the 1980s, the Russian Default/LTCM crisis of the 1990s, and the Technology Bubble and Lehman Default in the 2000s. Manzo and Picca introduce the t-Student Distress Insurance Premium (tDIP), a copula-based method that measures systemic risk as the expected tail loss on a credit portfolio of entities, in order to quantify sovereign as well as financial systemic risk in Europe.

==Valuation of assets and derivatives under systemic risk==

===Inadequacy of classic valuation models===
One problem when it comes to the valuation of derivatives, debt, or equity under systemic risk is that financial interconnectedness has to be modelled. One particular problem is posed by closed valuations chains, as exemplified here for four firms A, B, C, and D:

:B might hold shares of A, C holds some debt of B, D owns a derivative issued by C, and A owns some debt of D.

For instance, the share price of A could influence all other asset values, including itself.

====The Merton (1974) model====
Situations as the one explained earlier, which are present in mature financial markets, cannot be modelled within the single-firm Merton model, but also not by its straightforward extensions to multiple firms with potentially correlated assets. To demonstrate this, consider two financial firms, formula_1, with limited liability, which both own system-exogenous assets of a value formula_2 at a maturity formula_3, and which both owe a single amount of zero coupon debt formula_4, due at time formula_5. &quot;System-exogenous&quot; here refers to the assumption, that the business asset formula_6 is not influenced by the firms in the considered financial system.
In the classic single firm Merton model, it now holds at maturity for the equity formula_7 and for the recovery value formula_8 of the debt, that

:formula_9

and

:formula_10

Equity and debt recovery value, formula_11 and formula_12, are thus uniquely and immediately determined by the value formula_6 of the exogenous business assets. Assuming that the formula_6 are, for instance, defined by a Black-Scholes dynamic (with or without correlations), risk-neutral no-arbitrage pricing of debt and equity is straightforward.

====Non-trivial asset value equations====
Consider now again two such firms, but assume that firm 1 owns 5% of firm two&#x27;s equity and 20% of its debt. Similarly, assume that firm 2 owns 3% of firm one&#x27;s equity and 10% of its debt. The equilibrium price equations, or liquidation value equations, at maturity are now given by

:formula_15
:formula_16
:formula_17 
:formula_18

This example demonstrates, that systemic risk in the form of financial interconnectedness can already lead to a non-trivial, non-linear equation system for the asset values if only two firms are involved.

====Over- and underestimation of default probabilities====
It is known that modelling credit risk while ignoring cross-holdings of debt or equity can lead to an under-, but also an over-estimation of default probabilities. The need for proper structural models of financial interconnectedness in quantitative risk management – be it in research or practice – is therefore obvious.

===Structural models under financial interconnectedness===
The first authors to consider structural models for financial systems where each firm could own the debt of other firms were Eisenberg and Noe in 2001. Suzuki (2002) extended the analysis of interconnectedness by modeling the cross ownership of both debt and equity claims. Building on Eisenberg and Noe (2001), Cifuentes, Ferrucci, and Shin (2005) considered the effect of costs of default on network stability. Elsinger&#x27;s further developed the Eisenberg and Noe (2001) model by incorporating financial claims of differing priority.

Acemoglu, Ozdaglar, and Tahbaz-Salehi, (2015) developed a structural systemic risk model incorporating both distress costs and debt claim with varying priorities and used this model to examine the effects of network interconnectedness on financial stability. They showed that, up to a certain point, interconnectedness enhances financial stability. However, once a critical threshold density of connectedness is exceeded, further increases in the density of the financial network propagate risk.

Glasserman and Young (2015) applied the Eisenberg and Noe (2001) to modelling the effect of shocks to banking networks. They develop general bounds for the effects of network connectivity on default probabilities. In contrast to most of the structural systemic risk literature, their results are quite general and do not require assuming a specific network architecture or specific shock distributions.

===Risk-neutral valuation: price indeterminacy and open problems===
Generally speaking, risk-neutral pricing in structural models of financial interconnectedness requires unique equilibrium prices at maturity in dependence of the exogenous asset price vector, which can be random.
While financially interconnected systems with debt and equity cross-ownership without derivatives are fairly well understood in the sense that relatively weak conditions on the ownership structures in the form of ownership matrices are required to warrant uniquely determined price equilibria, the Fischer (2014) model needs very strong conditions on derivatives – which are defined in dependence on any other liability of the considered financial system – to be able to guarantee uniquely determined prices of all system-endogenous liabilities. Furthermore, it is known that there exist examples with no solutions at all, finitely many solutions (more than one), and infinitely many solutions. At present, it is unclear how weak conditions on derivatives can be chosen to still be able to apply risk-neutral pricing in financial networks with systemic risk. It is noteworthy, that the price indeterminacy that evolves from multiple price equilibria is fundamentally different from price indeterminacy that stems from market incompleteness.

==Factors==
Factors that are found to support systemic risks are:
# Economic implications of models are not well understood. Though each individual model may be made accurate, the facts that (1) all models across the board use the same theoretical basis, and (2) the relationship between financial markets and the economy is not known lead to aggravation of systemic risks.
# Liquidity risks are not accounted for in pricing models used in trading on the financial markets. Since all models are not geared towards this scenario, all participants in an illiquid market using such models will face systemic risks.

==Diversification==
Risks can be reduced in four main ways: avoidance, diversification, hedging and insurance by transferring risk. Systematic risk, also called market risk or un-diversifiable risk, is a risk of a security that cannot be reduced through diversification. Participants in the market, like hedge funds, can be the source of an increase in systemic risk and the transfer of risk to them may, paradoxically, increase the exposure to systemic risk.

Until recently, many theoretical models of finance pointed towards the stabilizing effects of a
diversified (i.e., dense) financial system. Nevertheless, 
some recent work has started to
challenge this view, investigating conditions under which diversification may have ambiguous effects on systemic risk.
Within a certain range, financial interconnections serve as a
shock-absorber (i.e., connectivity engenders robustness and risk-sharing prevails). But beyond the tipping
point, interconnections might serve as a shock-amplifier (i.e., connectivity engenders fragility and risk-spreading
prevails).

==Regulation==
One of the main reasons for regulation in the marketplace is to reduce systemic risk. However, regulation arbitrage – the transfer of commerce from a regulated sector to a less regulated or unregulated sector – brings markets a full circle and restores systemic risk. For example, the banking sector was brought under regulations in order to reduce systemic risks. Since the banks themselves could not give credit where the risk (and therefore returns) were high, it was primarily the insurance sector which took over such deals. Thus the systemic risk migrated from one sector to another and proves that regulation of only one industry cannot be the sole protection against systemic risks.

==Project risks==
In the fields of project management and cost engineering, systemic risks include those risks that are not unique to a particular project and are not readily manageable by a project team at a given point in time. They are caused by micro or internal factors i.e. uncertainty resulting from attributes of the project system/culture. Some use the term inherent risk. These systemic risks are called individual project risks e.g. in PMI PMBOK(R) Guide. These risks may be driven by the nature of a company&#x27;s project system (e.g., funding projects before the scope is defined), capabilities, or culture. They may also be driven by the level of technology in a project or the complexity of a project&#x27;s scope or execution strategy. One recent example of systemic risk is the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, which sent shockwaves throughout the financial system and the economy. In contrast, those risks that are unique to a particular project are called overall project risks aka systematic risks in finance terminology. They are project-specific risks which are sometimes called contingent risks, or risk events. These systematic risks are caused by uncertainty in macro or external factors of the external environment. &quot;The Great Recession&quot; of the late 2000s is an example of systematic risk. Overall project risks are determined using PESTLE, VUCA, etc.

PMI PMBOK(R) Guide defines individual project risk as &quot;an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on one or more project objectives,&quot; whereas overall project risk is defined as &quot;the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole … more than the sum of individual risks within a project, since it includes all sources of project uncertainty … represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome, both positive and negative.&quot;

==Systemic risk and insurance==
In February 2010, international insurance economics think tank, The Geneva Association, published a 110-page analysis of the role of insurers in systemic risk.

In the report, the differing roles of insurers and banks in the global financial system and their impact on the crisis are examined (See also CEA report, &quot;Why Insurers Differ from Banks&quot;). A key conclusion of the analysis is that the core activities of insurers and reinsurers do not pose systemic risks due to the specific features of the industry:
* Insurance is funded by up-front premia, giving insurers strong operating cash-flow without the requirement for wholesale funding;
* Insurance policies are generally long-term, with controlled outflows, enabling insurers to act as stabilisers to the financial system;
* During the hard test of the financial crisis, insurers maintained relatively steady capacity, business volumes and prices.

Applying the most commonly cited definition of systemic risk, that of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), to the core activities of insurers and reinsurers, the report concludes that none are systemically relevant for at least one of the following reasons:
* Their limited size means that there would not be disruptive effects on financial markets;
* An insurance insolvency develops slowly and can often be absorbed by, for example, capital raising, or, in a worst case, an orderly wind down;
* The features of the interrelationships of insurance activities mean that contagion risk would be limited.

The report underlines that supervisors and policymakers should focus on activities rather than financial institutions when introducing new regulation and that upcoming insurance regulatory regimes, such as Solvency II in the European Union, already adequately address insurance activities.

However, during the financial crisis, a small number of quasi-banking activities conducted by insurers either caused failure or triggered significant difficulties. The report therefore identifies two activities which, when conducted on a widespread scale without proper risk control frameworks, have the potential for systemic relevance.
* Derivatives trading on non-insurance balance sheets;
* Mis-management of short-term funding from commercial paper or securities lending.

The industry has put forward five recommendations to address these particular activities and strengthen financial stability:
* The implementation of a comprehensive, integrated and principle-based supervision framework for insurance groups, in order to capture, among other things, any non-insurance activities such as excessive derivative activities.
* Strengthening liquidity risk management, particularly to address potential mis-management issues related to short-term funding.
* Enhancement of the regulation of financial guarantee insurance, which has a very different business model than traditional insurance.
* The establishment of macro-prudential monitoring with appropriate insurance representation.
* The strengthening of industry risk management practices to build on the lessons learned by the industry and the sharing experiences with supervisors on a global scale.

Since the publication of The Geneva Association statement, in June 2010, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) issued its position statement on key financial stability issues. A key conclusion of the statement was that, &quot;The insurance sector is susceptible to systemic risks generated in other parts of the financial sector. For most classes of insurance, however, there is little evidence of insurance either generating or amplifying systemic risk, within the financial system itself or in the real economy.&quot;

Other organisations such as the CEA and the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America (PCI) have issued reports on the same subject.

==Discussion==
Systemic risk evaluates the likelihood and degree of negative consequences to the larger body. The term &quot;systemic risk&quot; is frequently used in recent discussions related to the economic crisis, such as the Subprime mortgage crisis. The systemic risk of a financial institution is the likelihood and the degree that the institution&#x27;s activities will negatively affect the larger economy such that unusual and extreme federal intervention would be required to ameliorate the effects. The failing of financial firms in 2008 caused systemic risk to the larger economy. Chairman Barney Frank has expressed concerns regarding the vulnerability of highly leveraged financial systems to systemic risk and the US government has debated how to address financial services regulatory reform and systemic risk.

A series of empirical studies published between the 1990s and 2000s showed that deregulation and increasingly fierce competition lowers bank&#x27;s profit margin and encourages the moral hazard to take excessive credit risks to increase profits. On the other hand, the same effect was measured in presence of a banking oligopoly in which banking sector was dominated by a restricted number of market operators encouraged by their market share and contractual power to set higher loan mean rates. An excessive number of market operators was sometimes deliberately introduced with a below market value selling to cause a price war and a wave of bank massive failures, subsequently degenerating in the creation a market cartel: those two phases had been seen as expressions of the same interest to collude at generally lower prices (and then higher), resulting possible because of a lack of regulation ordered to prevent both of them.
Banks are the entities most likely to be exposed to valuation risk as a result of their massive holdings of financial instruments classified as Level 2 or 3 of the fair value hierarchy. In Europe, at the end of 2020 the banks under the direct supervision of the European Central Bank (ECB) held fair-valued financial instruments in an amount of €8.7 trillion, of which €6.6 trillion classified as Level 2 or 3. Level 2 and Level 3 instruments respectively amounted to 495% and 23% of the banks&#x27; highest-quality capital (so-called Tier 1 Capital). As an implication, even small errors in such financial instruments&#x27; valuations may have significant impacts on banks&#x27; capital.

In February 2020 the European Systemic Risk Board warned in a report that substantial amounts of financial instruments with complex features and limited liquidity that sit in banks&#x27; balance sheets are a source of risk for the stability of the global financial system. In Europe, at the end of 2020 the banks under the direct supervision of the European Central Bank (ECB) held financial instruments subject to fair value accounting in an amount of €8.7 trillion. Of these, €6.6 trillion were classified as Level 2 or 3 in the so-called Fair Value Hierarchy, which means that they are potentially exposed to valuation risk, i.e. to uncertainty about their actual market value. Level 2 and Level 3 instruments respectively amounted to 495% and 23% of the banks&#x27; highest-quality capital (so-called Tier 1 Capital). As an implication, even small errors in such financial instruments&#x27; valuations may have significant impacts on banks&#x27; capital.

<text>is a Japanese alternative rock group from Sakura, Chiba. The band members are Motoo Fujiwara (vocals, rhythm), Hiroaki Masukawa (guitar), Yoshifumi Naoi (bass) and Hideo Masu (drums). Since their conception in 1994, they have released 28 singles and 10 albums. They are a popular group in Japan; every release since their third single, &quot;Tentai Kansoku&quot;, has charted in the top ten on the Oricon Weekly Charts. Their music has been used in various video games and as theme songs for movies, television shows and anime in Japan.

== History ==
The members first met in kindergarten and were classmates throughout their primary and secondary education. Bump of Chicken&#x27;s first performance was in 1994, during their ninth grade cultural festival, playing a cover of The Beatles&#x27; version of &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;. In 1996, their song &quot;Danny&quot; won an award on 96TFM. The band&#x27;s name translates literally from Japanese as &quot;counterattack from the weak man.&quot;

In 1999, Bump of Chicken released their first album, &quot;Flame Vein&quot;, on High Line Records. Later that year, they released their first single, &quot;Lamp&quot;. In 2000, they released &quot;The Living Dead&quot;, their final release on High Line. They also held their first live tour, &quot;&quot;, during March and April.

Later in 2000, the group switched to Toy&#x27;s Factory, releasing their first single on the label, &quot;Diamond&quot;, in September. Bump of Chicken&#x27;s first big success occurred when their single, &quot;Tentai Kansoku&quot;, appeared on the Oricon Weekly Charts in 2001. They held two live tours, &quot; 2001&quot; beginning in March and &quot;Surf Porkin&#x27;&quot; beginning in July. In October, they released &quot;Harujion&quot;. They released their first album on Toy&#x27;s Factory, &quot;Jupiter&quot;, in February 2002 and it was their first number one on the Oricon Weekly Charts. In the summer of 2002, their music was featured on the Japanese TV drama &quot;Tentai Kansoku&quot;, giving them more exposure.

At the end of 2002, the group released the single &quot;Snow Smile&quot;. 2003 saw the release of their first double A-side single &quot;Lost Man/Sailing day&quot;. &quot;Sailing Day&quot; was used as the ending theme to the animated movie &quot;One Piece: Dead End Adventure&quot;. The beginning of 2004 saw a slew of re-releases. &quot;Arue&quot;, from their album &quot;Flame Vein&quot;, was released as a single in March. They re-released their first two albums in April. &quot;Flame Vein&quot; received an extra song and was re-released as &quot;Flame Vein +1&quot;. &quot;The Living Dead&quot; received no modifications. In July, the group released &quot;Only Lonely Glory&quot;, which became their first single to chart at number one on the Oricon Weekly Charts. A month later, they released their fourth album, &quot;Yggdrasil&quot;, which was their second album to reach number one on the Oricon Weekly Charts. Shortly after, they released &quot;Sharin no Uta&quot;, from &quot;Yggdrasil&quot;, as a single.

In 2005, Bump of Chicken released two singles, &quot;Planetarium&quot; and second double A-side single &quot;Supernova/Karma&quot;. Karma was used as the theme song for Namco&#x27;s &quot;Tales of the Abyss&quot;. The band&#x27;s next single, &quot;Namida no Furusato&quot; was used in a commercial for Lotte Airs. It became the group&#x27;s second number one single. In 2007, they released the singles &quot;Hana no Na&quot; and &quot;Mayday&quot; on the same day. The two singles reached number one and two respectively on the Oricon Weekly Charts. Bump of Chicken released their fifth studio album, &quot;Orbital Period&quot;, on December 19, 2007. They released their first compilation album &quot;present from you&quot; on June 18, 2008. This album contains b-sides from singles and other non-album tracks.

On November 25, 2009, Bump of Chicken released its third double A-side single &quot;R.I.P./Merry Christmas&quot;, their first single in two years. On April 14, 2010, they released &quot;Happy&quot; and then in the following week, another single, &quot;Mahō no Ryōri (Kimi kara Kimi e)&quot;. These two singles also reached number one consecutively for two weeks on the Oricon Weekly Charts, the first time a band achieved this since Orange Range&#x27;s &quot;Love Parade&quot; and &quot;Onegai! Señorita&quot; in 2005. They released a fourth double A-side single &quot;Uchūhikōshi e no Tegami/Motorcycle&quot; on October 13, 2010, and they released a music video for the song on Toy&#x27;s Factory&#x27;s YouTube channel on September 14, 2010, which surpassed 200,000 views in two days. On December 15, 2010, they released their sixth studio album, &quot;Cosmonaut&quot;, but it did not feature the song &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;.

In 2011, Bump of Chicken announced that they wrote the song &quot;Tomodachi no Uta&quot; as the theme song for the animated 3D movie &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Tomodachi no Uta&quot; was released as the single on February 23, 2011. They also released two singles, &quot;Smile&quot; on May 11, 2011, and &quot;Zero&quot; on October 19, 2011. &quot;Zero&quot; was used as the theme song for video game by Square Enix, &quot;Final Fantasy Type-0&quot;. Also in 2012, they released two more singles &quot;Good Luck&quot; and &quot;Firefly&quot;, in January and September 2012, respectively. &quot;Good Luck&quot; was featured as the end theme to the Japanese film Always Sanchōme no Yūhi &#x27;64.

On March 6, 2013, Bump of Chicken released their first live video and album &quot;Bump of Chicken Gold Glider Tour 2012&quot;, recorded live at the Yoyogi National Gymnasium, Tokyo, Japan, on July 3, 2012.
