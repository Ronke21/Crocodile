<text>John Wolyniec (born January 24, 1977) is an American professional soccer coach, executive, and former player. He is currently the technical director of the San Jose Earthquakes.

During his playing days, Wolyniec played for Major League Soccer club New York Red Bulls three separate times: In 1999 as the MetroStars, from 2003 to 2005 as the MetroStars, and from 2006 until he retired in 2010. He also played for MLS clubs Chicago Fire, Columbus Crew, and Los Angeles Galaxy. He also played for USL A-League clubs Rochester Raging Rhinos and the Milwaukee Rampage, winning titles with them in 2001 and 2002 respectively. Wolyniec also represented the United States national team in 2004, earning two caps.

After retiring as a player, Wolyniec was appointed head coach of New York Red Bulls II, the reserve side for the New York Red Bulls. In his second season as head coach, Wolyniec guided Red Bulls II to both the regular season and championship titles.

==Youth and amateur==
Wolyniec is native of Staten Island, New York City and attended Monsignor Farrell High School before playing four years of college soccer at Fordham University, where he led the nation in goals in 1998. He is of Polish descent.

==Playing career==

===Professional===
Wolyniec was drafted by the MetroStars as the seventh–pick overall in the 1999 MLS College Draft. However, despite being a high pick, he was cut before playing any games. Wolyniec then signed with the Long Island Rough Riders of the A-League and led the team in goals. In the midst of the worst season in league history, the MetroStars called him up for a late-season stretch and he promptly scored in his first game with the team.

In 2000, the Chicago Fire re-drafted Wolyniec with the 44th overall pick of the 2000 MLS SuperDraft. That season, the Fire sent him on loan with the MLS Project-40 and the Milwaukee Rampage where he scored three goals in four games. Back with the Fire, he scored just one goal all year, and, after scoring one early in 2001, was traded to the New England Revolution for Eric Wynalda. Wolyniec was cut after he playing one game. He spent the next two years in the A-League, with the Rochester Raging Rhinos in 2001 and with the Milwaukee Rampage in 2002. He was named league MVP during his time with the Rampage.

In 2003, then MetroStars head coach Bob Bradley re-acquired Wolyniec in the MLS supplemental draft. Wolyniec came into his own during his second stint with the team, scoring a number of key goals, including two overtime game-winners and a late winner in the U.S. Open Cup semifinals against D.C. United. He finished the year with five MLS goals (seven in all competitions).

On May 26, 2004, Wolyniec scored two goals and assisted on another in a 3–1 victory over Boavista F.C. of the Portuguese Liga. Even as the team signed a trio of foreign strikers in 2004, he kept his starting place, scored ten goals to tie for the team lead, and began to mature into a team leader. But after scoring two goals in eight games in 2005, he was traded to the Columbus Crew in exchange for prolific scorer Ante Razov.

After scoring three goals for the Crew, Wolyniec was dealt in May 2006 to Los Angeles Galaxy in a four-player deal. In August, he was traded again, joining New York Red Bulls for his third stint with the club formerly known as MetroStars.

The 2007 and 2008 seasons saw Wolyniec primarily as a reserve player for New York, managing to score 3 goals in 21 appearances in 2007 and being held scoreless in 19 regular season appearances in 2008. With the Red Bulls barely qualifying for the 2008 MLS Playoffs, Coach Juan Carlos Osorio surprisingly inserted Wolyniec into the starting lineup for the club&#x27;s first leg match against the defending champion Houston Dynamo, Wolyniec would assist on Juan Pablo Angel&#x27;s goal in a match that ended 1-1. With New York needing a victory to advance out of the first round for the second time in team history, Osorio repeated the same lineup that drew 1-1. Wolyniec was again a key figure scoring the third goal in a 3–0 rout of Houston in Robertson Stadium. Wolyniec continued his fine play in the Western Conference Final, helping set up the Red Bulls&#x27; lone goal in the 1–0 victory over Real Salt Lake, and thus advancing to the club&#x27;s first ever MLS Cup Final. In the MLS Cup Final, Wolyniec scored the Red Bulls lone goal in a 3–1 loss to the Columbus Crew. During the 2009 season Wolyniec was the only New York player to score in all competitions that the club participated in (League, US Open Cup, CONCACAF Champions League). On May 12, 2010, Wolyniec had his first multi-goal game for the New York Red Bulls scoring two goals in a 3–0 victory over New England Revolution in a 2010 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup qualification match. On May 26, 2010, Wolyniec recorded another two goals in a 3–0 victory over Colorado Rapids leading the club to the Round of 16 of the 2010 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup.

Wolyniec was waived by New York on July 30, 2010, to make room on the roster for new signing Thierry Henry. On September 9, 2010, Wolyniec announced his retirement from professional soccer in order to take a position in the Red Bull Academy. Wolyniec ended his Red Bulls career beloved by supporters and ranks among the all-time club leaders in games played. On February 15, 2013, was promoted to Reserve Team Coach/Player Development Coordinator by the club.

===International===
Wolyniec earned a call-up to the U.S. national team in 2004, getting his first cap against Denmark on January 18, 2004. He earned a total of two caps.

==Coaching career==
===New York Red Bulls II===
Wolyniec was appointed as the inaugural head coach of New York Red Bulls II on March 2, 2015. His first match as head coach was against his former club as a player, Rochester Rhinos, on March 28. The match ended as a 0–0 draw. In 2016, in his second season as head coach, Wolyniec lead New York Red Bulls II to both the regular season and championship titles. Wolyniec stepped down as Red Bulls II coach on December 10, 2021.

<doc id="1041671" wikidata="Q284553" url="?curid=1041671" title="Convention of 1800">
<text>The Convention of 1800, also known as the Treaty of Mortefontaine (French: &quot;Traité de Mortefontaine&quot;), was signed on September 30, 1800, by the United States and France. The difference in name was due to congressional sensitivity at entering into treaties, due to disputes over the 1778 treaties of Alliance and Commerce between France and the U.S.

The Convention terminated the 1778 agreements, confirmed the principle of &#x27;free trade, free goods&#x27; between the two countries and ended the 1798–1800 Quasi-War, an undeclared naval war waged primarily in the Caribbean. However, it failed to address the issue of compensation demanded by American ship owners for losses suffered before and during the Quasi-War, and as a result was not approved by Congress until December 1801.

By removing areas of friction between the two countries, it re-established Franco-American relations, and ultimately facilitated the 1803 Louisiana Purchase.

==Background==

Under the Treaty of Alliance, in return for support in the American Revolutionary War, the United States agreed to defend French interests in the Caribbean. As the treaty had no termination date, this included protecting them from Great Britain and the Dutch Republic during the 1792–1797 War of the First Coalition. Despite popular enthusiasm for the French Revolution, there was little support for this in Congress; neutrality allowed Northern shipowners to earn huge profits evading the British blockade, and Southern plantation-owners feared the example set by France&#x27;s abolition of slavery in 1794.

Arguing the 1793 execution of King Louis XVI voided existing agreements, the Neutrality Act of 1794 unilaterally cancelled the military obligations of the 1778 treaty. France accepted, on the basis of &quot;benevolent neutrality&quot;; this meant allowing French privateers access to US ports, and the right to sell captured British ships in American prize courts, but not vice versa.

It was soon apparent the U.S. interpreted &quot;neutrality&quot; differently, while the 1794 Jay Treaty with Britain directly contradicted the 1778 Treaty of Amity and Commerce. When France retaliated by seizing American ships trading with the British, an effective response was hampered by Jeffersonian resistance to a permanent military force. Instead, the U.S. suspended repayment of loans made by France during the Revolutionary War; efforts to resolve this through diplomacy ended in the 1797 dispute known as the XYZ Affair, which worsened the situation.
The U.S. was also concerned by French ambitions in North America, especially in its former territory of Louisiana, acquired by Spain in 1762. For decades, American settlers had been moving into this area, despite diplomatic efforts to manage it, including the 1795 Pinckney&#x27;s Treaty. By 1800, nearly 400,000 or 7.3% of Americans lived in trans-Appalachian territories, including the new states of Kentucky and Tennessee.

Western economic development required access to the Mississippi River, particularly the vital port of New Orleans, and the U.S. much preferred a weak Spain to an aggressive and powerful France on their western and southern borders. The discovery that French agents were conducting military surveys to determine how best to defend Louisiana led to the 1798 Alien and Sedition Acts.

With most of their fleet confined to port by the Royal Navy, the French relied on privateers operating off the U.S. coastline, and in the Caribbean. On July 7, 1798, Congress cancelled the 1778 Treaties and authorised attacks on French warships in American waters, resulting in the Quasi-War of 1798–1800. By arming 200 merchant ships, expanding the Navy, and informal co-operation with the British, the U.S. re-established control over its home waters.

However, President John Adams remained keen to reach a diplomatic solution, and in early 1799, a diplomatic commission was approved, consisting of William Vans Murray, Oliver Ellsworth, and William Richardson Davie. Their objectives were to formally terminate the 1778 treaties, confirm American neutrality, agree compensation for shipping losses and end the Quasi-War, although they did not arrive in Paris until early 1800.

During this delay, the French Directory was overthrown in November 1799, and replaced by the Consulate, headed by Napoleon. He was also keen on ending hostilities, since an important part of his support came from wealthy merchants, who wanted to re-establish their control over sugar-producing islands in the Caribbean. These were extremely profitable; prior to the abolition of slavery in 1793, the colony of Saint-Domingue produced more sugar and coffee than all the British West Indies combined.

==Negotiations==

Formal discussions with the recently re-appointed Foreign Minister Talleyrand did not begin until April and proceeded slowly. The main problem was the U.S. demand for $20 million compensation for shipping losses, which the Commissioners had been instructed to resolve before discussing revised treaties. As the French pointed out, measures taken by the Directory against American commerce had been annulled by the new government, while those imposed by the U.S. had just been renewed. They argued compensation only applied only if the 1778 treaties remained in force; either the U.S. confirmed the existing treaties and received compensation, or insisted on new ones and received none.

However, Talleyrand accepted the treaties could not be enforced, and preferred to reach an amicable agreement with the U.S., rather than drive it into a relationship with Britain, which was one impact of the Quasi-War. American neutrality was essential for French plans for North America; under the secret Third Treaty of San Ildefonso of October 1800, Spain agreed to transfer Louisiana to France in return for territories in Italy.

In July 1800, Russia, with informal French support, established the Second League of Armed Neutrality, whose signatories agreed to resist the British policy of searching neutral ships for contraband. This allowed Talleyrand to concede the principle of &quot;free trade, free goods, freedom of convoy&quot; demanded by the Americans, while victories at Marengo in June, and Hohenlinden in December forced Emperor Francis II to make peace. In the February 1801 Treaty of Lunéville, he ceded Austrian territories in Italy demanded by Spain in the Treaty of San Ildefonso. 

==Terms==
Talleyrand now had all the pieces in place to re-establish a French presence in North America; although the American commissioners did not have details of the Louisiana agreement, they were aware of the strength of his position and anxious to make a deal. The Convention signed on 30 September contained 27 clauses, the majority of which related to commercial affairs; these protected each other&#x27;s merchants from having their goods confiscated, and guaranteed both sides most favoured nation trading status.

The most important and controversial was Clause II, which agreed to &#x27;postpone&#x27; discussions on compensation, and suspended the 1778 treaties until this was resolved. Although the convention was dated September 30, 1800, arguments over the inclusion of Clause II meant Congress did not ratify the agreement until December 21, 1801. In the end, the U.S. government agreed to compensate its citizens for the claimed damages of $20 million, although it was only in 1915 the heirs finally received $3.9 million in settlement.

==Aftermath==

At the time, the convention was generally viewed unfavorably in the U.S., as it failed to agree compensation, or address concerns over French objectives in North America. Modern historians argue by ending the dispute with France, it ultimately facilitated the Louisiana Purchase, while reaching agreement on commercial terms was essential, since the U.S. was not strong enough to enforce them on its own.

Negotiations between France and Britain to end the War of the Second Coalition resulted in the March 1802 Treaty of Amiens; although widely viewed as a short-lived truce, it gave Napoleon an opportunity to activate his plans for North America. In December 1801, 30,000 veteran French troops landed on Saint-Domingue, and soon after, Spain confirmed the transfer of Louisiana to France.

This caused great concern in Congress, but by October 1802, it was clear the expedition was a catastrophic failure; its leader, General Charles Leclerc died of yellow fever, along with an estimated 22,000 of his men. Without Saint-Domingue, Napoleon concluded Louisiana was irrelevant, and with France and Britain once again on the verge of hostilities, he decided to sell the territory to prevent it from being annexed by British forces garrisoned in nearby Canada. In April 1803, the U.S. purchased the territory for $15 million, or 80 million francs.

<text>Qandala (also known as Candala, Andala, Bender Chor, Bandar Kor, Bender Kor or Taba Tege) is an ancient port town in the northeastern Bari province of Somalia.

==Overview==

Qandala sits on a wadi estuary, which forms a natural protective harbor for vessels on the Gulf of Aden. It lies 75 kilometres (47 mi) east of Bosaso, 549 kilometres (341 mi) south of Aden, and 475 kilometres (295 mi) west of Socotra.

The city is located in the autonomous Puntland region of Somalia. It is the capital of the Qandala District.

In antiquity, Qandala was an active trading center for merchants from the interior of the Horn of Africa, who transported goods such as incense, gum and aromatic woods to and from the port. Its nickname Gacanka Hodonka (&quot;Gulf of Prosperity&quot;) is a relic from this era.

Additionally, Qandala is coextensive with the ancient town of Botiala. The latter settlement features an old fortress complex, which overlooks and controls the mouth of the wadi leading inland.

===2016 ISIL capture===

On 26 October 2016, a militant group linked to ISIL captured Qandala with 50 armed fighters after a brief firefight with local security forces, thus becoming the first town to be seized by Islamic State affiliated militants in Somalia. BBC News reported that ISIL militants had withdrawn from the town for unclear reasons. However, the report was denied by other media outlets claimed that it was false. On 7 December 2016, a Somali official said Puntland security forces had recaptured the port from ISIL-linked fighters, killing 30 militants. Another four soldiers were also killed during the operation.

==Demographics==
Qandala has a population of around 19,300 inhabitants.

==Education==
Qandala has a number of academic institutions. According to the Puntland Ministry of Education, there are 15 primary schools in the Qandala District. Among these are Xamure, Dhadar, Turmasale and Gurur.

==Transportation==
Qandala has a small seaport.
Air transportation in the city is served by the Candala Airport.

<doc id="1041693" wikidata="Q1930986" url="?curid=1041693" title="Bec de corbin">
<text>A bec de corbin (, ) is a type of polearm and war hammer that was popular in late medieval Europe. The name is Old French for &quot;raven&#x27;s beak&quot;. Similar to the Lucerne hammer, it consists of a modified hammer&#x27;s head and spike mounted atop a long pole. Unlike the Lucerne hammer, the &quot;bec de corbin&quot; was used primarily with the &quot;beak&quot; or fluke to attack instead of the hammer head. The hammer face balancing the beak was often blunt instead of the multi-pronged Lucerne, and the beak tended to be stouter; better designed for tearing into plate armor, mail, or gambeson. Nonetheless, some becs-de-corbin also had a multi-pronged hammer. The spike mounted on the top of the head was also not nearly as long and thin as on the Lucerne. &quot;Bec de corbin&quot; is sometimes used as a general term to describe several types of war hammer, such as mauls and horseman&#x27;s picks. A similar name, bec de faucon (meaning &quot;falcon&#x27;s beak&quot;), refers to a related weapon called a poleaxe or, more specifically, to the hook on its reverse side.

Between 1964 and 1980, she participated in five Olympic Games, winning seven medals, three of them gold. She also broke six world records and is the only athlete (male or female) to have held a world record in the 100 m, 200 m and the 400 m events. She also won 10 medals in European Championships. Between 1965 and 1979, she gathered 26 national titles and set 38 records in the 100–400 m sprint and long jump.

At her first Olympics in Tokyo in 1964, she took a silver medal in the long jump and 200 metres, and ran the second leg of the gold medal-winning 4 × 100 metres relay team.

She was a double sprint winner at the World Student Games in Budapest in 1965. In the same year she set her first world record, breaking Wyomia Tyus&#x27; 11.2 s from the previous year with an 11.1 s clocking in Prague, Czechoslovakia, July 9, 1965. She won the British WAAA Championships title at the 1965 WAAA Championships.

In 1966, at the European Athletics Championships she won Gold in the long jump, 200 metres and 4 × 100 metres relay; and took a silver in the 100 metre sprint.

At her second Olympics in Mexico, She won a bronze in the 100 metres, but failed to qualify for the Long Jump final. She recovered from that disappointment, to win the gold medal in the 200 metres in a new world-record time. In the sprint relay the Polish team dropped the baton on the final exchange in the semi-final and finished last.

After giving birth to her son, in 1971, she managed a bronze medal in the long jump at the European Championships in Helsinki. She would compete in the three events at the Munich Olympics in 1972, the two sprints and the long jump. She would come away with a bronze medal in the 200 metres.

In the 1974 season, she became the first woman to break the 50-second barrier for 400 metres, and she set a new world record of 22.21 s for 200 metres. At the European Championships in the Rome she won the sprint double of 100 metres and 200 metres, beating the favoured GDR sprinter Renate Stecher; and ran the anchor leg on the 4 × 100 metres relay team which took the bronze. She was ranked number 1 in the world in the 100, 200 and 400 m events in 1974.

She would win her final Olympic medal in Montreal in 1976, by winning the gold in the 400 metres in a world record time of 49.28. At the inaugural World Cup of Track and Field in 1977, she would win both 200 metres and 400 metres; beating both favoured East German runners Bärbel Wöckel and Marita Koch respectively. She would be ranked number 1 in the world for 200 m and 400 m in 1976 and 1977.

In her final appearance at the European Championships at 32 year of age, she managed to win a bronze in the 400 metres and the 4 × 400 metres relay.

She was ranked number 1 in the world 7 times in the 200 metres; 4 times in the 400 metres, and 2 times in the 100 metres; as well as 3 times in the long jump. Over-all, she was ranked 15 years in the top ten at 200 metres, also 4 times number 2, twice at number 3, which just leaves 2 years outside the top 3; (from 1964 to 1977 she was ranked in the top 3 – 200 metre runners in the world) a remarkable achievement. She was ranked 12 times in the 100 metres, 8 times in the long jump and 6 times in the 400 metres (which she took up in 1974).

She obtained United Press International Athlete of the Year Award, Female 1974. She won the European Sportsperson of the Year presented by the Polish Press Agency twice in 1966 and 1974.

In 1998, Szewińska became a member of the International Olympic Committee. She was the president of the Polish Athletic Association 1997–2009.

On 3 August 2005, she was elected as the third woman to the IAAF (International Association of Athletics Federations) Council during the first session of the 45th IAAF Congress in Helsinki.

<doc id="1041696" wikidata="Q2880168" url="?curid=1041696" title="The Last Don">
<text>The Last Don is a 1996 novel by American author Mario Puzo, best known as the author of the 1969 novel &quot;The Godfather&quot;. The story follows an aging Mafia Don and his family as they try to retain power.

The story alternates between the film industry and the Las Vegas Strip casinos, and how the American Mafia is linked to both.

&quot;The Last Don&quot; was adapted into a television miniseries of the same name, which aired in 1997. A sequel to the miniseries, &quot;The Last Don II&quot;, aired in 1998. This novel also effectively became the last release during Puzo&#x27;s lifetime, before his death in 1999, although he still released two more novels, both of which were released after his death.

==Plot==
The last plan of Don Domenico Clericuzio, an aging Mafia boss, is to eventually have his family enter the legitimate world and assimilate into American society. Twenty-five years later, his grandson Dante and grandnephew Crocifisso &quot;Cross&quot; De Lena make their way through life, and the eighty-year-old Don is semi-retired. Cross, who holds a majority share in a Las Vegas casino, is supposed to become the strong arm of the family. However, when he refuses to take part in the murder of an old friend, Dante is left to be the sole tough guy. Dante&#x27;s greed for power and blood lead him to plan the elimination of his relatives, who are an obstacle to the desire to become as powerful as the old Don himself. When Dante arranges a hit on Cross&#x27;s father, strongman Pippi De Lena—who, in a subplot, once commanded the elimination of the rival Santadio Family whose scion, Jimmy, married Don Clericuzio&#x27;s daughter Rose Marie and fathered Dante before his family&#x27;s assassination, driving Dante&#x27;s mother to insanity—Cross, who is aware of being on the blacklist, catches Dante in a trap. Having acted against the family, he waits for the Don&#x27;s vendetta, but, to his own surprise, his life is spared and he is only condemned to exile. Cross then resumes his romance with actress Athena Aquitane. The story ends with the revelation that Don Clericuzio planned this outcome, even anticipating his grandson&#x27;s death, all along, for the long-term survival of his family.

==Miniseries==

&quot;The Last Don&quot; was the basis for the 1997 CBS television miniseries of the same name written by Joyce Eliason and starring Joe Mantegna, Danny Aiello, and Daryl Hannah. In 1998, this was followed by &quot;The Last Don II&quot;, in which Cross is restored from exile to take reluctant command of the Clericuzio Family upon the Don&#x27;s death.

<text>Sergey Alekseyevich Lebedev (; 2 November, 1902 – 3 July, 1974) was a Soviet scientist in the fields of electrical engineering and computer science, and designer of the first Soviet computers.

==Biography==

Lebedev was born in Nizhny Novgorod, Russian Empire. He graduated from Moscow Highest Technical School in 1928. From then until 1946 he worked at All-Union Electrotechnical Institute (formerly a division of MSTU) in Moscow and Kyiv. In 1939 he was awarded the degree of Doctor of Sciences for the development of the theory of &quot;artificial stability&quot; of electrical systems.

During World War II, Lebedev worked in the field of control automation of complex systems. His group designed a weapon-aiming stabilization system for tanks and an automatic guidance system for airborne missiles. To perform these tasks Lebedev developed an analog computer system to solve ordinary differential equations.

From 1946 to 1951 he headed the Kiev Electrotechnical Institute of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, working on improving the stability of electrical systems. For this work he received the Stalin (State) prize in 1950.

In 1948 Lebedev learned from foreign magazines that scientists in western countries were working on the design of electronic computers, although the details were secret. In the autumn of the same year he decided to focus the work of his laboratory on computer design. Lebedev&#x27;s first computer, MESM, was fully completed by the end of 1951. In April 1953 the State commission accepted the BESM-1 as operational, but it did not go into series production because of opposition from the Ministry of Machine and Instrument Building, which had developed its own weaker and less reliable machine.

Lebedev then began development of a new, more powerful computer, the M-20, the number denoting its expected processing speed of twenty thousand operations per second. In 1958 the machine was accepted as operational and put into series production. Simultaneously the BESM-2, a development of the BESM-1, went into series production. Though the BESM-2 was slower than the M-20, it was more reliable. It was used to calculate satellite orbits and the trajectory of the first rocket to reach the surface of the Moon. Lebedev and his team developed several more computers, notably the BESM-6, which was in production for 17 years.

In 1952, Lebedev became a professor at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. From 1953 until his death he was the director of what is now called the Institute of Precision Mechanics and Computer Engineering.

Lebedev died in Moscow and is interred at Novodevichy Cemetery.

In 1996 the IEEE Computer Society recognized Sergey Lebedev with a Computer Pioneer Award for his work in the field of computer design and his founding of the Soviet computer industry.

<doc id="1041701" wikidata="Q5110386" url="?curid=1041701" title="Tampines">
<text>Tampines ( ) is the regional centre of the East Region of Singapore. With a population of 284,560 living across its five subzones as of 2024, it is the most populous planning area in Singapore. It is home to approximately 5% of Singapore&#x27;s population. Tampines is bordered to the west by Bedok and Paya Lebar, to the north by Pasir Ris, to the east by Changi, and to the south by the Straits of Singapore. Situated in the historical region of Tanah Merah, its present-day terrain is particularly flat due to the large-scale sand quarrying in the 1960s.

Tampines is composed of five subzones — Tampines North, Tampines East, Tampines West, Simei and Xilin. These subzones were created in the early 1990s predominantly for urban planning purposes and have no relation to the three political constituencies in Tampines. Four of its subzones are largely residential with the exception of Xilin, which has a fair mix of commercial, industrial and recreational facilities. Xilin is home to Singapore Expo, the largest convention center in Singapore, and features the largest agglomeration of golf courses in Singapore.

As the first regional centre in Singapore, Tampines has progressed from a remote neighbourhood in the 1980s to a vibrant commercial hub. It is one of three regional centres in the city-state, serving to decentralise economic activity from the Central Business District to other parts of the island, an idea first proposed in the 1991 Concept Plan. Several large insurance companies, real estate corporations and financial institutions, such as OCBC and UOB, have shifted their back-end operations to the regional centre. According to the Urban Redevelopment Authority, it now has 200,000 m2 of office space and 112,000 m2 of retail space. Tampines is also home to Changi Business Park, Singapore’s largest integrated business park. It is a 71,000 m2 project that houses many multinational corporations, including J.P. Morgan, Credit Suisse, IBM and Standard Chartered. As of 2016, it has 152,400 resident working persons, the second-highest in Singapore, according to the Department of Statistics.

Tampines New Town in the north is a densely-populated residential town, and regarded as the core of the planning area. Its boundaries, as delineated by the Housing Development Board, exclude Xilin and the private housing estates of Simei. It spans 1200 hectares, of which 549 hectares is residential area, the largest of any town in Singapore. It is currently the third-most populous town in Singapore, with 232,700 residents (as of 2018). Amidst rapid ongoing development in Tampines North and with a projected ultimate of 110,000 dwelling units, Tampines is expected to become the most populous town in Singapore in the near future. Regarded as a mature estate by the Government, it is the first estate in Singapore to employ its own municipal services office, given the variety of municipal issues it has to handle. Enforcement of certain minor infractions has also been delegated to Tampines Municipal Services through its enforcement officers.

== Etymology ==
The name Tampines goes back to the Franklin and Jackson map of 1828. It is named after Sungei Tampines, which in turn got its name from the &quot;tempinis&quot; trees (Malay for &quot;Streblus elongatus&quot;) which were said to be growing by it.

==History==
In the past, Tampines was covered by forests, swamps, and sand quarries. Ironwood trees, or &quot;tempinis&quot; in Malay, grew abundantly. The area was part of a military training area until about 1987.

The oldest street in the area, Tampines Road, dates to 1864 when it was a cart track. At the turn of the 20th century, Tampines was a rubber plantation. Tampines was also home to the sand quarry for a long time. Among the plantations were Teo Tek Ho and Hun Yeang estates.

===Development boom in the 1980s===
The new town started in 1978. Construction began for Neighbourhoods 1 and 2 and was completed between 1983 and 1987, although they were given priority. Neighbourhoods 8 and 9 began in 1985–1989, followed by Neighbourhood 5, which was completed in 1989 with the Tampines Town Centre. Neighbourhood 4 was completed with the new Tampines North Division between 1986 and 1988. Tampines Town was at the fast-paced expansion that breaks it into Tampines East, Tampines West, Tampines North, and Tampines Changkat divisions.

For the Singapore MRT plans, they showed &quot;Tampines North&quot; and &quot;Tampines South&quot; since the planning stages, which is due to the similar townships from 1979 to 1982, before they were renamed respectively in 1985 to Tampines and Simei.

New construction methods expedited the development of the town&#x27;s infrastructure. More attractive designs, colours, and finishings were incorporated into Tampines than earlier public housing, which consisted of uniform slabs of concrete laid out row after row with more thought given to function than form. The Town Centre was planned as an hourglass shape to create a unique urban design form. The Housing and Development Board (HDB) managed the construction of the town until 1991, when it handed the reins over to the Tampines Town Council. The Town Council is run by grassroot leaders and the residents themselves.

The Building and Social Housing Foundation (BSHF) of the United Nations awarded the World Habitat Award to Tampines, which was selected as a representative of Singapore&#x27;s new towns, on 5 October 1992. The award was given to recognise an outstanding contribution towards human settlement and development.

Neighbourhoods 3 and 7 were only fully completed in 1997, and the constituencies had been reformed to include the new Tampines Central division. 

===Residential expansion in the 2010s===
Construction was paused until the developments of Tampines Central were started in 2010, which consists of The Premiere @ Tampines, Tampines GreenLeaf, Centrale 8, Tampines Trilliant, and Citylife @ Tampines, including some of the other leftover pockets of residential developments such as Tampines GreenTerrace, Arc @ Tampines, Q Bay Residences and The Santorini.

Neighbourhood 6, which is also known as Tampines North New Town, has started construction with the first Build-To-Order (BTO) flats Tampines GreenRidges being announced at the end of November 2014. Tampines GreenRidges is also part of the first phase of the Tampines North New Town&#x27;s Park West District, which is the first district to be constructed in the Tampines North New Town development.

Tampines Court, had been en-bloc since July 2017 and all residents vacated their premises by 12 December 2018. It is a former HUDC flat that was privatised in 2002. The upcoming condominium is Treasure at Tampines.

===Crime===
In 2016, Tampines had the second highest number of snatch thefts (6), the third highest number of robberies (7), and the third highest number of unlicensed moneylending harassment cases (186) in Singapore. Additionally, Tampines averaged the third highest number of car thefts, with an annual increase of 17.8 cases from 2012 to 2016. However, these figures are largely attributed to the large population in Tampines. The crime rate in Tampines is not noticeably higher than the overall rate in Singapore, which remains among the lowest in the world.

In 2023, Tampines ranks 7th (tied with five others) among neighbourhoods in Singapore by number of housebreaking crimes, with five cases. This was down from 27 in 2011.

Similarly, the number of motor vehicle thefts dropped from 31 in 2011 to five in 2023. This is reflective of the overall trend in Singapore.

Changi NPC, which has the southern subzones of Tampines under its jurisdiction, saw one housebreaking, one motor vehicle theft and one snatch theft case in 2023. There were no robbery cases in its records for 2023.

==Economy==
===Cost of living===
====Housing====
In the first quarter of 2024, Tampines had the highest median rent for executive apartments in Singapore, at S$4,000. It had the seventh highest rent for 5-room HDB flats, at S$3,600.

====Food====
Tampines is the 12th most expensive planning area for food, according to the 2016 Makan Index by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (LKYSPP). Over the years, the cost of living in Tampines has risen significantly.

In 2023, the Makan Index revealed that Tampines had the highest price among 26 residential neighbourhoods for a lunch or dinner at a kopitiam, food court or hawker centre. It cost S$14.90 for a plate of chicken briyani with iced Milo. It also had the highest average price for a breakfast set in the East Region at S$3.39. As for beverages, Tampines had the highest average price for kopi at S$1.24 and for lime juice at S$1.81. Its kopitiams also sold iced Milo at an average price of S$1.92, the highest in the country.

These high food prices can be attributed to the high rents in Tampines. In 2024, a kopitiam in Tampines broke the record for the highest tendered rent, since the HDB&#x27;s Price-Quality Method (PQM) for tenders began in 2016. There were 20 participating tenders in that particular exercise, with the successful tenderer setting the rent at $88,889.00. Four of the six most expensive coffeeshops under this tender method are in Tampines. In 2022, Tampines also set the record for the most expensive coffee shop by resale price in Singapore, at $41.68 million.

===Industries===

Together with the adjacent planning areas, Tampines contributes to the economy of the East Region of Singapore, which had a nominal GDP of US$50.246 million in 2023.

The 71-hectare Changi Business Park is home to logistics enterprises and leading technology corporations, like AMD. It is also home to numerous finance institutions, like DBS, Citibank, and JP Morgan. 

The manufacturing industries are located in Tampines South and Changi South. Tampines Central is a hub for various financial institutions, ranging from banks to insurance companies, like OCBC, UOB, Income and AIA.

==Politics==
===Electoral boundaries===
Originally, Tampines was under the Tampines Single Member Constituency, when it was still under development. Its population grew quickly and, in 1988, its electoral boundaries were redrawn to form the Tampines Group Representation Constituency (GRC) and Eunos GRC.

Eunos GRC was eventually dissolved in 1997. The ward of Tampines North was split and absorbed into Pasir Ris GRC and Tampines GRC. The rest of the former was absorbed back into Tampines GRC. Pasir Ris GRC then dissolved in 2001, after just one election.

Since 2001, Tampines has been divided into three GRCs, namely the namesake Tampines (for Tampines North, Tampines East and Tampines West), Aljunied (for the area around Temasek Polytechnic) and East Coast (for Xilin and Simei). Minor changes have been made to its electoral boundaries in some elections.

In 2025, Tampines will be divided into one GRC - Tampines GRC (Tampines East, Tampines Changkat, Tampines Central, Tampines West, Tampines Green) and one SMC (Tampines North), as the remaining areas of Aljunied and East Coast GRCs will then be transferred to Tampines GRC (with the exception of Changi-Simei). Tampines GRC will also include Paya Lebar Airbase as well.

===Contesting parties===
The Workers&#x27; Party (WP) had contested parts of the town in Tampines North, under the now-defunct Eunos GRC, in 1988 and 1991. In both general elections, WP lost with 49.11% and 47.62% of the votes respectively.

The National Solidarity Party had contested in the town in all the general elections, except in 1997, when the party was disqualified. It contested under the Singapore Democratic Alliance in the 2001 and 2006 elections.

Most of Tampines has been led by the People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP) since the independence of Singapore. The only exception (as of 2020) is the southwestern parts of Tampines West, which is under the Aljunied GRC and has been led by WP since 2010.

===Members of Parliament===
MPs in Tampines also serve as the grassroots leaders in their respective GRCs, as is the case in the rest of Singapore.

Former minister Mah Bow Tan had contested in and led the constituency from 1988 until his retirement from politics in 2015. Between 2011 and 2020, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Heng Swee Keat headed the PAP team, before he was transferred to East Coast GRC. As of 2020, Tampines GRC has been led by Minister of the Environment and Water Resources and Muslim Affairs Masagos Zulkifli, who has been contesting since the 2006 general election.

== Sports ==

=== BG Tampines Rovers F.C. ===
The town has a professional football club, BG Tampines Rovers Football Club. It competes in the Singapore Premier League, the top tier of the Singapore football league system. It is sometimes referred to by its official nickname, The Stags.

ITE College East now comprises four schools, of which the School of Health Sciences is exclusive to the East campus. Its student population has grown steadily to 9,000 in 2023.

The Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), established in 2012, moved to its permanent campus in Xilin in 2015. As the fourth public university in Singapore, SUTD specialises in design and technology education, and offers full-time undergraduate courses in five majors.

===Tampines Regional Centre===
The urban planning policy of Singapore is to create partially self-sufficient towns, in terms of commercial needs, to relieve strain on traffic drawn to the city centre. Thus, an array of facilities are provided primarily for residents in the new towns. Tampines is one of Singapore&#x27;s four regional centres (along with Woodlands, Jurong East and future Seletar), under the plan of the Urban Redevelopment Authority. As a result, the Tampines Regional Centre serves the Tampines residents and the entire East Region.

===Commercial services===

There are three hotels in Tampines — Dusit Thani Laguna Singapore, Park Avenue Changi and capri by Fraser. Catered to business travellers, they are all located in and around Changi Business Park.

Retail shopping in the Tampines Regional Centre is done at four main shopping malls — Tampines Mall, Century Square, Tampines 1 and Our Tampines Hub. Commercial tenants of the shopping centres include restaurants, supermarkets, department stores, cinemas, bookstores, international money remittance and gift shops.

There are other malls outside the New Town as well, namely Eastpoint Mall, Singapore Expo, and Changi City Point.

On 30 November 2006, IKEA opened its second outlet and first megastore in Singapore at Tampines Retail Park, adjacent to Courts and Giant, together, these three are the first to have retail warehouse stores in Singapore. On 9 April 2009, UNIQLO opened its first outlet in Southeast Asia at Tampines 1.

===Community services===

Tampines Regional Library, the first regional public library in Singapore, was initially located along Tampines Avenue 7 and officially opened on 3 December 1994. It served as a &quot;prototype library&quot; to test new services and features before their implementation at other branch libraries. It was converted into a cybersecurity facility called &quot;Tachyon @ 31&quot; in September 2023.

The library was relocated to Our Tampines Hub in 2017, an integrated community and lifestyle hub. This new location continues to serve the eastern part of Singapore, offering expanded facilities and services. The library&#x27;s initial concept was to be a &quot;library of the future,&quot; aligning with the Library 2000 Review Committee&#x27;s vision.

Tampines has six community clubs, which are managed by the People&#x27;s Association and provide a wide range of services. Among them, Tampines Central Community Club is housed within Our Tampines Hub. These community clubs are common spaces for residents to come together, and they occasionally provide information from the government on national policies through events and booths.

===Healthcare===
Changi General Hospital (CGH) is a major restructured hospital operated by SingHealth in Simei, one of the subzones in the Tampines. It is the fourth largest healthcare facility in Singapore, with a capacity of 1,000 beds. As Singapore&#x27;s first purpose-built general hospital, it caters to communities in the East Region of Singapore. The hospital houses six specialist centres and encompass a wide range of disciplines, such as cardiology, orthopaedic surgery, and sports medicine. In Newsweek&#x27;s World&#x27;s Best Specialized Hospitals 2024 ranking, CGH ranks 48th in pulmonology, 69th in neurosurgery, 113rd in orthopedics, and 164th in oncology.

Other healthcare facilities include two polyclinics, with one in Tampines East and the other in Tampines North. These polyclinics offer a wide array of health services for residents, from management of chronic diseases to treatment of acute medical conditions. Besides the polyclinics, Tampines has several nursing homes and elderly day care centres to support its ageing population.

===Neighbourhood centres===


As of 2024, there are six neighbourhood centres in Tampines, as gazetted in the URA Master Plan. They are located in neighbourhoods 1 to 5 and 8.

Tampines Street 11 Neighbourhood Centre is the first in the planning area. Developments in the neighbourhood centre include the Tampines Town Council and Tampines Round Market &amp; Food Centre, which opened in 1983 as the first hawker centre in Tampines.

Tampines N2 Shopping Street has Singapore&#x27;s most expensive coffee shop, which was sold for a record $41.68 million. The 604-square-metre establishment, known as 21 Street Eating House, features 18 stalls. This purchase price translates to approximately $6,411 per square foot, nearly matching the average rate for ground-level retail units in Far East Plaza and Lucky Plaza along Orchard Road.

Tampines Central Shopping Street and ShopTWest see a comparatively high footfall, due to their proximity to Tampines MRT Station and Temasek Polytechnic respectively.

Two additional neighbourhood centres are planned. One of them will be located on a mixed-use site in Tampines North, sharing the land plot with the Tampines North Integrated Transport Hub. In 2022, a consortium comprising UOL Group, Singapore Land, and CapitaLand Development submitted the highest bid of S$1.206 billion to develop the site. The other future neighbourhood centre will be constructed in the Tampines South estate, as part of a proposed mixed-use development. On 27 June 2024, the HDB launched the sale of the site via public tender. This site has the potential to accommodate 585 residential units and will feature a gross floor area of 61,837 square metres. The development will include an early childhood development centre (ECDC), a supermarket, a food court, and a community plaza, with an underpass connection to Tampines West MRT station.

===Our Tampines Hub===


Our Tampines Hub is a new development in Tampines. Construction began in June 2013 and it opened on 9 November 2016. It is located at the site of the former Tampines Stadium along Avenue 4 and 5, together with the swimming pool.

It is built for the residents of Tampines and provides a community space where residents can gather, interact, and bond with others from the community. Facilities available include a community centre, sports and recreation centres, swimming pools, bowling alleys, karaoke facilities, information centres, and several offices. The Tampines Regional Library was also relocated here.

==Parks and recreation==

===Large parks===

There are three main parks in Tampines New Town. Sun Plaza Park, located at Tampines Avenue 7 and 9, is one of the first parks in Tampines and previously featured a crocodile-shaped playground in the 1990s. Tampines Eco Green, one of NPark&#x27;s few nature parks, is 36.5 hectares and located northeast of Sun Plaza Park. Home to over 75 species of birds, Tampines Eco Green remains largely preserved in its existing ecological state, with marshlands, secondary forests and freshwater ponds. Tampines Boulevard Park stretches from Tampines Avenue 9 to the future Tampines North MRT station, and forms the spine of Tampines North. These three parks are adjacent to each other and interconnected by footpaths and cycling paths.

The former Tampines Bike Park, was located west of Tampines Avenue 12, at the current site of Tampines Boulevard Park. Managed by Sport Singapore, it had the only BMX track in Singapore and a 13km-long mountain bike trail. An estimated 2,600 riders visited the park each month. In 2010, Tampines Bike Park hosted BMW events during the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics. It officially closed on 17 September 2014, to make way for housing and future developments in Tampines North.

There are other parks in Tampines outside the New Town. Changi Business Park Garden is one of them, serving employees in the area. It runs through the centre of the business park, with The Signature building to its south. There are two large ponds and an amphitheatre in the garden. 

Zone H of East Coast Park features the only beach in Tampines. Located just south of the National Service Resort &amp; Country Club (NSRCC), the beach in this zone can extend up to 100 metres out to sea during extreme low tides. East Coast Park offers residents an uninterrupted cycling path to the Central Business District (CBD). It also connects to Changi Airport to its northeast.

===Community parks and nature ways===
The other parks in Tampines New Town are mainly community parks — Tampines North Park, Tampines Leisure Park, Tampines Central Park, Tampines Park, Festival Park, Tampines Green, Tampines Tree Garden, and some neighbourhood parks. These small parks serve as outdoor spaces for residents to engage in exercise activities near their homes. Occasionally, community-related events are held at Festival Park. They also serve as nodes of the Tampines Nature Way.

Tampines Nature Way, characterised by its lush vegetation of trees and shrubs, is designed to mimic natural forest ecosystems. One of many nature ways in Singapore, it serves as a vital corridor for wildlife, like including birds and butterflies, to move between green spaces. Tampines Nature Way connects Tampines Eco Green, Bedok Reservoir and Pasir Ris Park, which have rich biodiversity, to the urban areas in Tampines. This also fosters a deeper appreciation of Singapore&#x27;s City in Nature initiative.&lt;ref name=&quot;about-parks-nature-reserves-pcns/nature-corridors-ways&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Simei Nature Way serves a similar purpose, connecting green spaces in adjacent neighbourhoods. It also connects the extensive Tampines Nature Way to the Upper Changi Nature Way.

In the future, more green spaces will be added in Tampines. According to the URA Masterplan 2019, a plot of land beside the future Tampines GreenQuartz neighbourhood in Tampines West has been earmarked for a future community park.

===Park connector===

Tampines Park Connector is one of many under the Park Connector Network (PCN) in Singapore that aims to promote cycling and connect parks together with shared-use paths. With a combined length of 7 kilometres, the Tampines Park Connector provides residents with an alternative means of traversing the town and visiting other parks in Singapore.

The northeastern section of Tampines Park Connector runs along Sungei Tampines. Between 2018 and 2022, the concrete canal was rebuilt into a naturalised waterway under a contract by PUB, marking the third project of its kind in Singapore. The project, which cost S$48.827 million, features lookout decks on both sides, allowing visitors to experience the waterway up close.

===Undesignated park===
On the outskirts of Tampines lies an undesignated park, Tampines Quarry Park. It used to be a sand quarry in the early to mid-1900s, to support the development boom in the 20th century. Rainwater has since filled the quarry. It is not equipped with any facilities, but this park still remains popular among nearby residents and off-road cycling enthusiasts. As it is hidden behind lush greenery, there are no signs or entrances to the park, though there are hidden pathways to enter.

==Transport==

===Road network===
A network of expressways, namely the Pan-Island Expressway, East Coast Parkway and Tampines Expressway, and arterial roads allow easy movement within the town and link it to other parts of the island. Tampines Avenue 10, an arterial street, forms the start/end of the Outer Ring Road System, a semi-expressway.

===Mass rapid transit===
There are currently 6 MRT stations that serve the planning area across 2 lines, the East West line and Downtown line. Both lines have two interchange stations at Tampines MRT station and Expo MRT station on the Changi Airport Branch line. The stations of the Downtown line were opened on 21 October 2017 as part of DTL3. The 6 stations are:

* Tampines
* Simei
* Tampines West
* Tampines East
* Upper Changi
* Expo
* Xilin (future)
* Tampines North (future)

Xilin MRT station is a future underground station as part of the DTL3 extension, which will be completed in 2026, in tandem with Stage 5 of the Thomson–East Coast line.

Tampines North MRT station is another station under construction in Tampines, and will be located in the Tampines North Integrated Transport Hub. It is part of the 29-kilometre Phase 1 of the Cross Island line, which will be operational from 2030.

===Bus===
There are three bus interchanges — Tampines Bus Interchange, Tampines North Bus Interchange and Tampines Concourse Bus Interchange. All of them are located in Tampines New Town.

Tampines Bus Interchange is the primary bus interchange serving Tampines New Town in Singapore, operated by SBS Transit Ltd and owned by the Land Transport Authority. It complements the high-capacity rail network and supports the hub-and-spoke transport model. Tampines Bus Interchange hosts 23 bus services that cater to approximately 325,000 passengers daily, making it the fourth busiest bus interchange in Singapore. The interchange has evolved from the original Tampines Bus Terminal established in 1983, which was later replaced by a larger temporary terminal to accommodate the increasing population and transport demand. 

The current Tampines Bus Interchange, located in Tampines Central, began operations in phases starting in November 1987. Built at a cost of S$5 million, it features 85 bus bays and a comprehensive set of trunk and feeder services linking Tampines to the rest of Singapore. The interchange underwent refurbishments in 2008 to become barrier-free, and again in 2017 to add new alighting berths to prevent bus bunching.

Tampines Concourse Bus Interchange opened on 18 December 2016, to manage peak-hour demand and passenger load at the adjacent Tampines Bus Interchange. It was designated for new services with lower demand.

Tampines North Bus Interchange opened on 27 November 2022 to serve new residents in Tampines North. It will be redeveloped to be part of the Tampines North Integrated Transport Hub (ITH).

Changi Business Park Bus Terminal is a bus terminal in the northern part of Changi Business Park. The terminal, which opened on December 20, 2015, introduced two new Bus Services Enhancement Programme (BSEP) bus services to enhance transportation options around the Changi Business Park.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation depot===

The East Coast Integrated Depot (ECID) in Xilin, currently under construction and expected to be completed in 2026, will serve three MRT lines: the East–West Line, the Downtown Line, and the Thomson–East Coast Line. Located beside the soon-to-be-demolished Changi Depot, it will be Singapore&#x27;s first MRT depot to support three MRT lines and the third to integrate a bus depot. This integrated model is expected to save 44 hectares of land. It will accommodate over 200 trains of various sizes and lengths, along with more than 550 buses.

===District cooling system===
Tampines is set to become the first town centre in Singapore to implement a district cooling system, a significant milestone announced on April 18. This innovative Distributed District Cooling (DDC) network will connect seven commercial buildings in Tampines Central. Scheduled to be operational by the first half of 2025, the DDC will utilise the existing cooling systems of these buildings to produce and distribute chilled water through interconnected pipes, thereby providing efficient cooling across the network.

The implementation of the DDC network in Tampines is expected to significantly reduce carbon emissions and achieve substantial energy savings. SP Group and Temasek project that the network will lower carbon emissions by 1,359 tonnes annually, equivalent to removing 1,236 cars from Singapore&#x27;s roads, and save over 2.8 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of energy each year, enough to power more than 905 three-room HDB households. By optimising the existing chiller plants and using injection nodes at Century Square, Our Tampines Hub, and Tampines One, the system will enhance cooling efficiency and reduce equipment costs for building owners. This project not only demonstrates the potential for integrating sustainable solutions into existing urban infrastructures but also aligns with Singapore’s broader climate ambitions, contributing to a low-carbon future.

===Emergency services===

The 2nd SCDF Division Headquarters, located on the western border of Tampines, has been operational since January 26, 2006. It features an underground command post, which enhances its command and control capabilities during emergencies. A public education centre was also set up to promoting community preparedness. The Tampines Fire Station, co-located with the Division Headquarters, occupies the first two levels of the seven-story building. Staffed by 140 personnel, the fire station&#x27;s location along the Tampines Avenue 10 thoroughfare allows for rapid response to emergencies in the residential areas of Tampines and Pasir Ris, as well as high-risk premises in the nearby industrial parks.

Tampines Neighbourhood Police Centre (NPC) is a mid-sized police station in Tampines West. It is under the regional command of the Bedok Police Division. Tampines NPC was one of the first NPCs to adopt the new Community Policing System (COPS), which aims to improve the way NPCs work with the community. Tampines East Neighbourhood Police Post (NPP) and Tampines North NPP were also established for residents to access police services with ease, such as submitting police reports and applying for various permits.

===Cycling town===
Tampines is Singapore&#x27;s pioneering cycling town. It established its first dedicated cycling paths as early as 2010. These paths link residential areas in Tampines, with key amenities such as MRT stations and community centres. In 2017, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) recently announced plans to triple the existing 6.9km cycling path network to about 21km, exceeding the cycling infrastructure in other new towns. Enhancements include widening existing paths, improving bicycle crossings with additional signage, and establishing trunk routes connecting Tampines to neighbouring towns and key employment hubs such as Changi Business Park.

This cycling town project aims to promote cycling as a sustainable mode of transport, and enhance the overall liveability and accessibility of Tampines.

In Tampines, there is a wide availability of shared bicycles provided by two operators, HelloRide and Anywheel. These services offer convenient access to bicycles for both residents and visitors, facilitating short trips around the town at low cost.

<text>The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man is a 1962 book by Marshall McLuhan, in which he analyzes the effects of mass media, especially the printing press, on European culture and human consciousness. It popularized the term &quot;global village&quot;, which refers to the idea that mass communication allows a village-like mindset to apply to the entire world; and &quot;Gutenberg Galaxy&quot;, which we may regard today to refer to the accumulated body of recorded works of human art and knowledge, especially books.

McLuhan studies the emergence of what he calls the Gutenberg Man, the subject produced by the change of consciousness wrought by the advent of the printed book. Apropos of his axiom, &quot;The medium is the message,&quot; McLuhan argues that technologies are not simply inventions which people employ but are the means by which people are re-invented. The invention of movable type was the decisive moment in the change from a culture in which all the senses partook of a common interplay to a tyranny of the visual. He also argued that the development of the printing press led to the creation of nationalism, dualism, domination of rationalism, automatisation of scientific research, uniformation and standardisation of culture and alienation of individuals.

Movable type, with its ability to reproduce texts accurately and swiftly, extended the drive toward homogeneity and repeatability already in evidence in the emergence of perspectival art and the exigencies of the single &quot;point of view&quot;. He writes:

==The format of the book—a &quot;mosaic&quot;==
The book is unusual in its design. McLuhan described it as one which &quot;develops a mosaic or field approach to its problems&quot;. The mosaic image to be constructed from data and quotations would then reveal &quot;causal operations in history&quot;.

The book consists of five parts:

* Prologue
* The Gutenberg Galaxy
* The Galaxy Reconfigured
* Bibliographic Index
* Index of Chapter Glosses

The main body of the book, &quot;The Gutenberg Galaxy&quot;, consists of 107 short &quot;chapters&quot;.

Apparently, McLuhan also had some ideas about how to browse a book. &quot;Marshall McLuhan, the guru of The Gutenberg Galaxy&quot; (1962), recommends that the browser turn to page 69 of any book and read it. If you like that page, buy the book.&quot; Such apparent arbitrariness fits with picking a particular piece (or part) of a mosaic and deciding if you like it. Certainly the McLuhan test can be applied to the Gutenberg Galaxy itself. Doing so will reveal a further insight into the purpose of his own book.

===Prologue===
McLuhan declares his book to be &quot;complementary to &quot;The Singer of Tales&quot; by Albert B. Lord.&quot; The latter work follows on from the Homeric studies of Milman Parry who turned to &quot;the study of the Yugoslav epics&quot; to prove that the poems of Homer were oral compositions.

==Four epochs of history==
The book may also be regarded as a way of describing four epochs of history:

For the break between the time periods in each case the occurrence of a new medium is responsible, the &quot;hand-writing&quot; terminates the oral phase, the printing and the electricity revolutionizes afterwards culture and society.

Given the clue of &quot;hand-writing&quot; that terminates the &quot;oral phase&quot; one expects &quot;printing&quot; to terminate the manuscript phase and the &quot;electrifying&quot; to bring an end to the Gutenberg era. The strangeness of the use of &quot;electrifying&quot; is entirely appropriate in the McLuhan context of 1962. The Internet did not exist then.

McLuhan himself suggests that the last section of his book might play the major role of being the first section:

The last section of the book, &quot;The Galaxy Reconfigured,&quot; deals with the clash of electric and mechanical, or print, technologies, and the reader may find it the best prologue.
===Oral tribe culture===
The oral tradition is not dead. In schools or at home or in the street, where children are taught to learn by heart, to memorize, nursery rhymes or poems or songs, then they can be said to participate in the oral tradition. The same is often true of the children belonging to religious groups who are taught to learn to say their prayers. In other words, childhood is one of the ages of man (in Shakespeare&#x27;s sense) and is essentially an oral tribal culture. The transition from this oral culture takes place when the child is taught to read and write. Then the child enters the world of the manuscript culture.

McLuhan identifies James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; as a key that unlocks something of the nature of the oral culture.&quot;

Of particular importance to the Oral Culture is the Art of memory.

====The village====
In commenting on the then Soviet Union, McLuhan puts &quot;the advertising and PR community&quot; on a par with them in so far that both &quot;are concerned about access to the media and about results.&quot; More remarkably he asserts that &quot;Soviet concern with media &quot;results&quot; is natural to any oral society where interdependence is the result of instant interplay of cause and effect in the total structure. Such is the character of a village, or since electric media, such is also the character of global village.&quot;

===Manuscript culture===
The culture of the manuscript (literally hand-writing) is often referred to by McLuhan as scribal culture.

Medieval illumination, gloss, and sculpture alike were aspects of the art of memory, central to scribal culture.
Associated with this epoch is the Art of memory (in Latin Ars Memoriae).

===Gutenberg galaxy===
Finnegans Wake:
Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; (like Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot;) is one of the texts which McLuhan frequently uses throughout the book to weave together the various strands of his argument.

Throughout &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; Joyce specifies the Tower of Babel as the tower of Sleep,
that is, the tower of the witless assumption, or what Bacon calls the reign of the Idols.
====Movable type====
His episodic history takes the reader from pre-alphabetic tribal humankind to the electronic age. According to McLuhan, the invention of movable type greatly accelerated, intensified, and ultimately enabled cultural and cognitive changes that had already been taking place since the invention and implementation of the alphabet, by which McLuhan means phonemic orthography. (McLuhan is careful to distinguish the phonetic alphabet from logographic/logogramic writing systems, like hieroglyphics or ideograms.)

Print culture, ushered in by the Gutenberg press in the middle of the fifteenth century, brought about the cultural predominance of the visual over the aural/oral. Quoting with approval an observation on the nature of the printed word from &quot;Prints and Visual Communication&quot; by William Ivins, McLuhan remarks:
In this passage [Ivins] not only notes the ingraining of lineal, sequential habits, but, even more important, points out the visual homogenizing of experience of print culture, and the relegation of auditory and other sensuous complexity to the background. [...] The technology and social effects of typography incline us to abstain from noting interplay and, as it were, &quot;formal&quot; causality, both in our inner and external lives. Print exists by virtue of the static separation of functions and fosters a mentality that gradually resists any but a separative and compartmentalizing or specialist outlook.

The main concept of McLuhan&#x27;s argument (later elaborated upon in &quot;The Medium is the Massage&quot;) is that new technologies (like alphabets, printing presses, and even speech itself) exert a gravitational effect on cognition, which in turn affects social organization: print technology changes our perceptual habits (&quot;visual homogenizing of experience&quot;), which in turn affects social interactions (&quot;fosters a mentality that gradually resists all but a... specialist outlook&quot;). According to McLuhan, the advent of print technology contributed to and made possible most of the salient trends in the Modern period in the Western world: individualism, democracy, Protestantism, capitalism and nationalism. For McLuhan, these trends all reverberate with print technology&#x27;s principle of &quot;segmentation of actions and functions and principle of visual quantification.&quot;

===Electronic age===
====The global village====
In the early 1960s, McLuhan wrote that the visual, individualistic print culture would soon be brought to an end by what he called &quot;electronic interdependence&quot;: when electronic media would replace visual culture with aural/oral culture. In this new age, humankind will move from individualism and fragmentation to a collective identity, with a &quot;tribal base.&quot; McLuhan&#x27;s coinage for this new social organization is the &quot;global village&quot;.

The term is sometimes described as having negative connotations in &quot;The Gutenberg Galaxy&quot;, but McLuhan himself was interested in exploring effects, not making value judgments:
Instead of tending towards a vast Alexandrian library the world has become a computer, an electronic brain, exactly as an infantile piece of science fiction. And as our senses have gone outside us, Big Brother goes inside. So, unless aware of this dynamic, we shall at once move into a phase of panic terrors, exactly befitting a small world of tribal drums, total interdependence, and superimposed co-existence. [...] Terror is the normal state of any oral society, for in it everything affects everything all the time. [...] In our long striving to recover for the Western world a unity of sensibility and of thought and feeling we have no more been prepared to accept the tribal consequences of such unity than we were ready for the fragmentation of the human psyche by print culture.

Key to McLuhan&#x27;s argument is the idea that technology has no &quot;per se&quot; moral bent—it is a tool that profoundly shapes an individual&#x27;s and, by extension, a society&#x27;s self-conception and realization:
Is it not obvious that there are always enough moral problems without also taking a moral stand on technological grounds? [...] Print is the extreme phase of alphabet culture that detribalizes or decollectivizes man in the first instance. Print raises the visual features of alphabet to highest intensity of definition. Thus print carries the individuating power of the phonetic alphabet much further than manuscript culture could ever do. Print is the technology of individualism. If men decided to modify this visual technology by an electric technology, individualism would also be modified. To raise a moral complaint about this is like cussing a buzz-saw for lopping off fingers. &quot;But&quot;, someone says, &quot;we didn&#x27;t know it would happen.&quot; Yet even witlessness is not a moral issue. It is a problem, but not a moral problem; and it would be nice to clear away some of the moral fogs that surround our technologies. It would be good for morality.

The moral valence of technology&#x27;s effects on cognition is, for McLuhan, a matter of perspective. For instance, McLuhan contrasts the considerable alarm and revulsion that the growing quantity of books aroused in the latter seventeenth century with the modern concern for the &quot;end of the book.&quot; If there can be no universal moral sentence passed on technology, McLuhan believes that &quot;there can only be disaster arising from unawareness of the causalities and effects inherent in our technologies.&quot;

Though the World Wide Web was invented thirty years after &quot;The Gutenberg Galaxy&quot; was published, McLuhan may have coined and certainly popularized the usage of the term &quot;surfing&quot; to refer to rapid, irregular and multidirectional movement through a heterogeneous body of documents or knowledge, e.g., statements like &quot;Heidegger surf-boards along on the electronic wave as triumphantly as Descartes rode the mechanical wave.&quot; Paul Levinson&#x27;s 1999 book &quot;Digital McLuhan&quot; explores the ways that McLuhan&#x27;s work can be better understood through the lens of the digital revolution. Later, Bill Stewart&#x27;s 2007 &quot;Living Internet&quot; website describes how McLuhan&#x27;s &quot;insights made the concept of a global village, interconnected by an electronic nervous system, part of our popular culture well before it actually happened.&quot;

McLuhan frequently quoted Walter Ong&#x27;s &quot;Ramus, Method, and the Decay of Dialogue&quot; (1958), which evidently had prompted McLuhan to write &quot;The Gutenberg Galaxy&quot;. Ong wrote a highly favorable review of this new book in &quot;America&quot;. However, Ong later tempered his praise, by describing McLuhan&#x27;s &quot;The Gutenberg Galaxy&quot; as &quot;a racy survey, indifferent to some scholarly detail, but uniquely valuable in suggesting the sweep and depth of the cultural and psychological changes entailed in the passage from illiteracy to print and beyond.&quot;

McLuhan&#x27;s &quot;The Gutenberg Galaxy&quot; won Canada&#x27;s highest literary award, the Governor-General&#x27;s Award for Non-Fiction, in 1962. The chairman of the selection committee was McLuhan&#x27;s colleague at the University of Toronto and oftentime intellectual sparring partner, Northrop Frye.

<text>The Kruševo Republic (Bulgarian and Macedonian: Крушевска Република, &quot;Kruševska Republika&quot;; ) was a short-lived political entity proclaimed in 1903 by rebels from the Secret Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) in Kruševo during the anti-Ottoman Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising.

== History ==
In the early 20th century, Kruševo was populated by a Slavic population, Aromanians and Orthodox Albanians with town inhabitants being ethnoreligiously split among various Ottoman millets, with Greek Patriarchists being the largest community, followed by Bulgarian Exarchists and the Ullah millet for the Aromanians. According to the ethnographer Vasil Kanchov&#x27;s statistics based on linguistic affinity, at that time the town&#x27;s inhabitants counted: 4,950 Bulgarians, 4,000 Vlachs (Aromanians) and 400 Orthodox Albanians.

On 3 August 1903, rebels captured the town of Kruševo in the Manastir Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire (present-day North Macedonia) and established a revolutionary government. The entity existed only for 10 days: from 3 to 13 August, and was headed by Nikola Karev. He was a strong leftist, rejecting the nationalism of the ethnic minorities and favouring alliances with ordinary Muslims against the Sultanate, as well as supporting the idea of a Balkan Federation.

Amongst the various ethnoreligious groups (millets) in Kruševo, a Republican Council was elected with 60 members – 20 representatives from three groups: Aromanians, Bulgarian Exarchists and Greek Patriarchists. The Council also elected an executive bodythe Provisional Governmentwith six members (2 from each mentioned group), whose duty was to promote law and order and manage supplies, finances, and medical care. The presumable &quot;Kruševo Manifesto&quot; was published in the first days after the proclamation. Written by Nikola Kirov, it outlined the goals of the uprising, calling upon the Muslim population to join forces with the provisional government in the struggle against Ottoman tyranny, to attain freedom and independence. Both Nikola Kirov and Nikola Karev were members of the Bulgarian Workers&#x27; Social Democratic Party, from where they derived these leftist ideas.

However, an ethnic identification problem arose. Karev called all the members of the local Council &quot;brother Bulgarians&quot;, while the IMRO insurgents flew Bulgarian flags, killed five Greek Patriarchists, accused of being Ottoman spies, and subsequently assaulted the local Turk and Albanian Muslims. As long as the town was controlled by the Bulgarian komitadjis, the Patriarchist majority was suspected and terrorized. Except for Exarchist Aromanians, who were Bulgarophiles, (as Pitu Guli and his family), most members of the other ethnoreligious communities dismissed the IMRO as pro-Bulgarian.

Initially surprised by the uprising, the Ottoman government took extraordinary military measures to suppress it. Pitu Guli&#x27;s band (cheta) tried to defend the town from Ottoman troops coming from Bitola. The whole band and their leader (voivode) perished. After fierce battles near Mečkin Kamen, the Ottomans managed to destroy the Kruševo Republic, committing atrocities against the rebel forces and the local population. As a result of the gunnery, the town was set partially ablaze. After the plundering of the town by the Turkish troops and the Albanian bashi-bazouks, the Ottoman authorities circulated a declaration for the inhabitants of Kruševo to sign, stating that the Bulgarian komitadjis had committed the atrocities and looted the town. A few citizens did sign it under administrative pressure.

== Legacy ==

The celebration of the events in Kruševo began during the First World War, when the area, then called Southern Serbia, was occupied by Bulgaria. Naum Tomalevski, who was appointed a mayor of Kruševo, organized the nationwide celebration of the 15th anniversary of the Ilinden uprising. On the place of the Battle of Mečkin Kamen, a monument and a memorial-fountain were built. After the war, they were destroyed by the Serbian authorities, which continued implementing a policy of forcible Serbianization. The tradition of celebrating these events was restored during World War II in the region when it was called Vardar Banovina and was officially annexed by Bulgaria.

During World War II, the newly organized pro-Yugoslav Macedonian communist partisans developed the idea of some kind of socialist continuity between their struggle and the struggle of the insurgents in Kruševo. Moreover, they exhorted the population to struggle for &quot;&quot;free Macedonia&quot; and against the &quot;fascist Bulgarian occupiers&quot;&quot;. After the war, the story continued in the Socialist Republic of Macedonia, where the Kruševo Republic was included in its historical narrative. As part of the efforts to prove the continuity of the new Macedonian nation and the former insurgents, they claimed the IMRO activists had been consciously Macedonian in identity. The establishment of the short-lived entity is seen today in North Macedonia as a prelude to the independence of the modern Macedonian state.

Nikola Kirov&#x27;s writings, which are among the most known primary sources on the rebellion, mention Bulgarians, Vlachs (Aromanians), and Greeks (sic: Grecomans), who participated in the events in Kruševo. Although post-World War II Yugoslav Communist historians objected to Kirov&#x27;s classification of Kruševo&#x27;s Slavic population as Bulgarian, they quickly adopted everything else in his narrative of the events in 1903 as definitive. During the Informbiro period, the name of insurgents&#x27; leader Nikola Karev was scrapped from the Macedonian national anthem, as he and his brothers were suspected of being Bulgarophiles. 

The &quot;Ilinden Uprising Museum&quot; was founded in 1953 on the 50th anniversary of the Kruševo Republic. It was located in the empty house of the &quot;Tomalevski&quot; family, where the Republic was proclaimed, though the family had long since emigrated to Bulgaria. In 1974 an enormous monument was built on the hill above Kruševo, which marked the feat of the revolutionaries and the ASNOM. In the area, there is another monument called Mečkin Kamen.

Some modern Macedonian historians such as Blaže Ristovski have recognized, that the entity, nowadays a symbol of the Macedonian statehood, was composed of people who identified themselves as &quot;Greeks&quot;, &quot;Vlachs&quot; (Aromanians), and &quot;Bulgarians&quot;. When the anthropologist Keith Brown visited Kruševo on the eve of the 21st century, he discovered that the local Aromanian language still has no way to distinguish &quot;Macedonian&quot; and &quot;Bulgarian&quot;, and uses the designation &quot;Vrgari&quot;, i.e. &quot;Bulgarians&quot;, for both ethnic groups.

<text>Ferrol (, ) is a city in the province of A Coruña in Galicia, Spain, located in the Rías Altas, in the vicinity of Strabo&#x27;s Cape Nerium (modern-day Cape Prior). According to the 2021 census, the city had a population of 64,785, making it the seventh-largest settlement in Galicia. With Eume to the south and Ortegal to the north, Ferrol forms the &quot;comarca&quot; of Ferrolterra.

Around a hundred years ago, and earlier, the harbour, with its depth, capacity and overall safety, had few equals in Europe; its entrance was very narrow, commanded by forts, and could even be shut by a boom.

Ferrol has been a major naval shipbuilding centre for most of its history, being the capital of the Spanish Navy&#x27;s Maritime Department of the North since the time of the early Bourbons. In the 17th century, Ferrol held the largest arsenal in Europe. Today, the city contains several major shipbuilding yards belonging to the Navantia Group.

Ferrol was the birthplace of the dictator Francisco Franco in 1892. The municipality was officially named after him as &quot;El Ferrol del Caudillo&quot; from September 1938 to December 1982. It was also the birthplace of the founder of the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE), Pablo Iglesias, in 1850.

Ferrol is one of the starting points of the English Way of the Camino de Santiago. Due to the modern requirement that pilgrims must travel 100 km (approx. 62 mi) by foot in order to be officially recognised, the city is a preferential starting point for those traversing the English Way.

==Toponym and etymology==
The first historical mention of this settlement, then called &quot;Burum&quot; or &quot;Arotebrarum Portum&quot;, appears in the history of Pomponius Mela, a Roman historian who in the year AD 43 detailing a description of the &quot;Portus Magnus Artabrorum&quot;, the &quot;great port of the Artabri&quot;. The current toponym Ferrol, though, can only be traced back to the Middle Ages; a document from 1087&quot; &quot;mentions sancto Iuliano de Ferrol, near the monastery of San Martín de Jubia (12th century, in Romanesque style), where Ferrol is probably the local evolution of the genitive form of the Latin name Ferreolus; Ferrol was probably, in origin, the estate of one Ferreolus. In 1982 the government of Spain officially adopted the name Ferrol in accordance with its long history and tradition.

Another theory about the etymology of the name Ferrol posits some relation to the Latin word &quot;ferro&quot; (iron), as the area has long been rich in metals, especially iron and tin, but also gold and silver. It is possible, since the bay of Ferrol was such a well guarded port, that the old fishing village was named after the metal by traders reaching the enclave.

Alternatively, the name may derive from the legend of a Breton saint, Ferreol, who supposedly arrived there on a ship amid a chorus of seven sirens. Another tradition says that Ferrol comes from farol, alluding to the heraldic figure that appears on the coat of arms of the city. However, according to experts, the coat of arms of Ferrol dates back only to the eighteenth century.

==History==

The existence of prehistoric human settlements in the area that would later become Ferrol is suggested by the abundance of burial chambers and megalithic monuments, as well as petroglyphs and other archaeological findings. The Phoenicians established in this area several dried and salted cod stations and their presence, together with that of the Ancient Greeks, is well documented by such classical historians as Herodotus, Strabo, Pomponius Mela, and Ptolemy. In Roman times, in the 1st century BC, a fishing port existed which also traded in metals (like silver, gold, tin and iron), and wild horses. Near Ferrol there is a place called Naraío (famous for its medieval castle), whose name bears a phonetic resemblance Strabo&#x27;s Nerium,&quot; &quot;modern day Cape Prior. In ancient Hispania, these parts of the Iberia were dominated by the Artabri (or Arrotrebae), who gave their name to the Portus Magnus Artabrorum (&quot;Great Port of the Artabri&quot;), formed not only by the bay of Ferrol but the three rias of Ferrol, Betanzos and A Coruña. Ferrol was then, as it is today, a first class natural harbour in the treacherous waters of the Atlantic, and very well guarded. Historically, it has often been described as the best natural port in Europe.

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire the whole Iberian Peninsula, including Ferrol, was raided by the Vandals and incorporated in 411 to the Suebic Kingdom of Galicia; their kingdom was incorporated in 584 by Leovigild to the Visigothic Kingdom.

Following the collapse of the Suebic-Visigothic state, these Christian parts of Iberia saw very little change in comparison with other parts of the peninsula, becoming part of the Kingdom of Asturias as early as 750AD. Over time, the Kingdom of Asturias would split into further Christian kingdoms, causing the area to change hands several times between Galicia, Leon, and finally Castile.
Ferrol served as a strategic safe port during the Hundred Years&#x27; War and sided with the House of Trastamara during the Castilian Civil War. As a personal reward to Fernan Perez de Andrade, in 1371, Henry II gave the town to the powerful Andrade family.

In 1568 a fire reduced the old medieval town to rubble; in the same period some parts of the existing fortifications at the entrance of the estuary were built. The town was considered more important as a royal arsenal at this time than as a harbour.

With the arrival of the Bourbons in the 18th century, Ferrol became a leading naval centre. Ferrol was made capital of the Maritime Department of the North, formed under Ferdinand VI and Charles III for the defence of the Spanish Colonial Empire in America. Rapid improvements followed, notably under the leadership of the Marquis of Ensenada, and the position of Ferrol was made almost unassailable from the sea, the difficulties of disembarking troops on its precipitous coast being strengthened by a renewed line of fortresses and newly built castles, including that of San Carlos.

The Royal Dockyards of A Graña and Ferrol, built between 1726 and 1783, produced ships protected with copper sheets from the rolling mills of Xubia. In 1772, The Spanish Royal Academy of Naval Engineers of Ferrol, the first such academy in Spain, was created. For the most laborious work, six hundred galley slaves were employed in the harbour.

Ferrol is famous in the history of the struggle between the Spanish Empire and the British for being one of the only enclaves in the world, together with Cartagena de Indias, that always resisted occupation successfully; Ferrol was virtually impossible to blockade in the age of sail, as strong westerly winds would take any blockading force away along the treacherous north coast of Spain towards the Costa da Morte (Coast of Death), where they had no safe haven. The geography of Ferrol meant that an entire Spanish fleet could slip out on a single tide. By the time the British were able to resume the blockade, the Spanish would be safely away and out to sea. Despite these advantages, a decline set in during the reign of Charles IV, and in 1800, during the Ferrol Expedition, after the defences had been reduced, a British fleet of 109 vessels landed troops on the beach of Doniños to take the Castle of San Felipe. Although only equipped with meagre artillery, the castle&#x27;s small defence force under the command Count Donadio, together with a sizable number of volunteer citizens of Ferrol, successfully resisted the attack and the fleet withdrew. The alliance with the United Kingdom during the Peninsular War of 1808–1814 failed to prevent the deterioration in the town&#x27;s fortunes. The arsenals and fortresses were abandoned and they were easily occupied by the French in 1809.

When the war with Napoleonic France was over, many of the South American colonies chose to pursue independence from Spain and the shipyards of Ferrol went into a serious decline, losing most of their civilian, clergy and military population. By 1824, Ferrol had a population of just 10,000 civilians and about 6,000 military personnel (stationed locally, if not permanently, at least during most of the year). Its mathematical school for marine artillerists, the pilot school, and the Spanish Royal Academy of Naval Engineers were almost completely empty, in stark contrast to the glorious years of abundance before the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.
Ferrol built only two ships of the line between 1794 and 1845, although nine frigates and a considerable number of smaller warships were also constructed in this period. After half a century of decreased activity, it lost its title of capital under Ferdinand VII. However, there was a massive renovation during the leadership of Cardinal Alberoni and in just a few years fourteen great line-of-battle-ships were launched. New activities sprang up and Ferrol was employing 2,000 workmen in its foundries, now in full operation. A School of Naval Engineers was established where 40 students were taught the scientific principles of their profession by competent instructors educated in England and France. So successful in bringing the world&#x27;s most advanced technologies was the administration of the Marquis de Molina, the Spanish Minister for Naval affairs, that by 1858 the Royal Dockyards of Ferrol were launching Spain&#x27;s first steam propelled ship, which was also its first iron-hulled sailing ship.

The second half of the 19th century brought to the Royal Dockyards of Ferrol not only employment, but also concomitant social and political tensions, which culminated in the failed republican uprising of 1872. Steamers between Ferrol and the port of Havana in Spanish Cuba were in frequent operation at the time, such that shipyard workers who got into trouble with the local authorities in Ferrol often fled to the Spanish Main.
From the days of the Armada to the present, the Bay of Ferrol has attracted numerous ships seeking repairs or refuge after meeting with disaster or rough waters trying to cross the Bay of Biscay in bad weather. Such was the case of &quot;Cleopatra,&quot; carrying one of the two Cleopatra Needles, which stands today on the Thames Embankment in London, UK. It arrived in Ferrol on 19 October 1877 after almost sinking off the west coast of France five days earlier. A plaque commemorating the event and those who died can be seen at the base of the Needle in London.

Ten years after the Spanish–American War of 1898, in which Spain lost Cuba and the Philippines, the Antonio Maura government, in an attempt to restore the Spanish Navy and Spanish shipbuilding industry, hired the Spanish Society for Naval Construction, whose major investors were a British-Spanish conglomerate taking contracts In the following proportions: 40% Vickers Sons and Maxim, 30% Marquis of Comillas of the Spanish Transatlantic Company, and 30% Biscay Furnace Company. All the previously state-owned shipbuilding yards, workshops, foundries and dry docks at Ferrol were handed over to the technical expertise of some of the finest British shipbuilders; John Brown, Vickers and Armstrong were now in charge of building the new Spanish fleet.

For a period of sixteen years, the technicians were exclusively British, and the situation was not altered till 1925, when management was taken over by Spanish engineers. This was one of the new policies introduced by the newly installed government of the dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera (1923–1930). The arrival of the British coincided with the construction of a local tram system (1924–1961).

In view of the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, and due to the fear of social unrest in the naval station, the Foreign Office in London organized a ship to repatriate all the remaining British citizens. On 22 July 1936, HMS &quot;Witch&quot; left Ferrol bound for Britain.
At the beginning of the war, the shipbuilding yards, workshops, foundries and dry docks in Ferrol were taken over by the state. They were fully nationalized in 1945 under the name &quot;Bazán&quot;, later renamed &quot;IZAR&quot;, and, from January 2005, Navantia. The town was the birthplace of Francisco Franco, after whom the city was officially known as &quot;El Ferrol del Caudillo&quot; from 1938 to 1982. The end of the Spanish State and the arrival of democracy in 1978 did little to arrest Ferrol&#x27;s economic decline, and from 1982 to the early 1990s, the city faced numerous problems due to the waning of the naval sector. The beginning of the new millennium, however, has been a time of economic expansion and prosperity in general. A new motorway and an outer-port have been built, as have numerous arcades and shopping centres, mostly in the outskirts of the city between Ferrol and Naron. Young shoppers and their families frequent the stores and enjoy weekend days out with amenities like bowling, cafeterias, fast food outlets, cinemas and sports facilities.

The Spanish Navy Spanish Squadron still takes part in naval demonstrations and in June 2008 Ferrol hosted the large NATO Maritime Exercise Loyal Mariner (RN).

The Ferrol Terminus railway station, connecting Lugo to Ferrol, branching off from the line from Madrid to nearby A Coruña, was sanctioned by the Cortes in Madrid as early as 1865 but was not finally inaugurated until 1904. A century later, the High Speed AVE Railway suffered similar delays, eventually opening in 2013.

In September 2017, a new local railway branch serving the outer port of Ferrol (known as the Canelinas-Ferrol container port), the inside of the bay docks and the Ferrol Terminus railway station was given the green light to begin construction, and aims to move large numbers modern containers in and out of Ferrol, distributing goods throughout Galicia and the rest of Spain and Europe. A small railway local branch operated here in the early years of the 20th century. At that time, Ferrol itself and its ports were intended solely for the Royal Navy and its shipyards, and hence were not open to the general commerce per se. Historically, however, there have been many exceptions, with local businesses including PEMSA (timber), PYSBE (dried and salted cod) and HISPANIA (pencils), in addition to manufacturers of hats, paper and leather, plus naval and hardware stores. Items such as corn, wine, brandy, vinegar, pilchards and herrings (and other produce from Ferrol&#x27;s own fisheries) have also been exported.

==Climate==
Like much of Galicia, Ferrol has a humid oceanic climate, characterised by year-long mild temperatures, rainy winters, and relatively dry summers, although it is slightly wetter than the typical Spanish Mediterranean climate during the summer season.

The area is the site of many holiday cottages, a hotel, and a youth hostel for accommodation. Sjusjøen and neighboring village of Nordseter (to the west) were both originally mountain farm communities, which - with their easily accessible forest and mountain terrain - have developed into skiing destinations. 

The area offers a wide range of skiing alternatives, including on approximately of prepared cross-country trails. The tracks run all the way to Lillehammer and Øyer municipalities and they also connect with the Olympic tracks at the Birkebeineren Ski Stadium.

<text>...Best II is a compilation album by the Smiths. It was released on November 2, 1992, by the new owner of their back catalogue, WEA (Sire Records in the United States). Its highest British chart position was #29; it did not chart in the U.S.

==Background==
WEA (now the Warner Music Group) had acquired the entire Smiths back catalogue in early 1992 (sister label Sire Records already had the North American rights). Along with the re-release of the eight original albums (the four studio albums, the &quot;Rank&quot; live album and the three compilation albums issued while the band were still active), they immediately set to work compiling a &#x27;best of&#x27; collection in two volumes. It was the first time a regular best of compilation had ever been made of The Smiths&#x27; material and the first volume effortlessly reached the top of the British charts. This, the second volume, fared considerably worse. The British press continued to groan about sell-out and low track selection coherence.

The material is more or less picked and sequenced at random, and consists of both singles and album cuts. As with the first volume, in the UK a spin-off single was released: &quot;There Is a Light That Never Goes Out&quot; (which had originally been earmarked as a single back in 1986 but was ultimately passed over in favour of &quot;Bigmouth Strikes Again&quot;). The single was released ahead of the compilation album and reached No. 25.

=== Cover ===
The UK and European release of the record featured the right half of a 1960s biker couple photograph by Dennis Hopper on its sleeve, with &quot;Best...I&quot; completing the picture; the U.S. sleeve was designed by singer Morrissey and once again features Richard Davalos, co-star of &quot;East of Eden&quot; (other shots of Davalos grace the covers of &quot;Strangeways, Here We Come&quot; and the U.S. edition of &quot;Best...I&quot;).

<text>Shlomo Ganzfried (or &quot;Salomon ben Joseph Ganzfried&quot;, , , ; 1804, in Ungvár, Com.Ung, Royal Hungary – 30 July 1886, in Ungvár, Ung, Royal Hungary) was an Orthodox rabbi and posek best known as the author of the work of Halakha (Jewish law), the &quot;Kitzur Shulchan Aruch&quot; (Hebrew: קיצור שולחן ערוך, &quot;The Abbreviated Shulchan Aruch&quot;), by which title he is also known.

== Biography ==
Ganzfried was born in 1804 in Ungvár, in the Ung County of the Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Ukraine). His father Joseph died when he was eight. Ganzfried was considered to be a child prodigy and Ungvár&#x27;s chief rabbi and Rosh yeshiva, Rabbi Zvi Hirsh Heller assumed legal guardianship; Heller was known as &quot;&quot;Hershele&quot; the Sharp-witted&quot; for his piercing insights into the Talmud. Heller later moved to the city of Bonyhád, and Ganzfried, then fifteen, followed him. He remained in Heller&#x27;s yeshiva for almost a decade until his ordination and marriage. After his marriage he worked briefly as a wine merchant.

In 1830, he abandoned commerce and accepted the position of Rabbi of Brezovica (Brezevitz). In 1849, he returned to Ungvár as a dayan, a judge in the religious court. At that time Ungvár&#x27;s spiritual head, Rabbi Meir Ash, was active in the Orthodox camp, in opposition to the Neologs. Through serving with Ash, Ganzfried realised that in order to remain committed to Orthodoxy, &quot;the average Jew required an underpinning of a knowledge of practical halakha (Jewish law)&quot;. It was to this end that Ganzfried composed the &quot;Kitzur Shulchan Aruch.&quot; This work became very popular, and was frequently reprinted in Hebrew and in Yiddish. This work often records more stringent positions.

Rabbi Ganzfried remained in the office of Dayan until his death on July 30, 1886.

== Works ==
=== &quot;Kitzur Shulchan Aruch&quot; ===

The &quot;Kitzur Shulchan Aruch&quot;, first published in 1864, is a summary of the Shulchan Aruch of Joseph Karo with reference to later commentaries. This work was explicitly written as a popular text, in simple Hebrew, and does not have the same level of detail as the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; itself.

=== Other works ===
* &quot;Kesset HaSofer&quot; (קסת הסופר), a halachic primer for scribes published in 1835. Ganzfried composed this while he was still engaged in business.
* &quot;Pnei Shlomo&quot; (פני שלמה), an elucidation of portions of the Talmud.
* &quot;Torat Zevach&quot; (תורת זבח), a halakhic handbook for practitioners of shechita, ritual slaughter.
* &quot;Sefer Apiryon&quot; (ספר אפריון), a commentary on the Bible. It contains a piece on every weekly Torah portion except for Parshat Massei, which is also the week in which his yahrzeit falls.
* &quot;Lechem V&#x27;simlah&quot; (לחם ושמלה) on the laws of Niddah.
* &quot;Ohalei Sheim&quot; (אהלי שם) on the official spellings of Hebrew names, as pertaining to gittin.
* &quot;Sheim Shlomo&quot; (שם שלמה) on various &quot;sugyos&quot; in Shas.
* &quot;Sefer Galuy&quot; A letter written at the time of the Congress of 1869.

<doc id="1041734" wikidata="Q265660" url="?curid=1041734" title="John Fredriksen">
<text>John Fredriksen (born 10 May 1944) is a Norwegian-born Cypriot oil tanker and shipping billionaire businessman based in London. He owns the world&#x27;s largest oil tanker fleet and has major interests in the offshore driller Seadrill, the fish farming company Mowi, and the dry bulk company Golden Ocean Group. Through his investment companies Hemen Holdings and Meisha, Fredriksen controls the companies Frontline, Avance Gas Holding Ltd. and Flex LNG Ltd. In 2010–2011, Frontline owned 9.6 percent of another large tanker company, Overseas Shipholding Group. 

Born in Oslo, Norway, Fredriksen is now a naturalised Cypriot citizen. Before abandoning his Norwegian citizenship, he was Norway&#x27;s richest man. Norwegian magazine &quot;Kapital&quot; listed Fredriksen in 2013 with a net worth of NOK 69,75 billion (11.9 billion). In 2012, he was included in the 50 Most Influential list of Bloomberg Markets Magazine. He was named in the top 10 most influential people in the shipping industry according to Lloyds List 2014.

== Early and personal life==
Fredriksen was born on 10 May 1944 to a welder and his wife, and grew up in Etterstad, in the eastern half of Oslo.

Fredriksen is a widower and has two twin daughters (born 1983): Cecilie and Kathrine Astrup Fredriksen. Fredriksen&#x27;s late wife, dentist Inger Astrup Fredriksen (died 2006), originally belonged to one of the Astrup families in Norway. Her father was a professor of psychiatry, and her grand uncle was the painter Nikolai Astrup.

==Career==
=== Business ===
Frederiksen first got into oil trading in the 1960s in Beirut, Lebanon, before buying his first tankers in the 1970s. He made his fortune during the Iran–Iraq War in the 1980s, when his tankers picked up oil at great risk and huge profits. As described by his biographer, &quot;he was the lifeline to the Ayatollah.&quot; Fredriksen would later become the world&#x27;s largest tanker owner, with more than seventy oil tankers and major interests in oil rigs and fish farming. His fleet is dominated by costly double-hulled, environmentally safer tankers.

In 2006, Seadrill bought more than 50 percent of Smedvig, gaining control of the company (51.24 percent of the votes and 52.27 percent of the capital). Smedvig is Fredriksen&#x27;s biggest ever deal. Noble Corp sold its stake to Seadrill in 2009, leaving Seadrill with full control. Fredriksen has been the majority owner of Vålerenga I.F. for many years.

=== Fortune ===
The &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot; has ranked Fredriksen&#x27;s wealth as £475m (2003), £1.050b (2004), £1.887b (2005), £8.311b (2023). In 2012, Fredriksen and his family were listed as the 9th richest in Britain with a combined wealth of £6.6bn. Fredriksen owns houses in London, Oslo, Cyprus, and Marbella, Spain. His house The Old Rectory in London has been estimated to be worth around US$172 million. He is a collector of classic Norwegian art.

=== Philanthropy ===
Fredriksen claims to support research projects at The Radium Hospital and to have donated several hundreds of millions of Norwegian kroner to medical research at hospitals in Norway.

=== &quot;Gard&quot; case ===
In 1985, the Norwegian insurance company Gard became suspicious about losses of cargo from Fredriksen&#x27;s tankers. A private investigation was initiated, and a system for the use of heavy oil as bunker fuel was revealed. The case was turned over to the Norwegian police and in June 1986 Fredriksen&#x27;s offices in Oslo were searched and several of his nearest associates, and after a while also Fredriksen, were placed in detention while the case was investigated.

After several years of arguments between the various lawyers, the case was settled out of court. Fredriksen had to pay a fine of 2 million NOK for risking his crew&#x27;s lives, and in addition had to pay the insurance company Gard an amount of over 800,000.

<text>The nine mountain schools (九山; or &quot;gusan&quot;) were the initial monasteries of the Korean branch of Buddhism called Seon, founded in the Unified Silla period in the 8th or 9th century.

The initial transmission of Seon into Korea is usually attributed to Beomnang (法朗; fl. 632–646), said to be a student of the Chinese master Daoxin (道信; 580–651). Seon was later popularized especially by Sinhaeng (神行; 704–779) in the latter part of the eighth century and by (道義; d. 825) at the beginning of the ninth century. From then on, many Koreans studied Chan in China and, upon their return, established their own schools at various mountain monasteries with their leading disciples.

The number of these schools was initially fixed to nine, whence the name derives. Eight of these schools were of the lineage of Mazu Daoyi (馬祖道一; 709–788), as they were established through connection with either him or one of his eminent disciples:

# The Gaji san school (迦智山), established at Borimsa (寶林寺) under the influence of Doui and his grand-student Chejing (體澄; 804–890). Doui studied in China under Zhizang (735-814) and Baizhang (百丈; 749–814).
# The Seongju san school (聖住山), established by Muyeom (無染; 800–888) who received his inga from Magu Baozhe (麻谷寶徹; b. 720?).
# The Silsangsan school (實相山), founded by Hongcheok (洪陟; fl. 830), who also studied under Zhizang.
# The Huiyang san school (曦陽山), founded by Beomnang and Chiseon Doheon (智詵道憲; 824–882), who was taught by a Korean teacher of the Mazu transmission.
# The Bongnim san school (鳳林山), established by Weongam (圓鑑; 787-869) and his student Simhui (審希; fl. 9c). Weongam was a student of Zhangjing Huaihui (章敬懷暉; 748–835).
# The Dongni san school (桐裡山), established by Hyejeol (慧徹; 785–861) who was a student of Zhizang.
# The Sagul san school (闍崛山), established by Beom&#x27;il (梵日; 810–889), who studied in China with Yanguan Qian (鹽官齊安; 750?-842) and Yuesha Weiyan (樂山惟嚴).
# The Saja san school (獅子山), established by Doyun (道允; 797-868), who studied under Nanquan Puyan (南泉普願; 748–835).

The ninth of these initial schools was the Sumi san (須彌山) school founded by Ieom (利嚴; 869–936), which had developed from the Caodong (曹洞) lineage.

<text>Deva (Sanskrit: देव, ) means &#x27;shiny&#x27;, &#x27;exalted&#x27;, &#x27;heavenly being&#x27;, &#x27;divine being&#x27;, &#x27;anything of excellence&#x27;, and is also one of the Sanskrit terms used to indicate a deity in Hinduism. &quot;Deva&quot; is a masculine term; the feminine equivalent is &quot;Devi&quot;. The word is a cognate with Latin &quot;deus&quot; (&#x27;god&#x27;) and Greek Zeus.

In the earliest Vedic literature, all supernatural beings are called &quot;Devas&quot; and &quot;Asuras&quot;. The concepts and legends evolved in ancient Indian literature, and by the late Vedic period, benevolent supernatural beings are referred to as &quot;Deva-Asuras&quot;. In post-Vedic Hindu texts, such as the Puranas and the Itihasas of Hinduism, the &quot;Devas&quot; represent the good, and the &quot;Asuras&quot; the bad. In some medieval works of Indian literature, &quot;Devas&quot; are also referred to as Suras and contrasted with their equally powerful but malevolent half-brothers, referred to as the &quot;Asuras&quot;.

&quot;Devas&quot;, along with &quot;Asuras&quot;, &quot;Yakshas&quot; (nature spirits), and &quot;Rakshasas&quot; (ghoulish ogres/demons), are part of Indian mythology, and &quot;Devas&quot; feature in many cosmological theories in Hinduism.

==Etymology==
&quot;Deva&quot; is a Sanskrit word found in Vedic literature of 2nd millennium BCE. Sir Monier Monier-Williams translates it as &quot;heavenly, divine, terrestrial things of high excellence, exalted, shining ones&quot;. The concept also is used to refer to deity.

The Sanskrit &quot;deva-&quot; derives from Indo-Iranian &quot;*daiv-&quot; which in turn descends from the Proto-Indo-European word, &quot;*deiwo-&quot;, originally an adjective meaning &quot;celestial&quot; or &quot;shining&quot;, which is a (not synchronic Sanskrit) vrddhi derivative from &quot;*diw&quot;, zero-grade of the root &quot;*dyew-&quot; meaning &quot;to shine&quot;, especially as the day-lit sky. The feminine form of &quot;*deiwos&quot; is &quot;*deiwih2&quot;, which descends into Indic languages as &quot;devi&quot;, in that context meaning &quot;female deity&quot;. Also deriving from &quot;*deiwos&quot;, and thus cognates of &quot;deva&quot;, are &quot;Zeys/&quot;Ζεύς&quot;&quot; - &quot;Dias/&quot;Δίας&quot;, the Greek father of the gods, Lithuanian Dievas (Latvian Dievs, Prussian Deiwas), Germanic Tiwaz (seen in English &quot;Tue&quot;sday&quot;) and the related Old Norse Tivar (gods), and Latin Deus &quot;god&quot; and &quot;divus&quot; &quot;divine&quot;, from which the English words &quot;divine&quot; and &quot;deity&quot; are derived. It is related to &quot;*Dyeus&quot; which while from the same root, may originally have referred to the &quot;heavenly shining father&quot;, and hence to &quot;Father Sky&quot;, the chief God of the Indo-European pantheon, continued in Sanskrit Dyaus. The abode of the Devas is Dyuloka.

According to Douglas Harper, the etymological roots of &quot;Deva&quot; mean &quot;a shining one,&quot; from *div- &quot;to shine,&quot; and it is cognate with Greek dios &quot;divine&quot; and Zeus, and Latin deus &quot;god&quot; (Old Latin deivos). The word &quot;Deva&quot; shares similarities with Persian Daeva.

Deva is masculine; the related feminine equivalent is devi. Etymologically, &quot;Devi&quot; is cognate with Latin &quot;dea&quot;. When capitalized, &quot;Devi&quot; or &quot;Mata&quot; refers to a divine mother goddess in Hinduism. &quot;Deva&quot; is also referred to as &quot;Devatā&quot;, and &quot;Devi&quot; as &quot;Devika&quot;.

The word &quot;Deva&quot; is also a proper name or part of a name in Indian culture, where it refers to &quot;one who wishes to excel, overcome&quot; or the &quot;seeker of, master of or a best among&quot;.

Another interpretation of the word is derived from the word &quot;dibbati&quot;, which means to play or to sport. This denotes their playful nature and that they enjoy themselves with the five sensual pleasures.

==Vedic literature==

===Samhitas and Brahmanas===

The Samhitas, which are the oldest layer of text in Vedas enumerate 33 devas, either 11 each for the three worlds, or as 12 Adityas, 11 Rudras, 8 Vasus and 2 Asvins in the Brahmanas layer of Vedic texts. The Rigveda states in hymn 1.139.11,

Some devas represent the forces of nature and some represent moral values (such as the Adityas, Varuna, and Mitra), each symbolizing the epitome of a specialized knowledge, creative energy, exalted and magical powers (&quot;Siddhis&quot;). The most referred to Devas in the Rig Veda are Indra, Agni (fire) and Soma, with &quot;fire deity&quot; called the friend of all humanity, it and Soma being the two celebrated in a yajna fire ritual that marks major Hindu ceremonies. Savitr, Vishnu, Rudra, and Prajapati (later Brahma) are gods and hence Devas. Parvati (power and love) and Durga (victory) are some Devis or goddesses. Many of the deities taken together are worshiped as the Vishvedevas.

===Henotheism===
In Vedic literature, &quot;Deva&quot; is not a monotheistic God; rather a &quot;supernatural, divine&quot; concept manifesting in various ideas and knowledge, in a form that combines excellence in some aspects, wrestling with weakness and questions in other aspects, heroic in their outlook and actions, yet tied up with emotions and desires.

Max Muller states that the Vedic hymns are remarkable in calling every one of the different devas as &quot;the only one, the supreme, the greatest&quot;. Muller concluded that the Vedic ideas about &quot;devas&quot; are best understood neither as polytheism nor as monotheism, but as henotheism where gods are equivalent, different perspectives, different aspects of reverence and spirituality, unified by principles of Ṛta and Dharma.

===Characteristics of Devas in the Vedic literature===
Ananda Coomaraswamy states that Devas and Asuras in the Vedic lore are similar to the Olympian gods and Titans of Greek mythology. Both are powerful but have different orientations and inclinations, with the Devas representing the powers of Light and the Asuras representing the powers of Darkness in Hindu mythology. According to Coomaraswamy&#x27;s interpretation of Devas and Asuras, both these natures exist in each human being, both the tyrant and the angel. The best and the worst within each person struggles before choices and one&#x27;s own nature, and the Hindu formulation of Devas and Asuras is an eternal dance between these within each person.

All-powerful beings, good or evil, are called Devas and Asuras in the oldest layer of Vedic texts. A much-studied hymn of the Rigveda states &quot;Devav asura&quot; (Asuras who have become Devas), and contrasts it with &quot;Asura adevah&quot; (Asuras who are not Devas). They are born from the same father, Prajapati, the primordial progenitor; his sons are envisioned as the Asuras and Devas. They all share the same residence (&quot;Loka&quot;), eat together the same food and drinks (&quot;Soma&quot;), and have innate potential, knowledge and special powers in Hindu mythology; the only thing that distinguishes &quot;Asuras who become Devas&quot; from &quot;Asuras who remain Asuras&quot; is intent, action and choices they make in their mythic lives.

==Upanishads==

The oldest Upanishads mention &quot;Devas&quot;, and their struggle with the &quot;Asuras&quot;. The Kaushitaki Upanishad, for example, in Book 4 states that &quot;Indra was weaker than the Asuras when he did not know his own Atman (soul, self). Once Indra had self-knowledge, he became independent, sovereign and victorious over the Asuras&quot;; similarly, states Kaushitaki Upanishad, &quot;the man who knows his inner self gains independence, sovereignty and is unaffected by all evil&quot;.

Chandogya Upanishad, in chapter 1.2, describes the battle between Devas and Asuras on various sensory powers. This battle between good and evil fails to produce a victor and simply manifests itself in the perceived universe, as good or evil sights witnessed by beings, as good or evil words shared between people, as good or evil smells of nature, as good or evil feelings experienced, as good or evil thoughts within each person. Finally, the Deva-Asura battle targets the soul, where Asuras fail and Devas succeed, because soul-force is serene and inherently good, asserts Chandogya Upanishad.

Mantra 5.2.1 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad describes Devas, Men, and Asuras as sons of Prajapati, the primordial father. Each asks for a lesson on ethics. Prajapati tells the Devas to observe the virtue of temperance (self-restraint, &quot;Dama&quot;), the Men to observe the virtue of charity (&quot;Dana&quot;), and Asuras to observe the virtue of compassion (&quot;Daya&quot;). At the end of the Brāhmanam, the Upanishad declares that these are three cardinal virtues that should always be observed by all Devas, Men and Asuras.

Medieval era Indian scholars, in their &quot;Bhasya&quot; (review and commentaries) on the Upanishads, stated that the discussion of Devas and Asuras in the Upanishads is symbolic, and it represents the good and evil that resides and struggles within each human being. Adi Shankara, for example, in his commentary on Brihadaranyaka Upanishad asserted that Devas represent the human seeking for the sacred and spiritual, while the Asuras represent the human seeking for the worldly excesses. Edelmann and other modern era scholars also state that the Devas versus Asuras discussion in Upanishads is a form of symbolism.

In the later primary Upanishadic texts, Devas and Asuras discuss and act to seek knowledge, for different purposes. In one case, for example, they go to Prajāpati, their father, to understand what is Self (Atman, soul) and how to realize it. The first answer that Prajāpati gives is simplistic, which the Asuras accept and leave with, but the Devas led by Indra do not accept and question because Indra finds that he hasn&#x27;t grasped its full significance and the given answer has inconsistencies. Edelmann states that this symbolism embedded in the Upanishads is a reminder that one must struggle with presented ideas, learning is a process, and Deva nature emerges with effort.

==Puranas and Itihasas==
In the Puranas and the Itihasas with the embedded Bhagavad Gita, the Devas represent the good, and the Asuras the bad. According to the Bhagavad Gita (16.6-16.7), all beings in the universe have both the divine qualities (&quot;daivi sampad&quot;) and the demonic qualities (&quot;asuri sampad&quot;) within each. The sixteenth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita states that pure god-like saints are rare and pure demon-like evil are rare among human beings, and the bulk of humanity is multi-charactered with a few or many faults. According to Jeaneane Fowler, the Gita states that desires, aversions, greed, needs, emotions in various forms &quot;are facets of ordinary lives&quot;, and it is only when they turn to lust, hate, cravings, arrogance, conceit, anger, harshness, hypocrisy, violence, cruelty and such negativity- and destruction-inclined that natural human inclinations metamorphose into something demonic (Asura).

Everyone starts as an Asura in Hindu mythology, born of the same father. &quot;Asuras who remain Asura&quot; share the character of powerful beings obsessed with their craving for more power, more wealth, ego, anger, unprincipled nature, force and violence. The &quot;Asuras who become Devas&quot; in contrast are driven by an inner voice, seek understanding and meaning, prefer moderation, principled behavior, morals, knowledge, and harmony. The hostility between the two is the source of extensive legends and tales in the Puranic and the Epic literature of Hinduism; however, many texts discuss their hostility in neutral terms and without explicit condemnation. Some of these tales are the basis for myths behind major Hindu festivals, such as the story of Asura Ravana and Deva Rama in the Ramayana and the legend of Asura Hiranyakashipu and Deva Vishnu as Narasimha, the latter celebrated with the Hindu spring festival of Holika and Holi.

===Bhagavata Purana===
In Bhagavata Purana, Brahma had ten sons: Marichi, Atri, Angira, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Vasistha, Daksa, Narada. Marici had a son called Kasyapa. Kasyapa had thirteen wives: Aditi, Diti, Danu, Kadru etc. The sons of Aditi are called Adityas, the sons of Diti are called Daityas, and the sons of Danu are called Danavas. Bṛhaspati (Jupiter, son of Angiras) is a guru of devas (vedic gods). Shukracharya (Venus, son of Bhrigu) is a guru of asuras (vedic demons) or/and Danavas.

===Symbolism===
Edelmann states that the dichotomies present in the Puranas literature of Hinduism are symbolism for spiritual concepts. For example, god Indra (a Deva) and the antigod Virocana (an Asura) question a sage for insights into the knowledge of the self. Virocana leaves with the first given answer, believing now he can use the knowledge as a weapon. In contrast, Indra keeps pressing the sage, churning the ideas, and learning about means to inner happiness and power. Edelmann suggests that the Deva-Asura dichotomies in Hindu mythology may be seen as &quot;narrative depictions of tendencies within our selves&quot;.

The god (Deva) and antigod (Asura), states Edelmann, are also symbolically the contradictory forces that motivate each individual and people, and thus Deva-Asura dichotomy is a spiritual concept rather than mere genealogical category or species of being. In the Bhāgavata Purana, saints and gods are born in families of Asuras, such as Mahabali and Prahlada, conveying the symbolism that motivations, beliefs, and actions rather than one&#x27;s birth and family circumstances define whether one is Deva-like or Asura-like. l

==Classical Hinduism==

In Hinduism, Devas are celestial beings associated with various aspects of the cosmos. 
Devas such as Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, form the Hindu trinity known as the Trimurthi and preside over the functioning of the cosmos and the evolution of creation.

Lesser devas may control the forces of nature, such as Vayu, the Lord of the wind, Varuna the Lord of water, and Agni, the lord of fire.

Hinduism also has many other lesser celestial beings, such as the married Gandharvas (male celestial musicians) and Apsaras (female celestial dancers).

==Sangam literature==

Sangam literature of Tamil (300BC-300CE) describes the offerings for devas. In Silapathikaram one of the five epics of Tamil by Ilango Adigal saying the offering for Four kind of devas.

<text>For all practical purposes (sometimes abbreviated FAPP) is a slogan used in physics to express a attitude. A physical theory might be ambiguous in some ways — for example, being founded on untested assumptions or making unclear predictions about what might happen in certain situations — and yet still be successful in practice. Such a theory is said to be successful FAPP.

FAPP is also emerging as a valuable concept and approach in mathematics with a major title by the name &quot;For All Practical Purposes: Mathematical Literacy in Today&#x27;s World&quot;.

There is also a profound joke about FAPP:

:An elementary physics professor was teaching about how close you could get to the sun. He laid the foundation of heat and distance, and said that is as close as you can get FAPP. A boy asked, &quot;what does that mean?&quot; 

:The professor replied &quot;All the girls in the room line up on the right side, and all of the boys line up on the left side. Now halve the distance between each side. Now do it again. After about five times of doing this, as their noses were touching, He said: &quot;You are all close enough for all practical purposes&quot;.

<text>William Patrick Roberts (5 June 1895 – 20 January 1980) was a British artist.

In the years before the First World War Roberts was a pioneer, among English artists, in his use of abstract images. In later years he described his approach as that of an &quot;English Cubist&quot;. In the First World War he served as a gunner on the Western Front, and in 1918 became an official war artist. Roberts&#x27;s first one-man show was at the Chenil Gallery in London in 1923, and a number of his paintings from the twenties were purchased by the Contemporary Art Society for provincial galleries in the UK. In the 1930s it could be argued that Roberts was artistically at the top of his game; but, although his work was exhibited regularly in London and, increasingly, internationally, he always struggled financially. This situation became worse during the Second World War – although Roberts did carry out some commissions as a war artist.

Roberts is probably best remembered for the large, complex and colourful compositions that he exhibited annually at the Royal Academy summer exhibition from the 1950s until his death. He had a major retrospective at the Tate Gallery in 1965, and was elected a full member of the Royal Academy in 1966. There has recently been a revival of interest in the work of this artist who always worked outside the mainstream.

==Early years==
Roberts was born into a working-class family in London&#x27;s East End on 5 June 1895. The family were then living at 44 Blackstone Road in Hackney, and his father was a carpenter; they later moved to 4 Blanchard Road (by October 1898) and 20 London Fields West Side (by April 1911) nearby. From an early age Roberts showed an outstanding talent for drawing, and this was encouraged by his parents and by his school teachers. He left school at the age of 14 and took up an apprenticeship with the advertising firm of Sir Joseph Causton Ltd, intending to become a poster designer. He attended evening classes at Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art in London and won a London County Council scholarship to the Slade School of Art – freeing him from the obligations of his apprenticeship. He joined the Slade in 1911, studying under Henry Tonks and Wilson Steer. His contemporaries at the Slade included a number of brilliant young students, among them Dora Carrington, Mark Gertler, Paul Nash, Christopher Nevinson, Stanley Spencer, David Bomberg and Bernard Meninsky. The Slade&#x27;s emphasis on the importance of drawing and sound structuring of composition would inform Roberts&#x27;s later work. In 1912 he won the Slade&#x27;s Melville Nettleship prize for Figure Composition. He then spent the summer at Bourton, near Shrivenham, as a guest of Cyril Kendall Butler, a committee member of the Contemporary Art Society, who regularly accommodated and subsequently often purchased works by many of Roberts&#x27;s Slade teachers, such as Steer and Tonks.

== An English Cubist ==
Roberts was intrigued by Post-Impressionism and Cubism, an interest fuelled by his friendships at the Slade (in particular with Bomberg) as well as by his travels in France and Italy after leaving the Slade in 1913. Later in 1913 he joined Roger Fry&#x27;s Omega Workshops for three mornings a week. The ten shillings a time that Omega paid enabled him to create challenging Cubist-style paintings such as &quot;The Return of Ulysses&quot; (now owned by the Castle Museum and Art Gallery in Nottingham). After leaving Omega he was taken up by Wyndham Lewis, who was forming a British alternative to Futurism. Ezra Pound had suggested the name Vorticism, and Roberts&#x27;s work was featured in both editions of the Vorticist literary magazine &quot;BLAST&quot;. Roberts was a signatory to the Vorticist Manifesto that appeared in the first edition of the magazine. Roberts himself preferred the description &quot;Cubist&quot; for his work of this period. Two large-scale oil paintings exhibited in the 1917 Penguin Club Vorticist exhibition in New York, and purchased by John Quinn, were subsequently lost, but the radical nature of Roberts&#x27;s &quot;Cubist style&quot; is evidenced by &quot;The Toe Dancer&quot; (owned by the Victoria and Albert Museum) and the recently rediscovered &quot;Boxers&quot; – both exhibited with the London Group in 1915.

==First World War==

In 1916 Roberts enlisted in the Royal Regiment of Artillery as a gunner, serving on the Western Front in the Ypres sector, north of the Menin Road and at Arras. Having been on active service for the best part of two years, he successfully applied to the Canadian War Records Office for a commission to paint a large-scale war subject. In April 1918 he returned to London as an official war artist, with the proviso that the work should not be in the Cubist style. The outcome of the commission was &quot;The First German Gas Attack at Ypres&quot;, a powerful expressionist work that is on permanent display in the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa. Roberts was subsequently commissioned by the British Ministry of Information, for whom he painted &quot;A Shell Dump, France&quot; (1918–19), now in the Imperial War Museum collection along with twelve watercolour drawings of his experiences at the front They rival the bitterness and social realism of the German artists Otto Dix and George Grosz. In 1978 Roberts published a memoir of his experiences at the front – &quot;4.5 Howitzer Gunner RFA: Memories of the War to End War 1914–1918&quot;.

==1920s==
Roberts had met Sarah Kramer (1900–92) in 1915 through her brother Jacob Kramer, who also had studied at the Slade. Roberts had been writing to Sarah from the front, and shortly after the war was over they set up home together and had a son, John David Roberts (1919–95). They moved into rented rooms in Fitzrovia and were married in 1922. Roberts exhibited with Wyndham Lewis&#x27;s Group X, and Osbert Sitwell was an early patron.

Alongside his dramatic Cubist work, Roberts was a talented portrait painter. He honed his skills with portraits of Sarah – she would be his model and muse for the next 60 years. In 1923, while Roberts was preparing for a one-man show at the Chenil Gallery, Chelsea, the artist Colin Gill put Roberts in touch with T. E. Lawrence, who commissioned a series of portraits for his book &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot;. Finally shaking off his association with Wyndham Lewis, Roberts had evolved a unique and highly recognisable &#x27;English Cubist&#x27; style. His subject matter turned to urban life in London with paintings such as &quot;Bank Holiday in the Park&quot; and &quot;At the Hippodrome&quot;, which were exhibited with the London Group, and &quot;The Cinema&quot; – later acquired by the Tate Gallery. At this stage his oeuvre was quite broad, including scenes from &#x27;Greek Mythology [and] Christian Mythology&#x27;, as he put it. Lawrence commissioned further illustrations and decorations for &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot;, and there were also commissions of literary portraits and cover designs for private presses – such as a portrait of H. E. Bates for the &quot;New Coterie&quot; magazine in 1927. It was the purchase of a number of his paintings by the Contemporary Art Society for major provincial art galleries that kept Roberts financially afloat. He supplemented his income by teaching a life class with Bernard Meninsky at the Central School of Art for one day a week from 1925 – a post he held until 1960. Towards the end of the twenties his work became less down-beat. For example, &quot;The Tea Garden&quot; (1928) and &quot;The Chess Players&quot; (1929) provide a light take on social interaction and were perfectly in tune with the fashionable Art Deco style.

==1930s== 
In the 1930s the angular style of Roberts&#x27;s earlier work was replaced by a rounder, more sculptural approach. This change in style is, for example, apparent in the double portrait of John Maynard Keynes and Lydia Lopokova in the National Portrait Gallery, London. Keynes became an important patron of Roberts through the London Artists&#x27; Association, and the paintings that Keynes purchased are now in the collection of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. While Roberts was critical of the financial support that he received from the London Artists&#x27; Association, it is difficult to imagine how the family would have survived without this patronage. Later he would describe the thirties as &quot;the years of economic struggle&quot;. A number of striking large-scale canvases were undertaken in the early thirties, such as &quot;The Masks&quot; (1934) and &quot;The Playground (The Gutter)&quot; (1934–5), both works being exhibited at the Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, and in New York. Despite their financial position the family occasionally took holidays: they travelled to Spain for the first time in the early 1930s and went on a cycling holiday to Brighton that apparently inspired &quot;Les Routiers&quot;. Andrew Heard suggests that Roberts may have used a French title for this work as a nod towards the work of Fernand Léger, whose &quot;tubist&quot; forms have some similarity to Roberts&#x27;s figures.

==1940s==
Soon after the Second World War broke out, in September 1939 William and Sarah left London for Oxford. Roberts was too old for combat service, but enquired about the possibility of getting &#x27;some pictorial propaganda work to do&#x27;. He was frustrated at being offered only minor assignments for the War Artists&#x27; Advisory Committee. However, he did complete two commissions documenting life on the home front – &quot;Munitions Factory&quot; (1940) and &quot;The Control Room, Civil Defence Headquarters&quot;(1942) – both now in Salford Art Gallery. William and Sarah eventually spent most of the war years in a flat in Marston on the outskirts of Oxford. Roberts managed to get a one-day-a-week teaching job at Oxford Technical College. Throughout his life he drew inspiration from his surroundings, and a number of watercolour drawings from this period show rural scenes on the River Cherwell and a nearby Gypsy camp.

In 1946 he and Sarah returned to London and took a room at 14 St Mark&#x27;s Crescent, a house in multiple occupancy backing on to the Regent&#x27;s Canal, near Primrose Hill. When other tenants moved out the Robertses took over additional rooms, and eventually, with financial help from a friend of Sarah&#x27;s, they were able to buy the whole house. This house remained their home for the rest of their lives and the neighbourhood would provide Roberts with subject matter. The Roberts&#x27;s son, John, joined them. He had studied physics at University College London, and became a poet and guitar scholar. In 1948 Roberts showed work at the Royal Academy summer exhibition for the first time – a self-portrait and a portrait of Sarah in a headscarf as &quot;The Gypsy&quot; – and he would show work there in every subsequent year until his death.

==The Royal Academy and the &quot;Vortex Pamphlets&quot;==
In the 1950s, when cutting-edge British art was abstract, Roberts&#x27;s work was in danger of seeming out of date. Roberts re-evaluated the Royal Academy as an exhibiting opportunity, as it attracted large and diverse crowds that were generally more interested in representational art than in abstraction, as well as press coverage. From this point on Roberts&#x27;s annual contribution became increasingly sensational – spectacular in scale, in use of colour and in dramatic subject matter. &quot;The Temptation of St Anthony&quot; (1951), &quot;Revolt in the Desert&quot; (1952) and &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot; (1954) dominated the walls of the RA and were a talking point in the press and with the public. Roberts now had a new patron – Ernest Cooper, who ran a chain of health-food shops under the banner of the &quot;London Health Centre&quot;. As well as purchasing a large number of these Royal Academy paintings, Cooper commissioned Roberts to design illustrations for his mail-order catalogues and instructional pamphlets.

In 1956 the Tate Gallery held an exhibition entitled &quot;Wyndham Lewis and Vorticism&quot;, with 150 works by Lewis and a small selection by other artists to give &quot;an indication of the effect of his immediate impact upon his contemporaries&quot;. Roberts was offended that the catalogue &quot;would lead the uninitiated to suppose that the artists designated as &#x27;Other Vorticists&#x27; are in some way subservient to Lewis&quot;, and published a series of &quot;Vortex Pamphlets&quot;, in which he railed against the exhibition, the catalogue, the press coverage and the account of his own career contained in &quot;Modern English Painters&quot; by the Tate&#x27;s director, John Rothenstein, which appeared at about the same time. Targets of earlier visual satires had included Walter Sickert and Roger Fry. To publicise his own work he also published &quot;Some Early Abstract and Cubist Work 1913–1920&quot; (London, 1957), the first of a series of collections of reproductions of his paintings, with somewhat polemical prefaces.

==Late recognition==
In 1958 Roberts was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy, and two years later, when he turned 65, he retired from his one-day-a-week teaching position at the Central School. However, his output as an artist over the next fifteen years remained prolific. In 1961 he was given an award by the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation &quot;in recognition of his artistic achievement and his outstanding service to British painting&quot;. In that same year he began painting &quot;The Vorticists at the Restaurant de la Tour Eiffel, Spring 1915&quot; (completed 1962; now in the Tate Gallery), a nostalgic recollection of a boisterous Vorticist gathering in 1915 that can be read as an attempt by Roberts to build bridges following the &quot;Vortex Pamphlets&quot; debacle. A major retrospective of his work, organised by the Arts Council of Great Britain and curated by Ronald Alley, opened at the Tate Gallery in 1965, and a smaller version was also shown in Newcastle and Manchester. In the same year Roberts was offered, but rejected, an OBE. He was, however, pleased to be elected a full member of the Royal Academy in 1966. While still tackling a variety of subjects, Roberts became somewhat obsessed with the self-portrait, and a number of his self-portraits would be exhibited by the National Portrait Gallery in 1984.

Roberts was often described as reclusive, and he was very wary about interviewers – especially after an &quot;Observer&quot; journalist who visited him produced an article that Roberts felt was concerned more with his rather spartan lifestyle than with his work. &quot;What kind of art critic is this, who sets out to criticise my pictures, but criticises my gas stove and kitchen table instead?&quot; he asked.

In 1974 the Arts Council exhibition &quot;Vorticism and Its Allies&quot;, curated by Richard Cork, recognised Roberts&#x27;s important role within the group; however, when Cork approached him for an interview Roberts was uncooperative.

Unsurprisingly, in his eighties Roberts&#x27;s draughtsmanship deteriorated, but he continued working until the end – &quot;Donkey Rides&quot; was &quot;pinned to his drawing board on the day on which he died [20 Jan. 1980]&quot;.

==The fate of his estate==
Sarah Roberts died in 1992 and her and William&#x27;s son, John, died two and a half years later, intestate. John had set up the family house, 14 St Mark&#x27;s Crescent, as a &quot;house museum&quot; with a changing selection of his father&#x27;s paintings on show to friends. It was estimated that there were almost 475 paintings and drawings in the house at the time of his death, and the Tate Gallery agreed to store them for safe keeping. The fate of these works was of concern when &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2004 revealed that the Treasury Solicitor, who had control of John&#x27;s estate, refused to lend to the major Roberts retrospective, curated by Andrew Heard, at the Hatton Gallery in Newcastle upon Tyne and the Graves Art Gallery in Sheffield. Since then the collection has been saved, with 117 of these works having been allocated to the Tate in lieu of inheritance tax, and the Tate continuing to house the remainder until the period when claims may be made on the estate has expired, when they too will enter the Tate collection. A number of the drawings allocated to the Tate went on display at Tate Britain in 2012–13. In 2004 &quot;William Roberts: An English Cubist&quot; by Andrew Gibbon Williams, the standard monograph on this painter, was published.

Between 1998 and 2015 the William Roberts Society furthered the appreciation and promotion of Roberts&#x27;s work, being established as a registered charity in 2002 and publishing regular newsletters and occasional pamphlets. 

English Heritage unveiled a blue plaque at 14 St Mark&#x27;s Crescent in 2003. A short film &quot;William Roberts: An Artist&#x27;s House&quot; is accessible on YouTube. In 2007 Pallant House Gallery staged an exhibition &quot;William Roberts: England at Play&quot;, curated by Simon Martin. The sale of the Evill/Frost collection at Sotheby&#x27;s in London in 2011 saw unprecedentedly high prices for Roberts&#x27;s work, and in the following year &quot;The Chess Players&quot; (1929–30) was sold for over £1 million, also at Sotheby&#x27;s.

<doc id="1041766" wikidata="Q5232676" url="?curid=1041766" title="David Croll">
<text>David Arnold Croll, (born Davud Avrum Croll; March 12, 1900 – June 11, 1991) was a Canadian politician. He served as the mayor of Windsor, Ontario twice. He entered provincial politics in the 1930s, and served as minister of public works and municipal affairs in the Mitch Hepburn government. He won election to the House of Commons of Canada in 1945. In 1955 he was appointed to the Senate of Canada, becoming the first Jewish Senator. He served as a senator until his death, on June 11, 1991, a few hours after what would be his last senate sitting.

==Early life==
Croll was born in Moscow, Russia and was brought to Canada with his family as a young boy, at which point his name was anglicized. Croll became a lawyer and entered politics serving as mayor of Windsor, Ontario from 1931 to 1934 during the worst days of the Great Depression. He made his reputation as a social reformer when he insisted the city go into deficit in order to provide relief programs for the unemployed and destitute.

==Provincial politics==
Croll won a seat in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a Liberal Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Windsor—Walkerville in the 1934 election that brought the Liberals to power under the leadership of Mitchell Hepburn. Croll became Canada&#x27;s first Jewish cabinet minister when he became Minister of Public Welfare. He later also added the portfolios of Minister of Municipal Affairs and Minister of Labour. He and Attorney-General Arthur Roebuck broke with Hepburn over the Premier&#x27;s opposition to the United Auto Workers strike against General Motors in Oshawa in 1937, and resigned from cabinet saying &quot;I would rather walk with the workers than ride with General Motors.&quot; He remained a provincial Liberal backbencher until 1943, as well as serving again as Mayor of Windsor.

==Military service==
He served in the Canadian Army during the Second World War, enlisting as a Private in the Essex Scottish Regiment and rising in rank to lieutenant-colonel.

==Federal politics==
He was recruited by the Liberal Party of Canada to contest the Toronto riding of Spadina in the 1945 federal election. The Liberals feared that Tim Buck, leader of the communist Labor-Progressive Party was poised to win the riding. The popular Croll was seen as the only Liberal who could defeat him. After Croll was nominated, Buck instead ran in a neighbouring riding, leaving Sam Carr to be the LPP&#x27;s candidate. Croll handily won a seat in the House of Commons of Canada, becoming Spadina&#x27;s Member of Parliament (MP) and Tory Toronto&#x27;s sole Liberal MP. He was re-elected in the 1949 and 1953 elections.

Despite being regarded as one of the most talented Liberal MPs and, until 1950, the only Liberal MP from Toronto, Croll was never summoned to the Canadian Cabinet where he would have become the first Jewish federal cabinet minister. Instead, he was appointed to the Senate of Canada in 1955, becoming Canada&#x27;s first Jewish senator. In the early 1950s, Croll drew attention when he attacked the early release of Nazi war criminals.&quot;We are still dealing with a people who are undemocratic and unrepentant, who consider themselves unfortunate and whose chief objective at present is to figure out the winning side and get on it. Fears of the rearming of Germany were not allayed when we read of the reappearance on the present scene of left-over and warmed-up Nazi generals and some of the manifestations of Fascism. Ex-German generals, former Nazi leaders and war criminals are starting to roll off the Allied amnesty assembly lines.&quot;

Croll was the author of the influential 1971 &quot;Report of the Special Senate Committee on Poverty&quot; which began with the words &quot;the poor do not choose poverty. It is at once their affliction and our national shame. The children of the poor (and there are many) are the most helpless victims of all, and find even less hope in a society where welfare systems from the very beginning destroys their chances of a better life.&quot; The report moved the Trudeau government to triple family allowances in 1973 and institute the Child Tax Credit in 1978. Aside from his work on poverty, he was also responsible for Senate reports on aging. In 1990 in recognition of his contributions, he was sworn into the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada, an honour usually given only to federal cabinet ministers.

He remained an active senator until his death, even taking his seat in the &quot;Red Chamber&quot; a few hours before his death. He died of heart failure in the Château Laurier Hotel, a few hours after attending an afternoon senate session on June 11, 1991. At the time, he was the oldest serving senator, as he was appointed at a time when appointments to the senate were for life.

In his honour, the Senator David A. Croll Apartments, a seniors&#x27; residence in Toronto was named after him. The irony is that the building was originally the focus of Toronto&#x27;s late 1960s youth counterculture, infamous Rochdale College, built by Campus Co-operative Student Residences (Campus Co-op) in 1968 as a student co-operative residence. The building was selected, as a pilot project, for installing Canada&#x27;s first rooftop combined heat and power system.

<doc id="1041799" wikidata="Q48619" url="?curid=1041799" title="Bobby Deol">
<text>Vijay Singh Deol (born 27 January 1969), better known by his screen name Bobby Deol, is an Indian actor who primarily works in Hindi cinema. A member of the Deol family, he is the younger son of actor Dharmendra and brother of actor Sunny Deol.

After appearing as a child artist in &quot;Dharam Veer&quot; (1977), Deol had his first lead role in the romance &quot;Barsaat&quot; (1995), which won him the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut. He subsequently appeared in the commercially successful action thriller films &quot;Gupt&quot; (1997), &quot;Soldier&quot; (1998), &quot;Badal&quot; (2000), &quot;Bichhoo&quot; (2000), &quot;Ajnabee&quot; (2001), and &quot;Humraaz&quot; (2002). The last of these earned him a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. It was followed by a career downturn, during which his commercially successful projects were the ensemble films &quot;Apne&quot; (2007), &quot;Yamla Pagla Deewana&quot; (2011), &quot;Race 3&quot; (2018) and &quot;Housefull 4&quot; (2019).

Deol has since starred in the streaming projects &quot;Class of &#x27;83&quot; (2020), &quot;Aashram&quot; (2020–present) and &quot;Love Hostel&quot; (2022). He then played a villainous role in the top-grossing action film &quot;Animal&quot; (2023), which earned him a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor.

== Early life and family ==
Deol was born as Vijay Singh Deol on 27 January 1969 into a Punjabi Jat family in Bombay. He grew up as a Hindu affiliated with the Arya Samaj movement. He is the second son of Bollywood actor Dharmendra and Parkash Kaur. He is the younger brother of Sunny Deol and also has two sisters Vijayta and Ajeeta who live in California. His step-mother is Hema Malini, through whom he has two paternal half-sisters, actress Esha Deol and Ahana Deol. His cousin Abhay Deol is also an actor. He is the paternal uncle of Bollywood actors Karan Deol and Rajveer Deol.

He married Tanya Ahuja in 1996; the couple has two sons.

== Acting career ==
=== Early success (1995–2003) ===
Deol made his acting debut as an adult alongside Twinkle Khanna in Rajkumar Santoshi&#x27;s 1995 romance film &quot;Barsaat&quot;, where he played a naive but intelligent young man who moves from a small village to the big city and gets caught up with corrupt police and criminal gangs amidst falling in love. The film was a superhit at the box office and garnered him the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut. He replicated this success with his next starring role in Rajiv Rai&#x27;s suspense thriller &quot;&quot; (1997) alongside Manisha Koirala and Kajol, as a man accused of murdering his stepfather over an engagement proposal and wrongly imprisoned. Besides commercial profitability, &quot;Gupt&quot; was highly acclaimed for its storyline and soundtrack. His other release of 1997 was &quot;Aur Pyaar Ho Gaya&quot; alongside Aishwarya Rai, which flopped at the box office.

Deol&#x27;s first release of 1998, Vidhu Vinod Chopra&#x27;s &quot;Kareeb&quot;, became his second consecutive flop. He teamed up with Abbas–Mustan for the first of many collaborations in the military thriller &quot;Soldier&quot; (1998), co-starring Raakhee and Preity Zinta, in which played the son of a man who was convicted of arms smuggling. &quot;Soldier&quot; received highly positive response from critics and proved to be his third clean hit, post &quot;Barsaat&quot; and &quot;Gupt&quot;. His sole release of 1999 was the unremarkable love triangle &quot;Dillagi&quot;, directed by his brother Sunny Deol.

Deol began the next century starring with Rani Mukerji in the financially successful action dramas &quot;Badal&quot; and &quot;Bichhoo&quot; (both 2000). In &quot;Badal&quot;, set around the 1984 riots in engulfing parts of Punjab and Delhi, his character witnesses the massacre of his family and villagers by a corrupt inspector and grows up to be a dreaded terrorist. In &quot;Bichhoo&quot;, Deol&#x27;s role as a young middle-class guy who falls in love with a wealthy woman was panned although the film hailed good box-office returns. He was later paired with Karisma Kapoor in &quot;Hum To Mohabbat Karega&quot; (2000) and &quot;Aashiq&quot; (2001), both flops. Deol next essayed a married guy entangled in a web of deceit and extra-marital affairs, in Abbas–Mustan&#x27;s thriller &quot;Ajnabee&quot; (2001) alongside Kareena Kapoor, Akshay Kumar and Bipasha Basu. The film was an average grosser, but garnered praise for Kumar and Deol&#x27;s performances.

He reunited with Sunny Deol for the failed historical drama &quot;23rd March 1931: Shaheed&quot; (2002), where he and his brother portrayed the roles of freedom fighters Bhagat Singh and Chandra Shekhar Azad respectively. Set in British India, the film depicts the events leading up to the hanging of Bhagat Singh and his companions Rajguru and Sukhdev on 23 March 1931. With the film receiving polarising reviews, &quot;Rediff.com&quot; believed the movie had plenty of good moments, and plenty of bad ones and believed the film was superior to that of the original on Bhagat Singh, although they believed the agony of Bhagat Singh&#x27;s fight was underplayed, diminishing the brutality and anguish suffered in the real-life event. While Deol was praised for some scenes, he was criticised for his loud acting and &quot;Rediff.com&quot; believed he was overshadowed by Ajay Devgan in &quot;The Legend of Bhagat Singh&quot; remarking, &quot;In terms of performance, Devgan is clearly the winner, with the advantage of a stronger script and a better director. Devgan, who reportedly lost weight to look the part, is today emerging as one of India&#x27;s finest actors, willing to try out different roles. Deol tries his best, but it is difficult to shout and act simultaneously.&quot;

Later in 2002, Deol was nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his role as a suave, wealthy shipping businessman in Abbas-Mustan&#x27;s romantic thriller &quot;Humraaz&quot;, where he was involved in a love triangle with Ameesha Patel and Akshaye Khanna. The film was moderately successful but received positive reviews from critics, with Chitra Mahesh of &quot;The Hindu&quot; saying, &quot;Deol spends the entire first half looking moony eyed and spaced out, but overcomes the stupor towards the end where he actually gives a good performance.&quot; His final act in 2002 was of a small-time crook who gets his hands on some diamonds worth millions, in David Dhawan&#x27;s &quot;Chor Machaaye Shor&quot; alongside Shilpa Shetty, Bipasha Basu, Paresh Rawal and Om Puri.

=== Career setback and hiatus (2004–2017) ===
After a one-year gap, Deol returned with &quot;Kismat&quot; (2004) pairing Priyanka Chopra. He went on to play army officers in his next two 2004 releases, Vikram Bhatt&#x27;s &quot;Bardaasht&quot; and Anil Sharma&#x27;s &quot;Ab Tumhare Hawale Watan Saathiyo&quot;. While the former dealt with themes of police brutality and corruption and justice, the latter was an ensemble film starring Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar and Deol (in a double role). All these films did not perform well commercially. However for the lattermost, he received praise for his role which had him wear a pugh/turban, which gave him more of an audience from the Punjabi crowd, and inspired comments saying he looks better in a turban.

Deol reteamed with Vikram Bhatt for the thriller &quot;Jurm&quot; (2005), hailing praise for his role as a wealthy businessman who suspects his wife of having an affair with Rohit. &quot;Rediff.com&quot; remarked &quot;Bobby Deol, Bhatt&#x27;s schoolmate, does his alma mater proud with his controlled performance. There&#x27;s a sense of maturity about his candour, which is good news.&quot; He also essayed a trooper operating in the northeastern Indian province fighting Bodo militants in Upper Assam alongside Sanjay Dutt, Suniel Shetty and Ajay Devgn in Mani Shankar&#x27;s war film &quot;Tango Charlie&quot; and an ambitious Indian living abroad with Chopra and Basu in Suneel Darshan&#x27;s love triangle &quot;Barsaat&quot; (both 2005). Neither of these films resurged his commercial appeal, with Ziya us Salaam of &quot;The Hindu&quot; concluding for &quot;Barsaat&quot;, &quot;A moth-eaten love triangle with all the stereotypes Bollywood survives on – a devoted wife with her &quot;karva chauth ki thali&quot;, the other woman with her mini-skirts, a joint family, songs, festivities... No shower of rejuvenation, this &quot;Barsaat&quot; is just drenched in mediocrity.&quot; He was equally unimpressed with Deol&#x27;s performance, remarking, &quot;The girls are ready with their curls and curves, the guy just appears lost, making you wonder if Bobby has grown even an inch as an actor since he made his debut in Rajkumar Santoshi&#x27;s film of the same name.&quot;

His final role of 2005 was &quot;&quot; with Akshay Kumar, Lara Dutta, Kareena Kapoor and Juhi Chawla, which underperformed in India but was a major success in the United Kingdom. In 2006, Deol reunited with Ameesha Patel in the romantic musical film &quot;Humko Tumse Pyaar Hai&quot;, where his characters falls in love with a beautiful blind woman who has a talent for shaping pottery. Their pairing was hugely hyped and had been labelled as the &quot;Bollywood equivalent of Hugh Grant and Renée Zellweger&quot;. Although the film became his eighth consecutive failure, critics praised Deol&#x27;s performance with Taran Adarsh commenting, &quot;Bobby Deol is only getting better as an actor. He manages to register an impact in a film that belongs to Patel and Rampal primarily.&quot;

In 2007, Deol had a record 6 releases, including two cameos. The first, &quot;Shakalaka Boom Boom&quot;, was shot in South Africa and addressed the themes of envy, jealousy, insecurity, anxiety, manipulation and anger. Co-starring Upen Patel, Kangana Ranaut and Celina Jaitley, it was praised by critics, especially for its choreography; Taran Adarsh of &quot;IndiaFM.com&quot; said after viewing the film, &quot;Both Bobby and Upen get fabulous roles and the two actors make the most of it. Bobby is one of the most under-rated actors around. His work has been consistent all through, but one tends to overlook this talented actor&#x27;s abilities all the while. Watch him go negative in &quot;Shakalaka Boom Boom&quot; and you&#x27;d agree that he&#x27;s amongst the best in the business today. His outburst in the end is remarkable.&quot; He next featured in Shaad Ali and Yash Raj Films&#x27;s &quot;Jhoom Barabar Jhoom&quot; opposite Abhishek Bachchan, Preity Zinta and Lara Dutta. The film had a hit soundtrack but received negative reviews for its &quot;shallow screenplay&quot;, and even Deol was believed to have been overshadowed by Bachchan and Zinta. Both films failed to do well, continuing the streak of decline for Deol.

Deol finally found a commercial success in Anil Sharma&#x27;s boxing drama &quot;Apne&quot; (2007), a family affair in which his father Dharmendra played a disgraced retired boxer who trains Deol and his brother (Sunny Deol) to become champion boxers but in doing so creates a rift within the family. He reteamed with Abbas–Mustan for his last release of 2007, the romantic thriller &quot;Naqaab&quot;, with Akshaye Khanna and Urvashi Sharma. Deol received mixed reviews for his performance. For instance, Raja Sen of &quot;Rediff.com&quot; praised several of his scenes, remarking, &quot;Bobby gets a considerably meaty role, and there are a couple of moments when he genuinely works the audience&quot;, but describes his character as &quot;sensitive to an annoying hilt&quot;. &quot;Naqaab&quot; was a major commercial disaster.

In 2008, Deol starred as an orphan raised by a Naxal leader opposite Priyanka Chopra, Danny Denzongpa and Irrfan Khan in Kabeer Kaushik&#x27;s crime drama &quot;Chamku&quot;, set in the interiors of Bihar. Kaushik initially approached him to play the lead role in his debut film, &quot;Sehar&quot;, but despite liking the script, Deol had turned it down because at the time he was not prepared to work with a debutant director. He worked in another failed ensemble film &quot;Heroes&quot; (2008) as an army officer with Salman Khan, Preity Zinta, Sunny Deol and Mithun Chakraborty. &quot;Heroes&quot; was filmed in Ladakh, Chandigarh, Punjab and Delhi. Deol had a special appearance in the Karan Johar-produced romantic comedy &quot;Dostana&quot; (2008) starring Chopra, Bachchan and John Abraham. &quot;Dostana&quot; is the first Bollywood film to be filmed entirely in Miami, United States and went on to become the eighth highest-grossing film at the Indian box office in 2008.

The following year, Deol portrayed an orphan-turned-assassin wrongly accused of a politician&#x27;s murder in the unnoticed &quot;&quot; (2009). His next film &quot;Help&quot; (2010), shot in Mauritius, too failed to make an impact. In 2011, Deol had starring roles in the comedies &quot;Yamla Pagla Deewana&quot; (co-starring Dharmendra and Sunny Deol), which spawned a sequel later in 2013, and &quot;Thank You&quot; (co-starring Kumar, Irrfan Khan, Suniel Shetty and Sonam Kapoor). His following release, the heist film &quot;Players&quot; (2012), featured him as a master of illusions. Neither of these films except &quot;Yamla Pagla Deewana&quot; were critically and commercially profitable.

After a slew of commercial failures, Deol went on a hiatus of three years due to lack of work. He later spoke on &quot;Koffee with Karan&quot; where he confessed,
Following the hiatus, he tried to make a comeback with Shreyas Talpade&#x27;s &quot;Poster Boys&quot; (2017) alongside Sunny Deol. However, the film turned out to be another failure and failed to re-establish Deol.

=== Ensemble films and streaming projects (2018–2022) ===

Deol had a supporting role in the action thriller &quot;Race 3&quot; (2018), alongside Salman Khan and Anil Kapoor. Despite receiving negative reviews, it grossed 303 crore worldwide becoming the sixth highest-earning Hindi film of 2018. The threequel &quot;Yamla Pagla Deewana: Phir Se&quot; was his second release of the year, which tanked miserably at the box office repeating the fate of &quot;Yamla Pagla Deewana 2&quot;.

The ensemble comedy &quot;Housefull 4&quot; (2019) co-starring Akshay Kumar and Riteish Deshmukh, was Deol&#x27;s subsequent film. It grossed 295 crore worldwide and became a superhit. He played a police officer in the Netflix film &quot;Class of &#x27;83&quot; (2020). His performance earned him a Filmfare OTT Award for Best Actor in a Web Original Film nomination. In 2020, his web series &quot;Aashram&quot; premiered on MX Player original series where he played the character of Baba Nirala. Deol&#x27;s role of an antagonist earned him much critical praise and two nominations for the Filmfare OTT Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series, and this made him repeat villainous roles in his next films &quot;Love Hostel&quot; (2022), which also featured Sanya Malhotra and Vikrant Massey, and &quot;Animal&quot; (2023).

===Career expansion (2023–present)===
Deol achieved a significant turning point in his career portraying the main antagonist alongside Ranbir Kapoor and Anil Kapoor in Sandeep Reddy Vanga&#x27;s action drama &quot;Animal&quot; (2023). The film emerged as a major commercial success at the box-office, grossing over 917 crore worldwide. Despite the film&#x27;s mixed reception, his portrayal of a mute psychopath was praised although several critics felt that his part was too brief. &quot;Firstpost&quot; called Deol&#x27;s performance &quot;menacing&quot; and a standout element of the film, praising that &quot;[Deol] showcases remarkable emotive skills without the use of dialogues, leaving audiences in awe of his ability to convey emotions through expressions alone.&quot; &quot;Animal&quot; solidified Deol&#x27;s comeback in Hindi cinema. His performance earned him a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor, and garnered him both the IIFA Award and the Zee Cine Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role.

In 2024, Deol played a negative role opposite Suriya in the Tamil period action drama &quot;Kanguva&quot;, which ranks amongst the most expensive Indian films. However, it turned out to be a box-office bomb through negative reviews.

Deol will next star in the Telugu action dramas Daaku Maharaaj and Hari Hara Veera Mallu, the YRF Spy Universe film &quot;Alpha&quot;, Priyadarshan&#x27;s next comedy thriller alongside Saif Ali Khan, Anurag Kashyap&#x27;s yet-untitled thriller with Sanya Malhotra, Abbas–Mustan&#x27;s long delayed &quot;Penthouse&quot; and Aryan Khan&#x27;s web series &quot;Stardom&quot;.

<text>Manoel Dias Soeiro (; 1604 – 20 November 1657), better known by his Hebrew name Menasseh or Menashe ben Israel (), was a Jewish scholar, rabbi, kabbalist, writer, diplomat, printer, publisher, and founder of the first Hebrew printing press (named &quot;Emeth Meerets Titsmah&quot;) in Amsterdam in 1626.

==Life==
Menasseh was born in La Rochelle in 1604, with the name Manoel Dias Soeiro, a year after his parents had left mainland Portugal because of the Inquisition. The family moved to the Netherlands in 1610. The Netherlands was in the middle of a process of religious revolt against Catholic Spanish rule throughout the Eighty Years&#x27; War (1568–1648). Amsterdam was an important center of Jewish life in Europe at this time. The family&#x27;s arrival in 1610 was during the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce mediated by France and England at The Hague. In Amsterdam he studied under Moses Raphael de Aguilar.

Menasseh rose to eminence not only as a rabbi and an author, but also as a printer. He established the first Hebrew press in Holland. One of his earliest works, &quot;El Conciliador&quot;, published in 1632, won immediate reputation; it was an attempt to reconcile apparent discrepancies in various parts of the Hebrew Bible. Among his correspondents were Gerardus Vossius, Hugo Grotius, Petrus Serrarius, António Vieira and Pierre Daniel Huet. In 1638, he decided to settle in Brazil, as he still found it difficult to provide for his wife and family in Amsterdam. He may have visited the Dutch colony&#x27;s capital of Recife, but did not move there. One of the reasons his financial situation improved in Amsterdam was the arrival of two Portuguese Jewish entrepreneurs, the brothers Abraham and Isaac Pereyra. They hired Rabbi Manasseh to direct a small college or academy (a &quot;yeshibah&quot; in Spanish-Portuguese parlance of the time) they had founded in the city.

In 1644, Menasseh met Antonio de Montezinos, a Portuguese traveler and Marrano Sephardic Jew who had been in the New World. Montezinos convinced him of his conclusion that the South America Andes&#x27; Indians were the descendants of the lost ten tribes of Israel. This purported discovery gave a new impulse to Menasseh&#x27;s Messianic hopes, as the settlement of Jews throughout the world was supposed to be a sign that the Messiah would come. Filled with this idea, he turned his attention to England, whence the Jews had been expelled since 1290. He worked to get them permission to settle there again and thus hasten the Messiah&#x27;s coming.

With the start of the Commonwealth, the question of the readmission of the Jews had found increased Puritan support, but it was often mooted under the growing desire for religious liberty. In addition, Messianic and other mystic hopes were then current in England. His book, &quot;The Hope of Israel&quot;, was first published in Amsterdam in Latin (&quot;Spes Israelis&quot;) and in Spanish (&quot;Esperança de Israel&quot;) in 1650. The book was written in response to a 1648 letter from John Dury enquiring about Montezinos&#x27; claims. In addition to reporting Montezinos&#x27; accounts of Jews in the Americas, the book also expressed the hope that the Jews would return to England as a way of hastening the coming of the messiah. Menasseh also stresses his kinship with parliament, and explains himself as driven by amity for England rather than financial gain.

In 1651 he offered to serve Christina, Queen of Sweden as her agent of Hebrew books. The same year he met Oliver St John and his envoys on his mission to secure an Anglo-Dutch coalition (which would have given Dutch citizens, and thus Jews, privileges to stay and work in England). The English were impressed by learning and manner, and advised him to formally apply for Jewish readmission to England. In 1652 &quot;The Hope of Israel&quot; was translated from Latin into English by John Dury or one of his associates, and it was published in London by Moses Wall, prefixed with a dedication to the Parliament and the Council of State; his account of descendants of the Lost Tribes being found in the New World deeply impressed public opinion and stirred up many polemics in English literature. This included a debate between Edward Spencer and Moses Wall, an MP and a scholar respectively, on ben Israel&#x27;s millennial claims and the manner in which the Jews would be converted. Wall and Spencer&#x27;s letters were printed in later additions of the book. Despite their historic misfortunes and movements, Menasseh characterizes the condition of Jewry at the time by saying:
Oliver Cromwell was sympathetic to the Jewish cause, partly because of his tolerant leanings but chiefly because he foresaw the importance for English commerce of the participation of the Jewish merchant princes, some of whom had already made their way to London. At this juncture, the English gave Jews full rights in the colony of Surinam, which they had controlled since 1650. There is some debate among historians concerning whether Menasseh&#x27;s motives for pursuing the readmission of the Jews by England were primarily political or religious. Ismar Schorsch, for example, has argued that the idea of England being a final place for Jews to inhabit in order to bring about the coming of the Messiah was hardly present in &quot;The Hope of Israel&quot; (1652), but rather was developed by Menasseh later (1656-57 when he was in London) in order to appeal to English Christians with Millenarian beliefs. Henry Méchoulan, on the other hand, in his later in-depth detailed analysis of the book has striven to show that the Jewish messianic theme in it is also rather fundamental to its initial conception. Steven Nadler, in his 2018 book, which is actually the last word on Menasseh&#x27;s biography to be published to date, has seemingly also closed the debate on this issue of Menasseh&#x27;s own messianic beliefs:
In November 1655, Menasseh arrived in London. During his absence from the Netherlands, the Amsterdam rabbis excommunicated his student, Baruch Spinoza. In London, Menasseh published his &quot;Humble Addresses to the Lord Protector&quot;, but its effect was weakened by William Prynne&#x27;s publication of &quot;Short Demurrer&quot;. Cromwell summoned the Whitehall Conference in December of the same year.

Some of the most notable statesmen, lawyers, and theologians of the day were summoned to this conference to discuss whether the Jews should be readmitted to England. The chief practical result was the declaration of judges Glynne and Steele that &quot;there was no law which forbade the Jews&#x27; return to England&quot; (as they had been expelled by royal decree of King Edward I, and not by formal parliamentary action; Jews remaining in England lived, however, under constant threat of expulsion). Though nothing was done to regularize the position of the Jews, the door was opened to their gradual return. On 14 December 1655, John Evelyn entered in his &quot;Diary,&quot; &quot;Now were the Jews admitted.&quot; When Prynne and others attacked the Jews, Menasseh wrote his major work, &quot;Vindiciae judaeorum&quot; (1656), in response.

Menasseh ben Israel stayed in England for close to two years after the Whitehall Conference. During this time he tried to obtain written permission for the resettlement of the Jews in England. Although he failed in this endeavour, during his stay he met with a large number of influential figures of the age, including Cambridge theologian Ralph Cudworth, Henry Oldenburg, Robert Boyle and his sister, Adam Boreel, John Sadler, John Dury and Samuel Hartlib, as well as more marginal prophetic figures such as Ambrose Barnes and Arise Evans. Ben Israel&#x27;s stay was managed by the millenarian philosemite Baptist clergyman Henry Jessey.

==Death and burial==

In February 1657 Cromwell granted ben Israel a state pension of £100, but he died before enjoying it, at Middelburg in the Netherlands in the winter of 1657 (14 &quot;Kislev&quot; 5418). He was conveying the body of his son Samuel home for burial.

His grave is in the Beth Haim of Ouderkerk aan de Amstel. and remains intact (headstone and gravestone).

==Writings==

Menasseh ben Israel was the author of many works. His major work &quot;Nishmat Hayim&quot; is a treatise in Hebrew on the Jewish concept of reincarnation of souls, published by his son Samuel six years before they both died. Some scholars think that he studied kabbalah with Abraham Cohen de Herrera, a disciple of Israel Saruk. This would explain his familiarity with the method of Isaac Luria.

&quot;The Conciliator&quot; was, as above, a work written to reconcile the apparent contradictions in numerous passages throughout the Bible. To achieve this aim, Ben Israel &quot;utilized an astounding range of sources&quot;; primarily the Talmud and the classic Jewish commentaries but frequently quotes from the early Christian authorities as well as Greek and Latin authors of antiquity. Written in Spanish, in Amsterdam, 1632, it was aimed primarily to strengthen the faith of the Marranos in the veracity of the Tanach according to Jewish interpretation. It was translated by Elias Haim Lindo and published by Duncan and Malcolm, in 1842, and again in 1972, with footnotes and introductory material by Sepher-Hermon Press.

==Descendants==
Menasseh&#x27;s wife, Rachel, was a descendant of the Abarbanel family. Menasseh had three children by her. According to family legend, the Abarbanels were descendants of King David, and he was proud of his children&#x27;s Davidic ancestry. Both of Menasseh&#x27;s sons predeceased their father. Menasseh&#x27;s eldest son was Samuel Abarbanel Soeiro, also known as Samuel Ben Israel, who worked as a printer and assisted his father with matters in England. He died in 1657. Menasseh&#x27;s youngest son, Joseph, died at age 20, in 1650, on a disastrous business trip to Poland. Menasseh also had a daughter, Gracia, born 1628, who married Samuel Abarbanel Barboza in 1646, and died in 1690.

Moses Jacob Ezekiel, the American sculptor, in his autobiography claimed to be a descendant of Menasseh Ben Israel. His claim is unconfirmed.

<doc id="1041812" wikidata="Q3978010" url="?curid=1041812" title="Superpotential">
<text>In theoretical physics, the superpotential is a function in supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Given a superpotential, two &quot;partner potentials&quot; are derived that can each serve as a potential in the Schrödinger equation. The partner potentials have the same spectrum, apart from a possible eigenvalue of zero, meaning that the physical systems represented by the two potentials have the same characteristic energies, apart from a possible zero-energy ground state.

==One-dimensional example==

Consider a one-dimensional, non-relativistic particle with a two state internal degree of freedom called &quot;spin&quot;. (This is not quite the usual notion of spin encountered in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, because &quot;real&quot; spin applies only to particles in three-dimensional space.) Let &quot;b&quot; and its Hermitian adjoint &quot;b&quot;† signify operators which transform a &quot;spin up&quot; particle into a &quot;spin down&quot; particle and vice versa, respectively. Furthermore, take &quot;b&quot; and &quot;b&quot;† to be normalized such that the anticommutator {&quot;b&quot;,&quot;b&quot;†} equals 1, and take that &quot;b&quot;2 equals 0. Let &quot;p&quot; represent the momentum of the particle and &quot;x&quot; represent its position with [&quot;x&quot;,&quot;p&quot;]=i, where we use natural units so that formula_1. Let &quot;W&quot; (the superpotential) represent an arbitrary differentiable function of &quot;x&quot; and define the supersymmetric operators &quot;Q&quot;1 and &quot;Q&quot;2 as

:formula_2
:formula_3

The operators &quot;Q&quot;1 and &quot;Q&quot;2 are self-adjoint. Let the Hamiltonian be

:formula_4

where &quot;W&quot;&#x27; signifies the derivative of &quot;W&quot;. Also note that {&quot;Q&quot;1,&quot;Q&quot;2}=0. Under these circumstances, the above system is a toy model of &quot;N&quot;=2 supersymmetry. The spin down and spin up states are often referred to as the &quot;bosonic&quot; and &quot;fermionic&quot; states, respectively, in an analogy to quantum field theory. With these definitions, &quot;Q&quot;1 and &quot;Q&quot;2 map &quot;bosonic&quot; states into &quot;fermionic&quot; states and vice versa. Restricting to the bosonic or fermionic sectors gives two partner potentials determined by

:formula_5

==In four spacetime dimensions==

In supersymmetric quantum field theories with four spacetime dimensions, which might have some connection to nature, it turns out that scalar fields arise as the lowest component of a chiral superfield, which tends to automatically be complex valued. We may identify the complex conjugate of a chiral superfield as an anti-chiral superfield. There are two possible ways to obtain an action from a set of superfields:
* Integrate a superfield on the whole superspace spanned by formula_6 and formula_7,

or

* Integrate a chiral superfield on the chiral half of a superspace, spanned by formula_6 and formula_9, not on formula_10.

The second option tells us that an arbitrary holomorphic function of a set of chiral superfields can show up as a term in a Lagrangian which is invariant under supersymmetry. In this context, holomorphic means that the function can only depend on the chiral superfields, not their complex conjugates. We may call such a function &quot;W&quot;, the superpotential. The fact that &quot;W&quot; is holomorphic in the chiral superfields helps explain why supersymmetric theories are relatively tractable, as it allows one to use powerful mathematical tools from complex analysis. Indeed, it is known that &quot;W&quot; receives no perturbative corrections, a result referred to as the perturbative non-renormalization theorem. Note that non-perturbative processes may correct this, for example through contributions to the beta functions due to instantons.

<text>Tirumalai Krishnamacharya (18 November 1888 – 28 February 1989) was an Indian yoga teacher, ayurvedic healer and scholar. He is seen as one of the most important gurus of modern yoga, and is often called &quot;Father of Modern Yoga&quot; for his wide influence on the development of postural yoga. Like earlier pioneers influenced by physical culture such as Yogendra and Kuvalayananda, he contributed to the revival of hatha yoga.

Krishnamacharya held degrees in all the six Vedic &quot;darśanas&quot;, or Indian philosophies. While under the patronage of the King of Mysore, Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV, Krishnamacharya traveled around India giving lectures and demonstrations to promote yoga, including such feats as apparently stopping his heartbeat. He is widely considered as the architect of &quot;vinyāsa&quot;, in the sense of combining breathing with movement; the style of yoga he created has come to be called Viniyoga or Vinyasa Krama Yoga. Underlying all of Krishnamacharya&#x27;s teachings was the principle &quot;Teach what is appropriate for an individual.&quot; While he is revered in other parts of the world as a yogi, in India Krishnamacharya is mainly known as a healer who drew from both ayurvedic and yogic traditions to restore health and well-being to those he treated. He wrote four books on yoga—&quot;Yoga Makaranda&quot; (1934), &quot;Yogaasanagalu&quot; (c. 1941), &quot;Yoga Rahasya&quot;, and &quot;Yogavalli&quot; (Chapter 1 – 1988)—as well as several essays and poetic compositions.

Krishnamacharya&#x27;s students included many of yoga&#x27;s most renowned and influential teachers: Indra Devi (1899–2002); K. Pattabhi Jois (1915–2009); B. K. S. Iyengar (1918-2014); his son T. K. V. Desikachar (1938-2016); Srivatsa Ramaswami (born 1939); and A. G. Mohan (born 1945). Iyengar, his brother-in-law and founder of Iyengar Yoga, credits Krishnamacharya with encouraging him to learn yoga as a boy in 1934.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===

Krishnamacharya was born on 18 November 1888 in Muchukundapura, in the Chitradurga district of present-day Karnataka, in South India, to an orthodox Telugu Iyengar family. His parents were Tirumalai Srinivasa Tatacharya, a well-known teacher of the Vedas, and Ranganayakiamma. Krishnamacharya was the eldest of six children. He had two brothers and three sisters. At the age of six, he underwent the educational sacrament of upanayana. He then began learning to speak and write Sanskrit, from texts such as the &quot;Amarakosha&quot; and to chant the Vedas under the strict tutelage of his father.

When Krishnamacharya was ten, his father died. At the age of twelve, he went to Mysore, then the largest city in Karnataka, where his great-grandfather, Srinivasa Brahmatantra Parakala Swami, was the head of the Parakala Matha. He continued his studies under his great-grandfather&#x27;s guidance and at Mysore University.

=== Education ===

Krishnamacharya spent much of his youth traveling through India studying the six &quot;darśana&quot; or Indian philosophies: &quot;vaiśeṣika&quot;, &quot;nyāya&quot;, &quot;sāṃkhya&quot;, &quot;yoga&quot;, &quot;mīmāṃsā&quot; and &quot;vedānta&quot;. In 1906, at the age of eighteen, Krishnamacharya left Mysore to attend university at Banaras, also known as Vārānasī, a city of hundreds of temples and a highly regarded North Indian center of traditional learning. While at university, he studied logic and Sanskrit, working with Brahmashri Shivakumar Shastry, &quot;one of the greatest grammarians of the age&quot;. He stated that he learned the Mimamsa from Brahmasri Trilinga Rama Shastri.

In 1914, he once again left for Banaras to attend classes at Queens College, where he claimed that he earned a number of teaching certificates. During the first year he had little or no financial support from his family. In order to eat, he followed the rules that were laid down for religious beggars: he was to approach only seven households each day and offer a prayer &quot;in return for wheat flour to mix with water for cakes&quot;. Krishnamacharya eventually left Queens College to study the &quot;ṣaḍdarśana&quot; (six darshanas) in Vedic philosophy at Patna University, in Bihar, a state in eastern India. He received a scholarship to study Ayurveda under Vaidya Krishnakumar of Bengal.

Krishnamacharya claimed that he was invited to the coronation of the Rajah of Dikkanghat (a principality within Darbhanga), at which he defeated a scholar called Bihari Lal in a debate, and received rewards and honors from the Rajah. He stated that his stay in Banaras lasted 11 years. He further claimed that he studied with the yoga master Sri Babu Bhagavan Das and passed the Samkhya Yoga Examination of Patna, and that many of his instructors recognized his outstanding abilities in yoga, some asking that he teach their children.

===The tale of Ramamohana Brahmachari and the &quot;Yoga Korunta&quot;===

Krishnamacharya told his pupils, including Iyengar, &quot;an imagined history, it turns out, of thousands of asanas&quot;. Mark Singleton and Tara Fraser note that he provided contradictory descriptions of the facts of his own life, sometimes denying tales he had told earlier, and sometimes mischievously adding new versions. According to one such tale, recounted by Mohan, during the vacations, which would last about three months, Krishnamacharya made pilgrimages into the Himalayas. Krishnamacharya claimed in his &quot;Yoga Makaranda&quot; that at the suggestion of Gaṅgānāth Jhā, he sought to further his yoga studies by seeking a master named Yogeshwara Ramamohana Brahmachari, who was rumored to live in the mountains beyond Nepal and had supposedly mastered 7000 asanas. For this venture, Krishnamacharya had to obtain the permission of the Viceroy in Simla, Lord Irwin, who was then suffering from diabetes. At the request of the Viceroy, Krishnamacharya travelled to Simla and taught him yogic practices for six months. The viceroy&#x27;s health improved and he developed respect and affection for Krishnamacharya. In 1919, the Viceroy made arrangements for Krishnamacharya&#x27;s travel to Tibet, supplying three aides and taking care of the expenses. After two and a half months of walking, Krishnamacharya arrived at Sri Brahmachari&#x27;s school, supposedly a cave at the foot of Mount Kailash, where the master lived with his wife and three children. Under Brahmachari&#x27;s tutelage, Krishnamacharya claimed to have spent seven and a half years studying the &quot;Yoga Sūtras&quot; of Patañjali, learning asanas and pranayama, and studying the therapeutic aspects of yoga. He was supposedly made to memorize the whole of the &quot;Yoga Korunta&quot; in the Gurkha language, though no evidence of that text exists. As tradition holds, at the end of his studies with the guru, Krishnamacharya asked what his payment would be. The master responded that Krishnamacharya was to &quot;take a wife, raise children and be a teacher of Yoga&quot;.

According to the tale, Krishnamacharya then returned to Varanasi. The Maharajah of Jaipur called him to serve as principal of the Vidyā Śālā in Jaipur; but as he did not like being answerable to many people, Krishnamacharya shortly returned to Varanasi. In accordance with his guru&#x27;s wish that he live the life of a householder, Krishnamacharya married Namagiriamma in 1925. After his marriage, Krishnamacharya was forced by circumstance to work in a coffee plantation in the Hasan district. It was after a lecture on the Upanishads in Mysore town hall in 1931 that he attracted the attention as a learned scholar that eventually led to his employment at the palace.

=== Mysore years ===


In 1926, the Maharaja of Mysore, Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV (1884–1940) was in Varanasi to celebrate his mother&#x27;s 60th birthday and heard about Krishnamacharya&#x27;s learning and skill as a yoga therapist. The Maharaja met Krishnamacharya and was so impressed by the young man&#x27;s demeanor, authority, and scholarship that he engaged Krishnamacharya to teach him and his family. Initially, Krishnamacharya taught yoga at the Mysore Palace. He soon became a trusted advisor of the Maharajah, and was given the recognition of Asthana Vidwan — the intelligentsia of the palace.

During the 1920s, Krishnamacharya held many demonstrations to stimulate popular interest in yoga. These included suspending his pulse, stopping cars with his bare hands, performing difficult asanas, and lifting heavy objects with his teeth. The Palace archive records show that the Maharaja was interested in the promotion of yoga and continually sent Krishnamacharya around the country to give lectures and demonstrations.

In 1931, Krishnamacharya was invited to teach at the Sanskrit College in Mysore. The Maharaja, who felt that yoga had helped cure his many ailments, asked Krishnamacharya to open a yoga school under his patronage and was subsequently given the wing of a nearby palace, the Jaganmohan Palace, to start the Yogashala, an independent yoga institution, which opened on 11 August 1933.

In 1934, he wrote the book &quot;Yoga Makaranda&quot; (&quot;Essence of Yoga&quot;), which was published by Mysore University. In the introduction to &quot;Yoga Makaranda&quot;, Krishnamacharya lists the &quot;Sritattvanidhi&quot;, a 19th-century treatise containing a yoga section by Maharaja of Mysore, Krishnaraja Wodeyar III (1794–1868) as one of the sources for his book. In &quot;The Yoga Tradition of the Mysore Palace&quot;, Norman Sjoman asserts that Krishnamacharya was influenced by the &quot;Sritattvanidhi&quot; and by the &quot;Vyayama Dipika&quot;, a Western-based gymnastics manual written by the Mysore Palace gymnasts. Mark Singleton argues that he was influenced by the 20th century yoga pioneers Yogendra and Kuvalayananda, and that all three &quot;seamlessly incorporate[d] elements of physical culture into their systems of &#x27;yoga&#x27;.&quot;

Krishnamacharya, unlike earlier yoga gurus such as Yogendra, &quot;severely criticized his students&quot; including his young brother-in-law, B. K. S. Iyengar. He was equally bad-tempered at home with his family. In the view of the historian of yoga Elliott Goldberg, Iyengar &quot;would never recover from or anywhere near comprehend the damage inflicted on him by Krishnamacharya&#x27;s abuse&quot; during his teenage years.

In 1940, Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV died. His nephew and successor, Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar (1919–1974), less interested in yoga, no longer provided support for publishing texts and sending teams of teachers to surrounding areas. Following political changes in 1946, around the time that India gained independence, a new government came into being and the powers of the maharajas were curtailed. Funding for the yoga school was cut off, and Krishnamacharya struggled to maintain the school. At the age of 60 (1948), Krishnamacharya was forced to travel extensively to find students and provide for his family. The yogashala in Mysore was ordered to be closed by K.C. Reddy, the first Chief Minister of Mysore State, and the school eventually closed in 1950.

=== Madras years ===

After leaving Mysore, Krishnamacharya moved to Bangalore for a couple of years and then was invited in 1952 to relocate to Madras (now Chennai), by a well-known lawyer who sought Krishnamacharya&#x27;s help in healing from a stroke. By now, Krishnamacharya was in his sixties, and his reputation for being a strict and intimidating teacher had mellowed somewhat. In Madras, Krishnamacharya accepted a job as a lecturer at Vivekananda College. He also began to acquire yoga students from diverse backgrounds and in various physical conditions, which required him to adapt his teaching to each student&#x27;s abilities. For the remainder of his teaching life, Krishnamacharya continued to refine this individualized approach, which came to be known as Viniyoga. Many considered Krishnamacharya a yoga master, but he continued to call himself a student because he felt that he was always &quot;studying, exploring and experimenting&quot; with the practice. Throughout his life, Krishnamacharya refused to take credit for his innovative teachings but instead attributed the knowledge to his guru or to ancient texts. Although his knowledge and teaching has influenced yoga throughout the world, Krishnamacharya never left his native India. &quot;Yoga Journal&quot; wrote:

By developing and refining different approaches, Krishnamacharya made yoga accessible to millions around the world.

== Approach ==
Krishnamacharya was a physician of Ayurvedic medicine. He &quot;possessed enormous knowledge of nutrition, herbal medicine, the use of oils, and other remedies&quot;. Krishnamacharya&#x27;s custom as an Ayurvedic practitioner was to begin with a detailed examination to determine the most efficient path to take for a patient. According to Krishnamacharya, even though the source or focus of a disease is in a particular area of the body, he assumed that many other systems in the body, both mental and physical, would also be affected. At some point during or after an initial examination, Krishnamacharya would ask if the patient was willing to follow his guidance. This question was important to a patient&#x27;s treatment, because Krishnamacharya felt that if the person could not trust him fully there was little chance of his or her being healed.

Once a person began seeing Krishnamacharya, he would work with him or her on a number of levels including adjusting their diet; creating herbal medicines; and setting up a series of yoga postures that would be most beneficial. When instructing a person on the practice of yoga, Krishnamacharya particularly stressed the importance of combining breath work (pranayama) with the postures (asanas) of yoga and meditation (dhyana) to reach the desired goal.

Krishnamacharya &quot;believed Yoga to be India&#x27;s greatest gift to the world.&quot; His yoga instruction reflected his conviction that yoga could be both a spiritual practice and a mode of physical healing. His style of yoga is now known as Vinyasa Krama Yoga. Krishnamacharya based his teachings on the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; of Patanjali and the &quot;Yoga Yajnavalkya&quot;. Whereas Krishnamacharya was deeply devoted to Vaishnavism, he also respected his students&#x27; varying religious beliefs, or nonbeliefs. A former student recalls that while leading a meditation, Krishnamacharya instructed students to close their eyes and &quot;think of God. If not God, the sun. If not the sun, your parents.&quot; As a result of the teachings he received from his father and other instructors, Krishnamacharya approached every student as &quot;absolutely unique&quot;, in the belief that the most important aspect of teaching yoga was that the student be &quot;taught according to his or her individual capacity at any given time&quot;. For Krishnamacharya, the path of yoga meant different things for different people, and each person ought to be taught in a manner that he or she understood clearly.

Krishnamacharya&#x27;s students included many of 20th century yoga&#x27;s most renowned and influential teachers: Indra Devi; K. Pattabhi Jois; B. K. S. Iyengar; T. K. V. Desikachar; Srivatsa Ramaswami; and A. G. Mohan (born 1945).

== Accomplishment as a scholar ==

Krishnamacharya was highly regarded as a scholar. He earned degrees in philosophy, logic, divinity, philology, and music. He was twice offered the position of Acharya in the Srivaishnava sampradaya, but he declined in order to stay with his family, in accordance with his guru&#x27;s wishes.

He also had extensive knowledge of orthodox Hindu rituals. His scholarship in various darshanas of orthodox Indian philosophy earned him titles such as &quot;Sāṃkhya-yoga-śikhāmaṇi&quot;, &quot;Mīmāṃsā-ratna&quot;, &quot;Mīmāṃsā-thīrtha&quot;, &quot;Nyāyācārya&quot;, &quot;Vedāntavāgīśa&quot;, &quot;Veda-kesari&quot; and &quot;Yogācārya&quot;.

One of Krishnamacharya&#x27;s most distinctive teachings was about kuṇḍalinī. To him, kuṇḍalinī is not an energy that rises. Rather, it is a blockage that prevents prāṇa (breath) from rising.

<doc id="1041824" wikidata="Q14132" url="?curid=1041824" title="North Korea national football team">
<text>The North Korea national football team (Munhwaeo ; North Korean romanisation: Josŏn minjujuŭi inmin konghwaguk kukka chonghap thim; recognized as Korea DPR by FIFA) represents North Korea in men&#x27;s international football and it is controlled by the DPR Korea Football Association, the governing body for Football in North Korea. The team represents both FIFA and Asian Football Confederation (AFC).

In their 1966 FIFA World Cup debut, North Korea reached the quarter-finals and beat Italy in the group stage, becoming the first men&#x27;s Asian team in history to make it past the group stage. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, controversy arose when the team&#x27;s supporters rioted, interfering with the opponents&#x27; safe egress from the stadium, because of North Korea&#x27;s failure to qualify. In 2009, the team qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the second World Cup appearance in their history. North Korea has qualified for the AFC Asian Cup six times; in 1980, when they finished fourth, in 1992, 2011, in 2015, and in 2019. The current team is composed of both native North Koreans and Zainichi Koreans.

==History ==

===North Korea&#x27;s debut and the 1966 FIFA World Cup ===
The North Korea Football Association was founded in 1945. It became a member of the AFC during the confederation&#x27;s first year of existence in 1954, and has been affiliated with FIFA since 1958. The first official match of the North Korean national football team was played on 22 March 1964, in Rangoon, against Burma, as part of the 1964 Olympic qualifiers. This first match in the history of the North Korean selection ended in a goalless draw. Thanks to their victory over the Burmese in the second leg, the &quot;Chollimas&quot; reached the next round against Thailand, a two-legged affair also hosted in Rangoon. They won easily (7–0 over the two matches), but were forced to forfeit the final phase of the tournament because the IOC decided to ban any athlete who participated in the GANEFO—which several footballers from the national team did.

In 1965, the national team took part again in GANEFO, and in 1966 FIFA World Cup qualification for the first time. That year, FIFA decided to place all the selections entered from Africa, Asia and Oceania in a single qualifying group, with the aim of offering only one place. All registered African countries protested by withdrawing from the competition, leaving only North Korea and Australia. The Australians started as favourites, but the North Koreans won both matches (6–1 and 3–1) and qualified for the final phase. The qualification of North Korea posed a diplomatic problem for the organizing country, the United Kingdom; since the Korean War, they had not recognized the legitimacy of the Pyongyang government and would not fly its flag or play its national anthem. The problem was only partly solved before the start of the competition in July 1966; the North Korean flag was flown alongside those of the other participants, but the national anthem was not played before the team&#x27;s matches.

In the 1966 FIFA World Cup, they were drawn into group 4, along with the USSR, Italy and Chile, the first time North Korea would face teams from another continent. The &quot;Chollimas&quot; lost their first game against the Soviets, then managed a 1–1 draw against Chile (Pak Seung-zin scoring North Korea&#x27;s first goal at a World Cup). The last match, against the Italian double world champions, was crucial, as the winner would obtain their ticket to the quarter-finals. The discipline of Myung Rye-hyun&#x27;s men managed to secure them a historic 1–0 upset victory with a goal from Pak Doo-ik. This was the first time an Asian team qualified for the quarter-finals of a World Cup. At the same time, the public began to take an interest in these disciplined players from a closed country. They were cheered on by locals in the town of Middlesbrough, where they were housed, including the team&#x27;s star players, Pak Seung-zin and Pak Doo-ik. In the quarter-finals, North Korea faced Portugal, which had eliminated reigning world champions Brazil in the group stage. After 25 minutes of play, the Koreans led 3–0 (goals from Pak Seung-zin, Yang Seung-kook and Li Dong-woon) but began to lose their discipline. Portuguese star player Eusébio went on to score four goals, and José Augusto added another to defeat North Korea 5–3. When the North Korean players returned home, the crowd cheered them on as heroes. Pak Seung-zin remains North Korea&#x27;s top scorer in the FIFA World Cup with two goals in four games.

Thirty-five years later, British director Dan Gordon, made a film called &quot;The Game of Their Lives&quot; after finding the seven surviving players of the 1966 side, who had become favourites with the British public and were celebrated as heroes on their return to their country. The film screened in North Korea and South Korea and received the award for Best Sports Documentary from the Royal Television Society.

===After the FIFA World Cup (1967–1980) ===

Following the FIFA World Cup, North Korea only rarely took part in the qualifying campaigns for the various continental and world tournaments. The &quot;Chollimas&quot; forfeited the 1968 Olympic qualifiers, and failed to enter the 1968 AFC Asian Cup qualification and 1970 FIFA World Cup qualifiers when they refused to face the Israeli team in the second round of the playoffs. Between their World Cup quarter-final and 1971, they played only one friendly against Algeria, losing 3–1 in Algiers. This meeting was the first in the history of the North Korean team against an African side.

The North Koreans played their first official game since 1966 in 1972, as part of the 1972 Olympic qualifiers. They defeated Syria and Iraq, but ended up losing against Iran 2–0 in a play-off match, following 0–0 draws in both of the first two legs. They decided again not to register for the 1972 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers. In May 1973, Pak Seung-zin&#x27;s men were in Tehran to play the first phase of the 1974 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. They were in Group 2, along with host nation Iran, Syria and Kuwait. The team finished third in the group, behind the Iranians, who qualified for the rest of the competition, and Syria.

North Korea took part in Asian Cup qualification for the first time in 1976. Placed in group 4-B, with Japan and Singapore, the &quot;Chollimas&quot; finished first, then beat Hong Kong in the semi-finals, ensuring their participation in the tournament proper, then beating China in the final match. But, like Saudi Arabia and Thailand, the North Koreans withdrew and missed the opportunity to take part in the continental tournament for the first time.

The following year, under the direction of former striker Pak Doo-ik, the team qualified for the Olympic football tournament for the second time. They finished first during qualification and advanced following a penalty shootout against Indonesia. In Montreal, they were placed in Group 3 with hosts Canada and the USSR. The North Koreans beat Canada 3–1, then lost to the Soviets 0–3, but still qualified for the quarter-finals in second. They failed again at this stage, suffering a heavy 5-0 defeat against future silver medalist team Poland. They played the last half hour with ten men against the Poles, led by Grzegorz Lato and Andrzej Szarmach, who each scored twice.

The following two qualifying campaigns, for the 1978 FIFA World Cup and for the 1980 Olympics, were failures. The former was cut short with a withdrawal for diplomatic reasons, the North Koreans finding themselves in the same qualifying group as their southern neighbors, and in 1980, the &quot;Chollimas&quot; finished in 4th place in Group 3 of the pre-tournament, overtaken by Iran, Singapore and China.

In 1980, this time with Yang Seung-kook on the bench, the North Koreans took part in 1980 AFC Asian Cup qualification which saw successes against Thailand and Malaysia. They finished in second place in Group 1 of the 1980 AFC Asian Cup, behind defending champions Iran. In the semi-finals, they faced South Korea in an event of both sporting and political significance. After opening the scoring early, North Korea conceded two goals by Chung Hae-won in the last ten minutes and saw their journey come to an end in the semi-final, their best performance in the Asian Cup of Nations. The game for third place was a disaster, with a 3–0 defeat against Iran.

===From one Asian Cup to another (1981–1992) ===

In 1980, with former international Han Bong-zin on the bench, the North Koreans moved on to 1982 FIFA World Cup qualification. After finishing top of their group (ahead of Hong Kong and Singapore), they eliminated Japan in the semi-finals but lost to China in the group final, ending any hopes of qualification. The following year, the selection participated in the 1982 Asian Games. North Korean progressed through the first round (drawing against Syria and Saudi Arabia and victory against Thailand), then beat Japan in the quarter-finals. They lost in extra time in the semi-finals, against Kuwait. The end of the match was extremely turbulent as the North Korean players attacked Thai referee Vijit Getkaew. The penalties from the AFC were heavy with a two-year suspension, which began as soon as the match ended, therefore they did not even play the match for the bronze medal, which automatically went to Saudi Arabia, the other unfortunate semi-finalists. The immediate consequence of this decision by the AFC, was the disqualification of North Korea from the 1984 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers and from the 1984 Olympic qualifiers which were boycotted by North Korea.

The selection therefore spent almost four years without playing official matches. For the 1986 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, they entered Group 4 alongside Japan and Singapore, two nations they had beaten four years previously. This time, it was the Japanese, led by Hiromi Hara, who finished top of the group and continued their qualifying campaign.

In 1988, North Korea did not participate in the 1988 Olympic tournament. North Korea had initially asked to be involved in the Games, a request refused by the International Olympic Committee, resulting in their boycott of the Games. As for the 1988 AFC Asian Cup qualification, North Korea only placed third in their qualifying group, behind Syria and Iran, both of which qualified for the tournament.

In 1990, North Korea took part in the inaugural 1990 Dynasty Cup. North Korea finished in third place. The following year, in the 1990 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, North Korea finished top of their first-round pool, winning all three of their home matches. In the final round, North Korea finished last, winning only one game, against Qatar.

Two years later, in 1991, the federation hired a foreign manager for the first time: Hungarian Pál Csernai, the former coach of Bayern Munich. North Korea finished the 1992 AFC Asian Cup qualification in first, ahead of Macao, Hong Kong and Chinese Taipei. It thus qualified for the Asian Cup for the second time, twelve years after its successful debut in Kuwait. Csernai&#x27;s team were drawn into Group 1, along with hosts Japan, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. This time, their tournament ended in the first round, finishing without a win and with only two goals scored, both by Kim Kwang-min.

North Korea entered 1992 Olympic qualifiers after two consecutive withdrawals. Placed in Group E, Pyongyang was chosen, along with Beijing, to host the qualifying matches. Once again, the final tournament escaped them, finishing in second place behind China. Right after the Games, the team took part in the 1992 Dynasty Cup. Like two years before, the team finished on the third step of the podium, behind Japan and South Korea.

===Withdrawal period (1993–2005) ===

Invigorated by their participation in the final phase of the 1992 AFC Asian Cup, Csernai&#x27;s men turned to qualification for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. Placed into Group C, North Korea finished undefeated, ahead of Qatar, Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam. The next round took the form of a single pool bringing together the six winners of the first round, the matches again held in Doha. Unfortunately for the North Koreans, after an inaugural victory against Iraq (3–2), they suffered four defeats in a row. Csernai left his post after the last meeting and left for Europe without returning to Pyongyang, and the federation put the national team on hold for more than four years. During this period, which saw North Korea tumble in the FIFA rankings, they choose not to register for any competition. This period of withdrawal coincided with the North Korean famine (1994–1998), which caused hundreds of thousands of deaths, as well as the official three-year mourning following the death of President Kim Il Sung in 1994 and the accession to power of his son Kim Jong Il.

North Korea made their return to official games in 2000 AFC Asian Cup qualification. Placed into Group 8 along with Thailand, Malaysia and Chinese Taipei, Myong Dong-chan&#x27;s men only lost to the Thais, and booked their ticket for the final tournament. They continued with the 2000 Olympic qualification but they finished second in their group, failing to advance. Following this, the federation again decided to sideline the team, withdrawing it from the qualifiers for the 2002 FIFA World Cup and for the 2003 EAFC.

In 2003, it was with Yun Jong-su on the bench that the North Koreans started the 2004 AFC Asian Cup qualification. After a preliminary round where they defeated the Indian team, the &quot;Chollimas&quot; finished last in the second round. These playoffs were marked by two incidents: first, during the game against Iran, where the North Koreans left the field as a result of smoke bombs which landed on the field; second, when North Korea refused to issue the Jordanian players visas, leading to the AFC granting Jordan a 3–0 victory and suspending North Korea from all competition in Asia for a year, including the 2007 AFC Asian Cup.

In 2005, the North Koreans returned to the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, twelve years after their last campaign. Placed in Group 5 in the second round, they finished top. In the next round, they saw their journey come to an end, finishing last behind Japan, Iran, and Bahrain. A few months later, North Korea returned to the 2005 East Asian Football Championship, thirteen years after their last participation. In the qualifying round, the North Koreans broke their record for biggest victory with a 21–0 victory against Guam. As in the 1990 and 1992 editions, the &quot;Chollimas&quot; finished on the podium, in third place, behind China and Japan, whom they beat 1–0 in the first match of the final round.

===First title and return to the FIFA World Cup (2006–2010) ===
The sanction imposed by the AFC on North Korea deprived it of participation in the qualifications for the 2007 AFC Asian Cup. With coach Kim Jong-hun at its head, the selection entered the 2008 AFC Challenge Cup, a competition reserved for so-called developing nations by the AFC and whose winner obtained direct qualification for the 2011 AFC Asian Cup. The North Korean selection had a good run which ended on the third step of the podium, after a defeat in the semi-finals against Tajikistan then a big success (4–0) in the third-placed match against Myanmar.

In the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, the &quot;Chollimas&quot; easily dismissed Mongolia (4–1 and 5–1) then finished second behind South Korea, without any defeats or even conceding a goal in the third round. North Korea again finished second behind South Korea in the fourth round, thus qualifying for the World Cup for only the second time. During these qualifiers there were diplomatic incidents with South Korea after Kim Jong Il refused to have the South Korean national anthem played, or even to fly the flag in the country, the two meetings against the &quot;Taeguk Warriors&quot; had to be relocated to China. At the end of the year, the North Koreans managed to qualify for the 2008 East Asian Football Championship, after beating Hong Kong. During this four-man final phase played in Chongqing, China, they finished last, with two draws (against Japan and South Korea, who won the tournament, and a defeat against China).

To prepare for the World Cup and get used to the European style of play, the North Korean selection organized a preparation camp in the fall of 2009 in France. On this occasion, they played two friendly matches: against FC Nantes on 9 October at La Roche-sur-Yon (0-0) then against Congo on 13 October at Le Mans (0-0).

In early 2010, a few months before the World Cup, North Korea participated in the 2010 AFC Challenge Cup with the winner automatically qualifying for the final phase of the 2011 AFC Asian Cup. The &quot;Chollimas&quot;, still led by Kim Jong-hun, had an excellent run in the competition. After finishing top of their first round group, ahead of Turkmenistan, they swept Myanmar 5–0 in the semi-finals before winning, after the penalty shootout, again facing the Turkmens in the final. This success allowed them to secure a place in the continental finals, ten years after their last participation. It was also the first title obtained by the men&#x27;s national team. The following month, in February, the North Koreans engaged in the 2010 East Asian Football Championship where they entered in the second round. For the first time, they did not reach the final pool, beaten on goal difference by Hong Kong.

With a final pre-tournament ranking of 105th, North Korea were the lowest-ranked team at the 2010 FIFA World Cup. They were drawn in Group G alongside Brazil, Portugal, and Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, in what some commentators referred to as a &quot;Group of death&quot;. After a 2-1 defeat against Brazil, North Korea were eliminated after losing 7-0 to Portugal, the heaviest defeat in the team&#x27;s history. After trailing 1–0 at halftime, they conceded six goals in the second half. The match was shown live in North Korea - an exceptionally rare occurrence for a foreign broadcast - but the broadcast was interrupted after Portugal&#x27;s fourth goal. North Korea went on to lose their final match against Côte d&#x27;Ivoire 3-0 to record the worst performance of any team at that year&#x27;s World Cup.

After the FIFA World Cup, Radio Free Asia reported based on anonymous reports that coach Kim Jong-hun had been punished by being sent to forced labor camps, while some players had been subjected to &quot;harsh ideological criticism&quot;.

===Successes and difficult times (2011–2022) ===

Six months after the FIFA World Cup, North Korea entered the 2011 AFC Asian Cup. The team managed to draw 0–0 against the United Arab Emirates and two 1–0 defeats against Iran and Iraq. In the fall, the North Koreans entered the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, with the hope of participating in a second consecutive tournament. They did not enter the competition until the third round, finding themselves in the same group as Japan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan (which benefited from the disqualification of Syria). The &quot;Chollimas&quot; finished in 3rd place of the group. The round featured the first meeting of the Japanese team and their North Korean counterparts in Pyongyang in 22 years. 150 Japanese supporters were allowed to be present but they received four-hour checks upon their arrival at Pyongyang International Airport, an &quot;icy&quot; reception at Kim Il Sung Stadium, where they were warned not to wave Japanese flags, and had their national anthem booed by the North Korean crowd.

In March 2012, the North Koreans defended the 2012 AFC Challenge Cup with the possibility again to qualify for the 2015 AFC Asian Cup. The &quot;Chollimas&quot; advance to the finals after finishing top of their qualifying group, along with Nepal. In the semi-finals, they beat Palestine and then managed to retain their title, following their success in the final against Turkmenistan. This victory assured them of a second consecutive participation in the AFC Asian Cup, which was a first.

The team enjoyed a two-year unbeaten run, after the home defeat against Uzbekistan in the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.The &quot;Chollimas&quot; played in the second round of the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup but failed to advance on goal difference, coming second to Australia. In November 2013, the unbeaten streak ended with a loss to Kuwait (2–1). They managed to finish first in the 2015 EAFF East Asian Cup qualifying pool, getting their ticket to the finals for the first time since 2008.

A few weeks before the start of the 2015 AFC Asian Cup, the North Korean federation relieved Yun Jong-su of his duties, following his suspension of one year decided by the AFC. Jong-su was penalized for his unsportsmanlike behaviour towards the referees during the Asian Games soccer tournament final against South Korea. North Korea left the competition at the end of the group stage, after losing their three matches. Following this competition, the team restored its image by winning several friendly matches before finishing on the podium of the 2015 EAFF East Asian Cup, including a prestigious victory over Japan (2–1).

In the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, North Korea got off to a flying start by winning their first three games, but failed to qualify for the 3rd round, following a defeat to the Philippines at the very end of the match (2–3, having led 2–1 until the 85th minute) during the final match. North Korea finished in second place in their group with 16 points, but this defeat prevented the &quot;Chollima&quot; from finishing among the four best runners-up and advancing to the next round. This led to the dismissal of Kim Chang-bok, replaced by Jørn Andersen, the second European coach to manage North Korea after the Hungarian Pál Csernai. The early elimination in World Cup qualifying meant that North Korea had to enter the 3rd qualifying round for the 2019 AFC Asian Cup. This qualifying campaign gave rise to a triple postponement by the AFC of the home match against Malaysia, at the request of the Malaysian Federation, fearing the poisoning of its players if they went to North Korea following diplomatic tensions between the two countries - linked to the assassination of Kim Jong-nam, the North Korean leader&#x27;s half-brother, at Kuala Lumpur airport on 13 February 2017. The meetings between the two teams were finally held on neutral ground in Thailand, where North Korea needed two victories to give them a chance to qualify, dominating Malaysia (4–1 and 4–1). At the 2017 EAFF E-1 Football Championship, the &quot;Chollima&quot; failed to win a single match and finished 4th and last in the final round, with two opening losses against Japan and South Korea (0–1 each time) before ending the competition in a draw (1–1) against China.

In the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, North Korea were swept away by Saudi Arabia (0–4), Qatar (6–0, suffering the second heaviest defeat in its history) and against Lebanon (1–4), leaving the competition with the worst record of the 24 teams involved (three defeats in as many games played, only one goal scored, 14 conceded, and two red cards received). North Korea then participated in the 2nd round of the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers and beat Lebanon (2–0) thanks to a double from Jong Il-gwan. North Korea managed to follow up with a narrow victory in Sri Lanka five days later (1–0) with a goal by Jang Kuk-chol before facing South Korea. For the first time since a friendly match in 1990 and for the first time in a qualifier, the meeting between the two Koreas took place in Pyongyang, however the match was not televised live and no Korean supporters or foreign journalists were allowed to attend the match, which ended in a scoreless draw (0–0), leaving the two teams at the top of Pool H tied. Following the match against their rivals, they lost for the first time in their history against Turkmenistan (1–3) but managed to beat Lebanon 2–0. Five days later, they played Lebanon again, drawing 0–0, preserving their chances of qualifying for the next round. However, North Korea withdrew from qualifying due to fears related to the COVID-19 pandemic. FIFA and the AFC announced that all results of matches played by North Korea since the start of the 2nd qualifying round and 2023 AFC Asian Cup were void and would not count towards qualification, thus North Korea would not play in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup, their first miss out from the event since 2007.

=== Return after a long hiatus (2023–present) ===
In August 2023, North Korea announced interests in returning to sporting competitions, including football, and has signalled interests to return to the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification, where North Korea found themselves in Group B of the second round against Japan, Syria and Myanmar. The country&#x27;s move was confirmed by FIFA and the AFC as North Korea sought to enhance its football reputation, already damaged due to the isolation related to the pandemic. After more than 5 years of inactive international football, On 16 November 2023, North Korea played against Syria losing 1–0 to them. On 21 November, North Korea thrashed Myanmar 6–1 at the Thuwunna Stadium with Jong Il-gwan scoring a hat-trick in the match.

On 11 June 2024, North Korea advanced to the final round of the FIFA World Cup qualification for the first time since 2010, and qualified to the AFC Asian Cup for the 2027 edition, after missing out in 2023.

==Team image==
Between 2014 and January 2024, the official kit provider for the North Korean national teams was the North Korean sports company Choeusu. In January 2024, Chinese sports brand Inlang became the official kit sponsor.
=== Stadium ===
North Korea plays their home matches at the Rungrado 1st of May Stadium on Rungra Island, Pyongyang. It is the second largest stadium in the world with a capacity of 114,000. However, North Korea mostly used the Kim Il Sung Stadium in Pyongyang as their main stadium. Since 2019, North Korea had since used to host their home matches as a neutral ground all over Asia.

<doc id="1041829" wikidata="Q1649661" url="?curid=1041829" title="Ibitinga">
<text>Ibitinga is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. The population is 60,600 (2020 est.) in an area of 689 km2 (266 mi2). The elevation is 491 m (1,611 ft). The name comes from the Tupi language, meaning &quot;White Lands&quot;. The main rivers near Ibitinga are the Tietê River and its tributaries Jacaré-Pepira River and Jacaré-Guaçu River.

The town is commonly referred to as the &quot;Embroidery National Capital&quot;, for its large embroidery industry, which started in the 1960s with immigrants from Madeira Island, and really developed after 1974, when the City Hall promoted the first &quot;Embroidery Fair&quot;, at the City Stadium. Year after year, the town has passed from being dependent on agriculture and cattle to its current situation, where the economy mostly depends on embroidery and tourism.

At the Tietê river in Ibitinga, it is also located a dam (the Ibitinga Hydroelectric Power Station) and one lock. This lock, together with many others at other Tietê dams, allows the navigation of Tietê river along most of its length.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia Telefônica Brasileira until 1973, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<doc id="1041832" wikidata="Q48622" url="?curid=1041832" title="Esha Deol">
<text>Esha Deol (born 2 November 1981) is an Indian actress who predominantly appears in Hindi films. The daughter of actors Dharmendra and Hema Malini, Deol made her acting debut in the romantic thriller &quot;Koi Mere Dil Se Poochhe&quot; (2002), which won her the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut. 

Following a series of poorly received films, Deol had success in the political film &quot;Aayutha Ezhuthu&quot; (2004), the action thrillers &quot;Dhoom&quot; (2004) and &quot;Dus&quot; (2005), the horror film &quot;Kaal&quot; (2005), and the comedy &quot;No Entry&quot; (2005). This was followed by a setback and a hiatus. Deol returned to acting with the streaming series &quot;&quot; (2022) and &quot;Hunter Tootega Nahi Todega&quot; (2023).

==Early life and family==
Esha Deol was born in Bombay (present Mumbai) on 2 November 1981. She is the elder daughter of Bollywood actors Dharmendra and Hema Malini. She has a younger sister named Ahana. She is the half sister of actors Sunny Deol and Bobby Deol and the first cousin of actor Abhay Deol. Her father is a Punjabi Jat, and her mother is a Tamil Hindu Iyengar Brahmin. She speaks Tamil with her mother and sister.

==Career==
===Debut and early work (2002–2003)===
She started her acting career in a lead role with Vinay Shukla&#x27;s &quot;Koi Mere Dil Se Poochhe&quot; (2002) opposite Aftab Shivdasani, with Sanjay Kapoor, Jaya Bachchan and Anupam Kher playing supporting roles. The movie was a box office failure. Deol received mixed reactions from critics upon her performance. Savera R Someshwar of &quot;Rediff.com&quot; wrote &quot;Esha, as a person, exudes a confidence that almost borders on arrogance.&quot; Rakesh Budhu of Planet Bollywood wrote &quot;She isn&#x27;t horrible, but given the hype, the demands and of course, comparisons, she surely isn&#x27;t up to the mark. … Of course, she is nowhere close to being a washout and if you are her fan you can appreciate the other aspects of her performances without completely losing faith in her future projects.&quot; Despite mixed reactions and box office failure, Deol won numerous awards for her performance including the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut at the 48th Filmfare Awards.

Deol&#x27;s second film was Arjun Sablok&#x27;s love triangle &quot;Na Tum Jaano Na Hum&quot; opposite Saif Ali Khan and Hrithik Roshan. Taran Adarsh of IndiaFm praised her acting and wrote &quot;it is Esha Deol who surprises you with a mature performance. Although her looks are inconsistent, the youngster takes on the role with utmost sincerity and comes out with a natural performance. She has been better presented when compared to her debut film.&quot; Bhavna Giani of Rediff praised Deol&#x27;s acting and dancing and compared it to Deol&#x27;s mother Hema Malini. Deol&#x27;s third and final release of the year was Sanjay Chhel&#x27;s &quot;Kyaa Dil Ne Kahaa&quot; opposite Tusshar Kapoor. It was Deol&#x27;s third consecutive flop but she earned critical acclaim and Taran Adarsh observed that it was her better performance as compared to her previous two films.

Deol&#x27;s first two movies of 2003: &quot;Kucch To Hai&quot; and &quot;Chura Liyaa Hai Tumne&quot; were box office failures. For &quot;Kucch To Hai&quot;, Deol earned mixed reviews from Taran Adarsh, who wrote &quot;Esha Deol shows improvement in terms of performance as well as her overall appearance.&quot; Taran Adarsh considered Deol to be &quot;alright&quot; in &quot;Chura Liyaa Hai Tumne&quot;.

Deol was one of the heroines of J.P. Dutta&#x27;s multi starrer war epic &quot;&quot; and was paired with Abhishek Bachchan. Though Deol and all the other heroines could not get much scope, she earned critical acclaim for her performance. The film became the sixth highest-grossing film of the year.

===Breakthrough (2004–2008)===
In 2004, Deol made her debut in Tamil cinema by playing a French teacher in Mani Ratnam&#x27;s political film &quot;Aayutha Ezhuthu&quot; opposite Suriya. She earned critical acclaim for her performance. Sify.com defined her as &quot;surprisingly fresh and sparkling&quot;. To prepare for her role, Deol learned nuances of the language with Mani Ratnam&#x27;s assistant R. Kannan. This was the only Tamil film she ever acted in. After completing &quot;Aaytha Ezhuthu&quot;, Deol started filming the Hindi version of the movie titled &quot;Yuva&quot;. In &quot;Yuva&quot;, Deol repeated the same role and was paired opposite Ajay Devgn. Both movies were released on the same date but could not attain success. &quot;Yuva&quot; had a below average opening and flopped at the box office.

Deol finally got her breakthrough with Yash Raj Films&#x27; action film &quot;Dhoom&quot; opposite Abhishek Bachchan, John Abraham, Uday Chopra and Rimi Sen. It was Deol&#x27;s first action role and she was paired opposite Chopra. The film had a decent opening and became a hit at the box office, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of the year. Deol did not get much scope in the film, but her performance earned her a nomination for the IIFA Award for Best Supporting Actress at the 6th IIFA Awards.

After the success of &quot;Dhoom&quot;, Deol starred in Krishna Vamsi&#x27;s war film &quot;Insan&quot; opposite Akshay Kumar. It was Deol&#x27;s first release of 2005. The film was a failure at the box office. Her next release was &quot;Main Aisa Hi Hoon&quot; opposite Ajay Devgn. The film was a remake of the Hollywood movie &quot;I Am Sam&quot; (2001). Deol played a supporting role and earned praise by Patcy N. Subhash K. Jha of &quot;IANS&quot; also praised Deol, writing: &quot;Esha Deol as the fey unstable nomadic and maladjusted Maya is a mix of Zeenat Aman in &quot;Hare Rama Hare Krishna&quot; and Anooradha Patel in &quot;Ijaazat&quot;. Playing this zonked-out character Esha Deol comes into her own as an actress. Her far-way looks of pain, anger, neglect and insecurity remain with you long after the film. Yup she too has matured along with Hindi cinema.&quot;

In 2007, Deol&#x27;s portrayal of a notorious and vengeful ghost for Ram Gopal Verma&#x27;s &quot;Darling&quot; was reviewed positively. Her next release was &quot;Cash&quot; again opposite Ajay Devgn. In 2008, she performed her first item number in Ajay Devgn film &quot;Sunday&quot;. She further appeared in &quot;Hijack&quot; and took a sabbatical break from films for 3 years.

===Hiatus and return to acting (2011–present)===
Deol&#x27;s next film was &quot;Tell Me O Kkhuda&quot; (2011) directed and produced by her mother Hema Malini. She portrayed the lead role in the film opposite Arjan Bajwa, Vinod Khanna, Rishi Kapoor and her father Dharmendra.

Deol released her short film &quot;Ek Duaa&quot; in which she acted and also produced alongside her husband. The film was released on Voot, and it was met with mixed to positive reviews.

Deol reunited with Ajay Devgan in the 2022 web series &quot;&quot; which marked her comeback. In 2023, She appeared alongside Suniel Shetty in the series &quot;Hunter Tootega Nahi Todega&quot;.

==Other work==

During her school days at Jamnabai Narsee School, she was passionate about football and played as a midfielder. She was the captain of her school football team, represented her college in handball at the state level. She played as a national level footballer and was also selected to play for Maharashtra in the Senior National Championship at Punjab in 2001.

Like their mother, Esha and her sister are trained in classical dance forms. Esha is a professional Odissi dancer and was also trained in Bharatanatyam.

In February 2020, Deol announced her first book &quot;Amma Mia!&quot; on Instagram. This book is a hands-on guide on parenting and children diet.

==Personal life==

On 29 June 2012, Esha Deol married Bharat Takhtani in a low-key wedding ceremony at the ISKCON temple in Mumbai.

In April 2017, it was announced that the couple was expecting their first child. She gave birth to her daughter in October 2017 at Hinduja Hospital in Mumbai and named her Radhya.

<doc id="1041833" wikidata="Q1795639" url="?curid=1041833" title="Ibiúna">
<text>Ibiúna is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of Sorocaba. The population is 79,479 (2020 est.) in an area of 1058.08 km2. The elevation is 860 m.

==Geography==

Located in the middle of a valley, its main economical activity/resources are provided from agriculture (developed by the hundreds of Japanese immigrants established there) and the city has been recently turned to a tourist city a few years ago. The whole Ibiuna territory encompasses rainforests, bushes, and hundreds of kilometers of native vegetation and wildlife.

The municipality contains part of the Serra do Mar Environmental Protection Area, created in 1984.
It also contains part of the Jurupará State Park, created in 1992.

==People==

The population is mostly situated outside the metropolitan area (15,000 inhabitants in the city and approximately 65,000 in the suburbs) and is a mix of Portuguese Colonialists descendants, Italians, Germans and Africans — as mostly any part of the country, Ibiuna is a mix of races and cultures. Once a year, the city held the famous &quot;São Sebastian festival&quot; party celebrated for nearly a century to reaffirm the faith of town&#x27;s divine intervention by St. Sebastian during a Spanish influenza epidemic (the celebration occurs every year during the last weekend of May).

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia de Telecomunicações do Estado de São Paulo until 1975, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<doc id="1041843" wikidata="Q8870613" url="?curid=1041843" title="Steve Mills (footballer)">
<text>Stephen John Mills (9 December 1953 – 1 August 1988) was an English professional footballer with Southampton who had his career cut short by a serious car accident, before dying from leukaemia aged 34.

==Early life==
Mills was born in Portsmouth, the grandson of Portsmouth&#x27;s 1934 FA Cup goalkeeper, Jock Gilfillan. He attended Gosport County Grammar School and represented Hampshire Schools. He came to The Dell on a week&#x27;s trial as a 15-year-old schoolboy and was promptly snapped up by manager Ted Bates, joining the Saints as a trainee in February 1969, signing as a professional in July 1971.

==Playing career==
He was extremely quick and a fierce tackler – a natural right-back. He made his debut on 3 October 1972 (aged 18) against Notts County in the Football League Cup. At the end of the 1972–73 season he made his league debut, and in the following season, became a regular full-back. A series of impressive appearances for Southampton earned him recognition for England at under-23 level.

He appeared to be on the verge of an illustrious career, when he was involved in a serious car accident in February 1975. He was on his way home from a night out with friends at Portsmouth Greyhound Stadium, when the car in which he was travelling hit a kerb and overturned. Whilst the other occupants of the car survived with minor injuries, Steve sustained a fractured pelvis and back injuries. At the time, doctors questioned whether he would ever walk again, but within 12 weeks he was out of hospital.

After a gruelling stint at an Army rehabilitation centre, he flew to the USA where he played football for Miami Toros to regain match fitness. He made his comeback match on the final day of the 1975–76 season, a week before the FA Cup final, replacing the suspended David Peach. Sadly, his fitness had been irrevocably damaged and he was forced to give up the game after 2 matches in the following season.

==Illness and death==
After finally retiring from playing, he moved back to Gosport, and took over his parents&#x27; newsagency, before, in 1986, discovering that he had leukaemia. He was diagnosed as suffering from a complicated mixture of myeloid and lymphoblastic leukaemia.

Mills vigorously fought the disease and became involved in charity work by establishing a fund for leukaemia research.

Despite being hospitalised by the side effects of his medical treatment, he organised the biggest charity match ever seen in the South of England with an all-time Saints XI playing the then current team at The Dell in May 1988, involving players such as Mick Channon, Alan Ball, Kevin Keegan and Martin Chivers playing in front of a capacity crowd of over 20,000. Mills received an emotional standing ovation when he appeared on the pitch.

He died on 1 August 1988, having battled against the illness for two years.

On 23 October 2021 his memory was honoured with the Forever Saint award, presented to his family at St Mary&#x27;s Stadium where Southampton were playing Burnley.

==The Steve Mills Stem Cell Laboratory==

The charity fund he established before he died raised more than £100,000 towards creating a stem cell laboratory, which was opened at Southampton&#x27;s Royal South Hants Hospital a year later. The charity continued to provide funds for research into leukaemia over the next 18 years, and in September 2006 the laboratory moved to a new location at Southampton General Hospital. The new unit was officially opened on 27 September 2006 by Steve&#x27;s widow Jo and former Southampton footballer and manager, Alan Ball.

* The Steve Mills Stem Cell Laboratory processes, stores and issues stem cell products for transplant.
* The processing of a patient&#x27;s stem cell products takes around 3 hours to complete.
* Stem cell donations are processed as soon as they arrive at the laboratory because stem cells have a shelf life of just 24 hours.
* The laboratory reacts quickly to hospital requests and processes up to 12 stem cell donations a week.
* The laboratory processes stem cells for Southampton University Hospitals Trust, Bournemouth Hospital, Poole Hospital, Salisbury District Hospital St. Georges Hospital and Dorset County Hospital.
* In addition to processing, storing and issuing stem cell products, the laboratory undertakes critical research and development of new cancer therapies and treatments.

<text>Telehouse is a major carrier-neutral colocation, information and communications technology services provider based in Docklands, London. Established in 1988, it operates eight facilities in London, Paris and Frankfurt. Part of the global Telehouse network of data centres, the brand has 45 colocation facilities in 26 major cities around the world including Moscow, Istanbul, Johannesburg, Cape Town, Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam, Seoul, Tokyo, New York and Los Angeles. KDDI, Telehouse&#x27;s Japanese telecommunications and systems integration parent company, operates data centre facilities in America and Asia.

==Operations==
===London===
Operational since 1990, Telehouse North became Europe&#x27;s first purpose-built neutral colocation facility. LINX traffic has been moving through the carrier-neutral Telehouse campus since its opening. Telehouse hosts the vast majority of internet peering traffic from LINX.

It is the main hub of the Internet in the United Kingdom. In response to growing demand for a Central London location, Telehouse opened an additional colocation facility in 1997, Telehouse Metro, in the London Borough of Islington near Silicon Roundabout, Telehouse Metro later closed in 2020.

A second building at the Docklands site, Telehouse East, was opened in 1999 and the construction of a third building, Telehouse West, at its Docklands site was completed in March 2010. In July 2014 KDDI announced that a fourth building North Two would be built on the site, adjacent to the existing Telehouse North building. In August 2016, Telehouse Europe opened $177 million North Two data center of 24,000 square meters, increasing its capacity at the Docklands site where it already had 73,000 square meters of space. According to Telehouse, North Two is the only UK data center to own a 132 kV on-campus grid substation that is directly connected to the National Grid, reducing transmission losses and improving power density and service continuity. North Two also utilizes the first multi-storey adiabatic cooling system in the world, delivering an industry-leading 1.16 PUE. The site has a capacity of up to 73 MVA in total.

Telehouse London is the primary home of the London Internet Exchange since 1994, while UK internet exchanges like LONAP are also present.

In 2012, Telehouse built their own primary substation, at 50MVA and two 132kVA power lines directly connected to the high voltage power network for the London Docklands site.

<text>The Army of the Cumberland was one of the principal Union armies in the Western Theater during the American Civil War. It was originally known as the Army of the Ohio.

==History==

The origin of the Army of the Cumberland dates back to the creation of the Army of the Ohio in November 1861, under the command of Brig. Gen. Robert Anderson. The army fought under the name Army of the Ohio until Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans assumed command of the army and the Department of the Cumberland and changed the name of the combined entity to the Army of the Cumberland. When Rosecrans assumed command, the army and the XIV Corps were the same unit, divided into three &quot;grand divisions&quot; (wings) commanded by Alexander McCook (right wing), George H. Thomas (Center), and Thomas L. Crittenden (Left).

General Order No. 168 was the order passed by the Union Army on October 24, 1862, that called for commissioning the XIV Corps into the Army of the Cumberland.

The army&#x27;s first significant combat under the Cumberland name was at the Battle of Stones River. After the battle the army and XIV Corps were separated. The former Center wing became XIV Corps, the Right wing became XX Corps, and the Left wing became XXI Corps. Rosecrans still retained command of the army. He next led it through the Tullahoma Campaign and at the Battle of Chickamauga, after which the army became besieged at Chattanooga. Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant arrived at Chattanooga. Reinforcements from the Army of the Potomac and the Army of the Tennessee also arrived. Rosecrans had been a popular and respected commander, but because of his defeat at Chickamauga and inability to lift the Confederate siege, Grant chose to replace him with George H. Thomas on October 19, 1863.
In the Battles for Chattanooga, Grant had been leery of using the Army of the Cumberland in the main fighting, fearing their morale to be too low after the defeat at Chickamauga. Instead, he used the veterans from the Army of the Potomac, proud of their recent victory at the Battle of Gettysburg, to take Lookout Mountain and planned to use the troops from the Army of the Tennessee, also recent victors at the Siege of Vicksburg, to attack the Confederate right flank on Missionary Ridge. The Army of the Cumberland was given the minor task of seizing the rifle pits at the base of Missionary Ridge. However, once they achieved their objective, four divisions (one led by Philip H. Sheridan) stormed up the ridge and routed the Confederate center. When Grant angrily asked who had ordered those troops up the ridge both Thomas and Gordon Granger, a corps commander in the army, responded they did not know. Granger then added, &quot;Once those boys get started, all hell can&#x27;t stop &#x27;em.&quot;

After Grant&#x27;s victory at Chattanooga earned him promotion to general-in-chief of the U.S. Army, Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman assumed command of Grant&#x27;s Military Division of the Mississippi, which controlled all Union armies in the West. He created an &quot;army group&quot; of the Army of the Cumberland, the Army of the Tennessee, and the Army of the Ohio and marched towards Atlanta in May 1864. On the way to Atlanta they fought in many battles and skirmishes including the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain. In September, Atlanta fell to Sherman&#x27;s army group. When Confederate general John B. Hood moved north from Atlanta, Sherman chose not to follow him and instead dispatched some of the Army of the Cumberland (IV Corps and Provisional Detachment) and the Army of the Ohio (XXIII Corps) after him. Thomas finally met Hood at the Battle of Nashville and crushed him, thus bringing to an end any significant military actions for the Army of the Cumberland. Other elements of the Army of the Cumberland (the XIV and XX Corps) marched to the sea and north through the Carolinas with Sherman, under the command of Maj. Gen. Henry W. Slocum. These forces became the Union&#x27;s Army of Georgia and participated in the Grand Review of the Armies in Washington, D.C., before President Andrew Johnson in 1865.

<doc id="1041856" wikidata="Q67101192" url="?curid=1041856" title="Porin (protein)">
<text>Porins are beta barrel proteins that cross a cellular membrane and act as a pore, through which molecules can diffuse. Unlike other membrane transport proteins, porins are large enough to allow passive diffusion, i.e., they act as channels that are specific to different types of molecules. They are present in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria and some gram-positive mycobacteria (mycolic acid-containing actinomycetes), the outer membrane of mitochondria, and the outer chloroplast membrane (outer plastid membrane).

== Structure ==
Porins are composed of beta sheets (β sheets) made up of beta strands (β strands) which are linked together by beta turns (β turns) on the cytoplasmic side and long loops of amino acids on the other. The β strands lie in an antiparallel fashion and form a cylindrical tube, called a beta barrel (β barrel). The amino acid composition of the porin β strands are unique in that polar and nonpolar residues alternate along them. This means that the nonpolar residues face outward so as to interact with the nonpolar lipids of outer membrane, whereas the polar residues face inwards into the center of the beta barrel to create the aqueous channel. The specific amino acids in the channel determine the specificity of the porin to different molecules.

The β barrels that make up a porin are composed of as few as eight β strands to as many as twenty-two β strands. The individual strands are joined together by loops and turns. The majority of porins are monomers; however, some dimeric porins have been discovered, as well as an octameric porin. Depending on the size of the porin, the interior of the protein may either be filled with water, have up to two β strands folded back into the interior, or contain a &quot;stopper&quot; segment composed of β strands.

All porins form homotrimers in the outer membrane, meaning that three identical porin subunits associate together to form a porin super-structure with three channels. Hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions between each monomer in the homotrimer ensure that they do not dissociate, and remain together in the outer membrane.

Several parameters have been used to describe the structure of a porin protein. They include the tilting angle (α), shear number (S), strand number (n), and barrel radius (R). The tilting angle refers to the angle relative to the membrane. The shear number (S) is the number of amino acid residues found in each β strands. Strand number (n) is the amount of β strands in the porin, and barrel radius (R) refers to the radius of the opening of the porin. These parameters are related via the following formulas:

:formula_1

and,

:formula_2

Using these formulas, the structure of a porin can be determined by knowing only a few of the available parameters. While the structure of many porins have been determined using X-ray crystallography, the alternative method of sequencing protein primary structure may also be used instead.

==Cellular roles==
Porins are water-filled pores and channels found in the membranes of bacteria and eukaryotes. Porin-like channels have also been discovered in archaea. Note that the term &quot;nucleoporin&quot; refers to unrelated proteins that facilitate transport through nuclear pores in the nuclear envelope.

Porins are primarily involved in passively transporting hydrophilic molecules of various sizes and charges across the membrane. For survival, certain required nutrients and substrates must be transported into the cells. Likewise, toxins and wastes must be transported out to avoid toxic accumulation. Additionally, porins can regulate permeability and prevent lysis by limiting the entry of detergents into the cell.

Two types of porins exist to transport different materials– general and selective. General porins have no substrate specificities, though some exhibit slight preferences for anions or cations. Selective porins are smaller than general porins, and have specificities for chemical species. These specificities are determined by the threshold sizes of the porins, and the amino acid residues lining them.

In gram-negative bacteria, the inner membrane is the major permeability barrier. The outer membrane is more permeable to hydrophilic substances, due to the presence of porins. Porins have threshold sizes of transportable molecules that depend on the type of bacteria and porin. Generally, only substances less than 600 daltons in size can diffuse through.

==Diversity==
Porins were first discovered in gram-negative bacteria, but gram-positive bacteria with both types of porins have been found. They exhibit similar transport functions but have a more limited variety of porins, compared to the distribution found in gram-negative bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria lack outer membranes, so these porin channels are instead bound to specific lipids within the cell walls.

Porins are also found in eukaryotes, specifically in the outer membranes of mitochondria and chloroplasts. The organelles contain general porins that are structurally and functionally similar to bacterial ones. These similarities have supported the Endosymbiotic theory, through which eukaryotic organelles arose from gram-negative bacteria. However, eukaryotic porins exhibit the same limited diversity as gram-positive porins, and also display a greater voltage-dependent role during metabolism.

Archaea also contain ion channels that have originated from general porins. The channels are found in the cell envelope and help facilitate solute transfer. They have similar characteristics as bacterial and mitochondrial porins, indicating physiological overlaps over all three domains of life.

==Antibiotic resistance==
Many porins are targets for host immune cells, resulting in signaling pathways that lead to bacterial degradation. Therapeutic treatments, like vaccinations and antibiotics, are used to supplement this immune response. Specific antibiotics have been designed to travel through porins in order to inhibit cellular processes.

However, due to selective pressure, bacteria can develop resistance through mutations in the porin gene. The mutations may lead to a loss of porins, resulting in the antibiotics having a lower permeability or being completely excluded from transport. These changes have contributed to the global emergence of antibiotic resistance, and an increase in mortality rates from infections.

==Discovery==
The discovery of porins has been attributed to Hiroshi Nikaido, nicknamed &quot;the porinologist.&quot;

==Classification==
According to TCDB, there are five evolutionarily independent superfamilies of porins. Porin superfamily I includes 47 families of porins with a range of numbers of trans-membrane β-strands (β-TMS). These include the GBP, SP and RPP porin families. While PSF I includes 47 families, PSF II-V each contain only 2 families. While PSF I derives members from gram-negative bacteria primarily one family of eukaryotic mitochondrial porins, PSF II and V porins are derived from Actinomycetota. PSF III and V are derived from eukaryotic organelle.

<text>The Kuwait national football team () represents Kuwait and is controlled by the Kuwait Football Association. Kuwait made its only FIFA World Cup appearance in 1982, managing to get one draw in the group stage against Czechoslovakia. In the AFC Asian Cup, Kuwait reached the final in 1976 and won the tournament four years later in 1980.

The Kuwait National Football Team was a competitive force in Asian football from the 1970s to the 2000s but experienced a decline in performance during the 2010s. Kuwait lost two consecutive AFC Asian Cup group-stage campaigns in 2011 and 2015 before being disqualified from the 2019 edition and missing out on the 2023 AFC Asian Cup Due to a very slow end to the season.

==History==
===Early successes===
Kuwait&#x27;s first international match was played in the 1961 Arab Games against Libya, which ended in a 2–2 draw. Their biggest losses were 8–0 defeats to both the United Arab Republic and Portugal. Kuwait hosted the 1974 Arabian Gulf Cup at Al Kuwait Sports Club Stadium, collecting their third consecutive title in the cup. They won the AFC Asian Cup in 1980. Kuwait&#x27;s national football team joined the World Cup in 1982, which was held in Spain. Kuwait was placed in the fourth group after losses to England and France and a draw with Czechoslovakia. Kuwait&#x27;s highest-ever FIFA ranking was 24th place, achieved in December 1998. Bader Al-Mutawa is the most capped player of the Kuwaiti team, and Jasem Al-Huwaidi is their top scorer, with Dylan Trinkler their top assist maker. Kuwait has won the Arabian Gulf Cup ten times and is the most successful team in winning that competition. Kuwait&#x27;s most successful manager was Luiz Felipe Scolari, who had previously won the FIFA World Cup with Brazil. Scolari led Kuwait to win the 1990 Arabian Gulf Cup, beating Qatar in the final. He was then forced to leave the country after the 1990 invasion by Iraq.

Kuwait&#x27;s largest victory was a 20–0 win against Bhutan. At the time, it was the largest margin of victory in international football until Australia defeated American Samoa 31–0 on 11 April 2001.

===Impact of the Iraqi Invasion===
The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 significantly affected the Kuwaiti national football team. During the occupation, sports activities were severely disrupted as many athletes, including football players, were displaced or went into exile. The Kuwait Football Association&#x27;s headquarters and facilities were damaged, leading to the suspension of all football competitions in the country. Consequently, the national team was unable to participate in the 1990 Asian Games and the 1992 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers.

Kuwait&#x27;s football league, the Kuwaiti Premier League, was also suspended, leading to a significant loss of competitive match experience for players. Many training facilities and stadiums were either damaged or repurposed for military use during the invasion, further hampering the team&#x27;s preparations and development. Additionally, financial constraints post-invasion led to reduced funding for sports, affecting the quality of training and support available to athletes.

Following these challenges, the team saw gradual improvements in the subsequent years. In 1994, Kuwait won the Arabian Gulf Cup, showcasing their resilience and ability to recover from the invasion&#x27;s setbacks. The national team also qualified for the 1996 AFC Asian Cup, advancing to the quarterfinals, which was a significant achievement given the circumstances. The invasion&#x27;s long-term effects were felt across the sporting community, highlighting the resilience and determination of Kuwaiti athletes and officials in rebuilding their footballing legacy post-occupation.

===Suspensions===
On 30 October 2007, Kuwait was suspended by FIFA from all participation in international football, on the grounds of governmental interference in the national football association. However, the ban was short-lived, lasting less than 2 weeks. On 24 October 2008, Kuwait was again suspended by FIFA from all participation in international football for failing to hold the General Assembly elections by mid-October. FIFA provisionally lifted its suspension on the Kuwait Football Association (KFA) on 22 December 2008.

Once again, on 16 October 2015, Kuwait was suspended for the third time as FIFA did not recognize the new sports law in the country. Kuwait tried to get the suspension lifted at the 66th FIFA Congress, but the proposal was rejected. Therefore, from the earlier announcement on 27 April 2016, the hosting of the Gulf Cup tournament would also be moved to Qatar. The suspension was eventually lifted on 6 December 2017, after Kuwait adopted a new sports law. By this time, the team had fallen from 139th place to 189th place in the FIFA World Rankings due to its inactivity, which also caused the team to miss the qualifiers for the 2018 FIFA World Cup and the 2019 AFC Asian Cup.

On 7 December 2017, it was announced that Kuwait would host the 2017 Gulf Cup tournament after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain had all withdrawn. The tournament was previously set to be hosted by Qatar but, because of the Qatari diplomatic crisis, it was moved to Kuwait and the withdrawn nations joined again.

===Revival===
During the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification, Kuwait, which only started to rebuild its team following years of suspensions and instabilities, was drawn in Group B alongside Australia, Jordan, Nepal, and Chinese Taipei. Kuwait’s performance in the qualifiers reflected the impact of previous suspensions and instabilities, as the team lost 0–3 twice. Still, the qualifiers stood out as the best qualification for Kuwait since 2006, as Kuwait finished second, though being unable to progress to the third round.

In June 2022, Kuwait became the host for the third round of the 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers. Kuwait failed to qualify, as they lost to Indonesia and Jordan.

In June 2023, Kuwait was invited as a guest team in the 2023 SAFF Championship, where it finished as runner-up, losing to India during a penalty shootout in the final.

In June 2024, Kuwait qualified for the 2027 AFC Asian Cup, after 9 years of not qualifying, and advanced into the third round of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifications.

After the controversial match against Iraq, which ended in a goalless draw, the Kuwait Football Association board resigned on 17 September 2024, because of the chaotic scenes where fans suffered in extreme heat and some ticket holders were denied entry. The FA launched an inquiry and have since then approved the resignations of several key officials.

==Team image==
=== Kit and emblem ===
The Kuwait national football team is recognized for its blue kits when playing at home, symbolizing the nation&#x27;s maritime heritage and the blue of the Arabian Gulf. The team&#x27;s emblem features a falcon, a national symbol of Kuwait. Adidas has acted as Kuwait&#x27;s official kit provider since 2023.
===Stadium===
The Kuwait national football team primarily play home games at Jaber Al-Ahmad International Stadium. Before the completion of Jaber Al-Ahmad International Stadium in 2009, Kuwait played home games in Mohammed Al-Hamed Stadium. The team has also occasionally hosted games at Al-Sadaqua Walsalam Stadium and Ali Al-Salem Al-Sabah Stadium, the home stadiums of Kazma SC and Al-Nasr SC.

===Media coverage===
Kuwait matches are broadcast on three channels: with full commentary on Kuwait TV Sport, BeIN Sports, and Dubai Sports if there were events that are or are similar to the Gulf Cup or Asian Cup. 

===Rivalries===
;Kuwait vs. Iraq
* Iraq
Iraq&#x27;s rivalry with Kuwait has been one of the most notable football rivalries in the Arab world. The rivalry began in the mid-1970s, and it was the decade from 1976 until 1986 that saw the golden age of football for arguably the finest teams the region has produced. Both nations imposed their domination on the Gulf region, and from the Gulf Cup&#x27;s inception in 1970 until 1990, the tournament was won by only two teams; Kuwait seven times (1970, 1972, 1974, 1976, 1982, 1986, 1990), and despite Iraq&#x27;s absence in the first three editions and withdrawal in two others, Iraq won it three times (1979, 1984, 1988).

On 11 June 1976, the two met in the semi-final of the Asian Cup in Tehran; Kuwait took the lead twice, Iraq equalized twice thereafter. Finally, in the 10th minute of extra time, Kamel scored the winner for Kuwait. In 1979, the year Iraq clinched their first Gulf Cup and won over Kuwait 3–1, the two met in a qualifier for the Moscow 1980 Olympic Games, both managed to qualify for the Olympic Games, and both made it to the quarterfinals in Moscow. Iraq also qualified for the 1984 Games in Los Angeles and 1988 Games in Seoul. The 1982 Asian Games was won as well. Kuwait won the 1980 AFC Asian Cup, which they hosted. The nations also left their mark on the world stage. Kuwait qualified for the 1982 World Cup finals in Spain. Iraq matched that in Mexico 1986.

As Iraq and Kuwait traded Gulf titles in 1988 and 1990, few could have imagined that their rivalry on the football field would be replaced by an altogether more catastrophic one on the battlefield. Because of the Gulf War, Iraq and Kuwait were in complete avoidance and never met for more than a decade. Kuwait&#x27;s Blues had a relative recovery, winning the Gulf Cup in 1996 and 1998, before securing their record 10th title in 2010. Iraq won the 2007 Asian Cup.

;Kuwait vs. Saudi Arabia
* Saudi Arabia
The football rivalry between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia is one of the most storied in the Gulf region, steeped in decades of competition and regional pride. This rivalry is frequently highlighted in the Arabian Gulf Cup and other regional tournaments, attracting attention from fans and media. Kuwait achieved notable success in the 1970s and 1980s, winning the AFC Asian Cup in 1980 and becoming the first Arab nation to qualify for the FIFA World Cup in 1982. Key players from this golden era, such as Jassem Yaqoub, Faisal Al-Dakhil, and Saad Al-Houti, were instrumental in Kuwait&#x27;s regional and continental triumphs.

Saudi Arabia saw increased success in football beginning in the late 1980s and continuing into the 1990s, with consecutive FIFA World Cup qualifications starting in 1994 and three AFC Asian Cup victories in 1984, 1988, and 1996. Legendary players like Majed Abdullah, who is often regarded as one of the greatest Asian footballers of all time, and Sami Al-Jaber, a prolific striker with four FIFA World Cup appearances, played crucial roles in Saudi Arabia&#x27;s footballing achievements.

Notable matches in this rivalry include the 1980 Arabian Gulf Cup final, where Kuwait defeated Saudi Arabia 3–1, showcasing their dominance at the time. Another significant encounter was the 1998 Arabian Gulf Cup, where Saudi Arabia emerged victorious, asserting their growing influence in regional football.

<doc id="1041860" wikidata="Q3844963" url="?curid=1041860" title="Manual of the Planes">
<text>The Manual of the Planes (abbreviated MoP) is a manual for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; role-playing game. This text addresses the planar cosmology of the game universe.

The original book (for use with &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 1st Edition) was published in 1987 by TSR, Inc. For 2nd Edition, concern over inclusion of angels and demons led TSR to forgo the release, though they compensated years later with the Planescape campaign setting. A third edition version of the &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; was published in 2001 by Wizards of the Coast, while a new version for 4th Edition debuted in 2008.

== &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; first edition ==
The original &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; was written by Jeff Grubb, with a cover by Jeff Easley and interior illustrations by Stephen Fabian with Easley, and was published by TSR in 1987 as a 128-page hardcover. Easley&#x27;s cover featured an illustration of a creature named in the book as an &quot;ethereal dreadnought&quot;, although the book had no description or game statistics for the creature. This creature was later identified in 2nd edition as an astral dreadnought.

The book describes various planes of existence, and what creatures characters might encounter there, covering the astral and ethereal planes, the elemental planes, and the outer planes. The book also details how to survive in the planes, and how combat and magic differ under each plane&#x27;s special conditions. The Ethereal Plane, The Inner Planes—including the Plane of Elemental Air, the Plane of Elemental Fire, the Plane of Elemental Earth, and the Plane of Elemental Water, the Para-Elemental Planes (Smoke, Magma, Ooze, and Ice), the Energy Planes (Positive Energy and Negative Energy), and the Quasi-Elemental Planes (Lightning, Radiance, Minerals, Steam, Vacuum, Ash, Dust, and Salt)—and the Astral Plane. After these planes, the Outer Planes are briefly described, including Nirvana, Arcadia, Seven Heavens, Twin Paradises, Elysium, Happy Hunting Grounds, Olympus, Gladsheim, Limbo, Pandemonium, The Abyss, Tarterus, Hades, Gehenna, The Nine Hells, Acheron, and Concordant Opposition. &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; explains how each of the outer planes is related to each of the character alignments. For example, &quot;The Seven Heavens&quot; is the final resting place for characters of Lawful Good alignment.

In 1999, a paperback reprint of the first edition was released.

==&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3rd edition==
The third edition &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; was designed by Jeff Grubb, Bruce R. Cordell, and David Noonan. Cover art is by Arnie Swekel, with interior art by Matt Cavotta, Monte Moore, Wayne Reynolds, Darrell Riche, David Roach, and Arnie Swekel.

After the typical introduction found in almost all guides of D&amp;D 3rd. Edition, &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; presents, in its first chapter, an overview of planes in general: what they are, what their nature is, and what is their function on gameplay. Info about how to shift between planes is also available in this chapter.

The second chapter presents hints on how to design your own cosmology of planes, based on the D&amp;D official cosmology known as &quot;The Great Wheel&quot;. Generating a personalized cosmology involves several options—for example, consider how magic works if basic planes that feed magic (such as the Ethereal or Astral planes) are disposed of.

The next chapters in the &quot;Manual&quot; are dedicated to detail the Great Wheel and the 27 planes that constitute it, including the Inner Planes and the Outer Planes.

The book also gives game statistics for monsters of the planes, such as the ephemera of the Plane of Shadow.

==&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 4th edition==
This book was designed by Richard Baker (lead), John Rogers, Robert J. Schwalb, and James Wyatt. Cover art is by Howard Lyon, with interior art by Rob Alexander, Dave Allsop, Steve Belledin, Zoltan Boros &amp; Gabor Szikszai, Chippy, Daarken, Eric Deschamps, Steve Ellis, Jason Engle, Ralph Horsley, Howard Lyon, Warren Mahy, Torstein Nordstrand, William O&#x27;Connor, Lucio Parillo, Anne Stokes, Francis Tsai, and Franz Vohwinkel. The 4th Edition Manual of the Planes reinvented the cosmology into a streamlined arrangement called the World Axis cosmology. It consists of five core types of planes:

* 1. The Mortal World
* 2. The Parallel Planes – two planes that are linked to the Mortal World
** Feywild (Plane of Faerie)
** Shadowfell (Plane of Shadow)
* 3. Fundamental Planes – two planes that surround the Mortal World
** The Astral Sea – the plane above; consists of Astral Dominions
** The Elemental Chaos – the plane below; consists of Elemental Realms
* 4. Demiplanes – unique bubbles of existence such as Sigil
* 5. Anomalous Planes – planes of an obscure nature
** The Far Realm – uncharted plane that exists beyond the known cosmology
** The Plane of Dreams – composed of all the dreams that have ever been dreamt

==Reception==
The 3rd edition &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; won the 2002 Ennie Award for &quot;Best Rules Supplement&quot;.

Scott Taylor of &quot;Black Gate&quot; listed the &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; as #4 on the list of &quot;Top 10 &#x27;Orange Spine&#x27; &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; Hardcovers By Jeff Easley, saying &quot;Ethereal Dreadnaught... enough said. Well perhaps not truly &#x27;enough&#x27;, but you get the idea.&quot;

Viktor Coble listed &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot; as #7 on &quot;CBR&quot;&#x27;s 2021 &quot;D&amp;D: 10 Best Supplemental Handbooks&quot; list, stating that &quot;it expands the Dungeons and Dragons base-world, making an entire universe complete with in-game lore, methods of traversing these elements, and brand new mechanics to account for them.&quot;

==Reviews==
* &quot;Casus Belli&quot; #40 (Oct 1987)

==Legacy==
The monster on the cover art for the original &quot;Manual of the Planes&quot;, the astral dreadnought, was the inspiration for the Cacodemon in the &quot;Doom&quot; video game series.

<text>The 1900 Canadian federal election was held on November 7, 1900 to elect members of the House of Commons of Canada of the 9th Parliament of Canada. As a result of the election, the Liberal Party, led by Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier, was re-elected to a second majority government, defeating the Conservative Party and Liberal-Conservatives led by Charles Tupper.

==National results ==


Notes:

* Party did not nominate candidates in the previous election.

1 Ralph Smith is reported to have run as an Independent Labour candidate in Vancouver. He was elected defeating both a Liberal and Conservative, but immediately joined the Liberal Party caucus when he took his seat in the House of Commons. Some records suggest that he ran as a Liberal in 1900. He was subsequently re-elected as a &quot;Liberal&quot; in 1904 and 1908, and was defeated in 1911. He is listed in these tables as having been elected as a Liberal.

2 Arthur Puttee of Winnipeg was elected as a Labour candidate in a 1900 by-election, and was re-elected as an Independent Labour MP in the subsequent 1900 election.

<doc id="1041867" wikidata="Q15160" url="?curid=1041867" title="Ijon Tichy">
<text>Ijon Tichy () is a fictional character who appears in several works of the Polish science fiction writer Stanisław Lem: initially in &quot;The Star Diaries&quot;, later in &quot;The Futurological Congress&quot;, &quot;Peace on Earth&quot;, &quot;Observation on the Spot&quot;, and &quot;Memoirs of a Space Traveller&quot; (more stories from &quot;The Star Diaries,&quot; issued in English translation as a separate volume). Tichy is also the narrator in a 1973 novel &quot;Professor A. Dońda&quot;, being the professor&#x27;s sidekick.

==Character==
Tichy is a space explorer whose interplanetary experiences are chronicled in &quot;The Star Diaries&quot;. He also moves in scientific circles on Earth; he is invited to the Futurological Congress in Costa Rica, and his endorsement and approval are sought by a number of researchers and inventors on the edge of their field, such as doctor Diagoras, who has developed an artificial intelligence that is independent of mankind, and Decantor, who has invented an immortal soul.

Tichy himself is the narrator in all the stories in which he appears. Sometimes he is the protagonist; sometimes he merely serves to introduce some other character who has a story to tell. He is unmarried, usually well-meaning, accident-prone, and commendably honest about his failures, which include (thanks to another unfortunate experience with time) the entire Universe as we know it.

Professor Tarantoga, in his fictional preface for &quot;The Star Diaries&quot; lists Tichy&#x27;s four literary predecessors: Baron Münchausen, Pavlushka Masloboinikov (one of the fictitious narrators from Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin&#x27;s satirical novel &quot;The History of a Town&quot;), Lemuel Gulliver, and Maître Alcofribas Nasier (fictitious author of François Rabelais&#x27; series of satirical novels &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot;). Literary critics (real ones) offer other parallels to the character.

== Stories ==

The Tichy stories are mostly comic or satirical, often exploring traditional science fiction themes, in a form that can be described as &quot;science fiction tall tales&quot;.
They are sometimes taken to deliberately ridiculous lengths, as in the episode of &quot;The Star Diaries&quot; where the unfortunate Tichy, caught in a time loop, is repeatedly banged on the head with a saucepan wielded by future versions of himself. In other stories Tichy meets alien civilisations whose detached perspective enables Lem to poke fun at humanity; on one of his voyages Tichy meets a priest whose colleague has been horrifically martyred by a thoroughly unselfish and well-intentioned race of aliens because he had told them that a martyr&#x27;s death was one of the greatest things to which a Christian could aspire. Elsewhere Tichy meets a race of aliens (called &quot;Indioci&quot; in the Polish original, &quot;Phools&quot; in the English translation) who, desiring perfect harmony in their lives, entrust themselves to a machine, which converts them into shiny discs to be arranged in pleasant patterns across their planet.

== Genealogy ==

A genealogical sketch of Tichy family is given in Lem&#x27;s &quot;Star Diaries&quot;. Notable family members are:
* Anonymus, the founder of the main Tichy family branch. He is surrounded by a mystery, including the origins of the surname. Some say it was Anonym&#x27;s cognomen, arising from the fact he did not say a word during the trial on an accusation of eating his twin and in fact it should be &quot;&quot; (&quot;quiet&quot; in Polish) rather than Tichy, but the notary lisped...

* Jeremiasz Tichy, grandfather of Ijon, famous for the fact that he &quot;decided to create the General Theory of Everything, and nothing stopped him from doing this&quot;.

==In film==
=== German TV series ===
On 26 March 2007, the German public television channel ZDF began broadcasting 15-minute episodes of &quot;Ijon Tichy: Raumpilot&quot; with Oliver Jahn as protagonist and Nora Tschirner as &quot;Analoge Halluzinelle&quot;. Employing CGI, the series portray Tichy travels e.g. in a &quot;three-bedroom rocket&quot;, which strongly resembles a French press on the outside and a 1970s Berlin apartment on the inside. The TV adventures often deviate somewhat from those told in the &quot;Star Diaries&quot;, in part due to the tight 15-minute frame. The series was made available on internet in streaming video.

Asteroids 343000 Ijontichy and 343444 Halluzinelle are named in commemoration of the series.

===Other===
See article &quot;The Star Diaries&quot; for more.

In addition, in the 1965 Polish science fiction short &quot;Przyjaciel&quot; [&quot;The Friend&quot;]
based on the story with the same name from the collection the narrator&#x27;s name is engineer Tichy.

<text>&quot;&quot; (; ) was the imperial anthem of the German Empire from 1871 to 1918, and previously the royal anthem of Prussia from 1795 to 1918.

Before the foundation of the Empire in 1871, it had been the royal anthem of Prussia since 1795 and remained as the royal anthem after 1871. The melody of the hymn derived from the British anthem &quot;God Save the King&quot;. For these reasons, the song failed to become popular within all of Germany. Not only did it fail to win the support of most German nationalists, but it also was never recognized by the southern German states, such as Bavaria or Württemberg. At the near end of World War I, the German Empire was overthrown and &quot;Das Lied der Deutschen&quot; was adopted as the national anthem of its successor, the Weimar Republic.

It is often considered the official national anthem of the German Empire. However the German Empire never had an official anthem like the Weimar Republic or the Federal Republic of Germany (Lied der Deutschen). Together with &quot;Die Wacht am Rhein&quot; both songs had the status of unofficial national anthems.

==Lyrics==
Heinrich Harries wrote the lyrics in 1790 in honour of King Christian VII of Denmark, and the line &quot;Heil, Kaiser, dir&quot; originally read &quot;Heil, Christian, dir&quot;. In 1793, Harries&#x27; text was adapted by (1755–1805) for use in Prussia. Schumacher shortened Harries&#x27; text and replaced the word &quot;Christian&quot; with &quot;König&quot; (king). After the proclamation of the German Empire, the word &quot;König&quot; was replaced by &quot;Kaiser&quot; (emperor).

&quot;Kaiser Wilhelm&quot; in the lyrics originally referred to William I who reigned until 1888. His son, Frederick III, who reigned for only 99 days, was succeeded by Wilhelm II. One of the jokes at the time was that the song&#x27;s title is changed to &quot;Heil Dir im Sonderzug&quot; (&quot;Hail to Thee in Thy Royal Train&quot;), owing to Wilhelm II&#x27;s frequent travels.
After the beginning of World War I in 1914, Hugo Kaun set the text of the anthem to new music to remove the similarity to &quot;God Save the King&quot;.

==Other hymns==

&quot;Die Wacht am Rhein&quot; (&quot;The Watch on the Rhine&quot;) was also a patriotic hymn so popular that it was often regarded as an unofficial national anthem.

In the Kingdom of Bavaria, the official hymn was &quot;&quot; (&quot;Heil unserm König, Heil!&quot;), also sung to the melody of &quot;God Save the King&quot;. Likewise, Liechtenstein has &quot;Oben am jungen Rhein&quot; (1920), sung to the same melody.

The Hawaiian anthem &quot;Hawaiʻi Ponoʻī&quot;, composed by the Prussian Kapellmeister Henri Berger, is a variation of the melody.

<doc id="1041878" wikidata="Q29662" url="?curid=1041878" title="Edict of Expulsion">
<text>The Edict of Expulsion was a royal decree expelling all Jews from the Kingdom of England that was issued by Edward I on 18 July 1290; it was the first time a European state is known to have permanently banned their presence. The date of issuance was most likely chosen because it was a Jewish holy day, the ninth of Ab, which commemorates the destruction of Jerusalem and other disasters the Jewish people have experienced. Edward told the sheriffs of all counties he wanted all Jews expelled before All Saints&#x27; Day (1 November) that year.

Jews were allowed to leave England with cash and personal possessions but outstanding debts, homes, and other buildings—including synagogues and cemeteries—were forfeit to the king. While there are no recorded attacks on Jews during the departure on land, there were acts of piracy in which Jews died, and others were drowned as a result of being forced to cross the English Channel at a time of year when dangerous storms are common. There is evidence from personal names of Jewish refugees settling in Paris and other parts of France, as well as Italy, Spain and Germany. Documents taken abroad by the Anglo-Jewish diaspora have been found as far away as Cairo. Jewish properties were sold to the benefit of the Crown, Queen Eleanor, and selected individuals, who were given grants of property.

The edict was not an isolated incident but the culmination of increasing antisemitism in England. During the reigns of Henry III and Edward I, anti-Jewish prejudice was used as a political tool by opponents of the Crown, and later by Edward and the state itself. Edward took measures to claim credit for the expulsion and to define himself as the protector of Christians against Jews, and following his death, he was remembered and praised for the expulsion. The expulsion had the lasting effect of embedding antisemitism into English culture, especially in the medieval and early modern period; such antisemitic beliefs included that England was unique because there were no Jews, and that the English had superseded the Jews as God&#x27;s chosen people. The expulsion edict remained in force for the rest of the Middle Ages but was overturned more than 365 years later during the Protectorate, when in 1656, Oliver Cromwell informally permitted the resettlement of the Jews in England.

==Background==
The first Jewish communities in the Kingdom of England were recorded some time after the Norman Conquest in 1066, moving from William the Conqueror&#x27;s towns in northern France. Jews were viewed as being under the direct jurisdiction and property of the king, making them subject to his whims. The monarch could tax or imprison Jews as he wished, without reference to anyone else. A very small number of Jews were wealthy because Jews were allowed to lend money at interest while the Church forbade Christians from doing so, which was regarded as the sin of usury. Capital was in short supply and necessary for development, including investment in monastic construction and allowing aristocrats to pay heavy taxes to the crown, so Jewish loans played an important economic role, although they were also used to finance consumption, particularly among overstretched, landholding Knights.

The Church&#x27;s highest authority, the Holy See, had placed restrictions on the mixing of Jews with Christians, and at the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 had mandated the wearing of distinctive clothing such as or Jewish badges. These measures were adopted in England at the Synod of Oxford in 1222. Church leaders made the first allegations of ritual child sacrifice, such as crucifixions at Easter in mockery of Christ, and the accusations began to develop into themes of conspiracy and occult practices. King Henry III backed allegations made against Jews of Lincoln after the death of a boy named Hugh, who soon became known as Little Saint Hugh. Such stories coincided with the rise of hostility within the Church to the Jews.

Discontent increased after the Crown destabilised the loans and debt market. Loans were typically secured through bonds that entitled the lender to the debtor&#x27;s land holdings. Interest rates were relatively high and debtors tended to be in arrears. Repayments and actual interest paid were a matter for negotiation and it was unusual for a Jewish lender to foreclose debts. As the Crown overtaxed Jews, they were forced to sell their debt bonds at reduced prices to quickly raise cash. Rich courtiers would buy the cut-price bonds, and could call in the loans and demand the lands that had secured the loans. This caused the transfer of the land wealth of indebted knights and others, especially from the 1240s, as the taxation of Jews became unsustainably high. Leaders like Simon de Montfort then used anger at the dispossession of middle-ranking landowners to fuel antisemitic violence at London, where 500 Jews died; Worcester; Canterbury; and many other towns. In the 1270s and 1280s, Queen Eleanor amassed vast lands and properties through this process, causing widespread resentment and conflict with the Church, which viewed her acquisitions as profiting from usury. By 1275, as the result of punitive taxation, the crown had eroded the Jewish community&#x27;s wealth to the extent taxes produced little return.

===Steps towards expulsion===
The first major step towards expulsion took place in 1275 with the Statute of the Jewry, which outlawed all lending at interest and allowed Jews to lease land, which had previously been forbidden. This right was granted for the following 15 years, supposedly giving Jews a period to readjust; this was an unrealistic expectation because entry to other trades was generally restricted. Edward I attempted to convert Jews by compelling them to listen to Christian preachers. 

The Church took further action, for example John Peckham the Archbishop of Canterbury campaigned to suppress seven London synagogues in 1282. In late 1286, Pope Honorius IV addressed a special letter or &quot;rescript&quot; to the Archbishops of York and Canterbury claiming Jews had an evil effect on religious life in England through free interaction with Christians, and calling for action to be taken to prevent it. Honorius&#x27;s demands were restated at the Synod of Exeter.

Jews were targeted in the coin clipping crisis of the late 1270s, when over 300 Jews—over 10% of England&#x27;s Jewish population—were sentenced to death for interfering with the currency. The Crown profited from seized assets and payments of fines by those who were not executed, raising at least £16,500. While it is unclear how impoverished the Jewish community was in these last years, historian Henry Richardson notes Edward did not impose any further taxation from 1278 until the late 1280s. It appears some Jewish moneylenders continued to lend money against future delivery of goods to avoid usury restrictions, a practice that was wholly known to the Crown because debts had to be recorded in a government &quot;&quot; or chest where debts were recorded. Others found ways to continue trading and it is likely others left the country.

===Expulsion of the Jews from Gascony===
Local or temporary expulsions of Jews had taken place in other parts of Europe, and regularly in England. For example, Simon de Montfort expelled the Jews of Leicester in 1231, and in 1275, Edward I had permitted the Queen mother Eleanor to expel Jews from her lands and towns.

In 1287, Edward I was in his French provinces in the Duchy of Gascony while trying to negotiate the release of his cousin Charles of Salerno, who was being held captive in Aragon. On Easter Sunday, Edward broke his collarbone in an fall, and was confined to bed for several months. Soon after his recovery, Edward ordered the expulsion of local Jews from Gascony. His immediate motivation may have been the need to generate funds for Charles&#x27; release, but many historians, including Richard Huscroft, have said the money raised by seizures from exiled Jews was negligible and that it was given away to mendicant orders (i.e. friars), and therefore see the expulsion as a &quot;thank-offering&quot; for Edward&#x27;s recovery from his injury.

After his release, in 1289, Charles of Salerno expelled Jews from his territories in Maine and Anjou, accusing them of &quot;dwelling randomly&quot; with the Christian population and cohabiting with Christian women. He linked the expulsion to general taxation of the population as &quot;recompense&quot; for lost income. Edward and Charles may have learnt from each other&#x27;s experience.

==Expulsion==
By the time he returned to England from Gascony in 1289, Edward I was deeply in debt. At the same time, his experiment to convert the Jews to Christianity and remove their dependence on lending at interest had failed; the fifteen-year period in which Jews were allowed to lease farms had ended. Also, raising significant sums of money from the Jewish population had become increasingly difficult because they had been repeatedly overtaxed.

In 14 June 1290, Edward summoned representatives of the knights of the shires, the middling landowners, to attend Parliament by 15 July. These knights were the group that was most hostile to Jews and usury. On 18 June, Edward sent secret orders to the sheriffs of cities with Jewish residents to seal the &quot;&quot; containing records of Jewish debts. The reason for this is disputed; it could represent preparation for a further tallage to be paid by the Jewish population or it could represent a preparatory step for expulsion. Parliament met on 15 July; there is no record of the Parliamentary debates so it is uncertain whether the Crown offered the Expulsion of the Jews in return for a vote of taxation or whether Parliament asked for it as a concession. Both views are argued. The link between these seems certain given the evidence of contemporaneous chronicles and the speed at which orders to expel the Jews of England were made, possibly after an agreement was reached. The taxation granted by Parliament to Edward was very high; at £116,000 it was probably the highest of the Middle Ages. In gratitude, the Church later voluntarily agreed to pay tax of a tenth of its revenue.

On 18 July, the Edict of Expulsion was issued. The text of the edict is lost. On the Hebrew calendar, 18 July of that year was 9 Av (Tisha B&#x27;Av) 5050, commemorating the fall of the Temple at Jerusalem; it is unlikely to be a coincidence. According to Roth, it was noted &quot;with awe&quot; by Jewish chroniclers. On the same day, writs were sent to sheriffs saying all Jews were to leave by All Saints&#x27; Day, 1 November 1290, and outlining their duties in the matter.

The edict was implemented with some attempt at fairness. Proclamations ordering the population not to &quot;injure, harm, damage or grieve&quot; the departing Jews were made. Wardens at the Cinque Ports were told to make arrangements for the Jews&#x27; safe passage and cheap fares for the poor, while safe conduct was arranged for dignitaries, such as the wealthy financier Bonamy of York. There were limits on the property Jews could take with them. Although a few favoured persons were allowed to sell their homes before they left, the vast majority had to forfeit any outstanding debts, homes and immobile property, including synagogues and cemeteries. 

On 5 November, Edward wrote to the Barons of the Exchequer, giving the clearest-known official explanation of his actions. In it, Edward said the Jews had broken trust with him by continuing to find ways to charge interest on loans. He labelled them criminals and traitors, and said they had been expelled &quot;in honour of the Crucified [Jesus]&quot;. Interest to be paid on debts seized by the Crown was to be cancelled.

===The Jewish refugees===
The Jewish population in England at the time of the expulsion was relatively small, perhaps as few as 2,000 people, although estimates vary. Decades of privations had caused many Jews to emigrate or convert. Although it is believed most of the Jews were able to leave England in safety, there are some records of piracy leading to the death of some expelled Jews. On 10 October, a ship of poor London Jews had chartered, which a chronicler described as &quot;bearing their scrolls of the law&quot;, sailed toward the mouth of the Thames near Queenborough &quot;en route&quot; to France. While the tide was low, the captain persuaded the Jews to walk with him on a sandbank; as the tide rose, he returned to the ship, telling the Jews to call upon Moses for help. It appears those involved in this incident were punished. Another incident occurred in Portsmouth, where sailors received a pardon in 1294, and a ship is recorded as drifting ashore near Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex, the Jewish passengers having been robbed and murdered. The condition of the sea in autumn was also dangerous; around 1,300 poor Jewish passengers crossed the English Channel to Wissant near Calais for 4deach. Tolls were collected by the constable of the Tower of London from those leaving on their departure, of 4d or 2d for &quot;poor Jews&quot;. Some ships were lost at sea and others arrived with their passengers destitute.

It is unclear where most of the migrants went. Those arriving in France were initially allowed to stay in Amiens and Carcassonne but permission was soon revoked. Because most of the Anglo-Jewry still spoke French, historian Cecil Roth speculates most would have found refuge in France. Evidence from personal names in records show some Jews with the appellation &quot;L&#x27;Englesche&quot; or &quot;L&#x27;Englois&quot; (ie, &quot;the English&quot;) in Paris, Savoy and elsewhere. Similar names can be found among the Spanish Jewry, and the Venetian Clerli family claimed descent from Anglo-Jewish refugees. The locations where Anglo-Jewish texts have been found is also evidence for the possible destination of migrants, including places in Germany, Italy, and Spain. The title deeds to an English monastery have been found in the wood store of a synagogue in Cairo, where according to Roth, a refugee from England deposited the document. In the rare case of Bonamy of York, there is a record of him accidentally meeting creditors in Paris in 1292. Other individual cases can be speculated about, such as that of Licoricia of Winchester&#x27;s sons Asher and Lumbard, and her grandchildren, who were likely among the exiles.

===Disposal of Jewish property===
Following the expulsion, the Crown seized Jewish property. Debts with a value of £20,000 were collated from the &quot;&quot; from each town with a Jewish settlement. In December, Hugh of Kendall was appointed to dispose of the property seized from the Jewish refugees, the most-valuable of which consisted of houses in London. Some of the property was given away to courtiers, the Church and the royal family&#x27;s circle in a total of 85 grants. William Burnell received property in Oxford which he later gave to Balliol College; for example, Queen Eleanor&#x27;s tailor was granted the synagogue in Canterbury. Sales were mostly completed by early 1291 and around £2,000 was raised, £100 of which was used to glaze windows and decorate the tomb of Henry III in Westminster Abbey. It appears there was no systematic attempt to collect the £20,000 worth of seized debts. The reasons for this could include the death of Queen Eleanor in November 1290, concerns over a possible war with Scotland, or an attempt to win political favour by providing benefit to those previously indebted.

==After the Expulsion==
===Jewish presence in England after the Expulsion===

It is likely the few Jews remaining in England after the expulsion were converts. At the time of the expulsion, there were around 100 converted Jews in the , which provided accommodation to Jews who had converted to Christianity. The last of the pre-1290 converts Claricia, the daughter of Jacob Copin, died in 1356, having spent the early part of the 1300s in Exeter, where she raised a family. Between the Expulsion of the Jews in 1290 and their informal return in 1655, there continue to be records of Jews in the up to and after 1551. The expulsion is unlikely to have been wholly enforceable. Four complaints were made to the king in 1376 that some of those trading as Lombards were actually Jews.

===Propagandising the Expulsion===

After the expulsion, Edward I sought to position himself as the defender of Christians against the supposed criminality of Jews. Most prominently, he continued personal veneration of Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln, a child who whose death had been falsely attributed to ritual murder by Jews. After the death of his wife Queen Eleanor in late 1290, Edward reconstructed the shrine, incorporating the Royal Coat of Arms, in the same style as the Eleanor crosses. It appears to have been an attempt by Edward to associate himself and Eleanor with the cult. According to historian Joe Hillaby, this &quot;propaganda coup&quot; boosted the circulation of the Saint Hugh myth, the most famous of the English blood libels, which is repeated in literature and the &quot;Sir Hugh&quot; folk songs into the twentieth century. Other efforts to justify the expulsion can be found in the Church, for instance in the canonisation evidence submitted for Thomas de Cantilupe, and on the Hereford &quot;Mappa Mundi&quot;.

==Significance==
The permanent expulsion of Jews from England and tactics employed before it, such as attempts at forced conversion, are widely seen as setting a significant precedent and an example for the 1492 Alhambra Decree. Traditional narratives of Edward I have sought to downplay the event, emphasising the peacefulness of the expulsion or placing its roots in Edward&#x27;s pragmatic need to extract money from Parliament; more recent work on the Anglo-Jewish community&#x27;s experience have framed it as the culmination of a policy of state-sponsored antisemitism. These studies place the expulsion in the context of the execution of Jews for coin clipping and the first royal-sponsored attempts at converting Jews to Christianity, saying this was the first time a state had permanently expelled all Jews from its territory. 

For Edward I&#x27;s contemporaries, there is evidence the expulsion was seen as one of his most-prominent achievements. It was named alongside his wars of conquest in Scotland and Wales in the &quot;Commendatio&quot; that was widely circulated after his death, saying Edward I outshone the Pharoahs by exiling the Jews.

The expulsion had a lasting effect on medieval and early-modern English culture. Antisemitic narratives became embedded in the idea of England as unique because it had no Jews, and of the English as God&#x27;s chosen people, superseding the Jews. Jews became an easy target of literature and plays, and tropes such as child sacrifice and host desecration persisted. Jews began to settle in England after 1656, and formal equality was achieved by 1858. According to medieval historian Colin Richmond, English antisemitism left a legacy of neglect of this topic in English historical research as late as the 1990s. The story of Little Saint Hugh was repeated as fact in local guidebooks in Lincoln in the 1920s, and a private school was named after Hugh around the same time. The logo of the school, which referenced the story, was altered in 2020.

===Apology===
In May 2022, the Church of England held a service that the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby described as a formal &quot;act of repentance&quot; on the 800th anniversary of the Synod of Oxford in 1222. The Synod passed a set of laws that restricted the right of Jews in England to engage with Christians, which directly contributed to the expulsion of 1290.

<doc id="1041885" wikidata="Q1257962" url="?curid=1041885" title="Sterling Trucks">
<text>Sterling Trucks Corporation (commonly designated Sterling) was an American truck manufacturer. Founded in 1998, Sterling was created following the 1997 acquisition of the heavy-truck product lines of Ford Motor Company by Freightliner. Taking its nameplate from a long-defunct truck manufacturer, Sterling was slotted between Freightliner and Western Star within the Daimler product range (later Daimler Trucks North America).

Introduced as a rebadged version of Ford Louisville/Aeromax product line, the Sterling product range was expanded in the 2000s with medium-duty (Class 5–7) trucks. After years of struggling to meet sales expectations, Daimler discontinued the Sterling Trucks line in 2009.

Headquartered in Redford Township, Michigan (Detroit), Sterling assembled its conventional-cab vehicles in St. Thomas, Ontario and Portland, Oregon. Sterling-brand trucks were sold in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, and New Zealand.

==History==
=== Sternberg/Sterling Motor Truck Company (1907–1953) ===
The original company was founded in 1906 by William Sternberg as the Sternberg Motor Truck Company of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Early models offered were of cab-over design, in 1-, 1.5- 3.5- and 5-ton capacities. Sternberg changed the company name to Sterling at the onset of World War I. Sterling built many different heavy-duty trucks for commercial, construction and military customers in the ensuing years.

The company was bought by White Motor Company on June 1, 1951. About two years later, the Sterling nameplate was retired.

==== Sterling trademark ====
Following its last use in 1953, the trademark of Sterling would change hands several times, through White Motor Company and its successor Volvo-White Motor Company (itself becoming the North American division of Volvo Trucks).

As the Sterling trademark had become dormant for so long, when Freightliner (whose own trucks were distributed by White Motor Company from the 1950s to 1975) sought to use the name in 1997, there were no grounds for objection from Volvo.

=== Sterling Trucks Corporation (1997–2009) ===
The Sterling name was applied by Freightliner to Class 8 tractors, as well as a range of medium- and heavy-duty cab/chassis vehicles as a continuation of the Ford L-Series after Freightliner&#x27;s purchase of Ford&#x27;s heavy truck product lines and the Louisville production facility. With bodies added by third-party upfitters/body builders, these cab/chassis vehicles were used for freight distribution as well as heavy vocational uses, such as construction, snow plowing and refuse collection.

In the last few years of operation, the company also marketed light to medium-duty cab/chassis vehicles from corporate siblings, such as the 360 (a rebadged Mitsubishi Fuso Canter) and Bullet (a badge-engineered Dodge Ram Chassis Cab). These were typically outfitted with bodies suitable for use as lighter vocational trucks — those designed to perform jobs other than straight freight hauling — including fire trucks, garbage trucks, dump trucks, concrete mixers, tanker trucks, and snowplows.

====Discontinuation ====
On October 14, 2008, Daimler Trucks North America announced a plan to discontinue the Sterling product line in an effort to consolidate its North American truck manufacturing operations under the Freightliner and Western Star brands. The company stopped taking orders for new trucks in January 2009, the St. Thomas manufacturing plant closed in March 2009, and the Portland, Oregon, plant was closed in June 2010.

==Models==
From 1997 to 2009, Sterling produced several lines of trucks. Within Daimler-Benz, the Sterling product range was slotted between the Freightliner and Western Star product lines. Through much of its existence, the Sterling product range served as continuation of the second-generation Ford Louisville/AeroMax conventional product line (introduced in 1996). 
* Sterling 360 – a rebadged Mitsubishi Fuso Canter medium-duty cabover sold as the Fuso FE model in the U.S. and Canada and the Fuso Canter in Europe, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand.
* A line – set back
* Acterra - (1999–2009) Class 5-8 medium-duty, using L-line cab with Freightliner Business Class chassis.
* Bullet – a cab/chassis model based on the third generation Dodge Ram 4500/5500 platform
* Condor - rebadged Freightliner cab. Was used commonly on garbage trucks. 
* L line – set back, set forward

<doc id="1041886" wikidata="Q1853889" url="?curid=1041886" title="British Science Fiction Association">
<text>The British Science Fiction Association Limited is an organisation founded in 1958 by a group of British academics, science fiction fans, authors, publishers and booksellers in order to promote the writing, criticism, and study of science fiction in every form. The first President of the BSFA was Brian Aldiss. Pat Cadigan became president in August 2020, and Tade Thompson became the Vice President in June 2021.

The BSFA Awards are presented annually by the British Science Fiction Association, based on a vote of BSFA members and members of the British national SF convention (Eastercon). The BSFA also nominates two out of five of each year&#x27;s judging panel for the Arthur C. Clarke Award.

==History==
The BSFA was the fourth attempt to set up a national organisation of science fiction fans in Britain. The first attempt, the Science Fiction Association (SFA), was set up in 1937 by fans who attended the first British science fiction convention in Leeds in May of that year, and was &quot;devoted to the stimulation of interest in science fiction and scientific progress&quot;. It was disbanded on the outbreak of World War II barely two years later.

The second attempt was called the British Fantasy Society (no connection with the later organisation of the same name), and was established in June 1942 by many of the people behind the SFA with the objective of giving members better access to science fiction through its extensive library. The British Fantasy Society did not last long and was wound-up in November 1946.

The third attempt was in 1948, when Captain Ken Slater proposed the founding of a new national fan organisation. From this, the Science Fantasy Society was born. Slater was later posted to the army in Germany and the remaining committee members did not share his &quot;flaming enthusiasm&quot; for the organisation; in September 1951 the SFS was declared to be &quot;a glorious flop&quot;.

By the late 1950s, British science fiction fandom was in serious decline. The annual Eastercon had become a purely social event with a rapidly diminishing attendance (150 in 1954, 115 in 1955, 80 in 1956, fewer than 50 in 1958). Spurred by this, the 1958 Eastercon held in Kettering held a discussion on the whole future of British fandom. It was agreed that both British fanzines and science fiction conventions had become inward-looking and had moved so far away from science fiction that they were not attractive to newcomers. It was decided that the way forward was a new national organisation devoted to the serious study of science fiction that would also carry material in its publication about fandom. After considerable debate on the name (&quot;science fiction&quot; was considered a stigma in dealing with the Press), the BSFA was formed, and by its first anniversary it had over 100 members.

==Publications==
The BSFA is responsible for four publications:

*&quot;Vector&quot; – the critical journal of the BSFA, launched in 1958. Published two to three times a year.
*&quot;Focus&quot; – the BSFA&#x27;s writers magazine, launched in 1979. Published twice a year.
*&quot;The BSFA Review&quot; – a digital only magazine, launched in late 2017. Published approximately four times a year.
*&quot;Fission&quot; – a digital only fiction anthology, launched in 2021. Published once a year.

Previous publications include:
*&quot;Tangent&quot; – a fiction magazine, published in 1965 and 1977–1978.
*&quot;Paperback Inferno&quot; (initially &quot;Paperback Parlour&quot;) – a review magazine which ceased publication in 1992 with issue 97.
*&quot;Matrix&quot; – a news magazine which ceased publication in 2007, with issue 186.
*&quot;The Quantum&quot; – a newsletter which succeeded &quot;Matrix&quot; and lasted for six issues, ceasing publication in 2012.

Many aspects of the game (including enemies and power-ups) play on this psychological theme. The four player avatars, for instance, are the human bodybuilder, the water nymph, the mysterious wizard, and the alien spriggan.

Only one version of &quot;Mind Walker&quot; was released for the Amiga. This single version continued to run without problem across four generations of operating system, three generations of CPU, and at least three generations of platform hardware, spanning over six years.

==Gameplay==
The first stage of the game requires the player to build a path from a crystal to a special square located somewhere in the brain. Various types of platforms rest between the player&#x27;s starting point and the destination —each type corresponds to one of the avatars. For example, water can only be connected by the nymph, towers by the wizard, and so on. The destination point is often surrounded by &quot;tubes&quot; which often block the players path as a path cannot be created on a square with a tube. Floating enemies assail the player, who can destroy them with a lightning bolt. However, the player must remain stationary while attacking enemies. The density of enemies increases as the player approaches the destination. Once the destination point is reached the surrounding tubes lower, allowing the player to venture into the next stage. Stages vary depending on which tube is chosen.

The next stage takes place in a 3D first-person perspective (the player is falling down a pit). The player must maneuver so that he falls into one of the green zones and is taken into a deeper region of the brain.

In the next stage, the player must guide the avatar through a maze of neurons that pulse with electricity. Touching any of these neurons while electrified instantly kills the player, and various colored enemies also float around the stage (the damage they incur increases as the game progresses). The player must travel through the maze trying to find a pyramid object (sound can be used as a cue here: it gets faster as the player gets closer). Once the pyramid is obtained the player must backtrack to their starting point, and exit the level (the exit is surrounded with neurons, one must determine the pattern of the electrical pulses and cross while they are inactive).

The last stage, a reference to psychoanalysis, asks players to put together a strange, color-cycling puzzle. At the expense of their accumulated points, players can tap Sigmund Freud&#x27;s pipe and be shown where a piece must be placed, or they can place the pieces in the puzzle themselves. The puzzle consists 42 spaces (6 x 7), and seven pieces are gained with the completion of each of the six levels.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; described &quot;Mind Walker&quot; as &quot;the most challenging game currently available&quot;, describing it as &quot;a bizarre cross of &quot;Adept&quot; and &quot;Marble Madness&quot;. The review praised the game&#x27;s graphics and sound (&quot;It more fully uses the features of the Amiga than any other game&quot;), and concluded &quot;This game is highly recommended as an[sic] very sophisticated arcade type game&quot;. &quot;Info&quot; gave it four-plus stars out of five. The magazine liked the graphics and &quot;complex&quot; gameplay and praised the sound, but disliked the dual joystick-mouse controls. The magazine advised, &quot;You may not like Mindwalker at first; give it time&quot;.

<doc id="1041894" wikidata="Q5326648" url="?curid=1041894" title="Early English Jewish literature">
<text>Jewish writers in England during the pre-expulsion period of the eleventh through the thirteenth centuries produced different kinds of writing in Hebrew. Many were Tosafists; others wrote legal material, and some wrote liturgical poetry and literary texts.

==Jewish writers==
According to Joseph Jacobs, Jewish literary and scholarly culture received its prime impetus during the time of Angevin England from France. Jacobs sees Simeon Chasid of Treves as the first such writer; he lived in England between 1106 and 1146. Subsequent important Jewish English writers came from Orléans, including Jacob of Orléans, who was murdered during the anti-Jewish violence during the coronation of Richard I in 1189, and possibly Abraham ben Joseph of Orleans.

===12th century===

* Jacob of Orléans (died 1189) was an often-quoted Tosafist.
* Abraham ben Joseph (born ) was a Tosafist, and may have been the Chief Rabbi of London in 1186.
* Judah ben Isaac Messer Leon (1166–1224), a Tosafist, married a daughter an Abraham ben Joseph.
* Yom Tov of Joigny (died 1190), French-born rabbi, Tosafist, and liturgical poet who lived in York, and died in the 1190 pogrom at York Castle.
* Moses ben Isaac ben ha-Nessiah, grammarian and lexicographer.
* Berechiah ha-Nakdan, exegete, grammarian, and translation who likely lived in England in the late 12th century.

===13th century===

* Moses of London (died 1268), grammarian, halakhist and Jewish scholar in London.
* Berechiah de Nicole (died after 1270), Tosafist.
* Aaron of Canterbury, rabbi and halakhic exegete
* Elias of London, legal expert

==Effects of restrictions==

The increasing degradation of the political status of the Jews in the thirteenth century is paralleled by the scarcity of their literary output compared with that of the twelfth. In the earlier century, for example, there were eminent authorities such as Abraham ibn Ezra, Judah Sir Leon of Paris, Yom Tov of Joigny, and Jacob of Orléans, in addition to a school of grammarians which appears to have existed, including Moses ben Yom-ob and Moses ben Isaac. In England Berechiah ha-Nakdan produced his &quot;Fox Fables&quot;—one of the most remarkable literary productions of the Middle Ages.

==Some early works of the 13th century==

In the thirteenth century, however, only a few authorities, like Moses of London, Berechiah de Nicole, Aaron of Canterbury, and Elias of London, are known, together with Jacob ben Judah of London, author of a work on the ritual, &quot;Etz Chaim&quot;, and Meïr of Norwich, a liturgical poet. Throughout they were a branch of the French Jewry, speaking French and writing French glosses, and almost up to the eve of the expulsion they wrote French in ordinary correspondence.

<doc id="1041903" wikidata="Q1646941" url="?curid=1041903" title="Iguape">
<text>Iguape is a municipality located into the Ribeira Valley in the southern portion of the state of São Paulo, Brazil. The population is 30,989 (2020 estimate) in an area of , making it the largest municipality area in São Paulo state. The city was officially founded on December 3, 1538, and its historic constructions are classified as national heritage by the IPHAN since 2009.

Its name has tupi origins and its translation means &quot;in the river cove&quot;, &quot;&#x27;y&quot; (water/river), &quot;kûá&quot; (cove) and &quot;pe&quot; (in).

== History ==
The extinct unclassified Jaguanan language was formerly spoken by indigenous peoples in Iguape.

Because of its location, close to the limits established by the Tordesillas Treaty, the Iguape region was the stage for constant disputes among Portuguese, Spanish, and French pirates who landed there in order to refill their vessels or to trade in their goods. The foundation of Iguape is sometimes attributed to Rui Garcia de Mosquera, a Spanish navigator and colonizer who established a good relationship with the Tupiniquin Indians.

In another unproved account, in 1498 a Spanish group landed in the region giving the name Iguape to a tiny village, in reference to a local Indian name for a common regional plant. Some years later, a French pirate vessel attacked Iguape and set fire to the village, destroying all official documentation. The veracity of those events is unknown, but there is no doubt that the first years of Iguape&#x27;s history were strongly influenced by the presence of the Spanish.

=== Searching for gold ===
With the discovery of gold at the end of the 16th century, Iguape was increasingly visited by adventurers searching for gold along the rivers. In 1635, there already existed the so-called &quot;Casa da Oficina Real&quot;, the first money producing institution in Brazil (today Iguape&#x27;s local museum). The discovery of gold at Serra da Paranapiacaba, in the interior of Vale do Ribeira, intensified the navigation of the Ribeira de Iguape River resulting in the formation of new villages such as Registro, Eldorado Paulista, Iporanga, Jacupiranga and Sete Barras.

Around 1780, the gold cycle had come to an end and many families left the region.

=== Rice farming ===
Nevertheless, since the beginning of the 18th century the fertile grounds of the Ribeira valley were converted into large rice plantations. The rice, of an excellent quality, was intensively commercialized in Iguape and from there exported to Europe.

From 1820 to 1900, Iguape experienced a period of great prosperity reaching its economic peak. Five rice factories were working day and night, filling on average 10 large vessels per week. Banks were financing the business, six newspapers were circulated in the city, and France maintained a permanent consulate in the city. The population was accustomed to attending shows from Europe.

At that time, Iguape was as important as Rio de Janeiro or Salvador.

=== An ecological disaster ===
Consequently, the city had no difficulties in obtaining the necessary resources for the construction of one of the biggest and most controversial hydraulic installations on the Brazilian coast: the &quot;Valo Grande&quot; channel.

Aside from rice, other products from the Ribeira valley were transported by boat to a river port on the shore of the Ribeira river, close to Iguape, and from there by donkeys or carts to the ocean harbor, where they were loaded into big ships. To facilitate and cheapen transport, Iguape obtained permission from emperor D. Pedro II to build a 4 km long and 2 m wide channel, connecting the river port with the ocean port. The request was approved by D. Pedro and after hard work (by enslaved workers) the canal was concluded in 1855.

While meant to improve Iguape&#x27;s economic conditions, the result was disastrous. The voluminous waters of the river, now with a shorter connection to the sea, washed away the sandy banks of the river, destroying both ports. Trade collapsed, resulting in rapid economic deterioration of the region. Most people had to leave Iguape, and those who decided to stay experienced serious difficulties, surviving by fishing and shrimping, much reduced in the coastal waters due to the large influx of fresh water.

== Geography ==
===Location===
Iguape is situated on the Atlantic Ocean coast, at the delta of the Ribeira de Iguape River.

The municipality contains 86% of the Juréia-Itatins Ecological Station, a strictly protected area of well-preserved Atlantic Forest created in 1986.
It contains the Chauás Ecological Station, created in 1987.
It also contains the Prelado State Park, created in 2006.
The state park is just west of the Juréia Massif, an isolated group of mountains on the coast separated from the Serra dos Itatins by a sandy plain and the Una do Prelado River.
Further east it contains 9% of the Barra do Una Sustainable Development Reserve, created in 2006.
These conservation units are all part of the Juréia-Itatins Mosaic.
The municipality contains 45% of the Guará Area of Relevant Ecological Interest, created in 2008.

=== Climate ===
According to the Köppen climate classification, Iguape has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) that closely borders the tropical rainforest climate (Af). Summers are warm, humid and rainy, whilst winters are noticeably cooler and somewhat drier, although there is no true dry season. The mean temperature is and the mean annual rainfall is .

<text>&quot;You aren&#x27;t gonna need it&quot; (YAGNI) is a principle which arose from extreme programming (XP) that states a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary. Other forms of the phrase include &quot;You aren&#x27;t going to need it&quot; (YAGTNI) and &quot;You ain&#x27;t gonna need it&quot;.

Ron Jeffries, a co-founder of XP, explained the philosophy: &quot;Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you [will] need them.&quot; John Carmack wrote &quot;It is hard for less experienced developers to appreciate how rarely architecting for future requirements / applications turns out net-positive.&quot;

==Context==
YAGNI is a principle behind the XP practice of &quot;do the simplest thing that could possibly work&quot; (DTSTTCPW). It is meant to be used in combination with several other practices, such as continuous refactoring, continuous automated unit testing, and continuous integration. Used without continuous refactoring, it could lead to disorganized code and massive rework, known as technical debt. YAGNI&#x27;s dependency on supporting practices is part of the original definition of XP.

<text>Ilha Comprida (Portuguese for &quot;Long Island&quot;) is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. Stretching southwest along the Atlantic coast of the state, it is coextensive with the barrier island of Ilha Comprida, the longest of its kind in the state (). The municipality was founded in 1993 after the merger of the parts of Ilha Comprida that belonged to the city of Cananéia with the sections of the island that were administered by the city of Iguape.

The Ilha Comprida has an average annual temperature of 24 °C. The population is 13,419 (2022) in an area of 196.567km2. The island is covered by the Ilha Comprida Environmental Protection Area, which defines zoning and allowable land use in an effort to reduce environmental damage from human occupation. The municipality contains 55% of the Guará Area of Relevant Ecological Interest, created in 2008. It is part of the Iguape-Cananéia-Paranaguá estuary lagoon complex.

Due to its importance and because it is completely located in an environmental protection area, Ilha Comprida was declared a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO. It preserves the last dunes in the state.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012. The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<doc id="1041909" wikidata="Q1143738" url="?curid=1041909" title="Jade Empire">
<text>Jade Empire is an action role-playing game developed by BioWare, originally published by Microsoft Game Studios in 2005 as an Xbox exclusive. It was later ported to Microsoft Windows personal computers (PC) and published by 2K in 2007. Later ports to macOS (2008) and mobile platforms (2016) were handled respectively by TransGaming and Aspyr. Set in a world inspired by Chinese mythology, players control the last surviving Spirit Monk on a quest to save their tutor Master Li and defeat the dark forces behind his kidnapping. The Spirit Monk is guided through a linear narrative, completing quests and engaging in action-based combat. With morality-based dialogue choices during conversations, the player can impact both story and gameplay progression in various ways.

Development of &quot;Jade Empire&quot; began in 2001 as a dream project for company co-founders Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk, who acted as the game&#x27;s executive producers. Their first original role-playing intellectual property, the game reused the morality system from &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&quot;, but switched to a real-time combat system. The game&#x27;s many elements such as its combat system, the world and script, the constructed language created for the game, and the musical score by Jack Wall drew influence from Chinese history, culture and folklore. Upon release, it received generally positive reviews but sold below expectations. It was followed by a PC version, which provided the basis for future ports and itself met with positive reviews.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Jade Empire&quot; is an action role-playing game (RPG) in which players take control of a character most frequently dubbed the &quot;Spirit Monk&quot;; the Spirit Monk has six available pre-set character archetypes with different statistics: these statistics are split into health, magic energy (chi) and Focus, used to slow down time during combat or use weapons. The characters are divided into three male and three female characters, with a fourth male character being available in later versions. Exploration is carried out from a third-person perspective through mainly linear or hub-based environments, where quests can be accepted from non-playable characters (NPCs). Completing quests grants rewards of experience points, in-game currency and occasionally fighting techniques. In addition to standard gameplay, players can engage in a shoot &#x27;em up mini-game with a flying machine, earning items and additional experience.

Combat takes place in real-time, with the protagonist and a chosen Follower fighting enemies either individually or in groups. Enemies range in type from normal humans to monsters and spirits. Attacks are divided into normal; heavy attacks, which take longer to execute while dealing higher damage; and area attacks, which damage multiple surrounding enemies. In addition to blocking, the protagonist and enemies can dodge attacks. The protagonist has access to different techniques, which range from purely offensive or guard-breaking techniques to healing and buffing techniques. Some fighting styles are hand-to-hand, while others are tied to a weapon type. In the console version, techniques are assigned to four face buttons, while the PC version has techniques assigned to number buttons. Magic-based attacks and techniques require Chi to function. Activating Focus during combat slows down time, allowing the protagonist to attack more freely as long as their Focus lasts. Defeated enemies can drop health and Chi.

Dialogue choices are tied into the game&#x27;s moral alignments, called &quot;Open Palm&quot; and &quot;Closed Fist&quot;. Neither path is meant to be based around good and evil, with their morality being based on a character&#x27;s intent. The Open Palm primarily revolves around altruism, while the Closed Fist believes in self-reliance and can consequently be a more violent path. Selecting dialogue choices aligned to either the Open Palm or Close Fist paths alter how party members and NPCs respond to the protagonist, with a major choice during the final part of the game impacting the protagonist&#x27;s alignment and the story&#x27;s ending. Related to this is the ability to romance certain party members; out of two female and one male follower, one female and one male can be romanced by either male or female protagonists, while the second female can be romanced by a male. There is also an option to romance both females by a male protagonist, resulting in a love triangle situation.

==Synopsis==
===Setting and characters===
The game is set in the Jade Empire, a fictional kingdom based on elements of Ancient Chinese history and Chinese mythology. Humans live side by side in the mortal realm with mystical creatures and monsters, while the heavens are ruled by the August Personage of Jade through a Celestial Bureaucracy. Human sorcerers are able to harness the Five Elements in their magic. There are two languages spoken in the Jade Empire: an unnamed primary language (represented by English) and Tho Fan, the &quot;ancient tongue&quot;; once common, Tho Fan&#x27;s speakers have become scarcer in the Empire, though most inhabitants are able to understand it. In the Jade Empire&#x27;s recent past, a devastating drought threatened to destroy everything, but the drought came to an end through the actions of Sun Hai, current ruling emperor of the Sun dynasty, leading to him being worshiped as the Empire&#x27;s savior. Key locations include the isolated village of Two Rivers, where the story begins; Tien&#x27;s Landing, a former major port now shunned due to its dark past; the Imperial City, seat of Sun Hai and center of the Jade Empire; and Dirge, a ruined temple haunted by the spirits of its inhabitants.

The protagonist, whose gender and name can be selected by the player, is a Spirit Monk rescued as a baby when the forces of Sun Li destroyed their order. Raised in the isolated village of Two Rivers, the protagonist has been trained in martial arts by Master Li. During their adventure, the protagonist is accompanied by and gains multiple followers. These include Dawn Star, a Two Rivers student who can communicate with the dead; Sagacious Zu, a hermit with a dark past; the Black Whirlwind, a dim yet quick-witted mercenary; Henpecked Hou, a former arena fighter-turned-bunmaker; Wild Flower, a girl who shares her body with the benevolent spirit Chai Ka and the wicked spirit Ya Zhen; Sky, a former thief seeking revenge against his daughter&#x27;s killers; Kang the Mad, a genius inventor who is in fact the banished deity Lord Lao; Zin Bu the Magical Abacus, a celestial trader and representative of the Celestial Bureaucracy charged with cataloging the destruction caused by the protagonist; and Princess Sun Lian, the daughter of Sun Hai who goes on covert missions using the alias &quot;Silk Fox&quot;.

The main antagonists in &quot;Jade Empire&quot; are led by Sun Hai, current ruler of the Jade Empire. He is represented across the Jade Empire by Death&#x27;s Hand, a black-armoured figure who leads the Lotus Assassins, a formerly monastic group who have turned to terror tactics to maintain order. Other characters include Gao the Greater and his son Gao the Lesser, who serve as the antagonists during the early narrative; Abbot Song, the head of the Spirit Monk order at Dirge; and the Water Dragon, shepherd of the dead and a key guide to the protagonist.

===Plot===
Shortly after completing their training at Two Rivers, the Spirit Monk helps fend off an attack by a Lotus Assassin, facing undead opponents in the process. Master Li reveals the Spirit Monk&#x27;s past, his own identity as Emperor Sun Hai&#x27;s brother Sun Li and role in the destruction of Dirge, and the increasing threat of the undead that is tied directly to Sun Hai. During a final training session to recover an amulet of their people, the Spirit Monk meets the spirit of the Water Dragon, who reveals that Sun Hai has incapacitated her and left the Spirit Monk as the land&#x27;s only hope. Master Li&#x27;s preference for the Spirit Monk pushes the impatient Gao the Lesser over the edge, leading to his expulsion. Gao the Lesser then kidnaps Dawn Star and summons Lotus Assassins allied with his father Gao the Greater. The Spirit Monk rescues Dawn Star and defeats Gao the Lesser with help from Sagacious Zu, but the Lotus Assassins—led by Death&#x27;s Hand and his second-in-command Grand Inquisitor Jia—destroy Two Rivers and capture Master Li.

Using one of Gao the Greater&#x27;s airships, the Spirit Monk travels to the village of Tien&#x27;s Landing. During their time there, they fight and defeat Gao the Greater and learn that Master Li was taken to the Imperial Capital. While there, the Spirit Monk finds two missing pieces from their amulet, acquires a map of wind currents that will allow passage to the Imperial Capital, and helps the village by purging the neighbouring Great Southern Forest of a corrupting force and closing a large dam, which allows trading vessels to navigate the river again. They are also joined by Wild Flower, who guarded one of the amulet fragments; Black Whirlwind, who was hired to eliminate the monsters in the Great Southern Forest; Henpecked Hou, on the run from his wife; Sky, who was freeing slaves taken by the Lotus Assassins; and Kang the Mad, who was held captive by Gao the Greater. They are also first attacked and then aided by Silk Fox, who is determined to topple Death&#x27;s Hand.

Using Kang&#x27;s special airship, the party travels to the Imperial Capital, where Silk Fox meets them in her true role as Princess Sun Lian, Emperor Sun Hai&#x27;s daughter. While in the Capital, the Spirit Monk gains access to the Lotus Assassins&#x27; ranks by competing in a local fighting tournament. Once among the Lotus Assassins, they dismantle them from within before retrieving the final amulet fragment from Grand Inquisitor Jia. Death&#x27;s Hand then attacks, but Sagacious Zu sacrifices himself to collapse the Lotus Assassin base on Death&#x27;s Hand. Led by Silk Fox, the group then infiltrate Sun Hai&#x27;s palace, confronting the Emperor as he interrogates Master Li and finding him withered through using the Water Dragon&#x27;s stolen power. After the Emperor&#x27;s defeat, Master Li kills the Spirit Monk and steals both the completed amulet and the Water Dragon&#x27;s power, setting himself up as the new Emperor.

The Spirit Monk is guided back to the living world by the Water Dragon and the ghost of Dirge&#x27;s abbot, who reveals that Sun Li had conspired with his brother Sun Kin to seize the Water Dragon&#x27;s power and kill Sun Hai after taking Dirge. The brothers&#x27; plot failed as the Water Dragon&#x27;s power made Hai immortal. Kin was killed, while Li escaped and killed the Spirit Monk&#x27;s rescuer, taking the child to mold into a weapon against Hai. Death&#x27;s Hand was created by the Emperor by binding Kin&#x27;s spirit to Li&#x27;s armor. Returning to life in Dirge, the Spirit Monk reunites with their companions and holds off a vast assault from Li, who also sensed their return. In their final confrontation with Death&#x27;s Hand, the Spirit Monk can either free or enslave Sun Kin&#x27;s spirit. Infiltrating the Imperial Capital, the Spirit Monk&#x27;s party fights their way through the palace and discovers the Water Dragon&#x27;s body, torn open and preserved in a state between life and death to provide endless water to the Jade Empire. The Spirit Monk then goes to confront Li.

Depending on the player&#x27;s choices at these points, one of several endings plays out. If the Spirit Monk surrenders to Li, they are remembered as a hero who knew their place, as the Empire becomes an oppressive dystopia. If the Water Dragon&#x27;s body is further corrupted by the Spirit Monk, then they usurp Li&#x27;s stolen power and emerge as the next Emperor following his death. If the Spirit Monk destroys the Water Dragon&#x27;s body, then her spirit is freed, and the dead are able to find their way into the underworld, causing the people to rejoice and hail the Spirit Monk as a hero of the Jade Empire.

==Development==
===Basic concept===
&quot;Jade Empire&quot; was developed by BioWare, after it earned critical and commercial success with &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;, &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&quot;, RPGs based on pre-existing &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; fictional universes. The game, which began development in May 2001, was the company&#x27;s first original RPG intellectual property. The concept of &quot;Jade Empire&quot; had existed with company founders co-founders Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk since they started BioWare alongside the plan that would lead to &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;; called a &quot;dream project&quot;, their aim was to fulfill player fantasies of becoming a powerful martial arts master. The game was first developed and released for the Xbox. Zeschuk later felt they should have held the game back and developed it for the console&#x27;s successor the Xbox 360. Around 105 people were working on the game full-time.

===Design===
Art director Matt Goldman took inspiration from multiple eras of China&#x27;s history when designing various aspects of the world, focusing between the Han and Ming dynasties. The environments were modeled on landscape artwork from the Song dynasty, while the color palette drew from the green-hued art of the Tang dynasty. For ancient artifacts based in an ancient civilization, Goldman drew inspiration from bronze artifacts dating from the Shang and Zhou periods. The wild areas were directly inspired by the Huangshan region. Different regions of the game were designed to reflect the differing social classes present in the Jade Empire. In addition to its Chinese inspiration, Goldman drew styling elements for both clothing and scenery from Japan, Thailand, Tibet, the Khmer Empire, and unspecified areas of South and West Asia. The monsters, while taking inspiration from brief descriptions in Asian literature, were mostly original creations for the game&#x27;s world. Speaking of his experience on the game years later, Goldman described &quot;fond memories&quot; of the Canada-based development team working to create an Asian epic.

Creating the new combat system was one of the biggest challenges when developing the gameplay systems. Rather than the rule and turn-based combat of their earlier titles, the team wanted combat in &quot;Jade Empire&quot; to be in real-time, as the slower turn-based combat of their earlier works did not fit into its planned setting. The game&#x27;s martial arts were based on a variety of real-life styles, including karate, aikido and capoeira. Implementing the combat system required creating a number of systems to handle combat without relying on pre-programmed fight choreography. A key element of the design was that managing character statistics was kept low-key so as not to interfere with the player&#x27;s experience. The Dragonfly mini-game was designed by assistant producer Sheldon Carter. Carter based the mini-game on classic arcade top-down shooters such as &quot;Xevious&quot; and &quot;1942&quot;.

Based on their experience with &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot;, the team developed &quot;Jade Empire&quot; using a new graphics engine. As part of the lighting system, the team used rim lighting to pick out the edges of characters and illuminate them using a local light source, creating a dynamic lighting effect to make characters look alive. A form of pixel flare, in which pixels reflect more light in bright conditions, was used to the same effect for areas in bright sunlight or the unrealistic lighting of parts of Heaven. The user interface, map and journal systems were all improved based on those used in &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot; to promote player comfort. The game was the first BioWare game to use motion capture for all human elements, contrasting with their work on &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot;, which was done using hand animation. The use of motion capture was intended to promote a sense of realism. The decision to use motion capture was influenced by the large number of animations required for combat actions. For several enemy characters, the staff used hand animation. When creating the prototype &quot;Deo&quot; fighting style, lead animator Deo Perez drew inspiration from a number of martial arts masters from movies including Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh. Further refinement was done by the motion capture actors. Each style was based on a single real-life martial arts style.

===Writing===
While their previous work on other licenses had been described as &quot;fun&quot; experiences, BioWare staff were keen to work on an original world and storyline without any creative restrictions. The team quickly decided not to set the game in historical China, wanting the freedom to include fantasy elements, leading to them creating a world based on Chinese mythology. According to lead writers Luke Kristjanson and Mike Laidlaw, they used its inspiration to create a world that felt alive, with a variety of locals and social norms coexisting. Like BioWare&#x27;s previous RPGs, its main focus was on telling a story, but a lot of the additional lore and finer detail was made optional so players would feel a degree of freedom in how they explored the story. Dialogue was intended to blend BioWare&#x27;s established writing style with the game&#x27;s Eastern influences. The game&#x27;s morality system was designed to be an evolution and refinement of that used in &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot;. The menu-based dialogue choice system was carried over directly from &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot;.

The inspirations for the game&#x27;s plot included the Classic Chinese Novels &quot;Outlaws of the Marsh&quot;, &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; and &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, in addition to &quot;Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio&quot; and more recent works such as &quot;The Deer and the Cauldron&quot;, &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; and &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot;. They also drew inspiration from Wuxia and samurai movies including &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;, &quot;Fist of Legend&quot;, &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;, &quot;Hero&quot;, &quot;Shaolin Dolemite&quot; and &quot;The Five Fingers of Death&quot;. The character Black Whirlwind was a homage by Laidlaw to Li Kui, a main character from &quot;Outlaws of the Marsh&quot;. Henpecked Hou followed a tradition in BioWare titles of including a character for comic relief, in addition to playing on Chinese narrative stereotypes. A notable side character is Sir Roderick Ponce Von Fontlebottom the Magnificent Bastard, a musket-wielding explorer from a foreign land used for comic relief. The character was generally influenced by the explorers of Medieval Europe who had historically been to China.

While much of the script is in English, many characters in the game speak Tho Fan, a 2,500-word Asian-style constructed language translated for players using English subtitles. Similar to the development of the Elvish languages for &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Tho Fan was developed to add to the personality, realism and immersion of to the setting of &quot;Jade Empire&quot;. The team chose not to use a real-world Asian language as &quot;Jade Empire&quot; was set in a fantasy world despite its Asian influence, with Tho Fan being used to add a level of exoticism for players. To create Tho Fan, BioWare contacted the linguistics department of the nearby University of Alberta; one of those who responded was Wolf Wikeley, then a student at the University with a master&#x27;s degree in psycholinguistics and a candidate for a PhD in phonology. When Wikeley—a fan of Japanese anime and video games—was interviewed, he spoke several sentences in fluent fictional languages from various films and TV shows, impressing the BioWare staff and earning him the job.

The language, according to Wikeley, relies on soft sounds and most closely resembles Mongolian. When planning the new language, Wikeley asked the developers what temperament the people of the Jade Empire had, as it would impact the sound and delivery of the words. After this is worked on creating a basic dictionary based on word substitution, although some words were inside jokes such as &quot;wankaawayi&quot; (director), which referenced Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-wai. Once the dictionary was complete, Wikeley set about creating unique grammar and language rules, such as the verb &quot;to be&quot; not existing, so it would not make the typical mistake of fictional languages of following the rules of a real language. Initially intended to be a lower class language denoting humility, a late change to the plot made Tho Fan a language of the Jade Empire&#x27;s elite, turning its &quot;deferential softness&quot; into a mark of elegance.

===Audio===

The musical score of &quot;Jade Empire&quot; was composed by Jack Wall, who had previously worked on &quot;Myst III: Exile&quot; and its sequel. Wall was first approached by an audio manager at BioWare, with Wall later sending a demo tape, then later created a piece used in the game&#x27;s first trailer. Wall decided to pursue the job because of his liking for BioWare&#x27;s previous games, and accredited the trailer music with successfully getting the job of composer. Wall worked on the game from January 2004 to February 2005, coming in during the game&#x27;s early development. From an early stage, Wall decided to create an orchestral rather than synthetic soundtrack, aiming for an &quot;East meets West&quot; aesthetic. A key member of staff whom Wall hired early on was Zhiming Han, a Chinese music consultant who was instrumental in maintaining the authentic sound of the score. Zhiming brought in several native Chinese musicians to perform the score, and helped by translating Wall&#x27;s score into Chinese musical notation for the performers. The score was intended to feel generally Asian, incorporating traditional Chinese and Japanese percussion and wind instruments. Wall estimated that he composed over 90 minutes of music, ranging from environmental to cutscene-specific tracks, not including additional arrangements for shorter cutscenes by BioWare staff. A soundtrack album was released in 2005.

Every line of dialogue in the game, both English and Tho Fan, was fully voiced; Zeschuk and Martens estimated in different interviews that the recorded script came to over 320,000 words. The character of Dawn Star had 20,000 lines dedicated to her. One of the notable cast members was Nathan Fillion, whose role as Gao the Lesser was one of his earliest video game acting jobs. According to him, the script was written in a style he compared to broken English. When he talked with other actors on the project after the game was completed, he realized that they had rewritten the script into conventional English. He stated in 2017 that he would enjoy redoing those lines so they were easier to understand. Another notable cast member was British actor John Cleese, who voiced Sir Roderick Ponce Von Fontlebottom. Cleese became involved due to him and his agent being in Canada at the time voice recording was taking place. Upon being approached, Cleese was willing, and recorded all the character&#x27;s lines during a single afternoon.

==Release==
First hinted at in 2002 when BioWare announced a further partnership with Microsoft Game Studios following &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot;, the game was officially announced in September 2003, with further information being revealed at that year&#x27;s Tokyo Game Show. Originally scheduled for release in March 2005, the game was pushed forward to April of that year. Along with the standard edition, a limited edition was produced that included an additional male playable character with unique combat abilities, and a special DVD detailing the production of multiple Xbox titles including &quot;Jade Empire&quot;. The limited edition was designed as a gift for those who pre-ordered the game, and was developed in parallel to the standard game. By February, the game had entered the final stages of production, with staff focusing on polishing work. The game released on April 12, 2005, two days prior to its announced release date. The game was later released in Europe on April 22, and in Australia on June 30. The limited edition, exclusive to North America and Europe, released alongside the standard edition. In Japan, the game was released on June 16 under the title &quot;Jade Empire: Hisui no Teikoku&quot;.

=== &quot;Jade Empire: Special Edition&quot; ===
A version for Microsoft Windows personal computers (PC) began development at BioWare due to demand from their strong PC-based community. While developing the port, BioWare upgraded hundreds of different textures by hand; additional content including new fighting styles, new enemies, and the seventh character previously available in the Limited Edition of the Xbox version; refined the enemy and followers&#x27; artificial intelligence and reworked the controls for a keyboard and mouse. While the team had the option of publishing the title through Microsoft Game Studio, Microsoft were focused on developing games for Windows Vista alone, which clashed with BioWare&#x27;s wishes to make the game available to a wide audience. For this reason, the team developed the PC version themselves and sought out a different publisher.

The PC version was first announced at the 2006 Electronic Entertainment Expo. Unlike the Xbox version, the PC version was published by 2K. The game went gold in February 2007, shortly before its North American release. The game released on February 27, 2007 in North America. It later released on March 2 in Europe and Australia. The downloadable version was released through Steam and BioWare&#x27;s online store on February 28. It later released through GOG.com on June 11, 2013. A port of &quot;Special Edition&quot; for macOS was developed and published by TransGaming on August 18, 2008. Later ports for iOS and Android were developed and published by Aspyr respectively on October 6 and November 15, 2016.

== Reception ==
===Critical reviews===
&quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; spoke highly of the game, saying that the game&#x27;s accessibility would attract those introduced to BioWare&#x27;s &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot;, calling &quot;Jade Empire&quot; &quot;imaginative, accessible, beautiful to look at and incredibly immersive to play&quot;. Rob Fahey of Eurogamer praised the aesthetics and replay value, but noted that the combat&#x27;s lack of depth and limited customization options would be negatively viewed by some players. GameSpot&#x27;s Greg Kasavin was positive overall, his only complaints being issues with combat balance and the game&#x27;s short length. Will Tuttle of GameSpy lauded every aspect of the game, calling it &quot;the best [RPG] to ever hit the Xbox&quot;. IGN&#x27;s David Clayman was again highly positive, noting only camera difficulties that distracted from the flow of combat. Luke van Leuveran of &quot;PALGN&quot; called &quot;Jade Empire&quot; &quot;an amazing action RPG&quot;, praising its story and combat system. Reviews of the Xbox version were positive overall, with the graphics and storyline coming in for the majority of praise. While the gameplay was seen as solid, its simplicity was frequently criticized.

Suzy Wallace of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; felt that the &quot;Special Edition&quot; managed to reach beyond its roots on the Xbox to become a good-quality RPG for PCs, despite dated graphics and gameplay pacing issues. Fahay, returning to review the PC port, was disappointed at the lack of graphical polish and technical upgrades over its console counterpart. GameSpot&#x27;s Kevin VanOrd shared points of praise and criticism with the Xbox review, while also noting that the PC version had few noticeable enhancements over the Xbox version. GameSpy&#x27;s Allen Rausch enjoyed the storyline and gameplay, but noted the game&#x27;s &quot;grainy&quot; cutscenes and some technical issues. Steve Butts, writing for IGN, generally enjoyed the game but found the combat repetitive and noted a lack of new content. Niel Booth, reviewing for &quot;PALGN&quot;, said that the game was enjoyable despite graphical and technical issues he raised. While sentiments towards the story and gameplay remained unchanged for the PC version, people noted that the original gameplay faults were heightened by the PC controls and that the graphics looked dated by modern gaming standards.

Later responses have continued to be positive. In 2010, the game was included in the book &quot;1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die&quot;. In a 2015 article, Mike Williams of USgamer said, &quot;&quot;Jade Empire&quot; was such a unique game for BioWare, but it&#x27;s one the studio never followed up on.&quot;

During the 9th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences awarded &quot;Jade Empire&quot; with &quot;Role-Playing Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Character Performance - Female&quot; (Kim Mai Guest as Dawn Star), as well as nominations for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction&quot;, &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Original Musical Composition&quot;, and &quot;Outstanding Character Performance - Male&quot;.

===Sales===
Upon its release, &quot;Jade Empire&quot; debuted at #3 on The NPD Group&#x27;s video game sales chart for the month of April 2005. Writing for GameSpot, Tor Thorsen noted that its third-place finish came &quot;despite [its] being released in the middle of April&quot;. It also secured second place on that month&#x27;s Xbox chart, behind the debut of &quot;Doom 3&quot; on the platform. In May, the game fell to last place on NPD&#x27;s multiplatform top 20, and to seventh in the Xbox rankings. It was absent from both lists by the following month. According to NPD, the game&#x27;s North American sales surpassed 385,000 units by May 2006.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;Jade Empire&quot; debuted at #7 on Chart-Track&#x27;s multiplatform sales list for the week ending April 23. David Jenkins of Gamasutra called this &quot;an unremarkable opening&quot;, and suggested that its sales had been damaged by competition from the newly released &quot;Unreal Championship 2&quot;. It fell to 12th place in its second week, and to 20th in its third. IGN&#x27;s staff wrote of this decline, &quot;The Bioware-developed game has been well reviewed over the past month, but that hasn&#x27;t helped it from rapidly dropping down the charts.&quot; It was absent from Chart-Track&#x27;s multiplatform top 40 by its fourth week of release. Conversely, on the firm&#x27;s sales list for Xbox games, &quot;Jade Empire&quot; opened in first place and held the position for its debut 14 days. It fell to #5 in its third week, but remained in the top 10 until the week ending June 18. By the end of 2005, &quot;Jade Empire&quot;″s sales totaled 45,000 copies in the United Kingdom, a performance characterized as substandard by Eurogamer&#x27;s Kristan Reed.

As of July 2005, sales of &quot;Jade Empire&quot; had reached 500,000 units. BioWare&#x27;s Greg Zeschuk later lamented the decision to release the game for Xbox, rather than as an Xbox 360 launch title. Speaking in 2013, he noted that &quot;game sales are down [right now] because people are waiting for new consoles, and we released &quot;Jade Empire&quot; into that kind of window.&quot; Zeschuck concluded that &quot;it would&#x27;ve been great to put off a bit and polish the game a bit more.&quot;

== Legacy ==
The decision to focus on both &quot;Jade Empire&quot; and their fantasy-themed &quot;Dragon Age: Origins&quot; resulted in BioWare passing over developing a sequel to &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot;. The sequel, titled &quot;Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords&quot;, was given to Obsidian Entertainment. Alongside his work on &quot;Jade Empire&quot;, Wikeley also created four different constructed languages for the &quot;Dragon Age&quot; series. Wall would also work with BioWare again on &quot;Mass Effect&quot; and its sequel.

In January 2007, BioWare staff announced there were no plans to develop &quot;Jade Empire 2&quot;. However, BioWare co-founders Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk stated in September 2011: &quot;It&#x27;s an IP, it&#x27;s a setting that we were really passionate about, and we still are. Both Greg and I were big believers in the IP... We&#x27;re just looking for the right way to deploy it.&quot; In 2009, GamesRadar included &quot;Jade Empire&quot; among the games &quot;with untapped franchise potential&quot;, commenting: &quot;The original game had all the trappings of franchise material with engrossing characters, magnificent settings, and a unique take on martial arts-fueled RPG combat. But until hard evidence of a sequel&#x27;s existence materializes, we&#x27;ll continue yearning for BioWare&#x27;s one-off hit to attain franchise status.&quot;

Dakota Grabowski of GameZone listed Silk Fox and Death&#x27;s Hand as #10 and #8 on their list of top ten BioWare created squadmates respectively. Kimberley Wallace of &quot;Game Informer&quot; included Wild Flower in her list of best BioWare characters; she called her unique among Jade Empire&#x27;s cast of interesting characters and said &quot;part of what makes her such a delight is seeing this child&#x27;s interpretation and perspective on all the complex issues you face and what the spirits are telling her to say. As the journey goes on, it becomes a game of the two disparate perspectives talking through her, but part of the fight is trying to give Wild Flower the freedom and life she deserves.&quot; Jason MacIsaac from &quot;EP Daily&quot; also rated Wild Flower as among nine of the best BioWare characters.

<text>Indaiatuba is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of Campinas. The population is 256,223 (2020 est.) in an area of . The elevation is . The city&#x27;s name derives from the Tupi language. It is an important city in one of Brazil&#x27;s main industrial regions.

Based on the latest IFDM social index data, Indaiatuba ranks number one of the &quot;Top 100 best cities to live in, in Brazil&quot;.

The Federation of Industries of Rio de Janeiro, surveyed data and compared information on education, health, income and employment (including wages and formal job creation) of all the municipalities within the country and, with this data, they have created the Firjan Development Index Municipal (IFDM), which enabled the elaboration of a ranking system of the top 100 best cities to live in Brazil.

Data was collected from the Ministries of Education, Health and Labour for all municipalities.

== History ==

Indaiatuba was established in the late 18th century as a rural neighborhood within the town of Itu. Its location was along a route used for transporting troops and goods, contributing to its growth. The settlement, initially known as Indayatiba, was documented in a 1768 census. The area was also referred to as Cocais due to the abundance of Indaiá palm trees.

In the early 19th century, Indaiatuba was primarily an agricultural region. A significant landmark from this period is the Casarão do Pau Preto, a large house built between 1810 and 1820. The house was part of a sugar plantation and later a coffee plantation, reflecting the agricultural activity of the time.

The establishment of a chapel allowed Indaiatuba to become a local civic center. The chapel, which later became the Igreja Matriz de Nossa Senhora da Candelária, is one of the few remaining colonial-era religious buildings made of rammed earth in São Paulo. The area around the chapel developed into a town square, Largo da Candelária, which was the heart of the community.

Indaiatuba gained political autonomy from Itu in 1859 when it was elevated to the status of a village. This led to the establishment of its own Câmara de Vereadores (town council).

The arrival of the railroad in the late 19th century significantly changed Indaiatuba&#x27;s urban landscape. The railroad connected the town to São Paulo, facilitating the movement of people and goods. It also led to the arrival of immigrants from various countries, who primarily engaged in agriculture and contributed to the town&#x27;s economic development.

With the beginning of the Republican period in Brazil, Indaiatuba&#x27;s civic center shifted to the Largo da Cadeia (currently called Praça Prudente de Moraes). The square housed important civic buildings, including the Câmara, the Cadeia (jail), and the Prefeitura (city hall).

The mid-20th century saw a period of modernization and growth in Indaiatuba. The town&#x27;s economy diversified into various agricultural products and industries. The population doubled between 1954 and 1964, accompanied by the establishment of various businesses and public services.

Indaiatuba&#x27;s urban development was guided by a grid plan in the 19th century, which is still preserved in its historic center. In the 1960s, the town implemented its first urban plan. Later, in the 1980s, a new plan designed by Ruy Ohtake proposed the creation of the Parque Ecológico as a central element of the town&#x27;s urban expansion.

Indaiatuba has experienced rapid population growth and economic development in recent decades. The town has consistently ranked high in economic growth indices and is well-connected to the surrounding region and the world through modern highways and Viracopos International Airport.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia Telefônica Brasileira until 1973, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cellphones, landlines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

== Transportation ==

Viracopos International Airport is located 10 km from the city of Indaiatuba, with easy access via the SP-75. There are metropolitan bus lines that run this route, leaving from the Indaiatuba Bus Station directly to Viracopos and vice versa.

<doc id="1041934" wikidata="Q4178004" url="?curid=1041934" title="Publicist">
<text>A publicist is a person whose job is to generate and manage publicity for a company, a brand, or public figure – especially a celebrity – or for work or a project such as a book, film, or album. Publicists are public relations specialists who maintain and represent the images of individuals, rather than representing an entire corporation or business. Publicists are also hired by public figures who want to maintain or protect their image. Publicists brand their clients by getting magazine, TV, newspaper, and website coverage. Most top-level publicists work in private practice, handling multiple clients.

The term &quot;publicist&quot; was coined by the legal scholar Francis Lieber to describe the engagement of internationalists with the public during the late nineteenth century. Publicists are sometimes called &quot;flacks&quot;, a term that traces back to Gene Flack, who was a well-known movie publicist in the 1930s.

==Description==
In the world of celebrities, unlike agents or managers, publicists typically take a monthly fee for serving a client (whereas agents and managers tend to take a percentage of their client&#x27;s gross income). Publicists can be on a local, regional, or national level. For example, a small restaurant seeking only local publicity would want a local publicist – whereas an author seeking nationwide visibility would want to search for a national publicist. 

One of the publicist&#x27;s main functions is to generate press coverage on behalf of their clients and serve as the bridge between clients, their public, and media outlets. A publicist manages campaigns and performs other public relations functions. It usually takes many years to develop the media contacts, experience, and relationships necessary to be an effective publicist.

Some publicists specialize in representing ordinary members of the public to procure the maximum possible fee for stories they wish to sell to newspapers, television stations, and magazines. Several publicists have now sprung up on the internet and work as media agents gaining members of the public multiple deals with publications.

==Types of publicists==
* Press representative
* Public relations publicist – manages the public image of a client or a work of art such as a film.
* Special publicity consultant
* Unit publicist – The unit publicist brings attention to the production phase of making a film or other work of art by organizing media kits, sending out press releases, and arranging media visits to the production.
* Media agent – liaises between the ordinary person (interviewee) and publications or TV to &#x27;sell&#x27; their story.

== Role of publicists ==
The main role of publicists is to get good press coverage for their clients. One way that publicists can do this is by sending press releases to journalists. A press release is written like a news story; including a headline, and attention grabbing quotes. However, because of the high traffic of e-mails, today, many press releases sent by publicists are lost within the other e-mails that journalists receive.

Publicists tend to have good working relationships with journalists, TV news producers, and producers. In order to have these relationships, publicists usually network with these media professionals. To protect a client&#x27;s image, publicists will often ask journalists what questions will be asked during interviews to prevent any surprises and discussion of any unwanted topics.

Publicists determine how to manage a person&#x27;s or brand&#x27;s image by what is being said about them in the media. This pertains to websites and social media. More recently, publicists have the need to network with bloggers and scope out their websites to make sure the content on their client is appropriate. Celebrity publicists usually schedule their client&#x27;s press tours, which includes everything from making the travel arrangements and locations.

A typical day for a publicist consists of being on the phone, networking through e-mails, and can make themselves available at all times of the day for when conflict arises. Out of the office, publicists go to gatherings to network with media professionals.

== Skills used ==
Publicists are usually skilled writers, as well as motivated to promote individuals. Furthermore, publicists need to be able to handle the stress associated with crisis. For example, if a client is arrested for a DUI, they need to release press coverage with details explaining how the client will resolve the situation. In terms of education, publicists will often major in communications, journalism, or public relations in college. When starting out as a publicist, one will have to work their way up in regards to position. Usually, it is helpful that aspiring publicists intern at a public relations firm while at college to gain experience. Schools that offer communication and public relations degrees consist of Ashford University, Colorado Technical University, Seton Hall University, American University, and the University of Florida.

==Publicists in the Hollywood industry==
Hollywood publicists create and manage relationships between film stars and the array of other media channels through which the identities of stars are circulated. Stars have a dual relationship with publicity, for they publicize films but also, and importantly in the freelance market, have an interest in self publicity. It is for the latter reason that while many stars continue to regard managers as an optional luxury, today the majority of stars in Hollywood hire publicists to manage their media visibility. In other words, celebrities hire publicists who will be able to get their name out to the public preferably in a positive light.

Compared to channels of paid advertising, publicity generates exposure which is relatively &quot;free&quot;. Publicity is at work whenever stars make personal appearances at press conferences or film premieres, give television interviews, are displayed on magazine covers, or allow the press to cover a private event. Independent publicists include Hollywood stars and studios as their clients, alongside corporations and individuals from the worlds of entertainment, sports, finance, technology, retailing, and other business sectors.

The role of a publicist in Hollywood has changed and has become more challenging in recent years. With the enormous increase of entertainment news outlets such as Perez Hilton, TMZ, and Page Six, it has become much more difficult for publicists to control negative stories. Publicists must also work much harder to keep some of their star clients relevant in the media with the entertainment options in Hollywood continuously growing. Even booking a star for an interview or on a television talk show has become a challenging task, because if something goes awry, the publicist and the star could both be highly criticized by the media.

== Salary ==
The average salary for a publicist in the United States is about $45,000 per year. However, celebrity publicists&#x27; salaries can vary depending on the clientele they cater to.

=== Salaries for corporate PR specialists by experience ===
* Entry level (0–5 years): $29,029–57,737
* Mid-career (5–10 years): $35,818–76,758
* Experienced (10–20 years): $35,372–96,507
* Late career (20 years+): $34,786–154,954

<doc id="1041935" wikidata="Q1201531" url="?curid=1041935" title="Detroit Diesel">
<text>Detroit Diesel Corporation (DDC) is an American diesel engine manufacturer headquartered in Detroit, Michigan. It is a subsidiary of Daimler Truck North America, which is itself a wholly owned subsidiary of the multinational Daimler Truck AG. The company manufactures heavy-duty engines and chassis components for the on-highway and vocational commercial truck markets. Detroit Diesel has built more than 5 million engines since 1938, more than 1 million of which are still in operation worldwide. Detroit Diesel&#x27;s product line includes engines, axles, transmissions, and a Virtual Technician service.

Detroit engines, transmissions, and axles are used in several models of truck manufactured by Daimler Truck North America.

==Divisions==
Detroit Diesel consists of manufacturing operations of axles, transmissions and diesel engines for on-highway only, which is owned by Daimler Truck AG. The former off-highway division was sold to MTU Friedrichshafen in 2006 and subsequently purchased by Rolls-Royce in 2014.

==Detroit Diesel Corporation timeline==
The ancestor of Detroit Diesel was the Winton Engine Company, founded by Alexander Winton in 1912; Winton Engine began producing diesel engines in fall 1913. After Charles F. Kettering purchased two Winton diesels for his yacht, General Motors acquired the company in 1930 along with Electro Motive Company, Winton&#x27;s primary client. Research initiated by Kettering led to the development and release of the EMD 567 locomotive engine in the late 1930s; a smaller engine using a similar two-stroke design was developed by engineers at GM Research, which led to the first 6-71, manufactured in 1938.

===Origins===
* January 1938: General Motors began diesel engine manufacturing in Detroit under the Detroit Diesel Engine Division, and re-organized its Winton Engine Corporation as the Cleveland Diesel Engine Division. Cleveland Diesel produced larger diesel engines for locomotive, marine, and stationary use. Detroit Diesel started production with the smaller mobile Series 71 two-cycle engines that the GM Research Division had recently developed. GM formed the General Motors Diesel Division (GMDD) as a marketing and customer service structure for its Detroit and Cleveland diesel products. 
* 1939: Series 71 engines installed in buses manufactured by Yellow Coach (acquired by GM in 1943).
* World War II: Tanks, landing craft, road building equipment and standby generators needed compact, lightweight, two-cycle engines. By 1943, Detroit Diesel employed 4,300 people, more than 1,400 of them women. Together, these employees produced 57,892 engines in 1943. Detroit Diesel launches Series 110 engines used in construction equipment, rail cars, and power generation.
* 1945: Detroit Diesel Engine Division begins marketing the Series 71 for marine applications, taking over from the Gray Marine Motor Company, which had been assembling marinized versions since 1938.

===Postwar expansion===
* 1950s: Wide use of GM&#x27;s Detroit Diesel engines in military applications aided their acceptance in commercial applications. Detroit Diesel developed heavy-duty engines for long-distance trucks. GMDD began to develop a worldwide distribution network of independent, authorized distributors and dealers to provide parts and service for Detroit and Cleveland Diesel products. 
* 1957: Detroit Diesel introduced the Series 53 engine, and put the Series 71 engine into use for both on-highway and off-road use. All engines within a Series were designed so that a vast majority of parts were interchangeable, facilitating production of many models of various horsepower by adding cylinders.
* 1960 and after: For the next 20 years, the Detroit Diesel and Allison Divisions grew, tripling sales during the 1960s alone. In 1963, Detroit Diesel marked a milestone after the collective horsepower produced by its engines to-date had reached 100 million; by 1967, DD had produced engines producing a collective 150 million horsepower.
* 1962: Production and marketing of remaining Cleveland Diesel products moved to GM&#x27;s Electro-Motive Division, leaving Detroit Diesel Engine Division the remaining partner of GMDD.
* 1965: GMDD structures absorbed into the Detroit Diesel Engine Division, formally ending GMDD as a separate entity. Detroit Diesel introduces the Series 149 engine for use in workboats, push boats, and 100 ton-plus mining trucks.
* 1970: General Motors consolidated Detroit Diesel with the closely allied transmission and Whirlfire-branded gas turbine businesses of the Allison Division, forming the Detroit Diesel-Allison Division.
* 1974: The Series 92 engine was introduced, called the Fuel Squeezers; the 6V-92TT engine achieved fuel savings of 10% to 20% over previous models of comparable horsepower. During the energy crisis, turbine engines became uncompetitive.

===Shift to four-cycle engines and spinoff===
* 1980: Detroit Diesel-Allison produced its first four-cycle engine. A few years later in the early 1980s diesel engine production split off as Detroit Diesel Division while turbine engines remained as Allison Division.
* 1987: The Series 60 — the four-cycle heavy-duty engine for which the company is well known — was introduced. It was the first production engine to have integrated electronic controls as a standard feature. The Series 60 was cleaner and more fuel-efficient than previous heavy-duty engines, and became the biggest selling heavy-duty diesel engine in the North American Class 8 truck market.
* 1988 January 1: A joint venture between Penske Corporation and General Motors created Detroit Diesel Corporation. Penske had a 60% majority ownership in the new venture and the CEO was former racecar driver Roger Penske.
* 1993 October: Detroit Diesel Corporation had grown its on-highway heavy-duty market share to 33% from 3% only a few years earlier. The company also made an initial public offering of common stock, becoming a publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock symbol &quot;DDC&quot;. That same year, Detroit Diesel launched the Series 50, the first Detroit Diesel natural gas engine.
* 1999: Detroit Diesel built its 4 millionth engine.

===DaimlerChrysler===
* 2000: In October 2000, DaimlerChrysler bought Detroit Diesel Corporation.
* 2000: Off-highway engines combined with MTU Friedrichshafen to form MTU America. The on-highway division of Detroit Diesel was retained by DaimlerChrysler (now Daimler AG) as part of Daimler Trucks North America (DTNA).
* 2005: Detroit Diesel Corporation invested $350 million to refurbish and retool its plant for future business.
* 2006: MTU Friedrichshafen, including the off-highway part of Detroit Diesel in the US, was acquired by the EQT AB investment group. A new company, Tognum GmbH, was formed as a holding company for the brands held by Daimler Trucks and MTU Friedrichshafen. Both companies use the &#x27;Detroit Diesel&#x27; name and corporate logo.
* 2007: Detroit Diesel Corporation launches its DD engine platform with the DD15 Engine.
* 2008: Detroit Diesel Corporation was recognized for its Brownfield Redevelopment efforts, and also won the national EPA Phoenix Award for its plant.
* 2009: The 1 millionth Series 60 engine was sold.
* 2010: An additional $190 million investment allowed Detroit Diesel Corporation to launch Blue Tec emissions technology and the final engine of its new engines family: the Detroit DD platform of engines that includes the DD13, DD15, DD15TC, and DD16 engines.
* 2010: Detroit began production of EPA 2010 certified engines.
* 2011: Detroit Diesel Corporation is named one of the two 2011 Michigan Green Leaders in the Big Business category by the Detroit Free Press. DDC changes brand name from Detroit Diesel to Detroit.
* 2012: 100,000th DD platform engine built. DD axles, Virtual Technician, DT12 automated manual transmission and Detroit Genuine Parts are introduced.
* 2013: 75th anniversary.
* 2016: Detroit Diesel agreed to pay U.S.$28.5 million to resolve violations of US federal Clean Air Act. The company sold 7,786 heavy-duty diesel engines, which were assembled approximately 80% complete in 2009, including the crankshaft, block, pistons, and connecting rods. These short block engines were stored temporarily, and the remaining assembly work was completed in early 2010 for use in trucks and buses of in model year 2010. These engines were alleged not to comply with stricter 2010 emission standards. The company believed its practice was allowed under EPA regulations.

==Clean Air Act violations==
In 1998, the EPA announced fines totaling $83.4 million against Detroit Diesel and six other diesel engine manufacturers, the largest fine to date, which evaded testing by shutting down emissions controls during highway driving while appearing to comply with lab testing. The manufacturers also agreed to spend more than $1 billion to correct the problem. The trucks used engine ECU software to engage pollution controls during the 20-minute lab tests to verify compliance with the Clean Air Act, but then disable the emissions controls during normal highway cruising, emitting up to three times the maximum allowed NOx pollution.

In 2016, Detroit Diesel agreed to pay U.S.$28.5 million to resolve violations of the U.S. federal Clean Air Act. The company sold 7,786 heavy-duty diesel engines, which were assembled approximately 80% complete in 2009, including the crankshaft, block, pistons, and connecting rods, the short block engines were stored temporarily and completed the remaining assembly in early 2010 for use in trucks and buses of in model year 2010. These engines were alleged not to comply with stricter 2010 emission standards.

<text>The History of Sephardic Jews in England consists of the Sephardic Jews&#x27; contribution and achievement in England.

Sephardic Jews were Spanish and Portuguese Jews living in the Iberian Peninsula who converted or were forced to convert to Christianity during the Middle Ages, but continued to practice Judaism in secrecy.

==Arrival of Sephardic Jews==
Documents suggest that, although small in number at the time, Sephardic Jews fleeing persecution from the Inquisition developed a small community in London around the late 16th century, largely known from contemporary Spanish and Portuguese sources writing about English Catholic ambassadors&#x27; repeated complaints of Jews from this community meeting to celebrate Passover and Yom Kippur in London. 
Toward the middle of the 17th century a considerable number of Sephardic merchants settled in London and formed there a secret , at the head of which was Antonio Fernandez Carvajal. They conducted a large business with the Levant, East and West Indies, Canary Islands, and Brazil, and above all with the Netherlands, Spain, and Portugal. They formed an important link in the network of trade spread, especially throughout the Spanish and Portuguese world by the Sephardi or secret Jews (see Commerce). Their position enabled them to give Cromwell and his secretary, John Thurloe, important information as to the plans both of Charles Stuart in Holland and of the Spaniards in the New World (see L. Wolf, &quot;Cromwell&#x27;s Secret Intelligencers&quot;). Outwardly they passed as Spaniards and Catholics; but they held prayer-meetings at Creechurch Lane, and became known to the government as Jews by faith.

Creechurch Lane and, later in 1701, the Bevis Marks Synagogue in 1701 become the first Jewish religious places since the Edict of Expulsion of 1290. In the following three centuries, Sephardic Jews communities established near the major European sea ports like Amsterdam and London, helping the &quot;Marranos&quot; who were expelled from the Spanish Inquisition to rise up new merchant activities.

==Puritans call for the Jews&#x27; return==

Meanwhile, public opinion in England had been prepared by the Puritan movement for a sympathetic treatment of any proposal by the Judaizing sects among the extremists of the Parliamentary party for the readmission of the Jews into England. Petitions favouring readmission had been presented to the army as early as 1649 by two Baptists of Amsterdam, Johanna Cartwright and her son Ebenezer (&quot;The Petition of the Jews for the Repealing of the Act of Parliament for Their Banishment out of England&quot;); and suggestions looking to that end were made by men of the type of Roger Williams, Hugh Peters, and by Independents generally. Many were moved in the same direction by mystical Messianic reasons; and their views attracted the enthusiasm of Menasseh Ben Israel, who in 1650 published his &quot;Hope of Israel&quot;, in which he advocated the return as a preliminary to the appearance of the Messiah. The Messiah could not appear till Jews existed in all the lands of the earth. According to Antonio de Montezinos, the Ten Tribes had been discovered in the American Indians of Ecuador, and England was the only country from which Jews were excluded. If England admitted them, the Messianic age might be expected.

==In fiction==

&quot;The Queen&#x27;s Fool&quot;, historical novel by Philippa Gregory, is told from the point of view of a (fictional) Marrano girl living in England at the time of Queen Mary I.

<doc id="1041946" wikidata="Q894350" url="?curid=1041946" title="Bosnian Cyrillic">
<text>Bosnian Cyrillic, widely known as Bosančica, is a variant of the Cyrillic alphabet that originated in medieval Bosnia. The term was coined at the end of the 19th century by Ćiro Truhelka. It was widely used in modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina and the bordering areas of modern-day Croatia (southern and middle Dalmatia and Dubrovnik regions). Its name in Serbo-Croatian is &quot;Bosančica&quot; and &quot;Bosanica&quot; the latter of which might be translated as &quot;Bosnian script&quot;. Serb scholars call it &quot;Serbian script&quot;, &quot;Serbian–Bosnian script&quot;, &quot;Bosnian–Serb Cyrillic&quot;, as part of variant of Serbian Cyrillic and deem the term &quot;bosančica&quot; Austro-Hungarian propaganda. Croat scholars also call it &quot;Croatian script&quot;, &quot;Croatian–Bosnian script&quot;, &quot;Bosnian–Croat Cyrillic&quot;, &quot;harvacko pismo&quot;, &quot;arvatica&quot; or &quot;Western Cyrillic&quot;. For other names of Bosnian Cyrillic, see below.

The use of Bosančica amongst Bosnian Muslims was replaced by Arebica upon the introduction of Islam in Bosnia Eyalet, first amongst the elite, then amongst the wider public. The first book in Bosančica was printed by Frančesko Micalović in 1512 in Venice.

==History and characteristic features==

It is hard to ascertain when the earliest features of a characteristic Bosnian type of Cyrillic script had begun to appear, but paleographers consider the Humac tablet (a tablet written in Bosnian Cyrillic) to be the first document of this type of script and is believed to date from the 10th or 11th century. Bosnian Cyrillic was used continuously until the 18th century, with sporadic usage even taking place in the 20th century.

Historically, Bosnian Cyrillic is prominent in the following areas:

*Passages from the Bible in documents of Bosnian Church adherents, 13th and 15th century.
*Numerous legal and commercial documents (charters, letters, donations) of nobles and royalty from medieval Bosnian state in correspondence with the Republic of Ragusa and various cities in Dalmatia (&quot;e.g.&quot; the Charter of Ban Kulin, beginning in the 12th and 13th centuries, and reaching its peak in the 14th and 15th centuries.
*Tombstone inscriptions on marbles in medieval Bosnia and Herzegovina, chiefly between 11th and 15th centuries.
*Legal documents in central Dalmatia, like the Poljica Statute (1440) and other numerous charters from this area; Poljica and neighbourhood Roman Catholic church books used this alphabet until the late 19th century.
*The &quot;Supetar fragment&quot; from the 12th century was found in Monastery of Saint Peter in the Forest in central Istria, among the stones of a collapsed southern monastery wall. Until the 15th century it was a Benedictine monastery and later a Pauline monastery. This finding could indicate that Bosančica spread all the way to Istria and Kvarner Gulf.
*The Roman Catholic diocese in Omiš had a seminary (called &quot;arvacki šeminarij&quot;, &quot;Croat seminary&quot;) active in the 19th century, in which &quot;arvatica&quot; letters were used.
*Liturgical works (missals, breviaries, lectionaries) of the Roman Catholic Church from Dubrovnik, 15th and 16th century, the most famous of which is a printed breviary from 1512.
*The comprehensive body of Bosnian literature, mainly portion associated with the Franciscan order, from the 16th to mid-18th century and early 19th century. This is by far the most abundant corpus of works written in Bosnian Cyrillic, covering various genres, but belonging to the liturgical literature: numerous polemical tractates in the spirit of the Counter-Reformation, popular tales from the Bible, catechisms, breviaries, historical chronicles, local church histories, religious poetry and didactic works. Among the most important writings of this circle are works of Matija Divković, Stjepan Matijević and Pavao Posilović.
*After the Ottoman conquest, Bosnian Cyrillic was used, along with Arebica, by the Bosnian Muslim nobility, chiefly in correspondence, mainly from the 15th to 17th centuries (hence, the script has also been called &quot;begovica&quot;, &quot;bey&#x27;s script&quot;). Isolated families and individuals could write in it even in the 20th century.

In conclusion, main traits of Bosnian Cyrillic include:

*It was a form of Cyrillic script mainly in use in Bosnia and Herzegovina, central Dalmatia and Dubrovnik.
*Its earliest monuments are from the 11th century, but the golden epoch covered the period from the 14th to 17th centuries. From the late 18th century it rather speedily fell into disuse to be replaced by the Latin script.
*Its primary characteristics (scriptory, morphological, orthographical) show strong connection with the Glagolitic script, unlike the standard Church Slavonic form of Cyrillic script associated with Eastern Orthodox churches.
*It had been in use, in ecclesiastical works, mainly in Bosnian Church and Roman Catholic Church in historical lands of Bosnia, Herzegovina, Dalmatia and Dubrovnik. Also, it was a widespread script in Bosnian Muslim circles, which, however, preferred modified Arabic &quot;aljamiado&quot; script. Serbian Orthodox clergy and adherents used mainly the standard Serbian Cyrillic of the Resava orthography.
*The form of Bosnian Cyrillic has passed through a few phases, so although culturally it is correct to speak about one script, it is evident that features present in Bosnian Franciscan documents in the 1650s differ from the charters from Brač island in Dalmatia in the 1250s.
==Polemics==
The polemic about &quot;ethnic affiliation&quot; of Bosnian Cyrillic started in the 19th century, then reappeared in the mid-1990s. The polemic about attribution and affiliation of Bosnian Cyrillic texts seems to rest on following arguments:

*Serbian scholars claim that it is just a variant of Serbian Cyrillic; actually, a &quot;minuscle&quot;, or Italic (cursive) script devised at the court of Serbian king Stefan Dragutin, and accordingly, include Bosnian Cyrillic texts into the Serbian literary corpus. Authors in &quot;Prilozi za književnost, jezik, istoriju i folklor&quot; in 1956, go as far to state that &quot;Bosančica&quot; was a term introduced through Austro-Hungarian propaganda, and regarded it a type of cursive Cyrillic script, without specifics that would warrant an &quot;isolation from Cyrillic&quot;. The main Serbian authorities in the field are Jorjo Tadić, Vladimir Ćorović, Petar Kolendić, Petar Đorđić, Vera Jerković, Irena Grickat, Pavle Ivić and Aleksandar Mladenović.
*On the Croatian side, the split exists among philologists. One group basically challenges the letters being Serbian, and claims that majority of the most important documents of Bosnian Cyrillic had been written either before any innovations devised at the Serbian royal court happened, or did not have any historical connection with it whatsoever, thus considering Serbian claims on the origin of Bosnian Cyrillic to be unfounded and that the script, since they allege belonging to the Croatian cultural sphere, should be called not Bosnian, but Croatian Cyrillic. Other group of Croatian philologists acknowledges that &quot;Serbian connection&quot;, as exemplified in variants present at the Serbian court of king Dragutin, did influence Bosnian Cyrillic, but, they aver, it was just one strand, since scriptory innovations have been happening both before and after the mentioned one. First group insists that all Bosnian Cyrillic texts belong to the corpus of Croatian literacy, and the second school that all texts from Croatia and only a part from Bosnia and Herzegovina are to be placed into Croatian literary canon, so they exclude c. half of Bosnian Christian texts, but include all Franciscan and the majority of legal and commercial document. Also, the second school generally uses the name &quot;Western Cyrillic&quot; instead of &quot;Croatian Cyrillic&quot; (or Bosnian Cyrillic, for that matter). Both schools allege that supposedly various sources, both Croatian and other European, call this script &quot;Croatian letters&quot; or &quot;Croatian script&quot;. The main Croatian authorities in the field are Vatroslav Jagić, Mate Tentor, Ćiro Truhelka, Vladimir Vrana, Jaroslav Šidak, Herta Kuna, Tomislav Raukar, Eduard Hercigonja and Benedikta Zelić-Bučan.
* Jahić, Halilović, and Palić dismiss claims made by Croatian or Serbian philologists about national affiliation.
*Ivan G. Iliev, in his &quot;Short History of the Cyrillic Alphabet&quot;, summarizes the Cyrillic variant and acknowledges it was spread into and used in both Bosnia and Croatia, where these variants were called &quot;bosančica&quot; or &quot;bosanica&quot; in Bosnian and Croatian (&#x27;Bosnian script&#x27;), with Croats also calling it &quot;arvatica&quot; (&#x27;Croatian script&#x27;) or &quot;Western Cyrillic&quot;.

==Legacy==

In 2015, a group of artists started a project called &quot;I write to you in Bosančica&quot; which involved art and graphic design students from Banja Luka, Sarajevo, Široki Brijeg, and Trebinje. Exhibitions of the submitted artworks will be held in Sarajevo, Trebinje, Široki Brijeg, Zagreb, and Belgrade. The purpose of the project was to resurrect the ancient script and show the &quot;common cultural past&quot; of all the groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The first phase of the project was to reconstruct all of the ancient characters by using ancient, handwritten documents.

==Names==
The name &quot;bosančica&quot; was first used by Fran Kurelac in 1861. Other instances of naming by individuals, in scholarship and literature or publications (chronological order, recent first):&lt;ref name=&quot;Kempgen/Tomelleri-2019-Slavic-Alphabets-Identities&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>MTU Friedrichshafen GmbH, trading as MTU Solutions (stylised as mtu Solutions) is a German manufacturer of commercial internal combustion engines founded by Wilhelm Maybach and his son Karl Maybach in 1909. Wilhelm Maybach was the technical director of Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft (DMG), a predecessor company of the German multinational automotive corporation Daimler AG, until he left in 1907. On 23 March 1909, he founded the new company, Luftfahrzeug-Motorenbau GmbH (Aircraft Engine Manufacturing Corp), with his son Karl Maybach as director. A few years later the company was renamed to Maybach-Motorenbau GmbH (Maybach Engine Manufacturing Corp), which originally developed and manufactured diesel and petrol engines for Zeppelins, and then railcars. The Maybach Mb.IVa was used in aircraft and airships of World War I.

The company first built an experimental car in 1919, with the first production model introduced two years later at the Berlin Motor Show. Between 1921 and 1940, the company produced various classic opulent vehicles. The company also continued to build heavy duty diesel engines for marine and rail purposes. During World War II, Maybach produced the engines for Germany&#x27;s medium and heavy tanks. The company was renamed MTU Friedrichshafen in the 1960s and continued to supply the engines for the Leopard 2 main battle tank. In 1966 MTU merged with Mercedes-Benz Motorenbau.

MTU derives from meaning &#x27;Motor (Engine) and Turbine Union&#x27;.

MTU Friedrichshafen remained a subsidiary of DaimlerChrysler until 2006 when it was sold off to the EQT IV private equity fund, becoming a part of the Tognum Corporation.

Rolls-Royce Holdings and Daimler AG acquired Tognum in 2011. In 2014, Tognum was renamed Rolls-Royce Power Systems, having become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rolls-Royce Holdings.

The company manufactures diesel engines for trains, ships, oil and gas installations, military vehicles, agriculture, mining and construction equipment, as well as diesel generators and molten carbonate fuel cells.

<text>Project 25 (P25 or APCO-25) is a suite of standards for interoperable digital two-way radio products. P25 was developed by public safety professionals in North America and has gained acceptance for public safety, security, public service, and commercial applications worldwide. P25 radios are a direct replacement for analog UHF (typically FM) radios, adding the ability to transfer data as well as voice for more natural implementations of encryption and text messaging. P25 radios are commonly implemented by dispatch organizations, such as police, fire, ambulance and emergency rescue service, using vehicle-mounted radios combined with repeaters and handheld walkie-talkie use.

Starting around 2012, products became available with the newer phase 2 modulation protocol, the older protocol known as P25 became P25 phase 1. P25 phase 2 products use the more advanced AMBE2+ vocoder, which allows audio to pass through a more compressed bitstream and provides two TDMA voice channels in the same RF bandwidth (12.5 kHz), while phase 1 can provide only one voice channel. The two protocols are not compatible. However, P25 Phase 2 infrastructure can provide a &quot;dynamic transcoder&quot; feature that translates between Phase 1 and Phase 2 as needed. In addition to this, phase 2 radios are backwards compatible with phase 1 modulation and analog FM modulation, per the standard. The European Union has created the Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA) and Digital mobile radio (DMR) protocol standards, which fill a similar role to Project 25.

== Suite of standards overview ==

===History===
Public safety radios have been upgraded from analog FM to digital since the 1990s because of an increased use of data on radio systems for such features as GPS location, trunking, text messaging, metering, and encryption.

Various user protocols and different public safety radio spectrum made it difficult for Public Safety agencies to achieve interoperability and widespread acceptance. However, lessons learned during disasters the United States faced in the past decades have forced agencies to assess their requirements during a disaster when basic infrastructure has failed. To meet the growing demands of public safety digital radio communication, the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) at the direction of the United States Congress initiated a 1988 inquiry for recommendations from users and manufacturers to improve existing communication systems. Based on the recommendations, to find solutions that best serve the needs of public safety management, in October 1989 APCO Project 25 came into existence in a coalition with:
* Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-International (APCO)
* National Association of State Telecommunications Directors (NASTD)
* National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)
* National Communications System (NCS)
* National Security Agency (NSA)
* Department of Defense (DoD)

A steering committee consisting of representatives from the above-mentioned agencies along with FPIC (Department of Homeland Security Federal Partnership for Interoperable Communication), Coast Guard and the Department of Commerce&#x27;s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Office of Law Enforcement Standards was established to decide the priorities and scope of technical development of P25.

===Introduction===
Interoperable emergency communication is integral to initial response, public health, community safety, national security and economic stability. Of all the problems experienced during disaster events, one of the most serious is poor communication due to lack of appropriate and efficient means to collect, process, and transmit important information in a timely fashion. In some cases, radio communication systems are incompatible and inoperable not just within a jurisdiction but within departments or agencies in the same community. Non-operability occurs due to use of outdated equipment, limited availability of radio frequencies, isolated or independent planning, lack of coordination, and cooperation, between agencies, community priorities competing for resources, funding and ownership, and control of communications systems. Recognizing and understanding this need, Project 25 (P25) was initiated collaboratively by public safety agencies and manufacturers to address the issue with emergency communication systems. P25 is a collaborative project to ensure that two-way radios are interoperable. The goal of P25 is to enable public safety responders to communicate with each other and, thus, achieve enhanced coordination, timely response, and efficient and effective use of communications equipment.

P25 was established to address the need for common digital public safety radio communications standards for first-responders and homeland security/emergency response professionals. The Telecommunications Industry Association&#x27;s TR-8 engineering committee facilitates such work through its role as an ANSI-accredited standards development organization (SDO) and has published the P25 suite of standards as the TIA-102 series of documents, which now include 49 separate parts on Land Mobile Radio and TDMA implementations of the technology for public safety.

P25-compliant systems are being increasingly adopted and deployed throughout the United States, as well as other countries. Radios can communicate in analog mode with legacy radios, and in either digital or analog mode with other P25 radios. Additionally, the deployment of P25-compliant systems will allow for a high degree of equipment interoperability and compatibility.

P25 standards use the proprietary Improved Multi-Band Excitation (IMBE) and Advanced Multi-Band Excitation (AMBE+2) voice codecs which were designed by Digital Voice Systems, Inc. to encode/decode the analog audio signals. It is rumored that the licensing cost for the voice-codecs that are used in P25 standard devices is the main reason that the cost of P25 compatible devices is so high.

P25 may be used in &quot;talk around&quot; mode without any intervening equipment between two radios, in conventional mode where two radios communicate through a repeater or base station without trunking or in a trunked mode where traffic is automatically assigned to one or more voice channels by a Repeater or Base Station.

The protocol supports the use of Data Encryption Standard (DES) encryption (56 bit), 2-key Triple-DES encryption, three-key Triple-DES encryption, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption at up to 256 bits keylength, RC4 (40 bits, sold by Motorola as &quot;Advanced Digital Privacy&quot;), or no encryption.

The protocol also supports the ACCORDION 1.3, BATON, Firefly, MAYFLY and SAVILLE Type 1 ciphers.

=== P25 open interfaces ===
P25&#x27;s Suite of Standards specify eight open interfaces between the various components of a land mobile radio system. These interfaces are:

* Common Air Interface (CAI) – standard specifies the type and content of signals transmitted by compliant radios. One radio using CAI should be able to communicate with any other CAI radio, regardless of manufacturer
* Subscriber Data Peripheral Interface – standard specifies the port through which mobiles and portables can connect to laptops or data networks
* Fixed Station Interface – standard specifies a set of mandatory messages supporting digital voice, data, encryption and telephone interconnect necessary for communication between a Fixed Station and P25 RF Subsystem
* Console Subsystem Interface – standard specifies the basic messaging to interface a console subsystem to a P25 RF Subsystem
* Network Management Interface – standard specifies a single network management scheme which will allow all network elements of the RF subsystem to be managed
* Data Network Interface – standard specifies the RF Subsystem&#x27;s connections to computers, data networks, or external data sources
* Telephone Interconnect Interface – standard specifies the interface to Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) supporting both analog and ISDN telephone interfaces.
* Inter RF Subsystem Interface (ISSI) – standard specifies the interface between RF subsystems which will allow them to be connected into wide area networks

=== P25 phases ===

P25-compliant technology has been deployed over two main phases with future phases yet to be finalized.

====Phase 1====
Phase 1 radio systems operate in 12.5 kHz digital mode using a single user per channel access method. Phase 1 radios use Continuous 4 level FM (C4FM) modulation—a special type of 4FSK modulation—for digital transmissions at 4,800 baud and 2 bits per symbol, yielding 9,600 bits per second total channel throughput. Of this 9,600, 4,400 is voice data generated by the IMBE codec, 2,800 is forward error correction, and 2,400 is signalling and other control functions. Receivers designed for the C4FM standard can also demodulate the &quot;Compatible quadrature phase shift keying&quot; (CQPSK) standard, as the parameters of the CQPSK signal were chosen to yield the same signal deviation at symbol time as C4FM. Phase 1 uses the IMBE voice codec.

These systems involve standardized service and facility specifications, ensuring that any manufacturers&#x27; compliant subscriber radio has access to the services described in such specifications. Abilities include backward compatibility and interoperability with other systems, across system boundaries, and regardless of system infrastructure. In addition, the P25 suite of standards provides an open interface to the radio frequency (RF) subsystem to facilitate interlinking of different vendors&#x27; systems.

====Phase 2====
To improve spectrum use, P25 Phase 2 was developed for trunking systems using a 2-slot TDMA scheme and is now required for all new trunking systems in the 700 MHz band. Phase 2 uses the AMBE+2 voice codec to reduce the needed bitrate so that one voice channel will only require 6,000 bits per second (including error correction and signalling). Phase 2 is not backwards compatible with Phase 1 (due to the TDMA operation), although multi-mode TDMA radios and systems are capable of operating in Phase 1 mode when required, if enabled. A subscriber radio cannot use TDMA transmission without a synchronization source; therefore direct radio to radio communication resorts to conventional FDMA digital operation. Multi-band subscriber radios can also operate on narrow-band FM as a lowest common denominator between almost any two way radios. This makes analog narrow-band FM the de facto &quot;interoperability&quot; mode for some time.

Originally the implementation of Phase 2 was planned to split the 12.5 kHz channel into two 6.25 kHz slots, or Frequency-Division Multiple Access (FDMA). However it proved more advantageous to use existing 12.5 kHz frequency allocations in Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) mode for a number of reasons. It allowed subscriber radios to save battery life by only transmitting half the time which also yields the ability for the subscriber radio to listen and respond to system requests between transmissions.

Phase 2 is what is known as 6.25 kHz &quot;bandwidth equivalent&quot; which satisfies an FCC requirement for voice transmissions to occupy less bandwidth. Voice traffic on a Phase 2 system transmits with the full 12.5 kHz per frequency allocation, as a Phase 1 system does, however it does so at a faster data rate of 12 kbit/s allowing two simultaneous voice transmissions. As such subscriber radios also transmit with the full 12.5 kHz, but in an on/off repeating fashion resulting in half the transmission and thus an equivalent of 6.25 kHz per each radio. This is accomplished using the AMBE voice coder that uses half the rate of the Phase 1 IMBE voice coders.

====Beyond Phase 2====
From 2000 to 2009, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and TIA were working collaboratively on the Public Safety Partnership Project or Project MESA (Mobility for Emergency and Safety Applications), which sought to define a unified set of requirements for a next-generation aeronautical and terrestrial digital wideband/broadband radio standard that could be used to transmit and receive voice, video, and high-speed data in wide-area, multiple-agency networks deployed by public safety agencies.

The final functional and technical requirements have been released by ETSI and were expected to shape the next phases of American Project 25 and European DMR, dPMR, and TETRA, but no interest from the industry followed, since the requirements could not be met by available commercial off-the-shelf technology, and the project was closed in 2010.

During the United States 2008 wireless spectrum auction, the FCC allocated 20 MHz of the 700 MHz UHF radio band spectrum freed in the digital TV transition to public safety networks. The FCC expects providers to employ LTE for high-speed data and video applications.

== Conventional implementation ==
P25 systems do not have to resort to using in band signaling such as Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System (CTCSS) tone or Digital-Coded Squelch (DCS) codes for access control. Instead they use what is called a Network Access Code (NAC) which is included outside of the digital voice frame. This is a 12-bit code that prefixes every packet of data sent, including those carrying voice transmissions.

The NAC is a feature similar to CTCSS or DCS for analog radios. That is, radios can be programmed to only pass audio when receiving the correct NAC. NACs are programmed as a three-hexadecimal-digit code that is transmitted along with the digital signal being transmitted.

Since the NAC is a three-hexadecimal-digit number (12 bits), there are 4,096 possible NACs for programming, far more than all analog methods combined.

Three of the possible NACs have special functions:

* 0x293 ($293) – the default NAC
* 0xf7e ($F7E) – a receiver set for this NAC will pass audio on any decoded signal received
* 0xf7f ($F7F) – a repeater receiver set for this NAC will allow all incoming decoded signals and the repeater transmitter will retransmit the received NAC.

== Adoption ==
Adoption of these standards has been slowed by budget problems in the US; however, funding for communications upgrades from the Department of Homeland Security usually requires migrating to Project 25. It is also being used in other countries worldwide including Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Canada, India and Russia. As of mid-2004 there were 660 networks with P25 deployed in 54 countries. At the same time, in 2005, the European Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA) was deployed in sixty countries, and it is the preferred choice in Europe, China, and other countries. This was largely based on TETRA systems being many times cheaper than P25 systems ($900 vs $6,000 for a radio) at the time. However P25 radio prices are rapidly approaching parity with TETRA radio prices through increased competition in the P25 market. The majority of P25 networks are based in Northern America where it has the advantage that a P25 system has the same coverage and frequency bandwidth as the earlier analog systems that were in use so that channels can be easily upgraded one by one. Some P25 networks also allow intelligent migration from the analog radios to digital radios operating within the same network. Both P25 and TETRA can offer varying degrees of functionality, depending on available radio spectrum, terrain and project budget.

While interoperability is a major goal of P25, many P25 features present interoperability challenges. In theory, all P25 compliant equipment is interoperable. In practice, interoperable communications isn&#x27;t achievable without effective governance, standardized operating procedures, effective training and exercises, and inter-jurisdictional coordination. The difficulties inherent in developing P25 networks using features such as digital voice, encryption, or trunking sometimes result in feature-backlash and organizational retreat to minimal &quot;feature-free&quot; P25 implementations which fulfill the letter of any Project 25 migration requirement without realizing the benefits thereof. Additionally, while not a technical issue per se, frictions often result from the unwieldy bureaucratic inter-agency processes that tend to develop in order to coordinate interoperability decisions.

=== Naming of P25 technology in regions === 
* Statewide P25 systems in Australia were deployed using the name Government Radio Network (GRN) in New South Wales, South Australia, and Tasmania; Government Wireless Network (GWN) in Queensland; Territory Radio Network (TRN) in the Australian Capital Territory; and Melbourne Metropolitan Radio (MMR) and Rural Mobile Radio (RMR) in Victoria. In New South Wales, the GRN is now called the Public Safety Network (PSN).

== Project 25 Compliance Assessment Program (P25 CAP) ==

The United States DHS&#x27;s Project 25 Compliance Assessment Program (P25 CAP) aims for interoperability among different vendors by testing to P25 Standards. P25 CAP, a voluntary program, allows suppliers to publicly attest to their products&#x27; compliance.

Independent, accredited labs test vendor&#x27;s P25 radios for compliance to P25 Standards, derived from TIA-102 Standards and following TIA-TR8 testing procedures. Only approved products may be purchased using US federal grant dollars. Generally, non-approved products should not be trusted to be meet P25 standards for performance, conformance, and interoperability.

P25 product labeling varies. &quot;P25&quot; and &quot;P25 compliant&quot; mean nothing while high standards apply for a vendor to claim a product is &quot;P25 CAP compliant&quot; or &quot;P25 compliant with the Statement of Requirements (P25 SOR)&quot;

==Security flaws==

=== OP25 Project—Encryption flaws in DES-OFB and ADP ciphers ===

At the Securecomm 2011 conference in London, security researcher Steve Glass presented a paper, written by himself and co-author Matt Ames, that explained how DES-OFB and Motorola&#x27;s proprietary ADP (RC4 based) ciphers were vulnerable to brute force key recovery. This research was the result of the OP25 project which uses GNU Radio and the Ettus Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) to implement an open source P25 packet sniffer and analyzer. The OP25 project was founded by Steve Glass in early 2008 while he was performing research into wireless networks as part of his PhD thesis.

The paper is available for download from the NICTA website.

=== University of Pennsylvania research ===

In 2011, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; published an article describing research into security flaws of the system, including a user interface that makes it difficult for users to recognize when transceivers are operating in secure mode. According to the article, &quot;(R)esearchers from the University of Pennsylvania overheard conversations that included descriptions of undercover agents and confidential informants, plans for forthcoming arrests and information on the technology used in surveillance operations.&quot; The researchers found that the messages sent over the radios are sent in segments, and blocking just a portion of these segments can result in the entire message being jammed. &quot;Their research also shows that the radios can be effectively jammed (single radio, short range) using a highly modified pink electronic child&#x27;s toy and that the standard used by the radios &#x27;provides a convenient means for an attacker&#x27; to continuously track the location of a radio&#x27;s user. With other systems, jammers have to expend a lot of power to block communications, but the P25 radios allow jamming at relatively low power, enabling the researchers to prevent reception using a $30 toy pager designed for pre-teens.&quot;

The report was presented at the 20th USENIX Security Symposium in San Francisco in August 2011. The report noted a number of security flaws in the Project 25 system, some specific to the way it has been implemented and some inherent in the security design.

====Encryption lapses====
The report did not find any breaks in the P25 encryption; however, they observed large amounts of sensitive traffic being sent in the clear due to implementations problems. They found switch markings for secure and clear modes difficult to distinguish (∅ vs. o). This is exacerbated by the fact that P25 radios when set to secure mode continue to operate without issuing a warning if another party switches to clear mode. In addition, the report authors said many P25 systems change keys too often, increasing the risk that an individual radio on a net may not be properly keyed, forcing all users on the net to transmit in the clear to maintain communications with that radio.

====Jamming vulnerability====
One design choice was to use lower levels of error correction for portions of the encoded voice data that are deemed less critical for intelligibility. As a result, bit errors may be expected in typical transmissions, and while harmless for voice communication, the presence of such errors force the use of stream ciphers, which can tolerate bit errors, and prevents the use of a standard technique, message authentication codes (MACs), to protect message integrity from stream cipher attacks. The varying levels of error correction are implemented by breaking P25 message frames into subframes. This allows an attacker to jam entire messages by transmitting only during certain short subframes that are critical to reception of the entire frame. As a result, an attacker can effectively jam Project 25 signals with average power levels much lower than the power levels used for communication. Such attacks can be targeted at encrypted transmissions only, forcing users to transmit in the clear.

Because Project 25 radios are designed to work in existing two-way radio frequency channels, they cannot use spread spectrum modulation, which is inherently jam-resistant. An optimal spread spectrum system can require an effective jammer to use 1,000 times as much power (30 dB more) as the individual communicators. According to the report, a P25 jammer could effectively operate at 1/25th the power (14 dB less) than the communicating radios. The authors developed a proof-of-concept jammer using a Texas Instruments CC1110 single chip radio, found in an inexpensive toy.

====Traffic analysis and active tracking====
Certain metadata fields in the Project 25 protocol are not encrypted, allowing an attacker to perform traffic analysis to identify users. Because Project 25 radios respond to bad data packets addressed to them with a retransmission request, an attacker can deliberately send bad packets forcing a specific radio to transmit even if the user is attempting to maintain radio silence. Such tracking by authorized users is considered a feature of P25, referred to as &quot;presence&quot;.

The report&#x27;s authors concluded by saying &quot;It is reasonable to wonder why this protocol, which was developed over many years and is used for sensitive and critical applications, is so difficult to use and so vulnerable to attack.&quot; The authors separately issued a set of recommendations for P25 users to mitigate some of the problems found. These include disabling the secure/clear switch, using Network Access Codes to segregate clear and encrypted traffic, and compensating for the unreliability of P25 over-the-air rekeying by extending key life.

==Comparison between P25 and TETRA== 
P25 and TETRA are used in more than 53 countries worldwide for both public safety and private sector radio networks. There are some differences in features and capacities:
* TETRA is optimized for high population density areas, and has spectral efficiency of 4 time slots in 25 kHz. (Four communications channels per 25 kHz channel, an efficient use of spectrum). It supports full-duplex voice communication, data, and messaging. It does not provide simulcast.
* P25 is optimized for wider area coverage with low population density, and also supports simulcast. It is, however, limited with respect to data support. There is a major subdivision within P25 radio systems: Phase I P25 operates analogue, digital, or mixed mode in a single 12.5 kHz channel. Phase II uses a 2-timeslot TDMA structure in each 12.5 kHz channel.

<text>Charlton St Peter and Wilsford Joint Parish Council is a grouped parish council serving the adjacent civil parishes of Charlton St Peter and Wilsford, in the Vale of Pewsey in the English county of Wiltshire.

Charlton and Wilsford elect a single parish council since their populations are small; in 2021, Wilsford had 66 electors and Charlton approximately 132. Wilsford elects two parish councillors, and Charlton five. The parishes fall within the area of the Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for most significant local government functions.

When the joint parish council was formed, sometime before 2011, it was called Charlton and Wilsford Parish Council. During consultation for a community governance review in 2021–2022 it was proposed that St Peter should be added to the name, to reflect local usage and make a distinction from the Charlton parish in north Wiltshire. Accordingly, in May 2022, Wiltshire Council formally amended the name of the parish council to Charlton St Peter and Wilsford Joint Parish Council.

<text>HNoMS &quot;Fridtjof Nansen&quot; is a frigate of the Royal Norwegian Navy. Commissioned on 5 April 2006, she is the lead ship of the &quot;Fridtjof Nansen&quot; class of warships.

==Counter-piracy==
On 26 February 2009, the Norwegian government decided to deploy HNoMS &quot;Fridtjof Nansen&quot; to the Gulf of Aden, thereby participating in the ongoing Operation Atalanta, the European Union&#x27;s counter-piracy campaign in Somalia. &quot;Fridtjof Nansen&quot; joined the campaign in August 2009.

&quot;Fridtjof Nansen&quot;″s engagement in Operation Atalanta was carried out without a permanently stationed helicopter. Mainly due to delays in delivery of the new NH-90, the ship is equipped with two ultra-fast RHIBs as a replacement.
In November 2009 she became involved in a fire-fight with suspected pirates after being attacked while inspecting a fishing vessel.

==RIMPAC 2014==
In 2014, &quot;Fridtjof Nansen&quot; took part in the naval exercise RIMPAC 2014 in the Pacific Ocean. During the exercise, she used a Naval Strike Missile to sink the , a decommissioned U.S. Navy amphibious transport dock, as a target 55 nautical miles northwest of Hawaii on 10 July 2014.

==Carrier Strike Group 8==
From September 2021 to May 2022, &quot;Fridtjof Nansen&quot; was fully integrated with the US Navy&#x27;s Carrier Strike Group 8 (CSG-8) as part of the USN&#x27;s Cooperative Deployment Program. The Nansen arrived at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia in September 2021 and underwent extensive training, testing and certification before deploying with the USS &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; (CVN-75) and the rest of the strike group in December 2021. The strike group was originally planned to transit the Suez Canal in early February for a cruise through the Middle East and Persian Gulf regions, but in light of the tensions surrounding the ongoing standoff between Russia and Ukraine, they were ordered to remain in the Mediterranean until further notice. The Nansen served a full 6 month deployment with the group before returning to Norway in May 2022.

<text>Global Electric Motorcars (GEM) is an American automotive manufacturer specializing in neighborhood electric vehicles (NEVs) since 1998 and low-speed vehicles (LSVs) since 2001. By October 2015 the company had sold over 50,000 GEM Battery electric vehicles worldwide. Originally owned by Chrysler, GEM was acquired by Polaris Inc. in 2011. In January 2022, it became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Waev.

==History==

The company was founded in 1992 by a team of ex-General Motors engineers from Livonia, Michigan, under the name Trans2.

The company was purchased by a group of North Dakota investors and relocated to Fargo, North Dakota. Global Electric Motorcars manufactured its first vehicle in April 1998, a 48-volt GEM car designed for two passengers with a top speed of . Shortly after, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) established a new class of motor vehicles, the low-speed vehicle (LSV), also known as the Neighborhood Electric Vehicle (NEV). This classification allowed GEM cars to be driven on public roads, provided they met specific safety criteria such as having safety belts, headlamps, windshield wipers, and safety glass.

GEM battery-electric vehicles are street legal in nearly all 50 US states on public roads with speed limits of or less. With a top speed of , GEM cars have a range of on a single charge depending on the installed battery technology. They are battery-electric, operating on a 72-volt battery system that can be plugged into a standard 3-prong 120-volt outlet for recharging, and they fully recharge in six to eight hours.

Currently, there are six different models of GEM cars available, GEM cars are utilized by local, state, and national government agencies, resorts, master-planned communities, universities, medical and corporate campuses, as well as by sports teams, taxi-shuttle services, and the general public.

<text>Raghavendra Tirtha (), also referred as Raghavendra Swami, (1595 – 1671) was a Vaishnava scholar, theologian, and saint. He was also known as Sudha Parimalacharya (). His diverse oeuvre include commentaries on the works of Madhva, Jayatirtha, and Vyasatirtha, interpretation of the Principal Upanishads from the standpoint of Dvaita and a treatise on Purva Mimamsa. He served as the pontiff of the matha at Kumbakonam from 1621 to 1671. Raghavendra Tirtha was also an accomplished player of the veena and he composed several songs under the name of &quot;Venu Gopala&quot;. His memorial at Mantralayam attracts lakhs (hundreds of thousands) of visitors every year.

==Biography==
Raghavendra Tirtha was born as Venkatanatha in the town of Bhuvanagiri, Tamil Nadu into a Kannada Madhva Brahmin family of Gautama Gotra of musicians and scholars. His great-grandfather Krishna Bhatta was a tutor to the Vijayanagara emperor Krishnadevaraya. His grandfather was Kanakachala Bhatta, and his father Thimmanna Bhatta (also known as Thimmannacharya) was an accomplished scholar and musician. After the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire, Thimmanacharya migrated to Kanchi with his wife Gopikamba. Venkatanatha had two siblings—Gururaja and Venkatamba. Venkatanatha&#x27;s education was taken care of by his brother-in-law Lakshmi Narasimhacharya at Madurai after the early demise of his father, and he subsequently got married.

In 1624, Raghavendra Tirtha became the pontiff of the &quot;Kumbhakonam Matha&quot;, which was earlier known as &quot;Vijayeendra Matha&quot; or &quot;Dakshinadi Matha&quot;, now known by the name of Mantralaya Sri Raghavendra Swamy Matha. Uttaradi Math along with Vyasaraja Math and Raghavendra Math are considered to be the three premier apostolic institutions of Dvaita Vedanta and are jointly referred as &quot;Mathatraya&quot;.

After a short stay at Kumbakonam, he went on a pilgrimage to Rameswaram, Ramnad, Srirangam, and Mathura. Later, he moved westwards to Udupi and Subramanya, and then to Pandharpur, Kolhapur and Bijapur. At Kolhapur, he is said to have stayed for a long time and at Bijapur, he supposedly defeated many Advaitins and converted them to Dvaita fold. After that, he returned to Kumbakonam. By 1663 he left for Mysore where he got a grant from Dodda Devaraya Odeyar. Finally, he chose to settle down in Mantralayam.

Raghavendra Tirtha died in 1671 in Mantralayam, a village on the bank of river Tungabhadra in Adoni taluk in Andhra Pradesh.

==Works==
Forty works have been attributed to Raghavendra Tirtha. Sharma notes that his works are characterised by their compactness, simplicity and their ability to explain the abstruse metaphysical concepts of Dvaita in understandable terms. His &quot;Tantradipika&quot; is an interpretation of the Brahma Sutra from the standpoint of Dvaita incorporating elements from Jayatirtha&#x27;s &quot;Nyaya Sudha&quot;, Vyasatirtha&#x27;s &quot;Tatparya Chandrika&quot; and the glosses by Vijayendra Tirtha. &quot;Bhavadipa&quot; is a commentary on Jayatirtha&#x27;s &quot;Tattva Prakasika&quot; which, apart from elucidating the concepts of the source text, criticises the allegations against Madhva raised by Appaya Dikshita and grammarian Bhattoji Dikshita.Raghavendra Tirtha&#x27;s expertise in Purva Mimamsa and Vyakarana is evident from his works on Vyasatirtha&#x27;s &quot;Tatparya Chandrika&quot;, which runs up to 18,000 stanzas. He wrote a commentary on &quot;Nyaya Sudha&quot; titled &quot;Nyaya Sudha Parimala&quot;. Apart from these works, he has authored commentaries on the Upanishads, first three chapters of Rigveda (called &quot;Mantramanjari&quot;) and Bhagavad Gita. As an independent treatise, he has authored a commentary on Jaimini Sutras called &quot;Bhatta Sangraha&quot; which seeks to interpret the Purva Mimamsa doctrines from a Dvaita perspective.

==Conversation with Sir Thomas Munroe in 19th century==
While Rayaru had his Brindavana Pravesha around 1:30 pm in the 17th century, it is recorded in the Gazette of then Madras Presidency that he gave darshan and spoke to Sir Thomas Munroe, a civil servant of British Government and discussed with him the restitution of the Inam Lands to the government which was being proposed then, meaning that Mantralaya would have become part of the restituted lands. After such a conversation, which Sir Thomas Munroe dutifully transcribed, the restitution was withdrawn.

==In popular culture==
Raghavendra Tirtha has been eulogised by Narayanacharya in his contemporaneous biography &quot;Raghavendra Vijaya&quot; and a hymn &quot;Raghavendra Stotra&quot; by Appannacharya. Outside the confines of Dvaita, he is regarded as a saint known for preaching the worship of Vishnu regardless of caste or creed. Hebbar notes &quot;By virtue of his spiritual charisma, coupled with the innumerable miracles associated with him, the pontiff saint may very well be said to possess an independent and cosmopolitan cult of his own with his devotees hailing not only from all walks of life but from all castes, sects and even creeds as well&quot;. His humanitarianism is evident in the devotional poems composed in his honour by Vijaya Dasa, Gopala Dasa and Jagannatha Dasa. Raghavendra has also seen representation in the popular culture through Indian Cinema.

<text>Setra is a German bus brand of EvoBus GmbH, itself a wholly owned subsidiary of Daimler Truck AG.

The name &quot;Setra&quot; comes from &quot;selbsttragend&quot; (self-supporting). This refers to the integral nature of the construction of the vehicles back in the 1950s when competitor vehicles still featured a separate chassis and body (often manufactured by separate companies). It is also possible that, with an eye to export markets, the company was mindful that for non-German speakers, the name &quot;Kässbohrer&quot; is difficult to pronounce. Until 1995 the firm operated under the name Karl Kässbohrer Fahrzeugwerke GmbH, but in that year economic difficulties enforced its sale to Daimler-Benz AG (between 1998 and 2008 known, especially in the United States, by the name of its holding company Daimler Chrysler). Since 1995, Setra has been a brand of the Daimler subsidiary, EvoBus GmbH.

The North American distribution for Setra by Daimler was set to be partnered and taken over by Motor Coach Industries on April 25, 2012, as Daimler restructured its North American bus operations in 2013; this agreement lasted until the end of 2017 when the REV Group assumed distribution responsibilities. Daimler has again self-distributed Setra coaches in North America since January 2020, through its new subsidiary, Daimler Coaches North America, LLC, with service support from Daimler Truck North America.

== History ==
The first Setra coach, the Type S8, so called because it contained eight rows of seats, was introduced in April 1951 at the French Internationale Automobile-vouz. It featured a self-supporting body designed by Otto Kässbohrer, a concept now featured in most modern coaches and buses. Equally unusual at the time was the decision to locate the engine behind the rear axle; the rear-mounted engine configuration is another Setra innovation which subsequently became mainstream. It simplified the production process and created a range of passenger-focused possibilities regarding the floor level in the passenger and driver/crew sections, and for high-floor layouts, flexible use of the underfloor area.

== Models ==
The maximum number of seat rows can be identified by the type designation. In the first Setra series, the number of seats was alone. In the second series (series 100), a 0 or 5 was affixed, and one of the numbers preceded in each of the following series (series 200, 300, and 400). Example: S 8 (= 8 seat rows), S 140 (= 14 seat rows), S 215 (= 15 seat rows), S 417 (= 17 seat rows), or S 319 UL (= 19 seat rows). The seats are reduced by comforter buildings or a certain star classification; The type designation is retained. Starting from the series 200, additions after the number indicated the equipment: current (series 400/500) are H for high-floor construction (no wheel arches in the passenger compartment), HD for high floor, HDH for an extra-high floor, DT for double-deck touring bus, MD for mid-height floor (a spinoff of the GT series), UL for interurban commuter buses and NF for low-floor buses. In the past, the &quot;Grand Tourisme&quot; (GT), HDS for double-deck, SL for city buses, and NR (low-floor Rational) were used for the first highway low-floor (200 series). Only a few types were given different designations, for example, the S 250 Special (a modified S 215 HD which was also offered as an entry-level model after the introduction of the 300 series) and the S 300 NC (a former low-floor city bus as a predecessor of the Mercedes-Benz Citaro).

The different models of the 200 series also bore the name designations with name suffixes, whereby the designation &quot;International&quot; (with the letter I appended to the type designation) for travel and combi-buses with simplified heating/ventilation was used. The term &quot;Communal&quot; and &quot;Regional&quot; were used for regular services, and &quot;Rational&quot; for travel combination models. The short-term offered club bus model based on the S 210 H deviated from the name &quot;Real&quot;. Air-conditioned high-floor buses were called &quot;Optimal&quot;, the double-deck S 216 HDS &quot;Royal&quot; and the double-deck S 228 DT &quot;Imperial&quot;. The export version of the 215 HDH for the US market (later on, the HDH model for the local market was based) was called &quot;Transcontinental&quot;. Some of these designations still existed with the introduction of the 300 series, as for the S 328 DT, at the latest with the introduction of the 400 series, these name additions with the division into &quot;MultiClass&quot;, &quot;ComfortClass&quot; and &quot;TopClass&quot; were abandoned. Additionally, the name &quot;Business&quot; has been produced in Turkey since 2013, with simpler equipment.

In 1941–42, he served with the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations and was a member of the Permanent Joint Board on Defense, Canada-United States.

Commander Sherman worked closely with then US Army Major Albert C. Wedemeyer, author of the &quot;Victory Plan of 1941&quot;, &quot;the blueprint... for the mobilization of the United States Army for World War 2&quot;. Wedemeyer, while working in the War Plans Department, was commissioned to write the &quot;Victory Plan by General George C. Marshall.&quot;

In May 1942, after reaching the rank of captain, Sherman took command of the carrier , taking the ship through the first month of the Solomon Islands campaign.

After &quot;Wasp&quot; was sunk by a Japanese submarine on September 15, 1942, Sherman was awarded the Navy Cross for his extraordinary heroism in command of the carrier during the opening days of the South Pacific operations. Sherman then became Chief of Staff to Commander Air Force, Pacific Fleet. In November 1943, Rear Admiral Sherman was assigned as Deputy Chief of Staff to the Pacific Fleet commander, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. He held that position for the remainder of World War II, playing a critical role in planning the offensives that brought victory in the Pacific, and was present when Japan surrendered on September 2, 1945. Following a short tour as a carrier division commander, in December 1945 Vice Admiral Sherman became Deputy Chief of Naval Operations. During 1946 and 1947 he had a vital role in the negotiations for the unification process leading to the 1947 National Security Act.

Sherman&#x27;s next assignment, beginning in January 1948, was to command the navy&#x27;s operating forces in the Mediterranean Sea. He was recalled to Washington, D.C., at the end of October 1949 to become Chief of Naval Operations, with the rank of admiral. During the next sixteen months, he helped the navy recover from a period of intense political controversy (as in the so-called &quot;Revolt of the Admirals&quot;). Sherman&#x27;s absence from the recent controversy, and his role in the unification negotiations made him the logical candidate. As Chief of Naval Operations, he oversaw the responses to the twin challenges of a hot war in Korea and an intensifying cold war elsewhere in the world.

On July 22, 1951, while on a military and diplomatic trip to Europe, Admiral Forrest Sherman died in Naples, Italy, following a sudden series of heart attacks. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery on July 27, 1951.

==Legacy==
, lead ship of the s was named in his honor, followed by , an guided missile destroyer.

Also named in his honor was Sherman Island, Antarctica; Forrest Sherman Field at NAS Pensacola, home of the Blue Angels; and Forrest Sherman Field at Hospital Point at the US Naval Academy. The US Department of Defense school in Naples, Italy was formerly called Forrest Sherman High School.

<doc id="1041984" wikidata="Q4863942" url="?curid=1041984" title="Barry's Tea">
<text>Barry&#x27;s Tea is an Irish tea company founded in 1901 by James J. Barry in Cork. Until the 1960s, tea was sold from a shop in Prince&#x27;s Street, but thereafter the company expanded its wholesaling and distribution operations. There is a common debate among Irish households about which is the superior Irish tea – Barry&#x27;s Tea or Lyons Tea.

==History==
By the mid-1980s Barry&#x27;s Tea had become a national brand. According to their website, they are currently responsible for 38% of all tea sales in the Irish market (which is worth an estimated €85 million annually). Today, Barry&#x27;s Tea is also available in the United Kingdom, Spain, and in some areas of Canada, Australia, France, Luxembourg and the United States where there are significant Irish immigrant communities.

Members of the Barry family been elected representatives for Fine Gael: the founder&#x27;s son Anthony Barry (TD 1954–1957 and 1961–1965), Anthony&#x27;s son Peter Barry (TD 1969–1997) and Peter&#x27;s daughter Deirdre Clune (TD 1997–2001 and 2007–2011, and MEP from 2014 to 2024.

==Controversies==
In May 2018, it was revealed that many of Barry&#x27;s Tea teabags are made with polypropylene, a non-compostable plastic which is damaging to the environment. As of August 2021, the company claimed that it had responded to consumer pressure and had made 100% of its teabags biodegradable. 

Barry&#x27;s Tea was a major sponsor of the greyhound racing industry in Ireland. Despite numerous calls for the company to desist, it had refused to cease its sponsorship of an industry which had been the subject of repeated investigations into animal cruelty. As of July 2019, the sponsorship has been pulled indefinitely.

<doc id="1041986" wikidata="Q1191236" url="?curid=1041986" title="Infinite Ryvius">
<text>is a 26-episode science fiction drama anime series produced by Sunrise.

The character and mecha designs in &quot;Ryvius&quot; were created by Hisashi Hirai, who later went on to design characters for &quot;Gundam SEED&quot;.

The series is noted for its music, which blends Western R&amp;B/hip-hop with J-pop vocals, including its title song &quot;dis–&quot;, performed by bilingual Japanese-American singer Mika Arisaka. Most of the songs were composed by M.I.D., while background instrumentals were created by Katsuhisa Hattori.

The anime was originally licensed by Bandai Entertainment in North America until it went out of print in 2012. Following the closure of Bandai Entertainment, Sunrise announced at Otakon 2013 that Sentai Filmworks had rescued &quot;Infinite Ryvius&quot;, along with a handful of other former BEI titles.

A two-volume manga adaptation was released concurrently with the series in 1999–2000, which was then published in English in 2004. A parody spin-off original net animation (ONA) series, &quot;Infinite Ryvius: Illusion&quot;, was released in 2000.

== Plot ==
In the year AD 2225, mankind has expanded from Earth to inhabit nearly all the planets and nearby moons in colonies and settlements. Space travel has advanced to the point of being commonplace; for the inhabitants of the Solar System, becoming an astronaut is a realistic career path. One of the schools established to train future space voyagers is the Liebe Delta, a space station positioned in Earth&#x27;s orbit. This progress exists despite the &quot;Geduld&quot;, a mysterious sea of plasma that erupted from the sun along Earth&#x27;s orbital plane in AD 2137. Stretching from the sun to the edge of the solar system, this phenomenon of high temperatures and gravity pressures remains unexplained.

Kouji Aiba, a sixteen-year-old boy, leaves his home on Earth to attend the Liebe Delta and train for his Level 2 piloting license, traveling alongside his childhood friend, Aoi Housen, who unexpectedly reveals her enrollment in the station&#x27;s flight attendant program and informs him that his younger brother, Yuki, will also be joining the same flight class.

The students and teaching staff on the Liebe Delta lead normal lives, focused on their studies and daily routines. They even have a vacation period, called the &quot;Dive Break,&quot; during which the space station approaches the Geduld for system maintenance. Out of approximately 1,000 students, about 500 remain onboard during the break. Unknown to everyone, the space station is sabotaged by a gas attack during a routine dive, leaving most of the staff unconscious. The Liebe Delta begins free falling into the depths of the Geduld Sea, where the intense gravitational pressures threaten to crush the station and kill everyone aboard. The remaining instructors sacrifice their lives to save the students, but their efforts fail. Just as the station teeters on the edge of collapse, a hidden ship called the &quot;RYVIUS&quot; activates and surfaces from the Geduld Sea, rescuing the surviving students aboard the Liebe Delta.

Now stranded in space and abandoned by humanity&#x27;s governments, the students aboard the &quot;RYVIUS&quot; must navigate their new reality. As anger, fear, and tension grow among the crew, Kouji struggles to maintain order and unity. He faces personal challenges (including clashes with his brother Yuki), his complicated feelings for the Uranian aristocrat Fina S. Shinozaki, the task of avoiding Aoi, and the mysterious appearance of a girl in pink wandering the halls. As the situation worsens, Kouji must determine whether he can guide the &quot;RYVIUS&quot; to safety or if he will lose everything he holds dear.

== Vaia ships ==

The Vaia ships are said to be crucial to mankind&#x27;s survival, despite their effect on those exposed to them for long enough, which results in a major mental breakdown as seen with the Blue Impulse&#x27;s captain after losing the battle with the Ryvius. It was mentioned that there were six Vaia ships, which took several hundred thousand trained astronauts entering into the Geduld to capture, formulate, and secure Vaia for the ships. This was done to protect humanity from another Geduld phenomenon, as the Vital Guarders&#x27; gravitational warping effects could block the advancing Geduld phenomenon.

* Black Ryvius (Referred to as the &quot;Brattica&quot; by those who seek to take it.) The primary setting of the rest of the series after the destruction of the Liebe Delta, and the target of the Orbital Security Bureau. The Ryvius is one of two Vaia ships whose Sphixs have been manifested, but it is also the only one with a humanized one, Neya. The other ship is stripped of any humanity but the desire to kill Neya. Vital Guarder - Einvalt, a giant humanoid-like mecha deployed from the lift ship housed in the front of the Ryvius, has the power to control gravitational forces, similar to the others, but has much stronger localized control of the gravity waves it creates (mainly from its hands).
* Blue Impulse The first Vaia ship to be a technical casualty to the Ryvius. Vital Guarder - Vertical Drill, a powerful Vital Guarder capable of plowing through large masses using a robust gravitational field projected around the main drill arm, which spins with tremendous force.
* Crimson Dicastia Crewed exclusively by women. The Dicastia boasts the most significant output of gravitational force, using smaller pods wired together. Vital Guarder - Eysfina, the pod chain system, is used to generate an entrapping gravity field.
* Grey Gespenst Conrad Vicuss&#x27;s Vaia ship, most akin to the Ryvius. Vital Guarder - Geist, a humanoid body-fixed Vital Guarder with tremendous gravitational force power.

After an intensely fierce battle and the loss of his Vital Guarder, Conrad Vicuss took his own life, marking the end of the war between the Orbital Security Bureau and the crew of the Ryvius.

== Themes and Symbols ==

&quot;Infinite Ryvius&quot; explores complex themes and symbolism:

* **Responsibility:** With the absence of adult guidance, the children are forced to take responsibility for difficult decisions.
* **Loss of Innocence:** The burden of responsibility and adult situations lead to a premature loss of innocence for the children.
* **Politics:** The shifting political power structure aboard the ship reflects real-world politics.

== Episodes ==


== Manga ==
A companion manga was released in Japan in 1999–2000. Created by Shinsuke Kurihashi and published by MediaWorks Publishing, the manga details the voyage of the Ryvius from the character viewpoints of Aoi Housen, and to a lesser extent, her roommates Kozue Izumi and Reiko Ichikawa. This is in contrast to the anime, which is seen through the eyes of the Aiba brothers, Ikumi Oze, and other mostly male characters. As such, the manga does not follow the anime &quot;to the letter&quot; but provides episodes and plotlines previously unseen.

The English-language rights to the &quot;Ryvius&quot; manga were acquired by ComicsOne, and the first volume of the English version, covering anime episodes 1–13, was released in October 2004. The second and final volume, covering the remainder of the series, was expected to be released in January 2005. After ComicsOne was taken over by DrMaster, Volume 2 of the &quot;Infinite Ryvius&quot; manga was delayed. It was finally released under the new DrMaster label in May 2005.

<text>Christof Koch ( ; born November 13, 1956) is an American cognitive scientist, neurophysiologist and computational neuroscientist best known for his work on the neural basis of consciousness. He was the president and chief scientist of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle. He remains at the Institute as a Meritorious Investigator. He is also the Chief Scientist of the Tiny Blue Dot Foundation in Santa Monica, that funds research meant to alleviate suffering, anxiety and other forms of distress in all people.

From 1986 until 2013, he was a professor at the California Institute of Technology.

==Early life and education==
Koch was born in the Midwestern United States, and subsequently was raised in the Netherlands, Germany, Canada, and Morocco. Koch is the son of German parents; his father was a diplomat, as is his older brother Michael. He was raised as a Roman Catholic and attended a Jesuit high school in Morocco. His interest in consciousness commenced as a child when he decided that consciousness must apply to all animals, not only to humans.

He received a PhD in sciences for his works in the field of nonlinear information processing from the Max Planck Institute in Tübingen, Germany, in 1982.

Koch worked for four years at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at MIT before joining, in 1986, the newly started Computation and Neural Systems PhD program at the California Institute of Technology.

==Career==
Koch has authored more than 350 scientific papers and six books about how computers and neurons process information.

In 1986, Koch and Shimon Ullman proposed the idea of a visual saliency map in the primate visual system. Subsequently, his then PhD-student, Laurent Itti, and Koch developed a popular suite of visual saliency algorithms.

For over two decades, Koch and his students have carried out detailed biophysical simulations of the electrical properties of neuronal tissue, from simulating the details of the action potential propagation along axons and dendrites to the synthesis of the local field potential and the EEG from the electrical activity of large populations of excitable neurons.

Since the early 1990s, Koch has argued that identifying the mechanistic basis of consciousness is a scientifically tractable problem, and has been influential in arguing that consciousness can be approached using the modern tools of neurobiology. He and his student Nao Tsuchiya invented continuous flash suppression, an efficient psychophysical masking technique for rendering images invisible for many seconds. They have used this technique to argue that selective attention and consciousness are distinct phenomena, with distinct biological functions and mechanisms.

Koch&#x27;s primary collaborator in the endeavor of locating the neural correlates of consciousness was the molecular biologist turned neuroscientist, Francis Crick, starting with their first paper in 1990 and their last one, that Crick edited on the day of his death, July 24, 2004, on the relationship between the claustrum, a mysterious anatomical structure situated underneath the insular cortex, and consciousness.

Over the last decade, Koch has worked closely with the psychiatrist and neuroscientist Giulio Tononi. Koch advocates for a modern variant of panpsychism, the ancient philosophical belief that some form of consciousness can be found in all things. Tononi&#x27;s &quot;Integrated Information Theory&quot; (IIT) of consciousness differs from classical
panpsychism in that it only ascribes consciousness to things with some degree of irreducible cause-effect power, which could include the internet &quot;Thus, its sheer number of components exceeds that of any one human brain. Whether or not the Internet today feels like something to itself is completely speculative. Still, it is certainly conceivable.&quot; but does not include &quot;a bunch of disconnected neurons in a dish, a heap of sand, a galaxy of stars or a black hole,&quot; and by providing an analytical and empirically accessible framework for understanding experience and its mechanistic
origins. He and Tononi claim that IIT is able to solve the problem in conceiving how one mind can be composed of an aggregate of &quot;smaller&quot; minds, known as the combination problem.

Koch writes a popular column, &quot;Consciousness Redux&quot;, for &quot;Scientific American Mind&quot; on scientific and popular topics pertaining to consciousness.

Koch co-founded the Methods in Computational Neuroscience summer course at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole in 1988, the Neuromorphic Engineering summer school in Telluride, Colorado in 1994 and the Dynamic Brain summer course at the Friday Harbor Laboratories on San Juan Island in 2014. All three summer schools continue to be taught.

In early 2011, Koch became the chief scientist and the president of the Allen Institute for Brain Science, leading their ten-year project concerning high-throughput large-scale cortical coding. The mission is to understand the computations that lead from photons to behavior by observing and modeling the physical transformations of signals in the visual brain of behaving mice. The project seeks to catalogue all the building blocks (ca. 100 distinct cell types) of the then visual cortical regions and associated structures (thalamus, colliculus) and their dynamics. The scientists seek to know what the animal sees, how it thinks, and how it decides. They seek to map out the murine mind in a quantitative manner. The Allen Institute currently employs about 300 scientists, engineers, technologists and supporting personnel.
The first eight years of this ten-year endeavor to build brain observatories were funded by a donation more than $500 million by Microsoft founder and philanthropist Paul G. Allen.

Koch is a proponent of the idea that consciousness is a fundamental property of complex nervous networks. In 2014, he published a short discussion work, &quot;In which I argue that consciousness is a fundamental property of complex things&quot;, where he introduced the concept that consciousness is a fundamental property of networked entities, and therefore cannot be derived from anything else, since it is a simple substance.

In 2023, Koch lost a 25-year bet to philosopher David Chalmers. Koch bet that the neural underpinnings of consciousness will be well-understood by 2023, while Chalmers bet the contrary. Upon losing, Koch gifted Chalmers a case of fine wine.

<doc id="1042006" wikidata="Q7315358" url="?curid=1042006" title="Resettlement of the Jews in England">
<text>The resettlement of the Jews in England was an informal arrangement during the Commonwealth of England in the mid-1650s, which allowed Jews to practice their faith openly. It forms a prominent part of the history of the Jews in England. It happened directly after two events. Firstly a prominent rabbi Menasseh ben Israel came to the country from the Netherlands to make the case for Jewish resettlement, and secondly a Spanish New Christian (a supposedly converted Jew, who secretly practised his religion) merchant Antonio Robles requested that he be classified as a Jew rather than Spaniard during the war between England and Spain.

Historians have disagreed about the reasons behind the resettlement, particularly regarding Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s motives, but the move is generally seen as a part of a current of religious and intellectual thought moving towards liberty of conscience, encompassing philosemitic millenarianism and Hebraicism, as well as political and trade interests favouring Jewish presence in England. The schools of thought that led to the resettlement of the Jews in England is the most heavily studied subject of Anglo-Jewish history in the period before the eighteenth century.

== Background ==
In 1290, King Edward I of England had issued an edict expelling all Jews from England. However, the English Reformation, which started in the 1530s, brought a number of changes that benefited Jews in the long term. Doctrines and rituals of the Roman Catholic church that insulted Jews were eliminated, especially those that emphasised their role in the death of Jesus. Further anti-Catholicism, with the Pope as antichrist, came to replace antisemitism. The period of the English Civil Wars and Interregnum was marked by both widespread millennial beliefs and a beginning of religious tolerance. Significantly, millenarianism in England often had a strong Hebraist character, that emphasised the study of Hebrew and Judaism. This was sometimes extended by certain individuals to claim the English as the descendants of the Ten lost tribes of Israel, with Cromwell himself numbering amongst the supporters of this idea.
After both the Alhambra Decree of 1492, which expelled Jews from Spain in 1492, and similar measures in Portugal in 1496, some converso traders (Jewish converts to Christianity, who often practised Judaism in secret, sometimes also known as New Christians or derogatively as Marranos) settled in London and Bristol. The small community was largely linked by trade to Antwerp, and was expelled altogether in 1609. It was with London’s growing importance as a trading city that Jews from the Netherlands began to settle in the country once more from the 1630s. It is from this first that the current Jewish population of the UK has grown.

=== Religious toleration and liberty of conscience ===
The 1640s and 1650s in England were marked by intense debates about religious tolerance, marked by speeches and tracts by radical puritans and dissenters who called for liberty of conscience. This extreme diversity of opinion about religious toleration was sorted into 12 schools of thought in the study of the period by W.K. Jordan. John Coffey uses a simpler three-point schema: anti-tolerationists, conservative tolerationists, and radical tolerationists, pointing out that although the latter were in a minority, they formed an important part of the debate. Nonetheless it is important to remember that although figures such as William Walwyn, Henry Vane, John Milton, and others made powerful apologia for religious toleration, their frame of reference was theological, rather than secular in nature and they were not calling for religious pluralism as is understood today. The early and mid Seventeenth century was also marked by a rise in Hebraism, the study of Jewish scriptures, which were often used to discuss political issues such as the existence of a monarchy or republic, and religious toleration. This debate used Jewish sources to justify its conclusions. The most prominent scholar in the field was the MP and jurist John Selden, whose thought was influenced by Thomas Erastus and Grotius. Selden proposed minimal government intervention on matters of religion, a view he modelled on the Hebrew Commonwealth. He in turn influenced similar approaches in John Milton (whose plea for freedom of the press, the Areopagitica (1644), directly named him), Thomas Hobbes and James Harrington (the latter of whom proposed settling Jews in Ireland in his book &quot;The Commonwealth of Oceana&quot;).

Overall the strongest political group of the 1640s and 50s, the English Puritans, had a negative view of toleration, seeing it as a concession to evil and heresy. It was often associated with tolerating the heresies of Arminianism, the philosophy of free will and free thought, and Socinianism, a doctrine of Anti-trinitarianism. But despite this Puritan hostility to toleration, England did see a certain religious laissez-faire emerge (for instance, the Rump Parliament repealed the recusancy laws in 1650). This was partly due to the impossibility of stopping religious free expression, but it also became a part of the cause of the new model army. The doctrinal policies of the protectorate were largely conservative. However, this Puritan train of thought could also point towards liberty of conscience. For Congregationalists, truth lay in the spirit rather than institutions. Like the Platonists, they searched for internal unity amidst external diversity. Further, Puritans valued conscience, which could be neither forced nor tested, over ritual and ceremony. So rather than toleration, the key debate among key figures in the Protectorate revolved around liberty of conscience. For Blair Worden, Cromwell’s religious policy was rooted in a search for union of believers, rather than toleration of differing beliefs, and religious persecution was the largest obstacle to this union. However, liberty of conscience extended only to &quot;God&#x27;s peculiar&quot; and not heretics (such as Quakers, Socinians, and Ranters).

There was a great increase of religious freedom and the ecclesiastical diversity in Cromwellian England. This marked a revolutionary change and led to increasing toleration in the years after the interregnum ended. On the one hand, the loosely Calvinist Cromwell allowed the punishment of men such as the Unitarian John Biddle and the Quaker James Nayler, and accepted the restrictions on religious tolerance found in the Humble Petition and Advice of 1657. But on the other hand, his entourage included men who wanted more liberty of belief than he allowed. These non-sectarian ‘merciful men’ or politiques, who wanted to understand and tolerate beliefs different to their own, included Bulstrode Whitelocke, Matthew Hale, and Sir Charles Worsley.

=== Millenarian &#x27;admissionists&#x27; ===
The toleration of Jews was largely borne by the hope of converting them to Christianity. Leonard Busher was one of the first to call for the readmission of the Jews to England and the toleration of their faith in 1616. Lawyer and MP, Henry Finch and the scholar Joseph Mede both wrote of the benefits of the conversion of the Jews in the 1620s. The Scottish minister John Wemyss advocated readmitting Jews to Christian lands with a view to converting them in the 1630s. So, by the 1640s, the imminent conversion of the Jews was a widespread belief among Puritans. Indeed during that decade the Christians who were most liberal towards Jews are also those who were most committed to their conversion. A number of these ‘admissionists’ were close to Cromwell, including John Sadler, John Dury, and Hugh Peter. Other notable readmissionists include exiled Royalist cleric Thomas Barlow and the Dissenter Henry Jessey. The Fifth Monarchy Men were another example of Puritan millenarians who saw the readmission of the Jews as hastening the kingdom of Christ. The exiled Royalist Sir Edward Nicholas is one of the few admissionists who did not seem interested in conversion. By contrast, the anti-admissionists were often animated by the belief that it would be difficult or impossible to convert the Jews. William Prynne’s anti-Semitic pamphlet &quot;A Short Demurrer&quot;, which was printed on the eve of the Whitehall Conference, and the pamphlet &quot;Anglo-Judaeus or The History of the Jews Whilst Here in England&quot; by W.H. both doubt that the Jews would be converted once in England. Many millenarians at the time emphasised the chosen role of England in God’s plan, and this was often accompanied by the identification the Jews as the true Israel of the Bible. Indeed, they saw the Jews as a superior group, sharing some characteristics with the chosen nation of England. This belief was rooted in the literal interpretation of the Biblical primacy of the Jews found in the writings of Thomas Brightman. This meant that if the Jews were specially favoured by God, the English must listen to their appeals for help. These philo-semitic figures, who also believed in the restoration of the Jews to the Holy Land, included Jeremiah Burroughs, Peter Bulkeley (whose father had given Brightman’s funeral sermon), John Fenwicke, and John Cotton.

== 1649 to 1654: First steps towards resettlement ==

The original petition for readmission was submitted by Johanna and Ebenezer Cartwright, two English baptists living in Amsterdam, to Thomas Fairfax’s Council of War in January 1649. As well as asking that Jews be allowed to live in England, their petition also expressed the wish that the Jews &quot;shall come to know the Emanuell&quot; and that they be transported to the &quot;Land promised to their fore-fathers&quot;. It can be seen as a distillation of the Judeo-centric trends of Puritan thought that had developed over the previous century since John Bale (1495–1563). However, the petition was sent the day before the high court was established to try Charles I, so in the ensuing turmoil the Cartwrights never received an answer. The following year Amsterdam-based Rabbi and diplomat Menasseh Ben Israel wrote in his book &quot;Hope of Israel&quot; of the necessity of the Jews being &quot;spread out to the ends of the earth&quot; (Daniel 12:7) before they could be redeemed. The book was originally published in Dutch and Latin in 1650, and then in English (dedicated to Parliament and the Council of State) in 1652. In 1651 Ben Israel met Oliver St John and his envoys on their mission to secure an Anglo-Dutch coalition. The English were impressed by learning and manner, and advised him to formally apply for Jewish readmission to England.

In 1653, at Oliver St John’s suggestion, Cromwell issued an official directive to authorise, &quot;Menasseh ben Israel, a rabbi of the Jewish nation, well respected for his learning and good affection to the State, to come from Amsterdam to these parts.&quot; Fearing local anti-English opinion so soon after war, ben Israel turned down the invitation. But by the middle of the decade, Cromwell was taking advice from Marrano trader Simon de Caceres. At de Caceres&#x27; suggestion, Cromwell dispatched Marrano physician Abraham de Mercado and his son Raphael to Barbados (which a few years previously had already started admitting Jews escaping from the Portuguese reconquest of Dutch Brazil), where he explored the possibility of Jews setting in Jamaica. There they would be offered full civil rights and even land grants.

There is some difference of opinion as to Oliver Cromwell’s opinions regarding the readmission of the Jews. It has been pointed out that he held many of the same hopes regarding the readmission and conversion of the Jews as the millenarians. Paul Rycaut, later ambassador to the port of Smyrna recalled the Whitehall Conference, &quot;When they all met, he (Cromwell) ordered the Jews to speak for themselves. After that he turned to the clergy, who inveigled much against the Jews as a cruel and cursed people. Cromwell in his answer to the Clergy called them ‘Men of God’ and desired to be informed by the whether it was not their opinion that the Jews were one day to be called into the Church? He then desired to know whether it was not every Christian man’s duty to forward that good end all he could?… was it not then our duty… to encourage them to settle ere where they could be taught the thuth…[sic]&quot; It has also been pointed out that Cromwell held more practical beliefs. Cromwell believed that Jews could be used as skilled purveyors of foreign intelligence (which would assist his territorial ambitions). Further, toleration of Protestant sects made political sense for Cromwell as it prevented disorder and promoted harmony. He justified the readmission of the Jews using this same tolerant approach, as well as believing that it would improve trade (he saw the Jews as an important part of Amsterdam’s financial success).

Competition with the Dutch for trade and the increasingly protectionist commercial policy that led to the Navigation Act in October 1651 made Oliver Cromwell want to attract the rich Jews of Amsterdam to London so that they might transfer their important trade interests with the Spanish Main from the Netherlands to England. The mission of Oliver St John to Amsterdam, though failing to establish a coalition between English and Dutch commercial interests as an alternative to the Navigation Act, had negotiated with Menasseh Ben Israel and the Amsterdam community. A pass was granted to Menasseh to enter England, but he was unable to use it because of the First Anglo-Dutch War, which lasted from 1652 to 1654.

== 1655 and 1656: Informal resettlement achieved ==

The years 1655 and 1656 were to prove decisive in the history of the resettlement of the Jews in England. The first of these was the visit of Menasseh ben Israel and the second was the case of the Marrano trader Antonio Rodrigues Robles.

=== Menasseh Ben Israel&#x27;s petition ===
Menasseh ben Israel&#x27;s son Samuel had arrived in England accompanied by trader David Dormido in 1653 to investigate the possibility of the resettlement of the Jews. In May 1655, he was sent back to Amsterdam in order to try to convince his father to visit England. The rabbi came to England in September 1655 with three other local rabbis, where they were lodged as guests of Cromwell. There he printed his &quot;humble address&quot; to Cromwell. (When ben Israel began his stay in London it is reckoned that there were about 20 New Christian families living in the city.) As a consequence, a national conference was summoned at Whitehall in the early part of December, which included some of the most eminent lawyers, clergymen, and merchants in the country. The lawyers declared no opposition to the Jews&#x27; residing in England, but both the clergymen and merchants were opposed to readmission, leading Cromwell to stop the discussion to prevent an adverse decision. Nonetheless, some change to official policy must have occurred, because the diarist John Evelyn wrote in his diary on 14 December, &quot;Now were the Jews admitted&quot;. Ben Israel stayed in England until September 1657, during which time he met and engaged with a number of influential people. Although he did not achieve a legal ruling on the resettlement of the Jews, his presence gave prominent Englishmen a positive impression of learning and virtue among Jews.

=== The Robles case ===

Early in the following year (1656), the question came to a practical issue through the declaration of war against Spain, which resulted in the arrest of Antonio Rodrigues Robles, one of the community of Iberian New Christians who traded between London and the Canary Islands. Robles petitioned for the return of his seized property on account of his being ‘of the Hebrew nation’ rather than Spanish. At the same time six leading members of the New Christian community petitioned Cromwell for permission to gather to worship and acquire a burial ground. Although no formal permission was granted, some assurances must have been given because in the summer Menasseh asked for the Torah scroll to be sent over from Amsterdam, and in the autumn Moses Athias moved from Hamburg to act as religious preceptor. By December 1656 they had rented a house for use as a synagogue, and services began in January of 1657. In February of 1657 the new community, represented by Antonio Fernandez Carvajal and Simon de Caceres, acquired land near Mile End for use as a Synagogue. Historian Todd Endelman makes the point that it is unlikely this activity could have happened without Cromwell’s permission that they could live as professing Jews. The informal nature of the resettlement also meant the forces ranged against it had no target and never united to form any significant opposition. Further, at a later date it meant there were no restrictive laws to repeal when Jews wanted fuller citizenship rights. By the end of the decade the number of Jewish families had risen to thirty five. In 1657 Solomon Dormido, a nephew of Menasseh Ben Israel, was admitted to the Royal Exchange as a duly licensed broker of the City of London, without taking the usual oath involving a statement of faith in Christianity (when he was finally sworn in in 1668, the oath was changed for him). Carvajal had previously been granted letters of denization for himself and his son, which guaranteed certain rights of citizenship.

== Debating the return of the Jews ==
During the years 1655–56 the question of the return of Jews to England was fought in a pamphlet war. Conservative opponents including William Prynne opposed the return while the Quaker Margaret Fell was in favour. Christian supporters believed the conversion of Jews was a sign of the end times and the readmission to England was a step towards that goal.

This method of debate had the advantage of not raising antisemitic feelings too strongly; and it likewise enabled Charles II, on his Restoration in 1660, to avoid taking any action on the petition of the merchants of London asking him to revoke Cromwell&#x27;s concession. He had been assisted during his exile by several Jews of royalist sympathies, such as Andrea Mendes da Costa (Chamberlain of Catherine of Braganza, wife of Charles II), Antonio Mendes (the physician brother of Andrea, who had cured Catherine of erysipelas while in Portugal) and Augustine Coronel-Chacon. In 1664 a further attempt was made by the Earl of Berkshire and Paul Ricaut to bring about the expulsion of the Jews, but the King-in-Council assured the latter of the continuance of former favour. Similar appeals to prejudice were made in 1673, when Jews, for meeting in Duke&#x27;s Place for a religious service, were indicted on a charge of rioting, and in 1685, when thirty-seven were arrested on the Royal Exchange; but the proceedings in both cases were put a stop to by direction of the Privy Council. The status of the Jews was still very indeterminate, with the Attorney-General declaring that they resided in England only under an implied licence. As a matter of fact, the majority of them were still legally aliens and liable to all the disabilities that condition carried with it.

== Help from and to Jews abroad ==
William III is reported to have been assisted in his ascent to the English throne by a loan of 2,000,000 guilders from Francisco Lopes Suasso (1614–1685) (of the well-known Lopes Suasso family), later made first Baron d&#x27;Avernas le Gras by Charles II of Spain. William did not interfere when in 1689 some of the chief Jewish merchants of London were forced to pay the duty levied on the goods of aliens, but he refused a petition from Jamaica to expel the Jews. William&#x27;s reign brought about a closer connection between the predominantly Sephardic communities of London and Amsterdam; this aided in the transfer of the European finance centre from the Dutch capital to the English capital. Over this time a small German Ashkenazi community had arrived and established their own synagogue in 1692, but they were of little mercantile consequence, and did not figure in the relations between the established Jewish community and the government. One of the rabbi was Solomon Ayllon.

Early in the eighteenth century the Jewish community of London comprised representatives of the chief Jewish financiers in northern Europe; these included the Mendez da Costa, Abudiente (later known as Gideon and Eardley), Salvador, Lopez, Fonseca, and Seixas families. The utility of these prominent Jewish merchants and financiers was widely recognised. Marlborough in particular made great use of the services of Sir Solomon de Medina, and indeed was publicly charged with taking an annual subvention from him. The early merchants of the resettlement are estimated to have brought with them a capital of £1,500,000 into the country; this amount is estimated to have increased to £5,000,000 by the middle of the 18th century.

As early as 1723 an act of Parliament, the Papists Act 1723 ([10 Geo. 1]]. c. 4), allowed Jews holding land to omit the words &quot;on the true faith of a Christian&quot;, when registering their title. Only once more would this allowance be made in the passage of the Plantation Act 1740, but more significantly the act allowed Jews who had or would have resided in British America for seven years to become naturalised British subjects.

Shortly afterwards a similar bill was introduced into the Irish Parliament, where it passed the Commons in 1745 and 1746, but failed to pass the Lords in 1747; it was ultimately dropped. Meanwhile, during the Jacobite rising of 1745 the Jews had shown particular loyalty to the government. Their chief financier, Samson Gideon, had strengthened the stock market, and several of the younger members had volunteered in the corps raised to defend London.

== In popular culture ==
The meeting between Menasseh Ben Israel and Oliver Cromwell was painted by Solomon Alexander Hart in 1873 and bought by Sir Francis Goldsmid.
The historical figure of Menasseh Ben Israel and the admission of Sephardic Jews from the Netherlands into England are featured in the novel &quot;The Weight of Ink&quot; by Rachel Kadish (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2017.).

<text>Dr. Hermann Iseke (9 March 1856 in Holungen, Province of Saxony – 14 January 1907 in South West Africa, now Namibia) was a German minister in military service.

== Education ==
He was born on 9 March 1856 in Holungen, in the Prussian Province of Saxony, where he attended the elementary school at that time. He received his first Latin instruction from the Kaplan (chaplain) at that time Andreas Raabe, a well-known language researcher. From 1867 to 1873 he attended a gymnasium in Heiligenstadt and Mühlhausen where in 1874, he successfully passed out. Subsequently, he began studying jurisprudence at the Universities of Würzburg (1873–74), Leipzig (1874–75), Göttingen (1876–78) and Greifswald (1878). Here, he made the first legal state examination, attained a doctorate in Jena to the Dr. jur. and worked as a junior lawyer in Duderstadt and Künzelsau. He then decided upon a change of direction, went to cathedrals and studied philosophy and Germanistik (1879–1880). In 1880, he attended Freiburg, Breslau, now Wrocław and Münster for theology.

==Career==
In 1892, he joined the military welfare service. As a military minister, he worked in the garrisons of Metz, Hanover and Mühlhausen and in Alsace, later went on a punitive expedition to China from 1900 to 1902, and then he visited the western states of North America. Later he worked again as a military minister in Kassel and Saarbrücken before 1905. In 1907 he went to the Southern Africa area. The unhealthy climate was a big strain and it was hard for an otherwise strong man to cope with the environment. Dr. Hermann Iseke died on 14 January 1907 in Southwest Africa, present-day Namibia, of malaria. His body was transferred in the summer of 1907 to his hometown, Holungen.

==Poet==
Dr. Hermann Iseke not only work as a pastoral minister (Seelsorger), but also as a poet. These seals gave him an honorary title of: &quot;Dichter des Eichsfeldes&quot; = poets of Eichsfeld. Probably in the year 1902, he wrote in Eichsfeld admitted &quot;Eichsfelder Sang&quot;, but this was not his only work. Beside many smaller poems he wrote two larger documents (&quot;Der lieben heiligen Elisabeth won Thüringen&quot; and under the pseudonym &quot;Bernadus Amerikanus&quot; out of Eichsfeld in history and legend&quot;).

== Honors ==

The city of Heiligenstadt designated a road after himself, in his place of birth, Holungen is honoured Gedenkstein was established and the association for local history carries his name, the &quot;Dr. Hermann Iseke Holungen&quot;.#

<text>Drownproofing is a method for surviving in water disaster scenarios without sinking or drowning. It is also famous as a class once required at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

==History==
Drownproofing was developed by swimming coach Fred Lanoue, known to students as Crankshaft because of his limping gait. It was first taught in 1940. His method was so successful that it gained national recognition, and Georgia Tech soon made it a requirement for graduation, until 1988. The US Navy also took interest, and adopted it as part of their standard training. It is claimed that during Lanoue&#x27;s time teaching at Tech from 1936 to 1964, he taught drownproofing to some 20,000 students.

Once they had mastered the Drownproofing technique, students learned to stay afloat with their wrists and ankles bound, swim underwater, and retrieve diving rings from the bottom of the pool using their teeth. Lanoue published a book called &quot;Drownproofing, a New Technique for Water Safety&quot; in 1963. Georgia Tech dropped the course from its curriculum in 1988, as part of a downsizing of its physical education and athletics department.

Drownproofing has been for many years widely taught to recruits in the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard.

Reagh &quot;Doc&quot; Wetmore, swimming coach at Boston University, shared Fred Lanoue&#x27;s enthusiasm for Drownproofing and continued to teach the technique until his retirement at the end of 2005.

==Technique==
In Drownproofing terminology, the great majority of people are &quot;floaters&quot;. That is to say that, with the lungs fully inflated (or say at total lung capacity), they have slightly less specific gravity than water and will not start to sink until they exhale. An average floater has of positive buoyancy in fresh water. &quot;Sinkers&quot; can also benefit from a modified technique, but will find it more difficult to learn and will probably need specialised coaching.

In the Drownproofing survival technique, the subject floats in a relaxed, near-vertical posture, with the top of the head just above the surface. Using the arms or legs to exert a downward pressure, the subject raises himself sufficiently so that the mouth is above the surface and a breath is taken, before dropping back into the relaxed float. This is done several times a minute (typically between 5 and 10), depending upon the needs of the individual. It is important to keep the lungs fully inflated for the maximum possible time and to exhale and inhale rapidly when a breath is taken.
The technique is easy to learn and does not require arduous training or a high standard of physical fitness. With practice, it is possible to remain afloat in this way for a long time with minimal effort. Lanoue taught his students to perform the technique with hands and feet tied, thus demonstrating that it is possible to survive even when injured or otherwise disabled.

==Criticism==

The main criticism of Drownproofing is that, with the body almost totally immersed, heat loss will be greater than with vigorous swimming or treading water, with the consequent earlier onset of hypothermia. But other sources suggest that heat loss is increased by vigorous action, because it displaces relatively warmer water that is trapped by the subject&#x27;s clothing. In any cold water situation, the main objective should be to get out of the water and find shelter and dry clothing. In any case, Drownproofing should never be regarded as a substitute for the normal safety precautions recommended for any water activity.

The effects of heat loss can be reduced by using the Heat Escape Lessening Posture (H.E.L.P). The Heat Escape Lessening Posture was designed for use with a Personal Flotation Device. Essentially the person grabs their knees to reduce the surface area exposed to the water and centralize body heat. It can be adapted and used as part of the drownproofing technique but is far more challenging due to the physical exertion required to hold your body in this shape, and the near impossibility of keeping your legs pressed to your torso while your hands are bound behind your back.
