<text>Étienne Daho (; ; born 14 January 1956) is a French singer-songwriter. He has released a number of synth-driven and rock-surf influenced pop hit singles since 1981.

== Career ==
Daho was born in Oran, French Algeria. He sings in a low, whispery voice somewhat akin to Leonard Cohen or Chet Baker and his music established him as a pop cult hero. He cites Serge Gainsbourg, The Velvet Underground, The Beach Boys and Syd Barrett as his musical influences. All his albums have been certified at least gold or platinum, including &quot;Mythomane&quot; in 1981, &quot;La notte, la notte&quot; in 1984, &quot;Pop satori&quot; in 1986, produced with a young William Orbit, &quot;Pour nos vies martiennes&quot; in 1988 and the double platinum &quot;Paris ailleurs&quot; in 1991, recorded in New York.

A best-selling recording artist in his own right in France, Daho is best known in Britain for his appearance on the number 11 Saint Etienne hit single &quot;He&#x27;s on the Phone&quot;, which is an English-language adaptation of his 1984 French-language big hit &quot;Weekend à Rome&quot;. He also collaborated with Saint Etienne on the &quot;Reserection EP&quot;, his album &quot;Eden&quot;, and his single hit &quot;Le Premier Jour&quot;.

Daho&#x27;s collaborations and productions both on stage and in the studio with other artists have been extensive. He has worked with Brigitte Fontaine, Arthur Baker, Air, Working Week, &#x27;80&#x27;s new wave bands OMD and Comateens, Jane Birkin, Marianne Faithfull, Françoise Hardy, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Vanessa Paradis, Dani and more. His music has also been remixed, among others, by Air, Fischerspooner, Amon Tobin and William Orbit.

Daho&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;Eden&quot; displayed a diverse array of electronic-oriented songs that included downtempo ballads, drum and bass-influenced tracks, and Hi-NRG dance. He duetted with Astrud Gilberto (&quot;Les bords de Seine&quot;) and was accompanied by The Swingle Singers on &quot;Timide intimité&quot;. Backing vocals on several songs were provided by Lyn Byrd of the Comateens, Sarah Cracknell (who co-wrote &quot;Les passagers&quot;), and Elli Medeiros.

&quot;Eden&quot; was subsequently re-released for the anglophone market with great reviews with the song &quot;A New World&quot;, which was an English-language version of &quot;Au Commencement&quot;. Daho performed in a sold out Institute of Contemporary Arts. He also sang at the Marquee in 1989.

After a double platinum greatest hits compilation &quot;Best of Singles&quot; in 1998, the number one &quot;Corps &amp; armes&quot; in 2000 saw Daho eschewing electronics in favour of a more orchestral sound fuelled by traditional instruments: piano, acoustic guitar, horns, directed by Wil Malone. One of the tracks included an English-language duet with Vanessa Daou (&quot;Make Believe&quot;). It includes also &quot;Le brasier&quot;, &quot;La baie&quot; and &quot;Ouverture&quot;.

Daho shifted gears once again for his dark and moody 2004 album &quot;Réévolution&quot;, which featured a guitar-heavy rock sound. He released the single hit &quot;If&quot; with Charlotte Gainsbourg as well as the Phil Spector influenced &quot;Retour à toi&quot; and &quot;Les liens d&#x27;Eros&quot; with Marianne Faithfull, reading her great uncle Leopold von Sacher-Masoch&#x27;s &quot;Venus in furs&quot;.

In 2005, Daho released a live album &quot;Sortir Ce Soir&quot;, which featured many of his greatest hits performed in concert.

In 2007, his new album, &quot;L&#x27;Invitation&quot;, which was created with Edith Fambuena, was released to good press reviews. In 2008, a compilation of covers was released, called &quot;Tombés pour Daho&quot; (after Daho&#x27;s single, &quot;Tombé pour la France&quot;). The recording artists include Benjamin Biolay, Doriand, Elli Medeiros, Daniel Darc, and Arnold Turboust. In the same year, on 8 March, Daho received a &quot;Victoire de la Musique&quot; award in the category Album Pop / Rock of the Year.

&quot;Les Chansons de l&#x27;innocence retrouvée&quot; was released in 2013 and was a critical success in France, being included in several best end-of-year lists, including &quot;Les Inrockuptibles&quot; and &quot;Télérama&quot;.

For record sleeves and music videos, Daho has collaborated with Pierre et Gilles, Michel Gondry, Nick Knight, Doug Nichol, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, M/M, Abake, Inez van Lamsweerde and Guy Peellaert among others.

In 2016, Daho was invited by John Cale to sing &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Mirror&quot; at the 50th anniversary celebration of &quot;The Velvet Underground and Nico&quot; at the Philharmonie de Paris.

<text>Benjamin Biolay (; born 20 January 1973) is a French singer, musician, songwriter, record producer and actor. He is the brother of singer Coralie Clément—whose first three albums he wrote and produced—and the ex-husband of Chiara Mastroianni, the daughter of Catherine Deneuve and Marcello Mastroianni.

His low-key vocal style is somewhat similar to French pop star Étienne Daho. With the singer Keren Ann, whose first two albums he co-wrote and produced, he contributed several songs to &quot;Chambre avec Vue&quot;, the successful comeback album of singer Henri Salvador, and has since worked as a writer, arranger or producer for other icons of French music, including Juliette Gréco, Julien Clerc, Françoise Hardy, Vanessa Paradis and Nolwenn Leroy.

He wrote or performed most of the songs on the 2004 soundtrack to &quot;Clara et Moi&quot; by Arnaud Viard, and released the album &quot;Home&quot; with his wife the same year. After two more rock oriented albums in 2005 and 2007 he was dropped by his record company and began working on his first independent release, &quot;La Superbe&quot;, released on Naïve records in 2009. This was followed by the soundtrack album &quot;Pourquoi tu pleures&quot; in 2011 and &quot;Vengeance&quot; in 2012.

== Personal life ==
Benjamin was married to actress and singer Chiara Mastroianni from 2002 to 2005; they have a daughter, Anna, born 22 April 2003.

<doc id="1007009" wikidata="Q7751365" url="?curid=1007009" title="The Mighty Kong">
<text>The Mighty Kong is a 1998 American animated monster musical film. It is an adaptation of the classic &quot;King Kong&quot; story, produced by Lana Productions and is the seventh entry in the &quot;King Kong&quot; franchise. Jodi Benson and Dudley Moore (in his final role before his death in 2002) headed its cast of voice actors. The film was animated overseas by the South Korean animation studios including Hahn Shin Corporation, and by Jade Animation in Hong Kong. It features original songs by the Sherman Brothers. 

The film was initially given a limited theatrical release before being released on VHS on June 16, 1998 by Warner Home Video as a part of their &quot;75th Anniversary&quot; promotion. It was released on DVD by Tri-Coast Entertainment in 2019 as a Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) release that is only available through online stores. The film is currently available on multiple streaming platforms such as Tubi and Vimeo.

==Plot==

Ann Darrow, a down-on-her-luck actress looking for work, meets film director Carl Denham/C.B., who offers her a job in a new film. They board the Venture to leave for the film shoot. Ann meets a sailor boy named Rick and his Monkey Chips, she later meets Jack Driscoll after he saved her from almost being crushed by cargo. They arrive at Skull island and after a run-in with the natives, they have Ann sacrificed to the giant gorilla King Kong who makes off with her into the jungle. Together, they fight a Tyrannosaurus, Pterodactylus and a Gigantophis. Jack rescues Ann and Kong becomes unconscious by a gas bomb.

The film then follows Kong&#x27;s escape from C.B.&#x27;s theater and rampage of New York City. Kong takes Ann up on top of the Empire State Building with Jack in pursuit. The biplanes come and attack Kong with guns, but miss most of the time. When all the planes have been knocked down, the army sends two blimps with a net in between them to catch Kong. They catch him successfully. Kong tries to get out of the net, but the net rips and when Kong reaches for Ann, he falls from the net and plummets to the streets of New York. However, Kong survives the fall.

After surviving the fall, Kong was either allowed to roam free in a thousand acres of land in southern New Jersey, or released on a private island.

<text>Carlotta Monti (January 25, 1907 – December 8, 1993) was an American film actress, who was W. C. Fields&#x27; companion in his last years.

Born Carlotta Montijo in Los Angeles, Monti appeared in B-movies and uncredited bit parts, including &quot;Kiss of Araby&quot; (1933), &quot;Tarzan the Fearless&quot; (1933) and &quot;Night Cargo&quot; (1936). She met Fields in 1932, and their relationship lasted until his death in 1946. She had small roles in his films &quot;Man on the Flying Trapeze&quot; (1935) and &quot;Never Give a Sucker an Even Break&quot; (1941).

Monti died of complications from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in December, 1993 at the age of 86.

==Memoir==
Monti&#x27;s best-selling memoir &quot;W. C. Fields &amp; Me&quot;, published in 1971, described her life and experiences with Fields. It was adapted for the 1976 film &quot;W.C.

<doc id="1007021" wikidata="Q1431385" url="?curid=1007021" title="Louise Attaque">
<text>Louise Attaque () is a French chanson/folk rock band founded in 1994. Several of the group&#x27;s albums were produced by Gordon Gano, lead singer of Violent Femmes, a band whom Louise Attaque often cites as an influence and for whom their own band is named. The band is signed to the Atmosphériques record label.

==History==
===Caravage (1990-1994)===
Lead singer and guitarist Gaëtan Roussel and bassist Robin Feix met in high school in Montargis. They moved to Paris after graduation where they met drummer Alexandre Margraff and formed a rock band named Caravage (after the Italian painter Caravaggio). After briefly hiring a lead guitarist, the band met violinist Arnaud Samuel while recording in a Parisian studio.

===Louise Attaque&#x27;s success (1997-2001)===
Louise Attaque was formed in 1994. The name means &quot;Louise Attacks&quot; in French and refers to Louise Michel, a 19th-century anarchist, and to the American rock band Violent Femmes (which loosely translates from French as &quot;violent women&quot;). The leader of Violent Femmes, Gordon Gano, produced Louise Attaque&#x27;s self-titled debut album.

&quot;Louise Attaque&quot; was released in April 1997 to a positive critical response. Despite low initial radio airplay, the reputation of the group spread rapidly, garnering particular praise for its innovative violin-based folk/rock compositions and witty lyrics. &quot;Louise Attaque&quot; sold 2.5 million copies in France, a record for a French rock album.

It took almost three years until Louise Attaque&#x27;s second album &quot;Comme On A Dit&quot; was released (in January 2000), again produced by Gordon Gano. The album sold 700,000 copies in France. In 2001, after touring for five months and appearing at various rock festivals, the band split up, explaining that they were temporarily out of inspiration and tired of the hype and pressure surrounding them.

===From separation to reunion (2001-2005)===
Louise Attaque split into two different groups in 2001. Singer Gaëtan Roussel and violinist Arnaud Samuel formed Tarmac, while bassist Robin Feix and drummer Alexandre Margraff formed Ali Dragon. The goal of Tarmac was to explore the starker sounds of acoustic instruments, while Ali Dragon produced underground experimental music featuring jam sessions (mostly electro and hip hop).

The four members of the group reunited in 2003. After recording for a few weeks in the Electric Lady Studios in New York, their third album, &quot;À Plus Tard Crocodile&quot;, was released in September 2005. The title references the rock and roll song &quot;See You Later Alligator&quot;. &quot;À Plus Tard Crocodile&quot; was received as a departure from Louise Attaque&#x27;s previous works, with lighter and more varied content.

==Usage in media==
Louise Attaque are mentioned during &quot;À plus !&quot;, a German language school book teaching French. During the &quot;Civilisation&quot; part of the book, they are described as &quot;a rock band which is well-known by French teens [...]&quot;.

In 2021, the song &quot;J&#x27;t&#x27;emmène au vent&quot; is used in &quot;No Time to Die&quot; in the opening scene which is listened by the young Madeleine on her walkman.

==Awards==
* 1999: Victoire de la musique in the category Band of the Year.
* 2001: Victoire de la musique in the category &quot;Rock Album of the Year&quot; for the album &quot;Comme on a dit&quot;.
* 2006: Victoire de la musique in the category &quot;Pop/rock Album of the Year&quot; for the album &quot;À Plus Tard Crocodile&quot;.

<text>Project Longshot was a conceptual interstellar spacecraft design. It would have been an uncrewed starship (about 400 tonnes), intended to fly to and enter orbit around Alpha Centauri B powered by nuclear pulse propulsion.

==History==
Developed by the US Naval Academy and NASA, from 1987 to 1988, Longshot was designed to be built at Space Station &quot;Freedom&quot;, the precursor to the existing International Space Station. Similar to Project Daedalus, Longshot was designed with existing technology in mind, although some development would have been required; for example, the Project Longshot concept assumes &quot;a three-order-of-magnitude leap over current propulsion technology&quot;.

==Mission==
Unlike Daedalus, which used an open-cycle fusion engine, Longshot would use a long-lived nuclear fission reactor for power. Initially generating 300 kilowatts, the reactor would power a number of lasers in the engine that would be used to ignite inertial confinement fusion similar to that in Daedalus. The main design difference is that Daedalus also relied on the fusion reaction to power the ship, whereas in the Longshot design the internal reactor would provide this power.

The reactor would also be used to power a laser for communications back to Earth, with a maximum power of 250 kW. For most of the journey, this would be used at a much lower power for sending data about the interstellar medium; but during the flyby, the main engine section would be discarded and the entire power capacity dedicated to communications at about 1 kilobit per second.

Longshot would have a mass of at the start of the mission including 264 tonnes of helium-3/deuterium pellet fuel/propellant. The active mission payload, which includes the fission reactor but not the discarded main propulsion section, would have a mass of around 30 tonnes.

A difference in the mission architecture between Longshot and the Daedalus study is that Longshot would go into orbit about the target star, while the higher-speed Daedalus would do a one shot fly-by lasting a comparatively short time.

A travel to Alpha Centauri with a Longshot spacecraft would take about one century.

<text>Aloys I (Aloys Josef Johannes Nepomuk Melchior; 14 May 1759 – 24 March 1805) was the Prince of Liechtenstein from 18 August 1781 until his death in 1805. He was born in Vienna, the third son of Franz Josef I, Prince of Liechtenstein.

Aloys was enlisted in the military as a youth but withdrew due to poor health. His great interest was forestry and gardening and had many trees from overseas planted around his manors for both economic and aesthetic reasons. He also decorated Eisgrub Park with ornamental buildings.
Aloys I supported mining operations within his lands in Moravia in order to raise money. This included the construction of an ironworks at Olomouc.

Aloys I also expanded the Liechtenstein library through the purchase of complete collections of books. Aloys I had the architect Joseph Hardtmuth design a new palace in Herrengasse, Vienna. He hired a seasonal theater group and a permanent music group.

During his reign, Liechtenstein carried out the last execution in its history when Barbara Erni was beheaded in Eschen for theft.

He was the 836th Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in Austria.

Aloys married Karoline Gräfin von Manderscheid-Blankenheim (14 November 1768, in Köln – 11 June 1831, in Vienna) in Feldsberg on 15 November/16 November 1783. The couple were childless. Following Aloys&#x27; death in Vienna, Liechtenstein went to his brother Johann I.

<doc id="1007039" wikidata="Q6780239" url="?curid=1007039" title="Mary Mapes">
<text>Mary Alice Mapes (born May 9, 1956) is an American journalist, former television news producer, and author. She was a principal producer for CBS News, primarily the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; and primetime television program &quot;60 Minutes Wednesday&quot;. She is known for the story of the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse scandal, which won a Peabody Award, and the story of Senator Strom Thurmond&#x27;s unacknowledged biracial daughter, Essie Mae Washington. In 2005, she was fired from CBS for her part in the Killian documents controversy.

==Early life==
Mapes was born on May 9, 1956, in Burlington, Washington and grew up there with four sisters. Both of her parents were Republicans. After graduating from Burlington-Edison High School in 1974, Mapes studied communications and political science at the University of Washington. Following her time at the UW, she worked at CBS affiliate KIRO-TV in Seattle during the 1980s. While a producer there, she met her future husband, KIRO reporter Mark Wrolstad. They married in 1987.

==At CBS==
In 1989, Mapes went to work for CBS News in Dallas, Texas. She was hired by CBS in 1999 as a producer assigned to Dan Rather and the program &quot;60 Minutes Wednesday&quot;.

At &quot;60 Minutes Wednesday&quot;, Mapes produced the story that announced the US military&#x27;s investigation of the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, and the story that exposed Strom Thurmond&#x27;s unacknowledged bi-racial daughter, Essie Mae Washington, winning a Peabody Award in 2005 for the former.

===Killian documents controversy===

Mary Mapes produced a segment for &quot;60 Minutes Wednesday&quot; that aired criticism of President George W. Bush&#x27;s military service, supported by documents purportedly from the files of Bush&#x27;s commanding officer, the late Lieutenant Colonel Jerry B Killian. Those documents had been delivered to CBS from Bill Burkett, who was a retired Lt. Colonel with the Texas Army National Guard. During the segment, Dan Rather asserted that the documents had been authenticated by document experts, but ultimately, CBS could neither confirm nor definitively refute their authenticity. Moreover, CBS did not have any original documents, only faxed copies, as Burkett claimed to have burned the originals.

The &quot;60 Minutes&quot; report charged that Bush, the son of an ambassador, congressman and future president, had received preferential treatment in passing over hundreds of applicants In applying to the Texas Air National Guard. Then-Texas Lieutenant Governor Ben Barnes said he had made phone calls to get Bush into the Guard.

After the report was aired, it was immediately the subject of harsh criticism, especially when a key document could not be authenticated. As a result of the controversy over the use of the documents, CBS ordered an independent internal investigation. The panel in charge of investigation was composed of Dick Thornburgh, former governor of Pennsylvania and United States Attorney General in the George H. W. Bush administration, and Louis Boccardi, retired president and CEO of the Associated Press. The Thornburgh-Boccardi report said that some of Bush&#x27;s former instructors or colleagues had told Mapes that Bush told them he wanted to go to Vietnam, but that he could not go because there were others ahead of him with more seniority.

Mapes was criticized for failing to air them in the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; report to balance the allegation that Bush had applied for service in the Guard to avoid serving in Vietnam. Mapes was also faulted for calling Joe Lockhart, a senior official in the John Kerry campaign, prior to the airing of the piece, and offering to put her source, Bill Burkett, in touch with him. However, Mapes stated that Burkett had asked her to give his phone number to someone in the Kerry camp to discuss the Swift Boat campaign for which she had asked permission. She has said, in retrospect, she would not have done it. Lockhart and Burkett also stated that the conversation had nothing to do with CBS&#x27;s report or the documents, but to do with the Swift Boat campaign.

Following the investigation, Mapes, along with others involved, were accused of lapses in judgment. Her 15-year tenure at CBS ended when she was fired as a result of the scandal.

Although the panel did not determine the memos were fraudulent, it stated &quot;there remains substantial questions&quot; regarding their authenticity. According to the panel, a &quot;myopic zeal&quot; to be the first news outlet to broadcast an unprecedented story about the president&#x27;s National Guard service was a &quot;key factor in explaining why CBS News had produced a story that was neither fair nor accurate and did not meet the organization&#x27;s internal standards.&quot; The panel proclaimed that at least four factors contributed to the decision to broadcast the report: &quot;The combination of a new &quot;60 Minutes Wednesday&quot; management team, great deference given to a highly respected producer and the network&#x27;s news anchor, competitive pressures, and a zealous belief in the truth of the segment&quot;. The panel also stated that it &quot;cannot conclude that a political agenda at &quot;60 Minutes Wednesday&quot; drove either the timing of the airing of the segment or its content.&quot; Mapes was terminated by CBS in January 2005. Asked to resign were Senior Vice President Betsy West, who supervised CBS News primetime programs; &quot;60 Minutes Wednesday&quot; Executive Producer Josh Howard; and Howard&#x27;s deputy, Senior Broadcast Producer Mary Murphy.

Mapes said she did not think her actions were faultless, but she stood by the story. She said that the authenticity of the documents had been corroborated by an unnamed key source and that journalists often have to rely on photo-copied documents as the basis for verifying a story. Moreover, Burkett admitted lying to Mapes and the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; team regarding the source of the documents.

In an interview with &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Mapes said Karl Rove was &quot;an inspirational figure&quot; for the critics of the segment. Rove called Mapes&#x27; work &quot;the gift that keeps on giving&quot; due to the story&#x27;s lurid foundations and the apparent boost it gave to President Bush during his reelection campaign. Some Democratic critics of Bush, such as Terry McAuliffe and Maurice Hinchey, suggested that the memos originated from the Bush campaign with the purpose of discrediting the media&#x27;s unveiling of Bush&#x27;s National Guard service and changing the conversation from subjects like the Iraq War, singling out Rove, Ralph Reed and Roger Stone. Rove and Stone denied involvement.

== Book and film adaptation ==
In 2005, Mapes&#x27; book &quot;Truth and Duty: The Press, the President, and the Privilege of Power&quot; was published. It was adapted into the 2015 film &quot;Truth&quot;, about the Killian documents controversy, starring Cate Blanchett as Mapes and Robert Redford as Dan Rather.

==Writing career==
In the aftermath of the Rathergate scandal, Mapes started work as a writer and a consultant, contributing to the news magazine &quot;The Nation&quot; in 2007 and 2008.

In the May 2016 edition of &quot;D Magazine&quot;, Mapes wrote a story about Henry Wade&#x27;s 1954 conviction of Tommy Lee Walker.

<text>Bentley Little (born 1960 in Mesa, Arizona) is an American author of horror fiction. Publishing an average of a novel a year since 1990, Little avoids publicity and rarely does promotional work or interviews for his writing.

==Early life==
Little is an Arizona native who, according to his professional biography, was born one month after his mother saw the world premiere of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s film &quot;Psycho&quot;. He studied at California State University Fullerton, from which he earned a BA in Communications and an MA in Comparative Literature. His thesis for the latter was his first novel, &quot;The Revelation&quot;, which was later published and won a Bram Stoker Award.

==Style and recognition==
Little&#x27;s novels tend to have brief titles (many use the construction &quot;The [noun]&quot;, like &quot;The Mailman&quot; and &quot;The House&quot;) and fall squarely into the horror genre. He dislikes his work being categorized as &quot;suspense&quot; or &quot;supernatural thriller&quot;, preferring the more straightforward genre label. His work has been championed by Stephen King and Dean Koontz, leading to increased recognition.

==Adaptations==
In 2007 Little&#x27;s short story &quot;The Washingtonians&quot; was adapted for the TV show &quot;Masters of Horror&quot;, becoming the twelfth episode of its second season. Directed by Peter Medak, it significantly lightened the tone of the author&#x27;s original work, aiming for camp over the short story&#x27;s dark humour. It was negatively received by critics.

That same year &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; announced that a film adaptation of the novel &quot;The Store&quot; was in development at Strike Entertainment, with a script by Jenna McGrath, production duties handled by Marc Abraham and Eric Newman, and executive production by Vince Gerardis, Eli Kirschner, and Tom Bliss. As of 2020 the project has not yet come to fruition.

On November 18, 2021, it was revealed that a TV series based on Little&#x27;s novel &quot;The Consultant&quot; has been ordered by Amazon Prime Video.

<doc id="1007062" wikidata="Q3064601" url="?curid=1007062" title="Superior temporal gyrus">
<text>The superior temporal gyrus (STG) is one of three (sometimes two) gyri in the temporal lobe of the human brain, which is located laterally to the head, situated somewhat above the external ear.

The superior temporal gyrus is bounded by:
* the lateral sulcus above;
* the superior temporal sulcus (not always present or visible) below;
* an imaginary line drawn from the preoccipital notch to the lateral sulcus posteriorly.

The superior temporal gyrus contains several important structures of the brain, including:
* Brodmann areas 41 and 42, marking the location of the auditory cortex, the cortical region responsible for the sensation of sound;
* Wernicke&#x27;s area, Brodmann area 22, an important region for the processing of speech so that it can be understood as language.

The superior temporal gyrus contains the auditory cortex, which is responsible for processing sounds. Specific sound frequencies map precisely onto the auditory cortex. This auditory (or tonotopic) map is similar to the homunculus map of the primary motor cortex. Some areas of the superior temporal gyrus are specialized for processing combinations of frequencies, and other areas are specialized for processing changes in amplitude or frequency. The superior temporal gyrus also includes Wernicke&#x27;s area, which (in most people) is located in the left hemisphere. It is the major area involved in the comprehension of language. The superior temporal gyrus is involved in auditory processing, including language, but also has been implicated as a critical structure in social cognition.

Various parts of the STG might be referred to as anterior (aSTG), middle (mSTG), and posterior (pSTG).

==Function==
The superior temporal gyrus has been involved in the perception of emotions in facial stimuli.
) Furthermore, the superior temporal gyrus is an essential structure involved in auditory processing, as well as in the function of language in individuals who may have an impaired vocabulary, or are developing a sense of language. The superior temporal gyrus has been discovered to be an important structure in the pathway consisting of the amygdala and prefrontal cortex, which are all involved in social cognition processes. Including the superior temporal gyrus, areas more anterior and dorsal within the temporal lobe have been linked to the ability of processing information the many changeable characteristics of a face. Research conducted with the use of neuroimaging have found patients with schizophrenia have structural abnormalities in their superior temporal gyrus.

fMRI analysis has evidenced a link between insight based problem solving and activity in the right anterior superior-temporal gyrus, specifically in relation to the sudden flash of understanding commonly referred to as an &#x27;Aha!&#x27; moment.

===Social context===
The superior temporal gyrus (STG) is important for language comprehension, but studies also suggest that it plays a functional role in the cocktail party effect. A magnetoencephalography study was conducted on participants that were exposed to five differing listening conditions each with a different level of background noise. It was discovered that the STG has a strong connection with the attended speech stream in a cocktail party setting. When the attended speech stream wasn’t disrupted by background noise a bilateral connection was displayed, but as more background noise was introduced the connection became left-hemisphere-dependent.

<text>Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay is a base of the United States Navy located adjacent to the city of St. Marys in Camden County, Georgia, on the East River in southeastern Georgia, and from Jacksonville, Florida. The Submarine Base is the U.S. Atlantic Fleet&#x27;s home port for U.S. Navy Fleet ballistic missile nuclear submarines capable of being armed with Trident missile nuclear weapons. This submarine base covers about of land, of which are protected wetlands.

==History==

===The early years===
Archaeological research has revealed a pre-Columbian era Indian presence throughout the area, dating back thousands of years.

Early in the 19th century, much of what is now the submarine base was the site of several plantations, including Cherry Point, Harmony Hall, New Canaan, Marianna and Kings Bay. Beginning in the 1790s, Thomas King built a plantation along the bay. John Houston McIntosh built a considerably larger plantation known as New Canaan, where he grew cotton and sugar cane.

The plantation system declined following the Civil War, and the land was broken up into smaller holdings. No residents were paid the going rate for the land that was used to build the submarine base. One land owner was paid four thousand dollars for 62 acres (25 ha) of deep water land. Such residents harvested shrimp, fish and other seafood, and trapped and hunted to supplement small-scale farming of corn, sugar and other vegetables.

===The Army years===
The US Army began to acquire of land at Kings Bay in 1954 to build a military ocean terminal to ship ammunition in case of a national emergency. Construction began in 1955 and was completed in 1958. A 200-foot-wide channel was dredged to Cumberland Sound, and included two turning basins.

The most prominent feature of the terminal was its , concrete-and-steel wharf (600 m × 26 m). It had three parallel railroad tracks, enabling the simultaneous loading of several ammunition ships from rail cars and trucks.

Elsewhere on the base, the Army laid of railroad tracks. Spurs off the main line ran into temporary storage areas protected by earthen barricades. These mounds of dirt, still prominent features in many areas of the base, were designed to localize damage in case of explosive accidents.

It was soon realized that there was no immediate operational need for the installation, so it was placed in an inactive ready status, and Blue Star Shipping Company signed a lease to use the wharf in 1959.

Although the army post was never activated to serve its primary purpose, it was used twice for other missions. In 1964, as Hurricane Dora hammered the area, nearly 100 area residents were sheltered aboard base. Also, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, an Army Transportation Battalion of 1,100 personnel and 70 small boats took up position at Kings Bay.

===The Navy years===
The chain of events that led to submarine operations at Kings Bay began in 1975. At that time, treaty negotiations between Spain and the United States were in progress. A proposed change to the United States naval basing agreement with Spain included the withdrawal of the fleet ballistic-missile submarine squadron, Submarine Squadron 16, from its operational base at Rota, Spain, northwest of Gibraltar, giving easy access to Atlantic Ocean patrol areas. Anticipating that this would take place, Chief of Naval Operations James L. Holloway III ordered studies to select a new refit site on the East Coast of the United States.

In January 1976, the negotiators initialed a draft treaty between Spain and the United States. It called for withdrawal of the submarine squadron from Rota by July 1979. The U.S. Senate ratified the treaty in June 1976.

After review, Kings Bay was selected in November 1976, shortly after the election of Georgian Jimmy Carter as President. Soon afterward, the first Navy personnel arrived in the Kings Bay area and started preparations for the transfer of property from the Army to the Navy. &quot;Naval Submarine Support Base Kings Bay&quot; was established in a developmental status 1 July 1978. The base—now &quot;Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay&quot;, not only occupies the former Army terminal land, but several thousand additional acres.

Preparations for the arrival of the submarine squadron went forward throughout the remainder of 1978 and into 1979. Commander Submarine Squadron 16 greeted the submarine tender , when it arrived at Kings Bay on 2 July 1979. Four days later, entered Kings Bay and moored alongside &quot;Simon Lake&quot;″s starboard side to begin a routine refit in preparation for another nuclear weapons deterrence patrol. Kings Bay has been an operating submarine base ever since that time.

In May 1979, the U.S. Navy selected Kings Bay as its preferred East Coast site for the new Trident submarines. On 23 October 1980, after a one-year environmental impact study was completed, and with Congressional approval, the Secretary of the Navy announced that Kings Bay would be the future home port for the new Trident-missile submarines in the Atlantic Ocean.

The decision to base the Trident submarines at Kings Bay started the largest peacetime construction program ever undertaken by the U.S. Navy. The program took nine years to complete at a cost of about $1.3 billion. The building project included the construction of three major commands: Trident Training Facility (TTF), Trident Refit Facility (TRF), and Strategic Weapons Facility, Atlantic (SWFLANT).

On 15 January 1989, the first Trident submarine, , arrived at Kings Bay. She was followed by later that same year. was commissioned at Kings Bay in October 1990, and she was followed by in July 1991; in June 1992; in July 1993; in July 1994; in August 1995, and in July 1996. The commissioning of in September 1997 gave Kings Bay its maximum number of ten Trident submarines.

In late March 1990, the Trident II (D-5) missile made its first deterrent patrol on board the USS &quot;Tennessee&quot;.

==== Post Cold-War Era ====
The end of the Cold War and the reorganization of Naval and Air Force strategic weapons forces during the 1990s had a significant effect on the submarine base at Kings Bay. A high-level nuclear weapons policy review recommended that the U.S. Navy reduce its number of Trident Fleet Ballistic Missile submarines from 18 to 14 by 2005.

The decision was made to temporarily decommission the four oldest &quot;Ohio&quot;-class Trident missile submarines for extensive shipyard work in order to convert them into guided-missile submarines (SSGNs) carrying large numbers (about 150) of conventionally armed Tomahawk cruise missiles. These converted submarines also have accommodations for significant numbers of Navy SEALs or Marines.

Furthermore, several Trident submarines were transferred from the Atlantic Fleet to the Pacific Fleet. USS &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; departed on 4 August 2003 and USS &quot;Kentucky&quot; departed on 24 August 2003, bound for the Trident submarine base at Bangor, Washington, as part of balancing the Trident fleet. In addition, both USS &quot;Louisiana&quot; and USS &quot;Maine&quot; were transferred to the Pacific Fleet in 2005.

USS &quot;Florida&quot; and USS &quot;Georgia&quot; completed their conversions into guided missile submarines in 2006 and 2008, respectively, and now have their home port at the Kings Bay Submarine Base.

==== Anti-War Protest ====
On April 4, 2018, seven anti-war activists were arrested after breaking into the naval base and committing acts of vandalism after recording themselves dumping fake-blood on the ground while holding banners, spray painting anti-war and anti-nuclear slogans on facility walls and destroying equipment. The activists, calling themselves the Kings Bay Plowshares 7, were found guilty of three felonies and one misdemeanor.

==Major Commands at Kings Bay==

===Submarine Group 10===
Submarine Group 10 was commissioned January 1, 1989, and is the senior command at Kings Bay. Group 10 is a subordinate command to Commander Submarine Force U.S. Atlantic Fleet. It exercises command over various commands and units assigned, including operational and administrative control of the &quot;Ohio&quot;-class submarines based at Submarine Base Kings Bay.

Group 10 is the local coordinating authority for all matters assigned by the submarine force commander and exercises direct control over the administration and training of submarine offcrews at Kings Bay. Specifically included in these responsibilities are the proper integration and coordination of the facilities dedicated to training support of the Trident system.
===Submarine Squadron 16===
, Submarine Squadron 16 provided administrative support for the East Coast-based &quot;Ohio&quot;-class SSGN submarines. The squadron coordinates planning and executing all SSGN maintenance with Trident Refit Facility and is responsible for all material readiness and fiscal responsibility. The SSGN fleet relies heavily on this maintenance. In addition Submarine Squadron 16 will provide support for SSBNs during and after major overhaul periods.

===Submarine Squadron 20===
Submarine Squadron 20 provides the same kind of support services as Submarine Squadron 16, except that it is responsible for the East Coast-based &quot;Ohio&quot;-class SSBN and the strategic deterrence missions those SSBNs undertake.

===Submarine Readiness Squadron===
The submarine center provides centralized administrative and support services to the submarine squadron assisting them in their responsibilities for material, personnel, training and logistics of assigned and visiting submarines.

===Strategic Weapons Facility Atlantic===

Strategic Weapons Facility Atlantic (SWFLANT) provides strategic missiles and strategic weapons system support to the ballistic missile fleet. The command is responsible for assembling the D-5 missile and processing missile guidance and launcher subsystem components.

===Marine Corps Security Force Battalion===
Marine Corps Security Force Battalion, Kings Bay conducts security operations in Direct Support (DS) of SWFLANT. The battalion is commanded by a senior Marine Corps officer and provides security operations as approved by the Chief of Naval Operations, in coordination with the Commandant of the Marine Corps, As of June 27, 2008, MCSFCO was restructured from a company to a battalion. A similar sister battalion is stationed with the west coast submarine base in Bangor, Washington. In addition to Marine Corps security forces, they are joined by Navy Master-at-Arms and Navy Law Enforcement/Security Officers with the 6490 designator. Both Masters-at-Arms and Navy Law Enforcement/Security Officers are part of the larger U.S. Navy Security Forces.

===United States Coast Guard (USCG) Maritime Force Protection Unit===

One of the first Maritime Force Protection Units was established by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) at Kings Bay. The Maritime Force Protection Unit provides escort protection for the submarines as they transit on the surface, to and from their homeports.
The unit includes some smaller vessels, and two Marine Protector class cutters, the and the . The &quot;Sea Dragon&quot; and &quot;Sea Dog&quot;, and two other cutters, the and , although crewed by sailors from the Coast Guard, were ordered, and paid for, by the Navy. For protecting submarines the Navy requested a slightly modified design, which added gyrostabilized machine gun, with advanced optics, which was fired under remote control from the ship&#x27;s bridge. The gyrostabilized gun&#x27;s greater long range accuracy made it more appropriate for intercepting speedboats laden with a suicide bomb.

=== Trident Refit Facility ===

The Trident Refit Facility (TRF) is the largest tenant command at Kings Bay and has kept a significant portion of the United States Fleet Ballistic Missile submarines at sea since 1985. TRF provides quality industrial-level and logistics support for the incremental overhaul, modernization, and repair of Trident submarines. It also furnishes global submarine supplies and spare parts support. In addition, TRF provides maintenance and support services to other submarines, regional maintenance customers, and other activities as requested.

The Trident Refit Facility possesses the largest covered drydock in the world, measuring long, wide, and deep. A state-of-the-art Magnetic Silencing Facility (MSF) provides degaussing services, including ranging and the removal of permanent magnetism for submarines of the U.S. Navy and the British Royal Navy, as well as for steel-hulled surface warships. The MSF is the only facility of its kind on the East Coast, and it is also used for research and development of future magnetic systems. The Defensive Ordnance Support Facility maintains and stores all of the torpedoes carried by the Trident missile submarines for self-defense.

===Trident Training Facility===
The Trident Training Facility (TTF), with over of classroom and office space, trains sailors in the skills necessary to operate and maintain the Trident submarine and its systems. TTF has an essential role in support of the Trident submarines and uses equipment trainers (simulators) to simulate, as realistically as possible, the actual equipment on the submarine. Trainers include damage control, fire fighting, ship control, navigation, and most weapons and engineering subsystems.

TTF&#x27;s mission is to provide basic, advanced, functional, refresher and team training to Trident submarine crew members and submarine support personnel, in order to increase and maintain the knowledge and proficiency in specific skills and to provide specialized training. The United Kingdom&#x27;s s, through the Polaris Sales Agreement, also uses the Trident missile and their sailors sometimes visit the Kings Bay Naval Base. Additionally, the Colombian Navy trained at TTF because of the lack of high technology trainers in their own country.

<text>Omoo: A Narrative of Adventures in the South Seas is the second book by American writer Herman Melville, first published in London in 1847, and a sequel to his first South Seas narrative &quot;Typee&quot;, also based on the author&#x27;s experiences in the South Pacific. After leaving the island of Nuku Hiva, the main character ships aboard a whaling vessel that makes its way to Tahiti, after which there is a mutiny and a third of the crew are imprisoned on Tahiti. In 1949, the narrative was adapted into the exploitation film &quot;Omoo-Omoo, the Shark God&quot;.

==Background==
The basis for the book are the author&#x27;s experiences in the South Seas. According to scholars Harrison Hayford and Walter Blair, in August and September 1842, the &quot;Lucy Ann&quot;, an Australian whaleship, took Melville from the Marquesas Islands to Tahiti. There the crew revolted. After being imprisoned in the native jail, he strolled around the islands for some days, before embarking on another whaler for a voyage of six months.

In the Preface to &quot;Omoo&quot;, Melville claimed the book was autobiographical, written &quot;from simple recollection&quot; of some of his experiences in the Pacific in the 1840s and strengthened by his retelling the story many times before family and friends. But scholar Charles Roberts Anderson, working in the late 1930s, discovered that Melville had not simply relied on his memory and went on to reveal a wealth of other sources he drew on in writing the book.

Later, Melville scholar Harrison Hayford made a detailed study of these sources and, in the introduction to a 1969 edition of &quot;Omoo&quot;, summed up the author&#x27;s practice, showing that this was a repetition of a process previously used in &quot;Typee&quot;: &quot;He had altered facts and dates, elaborated events, assimilated foreign materials, invented episodes, and dramatized the printed experiences of others as his own. He had not plagiarized, merely, for he had always rewritten and nearly always improved the passages he appropriated...first writing out the narrative based on his recollections and invention, then using source books to pad out the chapters he had already written and to supply the stuff of new chapters that he inserted at various points in the manuscript.&quot;

To a greater extent than he did in &quot;Typee&quot;, Melville used several source books from which he took passages and rewrote them for his book. The most important of these source books are William Ellis, &quot;Polynesian Researches&quot; from 1833, George H. von Langsdorff, &quot;Voyages and Travels in Various Parts of the World&quot; from 1813, Charles S. Stewart, &quot;A Visit to the South Seas in the U.S. ship Vincennes&quot; from 1831, and Charles Wilkes, &quot;Narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition&quot; of 1845.

==Plot==
In 1842, the narrator, having just escaped an “indulgent captivity” among the natives of Nuku Hiva, joins the crew of an Australian whaling ship from Sydney. He does not give his name, but one crew member calls him &quot;Typee&quot;. Soon after coming aboard he meets and forms a friendship with the vessel’s surgeon, a tall thin man known to his crew-mates as “Dr Long Ghost”.

== Writing Style ==
Compared to &quot;Typee&quot;, in &quot;Omoo&quot; a new style was emerging, of a &quot;distinct and original signature,&quot; as critic Warner Berthoff describes it. Biographer Hershel Parker finds the narrator &quot;powerfully attractive,&quot; because through the comical nature of the events &quot;a new sensibility was emerging.&quot; Melville&#x27;s &quot;new command of language,&quot; as Parker calls this development, came with hints of what would be characteristic of his mature style in &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; and later books. These include the merging of images from various historical times and places. Essentially, an example of this can be found in chapter 27 of &quot;Omoo&quot;, where the narrator sees on a ship in the harbor of Tahiti the name of a town along the Hudson river: &quot;In an instant, palm-trees and elms--canoes and skiffs--church spires and bamboos--all mingled in one vision of the present and the past.&quot;

Another emerging characteristic was the influence of Scripture on Melville&#x27;s writing. A few examples suffice to illustrate this point: in chapter 2, the mate &quot;abhorred all weak infusions, and cleaved manfully to strong drink&quot; echoes Romans 12:9; &quot;Woe be unto&quot; him in chapter 14 repeats a biblical expression found in several places, for instance in Jeremiah 23:1; the character Kooloo in chapter 40 is &quot;as sounding brass and a tinkling cynbal,&quot; which Melville took from 1 Corinthians 13:1.

==Publication history==
On December 18, 1846, Melville signed a contract with Harper Brothers for the publication of &quot;Omoo&quot;, and on December 30, he offered the book to John Murray, the British publisher of &quot;Typee&quot;. Some day in January publisher Evert Duyckinck asked Melville for permission to publish some pages of &quot;Omoo&quot; in the new magazine &quot;Literary World&quot;, and on January 30 the title was registered in the Office of the District Court for the Southern District of New York.

On February 1 proof sheets of the American edition were sent to London, where the customs house in Liverpool initially seized them as a piracy. The sheets were released and on February 26 Murray proposed to pay £150 for the copyright of the book, £50 more than he had offered for the previous book Melville accepted this offer in a letter of March 31, explaining that &quot;he did not know how to determine the &#x27;precise pecuniary value&#x27; of an unpublished work.&quot;

March 27 was the official date of the British publication. 4,000 copies of &quot;Omoo&quot; were printed, 2,500 paperbound copies in two parts, each priced at half a crown, and the rest as a single hardbound volume, priced at six shillings. At the request of the author, a map was engraved, as well as a Round-Robin diagram.

Murray included both &quot;Typee&quot; and &quot;Omoo&quot; in his &quot;Home and Colonial Library&quot; which was marketed and sold as a collection throughout the British Empire. In it, Melville was listed together with other well-known writers, an event that turned out to be an important watershed for both his sales and reputation. &quot;Over the decades Melville&#x27;s presence in the library insured the fame of his first two books with two or three generations of English readers all around the world.&quot;

In the United States, the book was available on May 1, in the same formats as Murray issued them. The two paperbound volumes were priced at 50¢ each, and the single volume in a cloth casing cost $1.25. 5,500 copies were printed by July, 2,000 of which in paper, 1,800 in muslin, and the rest remained in sheets.

Variants in spelling and punctuation aside, the two editions differed at 79 points, most of which were single words.

<text>Regina &quot;Reggie&quot; Sorensen (née Bingham, previously Bird; born 19 March 1974) is an Australian television personality best known for being a contestant on and winning the third and fourteenth seasons of &quot;Big Brother Australia&quot; in 2003 and 2022 respectively, and is the only contestant to win twice.

Small in stature with an unusual nasal intonation, she earned public admiration with her down-to-earth charm, strong work ethic, and naivety. She was the first &quot;Big Brother&quot; contestant to win twice (2003 and 2022 respectively). &quot;Go Reggie&quot; bumper stickers were a big hit in Tasmania in 2003.

Sorensen was included in Hobart newspaper &quot;The Mercury&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;Tassie&#x27;s Top 200&quot; movers and shakers in 2007.

==Career==

In late 2003, Sorensen signed up with manager Harry M. Miller and filmed a pilot for a TV show which never made it to air. Later she appeared as a contestant on 2005 Nine Network celebrity skating competition series &quot;Skating on Thin Ice&quot;. From December 2004 to May 2005 she worked for airline Virgin Blue as a flight attendant – her &quot;dream job&quot; – although she resigned claiming she had been bullied by her colleagues.

In 2025, Sorensen appeared as a contestant on the eleventh season of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;.

==Big Brother==
In 2003, Sorensen won third season of &quot;Big Brother&quot; with 72% of the final vote, the biggest margin in a &quot;Big Brother&quot; finale to date, in addition to being the first female winner of the Australian show.

Sorensen was involved in the week 12 task on season 9 of &quot;Big Brother 9&quot; in 2012, the show&#x27;s comeback season on the Nine Network. She was one of several former housemates that entered the house to try to get the current housemates to fail their weekly task, which was to ignore everyone who entered the house that was not a housemate.

In 2022, Sorensen starred in a third network, the Seven Network&#x27;s, iteration of Big Brother, &quot;Big Brother 14&quot;, as one of eight past housemates, in the mix with newly cast stars. She was one of three former winners to enter the house, alongside &quot;Big Brother 4&quot; winner Trevor Butler and &quot;Big Brother 10&quot; winner Tim Dormer. She was ultimately crowned the winner of &quot;Big Brother&quot; for a second time, where she spent a total of 148 days in the house (in both seasons). She became the fifth contestant in the world to win the show twice and the first person to do so in &quot;Big Brother Australia&quot;, also she was the first female winner of &quot;Big Brother&quot; since Terri Munro won the eighth and final season on Network Ten in 2008.

==Personal life==
Before appearing in &quot;Big Brother&quot; in 2003, Bird and her husband Adrian managed a fish and chip shop in Cambridge, Tasmania. Their marriage ended shortly after the season finale.

She spent some time residing in Sydney and later Melbourne. She now lives in Queensland. In 2007, she gave birth to her first child, a daughter with her second husband, Dale Sorensen. In 2009, she gave birth to a son, who was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis at four weeks old.

In 2005, Bird lost $40,000 to a conman who claimed to be a television producer where she paid him the money to fund the pilot of a travel show she would appear in. She has also been a victim of stalking.

===Health===
In 2008 she underwent emergency surgery arising from an ectopic pregnancy and was also declared legally blind after having been diagnosed with a degenerative eye condition, retinitis pigmentosa, a rare hereditary eye disease that may lead to blindness. She had lost 90% of her central vision. About her condition, she states &quot;I&#x27;ve now lost all of my peripheral vision, I have no night vision. I could wake up tomorrow and it&#x27;s going to be gone&quot;.

In 2017, Sorensen suffered from a stroke caused by a heart condition.

She was interviewed by &quot;60 Minutes&quot; in July 2009, during which she discussed her ongoing degenerative eye condition and her second child due in August 2009. She has also appeared on &quot;The Daily Edition&quot; in 2016 to discuss her illness.

<doc id="1007108" wikidata="Q633546" url="?curid=1007108" title="Eye contact">
<text>Eye contact occurs when two people or non-human animals look at each other&#x27;s eyes at the same time. In people, eye contact is a form of nonverbal communication and can have a large influence on social behavior. Coined in the early to mid-1960s, the term came from the West to often define the act as a meaningful and important sign of confidence and respect. The customs, meaning, and significance of eye contact can vary greatly between societies, neurotypes, and religions.

The study of eye contact is sometimes known as &quot;oculesics&quot;.

==Social meanings==

Eye contact and facial expressions provide important social and emotional information. People, perhaps without consciously doing so, search other&#x27;s eyes and faces for positive or negative mood signs. In some contexts, the meeting of eyes arouses strong emotions.
Eye contact provides some of the strongest emotions during a social conversation. This primarily is because it provides details on emotions and intentions. In a group, if eye contact is not inclusive of a certain individual, it can make that individual feel left out of the group; while on the other hand, prolonged eye contact can tell someone you are interested in what they have to say.

Eye contact is also an important element in flirting, where it may serve to establish and gauge the other&#x27;s interest in some situations. Mutual eye contact that signals attraction initially begins as a brief glance and progresses into a repeated volleying of eye contact.

In the process of civil inattention, strangers in close proximity, such as a crowd, avoid eye contact in order to help maintain their privacy.

==Effects==

===Parent–child===

A 1985 study suggested that &quot;3-month-old infants are comparatively insensitive to being the object of another&#x27;s visual regard&quot;. A 1996 Canadian study with 3- to 6-month-old infants found that smiling in infants decreased when adult eye contact was removed. A recent British study in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience found that face recognition by infants was facilitated by direct gaze. Other recent research has confirmed that the direct gaze of adults influences the direct gaze of infants. Within their first year, infants learn rapidly that the looking behaviors of others conveys significant information. Infants prefer to look at faces that engage them in mutual gaze and that, from an early age, healthy babies show enhanced neural processing of direct gaze.

=== Communicating attention ===
A person&#x27;s direction of gaze may indicate to others where their attention lies.

===Facilitating learning===

In the 2000s, studies suggest that eye contact has a positive impact on the retention and recall of information and may promote more efficient learning.

===Maternal sensitivity===

In a 2001 study conducted in Germany examining German infants during their first 12 weeks of life, researchers studied the relationship between eye contact, maternal sensitivity, and infant crying to attempt to determine if eye contact and maternal sensitivity were stable over time. In this correlational study, they began by categorizing the mother&#x27;s sensitivity placing them into one of four behavioral categories: inhibited/intense behavior, distortion of infant signals, over and understimulational, and aggressive behavioral. Next, the observer video-taped the mother and infant&#x27;s free-play interactions on a weekly basis for 12 weeks. When watching the videos, they measured the mutual eye contact between the mother and the infant by looking at the overlap in time when the mothers looked at their infant&#x27;s face and when the infants looked at their mother&#x27;s face. The mothers were also asked to record their infant&#x27;s crying in a diary.

The study found that the amount of eye contact between the study&#x27;s German mothers and infants increased continuously over the first 12 weeks. The mother who held eye contact with her child early on (week 1–4) was described as sensitive to her infant whereas if she did not hold eye contact, her behavior was described as insensitive. They also found a negative relationship between eye contact and the duration of crying of the infants; as eye contact increases, crying decreases. Maternal sensitivity was also shown to be stable over time. According to the study, these findings may potentially be based on the assumption that sensitive mothers are more likely to notice their child&#x27;s behavioral problems than non-sensitive mothers.

==Difficulty==

Some people find eye contact difficult with others. For example, those with autism spectrum disorders or social anxiety disorders may find eye contact to be particularly unsettling.

Strabismus, especially esophoria or exophoria, interferes with normal eye contact: a person whose eyes are not aligned usually makes full eye contact with one eye only, while the orientation of the other eye deviates slightly or more.

===Eye aversion and mental processing===

In one study conducted by British psychologists from the University of Stirling, among 20 British children at the age of five, researchers concluded that among the children in the study, the children who avoid eye contact while considering their responses to questions are more likely to answer correctly than children who maintain eye contact. While humans obtain useful information from looking at the face when listening to someone, the process of looking at faces is mentally demanding. Therefore, it may be unhelpful to look at faces when trying to concentrate and process something else that is mentally demanding. According to Doherty-Sneddon, a blank stare likely indicates a lack of understanding.

==Cultural differences==
In many cultures, such as in East Asia and Nigeria, it is respectful not to look the dominant person in the eye, but in Western culture this can be interpreted as being &quot;shifty-eyed&quot;, and the person averting eye contact can be judged as bad because &quot;they wouldn&#x27;t look me in the eye&quot;; references such as &quot;shifty-eyed&quot; can refer to suspicions regarding an individual&#x27;s unrevealed intentions or thoughts. Nevertheless, the seeking of constant unbroken eye contact by the other participant in a conversation can often be considered overbearing or distracting by many even in Western cultures, possibly on an instinctive or subconscious level.

In traditional Islamic theology, it is often generally advised to lower one&#x27;s gaze when looking at other people in order to avoid sinful sensuous appetites and desires. Excessive eye contact or &quot;staring&quot; is also sometimes described as impolite, inappropriate, or even disrespectful, especially between youths and elders or children and their parents, and so lowering one&#x27;s gaze when talking with older people is seen as a sign of respect and reverence. Nonetheless, actual cultural and societal practices in this regard vary greatly.

Japanese children are taught in school to direct their gaze at the region of their teacher&#x27;s Adam&#x27;s apple or tie knot. As adults, Japanese lower their eyes when speaking to a superior as a gesture of respect.

Some bodies of parliamentary procedure ban eye contact between members when speaking.

==Clinical description==
For clinical evaluation purposes in the practice of psychiatry and clinical psychology, as part of a mental status exam, the clinician may describe the initiation, frequency, and quality of eye contact. For example, the doctor may note whether the patient initiates, responds to, sustains, or evades eye contact. The clinician may also note whether eye contact is unusually intense or blank, or whether the patient glares, looks down, or looks aside frequently.

==Between species==

Eye contact can also be a significant factor in interactions between non-human animals, and between humans and non-human animals.

Animals of many species, including dogs, often perceive eye contact as a threat. Many programs to prevent dog bites recommend avoiding direct eye contact with an unknown dog. According to a report in &quot;The New Zealand Medical Journal&quot;, maintaining eye contact is one reason young children may be more likely to fall victim to dog attacks.

On the other hand, extended eye contact between a dog and its owner modulates the secretion of oxytocin, a neuromodulator that is known for its role in maternal-infant bonding.

Hikers are commonly advised to avoid direct eye contact if they have surprised a bear, since the bear may interpret the eye contact as a threat, although some sources suggest maintaining eye contact.

Among primates, eye contact is seen as especially aggressive, and staring at them in a zoo can induce agitated behavior. Chimpanzees use eye contact to signal aggression in hostile encounters. Eye tracking research shows that chimps are more likely to look at the mouth, while bonobos are more likely to look at the eyes; eye contact is lower among socially deprived primates. A 2007 incident at Rotterdam Zoo is believed to be connected to eye contact: Bokito the gorilla escaped from his exhibit and injured a woman who had visited him several times and apparently often held prolonged eye contact. Visitors were later given special glasses that averted their apparent gaze when looking at Bokito.

<doc id="1007110" wikidata="Q4751136" url="?curid=1007110" title="Analytic proof">
<text>In mathematics, an analytic proof is a proof of a theorem in analysis that only makes use of methods from analysis, and that does not predominantly make use of algebraic or geometrical methods. The term was first used by Bernard Bolzano, who first provided a non-analytic proof of his intermediate value theorem and then, several years later provided a proof of the theorem that was free from intuitions concerning lines crossing each other at a point, and so he felt happy calling it analytic (Bolzano 1817). 

Bolzano&#x27;s philosophical work encouraged a more abstract reading of when a demonstration could be regarded as analytic, where a proof is analytic if it does not go beyond its subject matter (Sebastik 2007). In proof theory, an analytic proof has come to mean a proof whose structure is simple in a special way, due to conditions on the kind of inferences that ensure none of them go beyond what is contained in the assumptions and what is demonstrated.

==Structural proof theory==

In proof theory, the notion of analytic proof provides the fundamental concept that brings out the similarities between a number of essentially distinct proof calculi, so defining the subfield of structural proof theory. There is no uncontroversial general definition of analytic proof, but for several proof calculi there is an accepted notion. For example:

* In Gerhard Gentzen&#x27;s natural deduction calculus the analytic proofs are those in normal form; that is, no formula occurrence is both the principal premise of an elimination rule and the conclusion of an introduction rule;
* In Gentzen&#x27;s sequent calculus the analytic proofs are those that do not use the cut rule.

However, it is possible to extend the inference rules of both calculi so that there are proofs that satisfy the condition but are not analytic. For example, a particularly tricky example of this is the &quot;analytic cut rule&quot;, used widely in the tableau method, which is a special case of the cut rule where the cut formula is a subformula of side formulae of the cut rule: a proof that contains an analytic cut is by virtue of that rule not analytic.

Furthermore, proof calculi that are not analogous to Gentzen&#x27;s calculi have other notions of analytic proof. For example, the calculus of structures organises its inference rules into pairs, called the up fragment and the down fragment, and an analytic proof is one that only contains the down fragment.

<doc id="1007113" wikidata="Q6369714" url="?curid=1007113" title="Karen Holbrook">
<text>Karen Ann Holbrook (born November 6, 1942, in Des Moines, Iowa) is the regional chancellor of the University of South Florida Sarasota–Manatee since January 2, 2018. 

==Career==
Holbrook earned her B.S. and M.S. from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, in zoology. After teaching biology at Ripon College, she earned a Ph.D. in biological structure from the University of Washington School of Medicine in 1972, where she served as a postdoctoral fellow in dermatology, faculty member and research administrator. She then pursued further training in dermatology. She is an alumna of Gamma Phi Beta sorority.

Holbrook was a professor of biological structure and medicine at University of Washington School of Medicine, where she became the first woman to be named associate dean at the UW School of Medicine, vice president for research and dean of the graduate school at the University of Florida, and senior vice president for academic affairs and provost at the University of Georgia.

===President of Ohio State===
From 2002 to 2007, she was the 13th presiding president of Ohio State University. During Holbrook&#x27;s tenure, she worked with Columbus Mayor Michael B. Coleman to improve safety both on- and off-campus. This was in reaction to riots following a Michigan–Ohio State football game in 2002. Holbrook announced in June 2006 that she would depart Ohio State when her five-year contract was up in 2007 to spend more time with her husband, Jim. Joseph A. Alutto, dean of the Max M. Fisher College of Business at Ohio State, replaced Holbrook as an interim president until Gordon Gee took his place as the new president.

While applying for a position of President at Florida Gulf Coast University in 2007, Holbrook lamented on the student culture at Ohio State. She remarked in a job interview that, &quot;They think it&#x27;s fun to flip cars, to really have absolute drunken orgies. ... I don&#x27;t want to be at a place that has this kind of culture as a norm.&quot; Holbrook later acknowledged that she might have exaggerated her comments.

===Post-Ohio State===
In 2017, while serving as executive vice president at University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee, she replaced Terry Osborn as chancellor who was also serving as vice chancellor of academic affairs. From 2013 to 2016, she had served as senior adviser to the president of the University of South Florida system.

Holbrook has served on the boards of several institutions. She also served as interim president of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University prior to moving to the University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee.

<doc id="1007116" wikidata="Q6411382" url="?curid=1007116" title="King County Council">
<text>The Metropolitan King [[County Council]], the legislative body of King County, Washington, consists of nine members elected by district. The Council adopts laws, sets policy, and holds final approval over the budget. Its current name and structure is the result of a merger of King County and the Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle, better known as Metro, which was a federated county-city structure responsible for water quality and public transportation.

== Councilmembers ==
As a result of a County Charter amendment passed by voters in the November 2008 elections, all elective offices of King County are officially nonpartisan; that being said, all current council members have made their party affiliations a matter of public record.

*District 1: Rod Dembowski (D), took office 2013
*District 2: Girmay Zahilay (D), took office 2020
*District 3: Sarah Perry (D), took office 2022
*District 4: Jorge Barón (D), took office on January 9, 2024
*District 5: De&#x27;Sean Quinn (D), took office 2025
*District 6: Claudia Balducci (D), took office 2016
*District 7: Pete von Reichbauer (R), took office 1994
*District 8: Teresa Mosqueda (D), took office on January 9, 2024
*District 9: Reagan Dunn (R), took office 2005

== Meetings ==

The full county council meets weekly on Thursdays, except for the fifth Thursday in a month. Public comments are permitted at the fourth meeting of the month. Meetings are held in the County Council chambers, Room 1001, on the tenth floor of the King County Courthouse in Downtown Seattle.

== Structure ==

The nine members of the council are elected by their district to four-year terms in nonpartisan contests. Councilmembers in even numbered districts are up for election in 2023, while Councilmembers in odd districts are up for election in 2025. Prior to 2009, councilmembers were elected on a partisan basis, and had to declare their political party unless they filed as an Independent. An independent candidate had to receive at least 20 percent of the vote in the primary election to qualify for the general election ballot. This changed upon the passage of Charter Amendment 8 by voters in 2008, which made all elections for county offices nonpartisan.

The Council uses its committee structure to consider the legislation before it. Ordinances and motions (policy statements) are assigned to a King County Council committee for consideration, and then are recommended to the full Council for action. Each year, the Council reorganizes and elects a Chair and Vice Chair. In addition, the Council decides yearly on its committee structure and makeup. Currently there are nine standing policy committees and three regional committees. Members of the Seattle City Council and representatives from suburban cities and local sewer districts are also members of the regional committees. In addition, all nine members of the Council meet as a Committee of the Whole to discuss broad-reaching legislation and issues.

The King County Executive is not a member of the Council, and is a separately elected official. The Executive submits legislation to the Council for consideration. Each year in October, the Executive submits a proposed budget to the County Council for the operation of County government for the coming year. The Executive has veto power over ordinances passed by the Council.

== Redistricting ==

In the 2004 general election voters approved a charter amendment to reduce the size of the council from thirteen to nine, which went into effect January 1, 2006. With four fewer districts, the number of constituents per district rose from 138,000 residents to about 193,000.

<doc id="1007117" wikidata="Q1091137" url="?curid=1007117" title="Japanese cruiser Chōkai">
<text>was a heavy cruiser, armed with ten guns, four guns, eight tubes for the Type 93 torpedo, and assorted anti-aircraft guns. Named for Mount Chōkai, &quot;Chōkai&quot; was designed with the Imperial Japanese Navy strategy of the great &quot;Decisive Battle&quot; in mind, and built in 1932 by Mitsubishi&#x27;s shipyard in Nagasaki. 

&quot;Chōkai&quot; participated in numerous actions during the Pacific War including the Battle of Savo Island off Guadalcanal, in which she, along with other Japanese cruisers, sank the heavy cruisers , and . She was sunk in the Battle off Samar in October 1944.

==Design==

The &quot;Takao&quot;-class cruisers were an improved version of the previous design, incorporating technical elements learned with the development of the experimental light cruiser . They had a distinctive profile with a large, raked main smokestack, and a smaller, straight, second smokestack. Intended to address issues with the &quot;Myōkō &quot; class, the &quot;Takao&quot; class had thicker armor, dual-purpose main guns which could be used against aircraft, and torpedo launchers moved to the upper deck for greater safety. However, as with its predecessors, the &quot;Takao&quot; class was also top-heavy.

The &quot;Takao&quot; class displaced . &quot;Chōkai&quot; was long, with a beam of , draft of and was capable of 35.25 knots.

Propulsion was by 12 Kampon boilers driving four sets of single-impulse geared turbine engines, with four shafts turning three-bladed propellers. The ship was armored with a side belt, and armored deck;, the bridge was armored with armored plates.

&quot;Chōkai&quot;&#x27;s main battery was ten 20 cm/50 3rd Year Type naval guns, the heaviest armament of any heavy cruiser in the world at the time, mounted in five twin turrets. Her secondary armament included four Type 10 12 cm dual purpose guns with four single mounts, two on each side, and 8 Type 90 torpedoes in four twin launchers, with 16 as reloads. She was very deficient in anti-aircraft capability, with only two anti-aircraft guns and two 7.7 mm machine guns. Her last refit removed the two 40 mm and 7.7 mm anti-aircraft guns in exchange for a total of 38 Type 96 in four twin and 22 single mounts. Her torpedoes were upgraded to the more powerful Type 93 torpedoes. Uniquely to &quot;Chōkai&quot;, she did not receive the extensive refit her sisters did, keeping the 12 cm guns and four twin torpedo tubes, whereas her sisters received the Type 89 and four quad torpedo tubes.

==Operational history==

At the start of the Pacific War, &quot;Chōkai&quot; supported the invasion of Malaya and participated in the pursuit of the Royal Navy&#x27;s battleship Force Z. During January and February 1942, &quot;Chōkai&quot; was involved in operations to seize the oil-rich Dutch East Indies and the island of Borneo. Steaming near Cape St. Jacques, &quot;Chōkai&quot; struck a reef, sustaining hull damage on 22 February 1942. On 27 February, she reached Singapore for repairs.

After repairs, &quot;Chōkai&quot; was once again assigned to a support role in an invasion, this time the landings at Iri, Sumatra, and the invasion of the Andaman Islands and the seizure of Port Blair a few days later. Afterwards, &quot;Chōkai&quot; sailed to Mergui, Burma.

On 1 April 1942, &quot;Chōkai&quot; left Mergui to participate a raid on merchant shipping in the Bay of Bengal. First, &quot;Chōkai&quot; torpedoed and sank the U.S. freighter &quot;Bienville&quot;, and later on, the British steamship &quot;Ganges&quot; on 6 April. With her role in the operation successfully concluded, &quot;Chōkai&quot; returned to Yokosuka on 22 April 1942.

===Battle of Savo Island===

By mid-July 1942, &quot;Chōkai&quot; was made the new flagship of Vice Admiral Mikawa Gunichi and his 8th Fleet. She proceeded towards Rabaul. On 7 August 1942, with Guadalcanal having been invaded by the Americans, &quot;Chōkai&quot; headed for the Guadalcanal waters, with Vice Admiral Mikawa aboard. In the battle of Savo Island, Mikawa&#x27;s squadron of heavy cruisers, consisting of &quot;Chokai&quot; herself, and the heavy cruisers &quot;Furutaka,&quot; &quot;Kako&quot;, &quot;Aoba&quot;, and &quot;Kinugasa&quot; inflicted a devastating defeat on an Allied cruiser squadron. First, &quot;Chōkai&quot; and &quot;Aoba&quot; targeted the Australian heavy cruiser &quot;Canberra&quot;, followed by &quot;Furutaka&quot; and &quot;Kako&quot; joining in, and all four ships sank &quot;Canberra&quot; with gunfire. Following that, &quot;Chōkai&quot; pounded the heavy cruiser , and as &quot;Aoba&quot;, &quot;Kako&quot;, and &quot;Kinugasa j&quot;oined in, &quot;Astoria&quot; sank. Finally, while other cruisers lit the cruiser aflame and sank her, &quot;Chōkai&quot; sank the heavy cruiser with two hits from her long lance torpedoes. The battle of Savo Island was one of the most devastating Japanese naval victories of the war, the four allied heavy cruisers sunk and several more ships damaged or crippled. However, &quot;Chōkai&quot; sustained several hits from &quot;Quincy&quot; and &quot;Astoria&quot;, disabling her &quot;A&quot; turret and killing 34 men. &quot;Chōkai&quot; returned to Rabaul for temporary repairs. For the rest of the Solomon Islands campaign, &quot;Chōkai&quot; would fight in an assortment of night battles with the U.S. Navy, sustaining varied, but mostly minor, damage. 

===Subsequent action===
Relieved as the Eighth Fleet flagship shortly after the final evacuation of Guadalcanal, &quot;Chōkai&quot; headed back to Yokosuka on 20 February 1943. Tasked with various minor duties for the remainder of 1943 and first half of 1944, &quot;Chōkai&quot; was made the flagship of the Cruiser Division Four (&quot;CruDiv 4&quot;) comprising , , , and &quot;Chōkai&quot; on 3 August 1944. All four ships took part in the Battle of the Philippine Sea.

===Battle of Leyte Gulf===

CruDiv 4 was part of Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s large fleet of IJN battleships, cruisers, and destroyers that took part in the various engagements of the Battle of Leyte Gulf at the Philippines.

CruDiv 4 suffered a harrowing submarine attack on 23 October 1944, with the sinking of and (which was Kurita&#x27;s flagship, though he survived), while was left permanently crippled, leaving &quot;Chōkai&quot; as the only undamaged ship of CruDiv 4.

&quot;Chōkai&quot; was then transferred to Cruiser Division Five, where she survived an air attack on 24 October 1944, while the battleship &quot;Musashi&quot; was sunk.

====Sunk in the battle off Samar====
On the morning of 25 October, &quot;Chōkai&quot; engaged an American force of escort carriers, destroyers, and destroyer escorts in the Battle off Samar. During her approach to the US escort carriers, &quot;Chōkai&quot; was hit several times on the port side amidships by 5&quot;/38 caliber guns of this force&#x27;s escort carriers and destroyers. It was believed at the time that one of these hits may have set off the eight deck-mounted Japanese Type 93 &quot;Long Lance&quot; torpedoes; however, &#x27;s expedition in 2019 found &quot;Chōkai&quot;″s torpedoes still intact. An explosion was observed aboard &quot;Chōkai&quot; before a TBM Avenger from the &quot;USS Kitkun Bay&quot; dropped a 500 lb (230 kg) bomb on her forward machinery room. Fires began to rage and she went dead in the water. She was scuttled later that day by torpedoes from the destroyer (), which also rescued some of her crew. Two days later &quot;Fujinami&quot; was sunk with the loss of all hands, including the &quot;Chōkai&quot; survivors.

==Wreck==
&quot;Chōkai&quot; sits upright in of water on the edge of the Philippine Deep. RV &quot;Petrel&quot; discovered the wreck of &quot;Chōkai&quot; on 5 May 2019 and dived it via ROV on 30 May 2019.

<doc id="1007119" wikidata="Q470528" url="?curid=1007119" title="Amha Selassie">
<text>Amha Selassie (; born Asfaw Wossen Tafari; 27 July 191617 January 1997) was Emperor-in-exile of Ethiopia. As son of Haile Selassie, he was Crown Prince and was proclaimed monarch three times. He was first proclaimed Emperor during an unsuccessful coup attempt against his father in December 1960, during which he alleged that he was detained and compelled to accept the title. After his father was deposed in a later coup, he was proclaimed King (not Emperor) &quot;in absentia&quot; by the Derg on 12 September 1974 in an act which he never accepted as legitimate and that ended in the abolition of the Ethiopian monarchy on 21 March 1975. He was again proclaimed Emperor in exile on 8 April 1989. This time he sanctioned the proclamation and accepted its legitimacy. After his accession, his full reign name was &quot;His Imperial Majesty Emperor Amha Selassie I, Elect of God, Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah and King of Kings of Ethiopia&quot;.

== Biography ==
He was born Asfaw Wossen Tafari, in the walled city of Harar, to Dejazmach Tafari Makonnen, then the governor of Harar and future Emperor of Ethiopia, and his wife Menen Asfaw, on 29 July 1916.

Amha Selassie became Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen of Ethiopia when his father was crowned Emperor on 2 November 1930. Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen was granted the title of &quot;Meridazmach&quot; and the province (former kingdom) of Wollo to rule as his fief. He was married to Princess Wolete Israel Seyoum, great-granddaughter of Emperor Yohannes IV, and had a daughter, Princess Ijigayehu. Following the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1936, the Crown Prince and Princess went into exile with the rest of the Imperial family. They separated around 1938, and eventually divorced in 1941.
Following Emperor Haile Selassie&#x27;s restoration in 1941, the Crown Prince returned to Ethiopia, and participated in the campaign to drive the Italian forces out of the city of Gondar, the last town they held in Ethiopia. He briefly served as acting governor of the provinces of Begemder and Tigray, retaining Wollo the entire time. He was eventually remarried to Princess Medferiashwork Abebe, and would father three more daughters, Princesses Mariam Senna, Sefrash, Sehin, and a son Prince Zera Yacob.

On the evening of 13 December 1960, the commander of the Imperial Guard, Mengistu Neway, with his brother Germame Neway launched a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; and seized power in Ethiopia while the Emperor was on a visit to Brazil. The &quot;coup&quot; leaders allegedly detained Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen in the Imperial Palace, and the following morning, having secured control over most of the capital, then allegedly compelled the Crown Prince to read a radio statement, in which he accepted the crown in his father&#x27;s place and announced a government of reform. However, the regular Army, led by &quot;Dejazmach&quot; Asrate Medhin Kassa and Chief of Staff, Major General Mared Mangesha, spent the following day gaining control of other military formations, as well as the Air Force; later that day Patriarch Abuna Basilios of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, issued an anathema against all those who cooperated with the rebels. On 15 December fighting broke out in the city, and the rebels were driven out of Addis Ababa; before retreating the rebels slaughtered many members of the government and the nobility held hostage in the Green Salon of the palace. Among the dead were Abebe Aregai and Seyum Mangasha. The Emperor returned to Ethiopia, entering the capital on 17 December. Although it was alleged that the Crown Prince had acted under duress, his outlook had long been regarded as considerably more liberal than that of his father, and so he would always be suspected of having been a willing participant in the &quot;coup&quot; attempt. By contrast, Medferiashwork Abebe, the wife of the Crown Prince, is credited with playing a role against the &quot;coup&quot; attempt. In 1974 the Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen said that he &quot;undoubtedly not only knew about the revolution ahead of time, he was also part of the people who had organized it.&quot;

At the age of 58 in late 1972, after his father Emperor Haile Selassie blamed him for hiding the realities of the famine in the region which he presided over as Duke (Wollo) from him, Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen suffered a massive stroke and was evacuated for medical treatment to London and Switzerland. He was accompanied by his wife and daughters. The stroke left him permanently paralyzed on one side and unable to walk, and also affected his speech. As Prince Asfaw Wossen was not expected to live, his son, Prince Zera Yacob, a student at Oxford at the time, was named &quot;Acting Crown Prince&quot; and &quot;Heir Presumptive&quot;.

== Short reign ==
The so-called &quot;short reign&quot; of Amha Selassie in 1974 was in name only between the dethronement of his father on 12 September 1974 until the abolition of the monarchy in March 1975. Amha Selassie had been out of the country for medical treatment when the coup occurred.

Haile Selassie had never signed an abdication or renounced his status as Emperor. The military junta declared the Crown Prince &quot;King&quot; instead of &quot;Emperor&quot;, but he never acknowledged the title nor accepted his father&#x27;s dethronement. When the new government massacred 61 ex-officials of the Imperial government, Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen issued a strong denunciation that was broadcast on the BBC. The statement was issued in the name of &quot;Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen&quot; which indicated that he did not recognize the Derg&#x27;s declaration of him as monarch in his father&#x27;s place. He continued to use the title of Crown Prince during his exile until April 1989, when he finally assumed the title of Emperor with the regnal name of Amha Selassie I. His succession was back-dated, not to 12 September 1974, when his father was deposed, but to 27 August 1975, when his father died. He reiterated his view that all of the Derg regime&#x27;s acts were illegitimate and illegal.

== Life in exile ==
On 12 September 1974, the Derg military junta deposed Emperor Haile Selassie and declared that Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen would be anointed &quot;King&quot; upon his return from medical treatment in Geneva, Switzerland. The Derg stated that it intended for Asfaw to rule as a constitutional monarch.

However, the prince did not recognize this proclamation and did not return to Ethiopia. When he instead announced to the Ethiopian Embassy in London that he would be moving to that city shortly, the Embassy asked the Derg for instructions as to whether it should receive him as a king and head-of-state, or if it should receive him as crown prince upon his arrival in the United Kingdom. The Derg replied that he should be received as a simple citizen of Ethiopia and that no royal dignities were to be accorded to the prince or his family. The revolutionaries soon abolished the monarchy in March 1975, and crown prince Asfaw Wossen settled permanently in London, where several other members of the imperial family were already based. The other members of the imperial family who were still in Ethiopia at the time of the revolution were imprisoned, including Asfaw Wossen&#x27;s father, the emperor, his daughter by his first marriage, Princess Ijigayehu, his sister Princess Tenagnework and many of his nephews, nieces, relatives and in-laws. In 1975, first his father, Emperor Haile Selassie, and then in January 1977, his daughter, Princess Ijigayehu, died in detention. Members of the Imperial family remained imprisoned until 1989 (for the women) and 1990 (for the men).

In April 1989, Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen was proclaimed &quot;Emperor of Ethiopia&quot; in exile, at his home in London by members of the exiled Ethiopian community. He took the throne name of Amha Selassie I. His wife began also using the title of &quot;Empress&quot;. A year later, the emperor- and empress-in-exile moved to McLean, Virginia, USA to be close to the large Ethiopian immigrant population in and around Washington, D.C.

In 1991, with the fall of the Derg, and the coming to power of the EPRDF in Ethiopia, Amha Selassie founded the Moa Anbessa Monarchist Movement to promote a monarchial restoration in Ethiopia, and announced his intention to return to his country for a visit. However, following the disinterment of the remains of Emperor Haile Selassie, a dispute erupted between the imperial family and the new government over the status of a funeral that was planned for the late emperor. The government refused to give Haile Selassie a state funeral; consequently, the funeral, and the return of Amha Selassie, were indefinitely postponed.

== Death ==
Amha Selassie died at the age of 82 on 17 January 1997, after long illnesses, in the US state of Virginia. He had never completely recovered from the stroke he had experienced in 1972. At the time his son, Zera-Jakob Selassie was living on the Isle of Dogs, London. However, when he applied for a visa so that he could preside over a funeral held in the US, he was refused a visa. When he applied a second time, he was told never to apply again. Dennis Wolf, a spokesperson for the US Embassy in London explained that Zera-Jakob had failed to convince the authorities that he had a residence outside the USA – despite having housing in the UK. After this, arrangements were made for Amha Selassie&#x27;s body which was flown back to Ethiopia and buried in the Imperial family vaults at Holy Trinity Cathedral in Addis Ababa in a large ceremonial funeral presided over by Patriarch Abune Paulos.

<text>Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum is a design museum at the Andrew Carnegie Mansion in Manhattan, New York City, along the Upper East Side&#x27;s Museum Mile. It is one of 19 Smithsonian Institution museums and one of three Smithsonian facilities located in New York City, along with the National Museum of the American Indian&#x27;s George Gustav Heye Center in Bowling Green and the Archives of American Art New York Research Center in the Flatiron District. Unlike other Smithsonian museums, Cooper Hewitt charges an admissions fee. It is the only museum in the United States devoted to historical and contemporary design. Its collections and exhibitions explore design aesthetic and creativity from throughout the United States&#x27; history.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
In 1895, several granddaughters of the politician and businessman Peter Cooper—Sarah Cooper Hewitt, Eleanor Garnier Hewitt and Amy Hewitt Green—asked the Cooper Union college in New York City for space to create a Museum for the Arts of Decoration. The museum would take its inspiration from the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris and would serve as a place for Cooper Union students and professional designers to study decorative arts collections. Cooper Union&#x27;s trustees provided the fourth floor of the Foundation Building. It opened in 1897 as the &quot;Cooper Union Museum for the Arts of Decoration&quot;. The museum was free and open to the public three days a week. The Hewitt sisters donated some of the objects that they owned to the museum.

Early in the museum&#x27;s history, the Cooper Union Museum received three textile collections from J. P. Morgan and drawings by Giovanni Baglione. The three sisters served as directors of the Museum until Sarah Cooper Hewitt died in 1930. After her death, four directors were appointed to run the museum. Constance P. Hare served as chair. In 1938, Edwin S. Burdell became the director of the Cooper Union. The museum became his responsibility. The board of directors was abolished and an advisory council was established. Through the mid-20th century, the museum&#x27;s collection came to include furniture, wallpapers, leatherwork, millinery, ceramics, jewelry, textiles, and media such as drawings and prints. The museum had begun to decline by the 1950s and 1960s, in part because it was in a hard-to-find location, and Cooper Union students preferred modern art over the museum&#x27;s dated collections.

==== Threats of closure ====
By the 1960s, the museum and college started to distance themselves from one another in regards to programming. Other departments of the Cooper Union were making financial demands. The Cooper Union announced in June 1963 that it was considering shuttering the museum completely, and the museum closed on July 3, 1963. In explaining the closure, the college said that the museum was far from other visitor attractions, the museum space was too small, and it was seeing declining use. Cooper Union officials also said their endowment could not fund the museum&#x27;s continued operations. This prompted concerns that the museum&#x27;s collection could be dispersed. A Committee to Save the Cooper Union Museum, formed by Henry Francis Du Pont, threatened to sue to prevent the museum from closing. The committee requested that the Cooper Union&#x27;s trustees split the museum off from the college&#x27;s main operations. Another organization, the Greenwich Village Committee, was also formed in July 1963 to try to prevent the proposed relocation of the museum&#x27;s collections.

The museum reopened September 16, 1963, with its future still uncertain. That November, the Cooper Union accepted the American Association of Museums&#x27; offer to conduct a study on the future of the museum. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, which was located nearby, offered to take over all of the museum&#x27;s holdings. By 1965, the Smithsonian Institution had begun negotiating to take over the museum from the Cooper Union. At the time, the institution was rapidly expanding the number of artworks and artifacts in its other museums.

=== Smithsonian operation ===

==== 1960s and 1970s ====
On October 9, 1967, Smithsonian Secretary S. Dillon Ripley and Daniel Maggin, the chair of the board of trustees, signed an agreement turning over the collection and library of the museum to the Smithsonian. As part of the agreement, the museum was to stay in New York City permanently and would remain in the Cooper Union&#x27;s Foundation Building for three years. Even before it had finalized its acquisition, the Smithsonian was negotiating to lease the Andrew Carnegie Mansion on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side as the collection&#x27;s new home. The mansion was five times as large as the museum&#x27;s Cooper Union space. The New York Supreme Court approved the agreement on May 14, 1968. The museum was officially transferred to the Smithsonian on July 1, becoming the Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Design, and Richard T. Wunder was named as the director. Wunder planned to obtain objects from around the world. Despite being part of the Smithsonian Institution, the Cooper Hewitt still did not have enough cash to sustain its own operations.

In 1969, it was renamed again to the Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Decorative Arts and Design. Ripley leased the Carnegie Mansion from the Carnegie Corporation of New York in September 1969. Lisa Taylor became the Cooper-Hewitt&#x27;s director that October, the first woman to serve in that position. The museum, which was the first Smithsonian museum outside of Washington, D.C., moved to its home at the Carnegie Mansion in 1970. The museum obtained the mansion outright in 1972. During the early 1970s, the museum was temporarily closed while it relocated from the Foundation Building to the Carnegie Mansion. During this time, it hosted exhibits at venues such as the Seventh Regiment Armory. By the middle of the decade, the collection had grown to 250 pieces of furniture, 500 glass objects, 1,500 ceramic objects, 6,000 wallpaper samples, 18,000 textile samples, and 30,000 drawings. The museum had 35 paid staff and 72 volunteers by 1976, and it received $258,000 annually in federal funding. In addition, the museum planned to raise money through events, donations, and membership fees.

A soft opening for the museum took place in May 1976. The museum opened to the public on October 7, 1976, with the exhibition &quot;MAN transFORMs&quot;. Other museums around the city hosted exhibitions to celebrate the Cooper-Hewitt&#x27;s opening. Taylor and renovation architect Hugh Hardy planned to convert the mansion&#x27;s basements into exhibit space, and they also planned a new auditorium, galleries, classrooms, and screening rooms. A conservation laboratory was opened in July 1978. The Samuel H. Kress Foundation funded the lab and it focuses on textile and paper conservation. At the time of the Cooper-Hewitt&#x27;s reopening, it was the only museum in the U.S. that was dedicated exclusively to design.
==== 1980s and 1990s ====
The Cooper-Hewitt launched a master&#x27;s degree program in conjunction with the Parsons School of Design in 1982. Under Taylor&#x27;s leadership, the museum also began offering additional educational programs both for adults and for children. In the eight years after the Cooper-Hewitt reopened, it hosted over 100 temporary exhibitions. Lisa Taylor announced her retirement in 1987, and the Cooper-Hewitt celebrated the tenth anniversary of its occupancy of the Carnegie Mansion shortly thereafter. At the time, in contrast to most Smithsonian museums, the Cooper-Hewitt relied on the Smithsonian for only one-third of its annual budget. Dianne H. Pilgrim became the director in 1988, and the museum was again renamed to Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum that year. According to Pilgrim, the name change was intended to reflect the Cooper-Hewitt&#x27;s purpose as a &quot;design museum&quot; that focused on the process of design, rather than a &quot;museum of design&quot; that focused on objects.

The Smithsonian bought the McAlpin-Minot House at 11 East 90th Street in 1989 for $3.6 million, and it connected that house to the Carnegie Mansion and 9 East 90th Street. An archive of African American designs was created at the museum in 1991. Pilgrim hired James Stewart Polshek Partners to devise plans for a further renovation of the Cooper-Hewitt buildings. The project was initially planned to cost $10 million, but Smithsonian secretary Michael Heyman placed the plans on hold in late 1994 due to cost overruns. The budget ultimately increased to $20 million; this consisted of a $13 million allocation from the Smithsonian and $7 million from private sources. The museum&#x27;s logo was changed in late 1994 to emphasize the word &quot;design&quot;.

Pilgrim announced in May 1995 that the exhibition galleries in the Carnegie Mansion would close for renovation, and the renovation commenced that August. The Carnegie Mansion&#x27;s first-floor exhibit space reopened in September 1996, Work on the passageway and design resources center continued through 1997, and the renovation was not completed until 1998.

==== 2000s ====
Pilgrim retired from the museum in 2000, and Paul W. Thompson was named as the new director later that year. At the time of Thompson&#x27;s appointment, the &quot;New York Times&quot; described the Carnegie Mansion as &quot;an almost impossible venue for staging exhibitions on modern design&quot; because the mansion was so much smaller than other museum buildings. Upon becoming the museum&#x27;s director, Thompson sought to display modern design pieces at the Cooper-Hewitt. Thompson expanded the museum&#x27;s board of trustees from 18 to 23 members, and the amount each trustee was expected to donate was increased from $10,000 to $25,000. He also planned to increase visitor numbers by one-third, to 200,000. Following the September 11 attacks, the Smithsonian ordered the Cooper-Hewitt to downsize, and Thompson eliminated four senior staff positions in June 2002, a move that prompted complaints from employees. In addition, over a dozen senior staff members resigned during 2001 and 2002, citing dissatisfaction with the work culture. Museum staff told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that passersby often did not know of the museum&#x27;s existence or assumed it was affiliated with the Spence School on the same city block.

Thompson originally did not want to expand the museum, but he changed his mind after the museum experienced staffing, budgetary, and exhibit shortages. The museum announced plans in mid-2003 to rearrange galleries, and several members of the museum&#x27;s board indicated the same year that they would host a master plan competition, in advance of an expansion. News media reported in February 2005 that the Cooper-Hewitt was considering a $75 million proposal by Beyer Blinder Belle to expand the museum buildings. The basement levels would also have contained a restaurant, conservation rooms, and exhibit-preparation areas. Beyer Blinder Belle proposed a revised plan in 2006, which was to cost $25 million. That year, the museum launched a capital campaign to raise funds for the renovation and the museum&#x27;s endowment; it had raised $21.5 million by April 2007.

The Cooper-Hewitt hired Gluckman Mayner Architects to design the renovation, along with Beyer Blinder Belle as preservation consultants. By October 2008, the cost of the project had increased to $64 million. The Smithsonian began renovating the two townhouses on 90th Street in 2008, with plans to relocate the museum&#x27;s offices from the mansion to the townhouses. In July 2009, Thompson left the museum to become the rector of the Royal College of Art.

==== 2010s to present ====
Bill Moggridge, a co-founder of IDEO and designer of the first laptop computer, served as Cooper-Hewitt&#x27;s director in January 2011. The Carnegie Mansion was closed to the public in July 2011, during which the museum held exhibitions at the headquarters of the United Nations and on Governors Island. The museum opened a new online retail shop in 2012. That year, the Cooper-Hewitt created an additional space in Harlem as an education facility. Designer Todd Oldham donated design services for the space. After Moggridge&#x27;s death in 2012, Caroline Baumann was named as the museum&#x27;s director in June 2013.

In June 2014, the museum&#x27;s name was changed again to Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum. A new graphic identity, wordmark, and new website were launched on this day. The identity was designed by Eddie Opara of Pentagram. The website was developed by Matcha Labs. On December 12, 2014, the Cooper Hewitt reopened to the public. Renovations included an &quot;Immersion Room&quot;, an interactive space that provides visitors digital access to the museums collection of wallpaper. The main exhibition space was expanded and the museum had a custom open-source font, which remains available for free download and modification, designed for its reopening. In March 2015 the museum introduced the use of a digital pen for visitors to collect objects with. 

In 2015, the terrace and garden renovations were completed and opened to the public, with design led by Walter Hood. 
The Cooper Hewitt hired conservator Cass Fino-Radin in 2016 to review the museum&#x27;s digital collection, a process which took two years. Baumann resigned as director in February 2020, following an investigation by the Smithsonian&#x27;s inspector general concerning her wedding to John Stewart Malcolmson in 2018. In response, several of the museum&#x27;s board member threatened to resign, claiming Baumann had been improperly forced out. In February 2022, Maria Nicanor was appointed as the museum&#x27;s director.

== Collection ==

The Cooper Hewitt collections consist of decorative and design objects. The museum&#x27;s original collection focused on architecture, sculpture, painted architecture, decorative arts, woodwork, metalwork, pottery, costume, musical instruments and furniture. The museum has more than 200,000 objects in its collection , although estimates range as high as 250,000. These range from matchbooks to shopping bags, porcelain from the Soviet Union, and the papers of graphic designer Tibor Kalman. The museum had a metalwork gallery, which showcased historic iron grillwork and a room devoted to ironwork, both of which no longer are focus rooms.

=== Visual art collection ===
The museum holds the world&#x27;s largest collection of works on paper by Hudson River School painter Frederic Edwin Church. By 1976, the museum&#x27;s collection included 200 Tiepolo paintings, 2,000 F. E. Church sketches, and a large number of Winslow Homer drawings. In 2002, a rare 16th-century drawing from Michelangelo (for which the Cooper Union Museum had paid $60 in 1962) was discovered in the Cooper-Hewitt&#x27;s collection.

=== Furniture collection ===
The Cooper Hewitt also has a large furniture collection. Some of the objects include a chair used by Abraham Lincoln during a visit to the Cooper Union, a cardboard easy chair designed by Frank Gehry, as well as &quot;twig and root&quot; furniture. Museum namesake Peter Cooper created the first steel chair in the United States, one of which resides in the museum collection.

=== Other objects ===
Upon its opening, Abram S. Hewitt&#x27;s wife, Sarah Amelia Hewitt donated a lace collection, George Hearn donated two fountains worth $1,000, and Lloyd Bryce&#x27;s wife donated art and objects from the Palace of Fontainebleau. When the museum acquired the Carnegie Mansion in 1972, it also received some interior decorations from the Widener family&#x27;s townhouse at 5 East 70th Street (now the site of an annex to the Henry Clay Frick House). By the time the modern museum opened in 1976, it was recorded as having lantern brackets, window grilles, a balcony, 4,000 metal artifacts, and 30,000 international symbols donated by Henry Dreyfuss and his wife Doris. It also had other objects such as 2,000 buttons, 4,280 match cases, lock-and-key sets, pots, skyscraper drawings, and many pieces of Art Deco and Art Nouveau design.

The museum has held notable objects in its collection such as John Lennon&#x27;s psychedelic Rolls-Royce. The car was donated by Lennon and Yoko Ono in 1978 and was auctioned off at Sotheby&#x27;s in mid-1985 for $2.09 million. A punch bowl replicated by Eleanor Roosevelt, a scarlet Valentine Olivetti typewriter, and an Adrian Saxe vase were also part of the collection. 

== Exhibitions ==

Exhibitions at the Cooper Hewitt explore the history and culture of design and decorative arts. Shows have historically focused on singular topics. The first themed shows were organized by Cooper Union Museum director Calvin S. Hathaway in 1933; beforehand, the objects in the museum&#x27;s collections were primarily used for academic purposes.

=== Before the 1970s ===
The museum hosted two special exhibitions at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. A 1968 exhibition called &quot;Please Be Seated&quot;, focused on contemporary chairs.

=== 1970s to 1990s ===
During the 1970s, the museum hosted exhibits on subjects such as resort and motel architecture; objects from the Brighton Pavilion; architectural drawings; John Lennon&#x27;s Rolls-Royce; Alvar Aalto&#x27;s architectural works, and hundreds of objects on loan from various other Smithsonian museums. The museum&#x27;s exhibits in the early 1980s concerned such themes as the history and culture of the ocean liner, puppets, hair styles, copy machine art, plants, British art, Scandinavian design, and teapots. In 1983, the Cooper-Hewitt was the first museum in the United States to exhibit the Amsterdam School. Topics of the museum&#x27;s exhibits in the second half of the 1980s included wine-related objects, a showcase of art related to Berlin, a tribute to art dealer Siegfried Bing, and subway posters.

When the Cooper-Hewitt showcased its own collections in 1992, it was the longest-running show in the museum&#x27;s history at the time, lasting 17 months.

==== Traveling exhibitions ====
The museum also tours exhibits through the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service. The first exhibit they toured was 1978&#x27;s &quot;Close Observation: Selected Oil Sketches by Frederic E. Church&quot;. In 1993, the Cooper-Hewitt created the exhibition &quot;The Power of Maps&quot;, which was its first exhibition to be shown on the National Mall at the S. Dillon Ripley Gallery. The exhibit featured upwards of 200 maps from around the world. William III and Mary II of England were the focus of a 1988 exhibition. An exhibition featuring 16th- and 17th-century decorative arts from Burghley House.

=== 2000s to present ===
The jewelry of Van Cleef &amp; Arpels was the focus of an exhibition in 2011. That year, artist Sonia Delaunay had a solo show at the museum. The Cooper-Hewitt worked with the Walker Art Center, in 2012, to develop &quot;Graphic Design – Now In Production&quot;, which showcases graphic design that has been created since 2000. An additional exhibition was held in 2012, in light of the museum&#x27;s closing due to renovations, at the United Nations Headquarters called &quot;Design With the Other 90% Cities&quot;, about design and global issues.

Other exhibitions at the museum have included Puiforcat silver, wallpaper, the works of Alexander Girard, and universal design. In 2015, the museum hosted The Algorithm Auction, the world&#x27;s first auction of computer algorithms.

In Cooper Hewitt&#x27;s Face Values installation for the LONDON DESIGN BIENNALE 2018, a live facial data became the basis of dynamic graphic images and provocative conversations between humans and machines. The exhibition explored alternative uses of technologies that were typically used for security, surveillance, and behavioural profiling. Curated by Ellen Lupton, the installation was awarded with the LONDON DESIGN BIENNALE EMOTIONAL STATED MEDAL WINNER 2018.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Cooper Hewitt launched a digital exhibition platform. Designed by Linked by Air, the platform allows users to explore objects one by one in thematic sequences, much they would wander around the physical galleries of an exhibition.

== Programs ==

=== Outreach ===
The museum&#x27;s National Design Education Center is sponsored by Target. Ongoing programs for preschoolers on up are offered, along with summer camps, professional development, educator resources, and even a master&#x27;s program. In 2012, the Cooper Hewitt started work on its Harlem location, designed by Todd Oldham and sponsored by Target, which provided free workshops and programming.

=== Initiatives ===
The Cooper Hewitt is home to the National Design Awards. They also support a master&#x27;s degree program offered in conjunction with Parsons School of Design. In 2006, the Cooper Hewitt and Mayor Michael Bloomberg declared October 15–21 National Design Week in New York City. The week focuses on outreach throughout the city, including schools, and organizations across the United States. The museum is free for the week. The museum sponsored a bike rack competition in 2008. The winners of the contest were a part of an exhibition at the museum.

In the early 2000s, the Cooper-Hewitt&#x27;s website displayed only 500 of the 250,000 items in the museum&#x27;s collection. The website was overhauled in 2006, following a $2 million gift from some of the museum&#x27;s board members; the updated website provided educational programs and photographs of other objects in the museum&#x27;s collection. In 2013, the Cooper Hewitt took over the code of Planetary, an iOS app that creates graphic visualizations of songs, and released the source code to the public. Media sources reported at the time that it was the museum&#x27;s first-ever acquisition of software for exhibition purposes. After iOS App Store updates rendered the source code obsolete, an Australian developer released a patched version of the app in 2020.

== Building ==
The Cooper Hewitt is located in the Andrew Carnegie Mansion and two adjacent townhouses at 9 and 11 East 90th Street. The 64-room Georgian mansion was completed in 1902 as the home for Andrew Carnegie, his wife Louise, and their daughter Margaret Carnegie Miller. The property has a large private garden. The museum acquired the mansion and the house at 9 East 90th Street in 1972, followed by 11 East 90th Street in 1989. When the museum first obtained the house, the first and second floors were used as exhibit space, while the third floor contained the museum&#x27;s library.

The museum closed for a $20 million renovation in 1995, reopening the next year. Another renovation was completed in 2014; that renovation cost $91 million and was the largest in the museum&#x27;s history, partially financed by the museum endowment. To celebrate the reopening of the museum in 2015, the Cooper Hewitt released a downloadable 3D scan of the building.

== Library and study rooms ==
The museum&#x27;s library was originally known as the Doris and Henry Dreyfuss Study Center. The library was described in the 1980s as comprising 45,000 volumes (including 4,000 rare copies), over 1.5 million pictures, and various design journals and magazines. Its holdings covered such disparate subjects as interior, industrial, and graphic design; furniture; and theater. The Cooper Hewitt also includes the Drue Heinz Study Center for Drawings and Prints and the Henry Luce Study Room for American Art, which were added to the museum in the 1990s.

== Attendance ==
The Cooper Hewitt is the only Smithsonian museum to charge an admission fee to visitors. The museum receives approximately $500,000 a year in revenue from admissions.

The museum recorded about 12,000 monthly visitors, or 144,000 annual visitors, by 2002. , the museum sees approximately 150,000 visitors a year.

== Reception and commentary ==
When the Cooper-Hewitt moved into the Carnegie Mansion, a &quot;Newsday&quot; critic called the first exhibition &quot;an unprecedented opportunity to see a museum as a mind-expanding playground&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that it was &quot;the foremost American museum of antique and contemporary design&quot;. Both the &quot;Post&quot; and &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote that the Cooper-Hewitt was similar in scale only to the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris, and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.

A critic for &quot;Condé Nast Traveler&quot; wrote that the &quot;Cooper Hewitt is worth a visit both for the collection and also for the building itself&quot;.

<doc id="1007122" wikidata="Q30587611" url="?curid=1007122" title="Primary somatosensory cortex">
<text>In neuroanatomy, the primary somatosensory cortex is located in the postcentral gyrus of the brain&#x27;s parietal lobe, and is part of the somatosensory system. It was initially defined from surface stimulation studies of Wilder Penfield, and parallel surface potential studies of Bard, Woolsey, and Marshall. Although initially defined to be roughly the same as Brodmann areas 3, 1 and 2, more recent work by Kaas has suggested that for homogeny with other sensory fields only area 3 should be referred to as &quot;primary somatosensory cortex&quot;, as it receives the bulk of the thalamocortical projections from the sensory input fields.

At the primary somatosensory cortex, tactile representation is orderly arranged (in an inverted fashion) from the toe (at the top of the cerebral hemisphere) to mouth (at the bottom). However, some body parts may be controlled by partially overlapping regions of cortex. Each cerebral hemisphere of the primary somatosensory cortex only contains a tactile representation of the opposite (contralateral) side of the body. The amount of primary somatosensory cortex devoted to a body part is not proportional to the absolute size of the body surface, but, instead, to the relative density of cutaneous tactile receptors located on that body part. The density of cutaneous tactile receptors on a body part is generally indicative of the degree of sensitivity of tactile stimulation experienced at said body part. For this reason, the human lips and hands have a larger representation than other body parts.

==Structure==

=== Brodmann areas 3, 1, and 2 ===
Brodmann areas 3, 1, and 2 make up the primary somatosensory cortex of the human brain (or S1). Because Brodmann sliced the brain somewhat obliquely, he encountered area 1 first; however, from anterior to posterior, the Brodmann designations are 3, 1, and 2, respectively.

Brodmann area (BA) 3 is subdivided into two cytoarchitectonic areas labeled as 3a and 3b.

== Clinical significance ==
Lesions affecting the primary somatosensory cortex produce characteristic symptoms including: agraphesthesia, astereognosia, hemihypesthesia, and loss of vibration, proprioception and fine touch (because the third-order neuron of the medial-lemniscal pathway cannot synapse in the cortex). It can also produce hemineglect, if it affects the non-dominant hemisphere. Destruction of brodmann area 3, 1, and 2 results in contralateral hemihypesthesia and astereognosis.

It could also reduce nociception, thermoception, and crude touch, but, since information from the spinothalamic tract is interpreted mainly by other areas of the brain (see insular cortex and cingulate gyrus), it is not as relevant as the other symptoms.

<doc id="1007133" wikidata="Q7442079" url="?curid=1007133" title="Seattle City Council">
<text>The Seattle City Council is the legislative body of the city of Seattle, Washington. The Council consists of nine members serving four-year terms, seven of which are elected by electoral districts and two of which are elected in citywide at-large positions; all elections are non-partisan. It has the responsibility of approving the city&#x27;s budget, and passes all legislation related to the city&#x27;s police, firefighting, parks, libraries, and electricity, water supply, solid waste, and drainage utilities.
(The mayor of Seattle is not considered part of council.)

==Members==
:&quot;Last election: November 2024&quot;

;Notes
==Elections==
Election of city council members occur on odd-numbered years, with at-large seats staggered from district seats. City council members&#x27; terms begin January 1 although public ceremonies are held on the following Monday. The council positions are officially non-partisan and the ballot gives no party designations. Party identification is based on candidates&#x27; voluntary self-identification. Like other elections in Washington, all candidates run together in the primary with the top two progressing to the general election. Beginning in 2027, Seattle will begin to use ranked-choice voting to determine the top two candidates from the primary who will compete in the general election.

Candidates may participate in Seattle&#x27;s unique democracy voucher program, which provides residents with vouchers to give candidates for public campaign funding.

==Districts==
Beginning in 2015, the geographic outline of the 7 districts and 2 citywide positions are as follows. Some neighborhoods overlap more than one district, indicated with an asterisk*. Redistricting occurs every 10 years following the decennial U.S. census, beginning in 2022.


==History==
Seattle was first incorporated as a town by an act of the Territorial Legislature on January 14, 1865. The town charter established a five-member board of trustees to govern Seattle, which appointed citizens to other positions. The act was repealed January 18, 1867, after most of the town&#x27;s leading citizens petitioned for its dissolution. Seattle was again incorporated, this time as a City, on December 2, 1869. The new unicameral legislature, known as the Common Council, was elected at-large to one year terms. At-large election was replaced in 1884 by a system of 14 wards and four members elected at-large, all elected to two-year terms.

The Home Rule Charter, adopted in 1890, reorganized the city council into a bicameral legislature, with a nine-member Board of Aldermen and a sixteen-member House of Delegates.

===District-based elections===

In 2013, Seattle voters approved Charter Amendment 19 calling for the nine citywide Seattle City Council positions to be divided into seven district-elected seats and two citywide, at-large seats. The elections for the two at-large seats are held as separate contests, thus results are not proportional. Each seat is filled in two-step process - a primary election is held in August, with the two most popular candidates going on to a general election in November. The partial transition to districts started with 2013 elections for Positions 2, 4, 6, and 8 being truncated, two-year terms.

The 2015 election cycle featured all nine seats, except the seven district positions were elected to full, four-year terms, and the two at-large positions would be for truncated, two-year terms. The first primary based on the new combined district/at-large system was held on August 4, 2015, with the general elections held on November 3, 2015.

The seven district seats were up for election again in 2023; the two at-large seats will be up for election again in 2025. Only two of the seven districts retained their incumbent member in the 2023 election.

===Timeline===
*1869–1883 – Seven at-large Council members elected for one-year terms.
*1884 – Nine Council members elected: three from each of the three wards, elected to two-year terms.
*1886 – One ward added, Council reduced to eight members: two elected from each ward for two-years terms.
*1890 – The Home Rule Charter established eight wards and bicameral legislature. A Board of Delegates composed of nine at-large members was elected for four-year terms. House of Delegates had 16 members – Two from each ward, elected for two-year terms.
*1892 – One ward added to make nine. Both houses to have nine members – all elected from wards.
*1896 – New Home Rule Charter reestablished unicameral legislature with nine wards. One Council member elected from each ward for two years and four elected at large for four-year terms.
*1905 – Two wards added to make 11. One Council member from each with four at-large – 15 council members total.
*1907 – The Charter was amended twice during the year, the first time adding two more wards, increasing the size of Council to 17. Later, another ward was added (to make 14), increasing Council to 18 members.
*1910 – The Charter was amended to abolish wards, reduce Council to nine at-large positions elected to three-year terms. This took effect in 1911 and remained constant until 1946. The 1910 Charter amendments also made the elections non-partisan. Prior to that candidates for Council (and other City offices) ran on party tickets.
*1946 – The new Charter created the four-year term.
*2013 – City voters pass measure changing councilmember elections to a mostly-district-based scheme.
*2015 – First councilmember elections held under new combined district/at-large scheme.

<doc id="1007137" wikidata="Q167277" url="?curid=1007137" title="Aero L-29 Delfín">
<text>The Aero L-29 Delfín (, NATO reporting name: Maya) is a military jet trainer developed and manufactured by Czechoslovakian aviation manufacturer Aero Vodochody. It is the country&#x27;s first locally designed and constructed jet aircraft, and likely the biggest aircraft industrial programme to take place in any of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) countries except the Soviet Union.

In response to a sizable requirement for a common jet-propelled trainer to be adopted across the diverse nations of the Eastern Bloc, Aero decided to embark upon their own design project with a view to suitably satisfying this demand. On 5 April 1959, an initial prototype, designated as the XL-29, performed its maiden flight. The L-29 was selected to become the standard trainer for the air forces of Warsaw Pact nations, for which it was delivered from the 1960s onwards. During the early 1970s, the type was succeeded in the principal trainer role by another Aero-built aircraft, the L-39 Albatros, heavily contributing to a decline in demand for the earlier L-29 and the end of its production during 1974.

During the course of the programme, in excess of 3,000 L-29 Delfín trainers were produced. Of these, around 2,000 were reported to have been delivered to the Soviet Union, where it was used as the standard trainer for the Soviet Air Force. Of the others, which included both armed and unarmed models, many aircraft were delivered to the various COMECON countries while others were exported to various overseas nations, including Egypt, Syria, Indonesia, Nigeria and Uganda. Reportedly, the L-29 has been used in active combat during several instances, perhaps the most high-profile being the use of Nigerian aircraft during the Nigerian Civil War of the late 1960s and of Egyptian L-29s against Israeli tanks during the brief Yom Kippur War of 1973.

==Development==
In the late 1950s, the Soviet Air Force commenced the search for a suitable jet-powered replacement for its fleet of piston-engined trainers; over time, this requirement was progressively broadened towards the goal of developing a trainer aircraft that could be adopted and in widespread use throughout the national air forces of the Eastern Bloc countries. Around the same time, Czechoslovakia had also been independently developing its own requirements for a suitable jet successor to its then-current propeller-powered trainer aircraft. In response to these demands, Aero decided to develop its own aircraft design; the effort was headed by a pair of aerospace engineers, Z. Rublič and K. Tomáš. Their work was centered upon the desire to produce a single design that would be suitable performing both basic and advanced levels of the training regime, carrying pilots straight through to being prepared to operate frontline combat aircraft.

The basic design concept was to produce a straightforward, easy-to-build and operate aircraft. Accordingly, both simplicity and ruggedness were stressed in the development process, leading to the adoption of manual flight controls, large flaps, and the incorporation of perforated airbrakes positioned on the fuselage sides. Aerodynamically, the L-29 was intentionally designed to possess stable and docile flight characteristics; this decision contributed to an enviable safety record for the type. The sturdy L-29 was able to operate under austere conditions, including performing take-offs from grass, sand or unprepared fields. On 5 April 1959, the prototype XL-29 conducted its maiden flight, powered by a British Bristol Siddeley Viper turbojet engine. The second prototype, which flew shortly thereafter, was instead powered by the Czech-designed M701 engine. The M-701 engine was used in all subsequent aircraft.

During 1961, a small pre-production batch of L-29s were evaluated against the Polish PZL TS-11 Iskra and the Russian Yakovlev Yak-30, the main rival submissions for the Warsaw Pact&#x27;s standardised trainer. Shortly after the completion of the fly-offs, it was announced that the L-29 had been selected as the winner; according to aviation author John C. Fredrikson, this outcome had been highly unexpected and surprising to several observers. Regardless of the result, Poland chose to continue to pursue the development and procurement of the TS-11; however, all of the other Warsaw Pact countries decided to adopt the Delfín under the agreements of COMECON.

During April 1963, full-scale production of the L-29 commenced; 3,600 aircraft were manufactured over a production run of 11 years. During its production life, several derivatives of the L-29 were developed, such as a dedicated, single-seat, aerobatic version, which was designated as the L-29A &quot;Akrobat&quot;. Another model, an armed reconnaissance version complete with multiple downwards-looking cameras installed in the rear cockpit position, referred to as the L-29R, was also under development; however, during 1965, the L-29R project was terminated. Optional armaments could be installed upon some models, consisting of either a detachable gun pod or a pod containing up to four unguided missiles, which could be set upon hardpoints underneath each wing.

==Design==
The Aero L-29 Delfín is a jet-powered trainer aircraft, known for its straightforward and simplistic design and construction. In terms of its basic configuration, it used a mid-wing matched with a T-tail arrangement; the wings were unswept and accommodated air intakes for the engines within the wing roots. The undercarriage was reinforced and capable of withstanding considerable stresses. According to Fredriksen, the L-29 was relatively underpowered, yet exhibited several favourable characteristics in its flight performance, such as its ease of handling. The primary flying controls are manually operated; both the flaps and airbrakes were actuated via hydraulic systems.

Production aircraft were powered by the Czech-designed Motorlet M-701 turbojet engine, which was capable of generating up to 1,960lbf of thrust. Between 1961 and 1968, approximately 9,250 engines were completed; according to reports, no fewer than 5,000 of these engines were manufactured in support of the Delfín programme. The student pilot and their instructor were placed in a tandem seating layout underneath separate canopies, the instructor being placed in a slightly elevated position to better oversee the student. Both the student and instructor were provisioned with ejection seats; these were intentionally interlinked to fire in a synchronised manner if either seat was deployed as to eliminate any possibility of a mid-air collision between the two ejector seats.

During their late life, many L-29s were resold onto private operators and have seen use in the civil sector. It has become common for various modifications to be carried out to convert the type for such use; these changes would commonly include the removal of military-orientated equipment (such as the gun sight), the replacement of the metric altimeters with Western counterparts, the addition of alternative radio systems, and new ejection seats. It was also routine for several subsystems, such as the oxygen system, to be disabled rather than removed.

==Operational history==

In excess of 2,000 L-29 Delfins were ultimately supplied to the Soviet Air Force. Like the majority of Soviet-operated aircraft, it acquired its own NATO reporting name, &quot;Maya.&quot; In the trainer role, the L-29 enabled air forces to adopt an &quot;all-through&quot; training regime using only jet-powered aircraft, entirely replacing earlier piston-engined types.

The Delfín served in basic, intermediate and weapons training roles. For this latter mission, they were equipped with hardpoints to carry gunpods, bombs or rockets; according to Fredrikson, the L-29 functioned as a relatively good ground-attack aircraft when deployed as such. It saw several uses in this active combat role, such as when a number of Egyptian L-29s were dispatched on attack missions against Israeli ground forces during the Yom Kippur War of 1973. The type was also used in anger during the Nigerian Civil War of the late 1960s. On 16 July 1975, a Czechoslovak Air Force L-29 reportedly shot down a Polish civilian biplane piloted by Dionizy Bielański, who had been attempting to defect to the West.

The L-29 was supplanted in the inventory of many of its operators by the Aero L-39 Albatros. The L-29 which was commonly used alongside the newer L-39 for a time. The type was used extensively to conduct ground attack missions in the First Nagorno-Karabakh War by Azeri forces. At least 14 were shot down by Armenian air-defences, out of the total inventory of 18 L-29s; the Azeri Air Force lost large amounts of its air force due to anti aircraft fire.

On 2 October 2007, an unmodified L-29 was used for the world&#x27;s first jet flight powered solely by 100 per cent biodiesel fuel. Pilots Carol Sugars and Douglas Rodante flew their Delphin Jet from Stead Airport, Reno, Nevada to Leesburg International Airport, Leesburg, Florida in order to promote environmentally friendly fuels in aviation.

The L-29, much like its L-39 successor, has found use in air racing, some of which have been re-engined with the British Armstrong Siddeley Viper turbojet engine. From 10 September to 14 September 2008, a pair of L-29s took first and second place at the Reno Air Races. Both L-29s consistently posted laps at or above 500 miles per hour; former Astronaut Curt Brown took first place in &quot;Viper,&quot; followed by Red Bull racer Mike Mangold in &quot;Euroburner.&quot;

Russia has claimed that it destroyed a pair of Georgian L-29s during the 2008 South Ossetia war. On 18 January 2015, separatist forces in the War in Donbas claimed that they possessed an operational L-29.

<text>The Perito Moreno (), Francisco Gormaz or Bismarck Glacier is a glacier located in Los Glaciares National Park in southwest Santa Cruz Province, Argentina, and originated in the Magallanes Region in Chile, being also part of the Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins National Park. It is one of the most important tourist attractions in the Argentine Patagonia.

The ice formation, in length, is one of 48 glaciers fed by the Southern Patagonian Ice Field located in the Andes system shared with Chile which has a small part of the origins of the glacier. This ice field is the world&#x27;s third largest reserve of fresh water.

The Perito Moreno Glacier, located from El Calafate, was named after the explorer Francisco Moreno, a pioneer who studied the region in the 19th century and played a major role in defending the Argentinian thesis in the 1902 Arbitral award of the Andes between Argentina and Chile.

==Status==
Since 2020 the glacier has been retreating on its northern front, possibly due to climate change. It was previously one of the few unusual glaciers that maintained a state of equilibrium during the late 20th and early 21st centuries because it was accumulating mass at a rate similar to that of its loss. The reason for its unusually long period of stability remains debated by glaciologists.

The terminus of the Perito Moreno Glacier is wide, with an average height of above the surface of the water of Argentino Lake, in Argentina. It has a total ice depth of .

== History ==
In 1879, the British Chilean Navy captain, Juan Tomás Rogers, was the first non-indigenous person to sight the majestic glacier which he named &quot;Francisco Gormaz&quot;, after the Director of the Hydrographic Office of the Chilean Navy, sponsoring organization of the discovering expedition.
Some years later, Rudolph Hauthal, attached to the Argentine Boundary Commission, saw the glacier and decided to name it &quot;Bismarck&quot; in honor of the Prussian Chancellor.

In 1881, the Boundary Treaty between Chile and Argentina was signed, which defined the boundaries of both countries in the Andes mountain range up to the 52nd parallel. The glacier is east of the Andes Mountains and empties into Lake Argentino, which also is under Argentine sovereignty. Before the treaty, the area was in dispute between both countries during the East Patagonia, Tierra del Fuego and Strait of Magellan Dispute.

Finally, in 1899, after long years of research, compilation of archaeological material, and surveys of the area, Lieutenant Iglesias, who was in charge of the studies for the Argentine Hydrographic Institute, named the glacier Perito Moreno in homage to Francisco Moreno.

With the Southern Patagonian Ice Field dispute, its origin was in dispute until the signing of the 1998 agreement where the line that was set crosses the origin of the glacier leaving a small part in Chile and all the rest in Argentina.

==Rupture==

Pressure from the weight of the ice slowly pushes the glacier over the inner fjord of Lake Argentino reaching the coast of Península de Magallanes and bisecting the lake at an area called the Brazo Rico (Rico Arm) on one side and the Canal de los Témpanos (Iceberg Channel) on the other. With no outlet, the water level on the Brazo Rico side of the lake can rise by as much as 30 meters above the level of the main body of Argentino Lake. Intermittently, the pressure produced by the height of the dammed water breaks through the ice barrier causing a spectacular rupture, sending a massive outpouring of water from the Brazo Rico section to the main body of Lake Argentino and the Santa Cruz river. As the water exits Brazo Rico, the scored shoreline is exposed, showing evidence of the height of the water build-up. This dam–ice-bridge–rupture cycle recurs naturally between once a year to less than once every decade.

The glacier advances between June and December and recedes between December and April. The formation of an ice barrier is a complex process, since there is a feedback mechanism between the glacier and the lake, which affects the oscillations of the position of the glacial front in a fairly stable way.

Different behaviors have been observed during the filling and in the processes of discharge of the water, which have been classified into three types: sudden, progressive and minor burst. In a sudden type event, the maximum discharge can reach 8000 m³ per second, while a smaller event only evacuates 123 m³.

The ruptures do not have a specific frequency. Traditionally it was estimated one every three or four years, but there have been times where they happened in shorter periods and others in which it did not occur for many years, causing fears that the phenomenon might possibly have stopped occurring.

The ruptures occurred in the years, 1917, 1935, 1940, 1942, 1947, 1952, 1953, 1956, 1960, 1963, 1966, 1970, 1972, 1975, 1977, 1980, 1984, 1988, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2012, 2013 (two events, one in January and one in December), 2016, 2018 and 2019.

=== The first recorded rupture (1917) ===
Evidence from tree rings on the shorelines indicates that there were no major damming and rupture events of the Brazo Rico from about 1635 until the 20th century. The front of the glacier began to move towards the opposite bank at the end of the 19th century. In 1899 it was 750 meters from the Magallanes peninsula. In the first five years of the twentieth century it continued its progression, managing to close its arm for the first time in 1917, followed by the first break.

=== Sudden discharge ruptures ===
In the 21st century, the events of 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2012 are classified as sudden download events.

In 2004, the peak level of the dammed lake was 10.5 m and discharge flow peak had a value of 5000 m³ / s, finishing with matching lake levels after four days. It was estimated that 10,000 tourists watched this event. In 2006 the level difference reached by the Rico arm was 5.4 m and on 10 March, the retained water began to escape, which caused the dike to collapse on the 13th. The discharge rate rose to 5850 m³ / s, concluding the discharge period on March 14, when the levels of the Rico arm matched the rest of the lake. In the 2008 event, the discharge flow had a peak value of 8000 m³ / s, finishing with matching lake levels after about four days. At the 2012 event, the discharge flow peak had a value lower than the previous ones, 2000 m³ / s, so it took longer to evacuate the accumulated water, concluding only after 14 days.

=== Progressive discharge ruptures ===
In progressive unloading events the whole process slows down, although an ice set-up occurs.

In the southern summer of 2013 there was an event of this type. By September 9, 2012, the front of the glacier had shortened the distance that separated it from the coast of the Magallanes peninsula to only 30 meters, which had caused the Rico arm to accumulate water, reaching a maximum level of 2.2 m on November 21, when the water managed to overcome the ice wall by opening a subglacial tunnel, beginning the discharge process. Tunnel formation was visible directly on day 26 and subsequently the tunnel collapsed. On February 4, 2013, the discharge flow reached a maximum value: 205 m³ / s. The discharge continued, albeit in a very slow way, as a result of new semi-clogging, so it was just completed, when both levels were the same, 85 days after it started. The distance between the glacier wall and the peninsula was over 100 m towards the beginning of March. At the end of December 2013 there was another event of the progressive type with similar characteristics to what had happened the previous year. The level of Lake Rico reached a difference of 3.7 m and the evacuation of the liquid lasted 65 days, reaching a maximum discharge flow of 220 m³ / s.

===Minor discharge ruptures===

Occasionally, the glacial front does not completely obstruct the natural passage of water with an ice dam, but it approaches close enough to prevent water from passing freely, so without reaching elevation, an arm cut in Rico occurs. These events are classified as minor downloads. 
This is what happened in October 1996, when the Rico arm rose about a meter. At the end of that month the water pressure opened a greater passage in the walls of the glacial front and the discharge began, but slowly, since the passage had not been sufficiently open, so the maximum peak of the discharge flow occurred at the end of January with a value of 123 m³ / s, the dimensions being equalized on both sides only at the beginning of April.8 The events of 1994, 1995 and 1997 show similar behavior and magnitudes to those of 1996.

=== Other featured events ===
The phenomenon was presented again in 1935. At the close of 1939, due to the flooding caused by the embalmed waters, which affected numerous agricultural establishments, and without even glimpsing the economic value that from the point of view this natural event could represent tourism, the Argentine Navy Ministry launched explosives on the ice indication, unable to obtain the intended result of artificially consolidating a gap for the evacuation of water. The break occurred naturally in February of the following year. In 1952 the closure produced a flooded area of 6670 ha; It affected fields of crops and livestock, but not buildings.

The rupture of 1966 was the one that produced one of the largest volumes of water evacuated by the Santa Cruz River, which exceeded 2000 m³ per second, measured at the Charles Fuhr capacity station.

==Tourism==

Due to its size and accessibility, Perito Moreno is one of the major tourist attractions in southern Patagonia and the rupture of this glacier is considered one of the most impressive natural spectacles in the world. The rupture events benefit the area by producing enormous international visibility, which translates into sources of income for the region&#x27;s growing tourism development, which has its support base in the city of El Calafate. The city has an international airport, with many tour companies running daily tours.
A large visitor centre at the site features a walking circuit which allows visitors to view the southern flank and the east-facing edge of the glacier.
In recent years, trekking tours on the ice have gained popularity. The two standard tours are a &quot;mini-trekking&quot; option, consisting of a short walk of about an hour and a half, and a &quot;big ice&quot; version, which is usually about five hours. Tour companies generally provide crampons to customers. As the Zone closes to the public during the night - after 8 pm - on some occasions the ice bridge collapses without spectators, as happened in the event of March 11, 2018.

== Fauna ==
A small glacier stonefly called Andiperla willinki inhabits the glacier. Also called &quot;the pearl of the Andes&quot; or &quot;dragon of Patagonia&quot; is a kind of plecoptera of the family Gripopterygidae that inhabits the Patagonian glaciers in Argentina and Chile, spending its entire life on the ice. It measures approximately and feeds on bacteria that live on the ice brought by the wind.

It was found on the Upsala Glacier and described by Aubert Willink in 1956. Due to its rarity, small size, and extreme habitat, they believed it had become extinct. However, it was rediscovered in 2001 in a Torres del Paine glacier in a 20 m deep recess; on this occasion, it was named by the crew as &quot;Patagonian dragon&quot;.

<doc id="1007159" wikidata="Q4915987" url="?curid=1007159" title="Birdhouse in Your Soul">
<text>&quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul&quot; is a song by American alternative rock band They Might Be Giants. It was released in late 1989 through Elektra Records as the lead single from the album &quot;Flood&quot;, making the single the band&#x27;s first release on a major label. &quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul&quot; is the band&#x27;s highest-charting single in both the US and the UK, and is one of their best-known songs.

The song&#x27;s lyric is narrated from the perspective of a nightlight. It includes an atypical snare drum pattern and modulation among four keys. Production was handled by Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley.

==Background==
&quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul&quot; was one of four songs on &quot;Flood&quot; produced by Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley; these four songs alone exhausted two-thirds of the album&#x27;s budget. The track was selected early on for release as a single. An early two-minute demo version of the song was made available by the band via its Dial-A-Song service a year before they signed with Elektra.

==Recording and composition==
The melody to &quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul&quot; was written several years prior to its recording for &quot;Flood&quot;. John Linnell has stated that he &quot;shoehorned&quot; the lyric into the existing melody. The lyric, which is narrated from the perspective of a blue nightlight shaped like a canary, is hyper-associative, rapidly connecting disparate topics such as Jason and the Argonauts and &quot;The Longines Symphonette&quot;. Elizabeth Sandifer and S. Alexander Reed have noted movement between lyrical themes is a recurring motif throughout &quot;Flood&quot;. However, Linnell has commented that he feels the lyrics ultimately sound like stand-in &quot;dummy lyrics&quot;.

&quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul&quot; features an unconventional drum beat, which was programmed by Linnell, wherein the snare drum sounds on every beat. During production, Linnell created a demo using a more standard pop drum beat with the snare drum only on the backbeats. However, Langer and Winstanley emphatically rejected this change, which Linnell credits as saving the song.

Musically, Reed and Sandifer note that the song makes an unanticipated jump from its initial key of C major to E-flat major, and then back to C major. The frequent key changes (18 in total) may be a product of the album&#x27;s largely digital composition and production; they call the album in general &quot;modular&quot; in its movement between musical ideas. The track&#x27;s later shifts to F-sharp minor and A major divide the octave into equal intervals. The music also interpolates elements of &quot;Summer in the City&quot; by The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful. The car horn-like trumpet sound in the bridge of &quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul&quot; recalls the sounds of traffic in &quot;Summer in the City&quot; and both songs use similar rhythms in their chord progressions. Linnell states that these references were inspired by the intense heat during the album&#x27;s recording in the summer of 1989.

In April 1990, They Might Be Giants appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; to promote the release of &quot;Flood&quot;. As part of the appearance, Linnell and Flansburgh performed &quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul&quot; with Doc Severinsen and the Tonight Show Band. Severinsen&#x27;s unusually fast count-in resulted in a performance with a noticeably higher tempo than the album recording. The band adopted a similar tempo for subsequent live performances.

==Music video==
The music video for &quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul&quot; was directed by Adam Bernstein and filmed in New York County&#x27;s Surrogate&#x27;s Courthouse building in Manhattan in 1989. The video features Linnell and Flansburgh moving and performing erratically amidst a group of dancers dressed in red plaid shirts. In the video, the dancers wear masks made from sunglasses affixed with an image of the eyes of William Allen White, whose face is used frequently in the band&#x27;s visual material. These props were designed by John Flansburgh. In an article on They Might Be Giants music videos, Emily Petermann speculates that the zombie-like behavior of the dancers, coupled with the video&#x27;s warehouse setting, evokes &quot;oppressed factory workers&quot;. Petermann finds this view to be at odds with the song&#x27;s &quot;cheerful&quot; music. On the other hand, the &quot;non sequitur&quot; lyrics and &quot;surreal&quot; musical elements—such as modulation—are complemented by moments of &quot;nonsense&quot; in the video, such as when &quot;[Linnell and Flansburgh&#x27;s] performance becomes embedded in a bizarre situation or the performance is abandoned altogether.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul&quot; received positive attention from critics. In his review of &quot;Flood&quot; for Allmusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine called it one of the band&#x27;s &quot;finest singles&quot;. Reviewing the single alone, Stewart Mason elaborates that, compared to previous releases, the high production value highlights Linnell&#x27;s and Flansburgh&#x27;s &quot;knack for dynamics and arrangement.&quot; Mason also speculates that the song&#x27;s popularity stems from the modest depth of its lyric, which is somewhat oblique on the surface but ultimately &quot;easy to figure out&quot;, giving the listener a sense of pride in their understanding. Chris Willman, writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, predicted the track would become a &quot;college radio standard&quot;.

===Commercial performance===
&quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul&quot; peaked at #3 on the United States Modern Rock Tracks chart and #6 on the UK Singles Chart. It is They Might Be Giants&#x27;s highest-charting single in both countries. In 2010, the song was featured in an advertisement for Clarks shoes; the song returned to the UK singles chart for three weeks, peaking at #70.

==Cover versions==
A cover of &quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul&quot; was featured in the &quot;Pushing Daisies&quot; episode &quot;Pigeon&quot;, which premiered on October 24, 2007. This version was arranged and performed by series composer Jim Dooley with vocals from actors Kristin Chenoweth and Ellen Greene. The cover also appears on the show&#x27;s official soundtrack. In a 2015 &quot;Decider&quot; article revisiting the episode, Joe Reid wrote that the selection of &quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul&quot; contributed to &quot;a moment that must have felt tailor-made for the audience members who responded to it&quot;.

The song was also covered by Neil Cicierega as Lemon Demon on his second album, &quot;Live From the Haunted Candle Shop&quot;, which was released on July 23, 2003. The cover is 129 BPM, which is 29 faster than the original at 100 BPM.

<text>Cultural conservatism is described as the protection of the cultural heritage of a nation state, or of a culture not defined by state boundaries. It is sometimes associated with criticism of multiculturalism, anti-immigration sentiment, and opposition to illegal immigration. Because their cultural preservationist objectives are in conflict with those of anti-racists, cultural conservatives are often accused of racism. Despite this, however, cultural conservatism can be more nuanced in its approach to minority languages and cultures; it is sometimes focused upon heritage language learning or threatened language revitalization, such as of the distinctive local dialect of French in Quebec, Acadian French, Canadian Gaelic, and the Mi&#x27;kmaq language in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, or the Irish language in Newfoundland. Other times cultural conservatism is more focused upon the preservation of an ethnic minority&#x27;s endangered ancestral culture, such as those of Native Americans.

In the United States, &quot;cultural conservatism&quot; may imply a conservative position in the culture wars. Because cultural conservatism expresses the social dimension of conservatism according to the political compass theory, it is sometimes referred to as social conservatism. Instead, &quot;social conservatism&quot; describes conservative moral and social values, or traditionalist conservative stances on socio-cultural issues, such as abortion and same-sex marriage, in opposition to &quot;cultural liberalism&quot; (&quot;social liberalism&quot; in the United States). Meanwhile, &quot;nationalism&quot; also differs from cultural conservatism as it does not always focus upon a particular culture.

== Arguments ==

=== In favor ===

Proponents argue that cultural conservatism preserves the cultural identity of a country. They often promote assimilation into the dominant culture, believing that monoculturalism is more constructive to national unity. They claim that assimilation facilitates the integration of immigrants and ethnic minorities into broader society, framing cultural conservatism as a solution to ethnic strife. Researchers note that the more culturally homogeneous a community is, the more people trust each other. Trust was shown to decrease in more culturally diverse areas.

Proponents of cultural conservatism have criticized multiculturalism, believing that cultural pluralism is detrimental to a unified national identity. They argue that cultural diversity only serves to marginalize immigrants by othering them as outsiders in society. In some countries multiculturalism is believed to create de facto racial segregation in the form of ethnic enclaves. Opposition to immigration is also a common stance among proponents. Immigrants often bring the cultures, religions, and languages of their home countries with them, sometimes influencing and changing the cultures of their host countries. Proponents of cultural conservatism argue that some of these imported cultural practices, such as hijabs, polygamy, child marriage, and female genital mutilation, are in direct conflict with the values of the dominant culture.

=== Against ===

Opponents argue that cultural conservatism is detrimental to cultural diversity. They criticize cultural conservatism for promoting cultural intolerance, creating narrow ethnocentric mindsets, and stifling self-expression. Opponents cite numerous historical atrocities that originated from extreme forms of cultural conservatism, such as racism, genocide, ethnic cleansing, colonialism, and racial segregation. They claim that cultural assimilation leads to the marginalization of minorities who do not conform to the dominant culture.

Opponents have supported multiculturalism, believing it creates a more diverse and tolerant society. They claim it helps people of the ethnic majority to learn more about other cultures, adapt better to social change, and be more tolerant of diversity. They also believe multiculturalism brings more attention to the historical accomplishments of other ethnic groups, which had been neglected in past times. Support for immigration is also a common stance among opponents of cultural conservatism, who argue that it enriches society by contributing diverse new ideas. In some cases the art, music, food, or clothing of the immigrants are adopted by the dominant culture.

== By country ==

===Australia===
In 2006, the Australian Government proposed to introduce a compulsory citizenship test which would assess English skills and knowledge of Australian values. This sparked a debate over cultural conservatism in Australia. Andrew Robb told a conference that some Australians worried that interest groups had transformed multiculturalism into a philosophy that put &quot;allegiances to original culture ahead of national loyalty, a philosophy which fosters separate development, a federation of ethnic cultures, not one community.&quot;

The One Nation Party is a conservative political party that opposes multiculturalism, calling it &quot;a threat to the very basis of the Australian culture, identity and shared values.&quot;

===Canada===

Unlike the United States, Canada has always been a culturally divided country, though to varying degrees. Since the premiership of Pierre Trudeau, Canadian identity has been viewed as a cultural mosaic. Trudeau Sr. once stated that there is &quot;no such thing as a model or ideal Canadian,&quot; and that to desire one is a &quot;disastrous&quot; pursuit. His son Justin Trudeau, likewise Prime Minister, has continued to spread this spirit in declaring Canada &quot;the first post-national state&quot; due to its lack of a core identity and mainstream. The fifth wave of immigration to Canada which followed Trudeau Sr.&#x27;s premiership and continues to this day is the largest manifestation of this change. For example, the city of Richmond, British Columbia is majority Chinese, and nearly half of Torontonians are foreign-born, the city which now bears the motto &quot;Diversity Our Strength.&quot; Canadian cultural conservatism as a reaction to the multiculturalism of Pierre Trudeau (and subsequently of Brian Mulroney) reached its peak with the Reform Party and waned over time. Its decline has been marked by the electoral failure of the People&#x27;s Party of Canada, which formed partly as a response to the Conservative Party&#x27;s perceived weakness on the issue.

====Quebec====

Quebec is unique in Canada for its cultural conservatism. Though not a socially conservative province, nor religiously conservative (not since the aftermath of the &quot;Grande Noirceur&quot;), Quebecois culture has always maintained a certain suspicion and reluctance towards unity with the rest of Canada. Language protectionism (reflected in laws such as Bill 101) is a central concern of Quebec cultural conservatives. Quebec has held two referendums on separation and has never ratified the Constitution Act of 1982. The Bloc Québécois formed in reaction to the Mulroney premiership (like the Reform Party) to advocate for Quebecois interests in the federal parliament. It once held the office of Official Opposition, which was followed by a decline, but the party has seen a surge in popularity as of late, currently holding 32 of Quebec&#x27;s 78 seats in the House of Commons.

===China===
Central to the ideas of the Cultural Revolution was the elimination of the Four Olds, which were elements of Chinese culture that at the time were seen to oppose the goals of Communism in China. However, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) at the time protected some of the most important Chinese historical monuments, including some archaeological discoveries such as the Terracotta Army. CCP general secretary Xi Jinping has overseen a revival in the popularity of historical Chinese cultural figures such as Confucius. He has placed more emphasis on the value of Chinese culture than his predecessors and has included it among his &quot;comprehensive&quot; political goals. Preservation of traditional culture is a major concern of modern Chinese conservatism.

===Germany===
In Germany, parallel societies established by some immigrant communities have been criticized by cultural conservatives, giving rise to the concept of the Leitkultur. Conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel of the Christian Democratic Union described attempts to build a multicultural German society to have &quot;failed, utterly failed&quot;. Many Germans have expressed alarm over the large number of Muslim immigrants in their country, many of whom have failed to integrate into German society.

===Italy===
Italy is a very culturally conservative society. Recent surveys show that the vast majority of Italians want fewer immigrants to be allowed into the country, while few want to keep the current level or increase immigration.

===Japan===
Japan has been a culturally conservative society. Being monocultural, it has traditionally refused to recognize ethnic differences in Japan.

===Netherlands===
Paul Cliteur attacked multiculturalism, political correctness, cultural relativism, and non-Western cultural values. He argued that cultural relativism would lead to acceptance of outdated practices brought to the Western World by immigrants such as sexism, homophobia, and antisemitism.

Paul Scheffer believes that cultural conservatism and integration are necessary for a society, but the presence of immigrants undermines this. He cites failure to assimilate, de facto segregation, unemployment, crime, and Muslim opposition to secularism as the main problems resulting from immigration.

===Russia===
In Russia, Russian culture has been defended by cultural conservatives on the grounds that the destruction of traditional values is undemocratic.

===United Kingdom===
In the 20th century, immigration to the United Kingdom gave rise to multicultural policies. However, ever since the beginning of the 21st century, the UK government has moved towards cultural conservatism and the assimilation of minority communities. Opposition has grown to multicultural government policies, with some viewing it as a costly failure. After the 7 July 2005 London bombings, Conservative David Davis called such policies &quot;outdated&quot;.

Ed West argues that the British establishment had blindly embraced multiculturalism without proper consideration of the downsides of ethnic diversity. According to cultural conservatives, while minority cultures are allowed to remain distinct, traditional British culture is abhorred for being exclusive and adapts to accommodate minorities, often without the consent of the local population.

===United States===

A prominent criticism by cultural conservatives in the United States is that multiculturalism undermines national unity, hinders social integration, and leads to the fragmentation of society. Samuel P. Huntington described multiculturalism as an anti-Western ideology that attacked the United States&#x27; inclusion in Western civilization, denied the existence of a common American culture, and promoted ethnic identities over national ones.

Discussions to do with the conservation of American culture often involve definitional disputes. Some consider the United States as a nation of immigrants or &quot;melting pot,&quot; others (such as David Hackett Fischer) argue that British immigrant cultures are responsible for the development of modern American culture and values. American cultural conservatives often claim that the culture is at risk due primarily to demographic change from immigration, as well as the influence of academia, which has produced increasingly left-wing alumni over time. Dinesh D&#x27;Souza argues that multiculturalism in American universities undermines the moral universalism that education once stood for. In particular, he criticized the growth of ethnic studies programs.

<text>CISM-FM is the official campus radio station of the Université de Montréal. It is run by student volunteers and can be heard in Montreal and its outlying regions at 89.3 FM or by Internet users around the world through online streaming. CISM broadcasts in French.

As early as 1970, Université de Montréal students developed the idea of a French college radio station. In 1980, a requested feasibility study gave place to recommendations for a potential radio broadcasting school. At noon on October 7, 1985, CISM broadcast its first radio show over the university&#x27;s campus. In July 1990, CISM gained its FM broadcast permit from the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). Then, on March 14, 1991, CISM&#x27;s broadcasting antenna (located atop Mount Royal) was boosted to 10,000 watts. With a broadcasting radius of 70 km (40 miles), CISM is now the world&#x27;s largest French-language college radio station.

The station also broadcasts a Tamil language radio format on a subsidiary communications multiplex operation frequency, branded as International Tamil Radio (ITR-FM). ITR-FM has recently been granted approval for a 50-watt station on FM 102.9 in the Ahuntsic neighbourhood.

<doc id="1007171" wikidata="Q762277" url="?curid=1007171" title="Nightlight">
<text>A nightlight is a small light fixture, usually electrical, placed for comfort or convenience in dark areas or areas that may become dark at certain times, such as at night or during an emergency. Small long-burning candles serving a similar function are referred to as &quot;tealights&quot;.

== Uses and cultures ==
People usually use nightlights for the sense of security which having a light on provides, or to relieve fear of the dark, especially in young children. Nightlights are also useful to the general public by revealing the general layout of a room without requiring a major light to be switched on, for avoiding tripping over stairs, obstacles, or pets, or to mark an emergency exit. Exit signs often use tritium radioluminescence. Homeowners usually place nightlights in bathrooms, kitchens and hallways to avoid turning on the main light fixture, especially late at night, and causing their eyes to adjust to the brighter light.

Some frequent travelers carry small nightlights for temporary installation in their guestroom and bathroom, to avoid tripping or falls in an unfamiliar nighttime environment. Gerontologists have recommended use of nightlights to help prevent falls, which can often be life-threatening to the elderly.

The low cost of nightlights has enabled a proliferation of different decorative designs, some featuring superheroes and fantastical designs, while others feature the basic simplicity of a small luminous disc.

The 1990 song &quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul&quot; by They Might Be Giants is a song sung from the perspective of a nightlight.

==Light source and variants==

Early electrical nightlights used small incandescent lamps or small neon lamps to provide light, and were much safer than small candles using an open flame. The neon versions consumed very little energy and had a long life, but had a tendency to flicker on and off (reminiscent of a candle), which some users liked and others found annoying. In the 1960s, small nightlights appeared that featured a low-power electroluminescent panel emitting soft green or blue light; similar lights are still available today.

Some nightlights include a photocell, which enables them to switch off when the ambient light is sufficiently bright. Other designs also feature a built-in passive infrared sensor to detect motion, and only switch on when somebody is passing by in the dark. With the availability of low-cost LEDs, many different variants have become available, featuring different colours, sometimes changing automatically or in a user-controllable way.

==Safety hazard==
The US Consumer Product Safety Commission, or UCPSC, reports it receives about 10 reports per year where nightlights close to flammable materials were cited as responsible for fires; they recommend the use of nightlights with LED bulbs cooler than the four or seven watt incandescent light bulbs still used in some older products.

== Potential health issues and benefits==
A University of Pennsylvania study indicated that sleeping with the light on or with a nightlight was associated with a greater incidence of nearsightedness in children. However, a later study at Ohio State University contradicted the earlier conclusion. Both studies were published in the journal &quot;Nature&quot;.

Another study has indicated that sleeping with the light on may protect the eyes of diabetics from retinopathy, a condition that can lead to blindness. However, the initial study is still inconclusive.

The optimal sleeping light condition is said by some to be total darkness. If a nightlight is used within a sleeping area, it is recommended to choose a dim reddish or amber light to minimize disruptive effects on sleep cycles. In addition, nightlights may be useful in locations other than sleeping areas, such as hallways, bathrooms, or kitchens, to allow late night trips to be made without turning on the full light, while preserving a dark sleeping environment.

<text>City Hall Park, also known as Courthouse Park, is a park in the Pioneer Square neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, United States.

The total area of the park is divided into a block bounded by 3rd Avenue on the southwest, Dilling Way on the southeast, 4th Avenue on the northeast, and the King County Courthouse on the northwest. The site was formerly a Coast Salish settlement that was damaged during the Battle of Seattle in 1856.

It took the name City Hall Park because when it was laid out in 1911, the King County Courthouse was the County-City Building, housing both Seattle and King County government. The second Seattle city hall was located on the park site and nicknamed the &quot;Katzenjammer Castle&quot; for its makeshift nature; city offices moved out of the county courthouse in 1962.

The park underwent a minor renovation in 1917 and a major $25,000 renovation during the Century 21 Exposition in 1962, during which benches, a rose garden, and red pavement were added. It had originally been earmarked for use as a staging area by crews renovating the county courthouse building, but intervention from a Parks Board members spurred new investment into &quot;downtown&#x27;s only green space&quot;. The county government had also unsuccessfully proposed the conversion of the park into a parking lot in 1945 as a part of land swap for Duwamish Head. City Hall Park, nicknamed &quot;Muscatel Meadows&quot;, had previously been used by the city&#x27;s homeless population, who remained after the renovation in 1962. Another set of renovations was proposed in the 1990s to &quot;clean up&quot; the park.

The park had a 70-person homeless encampment until it was removed by Seattle Parks and Recreation in August 2021 following a letter signed by 33 King County Superior Court judges was transmitted to the city government. The letter had been written in response to crimes that affected courthouse operations for employees and jurors. City Hall Park was subsequently fenced off for cleaning and remained closed for over a year. The King County government proposed a land swap to transfer control of the park to them in November 2021, which drew criticism from several King County Council members and advocacy groups. The county council approved the transfer and explored proposals to prevent the park from becoming an encampment again, including a courtyard with permanent fencing, a hygenie station, and monitoring from the King County Sheriff&#x27;s Office. The transfer was cancelled in October 2022 after a Seattle City Council vote against the proposal.

City Hall Park reopened to the public on June 13, 2023, following restoration of the lawn and stationing of a permanent park ranger. The full renovation project is expected to last until 2024 and cost $2.3 million. A nightly art installation by Craig Walsh named &quot;Monuments&quot; debuted at the park in September; it consists of video interviews of Coast Salish people projected onto the trees in City Hall Park.

<text>Dame Billie Antoinette Miller, DA, OCC (born 8 January 1944) is a Barbadian politician who served as Deputy Prime Minister. Miller is a member of the Barbados Labour Party (BLP).

== Early life and education ==

Billie Miller&#x27;s father, the late Frederick Edward Miller, was himself a parliamentarian of distinction, holding the Ministerial portfolios of Health and Social Services from 1956 to 1961, while her mother Mildred Miriam (&quot;née&quot; Lashley) was a nurse.

Miller was educated at Queen&#x27;s College in Barbados, King&#x27;s College, Durham University, and the Council of Legal Education in England.

== Career and politics ==

She was called to the Bar of England and Wales in 1968 and to the Bar of Barbados in 1969, becoming the island&#x27;s first woman barrister. She was a practising attorney from 1969 to 1976 and 1987–1994. She was appointed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1994 within the government of Prime Minister Owen Arthur, and was also charged with the responsibility of Leader of the House of Assembly and MP for the constituency of the City of Bridgetown. She later gave up that post during a cabinet reshuffle after the 2003 elections, in which the BLP maintained power. In 1999 she has also headed the Ministry of Foreign Trade.

Miller began her political career in 1976 when she was elected Member of Parliament for the City of Bridgetown in a by-election. A few months later, she fought and won her seat again in the General Elections. She served as Minister of Health and National Insurance from 1976 to 1981 and was the first female to sit in the Cabinet of Barbados. Re-elected to Parliament in 1981, she was appointed Minister of Education with the Culture portfolio being added in 1985.

Following the 1986 General Elections when the Barbados Labour Party lost at the polls, she was appointed to the Senate where she served as Leader of Opposition Business. She was again elected Member for the City of Bridgetown in the General Elections of 1991, and served as Deputy Leader of the Opposition from 1993 to 1994. In September 1994, when the Barbados Labour Party was returned to government, Miller was re-elected as the member for the City of Bridgetown for the fourth time.

== Roles and responsibilities ==

Very active in the civic and non-governmental arena, she has been Chairperson (the first woman) of the Executive of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, and of the Inter-American Development Bank’s Women in Development Unit; President of the International Planned Parenthood Federation/Western Hemisphere Region; Vice–President of the Inter-American Parliamentary Group on Population and Development and President of the African, Caribbean and Pacific States Council of Ministers. She was also a member of the International Planned Parenthood Federation/Central Council and the UN Population Fund’s Advisory Panel of Activities Concerning Women.

Miller served as Chairperson of the NGO Planning Committee of the International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo, in Egypt in 1994. She has also served as Secretary-Treasurer of the Barbados Bar Association; Legal Adviser to Women in Action; and as a member of the Board of Directors of Life of Barbados Ltd; the Planned Parenthood Federation of America Inc.; Inter-American Dialogue; and on the Board of Trustees Of International Commentary Service.

She was a member of both the International Federation of Women Lawyers from 1975–1976 and the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative’s Advisor Group during 1990–1992.

She was the Chairperson of the Association of Caribbean States’ Ministerial Council; President of the Board of Directors of the Inter-American Parliamentary Group on Population and Development for the Caribbean and Latin-America; Chairperson of the Inter-American Development Bank’s Advisory Council on Women in Development; and vice-chairperson of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group.

== Awards ==

Dame Billie Miller was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977.

She was appointed Grand Officer of the National Order of Benin on 23 June 2000, for her contribution to the negotiations that led to the new Partnership Agreement between Europe and the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States. She is also a member of Washington D.C.–based think tank the Inter-American Dialogue.

She is also the recipient of the Barbados Centennial Award 2000, when Miller was conferred the highest honour in Barbados; she was also made a Dame of St. Andrew (DA) of the Order of Barbados in 2003.

On 26 June 2001, she was awarded as Grand Cross of the National Order of Juan Mora Fernandez by the Government of Costa Rica.

Her recreational activities include reading, interior design and Ikebana (the Japanese art of flower arranging).

It was widely believed that Miller would eventually succeed Owen Arthur as leader of the BLP, but Mottley succeeded Arthur as BLP leader in January 2008 after the party was voted out of power.

In 2022, she was awarded the Order of the Caribbean Community, the highest awarded that can be conferred on a Caribbean national.

<doc id="1007205" wikidata="Q1971254" url="?curid=1007205" title="Sol Invictus (band)">
<text>Sol Invictus were a British neofolk band formed by Tony Wakeford in 1987. Wakeford had been the sole constant member of the group since its inception, although numerous musicians have contributed and collaborated with him under the Sol Invictus name over the years.

== History ==
Prior to forming Sol Invictus, Tony Wakeford had co-founded the band Death in June. In early 1984, Wakeford had been a supporter of the National Front (UK), and was fired from Death in June for &quot;bringing his &#x27;right-wing leanings into the group&#x27;. Subsequently, he formed Above the Ruins, a post-punk band which became controversial due to its association with right-wing politics. In 1987, Wakeford distanced himself from these views, and formed Sol Invictus, adapting the band&#x27;s name from a cult that predated Christianity. In 1990, Wakeford formed his own record label, Tursa. With distribution by World Serpent Distribution, Tursa released numerous albums by Sol Invictus, starting with &quot;Trees in Winter&quot;. After World Serpent dissolved in the 2000s, Cold Spring began distributing the band&#x27;s albums.

Due to Wakeford&#x27;s past political associations, Sol Invictus has been accused of neo-fascism. Wakeford initially denied ever having been a member of the National Front or Above the Ruins, but later admitted to having been a member of both. In 2007, Wakeford described his National Front membership as &quot;probably the worst decision of my life&quot;.

== Musical style ==
According to &quot;AllMusic&quot; biographer Paul Simpson, &quot;Sol Invictus is one of the most prolific and influential bands associated with neo-folk or apocalyptic folk&quot;. The band&#x27;s music combines acoustic guitar playing and &quot;neo-classical instrumentation&quot; with elements of industrial music. Tony Wakeford uses the phrase &quot;folk noir&quot; to describe his music. Sol Invictus&#x27; debut album, &quot;Against the Modern World&quot; (1988), displayed a post-punk sound which incorporated elements of what was later termed martial industrial. According to Peter Webb, the band&#x27;s first four albums use a &quot;very raw and basic&quot; sound consisting of acoustic guitar, electric guitar, bass guitar, keyboards and drums which &quot;evoke a premodern world that deals with a variety of subject matter from paganism, to England&#x27;s quirkiness, to anti-Americanism, and looking to the traditions of Europe.&quot; The band had considerable interest in heathen and Mithraist themes, often with an explicit antipathy to Christianity, reflecting the involvement of Wakeford and other members in neopagan groups. The band&#x27;s lyrics display a pessimistic, apathetic view towards modern society. Their later albums are marked by more personal lyrical themes, and expand their sound with cello, violin, orchestral drums, flute, and harp.

<doc id="1007212" wikidata="Q2733575" url="?curid=1007212" title="Gundagai">
<text>Gundagai is a town in New South Wales, Australia. Although a small town, Gundagai is a popular topic for writers and has become a representative icon of a typical Australian country town. Located along the Murrumbidgee River and Muniong, Honeysuckle, Kimo, Mooney Mooney, Murrumbidgee and Tumut mountain ranges, Gundagai is south-west of Sydney. Until 2016, Gundagai was the administrative centre of Gundagai Shire local government area. In the , the population of Gundagai was 2,057.

== History ==
===Indigenous===
The Gundagai area is part of the traditional lands of the Wiradjuri people, and there is considerable folklore in the area associated with Aboriginal cultural and spiritual beliefs. The floodplains of the Murrumbidgee, below the present town of Gundagai, were a frequent meeting place of the Wiradjuri. Their name for this place was &quot;Willeblumma&quot; meaning Possum Island (&quot;wille&quot; = possum, &quot;blumma&quot; = island) referring to the area of land enclosed by the Murrumbidgee River and Morleys Creek.

===British explorers and colonists===
In November 1824, Australian-born Hamilton Hume and British immigrant William Hovell passed close to the spot where Gundagai now stands, near the future site of Tumut. Hovell recorded seeing trees already marked by steel &quot;tommyhawks&quot;.

On 25 September 2011, the Right Reverend Trevor Edwards, Vicar General of the Anglican Church and Assistant Bishop of the Diocese of Canberra and Goulburn, dressed in traditional white mid-nineteenth century garb, led the commemorative church service for the 150th anniversary of the laying of the foundation stone of St John&#x27;s Anglican (formerly Church of England), Church, Gundagai. Bishop Edwards noted that following on the path of the explorers &quot;Hume and Hovell, the first Gundagai settlers found a wonderful land on which to establish a town, which was gazetted in 1838 but until 1850, relied on ministry from Yass&quot;.

A local settler named Warby is recorded as having &quot;followed Hume and Hovell&#x27;s tracks to the junction of the Murrumbidgee and Tumut Rivers&quot; and having taken &quot;up a pastoral lease of 19,200 acres ... at a rent of thirty-three pounds per annum. ... He called the property &#x27;Minghee&#x27; later called &#x27;Mingay&#x27;.&quot;

Charles Sturt travelled through the area in 1829 at the start of his voyage in search of an inland sea, then believed to exist in outback Australia. Sturt again passed through Gundagai in 1830, on the return leg of his journey, and returned in 1838 in company with the Hawdon and Bonney overlanding parties. At the time of Sturt&#x27;s 1829–1830 journey, he found several squatters in the district, all beyond the &quot;limits of location&quot;: Henry O&#x27;Brien at Jugiong, William Warby at Mingay and the Stuckey brothers, Peter and Henry at Willie Ploma (the name of which is derived from the Wiradjuri word &quot;Willeplumma&quot; used to describe the area around what is now South Gundagai) and Tumblong. Peter Stuckey at Willie Ploma is regarded as the first British pastoralist to take up land in the true Gundagai region.

In April 1835, William Adams Brodribb junior moved to New South Wales and became a partner in a cattle station at Maneroo. In 1836, he overlanded the second draft of cattle to Melbourne. On returning from Port Phillip, Brodribb relocated to what later became the site of Gundagai. In August, Brodribb petitioned for a punt over the Murrumbidgee river near his Gundagai hut and, in January 1838, Deputy Surveyor General Samuel Perry reported, in reference to Gundagai, that &quot;a better site could not have been chosen for a Town of the first class&quot;.

Lady Jane Franklin, the wife of the governor of Tasmania, Sir John Franklin, travelled through Gundagai on 27 April 1839 and noted Andrews&#x27; store and public house establishment, that had a &quot;neat verandah and shuttered hut&quot;.

Edward John Eyre, Australian explorer and later Governor of Jamaica, left Sydney in late 1838 in an effort to find a practical route to overland stock to Adelaide, and then on to open communication between Adelaide and West Australia. Eyre left the Limestone Plains near today&#x27;s Canberra with stock on 5 December 1838. On reaching the Murrumbidgee River at Gundagai, Eyre, accompanied by two aboriginal youths, Yarrie and Joey, &quot;turned down the river to the westward instead of following further south&quot; and travelled along the northern bank of the river for the better supply of water and feed available for his stock. Eyre crossed the river twice at Gundagai to &quot;avoid some ranges&quot;.

Whilst living and working at William Warby&#x27;s establishment, Caroline McAlister (wife of Thomas McAlister) gave birth to a son, John, on 21 June 1832, who may have been one of the first known children of European descent born in the Gundagai area.

The herds of John Macarthur, Throsby and Ellis, were along the Murrumbidgee by late 1831.

===Township===
The first move to establish Gundagai as a township was in 1838, when plans for the new settlement of &quot;Gundagae [sic] on the Murrumbidgee, about 54 miles beyond Yass ...&quot; were advertised for viewing at the office of the Surveyor-General in Sydney.

===Origin of name===
The name &quot;Gundagai&quot; may derive from &quot;Gundagair&quot;, an 1838 pastoral run in the name of William Hutchinson to the immediate north of current day Gundagai. The Aboriginal word &quot;gair&quot; was recorded at Yass in 1836 by the naturalist George Bennett and means &quot;bird&quot;, as in budgerigar or &quot;good bird&quot;. In that context &quot;Gundagai&quot; means &quot;place of birds&quot; but that place name may refer to the area to the north of Gundagai not to Gundagai town. The word &quot;gundagai&quot; is also said to mean &quot;cut with a hand-axe behind the knee&quot;.

===Notable residents===
In the 1830s, Horatio Wills and his family lived near Gundagai. The Wills&#x27; son, Thomas Wills who was born in the Gundagai area, is credited with co-inventing Australian Rules football and for being coach and captain to the first Australian Aboriginal cricket team.

Gundagai Aboriginal elders, Jimmy Clements and John Noble, attended the 1927 opening of the new Federal Parliament House in Canberra by the Duke of York (later George VI). Jimmy Clements, also known as King Billy, whose traditional name was Yangar, walked forward to respectfully salute the Duke and Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother), and after that the two elders were formally presented to the royal couple as prominent citizens of Australia.

===Post office===
Gundagai Post Office opened on 1 April 1843 as the township, gazetted in 1838, developed.

===Railway===
The railway reached Gundagai in 1886 as a branch line from Cootamundra on the Main Southern railway line. The branch line was later extended, reaching Tumut in 1903 and Batlow and Kunama, at the end of the Tumut and Kunama railway lines, in 1923. The line was closed after flood damage in 1984.

===Floods===
The original town gazetted as Gundagai in 1838 was situated on the right hand bank of the Murrumbidgee River floodplain at the place colloquially known as &quot;The Crossing Place&quot;. That town was hit by several large floods of the Murrumbidgee River. The Crown Commissioner for the Murrumbidgee District, Henry Bingham, praised the heroic actions of Aboriginal people at Gundagai in rescuing settlers from the 1844 flood. Bingham also requested a reward for local Aboriginal people.

Gundagai was still considered a frontier town in 1852. The Murrumbidgee flood of 25 June 1852 swept the first colonial town of Gundagai away, killing at least 78 people (perhaps 89) of the town&#x27;s population of 250 people, making it one of the worst natural disasters in colonial Australia&#x27;s history. Local Aboriginal men, Yarri, Jacky Jacky, Long Jimmy and one other played a role in saving many Gundagai people from the 1852 floodwaters, rescuing more than 40 people using bark canoes. A bronze sculpture of Yarri and Jacky Jacky with a canoe was unveiled in Gundagai in 2017. The number of people whom they saved is estimated as 68, one third of the town&#x27;s population. The historical novel &quot;Bila Yarrudhanggalangdhuray&quot; (2021) by Anita Heiss is set around the time of the flood, and depicts some of the Wiradjuri people and settlers living in Gundagai at the time, using the Wiradjuri language.

Yarri was also known as Yarree or Coonong Denamundinna, A number of stories circulate suggesting that Yarri is the same as the native of that name mentioned as being responsible for the death of John Baxter at Caiguna in Western Australia during the expedition made by Edward John Eyre in 1841. This identification would place Yarri a long way from his traditional lands. The association of the two goes back to newspaper reports at the time. Yarri is also believed to have killed a young part Aboriginal woman &#x27;Sally McLeod&#x27; near Gundagai in 1852. Warrants for Yarri/Yarree&#x27;s arrest were issued by NSW Police after Brungle Aboriginal people reported him to the police over the Sally McLeod murder.

Following an even higher flood in 1853, North Gundagai was redeveloped at its current site, above the river, on Asbestos Hill and Mount Parnassus, and at South Gundagai on the slopes of Brummies Hill, using pre-existing survey plans made by James Larmer in 1850. The town commemorated the sesquicentenary of the 1852 flood in 2002.

The flood of June 1891 left several pastoral workers and four rescuers, who set out in a boat, stranded in trees just to the south of Gundagai. Edward True dragged a light skiff several miles over hills to the rescue site and managed to save several men from drowning. True also saved a young boy from drowning in a waterhole in 1887 and was awarded a Royal Humane Society of Australasia bravery award for that rescue as well. Edward True could not swim.

In recent years the Gundagai wetlands and marshes, home to many bird species, have disappeared, largely as a result of ground compaction by cattle and Gundagai Shire Council diverting ground water into underground pipes. The wetlands were on the North Gundagai Common, adjacent to the Gundagai High School, between Bourke and West Streets to the north of Punch Street, to the west and north of the North Gundagai cemetery, and at Coolac.

Major floods also occurred in 1974 and 2012.

===Bushrangers===
As early as 1838, the Gundagai and Yass areas were being terrorised by armed bushrangers. Four men held up Robert Phillips and took a horse, the property of William Hutchinson of Murrumbidgee, who had possession of the land to the immediate north of Gundagai. On one occasion in 1843, a gang of five bushrangers, including one called &quot;Blue Cap&quot;, held up and robbed Mr Andrews, the Gundagai postmaster and innkeeper. Cushan the bushranger was known to be operating in the area in 1846, and in 1850, to the south of Gundagai near Tarcutta, two bushrangers held up the Royal Mail, stole the Albury and Melbourne mailbags and rode off with the mail coach&#x27;s horses.

In 1862, at Bethungra, to the west of Gundagai in the Gundagai Police District, the bushranger Jack-in-the-Boots was captured. A plot to rescue Jack-in-the-Boots, whose real name was Molloy, from police custody while he was being transferred from Gundagai to Yass gaol, was discovered.

In February 1862, the bushranger John Peisley was captured near Mundarlo and, by that evening, was lodged in the Gundagai gaol. Peisley was later hanged at Bathurst. In 1863, the bushrangers Stanley and Jones were arrested at Tumut after they had allegedly stolen saddles at Gundagai and hatched a plan to rob Mr Norton&#x27;s store. Stanley could not be identified. In 1864, Jones was found not guilty.

Sergeant Parry was shot and killed in 1864 by the bushranger John Gilbert in a hold-up of the mail coach near Jugiong. Gilbert was a member of Ben Hall&#x27;s gang that was active in the district in 1863–64. Patrick Gately and Patrick Lawler held up Keane&#x27;s pub at Coolac in April, 1866. Also in the 1860s, to the north of Adelong, the bushranger Hawthorne mistook a man by the name of Grant for William Williams the gold mine owner, and killed Grant. By 1869, Harry Power, early mentor of famous Australian bushranger, Ned Kelly, was committing holdups near Adelong and as icing on the cake, by 1874 the bushranger prettily known as Jerry Blossom, was entertaining the district. In 1880, bushrangers held up the Chinese Camp at Gundagai then fled on horseback towards Burra, a locality known to harbour louts and for the ferocious fires that roar through the area.

Early in 1879, some Gundagai residents feared that the Ned Kelly gang was going to pay the town a visit and while &quot;extra rifles and ammunition to defend the town&quot; were applied for and special constables were sworn in, the Kelly Gang did not make an appearance.

The North Gundagai Anglican cemetery contains the graves of two policemen shot in the district by bushrangers. Senior Constable Webb-Bowen was killed by Captain Moonlite in November 1879 in a hostage incident at McGlede&#x27;s farm. Trooper Edmund Parry, killed in an encounter with Ben Hall&#x27;s gang near Jugiong, is buried next to the grave of Senior Constable Webb-Bowen. Captain Moonlite is also buried in the North Gundagai Anglican cemetery. Captain Moonlite had asked to be buried at Gundagai near his friends James Nesbitt and Augustus Wernicke. Both had been killed in the shoot-out at McGlede&#x27;s Hut. Moonlite&#x27;s request was not granted by the authorities of the time, but his remains were exhumed from Rookwood Cemetery and reinterred at Gundagai near to the unknown location of Nesbitt&#x27;s grave in January 1995.

In the 1950s, bushrangers reappeared in the Gundagai area, jumping into the trailers of heavy transports moving along the Hume Highway and throwing contents out to nearby accomplices.

===Tent cities===
The old Gundagai Flour Mill in Sheridan Lane was also known as &quot;The Sundowners&quot;, after the swagmen, or sundowners, who camped there each night. &#x27;Sam the Sundowner&#x27;, a famous Australian swaggie and principal character in the Australian comedy drama, &quot;The Road to Gundagai&quot;, was a regular resident at the Gundagai &#x27;Sundowners&#x27; and was known for his rescues of near to drowning people from the inland rivers.

In 1901, a large camp of unemployed men and their families at South Gundagai was waiting for the proposed Gundagai rail line to begin construction. 500 of the men marched from south to north Gundagai, accompanied by the town band, to try to move commencement of the project, forward. There was a railway worker canvas town near the Gundagai Rail Station. Rail workers and their families who moved to Gundagai to work on the rail line, lived in tents in that area into the 1950s. The Chinese camp was in the area of today&#x27;s Bowls Club as were the Chinese gardens. Burials of deceased Chinese people were in the &quot;pagan ground&quot;. All mine sites, of which there were several around Gundagai such as Burra, Reno, Jackalass, Jones Creek and Coolac, had miners&#x27; camps at or near them. The hill to the north of Gundagai known as Flower Hill once had a large tent settlement that was larger than the permanent North Gundagai residential area. Likewise the Spring Flat goldfield adjacent to the North Gundagai cemetery resulted in a sizeable tent township appearing there. 

===Riverboat trade===
Several riverboats were associated with Gundagai, including the &quot;Explorer&quot;, the &quot;Gundagai&quot;, the &quot;Albury&quot;, the &quot;Nangus&quot; and the &quot;J.H.P.&quot;. Captain Francis Cadell ran the first steamer on the Murray River in 1853. In 1856 the sister steamers, the &quot;Albury&quot; and the &quot;Gundagai&quot;, were bought from Robert Napier and Sons of Scotland to Goolwa in pieces, by Captain Cadell, assembled at Goolwa then launched.

In 1855, Captain Cadell was aboard the paddlewheel steamer &quot;Gundagai&quot; for the first journey in it north of Goolwa, then in 1856 explored the Edward River system as Captain of the &quot;Gundagai&quot;. By 1865, the steamer &quot;Gundagai&quot;, under the command of Captain Cadell, was providing a transport service between Wanganui and the Waitotara in New Zealand, and getting supplies to troops, in support of the British Crown and the Crown&#x27;s involvement in the New Zealand Wars. Captain Cadell became Superintendent of Colonial Transport (water) for New Zealand. On 25 June 1866 near Patea New Zealand, the little paddlewheel steamer and expert crosser of sandbars, the &quot;Gundagai&quot; went onshore and broke in half. All hands were rescued. Her engines were installed in the &quot;Wallace&quot;, built at Dunedin, in 1868.

On 16 September 1858, the steamer &quot;Albury&quot;, under the command of Captain George Johnston with Captain Cadell on board, moored at Gundagai on the north bank of the Murrumbidgee at what was hoped to be named the &#x27;Albury Wharf&#x27;, after taking a bit over a month to ascend the Murrumbidgee from Lake Alexandrina. The &quot;Albury&quot; was the first steamer known to visit Gundagai. The steamer &quot;Albury&quot; was tied up to an old gum tree at Gundagai by Mr Norton of Gundagai who two years previously had the honour of naming the boat that set off from Gundagai to survey the Murrumbidgee under the command of Captain Robinson, the &quot;Explorer&quot;. Captain Robinson&#x27;s 1855 survey of the Murrumbidgee in the &quot;Explorer&quot; was &quot;for the purpose of ascertaining If that river presents any serious impediments to internal navigation&quot; and the incentive for that survey came from Captain Cadell.

The steamer &quot;Nangus&quot; was constructed by the engineer Mr Chapman of Sydney, at Nangus Station near Gundagai for Mr Jenkins, owner of Nangus Station, to ply the Murrumbidgee River between Gundagai and Hay and she made her maiden journey in 1865. &quot;Nangus&quot; was a 12-horsepower, 70 feet long iron vessel, with two side paddles and towing two iron barges. It sank near Wagga after hitting a snag in 1867.

The steamer &quot;J.H.P.&quot; was launched in 1866 and sank between Hay and Balranald in October 1868. &quot;It was raised but sank twice more, then was dismantled in 1879.&quot; On 20 September 1870, the &quot;J.H.P.&quot;, then owned by Edward Warby, journeyed up the Murrumbidgee from Wagga to Gundagai without incident.

=== Photographs of Gundagai ===
Between 1899 and 1900, Dr Louis Gabriel, took up photography, photographing townlife in the period up to around 1906, when his responsibilities for the new hospital took precedence. He is considered one of Australia&#x27;s best early documentary photographers, partly for his observant, astute and dispassionate approach. However, they are sometimes highly stylised by integrating his and others shadows in the image, or by making full use of the radical perspective of a wide-angle lens. The question of how and why his images are outstanding is central to the novel &#x27;Belonging&#x27; written by G McDougall. The equally interesting story of how Gabriel&#x27;s glass-plate negatives came into the National Library&#x27;s possession is found in the NLA&#x27;s &#x27;Gundagai Album&#x27;. The negatives were preserved and presented to the National Library of Australia after his death and a selection was published in 1976 as a &quot;Gundagai Album&quot;.

==Demographics==
In 1911, the total population of Gundagai Shire was 1,921. It changed little in the course of the twentieth century, being 2,308 at the time of the 1981 census and 1,998 at the 2006 census.

At the 2016 census, Gundagai recorded a population of 1,925. 85.6% were born in Australia and 90.4% spoke only English at home. The most common ancestries in Gundagai were Australian 38.6%, English 33.2%, Irish 9.8% and Scottish 4.3%. The most common responses for religion were Anglican 39.8%, Catholic 32.5% and no religion 11.8%.

== Geography ==
Gundagai is an inland town with an elevation of . Almost all of the shire is located in the South West Slopes bio-region and is part of the Riverina agricultural region. The eastern part of the shire (towards Wee Jasper) can also be considered part of the South Eastern Highlands bioregion.

North Gundagai is situated on top of significant, Jindalee Group, Cambrian period geology from which the chrysotile asbestos bearing Gundagai serpentinite originates also indicating prehistoric links to the Gondwana supercontinent.

The Shire has been extensively cleared for agriculture and more than 80% of the area is used for dryland cropping and grazing. Less than 1% of the shire is managed for conservation. There are few remaining examples of the original vegetation cover.

Gundagai shire is primarily rural, with a small population. Eighty per cent of the shire&#x27;s population live in the town of Gundagai. There are four villages in the Shire: Coolac, Tumblong, Muttama and Nangus, with populations ranging from 40 to 90 people.

===Climate===
Gundagai has a warm temperate climate typical of the South West Slopes. Under Köppen climate classification, the town has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) with characteristics of the Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;). Seasonal variation is great, especially about the maximum temperatures. Summers are hot, sunny and prone to dry periods; winters are cool and cloudy with many rain days and occasional sleet, though settling snowfalls are rare.

==Heritage listings==
Gundagai has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:

* Cootamundra–Tumut railway: Gundagai Rail Bridge over Murrumbidgee River
* Cootamundra–Tumut railway: Gundagai railway station
* Middleton Drive: Prince Alfred Bridge

== Economy ==
Other than tourism generated by bush appeal and the historic bridges, Gundagai&#x27;s economy remains driven by sheep and cattle, as well as wheat, lucerne and maize production. 

As of 2005, secondary industries in Gundagai included the Gundagai Meat Processors Plant and D J Lynch Engineering. The meatworks is the shire&#x27;s largest single employer, with over 100 employees. The latter firm has produced work for major construction projects, including building steel spans for the Olympic Stadium in Sydney.

===Gold mining===
Gold was identified by the geologist Rev. W. B. Clarke at Gundagai in 1842. A gold rush hit the area in 1858 following further discoveries of gold. Mining continued initially until 1875, with a second gold rush in 1894. Mines operated again until well into the 20th century with some mining activity still occurring in 2007. The best known historical mines were the Robinson and Rice&#x27;s Mine (Long Tunnel Mine) a few miles to the south west of Gundagai and the Prince of Wales Mine (where Herbert Hoover, the future President of the United States, was the mining engineer in about 1900) a few miles to the immediate west of Gundagai. Both mines struck the orebody in quartz reefs along serpentine/diorite contact zones with finds of gold telluride (of bismuth origin) also found.

Nangus Island in the middle of the Murrumbidgee River at Nangus is marked as one of the early goldfields and was previously named &#x27;M&#x27;Arthur Island&#x27;. It is adjacent to where the highly auriferous Adelong Creek enters the Murrumbidgee.

===Asbestos mining===
Asbestos was first mined commercially in Australia, at Gundagai. Actinolite was mined along Jones Creek just to the west of the town but there are several deposits in the immediate area. Some fibres were two feet long. Prior to 1918 this was the only source of asbestos in New South Wales. Northern Gundagai is built on a hill sometimes known as &#x27;Asbestos Hill&#x27; and excavations in the area free the asbestos into the air.

Chromite, talc, magnesite, copper and slate were also mined at Gundagai. 

== Notable places ==

=== Gundagai Bakery ===
Gundagai Bakery is the oldest bakery in Australia, opening in 1864.

=== Rusconi&#x27;s marble masterpiece ===
Local monumental mason Frank Rusconi, carved a miniature Baroque Italian palace from 20,948 pieces of marble collected from around New South Wales. The work is 1.2 metres high and, commencing in 1910, took 28 years to complete. It can be seen in the Gundagai tourist office.

Rusconi sculpted the base for the &quot;Dog on the Tuckerbox&quot; monument, and created the model of the dog, which was cast at Oliver&#x27;s Foundry in Sydney.

=== Niagara Café ===
The Niagara Café opened in 1938 and was a notable stop on the Hume Highway. The cafe makes much of a brief visit by then Prime Minister, John Curtin, in 1942, with a display in the window of the cafe of the crockery used by Curtin and Curtin&#x27;s link to the cafe. Niagara Café was established by a Kytherian Greek, Strati Notara, and was the oldest continuously Greek-run cafe in Australia. In August 2019, the cafe closed and was put up for sale; it was subsequently restored by its new owners and reopened in June 2022.

=== Heritage listed items ===
A number of places in Gundagai are on the New South Wales state heritage register and the Register of the National Estate.
*Gundagai rail bridge over Murrumbidgee River
*Gundagai Railway Station and yard group
*Gundagai Courthouse
*Gundagai District Hospital
*Murrumbidgee River Underbridge, Gundagai
*Gundagai Rail Bridge Approaches
*Old Gundagai Town Site
*Prince Alfred Bridge
===River crossings===
Gundagai is located at a crossing place of the Murrumbidgee River. There were several places at Gundagai that travellers could and did cross the river. The route across the Murrumbidgee at Gundagai eventually became the Great South Road.

The &quot;Main Roads Management Act&quot; of June 1858 declared the Great Southern Road, from near Sydney through Goulburn and Gundagai to Albury, as one of the three main roads in the colony. However, its southern reaches were described as only a &#x27;scarcely formed bullock track&#x27; as late as 1858. The road was improved in the mid-1860s with some sections near Gundagai &#x27;metalled&#x27; and all creeks bridged between Adelong Creek (approximately 10 kilometres south of Gundagai) and Albury. In 1914 the road was declared a main road of New South Wales, and subsequently designated as state highway 2 and named the Hume Highway in 1928. The highway bypassed Gundagai in 1977 with the opening of the Sheahan Bridge.

====Fords and former bridges====
There are several old fords at Gundagai, including:
* the one at the western end of Hanley Street that crosses Jones Creek
* a ford on the southern continuation of Bourke Street across Jones Creek
* one at the western end of Sheridan Lane that crosses Jones Creek
* a ford at the western end of William Street that crosses Jones Creek
* the Otway Street ford across Morleys Creek
* a 1950s concrete ford that crosses Morleys Creek on the immediate western side of Yarri Bridge
* a very old ford that crosses Morleys Creek east of the Yarri Bridge
* the Warramore Ford that crosses the Murrumbidgee across to Tarrabandra between the Gundagai showground and Mingay
* the Sandy Falls ford
* the ford across Muttama Creek at the Nine Mile, Coolac, that is a well noted crossing place in local poetry, folklore and history
* the Gundagai township ford of the Murrumbidgee in line with Otway Street
* &#x27;Adelong Crossing Place&#x27;, now &#x27;Tumblong&#x27;, where there used to be a ford across Adelong Creek

There is also the Wantabadgery crossing place that these days has been replaced by the low level Mundarlo Bridge, downstream of Gundagai.

Often bridges have replaced fords but not always in exactly the same location, as bridges require high stream banks, whereas fords favour low banks. Two known old bridges on Morleys Creek no longer exist. Learys Bridge, a wooden bridge that crossed Morleys Creek in line with Byron Street, Gundagai was burned down by Gundagai Shire Council in the 1990s. Rileys Bridge that crossed Morleys Creek at the midpoint between Byron and Homer Streets was washed away in the 1851 Gundagai flood.

====Bridges====

In 1867, a wrought iron truss bridge, the Prince Alfred Bridge, was completed across the Murrumbidgee River. The bridge was designed by William Christopher Bennett and was constructed by Francis Bell and Frederick Augustus Franklin and had a total length of 314 m, including three wrought iron truss spans each of 31.4 m across the river itself, two southern approach spans of timber, and twenty-three northern approach spans of 9.14 m, also of timber, rising on a gradient of 1 in 30 from the level of the floodplain. It was the first iron truss bridge to be built in New South Wales.

Sometime before 1896, the twenty-three northern spans were replaced with a longer structure consisting of 105 timber spans varying from 4.6 m to 9.14 m long, crossing the full width of the floodplain. In that year a ramp was installed on the western side of the bridge six spans north of the three main spans, in roughly the same location as the present ramp, in order to divert traffic from the timber approach spans, presumably because of maintenance problems with these spans.

In 1896, the 105 northern approach spans were replaced by a new approach structure of seventy-six spans on a different alignment, and the southern approach was slightly lengthened, giving a total length of 922 metres, which was 12 m less than the previous length. It remained the longest bridge in New South Wales until 1932 when the Sydney Harbour Bridge was completed, . In this configuration the bridge remained in use until 1977, but extensive repair work was carried out in the early 1930s.

In 1903 a second (railway) bridge across the Murrumbdgee with a total length of 819 metres was built for the extension of the railway from Gundagai to Tumut.

In 1977, a third bridge, the Sheahan Bridge was opened, a prestressed concrete bridge as part of the Hume Highway bypass of Gundagai, to replace the Prince Alfred Bridge. It closely follows the alignment of one of the options considered in the early 1930s for a replacement bridge as an alternative to the repair of the Prince Alfred Bridge. It is long, 6 m shorter than the Sydney Harbour Bridge. It was named after Bill Sheahan, who was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for Yass from 1941 to 1950 and for Burrinjuck from 1950 to 1973 and held various ministerial portfolios. In 2010, it was duplicated to carry the southbound carriageway of the Hume Highway.

== As an iconic Australian town ==
Although a small town, Gundagai is a popular topic for writers, including writers of poems and songs, and has become the representation of the typical Australian country town. Gundagai also has a long and strong oral tradition or folklore related to both Aboriginal and European events, as the location was an important gathering place and river crossing for teamsters (&quot;bullockies&quot;), bush travellers, swagmen, shearers and drovers.

Gundagai, perhaps more than any other Australian locality, is referred to in stories, songs and poems. They include early anonymous writer Theta&#x27;s poem &quot;&#x27;Ode to the Dead of Gundagai&quot;, James Riley&#x27;s &#x27;The Gundagai Calamity&#x27;, Jack Moses&#x27;s &#x27;Nine Miles From Gundagai&#x27;, and Jack O&#x27;Hagan&#x27;s songs &#x27;Where the Dog Sits on the Tuckerbox (Five Miles from Gundagai)&#x27;, &#x27;Along The Road To Gundagai&#x27;, &#x27;Snake Gully Swagger&#x27;, and &#x27;When a Boy from Alabama Meets a Girl from Gundagai&#x27;. Gundagai also features in the song &#x27;The Grand Old Hills of Gundagai&#x27;. A 1971 educational short film, &quot;Mainly for Women&quot;, concerned a young woman who migrates from Gundagai to Sydney. A 2010 short story collection by Jeanine Leane, &quot;Purple Threads&quot;, won a major literary award, the David Unaipon Award, and was shortlisted for a Commonwealth literary award.

Other references in literature include Banjo Paterson&#x27;s &quot;The Road to Gundagai&quot;, and the traditional ballad &#x27;Flash Jack from Gundagai&#x27;. The great British folksinger A. L. Lloyd, who spent time in Australia, recorded both the shearing song &#x27;Flash Jack from Gundagai&#x27; and &#x27;The Road to Gundagai&#x27;.

Additionally, the town is mentioned in Henry Lawson&#x27;s &#x27;Scots of the Riverina,&#x27; and C. J. Dennis&#x27;s &#x27;The Traveller&#x27;. Miles Franklin&#x27;s &#x27;Brent of Bin Bin&#x27; saga is set in the area, and it includes an account of the flood of 1852.

==Culture==
===Sport===
The most popular sport in Gundagai is rugby league. The Gundagai Tigers play in the Group 9 Rugby League competition. The club plays at Anzac Park Oval, often drawing crowds up to several thousands for derbies against Tumut and Junee. 

=== Cultural events ===
The Snake Gully Cup festival is held each November featuring the Snake Gully Cup two-day racing carnival. It is one of southern New South Wales&#x27; premier race events. The idea of conducting a race called the Snake Gully Cup was originally floated in a committee meeting of the Gundagai Adelong racing club in the early 1970s. The race however did not materialise due to the lack of support from the committee of the day. The idea gained real momentum at the unveiling of the statues of Dad, Dave, Mum and Mabel at the Snake Gully Service Centre in November 1979 when Ted Tout, one of the principles of the centre mentioned the possibility of a Snake Gully Cup being run as a picnic race meeting similar to the popular Bong Bong Cup meeting. In November 1982, the Gundagai Adelong Racing Club conducted a mid-week race meeting as part of the 50th anniversary celebrations for the Dog on the Tuckerbox. The feature race at the meeting was the Snake Gully Flying Handicap, a 1000 metres. The Snake Gully Flying Handicap remained as the feature race of the club&#x27;s November meeting for the next two years. In 1984 the club applied for TAB status for the 1985 meeting when the proposal was to conduct the first Snake Gully Cup over 1400 metres. The application was unsuccessful. This was the beginning of the Snake Gully Cup in its current format. In 1990 the club once again applied for TAB status for the Cup and were successful in securing this for the 1992 Cup. From that date the Cup has only been conducted on a Friday. The second day of the meet is called &#x27;Hair of the Dog&#x27; and is a more family orientated race day.

Gundagai had a &quot;Mud Muster&quot;, put on by the Nowra Mud, Sweat and Beers people, held on 2 April 2016, sponsored by Gundagai Shire Council. The event involved digging large mud pits throughout the highly significant and documented Aboriginal ceremonial ground on the North Gundagai Common, and filling the very large and deep holes with water. Hundreds of competitors wallowed through the pits and other obstacles.

The town&#x27;s rugby league team competed in the Maher Cup.

The Turning Wave Festival, a music and cultural festival celebrating Irish and Celtic migration to Australia, was held in Gundagai up to 2011, but moved to Yass in 2012.

== Council merger ==
In 2016, Gundagai and Cootamundra shires were forced to amalgamate into the Cootamundra–Gundagai Regional Council, against the wishes of the Mayor of Gundagai, Abb McAlister, and many of the town&#x27;s businesspeople. Signs protesting against the amalgamation, sponsored by the Gundagai Council in Exile, were prominently displayed throughout Gundagai for several years. Five years on, the problems associated with the merger remained an issue. The demerger of the councils began in August 2022 and was expected to be completed in 2024, in time for the local government elections scheduled in that year.

<text>Indian classical dance, or Shastriya Nritya, is an umbrella term for different regionally-specific Indian classical dance traditions, rooted in predominantly Hindu musical theatre performance, the theory and practice of which can be traced to the Sanskrit text &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;.
The number of Indian classical dance styles ranges from six to eight to twelve, or more, depending on the source and scholar; the main organisation for Indian arts preservation, the Sangeet Natak Academy recognizes eight: &quot;Bharatanatyam&quot;, &quot;Kathak&quot;, &quot;Kuchipudi&quot;, &quot;Odissi&quot;, &quot;Kathakali&quot;, &quot;Sattriya&quot;, &quot;Manipuri&quot; and &quot;Mohiniyattam&quot;. Additionally, the Indian Ministry of Culture includes &quot;Chhau&quot; in its list, recognising nine total styles. Scholars such as Drid Williams add &quot;Chhau&quot;, &quot;Yakshagana&quot; and &quot;Bhagavata Mela&quot; to the list. Moreover, the Gaudiya Nritya is a classical dance, which has not yet been recognized by the Government of India. This classical dance form continues to carry the ancient cultural heritage of the Kingdom of Gauda.

Each dance tradition originates and comes from a different state and/or region of India; for example, Bharatanatyam is from Tamil Nadu in the south of India, Odissi is from the east coast state of Odisha, Manipuri is from the northeastern state of Manipur and Gaudiya Nritya is from the state of West Bengal. The music associated with these different dance performances consists many compositions in Hindi, Malayalam, Meitei (Manipuri), Sanskrit, Tamil, Odia, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali and many other Indian-Subcontinent languages; they represent a unity of core ideas and a diversity of styles, costumes, and expression.

== Summary ==

Indian classical dancing started around 200 BCE in India, as a joyful and celebratory activity, often in devotion to Hindu deities. Many of the performances are choreographed to retell stories of the gods and other historical accounts. All styles of Indian classical dance are vibrant, expressive, and spiritual. Dance performances usually take place at festivals, universities, various cultural events, and more. The dancers who perform these styles are usually professionals who have devoted years of study and practice in their respective style of Indian classical dance. In performances, the dancers move to the beat of the song or music that is playing; in some styles, such as Kathak, bells are worn around the ankles at times for added rhythmic effect when the feet are stomped. The dancer takes the role of the character that they are portraying in the performance, the composition being specific, and become emotionally connected with the story and the audience.

When dancers perform classical Indian dancing, they wear traditional clothes including sarees, lehengas, and kurtas. The costume for women usually consists of a long, colorful, handmade gown (worn without shoes), with an intricately embroidered pattern(s) and beading on it. For accessories, there is the use of much ornate jewelry, such as necklaces, rings, earrings, nose-rings, bracelets and anklets, sometimes with bells attached which ring each time the dancer stomps their foot in rhythm. The costume also includes a head-piece or some form of scarf, depending on the style. The women usually wear considerable amounts of facial makeup, not only to be noticeable from the audience, but to fully embody their character.

== Types of classical dances ==
The &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; is the foundational treatise for classical dances of India, and this text is attributed to the ancient scholar Bharata Muni. Its first complete compilation is dated to between 200 BCE and 200 CE, but estimates vary between 500 BCE and 500 CE. The most studied version of the Natya Shastra text consists of about 6000 verses structured into 36 chapters. The text, states Natalia Lidova, describes the theory of Tāṇḍava dance (Shiva), the theory of rasa, of bhāva, expression, gestures, acting techniques, basic steps, standing postures – all of which are part of Indian classical dances. Dance and performance arts, states this ancient text, are a form of expression of spiritual ideas, virtues, and the essence of scriptures.
While the &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; is the revered ancient text in the Hindu tradition, there are numerous other ancient and medieval Sanskrit dance-drama related texts that further discuss and expand on the classical repertoire of performance arts, such as the &quot;Abhinaya Darpana&quot;, &quot;Abhinava Bharati&quot;, &quot;Natya Darpana&quot;, &quot;Bhava Prakasa&quot; and many others. The term &quot;classical&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;Shastriya&quot;) denotes the ancient Indian Shastra-based performing arts.

The text Natya Shastra describes religious arts as a form as &quot;margi&quot;, or a &quot;spiritual traditional path&quot; that liberates the soul, while the folk entertainment is called &quot;desi&quot;, or a &quot;regional popular practice&quot;.

Indian classical dances are traditionally performed as an expressive drama-dance form of religious performance art, related to Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism, pan-Hindu Epics and the Vedic literature, or a folksy entertainment that includes story-telling from Sanskrit or regional language plays. As a religious art, they are either performed inside the sanctum of a Hindu temple, or near it. Folksy entertainment may also be performed in temple grounds or any fairground, typically in a rural setting by traveling troupes of artists; alternatively, they have been performed inside the halls of royal courts or public squares during festivals.

However, this is not the case for Kathak, Manipuri and Chhau as it has their own uniqueness. Kathak can be also performed on courtyards of mosques and had Muslim elements while Manipuri had the &quot;huyen langlon&quot; genre which focuses on combat. Like Manipuri, Chhau also had elements on combat.

== Dance forms ==
The Natya Shastra mentions four &quot;Pravrittis&quot; (traditions, genres) of ancient dance-drama in vogue when it was composed – &quot;Avanti&quot; (Ujjain, central), &quot;Dakshinatya&quot; (south), &quot;Panchali&quot; (north, west) and &quot;Odra-Magadhi&quot; (east).

Sources differ in their list of Indian classical dance forms. Encyclopædia Britannica mentions six dances. The Sangeet Natak Akademi has given recognition to eight Indian dances. The Indian government&#x27;s Ministry of Culture includes nine dance forms. Scholars such as Drid Williams and others include Yakshagana and Bhagavata Mela to the nine classical Indian dances in the Sangeet Natak Akademi list.

The classical dance forms recognised by the Sangeet Natak Akademi and the Ministry of Culture are:

== Shared aspects ==
All major classical Indian dance forms include in repertoire, three categories of performance in the &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;. These are &quot;Nritta&quot;, &quot;Nritya&quot; and &quot;Natya&quot;:

* The &quot;Nritta&quot; performance is an abstract, fast and rhythmic aspect of the dance. The viewer is presented with pure movement, wherein the emphasis is the beauty in motion, form, speed, range and pattern. This part of the repertoire has no interpretative aspect, no telling of the story. It is a technical performance, and aims to engage the senses (Prakriti) of the audience.
* The &quot;Nritya&quot; is slower and expressive aspect of the dance that attempts to communicate feelings, storyline particularly with spiritual themes in Hindu dance traditions. In a &quot;Nritya&quot;, the dance-acting expands to include silent expression of words through gestures and body motion set to musical notes. The actor articulates a legend or a spiritual message. This part of the repertoire is more than sensory enjoyment, it aims to engage the emotions and mind of the viewer.
* The &quot;Natya&quot; is a play, typically a team performance, but can be acted out by a solo performer where the dancer uses certain standardized body movements to indicate a new character in the underlying story. A &quot;Natya&quot; incorporates the elements of a &quot;Nritya&quot;.

All classical dances of India used similar symbolism and rules of gestures in &quot;abhinaya&quot; (acting). The roots of &quot;abhinaya&quot; are found in the &quot;Natyashastra&quot; text which defines drama in verse 6.10 as that which aesthetically arouses joy in the spectator, through the medium of actor&#x27;s art of communication, that helps connect and transport the individual into a super sensual inner state of being. A performance art, asserts &quot;Natyashastra&quot;, connects the artists and the audience through &quot;abhinaya&quot; (literally, &quot;carrying to the spectators&quot;), that is applying body-speech-mind and scene, wherein the actors communicate to the audience, through song and music. Drama in this ancient Sanskrit text, this is an art to engage every aspect of life, to glorify and gift a state of joyful consciousness.

The communication through symbols is in the form of expressive gestures (mudras or hastas) and pantomime set to music. The gestures and facial expressions convey the &quot;ras&quot; (sentiment, emotional taste) and &quot;bhava&quot; (mood) of the underlying story. In Hindu classical dances, the artist successfully expresses the spiritual ideas by paying attention to four aspects of a performance:
* &quot;Angika&quot; (gestures and body language),
* &quot;Vachika&quot; (song, recitation, music and rhythm),
* &quot;Aharya&quot; (stage setting, costume, make up, jewelry),
* &quot;Sattvika&quot; (artist&#x27;s mental disposition and emotional connection with the story and audience, wherein the artist&#x27;s inner and outer state resonates).
* &quot;Abhinaya&quot; draws out the &quot;bhava&quot; (mood, psychological states).

<doc id="1007215" wikidata="Q324625" url="?curid=1007215" title="King Clancy">
<text>Francis Michael &quot;King&quot; Clancy (February 25, 1902 – November 8, 1986) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player, referee, coach and executive. Clancy played 16 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Ottawa Senators and Toronto Maple Leafs. He was a member of three Stanley Cup championship teams and won All-Star honours. After he retired in 1937, he remained in hockey, becoming a coach for the Montreal Maroons. Clancy next worked for 11 seasons as a referee in the NHL. 

He joined the Toronto Maple Leafs organization and worked as a coach and team executive from that point until his death in 1986. 

In 2017 Clancy was named one of the &#x27;100 Greatest NHL Players&#x27; in history.

Clancy&#x27;s nickname &quot;King&quot; originates from his father Tom, who was the first &#x27;King Clancy&#x27; and played football with the Ottawa Rough Riders. At the time the football was not snapped as is done today, but was &#x27;heeled&#x27; back from the line. Frank&#x27;s father was very good at this and was named &#x27;King of the Heelers&#x27; or &#x27;King&#x27; for short. This nickname was eventually transferred to Frank.

==Playing career==
===Ottawa Senators===
Clancy played for junior teams in the Ottawa area and began his NHL career in his hometown playing for the Senators, where he would establish himself among the league&#x27;s top players helping the Senators to Stanley Cup wins in 1923 and 1927. Although he was one of the smallest defensemen of his era, he was tough and fast and would not back down. According to hockey broadcaster and historian Brian McFarlane, it was said that King Clancy started a thousand fights and never won one.

During a March 31, 1923, Stanley Cup game against the Edmonton Eskimos, Clancy became the first and only hockey player to play all six positions during one game in the NHL. In the third period, goaltender Clint Benedict was given a two-minute penalty. At the time, goalies served their own penalties. Not wanting to leave the net open, Clancy played goal for the two minutes Benedict was gone.

===Toronto Maple Leafs===
On October 11, 1930, coming off the most productive season of his career, with 17 goals and 40 points in 44 games with the Senators, Clancy was traded to the Maple Leafs, with Toronto manager Conn Smythe giving up $35,000 and two players in exchange for him. In his second season with the Leafs, Clancy helped his team win the Stanley Cup.

After a slow start to the 1936–37 season, Clancy announced his retirement six games into the season. He retired as the top scoring defenceman in NHL history, with 283 career points. In Clancy&#x27;s last game, he represented the Montreal Maroons at the Howie Morenz Memorial Game in 1937.

==Post-playing career==
The season after his retirement as a player, Clancy briefly coached the Montreal Maroons before beginning an 11-year stint as an NHL referee.

In 1949, the Montreal Canadiens hired Clancy to coach their American Hockey League (AHL) farm team, the Cincinnati Mohawks. He was released after two losing seasons, and rejoined the Maple Leafs organization as coach of the Leafs&#x27; AHL affiliate, the Pittsburgh Hornets. The Hornets had two outstanding seasons under Clancy, winning the Calder Cup as league champions in 1951–52, and nearly repeating the following year, before losing the cup final in seven games.

On the strength of that performance, Clancy was made head coach of the Maple Leafs for the 1953–54 season. He held the job for three years, however the team struggled, with each successive season worse than the one before it. He was then appointed assistant general manager by his friend, Conn Smythe, although his responsibilities often involved public relations at least as much as building a hockey team.

Clancy was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1958.

He remained assistant general manager-coach through the 1960s, working under Punch Imlach. When Imlach was fired in 1969, Clancy initially said he would leave with him, but was persuaded to stay with the Leafs and was made a vice-president, a decision which did not go over well with Imlach, although the two later reconciled.

After Harold Ballard took control of the Leafs during the 1971–72 season, Clancy and Ballard became inseparable friends. Former Leafs player, coach, and assistant general manager Clarence Hap Day stated Clancy was paid to do nothing by both Smythe and Ballard. During the 1971–72 season, Clancy stepped behind the Leafs&#x27; bench as acting coach for 15 games while head coach John McLellan recovered from a peptic ulcer. Clancy remained in the Leafs&#x27; front office for the rest of his life.

In 1986, he had an operation to remove his gallbladder, however infection from the gallbladder seeped into his body during the operation at which he went into septic shock. He died on November 10, 1986, at age 84 and was interred in Mount Hope Catholic Cemetery in Toronto, Ontario.

Clancy was associated with professional hockey for 65 years at the time of his death, then the longest-such tenure in NHL history, and a record since surpassed by John Bucyk. He was the last surviving member of the 1922–23 Stanley Cup championship-winning Ottawa Senators.

When the series, &quot;Lupin III&quot;, became popular, he was stuck with the name.

Katō&#x27;s younger brother, , worked as his assistant on &quot;Lupin III&quot;. For years it was widely believed that the pen name Monkey Punch referred to the two brothers working together as a creative duo, but in a 2017 interview they clarified that this idea stemmed from a mistaken magazine article, and that the name Monkey Punch should be understood to refer exclusively to the older brother Kazuhiko, who did all of the main creative work concerning the characters, story, and the main drawings. The younger brother Teruhiko explained that he was exclusively doing assistant work.

== Style ==
Monkey Punch has stated that Osamu Tezuka was the reason he wanted to become a manga artist. He acknowledged the influence &quot;Mad&quot; magazine artist Mort Drucker had on his work.

== Awards ==
He received the Inkpot Award in 1981 and a special Tokyo Anime Award in 2015.

<text>Biltmore Village, formerly Best, is a small village that is now entirely in the city limits of Asheville, North Carolina. It is adjacent to the main entrance of the Biltmore Estate, built by George W. Vanderbilt, one of the heirs to the Vanderbilt family fortune. Once known as the town of Best, George Vanderbilt created this village as a &quot;company town&quot; for the estate workers. The community was planned and designed to reflect the qualities of an English country village. The village had its own church, which is still in operation today as the Cathedral of All Souls, an Episcopal cathedral. The village also had a hospital, shops, a school, a train station, and other services available.

Biltmore Village was incorporated into the City of Asheville in the early 20th century. Biltmore Village is now a commercial district that has an eclectic collection of shops, restaurants, and other businesses. The village has been home to the main office of monthly news magazine &quot;World&quot; since 2011.

==Historic floods==
In July 1916, Biltmore Village was flooded by up to nine feet of water during the Great Flood of 1916. 
In September 2024, Biltmore Village was flooded by up to six feet of water from the Swannanoa River during Hurricane Helene.

<doc id="1007220" wikidata="Q1682616" url="?curid=1007220" title="Jane Olivor">
<text>Jane Olivor (born May 18, 1947) is an American singer. After releasing five albums from the late 1970s through the early 1980s, her stage fright, anxiety over her rapid success, and her husband&#x27;s illness and death caused her to take a 10-year hiatus. She released five more albums from 1995 through 2004. Since 2009, she has been retired from the public eye.

==Early career==
Olivor was born as Linda Cohen in Brooklyn, New York and reportedly grew up with a background in folk music, although her particular influences, she has said, were Johnny Mathis and Gene Pitney; the latter appeared on her 2000 album, &quot;Love Decides&quot;.

In her early days as a performer, Olivor played such venues as Brothers &amp; Sisters and The Ballroom. She became known, notably among the gay community, for her interpretations of songs such as &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot; from the Broadway musical &quot;South Pacific&quot; and &quot;Come Softly to Me&quot;, by The Fleetwoods. Early in her career she performed on several occasions as a guest artist on the BBC &quot;jazz ship&quot;, the &quot;SS Rotterdam&quot;, sailing out of New York.

Credited as &quot;Janie Olivor, stage performer&quot;, an early performance is captured in the 1975 film &quot;Saturday Night at the Baths&quot;, an independent film shot at the Continental Baths where, among others, Bette Midler got her start. In the film, historically important for its footage both of the bathhouse and of Olivor herself, Olivor sings an early version of &quot;Pretty Girl&quot;. Written by Olivor with Kathy Wakefield, &quot;Pretty Girl&quot; later appeared on Olivor&#x27;s &quot;In Concert&quot; and &quot;Safe Return&quot; albums.

==Albums 1976–1982==
Olivor also eased her way into the burgeoning New York City cabaret scene of the early 1970s. She appeared at Reno Sweeney (cabaret), owned and operated by Lewis Friedman and Eliot Hubbard, which Vito Russo described as &quot;the center of the universe during the now-legendary cabaret revival of the early 1970s&quot;. Working steadily in the New York City cabaret scene, Olivor became noticeable enough for the Columbia Records label and the William Morris Agency to sign her. Her debut album, &quot;First Night&quot;, released in 1976, was named &quot;Stereo Review&quot;″s Album of the Year.

In September 1977, her second album, &quot;Chasing Rainbows&quot;, was released to coincide with Olivor&#x27;s debut at Carnegie Hall. The first pressing of the album contained a one-sided insert 45 RPM single of &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot;, re-recorded by Olivor and produced by Charles Calello. &quot;Chasing Rainbows&quot; was produced by Tom Catalano, the longtime producer of many of Neil Diamond&#x27;s hit singles and albums; Diamond was another influence and favorite of Olivor&#x27;s. This album reached the Top 100 bestsellers, remaining in the charts for three months, and peaked at number 87 on the Billboard charts.

In 1978, Olivor released the album &quot;Stay the Night&quot;, with a title track, &quot;Stay the Night&quot; by composer Susan Casazza (previously called Maxie Green) and lyricist Norman Dolph. Olivor&#x27;s slowed-down version from this album of The Chiffons&#x27; &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot;, with its sinewy saxophone and multi-tracked Olivor vocals, became the biggest-selling single of her career and charted into Billboard&#x27;s Top 100, peaking at number 77.

In between &quot;Stay the Night&quot; and the release of &quot;The Best Side of Goodbye&quot;, Olivor found herself busy with concerts and also toured as a special guest of Johnny Mathis. Their duet, &quot;The Last Time I Felt Like This&quot;, was the theme for the 1978 film &quot;Same Time, Next Year&quot;. The song, with music by Marvin Hamlisch and lyrics by Alan Bergman and Marilyn Bergman, was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award.

The 51st Academy Awards ceremony in April 1979 marked the first time that all five of the nominated songs were performed by the artists who recorded them for the films themselves; Olivor and Mathis performed their &quot;The Last Time I Felt Like This&quot; duet live at the televised event. Olivor continued to headline at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles, Carnegie Hall in New York, and other venues. Her fourth album, &quot;The Best Side of Goodbye&quot;, produced by Louie Shelton, Michael Masser, and Jason Darrow, was released in 1980 and climbed to number 58 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. Columbia released the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Go of Me&quot; as the album&#x27;s only single.

&quot;Jane Olivor in Concert&quot;, her first live album, was recorded in December 1981 at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, and released in 1982. It included &quot;Race to the End&quot;, a vocal version of Vangelis&#x27;s instrumental theme from the film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, and again &quot;Stay the Night&quot;, as its singles.

==Performing hiatus==
In 1983, her own stage fright, nervousness at the sudden onrush of fame, and numerous unfavorable experiences with the music industry led Olivor to schedule a six-month hiatus from both performing and the heavy pressures of her too-fast fame. That hiatus stretched to a ten-year break from recording when, in addition to her other challenges, her husband was diagnosed with prostate cancer six months after they married. Olivor put her career on hold to care for him until his death in 1986. In the meantime, she had disputes with Columbia Records over money.

==Return to performing and recording==
After having sought and received treatment for depression in 1989, Olivor returned to performing in 1990 and discovered that her fan base had remained loyal to her throughout her absence. 

In 1991, she sang &quot;The Last Time I Felt Like This&quot; with Johnny Mathis on the &quot;Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, in support of the Columbia release &quot;Better Together&quot;, a compilation album featuring Johnny&#x27;s most memorable duets. Gradually, she became more active, and in 2000 her first album in eighteen years, &quot;Love Decides&quot;, featuring Gene Pitney singing harmony on a remake of &quot;Half Heaven, Half Heartache&quot;, was released, followed in 2001 by &quot;Songs of the Season&quot;.

On November 11, 2003, Olivor appeared at the Berklee Performance Center at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts, where she taped &quot;Safe Return&quot;, a live album of music spanning her entire career. She had recorded her first live album, &quot;Jane Olivor in Concert&quot;, in the same venue in 1982, but except for a Christmas concert in 1999 had not performed there since. The concert was recorded as both an album and a DVD, and both were released in 2004.

In June 2004, Columbia Records released her greatest-hits collection, titled &quot;The Best of Jane Olivor&quot;. It is a compilation of her best-known songs, including the Academy Award–nominated song &quot;The Last Time I Felt Like This&quot; with Johnny Mathis. This is the first time that the duet has been issued on a Jane Olivor album.

After having toured extensively for about five years, Olivor once again took some time off. Her last concert was in December 2008.

==Charities and public services==
Jane Olivor is a staunch supporter of animal rights, and she has taken an interest in the efforts of the Marin Humane Society.

<text>Princess Tenagnework Haile Selassie, GBE (baptismal name: Fikirte Mariam; 12 January 1912 – 6 April 2003) was the eldest child of Emperor Haile Selassie and Empress Menen Asfaw.

==Early life==
Born in the city of Harar, Princess Tenagnework received her title upon her father&#x27;s succession to the imperial throne in November 1930. Princess Tenagnework was first married to &quot;Ras&quot; Desta Damtew, a member of the prominent aristocratic Addisge clan. &quot;Ras&quot; Desta and Princess Tenagnework were the parents of two sons, Amha and Iskinder Desta (later Rear Admiral), and four daughters, Princesses Aida Desta, Seble Desta, Sophia Desta and Hirut Desta. &quot;Ras&quot; Desta Damtew was appointed Governor-General, first of Kaffa and Limu, and then of Sidamo.

In 1935, following the invasion of Ethiopia by Italy, the imperial family was forced to flee into exile at Fairfield House, Bath in England. However, &quot;Ras&quot; Desta remained behind to command the imperial forces fighting in the south of the country. &quot;Ras&quot; Desta was captured and summarily executed by the fascist forces. While in exile, Princess Tenagnework gave birth to &quot;Emebet&quot; Tsige Mariam (Mary) during a brief union with &quot;Ato&quot; Abebe Retta, who later served in ambassadorial and other roles in the post-war imperial government, and would eventually become president of the Imperial Senate after their separation.

==Government career==
In 1941, with British assistance, Emperor Haile Selassie was restored to his throne, and Princess Tenagnework and her children returned to Ethiopia. Unfortunately, her elder son, Amha Desta, died shortly before the return. Princess Tenagnework would eventually marry Betwoded (later Ras) Andargachew Messai, who had formerly served as &quot;Afe-Mesfin&quot; and representative for the underage Prince Makonnen in his Duchy of Harar. They were married at the Miskea Hazunan Medhane Alem Church (&quot;Church of the Savior of the World, Consoler of the Bereaved&quot;) in September 1944. Bitwoded Andargachew was then appointed Governor-General of Begemder and Semien provinces, and the couple were based in Gondar.

The couple then served as the Vice-Roy and Vice-Rein of Eritrea, representing the Emperor there when the former Italian colony was federated to Ethiopia in 1951. Bitwoded Andargachew served in many other governmental posts. He was elevated to the title of Ras, served as Minister of the Interior, and was made an Imperial Senator and a Crown Councilor. Princess Tenagnework and Ras Andargatchew Messai were the parents of a daughter, Mentewab Andargachew, who died in childhood. After the death of her mother, Empress Menen Asfaw in 1961, Princess Tenagnework became the most visible and foremost woman at the imperial court and played an ever-increasing advisory role to the monarch.

The princess was often described as the child most like her father in temperament and character. A strong personality credited with mostly conservative views, she was widely regarded as a guardian of the institution of the monarchy. She was perceived as a leader of the traditionalist element within the nobility, which was seen as opposing constitutional and land tenure reform.

==Imprisonment==
Princess Tenagnework and the rest of the imperial family were arrested on 11 September 1974, the day before Emperor Haile Selassie was formally deposed by the Derg. After a brief time when the family were kept under house arrest at the home of the late Duke of Harar, they were then moved to the Akaki Prison, also known as &quot;Alem Bekagn&quot; which translates to &quot;I have had enough of this world&quot;. Princess Tenagnework and the other royal women were kept in the separate women&#x27;s section of the prison, and Princess Tenagnework received the distinction of being listed as &quot;Prisoner #1&quot; in all Ethiopia. On 23 November 1974, the Derg executed sixty-one former officials of the imperial government without trial. Among the many relatives, friends and associates of the Princess to die at this time, was her remaining son, Rear Admiral Iskinder (Alexander) Desta.

The Princess was allowed a final visit with her father only a few days before his death in August 1975. That same year her daughter Tsige Mariam Abebe Retta had committed suicide by slitting her throat. Her niece Princess Ijigayehu Asfaw Wossen also died in that year under imprisonment due to untreated illness. Princess Tenagnework’s husband, Ras Andargachew Messai (1902-1981), who had been outside Ethiopia when the monarchy fell, died after a long illness in London a few years later (16 August 1981).

After an imprisonment of fifteen years, the women of the imperial family were freed in 1989. A year later, the imprisoned males of the family were also released. After living in Addis Ababa quietly for a little over a year, Princess Tenagnework and a few of the other members of the imperial family were allowed to depart into exile. Princess Tenagnework travelled to London and from there joined her only surviving brother, Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen in the Virginia suburbs of Washington DC.

==Later life==
Princess Tenagnework settled in her second exile, in the Virginia suburbs of Washington D.C. to be near her only surviving sibling, Amha Selassie (Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen). The imperial family was living mostly in the Washington area and in London at the time. The death of her brother in 1997 deeply affected her, and her health began to decline. She returned permanently to Ethiopia in 1999. On 5 November 2000, Emperor Haile Selassie was reburied at Holy Trinity Cathedral with much pomp conducted by the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. The Princess attended the burial, which was refused state funeral status by the EPRDF government.
Princess Tenagnework died in Addis Ababa on 6 April 2003. On 13 April, a funeral mass for the Princess was led by Abune Paulos, Patriarch of the Ethiopian Church, and was attended by most of the other hierarchs of the Ethiopian Church. Much of the old Ethiopian nobility and many members of the general public attended. She was buried in the crypt of Holy Trinity Cathedral in Addis Ababa near the graves of her family.

<doc id="1007243" wikidata="Q1063801" url="?curid=1007243" title="Tertiary source">
<text>A tertiary source is an index or textual consolidation of already published primary and secondary sources that does not provide additional interpretations or analysis of the sources. Some tertiary sources can be used as an aid to find key (seminal) sources, key terms, general common knowledge and established mainstream science on a topic. The exact definition of &quot;tertiary&quot; varies by academic field. 

Academic research standards generally do not accept tertiary sources such as encyclopedias as citations, although survey articles are frequently cited rather than the original publication.

== Overlap with secondary sources ==
Depending on the topic of research, a scholar may use a bibliography, dictionary, or encyclopedia as either a tertiary or a secondary source. This causes some difficulty in defining many sources as either one type or the other.

In some academic disciplines, the differentiation between a secondary and tertiary source is relative.

In the United Nations International Scientific Information System (UNISIST) model, a secondary source is a bibliography, whereas a tertiary source is a synthesis of primary sources.

==Types of tertiary sources==

As tertiary sources, encyclopedias, dictionaries, some textbooks, and compendia attempt to summarize, collect, and consolidate the source materials into an overview without adding analysis and synthesis of new conclusions. 

Indexes, bibliographies, concordances, and databases are aggregates of primary and secondary sources and therefore often considered tertiary sources. They may also serve as a point of access to the full or partial text of primary and secondary sources. Almanacs, travel guides, field guides, and timelines are also examples of tertiary sources.

Wikipedia is a tertiary source.

<doc id="1007245" wikidata="Q5196751" url="?curid=1007245" title="Cutey Bunny">
<text>Cutey Bunny is a cartoon animal superheroine created by Joshua Quagmire for a humorous line of American underground comic books that first appeared through &quot;Army Surplus Komikz&quot;, which ran sporadically for five issues from 1982 to 1985. She has since appeared through various other comic titles such as &quot;Critters&quot; from Fantagraphics Books and one-shots such as &quot;Cutey Bunny&#x27;s Pearl Harbor Beach Party&quot; from Rip Off Press. As her name suggests, Cutey Bunny&#x27;s powers and concept are a pastiche of Go Nagai&#x27;s manga creation, Cutey Honey.

==Plot==
Cutey Bunny (sometimes labeled &quot;QT Bunny&quot; for short) is secretly Cpl. Kelly O&#x27;Hare, a special agent for the United States, based in Washington, D.C. and employed by an unspecified branch of the United States Armed Forces. She is dispatched on special missions, usually directly by the President, and encounters action and adventure; frequent adversaries include Vicky Feldhyser, a kinky lesbian fox who&#x27;s described as a &quot;four-ple&quot; agent (one level beyond &quot;triple&quot;) for various intelligence services, and &quot;Uncle Joe&quot;, a transparent caricature of Joseph Stalin.

==Powers==

Cutey&#x27;s powers derive from her amulet, a gift from Ra, the ancient Egyptian god of the sun (Ra is an occasional guest-star in the comic; much is made about his befuddlement with modern-day technology, such as toasters and electric coffeepots). The amulet allows Kelly to change instantly into any one of six different costumes, and gain the powers associated with each; for example, as &quot;Rocket Bunny&quot;, she can fly with the aid of rocket-powered boots, and as &quot;Samurai Bunny&quot;, she wears chainmail armor and can wield a katana to deadly effect. In the 5th and last issue of &quot;Army Surpluz&quot;, the amulet interacted with other forces (such as Wunner Bunny&#x27;s magic lasso) to transform Cutey into Dark Cutey (one of many parodies of Marvel&#x27;s Dark Phoenix) who promptly tempts her teammates with the merchandising potential of being &quot;dark&quot; like her.

==Development==
Kelly is drawn as a shapely anthropomorphic bunny, often dressed in something fairly revealing, as befits Quagmire&#x27;s sense of burlesque. Superhero Multiverse describes her as &quot;the world&#x27;s first African-American rabbit superheroine&quot;. She sometimes wears her hair in cornrows. She is very bright, athletic, friendly, and clean-cut, usually uttering no oaths stronger than &quot;Gosh-a-rootie!&quot;

Cutey Bunny should not be confused with her British counterpart and occasional co-star, Cutie Bunny, whose secret identity is Heather ap-Glendower (or &quot;-Glendowner&quot;), and who has no special powers beyond great athleticism. Cutie was introduced by Quagmire as a parody of the &quot;Earth-Two&quot; story concept once employed by DC Comics to explain the history of their Golden Age superheroes.

Cutey Bunny made an appearance in the independently produced &quot;Army Surplus Komikz, Featuring Cutey Bunny&quot; series in the early 1980s. It ran for five issues between 1982 and 1985. Issue #5 was distributed by Eclipse Comics in 1985, its logo featured on the cover. Despite blurbs for upcoming issues in &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot;, no further issues were published.

<text>The Aero L-59 Super Albatros (also known as the L-39MS Albatros) is a military jet trainer produced by the Czechoslovakian aerospace manufacturer Aero Vodochody. It was developed from the firm&#x27;s earlier and highly successful L-39 Albatros series.

Being based on the L-39, it shares numerous similarities; in comparison to its predecessor, the L-59 featured a strengthened fuselage, longer nose, a vastly updated cockpit, advanced avionics, and a more powerful Lotarev DV-2 engine. First flown on 30 September 1986, it was procured by the Czech Air Force, Egyptian Air Force, and Tunisian Air Force; a total of 80 Super Albatros of three variants have been manufactured prior to the end of production. A further development would be produced as the Aero L-159 Alca, a Westernised attack-orientated model that shared its fuselage configuration with the L-59.

In service, the L-59 has been largely used for training purposes. It has also been deployed in front-line light combat roles, such as to patrol the border between Libya and Tunisia around the height of the First Libyan Civil War. Furthermore, Tunisian Air Force L-59s also performed aerial reconnaissance and ground-attack missions against Ansar al-Sharia and al-Qaeda-linked militants in 2014.

==Development==
During the 1980s, the Czechoslovakian aerospace manufacturer Aero Vodochody was keen to further develop their successful L-39 Albatros, a trainer and light attack aircraft. It decided to produce a derivative with an improved fuselage, an elongated nose, and fitted with a more powerful Lotarev DV-2 turbofan engine capable of generating up to 21.6 kN (4,850 lbf) of thrust. The latter facilitated operations at higher weights, while the aircraft also had a higher maximum speed having risen to 872 km/h (542 mph)). The new aircraft was also furnished with more capable avionics and a vastly updated cockpit, which included a head-up display. At first, the aircraft was designed to be exclusively a trainer, but after reconsideration it was decided it would be a light attack aircraft and trainers with the designation L-39MS (Modernization Super). Some time after conducting its maiden flight on 30 September 1986, the aircraft was redesignated as the &quot;L-59&quot;. Export versions of the aircraft would also carry the L-59 designation.

During 1992, a dedicated single-seat attack variant was proposed under the project name &quot;ALCA&quot; (Advanced Light Combat Aircraft); it was successfully marketed to the Czech Air Force. Designated L-159A, the first flight of this variant was conduct on 2 August 1997. It features mostly Western avionics, with systems integration undertaken by Boeing. Furthermore, a new two-seat trainer has been flown as the L-159B Albatros II.

By 2013, Aero&#x27;s official website stated that the L-59 was no longer in production or available from the company. Services provided for the type included the provision of spare parts, service-life extensions, special repairs, overhauls, modifications and upgrades.

==Operational history==
Initial deliveries of the L-59 were made to the Czechoslovak Air Force, who briefly operated a small fleet of six L-39MS prior to the nation&#x27;s separation into the Czech Republic and Slovakia; consequently, these aircraft were divided between the Czech Air Force and the Slovak Air Force. The L-59&#x27;s most numerous operator, and its first export customer, was the Egyptian Air Force; a total of 69 L-59E aircraft would be delivered to the service. Early Egyptian operations encountered poor engine reliability; this matter let to a contract to the American aerospace firm AlliedSignal to produce an improved digital engine control system. The type had reportedly been intended for use as a lead-in-fighter trainer for the service&#x27;s General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and Dassault Mirage 2000 fleets, and were equipped to be armed with Eastern-supplied weaponry. However, the Egyptian Air Force L-59s saw little use, allegedly being placed into storage around 1999.

During the early to mid 1990s, various export opportunities were pursued by Aero Vodochody for the L-59, complimenting its continued sales efforts with the L-39 predecessor. One opportunity pursued was the Royal Australian Air Force&#x27;s lead-in fighter-trainer requirement, an effort which would ultimately be unsuccessful. There were also proposed variants, such as the L-59F, that were to be provisioned with equipment from overseas suppliers, such as avionics from the Israeli company Elbit, and adoption of the American-Taiwanese Honeywell/ITEC F124 turbofan engine in place of the Lotarev DV-2 of earlier variants.

In 1995, deliveries of L-59Ts commenced to the Tunisian Air Force, a total of 12 were delivered to the service. The type has been typically used for advanced pilot training and weapons training purposes, with a secondary focus on conducting light combat operations as well. During the First Libyan Civil War in 2011, Tunisian L-59s commonly flew armed patrol missions along the country&#x27;s border with Libya. During April 2014, a number of Tunisian L-59s performed multiple reconnaissance missions and counter-insurgency (COIN) strikes in support of major military offensives in the border region of Mount Chaambi against Ansar al-Sharia and al-Qaeda-linked militants that aimed to destabilize Tunisia&#x27;s transition to democracy. In 2022, it was speculated that Tunisia&#x27;s L-59T fleet would be rapidly replaced in the near future, the Boeing–Saab T-7 Red Hawk has been suggested as a candidate.

<doc id="1007253" wikidata="Q1072991" url="?curid=1007253" title="Chilling effect">
<text>In a legal context, a chilling effect is the inhibition or discouragement of the legitimate exercise of natural and legal rights by the threat of legal sanction. A chilling effect may be caused by legal actions such as the passing of a law, the decision of a court, or the threat of a lawsuit; any legal action that would cause people to hesitate to exercise a legitimate right (freedom of speech or otherwise) for fear of legal repercussions. When that fear is brought about by the threat of a libel lawsuit, it is called libel chill. A lawsuit initiated specifically for the purpose of creating a chilling effect may be called a strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP).

&quot;Chilling&quot; in this context normally implies an undesirable slowing. Outside the legal context in common usage; any coercion or threat of coercion (or other unpleasantries) can have a chilling effect on a group of people regarding a specific behavior, and often can be statistically measured or be plainly observed. For example, the news headline &quot;Flood insurance [price] spikes have chilling effect on some home sales,&quot; and the abstract title of a two-part survey of 160 college students involved in dating relationships: &quot;The chilling effect of aggressive potential on the expression of complaints in intimate relationships.&quot;

==Usage==

In United States and Canadian law, the term &quot;chilling effects&quot; refers to the stifling effect that vague or excessively broad laws may have on legitimate speech activity.

However, the term is also now commonly used outside American legal jargon, such as the chilling effects of high prices or of corrupt police, or of &quot;anticipated aggressive repercussions&quot; (in say, personal relationships).

A chilling effect is an effect that reduces, suppresses, discourages, delays, or otherwise retards reporting concerns of any kind.

An example of the &quot;chilling effect&quot; in Canadian case law can be found in &quot;Iorfida v. MacIntyre&quot; in which a party challenged the constitutionality of a criminal law prohibiting the publication of literature depicting illicit drug use. The court found that the law had a &quot;chilling effect&quot; on legitimate forms of expression and could stifle political debate on issues such as the legalization of marijuana. The court noted that it did not adopt the same &quot;chilling effect&quot; analysis used in American law but considered the chilling effect of the law as a part of its own analysis.
Regarding Ömer Faruk Gergerlioğlu&#x27;s case in Turkey, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said that Turkey&#x27;s mis-use of counter-terrorism measures can have a chilling effect on the enjoyment of fundamental freedoms and human rights.

==History==

In 1644 John Milton expressed the chilling effect of censorship in &quot;Areopagitica&quot;:

The term &quot;chilling effect&quot; has been in use in the United States since as early as 1950. The United States Supreme Court first refers to the &quot;chilling effect&quot; in the context of the United States Constitution in &quot;Wieman v. Updegraff&quot; in 1952.

It, however, became further used as a legal term when William J. Brennan, a justice of the United States Supreme Court, used it in a judicial decision (&quot;Lamont v. Postmaster General&quot;) which overturned a law requiring a postal patron receiving &quot;communist political propaganda&quot; to specifically authorize the delivery.

The &quot;Lamont&quot; case, however, did not center around a law that explicitly stifles free speech. The &quot;chilling effect&quot; referred to at the time was a &quot;deterrent effect&quot; on freedom of expression—even when there is no law explicitly prohibiting it. However, in general, the term &quot;chilling effect&quot; is also used in reference to laws or actions that may not explicitly prohibit legitimate speech, but rather impose undue burden on speech.

=== Chilling effects on Wikipedia users ===

Edward Snowden disclosed in 2013 that the US government&#x27;s Upstream program was collecting data on people reading Wikipedia articles. This revelation had significant impact on the self-censorship of the readers, as shown by the fact that there were substantially fewer views for articles related to terrorism and security. The court case &quot;Wikimedia Foundation v. NSA&quot; has since followed.

<doc id="1007262" wikidata="Q7653621" url="?curid=1007262" title="Swannanoa River">
<text>The Swannanoa River flows through the Swannanoa Valley of the region of Western North Carolina, and is a major tributary to the French Broad River. Its headwaters arise in Black Mountain, North Carolina; however, it also has a major tributary near its headwaters: Flat Creek, which begins on the slopes of Mount Mitchell. The Swannanoa River ends at its confluence with the French Broad, now within the grounds of the 8,000-acre Biltmore Estate in Asheville. 

The estate encompasses numerous ancient Native American sites, including an earthwork platform mound, now known as Biltmore Mound, that is located south of the Swannanoa River. Based on evidence from excavations conducted there in the early 21st century, the mound was started by indigenous people between 400 and 550CE, with the second to last stage of the mound built about 580-600CE. It was built over a Connestee Phase habitation (built during the Pisgah phase) in the Middle Woodland period. 

The historic Cherokee people occupied this area, which is part of their traditional homeland in this region. The mound has been identified as an area of feasting. The Cherokee called this site near the confluence &quot;Untokiasdiyi&quot;, meaning &quot;where they race.&quot; They used it as a meeting place and area of competitive ritual games. 

Under pressure from European-American settlers, the Cherokee ceded their land here in 1819. This site near the Swannanoa River was later abandoned and became overgrown. At one time there was plowing in the area, reducing the height of the mound, but it is distinguished by a much wider, oval-shaped base. The mound was rediscovered in 1984. It was first excavated in a more than two-year project by a team from Appalachian State University, beginning in 2000.

The river is 22 miles or 35 kilometers long, and it flows entirely within the geographical boundaries of Buncombe County. It is a valuable resource to the county, providing drinking water to the Asheville metropolitan area, and numerous recreational opportunities. 

== Flooding Events ==
In September 2004, extremely heavy rains from the remnants of Hurricane Frances and Hurricane Ivan caused the Swannanoa to flood, causing major damage to the Biltmore Village section of Asheville, and to the other communities that it flows through. In September of 2024, the river overflowed into Asheville resulting in devastating floods due to Hurricane Helene.

<text>Robert Lawson Shaw (30 April 191625 January 1999) was an American conductor most famous for his work with his namesake Chorale, with the Cleveland Orchestra and Chorus, and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus. He was known for drawing public attention to choral music through his wide-ranging influence and mentoring of younger conductors, the high standard of his recordings, his support for racial integration in his choruses, and his support for modern music, winning many awards throughout his career.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Robert Lawson Shaw was born in Red Bluff, California. His father, Rev. Shirley R. Shaw, was a minister, and his mother was a concert singer. He had four siblings, one of whom was singer Hollace Shaw. Shaw attended Eagle Rock High School in the early 1930s where he sang in the choirs directed by Howard Swan, a man who would later have a lengthy career as an internationally renowned choral director at Occidental College from 1934 through 1971, and whose career and writings on choral music were the subject of a symposium at the national conference of the American Choral Directors Association in 1987. Shaw graduated from Pomona College in the class of 1938. Shortly afterward, Shaw was hired by popular band leader Fred Waring to recruit and train a glee club that would sing with the band.

===Career===
In 1941, Shaw founded the Collegiate Chorale, a group notable in its day for its racial integration. In 1948, the group performed Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 9 with the NBC Symphony and Arturo Toscanini, who famously remarked, &quot;In Robert Shaw I have at last found the maestro I have been looking for.&quot; Shaw continued to prepare choirs for Toscanini until March 1954, when they sang in &quot;Te Deum&quot; by Verdi and the prologue to &quot;Mefistofele&quot; by Boito. Shaw&#x27;s choirs participated in the NBC broadcast performances of three Verdi operas: &quot;Aida&quot;, &quot;Falstaff&quot; and &quot;A Masked Ball&quot;, all conducted by Toscanini, with soprano Herva Nelli. They can be seen on the home videos of the telecasts of &quot;Aida&quot; (from 1949) and Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony (from April 1948), also conducted by Toscanini. As the video shows, Toscanini refused to take a bow until he went backstage and brought an apparently reluctant Shaw out to take a joint bow at the end of the Beethoven telecast. 

In 1946, he conducted the Naumburg Orchestral Concerts, in the Naumburg Bandshell, Central Park, in the summer series.

Shaw was also Charles F. Shaw&#x27;s second cousin and often vacationed at his winery in Napa Valley. He went on to found the Robert Shaw Chorale in 1948, a group which produced numerous recordings on RCA Victor up until his appointment in Atlanta. The Chorale visited 30 countries in tours sponsored by the U.S. State Department. In 1952 he was choral director for the Broadway musical, &quot;My Darlin&#x27; Aida&quot;. Shaw was named music director of the San Diego Symphony in 1953 and served in that post for four years. 

Following his San Diego tenure, Shaw joined George Szell, one of his prior teachers at Mannes School of Music in New York, to work with the Cleveland Orchestra in 1956. He served as the assistant conductor of the Cleveland Orchestra for eleven seasons until 1967. He also took over the fledgling Cleveland Orchestra Chorus (started in 1952) and fine-tuned it into one of the finest all-volunteer choral ensembles sponsored by an American symphony orchestra - an ensemble that continues to this day. While in Cleveland, Shaw was also the choral director at the First Unitarian Church of Cleveland where he led a community music program.

From 1967 to 1988 Shaw was music director and conductor of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. In 1970, he founded the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra Chorus and worked to recreate the success he had had for Cleveland in preparing them for performances and recordings with their namesake symphony orchestra.

On 30 April 1972, Shaw conducted a massed 640 voice chorus made up of auditioned university choirs from 16 different countries invited to the Third International University Choral Festival to perform at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, New York after a two-week concert tour of USA university campuses. A recording was made of the festival concert. During their tour, on the eve of the breaking of the Watergate Scandal, the choirs also performed before First Lady Pat Nixon, at the White House, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and the United Nations.

After stepping down from his Atlanta post in 1988, Shaw continued to conduct the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra as its Music Director Emeritus and Conductor Laureate, was a regular guest conductor with other orchestras including Cleveland, and taught in a series of summer festivals and week-long Carnegie Hall workshops for choral conductors and singers. He can be seen again conducting the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra &amp; Chorus in footage of the 1996 Olympic Ceremonies. He died in 1999, in New Haven, Connecticut following a stroke, aged 82.

===Influence===

During his long career, Shaw drew attention to choral music and came to be considered the &quot;dean&quot; of American choral conductors, mentoring a number of younger conductors—including Jameson Marvin, Margaret Hillis, Maurice Casey, Ken Clinton, Donald Neuen, Ann Howard Jones, and current Atlanta Symphony Orchestra Chorus and Chamber Chorus director Norman Mackenzie — and inspiring thousands of singers with whom he worked around the United States. His work set new choral standards in the United States, and many of his recordings are considered benchmarks for choral singing.

Although his formative years and much of his work occurred before the rise of mainstream interest in informed historic performance practice, his recordings, reflecting his insistence that clearly projected texts serve as the foundation for musical interpretation, do not sound dated in comparison to more modern efforts by frequently smaller forces. He created techniques and approaches still in use today.

Shaw was a champion of modern music from the beginning of his career. He commissioned a requiem for Franklin D. Roosevelt from the newly naturalized German-born composer Paul Hindemith, who responded with &quot;When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom&#x27;d&quot;, a setting of Walt Whitman&#x27;s poem commemorating the death of Abraham Lincoln. Shaw led the premiere of the work in 1946 with the Collegiate Chorale and continued to champion the work well into the last decade of his life; in 1996 he conducted a 50th anniversary performance at Yale University, where Hindemith was a professor when he wrote the work. In 1998 Yale also awarded Shaw an honorary doctorate. He was also a recipient of Yale&#x27;s Sanford Medal. Shaw also received the University of Pennsylvania Glee Club Award of Merit in honor of his vast influence on male choral music. He was a National Patron of Delta Omicron, an international professional music fraternity, and was an honorary initiate of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia (&quot;Alpha Chi&quot;, University of Tulsa, 1945).

==Recordings==
Although noted in classical repertoire, Shaw hardly limited himself to that genre. The 104 recording credits on his discography also include recordings of sea shanties, glee club songs, sacred music and spirituals, musical theater numbers, Irish folk tunes, and, most notably, Christmas albums that have remained bestsellers ever since their release. Shaw was also noted for his many collaborations 
with Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra on several operatic and choral radio broadcasts and recordings. Under Shaw, the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra made its first recordings, beginning with a 2-LP album set called &quot;Nativity&quot; in 1976, based on the annual Christmas concerts that Shaw performed in Atlanta beginning in 1970. For Telarc he recorded several digital remakes of the Christmas albums he had previously recorded for RCA Victor, including &quot;The Many Moods of Christmas&quot;. Shaw collaborated with noted choral composer and conductor Alice Parker (a former student of Shaw&#x27;s at the Juilliard School) on arrangements of folksongs, hymns, spirituals, and Christmas music that remain popular with choruses today.

Shaw recorded for a variety of labels, beginning with a single record for American Decca and numerous releases on RCA Victor during the 78 rpm era. During the 1950s and 1960s, Shaw and his Chorale made many LP&#x27;s for RCA Victor Red Seal Records. From 1977 onward, most of his recordings appeared on the Telarc label. For that company he led not only the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus but also the Robert Shaw Chamber Singers, which drew its personnel largely from the Atlanta Symphony Chamber Chorus, and the Robert Shaw Festival Singers, a group assembled for Shaw&#x27;s summer choral workshops in France. His last recording was for Telarc of Dvořák&#x27;s &quot;Stabat Mater&quot; with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, chorus, and soloists.

Shaw recorded many of the great choral-orchestral works more than once, and his performances of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;, J.S. Bach&#x27;s &quot;Mass in B minor&quot;, Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Missa Solemnis&quot;, Orff&#x27;s &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;, Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot;, and other similar masterworks remain highly regarded. In a move toward historically informed performance, Shaw&#x27;s first recording of &quot;Messiah&quot;, in 1966, used a chorus of only thirty-one singers. In 2016, Shaw&#x27;s recording of the Rachmaninoff&#x27;s All-Night Vigil (Vespers), by the Robert Shaw Festival Singers, was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress.

==March 2013 dispute over ownership of the .vg, .tc, and .gd registries==

Domain name registrars such as GoDaddy have stopped accepting new registrations for .vg, .tc and .gd domain names since March 2013. This is the result of a dispute over the ownership and control of AdamsNames Ltd. which had been the accredited registry by the IANA for those top level domains. A former partner of AdamsNames Ltd. created a new company Meridian Ltd. which claimed to be the new accredited registry.

==May 2013 freeze of the .gd zone==
The National Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (NTRC) made the decision to move the .gd zone under the management of KSRegistry, running as nicGD, as of 1 May 2013. This was to ensure the integrity of the zone and to allow it remain in control and under the responsibility of the NTRC. KSRegistry, as a result of acquiring the zone, had to resolve any discrepancies that may have occurred during the dispute and chose to freeze the zone from changes until May 21, 2013. Since then, the zone has been re-opened with new policies.

<doc id="1007298" wikidata="Q599119" url="?curid=1007298" title="Musical canine freestyle">
<text>Musical canine freestyle, also known as musical freestyle, freestyle dance, and canine freestyle, is a modern dog sport that is a mixture of obedience training, tricks, and dance that allows for creative interaction between dogs and their owners. The sport has developed into competition forms in several countries around the world.

==History==
Musical freestyle started in many places almost simultaneously around 1989, with demonstrations of the talent of heeling to music being shown in Canada, England, the United States, and the Netherlands within three years of each other. The main unifying element among the groups was an interest in more creative obedience demonstrations and dog training, a love of music, and, in many cases, inspiration from an equine sport called musical kur, which was a more creative and dynamic form of dressage.

The first official musical freestyle group, Musical Canine Sports International, was founded in British Columbia, Canada, in 1991. Soon, other groups followed in the United States and England. Each region began developing its own style, with many American groups promoting more trick-based routines and costumes. English groups focused more on heel work and on the dog, and less on costumes and design. Musical freestyle has become more common in animal talent shows and specialty acts.

==Techniques==

Teaching a dog to be able to work on both sides of the handler&#x27;s body, not just the left side as in standard obedience heeling, is the first step to doing freestyle. The trainer first breaks the routine into pieces with only two or three moves linked together, and as they progress these pieces are linked together.

There are two types of musical canine freestyle, &quot;freestyle heeling&quot; (also known as &quot;heelwork to music&quot;) and &quot;musical freestyle&quot;.

===Heelwork to music===
Heelwork to music focuses on a dog&#x27;s ability to stay in variations of the heel position while the handler moves to music. In heel work to music, the dog and trainer remain close to each other at all times. Sending the dog away or doing distance work is not part of the routine, with the dog remaining almost invisibly tethered to the trainer. Pivots, and moving diagonally, backwards, and forwards to a suitable musical theme are important to the routine. Jumping, weaving, rolling, passing through the trainer&#x27;s legs and anything else considered &quot;not heeling&quot; is not allowed.

===Musical freestyle===
Musical freestyle demands that the dog perform a variety of tricks and other obedience talents. In musical freestyle, heel work can be combined with other moves such as leg weaving, sending the dog away, moving together at a distance, and more dramatic tricks such as jumping, spinning, bowing, rolling over. Dancing in place, and other innovative actions where the dog plays off the dance moves of the trainer are encouraged. A popular finishing trick for some routines is for the dog to jump into the trainer&#x27;s arms, or over his or her back.

==Competition==
Currently, there are several organizations regulating competitive freestyle, such as Rally Freestyle Elements, the World Canine Freestyle Organization, Canine Freestyle Federation, Dogs Can Dance and the Musical Dog Sport Association in the United States, Paws 2 Dance Canine Freestyle Organization in Canada, Canine Freestyle GB in Great Britain, and Pawfect K9 Freestyle Club in Japan. In the UK, the sport is called Heelwork to Music and is an officially recognized sport of the Kennel club.

Competition rules vary from group to group, and from country to country, but most are based on a variety of technical and artistic merit points. All routines are done free of training aids or leashes, except in some beginner categories. Competition can be done as a single dog-and-handler team, as a pair of dogs and handlers, or as a full team of three or more dogs and their handlers. Generally, there is only one dog per handler for competition.

In either type of competition, the choice of music and the way the routine reflects the music is important. Routines not following the rhythm, no matter how well executed, do not score well.

&quot;Exhibition freestyle&quot; is a no-holds-barred routine designed to demonstrate the full extent of creativity and excitement that musical freestyle can offer. Though highly entertaining and representing what most people see on television or at events, it allows for moves, props, cues, and costumes that would not usually be allowed on the competition circuit.

&quot;Rally Freestyle Elements&quot; (Rally FrEE) combines the trick behaviors of Canine Musical Freestyle with the format of Rally-Obedience.

<text>The Aero L-60 Brigadýr () was a small, high-wing propeller-driven Czechoslovakian STOL utility aircraft developed for both civil and military use. A prototype, designated XL-60, with Argus As 10C engine, first flew on December 24, 1953, but it was not successful. The plane was thoroughly redesigned and the second improved prototype, with M-208B flat-six engine, flew on June 8, 1954. The aircraft&#x27;s configuration bears a strong resemblance to the Fieseler Fi 156 &quot;Storch&quot; licence-produced in Czechoslovakia during and after World War II (as K-65 Čáp), and which this aircraft was intended to replace. By the end of production in 1960, 273 had been built by Aero, including an improved version, the L-160 with an all-metal tail.

Aircraft retrofitted with a PZL-built Ivchenko AI-14R radial engine are known as the L-60S.

==Variants==
* XL-60 : Prototype.
* L-60 : Single-engined light utility transport, observation aircraft.
* L-60A : 50 production aircraft for the Czech Air Force. Also known as the K-60. Armed with MG-15 7.92 mm machine gun in a rear cab. First flew on June 24, 1955.
* L-60B : Agricultural crop spraying aircraft (300 L chemicals tank).
* L-60D : Glider tug aircraft.
* L-60E :Air ambulance aircraft.
* L-60F : Glider tug aircraft.
* L-60S : Aircraft fitted with the PZL-built 260-hp Ivchenko AI-14R radial piston engine.
* L-60SF : Fitted with the M-462RF radial piston engine.
* L-160 : Improved version with all-metal tail.

<doc id="1007311" wikidata="Q29469" url="?curid=1007311" title="Generic top-level domain">
<text>Generic top-level domains (gTLDs) are one of the categories of top-level domains (TLDs) maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for use in the Domain Name System of the Internet. A top-level domain is the last level of every fully qualified domain name. They are called generic for historical reasons; initially, they were contrasted with country-specific TLDs in RFC 920.

The core group of generic top-level domains consists of the codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, codice_4, and codice_5 domains. In addition, the domains codice_6 and codice_7 are also considered &quot;generic&quot;; however, these are designated as &quot;restricted&quot;, because registrations within them require proof of eligibility within the guidelines set for each.

Historically, the group of generic top-level domains included domains created in the early development of the domain name system, that are now sponsored by designated agencies or organizations and are restricted to specific types of registrants. Thus, domains codice_8, codice_9, codice_10, and codice_11 are now considered sponsored top-level domains, along with other themed top-level domains like codice_12. The entire group of domains that do not have a geographic or country designation (see country-code top-level domain) is still often referred to by the term &quot;generic&quot; TLDs.

The number of gTLDs as of March 2018 exceeds 1,200.

== Types ==
Overall, IANA distinguishes the following groups of top-level domains:
*infrastructure top-level domain (.arpa)
*generic top-level domains (gTLD)
*restricted generic top-level domains (grTLD)
*sponsored top-level domains (sTLD)
*country code top-level domains (ccTLD)
*internationalized top-level domains (IDNs)
**internationalized country code top-level domains (IDN ccTLD)
*testing top-level domains (tTLD)

== History ==
The initial set of generic top-level domains, defined by RFC 920 in October 1984, was a set of &quot;general purpose domains&quot;: codice_1, codice_8, codice_9, codice_11, codice_3. The codice_2 domain was added with the first implementation of these domains. The codice_19, codice_20, and codice_21 TLDs, despite their originally specified goals, are now open to use for any purpose.

In November 1988, another TLD was introduced, codice_10. This TLD was introduced in response to NATO&#x27;s request for a domain name that adequately reflected its character as an international organization. It was also originally planned to be used for some Internet infrastructure databases, such as codice_23, the IPv6 equivalent of codice_24. However, in May 2000, the Internet Architecture Board proposed to exclude infrastructure databases from the codice_25 domain. All new databases of this type would be created in codice_26 (a legacy domain from the conversion of ARPANET), and existing usage would move to codice_27 wherever feasible, which led to the use of codice_28 for IPv6 reverse lookups.

By the mid-1990s, there was discussion of the introduction of more TLDs. Jon Postel, as head of IANA, invited applications from interested parties. In early 1995, Postel created &quot;Draft Postel&quot;, an Internet draft containing the procedures to create new domain name registries and new TLDs. Draft Postel created a number of small committees to approve the new TLDs. Because of the increasing interest, a number of large organizations took over the process under the Internet Society&#x27;s umbrella. This second attempt involved setting up a temporary organization called the International Ad Hoc Committee (IAHC). On February 4, 1997, the IAHC issued a report ignoring the Draft Postel recommendations and instead recommending the introduction of seven new TLDs (codice_29, codice_30, codice_31, codice_32, codice_33, codice_34, and codice_35). However, these proposals were abandoned after the U.S. government intervened.

In September 1998, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) was created to take over the task of managing domain names. After a call for proposals (August 15, 2000) and a brief period of public consultation, ICANN announced on November 16, 2000, its selection of seven new TLDs: codice_36, codice_4, codice_38, codice_5, codice_40, codice_6, codice_7.

codice_4, codice_5, and codice_40 were activated in June 2001, codice_6 and codice_38 in January 2002, codice_7 in May 2002, and codice_36 later in 2002. codice_7 became a gTLD in May 2002, but did not become fully operational until June 2004.

ICANN added further TLDs, starting with a set of sponsored top-level domains. The application period for these was from December 15, 2003, to March 16, 2004; it resulted in ten applications. Of these, ICANN approved codice_51, codice_52, codice_12, codice_54, codice_55 and codice_56. In March 2011, codice_57 was approved (one year after an independent review found ICANN had broken its own bylaws by rejecting the application in 2007). Of the remaining applications (codice_58, codice_59 and an alternative codice_60 proposal), codice_58 was introduced in 2012.

On June 26, 2008, during the 32nd International Public ICANN Meeting in Paris, ICANN started a new process of TLD naming policy to take a &quot;significant step forward on the introduction of new generic top-level domains.&quot; This program envisioned the availability of many new or already proposed domains, as well as a new application and implementation process.
 Observers believed that the new rules could result in hundreds of new gTLDs being registered.

=== New top-level domains ===
The introduction of several generic top-level domains over the years had not stopped the demand for more gTLDs; ICANN received many proposals for the establishment of new top-level domains. Proponents argued for a variety of models, ranging from adoption of policies for unrestricted gTLDs (see above) to chartered gTLDs for specialized uses by specialized organizations.

In 2008, a new initiative foresaw a stringent application process for new domains, adhering to a restricted naming policy for &quot;open gTLDs&quot;, &quot;community-based&quot; domains, and internationalized domain names (IDNs). According to a guidebook published by ICANN, a &quot;community-based gTLD&quot; is &quot;a gTLD that is operated for the benefit of a defined community consisting of a restricted population.&quot; All other domains fall under the category &quot;open gTLD&quot;, which &quot;is one that can be used for any purpose consistent with the requirements of the application and evaluation criteria, and with the registry agreement. An open gTLD may or may not have a formal relationship with an exclusive registrant or user population. It may or may not employ eligibility or use restrictions.&quot;

The establishment of new gTLDs under this program required the management of registrar relationships, the operation of a domain registry, and demonstration of technical (as well as financial) capacity for such operations.

A fourth version of the draft applicant guidebook (DAG4) was published in May 2011. On June 20, 2011, ICANN&#x27;s board voted to end most restrictions on the creation of generic top-level domain names (gTLDs) – at which time 22 gTLDs were available. Companies and organizations would be able to choose essentially arbitrary top-level Internet domains. The use of non-Latin characters (such as Cyrillic, Arabic, Chinese, etc.) would also be allowed in gTLDs. ICANN began accepting applications for new gTLDs on January 12, 2012. A survey by registrar Melbourne IT considered entertainment and financial services brands most likely to apply for new gTLDs for their brands. The initial price to apply for a new gTLD was $185,000. ICANN expected that the first batch of new gTLDs would be operational by September 2013. ICANN expected the new rules to significantly change the face of the internet. Peter Thrush, chairman of ICANN&#x27;s board of directors, stated after the vote: &quot;Today&#x27;s decision will usher in a new internet age. We have provided a platform for the next generation of creativity and inspiration. Unless there is a good reason to restrain it, innovation should be allowed to run free.&quot;
Industry analysts predicted 500–1000 new gTLDs, mostly reflecting names of companies and products, but also cities, and generic names like &quot;bank&quot; and &quot;sport&quot;. According to Theo Hnarakis, chief executive of Melbourne IT, the decision would &quot;allow corporations to better take control of their brands. For example, &quot;apple&quot; or &quot;ipad&quot; would take customers right to those products.&quot; In agreement, Nick Wood, Managing Director of Valideus, suggested &quot;Your own gTLD demonstrates confidence and vision and may accelerate your brand and its value. An internet address at the Top Level is far better than registration at the &#x27;low rent&#x27; Second Level.&quot; However, some companies, like Pepsi, ruled out a branded gTLD.

==Popularity==
Most popular gTLDs as of 2018.

===Top TLDs===
===Top City TLDs===
* The number of new gTLD sites found for each TLD in the latest Alexa Top 1 Million list

== Terminology ==
Unrestricted generic top-level domains are those domains that are available for registration by any person or organization for any use. The prominent gTLDs in this group are codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, and codice_5. However, codice_31 was the only one of these, and the first, that was explicitly chartered as unrestricted. The others initially had a specific target audience. However, due to lack of enforcement, they acquired an unrestricted character, which was later grandfathered.

=== Sponsored sTLD ===
The term &quot;sponsored top-level domain&quot; is derived from the fact that these domains are based on theme concepts proposed by private agencies or organizations that establish and enforce rules restricting the eligibility of registrants to use the TLD. For example, the codice_36 TLD is sponsored by the Société Internationale de Télécommunications Aéronautiques, which limits registrations to members of the air-transport industry.

The new gTLD program saw the arrival of many such top-level domains, with a &quot;restricted open&quot; policy, eligible to those active in a regulated industry, such as .pharma or .bank, or in other industrial domains such as .safety

=== Geographic gTLD ===

A geographic TLD (or &quot;GeoTLD&quot;) is a generic top-level domain using the name of or invoking an association with a geographical, geopolitical, ethnic, linguistic, or cultural community. As of 2009, only two GeoTLDs existed: the sponsored domains codice_68, for the Catalan language and culture and codice_69; as of 2014 there were many more, including codice_70, codice_71, codice_72 and codice_73, but many others are being added regularly.

=== Brand gTLD ===

Brands have also applied to get their brand as a top-level domain. Specification 13 is an addendum to the registry contract that describes specific provisions to brands to run their Top Level Domain in a closed fashion. 517 applications to qualify to Spec 13 were made to ICANN, 36 requests were rejected by ICANN or withdrawn by the applicant, 4 are pending review.

In 2018, Spamhaus rated .men as the worst top-level domain in terms of spam and scamming. .men comes top with 60.6% of its 73,000 domains identified as &quot;bad&quot;, resulting in a badness index of 6.48. The company that runs .men, GRS Domains also runs the third worst registry - .loan – with 59 percent bad domains and a 6.22 index.

== Expansion of gTLDs ==
The new generic top-level domain (gTLD) application system opened on January 12, 2012. The application window was initially to close on April 12, 2012. However, ICANN&#x27;s Chief Operating Officer, Akram Atallah, stated there was a glitch in the TLD application system leaving applicants&#x27; information visible to others. The system was shut down to protect applicants&#x27; information, and measures were taken to resolve the situation.

ICANN re-opened the TLD Application System on May 21, allowing applicants to submit and review their applications until May 30, 2012.

On &quot;Reveal Day&quot; June 13, 2012, it was announced that ICANN received about 1,930 applications for new gTLDs, 751 of which were contested.

It was expected for the new gTLDs to go live in June 2013. However, as of March 2013 only non-Latin domains have gone through Initial Evaluation. The updated timeline suggested the new TLDs will go live in November 2013. On November 26, first seven new generic top-level domains, .bike, .clothing, .guru, .holdings, .plumbing, .singles, and .ventures, have entered the Sunrise period.

A lottery was held in December 2012 to determine the order in which ICANN would evaluate the 1,930 applications.

After the Application Window there was a public comment period from June 13, 2012, to September 26, 2012, in which the public could express their views on the individual new gTLD applications submitted.

Concerns were raised over Closed Generic applications in which the applicant would be the sole registrant for the TLD. In particular objections were raised by publishers over Amazon&#x27;s .book application.

Of the technology giants, Google has filed for 101 new gTLDs, Amazon comes 2nd with 76, and Microsoft has filed for 11. The more specialized domain name companies include Donuts submitting the most (307) applications and Uniregistry pursuing 54 gTLDs.

=== New gTLD launches ===

On July 15, 2013, the first four new gTLD agreements were signed in Durban, South Africa. They all consisted of Top Level Domains in non-Latin characters:
* International Domain Registry Pty. Ltd.&#x27;s شبكة, Arabic for &quot;web&quot; or &quot;network&quot;
* Core Association&#x27;s онлайн, Russian for &quot;online&quot;
* Core Association&#x27;s сайт, Russian for &quot;site&quot;
* Spring Fields, LLC&#x27;s 游戏, Chinese for &quot;game&quot;

On July 10, 2014 the 330th gTLD was delegated.
On November 9, 2014, the 400th gTLD was delegated in the root.
As of 3 May 2015, the number of new gTLDs available is 605.

The most popular gTLD has been .guru, launched in February 2014 and reached 50,000 domains in April 2014, briefly surpassed by .club between June 2 and June 9, 2014, with around 55,000 domains; .club was then surpassed by .xyz, which had more than 300,000 domains after one and a half months of existence. The growth of .xyz has been concentrated on one registrar due to a promotion they ran. Recently, SBI bank has started using gTLD as &quot;Bank.SBI&quot; on February 20, 2017.

=== Criticism ===
Following the vote to expand gTLDs, many trade associations and large companies, led by the Association of National Advertisers, formed the Coalition for Responsible Internet Domain Oversight. The coalition opposes the expansion of gTLDs, citing &quot;its deeply flawed justification, excessive cost and harm to brand owners.&quot; In a statement to the US Congress on December 9, 2011, National Restaurant Association vice president Scott DeFife stated, &quot;Even beyond the financial toll the gTLD program will exact on millions of U.S. businesses, the Association believes that ICANN&#x27;s program will confuse consumers by spreading Internet searches across hundreds or even thousands of new top-level domains.&quot;

Another opponent is Esther Dyson, the founding chairwoman of ICANN, who wrote that the expansion &quot;will create jobs [for lawyers, marketers and others] but little extra value.&quot;

<text>A (headband, &quot;helmet-scarf&quot;) is a type of Japanese headband, usually made of red or white cloth, typically featuring a design of kanji at the front.

== History ==

The origin of the &quot;hachimaki&quot; is uncertain, but the most common theory states that they originated as headbands used by samurai, worn underneath the &quot;kabuto&quot; to protect the wearer from cuts and to absorb sweat. Inspired by samurai, &quot;kamikaze&quot; pilots in World War II wore &quot;hachimaki&quot; while flying to their deaths.

In modern Japan, &quot;hachimaki&quot; are often emblazoned with slogans and red circles reminiscent of the flag of Japan. They serve the function of absorbing sweat during physical activity, so they are often worn by sportspeople. &quot;Hachimaki&quot; may be worn to showcase Japanese nationalism or sporting pride. They are also associated with the &quot;Bōsōzoku&quot; subculture in Japan. In Western popular culture, &quot;hachimaki&quot; are stereotypically associated with martial artists.

<doc id="1007317" wikidata="Q381303" url="?curid=1007317" title="Aero L-159 ALCA">
<text>The Aero L-159 ALCA is a subsonic light combat aircraft and advanced trainer developed in the single-seat L-159A and two-seat L-159B versions, respectively, produced in the Czech Republic by Aero Vodochody. It was derived from the Aero L-59 Super Albatros trainer, which was in turn developed from the Aero L-39 Albatros series.

Development of the L-159 started in 1993 as an initiative to replace various Soviet-era fighter aircraft with a modern Czech-built equivalent; it was decided against pursuing a clean-sheet design to avoid excessive costs. Development was supported by the Czech government, which ordered 72 L-159A single-seat aircraft for roughly 50 billion CZK to equip the Czech Air Force. In 1998, the Boeing Company became a strategic partner in both the project and Aero Vodochody itself. On 4 August 1997, the L-159 performed its maiden flight; on 10 April 2000, the first production aircraft was delivered to the Czech Air Force. Further development of the type proceeded, particularly of the twin-seat L-159 models.

In 2003, the Czech fleet of 72 L-159A aircraft was reduced to 24 due to budget constraints. Following several years of storage, the Czech government has re-sold most of the redundant aircraft to both military and civilian operators, namely the Iraqi Air Force and Draken International. The L-159 has seen active combat use by the Iraqi Air Force against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) insurgents in the country. In Draken&#x27;s service, the L-159 (colloquially known as &quot;Honey Badger&quot;) has been employed as an aggressor aircraft for pilot training. Since 2007, six L-159A aircraft have been rebuilt into T1 trainer derivatives. During 2017, Aero Vodochody formally restarted production of the type, and unveiled a newly built L-159T1 for the Iraqi Air Force; furthermore, the Czech Air Force was in the process of acquiring L-159T2 two-seaters.

==Development==
Immediately after the 1989 Velvet Revolution, the president of Czechoslovakia Václav Havel declared a demobilisation of the Czechoslovak defence industry. Nevertheless, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Czech company Aero Vodochody continued developing the basic L-39 Albatros design with a view toward greater export. The resulting L-39MS, later designed as L-59 Super Albatros, featured a more powerful turbofan engine, advanced avionics, and has been bought in quantity by Egypt and Tunisia. In 1993, a group of Czech military experts launched a project to produce a modern domestic fighter to replace the obsolete Soviet aircraft. Since the proposed Aero L-X supersonic fighter development proved to be financially demanding (up to US$2 billion), the less costly L-159 subsonic attack aircraft, derived from the L-39 Albatros, was approved for procurement instead.

Conducted between 1994 and 1997, the technical development of the L-159 ALCA in Aero Vodochody consisted primarily of building a single L-159 two-seat prototype, based on the L-59 airframe, and utilizing western engine, avionics and weapon systems, with Rockwell Collins (eventually Boeing) as the avionics integrator. During 1995, the Czech government placed a large order for 72 L-159A single-seat aircraft at a cost around 50 billion CZK. The contract was signed on 4 July 1997. The number of aircraft to be delivered was based upon the size of the Czech Air Force at that time, taking into account the necessity to replace MiG-23BN and Su-22 fighter-bombers and Su-25 attack aircraft. Due to the cost of the project, the Czech government decided that a strategic partner, the Boeing Company, would be invited to collaborate with Aero Vodochody in the venture during May 1998.
The maiden flight of the first L-159 prototype (5831, &quot;376 white&quot;) occurred on 2 August 1997 with a two-seat version. On 18 August 1998, the single-seat L-159A prototype (5832, &quot;356 white&quot;) first flew; it was completed to Czech customer specifications. On 10 April 2000, the first delivery of the L-159A took place to the Czech Air Force. Prototype (6073) of the two-seat L-159B variant first flew on 1 June 2002.

During October 2004, the Czech government announced that Aero Vodochody was to be privatised, and Boeing decided to withdraw from involvement in both the L-159 and the overall company. During October 2006, Aero Vodochody was sold to Penta Investments. In 2009, Aero Vodochody selected &quot;V-Dot Systems&quot; (split off from Boeing) as the L-159 avionics integrator. V-Dot will replace the Honeywell multi-function displays (MFD) and upgrade the mission processors to support new functions.

On 31 March 2017, following a 13-year stoppage in L-159 production after the delivery of the final Czech Air Force example, Aero Vodochody held a ceremony to mark the resumption of manufacturing; a new-build L-159 destined for the Iraqi Air Force was present. This batch of production aircraft featured several improvements, such as the use of a wet wing and increased endurance; further enhancements were also being worked on at that time. The company reportedly negotiated with Argentina on the topic of the L-159, which reportedly may have included the establishment of an assembly line in the country.

==Design==

The L-159 ALCA is designed for the principal role of light combat aircraft (single-seat L-159A variant) or light attack jet and advanced/lead-in fighter trainer (two-seat L-159B and T variants). Design of the L-159 was derived from the L-39/59 in terms of aerodynamic configuration but a number of changes were made to improve its combat capabilities. These include strengthening of the airframe, reinforcing of the cockpit with composite and ceramic ballistic armour and enlargement of the aircraft&#x27;s nose to accommodate the radar. Compared to the L-59, the number of underwing pylons was increased from four to six, and a new hardpoint under the fuselage was added instead of a GSh-23L cannon.

The aircraft is powered by the non-afterburning Honeywell/ITEC F124-GA-100 turbofan engine with a maximum thrust of 28 kN. Almost 2,000 litres of fuel are stored in eight internal tanks (six in the fuselage, two at the wingtips) with up to four external drop tanks (two 500 L and two 350 L tanks) carried under the wings. The lightly armoured cockpit is equipped with a VS-2B ejection seat capable of catapulting the pilot at a zero flight level and zero speed. The aircraft&#x27;s avionics, based on the MIL-STD-1553 databus, include Selex Navigation and Attack Suite, Ring Laser Gyro based Inertial Navigation System (INS) and Global Positioning System (GPS). Flight data are displayed both on the FV-3000 head-up display (HUD) and two multi-function displays (MFD).

Communications are provided by a pair of Collins ARC-182 transceivers. Self-protection of the L-159 is ensured by the Sky Guardian 200 radar warning receiver (RWR) and the Vinten Vicon 78 Series 455 chaff and flare dispenser. L-159A and T2 variants are equipped with the Italian FIAR Grifo L multi-mode Doppler radar for all-weather, day and night operations. All variants of L-159 are equipped with a total of seven hardpoints (one under-fuselage and six under-wing mountings), capable of carrying external loads up to 2,340 kg. The aircraft can be equipped with a variety of weapons ranging from unguided bombs and rocket pods to air-to-ground and air-to-air guided missiles or with special devices to conduct aerial reconnaissance or electronic warfare. For example, it is capable of carrying advanced targeting pods including the AN/AAQ-28(V) LITENING.

==Operational history==

===Czech Republic===
The Czech Air Force is the primary operator of the L-159. During 1995, the Czech government ordered 72 aircraft, but after review, opted to reduce the fleet size to 24 L-159s, which received the latest avionics upgrades, while the remaining aircraft were placed into long-term storage. By 2016, the Czech Air Force had 16 L-159A and 5 L-159T1 aircraft in service. On 1 June 2016, Aero Vodochody received an order to upgrade an initial batch of 16 Czech Air Force L-159s.

===Iraq===
On 15 October 2012, it was announced that Iraq had agreed to purchase 28 L-159s from the Czech government. During early 2015, Iraq signed a deal for 14 L-159 aircraft, comprising 12 L-159As and two L-159T1s, for the Iraqi Air Force. This sale was politically controversial in the United Kingdom, as it necessitated the lifting of a long-standing ban on the export of British radar technology to Iraq. The first two Czech L-159s were delivered to Iraq on 5 November 2015. In May 2016, numerous Iraqi L-159s participated in attacks upon positions held by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) insurgents in the city of Fallujah. During October and November 2016, L-159 aircraft operated by Squadron No. 115 were deployed in the battle against ISIL forces at the Southern outskirts of Mosul.

As the threat posed by ISIS diminished in Iraq, the L-159s were placed into temporary storage around 2017 or 2018. During February 2022, it was announced that the Iraqi L159s had been brought back into active service, although they were only capable of limited operations initially. It had reportedly been used in multiple strikes against insurgents in ISIL hideouts in the Hamrin Mountains of Diyala province during late 2021. During early 2022, Iraq has been in contact with Aero Vodochody on the topic of modernising its L-159 fleet.

As of March 2023 an Iraqi L159 was photographed carrying the Turkish Aselpod reconnaissance, surveillance and targeting pod This could mean that the Iraqis have found a solution to the limited air to ground capability of the Iraqi L159s

===Spain===
In 2009, EADS-CASA of Spain exchanged with the CzAF four CASA C-295 for three L-159As, two L-159T1s and 130 million Euros. Later the two L-159T1s were returned by EADS-CASA to the Czech Republic as compensation for the C-295M not meeting the counter measures requirements of the CzAF at the time of delivery. This problem has been solved by EADS-CASA three years later and the remaining three L-159As resold by EADS-CASA to Lewis Fighter Fleet LLC.

===United States===
During 2014, it was announced that Draken International Inc., a civilian American company that cooperates with the US military for pilot training, was in the process of acquiring 21 ex-Czech Air Force L-159s. The deal made Draken International into the world&#x27;s largest private air force. Aero Vodochody handed over the first L-159 aircraft to the company on 30 September 2015. Draken International has secured contacts with both the United States Air Force and the Royal Air Force to use its L-159s as aggressor aircraft for pilot training.

A separate company, Lewis Fighter Fleet LLC, also operates three L-159As for its own purposes. These aircraft, which were formerly owned by EADS-CASA, were acquired by the firm in July 2013.

==Variants==

===Single-seat===
====L-159A====
The L-159A ALCA is a single-seat light multi-role combat aircraft designed for a variety of air-to-air, air-to-ground and reconnaissance missions. The aircraft is equipped with a multi-mode Doppler Grifo-L radar (a variant of the Grifo-F x-band multi-mode, pulse-doppler radar), for all-weather, day and night operations. It can carry a wide range of NATO standard stores including air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles and laser guided bombs. The L-159A is in operational service with the Czech and Iraqi air forces. There are two different configurations being used by the Czech Air Force – using the Honeywell 4x4 inch MFDs or the Vdot 5x6.7 inch MFDs. Avionic upgrades are designed and developed by V-Dot Systems Inc.

====L-159E====
The L-159E ALCA is the export designation of L-159A in service with Draken International.

====F/A-259====
Combat-capable variant first unveiled at the Farnborough Airshow on 16 July 2018. Developed in collaboration with Israel Aerospace Industries and powered by a Honeywell F124-GA-100 engine. The aircraft is pitched for the U.S. Air Force Light Attack/Armed Reconnaissance program.

===Two-seat===
====L-159B====
The L-159B, also known as L-159B Albatros II, is a two-seat version primarily designed for Advanced and Operational/Lead-In Fighter Training. The L-159B configuration can also be tailored to customer specific requirements and adapted to needs of basic training as well as combat missions including air-to-ground, patrol and reconnaissance missions. On 23 July 2002, the Czech military signed a letter of intent on acquisition of the first two L-159B aircraft. However, due to the budget constraints the trade did not materialize. The only prototype has been rebuilt by Aero Vodochody into L-159T2X demonstrator. The aircraft&#x27;s designation was changed on 14 December 2015.
====L-159T1====
The L-159T1 is a two-seat trainer derivative used by the Czech and Iraqi Air Force. All L-159T1s (excluding one newly built L-159T1 for the Iraqi Air Force) are modified L-159A airframes taken from storage. Unlike L-159A, they have just one MFD in each cockpit and no radar. L-159T1 S/N 6069 made its first flight on 8 March 2007 and the first batch of four aircraft was handed over to the Czech Air Force on 23 November 2007. Another two aircraft were delivered in August and December 2010, respectively. L-159T1 S/N 6069 was transferred to Aero Vodochody on 30 June 2015 as a part of the Iraqi contract which included handover of four actively used aircraft – three L-159A and one L-159T1 – to the Iraqi Air Force.

====L-159T1+====
Prototype L-159T1+ S/N 6067 (manufactured as L-159A in 2003 and converted to L-159T1 in 2007) was unveiled by Aero Vodochody in March 2017. L-159T1+ aircraft are characterized by an upgraded mission system, avionics and newly installed Grifo-L radar, offering the same combat capability as the single-seat L-159A. The T1+ modernization of 4 Czech Air Force L-159T1 is scheduled to be completed in December 2019.

====L-159T2====
The L-159T2 is a two-seat trainer with full combat capability converted from stored L-159A airframes. Compared to the L-159T1, it has a higher proportion of newly manufactured components and a Grifo-L radar installed. Instead of mirroring the instruments to the rear seat, the new two-seater will have independent instruments interchangeable with the L-159A while using the same software configuration. The Czech Air Force has ordered 3 L-159T2 aircraft scheduled to be delivered in November 2018.

===Evaluation-only operators===
* Hungarian Air Force – one L-159B leased from 2008 until 2010.
* Irish Air Corps – The L-159A was evaluated as a replacement for the six Fouga CM.170 Magisters of the Light Strike Squadron. The Czech Republic offered Ireland 3 L-39ZA for free if Ireland bought six L-159As. The Irish Government chose not to pursue the offer.

===Potential operators===
On 11 May 2023, Czech President Petr Pavel, in a radio interview, offered the L-159 to Ukraine. Subject to a decision by the Czech government, President Pavel said “It is worth considering whether we could provide Ukraine with our L-159 aircraft. As direct combat support aircraft, (the planes) could also help Ukraine significantly in the counteroffensive”. They also carry an array of western weapons such as: “AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, AIM-120 AMRAAM, AGM-65 Maverick, and GBU-12 Paveway II and GBU-16 Paveway II laser-guided bombs.” They also are a Czech aircraft, approval from other countries is not required. It is also an upgrade from the Aero L-39 Albatros that the Ukraine Air Force uses.

<text>Aliens vs. Predator (also known as Aliens versus Predator, abbreviated AVP) is a comic book series published by Dark Horse Comics between 1989 and 2020 on an intermittent basis, written and drawn by various artists. Dark Horse also publishes the &quot;Aliens&quot; and &quot;Predator&quot; lines of comics.

AVP is part of the crossover franchise originated and published by Dark Horse Comics.

According to the notes which accompany the first &quot;Aliens versus Predator&quot; graphic novel, the original idea of combining the Aliens with Predators was the result of a late 1980s brain-storming session between the comic&#x27;s creators and Dark Horse executives. &quot;AVP&quot; artist and editor Chris Warner is credited with suggesting the concept. Eventually, a film, &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot;, was made in 2004, with a sequel in 2007 (called &quot;Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem&quot;) including a hybrid of a Xenomorph and a Predator. However, the films did not follow either the settings or the stories of the original comic series.

==Original &quot;Aliens vs. Predator&quot; comic==
The first &quot;Aliens versus Predator&quot; centers on Ryushi, a recently colonized planet, and Machiko Noguchi, the Chigusa Corporation&#x27;s administrator there. The settlers on Ryushi raise cattle-like quadrupedal ungulates called for export to other solar systems, and at the time of the story are in the process of assembling a shipment of the native livestock.

Unbeknownst to the colonists, Ryushi is a traditional hunting ground of the Predators, and they are returning for their initiation rites. On board the Predator ship, the prey are prepared: an Alien queen lays eggs for delivery to Ryushi. Confounding the Predator&#x27;s safeguards, this queen manages to slip an egg containing the seed of another queen into the shipment.

On reaching Ryushi, the eggs hatch and infect . Led by a Predator elder, &quot;Broken Tusk&quot;, the Predators arrive expecting to encounter Aliens. However, they soon encounter the settlers and, after Broken Tusk is incapacitated, change their plans to hunt them instead.

Meanwhile, the infected have been loaded aboard a cargo transporter and, with a queen among their number, an Alien colony quickly takes hold. The Predator assault continues to the settler colony itself, and the surviving settlers find themselves pitched between the Aliens and Predators. Broken Tusk, now recovered due to the intervention of a human doctor, sides with Machiko, and together with the cargo ship&#x27;s crew they arrange for the transporter&#x27;s massive orbiter to crash into Ryushi and destroy the colony and the Aliens.

In the ensuing fight, Broken Tusk is mortally wounded, but, admiring the courage of his human comrade, &quot;bloods&quot; Machiko with the mark of his clan. The story concludes with Machiko the sole inhabitant of Ryushi, the surviving settlers having been evacuated from the planet. She awaits, and is rewarded with, the return of the Predators and another hunt. One of Broken Tusk&#x27;s former Predator rivals greets her and, recognizing Broken Tusk&#x27;s clan symbol, accepts Machiko into the hunt.

<text>Astaxanthin is a keto-carotenoid within a group of chemical compounds known as carotenoids or terpenes. Astaxanthin is a metabolite of zeaxanthin and canthaxanthin, containing both hydroxyl and ketone functional groups.

It is a lipid-soluble pigment with red coloring properties, which result from the extended chain of conjugated (alternating double and single) double bonds at the center of the compound. The presence of the hydroxyl functional groups and the hydrophobic hydrocarbons render the molecule amphiphilic.

Astaxanthin is produced naturally in the freshwater microalgae &quot;Haematococcus pluvialis,&quot; the yeast fungus &quot;Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous&quot; (also known as &quot;Phaffia rhodozyma&quot;) and the bacteria &quot;Paracoccus carotinifaciens.&quot; When the algae are stressed by lack of nutrients, increased salinity, or excessive sunshine, they create astaxanthin. Animals who feed on the algae, such as salmon, red trout, red sea bream, flamingos, and crustaceans (shrimp, krill, crab, lobster, and crayfish), subsequently reflect the red-orange astaxanthin pigmentation.

Astaxanthin is used as a dietary supplement for human, animal, and aquaculture consumption. Astaxanthin from algae, synthetic and bacterial sources is generally recognized as safe in the United States. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved astaxanthin as a food coloring (or color additive) for specific uses in animal and fish foods. The European Commission considers it as a food dye with E number E161j. The European Food Safety Authority has set an Acceptable Daily Intake of 0.2 mg per kg body weight, as of 2019. As a food color additive, astaxanthin and astaxanthin dimethyldisuccinate are restricted for use in Salmonid fish feed only.

== Natural sources ==


Astaxanthin is present in most red-coloured aquatic organisms. The content varies from species to species, but also from individual to individual as it is highly dependent on diet and living conditions. Astaxanthin and other chemically related asta-carotenoids have also been found in a number of lichen species of the Arctic zone.

The primary natural sources for industrial production of astaxanthin comprise the following:
* &quot;Euphausia pacifica&quot; (Pacific krill)
* &quot;Euphausia superba&quot; (Antarctic krill)
* &quot;Haematococcus pluvialis&quot; (algae)
* &quot;Pandalus borealis&quot; (Arctic shrimp)

Astaxanthin concentrations in nature are approximately:
Algae are the primary natural source of astaxanthin in the aquatic food chain. The microalgae &quot;Haematococcus pluvialis&quot; contains high levels of astaxanthin (about 3.8% of dry weight), and is the primary industrial source of natural astaxanthin.

In shellfish, astaxanthin is almost exclusively concentrated in the shells, with only low amounts in the flesh itself, and most of it only becomes visible during cooking as the pigment separates from the denatured proteins that otherwise bind it. Astaxanthin is extracted from &quot;Euphausia superba&quot; (Antarctic krill) and from shrimp processing waste.

== Biosynthesis ==

Astaxanthin biosynthesis starts with three molecules of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and one molecule of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) that are combined by IPP isomerase and converted to geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) by GGPP synthase. Two molecules of GGPP are then coupled by phytoene synthase to form phytoene. Next, phytoene desaturase creates four double bonds in the phytoene molecule to form lycopene. After desaturation, lycopene cyclase first forms γ-carotene by converting one of the ψ acyclic ends of the lycopene as a β-ring, then subsequently converts the other to form β-carotene. From β-carotene, hydrolases (blue) are responsible for the inclusion of two 3-hydroxy groups, and ketolases (green) for the addition of two 4-keto groups, forming multiple intermediate molecules until the final molecule, astaxanthin, is obtained.

== Synthetic sources ==
The structure of astaxanthin by synthesis was described in 1975. Nearly all commercially available astaxanthin for aquaculture is produced synthetically, with an annual market of about $1 billion in 2019.

An efficient synthesis from isophorone, &quot;cis&quot;-3-methyl-2-penten-4-yn-1-ol and a symmetrical C10-dialdehyde has been discovered and is used in industrial production. It combines these chemicals together with an ethynylation and then a Wittig reaction. Two equivalents of the proper ylide combined with the proper dialdehyde in a solvent of methanol, ethanol, or a mixture of the two, yields astaxanthin in up to 88% yields.
== Metabolic engineering ==
The cost of astaxanthin extraction, high market price, and lack of efficient fermentation production systems, combined with the intricacies of chemical synthesis, discourage its commercial development. The metabolic engineering of bacteria (&quot;Escherichia coli&quot;) enables efficient astaxanthin production from beta-carotene via either zeaxanthin or canthaxanthin.

== Structure ==
=== Stereoisomers ===
In addition to structural isomeric configurations, astaxanthin also contains two chiral centers at the 3- and 3-positions, resulting in three unique stereoisomers (3R,3R and 3R,3&#x27;S meso and 3S,3&#x27;S). While all three stereoisomers are present in nature, relative distribution varies considerably from one organism to another. Synthetic astaxanthin contains a mixture of all three stereoisomers, in approximately 1:2:1 proportions.

=== Esterification ===
Astaxanthin exists in two predominant forms, non-esterified (yeast, synthetic) or esterified (algal) with various length fatty acid moieties whose composition is influenced by the source organism as well as growth conditions. The astaxanthin fed to salmon to enhance flesh coloration is in the non-esterified form
 The predominance of evidence supports a de-esterification of fatty acids from the astaxanthin molecule in the intestine prior to or concomitant with absorption resulting in the circulation and tissue deposition of non-esterified astaxanthin. European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published a scientific opinion on a similar xanthophyll carotenoid, lutein, stating that &quot;following passage through the gastrointestinal tract and/or uptake lutein esters are hydrolyzed to form free lutein again&quot;. While it can be assumed that non-esterified astaxanthin would be more bioavailable than esterified astaxanthin due to the extra enzymatic steps in the intestine needed to hydrolyse the fatty acid components, several studies suggest that bioavailability is more dependent on formulation than configuration.

== Uses ==
Astaxanthin is used as a dietary supplement and feed supplement as food colorant for salmon, crabs, shrimp, chickens and egg production.

=== For seafood and animals ===
The primary use of synthetic astaxanthin today is as an animal feed additive to impart coloration, including farm-raised salmon and chicken egg yolks. Synthetic carotenoid pigments colored yellow, red or orange represent about 15–25% of the cost of production of commercial salmon feed. In the 21st century, most commercial astaxanthin for aquaculture is produced synthetically.

Class action lawsuits were filed against some major grocery store chains for not clearly labeling the astaxanthin-treated salmon as &quot;color added&quot;. The chains followed up quickly by labeling all such salmon as &quot;color added&quot;. Litigation persisted with the suit for damages, but a Seattle judge dismissed the case, ruling that enforcement of the applicable food laws was up to government and not individuals.

=== Dietary supplement ===
The primary human application for astaxanthin is as a dietary supplement, and it remains under preliminary research. In 2020, the European Food Safety Authority reported that an intake of 8 mg astaxanthin per day from food supplements is safe for adults.

== Role in the food chain ==

Lobsters, shrimp, and some crabs turn red when cooked because the astaxanthin, which was bound to the protein in the shell, becomes free as the protein denatures and unwinds. The freed pigment is thus available to absorb light and produce the red color.

== Regulations ==
In April 2009, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved astaxanthin as an additive for fish feed only as a component of a stabilized color additive mixture. Color additive mixtures for fish feed made with astaxanthin may contain only those diluents that are suitable. The color additives astaxanthin, ultramarine blue, canthaxanthin, synthetic iron oxide, dried algae meal, &quot;Tagetes&quot; meal and extract, and corn endosperm oil are approved for specific uses in animal foods. &quot;Haematococcus&quot; algae meal (21 CFR 73.185) and &quot;Phaffia&quot; yeast (21 CFR 73.355) for use in fish feed to color salmonoids were added in 2000.

In the European Union, astaxanthin-containing food supplements derived from sources that have no history of use as a source of food in Europe, fall under the remit of the Novel Food legislation, EC (No.) 258/97. Since 1997, there have been five novel food applications concerning products that contain astaxanthin extracted from these novel sources. In each case, these applications have been simplified or substantial equivalence applications, because astaxanthin is recognised as a food component in the EU diet.

<text>Hagoita (羽子板 ｢はごいた｣) are the wooden paddles used to hit shuttlecocks (羽子 pronounced hago ｢はご｣ or hane ｢はね｣), traditionally made of soapberry seeds and bird feathers, that are used to play the traditional Japanese pastime called hanetsuki during the New Year. The paddles are decorated with various images, sometimes executed in relief, of women in kimono, kabuki actors, and so on. Japanese people think playing hanetsuki is a way to drive away evil spirits because the movement of the hagoita is similar to the &quot;harau&quot; action (a Japanese expression meaning “to drive away”). Thus playing hanetsuki with hagoita is often used as a charm against evil.

==History==

Hagoita were introduced into Japan during the Muromachi period (1336–1573) from Ming dynasty China. In the Edo period (1603–1868), &quot;oshie-hagoita&quot; were designed with images of elegantly made-up kabuki actors (&quot;oshie&quot; meaning raised cloth pictures). They were made using &quot;washi&quot; or cloth cut out in the shape of flowers and people and pasted onto the paddle stuffed with cotton to give them a three-dimensional appearance. Over time, hagoita were not only used as game equipment but also as popular gifts and collectibles. During the Edo and Meiji period, many different kinds appeared; some high-quality paddles even used gold leaf and silver foil. With the industrial revolution, improved manufacturing technology promoted the development of hagoita. Also, among farmers, producing hagoita was a popular off-season side business.

After World War II, hagoita became popular decorations and souvenirs for locals and tourists. At present, hagoita are not limited to featuring portraits of kabuki actors but also of movie and TV stars and of famous athletes. For 350 years, an annual hagoita market has been held at the Sensō-ji temple in Tokyo. Operating from December 17 to 19, it attracts a large number of customers and also marks the end of the old year and the beginning of the new.

<text>Peter G. Schultz (born June 23, 1956) is an American chemist, entrepreneur, and nonprofit leader. He is the CEO and President and Professor of Chemistry at Scripps Research, the founder and former director of GNF, and the founding director of the California-Skaggs Institute for Innovative Medicines, established in 2012. In August 2014, Nature Biotechnology ranked Schultz the #1 top translational researcher in 2013. Schultz&#x27;s contributions to the field of chemistry have included the development and application of methods to expand the genetic code of living organisms, the discovery of catalytic antibodies, and the development and application of molecular diversity technologies to address problems in chemistry, biology, and medicine.

==Academic career==

Schultz completed his undergraduate degree at Caltech in 1979 and continued there for his doctoral degree in chemistry (in 1984) with Peter Dervan. His thesis work focused on the generation and characterization of 1,1-diazenes and the generation of sequence-selective polypyrrole DNA binding/cleaving molecules. He then spent a year at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with Christopher Walsh before joining the chemistry faculty at the University of California, Berkeley. He became a Principal Investigator of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 1985 and an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in 1994. In 1999, Schultz moved to Scripps Research and also became founding Director of the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation (GNF), which was initiated purely as a genomic research outlet of Novartis, but which grew during Schultz&#x27;s tenure to include a significant drug discovery effort and more than triple the number of intended employees (currently over 500 people). In March 2010, he left GNF to return to the nonprofit sector and, in March 2012, founded the California Institute for Biomedical Research (Calibr), later renamed the Calibr-Skaggs Institute for Innovative Medicines. Schultz was named CEO of Scripps Research in 2015 and President the following year. He has trained over 300 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, many of whom are on the faculties of major research universities.

==Research==

===Combinatorial chemistry and molecular evolution===

Much of Schultz&#x27;s work consists of finding ways to do a great many similar experiments at the same time, on many different compounds. He is one of the leading pioneers in combinatorial chemistry, screenable molecular libraries, and &quot;high-throughput&quot; chemistry. His interests are wide-ranging, with applications in such diverse areas as catalytic mechanisms, cell-specialization and other complex biological processes (normally studied by biologists, not chemists), basic photochemistry, biophysical probes of all stripes from NMR through positron-emission, and solid-state materials science.

Early in his career, Schultz showed that the natural molecular diversity of the immune system could be directed to generate catalytic antibodies. This method enabled the subsequent development of many new selective enzyme-like catalysts for reactions ranging from acyl transfer and redox reactions to pericyclic and metalation reactions. Although their catalytic activities are only rarely strong enough to be of practical use, catalytic antibodies have provided important new insights in our understanding of biocatalysis, structural plasticity of proteins, evolution of biochemical function, and the immune system itself.

Schultz then applied molecular diversity—the strategy of creating a large community of different molecules, plus a method for fishing out and identifying the ones that do what you want—to a range of problems in chemistry, biology and materials science. Along with Richard Lerner, he was one of the critical players in the development of phage-display libraries, and surface-library chips. For high-throughput bioassays which require freely soluble test-compounds, he uses microrobotic fluid-manipulation systems, adapted for 1,536-microwell cell-culture plates, to separately treat very small cell colonies with large numbers (hundreds of thousands) of different compounds.

Using these various high-throughput and combinatorial experimental approaches, Schultz has identified materials with novel optical, electronic, and catalytic properties; also, proteins and small molecules which control important biological processes such as aging, cancer, autoimmunity, and stem-cell differentiation and de-specialization back to pluripotency.

===Expanding the genetic code===

Schultz has pioneered a method for adding new building blocks, beyond the common twenty amino acids, to the genetic codes of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. This is accomplished by screening libraries of mutant amino acyl tRNA synthetases for mutants which charge nonsense-codon tRNAs with the desired unnatural amino acid. The organism which expresses such a synthetase can then be genetically programmed to incorporate the unnatural amino acid into a desired protein in the usual way, with the nonsense codon now coding for the unnatural amino acid. Normally, the unnatural amino acid itself must be synthesized in the lab and supplied to the organism by adding it to the organism&#x27;s growth medium. The unnatural amino acid must also be able to pass through the organism&#x27;s cell membrane into the interior of the organism.

More than 70 unnatural amino acids have been genetically encoded in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells, including photoreactive, chemically reactive, fluorescent, spin-active, sulfated, pre-phosphorylated, and metal-binding amino acids. This technology allows chemists to probe, and change, the properties of proteins, &quot;in vitro&quot; or &quot;in vivo&quot;, by directing novel, lab-synthesized chemical moieties specifically into any chosen site of any protein of interest.

A bacterial organism has been generated which biosynthesizes a novel, previously unnatural amino acid (p-aminophenylalanine) from basic carbon sources and includes this amino acid in its genetic code. This is the first example of the creation of an autonomous twenty-one-amino-acid organism.

=== Unnatural genetic information ===

Schultz&#x27;s group has recently created bacteria whose chromosomes include unnatural DNA-bases, and bacteria whose chromosomes are hybrids which include both RNA and DNA.

=== Origins of mitochondria ===

In order to probe details of the traditionally accepted hypothesis that mitochondria originated when independent bacteria capable of respiratory (oxygen-dependent) metabolism took up residence inside host cells which had previously only been capable of fermentation (metabolism without using oxygen), and evolved to establish a symbiotic relationship with them, Schultz&#x27;s group has created bacteria capable of surviving inside yeast cells and maintaining a symbiotic relationship with the host yeast cells by carrying out reactions which the yeast cells cannot catalyze without the bacteria. One goal of this work is to culture the yeast-bacteria hybrids and see whether the bacterial genome evolves to increase the mutual benefits of its chemical interactions with the host cells, as has happened with mitochondria over time.

=== ReFRAME drug repurposing library ===
Schultz and his team at the Calibr-Skaggs Institute for Innovative Medicines recognized that the chemical diversity and known safety profiles of drugs that had previously been tested in humans make them valuable to further explore for other potential therapeutic targets aside from originally intended use. This idea of &quot;drug repurposing&quot; is an appealing strategy for advancing a given drug with less time and resources from a candidate and into clinical application, and led to the creation of the ReFRAME (Repurposing, Focused Rescue, and Accelerated Medchem) drug repurposing library. ReFRAME offers open-access drug repositioning screening of around 13,000 compounds, nearly all of which are small molecules that have reached clinical development or seen significant preclinical profiling.

The library was created by combining three widely used commercial drug databases (Clarivate Integrity, GVK Excelra GoStar, and Citeline Pharmaprojects) along with patent mining of small molecules dosed in humans. One of the library&#x27;s first major successes screened its collection against &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; spp., a major cause of childhood diarrhea in developing countries. The library found two compounds (VB-201 and a structurally related analog of ASP-7962) previously tested in humans for other therapeutic uses that subsequently showed to be effective in animal models of the infection, providing novel candidates.

==Commercial activities==
Schultz is a founder of several biotechnology startups, including Affymax Research Institute, Symyx Technologies, Syrrx, Kalypsys, Phenomix, Ilypsa, Ambrx, Ardelyx, and Wildcat Discovery Technologies.

== Flywheel for scientific investment ==
At Scripps Research, Schultz has pioneered a &quot;bench-to-bedside&quot; model that is uncommon in the nonprofit research space. Through the establishment of the Calibr-Skaggs Institute for Innovative Medicines and a merger with the Scripps Research Translational Institute, as well as the formation of partnerships with pharmaceutical companies during his time as CEO and President of Scripps Research, Schultz has worked to accelerate fundamental scientific research into drug discovery and real-world medical advances. This model, based on the flywheel effect, has created a self-renewing revenue stream in which novel medicines that arise from the institute&#x27;s scientific findings lead to revenue that is then reinvested in institute research programs and used to further expand research capabilities. The strategy has helped Scripps Research to overcome the funding challenges typically faced by scientific research institutions.

==Publications and retractions==
Schultz has authored around 790 papers.

One of his papers in 2013 PNAS about making more stable antibodies was retracted, due to suspect data from co-author Shiladitya Sen:

Two papers from his lab published in 2004, one in &quot;Science&quot; and one in &quot;Journal of the American Chemical Society&quot;, were retracted in 2009, related to work in the Shultz lab by a postdoc, Zhiwen Zhang, on incorporating non-native glycosylated amino acids into proteins. Had it succeeded, this method could have become an essential tool for investigating the functions of carbohydrate attachments to proteins; however, the work could not be replicated, and when the lab went to find the relevant notebooks, they were missing. In the course of the investigation, Zhang received emails and phone calls blackmailing him, and at one point the person doing this wrote to several institutions and &quot;Science&quot; saying that he or she was going to commit suicide. The lab eventually identified the problem as a misunderstanding of the function of a key enzyme used in the experiments. The papers were:

<text>The Lost Regiment is a series of eight science fiction novels written by William R. Forstchen.

==Plot==
The plot revolves around a Union Army regiment and an artillery battery from the American Civil War, which got transported to an alien world. The 35th Maine Infantry Regiment and the 44th New York Light Artillery Battery travelled to a different world using a ship that emerged from a mysterious electrical storm. The alien world was populated by descendants of medieval Russians (or &quot;Rus&quot;), who still lived at a medieval level of technology. They learned that there were various civilizations on this world made up of descendants of people from various eras of Earth&#x27;s history. 

The Union soldiers eventually discovered that the Russians had been hiding the existence of the Tugar from them. The Tugars were ten-foot-tall aliens with a culture and technology similar to that of the Mongols. They rode a never-ending circuit around the planet and subjugated the human population in their territory for food. The Tugars visited each human society once a generation and culled part of the population for food so that the humans stay docile, compliant and never advanced enough to challenge them. The Union men were horrified by this revelation and kill the Tugars advanced scouts. They supported a peasant rebellion against the Tugar-appointed lords and begin modernizing Russian society. When the Tugars arrived, they encountered a semi-modern army equipped with cannons and smoothbore muskets. In a hard-fought battle, the humans managed to prevail, weakening the Tugars forever.

The next several books take up the story a few years later. The Russians had begun to explore the possibilities of a union with the Romans who lived next to their territory and were spared from the Tugar depredation by the Russian victory. Meanwhile, they faced a renewed threat from the Merki, members of the same alien race as the Tugars. The Merki make the same circumnavigation of the globe as the Tugars do but in a zone further south. Once the Merki learn of the Tugar&#x27;s weakening, they seek to take advantage of the Russians, realizing the disastrous effects that would come from an industrialized enemy. They seek to maintain their racial dominance over the humans through the annihilation of those who have learned the secrets of gunpowder and industrialization. The Merki are aided by a group of Union sailors who fled the Tugar war on the ship which brought the Unions to this world. In exchange for their survival, the humans help the Merki develop firearms and other technology. The Merki attack is more successful than the Tugar one and forces the humans to abandon the Russian territory in a scorched earth campaign, but eventually, they win with their use of trains. 

Several years later, the expanding human alliance faces a new threat in the form of the Bantag. The Bantag are a horde from even further south. They are led by a member of their race who arrived from another world that has a late 20th-century level of technology. This alien, a soldier in his own world, assumes a messianic role among the Bantag and modernizes their society to equal, and even surpass that of the humans. He is familiar with atomic reactors as well as centerfire rifles. The Bantag scavenge engines from decaying cities abandoned by their people millennia ago and use them to power airplanes. The reader learns that the people of the Bantag had once been a technologically advanced star-faring race, visiting many different planets and seeding teleportation devices across them. The Bantag homeworld collapsed in a nuclear war but the teleportation devices remained sporadically active and ended up transporting various humans to the planet Vallenia (the location of the novel), though Vallenia was not the homeworld of the Tugar, Merki, and Bantag Hordes. Using their advanced technology, the Bantag attacked the Union, introducing steampunk tanks and 20th-century mortars to the world of Vallenia. However, the humans developed their own flying machines (mainly blimps and early Zeppelins) and organized a counterattack.

The final book in the series, &quot;Down to the Sea&quot;, takes place a generation after the arrival of the Unions. With the children of the original regiment members reaching adulthood, they face a new threat from across the southern sea, the Kazars, aliens who have an early 20th-century level of technology and who also have a selectively bred slave race of human assassins, called the Shiv.

==35th Maine==
The 35th Regiment, Maine Volunteer Infantry is a fictional volunteer regiment (Maine really raised 32 Infantry regiments) during the American Civil War in William Forstchen&#x27;s The Lost Regiment series. (The regiment is based on Joshua Chamberlain&#x27;s 20th Maine Infantry.)

Before the series Andrew Lawrence Keane is a lieutenant who assumed command when a superior officer was KIA at Antietam. Keane&#x27;s leadership under the guidance of his sergeant, Hans Schuder, made them ripe for promotion as they progressed through Fredericksburg, Cold Harbor and Gettysburg.

At the start of the series, Keane is promoted to colonel after losing his arm at Gettysburg. Hans Schuder was recently promoted to sergeant major. In the world of Valennia, the 35th becomes essentially a vassal force to Boyar Ivor of the &quot;Rus&quot; people, who appear to be derived from early Russian peoples earlier transported to Valennia. When Ivor is overthrown, it becomes the core of the anti-Tugar resistance, with Keane filling as a military dictator. As time goes on, the men of the 35th are rapidly promoted to fill the officer corps of the Rus Army and train the Rus forces. When all hope seemed lost, the Rus broke ranks in the Tugar War, the 35th reformed and made a desperate last defense.

After the Tugar War, the 35th becomes the most respected regiment, on which the Army of Russia is centered. Analogous to the United States Military Academy at West Point, the 35th is the best that Rus has to offer and provides a place to train new officers for the Army of the Republic. Even some men from the original 35th remain in the regiment when they could otherwise be high-ranking officers.

Men from the original 35th include (in progress):

* Andrew Keane (Colonel)
* Hans Schuder (Sergeant Major)
* Barry (Sergeant)
* Tim Kindred
* Hank Petracci
* Chuck Ferguson
* Gates
* Vincent Hawthorne
* Jim Hinsen
* John Mina
* Emil Weiss (regimental surgeon)

<text>The Crypta Neapolitana (Latin for &quot;Neapolitan crypt&quot;) is an ancient Roman road tunnel near Naples, Italy. It was built in 37 BC and is over 700 metres long.

The tunnel connected Naples with the so-called Phlegrean Fields and the town of Pozzuoli along the road known as the &quot;via Domiziana&quot;.

== Geography ==
The eastern entrance (on the Naples side) lies in the Vergiliano park of Piedigrotta (&quot;at the foot of the grotta&quot;); the western end is in the area now called Fuorigrotta (&quot;outside the grotta&quot;).

The site is also noteworthy for the presence of the so-called Virgil&#x27;s tomb, as well as the tomb of the Italian poet Giacomo Leopardi.

== History ==
Naples and Pozzuoli were separated by a great impenetrable marsh: the first road between the two cities was probably built by the Greeks and was narrow and indirect.

The first Roman road connecting Neapolis and the Phlegrean fields, the &quot;via (Antiniana) per colles&quot;, was built at the beginning of the 1st century BC and followed the easiest route but it was nevertheless still long, difficult, tortuous and traversed steep hills. It climbed the hills of Vomero and came back down towards Fuorigrotta arriving at the modern Via Terracina from where it continued to the ports of Puteoli and Cumae. As Puteoli and associated trade between the two cities grew, the old road needed to be improved, so the tunnel shortened the route and avoided several hills.

The tunnel was first built by the architect Lucius Cocceius Auctus for Agrippa during the civil war between Octavian and Sextus Pompeius in . The new road, called &quot;via per cryptam&quot;, turned north at the west end of the tunnel, heading towards Via Leopardi and reconnecting with the old road, the via Neapolis-Puteoli, at the top of Via Terracina where a way-station (&quot;tabernae&quot;) and adjoining thermal spa complex has been excavated.

The tunnel is one of four road tunnels built in the area by Cocceius: others are the Grotta di Seiano (tunnel of Sejanus) in Posillipo, the Grotta di Cocceio from Lake Avernus to Cumae, and the Crypta Romana from Cumae to its port, as part of a network of military infrastructures including construction of the Portus Julius.

The Aqua Augusta (Serino) aqueduct was built later in parallel to the road tunnel.

The tunnel was still in use as a roadway until superseded by two modern tunnels in the early 20th century, and shows extensive restoration done by the architects of the Bourbon dynasty of Naples. During the Second World War it was used as a bomb shelter for the inhabitants of Bagnoli; the war and some landslides during the fifties put it back into a state of neglect. Today it has been restored as an archaeological site.

According to mediaeval legend, the tunnel was built by the poet Virgil in a single night.

<doc id="1007355" wikidata="Q206550" url="?curid=1007355" title="Citril finch">
<text>The citril finch (Carduelis citrinella), also known as the Alpine citril finch, is a small songbird, a member of the true finch family, Fringillidae. 

This bird is a resident breeder in the mountains of southwestern Europe from Spain to the Alps. Its northernmost breeding area is found in the Black Forest of southwestern Germany.

==Taxonomy==

The citril finch was formally described by the German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in 1764 under the binomial name &quot;Fringilla citrinella&quot;. The current genus name &quot;Carduelis&quot; is the Latin word for the European goldfinch, and the specific epithet &quot;citrinella&quot; is the Italian word for a small yellow bird. It is a diminutive of the Latin &quot;citrinus&quot; meaning citrine or light greenish-yellow. The Corsican finch (&quot;Carduelis corsicana&quot;) was at one time considered as conspecific with the citril finch, but is now treated as a separate species. Molecular genetic studies have shown that the citril finch is closely related to the European goldfinch (&quot;Carduelis carduelis&quot;).

==Description and systematics==

The citril finch has an overall length of and weighs around . It is greyish above, with a brown tinge to the back which also has black streaks. The underparts and the double wing bars are yellow. It shares with its relatives a bright face mask which in this species is also yellow.

Sexes are similar, although young females may be duller below, and juvenile birds – unlike in the European &quot;Serinus&quot; species – are brown, lacking any yellow or green in the plumage.

The song is a silvery twittering resembling that of the European goldfinch (&quot;C. carduelis&quot;) and that of the European serin (&quot;Serinus serinus&quot;). The main call is a &quot;tee-ee&quot;, quite similar to the Eurasian siskin (&quot;Spinus spinus&quot;).

==Ecology==

The citril finch (&quot;Carduelis citrinella&quot;) differs from the Corsican finch (&quot;C. corsicana&quot;) in habitat selection. While the mainland citril finch is rather restricted to subalpine coniferous forests and Alpine meadows, the insular Corsican finch may be found in different habitats from sea level to the highest mountain slopes. The citril finch nests mainly in conifers such as pines (&quot;Pinus&quot;) and spruces (&quot;Picea&quot;) while the Corsican finch uses also lower bushes such as tree Heath (&quot;Erica arborea&quot;), juniper (&quot;Juniperus&quot;) and bramble (&quot;Rubus&quot;).

Ranging more widely than its equally common eastern relative, the citril finch is classified as a Species of Least Concern by the IUCN.

<text>Enculturation is the process by which people learn the dynamics of their surrounding culture and acquire values and norms appropriate or necessary to that culture and its worldviews.

== Definition and history of research ==

The term enculturation was used first by sociologist of science Harry Collins to describe one of the models whereby scientific knowledge is communicated among scientists. 
The ingredients discussed by Collins for enculturation are 

# Learning by Immersion: whereby aspiring scientists learn by engaging in the daily activities of the laboratory, interacting with other scientists, and participating in experiments and discussions.
# Tacit Knowledge: highlighting the importance of tacit knowledge—knowledge that is not easily codified or written down but is acquired through experience and practice. 
# Socialization: where individuals learn the social norms, values, and behaviours expected within the scientific community. 
# Language and Discourse: Scientists must become fluent in the terminology, theoretical frameworks, and modes of argumentation specific to their discipline.
# Community Membership: recognition of the individual as a legitimate member of the scientific community. 

The problem tackled in the article of Harry Collins was the early experiments for the detection of gravitational waves. 

Collins defines the enculturation model by contrast with what he calls algorithmical model: 


Enculturation is mostly studied in sociology and anthropology. The influences that limit, direct, or shape the individual (whether deliberately or not) include parents, other adults, and peers. If successful, enculturation results in competence in the language, values, and rituals of the culture. Growing up, everyone goes through their own version of enculturation. Enculturation helps form an individual into an acceptable citizen. Culture impacts everything that an individual does, regardless of whether they know about it. Enculturation is a deep-rooted process that binds together individuals. Even as a culture undergoes changes, elements such as central convictions, values, perspectives, and young raising practices remain similar. Enculturation paves way for tolerance which is highly needed for peaceful co-habitance. 

The process of enculturation, most commonly discussed in the field of anthropology, is closely related to socialization, a concept central to the field of sociology. Both roughly describe the adaptation of an individual into social groups by absorbing the ideas, beliefs and practices surrounding them. In some disciplines, socialization refers to the deliberate shaping of the individual. As such, the term may cover both deliberate and informal enculturation.

The process of learning and absorbing culture need not be social, direct or conscious. Cultural transmission can occur in various forms, though the most common social methods include observing other individuals, being taught or being instructed. Less obvious mechanisms include learning one&#x27;s culture from the media, the information environment and various social technologies, which can lead to cultural transmission and adaptation across societies. A good example of this is the diffusion of hip-hop culture into states and communities beyond its American origins.

Enculturation has often been studied in the context of non-immigrant African Americans.

Conrad Phillip Kottak (in &quot;Window on Humanity&quot;) writes:

Enculturation is referred to as &quot;acculturation&quot; in some academic literature. However, more recent literature has signalled a difference in meaning between the two. Whereas enculturation describes the process of learning one&#x27;s own culture, acculturation denotes learning a different culture, for example, that of a host. The latter can be linked to ideas of a culture shock, which describes an emotionally-jarring disconnect between one&#x27;s old and new culture cues.

Famously, the sociologist Talcott Parsons once described children as &quot;barbarians&quot; of a sort, since they are fundamentally uncultured.

== How enculturation occurs ==
When minorities come into the U.S., these people might fully associate with their racial legacy prior to taking part in processing enculturation. Enculturation can happen in several ways. Direct education implies that your family, instructors, or different individuals from the general public unequivocally show you certain convictions, esteems, or anticipated standards of conduct. Parents may play a vital role in teaching their children standard behavior for their culture, including table manners and some aspects of polite social interactions. Strict familial and societal teaching, which often uses different forms of positive and negative reinforcement to shape behavior, can lead a person to adhere closely to their religious convictions and customs. Schools also provide a formal setting to learn national values, such as honoring a country&#x27;s flag, national anthem, and other significant patriotic symbols.

Participatory learning occurs as individuals take an active role of interacting with their environment and culture. Through their own engagement in meaningful activities, they learn socio-cultural norms for their area and may adopt related qualities and values. For example, if your school organizes an outing to gather trash at a public park, this action assists with ingraining the upsides of regard for nature and ecological protection. Strict customs frequently stress participatory learning - for example, kids who take part in the singing of psalms during Christmas will assimilate the qualities and practices of the occasion.

Observational learning is when knowledge is gained essentially by noticing and emulating others. As much as an individual related to a model accepts that emulating the model will prompt good results and feels that one is fit for mimicking the way of behaving, learning can happen with no unequivocal instruction. For example, a youngster who is sufficiently fortunate to be brought into the world by guardians in a caring relationship will figure out how to be tender and mindful in their future connections.

<doc id="1007366" wikidata="Q1063378" url="?curid=1007366" title="Takhtajania">
<text>Takhtajania is a genus of flowering plants of the family Winteraceae, which contains a single species, Takhtajania perrieri. It is endemic to Madagascar.

&quot;Takhtajania&quot; is found in a small area of the Madagascar subhumid forests. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub, with shiny green lance-shaped leaves and reddish-pink flowers.

The first known specimen of the plant was collected in 1909 on the Manongarivo Massif of central Madagascar at an elevation of 1700 meters. In 1963, the French botanist René Paul Raymond Capuron examined the unidentified plant sample, which he identified as a new species, which he named &quot;Bubbia perrieri&quot;, after the French botanist Henri Perrier de la Bâthie, classifying it in the Australasian Winteraceae genus &quot;Bubbia&quot;. In 1978, the botanists Baranova and J. F. Leroy reclassified the plant into its own genus, &quot;Takhtajania&quot;, after the Russian botanist Armen Takhtajan. It was published in Adansonia, n.s., Vol.17 on page 388. In 1994 Malagasy plant collector Fanja Rasoavimbahoaka collected a specimen in Anjahanaribe-Sud Special Reserve 150 km from the location at which the 1909 specimen was collected, which George E. Schatz identified in May 1997 as &quot;Takhtajania&quot;. A subsequent expedition discovered a large grove of the species at the spot where the second sample was collected.

&quot;Takhtajania&quot; lacks water-conducting cells, called vessels, which allow plants to withstand drought, and must have remained in moist conditions for millions of years.

<doc id="1007368" wikidata="Q3275794" url="?curid=1007368" title="Hanetsuki">
<text>is a Japanese traditional game, similar to racket games like badminton but without a net, played with a rectangular wooden paddle called a &quot;hagoita&quot; and a brightly coloured shuttlecock, called a &quot;hane&quot;. Often played by girls at the New Year, the game can be played by any gender in two fashions: by one person attempting to keep the shuttlecock aloft as long as possible, or by two people batting it back and forth. Players who fail to hit the shuttlecock get marked on the face with India Ink. Traditionally, the longer the shuttlecock remains in the air, the greater protection from mosquitoes the players will receive during the coming year. Although &quot;hanetsuki&quot; is not as popular as it used to be, decorative &quot;hagoita &quot;are commonly sold throughout Japan.

The game is also known as .

&quot;Hagoita&quot; often have pictures of kabuki theatre performers or celebrities on them.

At the beginning of the game&#x27;s development, soapberry nuts were often used as shuttlecocks.

<doc id="1007390" wikidata="Q4351934" url="?curid=1007390" title="HMS Magnificent (1894)">
<text>HMS &quot;Magnificent&quot; was one of the nine pre-dreadnought battleships of the Royal Navy. She entered service in late 1895 with the Channel Fleet, remaining with the fleet through its subsequent reorganisation into the Atlantic Fleet. In 1905, an explosion caused the deaths of 18 men but she remained in service until 1906, after which she underwent a refit. She served with the Home Fleet for most of her pre-war service.

Among the oldest of Britain&#x27;s battleships at the time, &quot;Magnificent&quot; was a guard ship on the Humber when the First World War broke out. She was then, together with her sister ship , assigned to Scapa Flow as a guard ship. In 1915, she was stripped of her main armament, and later in that year was converted to a troopship for use in the Dardanelles Campaign. Returning to England in 1916, she was inactive until late 1917, at which time she was converted to an ammunition ship. She continued to serve in this role until 1921, at which time she was decommissioned before being scrapped the following year.

== Design ==

&quot;Magnificent&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced up to at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of two 3-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines powered by eight coal-fired, cylindrical fire-tube Scotch marine boilers. By 1907–1908, she was re-boilered with oil-fired models. Her engines provided a top speed of at . The &quot;Majestic&quot;s were considered good seaboats with an easy roll and good steamers, although they suffered from high fuel consumption. She had a crew of 672 officers and ratings.

The ship was armed with a main battery of four BL Mk VIII guns in twin-gun turrets, one forward and one aft. The turrets were placed on pear-shaped barbettes; six of her sisters had the same arrangement, but her sisters and and all future British battleship classes had circular barbettes. &quot;Magnificent&quot; also carried a secondary battery of twelve QF /40 guns. They were mounted in casemates in two gun decks amidships. She also carried sixteen QF 12-pounder guns and twelve QF 2-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. She was also equipped with five torpedo tubes, four of which were submerged in the ship&#x27;s hull, with the last in a deck-mounted launcher.

&quot;Magnificent&quot; and the other &quot;Majestic&quot;-class ships had 9 inches (229 mm) of Harvey steel in their belt armour, which allowed equal protection with less weight compared to previous types of armour. This allowed &quot;Magnificent&quot; and her sisters to have a deeper and lighter belt than previous battleships without any loss of protection. The barbettes for the main battery were protected with of armor, and the conning tower had the same thickness of steel on the sides. The ship&#x27;s armored deck was thick.

== Service history ==
&quot;Magnificent&quot; was laid down at the Chatham Dockyard on 18 December 1893. She was launched a year and a day later, on 19 December 1894, after which fitting-out work commenced. She was commissioned into the Royal Navy another year later, in December 1895, to relieve the battleship as second flagship of the Channel Fleet. On 26 June 1897, she was present at the Fleet Review at Spithead for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Captain John Ferris was appointed in command in January 1899, and from February the following year she joined the Eastern division of the Channel Fleet, flying the flag of Rear-Admiral Arthur Dalrymple Fanshawe. On receiving word of the death of Queen Victoria on 21 January 1901 while stationed in Portsmouth, &quot;Magnificent&quot; flew the Royal Standard at half mast. Captain Arthur John Horsley was appointed in command in October 1900, and in June the following year she became flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir William Acland, second in command of the Channel Squadron. He relinquished the position one year later, and at sunset on 5 June 1902 struck his flag on board the &quot;Magnificent&quot;. Rear-Admiral Assheton Curzon-Howe, who had succeeded Acland, transferred to the vessel later the same month. She took part in the fleet review held at Spithead on 16 August 1902 for the coronation of King Edward VII, and visited the Aegean Sea for combined manoeuvres with the Mediterranean Fleet the following month. Captain Sackville Carden was appointed in command on 16 October 1902, and took her to visit Gibraltar and Tetuan the following week.

By January 1904, the ship had become the flagship of the Channel Fleet. As a result of a reorganization in January 1905, the Channel Fleet became the Atlantic Fleet, and &quot;Magnificent&quot; accordingly became a part of the Atlantic Fleet. A gun explosion aboard &quot;Magnificent&quot; on 14 June 1905 resulted in 18 casualties. The explosion was caused by a faulty shell in one of the 6-inch guns; it failed to fire, and when the loader opened the breech, contact with the fresh air detonated the shell. On 15 November 1906, she ended her Atlantic Fleet service and was paid off at Devonport. &quot;Magnificent&quot; was commissioned into reserve on 16 November 1906, based at Chatham. During her reserve service, she was attached to the Gunnery School at Sheerness as a gunnery training ship in December 1906.

&quot;Magnificent&quot; left Chatham in March 1907 and was assigned to the Nore Division of the Home Fleet at the Nore. During this service, she was temporarily the flagship of the Commander-in-Chief in November 1907 and underwent a refit at Chatham in 1908 during which she had new fire control systems installed and was converted to burn fuel oil. She served as the second flagship of the Home Fleet from August 1908 to January 1909. &quot;Magnificent&quot; was reduced to a nucleus crew in February 1909 as part of the commissioned reserve. On 24 March 1909, she became the flagship of the Vice Admiral, 3rd and 4th Divisions, Home Fleet, at the Nore. She was relieved as flagship on 1 March 1910 by the battleship . On 27 September 1910, &quot;Magnificent&quot; was recommissioned into the Home Fleet to serve as a turret drill ship and stokers&#x27; training ship at Devonport. Her sternwalk was damaged in a collision in December 1910. She became tender to the turret drill ship in February 1911 and a seagoing gunnery training ship at Devonport on 14 May 1912. She was slightly damaged on 16 June 1913 when she ran aground in fog near Cawsand Bay. She recommissioned for 3rd Fleet service on 1 July 1913.

=== First World War ===
During a precautionary mobilisation of the fleet immediately prior to the outbreak of First World War, &quot;Magnificent&quot; and her sister ships , , and on 27 July 1914 formed the 9th Battle Squadron, subordinate to the Admiral of Patrols and stationed at the Humber. &quot;Magnificent&quot; served as guard ship at the Humber. The war began while she was stationed there. On 7 August 1914, the 9th Battle Squadron was dissolved, and &quot;Magnificent&quot; and &quot;Hannibal&quot; transferred to Scapa Flow to reinforce the defences of the anchorage of the Grand Fleet there, becoming a guard ship at Scapa Flow. The &quot;Majestic&quot;-class ships were by then the oldest and least effective battleships in service in the Royal Navy. The first-class protected cruiser relieved &quot;Magnificent&quot; of guard ship duty on 16 February 1915, at which point &quot;Magnificent&quot; was paid off.

Later in February 1915, &quot;Magnificent&quot; arrived at Belfast to be disarmed. In March and April 1915, all of her 12-inch guns and all except for four of her 6-inch guns were removed. Her 12-inch guns were taken to arm the new &quot;Lord Clive&quot;-class monitors and . After she was disarmed, &quot;Magnificent&quot; was laid up at Loch Goil in April 1915. On 9 September 1915, &quot;Magnificent&quot; was recommissioned to serve along with her similarly disarmed sister ships &quot;Hannibal&quot; and &quot;Mars&quot; as a troopship for the Dardanelles campaign. The three former battleships departed the United Kingdom on this duty on 22 September 1915, arriving at Mudros on 7 October 1915. On 18 December 1915 and 19 December 1915, &quot;Magnificent&quot; took part in the evacuation of Allied troops from Suvla Bay. She departed the Dardanelles in February 1916 after the conclusion of the campaign and returned to England, where she was paid off at Devonport on 3 March 1916.

&quot;Magnificent&quot; remained at Devonport until August 1917, serving as an overflow ship. In August 1917, she began a refit at Harland &amp; Wolff in Belfast for conversion to an ammunition ship. When her refit was completed in October 1918, she was transferred to Rosyth for service as an ammunition store ship. &quot;Magnificent&quot; was placed on the disposal list on 4 February 1920, but continued to serve as an ammunition store ship at Rosyth until April 1921. She was sold for scrapping on 9 May 1921. Scrapping began at Thos. W. Ward Inverkeithing the following year.

In the Edo period, firefighters were paid not only for actual firefighting activity but also for promptness and presence at the scene of a fire. Thus, wearing conspicuous and dancing on intact roofs near fires with was essential for them.

<text>The Maruti Suzuki 800 is a city car that was manufactured by Maruti Suzuki in India from 1983 to 2014. The first generation (SS80) was based on the 1979 Suzuki Alto and had an 800 cc F8B engine, hence the moniker. Widely regarded as the most influential automobile in India, about 2.87 million 800s were produced during its course of which 2.66 million were sold in India itself.

Produced for 31 years, the Maruti Suzuki 800 remains the second longest production car in India, next only to Hindustan Ambassador.

==Origins==

Sanjay Gandhi tried his hand at the car business unsuccessfully before his tragic death in 1980. His mother Indira Gandhi wanted to fulfill Sanjay&#x27;s dream of an indigenous people&#x27;s car and formed Maruti Udyog Ltd a year later. A joint venture agreement was signed with Suzuki on October 2, 1982.

==History==

In the 1980s and early 1990s, the name &quot;Maruti&quot; was synonymous with the Maruti Suzuki 800. It remained the best-selling car in India until 2004, when the Maruti Suzuki Alto took the title. It was also exported to a number of countries in South Asia including Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka and was also available in Morocco and selected European markets, often sold as the Suzuki Maruti. In an elaborate ceremony held in New Delhi on 14 December 1983, then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi handed over keys of the very first car to Mr. Harpal Singh S/O Haridas Singh, who won the ownership rights through a lucky draw. The original 800 was based on the Suzuki Fronte SS80, but a modernized aerodynamic version using the body of the second-generation Alto (SB308) was presented in late 1986. The introduction of this car revolutionized the automotive industry in India. From its inception, it was considered as the first affordable people&#x27;s car, the first modern era front wheel drive and high speed small contemporary vehicle, and the only reasonably modern car available in India, the incumbent mainstay Hindustan Ambassador and Premier Padmini being based on long-obsolete 1950s designs. The delivery was against bookings done directly with Maruti Udyog Limited (A Govt. of India undertaking). The prospective owner would then have to wait for almost three years after booking till delivery. Such extended waiting times gave rise to some people indulging into black marketing and earning premiums as much as 40%. Cars produced during the early years were essentially Suzuki OEM components imported from Japan and merely assembled by Maruti Udyog Limited at the Gurgaon plant.

Exports to neighboring countries commenced in 1987, and were followed by a shipment of 500 cars to Hungary, with the first car arriving on 24 October 1987. Soon, exports to Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia followed, two other markets with less restrictive homologation requirements than Western Europe. After successes there, and in spite of Suzuki&#x27;s objections, Maruti Suzuki tackled more competitive markets and entered France in 1989, the Netherlands in 1990, followed by England, Malta, and Italy. In markets where Japanese cars had a quota, the 800 was sold as a Maruti, with all mention of Suzuki carefully removed – even the user manuals were revised, so as not to fall afoul of the quota requirements. The 800 continued to be sold in Italy and other Western European markets until 2004, when it no longer met emissions and safety requirements. The Maruti Suzuki had never been equipped with seat belts until exports began, meaning that such parts originally had to be imported from Japan to be fitted to export market cars, as with everything relating to building left-hand-drive cars. The Maruti also got its first catalytic converter to meet European requirements. The cleaner version first arrived in August 1992 and was originally reserved for Europe.

Suzuki in Japan wanted to end production of the 800 and replace it with the Maruti Suzuki Zen. In 1993 the Suzuki royalties for the 800 would end, meaning Maruti Suzuki had an incentive to keep making that car. In the end a compromise was reached where Suzuki would continue to get a small royalty and they agreed to make small improvements to keep the 800 relevant in the market. The first major update was the 1997 update with new headlamps, front and rear bumpers, a new dashboard and the steering wheel from the Zen. In 2000 the engine got fuel injection with 4 valves per head. This gave more power (46hp/35kW) but also meant it met new Euro II emissions standards.

== Phase-out==
Maruti Suzuki had begun a phase-out of the Maruti Suzuki 800 beginning in April 2010, as they did not have plans to upgrade it to Euro IV or BS IV emission norms, instead choosing to replace it with the second generation Maruti Suzuki Alto 800 in India. Starting in April 2010, Maruti halted sales of the car in 13 major cities: the four metros of Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and 9 other cities including Kanpur, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Ahmedabad, Agra and Surat, where the law made it mandatory for the vehicles sold to be Euro IV compliant.

Another reason cited was the relatively outdated model&#x27;s declining sales. Maruti Suzuki 800 sales were down by 3.7% in April 2010, when compared with April 2009. Total sales of Maruti Suzuki 800 was 33028 for the period April 2009 to March 2010. The Indian Automobile industry is the seventh largest in the world, with an annual production of over 4 million vehicles and exports of about 600,000. In 2009, India emerged as Asia&#x27;s fourth largest exporter of automobiles, behind Japan, South Korea and Thailand.
The last Maruti Suzuki 800 was rolled off the production lines on 18 January 2014.

==Changes==



After a full model change in 1986, the 800 underwent some minor facelifts but overall it still remained similar as it was on introduction. The car produces approximately and runs on 12-inch wheels. Kerb weight is and it can seat five passengers including the driver. Maruti Suzuki had earlier launched a version with a twelve-valve version of the engine producing and coupled with a five-speed manual transmission (currently found in the Suzuki Alto), but discontinued it after a couple of years. The second generation Maruti Suzuki 800 that was produced from 1986–1997 underwent some changes in its appearance. The original grille that was introduced in 1986 was a horizontal slat grille with &#x27;Maruti 800&#x27; monogram at the right hand corner. This grille was replaced by a mesh grille with the Maruti Logo on the centre in October 1994. Also, the bonnet opener that was placed on the bonnet was replaced by an ejection button inside of the car. The hubcaps were also changed from the shiny silver ones to plastic ones. Several new colours were also introduced, such as Maruti Green, St Germaine Red, Pearl White, and Neptune Blue.
A Euro III emission-compliant version of the car was released in 2005 to meet Indian emissions regulations. An LPG version of the vehicle was also released in 2008. As of September 2009, the company has yet to reach a decision regarding the manufacture of a Euro IV-compliant version of the vehicle because it would increase the retail price. However even stricter emissions regulations which came into effect by April 2010, would mandate Euro IV compliance in major Indian cities including Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bangalore and 2015–2016 for the remainder of the country. By 2005, Maruti Suzuki had planned to phase out the 800 around 2010, but it was still on sale in October 2011. Its main competitor is the less expensive Tata Nano (123,000 compared to 184,641 rupees) which has an 8 percent smaller exterior size and a noisier engine with less torque. In 2011, Maruti Suzuki declared it would relaunch the Maruti Suzuki 800 with a new version compliant with Euro IV emission norms to tap the small car market to compete with the Tata Nano, but later on Maruti Suzuki decided to phase out as it was not feasible for the company.

<text>Jadavpur is a neighbourhood of South Kolkata in Kolkata district in West Bengal, India. Jadavpur is one of the important junctions in South Kolkata. Jadavpur University and a number of research institutes of national and international repute are located in Jadavpur.

==Etymology==
Jadavpur was named after Late Jadav Narayan Sarkar, zamindar of Sonarpur.

==History==
In 1862, &quot;the Calcutta and South-Eastern Railway opened a line south-ward from what was then called Beliaghata Station to Port Canning.&quot; The line (now part of Sealdah South lines) passes through Jadavpur.

In 1876, Dr. Mahendra Lal Sarkar, established the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, an institution for fundamental research in basic sciences, at Jadavpur, as an entirely private effort. Sir C. V. Raman carried out ground-breaking work in the field of light scattering in this institute and it was first published by the institute in the Indian Journal of Physics. It earned him the 1930 Nobel Prize for Physics.

With donations from Raja Subodh Chandra Mullick, Brajendra Kishore Roychowdhury and others, the National Council of Education, set up the institutions at Jadavpur, in 1906, as a Swadeshi effort for the promotion of science and technology. The Bengal Technical Institute was &quot;initially set up at Maniktala but soon moved to what was then the quiet suburban retreat of Jadavpur. Later, this became the College of Engineering and Technology, and finally in 1955, Jadavpur University. The progress of Jadavpur University from a technical institute to a diversified university with flourishing arts and science faculties, including several centres for advanced work in various areas, is perhaps the most significant and heartening development in Kolkata’s academic life since independence.&quot;

Jadavpur is home to two research institutes, under the Council of Scientific &amp; Industrial Research – the Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, established in 1935, and the Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute, established in 1950.

The Calcutta Municipal Corporation Act 1980, which came into effect in 1984, extended the boundaries of Kolkata by including South Suburban, Garden Reach and Jadavpur municipalities in Kolkata.

With the partition of Bengal in 1947, &quot;millions of refugees poured in from erstwhile East Pakistan.&quot; In the initial stages bulk of the refugees were non-agriculturists. A few of them made their own arrangements, but &quot;it was squatters who made the East Bengali refugees famous or infamous.&quot; Squatting (&quot;jabardakhal&quot; in Bengali) ranged from the forcible occupation of barracks to the collective take-over of private, government and waste land. &quot;This happened as early as 1948 with middle class refugees in the Jadabpur area: first on government land and then on private property, leading to violent clashes. Having won the battle, the elated squatters named their colony ‘Bijaygarh’, the Fort of Victory.&quot; By 1949, there were 40 such colonies in Jadavpur, Kasba, Santoshpur, Garia and Behala, in the south-eastern part of the city, and 65 in the Dum Dum and Panihati zone in the north. Subsequently squatters colonies also came up along the west bank of the Hooghly and by 1950, there were 150 such colonies. &quot;Their names – Surya Sen Nagar, Bapujinagar, Bidhanpally, Adarshanagar – reflected their creators’ memories of the past and hopes for the future.&quot; The squatters resorted to various strategies to gain legitimacy and government aid. A common practice was to invite leading personalities of Calcutta society to be the president of their refugee association. At one point of time Basanti Devi, then widow of Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das, was president of the Jadavpur Refugee Camp Association for a short period. The efforts of the East Bengali refugees in rebuilding their lives, virtually with their own efforts, has been spoken of as &quot;self-rehabilitation&quot;. To take just one example of their success: by 1952, Bijaygarh boasted of four schools, one college, a market, a post office, a temple and even a hospital. No doubt, Bijaygarh was a model for others to follow. Efforts have been made in more recent years to regularise land/property rights in the refugee colonies.

==Geography==

The factory was locked out in 1989 and referred to the Bureau of Industrial and Financial Restructuring in 1990. “Initially, Bengal Lamp’s shut-down figured prominently in political discourse… but that has petered out..Bengal Lamp has faded from public memory.” There were 480 workers at the time of lock-out.
* Sulekha Ink entered the fountain pen ink market as an alternative to imported brands and became a preferred choice throughout the country. Christened by Rabindra Nath Tagore, the company was owned by Kalyan Moitra. The company dropped its shutters in 1989. In 2005, the company sold its ‘excess’ land at Jadavpur and reorganised its factory. Two housing projects, Devaloke Heights and Devaloke Fort, and a jewellery shop of Senco Gold, has come up on Sulekha&#x27;s land.
* National Instruments Limited, a Government of India Undertaking, used to produce gauges &amp; indicators, thermometers, surveying instruments, optical instruments and possibly was the only Indian manufacturer of mass-produced cameras (National 35 model). As it became sick, it was closed down and transferred to Jadavpur University in 2009.
* Annapurna Glass Works
* Krishna Glass Works

===Markets===
The Jadavpur 8B area has recently become a very popular shopping destination, having shops of almost every need. Since Bengali cuisine is almost synonymous with fish, the Jadavpur market is a major place where you will get a wide variety of fishes, specially Ilish mach (Hilsa fish), Pabda and the ever present Ruhi. Also available are sea water fishes like Pomfret and Mackerel. Vendors also offer chickens and geese; those chosen are slaughtered on the spot and usually carried home on rickshaws. It boasts of a large farmer&#x27;s market, serviced by the rail line. Sukanta setu market is another busy situated in this area. It is mainly starts in morning and closes within couple of hours. The morning rush of vendors and buyers often creates traffic jam in this area.

South City Mall, the biggest shopping mall in eastern India, has been opened at Prince Anwar Shah Road since 2008. It has definitely added some more value to the residents of this region.

<text>The four-banded sandgrouse (Pterocles quadricinctus) is a medium-sized bird in the sandgrouse family.

==Description==
The four-banded sandgrouse is 25–28 cm long. Its head, neck and upperparts are yellowish-green, with the back heavily marked with brown. The male has black and white bands on its forehead as well as black and white bands separating the breast from the heavily barred belly. The female lacks the head and breast bands and is heavily barred on the back and flanks. It has a small, pigeon-like head and neck, but a sturdy compact body. It has long pointed wings, which are grey underneath, a short tail and a fast direct flight. 

==Distribution and habitat==
This gregarious species occurs in a belt across Africa from Mauritania and Cameroon east to Sudan and Uganda. It is much more common in the west of its range. It is a partial seasonal migrant, with some birds moving further north in the rainy season. It breeds on open areas with some trees, including savanna, scrubland and similar habitats.

==Behaviour==
Flocks fly to watering holes in the evening to drink and are largely nocturnal. The call is a loud &quot;wulli-wulli&quot;, and there is much twittering at the drinking holes. The nest is a ground scrape into which 2 or 3 buff eggs with brown markings are laid. Both sexes incubate.

<doc id="1007426" wikidata="Q205351" url="?curid=1007426" title="Piotr Nowak">
<text>Piotr &quot;Peter&quot; Nowak (; born 5 July 1964) is a Polish professional football manager and former player. He was most recently in charge of Ekstraklasa club Jagiellonia Białystok.

Nowak played in Europe for Polish clubs such as Zawisza Bydgoszcz and Widzew Łódź, before going on to play in Turkey, Switzerland and Germany. He was voted one of the best players in the Bundesliga for the 1995–96 season while playing with 1860 Munich. He moved to the United States in 1998 and played four years with Chicago Fire. Nowak played for the Poland national football team throughout the 1990s, earning 24 caps, serving as national captain for several years, and being voted Polish Footballer of the Year in 1996.

As a coach, he is a former assistant coach of the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team under Bob Bradley, former head coach of United States U-23 men&#x27;s national soccer team, and former head coach of D.C. United and Philadelphia Union of MLS. However, his reputation in the USA took a big hit after he was accused of seriously mistreating and physically abusing players whilst being coach of the latter; an arbitration and a federal case that followed supported the charges in the accusations.

He had a brief stint whilst still a player in the United States as chairman of Górnik Konin, but was hugely unpopular and widely blamed for the club&#x27;s demise. Over a decade later, he became technical and personal advisor to the president of Caribbean Football Union and technical director and head coach to the Antigua and Barbuda Football Association.

==Club playing career==
Nowak was born in Pabianice, a small town in Poland. He signed his first professional contract at the age of 15. He played in Polish First Division for Zawisza Bydgoszcz and Widzew Lodz.

After playing at Bakirkoyspor (Turkey) and Young Boys Bern (Switzerland), Nowak moved to Germany to join Bundesliga side Dynamo Dresden. In 1994, he signed with fellow Bundesliga teams, first with 1. FC Kaiserslautern and later TSV 1860 Munich, where he played until 1998. During the 1995–96 season, Nowak was voted the Bundesliga ’s Best Playmaker, as well as the Polish Player of the Year. In the following season he advanced with 1860 Munich to UEFA Cup.

In 1998, Nowak moved to the United States and joined the Chicago Fire for the team ’s inaugural MLS season. He led the Fire to a MLS Cup (1998) and two US Open Cups (1998, 2000). He was elected three times to MLS All Star Team, three times as Chicago Fire MVP and three times as MLS Best XI including 1998 MLS Cup MVP. Nowak patrolled the Fire midfield for 114 league games, registering 26 goals and 48 assists. He played with Chicago for five seasons and retired in 2003. He was inducted as a first member of “Ring of Fire” Chicago Fire&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2004.

==International playing career==
Nowak made his debut in the Poland national team in 1990, but it was not until the middle of the decade that he began to regularly appear in the team, briefly becoming captain later on. His last match for the national team was against England played on 31 May 1997 as part of the 1998 World Cup qualifiers. Overall he played in 19 matches and scored three goals.

==Chairman career==
Whilst still playing for clubs in the United States, he became chairman of Polish club Górnik Konin in 1999. Manager Jerzy Kasalik was sacked by Nowak for unexplained reasons, despite their first place in the league, and he appointed little-known manager Jarosław Kotas. The team soon started to lose matches at an alarming rate and only just managed to escape relegation, only thanks to their good start.

The 1999–2000 season proved to be a disaster. The owners decided to rename the senior team &quot;KP Konin&quot;, whilst the reserve and junior teams used the old &quot;Aluminium Konin&quot; name. The club finished dead last. It then turned out that in the second half of the season plans to relocate the team to Bydgoszcz were put in place, and played under the name Zawisza SSA. In the end the relocation never came to fruition, but the team, which only amassed 8 points the entire season, was disbanded, with the club management and the chairman Piotr Nowak widely held responsible. The reserve team, which that same season was relegated from the Third Division, became the first team, and a season later (2000–01 season) managed to gain promotion, going straight back up.

Under the lead of Jerzy Kasalik, the team achieved a back-to-back promotion to the Second Division, restoring the club&#x27;s place after the first team was disbanded. The success however was short-lived, after in the 2003–04 season the club finished last once again. Following their relegation, many of the Aluminium players were involved in the large corruption scandal in Polish football which shook the country that season, which had a major impact on the club sponsors who all withdrew. This meant that the new club couldn&#x27;t even afford to play in the then regional Third Division, and the senior team was disbanded.

==Coaching career==
===D.C. United===
Nowak worked in the Fire front office for one season as a director of international relations and ambassador, before moving to coaching in 2004, when he was hired as head coach of D.C. United. In his first season there, he guided D.C. United to a MLS Cup Championship. In three years with United, Nowak led the club to win the Supporters ’ Shield and was elected twice as a Head Coach of MLS All Star team (2004, 2006)

===US national teams===
He moved on to become an Assistant to US Men’s National Team Head Coach Bob Bradley. Nowak also served as Head Coach of the U-23 National Team, advancing to 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. Together with Bradley, they coached over 70 players and orchestrated the USA’s championship run to a title in the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup and Mandela Cup. On 28 May 2009, Nowak resigned from his position with the US Men&#x27;s National Team.

===Philadelphia Union===
In December 2011 Nowak was named Executive Vice President / Team Manager for the Philadelphia Union. In his 2nd season as head Coach, the Union made the playoffs for the first time. As a result, Nowak was elected to be the MLS All Star Head Coach for 2012.

====Union firing for player abuse====
Nowak was fired by the Union on 13 June 2012. Major League Soccer had conducted an investigation into Novak&#x27;s mistreatment of Union players, and advised Union CEO Nick Sakiewicz to terminate Nowak’s contract. Sakiewicz when he fired Novak referred to “philosophical differences” between the Union ownership and Nowak.

Accusations of Nowak mistreating his players surfaced publicly thereafter. Among the accusations were Nowak&#x27;s: repeatedly insulting players, trivializing injuries and calling players who had concussions &quot;pussies&quot; and &quot;weak&quot;, brutal hazing of rookies, and trying to out those who took their grievances to the Players’ Union. Nowak admitted to making players run 10–12 miles in the heat while refusing them water over trainers&#x27; objections, spanking players with a sandal, and dipping his hands in ice water and paddling players. The club, in light of the evidence supporting the accusations, had in terminating Nowak said that Nowak had broken his contract, team rules, and the MLS collective bargaining agreement and was therefore fired &quot;for cause.&quot; Nowak filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against the Philadelphia Union, which he lost, as it was rejected both by an arbitrator in 2015, and then again by a Philadelphia federal district court the following year. In addition to Nowak losing his lawsuit, he was ordered to pay $454,000 to the team for its legal fees.

===Lechia Gdańsk===
In 2016, he became the manager of Lechia Gdańsk in Poland.

==Administrative and advisory career==
In February 2014, he was hired as a technical and personal advisor to the president of the Caribbean Football Union, which contains 31 countries as a part of CONCACAF. In September 2014, his duties were grown to include technical director and head coach of Antigua and Barbuda Football Association, overseeing all National Team Programs including FIFA Grass Roots and Female Programs.

==Legacy==
In 2003, Nowak was named the first member of the &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;, the highest honor the Chicago Fire bestows, and his name and number 10 are displayed at midfield at their stadium, Toyota Park. In 2005, Nowak was named to the MLS All-Time Best XI. For his contribution to promotion of Poland abroad and achievements as a coach, he received the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland in 2005.

<text>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors (LACBOS) is the five-member governing body of Los Angeles County, California, United States.

==History==

On April 1, 1850 the citizens of Los Angeles elected a three-man Court of Sessions as their first governing body. A total of 377 votes were cast in this election. In 1852, the Legislature dissolved the Court of Sessions and created a five-member Board of Supervisors. In 1913 the citizens of Los Angeles County approved a charter recommended by a board of freeholders which gave the County greater freedom to govern itself within the framework of state law.

Los Angeles County did not subdivide into separate counties or increase the number of supervisors as its population soared during the twentieth century. Today, each supervisor represents just under two million people. As a consequence, individual supervisors often exercised substantial influence over the governance of the county, and the group was collectively known as the &quot;five little kings&quot;. Efforts to increase the number of supervisors on the board all failed at the ballot box in 1962, 1976, 1992, and 2000.

With the election of Holly Mitchell to the board in 2020, the Board of Supervisors was occupied entirely by women for the first time in its history. Since the &quot;five little kings&quot; nickname was no longer appropriate, the news media began to refer to the board as the &quot;five little queens&quot;. 

In November 2024, county voters approved Measure G, which required the county to create an independent ethics commission by 2026, hold a direct election for a county executive by 2028 (in lieu of the supervisors&#x27; traditional appointment of the chief executive officer), and begin a redistricting process that would culminate in the election of a nine-member board of supervisors by 2032.

==Governance==
===Elections===
Supervisors are elected to four-year terms by a vote of Los Angeles County citizens who reside in the supervisorial district. Supervisors must reside and be voters in the district they represent. Elections for the 1st and 3rd districts coincide with California&#x27;s gubernatorial elections, while those for the 2nd, 4th and 5th districts coincide with the United States presidential election. Supervisorial terms begin the first Monday in December after the election.

===Term limits===
In March 2002, Los Angeles County voters passed Measure B to limit the supervisors to three consecutive four-year terms. If a supervisor fills a vacancy, the unexpired term counts towards the term limit if there are more than two years (half the term) left to serve. The provisions of the measure were not retroactive, meaning that the term limit clock for supervisors who were serving at the time the measure passed would start with the next election. At the time term limits were imposed, Don Knabe, Mike Antonovich, and Yvonne Brathwaite Burke’s terms were scheduled to end in 2016 (Brathwaite Burke chose to retire in 2008), while Gloria Molina and Zev Yaroslavsky served their terms until 2014.

===Board of Supervisors Chair/Mayor===

The chair or “mayor” of the Board of Supervisors serves a term of one year, meaning that a supervisor who is elected for a term on the board will get a chance to serve at least one term as chair/mayor. Upon expiration of the term, the duties of the chair/mayor are rotated among the board members by order of seniority. Along with their general responsibilities as a member of the board of supervisors, the chair/mayor has several unique duties to fulfill, including presiding over board meetings and controlling the agenda of the board. Michael D. Antonovich, during his tenure as a supervisor, called himself &quot;mayor&quot;, a practice that was not continued by subsequent supervisors.

===CEO===

Until recently, the chief executive officer was the appointed individual heading the county but had little power as supervisors retained the right to fire and hire department heads and often directly admonished department heads in public.

Based on an ordinance authored by Supervisors Knabe and Yaroslavsky that took effect in April 2007, the CEO directly oversees departments on behalf of the supervisors, although the Los Angeles County Fire Department, Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, Assessor, District Attorney, Auditor-Controller, and Executive Office of the Board of Supervisors continue to be under the direct purview of the Board of Supervisors. The change was made in response to several candidates either dropping out or declining to accept the position to replace former Chief Administrative Officer David Janssen. Antonovich was the lone supervisor to oppose the change, stating that such a move would lead to a more autocratic form of government and disenfranchise the 1.3 million who live in unincorporated areas.

However, this was rescinded in 2015 and the CEO has returned to a facilitation and coordination role between departments. Departments continue to submit recommendations and agenda items to the Board to be adopted and ratified, and the Board directly manages relations with the department heads instead of going through the CEO, as would be the case in a council-manager system prevalent in most of the county&#x27;s cities. In 2016, the CEO further recommended, and the Board approved, transferring positions considered &quot;transactional&quot; and focusing the CEO on &quot;strategic&quot; initiatives and long-term, structural issues.

As noted above, the November 2024 approval of Measure G means that by 2028, the county must hold a direct election for the first time for a county executive. This official will have broad mayor-like powers. The county executive will supervise department heads, prepare the budget, and exercise the right to veto board resolutions with which they disagree, and will no longer be appointed by or responsible to the board.

====Commissions, committees and boards====

The Executive Office of the Board of Supervisors (EO) has direct oversight of a total of 34 commissions, committees and boards:
* Audit Committee

===Board meetings===

The Board meets every Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. at the Board Hearing Room (381B) at the Kenneth Hahn Hall of Administration in Downtown Los Angeles. On Tuesdays following a Monday holiday, Board meetings begin after lunch, at 1:00 p.m. Board meetings are conducted in accordance with Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order, the Brown Act (California’s sunshine law), and the Rules of the Board. The Chief Executive Officer, the County Counsel and the Executive Officer, or their deputies, attend each Board meeting.
The regular agendas for the first, second, third and fifth Tuesdays of the month are essentially a consent calendar, that is, all items are automatically approved without discussion, unless a Supervisor or member of the public requests discussion of a specific item. The fourth Tuesday of the month is reserved for the purpose of conducting legally required public hearings, Board of Supervisors motions and department items continued from a previous meeting, have time constraints, or are critical in nature. Since Board meetings are considered Brown Act bodies, a Board agenda is published 72 hours before the Board meeting is convened.
At the start of a meeting, after an invocation and the Pledge of Allegiance, all items that do not have &quot;holds&quot; placed on them by a Supervisor or a member of the public, or are mandatory public hearings, are approved on a consent calendar. Following that, presentations of various dignitaries (e.g., local consulate officials, awards to County employees and the general public, and pets for adoption) are made. Then, items that were not approved are called in numerical order unless a supervisor wishes to take items out of order.
Members of the public are allotted three minutes to make public comment on all the agenda items that they intend to discuss. An additional three minutes are provided during general public comment on any topic within the board&#x27;s jurisdiction. Individuals must submit comment cards before the start of the meeting and wait until their item is called. On popular topics with multiple speakers, comments may be restricted to as little as one minute each, and the board has the discretion to figuratively muzzle anyone who is addressing the board in a disruptive manner.
Weekly Board meetings are broadcast live online and televised on local public television (KLCS Channel 58). Transcripts and statements of proceedings are published online. However, because some Board decisions have major implications, speakers and protesters on behalf of many causes regularly attend the meetings. The county is sued frequently by various public interest law firms and organizations on behalf of people who disagree with the Board&#x27;s decisions.

==Criticism and controversy==
===Board expansion===
&quot;Good-government&quot; advocates have long supported the idea of expanding Board membership to reduce the size of each district, and establishing an elected County Executive as a check and balance on the Board&#x27;s power, but voters have rejected such proposals every time they have appeared on the ballot. However, former supervisor Gloria Molina supported expansion of the Board (to potentially increase Hispanic representation), and former supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky supported both Board expansion and the creation of an elected County Executive, much like in King County, Washington. This would ultimately by Reintroduced by County Chair Lindsey Horvath and Supervisor Janice Hahn when the introduction of Measure G. Measure G is the measure amending the Los Angeles County Charter to create an Elected County Executive and the creation of an independent Ethics Commission along with increasing the Board of Supervisors from five to nine elected members. On November 12, 2024, LA County Voters Passed Measure G by 51% equivalent to 1,665,735 votes. This will increase the Board of Supervisors from five to nine elected members and the County Chair will now become the new County Executive with all Executive Power going to the new County Executive which will be effective after the 2028 election and the expanded council being elected in 2032. 

===Cooperation with ICE agents in jails===
From 2005 to 2015, the board had a program, known as 287(g), that allowed federal U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents into county jails to determine whether inmates were in the country legally. After 2015, the board of supervisors and the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department still cooperate with federal immigration agents.

===Interim public defender appointment===
In 2018, the board appointed Nicole Tinkham as interim public defender, despite a letter signed by 390 public defenders who were concerned that Tinkham lacked criminal law experience and the potential for a conflict of interest, given Tinkham’s prior representation of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. Prior to the appointment, the board had failed to appoint a permanent Public Defender, following the retirement of Ronald Brown. One deputy public defender testified to the board: “I feel like you are making a mockery of my life’s work … clearly somebody failed to think this through.” The American Civil Liberties Union has also criticized the appointment of Tinkham.

===Racial and political gerrymandering===
In 1991, a federal court ruled that the board denied Latinos a chance to be elected to the board. The court found that supervisors, all white, purposefully gerrymandered districts so that Latinos were a minority in each of them, a Voting Rights Act violation. As a result, Gloria Molina, the first Latina supervisor, was elected to the board of supervisors.

In 2010, Los Angeles created a nonpartisan commission to impartially redraw the districts for the board of supervisors.”

In 2016, Governor Brown, however, signed Senate Bill 958 which states that “the political party preferences of the commission members…shall be as proportional as possible to the total number of voters who are registered with each political party in the County of Los Angeles.” Some argue that the new bill infringes upon the rights of political minority parties and independent voters.

===Transparency===
In 2018, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; editorial board criticized the board for a lack of transparency and accountability. In early 2015, the board was to discuss and adopt a set of policy priorities and post them on the county&#x27;s website, together with an explanation of how they would be implemented and a schedule of hearings so the public could weigh in. The &quot;Times&quot; criticized the board for not following through on that promise.

==Current Supervisors==

Members of the Board are officially nonpartisan, and are elected by constituents of their respective districts. As of 2022, they are:

== Current County Chair &amp; Chair Pro Tem ==
Current County Chair is Kathryn Barger &amp; Current County Chair Pro Tem is Hilda Solis As of 2024.

==Supervisorial districts==
Los Angeles County is divided into 5 supervisorial districts (SDs), with each Supervisor representing a district of approximately 2 million people.

<text>.th is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Thailand.

It is administered by T.H.NIC Co., Ltd. (THNIC), the corporate entity of Thai Network Information Center Foundation.

==Registration==
Registration of a .co.th domain name is a complicated procedure; for this reason most Thai websites prefer to use a .com name. In order to register a .co.th domain name the registrar in Thailand requires copies of company documents in the same name as the required domain name, so for example if an entity required acme.co.th the entity would need to have a registered company called Acme Co., Ltd.

A company can only register a single .co.th domain with the company name or initial name of company, and/or one .co.th domain name per trademark.

In 2018, the foundation advance to the registration for authentic using of persons (natural persons and juristic persons); therefore, the foundation reserves the right to consider and decide the number of domain names of each person on a case-by-case basis. The person who registered more than one domain name from all categories must comply with the following conditions:

*All domain name registrations must comply with the criteria of domain naming and conditions as provided specified policy by categories of domain name.
*The registration of domain names shall be effected in good faith by a holder of the domain name and a contact person who having a residential address or an office address in Thailand which can be contacted by THNIC.
*In the case THNIC detects any unusual act in domain name registration, specifically, registration of more than one domain name, THNIC reserves the right to refuse the request or revoke the domain name immediately.

==Second-level domains==
THNIC admits regular .th registration for third-level domain under seven groups of predefined second-level domains:

In 2014 THNIC opens registration for second-level domain name. They are typically available for new registration in three rounds annually. Each domain name must be the English name of an organization, trademark or natural person, except in the case of a project name. Each domain is subjected to a 10,000 baht application fee and 100,000 baht annual fee for the first 10 years.

==Second top domain==

In 2010 a new top domain was registered and introduced for Thailand, intended for domain names in the local language. This top domain is . As of 2011, thousands of sites with this domain are active.

It appears that the Thai second-level domains are assigned directly to sites with English domain names. Other groups of domains must use third-level domains, as in the table above.

<doc id="1007441" wikidata="Q131603" url="?curid=1007441" title="TSV 1860 Munich">
<text>, commonly known as TSV 1860 München (; &quot;sechzig&quot; locally ; lettered as ) or 1860 Munich, is a sports club based in Munich. The club&#x27;s football team currently plays in the 3. Liga, the third tier of German football.

1860 Munich was one of the founding members of the Bundesliga in 1963, becoming West German champions in 1966, and played a total of 20 seasons in the top flight. Since their relegation from the 2. Bundesliga, 1860 Munich play their home games at the Grünwalder Stadion.

==History==
===Origins of the club===
The roots of the TSV&#x27;s founding as a physical fitness and gymnastics association go back to a meeting held 15 July 1848 in a local pub, Buttlesche Brauerei zum Bayerischen Löwen. It was a time of revolutionary foment due to the 1848 Revolutions, and the club was banned in 1849 by the Bavarian monarchy for &quot;republican activities&quot;. The club was formally reestablished on 17 May 1860 and after mergers with a number of other local associations in 1862 was known as Turnverein München. A football department was created on 6 March 1899 and played its first matches against other squads three years later. On 13 March 1880 the club officially adopted the lion on their crest and the nickname &quot;Die Löwen&quot; (the Lions).

===1900–1945===
In 1919 was renamed TSV München 1860. By the mid-1920s, they were playing football in the country&#x27;s upper leagues, like the Bezirksliga Bayern, making a national semi-final appearance in 1927. &quot;Die Löwen&quot; challenged for the championship in 1931, but lost a 3–2 decider to Hertha BSC. Two years later, they made another semi-final appearance which they lost to Schalke 04.

In 1933, German football was re-organized under the Third Reich into 16 top-flight divisions known as Gauligen. TSV joined the Gauliga Bayern where they earned second-place finishes in 1934, 1938, and 1939 before finally winning a division championship in 1941. Their subsequent play-off appearance saw them finish second in their pool to finalist Rapid Wien. The following season they did not advance to the national play-off rounds, but did earn their first major honours by defeating Schalke 04 to win the &quot;Tschammerpokal&quot;, known today as the DFB-Pokal. TSV returned to the national play-offs again in 1943, progressing to the quarter-finals.

===Post war===
After World War II, 1860 played in the top flight Oberliga Süd as a mid-table side, but were relegated in 1955–56 after finishing last. 1860 returned to the Oberliga Süd in 1957-58 where they stayed until winning the league championship in 1963. By becoming champions, 1860 gained automatic entry into Germany&#x27;s new professional league, the Bundesliga, ahead of rivals Bayern Munich, who would have to wait two seasons for their own top flight debut since the German Football Association (DFB) did not want two teams from the same city in the new league. Through the mid-1960s, 1860 won their second DFB-Pokal in 1964 and played the 1965 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final against West Ham United – losing 2–0. In 1966, they came away as Bundesliga champions and qualified for the 1966–67 European Cup, but lost 3–2 on aggregate against Real Madrid in the second round. On 3 June 1967, they finished as runner-up in the Bundesliga.

===The 1970s, 1980s and 1990s===
Those performances were followed by poor showings in three consecutive seasons leading to relegation in 1970 to the Regionalliga Süd (II). It took 1860 seven years to make their way back to the first division, through a three-game play-off contest with Arminia Bielefeld, only to be immediately relegated again. One year later they were back, this time for a two-year stay, then in 1982 they were relegated once again, and then forced into the tier III Amateur Oberliga Bayern when financial problems led to the club being denied a licence.

The club was promoted back to the Bundesliga for the 1994-95 season, going on to finish 14th, narrowly missing out on relegation. President Karl-Heinz Wildmoser and manager Werner Lorant, however, made several purchases to improve the team&#x27;s performances, including striker Olaf Bodden, winger Harald Cerny, attacking midfielder Daniel Borimirov, playmaker Peter Nowak and defensive stoppers Miroslav Stević, Jens Jeremies and Manfred Schwabl. Other players who joined 1860&#x27;s squad during this time included like Abedi Pele, Thomas Häßler and Davor Šuker.

===2000s===
Under the leadership of Wildmoser and Lorant, the combination of proven veterans and young talent helped the club avoid relegation and become a decent mid-table side. In 2000, 1860 finished fourth in the Bundesliga and as a result played in the UEFA Champions League Third qualifying round, where they faced Leeds United. A 3–1 aggregate defeat, however, saw 1860 play in the UEFA Cup that season, advancing to the third round, where they were eliminated by Parma. After nine years at 1860, Lorant was dismissed by the club following a 1–5 derby defeat to Bayern Munich on 13 October 2001.

After a decade in the top division, 1860 finished the 2003–04 season in 17th-place that returned the club to the 2. Bundesliga. Wildmoser made the controversial decision to groundshare with rivals Bayern Munich in the Allianz Arena, a move that outraged fans and led to accusations of a sell-out. His downfall came when he and his son Karl-Heinz Wildmoser Jr. were caught in a bribery scandal around the awarding procedure for the contract to build the stadium.

In addition to closely being relegated to the Regionalliga Süd (III) in the 2005–06 season, 1860 experienced severe financial difficulties. Stadium partner Bayern Munich bought out TSV&#x27;s 50% interest in the Allianz Arena in late April 2006 for €11 million, providing the club with some immediate financial relief. Following this move, the DFB was satisfied with the financial health of the club and duly issued 1860 a licence to play in the 2. Bundesliga for the 2006–07 season.

TSV hired several new managers during the club&#x27;s time in 2. Bundesliga period. The first was Rudi Bommer, followed by Reiner Maurer, Walter Schachner, Marco Kurz and Uwe Wolf. Also, former Germany national team player Stefan Reuter as a general manager. None of the new managers, however, could lead the squad back to the top-flight Bundesliga. Ewald Lienen was manager of 1860 from 13 May 2009 to the end of the 2009–10 season.

===2010–present===
Reiner Maurer was hired as manager of 1860 at the start of the 2010–11 season.

1860 came close to insolvency for a second time in five years in 2011 when it needed €8 million to survive. Help was offered to the club by local rival Bayern Munich, to the disgust of the supporters of each club, since Bayern was to lose €50 million in future stadium rent if the club defaulted on its rental contract obligations until 2025. Eventually, the club was rescued by Jordanian investor Hasan Abdullah Ismaik, who, for €18 million, purchased 60% of the club&#x27;s professional team&#x27;s operating company, 1860 GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA&#x27;. However his voting rights being restricted to 49% due to regulations governing German football, which is based around membership-led clubs and not entrepreneurial. H. I. Squared International, a company controlled by Ismaik, took over the marketing of the club from IMG.

The 2014–15 season saw the club finish 16th in the 2. Bundesliga. This meant a place in the relegation play-offs against Holstein Kiel, during which it retained its league place with a 2–1 home win after a 0–0 draw in the first leg. 1860 survived courtesy of an injury time goal by defender Kai Bülow in front of 57,000 spectators in Munich.

In 2016–17, the team finished 16th in the 2. Bundesliga after a 1–2 defeat against 1. FC Heidenheim in the last game of the season. They played 1–1 and 0–2 respectively in the following relegation play-off against Jahn Regensburg and were therefore officially relegated. Managing director Ian Ayre and President Peter Cassalette resigned from their positions the following day. On 2 June 2017, it was announced that 1860 were unable to obtain a 3. Liga licence for the 2017–18 season as a result of investor Hassan Ismaik&#x27;s unwillingness to pay the necessary fees. As a result, the club was relegated to the Regionalliga Bayern for the 2017–18 season.

They spent only one season in the Regionalliga as they won the league in 2017–18, thus securing their return to the 3. Liga. Their first season back in the third league saw them finish 12th. The team managed to reach 4th place in the 2020–21 and 2021–22 season, one position away from promotion play-offs spot. The team also qualified for the 2021–22 DFB-Pokal and 2022–23 DFB-Pokal competitions as a result of the 4th-place finishes.

==Reserve team==

The TSV 1860 Munich second team, (previously, until 2005, the TSV 1860 Munich Amateure), have been historically quite successful at the Bavarian level.

The second team struggled during the club&#x27;s years outside professional football, but rose through the ranks again after the club&#x27;s revival in the early 1990s and returned to the Bayernliga in 1996, winning the title in its first season there and promotion to the third-tier Regionalliga Süd. The team was relegated to the Bayernliga in 2001, and returned to the Regionalliga Süd in 2004. TSV 1860 Munich II missed out on 3. Liga qualification in the 2007–08 season, and again in the 2012–13 season when it won the newly formed Regionalliga Bayern but lost to SV Elversberg in the promotion round. Because the first team was relegated to Regionalliga Bayern for the 2017–18 season, the reserve team was relegated to the fifth-tier Bayernliga Süd.

The club is the only one in Bavaria to have won the Bayernliga with its first and second team.

==Ground==


Originally, 1860 Munich played their home matches in the Stadion an der Grünwalderstraße (commonly known as &quot;Sechzgerstadion&quot;, which means &quot;60er Stadium&quot;). They shared this venue, built in 1911, with city rivals Bayern Munich between 1925 and 1972. Both clubs then moved to the new Olympiastadion built for the 1972 Olympic Games. 1860 Munich moved back to the old ground several times from 1972 on, with the years between 1982 and 1995 being the longest period. In the 2004–05 season, 1860 again played at Sechzger, as the Allianz Arena was being readied.

From 2005 to 2017, 1860 Munich played their home matches in the Allianz Arena, which they shared—and until 2006 co-owned—with Bayern Munich. The arena&#x27;s usual peach lighting was changed to 1860&#x27;s blue when the team played. The club&#x27;s inaugural game at the Allianz Arena was a friendly played against 1. FC Nürnberg on 30 May 2005. On 28 April 2006, 1860 sold its 50% share to Bayern Munich to help resolve a serious financial crisis that saw 1860 facing bankruptcy. On 12 July 2017, Bayern Munich terminated 1860 Munich&#x27;s rental agreement for Allianz Arena. The club returned to their old stadium, the Grünwalder Stadion.

<text>CANO, a Canadian progressive rock band of the 1970s and 1980s, was the most successful popular musical group in Franco-Ontarian history.

==Origins==
CANO evolved out of the &quot;Coopérative des artistes du Nouvel-Ontario&quot; (&quot;Artists&#x27; Cooperative of Northern Ontario&quot;), an artists&#x27; collective established in Sudbury, Ontario, in 1970. The cooperative was responsible for developing many of the current cultural institutions of the city&#x27;s Franco-Ontarian community. The Galerie du Nouvel-Ontario, Prise de Parole publishing house, Théâtre du Nouvel-Ontario, La Nuit sur l&#x27;étang and CANO-Musique, as the band was then called, all evolved out of projects launched by artists associated with the cooperative.

While based in Sudbury, the cooperative bought an abandoned 320-acre farm in Earlton that became an artists&#x27; haven and buffalo ranch.

==Musical group==
The group consisted of singer-guitarists André Paiement and Rachel Paiement, violinist Wasyl Kohut, guitarists Marcel Aymar and David Burt, pianist Michel Kendel, bassist John Doerr and drummer Michel Dasti. The band was formed in the fall of 1975, and performed its first concert on December 1 at La Slague in Sudbury.

The band also recorded its debut album, &quot;Tous dans l&#x27;même bateau,&quot; released in 1976. The production studio was a converted building on the Paiements&#x27; farm near Sturgeon Falls.

The band performed both traditional French folk songs and original material by Aymar, the Paiements and Robert Dickson. With its third album, &quot;Eclipse&quot;, CANO began performing English-language songs as well; the fourth album, &quot;Rendezvous&quot;, consisted predominantly of English songs as the band made a bid for success in the larger English-language market. The band was most successful on francophone pop charts in Quebec and France, but had notable hits in English Canada as well. &quot;Eclipse&quot; and &quot;Rendezvous&quot;, notably, both charted on CFNY, while the singles &quot;Rebound&quot; and &quot;Carrie&quot; reached No. 97 and No. 78 respectively on the &quot;RPM&quot; charts in 1979 and 1980.
In 1978, the band was shaken by the suicide of André Paiement.

The following year, the band was profiled in the National Film Board documentary, &quot;CANO, Notes on a Collective Experience.&quot;

&quot;Spirit of the North&quot;, a compilation issued in 1980, traced CANO&#x27;s integration of pop, rock and jazz influences into what was originally a folk-based style. In the same year, some of the band&#x27;s music appeared in the documentary film, &quot;A Wives&#x27; Tale (Une histoire de femmes)&quot;, on the 1978 Inco strike in Sudbury.

Following the departure of Rachel Paiement in 1980, the band released the album, &quot;Camouflage,&quot; under the band name Masque; it was the band&#x27;s only fully English-language album. Kohut died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1981, just weeks after the album&#x27;s release, and was replaced by Ben Mink. By this time, the band was based in Toronto.

CITY-TV used a track by the band as its theme song for &quot;Great Movies&quot; in the 1980s, and the band also recorded music for several National Film Board productions.

In 1984, Aymar, Burt, Mink, Mary Lu Zahalan and Rob Yale recorded the band&#x27;s final album, &quot;Visible&quot;, and played concerts in Ontario, Quebec, and Japan before disbanding.

==Revival==
In 2003, Universal Music Canada released a CANO greatest hits compilation as part of its &quot;20th Century Masters&quot; series.

The band released &quot;Rendezvous&quot; on the iTunes platform in summer 2008 and &quot;Eclipse&quot; in spring 2009.

CANO gave a reunion show at the 2010 &quot;La Nuit sur l&#x27;étang&quot; festival, with Monique Paiement, André and Rachel&#x27;s younger sister, on lead vocals.

Celebrating 35 years of CANO in 2011, Aymar, Burt, Doerr, Dasti and Kendel reunited again in June 2011 for a series of concerts in Ottawa, North Bay, Sturgeon Falls and Kapuskasing, with Michel Bénac of Swing, Monique Paiement, Andrea Lindsay and Stéphane Paquette as supporting musicians. The Ottawa concert was recorded for broadcast on TFO.

==Legacy==
CANO was involved in the creation of two music festivals in Sudbury, the bilingual folk festival Northern Lights Festival Boréal and the Franco-Ontarian cultural festival La Nuit sur l&#x27;étang. Both festivals continue to operate today.

In 2021, two classic CANO songs from the band&#x27;s first album, André Paiement&#x27;s &quot;Dimanche après-midi&quot; and Marcel Aymar&#x27;s &quot;Baie Sainte-Marie,&quot; were inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame.

<text>Pterocles is a genus of near passerine birds in the sandgrouse family. It includes all the species in the family except for two central Asian species in &quot;Syrrhaptes&quot;.

These sandgrouse have small, pigeon-like heads and necks, but sturdy compact bodies. They have long pointed wings and sometimes tails. Their legs are feathered down to the toes, but unlike species of the genus &quot;Syrrhaptes&quot; the toes are not feathered.

&quot;Pterocles&quot; species have a fast direct flight, and flocks fly to watering holes at dawn and dusk.

Two to three eggs are laid directly on the ground. They are buff or greenish with cryptic markings. All species are resident.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Pterocles&quot; was introduced in 1815 by the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck. The type species was subsequently designated by the English zoologist George Robert Gray as the pin-tailed sandgrouse. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;pteron&quot; meaning &quot;wing&quot; with &quot;-klēs&quot; meaning &quot;notable&quot; or &quot;splendid&quot;.

==Species==
The genus contains 14 extant species:

A fossil species, &quot;Pterocles bosporanus&quot;, is known from the early Pleistocene of Crimea.

<text>HMS &quot;Sidon&quot; was a first-class paddle frigate designed by Sir Charles Napier. Her name commemorated his attack on the port of Sidon in 1840 in the Syrian War. Her keel was laid down on 26 May 1845 at Deptford Dockyard, and she was launched on 26 May 1846. She had a fairly short career for a warship, but it included the rescue of the crew of the sinking P&amp;O ship &quot;Ariel&quot; on 28 May 1848, and a trip up the Nile that same year, when her passengers included the explorer and botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker.
&quot;Sidon&quot; served in the Black Sea in the Crimean War, 1854–55 under the command of Captain George Goldsmith. In April 1854, in company with HMS &quot;Firebrand&quot; (Captain William Houston Stewart), she blockaded the coast from Kavarna to the mouths of the River Danube. In September, in the Allied invasion of the Crimea, she was assigned to escorting the French troop transports, and assisted the French line-of-battleship &quot;Algiers&quot;, which had gone aground in Eupatoria Bay. She was then sent to monitor Russian movements around Odessa, and on 4 October attacked a marching column of 12,000 men on their way to the Crimea. On this occasion Russian rocket hit her funnel.
On 11 June 1860, &quot;Sidon&quot; ran aground at &quot;Pomong Harbour&quot;, Cape Colony. Repairs cost £678. She returned to the east coast of Africa and in 1861 destroyed the Royal Navy tender &quot;Enchantress&quot;, which had wrecked on 20 February 1861 on a reef off Mayotte in the Mozambique Channel.

==Fate==
&quot;Sidon&quot; was sold for breaking up on 15 July 1864 to Castle and Beech.

<text>HMS &quot;Sidon&quot; was a submarine of the Royal Navy, launched in September 1944, one of the third group of S class built by Cammell Laird &amp; Co Limited, Birkenhead, named after the naval bombardment of Sidon in 1840. In 1953 she took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.
An explosion caused by a faulty torpedo sank her in Portland Harbour with the loss of 13 lives in 1955.

==Accident==
On the morning of 16 June 1955, &quot;Sidon&quot; was moored alongside the depot ship in Portland Harbour. Two Mark 12 high test peroxide-powered torpedoes, code-named &quot;Fancy&quot;, had been loaded aboard for testing. Fifty-six officers and crewmen were aboard.

At 08:25, an explosion in one of the &quot;Fancy&quot; torpedoes (but not the warhead) burst the number-three torpedo tube into which it had been loaded and ruptured the two forward-most watertight bulkheads. Fire, toxic gases, and smoke accompanied the blast. Twelve men in the forward compartments died instantly and seven others were seriously injured.

The submarine started to settle by the bow with a list to starboard, and her commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Verry, ordered the submarine evacuated from the engine room and aft escape hatches. Thanks to a rescue party from &quot;Maidstone&quot;, everyone not immediately killed escaped, except &quot;Maidstone&quot;″s medical officer, Temporary Surgeon Lieutenant Charles Eric Rhodes. He had gone aboard with the rescue party, assisted several survivors, and suffocated because he was using a DSEA set that he had not been trained to use. At about 08:50 &quot;Sidon&quot; sank to the bottom of the harbour. On 1 November 1955 Rhodes was posthumously awarded the Albert Medal for putting his life in danger to save others.

One week later the wreck was raised and towed into a causeway on Chesil Beach. The bodies of the 13 casualties were removed and buried with full honours in the Portland Royal Naval Cemetery overlooking the harbour.
A court of inquiry cleared anyone aboard &quot;Sidon&quot; for the loss of the boat. The direct cause of the accident was determined to have been malfunctioning of the &quot;Fancy&quot; torpedo. A torpedo being readied for the morning test shot had begun a &quot;hot-run&quot; - its engine had started while it was still inside the submarine and was over-speeding, creating very high pressures in its fuel system. The &quot;Fancy&quot; torpedo used high test peroxide (HTP) as an oxidizer. When an oxidizer line burst, HTP sprayed onto the copper fittings inside the torpedo, decomposing into oxygen and steam. The torpedo&#x27;s warhead did not detonate, but its hull burst violently, rupturing the torpedo tube and causing the flooding that destroyed the boat. The torpedo programme was terminated and the torpedoes taken out of use by 1959.

&quot;Sidon&quot; was refloated, then sunk to act as an ASDIC target on 14 June 1957 at , off the coast of Chickerell in Dorset.

On the 50th anniversary of the &quot;Sidon&quot; accident, 16 June 2005, the Dorset Branch of the Submariners Association erected a Memorial Stone to those who died. This is situated adjacent to the Portland Cenotaph at Portland, opposite the Portland Heights Hotel. A number of survivors and relatives of those who died in the accident attended the ceremony.

&quot;Sidon&quot;″s wreck was purchased from the Ministry of Defence by the company Deepquest Sub Sea in 2000. In 2002 the company announced that it intended to raise the wreck. This had not occurred as of 2021.

<text>Salmo is a genus of ray-finned fish from the subfamily Salmoninae of family Salmonidae, and is part of the tribe Salmonini along with the sister genera &quot;Salvelinus&quot; and &quot;Salvethymus&quot;. Almost all &quot;Salmo&quot; species are native only in the Old World (including most of Europe, coastal North Africa and part of West Asia around the Black Sea), the only exception being the Atlantic salmon (&quot;Salmo salar&quot;), which is also naturally found across the North Atlantic in eastern North America.

The number of distinct species and subspecies in &quot;Salmo&quot; is a debated issue. The Atlantic salmon and brown trout (&quot;Salmo trutta&quot;) are widespread species and have been introduced worldwide as farmed food fish or recreational game fish, while most of the other &quot;Salmo&quot; species are narrowly distributed forms endemic to single watersheds.

The name &quot;Salmo&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;salmō&quot;, meaning salmon. The vast majority of the &quot;Salmo&quot; species are actually trout, except the Atlantic salmon, which along with six Pacific species from the genus &quot;Oncorhynchus&quot; (also from the subfamily Salmoninae, but of a different tribe) constitute the only seven officially recognized species of salmon.

The only known fossil species is &quot;Salmo immigratus&quot; from the Miocene of Croatia. This species was initially dated to the Late Miocene, though more recent analyses suggest that it may date to the Middle Miocene, or the regional Sarmatian stage.

<text>Boggabri ( ) is a small town in north-eastern New South Wales, Australia. It is part of Narrabri Shire and lies between Gunnedah and Narrabri on the Kamilaroi Highway. At the , the town had a population of 885 people.

== History ==
The original town site was south and settled in the 1830s but was relocated after a flood washed it away in the 1850s. &quot;Boggabri&quot; comes from Gamilaraay &quot;bagaaybaraay&quot;, literally &quot;having creeks&quot;. It is likely a reference to the Namoi River, which passes through Boggabri.

It was officially proclaimed a town in 1862; being named after an Aboriginal Chief.

== Attractions ==
Boggabri&#x27;s main tourist attraction is Gin&#x27;s Leap. Its name derives from the story of an Aboriginal girl who was promised to an elder of her tribe, the Kamilaroi, and ran away with a young man from a neighbouring tribe. The couple were pursued and, seeing no escape, jumped from the cliff to their deaths.

Dripping Rock is another natural attraction featuring water that seeps through sedimentary rock and drips down a high wall. The water cascades down into a rock pool below after good rain creating a local waterfall.

Thunder-bolts Cave is another attraction.

== Education ==
There are two primary schools in Boggabri: Boggabri Public School and Sacred Heart Primary School.

== Medical Services ==
The town is also home to the Boggabri John Prior Health Service and Prior House Frail Aged Care Home, both named after resident Dr John Prior OAM (1922–2014), who served as the community&#x27;s sole doctor for half a century and is believed to be New South Wales&#x27; longest serving GP.

== Transport ==
Boggabri railway station is situated on the Mungindi line, 515 km from Sydney. The station opened in 1882 consists of a station building on a single side platform, a passing loop and small goods yard. Currently a single daily Xplorer diesel railmotor operating between Sydney and Moree serves the station.

== Notable Alumni ==
The churchman Roland St John MBE and his barrister brother Edward St John QC MP were born at Boggabri when their father was Anglican rector there.

The local rugby league team is the Boggabri Kangaroos, who play in the Group 4 Rugby League. In 1946, Boggabri&#x27;s rugby league club player, Trevor Eather, was selected to play for the Australian national team. 

Mahla Pearlman AO (2 June 1937 – 2 December 2011) was the first woman to become chief judge of any jurisdiction within the NSW legal system. She was born at Boggabri to a local farming family, the Pearlmans. Her grandfather Abraham Pearlman had come to Boggabri as a shopkeeper, becoming a farmer in 1905 on the acquisition of the property Herzlton.

Rugby Union player Steve Devine – born in Boggabri in 1976 – later moved to New Zealand, and briefly played for the All Blacks.

<doc id="1007457" wikidata="Q2443822" url="?curid=1007457" title="Varus deformity">
<text>A varus deformity is an excessive inward angulation (medial angulation, that is, towards the body&#x27;s midline) of the distal segment of a bone or joint. The opposite of varus is called valgus.

The terms varus and valgus always refer to the direction that the distal segment of the joint points.

For example, in a valgus deformity of the knee, the distal part of the leg below the knee is deviated &quot;outward, in relation to the femur,&quot; resulting in a &quot;knock-kneed&quot; appearance. Conversely, a &quot;varus&quot; deformity at the knee results in a &quot;bowlegged&quot; with the distal part of the leg deviated &quot;inward, in relation to the femur&quot;. However, in relation to the mid-line of the body, the knee joint is deviated towards the mid-line.

==Terminology==
The terminology is made confusing by the etymology of these words. 
* The terms &quot;varus&quot; and &quot;valgus&quot; are both Latin, but confusingly, their Latin meanings conflict with their current usage. In current usage, as noted above, a varus deformity of the knee describes bowed legs, but in the original Latin, &quot;varus&quot; meant &quot;knock-kneed.&quot; Similarly, while a valgus deformity of the knee would currently describe knocked knees, the original Latin meaning was &quot;bow-legged&quot;
* Application of these words in adjectival form to other portions of the body by the medical community has resulted in their definitions changing so that they now refer to the angle of the distal segment (i.e. valgus impaction in a Garden I femoral neck fracture).
* It is correct for a knock-kneed deformity to be called both a &quot;varus&quot; deformity at the hip (&quot;coxa vara&quot;) and a &quot;valgus&quot; deformity at the knee (&quot;genu valgum&quot;); although the common terminology is to simply refer to it as a &quot;valgus&quot; knee.

When the terminology refers to a bone rather than a joint, the distal segment of the bone is being described. Thus, a varus deformity of the tibia (i.e. a mid-shaft tibial fracture with varus deformity) refers to the distal segment in a varus alignment compared to the proximal segment.

==Examples==
* Hip: &quot;coxa vara&quot; — the angle between the head and the shaft of the femur is reduced, resulting in a limp.
* Knee: &quot;genu varum&quot; (from Latin &quot;genu&quot; = knee) — the tibia is turned inward in relation to the femur, resulting in a bowlegged deformity.
* Ankle: &quot;talipes varus&quot; (from Latin &quot;talus&quot; = ankle and &quot;pes&quot; = foot). A notable subtype is clubfoot or &quot;talipes equinovarus&quot;, which is where one or both feet are rotated inwards and downwards.
* Toe: &quot;hallux varus&quot; (Latin &quot;hallux&quot; = big toe) — inward deviation of the big toe away from the second toe.
* Elbows: &quot;cubitus varus&quot; (Latin &quot;cubitus&quot; = elbow) — turned inward elbows
