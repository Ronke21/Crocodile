<text>The human history of the west coast of North America is believed to stretch back to the arrival of the earliest people over the Bering Strait, or alternately along the ice free coastal islands of British Columbia. This was followed by the development of significant pre-Columbian cultures and population densities and later arrival of the European explorers and colonization of the coast. The west coast of North America today is home to some of the largest and most important companies in the world, as well as being a center of world culture.

==Geography==
As used in this article, the term &quot;west coast of North America&quot; means a contiguous region of that continent bordering the Pacific Ocean: all or parts of the U.S. states of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and California; all or parts of British Columbia and the Yukon in Canada; all or part of the Mexican states of Baja California, Baja California Sur, Sonora, Sinaloa, Nayarit, Jalisco, Colima, Michoacán, Guerrero, Oaxaca and Chiapas; and the Central American countries of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama. The eastern islands of the Pacific Ocean off the west coast, such as the coastal islands of the Californias, are also important.

==First people==

The west coast of North America likely saw the first sustained arrival of people to the continent. Although there are other theories, most scientists believe that the first significant groups of people came from Asia, through today&#x27;s Bering Strait area, then through modern Alaska, and from there spread throughout North America and to South America.

Although the cultures on the west coast of today&#x27;s Canada and United States are not known to have developed substantial urban centers and sophisticated writing or scientific systems, it is likely that, before European contact, the population density was significantly higher than in the rest of the northern part of the continent. For example, it has been estimated that in 1492, one-third of all Native Americans in the United States were living in what is now California.

The Channel Islands of California provide the earliest evidence for human seafaring in the Americas. They are now known to have been settled by maritime Paleo-Indian peoples at least 13,000 years ago. The Arlington Springs Man was discovered in 1960 at Arlington Springs on Santa Rosa Island (California). The remains were dated to 13,000 years BP.

The Cedros Island off the coast of Baja California, Mexico, had a human presence already about 11,000 years ago. The earliest fishhooks in the Americas were found here, dating to that time. These ancient fisher folk were catching deepwater fish species, indicating that they were using boats.

These island peoples maintained trading connections with the mainland for thousands of years.

The oldest dated human remains were found in the Los Angeles area. Partial remains of a skeleton referred to as &quot;Los Angeles Man&quot; were recovered from the ancient channel of the Los Angeles river in the Baldwin Hills area. The ‘Los Angeles Man’ appeared to be contemporaneous with the partially preserved remains of an Imperial mammoth. The remains were located some 370 meters apart; they revealed a similar fluorine content profile, and were recovered within the same geological unit.

It was years later that the ‘Los Angeles Man’ remains were finally dated, but by then the mammoth remains were not available for comparative study, and only the cranium of ‘Los Angeles Man’ remained available for dating. The UCLA radiocarbon laboratory indicated the sample age to be more than 23,600 old (UCLA sample #1430), but the sample, obtained from cranial bone collagen, was too small to produce a confident date.

Along the middle reaches of Marsh Creek near the modern day city of Brentwood lies land that was once occupied by the Bay Miwok speaking peoples more specifically the Volvon tribelet. Radiocarbon dates at the burial site estimate that the individuals were interred around 5,000 to 3,000 BP. In the earliest periods of the Black Marsh occupation, individuals were buried in an extended position facing north if on the east side of the site and south if on the west side. Observations by researchers suggest that individuals were not interred based on their sex or age, leading some archaeologists to assume a more culturally significant reason.

==Larger human settlements==
In the western half of Mesoamerica (that is, western portions of today&#x27;s Mexico and northern Central America), some larger settlements appeared around 2000 BCE. A succession of cultures started with the very early &quot;Capacha&quot; culture, which appeared on the Pacific coast of modern Mexico about 1450 BC and spread into the interior. The following cultures developed into &quot;high civilizations&quot; in Mesoamerica, with extensive urban areas, writing, astronomy and fine arts:
*Olmec (beginning about 1150 BC)
*Mixtec (beginning perhaps 1000 BC)
*Maya (settled villages along the Pacific coast appear from 1800 BC, and ceremonial architecture by approximately 1000 BC) and
*Aztec (from the 14th century AD)

Farther south, Panama was home to some of the earliest pottery-making, such as the Monagrillo culture dating to about 2500–1700 BC; this culture evolved into significant populations best known for spectacular burial sites (dating to c. 500–900 AD) and polychrome pottery of the Coclé style.

Each of these cultures rose, flourished, and was then conquered by a more militarily developed culture. While not all of these civilizations had large settlements along the coast of the Pacific Ocean, their influence extended to the Pacific coast.

Regional communications in ancient Mesoamerica—and especially along the west coast—have been the subject of considerable research. There is evidence of trade routes starting as far north as the Mexico Central Plateau, and going down to the Pacific coast. These trade routes and cultural contacts then went on as far as Central America. These networks operated along the west coast with various interruptions from pre-Olmec times and up to the Late Classical Period (600–900 CE).

== European arrival (1513–1750) ==
In 1513, Spanish explorers were the first Europeans to reach the west coast of North America, on the Pacific coast of the Panama isthmus. From the point of view of European powers in the age of sailing ships, the west coast of North America was among the most distant places in the world. The arduous journey around Cape Horn at the tip of South America and then north meant nine to twelve months of dangerous sailing. These practical difficulties discouraged all but the Spanish Empire from making regular visits and establishing settlements and ports until the second half of the 18th century—some 200 years after Europeans first reached the east coast of North America.

===Spanish explorers and conquistadors===
Explorers flying the flag of Spain reached the New World beginning in 1492 with the discovery of the Americas by Christopher Columbus. Spanish expeditions colonized and explored vast areas in North and South America following the grants of the Pope (contained in the 1493 papal bull Inter caetera) and rights contained in the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas and 1529 Treaty of Zaragoza. These formal acts gave Spain the exclusive rights to colonize the entire Western Hemisphere (excluding eastern Brazil), including all of the west coast of North America. The first European expedition to actually reach the west coast was led by the Spaniard Vasco Núñez de Balboa, who reached the Pacific coast of Panama in 1513. In an act of enduring historical importance, Balboa claimed the Pacific Ocean for the Spanish Crown, as well as all adjoining land and islands. This act gave Spain exclusive sovereignty and navigation rights over the entire west coast of North America.

The commonly held belief at the time was that the west coast of North America was in modest sailing distance of Asia to the west, or the two might actually physically connect. To the north was imagined a narrow Northwest Passage, known as the Strait of Anián, which some believed reached the Pacific Ocean at 42° north latitude (the latitude of today&#x27;s border between Oregon and California) and connected to the Atlantic Ocean at the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Confirmation of the land connection, and discovery of this Strait of Anián, were key elements in Spain&#x27;s efforts to establish direct trade routes with China and other countries in Asia. See Early knowledge of the Pacific Northwest.

The Pacific Coast of Mexico and Central America was not especially conducive to economic development during this era. The northern Mexican coast (including the Baja California Peninsula) was generally too dry for substantial agriculture or ranching that would support settlements. South of the deserts, the jungles of the Pacific Coast in Mexico and Central America, and the tropical diseases found there, were major obstacles to large-scale development.

Notable exceptions were the development of important Spanish ports at Puerto de Navidad and Acapulco in today&#x27;s Mexico. While Navidad faded in importance, Acapulco became the primary port of the Spanish Empire on the west coast of North America, and was used as a base for exploratory expeditions north and trade routes with the Far East.

From 1533–1535, Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés personally sponsored and financed exploratory sailing voyages north from Acapulco, in a search for legendary riches reported to be in the site of today&#x27;s California. In the third of these voyages, Cortés accompanied the voyage, and likely reached the site of today&#x27;s La Paz on the Baja California peninsula.

In 1539, another voyage financed and sponsored by Cortés, and led by Francisco de Ulloa, embarked on an expedition in three small vessels, sailing north from Acapulco to explore the Pacific Coast, and to seek the Strait of Anián. The expedition sailed northwards along the west coast of the Mexican mainland, and reached the Gulf of California six weeks later. Ulloa named the Gulf the &quot;Sea of Cortés&quot; in honor of his patron. When one of his ships was lost in a storm, Ulloa paused to repair the other two ships, and then resumed his voyage, eventually reaching the northern end of the Gulf. Unable to find the Strait of Anián, Ulloa turned south and sailed along the eastern coast of the Baja California peninsula, landing at the Bay of La Paz. After taking on supplies of wood and water, Ulloa rounded the tip of the peninsula with great difficulty and sailed northward along the western shore of the peninsula, in the Pacific Ocean. The progress of his small ships was hampered by the fierce winds and high seas he encountered, eventually forcing him to turn back to Acapulco. The voyage eventually reached 28° north latitude (near the Isla de Cedros).

Voyages in 1540 and 1541 to Baja California were sponsored by Cortés&#x27;s rival, the Viceroy of New Spain. These voyages were led by Hernando de Alarcón (1540) and by Francisco de Bolaños (1541). The voyage by Alarcón was meant to be coordinated with Francisco Vásquez de Coronado&#x27;s overland expedition; Alarcón penetrated the lower Colorado River, perhaps as far as the modern California-Arizona boundary (but did not meet up with Coronado&#x27;s expedition). The voyage of Bolaños provided little new information not already known in New Spain. Application of the name &quot;California&quot; to this part of the west coast of North America is attributed by some to Bolaños, however others insist that the name first appears in work written by Alarcón.

The governor of Guatemala also determined to build a Pacific fleet on the west coast of Guatemala, for use in an attempt to cross the Pacific to Asia. Ferdinand Magellan, the Portuguese explorer sailing for Spain, had shown in 1521 that the Pacific Ocean could be crossed from South America. Hence, beginning in 1536, using hardware from Spain (such as anchors) hauled across the isthmus of Central America, and local hardwoods, a flotilla of some thirteen ships was built over the next four years. After much difficulty, the larger number of these ships (under the command of Ruy López de Villalobos) was ordered to make the first crossing of the Pacific Ocean from North America to the Philippines. A smaller number was placed under the command of Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, a Portuguese navigator sailing for the Spanish Crown. Cabrillo was ordered north along the west coast of North America to explore the expected coastal route to reach the Asian mainland, as well as attempt to find the Strait of Anián.

In 1542, Cabrillo became the first European to explore the west coast of today&#x27;s United States, leading the expedition that landed at San Diego Bay, and continued north along the coast up to Punta del Año Nuevo, 37° 10&#x27; north of Monterrey. But Cabrillo died on January 3, 1543, and the remainder of the exploration was led by Bartolomé Ferrer, who sailed perhaps as far north as the Rogue River in today&#x27;s western coast of Oregon.

Importantly beginning in 1565, Acapulco was a home of the vital Manila Galleons. The Manila Galleons crossed the Pacific Ocean to the Spanish possession of the Philippines, laden with silver and gemstones from Mexico. There, the wealth was used to purchase Asian trade goods such as spices, silk, and porcelain. These goods were then carried across the Pacific by the Manila Galleons to Acapulco; from there, the goods were transshipped across Mexico, for delivery to the Spanish treasure fleet, for shipment to Spain. The income provided to Spain by the Manila Galleons was essential to the Spanish Crown and to the Spanish economy of the era.

When Miguel López de Legazpi completed the conquest of the Philippines in 1565, he sent his flagship, the &quot;San Pedro&quot;, back to New Spain, with orders to survey and chart a practicable route for ships returning from the Islands. The &quot;San Pedro&quot; sailed from Cebu, headed roughly northeast, followed the Kuroshio Current (also known as the Japan Current), and made landfall on the coast of California about the latitude of Cape Mendocino. A sail of two thousand five hundred miles down the coasts of California and New Spain brought the voyagers to the port of Acapulco. This route was charted by the Basque navigator and friar Andrés de Urdaneta, on board the &quot;San Pedro&quot;, and for nearly three centuries was the one followed by the galleons of Spain sailing from Manila to Acapulco. This return voyage across the Pacific could take up to seven months. A harbor on the coast of California where ships could find shelter and repair damage was greatly desired. A survey of the unknown northern Pacific coast of North America was ordered, and it was also suggested that the explorations be extended north of 42° north latitude.

In 1585, Captain Francisco de Gali, on the return voyage from the Philippines, via Macao, was directed to sail as far north as the weather would permit, and then east, and upon reaching the coast of California to make maps on his journey south. However, Gali accomplished only limited chart-making. He reached the California coast at latitude 37° 30&#x27; (Pillar Point—just south of today&#x27;s San Francisco), and noted that the land was high and fair; that the mountains were without snow, and that there were many indications of rivers, bays, and havens along the coast.

In 1594, Captain Sebastião Rodrigues Soromenho, a Portuguese sailor in the service of Spain, sailed from the Philippines in the &quot;San Agustin&quot; with orders similar to those of Gali. In this attempt, he reached land between Point St. George and Trinidad Head on November 4, 1595. Following the line of the coast southwards, Cermeñon&#x27;s ship became wrecked and was beached in Drake&#x27;s Bay, north of San Francisco. Using salvaged and local materials, the crew constructed an open boat, and the ship&#x27;s company of more than seventy persons continued the homeward voyage. This open vessel reached Acapulco in early 1596—a remarkable voyage of nearly twenty-five hundred miles in an open boat. With the loss of the &quot;San Agustin&quot;, exploration of the California coast by ships loaded with cargo from the Philippines came to an end.

In 1602, the Basque captain Sebastián Vizcaíno, sailing for Spain, explored the coastline from Mexico as far north as Monterey Bay in today&#x27;s California, where he went ashore. He ventured inland south along the coast, and recorded a visit to what is likely Carmel Bay. His major contributions were the glowing reports of the Monterey area as an anchorage and as land suitable for settlement, as well as the detailed charts he made of the coastal waters (which were used for nearly 200 years); however no settlements in today&#x27;s California were established for the next 150 years.

In the late 17th century, Spain sent the first missionaries into today&#x27;s Baja California, founding the first mission there in 1683 at San Bruno on the east coast of the Baja peninsula (San Bruno was abandoned as unsuccessful after two years). In 1697, the first &quot;permanent&quot; mission was established at Loreto, about away from San Bruno, also on the east coast of the peninsula. During this period (until 1750), some 16 missions were established on the peninsula—mostly on the east coast of the peninsula, with a handful on the Pacific coast, in the northwestern part of the peninsula.

===English interest===
Although it wasn&#x27;t until 1579 that the west coast of North America was visited by an English explorer, the privateer Sir Francis Drake who landed at Drake&#x27;s Bay and claimed the area for England, calling it &quot;Nova Albion&quot; or New England.
Despite the facts that no settlements were ever established by Drake, and that the next official visit by the English would be some two hundred years later, Drake&#x27;s action and Cabot&#x27;s original claim in 1497 were the foundations of British claims to portions of the west coast of North America in the late 18th century. These claims would later be ceded to the United States after the Oregon boundary dispute.

==Settlements and conflicts (1750–1846)==
While the Spanish had dominated development on the west coast of North America for over 200 years since the early 16th century, beginning in the mid-18th century, this period saw the advent of British and Russian fur traders, and the establishment of the California missions, followed by the independence of Mexico and the Central American countries. Much later in this period, the United States started on its path to become the dominant power on the west coast of North America.

===Spanish settlements in coastal New Spain===
In the 1760s, a decision was made to create a harbor at San Blas (in today&#x27;s Mexican state of Nayarit), for the purpose of building ships, supplying them, and being the expeditionary base for voyages north along the west coast of North America, from Baja California to Alaska. Today it remains unclear exactly why the Viceroy of New Spain decided to create an entirely new shipbuilding port along the west coast of Mexico, when the port at Acapulco already existed. It has been speculated that the reasons San Blas was chosen included that it was a week&#x27;s sailing closer than Acapulco to the intended destination sites in California, that it was not far from the capital of New Spain, and perhaps more importantly, it had ready access to tropical hardwoods that would be needed to build the ships for the strenuous voyages as far north as today&#x27;s Alaska. San Blas built the ships and was the home port for these exploration and supply voyages beginning in 1769 and continuing to 1820.

===Spanish missions===

It was not until 1769 that the first missions were established in today&#x27;s California (then called &quot;Las Californias&quot;), including the first mission, at San Diego in 1769, the mission at Monterey in 1770, and the mission at San Francisco in 1776. These missions eventually stretched from the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula to Sonoma, California, north of San Francisco. The purpose of the missions, which typically had an accompanying &quot;pueblo&quot; (town) and &quot;presidio&quot; (military outpost), was to solidify the 250-year-old Spanish claim to the region. This need became more urgent as the Russians and British were establishing fur trading posts on the far northern part of the west coast of North America. In addition, there continued the long-standing interest in creating a safe anchorage for seaworn Manila Galleons on their return to Acapulco.

===Russian settlements===
Explorers and fur trappers from the Russian Empire (beginning with Semyon Dezhnev expedition of 1630) arrived on the Pacific coast of today&#x27;s Alaska, and after establishing settlements there (beginning in 1784), expanded hunting and trading down the west coast of North America. In the early 19th century, fur trappers of the Russian Empire explored the west coast of North America, hunting for sea otter pelts as far south as San Diego. In 1812, the Russian-American Company set up a fortified trading post at Fort Ross, located north of present-day Bodega Bay some sixty miles north of San Francisco, with the never-materialized hope of using that area to develop a source of agricultural products needed for their settlements in Alaska.

===Spanish exploration===

In the late 18th century, Spain reacted to the increasing Russian and British presence in the Pacific Northwest by sending exploratory expeditions along the coast as far north as Alaska. In 1774 Juan José Pérez Hernández was commissioned to explore the coast up to 60° N, but only made it as far as 55°30´ N. Off Langara Island in Haida Gwaii he made contact with the Haida, and on the homeward journey, the Nuu-chah-nulth. In 1775, a two-ship exploration expedition led by Spanish Captain Don Bruno de Heceta landed on the coast of today&#x27;s Washington—the first European to have sailed this far north along the coast. The expedition re-asserted Spanish claims to all the coastal lands, including to the Russian settlements in the north. The two ships sailed together as far north as Point Grenville, named Punta de los Martires (or &quot;Point of the Martyrs&quot;) by Heceta in response to an attack by the local Quinault Indians. He was the first European to sight the mouth of the Columbia River.

By design, the two vessels separated with one continuing to what is today the border between Washington state and Canada. The other (now with second officer Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra at the helm) moved up the coast according to its orders, ultimately reaching a position at 59° north latitude on August 15, 1775, entering Sitka Sound near the present-day town of Sitka, Alaska. It is there that the Spaniards performed numerous &quot;acts of sovereignty,&quot; naming and claiming Puerto de Bucareli (Bucareli Sound), Puerto de los Remedios, and Mount San Jacinto (renamed Mount Edgecumbe by British explorer James Cook three years later).

In 1790, Spanish explorer Salvador Fidalgo led an expedition that included visits to the sites of today&#x27;s Cordova, Alaska and Valdez, Alaska, where acts of sovereignty were performed. Fidalgo went as far as today&#x27;s Kodiak Island, visiting the small Russian settlement there. Fidalgo then went to the Russian settlement at Alexandrovsk (today&#x27;s English Bay or Nanwalek, Alaska), southwest of today&#x27;s Anchorage on the Kenai Peninsula, where again, Fidalgo re-asserted the Spanish claim to the area by conducting a formal ceremony of sovereignty.
In 1791, the Malaspina Expedition undertook a search for the Northwest Passage, surveying the Alaska coast from Yakutat Bay to Prince William Sound. At Yakutat Bay, the expedition made contact with the Tlingit. The expedition&#x27;s scientists made a study of the tribe, recording information on social mores, language, economy, warfare methods, and burial practices. Artists with the expedition, Tomas de Suria and José Cardero, produced portraits of tribal members and scenes of Tlingit daily life. A glacier between Yakutat Bay and Icy Bay was subsequently named after Malaspina. The botanist Luis Née also accompanied the expedition, during which he collected and described numerous new plants.

During the return to Mexico, Malaspina&#x27;s expedition spent a month at the Spanish outpost in Nootka Sound on Vancouver Island (see below). The expedition made a study of the Nootka. The two ships then sailed south to Mexico, stopping at the Spanish settlement and mission at Monterey, California on the way. Simultaneously an expedition under Francisco de Eliza, exploring the Strait of Juan de Fuca, discovered an entrance to the Strait of Georgia, which prompted further investigation. In Acapulco, Malaspina took over two schooners, the &quot;Sutil&quot; and &quot;Mexicana&quot;, placed them under the command of one of his officers, Dionisio Alcalá Galiano, and had them sail north to explore the Strait of Georgia. Galiano&#x27;s expedition took place in 1792 at the same time as that of George Vancouver. The two expeditions met in the Strait of Georgia and worked together to map the waters and establish the insularity of Vancouver Island.

Today, Spain&#x27;s legacy endures as dozens of Spanish place names. In Alaska these include the Malaspina Glacier and Cordova Glacier, the towns of Valdez, Cordova and Port Gravina, as well as Orca Bay, Cordova Peak, and Revillagigedo Island. In British Columbia some of the better-known Spanish names (of many) include Quadra Island, Galiano Island, Gabriola Island, and Haro Strait.

===British North America===
In 1778, the British seafaring Captain James Cook, midway through his third and final voyage of exploration, sailed along the west coast of North America, mapping the coast from California all the way to the Bering Strait. The northern stretch of the west coast of North America was claimed by the British, but the region was not occupied by any British subject until 1788, when John Meares first small trading post in Nootka Sound in today&#x27;s British Columbia. His post was torn down at the end of 1788, although he claimed otherwise.

===Conflict between Spain and Great Britain===
Spain established its own competing fortified trading post at Nootka Sound (&quot;Santa Cruz de Nutka&quot;, maintained between 1789 and 1795) on Vancouver Island, in today&#x27;s British Columbia, and sought forcibly to remove British traders by seizing their ships, triggering the Nootka Crisis.

War between Spain and Great Britain over control of the Pacific Northwest was averted by the three Nootka Conventions, signed in 1790, 1793, and 1794. Spain gave up its claim that it alone could establish settlements in the Pacific Northwest (a claim that dated back to the 1493 papal bull and Balboa&#x27;s actions in 1513), and conceded the British right to establish settlements in any area nominally claimed by Spain but never occupied. This agreement effectively allowed a greatly increased British presence in the Pacific Northwest, including today&#x27;s British Columbia, Oregon, and Washington.

The primary beneficiary of this agreement was the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, which, in 1825, established a major trading post at Fort Vancouver across the Columbia River just north of today&#x27;s Portland, Oregon. From this headquarters, Company fur trappers spread throughout the Pacific Northwest, extending as far east as the Rocky Mountains and, by using the Siskiyou Trail, as far south as California&#x27;s Central Valley.

===Mexican independence===
After the Spanish possession now known as Mexico (first known as &quot;América Septentrional&quot; or &quot;Northern America&quot;) won its War of Independence from Spain in 1821, Mexico initially retained Spain&#x27;s missions and settlements along the Pacific coast, and continued Spain&#x27;s claims to territory as far north as today&#x27;s border between California and Oregon. In the 1830s, Mexico ended Church control of the missions in California and opened the land to secular development, particularly ranching. By the 1840s, there were small Mexican settlements at San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and the territorial capital at Monterey. These settlements primarily traded cattle hides and tallow with American and European merchant vessels. This period is vividly portrayed in Bostonian Richard Henry Dana Jr.&#x27;s famous seafaring memoir, &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot; and the culture of the great Mexican landowners of this period is often harked back to as exemplifying the height of California&#x27;s romantic pastoral era. Mexican control of the territory ended after only 25 years, when attempts by local Mexican officials to expropriate the property of American ranchers and drive them out of California in the winter led to the successful uprising known as the Bear Flag Revolt.

===Central American independence===
During the 1820s, the Central American possessions of Spain gained their independence, and the boundaries of the young nations shifted in alliances and configurations. For example, what was to become the nation of Panama was simply a province of Colombia, and Guatemala was variously part of a confederation with Mexico, and part of the United Provinces of Central America, before becoming a separate nation in 1838. Almost all of these Central American nations saw continuing political strife throughout this period (and into the 20th century), as struggles continued between indigenous peoples and elites, and among factions of the elites.

===French interest===
In 1786, Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse led a group of French scientists and artists on a voyage of exploration ordered by Louis XVI and were welcomed in Monterey, California. They compiled an account of the California mission system, the land and the people.

The leader of a further French scientific expedition to California, Eugène Duflot de Mofras, wrote in 1840 &quot;...it is evident that California will belong to whatever nation chooses to send there a man-of-war and two hundred men.&quot; In 1841, the Mexican military commander in Northern California, General Mariano Vallejo, wrote &quot;there is no doubt that France is intriguing to become mistress of California.&quot;

===U.S. expansion===
In 1805, the first official party of Americans to arrive on the west coast of North America, the fabled expedition of Lewis and Clark, came down the Columbia River to the river&#x27;s mouth on the border between today&#x27;s Oregon and Washington. In 1819, the United States acquired the Spanish claims to the Pacific Northwest (as negotiated in the Nootka Convention) in the Adams-Onís Treaty. The United States argued that it acquired the Spanish rights to exclusive ownership of the Pacific Northwest as far north as Alaska, even though Spain had in fact relinquished any claim to exclusive rights as a result of the Nootka Conventions. This position led to a dispute with Britain known as the Oregon boundary dispute, remembered for the slogan &quot;54-40 or fight!&quot; The two countries agreed to defer resolution of the dispute, and to allow settlement by both British and American immigrants in what became known in the United States as the Oregon Country (today&#x27;s Oregon, Washington, and Idaho; much of today&#x27;s British Columbia; and parts of Montana and Wyoming).

In 1841, the United States Exploring Expedition visited the west coast of North America by ship, and sent an overland party down the Siskiyou Trail, from the site of today&#x27;s Portland, Oregon, to San Francisco.

Americans continued arriving on the west coast of North America in significant numbers in the mid-1830s. They first came overland along the Oregon Trail, settling primarily in the rich Willamette Valley south of today&#x27;s Portland. By 1841, the first overland party of American settlers reached California along what became the California Trail, and by the mid-1840s significant numbers of Americans were arriving in California.

In addition, the long-standing dispute between the United States and Great Britain over the Oregon Country was resolved in 1846, with the signing of the Oregon Treaty; the Oregon Treaty divided the disputed territory along what later became the current international boundary between Canada and the United States.

==Rapid growth (1846–1945)==
In this era, much of the west coast of North America transformed from an area still largely populated by indigenous peoples to widespread population of non-natives. In particular, the west coast of the United States showed the most dramatic change, beginning with the California Gold Rush and the subsequent opening of the transcontinental railroads, through the development of Hollywood in Southern California, and increased industry and agriculture in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Canadian and Mexican development also proceeded during this time, but at a slower pace.

===United States===

Americans in California rebelled against Mexico, and in 1846 established the short-lived California Republic. However, the Mexican–American War had already been declared, and the American military quickly took control of California. At the end of the war, Mexico ceded control of California to the United States. Things began to change dramatically in 1848 with the California Gold Rush which brought an influx of migrants across the nation and immigrants from around the world. While few found much gold, many stayed, founding communities and turning to farming and other practices. Despite these increases in population, the west coast was still on the periphery. The American Civil War had little effect, but began to change as the first transcontinental railroads (completed in 1869) stretched across the United States. For the first time, it was relatively cheap and easy for migrants and immigrants to move to the west coast. 

In 1867, the United States acquired Alaska from the Russian Empire, capping American westward expansion on the North American continent.

The next 75 years saw a monumental change on the west coast of the United States. Successive booms of agriculture, oil, entertainment, and industry greatly increased California&#x27;s population. Logging, fishing, and industry drove the economies of California, Oregon, and Washington. However, Alaska had a small economy, despite the three gold rush eras (Klondike, Nome, and Fairbanks) and commercial fishing. This was due to high costs and a risky investment climate that limited development in the Alaskan landscape.

During World War II, defense companies like Boeing, Douglas Aircraft Company, Kaiser Shipyards, and Vigor Shipyards dominated the wartime manufacturing in the West Coast, especially in cities like Seattle, Portland, and Los Angeles. Military investment into Alaska also increased in response to the growing threat from Imperial Japan in the Pacific War. Hoping to bring the conflict further into the continental U.S., Japan launched a series of attacks by land, air, and sea on the continental Pacific Coast as part of the American Theater, such as the Bombardment of Ellwood, the Aleutian Islands Campaign, and the Fu-Go balloon bomb campaign.

===Canada===
The gold rush fever spread progressively north; in 1858, the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush began in British Columbia, and at the end of the century, the Klondike Gold Rush saw the Yukon hit by masses of prospectors.

The formal delineation of the international border had not completely allayed Britain&#x27;s fears of losing its Pacific territories, especially as it continued to lag behind the western United States in population and development. As a condition of British Columbia&#x27;s joining Canadian Confederation in 1871, the Canadian government promised British Columbia a railway, though due to the Pacific Scandal and controversies over the location of the Pacific port and railhead and the use of importing Chinese labour, the Canadian Pacific Railway was not completed until 1885. The new line became an important link in what was known as the All Red Route around the world, linking global travel through territories of the British Empire.

===Mexico===
While the Pacific Coast of Mexico remained relatively undeveloped economically, exceptions were tobacco cultivation in the coastal territory of Nayarit, tourism at Acapulco, and local-scale fishing all along the coast.

===Central America===
The countries of Central America continued to struggle politically during this time (with perhaps the notable exception of Costa Rica), and began to expand agriculture, particularly in coffee and bananas with investment and substantial control by the United States. The establishment in 1903 of the newly independent nation of Panama (under pressure from the United States) led to the creation of the Canal Zone and opening of the Panama Canal in 1914. The opening of the Canal benefited the region economically as trade with the Eastern United States and Europe became far easier.

===Immigration===
Both the gold rushes and the building of the railroads required vast amounts of labor. One available source that was used on both sides of the border were immigrants from East Asia, largely from China and Japan. These immigrants were willing to work for very little and played a crucial role in building the infrastructure of the west coast. However, they faced constant discrimination. Asians were deprived of their civil rights in both the United States and Canada. There was also pressure to restrict Asian immigration, opinions that were acted on with quotas, head taxes, and finally a complete ban in both nations in the 1920s. Because of discrimination, and also a desire to remain a community, Chinatowns developed in all the major cities along the west coast.

===Increased trade and World War II===
The rise of the Japanese economy also benefited the region as the ability to trade across the Pacific continued to show its great potential.

However, only a few decades later, Japan would become a major threat. During World War II, there were few attacks against North America with the Aleutian Islands campaign being the major one. Japan tried to damage the region by sending over thousands of Fu-Go balloon bombs in an attempt to light forest fires. These were generally ineffective; a few landed in either Canada or the United States but they caused no great destruction. More destructive was the internment of ethnic Japanese, who were expropriated and sent into internal exile merely for their descent.

==Post-war period (1945–present)==

The post-war years would be ones of great prosperity and growth on the west coast of North America. The quick reemergence of Japan and its stunning growth over the next decades meant great wealth for the west coast ports. Japan became the second largest trading partner of both Canada and the United States, and this trade was almost entirely based in the west coast (the United States and Canada are each other&#x27;s largest trading partners). Later the other Asian economies would add to this trade. Throughout the Pacific Northwest, the primary extractive activities of logging, mining, and fishing remained the central industries. California became a center of entertainment, aerospace engineering, and electronics. Following Alaska&#x27;s admission to the Union in 1959, military spending, the development of Cook Inlet oil industry, and rebuilding after the 1964 earthquake fueled the state&#x27;s economic growth in the 1960s.

Unlike other areas of the United States, the western economies were not based upon manufacturing and the great deindustrialization of the 1970s and 1980s did little to hurt the region—creating an imbalance between rapid growth in the west and stagnation or decline in the east.

During this period, the west coast departed from positions held in the FDR years and moved toward the direction of conservatism with the population favoring lower taxes. In the United States, this manifested itself in support for the Republican Party, especially for the two Republican California-based presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. In British Columbia, the right wing Social Credit Party governed for over thirty years. Nonetheless, the great port cities of San Francisco and Vancouver both fostered alternative views, acting as centers for environmentalism, unions, feminism, and gay rights.

The general economic revival of North America in the late 1990s brought growth in Northern California due to the high-tech industry. The region was hurt, however, by the decade-long economic slump of Japan beginning at the same time. This was made up for by the rapid growth of Southeast Asia, South Korea, and especially China. The entire region shifted quite dramatically politically, however. Westerners diverged from conservatism over social issues such as gay rights, abortion, and the legalization of soft drugs. In 1991, British Columbia threw out Social Credit electing the social democratic British Columbia New Democratic Party. California, Washington, and Oregon were pivotal in Bill Clinton&#x27;s two presidential victories as well as Al Gore and John Kerry&#x27;s near wins in 2000 and 2004 respectively; however, Alaska voted against all three candidates. This change was mainly in the urban coastal areas. Inland, rural regions of California remained staunchly Republican, and although once full of labour strongholds, the Interior of British Columbia has voted solidly for the Reform Party and its successors.

<text>Foreign exchange reserves (also called forex reserves or FX reserves) are cash and other reserve assets such as gold and silver held by a central bank or other monetary authority that are primarily available to balance payments of the country, influence the foreign exchange rate of its currency, and to maintain confidence in financial markets. Reserves are held in one or more reserve currencies, nowadays mostly the United States dollar and to a lesser extent the euro.

Foreign exchange reserves assets can comprise banknotes, bank deposits, and government securities of the reserve currency, such as bonds and treasury bills. Some countries hold a part of their reserves in gold, and special drawing rights are also considered reserve assets. Often, for convenience, the cash or securities are retained by the central bank of the reserve or other currency and the &quot;holdings&quot; of the foreign country are tagged or otherwise identified as belonging to the other country without them actually leaving the vault of that central bank. From time to time they may be physically moved to the home or another country.

Normally, interest is not paid on foreign cash reserves, nor on gold holdings, but the central bank usually earns interest on government securities. The central bank may, however, profit from a depreciation of the foreign currency or incur a loss on its appreciation. The central bank also incurs opportunity costs from holding the reserve assets (especially cash holdings) and from their storage, security costs, etc.

==Definition==
 
Foreign exchange reserves are also known as reserve assets and include foreign banknotes, foreign bank deposits, foreign treasury bills, and short and long-term foreign government securities, as well as gold reserves, special drawing rights (SDRs), and International Monetary Fund (IMF) reserve positions.

In a central bank&#x27;s accounts, foreign exchange reserves are called reserve assets in the capital account of the balance of payments, and may be labeled as reserve assets under assets by functional category. In terms of financial assets classifications, reserve assets can be classified as gold bullion, unallocated gold accounts, special drawing rights, currency, reserve position in the IMF, interbank position, other transferable deposits, other deposits, debt securities, loans, stocks (listed and unlisted), investment fund shares and financial derivatives, such as forward contracts and options. There is no counterpart for reserve assets in liabilities of the International Investment Position. Usually, when the monetary authority of a country has some kind of liability, this will be included in other categories, such as Other Investments. On a central bank&#x27;s Balance sheet, foreign exchange reserves are assets, along with domestic credit.

==Purpose==
Typically, one of the critical functions of a country&#x27;s central bank is reserve management, to ensure that the central bank has control over adequate foreign assets to meet national objectives. These objectives may include:

* supporting and maintaining confidence in the national monetary and exchange rate management policies,
* limiting external vulnerability to shocks during times of crisis or when access to borrowing is curtailed, and in doing so -
** providing a level of confidence to markets,
** demonstrating backing for the domestic currency,
** assisting the government to meet its foreign exchange needs and external debt obligations, and
** maintaining a reserve for potential national disasters or emergencies.

Reserves assets allow a central bank to purchase the domestic currency, which is considered a liability for the central bank (since it prints the money or fiat currency as IOUs). Thus, the quantity of foreign exchange reserves can change as a central bank implements monetary policy, but this dynamic should be analyzed generally in the context of the level of capital mobility, the exchange rate regime and other factors. This is known as trilemma or impossible trinity. Hence, in a world of perfect capital mobility, a country with fixed exchange rate would not be able to execute an independent monetary policy.

A central bank which chooses to implement a fixed exchange rate policy may face a situation where supply and demand would tend to push the value of the currency lower or higher (an increase in demand for the currency would tend to push its value higher, and a decrease lower) and thus the central bank would have to use reserves to maintain its fixed exchange rate. Under perfect capital mobility, the change in reserves is a temporary measure, since the fixed exchange rate attaches the domestic monetary policy to that of the country of the base currency. Hence, in the long term, the monetary policy has to be adjusted in order to be compatible with that of the country of the base currency. Without that, the country will experience outflows or inflows of capital. 
Fixed pegs were usually used as a form of monetary policy, since attaching the domestic currency to a currency of a country with lower levels of inflation should usually assure convergence of prices.

In a pure flexible exchange rate regime or floating exchange rate regime, the central bank does not intervene in the exchange rate dynamics; hence the exchange rate is determined by the market. Theoretically, in this case reserves are not necessary. Other instruments of monetary policy are generally used, such as interest rates in the context of an inflation targeting regime. Milton Friedman was a strong advocate of flexible exchange rates, since he considered that independent monetary (and in some cases fiscal) policy and openness of the capital account are more valuable than a fixed exchange rate. Also, he valued the role of exchange rate as a price. As a matter of fact, he believed that sometimes it could be less painful and thus desirable to adjust only one price (the exchange rate) than the whole set of prices of goods and wages of the economy, that are less flexible.

Mixed exchange rate regimes (&#x27;dirty floats&#x27;, target bands or similar variations) may require the use of foreign exchange operations to maintain the targeted exchange rate within the prescribed limits, such as fixed exchange rate regimes. 
As seen above, there is an intimate relation between exchange rate policy (and hence reserves accumulation) and monetary policy. Foreign exchange operations can be sterilized (have their effect on the money supply negated via other financial transactions) or unsterilized.

Non-sterilization will cause an expansion or contraction in the amount of domestic currency in circulation, and hence directly affect inflation and monetary policy. For example, to maintain the same exchange rate if there is increased demand, the central bank can issue more of the domestic currency and purchase foreign currency, which will increase the sum of foreign reserves. Since (if there is no sterilization) the domestic money supply is increasing (money is being &#x27;printed&#x27;), this may provoke domestic inflation. Also, some central banks may let the exchange rate appreciate to control inflation, usually by the channel of cheapening tradable goods.

Since the amount of foreign reserves available to defend a weak currency (a currency in low demand) is limited, a currency crisis or devaluation could be the result. For a currency in very high and rising demand, foreign exchange reserves can theoretically be continuously accumulated, if the intervention is sterilized through open market operations to prevent inflation from rising. On the other hand, this is costly, since the sterilization is usually done by public debt instruments (in some countries Central Banks are not allowed to emit debt by themselves).
In practice, few central banks or currency regimes operate on such a simplistic level, and numerous other factors (domestic demand, production and productivity, imports and exports, relative prices of goods and services, etc.) will affect the eventual outcome. Besides that, the hypothesis that the world economy operates under perfect capital mobility is clearly flawed.

As a consequence, even those central banks that strictly limit foreign exchange interventions often recognize that currency markets can be volatile and may intervene to counter disruptive short-term movements (that may include speculative attacks). Thus, intervention does not mean that they are defending a specific exchange rate level. Hence, the higher the reserves, the higher is the capacity of the central bank to smooth the volatility of the Balance of Payments and assure consumption smoothing in the long term.

==Reserve accumulation==
After the end of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s, many countries adopted flexible exchange rates. In theory reserves are not needed under this type of exchange rate arrangement; thus the expected trend should be a decline in foreign exchange reserves. However, the opposite happened and foreign reserves present a strong upward trend. Reserves grew more than gross domestic product (GDP) and imports in many countries. The only ratio that is relatively stable is foreign reserves over M2. Below are some theories that can explain this trend.

===Theories===

====Signaling or vulnerability indicator====
Credit risk agencies and international organizations use ratios of reserves to other external sector variables to assess a country&#x27;s external vulnerability. For example, Article IV of 2013 uses total external debt to gross international reserves, gross international reserves in months of prospective goods and nonfactor services imports to broad money, broad money to short-term external debt, and short-term external debt to short-term external debt on residual maturity basis plus current account deficit. Therefore, countries with similar characteristics accumulate reserves to avoid negative assessment by the financial market, especially when compared to members of a peer group.

====Precautionary aspect====
Reserves are used as savings for potential times of crises, especially balance of payments crises. Original fears were related to the current account, but this gradually changed to also include financial account needs. Furthermore, the creation of the IMF was viewed as a response to the need of countries to accumulate reserves. If a specific country is suffering from a balance of payments crisis, it would be able to borrow from the IMF. However, the process of obtaining resources from the Fund is not automatic, which can cause problematic delays especially when markets are stressed. Therefore, the fund only serves as a provider of resources for longer term adjustments. Also, when the crisis is generalized, the resources of the IMF could prove insufficient. After the 2008 crisis, the members of the Fund had to approve a capital increase, since its resources were strained. Moreover, after the 1997 Asian crisis, reserves in Asian countries increased because of doubt in the IMF reserves. Also, during the 2008 crisis, the Federal Reserve instituted currency swap lines with several countries, alleviating liquidity pressures in dollars, thus reducing the need to use reserves.

=====External trade=====
Countries engaging in international trade, maintain reserves to ensure no interruption. A rule usually followed by central banks is to hold in reserve at least three months of imports. Also, an increase in reserves occurred when commercial openness increased (part of the process known as globalization). Reserve accumulation was faster than that which would be explained by trade, since the ratio has increased to several months of imports. Furthermore, the ratio of reserves to foreign trade is closely watched by credit risk agencies in months of imports.

=====Financial openness=====
The opening of a financial account of the balance of payments has been important during the last decade. Hence, financial flows such as direct investment and portfolio investment became more important. Usually financial flows are more volatile that enforce the necessity of higher reserves. Moreover, holding reserves, as a consequence of the increasing of financial flows, is known as Guidotti–Greenspan rule that states a country should hold liquid reserves equal to their foreign liabilities coming due within a year. For example, international wholesale financing relied more on Korean banks in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis, when the Korean Won depreciated strongly, because the Korean banks&#x27; ratio of short-term external debt to reserves was close to 100%, which exacerbated the perception of vulnerability.

====Exchange rate policy====
Reserve accumulation can be an instrument to interfere with the exchange rate. Since the first General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) of 1948 to the foundation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, the regulation of trade is a major concern for most countries throughout the world. Hence, commercial distortions such as subsidies and taxes are strongly discouraged. However, there is no global framework to regulate financial flows. As an example of regional framework, members of the European Union are prohibited from introducing capital controls, except in an extraordinary situation. The dynamics of China&#x27;s trade balance and reserve accumulation during the first decade of the 2000 was one of the main reasons for the interest in this topic.
Some economists are trying to explain this behavior. Usually, the explanation is based on a sophisticated variation of mercantilism, such as to protect the take-off in the tradable sector of an economy, by avoiding the real exchange rate appreciation that would naturally arise from this process. One attempt uses a standard model of open economy intertemporal consumption to show that it is possible to replicate a tariff on imports or a subsidy on exports by closing the capital account and accumulating reserves. Another is more related to the economic growth literature. The argument is that the tradable sector of an economy is more capital intense than the non-tradable sector. The private sector invests too little in capital, since it fails to understand the social gains of a higher capital ratio given by externalities (like improvements in human capital, higher competition, technological spillovers and increasing returns to scale). The government could improve the equilibrium by imposing subsidies and tariffs, but the hypothesis is that the government is unable to distinguish between good investment opportunities and rent-seeking schemes. Thus, reserves accumulation would correspond to a loan to foreigners to purchase a quantity of tradable goods from the economy. In this case, the real exchange rate would depreciate and the growth rate would increase. In some cases, this could improve welfare, since the higher growth rate would compensate the loss of the tradable goods that could be consumed or invested. In this context, foreigners have the role to choose only the useful tradable goods sectors.

====Intergenerational savings====
Reserve accumulation can be seen as a way of &quot;forced savings&quot;. The government, by closing the financial account, would force the private sector to buy domestic debt for lack of better alternatives. With these resources, the government buys foreign assets. Thus, the government coordinates the savings accumulation in the form of reserves. Sovereign wealth funds are examples of governments that try to save the windfall of booming exports as long-term assets to be used when the source of the windfall is extinguished.

===Costs===
There are costs in maintaining large currency reserves. Fluctuations in exchange rates result in gains and losses in the value of reserves. In addition, the purchasing power of fiat money decreases constantly due to devaluation through inflation. Therefore, a central bank must continually increase the amount of its reserves to maintain the same power to manage exchange rates. Reserves of foreign currency may provide a small return in interest. However, this may be less than the reduction in purchasing power of that currency over the same period of time due to inflation, effectively resulting in a negative return known as the &quot;quasi-fiscal cost&quot;. In addition, large currency reserves could have been invested in higher yielding assets.

Several calculations have been attempted to measure the cost of reserves. The traditional one is the spread between government debt and the yield on reserves. The caveat is that higher reserves can decrease the perception of risk and thus the government bond interest rate, so this measures can overstate the cost. Alternatively, another measure compares the yield in reserves with the alternative scenario of the resources being invested in capital stock to the economy, which is hard to measure. One interesting measure tries to compare the spread between short term foreign borrowing of the private sector and yields on reserves, recognizing that reserves can correspond to a transfer between the private and the public sectors. By this measure, the cost can reach 1% of GDP to developing countries. While this is high, it should be viewed as an insurance against a crisis that could easily cost 10% of GDP to a country. In the context of theoretical economic models it is possible to simulate economies with different policies (accumulate reserves or not) and directly compare the welfare in terms of consumption. Results are mixed, since they depend on specific features of the models.

A case to point out is that of the Swiss National Bank, the central bank of Switzerland. The Swiss franc is regarded as a safe haven currency, so it usually appreciates during market&#x27;s stress. In the aftermath of the 2008 crisis and during the initial stages of the Eurozone crisis, the Swiss franc (CHF) appreciated sharply. The central bank resisted appreciation by buying reserves. After accumulating reserves during 15 months until June 2010, the SNB let the currency appreciate. As a result, the loss with the devaluation of reserves just in 2010 amounted to CHF 27 Billion or 5% of GDP (part of this was compensated by the profit of almost CHF6 Billion due to the surge in the price of gold). In 2011, after the currency appreciated against the Euro from 1.5 to 1.1, the SNB announced a ceiling at the value of CHF 1.2. In the middle of 2012, reserves reached 71% of GDP.

==History==

===Origins and Gold Standard Era===
The modern exchange market as tied to the prices of gold began during 1880. Of this year the countries significant by size of reserves were Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Canadian Confederation, Denmark, Grand Duchy of Finland, German Empire and Sweden-Norway.

Official international reserves, the means of official international payments, formerly consisted only of gold, and occasionally silver. But under the Bretton Woods system, the US dollar functioned as a reserve currency, so it too became part of a nation&#x27;s official international reserve assets. From 1944 to 1968, the US dollar was convertible into gold through the Federal Reserve System, but after 1968 only central banks could convert dollars into gold from official gold reserves, and after 1973 no individual or institution could convert US dollars into gold from official gold reserves. Since 1973, no major currencies have been convertible into gold from official gold reserves. Individuals and institutions must now buy gold in private markets, just like other commodities. Even though US dollars and other currencies are no longer convertible into gold from official gold reserves, they still can function as official international reserves.

Central banks throughout the world have sometimes cooperated in buying and selling official international reserves to attempt to influence exchange rates and avert financial crisis. For example, in the Baring crisis (the &quot;Panic of 1890&quot;), the Bank of England borrowed GBP 2 million from the Bank of France. The same was true for the Louvre Accord and the Plaza Accord in the post gold-standard era.

===Post Gold Standard Era===
Historically, especially before the 1997 Asian financial crisis, central banks had rather meager reserves (by today&#x27;s standards) and were therefore subject to the whims of the market, of which there was accusations of hot money manipulation, however Japan was the exception. In the case of Japan, forex reserves began their ascent a decade earlier, shortly after the Plaza Accord in 1985, and were primarily used as a tool to weaken the surging yen. This effectively granted the United States a massive loan as they were almost exclusively invested in US Treasuries, which assisted the US to engage the Soviet Union in an arms race which ended with the latter&#x27;s bankruptcy, and at the same time, turned Japan into the world&#x27;s largest creditor and the US the largest debtor, as well as swelled Japan&#x27;s domestic debt (Japan sold its own currency to fund the buildup of dollar based assets). By end of 1980, foreign assets of Japan were about 13% of GDP but by the end of 1989 had reached an unprecedented 62%. After 1997, nations in East and Southeast Asia began their massive build-up of forex reserves, as their levels were deemed too low and susceptible to the whims of the market credit bubbles and busts. This build-up has major implications for today&#x27;s developed world economy, by setting aside so much cash that was piled into US and European debt, investment had been crowded out, the developed world economy had effectively slowed to a crawl, giving birth to contemporary negative interest rates.

By 2007, the world had experienced yet another financial crisis, this time the US Federal Reserve organized central bank liquidity swaps with other institutions. Developed countries authorities adopted extra expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, which led to the appreciation of currencies of some emerging markets. The resistance to appreciation and the fear of lost competitiveness led to policies aiming to prevent inflows of capital and more accumulation of reserves. This pattern was called currency war by an exasperated Brazilian authority, and again in 2016 followed the commodities collapse, Mexico had warned China of triggering currency wars.

==Adequacy and excess reserves==
The IMF proposed a new metric to assess reserves adequacy in 2011. The metric was based on the careful analysis of sources of outflow during crisis. Those liquidity needs are calculated taking in consideration the correlation between various components of the balance of payments and the probability of tail events. The higher the ratio of reserves to the developed metric, the lower is the risk of a crisis and the drop in consumption during a crisis. Besides that, the Fund does econometric analysis of several factors listed above and finds those reserves ratios are generally adequate among emerging markets.

Reserves that are above the adequacy ratio can be used in other government funds invested in more risky assets such as sovereign wealth funds or as insurance to time of crisis, such as stabilization funds. If those were included, Norway, Singapore and Persian Gulf States would rank higher on these lists, and United Arab Emirates&#x27; estimated $627 billion Abu Dhabi Investment Authority would be second after China. Apart from high foreign exchange reserves, Singapore also has significant government and sovereign wealth funds including Temasek Holdings (last valued at US$375 billion) and GIC (last valued at US$440 billion).

===1990–1999: Early work and theatre debut ===
Davis made her debut as a dramatic actress in the Joel Schumacher directed psychological horror film &quot;Flatliners&quot; (1990), starring as William Baldwin&#x27;s fiancée. That same year she appeared in the hit family film &quot;Home Alone&quot; (1990) in a small role as a Parisian airport receptionist. Her major stage debut came after she starred in the Wisdom Bridge/Remains Theater co-production of David Mamet&#x27;s play &quot;Speed-the-Plow&quot; for Joel Schumacher with William Petersen in Chicago in 1992. That same year she made her Broadway debut in &quot;Two Shakespearean Actors&quot; (1992) at the Cort Theatre. In 1995 she had her first starring role as Eliza Malone D&#x27;Amico in the Greg Mottola directed independent comedy-drama &quot;The Daytrippers&quot; acting opposite Liev Schreiber, Parker Posey, Anne Meara and Stanley Tucci. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Ms. Meara, who plays her role like an old pro, and Ms. Davis, who has the makings of a young one, are part of a cast that easily makes the film worth seeing&quot;. In 1997 she returned to Broadway debut playing Sasha in the Anton Chekov play &quot;Ivanov&quot; at the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center. Davis acted alongside Kevin Kline, Jayne Atkinson, Tom McGowan, and Marian Seldes. 

The following year she starred in independent romantic comedy film &quot;Next Stop Wonderland&quot; (1998) directed by Brad Anderson. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote of the film, &quot;[It] isn&#x27;t really much more than a beautifully acted, finely edited sitcom, but it creates and sustains an intelligent, seriocomic mood better than any recent film about the urban single life. If the movie at moments recalls &quot;As Good as It Gets&quot;, its characters are subtler and its vision of humanity more truthful.&quot; That same year she had a supporting role in the comedy &quot;The Impostors&quot; (1998) starring Oliver Platt and Stanley Tucci. These led her to roles in Hollywood films such as the thriller &quot;Arlington Road&quot; (1999).

Later, she had lead roles in the New York premiere of Rebecca Gilman&#x27;s &quot;Spinning into Butter&quot; in 2000, and in the 2005 audio play &quot;Hope Leaves the Theater&quot;, written and directed by Charlie Kaufman. This was a segment of the sound-only production &quot;Theater of the New Ear&quot;, which debuted at St. Ann&#x27;s Warehouse in Brooklyn, NY. The title actually refers to Davis&#x27;s character &quot;leaving the theater&quot;. In 2005 she took supporting roles in the black comedy &quot;The Matador&quot;, the John Madden directed drama &quot;Proof&quot;, and the Gore Verbinski comedy-drama &quot;The Weather Man&quot;.

<text>The Hermann Trophy is awarded annually by the Missouri Athletic Club to the United States&#x27;s top men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s college soccer players.

==History==
In 1967, Bob Hermann, the president of the National Professional Soccer League (NPSL) and the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the NPSL&#x27;s successor, the North American Soccer League, established a trophy to annually recognize the top men&#x27;s collegiate soccer player. The trophy, which was first announced in the December 9, 1967 issue of &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, was named the Hermann Trophy and has been awarded each year since. In 1988, a second Hermann Trophy was inaugurated to recognize the top women&#x27;s collegiate player of the year.

In 1986, the Missouri Athletic Club (MAC) began naming an annual player of the year as a rival to the Hermann Trophy. Then in 1996, the National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA) initiated its own annual player of the year award. These three competing awards began merging three years later when the NSCAA and MAC agreed to cooperate on naming a combined collegiate player of the year. Finally, beginning in 2002, the MAC/NSCAA and Hermann Trophy organization merged to create a unified trophy for the top college soccer player of the year.

The original Hermann Award Trophy is on display in the Hermann Atrium located in the McDonnell Athletic Center at MICDS in Ladue, Missouri. The original trophy was donated to the school by Hermann in 2003.

The current MAC Hermann Trophy is on display in the lobbies of the Missouri Athletic Club&#x27;s Downtown and West County Clubhouses.

==Selection process==
Today, the process of selecting a winner begins at the start of the college soccer season when a list of potential nominees is compiled by a nominating committee. Near the end of the collegiate regular season, 15 players whom the committee considers the best in Division I soccer are announced as semifinalists for the award. That list is then voted on through an online voting process by men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Division I soccer coaches whose teams are current NSCAA College Services members. In early December the top three vote-getters for both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s trophy are announced as finalists for the award. These six individuals are invited to an annual banquet held at the Missouri Athletic Club of St. Louis. That evening, the winners of the two awards are announced and receive a 10-pound crystal replica soccer ball made by Tyrone Crystal of County Tyrone, Northern Ireland.

<text>The Onagraceae are a family of flowering plants known as the willowherb family or evening primrose family. They include about 650 species of herbs, shrubs, and trees in 17 genera. The family is widespread, occurring on every continent from boreal to tropical regions.

The family includes a number of popular garden plants, including evening primroses (&quot;Oenothera&quot;) and fuchsias (&quot;Fuchsia&quot;). Some, particularly the willowherbs (&quot;Epilobium&quot;), are common weeds in gardens and rapidly colonize disturbed habitats in the wild. One such species is fireweed (&quot;Chamaenerion angustifolium&quot;).

The family is characterised by flowers with usually four sepals and petals; in some genera, such as &quot;Fuchsia&quot;, the sepals are as brightly coloured as the petals.

The seeds are generally very small. In some genera, such as &quot;Epilobium&quot;, they have tufts of hairs and are dispersed on the wind. In others, such as &quot;Fuchsia&quot;, the seeds develop in juicy berries dispersed by animals. The leaves are commonly opposite or whorled, but are spirally arranged in some species; in most, they are simple and lanceolate in shape. The pollen grains in many genera are loosely held together by viscin threads. Most bees cannot collect it, and only bees with specialized morphologies can effectively pollinate the flowers; nearly all bee taxa that visit the flowers are oligoleges specialized on the family Onagraceae.

The family was named after the genus &quot;Onagra&quot; (now known as &quot;Oenothera&quot;) in 1836 by John Lindley in the second edition of &quot;A Natural System of Botany&quot;.

==Genera==

===Subfamily Ludwigioideae===
*&quot;Ludwigia&quot; 

===Subfamily Onagroideae===
Several genera are synonymized in the classification presented above, in particular &quot;Calylophus&quot; and &quot;Gaura&quot;, which have both been absorbed into &quot;Oenothera&quot; but appear often in the literature as belonging to the previous genera.

<text>Aeroméxico Flight 498 was a scheduled commercial flight from Mexico City, Mexico, to Los Angeles, California, United States, with several intermediate stops. On Sunday, August 31, 1986, the McDonnell Douglas DC-9 operating the flight was clipped in the tail section by N4891F, a Piper PA-28-181 Cherokee owned by the Kramer family, and crashed into the Los Angeles suburb of Cerritos, killing all 64 on the DC-9, all 3 on the Piper and an additional 15 people on the ground. Eight on the ground also sustained minor injuries. Blame was assessed equally on the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the pilot of the Cherokee. No fault was found with the DC-9 or the actions of its crew.

==Background==

=== Accident summary ===
On Sunday, August 31, 1986, at approximately 11:46 a.m. PDT, Flight 498 began its descent into Los Angeles with 58 passengers and six crew members on board. At 11:52 a.m., the Piper collided nearly perpendicular to the upper left side of the horizontal stabilizer support structure of the DC-9, shearing off the top of the Piper&#x27;s cockpit and decapitating Kramer and both of his passengers. The heavily damaged Piper descended uncontrollably after the collision, entering a flat spin, and falling onto an empty playground at 

The DC-9, with its horizontal stabilizer, rudder, and half of its vertical stabilizer torn off, over banked to the right until it became inverted, and simultaneously entered a steep dive. It slammed into a residential neighborhood at Holmes Avenue and Reva Circle in Cerritos, crashing into the backyard of a house at 13426 Ashworth Place, where it exploded on impact. The explosion scattered the DC-9&#x27;s wreckage across Holmes Avenue and onto Carmenita Road, destroying four other houses and damaging seven more. All 64 passengers and crew on board died (plus 15 people on the ground); a fire added to the damage.

=== Aircraft ===
The larger aircraft involved, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32 with tail number XA-JED named &quot;Hermosillo&quot;, was delivered in April 1969 to Delta Air Lines as N1277L before entering into service with Aeroméxico in November 1979. It was flying from Mexico City to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), with intermediate stops in Guadalajara, Loreto and Tijuana.

N4891F was a privately operated Piper PA-28-181 Archer owned by the Kramer family, which was flying from Torrance to Big Bear City, California. The Piper aircraft was piloted by William Kramer, 53. His wife Kathleen, 51, and daughter Caroline, 26, were also aboard. Their plane had departed Torrance at approximately Kramer had 231 flight hours of experience and had moved to Southern California within the last year from Spokane, Washington.

The cockpit crew of Flight 498 consisted of Captain Arturo Valdes Prom (46) and First Officer Jose Hector Valencia (26). The captain had 4,632 hours of flying experience in the DC-9 and a total of 10,641 flight hours. The first officer had flown 1,463 hours, of which 1,245 hours had been accumulated in the DC-9.

=== Passengers and crew ===
Thirty-six of the passengers were citizens of the United States. Of the 20 Mexican citizens, 11 lived in the U.S. and nine lived in Mexico. One Salvadoran citizen lived in Islip, New York. Ten of the passengers were children.

==Investigation and aftermath==
The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation found that the Piper had entered the Los Angeles Terminal Control Area (TCA) airspace (now Class B Airspace) without the required clearance. The TCA included a triangular slab of airspace from of altitude, reaching south to across the Piper&#x27;s intended flight path. The Piper could legally fly beneath this airspace without contacting air traffic control (ATC), but instead climbed into the TCA. The ATC had been distracted by another unauthorized private flight, a Grumman AA-5B Tiger, entering the TCA directly north of the airfield, which also did not have clearance.

The Piper was not equipped with a Mode C transponder, nor was one required, which would have indicated its altitude, and LAX was not equipped with automatic warning systems. Neither pilot appeared to have attempted any evasive maneuvers because neither pilot sighted the other aircraft, although they were in visual range. When an autopsy revealed significant arterial blockage in Kramer&#x27;s heart, public speculation arose suggesting that he had experienced a heart attack that incapacitated him and led to the collision, but further forensic evidence discounted the theory and Kramer&#x27;s error was determined to be the main contributing factor to the collision.

As a result of this accident and other near midair collisions in terminal control areas, the FAA required that all large commercial jets in U.S. airspace be equipped with a traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) and required that light aircraft operating in dense airspaces be equipped with Mode C transponders, which can report their altitude.

A jury ruled that the DC-9 bore no fault, instead deciding that Kramer and the FAA each acted equally negligently and bore equal responsibility. Federal Air Regulations 14 CFR 91.113 (b) require pilots of all aircraft to maintain vigilance to &quot;see and avoid&quot; other aircraft that might be on conflicting flight paths.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit applied the Supreme Court of California&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Thing v. La Chusa&quot; to extend recovery for negligent infliction of emotional distress to Theresa Estrada, whose husband and two of four children were killed on the ground as the result of the crash. In the television documentary &quot;Mayday&quot;, Estrada reported that she saw the explosion from a distance; &quot;Thing&quot; requires that the person be at the scene and aware of the injury being caused to the victim. She arrived minutes later with her home consumed by fire and surrounded by burning homes, cars and aircraft debris. In a separate trial on damages, the Estrada family was awarded a total of $868,263 (approximately $1,908,674.77 in 2024) in economic damages and $4.7 million in noneconomic damages (about $10.3 million in 2024), including $1 million (about $2,198,268.00 in 2024) for the negligent infliction of emotional distress.

==In popular culture==
The Discovery Channel Canada/National Geographic television series &quot;Mayday&quot; featured the accident in a Season 4 episode titled &quot;Out of Sight&quot;. The accident was featured again during Season 8 in a compilation episode titled &quot;System Breakdown&quot;. 

A similar accident is depicted in the &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; episode &quot;ABQ&quot;. The show&#x27;s main character has the same name as the air-traffic controller in the real-life accident, Walter White.

It is featured in season 1, episode 5, of the TV show &quot;Why Planes Crash&quot;, in an episode called &quot;Collision Course&quot;.

In August 2022, KNBC produced &quot;The Nightmare of Flight 498&quot;, led by reporter Hetty Chang, who had been a 7-year-old child residing in the neighborhood where the DC-9 crashed and a student at the school where the Piper Cherokee crashed. Interspersed with news reports from the crash, Chang interviewed her parents, neighbors (including one who resided at 13426 Ashworth Place where the DC-9 exploded), and first responders about their recollections of the crash.

<doc id="1015889" wikidata="Q56543" url="?curid=1015889" title="Guugu Yimithirr language">
<text>Guugu Yimithirr, also rendered Guugu Yimidhirr, Guguyimidjir, and many other spellings, is an Australian Aboriginal language, the traditional language of the Guugu Yimithirr people of Far North Queensland. It belongs to the Pama-Nyungan language family. Most of the speakers today live at the community of Hope Vale, about from Cooktown. However, only about half of the Guugu Yimithirr nation speak the language. As such, efforts are being made to teach it to children. Guugu Yimithirr is the source language of the word &quot;kangaroo&quot; ().

==Name==
The word means &#x27;speech, language&#x27;, while (or ) means -having, being the word for &#x27;this&#x27;. The use of the word , rather than some other word for &quot;this&quot;, was seen as a distinctive feature of Guugu Yimithirr. The element and the practice of naming based on some distinctive word is found in many other languages.

The name has many spelling variants, including Gogo-Yimidjir, Gugu-Yimidhirr, Gugu Yimithirr, Guugu Yimidhirr, Guguyimidjir (used by Ethnologue), Gugu Yimijir, Kukuyimidir, Koko Imudji, Koko Yimidir, Kuku Jimidir, Kuku Yimithirr, and Kuku Yimidhirr.

==Geographic distribution==

The original territory of the Guugu Yimithirr tribe extended northwards to the mouth of the Jeannie River, where it was bordered by speakers of Guugu Nyiguudji; southwards to the Annan River, where it was bordered by speakers of Guugu Yalandji; to the west, it was bordered by speakers of a language called Guugu Warra (literally &#x27;bad talk&#x27;) or Lama-Lama. The modern town of Cooktown is located within Guugu Yimithirr territory.

As of the early 21st century, however, most Guugu Yimithirr speakers live at the mission at Hopevale.

===Dialects===
Guugu Yimithirr originally consisted of several dialects, although even the names of most have now been forgotten. Today, two main dialects are distinguished: the coastal dialect, called &#x27;with the sea&#x27;, and the inland dialect, called &#x27;of the outside&#x27;. Missionaries used the coastal dialect to translate hymns and Bible stories, so some of its words now have religious associations that the inland equivalents lack. There was once also a &quot;Ngegudi&quot; or &quot;Gugu Nyiguudyi&quot; dialect, which is unattested.

==History==

In 1770, Guugu Yimithirr became the first Australian Aboriginal language to be written down when Lieutenant (later Captain) James Cook and his crew recorded words while their ship, the HM Bark &quot;Endeavour&quot;, was being repaired after having run aground on a shoal of the Great Barrier Reef. Joseph Banks described the language as &quot;totally different from that of the Islanders; it sounded more like English in its degree of harshness though it could not be harsh neither &quot;.

Among the words recorded were &#x27; or &#x27; (IPA: ), meaning a large black or grey kangaroo, which would become the general English term for all kangaroos, and (transcribed by Banks as &quot;Je-Quoll&quot;), the name of the quoll.

Sydney Parkinson, who accompanied Cook, gave a useful word list in his posthumously published journal, &quot;A Journal of a Voyage to the South Seas&quot;.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===

Short may be realised as unrounded , and unstressed may be reduced to .

===Consonants===

The stops are usually voiceless and unaspirated initially and after short vowels, and voiced after consonants and long vowels.

The retroflexes may not be single phonemes, but clusters of . However, there is at least one word which, for older speakers, is pronounced with a word-initial retroflex: &quot;run&quot;, which is or .

The rhotic is normally a flap , but may be a trill in emphatic speech.

===Phonotactics===
All words, with the exception of a couple of interjections, begin with one consonant. The consonant can be a stop, nasal, or semivowel (that is, do not occur initially).

Words can end in either a vowel or a consonant. The allowed word-final consonants are .

Within words, any consonant can occur, as well as clusters of up to three consonants, which cannot occur initially or finally.

==Grammar==
Like many Australian languages, Guugu Yimithirr pronouns have accusative morphology while nouns have ergative morphology. That is, the subject of an intransitive verb has the same form as the subject of a transitive verb if the subject is a pronoun, but the same form as the object of a transitive verb otherwise.

Regardless of whether nouns or pronouns are used, the usual sentence order is subject–object–verb, although other word orders are possible.

The language is notable for its use of pure geographic directions (north, south, east, west) rather than egocentric directions (left, right, forward, backward), though such &quot;purity&quot; is disputed. Still, it has given its speakers a remarkable sense of direction.

==Preservation==
, only about half of the 1,400 Guugu Yimithirr people speak the language, with mostly only grandparents being fluent speakers. Hope Vale elders are helping to create video tutorials on teaching Guugu Yimithirr, which are being uploaded to YouTube, while the local school, Hope Vale Cape York Aboriginal Australian Academy, has a language program in its curriculum. With the schools closed and learning being done in the home, using the online videos, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, adults as well as younger siblings have been learning the language alongside the schoolchildren.

== Vocabulary ==
Some words from the Guugu Yimithirr language, as spelt and written by Guugu Yimithirr authors include:
* &quot;Balingga&quot;: echidna
* &quot;Birri&quot;: river
* &quot;Bubu&quot;: land
* &quot;Buurraay&quot;: water
* &quot;Gangurru&quot;: kangaroo
* &quot;Gulaan&quot;: possum
* &quot;Guuju&quot;: fish
* &quot;Jijirr&quot;: bird
* &quot;Munhu&quot;: grass
* &quot;Nanggurr&quot;: home/camp
* &quot;Ngalan&quot;: sun
* &quot;Thaarba&quot;: snake
* &quot;Wantharra nyundu?&quot; How are you?

<doc id="1015890" wikidata="Q513389" url="?curid=1015890" title="Ice hockey at the 1920 Summer Olympics">
<text>Ice hockey was introduced to the Olympic Games at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp. The tournament also served as the first World Championships. The matches were played between April 23 and April 29, 1920. Canada, represented by the Winnipeg Falcons, won the gold medal. The silver went to the United States and Czechoslovakia took the bronze.

==Summary==
The organizing committee for the hockey matches included Paul Loicq, the captain of the Belgian team and a future president of the Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG). The games used the Canadian ice hockey rules, and the Bergvall system to determine medal winning teams.

The Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) chose the Winnipeg Falcons as the 1920 Allan Cup champions to represent the Canada men&#x27;s national team, instead of forming a national all-star team on short notice. Canada&#x27;s manager W. A. Hewitt, introduced the CAHA rules of play to the LIHG at the Olympics. Writer Andrew Podnieks described Hewitt&#x27;s interpretation of the rules as &quot;competitive yet gentlemanly&quot;, and that the rules of play were accepted for Olympic hockey. Hewitt refereed the first Olympic hockey game played, an 8–0 win by the Sweden men&#x27;s national team versus the Belgium men&#x27;s national team, on April 23, 1920.

All matches took place in the Palais de Glace d&#x27;Anvers (ice palace of Antwerp). The rink was smaller than North American standards, measuring long by wide. All games were played with seven players per side, with the rover position being used. For the duration of each match no substitutions were permitted and if a player exited the game due to injury the opposing team was forced to take a player out as well. Additional differences from modern play included a prohibition on forward passing and the requirement that all players including the goaltender be standing on his skates to play the puck. The duration of each game was two periods of twenty minutes each. Any game tied at the end of forty minutes would be extended by two periods of five minutes each, not sudden death. If tied at the end of fifty minutes, this process would repeat—and repeat as many times as needed until a winner is declared.

This was the first ice hockey tournament at an Olympic Games, and the only ever instance of it at a Summer Olympics. An ice hockey tournament was part of the inaugural Winter Olympics in 1924 and has been part of every Winter program since then.

==Participating nations==

A total of 60 ice hockey players from 7 nations competed at the Antwerp Games:

==Format==
Seven nations entered teams in the inaugural Olympic ice hockey tournament. The tournament format used the Bergvall system, starting with an elimination round to determine the gold medal winner, after which teams that lost to the tournament winner would play through a new bracket to determine silver. Finally, teams which lost to either the gold or silver winners would face off in a third bracket to determine the bronze winner. For the gold medal round, teams were drawn into the bracket with France receiving a bye to the semifinals.

At the time of draw, the Swedish team questioned how the matchups for the later rounds would be determined and it was believed that teams advancing further in the earlier round would receive a bye. However, no decision was made and when it came time for the silver medal round Sweden and the United States were selected to play a semifinal game while Czechoslovakia received the bye. Later for the bronze medal round, organizers wanted to ensure the tournament would conclude on schedule but were reluctant to force the Czechoslovakians to play twice in one day. As a result, the Swedish team were made to play another semifinal game which would be their fourth in as many days with the bronze medal game the following day. This led to criticism of the format despite Bergvall later noting that the system was not used correctly.

<text>The Crypteroniaceae are a family of flowering trees and shrubs. The family includes 13 species in three genera, native to Indomalaya.

== Genera ==
There are three genera of Crypteroniaceae, all native to Asian tropical forests:
* &quot;Axinandra&quot; Thwaites
* &quot;Crypteronia&quot; Blume
* &quot;Dactylocladus&quot; Oliv.

The genus &quot;Axinandra&quot; includes four species, one in Sri Lanka (&quot;A. zeylanica&quot;) and the others in Borneo and the Malay Peninsula. &quot;Crypteronia&quot; includes seven species, ranging from eastern India through Southeast Asia and southern China to the Malay Peninsula, Indonesia, and New Guinea. &quot;Dactylocladus&quot; consists of a single species, native to the lowland peat swamp forests of Borneo.

== Phylogeny ==
Morphological analyses, supported by recent chloroplast DNA analysis, indicates that Crypteroniaceae are most closely related to four small myrtalean families, Penaeaceae, Oliniaceae, and Rhynchocalycaceae of southern Africa, and Alzateaceae of Central and South America. The common ancestor of these five families is thought to have originated in western Gondwana during the Cretaceous epoch, and the Crypteroniaceae were carried northward with India after the breakup of the southern supercontinent, differentiating into the three genera before India&#x27;s collision with Asia. The genera subsequently spread from India to the moist tropical forests of Southeast Asia.

<doc id="1015897" wikidata="Q7086524" url="?curid=1015897" title="Olga A. Méndez">
<text>Olga Aran Méndez (February 5, 1925 – July 29, 2009) was the first Puerto Rican woman elected to a state legislature in the United States mainland, when, in 1978, she became a member of the New York State Senate.

==Early years==
Olga Aran Méndez was born in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico.
One of eight children, she was raised on the island in a middle class and highly educated family. Her mother, Ursula Garcia Fernández (b. 1894), was heir to a substantial family fortune along with her three sisters; she died when Olga was nine years old. Olga&#x27;s father, Gonzalo Aran Soler (d. 1948), was a Clerk of the Court. His family, the Arans, were among the first French families to immigrate to Puerto Rico in the 19th century.

In 1950, Méndez received a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Puerto Rico, afterwards teaching high school chemistry on the island. In 1960, she earned her Master&#x27;s Degree in Psychology from the Teacher&#x27;s College at Columbia University. In 1975, she defended her Doctoral Dissertation in Educational Psychology and received her Ph.D from Yeshiva University.

Méndez married into a respected East Harlem political family. Her father-in-law, Antonio &quot;Tony&quot; Méndez was the first Puerto Rican district leader in Manhattan. She became involved in the fight for better government through her family members and became an active leader in the area of voter registration drives throughout the nation.

==Political career==
In 1972, Méndez was elected as a New York Delegate, committed to Senator George McGovern at the Democratic National Convention. In 1974, she was elected to the &quot;National Conference of Women&quot; in Houston, Texas.

On April 11, 1978, she was elected to the New York State Senate, to fill the vacancy caused by the election of Robert García to the U.S. Congress. She was re-elected several times, and remained in the State Senate until 2004, sitting in the 182nd, 183rd, 184th, 185th, 186th, 187th, 188th, 189th, 190th, 191st, 192nd, 193rd, 194th and 195th New York State Legislatures. Méndez was a delegate to the 1980, 1984 and 1988 Democratic National Conventions.. Méndez was a delegate to the 1980, 1984 and 1988 Democratic National Conventions. In 1984, she was chosen as Secretary of the Senate Minority Conference. In 1993, Méndez became the first Puerto Rican woman to be chosen Chairperson of the Senate Minority Conference. At times Méndez offered her political support to Republicans when doing so would have been beneficial to her district. She was often criticized by her peers for this bi-partisanship.

In December 2002, Méndez left the Democratic Party and joined the Republican Party, as she felt that &quot;she and the voters had been taken for granted by the Democrats.&quot;
Switching parties made re-election very tenuous in her heavily Democratic and majority-Hispanic district. On November 4, 2004, Méndez was heavily defeated by José M. Serrano, son of U.S. Congressman José E. Serrano, taking only 18 percent of the vote. During her final six months in office she served as the Chairwoman of the Senate Labor Committee.

==Death and legacy ==
Méndez was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1993 and underwent surgery. She said that she shared her story in order to educate others. She died after a 16-year battle at her East Harlem apartment on July 29, 2009, aged 84.

New York City&#x27;s Mayor, Michael Bloomberg, an Independent, who was both a former Democrat and a former Republican, credited Méndez with impressing upon him the &quot;importance of reaching across partisan lines to do what&#x27;s right for your constituents.&quot; Bloomberg stated the following:

==Legacy==
Among the many awards and recognitions which Méndez was awarded were the following:
*the Operation Push National Citizenship Award,
*Effective Leadership Golden Age Award
*Hunter College Presidential Medal of Honor

She was also named to the Civil Liberties Honor Roll. A public housing building which bears her name was constructed in Spanish Harlem in Manhattan.

<doc id="1015901" wikidata="Q538676" url="?curid=1015901" title="Lou Monte">
<text>Lou Monte (born Louis Scaglione; April 2, 1917 – June 12, 1989) was an Italian American singer best known for a number of best-selling, Italian-themed novelty records which he recorded for both RCA Victor and Reprise Records in the late 1950s and early 1960s, most famously &quot;Lazy Mary&quot; (1958) and the 1962/63 million-selling US single &quot;Pepino the Italian Mouse&quot;, plus the seasonal track &quot;Dominick the Donkey&quot;. He also recorded on Roulette Records, Jubilee Records, Regalia Records, Musicor Records, Laurie Records, and AFE Records.

==Early life==
Monte was born on April 2, 1917, in Manhattan to Italian immigrant parents, but his mother died when he was only two. He was raised in Lyndhurst, New Jersey, and he began performing at the age of fourteen. But success came slowly: by his own account, although he sang and played guitar in a number of clubs, he did not begin to gain a large following for about fifteen years.

==Early career==
By the early 1940s, he was performing in New York City, and he was also a headliner at several New Jersey clubs. But when World War II broke out, Monte had to put his career on hold and enlist in the Army. When he was discharged, he resumed playing in clubs, and got a break when he was hired by WAAT AM 970 in Newark, New Jersey, in 1948 to do his own show. This offered Monte a chance to refine his act and it helped him to gain a much larger audience. The station rewarded him by convincing its sister TV outlet, WATV/13, to give him some airtime.

Beginning with this exposure, Monte made a couple of recordings on local labels. Joe Carlton was an A&amp;R for RCA Victor Records and heard him performing in a spaghetti joint south of Secaucus. He enjoyed his singing style and the way he accompanied himself on the guitar. He offered him a contract with RCA Victor which lasted seven years. Joe Carlton would go on to start Carlton Records.

==Success==
Monte&#x27;s first big hit came in 1954, with the release of his version of &quot;Darktown Strutters&#x27; Ball&quot;. In 1962, Monte released his first million-seller song, &quot;Pepino the Italian Mouse&quot;, which was awarded a gold disc. Co-written by Ray Allen and Wandra Merrell and sung alternately in English and a pastiche of Calabrese, &quot;Pepino the Italian Mouse&quot; tells the humorous tale of a mischievous mouse who lives within the walls of a man&#x27;s home and who pesters him by eating his cheese, drinking his wine and frightening his girlfriend. Arranged by Joe Reisman, who was Monte&#x27;s longtime collaborator, the single is credited to Don Costa Productions. &quot;Pepino&quot; peaked at number five on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100 in mid-January and fared even better in certain markets, including Monte&#x27;s native New York City, where the single spent two weeks at number one on WABC at the end of December.

The &quot;flip side&quot; of the single featured another Italian-American hybrid novelty song called &quot;What Did Washington Say (When He Crossed The Delaware?).&quot; The song presumes that George Washington was cold, tired, hungry and without a change of underwear on his famous trip. At one point in the song, &quot;Washington&quot; complains that the pizzas his wife Martha baked were as &quot;cold as ice&quot;. His solution? &quot;Sell them to the Indians for only half the price.&quot; He then asks his boatsmen to row faster because &quot;tonight I&#x27;m posing for my picture on the dollar bill.&quot;

Monte&#x27;s other famous novelty records include &quot;Dominick the Donkey&quot;, a Christmas staple in many Italian-American households and &quot;Pepino&#x27;s Friend Pasqual (The Italian Pussy-Cat)&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Pepino&quot; followed by &quot;Paulucci, the Italian Parrot&quot; and &quot;Paul Revere&#x27;s Horse (Ba-Cha-Ca-Loop)&quot;. &quot;Lazy Mary&quot;, a remake of the Italian song &quot;Luna Mezzo Mare&quot;, tells the tale of a conversation between a young woman who wishes to be married, and her mother. The somewhat risque song mixes English and Italian verses. The two use double entendre to compare the occupations with the sexual appetites of the various suitors. It peaked at number 12 on the U.S. Pop Singles chart. &quot;Lazy Mary&quot; is routinely played during the seventh inning stretch at New York Mets games (both at Shea Stadium and now at Citi Field), immediately after &quot;Take Me Out To The Ballgame&quot;.

&quot;Dominick the Donkey&quot; has enjoyed more recent success in the UK, thanks to its extensive use on The Chris Moyles Show in reference to Newsbeat newsreader and regular show contributor Dominic Byrne during the Christmas season. During the week leading up to Christmas of 2011, the show suggested or hinted that users download the song from iTunes and Amazon. This led to the song being the number two song on iTunes between December 19–25, 2011. &quot;Dominick the Donkey&quot; reached number 3 in the midweek charts on 21 December 2011, before being confirmed at number 3 in the UK Official Christmas Chart for 2011, only beaten by the X-Factor winners (Little Mix) and a charity record by the Military Wives. Dominic the Donkey did however outsell several rival chart campaigns most notably campaigns supporting Nirvana&#x27;s rerelease of &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;, which made number 11, and unsigned YouTube blogger Alex Day, who reached number 4.

A portion of Monte&#x27;s song &quot;Skinny Lena&quot; has notably been sampled into the They Might Be Giants track &quot;Number Three.&quot;

Monte made TV appearances on syndicated programming such as &quot;The Mike Douglas Show,&quot; &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and the &quot;Merv Griffin Show.&quot;

Monte resided in Totowa, New Jersey, where his fan club was based. He contributed to the founding of the Lou Monte, Jr., leukemia laboratory at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, in memory of his son who died of the disease at age 21.

Monte&#x27;s 1971 recording &quot;I Have An Angel In Heaven&quot; was highly popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s satellite radio version of the &quot;Music Of Your Life.&quot;

Monte is interred in the Immaculate Conception Cemetery in Upper Montclair, New Jersey. After his death, his surviving son Ray continued to sing his songs in concert for some time. His son is a professional drummer who plays for many bands.

<text>Existence values are a class of economic value, reflecting the benefit people receive from knowing that a particular environmental resource, such as Antarctica, the Grand Canyon, endangered species, or any other organism or thing exists. 

Existence value is a prominent example of non-use value, as they do not require that utility be derived from direct use of the resource: the utility comes from simply knowing the resource exists. The idea was first introduced by John V. Krutilla in his essay &quot;Conservation Reconsidered.&quot; 

As the Canadian Privy Council explains , existence value is &quot;A concept used to refer to the intrinsic value of some asset, normally natural/environmental. It is the value of the benefits derived from the asset&#x27;s existence alone. For example, a tree can be valued in a number of ways, including its use value (as lumber), an existence value (simply being there), and an option value (value of things that it could be used for). Existence value is separate from the value accruing from any use or potential use of the asset.&quot;

These values are commonly measured through contingent valuation surveys and have been actionable damages in the US since . They were used in a legal assessment of damages following the Exxon Valdez oil spill.

<text>The Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya was an important mahavihara or large Buddhist monastery for Theravada Buddhism in Sri Lanka. King Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura (247–207 BCE) founded it in his capital city of Anuradhapura. Monks such as Buddhaghosa (4th to 5th century CE) and Dhammapala, who wrote commentaries on the Tipitaka and texts such as the Visuddhimagga, which are central to Theravada Buddhist doctrine, established Theravada Mahaviharan of the Tambapaṇṇiya (Pali; Sanskrit: &quot;Tāmraparṇīya&quot; or &quot;Tāmraśāṭīya&quot;) orthodoxy here. Monks living at the Mahavihara were referred to as Mahaviharavasins.

In the 5th century, the &quot;Mahavihara&quot; was possibly the most sophisticated university in southern or eastern Asia. Many international scholars visited and learned many disciplines under highly structured instruction.

==Theravada monastic groups==
===Early history===
Three subdivisions of Buddhism existed in Sri Lanka during much of Buddhism&#x27;s early history there: Mahāvihāra, Abhayagiri vihāra, and Jetavana. Mahāvihāra was the first tradition established, whereas monks who had separated from the Mahāvihāra tradition established Abhayagiri vihāra and Jetavana vihāra. According to A.K. Warder, the Indian Mahīśāsaka sect also established itself in Sri Lanka concurrently with Theravāda, into which it was later absorbed. Northern regions of Sri Lanka also seem to have been ceded to sects from India at certain times.

According to the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;, the Anuradhapura mahavihara was destroyed during sectarian conflicts with the monks of the Abhayagiri vihāra during the 4th century. These Mahayana monks incited Mahasena of Anuradhapura to destroy Anuradhapura vihāra. As a result of this, a later king expelled the Mahayanins from Sri Lanka.

The traditional Theravadin account provided by the Mahavamsa stands in contrast to the writings of the Chinese Buddhist monk Faxian, who journeyed to India and Sri Lanka in the early 5th century (between 399 and 414 CE). He first entered Sri Lanka around 406 CE and began writing about his experiences in detail. He recorded that the Mahavihara was not only intact, but housed 3000 monks. He also provides an account of a cremation at Mahavihara that he personally attended of a highly respected śramaṇa who attained the arhatship. Faxian also recorded the concurrent existence of the Abhayagiri Vihara, and that this monastery housed 5000 monks. In the 7th century CE, Xuanzang also describes the concurrent existence of both monasteries in Sri Lanka. Xuanzang wrote of two major divisions of Theravāda in Sri Lanka, referring to the Abhayagiri tradition as the &quot;Mahāyāna Sthaviras,&quot; and the Mahāvihāra tradition as the &quot;Hīnayāna Sthaviras.&quot; Xuanzang further writes, &quot;The Mahāvihāravāsins reject the Mahāyāna and practice the Hīnayāna, while the Abhayagirivihāravāsins study both Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna teachings and propagate the &quot;Tripiṭaka&quot;.&quot;

===Later history===

Some scholars have held that the rulers of Sri Lanka ensured that Theravāda remained traditional, and that this characteristic contrasts with Indian Buddhism. However, before the 12th century CE, more rulers of Sri Lanka gave support and patronage to the Abhayagiri Theravādins, and travelers such as Faxian saw the Abhayagiri Theravādins as the main Buddhist tradition in Sri Lanka.

The trend of Abhayagiri Vihara being the dominant Theravāda sect changed in the 12th century CE, when the Mahāvihāra gained the political support of King Parakkamabāhu I (1153-1186 CE), and completely abolished the Abhayagiri and Jetavana Theravāda traditions. The Theravāda monks of these two traditions were then defrocked and given the choice of either returning to the laity permanently, or attempting re-ordination under the Mahāvihāra tradition as &quot;novices&quot; (&quot;&quot;). Richard Gombrich writes that many monks from the Mahāvihāra were also defrocked:

<text>Kalau Lagau Ya, Kalaw Lagaw Ya, Kala Lagaw Ya (), or the Western Torres Strait language (also several other names, see below) is the language indigenous to the central and western Torres Strait Islands, Queensland, Australia. On some islands, it has now largely been replaced by Torres Strait Creole.

Before colonization in the 1870s–1880s, the language was the major lingua franca of the Torres Strait cultural area of Northern Cape York Australia, Torres Strait and along the coast of the Western Province/Papua New Guinea. It is still fairly widely spoken by neighbouring Papuans and by some Aboriginal Australians. How many non-first language speakers it has is unknown. It also has a &#x27;light&#x27; (simplified/foreigner) form, as well as a pidginised form. The simplified form is fairly prevalent on Badu and neighbouring Moa.

==Names==
The language is known by several names besides &quot;Kalaw Lagaw Ya&quot;, most of which (including &quot;Kalaw Lagaw Ya&quot;) are names of dialects, spelling variants, dialect variants and the like — and include translations of the English terms, &quot;Western Island Language&quot; and &quot;Central Island Language&quot;:
One term used by Eastern Islanders and neighbouring Papuans for Kala Lagaw Ya is &quot;Yagar Yagar&quot;, from the word &quot;yagar&quot; (&quot;yá&quot; &#x27;speech, etc.&#x27; + &quot;gár&quot; &#x27;sympathy clitic&#x27; (&#x27;dear&#x27;, &#x27;please&#x27;, etc.), often used by Western and Central Islanders in speech to show a sympathetic or nostalgic frame of mind.

In literature on the language the abbreviations KLY (Kalaw Lagaw Ya), KKY (Kalau Kawau Ya), KulY (Kulkalgau Ya), MY (Muwalgau Ya) and KY (Kaiwaligau Ya) are often used as abbreviations. The name &quot;Mabuiag&quot; , in English pronounced , is fairly widespread as a name for the language, this having been established by the Cambridge Expedition to Torres Strait, whose main research on the language was with Mabuiag material. Though the preferred term in English in Academia for some time was &quot;Kala Lagaw Ya&quot;, according to Ober, the form was always regarded as &quot;colloquial&quot; by native speakers. In a High Court decision on 7 August 2013, the decision was taken to officially term the language &quot;Kalau Lagau Ya&quot;, using the formal form.

When speaking to each other, speakers generally refer to the language as &quot;Langgus&quot; &#x27;language&#x27; or use phrases such as KLY/KulY &quot;ngalpudh muli&quot;, MY-KY &quot;ngalpudh/ngalpadh muli&quot;, KKY &quot;ngalpadh muliz&quot; &quot;speak(s) our language&quot;, e.g. KLY/KulY &quot;ngalpudh muuli, thanamunungu tidailai!&quot;, MY-KY &quot;ngalpudh/ngalpadh muuli, thanamuningu tidailai!&quot;, KKY &quot;ngalpadh muli, thanamulngu tidaile!&quot; &#x27;Speak in our language so they don&#x27;t understand!&#x27;. &quot;Ngalpudh/ngalpadh&quot; literally means &#x27;like us&#x27;. The construction &quot;X-dh mula+i-&quot; &#x27;speak X-like&#x27; is used to refer to speaking in a language, e.g. KKY &quot;markaidh muliz&quot; &#x27;speak [in] English&#x27;,&quot; zapanisadh muliz&quot; &#x27;speak [in] Japanese&#x27;, &quot;dhaudhalgadh muliz&quot; &#x27;speak [in] Papuan&#x27;, &quot;mœyamadh muliz&quot; &#x27;speak [in] Meriam Mìr&#x27;, &quot;thanamudh muliz&quot; &#x27;speak like them, speak [in] their language&#x27;. It is otherwise common for speakers to use nominal phrases like KLY/KulY &quot;ngalpun ya&quot;, MY-KY &quot;ngalpun/ngalpan ya&quot;, KKY &quot;ngalpan ya&quot; &#x27;our language&#x27; to refer to the language when speaking to each other.

==Geographic distribution==
Kalau Lagau Ya is spoken on the western and central islands of Torres Strait, between Papua New Guinea (&quot;Naigay Dœgam Dhaudhai&quot; &quot;North-side Mainland/Continent&quot;, also called &quot;Mœgi Dhaudhai&quot; &quot;Small Mainland/Continent&quot;, KKY &quot;Mœgina Dhaudhai&quot;) and the Australian mainland (&quot;Zey Dœgam Dhaudhai&quot; &quot;South-side Mainland/Continent&quot;, also known as &quot;Kœi Dhaudhai&quot; &quot;Big Mainland/Continent&quot;), though on some islands it has now been largely replaced by Brokan (Torres Strait Creole).

There is some folk history evidence that the language was spoken as a first language in a few villages neighbouring Torres Strait in Papua. It was also formerly spoken by the Hiámo (Hiámu, Hiáma) of Daru (Dhaaru) to the north-east of Torres Strait, who were originally settlers from Yama [Yam Island] in Torres Strait, Hiámu/Hiámo/Hiáma being a Kiwai pronunciation of Yama. The main body of the Hiámo moved to the Thursday Island group to escape the Kiwai colonisation of Daru some centuries ago.

==Classification and external comparison==
The language is classified as being part of the Pama–Nyungan languages. Mitchell regard it as a mixed language with an Australian core (PamaNyungan) and Papuan and Austronesian overlays, while Capell and Dixon classify it among the Papuan languages. The personal pronouns are typically Australian, most kin terms are Papuan, and significant sea/canoe and agricultural vocabulary is Austronesian.

Kalaw Lagaw Ya has only 6% cognation with its closest Australian neighbour, Urradhi, with a further 5% &#x27;common&#x27; vocabulary (loans of various origins) — and about 40% common vocabulary with its Papuan neighbour, Meriam Mìr. Of 279 Proto-Paman forms only 18.9% have definite realisations in Kalaw Lagaw Ya, with a further 2.5% which may be present. One word that illustrates the problems of &#x27;may-be&#x27; relationship is &quot;kùlbai&quot; (KKY &quot;kùlba&quot;) &#x27;old&#x27;, which may be a metathetic realisation of CA &quot;*bulgan&quot; &#x27;big; old&#x27;. Potentially 80% of the vocabulary of the language is non-Australian, and includes Papuan and Austronesian items. Bouckaert, Bowern and Atkinson (2018) found that Kalaw Lagaw Ya had the highest number of &#x27;unique&#x27; (that is, non-Pama-Nyungan) forms of any Australian language in their sample.

Oral tradition and cultural evidence recorded by Haddon and Laade, backed by archaeological evidence and linguistic evidence, shows that Austronesian trade and settlement in South-West Papua, Torres Strait and Cape York occurred; the languages have significant Austronesian vocabulary content, including items such as the following:
Some of the Austronesian content is clearly South-East Papuan Austronesian:
The linguistic history of the Torres Strait area is complex, and interaction of well over 2500 years has led to many layers of relationship between the local languages, including many words that are obviously common, such as the following &#x27;trade&#x27; words in Torres Strait area languages.


However, the question of external relationships of Kalaw Lagaw Ya is also complicated by resemblances between both the Paman (Pama-Nyungan, Australian languages) and the Trans-Fly (Papuan) languages. Though few, these may be significant, and include forms such as those noted below, not all of which appear in Kalaw Lagaw Ya. Such resemblances could point to a deep-level relationship dating back to before the flooding of Torres Strait at the end of the last age, as claimed by Mitchell or they could point to genetic inheritance and subsequent language contact, as discussed by Alpher, Bowern, and O&#x27;Grady 2009.
===Personal pronouns===

A comparison of the Kalaw Lagaw Ya, Meriam Mìr, Kiwai and Uradhi personal pronouns show similarities and differences in typology. In comparison to Uradhi, Kalaw Lagaw Ya has an archaic typology — or, rather, Uradhi has innovated, having lost the Common Australian 1, 2 and 3 plurals. Kiwai does not have 1–2 pronouns, while Meriam Mìr does not have a dual and trial/paucal set of pronouns which correspond to its verb system. The Kalaw Lagaw Ya system, like that of Uradhi, is Australian:


&quot;Note that except for Meriam Mìr, the Trans Fly languages also have two-gender masculine-feminine systems, though not marked on the pronouns themselves.&quot;

However, even though the system has no real surprises for Australian linguistics, it is clear that Kalaw Lagaw Ya has innovated in the 1st and 2nd pronouns, which have the following CA origins:
* CA *ngali &#x27;we, inclusive&#x27; &gt; &quot;ngœy&quot; [stem: &quot;ngœlmu-&quot; (old style singing &quot;ngalimu-, ngalemu-&quot;), &quot;ngœimu-&quot;] &#x27;we, exclusive&#x27;; and with stem extensions &quot;ngalpa&quot; &#x27;you and I/we&#x27; (old-style singing &quot;ngalipa/ngalepa&quot;), &quot;ngalbai/ngalbe&quot; &#x27;we (exclusive)&#x27;, (old style singing &quot;ngalebai/ngalibai&quot;)
* CA *ngana+pulV &#x27;we, exclusive dual&#x27; &gt; &quot;ngœba&quot; &#x27;you and I&#x27;.

The 2nd person dual and plural pronouns are based on forms that literally mean &#x27;you &#x27; (&quot;ngipel&quot;) and &#x27;you-they&#x27; (&quot;ngitha[na]&quot;), in much the same way as the demonstratives mark the dual and plural (see further below in Nominal Morphology).

==Prehistoric overview==

An examination of the various sub-systems (vocabulary, syntax, morphology) suggests the following:

;Australian (Paman)
Some basic and abstract vocabulary, all personal pronouns (inc. &quot;who&quot; and &quot;what/which&quot;), some verbs. Some grammar, such as nominal and verb morphology (subject, agent, object, genitive, -l locative, -ka dative, perfective attainative, imperfective, -i/-iz(i) perfective active. These typological categories also exist in the Trans-Fly languages; the forms in Kalaw Lagaw Ya are clearly Australian.

;Papuan (Trans-Fly)
Some basic and abstract vocabulary, some verbs. Some grammar, such as verb number and different stems for different number forms of some verbs. Use of state/movement verbs as existential and stative &#x27;be&#x27; verbs. Two non-personal pronominals: &quot;naag/naga&quot; &#x27;how&#x27;, &quot;namuith&quot; &#x27;when&#x27; (both in KKY, the dialect of the islands off the Papuan coast).

;Austronesian
Some basic vocabulary, terminology dealing with agriculture, canoes, the weather, the sky and the sea, some abstract nouns, some verbs. Possibly some grammar in the form of function words, such as &quot;waadh&quot; (KKY &quot;waaza&quot;) &#x27;existential emphasis&#x27; (i.e. &#x27;it is true that ... &#x27;), Proto Oceanic Austronesian *waDa &#x27;existential&#x27;.

The Australian word forms and structure found in Kalaw Lagaw Ya appear to be retentions, i.e. inherited; the original Australian forms appear to be unchanged at the core level. This suggests that the language is not a pidgin/creole in origin, but an Australian language which has undergone strong external lexical and grammatical influence. The language appears to be a classic case of shift, whereby speakers of one language retained multilingualism over a long period of time, absorbing aspects of another language. The Austronesian and Papuan overlays modified the Australian phonology and syntax profoundly. The contrast of Australian laminal &quot;nh/ny&quot; and &quot;lh/ly&quot; and apical &quot;n&quot; and &quot;l&quot; has been lost, voicing has become phonemic and &quot;s&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;o&quot; and &quot;òò&quot; have developed. This also affected the phonology of Australian vocabulary, where these &#x27;foreign&#x27; sounds also occur.

The non-Australian content appears to be mainly lexicon (including verbs), particularly dealing with the sea, farming, canoe and sky/weather/astrology, with possible some syntactic words. This presents a picture of a typically extensive borrowing situation with much lexical borrowing and some structural borrowing with a large amount of passive bilingualism and little active bilingualism.

Laade&#x27;s picture (1968) of Australian and Papuan settlement in Torres Strait supports the above scenario of Papuan and Austronesian speakers who shifted to an Australian language over a long period of time, the Austronesians being culturally a superstratum, however not in a position to impose their language. He presented folk history evidence that a few Austronesian traders (men) settled at Parema (north-east of Daru) and married local [Proto–Trans Fly speaking] women. To avoid further miscegenation, they soon moved and settled in Torres Strait, first to the Eastern Islands, then to the Central Islands, then to Moa, Badu and Mabuiag. At Mabuiag, Badu and Moa they found Aboriginal people, killed the men and kept the women (and presumably the children). Some moved on up to Saibai, Dœwan and Bœigu to avoid this new miscegenation, hence the lighter colour of many Saibai, Dœwan and Bœigu people. Bœigu folk history collected by Laade also shows direct East Austronesian genetic influence on Bœigu.

The social context was that of a few Austronesian men who settled on the outskirts of an East Trans-Fly group, intermarried, and whose children were either bilingual, or speakers of their mothers&#x27; language, with some knowledge of their fathers&#x27; language. The local people did not need to speak the traders&#x27; language, who in turn had to speak the local language. The children in turn would then speak the local language, with varying ability in the fathers&#x27; language, particularly in areas that were culturally important for the fathers.

These people then shifted to Torres Strait — maintaining established ties with Papua as well as with Austronesian speakers further east (this latter being suggested by various characteristics of the Austronesian content in Kalau Lagaw Ya) — and overlaid an Australian population in such a way that the majority of women spoke an Australian language, with a significant number, mainly men, who spoke a South-East Papuan Austronesian language, accompanied by their Papuan wives and their perhaps bilingual children. Over time, the core structure of the local mothers&#x27; language dominated, with retention of the newcomers&#x27; Papuo-Austronesian content in the appropriate cultural subsystems. In essence this would have been a &#x27;replay&#x27; of the original settlement by Austronesian traders at Parema, with the women understanding the language of the men, but not really needing to speak it while retaining parts of their language for significant areas. The children then created a new language shift to an Australian language with a Papuan-Austronesian admixture.

Kalaw Lagaw Ya is thus a mixed language in that a significant part of its lexicon, phonology and grammar is not Australian in origin. The core nominal, pronominal and verb morphology is Australian in both form and grammar — though a certain amount of the grammar is common to Trans-Fly and Paman languages in the first place. Some semantic categories, verb number morphology, and some other morphology are non-Australian in origin. Potentially 80% of its vocabulary is non-Australian. The interplay of the above within the subsystems of Kalaw Lagaw Ya lexicon, phonology and grammar points more to mixing through shift and borrowing rather than pidginisation and creolisation.

==Outside influences==

The language also has some vocabulary from languages outside the Torres Strait area, from the Indonesian, Malay,
Philippine, English and other &#x27;outsiders&#x27;. Where loan words from the Western Austronesian (Indonesian, etc.) loans are concerned, it is possible that some such came into the language in pre-European contact days, with the Makassans and similar fishermen/traders who visited northern Australia and Torres Strait.

Examples of post-European contact Western Austronesian loan words:
Some words in the language, assuming that they are Western Austronesian loans, appear to be pre-contact words. This is suggested by form and use in the language and in neighbouring languages (some of these words may ultimately be from Arabic and Sanskrit).
Loans from modern Eastern Austronesian (Polynesian and Melanesian) into the language are mainly of religious or &#x27;academic&#x27; use. In general, such words are terms for objects that are strictly speaking European goods. One exception is the last in the following table, which is commonly used instead of the traditional words &quot;imi&quot; &#x27;spouse&#x27;s opposite-sex sibling&#x27;, &#x27;opposite sex sibling&#x27;s spouse&#x27; and &quot;ngaubath&quot; &#x27;spouse&#x27;s same-sex sibling&#x27;, &#x27;same-sex sibling&#x27;s spouse&#x27;. These have also similarly been replaced in common usage by the English loan &quot;woman&quot; (pronounced ) in the meaning of &#x27;sister/daughter-in-law&#x27;.

Other biblical loans are from Ancient Greek, Latin and Biblical Hebrew:

Two early English loans of interest show back formation from what in the language appeared to be a plural. Most nouns (a) form the plural with an &quot;-l&quot; suffix, and (b) in the nominative-accusative singular elide the stem final vowel, thus &quot;tukuyapa-&quot; &#x27;same-sex sibling&#x27;, plural &quot;tukuyapal&quot;, nominative-accusative &quot;tukuyap&quot;. Under this model &#x27;custard-apple&#x27; became &quot;katitap&quot;, plural &quot;katitapal&quot;, and &#x27;mammy-apple&#x27; (pawpaw/papaya) became &quot;mamiyap&quot;, plural &quot;mamiyapal&quot;.

==Dialects==

There are four main dialects, two of which are on probably the verge of extinction, one (Kaiwaligau Ya) through convergence to the neighbouring Kalaw Lagaw Ya. Within the dialects there are two or more subdialects. The average mutual intelligibility rate, based on a Swadesh count, is around 97%.
*Western Torres Strait language
**Northern dialect: Kalau Kawau Ya (Kalaw Kawaw Ya)
**: Saibai (Saibai Village and Aith, also Bamaga/Seisia on Cape York), Dœwan (Dauan), Bœigu (Boigu);
**Western dialect: Kalau Lagau Ya (Kalaw Lagaw Ya)
**: Mabuyag (Mabuiag) and Badhu (Badu). The western dialect also has a simplified form, particularly on Badhu, where quite a few foreign men of Malay and South Sea Islander origin settled with their Island wives in the late 1800s and early 1900s;
**Eastern dialect (Central Island dialect, spoken by the Kulkulgal nation): Kulkalgau Ya
**: Masig, Yama, Waraber, Puruma, and associated islands, now uninhabited, such as Nagi, Tudu and Gebar;
**Southern dialect (South-West Islands): Kaiwaligau Ya [Kauraraigau Ya]
**: Muralag, Ngœrupai (alt. Ngurupai) and the other islands of the Thursday Island group, Mua (alt. Moa), Muri (Mt Adolphus — now uninhabited); Muwalgau Ya / Italgau Ya — Mua. Now converging with Kalaw Lagaw Ya.
The Southern dialect has certain characteristics that link it closely to the northern dialect, and folk history dealing with the Muralag group and Mua reflects this, in that the ancestors of the Kowrareg (the Hiámo) originally came from Dharu (Daru, to the north east of Torres Strait) — and who had previously settled on Dharu from Yama in Central Torres Strait.

Some isolect markers of the four dialects of Kalaw Lagaw Ya:

===Dialectal differences===

====Phonology====
Phonological differences between the dialects are rare, and in general sporadic. The only regular differences are the following:

==== Colloquial final unstressed vowel elision ====
Found in Kulkalgau Ya and Kaiwalgau Ya:
* &quot;maalu&quot; &#x27;sea&#x27; &gt; &quot;maal’&quot;
*&quot;waapi&quot; &#x27;fish&#x27; &gt; &quot;waap’&quot;
*&quot;thathi&quot; &#x27;father&#x27; &gt; &quot;thath’&quot;
*&quot;waaru&quot; &#x27;turtle&#x27; &gt; &quot;waar’&quot;
*&quot;ngadha&quot; &#x27;appearance, looks&#x27; &gt; &quot;ngadh’&quot;
*&quot;mœràpi&quot; &#x27;bamboo&#x27; (&quot;à&quot; shows the stressed syllable) &gt; &quot;mœràp’&quot;
*&quot;bera&quot; &#x27;rib&#x27; &gt; &quot;ber’&quot;
*&quot;kaaba&quot; &#x27;dance performance, knot in bamboo (etc.)&#x27; &gt; &quot;kaab’&quot;
*&quot;kaba&quot; &#x27;oar, paddle&#x27; &gt; &quot;&#x27;kab’&quot;

Such elision is rare or sporadic in Kalau Kawau Ya.

==== Final unstressed vowel devoicing ====
In Kalaw Lagaw Ya, such final vowels in correct language are devoiced, and deleted in colloquial language, except in a small class of words which include &quot;bera&quot; &#x27;rib&#x27;, where there is a short vowel in the stem and in which the final vowel is permanently deleted, with compensatory lengthening of the final consonant (thus &quot;berr&quot;).

Strictly speaking, the process is not final vowel devoicing, but rather stressed vowel lengthening accompanied by final vowel devoicing — except in the case of words such as &quot;bera&quot; &#x27;rib&#x27; &gt; &quot;berr&quot;, where the process is final consonant lengthening by the final vowel being &#x27;incorporated&#x27; into the consonant. Note that in the following the word-final capital letter represents a devoiced vowel:

*&quot;maalu&quot; &#x27;sea&#x27; &gt; &quot;maalU&quot; &gt; &quot;maal’&quot;
*&quot;waapi&quot; &#x27;fish&#x27; &gt; &quot;waapI&quot; &gt; &quot;waap’&quot;
*&quot;thaathi&quot; &#x27;father&#x27; &gt; &quot;thaathI&quot; &gt; &quot;thaath’&quot; (Badhu variant &quot;thath’&quot;)
*&quot;waaru&quot; &#x27;turtle&#x27; &gt; &quot;waarU&quot; &gt; &quot;waar’&quot;
*&quot;ngadha&quot; &#x27;appearance, looks&#x27; &gt; &quot;ngaadhA&quot; &gt; &quot;ngaadh’&quot;
*&quot;mœràpi&quot; &#x27;bamboo&#x27; &gt; &quot;mœrààpI&quot; &gt; &quot;mœrààp’&quot;
*&quot;bera&quot; &#x27;rib&#x27; &gt; &quot;berr&quot;
*&quot;kaba&quot; &#x27;dance performance, knot in bamboo (etc.)&#x27; &gt; &quot;kaabA&quot; &gt; &quot;kaab&quot;
*&quot;kaba&quot; &#x27;oar, paddle&#x27; &gt; &quot;kabb&quot;

In declined forms of such words, the long vowel is shortened, and the final vowel voiced, and in words like &quot;ber&quot; &#x27;rib&#x27; the final vowel often reappears:
*&quot;maalU&quot; &#x27;sea&#x27; + &quot;-ka&quot; &#x27;dative&#x27; &gt; &quot;maluka&quot;
*&quot;waapI&quot; &#x27;fish&#x27; &gt; &quot;wapika&quot;
*&quot;thaathI&quot; &#x27;father&#x27; &gt; &quot;thathika&quot;
*&quot;waarU&quot; &#x27;turtle&#x27; &gt; &quot;waruka&quot;
*&quot;ngaadhA&quot; &#x27;appearance, looks&#x27; &gt; &quot;ngadhaka&quot;
*&quot;mœrààpI&quot; &#x27;bamboo&#x27; &gt; &quot;mœràpika&quot;
*&quot;ber&quot; &#x27;rib&#x27; &gt; &quot;beraka, berka&quot;
*&quot;kaabA&quot; &#x27;dance performance, knot in bamboo (etc.)&#x27; &gt; &quot;kabaka&quot;
*&quot;kab&quot; &#x27;oar, paddle&#x27; &gt; &quot;kabaka, kabka&quot;

This vowel shortening in affixed/modified forms exists in all dialects, however the other dialects have retained contrastive length to some extent, whereas Kalaw Lagaw Ya has largely lost it for &#x27;morphophonological&#x27; length, where the stressed vowel in non-emotive words (see below) of one or two syllables is automatically lengthened in the nominative-accusative; this also applies to words of three syllables with second syllable stress (as in &quot;mœrààpI&quot; &#x27;bamboo&#x27;).

One of the very few length contrasts in the Kalaw Lagaw Ya dialect is &quot;kaaba&quot; &#x27;dance performance, knot in bamboo etc.&#x27; vs &quot;kaba, kab&quot; &#x27;paddle, oar&#x27; (Old Kaiwaligaw Ya [Kauraraigau Ya] &quot;kœRaba&quot;; &quot;œRa&quot; has regularly given short &quot;a&quot; in Kalaw Lagaw Ya in &quot;kaba, kab&quot;). Such length contrasts are more widespread in the other dialects.

The exceptions are (1) the small class or words that include &quot;ber&quot; &#x27;rib&#x27; and &quot;kab&quot; &#x27;oar, paddle&#x27;, and (2) emotive words. Emotive words are those that equate to a certain extent to diminutives in languages such as Irish, Dutch and German, where specific suffixes are added to show &#x27;diminutive&#x27; status (&quot;-ín&quot;, &quot;-je&quot; and &quot;-chen&quot;/&quot;-el&quot;/-&quot;lein&quot; respectively). Emotive words include familiar kinship terms [the equivalent of English &quot;Mum&quot;, &quot;Dad&quot; and the like] and words used in emotive contexts such as singing/poetry.

==== Final i-glide deletion ====
A small class of words in Kalau Kawau Ya do not have the final i-glide found in the other dialects, including the following:
* banana plant: KLY/KulY/KY &quot;dawai&quot;, KKY &quot;dawa&quot;
* spot, stain: KLY/KulY/KY &quot;burkui (&quot;bœrkui), KKY &quot;bœrku&quot; (&quot;burku&quot;)
* blank skink: KLY/KulY/KY &quot;mogai&quot;, KKY Saibai/Dœwan &quot;mogo&quot;, Bœigu &quot;moga&quot;
* old: KLY/KulY/KY &quot;kulbai&quot;, KKY &quot;kulba&quot;
* a short while, first before doing something else: KLY/KulY/KY &quot;mamui&quot;, KKY &quot;mamu&quot;
* birth cord: KLY/KulY/KY &quot;kùpai&quot;, KKY &quot;kùpa&quot;

Word forms in neighbouring languages as well in the Kauraraigau Ya (Kowrareg) of the mid-to-late 19th century, such as the Meriam Mìr &quot;kopor&quot; and Kauraraigau Ya &quot;kupar&quot;/&quot;kopar&quot; &#x27;birth cord&#x27; show that in such words the final &quot;-i&quot;/&quot;Ø&quot; are the modern forms of older &quot;*ɾ&quot;.

=== Syntax ===
The main syntactic differences are:

==== Verb negative construction ====
In all dialects except Kalau Kawau Ya, the verb negative is the nominalised privative form of the verbal noun. As this form in itself a noun, its subject and direct object are cast in the genitive:
* &quot;Ngath waapi purthanu&quot; &#x27;I ate a fish&#x27;
* &quot;Ngai stuwaka uzarima&quot; &#x27;I went to the store&#x27;
* &quot;Ngau wapiu purthaiginga&quot; &#x27;I didn&#x27;t eat a fish&#x27;
* &quot;Ngau stuwaka uzaraiginga&quot; &#x27;I didn&#x27;t go to the store&#x27;

The Kalau Kawau Ya dialect uses the verbal noun privative form as an invariable verb negative:
* &quot;Ngath waapi purthanu&quot; &#x27;I ate a fish&#x27;
* &quot;Ngai stuwapa uzarima&quot; &#x27;I went to the store&#x27;
* &quot;Ngath waapi purthaiginga&quot; &#x27;I didn&#x27;t eat a fish&#x27;
* &quot;Ngai stuwapa uzaraiginga&quot; &#x27;I didn&#x27;t go to the store&#x27;

==== Verb tenses/aspects ====
The Kalau Kawau Ya dialect has the tenses and aspects listed in the section on verb morphology. The other dialects have largely lost the remote future tense, using the habitual instead; the remote future in the other dialects is retained most commonly as a &#x27;future imperative&#x27;, where the imperative refers to a vague period in the future. The Kalaw Lagaw Ya dialect also has a &#x27;last night&#x27; tense, where the adverb &quot;bungil&quot;/&quot;bungel&quot; (reduced form &quot;bel&quot;) &#x27;last night&#x27; has become a verb postclitic, following the model of the adverb &quot;ngùl&quot; &#x27;yesterday&#x27;, which had previously become grammaticalised as a &#x27;recent past&#x27; tense marker in all dialects, with reduction to &quot;-ngu&quot; in Kalau Kawau Ya. In the other dialects &quot;bongel&quot; &#x27;last night&#x27; is a fully functioning temporal adverb used in conjunction with either the today past or the recent past.

The dialects differ in the forms of the following affixes:

# present imperfective/near future perfective/verbal noun dative:
#:KKY/KY -pa, KLY/KulY -ka
# Recent past
#:KKY -ngu, KLY/KY/KulY -ngul
# Today past
#:KKY/KLY/KulY -nu, KY -nul (older -nulai)
# Habitual
#:KKY -paruig/paruidh/-parui/-paru/-pu (-pu most commonly on stems of two or more syllables, and the bi-syllabic forms on stems of one syllable [the consonant final forms are emphatic forms])
#:KLY/KulY -kuruig
#:KY -kurui

==== Nominal affixes ====
The main nominal affix difference is the dative ending, which has the following forms in the various dialects:
* KLY/KulY -ka; -pa with &quot;kipa&quot; &#x27;to here&#x27;, &quot;sipa&quot; &#x27;to there&#x27;, &quot;paipa&quot; &#x27;to ahead&#x27;, &quot;pawupa&quot; &#x27;to behind, off to one side&#x27;; -pa (sometimes in poetry/singing)
* KY -pa; -ka in &quot;ngaikika&quot; &#x27;to/for/towards me&#x27;; -ka (often in poetry/singing)
* KKY -pa in all cases; -ka (often in poetry/singing)
The plural/HAVE suffix &quot;-LAI&quot; (underlying form) also shows a small amount of dialect variation with stems of two syllables, where Kulkalgau Ya differs from the other dialects in retaining the full form of the suffix &quot;-lai&quot;, reduced to 
&quot;-l&quot; in the other dialects. In stems of three or more syllables, the suffix is reduced to &quot;-l&quot; in all dialects, while retained as &quot;-lai&quot; (variants according to noun sub-class &quot;-thai&quot;, &quot;-ai&quot;, &quot;-dai&quot;) with stems of one syllable.

==== Vocabulary ====
The main differences between the dialects are to do with vocabulary, as can be seen in the following examples:
* house/building: KLY &quot;mùùdha&quot; (&quot;laaga&quot;), KulY &quot;mùdh&quot; (&quot;laag&quot;), KY &quot;laag&quot; (&quot;mùdh&quot;), KKY &quot;laag&quot;

==Phonology==

=== Consonants ===
Kala Lagaw Ya is the only Australian language to have the alveolar fricatives and . However, these have allophonic variants and , which are the norm in Australian languages (usually and but non-contrasting). These latter two are allophones in that in all environments and can appear, while and can not appear at the end of a word; note that this allophony is very similar to that of the neighbouring Papuan language Bine. All the stops, except for the alveolars and , have fricative allophones, thus can be or , can be or , or , and so on. Furthermore, it is one of the few Australian languages with fully functioning voiced-voiceless distinctions (, , , , ) — and one of the few without retroflex stops.

The language is also one of the few Australian languages with only one rhotic, one and one . The earliest recorded dialect, Kaiwalgau Ya (Kauraraigau Ya [Kowrareg]), however, did have two rhotics, the tap and the glide; the rhotic glide has in general become or zero in the other dialects (and Modern Kaiwaligau Ya), rarely . Neighbouring languages retain an in related words, such as:
* &quot;sayima&quot;, &quot;sayim&quot;, &quot;sayma&quot; &#x27;outrigger&#x27; - Kauraraigau Ya &quot;sařima&quot;, Kiwai (Papua) &quot;harima&quot;, Gudang (Australia) &quot;charima&quot;
* &quot;babath&quot; &#x27;opposite-sex sibling&#x27; - Kauraraigau Ya &quot;bœřabatha&quot; &#x27;opposite-sex sibling&#x27;, Meriam Mìr &quot;berbet&quot; &#x27;sibling&#x27;
* &quot;kupai&quot;, KKY &quot;kupa&quot; &#x27;birth cord&#x27; - Kauraraigau Ya &quot;kupař&quot;, MM &quot;kopor&quot;
However, in singing, , and are pronounced , , and , are virtually never as , and .

Note:
#The consonant varies to some extent with , particularly in KKY/KY &quot;kadai-&quot;/&quot;karai-&quot;, KLY/KulY &quot;kad[a]&quot;/&quot;kad[a]&quot;/&quot;kadai&quot;/&quot;karai&quot; &#x27;upwards&#x27;.

=== Vowels ===
Notes:
#The long vowel is only found in Kala Lagaw Ya.
#Length is to a certain extent contrastive, and partly allophonic.
#The +/-round contrast is reminiscent of Papuan phonology.
#The mid long vowels are allophonic variants of the mid short vowels that are in the process of developing phonemic status, while the short vowel is similarly in origin an allophone of .

Internal reconstruction and comparison with neighbouring languages suggests an underlying four vowel structure with contrasting vowel length, where underlying &quot;*i&quot; typically gives surface and , underlying &quot;*a&quot; typically gives surface &quot;a&quot; and &quot;œ&quot;, underlying &quot;*ò&quot; typically gives surface and , and underlying &quot;*u&quot; typically gives surface and (there are other realisations as well, depending on rules of assimilation etc.):

The language undergoes low-level vowel shifts, caused by stress domination within words and phrases. Long vowels are shortened, and short vowels raise when the word is preceded by morphemes such as adjectives, demonstrative articles, prefixes and the like; the changes also occur within words when these are suffixed:
* &quot;laag&quot; &#x27;place&#x27; — &quot;senabi lag&quot; &#x27;that place&#x27;
* &quot;lagal&quot; &#x27;places&#x27; — &quot;sethabi lœgal&quot; &#x27;those places&#x27; (also &quot;sethabi lagal&quot;)
* &quot;mœrap&quot; &#x27;bamboo&#x27; — &quot;mœrœpil&quot; &#x27;bamboo plants/poles/sticks&#x27; (also &quot;mœrapil&quot;)
* &quot;guul&quot; &#x27;sailing canoe&#x27; — &quot;senaubi gul&quot; &#x27;that canoe&#x27;
* &quot;thonaral&quot; &#x27;times&#x27; — &quot;sethabi thunaral&quot; &#x27;those times&#x27; (also &quot;sethabi thonaral&quot;)
* &quot;zageth&quot; &#x27;work&#x27; — &quot;zagithapa&quot; &#x27;to/for work [dative]&#x27; (also &quot;zagethapa&quot;) (compound of &quot;za&quot; &#x27;thing&#x27; + &quot;geth&quot; &#x27;hand&#x27;)

The processes are low-level in that they are not &#x27;automatic&#x27; — the changes do not have to occur and can be consciously &#x27;blocked&#x27;. In normal speech, vowel shortening and the change of a to œ normally occur, while the changes of e to i and o to u are sporadic, and most common in unstressed syllables.

Assimilation of vowels to other vowels in the vicinity and consonants is also widespread, particularly of the vowel œ:
* &quot;wœrab&quot; &#x27;coconut&#x27; — &quot;wurab&quot; — &quot;urab&quot;
* &quot;yœlpai&quot; &#x27;lead&#x27; [verbal noun] — &quot;yilpai&quot; — &quot;ilpai&quot;
* &quot;ngœnu&quot; &#x27;whose&#x27; — &quot;ngunu&quot;
* &quot;kœu&quot; &#x27;belonging to here&#x27; — &quot;kou&quot;
* &quot;ngœba&quot; &#x27;you and I&#x27; — &quot;ngaba&quot;

===Kauřařaigau Ya phonology===

The following summary of the phonology of Old Kauraregau Ya is compiled from MacGillivray (1852), Brierly (in Moore 1978), Ray and Haddon (1897) and Ray (1907). In general, there does not to appear to have been any great phonological difference between OKY and the modern dialects of Kalau Lagau Ya (apart from the retention of ř).

==== Stress ====
Stress appears to have been similar to that of the modern dialects, with stress patterns being most similar to that of modern Bœigu and Ngœrupai speech, the most conservative dialects in this respect. In the following the standardised forms are in bold.

===== Bisyllabic forms =====
Stress is initial:
* &quot;baba, baba, bapa&quot;: baba &#x27;dad&#x27;
* &quot;kawp&quot;: kaapu &#x27;seed&#x27;
* &quot;buai, bua, bue, booi, boy, boi, booee, boye&quot;: buwai &#x27;clan; prow&#x27;
A few forms (such as &quot;gru&quot;: gœrú &#x27;sugar cane&#x27;) show that contrastive stress existed in bisyllabic words.

===== Multisyllabic forms =====
Stress is either on the initial or second syllable:

(1) initial:
* &quot;gugure&quot;: gagaři &#x27;bow&#x27;
* &quot;myrabada&quot;: ngœiřabatha &#x27;father&#x27;s sister&#x27;
* &quot;tukiapalli&quot;: tukuyapalai &#x27;same sex sibling &#x27;
(2) second:
* &quot;bobata&quot;: bœbàtha &#x27;grandparent&#x27;
* &quot;murrag:&quot; mœřààga &#x27;sweat&#x27;
Shifted stress also appears to have occurred as in the modern dialects:
* &quot;purteipa&quot;: pùrthàipa &#x27;eat&#x27; (attainative imperfective present singular / perfective today future)
* &quot;pratipa&quot;: pùràthipa &#x27;eat&#x27; (active imperfective present singular / perfective today future)

==== Vowels and diphthongs ====
These appear to have been the same as in the modern language. Vowel length in general appeared in the same environments as in KKY, though some amount of vowel lengthening under the KLY model is evident, as in &quot;kawp&quot;: kaapu &#x27;seed&#x27;, Kalau Kawau Ya / Kulkalgau Ya &quot;kapu&quot;, Kalau Lagau Ya &quot;kaapu&quot;.

The exact extent of retention of underlying vowel length and the development of variant forms is difficult to measure, as the spelling systems used by Brierly and MacGillivray did not always mark vowel length. Further, as they obtained words through elicitation (which has a common &#x27;lengthening effect&#x27; on vowels when words are &#x27;slowed down&#x27;), there are a few cases where they marked vowel length wrongly. Ray marked vowel shortness in stressed syllables.

The various sound changes that the vowels and diphthongs undergo in the modern language also occurred in OKY. One change that occurred much more than in the modern dialects was that of &quot;ai&quot; monophthongisation to &quot;e&quot;. The resulting &quot;e&quot; then often raised to &quot;i&quot; in open unstressed syllables.

No change: 
* &quot;alai&quot;: alai &#x27;husband&#x27;, &quot;amai&quot;: amai &#x27;earth oven&#x27;
Change:
* &quot;buai, bua, bue, booi, boy, boi, booee, boye&quot;: buwai, buwe, buwi &#x27;clan, prow&#x27;
* &quot;palai, pale&quot;: palai, pale &#x27;they &#x27; 
* &quot;kowraraiga&quot;, &quot;kowrarega&quot;: kauřařaiga ~ kauřařega &#x27;islander&#x27;
* &quot;kowraraigali&quot;, &quot;kowraregale&quot;, &quot;kowrarigali&quot;: kauřařaigalai ~ kauřařegale ~ kauřařegali ~ kauřařigali &#x27;islanders&#x27;
* &quot;wapi&quot;, &quot;wawpi: waapi&quot;&#x27; &#x27;fish&#x27;: plural/proprietive &quot;wapilai&quot;, &quot;wapile&quot;, &quot;wapili&quot;
In the modern dialects, these forms are:
* clan, prow: buwai
* they : KLY,KulY,S-D palai, B,KY pale
* islander:KLY,KulY,KY-MY &quot;kaiwalaig&quot;, plural &quot;kaiwaligal&quot; / &quot;kaiwalgal&quot;, KKY &quot;kawalaig&quot;, plural &quot;kawalgal&quot;
* fish: &quot;waapi&quot;, plural &quot;wapil&quot;, KulY &quot;wapilai&quot;
The change of &quot;ai&quot; to &quot;ei&quot; appears to have been very common elsewhere in the dialect:
* &quot;adaipa, adeipa&quot;: adhaipa &#x27;go/put out&#x27; attainative perfective today future
* &quot;amaipa, ameipa&quot;: amayipa &#x27;crawl&#x27; imperfective present
* &quot;angaipa, angeipa&quot;: angaipa &#x27;carry&#x27; perfective today future
* &quot;batainga, bateinga&quot;: bathainga &#x27;tomorrow&#x27;
* &quot;baidama, beidama&quot;: baidhama &#x27;shark&#x27;
One form shows optional i insertion:

&quot;gassumu-, gassima-&quot;: gasama- ~ gasœma- ~ gasima- &#x27;catch, get&#x27;, modern dialects &quot;gasama- ~ gasœma-&quot;

===Development of &quot;ř&quot;===

OKY had one more consonant than modern WCL, transcribed &quot;ř&quot;. Though the actual pronunciation of this sound and its difference from &quot;r&quot; was not given by any early writer, it most likely was a rhotic glide , perhaps with a palatal &#x27;hue&#x27;. The loss of this sound in the other dialects (and in modern KY) occurred in the following rules; the changes were beginning to be evident already in OKY:

&quot;Ř&quot; between like vowels or in deletes.
* OKY &quot;burugo&quot; (bùřùga) &gt; modern dialects &quot;bùg&quot;, KLY &quot;bùùga&quot; &#x27;marsh fly&#x27;
* OKY &quot;sřinge, singe&quot; &gt; modern dialects &quot;singe&quot; &#x27;fish/head carrying loop&#x27;
* OKY &quot;murrag&quot; (mœřaaga) &gt; modern dialects &quot;maag&quot;, KLY &quot;maaga&quot; &#x27;sweat, film&#x27;
* OKY &quot;dura&quot; (dœřàà) &gt; modern dialects &quot;daa&quot; &#x27;chest&#x27;

&quot;Ř&quot; sporadically becomes [+hi] when in and the following syllable is stressed.
* OKY wœřàtha: KY &quot;wœyath&quot;, KLY &quot;wiyeth&quot;/&quot;wœyeth&quot;, KulY &quot;uyeth&quot;, KKY &quot;wath&quot; &#x27;year&#x27;
* OKY &quot;norat&quot; (nœřàtha): KY &quot;nœyath/nath&quot;, KLY &quot;niyath&quot;, KulY &quot;niyath&quot;, KKY &quot;nath&quot; &#x27;platform&#x27;
* OKY &quot;waraaba&quot; (wœřaba): KY &quot;uwiba&quot;, KLY &quot;wiiba&quot;, KulY &quot;wiiba&quot;, KKY &quot;waba&quot; &#x27;green dove&#x27;
* OKY &quot;karrabie&quot; (kœřaba): KY &quot;kab(a) &quot;, KLY &quot;kab&quot;, KulY &quot;kœyaba&quot;, KKY &quot;kab&quot; &#x27;paddle, oar&#x27;

&quot;Ř&quot; becomes a [+V] glide when between [-hi] and [+hi] vowels, and between [+bak] and [-bak] vowels.
* OKY &quot;mari&quot; (maaři): KLY &quot;maayi&quot;, KKY &quot;maay&quot; &#x27;pearl shell&#x27;
* OKY &quot;sarima&quot; (sařima): KLY &quot;sayim(a)&quot;, KKY &quot;sayima&quot;/&quot;sayma&quot; &#x27;outrigger float&#x27;
* OKY &quot;puri, prui&quot; (puuři, pœřuui): KLY puuyi, KKY puuy &#x27;tree, plant, magic&#x27;
* OKY &quot;mekari&quot; (mekaři): KLY &quot;mekey&quot;, KKY &quot;mekay&quot; &#x27;almond&#x27;
* OKY &quot;tituri&quot; (thithuři): KLY &quot;thithúúyi&quot;, KKY &quot;thithuy&quot; &#x27;star&#x27;
* OKY &quot;Giralaga&quot; (Giřalaga): KLY &quot;Giyalaaga&quot;, KKY &quot;Giyalag&quot; &#x27;Friday Island&#x27;
* OKY &quot;Mora&quot; (Muřa~Mořa): KLY &quot;Muwa&quot;, KKY &quot;Muwa&quot;~&quot;Mowa&quot;

&quot;Vuř&quot; becomes when intervocalic.
* OKY &quot;Maurari&quot; (Mauřaři): modern dialects &quot;Maway(i)&quot; &#x27;Wednesday Island&#x27;
* OKY &quot;tura&quot; (thuřa~thœuřa): modern dialects &quot;thœwa&quot; ~ &quot;thuwa&quot; &#x27;shortness&#x27;
&quot;Ř&quot; optionally becomes when syllable final and following [-hi] vowels; in at least two words metathesis first occurred.
* OKY &quot;kopar&quot; (kùpařa): KY,KLY,KulY &quot;kùpai&quot;, KKY &quot;kùpa&quot; &#x27;umbilical cord&#x27;
* OKY &quot;kaura&quot; (kauřa): KKY &quot;kawa,&quot; KY &gt; *kařua &gt; &quot;kawa&quot;~&quot;kaiwa&quot;, KLY,KulY &quot;kaiwa&quot; &#x27;island&#x27;
* OKY &quot;wauri&quot; (wauři): KKY &quot;wawi,&quot; KY,KLY,KulY &gt; *wařua &gt; &quot;waiwi&quot; &#x27;arm-band shell&#x27;

&quot;Ř&quot; deletes when syllable final following high vowels and non-final.
* OKY &quot;burkera&quot; (buřkera): KY &quot;bùker&quot; &#x27;hot coal&#x27;

&quot;Ř&quot; disappears when followed by unstressed &quot;i&quot; and more than one syllable.
* OKY &quot;ngörimuni&quot; (ngœřimùni): KKY,KY &quot;ngœimùn&quot;, KLY,KulY &quot;ngœlmùn&quot; &#x27;our EXC PL&#x27;
* OKY &quot;myrabat&quot; (ngœiřabatha): modern dialects &quot;ngœibath&quot; &#x27;fathers sister&#x27;
* OKY &quot;görigar, göriga&quot; (gœřigař[i]): modern dialects &quot;gœiga&quot; &#x27;sun, day&#x27;
* OKY &quot;kariki&quot; (kařiki): modern dialects &quot;kaiki&quot; &#x27;here non-specific locative&#x27;
* OKY &quot;tyariki&quot; (seřiki): modern dialects &quot;seiki&quot; &#x27;there non-specific locative&#x27;

Early spellings (e.g. &quot;möaga&quot; &#x27;sweat&#x27; and &quot;neet/naat/nöat/niet&quot; , , , &#x27;platform&#x27; show that ř disappeared first, leaving a hiatus (except in those cases where ř &gt; y~i), with reduction of and to , and to .

OKY underwent the same allophony and sound changes as the modern dialects, though z ~ dh and s ~ th variation appears to have been more general in OKY, as in the following (perhaps evidence of older allophony in the language which is now levelling out):
* &quot;zaazi&quot; &#x27;grass skirt&#x27;: Brierly &quot;juagee, djaajie, djaajie, dadjee, dadji, dadje, dadjie&quot;, MacGillivray &quot;daje&quot;, OKY zaazi, dhaazi
* &quot;sagul adhamadha ~ azamadha&quot; &#x27;be putting put on a dance!&#x27;: Brierly &quot;sagool adzamada&quot;, OKY sagul adhamadha ~ azamadha
* &quot;wœsul&quot; &#x27;dirty water&#x27;: Brierly &quot;ootzoo, oodthool&quot;, OKY uusul, uuthul
* &quot;ngœzu&quot; &#x27;my &#x27;: Brierly &quot;udthu, oldzoo, udzoo&quot;, MacGillivray &quot;udzu, udz&quot;, OKY ngœzu, ngœdhu

An instance of optional r deletion before s is also attested in the following example, unless the first i in &quot;myaichipp&quot; is a misprint or misreading of &quot;*myarchipp&quot;:

maayi-arsipa &#x27;wail, keen, weep&#x27;: Brierly &quot;myaichipp&quot;, MacGillivray &quot;maierchipa&quot;, OKY mayarsipa, mayasipa

Various forms in OKY showed metathesis of ř and r in the environment of u, i and au:
* ngauřakai ~ ngauřakazi &gt; &quot;naroka, nerawkaji&quot; &#x27;maiden&#x27; (unmarried girl), cf. KKY &quot;ngawakaz&quot;
* gœřiga ~ gœřigař &gt; &quot;gyrriegi, gurrigi, goraigor&quot; &#x27;day, sun&#x27;, cf. KKY &quot;gœiga&quot;
* puuři &gt; &quot;uperia, oopeere, ooperie, uperi, prui, upiri&quot; &#x27;magic gear/charms/produce&#x27;, cf. KKY &quot;puuy&quot;, KLY &quot;puuyi&quot;.
* &quot;rigaboo, rugabu&quot; (rugœbaw) &gt; modern dialects &quot;wœrugœbaw, urugœbaw&quot;, Bœigu &quot;wœrigœbaw, urigœbaw&quot; &#x27;sweet potato&#x27;, lit. &quot;wœru-gabaw&quot; &#x27;cord/string-cultivated yam&#x27;

=== Syllabification ===
Syllabification occurred as in the modern dialects, with the addition of ř also attested as a syllable final consonant. One word was recorded by Brierly and MacGillivray with a [+nas][-son] cluster, namely &quot;enti&quot; &#x27;spider&#x27;, however this appears to be a confusion; &quot;enti&quot; is probably Gudang (Australia) &quot;ant[h]i&quot; &#x27;sore&#x27;.

Syllables were vowel final or end in r, ř, l, glide i or glide u. Otherwise surface syllable final consonants have an underlying following vowel, in which case all consonants could be syllable initial.

==Orthography==

There is no strict standard spelling, and three slightly different orthographies (and often mixes of them) are in use.

=== Mission Spelling ===
The Mission Spelling (established at first by Loyalty Islands missionaries in the 1870s, then modified by Polynesian missionaries in the 1880s): &quot;a, b, d, e, g, i, j, k, l, m, n, ng, o, ö, p, r, s, t, u, z&quot;, sometimes also &quot;th, dh, dth, tr, dr, oe, ë, w, y, j&quot;, and sometimes double vowels to show length. This spelling system was based on that used for the Drehu (Lifu) language, though later with the change to Polynesian mission staff, as well as the growing number of indigenous Torres Strait missionaries, the overtly Drehu forms &quot;tr&quot;, &quot;dr&quot; and &quot;ë&quot; were lost; these had no phonological basis in Kalaw Lagaw Ya. The mission system is used in the &quot;Reports of the Cambridge Expedition to the Torres Strait&quot; (Haddon et al., 1898 and on, University of Cambridge) and in &quot;Myths and Legends of Torres Strait&quot; (Lawrie, University of Queensland, 1971). Ray, the linguist of the Cambridge Expedition, also used various diacritics to represent short vowels and vowel quality.

=== Klokheid and Bani ===
Established in the 1970s: &quot;a&quot;, &quot;aa&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot; (alveolar), &quot;dh&quot; (dental), &quot;e&quot;, &quot;ee&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;ii&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;ng&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;oo&quot;,&quot;oe&quot; (), &quot;ooe&quot; (), &quot;p&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;t&quot; (alveolar), &quot;th&quot; (dental), &quot;u&quot;, &quot;uu&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;

=== Saibai, Boigu, Dauan students ===
Established in the late 1970s: &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot; (alveolar), &quot;dh&quot; (dental), &quot;e&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;ng&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;oe&quot; (), &quot;p&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;t&quot; (alveolar), &quot;th&quot; (dental), &quot;u&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot; (vowel length, though it exists, is rarely represented).

People not only use these three slightly differing spelling systems, but also write words more or less as they pronounce them. Words are therefore often spelt in various ways, for example &quot;sena/sina&quot; &#x27;that, there&#x27;, &quot;kothai/kothay/kothei/kothey/kothe&quot; &#x27;back of head, occiput&#x27;. Such variation depends on age, family, island, village and other factors such as poetic speech. It can be difficult at times to decide which is most correct — different people have different opinions (and sometimes have very strong opinions).
In general the pronunciation of older people has priority; however, some people can actually get quite offended if they think the language is written the &#x27;wrong&#x27; way. Some insist that the mission spelling should be used, others the Bani spelling, and still others the KKY (Saibai etc.) spelling, and still again others use mixes of two or three, or adaptations thereof. Some writers of the Mabuiag-Badhu dialect (Kalaw Lagaw Ya), for example, write mainly in the Mission system, sometimes use the digraphs &quot;oe&quot;, &quot;th&quot;, &quot;dh&quot; (variant &quot;dth&quot;) and sometimes use capital letters at the ends of words to show devoiced vowels, such as &quot;ngukI&quot; &#x27;fresh water/drinking water, fruit juice&#x27; . In the Bani/Klokheid orthograophy &quot;nguki&quot; is written &quot;nguuki&quot;, and in the other dialects the final vowel is either fully voiced, &quot;nguki&quot; ), or elided, &quot;nguk&quot; ).

The biggest bone of contention between the advocates of the &#x27;modern&#x27; orthographies and the &#x27;traditionalist&#x27; orthographies is the use of &quot;w&quot; and &quot;y&quot; to show the semi-vowels. In general native speakers in literacy classes seem to find &quot;y&quot; and &quot;w&quot; very difficult to learn, and that &quot;u&quot; and &quot;i&quot; are the &#x27;logical&#x27; letters to use. Syllabification of words by untrained speakers suggests that &quot;u&quot; and &quot;i&quot; are really the underlying sounds. Thus, a word like &quot;dhaudhai&quot;/&quot;dhawdhay&quot; &#x27;mainland, continent&#x27; syllabifies as &quot;dha-u-dha-i&quot;, not &quot;dhau-dhai&quot;. In songs, the glide-&quot;u&quot;/&quot;i&quot; can also be given full syllable status. Historical considerations also point to the semi-vowels often being vocalic rather than consonantal. Thus, &quot;lagau&quot;, the genitive of &quot;laag[a]&quot; &#x27;place&#x27; is in underlying form &lt;laaga+ngu&gt;; the full form of the genitive ending &quot;-ngu&quot; is only retained where the nominal has a monosyllabic stem (see the section on Nominal Morphology). Similarly, verbal nouns end in &quot;-i&quot;, e.g. &quot;lumai&quot;, stem &quot;luuma-&quot; &#x27;search, look for, seek, hunt&#x27;. The mid-19th century to early 20th century records of Kauaraigau Ya show that the verbal noun ending was previously &quot;-ri&quot; (thus &quot;lumari&quot;), where the &quot;-r-&quot; was presumably the rhotic glide rather than the rhotic tap/trill.

A dictionary now in preparation (Mitchell/Ober) uses an orthography based on detailed study of the surface and underlying phonology of the language, as well as on observation of how people write in real life situations. It is a mix of the Mission and Kalau Kawau Ya orthographies with the addition of diacritics (the letters in brackets) to aid correct pronunciation, since many of the people who will use this dictionary will not be speakers of the language:

&quot;a (á), b, d, dh, e (é), g, i (í), k, l, m, n, ng, o (ó, ò, òò), œ (œ&#x27;), r, s, t, th, u (ú, ù), w, y, z&quot;

Within this orthography, &quot;w&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are treated as consonants — this is their phonological status in the language — while &quot;u&quot; and &quot;i&quot; are used as the glides where phonological considerations show that the &#x27;diphthong&#x27; combination has vocalic status.

The typewritten forms of &quot;œ&quot; and &quot;œœ&quot; are &quot;oe&quot; and &quot;ooe&quot;.

===Pronunciation of the letters===

The English pronunciations given in the list below are those of Australian English, and are only meant as a guide. The letters in square brackets () are the IPA.

* r [r] similar to &#x27;tt&#x27; in &quot;better&quot; when said fast (that is to say, when said as &quot;bedder&quot;). Before another consonant and at the end of a word, it is often trilled (like in &#x27;stage&#x27; Scottish English or &#x27;rr&#x27; in Spanish). In singing, however, it is normally pronounced much like the American English &#x27;r&#x27; — &quot;ári&quot; &#x27;rain, louse&#x27;, &quot;rùg&quot; &#x27;rag, piece of cloth&#x27;, &quot;ár&quot; &#x27;dawn&#x27;
* s most commonly like English &#x27;s&#x27; in &quot;sister&quot;; sometimes like English &#x27;ch&#x27; in &quot;chew&quot; when at the beginning of a word or in the middle of a word; never like &#x27;s&#x27; in &#x27;as&#x27; (which is a &#x27;z&#x27; sound) — &quot;sas&quot; &#x27;style, showing off&#x27;, &quot;sisi&quot; &#x27;gecko&#x27;, &quot;sagul &#x27;game&quot;, fun, dance&#x27;

* th similar to t, but with the tip of the tongue put against the top teeth — &quot;tha&quot; &#x27;crocodile tail&#x27;, &quot;thathi&quot; &#x27;father&#x27;, &quot;geth&quot; &#x27;hand&#x27;
* u (short) short &#x27;u&#x27; as in &quot;lute&quot; — &quot;buthu&quot; &#x27;sand&#x27;, &quot;gulai&quot;, KLY &quot;gulal&quot; &#x27;sailing canoes&#x27;
* u, ú (long) (uu in the Bani orth.) &#x27;oo&#x27; in &quot;woo&quot; — &quot;búzar&quot; &#x27;fat, blubber&#x27;, &quot;thu&quot; &#x27;smoke&#x27;
* ù &#x27;u&#x27; as in &quot;put&quot; — &quot;mùdh&quot; &#x27;shelter, haven, back-yard, camp&#x27;, &quot;kùt&quot; &#x27;late afternoon, early evening&#x27;, &quot;kùlai&quot; &#x27;first, before&#x27;
* w not as strong as English &#x27;w&#x27; in &quot;we&quot; ; for most speakers of the language the only difference between w and short u is that w is shorter — &quot;wa&quot; &#x27;yes&#x27;, &quot;kawa&quot; &#x27;island&#x27;, &quot;báw&quot; &#x27;wave&#x27;
* y not as strong as English &#x27;y&#x27; in &quot;yes&quot;; for most speakers of the language the only difference between y and short i is that y is much shorter — &quot;ya&quot; &#x27;speech, talk, language&#x27;, &quot;aye&quot;, KKY &quot;aya&quot; &#x27;come!&#x27;, &quot;máy&quot; &#x27;well, spring; tears; pearl-shell, nacre&#x27;
* z most commonly like English &#x27;z&#x27; in &quot;zoo&quot;, or English &#x27;s&#x27; in &quot;has&quot;; sometimes like English &#x27;j&#x27; in &quot;jump&quot;, or &#x27;dg&#x27; in &quot;budge&quot; when at the beginning or in the middle of a word — &quot;zázi&quot; &#x27;grass skirt&#x27;, &quot;za&quot; &#x27;thing, object&#x27;, &quot;zizi&quot; &#x27;crackle, crack, rustling noise&#x27;

Combinations of vowels (&#x27;diphthongs&#x27;, such as &quot;ai&quot;, &quot;au&quot;, &quot;œi&quot;, &quot;eu&quot; etc.) are pronounced as written. Thus, for example, &quot;ai&quot; is &quot;a-i&quot; (basically very similar to &#x27;i&#x27; in &#x27;mine&#x27; with a posh accent). In singing and sometimes in slow speech, such vowel combinations can be said separately. In the Bani and Saibai (etc.) orthographies, the last elements can be written as &quot;y&quot; and &quot;w&quot; instead of &quot;i&quot; and &quot;u&quot;. The diphthongs are:
* ei/ey — &quot;sei&quot;, &quot;sey&quot; &#x27;there&#x27;
* iu/iw — &quot;biuni&quot;, &quot;biwni&quot; &#x27;kookoobuura, kingfisher&#x27;
* œi/œy — &quot;bœi&quot;, &quot;bœy&quot; &#x27;coconut frond&#x27;
* eu/ew — &quot;seu&quot;, &quot;sew&quot; &#x27;belonging to there&#x27;
* ai/ay — &quot;Saibai&quot;, &quot;Saybay&quot; &#x27;Saibai&#x27;
* œu/œw — &quot;kœubu&quot;, &quot;kœwbu&quot; &#x27;battle, war&#x27;
* òi/oy — &quot;òi&quot;, &quot;oy&quot; &#x27;hoy!, hey!&#x27; (reply to a call, vocative particle)
* au/aw — &quot;kaub&quot;, &quot;kawb&quot; &#x27;tiredness&#x27;
* ui/uy — &quot;mui&quot;, &quot;muy&quot; &#x27;fire&#x27;
* ou/ow — &quot;berou&quot;, &quot;berow&quot; &#x27;of a/the rib&#x27;

==Grammar==

===Nominal morphology===
Where the morphology is concerned, the language is somewhere along the continuum between agglutinative and fusional. Nominals have the following cases: nominative, accusative, instrumental (subsumes ergative), dative (subsumes allative, purposive), ablative (subsumes elative, avoidative), specific locative, nonspecific locative (subsumes perlative and comitative) and global locative. Nominals also have the following derived forms: privative, similative, resultative and proprietive, which also forms the noun nominative-accusative plural. All stems end in a vowel or a semi-vowel, except for a few monosyllables ending in -r and -l (which includes the very few reduplicated words, like &quot;tharthar&quot; &#x27;boiling, seething&#x27;, as well as &quot;ngipel&quot; &#x27;you &#x27; [a compound of &quot;ngi&quot; &#x27;you singular&#x27; and &quot;-pal&quot; &#x27;two&#x27;]). For many nouns the surface nominative(-accusative) undergoes a final stem-vowel deletion rule; in the Kalaw Lagaw Ya dialect the rule results in final devoiced vowels accompanied by main vowel lengthening. There are three numbers, singular, dual and plural. Singular and dual are the same form in all nominals except the personal pronouns. Furthermore, the plural is only distinguished in the nominative-accusative — except for the personal pronouns, where the difference in number is shown by the stem.

There are two nominal classes, Common Nominals (common nouns, demonstratives, locative/temporal/etc. adverbs) and Proper Nominals (Proper names [personal names, boat names, emotive kinship terms], pronouns). The major difference between the two classes are 1) semantic — Proper nominals have pronominal characteristics, and, 2) declensional, for example Proper Nominals have one locative case rather than the three of Common Nominals.

==== Common nominal declensions ====
Note that the following are in the Kalau Kawau Ya dialect.

===Irregular nouns===

There are few irregular nouns, the most common being:
# &quot;ai&quot; &#x27;food&#x27;, &quot;ya&quot; &#x27;speech, language, message, etc.&#x27;, &quot;li&quot; &#x27;basket&#x27;, &quot;lu&quot; &#x27;mound, bump, hump&#x27; (instrumental &quot;aidu&quot;, &quot;yadu&quot;, &quot;lidu&quot;, &quot;ludu&quot;; specific locative/proprietive-plural &quot;aidai/aide&quot;, &quot;yadai&quot;, &quot;lidai&quot;, &quot;ludai&quot;)
# KKY &quot;na&quot;, KLY &quot;naawu&quot;, KulY/KY &quot;nawu&quot; &#x27;song&#x27;; KKY &quot;yu&quot; &#x27;drying rack, cooking rack&#x27; (other dialects &quot;nuuwa&quot;, &quot;nu&quot;); specific locative/proprietive-plural KKY &quot;nathai&quot;, KLY/KY &quot;nawul&quot;, KulY &quot;nawlai&quot;; KKY &quot;yuthai&quot; (other dialects &quot;nuwanu&quot;, &quot;nuwa&quot;; &quot;nuwal&quot;, KulY &quot;nuwalai&quot;))
# &quot;za&quot; &#x27;thing, object, matter, etc.&#x27; This word has a fuller stem form, &quot;zapu-&quot;, which appears in certain forms: instrumental &quot;zapun&quot;; genitive &quot;zapu&quot;; proprietive-plural &quot;zapul&quot;. In the locative forms both stems (&quot;za-&quot; and &quot;zapu-&quot;) appear: specific locative &quot;zanu&quot;, &quot;zapunu&quot;, etc.
# &quot;gœiga&quot; &#x27;sun, day&#x27;; &quot;bireg/bereg&quot; &#x27;shelf&#x27;. The stems of these words have different forms to the nominative-accusative: &quot;gœiga&quot; — stem: &quot;gœigœyi-&quot;, &quot;gœigi-&quot;; &quot;bireg/bereg&quot; — stem: &quot;bœreigi-&quot;, &quot;biregi-&quot;
# &quot;dœgam&quot;, KLK &quot;dœgaamu&quot; &#x27;side, direction, point of compass, aspect&#x27;. This word has two stem forms, in free variation: &quot;dœgamu-&quot;, &quot;daguma-&quot;

===Demonstratives===

The language has a closed class of demonstrative morphemes with special morphological characteristics:
;Prefixes
* &quot;pi-&quot;, &quot;pe-&quot; &#x27;there in the distance in a specific position&#x27;
* &quot;kai-&quot; &#x27;there in the distance in a non-specific position&#x27;
;Stems
* &quot;ka-&quot;, &quot;kawu-/kawa-&quot; (non-specific), &quot;í-&quot; (specific) &#x27;here, this&#x27;
* &quot;se-&quot;, &quot;si-&quot;, &quot;sewu-/sewa-&quot; &#x27;there, that (not too far away)&#x27;
* &quot;-gu&quot;, KKY &quot;-gui&quot;, &quot;-mulu&quot; (KKY &quot;-ngùl&quot; in combined forms) &#x27;down there&#x27;
* &quot;-ka&quot;, &quot;-karai/-kadai&quot; &#x27;up there&#x27; (variant forms of the one underlying stem)
* &quot;-ngapa&quot; &#x27;there beyond&#x27;, &#x27;there on the other side&#x27;
* &quot;-pai&quot;, &quot;-pa&quot;, &quot;-paipa&quot; &#x27;ahead there, up close there&#x27; (variant forms of the one underlying stem &quot;-pai&quot;), MY &quot;-kupai&quot;, KY also &quot;-kudhai&quot;
* &quot;-pun[i]&quot;, &quot;-puwa&quot; &#x27;off from there, back from there, back over there, back there&#x27; (possibly variant forms of the one underlying stem)

The Kauřařaigau Ya forms recorded are the same as in the modern dialects, with the exception of &quot;ka-&quot;/&quot;kařu-&quot; &#x27;non-specific here, this&#x27;, &quot;se-&quot;/&quot;si-&quot;/&quot;seřu-&quot; &#x27;there, that&#x27;, &quot;kařa-&quot; &#x27;non-specific yonder&#x27;, modern dialects &quot;kai-&quot;, %&quot;ka-&quot; and &quot;-puwai&quot; &#x27;ahead there&#x27;, modern dialects &quot;-pai&quot;/&quot;-pa&quot;.

These demonstratives can take masculine, feminine and non-singular morphology (as such are pronominal) as well as case forms. &quot;Í-&quot; &#x27;here, this&#x27; and &quot;se/si-&quot; &#x27;there, that (not too far away)&#x27; take the gender/number morphemes as suffixes, and the other demonstratives take them as prefixes. Note that &quot;ka-&quot; &#x27;non-specifically here&#x27; and &quot;kai-&quot; &#x27;there in the distance in a non-specific position&#x27; cannot appear with the gender/number morphemes, these latter being specific. &quot;Í-&quot; and &quot;se/si-&quot; also take an article forming affix &quot;-bi&quot; to become demonstrative articles (e.g. KLY &quot;senuubi kaazi&quot;, KKY &quot;senaubi kaz&quot; &#x27;that boy&#x27;, KLY &quot;senaabi kaazi&quot;, KKY &quot;senabi kaz&quot; &#x27;that girl&#x27;, KLY &quot;sepalab kaazi&quot;, KKY &quot;sepalbi kaz&quot; &#x27;those two children&#x27;, &quot;sethabi kœzil&quot; &#x27;those children&#x27;); &quot;kedha&quot; &#x27;like this/that, thus&#x27; can also take this suffix (e.g. &quot;kedhabi puy&quot; &#x27;such a tree&#x27;).


===Pronouns===

The personal pronouns are three-way nominative-ergative-accusative in declension. Note that the third person pronouns are also used as definite articles, e.g. &quot;Nuidh garkœzin nan yipkaz imadhin&quot; &#x27;The man saw the woman&#x27;.

==== Dual pronouns ====
The dual and plural pronouns are nominative-accusative, the accusative being the same in form as the genitive, except in KKY, where the accusative is unmarked.

&quot;Ngawal&quot; &#x27;who &#x27; is constructed from &quot;nga&quot; &#x27;who&#x27; plus the clitic &quot;-wal&quot; &#x27;both (dual conjunction)&#x27;.

==== Plural pronouns ====
&quot;Ngaya&quot; &#x27;who many&#x27; is constructed from &quot;nga&quot; &#x27;who&#x27; plus the clitic &quot;-ya&quot; &#x27;and others (plural conjunction)&#x27;.

===Personal names and familiar kinship terms===

&quot;Familiar kinship terms are the equivalent of English kin terms such as Dad and Mum, while non-familiar terms are the equivalent of Father and Mother; these latter are treated as common nouns in the language.&quot;

===Kauřařaigau Ya nominal morphology===

The earliest grammatical records of the language are those of the mid-1800s Kauřařaigau Ya dialect. This dialect is identical to the modern dialects, apart from having more archaic forms of some endings and suffixes as well as stem forms.

==== Kauřařaigau Ya pronouns ====
Brierly (B), MacGillivray (M) and Ray (R) recorded the following forms of the singular pronouns of OKY:

;Nominative
* 1st — Brierly &quot;gni, ngi&quot;; Macgillivray &quot;ngai&quot;; Ray &quot;ngai&quot;
* 2nd — Macgillivray &quot;ngi&quot;; Ray &quot;ngi&quot;
* 3rd masculine — Macgillivray &quot;nue&quot;; Ray &quot;nui&quot;
* 3rd feminine — Macgillivray &quot;na, nga&quot;; Ray &quot;na&quot;
* &#x27;who&#x27; — Brierly &quot;gua&quot;; Macgillivray &quot;nga&quot;; Ray &quot;nga&quot;

* 3rd masculine — Brierly &quot;nooide&quot; ; MacGillivray &quot;nudu&quot;; Ray &quot;nuida, nuidö, nuid&quot;
* 3rd feminine — Macgillivray &quot;nadu&quot;; Ray &quot;nada, nadö, nad&quot;
* &#x27;who&#x27; — Macgillivray &quot;ngadu&quot;; Ray &quot;ngada, ngadö, ngad&quot;
* &#x27;what&#x27; — Brierly &quot;meedan&quot;; Macgillivray &quot;mida&quot;; Ray &quot;mida, midö, mid&quot;
;Genitive
* 1st — Brierly &quot;ngau, gnau, ngow&quot; masculine, &quot;udthu, oldzoo, udzoo&quot; feminine; Macgillivray &quot;ngow&quot; masculine, &quot;udzu, udz&quot; feminine; Ray &quot;ngau&quot; masculine, &quot;ngazu, nguzu&quot; feminine
* 2nd — Brierly &quot;gnee, ye noo, yeenow, niu, yenoo, meeno&quot;; MacGillivray &quot;yinu&quot;; Ray &quot;nginu&quot;
* 3rd masculine — Brierly &quot;noonoo&quot;; Ray &quot;nungu&quot;
* 3rd feminine — Macgillivray &quot;nanue&quot;; Ray &quot;nanu&quot;
* &#x27;who&#x27; — Ray &quot;ngunu&quot;
* &#x27;what&#x27; — not recorded
Based on the above forms and the modern dialects, the OKY pronouns are reconstructed as follows:

The accusatives, the ablatives and imitatives underwent optional final vowel deletion, while the ergatives optionally transformed the final u to a or œ, or deleted it, thus ngathu &gt; ngatha &gt; ngathœ &gt; ngath.

The recorded dual-plural forms are:

;Nominative-Ergative-Instrumental
* 1st Dual Exclusive — MacGillivray &quot;albei&quot;; Ray &quot;ngalbai&quot;
* 1st Dual Inclusive — MacGillivray &quot;aba&quot;; Ray &quot;ngaba&quot;
* 2nd Dual — MacGillivray &quot;ngipel&quot;; Ray &quot;ngipel&quot;
* 3rd Dual — MacGillivray &quot;pale&quot;; Ray &quot;palai&quot;
* &#x27;who&#x27; Dual — Ray &quot;nga wal&quot;
* 1st Plural Exclusive — Brierly &quot;ari, churri&quot;; MacGillivray &quot;arri, uri&quot;; Ray &quot;ngöi&quot;
* 1st Plural Inclusive — Brierly &quot;alpa&quot;; MacGillivray &quot;alpa&quot;; Ray &quot;ngalpa&quot;
* 2nd Plural — MacGillivray &quot;ngi-tana&quot;; Ray &quot;ngita&quot;
* 3rd Plural — MacGillivray &quot;tana&quot;; Ray &quot;tana&quot;

;Accusative-Genitive
* 1st Dual Exclusive — Brierly &quot;abonnie, abuni, abani, aboni&quot;; MacGillivray N/A; Ray &quot;ngalbaini&quot;
* 1st Dual Inclusive — Brierly N/A; MacGillivray &quot;abane, abeine&quot;; Ray &quot;ngabani&quot;
* 2nd Dual — Brierly N/A; MacGillivray &quot;ngipeine&quot;; Ray &quot;ngipeni&quot;
* 3rd Dual — Brierly N/A; MacGillivray &quot;palaman&quot;; Ray &quot;palamuni&quot;
* 1st Plural Exclusive — Brierly &quot;areen&quot;; MacGillivray &quot;arrien&quot;; Ray &quot;ngöimunu&quot;
* 1st Plural Inclusive — Ray &quot;ngalpanu&quot;
* 2nd Plural — MacGillivray &quot;ngitanaman&quot;; Ray &quot;ngitamunu&quot;
* 3rd Plural — MacGillivray &quot;tanaman&quot;; Ray &quot;tanamunu&quot;

;Dative

* 1st Dual Exclusive: MacGillivray &quot;albi nipa&quot;; Ray &quot;ngalbainipa&quot;
* 1st Dual Inclusive: MacGillivray &quot;albynape&quot;; Ray &quot;ngabanipa&quot;
* 2nd Dual: Ray &quot;ngipenipa&quot;
* 3rd Dual: MacGillivray &quot;pale nipa&quot;; Ray &quot;palamunipa&quot;
* 1st Plural Exclusive: MacGillivray &quot;arri nipa&quot;; Ray &quot;ngöinipa, ngöimunipa&quot;
* 1st Plural Inclusive: Ray &quot;ngalpanipa, ngalpamunipa &quot;
* 2nd Plural: Ray &quot;ngitanipa, ngitamunipa&quot;
* 3rd Plural: MacGillivray &quot;tane nipa&quot;; Ray &quot;tananipa, tanamunipa&quot;

;Ablative
* recorded by Ray as &quot;-[mu]nunguzi&quot;

These can be reconstructed as:

* &#x27;Who&#x27; in the dual nominative-accusative (and optionally in the ergative-instrumental) had the forms &quot;ngawal&quot; (dual) and &quot;ngaya&quot; (plural).
* Mi- &#x27;what, which&#x27; was used in much the same way as in the modern dialects.

===Verb morphology===

Verbs can have over 100 different aspect, tense, voice, mood and number forms. Verb agreement is with the object (i.e. &#x27;ergative&#x27;) in transitive clauses, and with the subject in intransitive clauses. Imperatives, on the other hand, agree with both subject and object in transitive clauses.

There are three aspects (&#x27;perfective&#x27;, &#x27;imperfective&#x27;, &#x27;habitual&#x27;), two telicity forms (&#x27;active&#x27;, which focuses on the verb activity and subsumes many intransitives, many antipassives and some transitives, and &#x27;attainative&#x27;, which subsumes many transitives, some antipassives and some intransitives), two moods (&#x27;non-imperative&#x27; and &#x27;imperative&#x27; [which resembles a subjunctive in some uses]), 6 tenses (&#x27;remote future&#x27;, &#x27;today/near future&#x27;, &#x27;present&#x27;, &#x27;today past&#x27;, &#x27;recent past&#x27;, &#x27;remote past&#x27; — KLY has developed a 7th tense, a &#x27;last night&#x27; tense) and four numbers (&#x27;singular&#x27;, &#x27;dual&#x27;, &#x27;specific plural&#x27;, &#x27;animate active plural&#x27; — in form the animate active plural is the same as the singular, and is only found on certain verbs).

In most descriptions of the language the active and attainative forms have been mistermed transitive and intransitive respectively. Transitive, intransitive, passive, antipassive and &#x27;antipassive passive&#x27; in the language are syntactic categories, and are formed by the interplay of nominal and verbal morphology, clause/sentence-level characteristics such as word-order, and semantic considerations.

Verb morphology consists of prefixes (aspect, positioning, etc.), suffixes (telicity, number, and two fossilised multiplicative/causative suffixes) and endings (tense, aspect and mood, and a very limited extent number and telicity). The structural matrix of the verb is as follows. Note that the two fossilised suffixes are mutually exclusive; if a suffix is in the A slot, a suffix cannot appear in the B slot, and vice versa:

(prefix) + (prefix) + stem (+FOSSILISED SUFFIX A) + (TELICITY) (+FOSSILISED SUFFIX B) + (number) + ending (+ending)

Examples:
* &quot;pabalkabuthamadhin&quot; &#x27;two were laid down across something&#x27; [which would be clear in the context]
* &quot;pabalkabuthemadhin&quot; &#x27;two lay down (laid themselves down) across something&#x27; [which would be clear in the context]
:: prefix: &quot;pa-&quot; &#x27;telic prefix&#x27;
:: prefix: &quot;bal-&quot; &#x27;positional — across&#x27;
:: stem: &quot;kabutha-&quot; &#x27;place, lay&#x27;
:: telicity suffix: &quot;-Ø&quot; &#x27;attainative&#x27;, &quot;-i&quot; &#x27;active&#x27;
:: number suffix: &quot;-ma&quot; &#x27;dual&#x27; (absolutive agreement)
:: tense-aspect-mood ending: &quot;-dhin&quot; &#x27;remote past perfective&#x27;
* &quot;garwœidhamemanu&quot; &#x27;two met each other earlier today&#x27;
:: prefix: &quot;gar-&quot; &#x27;collective&#x27;
:: stem: &quot;wœidha-&quot; &#x27;place, put&#x27;
:: Fossilised suffix: &quot;ma&quot; &#x27;intensive&#x27;
:: telicity suffix: &quot;i&quot; &#x27;active&#x27;
:: number suffix: &quot;ma&quot; &#x27;dual&#x27;
:: tense-aspect-mood ending: &quot;dhin&quot; &#x27;remote past perfective&#x27;

===Sample verb declension===
The verb here is &quot;íma-&quot; &#x27;see, observe, supervise, examine, try, test&#x27;



===Kauřařaigau Ya verbal morphology===

Prefixes

These were the same as in the modern dialects.

Suffixes

The only suffix differences with the modern dialects were in the form of the plural and verbal noun suffixes. In OKY these were maři and ři respectively. The dual was ngauma on ma- &#x27;take, give, move etc.&#x27; and otherwise uma.

Class 1: wœidha- &#x27;put, place, cook&#x27;
* wœidhamařinu attainative perfective present plural object
* wœidhaumanu attainative perfective present dual object
* wœidhemařinu active perfective present plural subject
* wœidheumanu active perfective present dual subject
* wœidhàři verbal noun

Class 2: ni-, niya- &#x27;sit, stay&#x27;
* niyamařipa[ri] imperfective present plural
* niyaumapa[ri] imperfective present dual
* niyàři, niyài verbal noun

Verb endings

On the whole, the OKY verb seems to have been declined like the Kalau Lagau Ya verb. This includes the loss of the suffix ma in the intransitive imperfective present/perfective today future singular. This loss, however, appears to have been optional in the today past equivalent:
* OKY &quot;daneipa&quot; (danaipa) &#x27;rise (sun)&#x27; (MacGillivray): KLY &quot;danaika&quot;, KKY &quot;danamipa&quot; &#x27;rise (sun, etc.), load (self) up&#x27; present imperfective
* OKY &quot;dadeipa&quot; (dhœidhaipa) &#x27;die&#x27; (MacGillivray): KLY &quot;dhœidhaika&quot; (base &quot;dhœidhama-&quot;) &#x27;be dizzy, dead drunk&#x27; present imperfective
* OKY &quot;usimema, usima&quot; (usimima, usima) &#x27;douse&#x27; (MacGillivray): KLY &quot;usima&quot;, KKY &quot;wœsimima&quot; &#x27;douse&#x27; today past perfective

Vowel/diphthong deletion and reduction in class 1b verbs was optional in OKY where it is now optional or obligatory:
* OKY uzareuma-: KLY &quot;uzareuma-&quot;, KKY &quot;uzarma-&quot; &#x27;go dual&#x27;
* OKY &quot;delupeipa&quot; (dœdupaipa) &#x27;drown, sink&#x27;: KLY &quot;dudupaka&quot;, KKY &quot;dœdupapa&quot;

The irregular verb &quot;yœwi-&quot; / &quot;iya-&quot; / &quot;yœuna-&quot; &#x27;lie/slant/lean over/down&#x27; was recorded in the form iipa (&quot;eepah&quot;), indicating the stem ii- (the remote past form &quot;iir&quot; is found in modern KY, though not recorded in OKY). Otherwise, only &quot;yœuna-&quot; was recorded for OKY.

===Miscellaneous paradigms===

Three paradigms that have irregular morphology are:
* &quot;Si[ ]kai&quot; &#x27;perhaps, maybe, possibly&#x27; (all dialects except Kalau Kawau Ya). This word modifies for singular gender : masculine &quot;sinukai/senukai&quot;; feminine &quot;sinakai/senakai&quot;; general (singular, dual, plural) &quot;sikai&quot;. In KKY, the word is invariable &quot;sike&quot;, &quot;sikedh&quot; (&quot;sikedh&quot; is more emphatic.)
* &quot;yawa&quot; &#x27;goodbye, farewell, take care&#x27; (cf. &quot;yawar&quot; &#x27;journey, travel&#x27;; &quot;yawaya-&quot; &#x27;watch over, watch out for, etc.&#x27;). This word is only used when speaking to a single person. For two or more people, the form is &quot;yawal&quot;.
* masculine &quot;kame&quot; ~ &quot;kamedh&quot;, feminine &quot;kake&quot; ~ &quot;kakedh&quot;, non-singular &quot;kole&quot; ~ &quot;koledh&quot; &#x27;hey!&#x27; (word used to attract someone&#x27;s attention; in &quot;kamedh&quot;, &quot;kakedh&quot; and &quot;koledh&quot; (the &quot;-dh&quot; final in all these, like in &quot;sikedh&quot; above, is only found in more emphatic use.)

==Sign language==
The Torres Strait Islanders, neighbouring Papuans and neighbouring Australians have a common sign language, though early records did not make a detailed study of this (e.g. Australian Aboriginal sign languages). Simple conversations and stories can be carried out in the sign language; however, it does not attain the sophistication of a fully developed sign language. It&#x27;s had some influence on Far North Queensland Indigenous Sign Language.

<doc id="1015919" wikidata="Q5419382" url="?curid=1015919" title="Excedrin (brand)">
<text>Excedrin is an over-the-counter headache pain reliever, typically in the form of tablets or caplets. It contains paracetamol, aspirin and caffeine. It was manufactured by Bristol-Myers Squibb until it was purchased by Novartis in July 2005 along with other products from BMS&#x27;s over-the-counter business. As of March 2015, GSK holds majority ownership of Excedrin through a joint venture transaction with Novartis.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSK/Novartis Transaction&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On July 18, 2022, GSK spun off its consumer healthcare business (including Excedrin) to Haleon.

The brand became known for advertisements where it cured especially unpleasant and excruciating headaches (called &quot;Excedrin headaches&quot; in the ads of 1970s, and later called &quot;Excedrin tension headaches&quot;). In 2007, the brand branched out into marketing for other types of pains with the introduction of Excedrin Back &amp; Body, without caffeine.

==Principles of work==
Excedrin is a combination medication composed of acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine. These medications treat migraine headache in a variety of ways.

Acetaminophen is a fever reducer and painkiller. Its precise mechanism is unknown. It is known that it mostly affects the brain and spinal cord, which are parts of the central nervous system. By lowering the quantity of prostaglandins the body produces, acetaminophen raises the threshold for pain. 

Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It lessens irritation and swelling as well as discomfort and inflammation. The amount of prostaglandins the body produces is also decreased by aspirin, but not in the same way that acetaminophen does.

Caffeine acts as a vasoconstrictor, causing blood vessels to become smaller. This helps to restrict the blood vessels in the brain. As a result, the amount of blood that may pass through the blood arteries at once is reduced. There are several theories regarding the cause and exacerbation of headaches, and it is thought by some that vasodilation may contribute to symptoms. If a headache is brought on by caffeine withdrawal, the caffeine content of Excedrin may relieve it.

==Versions==

Over the years, different forms of the drug have been introduced:
* 1960: Excedrin Extra Strength (the formula changed for the last time in 1978) In 1960, Bristol-Myers, nowadays Bristol-Myers Squibb, introduced Excedrin Extra Strength for headaches, the first multi-ingredient headache treatment product. Contains 250 mg acetaminophen, 250 mg aspirin and 65 mg caffeine.
* 1969: Excedrin PM – Excedrin PM is the first headache and sleeping pill combination product. Contains 500 mg acetaminophen and 38 mg diphenhydramine citrate as a sleep aid. Those same active ingredients were later utilized several years later in the product Tylenol PM.
* 1998: Excedrin Migraine – At the beginning of 1998, the FDA granted clearance to market Excedrin Migraine for the relief of migraine headache pain and associated symptoms. Excedrin Migraine continued the trend of marketing pain products for specific types of pain, becoming the first migraine headache medication available to consumers without a prescription, even though it has identical &quot;active&quot; ingredients to the regular Excedrin Extra Strength product, 250 mg acetaminophen, 250 mg aspirin, and 65 mg caffeine. In fact, upon the product&#x27;s launch, its advertising slogan was “Excedrin is now Excedrin Migraine,” noting that the two were the same product.
* 2003: Excedrin Tension Headache contains 500 mg acetaminophen, and 65 mg caffeine.
* 2005: Excedrin Sinus Headache contains 325 mg acetaminophen and 5 mg phenylephrine HCl as a decongestant.
* 2007: Excedrin Back and Body – a dual-ingredient formula claiming that it &quot;works two ways—as a pain reliever and a pain blocker right where it hurts&quot;. Contains 250 mg acetaminophen, 250 mg aspirin.
* Discontinued – Excedrin Menstrual Complete, which continued the trend of marketing pain products for specific types of pain, even though it had identical active ingredients to the regular Excedrin Extra Strength product and Excedrin Migraine: 250 mg acetaminophen, 250 mg aspirin and 65 mg caffeine.

==Canada==
Excedrin is no longer sold in Canada.

Previously, Excedrin Migraine and Excedrin Extra Strength sold in Canada had a different formulation compared to the United States. In Canada the product sold with those names contained 500 mg of acetaminophen and 65 mg of caffeine per tablet. The reason was that the combination of acetaminophen with aspirin creates the risk of renal papillary necrosis if large doses are taken chronically.

==Ownership==
In 2005, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced the sale of its North American consumer medicine business (including Excedrin, Comtrex and Keri brands) to Novartis for $660 million, in order to focus on drugs for the ten most profitable disease areas. As of March 2015, GlaxoSmithKline held majority ownership through a joint venture transaction with Novartis.

==Recall and production stoppage==

===2012 recall===
On January 9, 2012, Novartis announced that it was voluntarily recalling all lots of select bottle-packaging configurations of Excedrin products with expiration dates of December 20, 2014, or earlier as a precautionary measure because the products may contain stray tablets, capsules, or caplets from other Novartis products, or contain broken or chipped tablets. The recall was conducted with the knowledge of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Wholesalers and retailers were instructed to stop distribution and return the affected product. Consumers in possession of recalled Excedrin were instructed to stop using the product and contact Novartis. Novartis stated that Excedrin would be shipping to stores on October 15, 2012, and that customers would start seeing it by the first of November.

===January 2020 production stoppage===
On January 21, 2020, GlaxoSmithKline announced that production and distribution of caplets and gel tabs of Excedrin Extra Strength and Excedrin Migraine would be stopped temporarily. Their statement said, &quot;Through routine quality control and assurance measures, we discovered inconsistencies in how we transfer and weigh ingredients&quot; for the recalled products, and that production would restart &quot;shortly&quot;. However, GSK acknowledged that they &quot;cannot confirm a definite date as to when supply will resume&quot;.

=== December 2020 recall ===
On December 26, 2020, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission announced the recall of 400,000 bottles of Excedrin due to the containers of the drug allegedly having holes in the bottom. The concern behind the recall was that the plastic bottles, if they had a hole, could allow children to access the painkiller caplets and lead to dangerous overdose or poisoning. The recall involved bottles containing 50, 80, 100, 152, 200, 250, or 300 caplets.

<doc id="1015928" wikidata="Q1934282" url="?curid=1015928" title="Within the Realm of a Dying Sun">
<text>Within the Realm of a Dying Sun is the third studio album by Australian band Dead Can Dance. It was released on 27 July 1987 by 4AD.

==Background==
By this time, Dead Can Dance were predominantly a duo of Lisa Gerrard and Brendan Perry, along with Peter Ulrich, after the departure of Scott Rodger and James Pinker in 1987.

On the sound of the album, the group commented, &quot;We realised we had been limiting our musical visions [before], relying around guitar, bass and drums. These instruments weren&#x27;t adequate to express a lot of the things we were hearing&quot;. On the making of the album, 4AD label owner Ivo Watts-Russell commented, &quot;I think the relationship between them and [producer] John Rivers was at its peak with [&quot;Within the Realm of a Dying Sun&quot;]. It&#x27;s probably my favourite record of theirs&quot;.

Gerrard&#x27;s vocals featured prominently on the second half of the album, and her singing style often had mellifluous, mystical overtones, especially on &quot;Cantara&quot;.

The cover&#x27;s photograph was taken in Paris, at the family grave of François-Vincent Raspail at Père-Lachaise cemetery.

==Legacy==
*Vocals from &quot;Dawn of the Iconoclast&quot; were sampled by The Future Sound of London for their 1991 single &quot;Papua New Guinea&quot;. 
*American pop singer Fergie later also sampled &quot;Dawn of the Iconoclast&quot; for her song &quot;Hungry&quot; featuring Rick Ross, featured on her 2017 album, &quot;Double Dutchess&quot;. The song interpolated the chant with hip-hop beats and vocals from both artists. 
*&quot;Summoning Of The Muse&quot; was sampled by fellow 4AD alumni A.R. Kane for the interlude track &quot;Off Into Space&quot; from their album &quot;i&quot; (1989).
*&quot;Xavier&quot; has been covered by British gothic metal band Paradise Lost. This cover is available on the Limited Edition of their 2002 album &quot;Symbol of Life&quot;.
*The opening section of &quot;Anywhere Out of the World&quot; was also used repeatedly as haunting background music in the BBC Horizon episode #30.7 &quot;Hunt For The Doomsday Asteroid&quot; in February 1994, originally broadcast ahead of the predicted impact of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with the planet Jupiter in July that same year.

==Reception==

British magazine Fact considered &quot;Within the Realm of a Dying Sun&quot; amongst the &quot;20 Best Goth Records Ever Made&quot;

<doc id="1015930" wikidata="Q4861664" url="?curid=1015930" title="Barney's Beanery">
<text>Barney&#x27;s Beanery is a chain of gastropubs in the Greater Los Angeles Area. John &quot;Barney&quot; Anthony founded it in 1920 in Berkeley, California, and in 1927 he moved it to U.S. Route 66, now Santa Monica Boulevard (State Route 2), in West Hollywood. As of 2011, Barney&#x27;s Beanery had locations in Burbank, Pasadena (taking the ground floor of Q&#x27;s Billiards at 99 East Colorado Boulevard), Santa Monica, Westwood, Redondo Beach at the Redondo Beach Pier and the original in West Hollywood.

==History==

Barney&#x27;s relocation to West Hollywood, combined with the fact that the owner extended credit and occasionally gave away food, made the bar popular with people of diverse backgrounds, including artists, writers, and other celebrities. Older Hollywood actors such as Clara Bow, Clark Gable, Errol Flynn, Judy Garland and Rita Hayworth were all regulars in their day. By the 1960s, the neighboring Sunset Strip had become an important music center, and Jim Morrison (who was reportedly thrown out of Barney&#x27;s for urinating on the bar) and Janis Joplin became regulars (Barney&#x27;s was the final place Joplin visited before her death in October 1970). Poet Charles Bukowski hung around, as did artists Ed Kienholz and others associated with the Ferus Gallery, which was located nearby on La Cienega Boulevard. Quentin Tarantino also allegedly wrote most of the screenplay for his film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; sitting in his favorite booth at the original Barney&#x27;s Beanery in West Hollywood. Jon Taffer got his start in the nightclub and bar industry here as a bartender while performing as a drummer in a live band.

===Discrimination towards homosexuals===

In the 1930s, 1940s, or around 1953 John Anthony put up a sign among the old license plates and other ephemera along the wall behind the bar that read &quot;FAGOTS – STAY OUT&quot;. Though Anthony was known to be antagonistic towards gays, going as far as posing (in front of his sign) for a picture in a 1964 &quot;Life&quot; article on &quot;Homosexuality in America&quot; over a caption where he exclaims &quot;I don&#x27;t like &#x27;em...&quot;, the sign ostensibly was put up as a response to pressure from the police who had a tendency towards discriminatory practices against homosexuals and consequently establishments that catered to the group.

After Anthony died in 1968, efforts to remove the sign continued. A coalition of gay activist groups organized a zap of the restaurant on February 7, 1970, to push for its removal; the sign came down that day. The sign was put up and taken down several times over the next 14 years, and the restaurant&#x27;s matchbooks also bore the line, but that practice ended in December 1984, days after the city of West Hollywood voted itself into existence. Then-mayor Valerie Terrigno, the entire city council and gay rights activists marched into Barney’s and relieved the wall of the offending sign. It was held by Morris Kight for many years and now rests in the ONE National Gay &amp; Lesbian Archives.

==In pop culture==
In 1965 Edward Kienholz created “The Beanery,” a life-size sculpture tableaux of the interior, inhabited by poorly dressed store mannequins whose “faces” are clocks set at 10:10. An audiotape of barroom chatter, and the odor of beer, accompanied the display. A newspaper in a vending machine is headlined &quot;Children Kill Children in Vietnam.” The work was first unveiled in the restaurant parking lot, and is now in the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam. 

On the cover of the 1968 Big Brother and the Holding Company album &quot;Cheap Thrills&quot;, vibes on the song &quot;Turtle Blues&quot; are credited to Barney&#x27;s Beanery. Also, there is an illustration of the diner by R. Crumb, who did the artwork for the album. 

In the TV film series &quot;Columbo&quot; (1971), Columbo often ordered chili at Barney&#x27;s Beanery. However, the series was not filmed in the actual location. 

Country rock band New Riders of the Purple Sage talk of hanging out at Barney&#x27;s Beanery in their 1973 song Lonesome L.A. Cowboy.

Barney&#x27;s Beanery appears in the opening credits of the 1978 film &quot;Grease.&quot;

In Brian DePalma&#x27;s 1984 film Body Double, the main character, Jake, breaks his sobriety at Barney&#x27;s after finding out his girlfriend is cheating on him. 

Parts of Oliver Stone&#x27;s 1991 film &quot;The Doors&quot; were filmed at Barney&#x27;s Beanery.

<doc id="1015931" wikidata="Q34207" url="?curid=1015931" title="Yankunytjatjara dialect">
<text>Yankunytjatjara (also Yankuntatjara, Jangkundjara, or Kulpantja) is an Australian Aboriginal language. It is one of the Wati languages, belonging to the large Pama–Nyungan family. It is one of the many varieties of the Western Desert Language, all of which are mutually intelligible.

Yankunytjatjara is spoken in the north-west of South Australia and is one of the most easterly of the Western Desert dialects, being spoken around the communities of Mimili, Indulkana and Fregon and across to Oodnadatta and Coober Pedy (although this latter is not on traditional Yankunytjatjara land).

==Dialects==
Yankunytjatjara is one of the many dialects of the Western Desert language and is very similar to the better known, more widely spoken Pitjantjatjara. According to a study carried out mainly in Coober Pedy where many speakers of both varieties reside (although the town is on what was traditionally Arabana lands), young speakers of Yankunytjatjara often borrow words from English and also from Pitjantjatjara (which has expanded eastwards into Yankunytjatjara country and beyond). Yankunytjatjara shows some variation across its range with, for example, Northern Yankunytjatjara sharing features with Southern Luritja.

== Phonology ==
===Vowels===
* are realised as when preceding laminal consonants.

===Consonants===
* can be trilled when pronounced emphatically, or may also occur as voiceless in word-final position.

==Name==
The name used for Yankunytjatjara is based on a single prominent word, the verb for &#x27;come/go&#x27;, which distinguishes it from its near neighbour, Pitjantjatjara. The latter has (in the present tense ) for this verb while Yankunytjatjara has (present tense ). The ending is the comitative suffix, and means &#x27;having&#x27; or &#x27;with&#x27;. Thus Yankunytjatjara means &#x27;to have &#x27; as opposed to Pitjantjatjara which has .

Alternatively, the northernmost Yankunytjatjara and parts of Southern Luritja both have the word &#x27;true&#x27; and so are sometimes grouped together as Maṯutjara to contrast them with the Southern Yankunytjatjara who use for &#x27;true&#x27; and so can be referred to as Mulatjara. Another classification used by speakers groups Yankunytjatjara and Pitjantjatjara together as Nyangatjatjara as they both use for the demonstrative &#x27;this&#x27; or &#x27;this one&#x27;; this contrasts them with Ngaanyatjara, which has for the demonstrative and Nyanganyatjara varieties (still further west) which have .

=== Pronunciation ===
The name &quot;Yankunytjatjara&quot; is usually pronounced (in normal, fast speech) with one of the repeated syllables deleted, thus: . In slow, careful speech all syllables will be pronounced.

==Status==
There seems to be no exhaustive evidence on the vitality of Yankunytjatjara. McConvell &amp; Thieberger found Yankunytjatjara to be endangered based mainly on the Census of 1996. In 2005 the National Indigenous Language Survey, based on a more comprehensive survey, concluded that Yankunytjatjara was &#x27;definitely endangered&#x27;.
Naessan, using the 2003 UNESCO framework, gave a mark of 22/23 out of 35 (in its most condensed spot), quite a low score. If some factors that Naessan feels are unimportant in most indigenous languages are ignored, Yankunytjatjara scores 14/15 out of 20 (in its densest area). However, he argues that since recent surveys have included these factors, they may be more helpful for cross referencing. To a lesser extent he feels that, since Western Desert people own some media sources (radio station etc.), such factors should be included. He concludes a 57–65% vitality.

Both schemas indicate that Yankunytjatjara shows symptoms of endangerment (although &quot;how&quot; endangered is a subject of debate), which coincides with the beliefs of the Yankunytjatjara elders that Naessan spoke with, as well as with the assessments of most linguists who have worked in the area.

<doc id="1015947" wikidata="Q35463" url="?curid=1015947" title="Ghotuo language">
<text>Ghotuo (also Otwa, Otuo) is a North Central Edoid language spoken in Edo State, mostly in the Owan and Akoko-Edo areas of Edo state, Nigeria.

== Grammar ==

=== Noun morphology ===
Ghotuo nouns are composed of a prefix and a stem. Stems usually consist of the structures &quot;-V,&quot; &quot;-CV,&quot; &quot;-CVV,&quot; and &quot;-CVCV.&quot; Prefixes typically consist of the structures &quot;V-,&quot; &quot;VV-,&quot; and &quot;CV-.&quot; Across both types of morpheme, &quot;V-&quot; and &quot;CV&quot; are the most common structures. Nouns with the &quot;u-&quot; prefix in the singular, have a plural &quot;i-&quot; prefix. Similarly, nouns with a singular &quot;o-&quot; prefix have a plural &quot;i-&quot; prefix if the stem vowel is close. If the vowel is not close, then these nouns have a singular &quot;-e&quot; prefix. The prefix &quot;-e&quot; is also used as a plural prefix if the singular prefix of the noun is &quot;-ɔ&quot; and the stem vowel is not close.

Prefixes in Ghotuo are not exclusively determined by phonology, they are also defined by the grammatical class of the noun.

There are numerous examples of Ghotou nouns with unpaired prefixes.

Demonstratives are conveyed using prefixes. For instance, the prefix &quot;ɔ-&quot; is used when referring to a singular entity while &quot;è-&quot; is used for plural entities. Prefixation in Ghotuo is used for agreement markers; all plural nouns share the same agreement marker, and all the singular nouns share the same agreement marker. In some instances, prefixation may be used to transform a verb into an abstract noun. The verb &quot;ɟâ,&quot; meaning &quot;laugh,&quot; can be transformed into &quot;ē-ɟà,&quot; meaning laughter, using prefixes. Stative nouns may also be formed by applying the prefix &quot;ɔnhi-&quot; to a stative verb. The word &quot;obi,&quot; meaning &quot;darkness,&quot; can be transformed to &quot;ɔnhōbì,&quot; meaning &quot;a black one.&quot; Sometimes this prefix can also be applied to a non-ideophonic adverb. For instance &quot;dùkɛ,&quot; meaning short, can be transformed into &quot;ɔnhī dùkɛ,&quot; meaning &quot;a short one.&quot; Nouns may also be derived from verbs in relative clauses. In Ghotuo, Verbs interact with nouns to form Locative nouns. Prefixing a specific set of three body parts to another place noun creates more complex sentences in Ghotuo. The body parts involved are ūsɔ(mhì), meaning &quot;head,&quot; ūdò, meaning &quot;stomach,&quot; and àvɔ, meaning &quot;legs.&quot; One example is the phrase &quot;ūdóvbàɡhì,&quot; meaning &quot;inside of the room.&quot;

The phrase &quot;ɔnhī&quot; can sometimes be used to indicate the origins of a married woman. For instance, the phrase &quot;ɔnhī  ɣɔnhíɣõ,&quot; means &quot;a Yoruba woman.&quot; The phrase &quot;ōnyẽ&quot; is used to indicate that an individual is from a certain region For instance, &quot;ōnyẽ ìɡbò&quot; means &quot;an Igbo person.&quot; &quot;ɔnhī&quot; and &quot;onhi&quot; may also be used to indicate time. The word &quot; àmɛ,&quot; meaning &quot;water,&quot; when transformed to &quot;ɔnhīɣèmɛ&quot; means &quot;rain season.&quot; Placing the form &quot;omhi&quot; before a noun can transform it into a diminutive. If applied to &quot;ɛ-wè,&quot; meaning &quot;goat,&quot; it becomes &quot;omhi ɛwè,&quot; meaning &quot;little goat.&quot; Literally, the word &quot;omhi&quot; means child. It may be used in phrases such as &quot;ōmhī mhɛ,&quot; meaning &quot;my child.&quot; The words &quot;vbāí,&quot; &quot;kpɛɛkpɛ,&quot; and &quot;ɡbei&quot; can be applied to nouns to express a sense of totality. For example, the phrase &quot;ìtīsá ɡbēī&quot; means &quot;all teachers.&quot; 

Tonal reflexes are sometimes utilized to convey gerunds, verbal nouns, and agent nouns. For example, by applying a low tone to the phrase &quot;ɔ dɛɡhōbè,&quot; meaning &quot;he buys a book,&quot; it transforms into &quot;one who buys a book.&quot; This rule only applies to simple clauses with one verb. In clauses with multiple verbs, the letter &quot;m&quot; is added to the end of the noun. Prefixes can also be applied to express the plurality of a phrase. For instance, the prefix &quot;i-.&quot; when applied to the phrase &quot;ɔwìƞʷàhɛkūhɛdā,&quot; transforms it into &quot;ì wìƞʷàhɛkūhɛdā.&quot; This transforms the meaning from &quot;one who throws clothes into the river,&quot; to &quot;those who throw clothes into the river.&quot; Proper nouns in Ghotuo are often whole clauses or statements, typically they refer to circumstances of birth, philosophical statements, or the events in the subject&#x27;s life.

=== Tone ===
Ghotuo is a terraced three-tone language. The three basic tones in Ghotuo are high, mid, and low. It experiences the downstep in the low and mid-tone levels, which means that in these tone levels, if two syllables have the same tone then the second syllable is lower than the first one. One analysis of tone in Ghotuo conducted by Kolawole Adeniyi, a researcher from Obafemi Awolowo University, found that Ghotuo speakers tended to remove downstep from their speech when speaking with non-native speakers. This indicates the downstep in Ghotuo is speaker-controlled. Downdrift is also present in Ghouto; the mid and high tones are progressively lowered by the low tones preceding them. Downdrift is not automatically present in every Ghotuo word with mid or high tones following low tones. However, it is present in every word where a low tone follows a mid or high tone. Ghotuo contains falling tones; the low tone falls if it is placed after a mid or high tone. There are also &quot;mid-falling&quot; and &quot;high-falling&quot; tones found in the language.

<text>Frank Walter Yallop (born 4 April 1964) is a British-Canadian professional soccer coach and former player.

He played 13 years in England for Ipswich Town, including the club&#x27;s first three seasons in the Premier League. He also played in Major League Soccer (MLS) for the Tampa Bay Mutiny, and earned 52 caps for the Canada men&#x27;s national soccer team.

He spent a further 13 years as coach in MLS for San Jose Earthquakes, LA Galaxy, and Chicago Fire, as well as three years coaching the Canadian men&#x27;s national team. He has most recently been a coach and sporting director in the USL Championship, working with Phoenix Rising, Fresno FC, Las Vegas Lights, and Monterey Bay FC.

==Early life==
Yallop was born in Watford and spent his early childhood there before his father, a meat cutter by trade, joined a brother in Canada in 1974 bringing his wife and three children to Vancouver. Yallop continued playing in British Columbia, where he caught the eye of an Ipswich Town scout who invited Yallop to try out for Ipswich aged 14.

==Club career==
=== Ipswich Town (1983–1996) ===
In 1983, aged 19, Yallop signed a professional contract with Ipswich Town. He was part of the Ipswich squad that was relegated from the First Division in 1986 and of the squad that won the 1991–92 Second Division title promotion six years later to the inaugural season of the newly formed FA Premier League, where Ipswich stayed for three years before being relegated once again to the second tier. In the later years of his Ipswich career, he played alongside fellow Canadian Craig Forrest. In the season following the relegation, Yallop was loaned out to third-tier side Blackpool F.C. in November 1995, where he featured for the team in a few Second Division matches. He departed the club following the conclusion of the 1995–96 season.

Two of his eight goals for the Town came in the span of three days in February 1993. The first came against Tottenham Hotspur with Yallop breaking a four-year scoring drought in a 2–0 victory. The second goal helped to push Ipswich to beat Premier League title favourites Manchester United 2–1 at Portman Road, a result which saw Ipswich occupy fourth place in the league and spark hopes of a late run to the title, but instead a slump in form followed and Ipswich finished 16th.

At the end of his time at Ipswich, Yallop amassed 385 appearances in all competitions, which puts him just outside the top ten in appearances for the club all time. Yallop was inducted into the club&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2023, a recognition of his nearly 15 years spent with the club between academy and professional play.

=== Tampa Bay Mutiny (1996–1998) ===
After a lengthy career in England, Yallop returned to North America in 1996, when he signed with Major League Soccer and was drafted 57th overall by the Tampa Bay Mutiny in the MLS Inaugural Player Draft. Week 23 of the season saw Frank Yallop win his first and only MLS Player of the Week award. This award was also the first for any Tampa Bay player. Tampa Bay would finish the inaugural MLS season with the best record, for which they&#x27;d retroactively be awarded the Supporter&#x27;s Shield. However, in the playoffs Tampa would fall just short of reaching the first ever MLS Cup, losing in the Eastern Conference finals to eventual champions D.C. United.

Yallop was given his only MLS All-Star honor with an appearance in the 1997 game, representing Tampa Bay on the Eastern Conference team. The 1997 MLS season saw Tampa slightly regress, finishing with the third best record overall, and second best in the East behind D.C. United. Tampa would make the playoffs for the second season in a row but would fall in the first round to the Columbus Crew. The 1998 season saw yet another regression, with Tampa Bay failing to quality for the playoffs. In the final match of his MLS career, Frank Yallop scored the game winner, which was his first goal of his MLS career.

After three seasons with the Mutiny, in which he served as captain and started nearly every game, Yallop retired from professional soccer. He was released from the Mutiny roster due to MLS shrinking their foreign player limit from 5 to 4 players per team. At the time of his retirement, Yallop was second on the team all-time in games played (88), games started (84), and minutes played (7,646).

During the 1999 season the team lost Jan Eriksson and R.T. Moore to injury and retirement respectively. The Mutiny petitioned the league to sign Yallop, who was still participating in player drills and could resume his career, but the league denied the request and Yallop remained retired.

== International career ==
Yallop made five appearances for England&#x27;s youth team in 1981–82 before switching allegiance to Canada.

He had initially been ineligible to feature for Canada and thus missed out on their first World Cup participation in 1986. After FIFA&#x27;s rules changed regarding national team player eligibility, Yallop was finally able to make his official debut and start for Canada at 26 years of age on 13 May 1990, against Mexico in the 1990 North American Championship, helping Canada win the tournament. Yallop had featured in Canada&#x27;s first match of the tournament against the United States, however since the US sent a B-squad to the match, it did not count as a full international.

Over his Canada career he earned 52 caps, serving as captain multiple times, and scoring no goals at the international level. He represented Canada in 27 FIFA World Cup qualification matches across the 1994 and 1998 World Cup qualifying campaigns. His final international was on 16 November 1997 away to Costa Rica in Canada&#x27;s final 1998 World Cup qualification match.

On 29 April 2005, Yallop was selected for induction into the Canadian Soccer Hall of Fame for his playing career. On 24 May 2012, Yallop was selected by the Canadian Soccer Hall of Fame as the right back of Canada&#x27;s Best XI for the 1963-2012 era.

==Coaching career==
===Early coaching career===
After retiring following his 1998 season with the Tampa Bay Mutiny, Yallop was offered the opportunity to become an assistant coach for the club starting with the 1999 MLS season. In the interim period before the pre-season would begin, Yallop began his coaching career in 1998 as an assistant-coach under Lothar Osiander with the U.S. Project-40 team, joining the team on a 5-game tour of England. Osiander joked that he brought Yallop on board because &quot;I needed someone who knew how to drive on the other side of the road.&quot; Following the tour, he began his duties as an assistant coach for the Tampa Bay Mutiny. In 2000, he became chief assistant coach for D.C. United under Thomas Rongen. In December 2000, it had been reported that Yallop was considered as an early candidate to coach for his former team Tampa Bay Mutiny, but he did not make the final group of candidates.

===San Jose Earthquakes (2001–2003)===
In 2001, Yallop was named head coach for the San Jose Earthquakes, just three days before the MLS SuperDraft. He replaced Lothar Osiander, who he had briefly coached under just few years prior with Project-40. Yallop was the first former MLS player to become an MLS head coach after retiring. During the pre-season, Yallop acquired Jeff Agoos, Landon Donovan, Dwayne DeRosario, Manny Lagos, Ramiro Corrales and Ronnie Ekelund, as well as assistant coach Dominic Kinnear. Kinnear, a former teammate of Yallop&#x27;s at Tampa Bay Mutiny, initially thought he was being recruited as a player, but Yallop asked him to join the club as an assistant coach. Kinnear would end his playing career to join Yallop&#x27;s coaching staff. In his first year as head coach, Yallop proceeded to lead the San Jose Earthquakes to the playoffs for their second time in franchise history, the first time since the club&#x27;s and league&#x27;s inaugural season in 1996. The 2001 playoff run culminated with the club&#x27;s first MLS Cup appearance, which ended with a win over California Clásico rivals LA Galaxy. At the season&#x27;s conclusion, Yallop was named 2001 MLS Coach of the Year.

The following year the Quakes would improve their regular season performance and finish in second place overall. They set or tied records for an MLS all-time best home record (12–1–1), a then MLS record 12-game winning streak at home, and went on a 15-game home unbeaten streak that tied their previous club best from 1999 to 2000. However, San Jose would succumb to an upset in the first round of the 2002 MLS Playoffs against the Columbus Crew, ending their defense of the MLS Cup. The season was also notable for Yallop as he coached in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game in only his second season as head coach, leading the MLS All-Stars to a 3–2 victory over the US men&#x27;s national team.

In 2003, the Earthquakes yet again improved upon their regular season form and finished as the best team in the West, and just two points shy of winning the Supporters Shield as the best regular season team. Yallop would lead the team to their second MLS title through these playoffs, their second title in the span of three seasons. Beside the MLS Cup final, this Earthquakes playoff run is most known for the club completing the greatest comeback in MLS playoff history, a 5–4 aggregate win after being down 4–0 on aggregate heading into the second half of the return leg of the home and away series. MLS Cup 2003 is the Earthquakes&#x27; most recent appearance in the playoff final as well as the last time they won the MLS Cup.

===Canada (2004–2006)===
On 16 December 2003 it was announced that Yallop would become head coach of the Canadian National Team starting on 1 January of the following year. Yallop oversaw Canada&#x27;s appearances at the 2003 and 2005 editions of the CONCACAF Gold Cup, both of which featured group stage exits, as well as their qualification campaign for the 2006 FIFA World Cup which ended in the third round of CONCACAF qualifying out of four total. On 7 June 2006, Yallop resigned as coach of the Canadian men&#x27;s national soccer team, as he was announced as the new head coach of Los Angeles Galaxy. He finished with an 8-9-3 record as Canada&#x27;s head coach.

===Los Angeles Galaxy (2006–2007)===
Yallop took the helm for the Galaxy midway through the 2006 MLS season, eventually guiding the team to just outside the playoffs by three points. The Galaxy, which signed famed English star David Beckham under Yallop, failed to qualify for the play-offs in 2007, although Yallop has been defended for his part in that, with forward Alan Gordon, who played on the 2007 Galaxy team, stating &quot;it had nothing to do with Frank. We had 11 guys come in and out of there in a couple months. We had no team chemistry. We had a bunch of individuals who were trying to hang on and make the best of it.&quot;

===Return to San Jose Earthquakes (2008–2013)===
On 4 November 2007 it was revealed that Yallop was being bought out of his contract with the Galaxy to become the head coach of the San Jose Earthquakes once again for the 2008 season, with Dutchman Ruud Gullit taking his place. The Galaxy received the Earthquakes&#x27; third-round pick in the 2008 MLS SuperDraft as compensation for Yallop&#x27;s departure.

Ahead of the 2006 MLS season, the Earthquakes were moved to Texas to become the Houston Dynamo. Soon the move after plans were established to revive the San Jose Earthquakes, this time as an expansion team who would need to build their roster from scratch. Two weeks after it was announced Yallop would be taking over as Earthquakes head coach, the team participated in the 2007 MLS expansion draft to build out the team&#x27;s roster. Throughout the offseason Yallop would bring some players from his first Earthquakes stint back to San Jose including Joe Cannon, Ramiro Corrales, Arturo Álvarez, and Kelly Gray. The team would finish last in the overall MLS standings at the conclusion of their first season, though they were tied on points with Yallop&#x27;s former team and San Jose&#x27;s rivals, the LA Galaxy. After the Earthquakes finished second from last in the 2009 MLS season, they would see an upswing in 2010. The Earthquakes would finish the regular season 8th place overall, earning their first playoff appearance since the club&#x27;s return. Yallop would lead the club to a shocking upset of the top team in the Eastern Conference, the New York Red Bulls, keeping New York&#x27;s newly acquired Thierry Henry off the scoresheet in a 3–2 aggregate victory after a 1–0 home loss in San Jose. The Earthquakes would fall in the Eastern Conference final, a 1–0 loss to eventual MLS Cup champion Colorado Rapids.

Yallop led the new-era Earthquakes for five and a half seasons before mutually parting ways with the club on 7 June 2013. He compiled a 62–6–51 record and led the club to two postseason appearances (2010, 2012) and the 2012 Supporters&#x27; Shield. The 2012 Shield victory is the most recent trophy the Earthquakes have won. His combined 126 wins in two stints at the club is the most in team history. He would be inducted into the club&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2022, in recognition for his impact on the club, being the coach that brought them their only two MLS Cups, and three of their four trophies overall.

===Chicago Fire (2013–2015)===
In October 2013, Yallop was named Chicago Fire&#x27;s new head coach and director of soccer. Chicago would finish second to last in the Eastern Conference in his first season in charge. The following season saw the team perform even worse, and the poor form would see Yallop was fired on 20 September 2015, with five matches left in the season. Chicago would finish the season worst in the East and the worst record in MLS overall. He compiled a 13–26–24 record with the Fire in what would be his last MLS coaching job to date.

===Arizona United SC and Phoenix Rising FC (2016–2017)===
Yallop was signed to a three-year contract as head coach and president of soccer operations of Arizona United SC on 23 December 2015. This was his first time managing a club in the USL. The team was renamed Phoenix Rising FC on 28 November 2016. After only four league matches played in the 2017 season, Yallop would resign from his positions on 24 April to rejoin his family in Northern California. Yallop would stay on to consult in the club&#x27;s search for a replacement head coach. Frank&#x27;s assistant Rick Schantz took over as interim coach before the eventual hiring of Patrice Carteron. Phoenix would finish the season in 5th place, good for their first ever playoff appearance.

===Fresno FC (2018–2019)===
Yallop was announced on 26 July 2017 as General Manager of the newly established Fresno FC, an expansion team for the 2018 USL season. The club would fold following the end of the 2019 USL Championship season, citing an inability to find a suitable location for the club to play at long term.

===Las Vegas Lights FC (2020)===
On 29 June 2020, Yallop returned to coaching for the first time since 2017 when he was hired in a caretaker role to replace Eric Wynalda as head coach of Las Vegas Lights FC, a month before the 2020 USL Championship season was set to resume. Yallop had made it official at the time of his hire that he would not pursue the head coaching role after the end of the season. Wynalda had coached Las Vegas for a single match of the 2020 USL season before a pause was brought on due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Las Vegas would finish the season fifth place out of five teams in their regional group, and fifteenth of eighteen teams in the Western Conference.

===Monterey Bay FC (2021–2024)===
On February 1, 2021, it was announced that Monterey Bay FC would be joining the USL Championship as an expansion side. This club was primarily owned by Ray Beshoff, and the result of Fresno FC folding two years prior. Yallop was initially announced as sporting director, a similar role to what he had previously with Fresno. Yallop would be announced in April as taking on the additional role of head coach for Monterey Bay FC in addition to acting as sporting director. Former Earthquakes captain Ramiro Corrales would serve as Yallop&#x27;s sole assistant coach. Corrales played under Yallop during both of the coach&#x27;s stints with the San Jose Earthquakes. Monterey Bay FC began their first USL Championship season in March 2022. The club achieved their first professional win on 29 March, in their third match of the 2022 USL Championship season.

Yallop and assistant coach Ramiro Corrales were both released from their positions on July 31, 2024.

<doc id="1015981" wikidata="Q203568" url="?curid=1015981" title="Mount Aragats">
<text>Mount Aragats (, ) is an isolated four-peaked volcano massif in Armenia. Its northern summit, at above sea level, is the highest point of the Lesser Caucasus and Armenia. It is also one of the highest points in the Armenian Highlands.

The Aragats massif is surrounded by the Kasagh River on the east, the Akhurian River on the west, Ararat Plain on the south, and Shirak Plain on the north. The circumference of the massif is around , and covers an area of or around of Armenia&#x27;s total area. of the massif is located above .

==Etymology and names==
According to Armenian tradition, the name of Aragats originates from the words and , which translates to &quot;Ara&#x27;s throne&quot;, in reference to the legendary hero Ara the Beautiful. Aragats was mentioned by the early medieval historian Movses Khorenatsi, who in his &quot;History of Armenia&quot; claims that the mountain is named after , the son of Hayk, the legendary patriarch of the Armenian people. Aramaneak called his possessions &quot;the foot of Aragats&quot; ( or ). The modern Aragatsotn Province, dominated by the mountain, was formed in 1995.

A relatively modern name for the mountain is &quot;Alagöz&quot; (), sometimes spelled &quot;Alagheuz&quot;, which literally means &quot;variegated eye&quot; in Turkish and Azerbaijani. This term was widely used up until the mid-20th century in European, Tsarist Russian, and early Soviet sources. Another version, &quot;Alagyaz&quot; (), has been used in Armenian. A village on the foot of Aragats is named Alagyaz.

==Geography and geology==

Aragats is isolated from Armenia&#x27;s other mountain ranges. However, it is considered part and the highest point of the larger Lesser Caucasus mountain range. It has four summits, which are named according to their relative geographic position:
*Northern—
*Western—
*Eastern—
*Southern—
Mount Aragats has a topographic prominence of 2,143 meters, more than some higher mountains, such as Dykh-Tau (5,205 m high) in the Russian part of Great Caucasus Range.

Situated northwest of the Armenian capital Yerevan, Aragats is a large volcano with numerous fissure vents and adventive cones. Numerous large lava flows descend from the volcano and are constrained in age between the middle Pleistocene and 3,000 BCE. The summit crater is cut by a long line of cones which generated possibly Holocene-age lahars and lava flow. The volcanic system covers an area of 5,000 km2 and is one of the largest in the region. More recent activity in flank centers occurred in Tirinkatar (0.48-0.61 Ma), Kakavasar, (0.52-0.54 Ma), and Ashtarak (0.58 Ma), as well as Jrbazhan in the summit area (0.52 Ma). The magmas feeding Aragats are unusually hot for arc-derived magmas, resulting in long and voluminous lava flows.

===Glaciation===
Shortly after World War II, observations noted the presence of firn fields and snowfields on the sides of the crater cirque as well as moraines and glaciers inside the crater. An analysis in 1896 indicated a surface area of 5.5-5.8 km2, but it rapidly retreated afterward. The glaciation has been retreating on account of insufficient snowfall and increasing temperatures. Glacial meltwater dominates the upper part of the rivers descending from Aragats but its importance decreases farther down the valleys. Traces of prehistorical glaciation also exist including thick moraines in the summit area at an altitude of 2,600–3,000 m.

===Climate===
==History==
===Geological===
The volcano was constructed in four different phases. The first phase (possibly 2.5Ma) occurred in the main crater and subsidiary vents and was basaltic andesite in composition. It crops out in deep gorges. The second phase (0.97–0.89 Ma, by K–Ar) involved the main vent, and subsidiary structures and was basaltic and andesitic in composition with ignimbrites and pyroclastic, with tuffs and lava flows emanating from satellite centers. It was the most voluminous and included the Shamiram and Yeghvard subsidiary centres. The third phase (0.74–0.68 Ma) while similar to the second was more restricted in regional extent to the Mantash River basin. The fourth stage (0.56–0.45 Ma) involved mafic lava flows from parasitic vents in the southern parts of the volcano.

===Cultural===
Numerous engravings have been made around the volcano, including rock paintings portraying animals and human-like figures in the Kasagh River valley possibly dating to the early Holocene, and in Aghavnatun on the southern side of the volcano including petroglyphs showing animals that were possibly created in the 4th to 1st millennia BCE.

According to an ancient Armenian legend, Aragats and Mount Ararat were loving sisters who parted after a quarrel and separated permanently. Another legend tells that Gregory the Illuminator, who converted Armenia to Christianity in the early 4th century, &quot;used to pray on the peak of the mountain. At nighttime an icon lamp shone to give light to him, the lamp hanging from heaven using no rope. Some say that the icon lamp is still there, but only the worthy ones can see it.&quot;

In 1935, on the 15th anniversary of Armenia&#x27;s Sovietization, around one thousand people climbed the summit of Aragats from five directions. On May 28, 2005—the anniversary of the establishment of the First Republic of Armenia—around 250,000 people participated in a Dance of Unity () around Mount Aragats in a mass display of national unity. The quarter million participants, among them then-President Robert Kocharyan and Defense Minister Serzh Sargsyan, formed a ring around the mountain after a blessing from Catholicos Karekin II. The organizers hoped the event would be included in the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;. Prior to the dance, some 110,000 trees were planted on the slopes of Aragats.

==Nearby settlements==
The following settlements are located on the slopes or foot of Aragats: Ashtarak, Artik, Aparan, Talin, Oshakan, Byurakan.

==Main sights==
===Historic and cultural sites===

Aragats has historically played a significant role in Armenian history and culture. Numerous historical and modern monuments are located on its slopes, some of which are listed below.

The 4th-century mausoleum of the Arsacid (Arshakuni) dynasty is located in the village of Aghtsk, on the slopes of Aragats.

The early medieval fortress of Amberd and the nearby 11th-century Vahramashen Church are located on the slopes of Aragats, at an altitude of . One source calls Amberd the &quot;biggest and the best preserved fortress&quot; in modern-day Armenia.

The Alphabet Park () is located near the village of Artashavan. It was founded in 2005 on the 1600th anniversary of the invention of the Armenian alphabet. It features sculptures of the 39 letters of the Armenian alphabet and statues of notable Armenians, such as Mesrop Mashtots (the inventor of the alphabet), Armenia&#x27;s national poet Hovhannes Tumanyan, Khachatur Abovian (father of modern Eastern Armenian literature), and others. In 2012, a high cross, composed of 1711 large and small iron crosses, symbolizing the number of years since Armenia&#x27;s conversion to Christianity in 301, was installed on a hill near the park. A cross is added on an annual basis.

===Scientific institutions===

The Aragats Cosmic Ray Research Station is a cosmic-ray observatory near Lake Kari, at around above sea level. It was founded in 1943 by the brothers Artem Alikhanian and Abram Alikhanov. The Nor-Amberd station, built in 1960, is located at .

The Byurakan Observatory, established in 1946 by Victor Ambartsumian, is located on the southern slopes of Aragats, near the village of Byurakan, at an altitude of . It made Armenia one of the world&#x27;s centers for the study of astrophysics in the 20th century.

The ROT-54/2.6, a radio telescope built in 1985 by the radiophysicist Paris Herouni in the village of Orgov, on the slopes of Aragats.

===Gravity hill===
On the highway leading to fortress Amberd is a gravity hill, which has become a tourist attraction, due to an optical illusion leading to a downhill slope appearing to be uphill.

=== Mount Aragats hike ===
Mount Aragats is a popular hiking destination among locals and tourists. The southern, lowest peak is the most visited one. The hiking trail is approximately 5 kilometers long, and it typically takes between 2.5 and 3 hours to complete.

==In culture==
Mount Aragats plays a special role in Armenian history and culture. Along with Ararat, it is considered a sacred mountain for the Armenians.

Aragats is a male first name in Armenia, used especially in areas surrounding the mountain.

Mt. Aragats is often associated with Gyumri, Armenia&#x27;s second-largest city. The mountain is depicted on the coat of arms of Gyumri. It is also depicted on the obverse side of the 10,000 Armenian dram banknote (in use since 2003) in the background of Avetik Isahakyan, a poet born in Gyumri.
Numerous Armenian poets (e.g., Avetik Isahakyan) have written about Aragats. Marietta Shaginyan compared Aragats to a &quot;half-open bud of a giant pomegranate flower&quot;. In one short poem, Silva Kaputikyan compares Armenia to an &quot;ancient rock-carved fortress&quot;, the towers of which are Mount Aragats and Mount Ararat.

=== In visual art ===

Numerous artists have painted Aragats. Some examples of paintings of Aragats are kept at the National Gallery of Armenia.

<doc id="1015986" wikidata="Q215493" url="?curid=1015986" title="Stadio Delle Alpi">
<text>The Stadio delle Alpi was a football and athletics stadium in Turin, Italy, and was the home of both Juventus Football Club and Torino Football Club between 1990 and 2006. In English, the name meant &quot;Stadium of the Alps&quot;, a reference to the nearby Alps mountain range. The stadium was demolished in 2009 and both football clubs moved to the rebuilt Stadio Olimpico. A new stadium for Juventus, the Juventus Stadium, was constructed on the site of the former Delle Alpi and opened in 2011.

Designed by architect Studio Hutter, the Stadio delle Alpi was originally built in 1990 to host matches for the 1990 FIFA World Cup as a replacement for the aging Stadio Olimpico, then known as the Stadio Comunale. The stadium&#x27;s original capacity was 69,041 fans. However, due to FIFA rules regarding the segregation of home and away supporters, the actual capacity was reduced to 67,229.

==History==
Construction on the stadium began in June 1988, and due to the use of prefabricated concrete, was complete within two years. The Delle Alpi was built by the council of Turin, with both of the city&#x27;s football clubs using it as their home ground following the closure of the Stadio Olimpico. It was originally intended to be used for not only football but also athletics. Therefore, an athletics track was constructed around the outside of the pitch. However, due to the lack of a warm-up track, the stadium was never used for a major athletics event.

The stadium was inaugurated on 31 May 1990 when a joint Juventus–Torino team defeated Porto 4–3. Due to escalating rental costs, disputes arose between the clubs and the city council. In 1994, the Juventus board investigated building a new stadium, which would be owned by the club. The UEFA Cup semi-final and final matches in 1994–95 were moved by Juventus to the San Siro in Milan, attracting an audience of 85,000. The Stadio Delle Alpi was very rarely sold out in its history. Finally, in June 2002, Juventus purchased the Delle Alpi from the Turin city council for a fee of around €25 million.

Torino was banned from playing any Serie A matches inside the stadium from 9 March 2003 until 30 June 2003 due to the violence that occurred on 22 February 2003 inside the stadium clash against Milan.

==Attendance==
The stadium attendance record was 63,583 set during a UEFA Champions League semi-final (second leg) between Juventus and Real Madrid on 14 May 2003. During the 1990 FIFA World Cup, the stadium hosted (among others) a second round match between Argentina and Brazil, as well as a semi-final between West Germany and England. Both matches attracted around 60,000 fans.

The Delle Alpi&#x27;s design was widely criticised due to the poor visibility. This was caused mainly by the distance between the stands and the pitch. Views from the lower tier were also restricted due to the positioning of advertising hoardings. The stadium&#x27;s location on the outskirts of town never found favour with fans, and the stadium design left spectators exposed to the elements. These factors contributed to attendances significantly below its capacity; in the 2005–06 season, for example, Juventus&#x27; average attendance was 35,880. In the Coppa Italia home match against Sampdoria in the 2001–02 season, only 237 spectators showed up.

==1990 FIFA World Cup==
The stadium was one of the venues of the 1990 World Cup, hosting five matches. The first four involved Brazil; All their Group C matches (a 2–1 win over Sweden on 10 June, a 1–0 win over Costa Rica on 16 June and a 1–0 win over Scotland on 20 June) and their round of 16 match against Argentina on 24 June, a 1–0 defeat. The fifth match was the semi-final between West Germany and England on 4 July, with the match ending 1–1 but West Germany winning 4–3 on penalties.

==Milestone matches==
==Redevelopment==

The Stadio Delle Alpi was demolished, with plans for a 41,475-seater venue and a number of restaurants and other facilities outside the ground. The new grounds of the stadium covers around 50,000 square metres. The demolition was completed in February 2009. Work on a new stadium began during spring 2009 and it was opened on 8 September 2011, at the start of the 2011–12 season. The running track, which was widely blamed for ruining the atmosphere in the stadium, was removed with the fans moved closer to the action. A roof covers the new seats. A new Juventus training centre was also built next to the stadium, together with a set of buildings for a gymnasium, a restaurant and a hotel.

<doc id="1015988" wikidata="Q207109" url="?curid=1015988" title="Johan Cruyff Arena">
<text>The Johan Cruyff Arena ( ; officially stylised as Johan Cruijff ArenA) is the main stadium of the Dutch capital city of Amsterdam and the home stadium of football club AFC Ajax since its opening. Built from 1993 to 1996 at a cost equivalent to €140 million, it is the largest stadium in the country. The stadium was previously known as the Amsterdam Arena (stylised as &quot;Amsterdam ArenA&quot;) until the 2018–19 football season, when it was officially renamed in honour of Dutch footballer Johan Cruyff who died in 2016.

It was one of the stadiums used during UEFA Euro 2000, and also held the 1998 UEFA Champions League Final and 2013 UEFA Europa League Final. The stadium also hosted three group stage matches and one match in the round of 16 of the UEFA Euro 2020.

Both international and Dutch artists have given concerts in the stadium, including Tina Turner, Coldplay, U2, Take That, Celine Dion, Madonna, Michael Jackson, André Hazes, David Bowie, AC/DC, Justin Timberlake, One Direction, the Rolling Stones, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Taylor Swift and Armin van Buuren. The dance event Sensation was held in the stadium every year, up until the final edition in 2017.

The stadium has a retractable roof and a grass surface. Since 2022, the stadium has a capacity of 55,865 during football matches, increased from 54,990. The stadium has a capacity of 68,000 during music concerts if a center-stage setup is used (the stage in the middle of the pitch); for end-stage music concerts, the capacity is 50,000; and for music concerts for which the stage is located in the east side of the stadium, the capacity is 35,000. It held UEFA five-star stadium status, which was superseded by a new system of classification.

==History==
Amsterdam was one of six cities that bid to host the 1992 Summer Olympics. In 1986, a new Olympic stadium was designed, with a football field and an athletics track. It was to be built in the area of Strandvliet in Amsterdam Zuidoost. After Amsterdam lost the bid to Barcelona in October 1986, the plans for the new stadium were abandoned. In 1987, the Stichting Amsterdam Sportstad (English: &quot;Amsterdam Sports City Foundation&quot;) was established, which made new plans for a sports stadium with an all-seated capacity of 55,000. In 1990, a new design was made based on both previous designs, with a football field, an athletics track, and completely covered by a roof. By this time, AFC Ajax needed a new stadium, as their previous home ground, De Meer, was far too small for most of Ajax&#x27;s games. Since the late 1960s, Ajax had moved its most important games to Olympisch Stadion. Indeed, from the 1930s onward, Ajax had played most of their European fixtures and midweek night games at Olympisch Stadion.

Once more, the design was altered – the athletics track was removed, the capacity was reduced to 50,000 seats, and the fixed roof was replaced by a retractable roof. In 1992, the Government of Amsterdam authorised the plans for the stadium with a &quot;Transferium&quot; where people could transfer from their car to various forms of public transportation. In 1993, the Government of Amsterdam changed the development plan of the location and gave a permit to build the stadium.

The first pile of the deep foundation of the stadium was placed on 26 November 1993. The construction work, undertaken by Ballast Nedam and Royal BAM Group, took almost three years. The highest point of the building was reached on 24 February 1995, after the roof construction was raised. The fly-over from the public road to the parking facilities was opened on 13 March 1996. The stadium received 180,000 visitors during the construction work, until the stadium was closed from 1 July 1996 until the opening ceremony. The stadium was officially opened on 14 August 1996 by Queen Beatrix.

At the grand opening, the queen made a curtain fall inside the stadium. This revealed the world&#x27;s largest painting &quot;De Zee&quot; (English: &quot;The Sea&quot;) of . Two-dimensional ships were placed on the sea representing the clubs in the &quot;Eredivisie&quot;. Trijntje Oosterhuis sang the hymn &quot;De Zee&quot;, composed for the opening ceremony by John Ewbank. An eight-day torch relay with 375 runners over 1400 km through the Netherlands reached the stadium. The first runner was Johan Cruyff starting in the old stadium De Meer, and the last runner was Frank Rijkaard arriving in the new stadium. After the grass was revealed and the roof opened, an inaugural football friendly was played between AFC Ajax and Milan, which Ajax lost 0–3. Tina Turner opened the stadium with three concerts with 160,000 people, from her world breaking Wildest Dreams Tour.

The construction of the stadium cost an equivalent of €140 million (at the time, the currency of the Netherlands was the Dutch guilder).

The stadium combines a retractable roof with a grass surface. This caused some problems in the beginning: the turf&#x27;s grass would not grow in the shade of the open roof and had to be replaced up to four times a year.

===Exterior renovation===

In September 2015, plans were presented to renovate the stadium&#x27;s facade. The renovation should provide better quality and service to visitors by widening the walkway rings around the stadium, creating more room for the visitors and for new facilities (the number of seats remains the same). As a result, the outside of the stadium transforms from a concave shape to a convex shape, drastically altering its appearance. The renovation was completed in 2020, when four matches of the UEFA Euro 2020 championship were played in the Arena.

Construction works started in June 2017. The first phase is to renovate the east side of the stadium, where construction of the new facade was completed in April 2018.

===Name change===

On 25 April 2017, it was announced that the Amsterdam Arena would be renamed to &quot;Johan Cruijff Arena&quot; in memory of Ajax legend Johan Cruyff. Later that year, on 9 August, it was stated that the name change would take place on 25 October 2017. However, this was postponed as that date proved to be infeasible due to the many matters that needed to be settled, such as arranging compensation for possible loss of income, transferring part of the shares from the municipality of Amsterdam to Ajax and having a discussion with the Cruyff family.

On 5 April 2018, it was announced that the stadium would officially change name at the start of the 2018–19 football season. The stadium&#x27;s new logo was revealed on 25 April 2018, the birthday of Johan Cruyff. According to the spokeswoman of Cruyff&#x27;s family, the original Dutch spelling of his name (&quot;Cruijff&quot;) was chosen for the stadium&#x27;s official name &quot;to stay close to the Dutch Johan&quot;. The 2018–19 football season started in August 2018.

==Building and facilities==
The stadium&#x27;s original architect is the Dutchman Rob Schuurman. The original all-seated capacity was 54,990. After the 2019–20 season, but before Euro 2020, capacity was expanded by 660. The final increased capacity after the 2017-2021 renovation project is 56,120, an increase of 1,130. The original capacity during music concerts – the stadium&#x27;s maximum capacity – is 68,000 visitors. The parking capacity of the &quot;Transferium&quot; is 500 cars (inside); there are an additional 12,000 parking spots outside.

The Johan Cruyff Arena is one of two stadiums in the Netherlands that is rated as Category 4 by UEFA, the other being the Feijenoord Stadion in Rotterdam.

The Ajax Museum is located in the stadium, which shows Ajax&#x27;s more than 120 years of history.

The nearest train and subway (metro) station is Amsterdam Bijlmer Arena. The metro lines 50 and 54 (Amsterdam Central Station and city center) stop here.

==Sporting events==

===Association football===

The stadium is the home of AFC Ajax in the Eredivisie and European matches.

The inaugural match on 14 August 1996 was a friendly between the home team Ajax and AC Milan, which ended with a 3–0 win for Milan. The first goal was scored by Dejan Savićević. The first Ajax goal was scored in the first competition match against NAC Breda by Kiki Musampa.

The 1998 UEFA Champions League Final when Real Madrid defeated Juventus by 1–0 due to a goal by Predrag Mijatović, was played in the stadium. It was also one of the venues in UEFA Euro 2000.

And the stadium was the host of the 2013 UEFA Europa League Final, when Chelsea defeated Benfica by 2–1.

It hosts often Dutch national team&#x27;s international matches, though the Netherlands does not have one dedicated national stadium for football.

Since a friendly game in 2015, the stadium hosts regularly matches since 2023 of the AFC Ajax Women. The Klassieker home game against Feyenoord of that year was the first, with an attendance of 33,742 visitors. A year later the same game was played in the stadium aswel. And also the home games of the group stage of the 2023–24 UEFA Women&#x27;s Champions League and the Quarter-final home game against Chelsea Women were venued at the stadium. The game against Chelsea saw a record attendance of 35,991 spectators for a women’s football game in the Netherlands. 

In addition, the stadium hosted pre-season friendlies of Ajax 1 (men) or in the past aswel tournaments, like the Amsterdam Tournament or games of Ajax&#x27;s reserve team.

====Euro 2000====
====Euro 2020====
The stadium hosted three group stage matches and one round of 16 match at the UEFA Euro 2020, which was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. Also there was a smaller attendance because of this.

===American football===
The stadium was home of the American football team Amsterdam Admirals of the NFL Europe, until the National Football League (NFL) ended its European competition in June 2007. The team played over 50 matches in the stadium from 1997 to 2007. World Bowl IX was played at the Arena in 2001, when the Berlin Thunder defeated the Barcelona Dragons.

===Kickboxing===
As kickboxing is a popular combat sport in the Netherlands, the It&#x27;s Showtime and K-1 promotions have held a number of fight cards at the arena. Many of the sport&#x27;s biggest stars such as Peter Aerts, Semmy Schilt, Badr Hari and Ernesto Hoost have fought there.

==Music events==

Dutch music group De Toppers have played annually at the venue since 2005. In total, they have sold out more than 50 concerts; no other act has performed at the stadium that many times. The arena was listed as a potential venue in Amsterdam&#x27;s bid to host the 65th Eurovision Song Contest. However, the city later withdrew its bid due to venues, including the Johan Cruyff Arena, being fully booked.

<text>, (born April 18, 1976) stylized as FAYRAY, is a Japanese singer-songwriter. She made her debut in July 1998 with the single &quot;Taiyō no Gravity&quot;. She grew up in the United States and speaks English.

==Biography==
Fayray is the middle child of a family of three daughters. During her childhood, she listened to American music from the 70s and 80s with her parents which had a big influence on her musical style. At age 4 she began playing classical piano.

Fayray landed a recording contract with the now-defunct Antinos Records label.

After one album, &quot;Craving&quot;, Fayray opted to take full creative control over her music and began writing and composing her own music. She wrote the two b-sides of her fifth single, &quot;Same Night, Same Face&quot; before self-producing her next single, &quot;My Eyes&quot;, and all of her subsequent records.

In 2006, she traveled to New York City in search of new ideas to create her ideal music. There she met avant-garde producer Dougie Bowne and produced two albums with him.

In 2007 the singer resumed performance under the name Mina Ohashi, performing as part of the trio &quot;The Present&quot; with Rusty Santos. The Present&#x27;s debut album as a duo, &quot;FSG&quot;, was released May 12, 2015.

<text>Thiocyanates are salts containing the thiocyanate anion (also known as rhodanide or rhodanate). is the conjugate base of thiocyanic acid. Common salts include the colourless salts potassium thiocyanate and sodium thiocyanate. Mercury(II) thiocyanate was formerly used in pyrotechnics.

Thiocyanate is analogous to the cyanate ion, , wherein oxygen is replaced by sulfur. is one of the pseudohalides, due to the similarity of its reactions to that of halide ions. Thiocyanate used to be known as rhodanide (from a Greek word for rose) because of the red colour of its complexes with iron.

Thiocyanate is produced by the reaction of elemental sulfur or thiosulfate with cyanide:
:

The second reaction is catalyzed by thiosulfate sulfurtransferase, a hepatic mitochondrial enzyme, and by other sulfur transferases, which together are responsible for around 80% of cyanide metabolism in the body.

Oxidation of thiocyanate inevitably produces hydrogen sulfate. The other product depends on pH: in acid, it is hydrogen cyanide, presumably via HOSCN and with a sulfur dicyanide side-product; but in base and neutral solutions, it is cyanate.

==Biology==
===Occurrences===
Thiocyanate occurs widely in nature, albeit often in low concentrations. It is a component of some sulfur cycles.

===Biochemistry===
Thiocyanate hydrolases catalyze the conversion of thiocyanate to carbonyl sulfide and to cyanate:
:

===Medicine ===
Thiocyanate is known to be an important part in the biosynthesis of hypothiocyanite by a lactoperoxidase. Thus the complete absence of thiocyanate or reduced thiocyanate in the human body, (e.g., cystic fibrosis) is damaging to the human host defense system.

Thiocyanate is a potent competitive inhibitor of the thyroid sodium-iodide symporter. Iodine is an essential component of thyroxine. Since thiocyanates will decrease iodide transport into the thyroid follicular cell, they will decrease the amount of thyroxine produced by the thyroid gland. As such, foodstuffs containing thiocyanate are best avoided by iodide deficient hypothyroid patients.

In the early 20th century, thiocyanate was used in the treatment of hypertension, but it is no longer used because of associated toxicity. Sodium nitroprusside, a metabolite of which is thiocyanate, is however still used for the treatment of a hypertensive emergency. Rhodanese catalyzes the reaction of sodium nitroprusside (like other cyanides) with thiosulfate to form the metabolite thiocyanate.

==Coordination chemistry==

Thiocyanate shares its negative charge approximately equally between sulfur and nitrogen. As a consequence, thiocyanate can act as a nucleophile at either sulfur or nitrogen—it is an ambidentate ligand. [SCN]− can also bridge two (M−SCN−M) or even three metals (&gt;SCN− or −SCN&lt;). Experimental evidence leads to the general conclusion that class A metals (hard acids) tend to form &quot;N&quot;-bonded thiocyanate complexes, whereas class B metals (soft acids) tend to form &quot;S&quot;-bonded thiocyanate complexes. Other factors, e.g. kinetics and solubility, are sometimes involved, and linkage isomerism can occur, for example [Co(NH3)5(NCS)]Cl2 and [Co(NH3)5(SCN)]Cl2. It [SCN] is considered as a weak ligand. (NCS] is a strong ligand)
===Test for iron(III) and cobalt(II)===
If [SCN]− is added to a solution with iron(III) ions, a blood-red solution forms mainly due to the formation of [Fe(NCS)(H2O)5]2+, i.e. pentaaqua(thiocyanato-&quot;N&quot;)iron(III). Lesser amounts of other hydrated compounds also form: e.g. Fe(SCN)3 and [Fe(SCN)4]−.

Similarly, Co2+ gives a blue complex with thiocyanate. Both the iron and cobalt complexes can be extracted into organic solvents like diethyl ether or amyl alcohol. This allows the determination of these ions even in strongly coloured solutions. The determination of Co(II) in the presence of Fe(III) is possible by adding KF to the solution, which forms uncoloured, very stable complexes with Fe(III), which no longer react with SCN−.

Phospholipids or some detergents aid the transfer of thiocyanatoiron into chlorinated solvents like chloroform and can be determined in this fashion.

He was the first African American to reach that rank in the United States Army. In 1998, he was court-martialed on a variety of charges including sexual harassment and obstruction of justice. He was convicted of the obstruction of justice charge and demoted to the rank of master sergeant.

==Early life and education==
McKinney was born in Monticello, Florida, on November 3, 1950. He is one of six siblings, all of whom served in the United States Army. One served as an officer; one retired as a Master Sergeant; another served in the Vietnam War; and an identical twin, James C. McKinney, was a Command Sergeant Major.

==Military career==
McKinney enlisted in the United States Army in August 1968, and completed Basic Training as a Cavalryman at Fort Knox, Kentucky. From 1969 to 1970, he saw combat in the Vietnam War with the 173rd Airborne Brigade. In more than 28 years, he served in all noncommissioned officer leadership positions. He was command sergeant major of the United States Army Europe; 8th Infantry Division (Mechanized), Bad Kreuznach, Germany; 1st Brigade, 1st Armored Division in Vilseck, Germany; 612th Quartermaster Battalion at Fort Bragg, North Carolina; 1st Battalion, 58th Mechanized Infantry, 197th Infantry Brigade at Fort Benning, Georgia; 3rd Squadron, 12th Cavalry Regiment in Büdingen, Germany; 3rd and 4th Squadron, 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment at Fort Bliss, Texas; and 2nd Squadron, 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment in Bamberg, Germany. He is a graduate of the United States Army Sergeants Major Academy, Class 31.

===Sexual harassment allegations and dismissal===
In the fall of 1996, allegations of sexual misconduct by training cadre at Aberdeen Proving Ground and several other United States Army postings surfaced, and the Army instituted a substantial investigation with a toll-free telephone hotline that received nearly 60,000 calls within a matter of weeks. The task force established by Secretary of the Army, Togo D. West, Jr., to advise him about the situation included McKinney as the spokesman of the Army enlisted soldiers. In February 1997, McKinney was himself accused by a female former subordinate of improper advances. The Army suspended him from his duties that month while the charges were investigated; in May–October of that year, two Command Sergeants Major, one being McKinney&#x27;s twin brother, James C. McKinney; the other Jerry T. Alley—took over his duties in rotation. While McKinney was suspended from his duties as Sergeant Major of the Army, five more female soldiers accused him of similar improprieties. In November 1997, the Article 32 investigating panel (U.S. military counterpart to a grand jury) completed its investigation and recommended charges for a court-martial. McKinney was thereupon permanently reassigned out of his billet and laterally redesignated to the rank of Command Sergeant Major; his successor, Robert E. Hall, was promptly installed.

McKinney was acquitted of all sexual harassment charges, but was convicted of obstruction of justice and received a reduction in grade to Master Sergeant and a reprimand. Though he retired as a Master Sergeant, his retirement pay was calculated using the pay rate he earned during his tenure as Sergeant Major of the Army, in accordance with 10 USC § 1406(i)(1). That law was subsequently amended by 10 USC § 1406(i)(2)(A) to prevent a recurrence.

==Felony vehicular charge==
On October 25, 2010, McKinney allegedly hit a man with his car on purpose, and was charged with felony malicious wounding. This occurred following an incident in which McKinney drove erratically after picking up two slug passengers in Occoquan, Virginia. When the passengers exited the car, one of them attempted to take a photograph of McKinney&#x27;s license plate, and claimed that McKinney drove his car into him.

Based on the preliminary hearing in April 2011, a judge ruled that the evidence in the case was sufficient to proceed to trial. McKinney was indicted for malicious wounding (a felony) and reckless driving (a misdemeanor).

McKinney submitted an Alford plea, which the court accepted. As a part of his plea agreement the felony charge was reduced to disorderly conduct. He was also sentenced to twelve months of incarceration, of which the judge suspended all but 10 days. McKinney was given credit for time served and only had to serve an additional two days.

<text>Jönåker is a locality situated in Nyköping Municipality, Södermanland County, Sweden with 617 inhabitants in 2010. Jönåker is known locally for being situated right on a steep hill by local standards and the trading house, the so-called &quot;Kalle in the hill&quot; former gas station (). The railway passes through Jönåker, but trains do not stop there, instead twisting around the hill on the route between Nyköping and Norrköping.

==Elections==
Jönåker forms the Lunda electoral district in Nyköping Municipality, named after the local church atop the hill that Jönåker sits beneath. Lunda used to be a swing district in that it can go the way of both traditional coalitions, although it is solidly to the right of urban Nyköping throughout its history. Since 1973, while the district swung back and forth between the coalitions several times, the winning margins were rarely close. In 2022, the area had shifted back decisively to the right and became the only district where the Sweden Democrats won a major plurality in the municipality.

<doc id="1016040" wikidata="Q512076" url="?curid=1016040" title="Asian Kung-Fu Generation">
<text>(stylized in all caps) is a Japanese alternative rock band formed in Yokohama in 1996. For its entire career, the band has consisted of vocalist Masafumi Gotoh, guitarist Kensuke Kita, bassist Takahiro Yamada, and drummer Kiyoshi Ijichi. Starting out as a college band, Asian Kung-Fu Generation released a series of independent EPs featuring lyrics mostly sung in English. In 2002, they released their major-label EP debut &quot;Hōkai Amplifier&quot;, from that point singing their lyrics in Japanese. The band&#x27;s musical style is influenced by seminal Western alternative rock acts as well as their own local Japanese indie rock and punk scene. Their songs incorporate various aspects of the genres, most typically expressing fast tempos and prominent power chord guitar riffs in addition to rhythmic groove and emotional lyrics. Despite the indie nature of their music, the band has enjoyed worldwide commercial success in addition to critical acclaim. Asian Kung-Fu Generation has been cited as one of the best, most balanced modern rock bands to emerge from Japan in the 2000s.

==History==

===1996–2002: Formation and indie releases===
Asian Kung-Fu Generation was first formed in 1996 when Masafumi Gotoh, Kensuke Kita, and Takahiro Yamada met while attending a music club at Kanto Gakuin University, a private university in Yokohama, Japan. After realizing that they all shared similar musical tastes, the three decided to start their own band. Masafumi Gotoh became the lead vocalist and played rhythm guitar, Kensuke Kita played lead guitar and sang backup and Takahiro Yamada played bass. Drummer Kiyoshi Ijichi joined them later on after parting with another college band he was in. The four then began providing performances at their university as well as throughout the local Yokohama area. After graduating from college, following years of playing in several small venues and having collaborated with fellow Japanese rock musician Caramelman, AKFG released their first indie EP in 2000. The six-track EP contained original lyrics written and sung almost entirely in English. The four spent the remainder of the year playing in clubs and hosting independent events.

The year after, the band made an attempt to attain airplay on indie radio stations for their first Japanese single, . The song was eventually picked up by a popular radio DJ and put into heavy rotation on the station FM Yokohama upon the demand of listeners. AKFG then released another indie EP, &quot;I&#x27;m Standing Here&quot;. This time, however, the band wrote songs in Japanese. At this time, the band had begun drawing an increasingly large number of audiences to their shows held in clubs in the districts of Shibuya, Shimokitazawa, Kichijōji, and Tokyo.

===2002–2004: &quot;Hōkai Amplifier&quot; and &quot;Kimi Tsunagi Five M&quot;===

On November 25, 2002, after contributing to the Under Flowers Records compilation, &quot;Whatch You Gonna Do?&quot;, Asian Kung–Fu Generation officially released their first major-label mini-album, . The group enlisted internet radio host and graphic artist Yusuke Nakamura to design and compose their single and album covers. The critically acclaimed EP topped the High Line Records&#x27; weekly chart for two consecutive weeks and peaked at number thirty-five on the Oricon indies sales chart.

As a result of its success, &quot;Hōkai Amplifier&quot; was re-released on April 23, 2003, by the band&#x27;s new record label, Ki/oon Records, a subsidiary of Sony Music Japan. A month later, AKFG held their first headline show at Shimokitazawa Club Shelter. That same summer, the band performed at the annual rock festivals of Fuji Rock Festival 03&#x27;s &quot;ROOKIE A GO GO&quot; and Summer Sonic &#x27;03 in Tokyo and Osaka. On August 6, the band released their major-label debut single, , with their second single, , following shortly after. Days later, AKG held the first edition of what would become an annual festival, the Nano-Mugen Fes. The event took place on August 11 at the Shinjuku LOFT.

===2004–2005: &quot;Sol-fa&quot;===

As they entered 2004, AKFG received the award for Best New Artist while their video for &quot;Kimi to Iu Hana&quot; won the award for Best Music Video at the SPACE SHOWER Music Video Awards.

The album debuted at number-one on the Oricon charts where it stayed for two consecutive weeks and eventually went on to sell more than 600,000 copies. The album received critical praise for its honed sound and high production quality, which thoroughly nullified the language barrier that frequently impeded non–Japanese-speaking audiences. This notion became evident following the domestic release of &quot;Sol-fa&quot;, when AKFG fans from around the world organized themselves and petitioned for copies of the second album to be distributed outside Japan. The support for Ajikan eventually resulted in Tofu Records striking a contract to release &quot;Sol-fa&quot; in the United States on October 18, 2005. Additionally, the song &quot;Rewrite&quot; found recognition both domestically as well as on an international level when it was chosen as the fourth opening theme for the anime series &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot;.

The DVD is compilation of the music videos for all singles from &quot;Haruka Kanata&quot; to &quot;Kimi no Machi Made,&quot; including a never before seen clip of &quot;Siren.&quot; The video contains audio commentary for each song, a making-of featurette, and live footage derived from their concerts. In 2016, the song &quot;&quot; was rerecorded and used as the opening for the anime &quot;Erased&quot;.

===2005–2007: &quot;Fanclub&quot; and &quot;Feedback File&quot;===

Due in part to their growing recognition, Asian Kung-Fu Generation would dedicate a significant amount of time the next couple of years going on extensive national tours.

The band began 2006 with the release of their upcoming album&#x27;s second single, &quot;World Apart.&quot; The single was unique in that it featured a song in which Kensuke Kita stood as lead singer. It was AKFG&#x27;s first song to achieve number-one single status, also it was the year that the band was finally able to acquire their very own studio.

To commemorate their ten-year anniversary, Asian Kung–Fu Generation released their first compilation album, &quot;Feedback File&quot; on October 25. Rather than featuring hit singles, the nostalgic album was primarily compiled of B-sides, live performances, and old demos from their early indie days. Even though it retained little new material, the compilation was met by commercial success and managed to debut at number two on the Oricon charts. AKFG then went on a two-month arena tour entitled, Tour Sui Cup 2006-2007: The Start of a New Season. Well over 100,000 fans attended this tour, which traveled through eight cities and featured guest performances by bands from Japan and the United States. In the midst of the tour, AKFG was commissioned by the director of the then-upcoming anime film, &quot;Tekkon Kinkreet&quot;, to compose a theme song for the movie. The band created a song called, and released it as a year-end single prior to the film&#x27;s debut. As a sign of their increasing cultural prominence, the band came to be parodied in a volume of the popular &quot;Hellsing&quot; manga by members of the Vatican named, &quot;The Vactikung.&quot;

==Musical style==

The musical style of Asian Kung-Fu Generation largely has been influenced by seminal 1990s alternative rock and indie-rock bands, particularly Weezer, Oasis, Teenage Fanclub, Radiohead, Supergrass, Manic Street Preachers, Smashing Pumpkins and Beck. This is in conjunction with a wide variety of other genres, ranging from pop, garage, new wave, hardcore punk, and heavy metal. Members of ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION have imparted to being fans of Western music groups including The Beatles, XTC, The Pet Shop Boys and King Bee as well as fellow Japanese acts such as Number Girl, Eastern Youth, and Hi-Standard. As a result, many of the band&#x27;s songs maintain a distinct balance of various elements of the genres, most typically expressing fast tempos, strong melodies, clear vocals, loud and distorted guitars, power chord sequences, rhythmic groove, hook-filled refrains, transgressive lyrics, and emotional delivery. Over the course of their career, the members of Asian Kung-Fu Generation, like most Japanese rock musicians, prefer to slightly expand their core sonic style with every release rather than drastically reinvent themselves. However, with their sixth studio album, the band uncharacteristically incorporated brass instruments, synthesizers, and string arrangements into their music. Ijichi is also a skilled pianist and can be heard playing an excerpt of &quot;Claire de Lune&quot; from French composer Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Suite bergamasque&quot; on their third studio album &quot;Fanclub&quot;.

Leader singer Masafumi Gotoh typically employs quiet-loud dynamics, as his vocal style often alternates between soft, melodic singing, and harder, harsher, yelling. Gotoh serves as the band&#x27;s main songwriter and is responsible writing a majority of their lyrics alongside playing the rhythm guitar. However, Gotoh tends to share songwriting duties among his bandmates, particularly with bassist Takahiro Yamada, whom he sometimes harmonizes with on songs. Lead guitarist Kensuke Kita also serves as a backup singer, and has been known to sing lead vocals on occasion.

<text>Rekarne () is the historical name for the north-western part of the province Södermanland in Sweden. It constitutes the lands on both sides of river Eskilstunaån between Lake Mälaren and Lake Hjälmaren and approximately corresponds to the present day Eskilstuna Municipality.

Historically, Rekarne was from the mid-14th century for administrative purposes divided into:

*West Rekarne hundred 
*East Rekarne hundred

and the chartered towns of Torshälla (est. 1317) and Eskilstuna (1659).

Since the large administrative reforms of the mid-20th century, leading to the establishment of Eskilstuna Municipality within its current borders in 1971, the name &quot;Rekarne&quot; no longer carries any administrative significance, but survives in some local place names, the name of the local &quot;Sparbanken Rekarne&quot; bank and the &quot;Rekarnegymnasiet&quot; upper secondary school. The railway station &quot;Rekarne&quot; in Tumbo only exists as a siding today.

Some localities in the area, like Husby-Rekarne, carry the &quot;Rekarne&quot; name to distinguish them from other similarly named localities in Sweden. The locality named &quot;Rekarne&quot; next to the Rekarne railway station was redefined under the name &quot;Tumbo&quot; by Statistics Sweden in 1990.

<text>Calvin Marshall Trillin (born December 5, 1935) is an American journalist, humorist, food writer, poet, memoirist and novelist. He is a winner of the Thurber Prize for American Humor (2012) and an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters (2008).

== Early life and education ==
Calvin Trillin was born in Kansas City, Missouri in 1935 to Edythe and Abe Trillin. In his book &quot;Messages from My Father&quot;, he said his parents called him &quot;Buddy&quot;. Raised Jewish, he attended public schools in Kansas City, graduated from Southwest High School, and went on to Yale University, where he was the roommate and friend of Peter M. Wolf (for whose 2013 memoir, &quot;My New Orleans, Gone Away&quot;, he wrote a humorous foreword), and where he served as chair of the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot; and was a member of the Pundits and Scroll and Key before graduating in 1957; he later served as a Fellow of the University.

== Career ==
After serving in the U.S. Army, Trillin worked as a reporter for &quot;Time&quot; magazine, then joined the staff of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1963. He wrote the magazine&#x27;s &quot;U.S. Journal&quot; series from 1967 to 1982, covering local events both serious and quirky throughout the United States. His reporting for the magazine on the racial integration of the University of Georgia was published in his first book, &quot;An Education in Georgia&quot; (1964).

From 1975 to 1987, Trillin contributed articles to &quot;Moment&quot;, an independent magazine which focuses on the life of the American Jewish community.

Trillin also writes for &quot;The Nation&quot;. He began in 1978 with a column called &quot;Variations&quot;, which was eventually renamed &quot;Uncivil Liberties&quot;; it ran through 1985. The same name was used for the column when it was syndicated weekly in newspapers, from 1986 to 1995, and essentially the same column ran (without a name) in &quot;Time&quot; from 1996 to 2001. His humor columns for &quot;The Nation&quot; during the 1980s and 1990s often made fun of then-editor Victor Navasky, whom he jokingly referred to as &quot;the wily and parsimonious&quot; Navasky. (He once wrote that the magazine paid &quot;in the high two figures.&quot;) Since July 1990, Trillin has written humorous poems about current events as part of his weekly &quot;Deadline Poet&quot; column in &quot;The Nation&quot;.

Family, travel and food are major themes in Trillin&#x27;s work. Three of his books on food — &quot;American Fried&quot; (1974), &quot;Alice, Let&#x27;s Eat&quot; (1978) and &quot;Third Helpings&quot; (1983) — were collected in the 1994 compendium &quot;The Tummy Trilogy.&quot; Trillin has also written several autobiographical books and magazine articles, including &quot;Messages from My Father&quot; (1996), &quot;Family Man&quot; (1998), and an essay in the March 27, 2006 issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Alice, Off the Page&quot;, discussing his late wife. In December 2006, a slightly expanded version of the essay was published as a book titled &quot;About Alice&quot;. In &quot;Messages from My Father&quot;, Trillin recounts how his father always expected his son to be a Jew, but had primarily &quot;raised me to be an American&quot;.

Trillin has also written a collection of short stories, &quot;Barnett Frummer is an Unbloomed Flower&quot; (1969), and three comic novels, &quot;Runestruck&quot; (1977), &quot;Floater&quot; (1980), and &quot;Tepper Isn&#x27;t Going Out&quot; (2002). The latter novel is about a man who enjoys parking in New York City for its own sake and is unusual among novels for exploring the subject of parking.

In 2008, Trillin was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. The same year, The Library of America selected Trillin&#x27;s essay &quot;Stranger with a Camera&quot; for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American True Crime. In 2012, Trillin was awarded the Thurber Prize for American Humor for &quot;Quite Enough of Calvin Trillin: Forty Years of Funny Stuff&quot;, published by Random House. In 2013, he was inducted into the New York Writers Hall of Fame.

== Personal life ==
In 1965, Trillin married the educator and writer Alice Stewart Trillin, with whom he had two daughters. Alice died in 2001. He also has four grandchildren. Trillin lives in the Greenwich Village area of New York City.

Trillin was a close friend of Joan Didion and her husband John Gregory Dunne. He met Dunne when the two worked at &quot;Time&quot; in the 1960s. Dunne wrote an afterword to Trillin&#x27;s 1993 book &quot;Remembering Denny&quot; and Trillin contributed a foreword to Dunne&#x27;s posthumously released collection &quot;Regards&quot; (2005). In September 2022, Trillin was one of the speakers at Didion&#x27;s memorial service in New York City.

==Trivia==
* Wyse is with the same recording company as Kyary Pamyu Pamyu, Warner Music Japan.
* In an interview when asked what members they would date if they were women replied with &quot;MORI or HIRO.&quot; (Tsukimori), &quot;None of them because I hate them all.&quot; (HIRO), &quot;I would prefer myself because I&#x27;m a bit of a narcissist.&quot; (TAKUMA). MORI didn&#x27;t reply but their ex drummer KENJI replied with &quot;Tsukimori because I like him.&quot;
* When asked in the same interview what would they be if not for Wyse, Tsukimori replied with the silly answer &quot;A dog.&quot;
* Wyse are best friends with the band Waive.
* Waive broke up the same year as Wyse and got back together also the same year as Wyse. Both bands also no longer have an official drummer.

<text>The marsh owl (Asio capensis) is a medium to large species of owl in the family Strigidae.


== Description ==
Medium-sized, dark brown with a pumpkin-shaped head with small &#x27;ear&#x27; tufts. The facial disc is pale buff, with a distinct dark brown rim with buff speckles. There is a dark brown area around the eyes, which are also dark brown. Its ear-tufts are earth-brown and quite small, often not visible, and set near the centre of the forehead. The tail is dark brown, barred pale buff with a whitish tip. Tarsi are feathered pale tawny-buff and toes are covered with pale buffish plumes, leaving the dark brown tips bare. Claws are blackish.

Males are generally paler than females, and there is some individual variation in tone. Length is 31–38 cm, wing length is 284–380mm, tail length is 132–186mm, and weight is 225–485g.

== Habitat ==
The marsh owl&#x27;s habitat preference is open grassland, marshlands and short scrub, typically near marshy grounds, vleis or dams. Marsh owls prefer to nest on the ground and they have also been observed leaving certain areas during drought-stricken times. Their preferred habitat tends to be vulnerable to destruction due to agriculture or overgrazing.

== Breeding ==
Nesting usually occurs towards the end of the wet season or the start of the dry season. The owls are monogamous and often territorial. They may nest in loose colonies. Territories are normally 0.8–2.5 square km but may be even smaller in denser populations. Hunting areas of neighboring pairs may overlap. The nest is typically a hollow within a patch of grass, in which the grass or shrubs are pulled over to form a canopy, and the bottom is lined with dry foliage.

The female will lay between 2–6 white eggs over the course of a few days. The incubation period is 27–28 days, and during this time the female will remain on the eggs and will be fed by her partner. After hatching the chicks will remain in the nest until about 18 days. They will fully fledge at 29–35 days and be fully feathered by 70 days.

== Behavior and diet ==

Marsh owls are typically found singly or in pairs. They are usually nocturnal; however, they are sometimes active during early morning and late afternoon.

The marsh owl typically feeds on small rodents, insects and other small vertebrates. Prey items include mice, voles, rats, shrews, young hares, bats, birds up to the size of small ducks and doves, frogs, lizards, scorpions, beetles and grasshoppers.

== Distribution ==
The marsh owl has a fragmented distribution. They are common in the grasslands of southern Africa, occurring in the northern regions of South Africa down to the province of the Eastern Cape. They are also found in Zimbabwe on the Mashonaland plateau, and in the Makgadikgadi lacustrine depression in Botswana.

They have also been recorded on the floodplains on the Namibian coast and in isolated populations in Morocco and Madagascar.

== Conservation status ==

Marsh owls are not listed as vulnerable or endangered, but their population is on the decline mainly due to loss of habitat through urbanization. Marsh owls commonly breed during the winter months when veld fires occur. They nest on the ground in habitat that typically includes marshes, savannas and grasslands. Farmers burn veld to stimulate the regrowth of vegetation for grazing, to prevent the encroachment of unwanted plants and weeds and to control ticks. Although veld fires are necessary for maintaining the grassland’s ecosystem, it should be limited to a 5-year cycle instead of an annual event. Irresponsible burning of veld robs wildlife of habitat and in the case of marsh owls, it has a huge impact on their breeding and population.

<text>Victoria, Lady Welby (27 April 1837 – 29 March 1912), more correctly Lady Welby-Gregory, was a self-educated British philosopher of language, musician and watercolourist.

==Early life==
Welby was born to the Hon. Charles Stuart-Wortley-Mackenzie and Lady Emmeline Stuart-Wortley, and christened Victoria Alexandrina Maria Louisa Stuart-Wortley. Following the death of her father in 1844, she travelled widely with her mother, and recorded her travel experiences in her diary. When her mother died on their travels in Syria in 1855, she returned to England to stay with her grandfather, John Manners, the 5th Duke of Rutland, at Belvoir Castle. In 1858 she moved to Frogmore to live with a friend of her mother&#x27;s – the Duchess of Kent, Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, Queen Victoria&#x27;s mother. On the death of the duchess she was appointed a maid of honour to her godmother, the Queen herself.

In 1863 she married Sir William Earle Welby-Gregory, 4th baronet (1829–1898), who was active in British politics. She and Sir William lived together at Denton Manor in Lincolnshire. They had three children, including a daughter, Nina, who married Edwardian rake and publisher Harry Cust.

==Academic career==
Once her children were grown and had moved out of the house, Welby, who had had little formal education, began a fairly intense process of self-education. This included mixing, corresponding, and conversing with some of the leading British thinkers of her day, some of whom she invited to the Manor. It was not unusual for Victorian Englishmen of means to become thinkers and writers (e.g. Darwin, Lord Acton, J. S. Mill, Charles Babbage). Welby is one of the few women of her place and time to do the same.

Her early publications were on Christian theology, and particularly addressed the interpretation of the Christian scriptures. The first, &quot;Links and Clues&quot;, was published in 1881, but like several that followed was little read and noticed. The process of wondering why this was so led Welby to become interested in language, rhetoric, persuasion, and philosophy. By the late 19th century, she was publishing articles in the leading English language academic journals of the day, such as &quot;Mind&quot; and &quot;The Monist&quot;. She published her first philosophical book, &quot;What Is Meaning? Studies in the Development of Significance&quot; in 1903, following it with &quot;Significs and Language: The Articulate Form of Our Expressive and Interpretive Resources&quot;, in 1911. That same year, &quot;Significs&quot;, the name she gave to her theory of meaning, was the title of a long article she contributed to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. Her writings on the reality of time culminated in her article &quot;Time As Derivative&quot; (1907).

&quot;What Is Meaning?&quot; was sympathetically reviewed for &quot;The Nation&quot; by the founder of American pragmatism, Charles Sanders Peirce, which led to an eight-year correspondence between them, one that has been published three times, most recently as Hardwick (2001). Welby and Peirce were both academic outsiders, and their approaches to language and meaning had some things in common. But most of the correspondence consists of Peirce elaborating his related theory of semiotics. Welby&#x27;s replies did not conceal that she found Peirce hard to follow, but by circulating copies of some of Peirce&#x27;s letters to her, she did much to introduce Peirce to British thinkers. Contemporary Peircians have since returned the favour by being sympathetic students of Welby&#x27;s ideas.

C. K. Ogden began corresponding with Welby in 1910, and his subsequent writings were very much influenced by her theories, although he tried to minimise this fact in his best-known book, &quot;The Meaning of Meaning&quot; (1923). She also corresponded with William James, F. C. S. Schiller, Mary Everest Boole, the Italian pragmatists Giovanni Vailati and Mario Calderoni, F.H. Bradley, Bertrand Russell, J. Cook Wilson and Henri Bergson.

Welby&#x27;s varied activities included founding the Sociological Society of Great Britain and the Decorative Needlework Society, and writing poetry and plays.

==Significs==
&quot;&quot;...every one of us is in one sense a born explorer: our only choice is what world we will explore, our only doubt whether our exploration will be worth the trouble. [...] And the idlest of us wonders: the stupidest of us stares: the most ignorant of us feels curiosity: while the thief actively explores his neighbour&#x27;s pocket or breaks into the &quot;world&quot; of his neighbour&#x27;s house and plate-closet&quot;&quot;. (&quot;Sense, meaning, and interpretation (I)&quot; &quot;Mind&quot; N.S. V; 1898)

Welby&#x27;s concern with the problem of meaning included (perhaps especially) the everyday use of language, and she coined the word &quot;significs&quot; for her approach (replacing her first choice of &quot;sensifics&quot;). She preferred &quot;significs&quot; to semiotics and semantics, because the latter were theory-laden, and because &quot;significs&quot; pointed to her specific area of interest, which other approaches to language had tended to ignore.

She distinguished between different kinds of sense, and developed the various relations between them and ethical, aesthetic, , and social values. She posited three main kinds of sense: &quot;sense&quot;, &quot;meaning&quot;, and &quot;significance&quot;. In turn, these corresponded to three levels of consciousness, which she called &quot;planetary&quot;, &quot;solar&quot;, and &quot;cosmic&quot;, and explained in terms of a sort of Darwinian theory of evolution. The triadic structure of her thinking was a feature she shared with Peirce.

Welby&#x27;s theories on signification in general were one of a number of approaches to the theory of language that emerged in the late 19th century and anticipated contemporary semantics, semiotics, and semiology. Welby had a direct effect on the Significs group, most of whose members were Dutch, including Gerrit Mannoury and Frederik van Eeden. Hence she indirectly influenced L. E. J. Brouwer, the founder of intuitionistic logic.

==Legacy==
Following her death in 1912, Sir Charles Welby presented her collection of books to the University of London Library.

In March 2023, she was one of a number of notable women with a connection to Grantham honoured by South Kesteven District Council.

<text>Kurt Adolff (5 November 1921 – 24 January 2012) was a racing driver from Germany.

Adolff was born in Stuttgart, Germany, into a family that owned a textile company, and served as a paratrooper during the Second World War. Adolff competed in Formula Two races in the early 1950s racing BMW-engined cars, achieving modest success including second place at a race at the Munich-Riem Airport. He later competed in a Ferrari 500 during 1953, and participated in the 1953 German Grand Prix, driving Rudi Fischer&#x27;s Ferrari 500 for the Ecurie Espadon Team.

<text>(, , BAT) is a tactical special operations unit of the Romanian Intelligence Service.

==History==
The unit was established on December 15, 1977 under the name of (&quot;Special Counter-terrorism Unit&quot;, USLA) as a result of the emergence of terrorist threats that were directly or indirectly aimed at Romania.

USLA confronted attempts by members or sympathizers of different terrorist organizations to enter Romania. These organizations did not limit themselves to precursory acts of preparing violent actions, but they also tried to organize terrorist attacks, the targets generally being foreign official representatives in Bucharest.

On May 26, 1985, two Arab terrorists placed explosive devices under the cars belonging to Syrian students&#x27; leaders, in the Grozăvești Campus parking lot in Bucharest. Two USLA officers were killed by the blast of the device while trying to defuse it.

USLA units were involved in the violent crackdown of anti-communist demonstrations during the Romanian Revolution of 1989.

On December 24, 1989, the USLA was called upon by the new Defence Minister Nicolae Militaru to protect the site of the Ministry of Defence from alleged terrorist attacks. The tanks guarding the site opened fire and killed eight officers, while the other six survivors were arrested and one fled. This deadly hoax was used by the new authorities to claim that the terrorist threat really existed.

On the December 26, 1989, the USLA was attached to the Romanian Ministry of Defence. On July 1, 1990, the name of the unit was changed to Brigada Antiteroristă and incorporated into the newly created Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI).

On August 20, 1991, four Sikh terrorists attempted to assassinate the Indian ambassador while he walked with his wife on the Aviatorilor Boulevard in Bucharest. The quick intervention of anti-terrorist officers guarding the ambassador resulted in failure for the terrorists: one was killed on the spot, another was captured, the third was injured, and the fourth person vanished. The criminal investigation revealed that the four terrorists belonged to an Indian Sikh terrorist group.

==Current activities==
At present, there is an increased flow of information shared with partner-foreign services tasked with fighting terrorism. Backed up by state-of-the-art equipment and counter-terrorism tactics, the unit is always on the alert.

Following the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, the Inspectorate for Preventing and Fighting Terrorism was confronted with new challenges. To tackle the new terrorist threats, specialized units of the Romanian Intelligence Service implemented special plans designed for such circumstances.

<text>Hits Radio North East, formerly Metro Radio, is an Independent Local Radio station based in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, owned and operated by Bauer Media Audio UK as part of the Hits Radio network. The station launched in 1974 as Metro Radio. It broadcasts to County Durham, Northumberland, and Tyne and Wear.

As of September 2024, the station has a weekly audience of 338,000 listeners according to RAJAR.

==History==
===Launch as Metro Radio===
The Newcastle-based station, broadcasting to North-East England, launched on 15 July 1974. The first breakfast show was presented by Don Dwyer, an Australian radio presenter formerly at ABC and the United Biscuits Network. The first show included messages of congratulations from Kenny Everett at the equivalent local commercial station in London, Capital Radio.

===Studios===

The station transmitted from a studio in Swalwell, Gateshead, which in later years would be adjacent to the Metrocentre and is now Metropolitan House—a business centre providing serviced office accommodation. Metro, and sister station Magic 1152, moved in 2005 to the former BT building previously known as Swan Housenow known as 55° Northnext to the Tyne Bridge in Newcastle upon Tyne. In April 2021, it was announced that Metro Radio were relocating their studios once more. Later in 2021 as planned, they relocated their broadcasting studios to the Grade II listed building, Gainsborough House on Newcastle&#x27;s Grey Street. Before the move, the studio had undergone a purposed fit-out which included 2 additional studios and a contemporary, flexible office space.

===Football commentary===
Until 2005 the station broadcast live football commentary for the region&#x27;s two biggest clubs; Newcastle United and Sunderland. In an attempt to boost ratings, the football commentary was stopped. However, a negative response from football fans prompted the owners to cover all Newcastle and Sunderland games on sister station Magic 1152.

===TFM co-location===
From 8 April 2013, all Metro Radio&#x27;s programming has been shared with TFM. However, the Metro Radio branding was retained along with separate advertising and local news bulletins. The two stations were able to co-locate without consultation, for the Metro Radio licence area is located in one approved broadcast area (north-east England).
===Hits Radio rebrand===
On 17 April 2024 at 6am, Metro Radio was rebranded to Hits Radio North East, officially marking the end of the end of the Metro Radio brand after nearly 50 years of broadcasting. The website for which had been replaced with the Hits Radio website earlier that morning. The station&#x27;s local news and regional output will not be affected as a result of the relaunch. The rebranded was part of a network-wide relaunch involving 17 Bauer-owned local radio stations in England and Wales.

From 10-14 February 2025, no local breakfast programming was broadcast from studios in Newcastle. Instead, London based networked programming was relayed. This is because of the new Media Act which now allows 24/7 programming from outside the TSA.

==Programming==
Local programming (&quot;Steve &amp; Karen&#x27;s Breakfast Show&quot;) airs 6-10am on weekdays from Bauer&#x27;s Newcastle studios.

At all other times networked programming airs via Bauer&#x27;s London headquarters or studios in Birmingham and Manchester.

==News==
Regional news bulletins air hourly from 6am-7pm on weekdays, and from 7am-1pm on Saturdays and Sundays. Headlines are broadcast on the half-hour during weekday breakfast and drivetime shows, alongside traffic bulletins.

National bulletins from other Bauer newsrooms or Sky News Radio are at other times.

<text>London Greek Radio (LGR) is an Independent Local Radio station for London&#x27;s Greek community, most of which forms part of the ethnically diverse Cypriot community. It broadcasts in both Greek and English on 103.3 FM in London and is also available on DAB in Birmingham and Manchester.

LGR was first founded in October 1983 by Chris Harmanda and George Power (later to set up Kiss FM), and started life as a pirate radio station. On 13 November 1989, it commenced legal broadcasting as part of the Independent Broadcasting Authority &quot;incremental radio&quot; licenses. It initially shared its frequency with another former pirate station, WNK. They become the first stations to share a frequency and they alternated every four hours. This continued until 1993 when WNK went into liquidation and closed down.

It is currently based in the North London suburb of Finchley. The station has a focus on Greek and Cypriot music, with some music sung in Armenian and Turkish. It includes news from the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation (CyBC). It serves advertising for many Greek and Cypriot run businesses in and around North London. LGR has recently increased its English language air-time due to a lack of Greek-speaking young Londoners listening, particularly in the evenings as part of the &quot;New Generation&quot; show.

According to market research from 2007, its audience today consists mainly of Greek Cypriots and other Greeks, as well as Turkish, Armenian and Maronite Cypriots. Listeners also include other people of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean ancestry, especially Arabs and Jews, and Italians.

<text>Smooth Lake District is an Independent Local Radio station for the Lakes, owned and operated by Global and part of the Smooth network.

==Overview==

Originally known as Lakeland Radio, the station broadcasts from transmitters at Kendal on 100.1 MHz, the western side of Lake Windermere on 100.8 MHz and Keswick Forest on 101.4 MHz.

Originally licensed to serve the South Lakes, the station&#x27;s coverage area extended northwards on 23 April 2013 when it began broadcasting to Keswick and surrounding villages. Part of the service area overlaps with that of its Lancaster-based sister station The Bay (now Heart North Lancashire &amp; Cumbria).

On 20 November 2017, CN Group announced Lakeland Radio would be sold to Global along with sister station The Bay - the sale was finalised by 1 December 2017. Global later announced Lakeland Radio would become part of the Smooth network.

The Lakeland Radio brand and programming were phased out in February 2018 and following a transition period, the station was relaunched as Smooth Lake District at 6 am on Monday 5 March 2018.

In September 2019, the station closed its Kendal studios and co-located with sister station Smooth North West in Manchester.

Following OFCOM&#x27;s decision to relax local content obligations from commercial radio, Smooth&#x27;s local Drivetime and weekend shows were replaced by network programming from London. Local news bulletins, traffic updates, and advertising were retained, alongside the station&#x27;s Lake District breakfast show.

==Programming==
Local programming is produced and broadcast from Global&#x27;s Manchester studios from 6-10 am on weekdays. All networked programming originates from Global&#x27;s London headquarters, including &quot;The Smooth Drive Home&quot; with Angie Greaves.

===News===
Global&#x27;s Newsroom broadcasts hourly local news bulletins from 6 am to 7 pm on weekdays and from 6 am to 12 pm on weekends.

National news updates air hourly from Global&#x27;s London headquarters at all other times.

<text>Fred Levon Agabashian (August 21, 1913 – October 13, 1989) was an American racer of midget cars and Indy cars.

==Career==

===Midget car racing===

Agabashian competed in his first midget car race in his teens.

He qualified on the pole in 1952 in the Cummins Diesel Special, the first turbocharged Indy race car, but it dropped out after 71 laps.

Agabashian won one Championship race, a 100-mile contest at the Fairgrounds in Sacramento, CA in 1949.

He retired from the sport after failing to qualify at Indianapolis in 1958.

==Broadcaster==

<doc id="1016078" wikidata="Q7828585" url="?curid=1016078" title="Touch FM (Coventry)">
<text>96.2 Touch FM was an Independent Local Radio station serving Coventry and Warwickshire, in the West Midlands, England. The station broadcast from studios at Honiley, near Kenilworth, on 96.2 FM and online.

==History==
The station originally launched as Radio Harmony on 28 August 1990 on 102.6 MHz FM. In January 1995, it rebranded as Kix 96 and changed frequency to 96.2 MHz FM.
Under the management of Muff Murfin, Kix earned a reputation as a training ground for some of the UK radio industry&#x27;s up-and-coming talents including Chris Brooks, Dave Kelly and Perry Spillar. Nic Tuff was the station&#x27;s launch programme controller and breakfast presenter, who is probably best-remembered for a 1998 April Fools&#x27; joke in which he called Nelson Mandela at home, pretending to be Tony Blair. The stunt attracted some attention from the international press.

===CN Group acquisition===
The CN Group lobbied government regulatory body Ofcom in 2005 to amend the station&#x27;s format in order to bring it closer to the adult-contemporary formats of its sister stations in the South Midlands (all later rebranded as Touch FM). One of the proposed changes included a request for the removal of the obligation to provide a weekly programme of Irish music. An objection from Coventry rivals Mercia FM contributed towards Ofcom rejecting the request. As a result, the station&#x27;s format obligations dictated a different playlist to that of the other members of the Touch network, but nonetheless the station adopted at that point a more adult sound than that prior to CN ownership. The station was issued a &#x27;yellow card&#x27; by Ofcom in April 2006 for a violation of the &#x27;spirit of its format&#x27; following a decision to move the Irish music programme to an &#x27;inaccessible&#x27; overnight time slot.
===Quidem acquisition===
On 18 June 2009 it was announced that a group fronted by former G-Cap Media Operations Director Steve Orchard had bought the CN Radio Midland Stations. He set up the group known as &#x27;Quidem&#x27;. On 1 December 2009, Touch Radio was rebranded to Touch FM.

===Flip to Adult Hits Format===
On Friday, 21 March 2014 at 5:10 pm the station was &quot;seized&quot; during normal programming and a loop of the Queen hit Bohemian Rhapsody was played consistently until 10 am the following Monday morning. At this point, a launch sequence played, confirming the station was relaunching with a new, male-skewed rock format, giving it a distinctive sound compared to the more female-skewed Global Radio and Orion Media operated brands in the area. It then only had presenters between 6 am and 9 am and 4 pm and 7 pm weekdays, and 8 am to 2 pm weekends, and there was no longer any networking taken.

In 2016, Touch FM reverted to its original Adult Contemporary theme, applying the slogan of its sister stations &#x27;Classic Hits and the Best of Today&#x27;

In October 2016, the station started broadcasting a local arts magazine programme, &quot;The Coventry Culture Show&quot;. This was a hit with listeners, and in January 2017, the show was extended to four hours. In January 2019, &quot;The Coventry Culture Show&quot; also aired on Sunday morning in addition to its traditional Saturday slot. Presenter Neil Wilkes announced via social media that he had ended the radio show early, due to changes at the station, shortly after this it was publicly announced that Touch FM would cease broadcasting.

===Station rebrand and merger===
In September 2019, Quidem announced it had entered a brand licensing agreement with Global, citing financial losses. Two months later, following permission from regulator, Ofcom to change the station&#x27;s format, it was confirmed Touch FM (Coventry) would merge with its Quidem-owned sister stations and launch as Capital Mid-Counties on 2 December 2019.

Local output for the Mid-Counties region consists of a three-hour regional Drivetime show on weekdays, alongside localised news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising for Coventry and Warwickshire. Touch FM ceased broadcasting at 7pm on Friday 29 November 2019.

<text>MFR (Moray Firth Radio) is an Independent Local Radio station based in Inverness, owned and operated by Bauer Media Audio UK as part of the Hits Radio Network. It broadcasts to Moray, Scottish Highlands and North West Aberdeenshire.

As of September 2024, the station has a weekly audience of 91,000 listeners according to RAJAR.

==Station information==

MFR operates 97.4 FM (from the Mounteagle transmitter). The first voice heard on MFR, shortly after 6:30am on 23 February 1982, was Dave Cochrane. The longest serving presenter on MFR of 33 years was Tich McCooey, leaving on 29 May 2015.

MFR on FM largely broadcasts contemporary and chart music-led programming alongside hourly news bulletins and peak-time traffic updates. The majority of the station&#x27;s output is produced and broadcast from its Inverness studios. In recent years, MFR opted out on Saturday evenings for a weekly bilingual music programme in English and Scots Gaelic, which also aired on Argyll FM, Cuillin FM, Isles FM, Nevis Radio and Two Lochs Radio.

==History==

The station began broadcasting on 23 February 1982. A year later, the station was making a profit.

MFR 2 on AM and DAB aired specialist programming until August 2014 on Sunday - Friday evenings with automated music broadcast at all other times. In September 2014, the station axed its specialist output and began carrying programming from Bauer&#x27;s &#x27;Greatest Hits Network&#x27; of Scottish AM stations, switching to the Bauer City 2 network in January 2015. Since January 2019 it is part of the Greatest Hits Radio network and changed its name to the network name in April 2023.

MFR 3 launched on Monday 19 January 2015, broadcasting on DAB and online as a locally branded relay of The Hits aimed at 15-25-year-olds, with opt-outs for advertising. MFR 3 ceased broadcasting on 31 August 2017 and was replaced with a single national feed of The Hits, which was replaced ten months later with Hits Radio.

In addition to the main services, there is a local community station which opts into MFR during the daytime, broadcasting local programming produced by a non-profit community group during the evenings.

* Caithness FM (Caithness), used to use 102.5 FM from MFR but now broadcasts under its own licence on 106.5 FM.

There also used to be five other community stations taking MFR:

* KCR 107.7FM (Keith, Moray), formerly known as Keith Community Radio, used to use 102.8 FM from MFR during evenings but now broadcasts under its own licence 24/7 on 107.7 FM.
* SpeySound Radio (Aviemore), used to use 96.6 FM from MFR during evenings but now broadcasts under its own licence 24/7 on 107.1 FM.
* Kinnaird Radio (Fraserburgh), used to use 96.7 FM from MFR during evenings but has now ceased broadcasting.
* Oban FM (Oban) used to use 101.2 FM from MFR during their RSL period in October 1992 where MFR was broadcast on 101.2 FM in Oban in the early morning, afternoon and overnight hours, where both MFR and Oban FM carried London-based sustaining service Supergold concurrently through the night, From August 1994, Oban&#x27;s community radio station no longer relayed MFR as a sustaining service, instead they opt to broadcast Greatest Hits Radio Glasgow &amp; The West from Glasgow during their non-broadcasting hours from this point onwards until the station ceased broadcasting on 6th July 2024.
* Nevis Radio (Fort William) used to carry MFR as their sustaining service up until mid 2000&#x27;s providing news &amp; overnight service. MFR was broadcast over Nevis Radio&#x27;s 4 frequencies, 96.6, 97.0, 102.3 &amp; 102.4 FM
AM transmissions on 1107 kHz ceased on 11th December 2023, greatly reducing the broadcast coverage area, from the whole of the North of Scotland, including Orkney and Shetland, down to just the vicinity of Inverness.

==Programming==
Networked programming originates from Clyde 1 in Clydebank, Forth 1 in Edinburgh and Hits Radio in London and Manchester.

The station&#x27;s last regular local programme - the weekday breakfast show with Jodie McCluskey - ended on Friday 29 November 2024.

From 6 January 2025, MFR will simulcast &quot;Boogie in the Morning&quot; from Forth 1, along with Northsound 1 and Tay FM. Local news, travel updates and advertising are not affected.

===News ===
MFR broadcasts local news bulletins hourly from 6am to 7pm on weekdays and from 7am to 1pm on Saturdays and Sundays. Headlines are broadcast on the half hour during weekday breakfast and drivetime shows, alongside sport and traffic bulletins.

National bulletins from Sky News Radio are carried overnight with bespoke networked Scottish bulletins at weekends, produced from Radio Clyde&#x27;s newsroom in Clydebank.

<text>Ulleråker Hundred, or &quot;Ulleråkers härad&quot;, was a hundred of Uppland and Uppsala County in Sweden.

The area of the hundred stretches from the border of Hagunda hundred in the south-west to the Rivers Jumkilsån and Fyrisån in the northwest and Lake Ekoln in the south-east. The area of the hundred was described by Wilhelm Tham in 1850 as consisting of mostly unforested fields with occasional swampy areas around the streams which flow into the Fyris or Lake Ekoln.

The medieval &quot;Ullarakers hundare&quot; (the name later changed into &quot;Ulleråker&quot;) had its name after &quot;Ullaraker&quot;, the place of the &quot;thing&quot;, which was close to the Church of the Holy Trinity or the Castle in Uppsala. The hundred consisted of the parishes of Bondkyrka, Börje, Jumkil, Läby, Näs and Vänge.

The hundred was (1920) part of the middle court district of Uppsala County, Tiunda &quot;tingslag&quot; and Tiunda bailiwick. In the 19th and early 20th centuries it consisted of the parishes of Bondkyrka, Börje, Uppsala-Näs, Vänge, Läby, and one half of Jumkil, of which the other half belonged to Bälinge Hundred.

The antiquities in Ulleråker Hundred were described by the antiquarian Johan Peringskiöld in his large, illustrated work &quot;Monumenta ullerakeriensia&quot;, published in 1719.

Ulleråker is also the name of a deanery in the Archdiocese of Uppsala.

==The name==
The name is first recorded in Old Norse literature as &quot;Ullarakr&quot; (the late twelfth century in the case of &quot;Krákumál&quot;, and 1225 in the case of &quot;Heimskringla&quot;). In Sweden, where written sources appear much later than on Iceland, the first appearance is in 1298 as &quot;Vllarakir&quot;. The first element is the genitive case of the name of the Norse god Ullr. The last element is &quot;åker&quot; m &quot;field, acre&quot;.

<doc id="1016099" wikidata="Q7558338" url="?curid=1016099" title="Sollentuna Hundred">
<text>Sollentuna Hundred () was a hundred of Uppland in Sweden. It encompassed the present-day municipalities of Järfälla, Sollentuna, and Sundbyberg as well as parts of Upplands Väsby Municipality (Eds socken) and Stockholm (Bromma and Spånga socken). All are now part of Stockholm County. The hundred had three &quot;köpingar&quot;—Sollentuna Köping, Sundbybergs Köping, and Hässelby Villastads Köping—and a number of &quot;municipalsamhällen&quot;. Most of the hundred is now part of the urban area of Stockholm, but the larger part of in the remainder is in Upplands Väsby. The total area was around 197 km2 and the population in 1916 was 20,727 people.

==Geography==
Sollentuna Hundred was located directly west of Stockholm, in the borough of Bromma between Ulvsundasjön, Görväln, and Edsviken. Its easternmost parts lay in present-day central Stockholm (for example, the Essingen Islands). The geography is characteristic of the Mälaren Valley area: fertile clay soils in valleys divided by ridges of glacial till, and lakes such as Norrviken and Edsviken. The hundred was crossed by the Stockholmsåsen esker, which also serves as the watershed between Mälaren and Östersjön. The area is still noted for its natural beauty, particularly in the Järvafältet area, from whence the Bällstaån stream flows into Bällstaviken. Sollentuna Hundred was bordered to the south by the fjards of Näsfjärden and Lövstafjärden in Mälaren, with Färentuna Hundred located across the lake. Bro Hundred lay to the west, Ärlinghundra Hundred to the north, Vallentuna Hundred and Danderyd Ship District in the east, as well as Stockholm City and Svartlösa Hundred to the southeast.

==History==
Sollentuna Hundred was one of the &quot;eight hundreds&quot; that composed the mediaeval Uppland &quot;folkland&quot; of Attundaland. The name, similar to that of neighbouring Vallentuna Hundred, was written as &quot;Sollendahundæri&quot; in the 14th century; the &quot;-enda-&quot; in the name signifies a place at the end of a lake. Sollentuna Church is indeed located by Norrviken lake, but it is also entirely possible that &quot;Sollenda&quot; paraphrases a much older word, perhaps meaning &quot;swamp&quot; or &quot;marshland&quot;, altered to imitate the name of the neighbouring hundred. The local &quot;ting&quot; originally met in Granby in Spånga socken, but moved to Barkarby in the 17th century, and finally to Rotebro in the 20th century. The hundred was long an important area for local and regional commerce. Roads leading to Bergslagen, Uppsala, and Roslagen crossed the isthmus between Norrviken and Edsviken. The lakes were crossed by important shipping routes, and there was also a harbour since the Viking Age.

In the 12th century, churches were founded in Sollentuna, Järfälla, Spånga, and Bromma. The hundred grew around these churches, growing from a few lone farms to a number of small villages. The majority of the population worked in agriculture until well towards the end of the 19th century. At that time, the Mälaren Line and Northern Main Line railways were built, and a number of station towns cropped up within the hundred, many of which today are part of the suburbs of Stockholm: for example, Sundbyberg, Bromsten, Jakobsberg, Tureberg, Rotebro, and Upplands Väsby. Sollentuna Hundred&#x27;s proximity to the capital had a profound effect on its development and expansion in the first half of the 20th century. In 1916, Bromma socken and its towns were incorporated into the city, and Spånga socken followed suit in 1949.

==Sockens==
Sollentuna Hundred was originally composed of five sockens:

*Bromma socken (became part of the City of Stockholm in 1916)
*Eds socken
*Järfälla socken
*Sollentuna socken
*Spånga socken (became part of the City of Stockholm in 1949)

==Administrative and judicial divisions==
The hundred was part of Stockholm County since 1715 and also between the periods that it was part of Uppsala County (1634-1639, 1648–1651, 1654–1714).

The sockens in the hundred were part of the following bailiwicks:
*1720-1852: Bailiwick of Sollentuna, Vallentuna, and Danderyd
*1853-1881: Bailiwick of Sollentuna, Vallentuna, Färentuna, and Danderyd
*1882-1885: Bailiwick of Färentuna and Sollentuna
*1886-1966: Bailiwick of Svartsjö bailiwick (incl. Spånga socken until 1945 and Järfälla socken until 1948)
*1946-1948: Bailiwick of Spånga (Spånga socken)
*1949-1966: Bailiwick of Sundbyberg (Järfälla socken)
*1967–present: Bailiwick of Sollentuna
*1967–present: Bailiwick of Jakobsberg (Järfälla socken)

The sockens were also part of the following &quot;domsagor&quot; (judicial districts), &quot;tingslag&quot;, and &quot;tingsrätter&quot; (district courts):
*1844-1915: Södra Roslag &quot;domsaga&quot;, with
**1844-1906: Sollentuna Hundred &quot;tingslag&quot;
**1907-1915: &quot;Tingslag&quot; of Södra Roslag &quot;domsaga&quot;
*1916-1976: Sollentuna and Färentuna &quot;domsaga&quot; (until 1952 for Eds socken)
**1916-1951/1970: &quot;Tingslag&quot; of Sollentuna and Färentuna &quot;domsaga&quot;
*1952-1976: Western Stockholm County &quot;domsaga&quot; (for Eds socken) with
**1952-1970: &quot;Tingslag&quot; of Western Stockholm County &quot;domsaga&quot;
*1977–present: Sollentuna &quot;domsaga&quot; with &quot;Sollentuna tingsrätt&quot; (Sollentuna and Eds sockens)
*1977–present: Jakobsberg &quot;domsaga&quot; with &quot;Jakobsbergs tingsrätt&quot; (Järfälla socken)

<text>North Norfolk Radio was an Independent Local Radio station in North Norfolk, England, owned and operated by Bauer Radio as part of the Greatest Hits Radio network. It was closed on 1 September 2020 and merged with Greatest Hits Radio Norfolk &amp; North Suffolk.

==History==

North Norfolk Radio was established following campaigns by several groups for a dedicated radio service for the area. Some of these groups ran restricted service licence (RSL) trial stations, including 106.9 FTR-FM (Fakenham – August 1997), Fakenham Community Radio (April/May 1999), Wensum FM (East Dereham – 3 trials between October 1999 &amp; June 2001), Central Norfolk Radio (Fakenham – 5 trials between April 1999 and May 2001), Escape FM (Sheringham – July/August 2000) and Tindles own 87.7 The Beach (North Walsham – Christmas 2000 &amp; Holt, Norfolk – June 2001).

On 14 November 2002, the Radio Authority formally advertised a new local commercial radio licence for the coastal area of North Norfolk, covering Wells-next-the-Sea and Cromer, and inland to include Fakenham. Potential applicants had around 16 weeks to submit their proposals to the Radio Authority. Two applicants submitted bids by the closing date of 4 March 2003: North Norfolk Radio (Tindle Radio) and Go-FM (Absolute Radio).

On 8 May 2003, the Radio Authority announced that Tindle, trading as North Norfolk Radio, had won the eight-year licence for a local commercial radio service. Tindle were the majority shareholders in the company (79%), with local directors taking the rest, including Angela Bond, a former producer for Kenny Everett. The chairman of the new station was Ian McNicol, owner of the Stody Estate. 
The original team at NNR were Sharron Tuck (Station Manager), John Bultitude (Head of News) and presenters included former 1960s offshore radio broadcasters Andy Archer and Mike Ahern.

North Norfolk Radio originally broadcast from Breck Farm, Stody, Norfolk, from a converted milking parlour. The first test transmission were broadcast on 21 October 2003, when the main transmitter at Stody was switched on, transmitting on a frequency of 96.2 MHz VHF/FM, at a power of 2580 watts. After a few more weeks, relay transmitters at Aylmerton and Bunkers Hill were switched on and relayed the test transmissions from Stody. Both of these relay transmitters were tuned to 103.2 MHz VHF/FM at a power of 250 watts.

The station officially began broadcasting at 6am on Monday, 10 November 2003, with Mike Ahern as the first presenter on the station, although the first voice heard was that McNicol. The song that launched the station was &quot;I Get The Sweetest Feeling&quot; by Jackie Wilson.

Due to problems with reception in Fakenham, a 10-watt relay transmitter was built on the Holt Road water tower in the town. This began operating on 11 October 2005, transmitting on 96.2 MHz VHF/FM.

Unlike many other stations, North Norfolk Radio did not use radio links or rented landlines to get their studio output to their main transmitter, but used a 1000-metre armoured multicore cable buried underground, from the studio to transmitter building. Because the relay transmitters used common frequencies (i.e. 103.2 at 2 sites and 96.2 at the Fakenham relay), they were GPS-synchronised so as not to cause interference to each other.

The station was owned by the Anglian Radio group, who owned several stations in East Anglia, including neighbouring stations 103.4 The Beach, covering the east coast of Norfolk and Suffolk, and 99.9 Radio Norwich. As of Monday 9 January 2017, the station merged with these two sister stations, with all programming now originating from Radio Norwich&#x27;s studios in Norwich. On 31 January 2017, it was confirmed that Celador had completed the purchase of Anglian Radio Group.

===Station rebrand===
On 8 February 2019, North Norfolk Radio and Celador&#x27;s local radio stations were sold to Bauer Radio. The sale was ratified in March 2020 following an inquiry by the Competition and Markets Authority.

On 27 May 2020, it was announced that North Norfolk Radio would join Bauer&#x27;s Greatest Hits Radio network. On 13 July 2020, local programming outside weekday breakfast was replaced by networked output from the GHR network, with North Norfolk Radio retaining its own branding.

In September 2020, the station was rebranded as Greatest Hits Radio and merged with its sister stations in the East. The station&#x27;s local breakfast show was replaced by a regional drivetime show. Localised news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising are retained.

==Programming== 
From 9 January 2017, all programming was shared between North Norfolk Radio, Radio Norwich 99.9 and The Beach (radio station), although the three stations kept separate branding (particularly for local Travel, Events, News, Adverts and Commercials) with programmes broadcast from studios in Norwich and Ipswich.

<text>:&quot;This is the page for the defunct CN Group station. For the service operated by Quidem see &quot;The New 107 Oak FM&quot;.&quot;

Oak 107 FM was an Independent Local Radio station owned by the CN Group and based on Prince William Road in Loughborough, Leicestershire in the UK.

==History==
Oak 107 was launched with Nic Tuff in 1999 as &quot;107 Oak FM&quot;. The name was changed to &quot;OAK 107&quot; in November 2002 and again to &quot;Oak 107 FM&quot; in 2004. The station played a variety of songs from the 2000s, 1990s, 1980s and, sometimes, the 1970s.

In 2003, the station supported the &quot;Give The Luffs a Lease&quot; campaign in favour of Loughborough Football Club&#x27;s attempt to secure a long-term lease for the site of its stadium. The Radio Authority (now Ofcom) ruled that this &quot;was acceptable because the station was satisfied that the vast majority of its listeners would support it and the issue was not made into a political controversy&quot;.

The station was purchased by the Lincs FM Group in October 2007 and merged with Lincs FM&#x27;s existing station, Fosseway Radio which was based in Hinckley. Both services were rebranded as Oak FM on 26 March 2008 with both the Hinckley and Loughborough services being co-located in Coalville in July 2008.

For the new merged service, see Oak FM.

<text>Elizabeth H. Shin (September 26, 1980 – April 14, 2000) was a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) student who died from burns inflicted by a fire in her dormitory room. Her death led to a lawsuit against MIT and controversy as to whether MIT paid adequate attention to its students&#x27; mental and emotional health, and whether its suicide rate was abnormally high. Although her death was first thought to be a suicide, both MIT and her parents stipulated that it may have been an accident in the subsequent amicable settlement between MIT and the Shins.

== Background ==
Shin was raised in Livingston, New Jersey as the eldest daughter to Korean parents Kisuk (née Pak) and Cho Hyun Shin. She was the salutatorian of her graduating class at West Orange High School. Shin began attending MIT as a biology major in September 1998 and resided at the on-campus Random Hall dormitory.

MIT had experienced nine suicides since 1990, provoking controversy as to whether MIT&#x27;s suicide rate was abnormally high.

Shin had regularly used the services of MIT&#x27;s Counseling and Support Services (CSS) since March 1999, after breaking up with a boyfriend. CSS later said that Shin admitted to habitual cutting since high school and noted that her symptoms were consistent with &quot;passive suicidal ideation&quot;. On March 29, 2000, a new psychiatrist diagnosed her with borderline personality disorder and major depressive disorder; Shin would enter another &quot;severe&quot; depressive episode the next day, for which the psychiatrist increased her Celexa prescription. Shin asked to be excused for an exam on April 3 and on the evening of April 8, a student reported MIT police after Shin had talked about killing herself with a knife, though she was returned to her dorm within the hour as staff found that Shin was &quot;not acutely suicidal&quot;.

== Incident ==
On April 10, 2000, at approximately 12:30 am, Random Hall dorm mistress Nina Davis-Millis was informed by two students that Shin had informed them of a planned suicide and asked them to delete files from her computer. Davis-Millis alerted MIT Mental Health services, who told her to check on Shin, but that there was no need for immediate intervention and that trained staff would come a few hours later at 6:30 am. Davis-Millis ultimately decided against entering Shin&#x27;s room to avoid waking her up in case she was asleep and instead wrote her an e-mail. Shin&#x27;s reply led to a &quot;disturbing conversation&quot;, during which Shin wrote something to the effect of &quot;You won&#x27;t have to worry about me any more&quot;. A deans and psychs meeting was organized at 11:00 am to discuss more extensive medical treatment for Shin due to her comments and a message was left on Shin&#x27;s answering machine inviting her to a counseling session, but no direct actions were otherwise undertaken.

Shortly before 9:00 pm, a student named Andrew Thomas heard a smoke alarm in Elizabeth&#x27;s dorm room. Although the door was locked, Thomas could smell smoke and could hear crying coming from within the room. When MIT police broke down the door, they saw Shin &quot;engulfed in flames, flailing on the floor in the middle of her room.&quot; Sixty-five percent of her body was covered in third-degree burns, and she died four days later.

== Lawsuit ==
On January 28, 2002, Shin&#x27;s family filed a $27.65 million wrongful-death lawsuit against the school and several administrators and employees. They accused the school of &quot;breaching its &#x27;promise&#x27; to provide an appropriate medical diagnosis and treatment of Shin, as well as reasonable security, emergency services, and level of care&quot;. The lawsuit alleged that despite numerous warning signs, such as sending emails to faculty members saying that she was depressed, engaging in self-harm and wanted to kill herself, she received minimal attention. Furthermore, Shin had been diagnosed with adjustment disorder by a mental health counsellor in February 1999, after Shin underwent psychological screening at McLean Hospital following brief hospitalization at Massachusetts General Hospital for overdosing on Tylenol. Between 1999 and 2000, MIT counseling services sometimes relegated duty to her parents, discharged her with minimal treatment, or failed to take action in response to her emails. Shin&#x27;s parents say that their daughter&#x27;s death was the 10th of 12 suicides committed by MIT students since 1990 and was foreseeable by the school&#x27;s administrators and its Mental Health Services employees.

As part of its defense, MIT implied that Shin&#x27;s mental health problems started before she entered MIT, including a possible suicide attempt when Shin missed becoming valedictorian of her graduating class.

After the incident, MIT announced an upgrade of its student counseling programs, including more staff members and longer hours. MIT and campus police officers were cleared of wrongdoing in June 2005, but the case against MIT administrators and mental health employees continued. The Shins&#x27; lawyer David Deluca commented that the counts against MIT might have been limited by the &quot;immunity that the institution enjoys&quot; as an educational institution.

MIT continued to deny wrongdoing.

On April 3, 2006, MIT announced that the lawsuit had been settled for an undisclosed amount. The Shins released a statement, saying, &quot;We appreciate MIT&#x27;s willingness to spare our family the ordeal of a trial and have come to understand that our daughter&#x27;s death was likely a tragic accident. This agreement will allow us to move forward in the healing process.&quot;

The Shins&#x27; lawyer stated that the results of a toxicology test indicated that Elizabeth had overdosed on a nonprescription medication before the fire that could have prevented her from responding appropriately to the blaze. This evidence may have played a part in the Shins&#x27; later admission that Elizabeth&#x27;s death was an accident.

According to an unreferenced 2011 article in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, MIT&#x27;s suicide rate was not higher than other colleges, refuting an earlier &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; article cited in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The picture is muddied by conflicting studies, unequal comparisons, the sparse nature of the event of suicide compared to other activities, conflicts of interest of reporting parties, and changes in the attitude and actions of academic administrations over the decades.

<text>Maria Rita (; born 9 September 1977, São Paulo) is a Brazilian singer. Born Maria Rita Camargo Mariano, she is the daughter of famed pianist/arranger César Camargo Mariano and the late Brazilian singing legend Elis Regina and sister to Pedro Mariano and music producer João Marcelo Bôscoli. Her namesake is family friend and famed Brazilian rock legend Rita Lee. She studied at New York University, and worked as a journalist at a magazine for adolescents.

==Career==

Maria Rita began singing professionally at the age of 24, although she had wanted to sing since she was 14. Her first CD, &quot;Maria Rita&quot;, launched her career symbolically, with the first cut on her first album, &quot;A Festa&quot; (The Party), being written by Milton Nascimento, the legendary Brazilian singer-songwriter whose career was launched by Maria Rita&#x27;s mother, Elis Regina, when she began to sing his songs to the national Brazilian audience. The CD went platinum and was a hit worldwide, making her an international star. She developed her own jazzy vocal style, with singers like Ella Fitzgerald as her model. For her 2013 album &quot;Redescobrir&quot; she was finally persuaded to perform and record songs her mother had sung.

She won the 2004 Latin Grammy Awards for &quot;Best New Artist&quot; in the &quot;General Field&quot;, Best Song in Portuguese (&quot;A festa&quot;) and her debut album &quot;Maria Rita&quot; won the &quot;Best MPB (Musica Popular Brasileira) Album&quot; award for that year. The world hit that &quot;Segundo&quot; turned out to be, granted her in 2006, two additional Grammys Latinos – Best MPB Album and Best Brazilian Song with &quot;Caminho das Águas&quot; authored by Rodrigo Maranhão – and over 50 shows abroad, with full public and reviews acceptance in the Montreux Jazz Festival, North Sea Jazz Festival, Irving Plaza (NY), San Francisco Jazz Festival, among others.

Maria Rita was nominated for the BBC Radio 3 Awards for World Music in 2008. On 28 June 2008, she performed in London for the first time, with a production by Tuba Productions and JungleDrums Magazine.

<doc id="1016243" wikidata="Q269841" url="?curid=1016243" title="Cássia Eller">
<text>Cássia Rejane Eller (Portuguese: ) (December 10, 1962 – December 29, 2001) was a Brazilian singer, composer, and multi-instrumentalist, regarded as one of the greatest representatives of Brazilian rock in the 1990s.

She came to prominence in the early 1990s and performed a mix of rock and MPB. Eller released five studio albums in her lifetime: &quot;Cássia Eller&quot; (1990), &quot;O Marginal&quot; (1992), &quot;Cássia Eller&quot; (1994), &quot;Veneno AntiMonotonia&quot; (1997) and &quot;Com Você... Meu Mundo Ficaria Completo&quot; (1999). Her sixth studio album, &quot;Dez de Dezembro&quot; (2002), was released posthumously. Eller&#x27;s most successful album was &quot;Acústico MTV – Cássia Eller&quot; (2001), selling over 1 million copies. She was ranked as the 18th-greatest vocalist and 40th-greatest Brazilian musician by &quot;Rolling Stone Brasil&quot;. On December 29, 2001, Eller died at the age of 39 of a heart attack caused by a malformation of her heart.

==Biography==
Cássia Rejane Eller was born in Rio de Janeiro to Altair Eller, an Army paratrooper sergeant, and Nanci Ribeiro, a housewife. Her name was suggested by her grandmother, who was devoted to St. Rita of Cascia.

She moved with her family to Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais at 6 years old. When she was 10 years old, she went to Santarém, Pará, and at age 12 returned to Rio. Her interest in music began when she received a guitar as a gift at age 14. She learned how to speak English and play guitar by playing Beatles songs. At the age of 18, she arrived in Brasília, where her family moved. There she sang in choir, auditioned for musicals, worked in two operas as a showgirl, and sang frevo, blues, and rock, and performed as a singer for a forró group. She was also part of the first electric trio of Brasília, called &quot;Massa Real&quot;, and played the Surdo drum in a samba group. She played and sang in several bars (including &quot;Bom Demais&quot;). In 1981, she appeared in a play by Oswaldo Montenegro.

A year later, at age 19, wanting her personal freedom, she moved to Belo Horizonte looking for a job and a place to live. As soon as she arrived, she went to work as a bricklayer. &quot;I made mortar and set up bricks,&quot; she said. There she lived in a small rented room. She did not finish high school because the shows she was doing every day on a different shift did not allow her a time to study. When she returned to Brasília, she replaced a friend as a secretary at the Ministério da Agricultura, but she was fired on the third day and decided to commit herself to singing.

== Career ==
Characterized by her deep voice and her musical eclecticism, she played songs of great composers of Brazilian rock, MPB, pop, rap, sambas and international rock such as Cazuza, Renato Russo, Rita Lee, Caetano Veloso, Chico Buarque, Nando Reis, Riachão, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, The Beatles, John Lennon, and Nirvana.

Her greatest musical influences were Lennon, Paul McCartney, and Nina Simone.

She had a significant musical career, even though short, with ten recorded albums over the course of the twelve years. In fact, it was only in 1989 that her career took off. Helped by her uncle, she recorded a demo tape with the song &quot;Por Enquanto&quot; by Renato Russo. This uncle brought the tape to PolyGram, which resulted in Eller being hired by the label. Her first participation on a record was in 1990, in Wagner Tiso&#x27;s album titled &quot;Baobab&quot;.

Her first album, &quot;Cássia Eller,&quot; was released by PolyGram in 1990. In 1992, she released her second album, &quot;O Marginal&quot;. In 1994 her third album was released, titled &quot;Cássia Eller&quot;, which contained the hit &quot;Malandragem,&quot; an unpublished song by Cazuza. Her fourth album, &quot;Veneno AntiMonotonia,&quot; was released in 1997 with a tribute to Cazuza and re-recordings of his songs.

In 1992, Cássia shared vocals with Edson Cordeiro on the song &quot;A Rainha da Noite / I Can&#x27;t Get No (Satisfaction)&quot;, a mash-up of Mozart&#x27;s Queen of the Night Aria with the Rolling Stones&#x27; song. The song was included on Edson Cordeiro&#x27;s self-titled album.

Influenced by her 4-year-old son, Chicão, who remarked that his mom shouted too much and that he preferred listening to singer Marisa Monte, Cássia began singing in a calmer manner. It was then that Cássia released her album &quot;Com Você...Meu Mundo Ficaria Completo&quot; in 1999, produced by Nando Reis. The hits &quot;O Segundo Sol&quot; and &quot;Palavras ao Vento&quot; came from this album. Cássia and her mother, Nanci Ribeiro, sang together on the track &quot;Pedra Gigante.&quot; Cássia remarked about her mother, &quot;She was a singer before marrying my dad. It was her who taught me everything. She sang Dolores Duran, Maysa. I was excited, and she was super nervous. She didn&#x27;t know where to put the headphones, but she gave a top-notch recording.&quot;

On January 13, 2001, Cássia performed on the World Stage at the Rock in Rio festival for an audience of nearly 200,000 people. She fulfilled the request of her son, Chicão, and included the song &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; by Nirvana on her set list at the festival. Dave Grohl, ex-drummer of Nirvana and vocalist of Foo Fighters, lauded Cássia&#x27;s version.

In December 2002 the album &quot;Dez de Dezembro&quot; was released, the first posthumous album by Cássia Eller, which included unpublished tracks such as &quot;No Recreio&quot; and &quot;All Star,&quot; the latter being about Cássia&#x27;s friendship with Nando Reis.

Eller always had an intense stage presence and preferred albums recorded live. She was frequently invited for special participations and personalized interpretations.

She declared herself to be an interpreter of other people&#x27;s work, having composed only three of the songs she recorded: &quot;Lullaby&quot; (with Márcio Faraco) on her first album, &quot;Cássia Eller&quot;, and &quot;Eles&quot; and &quot;O Marginal&quot; (with Hermelino Neder, Luiz Pinheiro and Zé Marcos) on the second album, &quot;O Marginal&quot; (1992).

== Final months ==
2001 was an especially productive year for Eller. On January 13, 2001, she performed at Rock in Rio III, in a show where baião, samba and MPB classics were sung in a rock rhythm. On this day, the sequence of acts was as follows: R.E.M., Foo Fighters, Beck, Barão Vermelho, Fernanda Abreu, and Eller. Over 190,000 people attended the concert.

Between May and December, Eller did 95 shows. This included recording a DVD (live, as she preferred) and &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;, between March 7 and 8 in São Paulo. The project included artists of high artistic and technical ability: Nando Reis (musical direction / authorship, voice and guitar in &quot;Relicário&quot; / voice in &quot;De Esquina&quot; de Xis), the musicians of the band: Luiz Brasil (Musical Direction / Cifras / Guitars and Mandolin), Walter Villaça (Guitars and Mandolin), Fernando Nunes (bass), Paulo Calasans (Acoustic Piano and Organ Hammond), João Vianna (Drums, Surdo, Ganzá, Grater and Blade), Lan Lan (Percussion and Vocal) and Tamima Brasil (Percussion), guest musicians Bernardo Bessler (violin), Iura (Cello), Alberto Continentino (bass sound), Cristiano Alves (clarinet and bass clarinet), Dirceu Leite (sax, flute and clarinet), among many others. The album was composed of 17 tracks, plus the Making Of, photo gallery, discography and i.clip. The album has sold more than a million copies to date and became the biggest hit in Eller&#x27;s career. Up to then she was not considered an extremely popular singer despite good sales and experience.

In the same year of 2001, she would perform at MTV&#x27;s Video Music Brasil in her &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; alongside Rita Lee, Roberto de Carvalho and Nando Reis (performing Os Mutantes&#x27; &quot;Top Top&quot;).

== Death ==

Cássia Eller died on December 29, 2001, in the Santa Maria clinic in the Laranjeiras neighborhood, in the south of Rio de Janeiro, after suffering three cardiac arrests due to sudden myocardial infarction. She was 39 years old and at the peak of her career. She had been hospitalized at 1 pm and was placed in the ICU (Intensive Care Center). According to her manager, the singer was feeling bad and complaining of nausea due to overwork. The symptoms, he said, were thought to be the result of stress caused by overwork. &quot;She had been working a lot. In seven months, she&#x27;s done over a hundred shows,&quot; she said. The hypothesis of drug overdose was raised. This was initially considered as the cause of death, but was dismissed by the coroner&#x27;s report of the Medical Institute of Rio de Janeiro after a necropsy. The coroner&#x27;s report stated that Eller died of a heart attack caused by a malformation of her heart. The toxicology report found no alcohol or drug residues in her body. Histopathological exams revealed Eller had heart problems, such as mild coronary sclerosis (early onset of fat thrombi) and myocardial fibrosis (scars from other pre-existing lesions).

Eller&#x27;s death came just two days before her scheduled performance at Praça do Ó in Barra da Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro, for the New Year&#x27;s Eve celebrations. Luciana Mello was her replacement. At several spots in Rio de Janeiro, there was a minute of silence during the homage of the passage of the year in memory of Eller. Several artists also paid homage to the singer at their shows at the turn of the year.

She is buried at the Jardim da Saudade Cemetery, in the Sulacap neighborhood of the city of Rio de Janeiro.

==Personal life==
Cássia Eller was openly bisexual. In 1993, Eller gave birth to her first and only child, a son named Francisco (affectionately called Chicão), the love child of a casual relationship with a friend, bassist Tavinho Fialho. Tavinho was married and died in a car accident a week before Chicão was born. Chicão was raised by Eller and her partner Maria Eugênia Vieira Martins. The two had been in a relationship since 1987 and stayed together until Eller&#x27;s death in 2001. Eller&#x27;s request was that if something happened to her, Maria Eugênia would be responsible for the care of Francisco, and after her death her partner did raise the boy after a legal battle over his custody against Eller&#x27;s father.

Eller was a passionate fan of Clube Atlético Mineiro, and was even contacted to receive the Silver Rooster, an honor given to the illustrious fans of the club. However, with her untimely death, the trophy ended up being delivered in 2002 to her mother, Nanci Eller, according to whom: &quot;Last year Cássia performed in Curitiba, and Levir Culpi sent a Rooster shirt for her and her son. All of her instruments have the Athletic shield. She always put the shield on the things she won. There is even a shield on the door of the studio that Eller had in her residence&quot;.

<doc id="1016247" wikidata="Q2549549" url="?curid=1016247" title="Nightwolf">
<text>Nightwolf is a fictional character in the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; fighting game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. He debuted in &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; (1995) as a Native American shaman selected to defend a fictional realm Earthrealm against invading forces from another realm Outworld. In addition to his fighting prowess, Nightwolf possesses magical abilities that allow him to enhance his strength and create weapons.

The character has appeared in various media outside of the games, including as one of the central heroes in the animated series &quot;Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm&quot; (1996), and as a supporting character in the film &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot;. While his portrayal in the franchise has been criticized as a stereotype of Native Americans, his depiction in the rebooted games has received a mixed reception.

==Design and gameplay==
During early development of &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot;, the character was known simply as &quot;Indian&quot; before his name was determined. Ed Boon described him to &quot;Video Games &amp; Computer Entertainment&quot; magazine in April 1995 (issue #75) as &quot;a very nontraditional Indian. He doesn&#x27;t swing an axe that he&#x27;s always holding, like Chief Thunder from &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;. He doesn&#x27;t have all of the stereotypical Indian-type things like T. Hawk or Chief Thunder; he doesn&#x27;t go &#x27;Hoya! Hoya!&#x27; and all that.&quot; Nightwolf uses a mystical set of weapons (a tomahawk and a bow and arrow) in battle. Nightwolf was portrayed by Midway Games artist Sal DiVita in the game. DiVita said about his casting: &quot;I was just walking around and John [Tobias] said, &#x27;Hey, man, you&#x27;ve got some arms; hey, got a big chest. You want to be a character?&#x27; I&#x27;m like, &#x27;Sure!&#x27; And that&#x27;s how it happened.&quot;

According to guides by both &quot;Mean Machines Sega&quot; and &quot;SuperGamePower&quot;, the best part about him in the original &quot;MK3&quot; was his then-unique ability to deflect any projectile back towards an opponent. &quot;Total 64&quot; opined that, once mastered, Nightwolf &quot;is one of the brightest stars&quot; of &quot;Mortal Kombat Trilogy&quot;, as &quot;none of his moves are seemingly useful at the start, but stick[ing] with him [might] get some great results.&quot; Prima Games&#x27; official guide for &quot;Armageddon&quot; gave Nightwolf a poor overall rating of 4/10, stating that the character, &quot;while being a solid punisher character, has a difficult time inflicting heavy damage on opponents.&quot; In Prima Games&#x27; official guide for the 2011 &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; reboot, Nightwolf was judged to be a much-improved character due to his &quot;shoulder and power charge moves [used] to knock down&quot; opponents and his uppercut being &quot;an excellent move to counter jumpers.&quot;

==Appearances==
===&quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; games===
Nightwolf is introduced in &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; as a historian and shaman whose patch of tribal land provides a vital protective area for Raiden&#x27;s chosen Earthrealm defenders during Shao Kahn&#x27;s invasion. As his homeland was protected by shamanic magic, Nightwolf would soon be joined by the other chosen warriors. He returned during the events of &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot;. In the events leading to the game, he suffered recurring nightmares of the Dragon King Onaga&#x27;s resurrection. Despite knowing a new threat was coming, he was unable to stop his nightmares from coming true when Reptile transformed into Onaga. His forefathers handed down the means with which he could defeat Onaga, by becoming a &quot;Sin Eater&#x27;, absorbing the sins of his tribe. He traveled to the Netherrealm, drew Onaga&#x27;s soul to him, and released his ancestors&#x27; absorbed sins to remove Onaga from Reptile and bind the former to the Netherrealm.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot;, having completed his quest, Nightwolf was guided back to Earthrealm by his spirit guides. Along the way, he received visions of a battle where an unknown power was forcing the participating warriors to fight each other. His visions slowly became reality when he agreed to help Johnny Cage and his allies combat the fallen Elder God Shinnok and his forces. While preparing for the battle, Nightwolf was met by Kitana and the spirit of Liu Kang, who was bound to Earth through his bond with her. Despite being weakened by his fight with Onaga, Nightwolf used his remaining magic to relieve Kitana of her burden and took custody of Liu Kang&#x27;s spirit.

In the 2011 reboot, Nightwolf is seen as a participant in the first Mortal Kombat tournament. When Shang Tsung selects him as Scorpion&#x27;s next opponent, Nightwolf berates Scorpion for his quest for vengeance though the latter accuses the former of dishonoring his people by not seeking vengeance for the injustices they have suffered. Nightwolf proceeds to fight Scorpion, but is defeated and eliminated from the tournament. He is later seen among the Earthrealm warriors who congratulate Liu Kang for winning the tournament, though he is not present during the victory ceremony nor the second tournament. He reappears during Outworld&#x27;s invasion to recruit Stryker. During the battle, Nightwolf destroys Shao Kahn&#x27;s Soulnado and survived Sindel&#x27;s initial onslaught. Ultimately, however, Nightwolf sacrifices himself to destroy Sindel during her second assault, allowing the sorcerer Quan Chi to claim his soul and turn him into one of his underlings.

Nightwolf returns in &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;, with his human self from the 2011 reboot as his default appearance while his revenant form appears as an alternate gear appearance. In his arcade ending, a young Nightwolf -- then known as Grey Cloud -- initially resented his people for selling out to the colonizers and fell in with Kano&#x27;s Black Dragon crime cartel as a result. However, when Kano asked him to help steal the Matoka&#x27;s sacred treasures, he refused. Kano mortally wounded him in retaliation, but the Great Spirit saved him and granted Grey Cloud the mantle of Nightwolf. In the DLC story expansion, &quot;Aftermath&quot;, a past version of Nightwolf joined forces with Shang Tsung and Fujin to retrieve Kronika&#x27;s Crown of Souls and help Liu Kang restore history. While battling his revenant counterpart during a mission to capture Sindel&#x27;s revenant and revive her, Shang Tsung drained revenant Nightwolf&#x27;s soul in retaliation for wounding him. Despite securing the Crown and taking part in assaulting Kronika&#x27;s keep, Nightwolf and his allies were betrayed by Shang Tsung and Sindel.

===Other media and merchandise===
Nightwolf is a major character in the 1996 cartoon series &quot;Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm&quot;, voiced by Tod Thawley. He serves to offer spiritual and technical help to the Earthrealm warriors and is depicted as having expertise in computer technology. He has a pet wolf named Kiva who could merge with Nightwolf to increase his power. He briefly appeared in the 1997 film &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot;, and was played by Native American rapper and actor Litefoot. He also briefly appears in a flashback as a revenant in the 2022 animated film &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Snow Blind&quot;. An action figure of Nightwolf was released by Jazwares in July 2012. It came in two versions, 4-inch and 6-inch. In July 2022, a figure based on his &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; appearance was released by MacFarlane Toys.

==Reception==
===Ethnic representation===
Nightwolf is often unfavorably discussed in the context of the portrayal of Native Americans in video games. Boon&#x27;s description of the character in the April 1995 issue of &quot;VideoGames &amp; Computer Entertainment&quot; provoked a comment from the magazine three issues later: &quot;For a character who has been described as a &#x27;nontraditional Indian,&#x27; he certainly has all the trappings of one. Let&#x27;s see, he wears feathers and war paint, swings a hatchet, shoots arrows...could there be a &#x27;Scalp&#x27; Fatality?&quot; In a 2008 feature on Native American stereotyping in video games, &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; designated Nightwolf as the &quot;warrior&quot; trope: &quot;[W]hile this pro-Indian sentiment is certainly heartwarming, much of Nightwolf’s character is wide of the mark.&quot; The site added that the act of &quot;sin-eating&quot; (his role in &quot;MK Deception&quot;) was actually European in origin. The same year, Rob Bricken of Topless Robot said that &quot;Nightwolf’s design and backstory [in &quot;MK3&quot;] are standard-issue for Native American characters in fighting games&quot;, while censuring the game itself as &quot;where the designers were free to throw [in] any horrible, out-of-place idea&quot;. Robert Naytor of Hardcore Gaming 101 said, &quot;In the mid-&#x27;90s, it was practically an unwritten law that every fighting game had to have either a Bruce Lee clone, [or] a Native American ... Nightwolf takes up the latter slot,&quot; a belief that was shared by Gavin Jasper of &quot;Den of Geek&quot;. &quot;Complex&quot; deemed Nightwolf the top stereotypical character in video games in 2012, describing him as &quot;the epitome of every red-skinned, feather-wearing sports mascot and old cowboy movie serial ... [he] has warpaint on his face, a feather in his hair and the sleeveless vest as if Geronimo himself just gave it up.&quot;

In the 2018 study &quot;Representation of Native Americans: From Literature to Video Games&quot;, Samuel Martínez Linares stated, &quot;Although Nightwolf is in fact provided with a real tribal background, his Apache heritage seems to be mixed up with other cultural religious practices that are not related whatsoever to Native American ones.&quot; Linares noted his &quot;rhino charge&quot; special move in the series as &quot;outdated&quot;, as the rhinoceros had been extinct in North America &quot;since the Pliocene epoch&quot;. He additionally compared Nightwolf to T. Hawk from the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series in that their &quot;long hair [and] bow and arrows make it hard to distinguish&quot; both characters, &quot;which reinforces the idea of the pan-Indian construct.&quot; &quot;Enacting Videogame Development through Indigenous-Led Creation&quot; author Maize Longboat wrote, &quot;His portrayal as a violent tribal warrior with magic powers reproduces harmful stereotypes perpetuated in popular media.&quot; In &quot;How Indigenous Designers are Changing the Landscape of Video Games&quot;, Ashlee Bird compared Nightwolf to fellow series character Kotal Kahn: &quot;Why, in a game where men with four arms, necromancers, and people with all kinds of cybernetic enhancements exist, did the only two Native characters still exclusively wear feathers and animal skin and either perform as the noble savage, communing with the spirits and sacrificing themselves for the “greater good” or, the bloodthirsty warrior, sacrificing humans to an unmerciful deity?&quot;

Nightwolf&#x27;s &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; incarnation has received a more mixed reception. Tuscarora Haud of &quot;Indian Country Today&quot; rated him a 2.5 out of 10 in her 2019 ranking of Native American portrayals in video games, opining that NetherRealm Studios&#x27; &quot;attempts at a reboot of Nightwolf has led him to be more stereotypically savage and the creative team has not taken any criticism from the Native community in redesigning or retiring the character.&quot; While &quot;The Daily Aztec&quot;, in 2022, described Nightwolf as embodying &quot;the &#x27;Mystic Warrior&#x27; archetype [that] trivializes and exploits many Native beliefs&quot;, Mitchell Saltzman of &quot;IGN&quot; said that &quot;his gear and skins all feel respectfully done and avoid the pitfall of stereotypes.&quot; Christopher Teuton of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; said in 2019: &quot;Nightwolf, although many players&#x27; personal favorite, has long been considered a somewhat offensive character in the eyes of the public ... although his &quot;MK9&quot; reboot gave him a more rounded persona it&#x27;s still easy to make parallels to Native American tropes. While it&#x27;s never a good idea to go around looking for positive representation in a game that features fully-rendered testicular explosions, at least &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&#x27;s&quot; Nightwolf seems far less directly offensive than characters like &quot;Killer Instinct&#x27;s&quot; Chief Thunder.&quot;

===Other reception===
&quot;Complex&quot; ranked Nightwolf among the most underrated characters in the series, stating that &quot;the fact that he can transform into a wolf and maul you to death should tell you he&#x27;s nothing to play with.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; praised his &quot;versatile playstyle&quot; in &quot;MK11&quot; in that &quot;NetherRealm did a great job of making Nightwolf’s moveset feel unique and fun, despite the fact that many of his signature moves are actually kind of plain.&quot;

As was the case with most of the character portrayals in &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot;, Nightwolf&#x27;s appearance was critically panned. Alasdair Wilkins of io9 commented on a scene showing Nightwolf knocking Liu Kang unconscious with his hatchet: &quot;Nightwolf isn&#x27;t just a magical shapeshifting shaman who only exists to show the hero his destiny...he&#x27;s also kind of an asshole.&quot; Kate Willaert of &quot;Game Informer&quot; remarked, &quot;Nightwolf delivers the best line in the movie when he tells Liu Kang he must test his courage, and find his Animality. ... As a result, the film&#x27;s final climactic battle turns into &quot;Primal Rage: The Movie.&quot;&quot; Charlie Ridgely at ComicBook.com listed Nightwolf as one of the characters they want to see in the sequel to the 2021 live-action film, reasoning &quot;Nightwolf is a noble hero and could replace the stoic nature of Kung Lao, providing a perfect foil for Johnny Cage&#x27;s nonsense.&quot;

<doc id="1016253" wikidata="Q5265778" url="?curid=1016253" title="Detonautas">
<text>Detonautas (previously known as Detonautas Roque Clube) is a Brazilian rock band from Rio de Janeiro. Usually the lyrics of their songs relate to violence, political corruption and love.

==History==
The history of Detonautas is mixed with the onset of the fever of Internet in Brazil. In 1997, Tico Santa Cruz appeared in a chatroom asking if anyone had played any instrument, then, Eduardo Simão, who also went to the room, answered and became known by his nickname in chatrooms: Tchello. The singer Tico lived in Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro and Eduardo had a guesthouse in Ilhéus, Bahia.

After the meeting of the two precursors in Rio de Janeiro, the band went through several configurations, until more members were recruited through the Internet. The fact of how the band was formed reflected in its name: Detonadores + Internautas = Detonautas.

Thanks mainly to the insistence of Tico Santa Cruz and the providential help of his friend, Gabriel o Pensador, Detonautas were getting their first hit and after ripening on the road, mixing performances in places of good structure (the band has reached opening for Red Hot Chili Peppers to 50,000 people in Pacaembu) and others less so, but that served to give a chance and experience. After much struggle, including the famous pilgrimage to the demo under his arm, finally a chance: after much back and forth Warner Music Brazil signed the band, remixed and released their self-titled debut album, &quot;Detonautas Roque Clube&quot;, packed with the singles &quot;Outro Lugar&quot; and &quot;Quando o Sol Se For&quot; was a great national success.

The Detonautas are well known by viewers of MTV Rockgol, the championship of musicians. Were considered good players, with a 3rd place in 2003 (which Tico was the top scorer). Presenters Paulo Bonfa and Marco Bianchi dubbed almost all players, as Koala (Tico), Chainsaw (Tchello), Mane (Renato Rocha), Brasil-sil-sil (Fábio Brasil), The Grandson of Rodrigo (Rodrigo Netto), and the famous DJ &quot;Clééééston&quot;, considered veteran by the two biggest ace of the championship.

In 2004, was released their second album, &quot;Roque Marciano&quot;, who won the first gold of Detonautas. The album contains the hits &quot;O Dia Que Não Terminou&quot;, &quot;O Amanhã&quot;, &quot;Tênis Roque&quot;, &quot;Só Por Hoje&quot;, among others. On November 6, Detonautas recorded at Usina Royal, Campinas, their first DVD, &quot;Roque Marciano (Ao Vivo)&quot;, released on the same year.

In 2006, was released their third album, &quot;Psicodeliamorsexo&amp;distorção&quot;, marked by a heavier sound and a strong presence of voice. The album came packaged with songs like &quot;Não Reclame Mais&quot;, &quot;Dia Comum&quot; and &quot;Você Me Faz Tão Bem&quot; considered by many the best success of the group. For the recording of the video, the band was inspired by the movement Free Hugs, made in Australia.

=== Netto&#x27;s death ===

On June 4, 2006, the 29-year-old guitarist Rodrigo Netto was killed when passing with his car at one of the most important avenues of Rio de Janeiro. The criminals wanted his car. Rodrigo did not react to the assault, and was shot in the chest, dying at the place. With him in the car, there were his grandmother and his brother Rafael da Silva Netto who was also hit by 2 shots, with no serious consequent injuries. According to investigation by the Brazilian Military Police, the order to steal the vehicle came from drug dealers of a nearby hill, and among the criminals there was an underage boy, the gunman at the car.

Tchello, the bassist, has tattooed an image of Rodrigo&#x27;s face at his back and Tico tattooed Netto&#x27;s signature on his rib.

=== After Netto&#x27;s death ===
Two years after the death of guitarist Rodrigo Netto, the band left their label, Warner, and signed a contract with Sony Music. In the same year, they again get in the studio to record their fourth album, &quot;O Retorno de Saturno&quot;. Unlike the previous album, it contains a lighter and acoustic effect. The album contains songs like &quot;O Retorno de Saturno&quot; and &quot;Verdades do Mundo&quot;, a tribute to the deceased friend.

<text>Wanessa Godói Camargo (born 28 December 1982) is a Brazilian singer-songwriter.

== Early life ==
Camargo is the daughter of Brazilian sertanejo singer Zezé Di Camargo, from the duo Zezé Di Camargo &amp; Luciano, and businesswoman Zilú Godói. Her father worked on the Brazilian version of the musical &quot;Cats&quot; and was part of the group of dancers known as Zezé Di Camargo and Luciano.

==Biography==

Wanessa was born in Goiânia, Goiás, on 28 December 1982. She is the daughter of the Brazilian sertanejo singer Zezé Di Camargo from the duo Zezé Di Camargo &amp; Luciano and of the businesswoman Zilú Godói. She attended public schools during her childhood, but she had no toys because of the financial difficulties of her family.

In 1991, at 9 years old, she moved to São Paulo when her father and her uncle Luciano Camargo went in search of success. In 1992, she was enrolled in a private school, but suffered prejudice from colleagues and employees because of her social class.

During an interview for &quot;Veja&quot;, Wanessa said: &quot;The principal of the school was always insinuating that we would not pay the college. She humiliated us, but I was so insecure that I never told this to my parents, and even that was a mockery. Once, to make me happy, my father took a borrowed lance just to give me the taste of going to the car class.&quot;

Also in 1991, she started a band with her three friends Kiko, Leandro and Bruno, who in the future would form the group KLB. The boys played the instruments and Wanessa was the lead singer. The band&#x27;s first name was The Fenders, a reference to the guitar brand. They then changed their name to Neon and started performing at clubs and parties with versions of songs by Xuxa and Leandro &amp; Leonardo.

In 1993, at the age of ten, Wanessa began to study theater, ballet and tap dance, and over time learnt street dance. As an adolescent, she began to do gymnastics and artistic gymnastics to gain physical fitness when dancing. In 1995, she had her first theater role in the musical &quot;Cats&quot;. In 1996, she began to integrate the body of dancers of the duo Zezé Di Camargo and Luciano.

==Career==
===2000–02: First albums===
Camargo recorded a demo CD in 1999 which led to her signing to the BMG Brasil record label in 2000. Her debut single, &quot;O Amor Não Deixa (Love Won&#x27;t Let Me)&quot; was released on 11 November 2000, followed by her debut album &quot;Wanessa Camargo&quot; on 12 December 2000, composed of country pop love songs. Her self-titled debut album was recorded between Nashville and Miami, where she resided at the time. Five songs in the album were originally written in English but adapted to Portuguese, including a cover of Faith Hill&#x27;s &quot;Breathe&quot;, and the debut single, which was later re-recorded by country singer Tammy Cochran.

The follow-up single &quot;Apaixonada por Você&quot; was released on 12 February 2001, and was included on the soundtrack of the Brazilian soap opera &quot;Um Anjo Caiu do Céu,&quot; with radios being served a slow tempo country remix. New pressings of the album included the remixed version of the song, titled &quot;Um Anjo Caiu do Céu version&quot;. The third and final single, Eu Posso Te Sentir (Breathe), was released on 30 July 2001.

In 2001, Camargo made her acting debut as the fairy Honey Mel in the children&#x27;s film &quot;Xuxa e os Duendes.&quot; She recorded the track &quot;Tudo Que Você Sonhar&quot; for its soundtrack. On 25 October, she released the first single from her second album, &quot;Eu Quero Ser o Seu Amor&quot;, which marked a transition to a pop rock style with a music video inspired by video games and Japanese comics.

On 9 November, her sophomore album was released, also titled &quot;Wanessa Camargo&quot;. On 21 February 2002, the second single &quot;Tanta Saudade&quot; was released, featuring backing vocals from her father, country singer Zezé Di Camargo. &quot;Gostar de Mim&quot; was released as the third and final single from the album. In July, she recorded the short film &quot;Socialmente Correto&quot; with Oscar Magrini; however, the project was canceled.

In September, she recorded &quot;Jovens Tardes&quot;, a special TV show on the Globo Network. This saw her work again with KLB, as well as with the sertanejo duo Pedro and Thiago and the singer Fael Mondego. This aired from October and featured the presenters playing songs with their respective original artists.

On 30 November 2002, Wanessa released the single &quot;Um Dia ... Meu Primeiro Amor&quot;, followed on 2 December by her third eponymous album. On 22 February 2003, she released the pop rock single &quot;Sem Querer&quot;, accompanied by a music video with Erik Marmo. The last single of the album, &quot;Filme de Amor&quot;, was chosen after a vote on the singer&#x27;s website, the other option being &quot;Paga Pra Ver (Tô Pagando Pra Ver)&quot;.

===2003–04: &quot;Transparente&quot; and television===

In March 2003, following the good reception of the previous year&#x27;s TV special, &quot;Jovens Tardes&quot; became a regular part of Globo Network Sunday&#x27;s afternoon schedule. Wanessa appeared alongside the same co-presenters, with the addition of Luiza Possi. Each program focused on a different musical theme, such as rock, film classics and soap opera themes, with special guests playing the music.

Wanessa was due to appear in the short film &quot;S.O.S Cupido&quot;, but the project was never recorded.

On 20 September, she recorded her first DVD in Rio de Janeiro. She sought to present a more adult image by wearing more sensual clothes, dying her hair red with bangs, posing semi-naked for &quot;VIP&quot; magazine, and giving interviews on sex and taboo subjects.

On 11 January 2004, the &quot;Jovens Tardes&quot; project ended after the producer Marlene Mattos left the station. Mattos then signed with another station, Rede Bandeirantes, and invited Wanessa to host a show with the same format. She declined, wishing instead to focus on music. In February, she joined the main cast of the fourth season of the fifth version of the adaption of the children&#x27;s book &quot;Sítio do Picapau Amarelo&quot;, in which she played the rock star Diana Dechamps. On 12 March, she released her new single, &quot;Me Engana que I Gosto&quot;, a version of &quot;Miénteme&quot; by the Puerto Rican singer Olga Tañón.

On 24 May, she released her first live album, &quot;Transparente Ao Vivo&quot;, which featured four new songs and previous hits. In July, she made appeared in the children&#x27;s film &quot;Cine Gibi&quot;, adapted from the &quot;Monica&#x27;s Gang&quot; comic books.

On 12 October, she released the second single from her live album, &quot;Metade de Mim&quot; and appeared naked in the music video. In December, she starred in the second season of the reality show &quot;Quebrando a Rotina&quot;, travelling in a trailer with Felipe Dylon and the host Luciano Huck between the south coast of Rio de Janeiro and the north coast of São Paulo. She and Dylon recorded the song &quot;Amor de Praia&quot; at the end of the season. In 2005 she appeared in another reality show, &quot;Subindo a Serra&quot; with Huck, Dylon, Karina Bacchi, Preta Gil and Popó, documenting their trip to Teresópolis in Rio de Janeiro.

===2005–09: &quot;W&quot;, &quot;Total&quot; and &quot;Meu Momento&quot;===

On 11 June 2005, Wanessa released the single &quot;Amor, Amor&quot;, in a Latin pop style comparable to the music of Colombian singer Shakira.

On 8 August, she released her fourth studio album, &quot;W&quot;, which lacked the country elements of her previous albums and focused on pop and pop rock. She composed ten of the fifteen songs, her most substantial songwriting contribution so far. The album was well received by critics, who noted its maturity and originality.

On 10 January 2006, the second single, &quot;Não Resisto a Nós Dois&quot; was released; it became the seventh most played song on Brazilian radio that year. In February, she premiered the &quot;W in Tour ... Era Uma Vez&quot;, her biggest tour. Inspired by Broadway musicals, it was directed by theatre diva Marília Pêra and featured five acts and costume changes.

On 22 August, the third single from &quot;W&quot;, &quot;Louca&quot;, was released, having been chosen by the public through a website vote.

After spending a year working on a new album, Wanessa released the single &quot;Não Tô Pronta Pra Perdoar&quot; on 2 August 2007; it was a version of the song &quot;Not Ready to Make Nice&quot; by Dixie Chicks. On 21 August, she released her fifth studio album, &quot;Total,&quot; which sold 100,000 copies.

In April, her Total Tour began at Citibank Hall in São Paulo. She also worked with the Mexican band Camila on a Portuguese language version of &quot;Abrázame&quot;.

In 2009, she changed her musical style again and began to use her first name Wanessa only. Her single &quot;Fly&quot; saw her collaborate with the rapper Ja Rule. On 1 June, she released her the sixth studio album &quot;Meu Momento&quot;, featuring collaborations with Rita Lee and Alexandre Carlo and showing R&amp;B and urban musical influences. The second single, &quot;Não Me Leve a Mal&quot;, was chosen by a Twitter and was released on 28 September. Despite high expectations and a large budget, which included opening for some of Beyoncé&#x27;s shows in Brazil, the album sold only 20,000 copies.

===2010–15: &quot;DNA&quot; and &quot;DNA Tour&quot;===

In 2010, she changed musical direction again, inspired by Lady Gaga and The Black Eyed Peas to embrace electronic music .

On 1 July, Wanessa provided vocals for the track &quot;Falling for U&quot; by DJ Mister Jam. On 9 September, she released the first single from her forthcoming work, &quot;Worth It&quot;, a version of &quot;Beautiful Encounter (Yan Yu)&quot; by Elva Hsiao. Two days later her first &quot;EP&quot;, &quot;Você não Perde por Esperar&quot;, sold through a music ticket – a magnetic card from which the buyer entered a code into her website to download the songs. On 31 March she released the single &quot;Stuck On Repeat&quot;.

On 5 July 2011, she released the single &quot;Sticky Dough&quot; in collaboration with the American rapper Bam Bam. In the same month, she released her seventh studio album, &quot;DNA&quot;, recorded in English and produced by Mister Jam. Its promotion was interrupted by the announcement of Wanessa&#x27;s pregnancy.

The title track &quot;DNA&quot; was released as a second single on 24 October. A third single, &quot;Get Loud!&quot;, was released on 26 June 2012 after the singer returned from maternity leave. On 1 December 2012, she released &quot;Hair &amp; Soul&quot; with a music video sponsored by Wella. In April 2013, she released the single &quot;Shine It On&quot; and the live album &quot;DNA Tour&quot;. This was followed in June by the single &quot;Amor, Amor&quot;, and in November by &quot;Turn It Up&quot;, which featured the rapper Soulja Boy. In June 2015, she began the W15 Tour, celebrating 15 years of her career.

===2016–17: Reformulation and &quot;33&quot;===

In early 2016, she began recording her eighth studio album with a more commercial pop style and Portuguese lyrics. It was to be produced by Mister Jam and César Lemos. She also announced that she was returning to using the surname Camargo after 8 years.

On 17 May, she announced that she had shelved the material she was recording and changed the producer team to make a redirection in her career and a move towards sertanejo music. She re-recorded the album with Eduardo Pepato as producer, explaining: &quot;The way of pop I do not identify myself, it is not my beach, my footprint is romanticism and the sertanejo is a strong mark of my I&#x27;m doing what I believe.&quot;

She left her contract with Sony Music and signed with Work Show, known for its sertanejo releases. On 26 July, she released the first single from the album, &quot;Coração Embriagado&quot;; this reached number 19 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Brasil, the best result of her career until then. &quot;Vai que Vira Amor&quot; was released as a promotional single on 26 August. On 19 August she released her eighth studio album, titled &quot;33&quot;. The work received harsh criticism, with critics labelling her a sell-out &quot;without musical identity&quot;.

==Musical characteristics==
===Influences===
Wanessa has cited Celine Dion, Shania Twain and Mariah Carey as three of her great references. In her early albums, she sought inspiration from country pop artists, noting Twain as well as Dixie Chicks and Faith Hill; she has covered the songs &quot;Not Ready to Make Nice&quot; and &quot;Breathe&quot; by the latter two artists. She performed with her father on the &quot;Pai e Filha Tuor&quot; and sang several songs by artists who influenced her, including &quot;From This Moment On&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re Still the One&quot; by Twain. Another artist cited as important in her development is Rita Lee, with whom she re-recorded the track &quot;Coisas da Vida&quot; for the album &quot;Meu Momento&quot;.

In 2005, as she moved to a pop music style, she cited influences such as Christina Aguilera, Shakira, Michael Jackson and Madonna (noting that her favorite Madonna songs were &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; and &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;).

In 2010, during an interview with &quot;Kboing&quot;, she cited Jay-Z, Alicia Keys, Beyoncé, Lauryn Hill, and Lady Gaga as influences. In 2016, during an interview for the &quot;Programa do Porchat&quot;, she mentioned other women of the genre, such as Paula Fernandes, Maiara and Maraisa, Marília Mendonça and Naiara Azevedo, as references for the new phase of the career in sertanejo.

===Musical style===
Wanessa&#x27;s earlier career encompassed country pop, pop music and dance-pop. She also recorded songs in genres such as pop rock (&quot;Sem Querer&quot;, &quot;Não Resisto a Nós Dois&quot;), reggaeton (&quot;Me Engana que Eu Gosto&quot;, &quot;Amor Amor&quot;), forró (&quot;Me Pega de Jeito&quot;), dubstep (&quot;Sticky Dougth&quot;), arrocha (&quot;Vai Que Vira Amor&quot;) and R&amp;B (&quot;Fly&quot;, &quot;Não Me Leve a Mal&quot;).

In an interview in 2013, she said that she has always tried to keep Brazilian elements in her songs, for example funk carioca from Rio in &quot;Sticky Dough.&quot;

She set aside her usual musical styles on the album &quot;DNA&quot; in 2011, which featured EDM, electronic and electropop and was recorded entirely in English.

In 2016, she began to record in the sertanejo genre.

===Voice===
Wanessa has a mezzo-soprano voice with a range of 3.2 octaves. In the songs &quot;Não Me Leve a Mal&quot; and &quot;Eu Estarei Aqui&quot;, she holds a note for 16 seconds.

==Personal life==
In 1998, at age 16, she was the initial target of a kidnapping; the kidnappers accidentally took her uncle Welington Camargo instead and sent the family a piece of his ear, and the incident became a national story. Soon after, even though she was protected by security, she suffered a new attack when her school was robbed. After that attack, her family moved to the city of Plantation, Florida, United States for a year, to protect her from future attacks.

In 1998, during adolescence, Wanessa dated the singer Leandro Scornavacca, a member of KLB. The relationship ended a year later when she moved to the United States. In 2000 she began a relationship with the actor Dado Dolabella, which lasted until 2002. In 2003 she had brief relationships with the actor Erik Marmo and with the singers Felipe Dylon and Rogério Flausino. In 2004 also she dated the actor Rodrigo Prado for six months.

In 2003 Wanessa revealed in an interview for &quot;Veja&quot; magazine that she had not been a virgin for some time. Her parents did not know this and, days later, her father was surprised by the news in an interview.

In 2005 she met Marcus Buaiz, businessman from Espírito Santo, and the couple married on 26 May 2007. On 18 June 2011 she announced her first pregnancy during an interview for the magazine &quot;Contigo!.&quot; José Marcus was born on 5 January 2012. In December 2013 she announced she was pregnant again. Her second son, João Francisco, was born on 19 June 2014.

==Activism==
Wanessa is an ambassador for the NGO Fundação SOS Mata Atlântica, which is fighting for the preservation of the Atlantic Forest. Due to her efforts to promote the NGO and its goals, and her work for the clean-up of the Tietê River in São Paulo, she was awarded the 2007 Pro-Social Prize at the My Nick Awards event. She also received the title of Personality of the Year and JK Jewel from Cicesp. In 2012, she donated a fee of $150,000 from an advertisement to Unicef.

In 2014, she donated a $50,000 fee from &quot;Caras&quot; magazine towards social projects. She also put on a virtual fundraising show as part of a fundraising campaign for a boy named Ryan, who suffers from Ondine syndrome. In December 2015, Wanessa was appointed a UN ambassador, committing herself to UNAIDS actions in response to HIV and discrimination.

===LGBT advocacy===
In 2009, Wanessa became involved in LGBT causes and the fight for equal rights for all: &quot;Every human being has the option of loving whoever he or she wants, regardless of their sexual choice. I think it&#x27;s great, I do not see anything against being against people who make love, is ridiculous. It is a posture of society that no longer fits in today&#x27;s time.&quot; In 2011 and 2015, Wanessa performed at the 15th São Paulo Gay Pride Parade for audiences of 1 million people.

After having her first child with businessman Marcus Buaiz, the singer was asked how she would react if her son was gay: &quot;I look the best I can.&quot; In 2013, she celebrated on social media the approval of law 4277, which recognized same-sex marriage in Brazil and has criticized Marco Feliciano&#x27;s &#x27;Gay Cure&#x27; project.

In 2015, Wanessa criticized opposition to adoption by homosexual couples: &quot;A human being who says in the name of God that it is better for a child to be abandoned than to have two parents can not speak in the name of God. A lack of education and prejudice dictate what you are. God is in our hearts, in our actions, in the love of our neighbor, in compassion; love is God, love is greater than everything.&quot;

<doc id="1016261" wikidata="Q38361" url="?curid=1016261" title="Barão Vermelho">
<text>Barão Vermelho () is a Brazilian rock band. Formed in 1981 in Rio de Janeiro, it was originally led by songwriting duo Cazuza (singer) and Roberto Frejat (guitarist), who assumed the vocals after Cazuza&#x27;s departure in 1985. Frejat left the band in 2017 and was replaced by Rodrigo Suricato. They are considered one of the most influential bands in Brazilian rock.

==History==
===Formation===
The band, named after Snoopy&#x27;s &quot;Red Baron&quot; strips, began in 1981, in Rio de Janeiro, as a literal garage band, when Maurício Barros and Guto Goffi, both studying at Imaculada Conceição High School, got together to play Led Zeppelin and The Rolling Stones at the former&#x27;s parents&#x27; house. Guitarist Roberto Frejat and bassist Dé Palmeira joined them, and the band began to look for a singer. One candidate was singer and guitarist Léo Jaime from Goiás, who was turned down by the band, because they considered his vocal style &quot;too soft&quot; for their taste. Jaime suggested one of his colleagues at acting class, Agenor Miranda Araújo Neto, more commonly known as Cazuza, and noted that he was &quot;the son of João Araújo&quot; – a reference that the &quot;barões&quot; missed, only later learning that João Araújo was an executive at Som Livre, one of Brazil&#x27;s largest record companies. Cazuza showed them some lyrics that he had already written, and Barão Vermelho, which had been a cover band until then, began writing their own songs.

They recorded their first album, &quot;Barão Vermelho&quot; by Som Livre in only two days in 1982. The album included songs such as &quot;Bilhetinho Azul&quot;, &quot;Ponto Fraco&quot; and &quot;Down em Mim.&quot; They played in a few concerts in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo and returned to the studio for a month to record their second album, &quot;Barão Vermelho 2&quot;, which was released in 1983 and which includes the song &quot;Pro Dia Nascer Feliz&quot;.

=== Gaining recognition ===
Despite having released two albums the radios refused to play their songs. Barão only gained recognition after Caetano Veloso called Cazuza the greatest poet of his generation and played a cover of &quot;Todo Amor Que Houver Nessa Vida&quot;, and Ney Matogrosso recorded &quot;Pro Dia Nascer Feliz&quot;. As a result, they were invited to write the soundtrack for a film called &quot;Bete Balanço&quot; in 1984, spreading their fame across the country. This same year they released their third album, &quot;Maior Abandonado&quot;, which includes the song &quot;Bete Balanço&quot;. This album sold more than 100 thousand copies in only 6 months. In January 1985, Barão Vermelho played at Rock in Rio.

=== Cazuza leaves===
Cazuza had already expressed his desire to pursue a solo career, and had Frejat&#x27;s support as long as he did not leave the band. However, after some fights, Cazuza left the band for good, taking with him a few songs for his first solo album. Frejat took over as singer and in 1986 the band released their fourth album, &quot;Declare Guerra&quot;. Though famous artists like Renato Russo and Arnaldo Antunes helped compose the album, it did not receive much promotion. In 1987 they released their fifth album, &quot;Rock&#x27;n Geral&quot;. The album received good reviews, but sold poorly, selling less than 15 thousand copies. This same year Mauricio left the band and Peninha entered as a percussionist and Magalhães as guitarist. Barros would return as a guest musician in many Barão albums.

===Back on the Charts===
In 1988 the band released their sixth album, &quot;Carnaval&quot;, which mixed hard rock with romantic lyrics. The album was a huge success on the radio, guaranteeing Barão Vermelho the opportunity to open for Rod Stewart in Brazil. The following year, with their popularity high, they released their seventh album, &quot;Barão ao Vivo&quot;, and this same year Som Livre released the collection, &quot;Melhores Momentos: Cazuza &amp; Barão Vermelho&quot;. The album included rare and previously unreleased tracks such as &quot;Eclipse Oculto&quot; and &quot;Eu Queria Ter Uma Bomba&quot;.

In 1990 bassist, Dé, left the band after continuous fights, and Dadi entered in his place. This same year, Barão recorded and released &quot;Na Calada da Noite&quot;, showing their acoustic side. This album included the song &quot;O Poeta está Vivo&quot; – an allusion to Cazuza, who died a few months earlier due to complications caused by the AIDS virus.

In 1991 the band was chosen by the public and critics of &quot;Bizz&quot; magazine as the best Brazilian band of the year, and recorded an MTV Unplugged. In this same year, keyboardist Maurício Barros returned to the band. The following year they were named the best band of Hollywood Rock.

In 1992 the band released the albums &quot;Supermercados da Vida&quot;, which includes the hit &quot;Pedra Flor e Espinho&quot; and in 1994 they released &quot;Carne Crua&quot;, with the single &quot;Meus Bons Amigos&quot; before Dadi left, being replaced by Rodrigo Santos. In 1995, the band opened for The Rolling Stones in the Brazilian Voodoo Lounge shows, and in the following year released an album of covers, &quot;Álbum&quot;, with the most successful song being a version of Bezerra da Silva&#x27;s &quot;Malandragem Dá Um Tempo&quot;.

In 1998, Barão released &quot;Puro Êxtase&quot;, a techno-influenced album that became their most successful in the decade, led by the electronica &quot;Puro Extase&quot; and the ballad &quot;Por Você&quot;. In 1999 they recorded an album for MTV Brasil, &quot;Balada MTV: Barão Vermelho&quot;.

The band entered a hiatus in the early 2000s, so Frejat could focus on his solo career. The band came back to release another album, titled &quot;Barão Vermelho&quot;, in 2004. The following year saw the release &quot;MTV ao Vivo: Barão Vermelho&quot;, which includes &quot;Codinome Beija-Flor&quot; a Cazuza song, in which they sampled clips from this song&#x27;s official music video, so to simulate a duet. In January 2007 the band entered another hiatus.

<text>Capital Inicial is a Brazilian rock band from Brasília flourished in the 1980s, saw a resurgence in the late 1990s, and extended into the 2000s.

==History==
The band has recorded fourteen studio albums, five live albums and six DVDs in their 40-year career. They were a huge success in the early and mid-2000s, being one of the most popular bands in Brazil.

Former members of Renato Russo&#x27;s pioneering post-punk band Aborto Elétrico teamed up to form the Capital Inicial, continuing to perform the same type of music. Brothers Fê Lemos and Flávio Lemos joined guitarist Loro Jones and vocalist Dinho Ouro Preto. All of them are based in Brasília. With similar songs as Aborto Elétrico&#x27;s repertoire, the Capital Inicial followed in their path. The first time that Capital Inicial played in Rio was on July 23, 1983, opening a Lobão show at the Circo Voador. In 1984, they released their first single, &quot;Descendo o Rio Nilo&quot; and &quot;Leve Desespero&quot;, with good repercussions. The latter song was included in the film Areias Escaldantes. In April 1985, Capital Inicial succeeded in having their &quot;Descendo o Rio Nilo&quot; included on the compilation Os Intocáveis. In the next year, the group recorded their first album, &quot;Capital Inicial&quot;, which had the hits &quot;Psicopata&quot;, &quot;Música Urbana&quot; and &quot;Fátima&quot; selling 200,000 copies. This was followed by a period of many live shows.

In 1987, keyboardist Bozo Barretti, who had participated in the album, joined the band, who recorded a second album, &quot;Independência&quot;. With a pop-based sonority, the album sold half as much as the first. In November, the band opened for Sting at a packed Maracanã.

In December 1988, the group released their third album, &quot;Você Não Precisa Entender&quot;, which was assaulted by commercialism. The album sold only 50,000 copies. Understanding that they were losing their punk rock fans and weren&#x27;t gaining pop fans, in their fourth album, &quot;Todos os Lados&quot;, they replaced standardized keyboards with aggressive guitars. But the change of direction came too late. The album sold a little more than 30,000 copies, and their fifth album, &quot;Eletricidade&quot;, barely sold 20,000 copies. This crisis provoked the departure of Bozzo Barretti and Dinho Ouro Preto and the acquisition of a new vocalist, Murilo Lima, with whom their sixth album, the independent &quot;Rua 47&quot;, was recorded in 1994. In 1996, they recorded the live album &quot;Capital Inicial ao Vivo&quot;, and in 1998, Murilo Lima left the band.

In 2000, the band release an unplugged album recorded at a Brazilian MTV live concert. This album became a tremendous hit in Brazil. As of 2006, the band does regular concerts in major Brazilian cities, enjoying great success with older Aborto Elétrico songs as well as newly recorded material.

<doc id="1016270" wikidata="Q1720717" url="?curid=1016270" title="Out of the Blue (1980 film)">
<text>Out of the Blue (released in Canada as No Looking Back) is a 1980 drama film directed by Dennis Hopper, and starring Linda Manz, Hopper, Sharon Farrell, Don Gordon, and Raymond Burr. The film was produced by Leonard Yakir and written by him and Brenda Nielson. Its plot follows a troubled and rebellious teenage girl living in the Pacific Northwest with her dysfunctional mother and alcoholic father. The title is taken from the Neil Young song &quot;My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)&quot;, which is also featured in the film.

The film competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival, where it was met by controversy for its frank depiction of juvenile delinquency, drug use, and incest.

==Plot==
Cindy &quot;Cebe&quot; Barnes is a rebellious adolescent tomboy being raised by her heroin-addicted mother, Kathy, in rural British Columbia. Cebe&#x27;s father, Don, an abusive alcoholic, is serving a prison sentence for a road accident in which he drunkenly crashed his semi-truck into a school bus, killing all of the school children on board; Cebe was in the truck cab with him when the crash occurred. In Don&#x27;s absence, Kathy has carried on an affair with Paul, the owner of the restaurant where she is employed as a waitress. Don&#x27;s friend, Charlie, makes lecherous advances toward Cebe, and also forces a sexual relationship with Kathy, to whom he provides heroin.

Cebe finds escapism in idolizing musicians such as Elvis Presley, Sid Vicious, and Johnny Rotten, and spends time alone in her father&#x27;s wrecked semi-truck, which has been left abandoned on her family&#x27;s property. She seeks further refuge from her unstable home life by sneaking into local bars, and hitchhiking to Vancouver. On one occasion in the city, Cebe accompanies a cab driver to his apartment to smoke marijuana. She narrowly escapes when the cabby and his prostitute girlfriend make sexual advances toward her. Cebe flees to a punk concert being put on by Pointed Sticks, a local band. She is treated kindly by the band members, who allow her to watch them perform from the stage; the drummer briefly allows her to play on his drum kit during the performance. Eventually, Cebe is apprehended by police as a runaway minor, and is evaluated by child psychologist Dr. Brean, who returns her to the care of her mother.

Don is released from prison on probation after five years of incarceration, and returns home, where Kathy unsuccessfully attempts to regroup their family. Don continues to engage in reckless behavior and drinking, and shows little remorse for the accident he caused. When the father of one of the children killed in the crash gets Don fired from his job at a local landfill, Don retaliates with the help of Charlie by bludgeoning the man to death outside his home. Later, he shows Cebe a stick of dynamite he stole from the landfill, which he plans on selling for quick money. Don begins physically abusing Kathy, and the stress in the household causes Cebe to lash out at school. She is again evaluated by Dr. Brean, who comes to suspect that Don has sexually abused Cebe since childhood.

Late one night, Don and Charlie get belligerently drunk at the Barnes&#x27; house, while Kathy uses heroin in the bathroom. The men joke about Cebe possibly being a lesbian, and Don suggests that Charlie rape her. This drives an incoherent Kathy to tears. Don and Charlie barrel into Cebe&#x27;s bedroom, where she is dyeing her hair black to resemble that of Elvis. She rebuffs them both, proclaiming her hatred for her father, and forces them and an inconsolable Kathy out of the room. Don later returns to Cebe&#x27;s bedroom, and recounts memories to her from her childhood. Cebe defiantly tells him she remembers his abuse, before cutting his throat with a pair of scissors, killing him.

Cebe later awakens Kathy, dressed in her father&#x27;s leather coat, and with a safety pin pierced through her cheek. Cebe insists that Kathy go with her to the wreckage of Don&#x27;s truck, so they can have a conversation. Kathy agrees to go with her. In the truck, Cebe lights the wick of the dynamite, which she has hidden in the dashboard, and assures her mother it is only an electrical fuse from the wreckage. Moments later, Cebe references Sid Vicious, who &quot;took his loved ones with him&quot; when he died, before the wrecked truck explodes, killing them both.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
This was the first film Hopper directed since 1971&#x27;s &quot;The Last Movie&quot;; originally hired as just an actor, Hopper stepped in at the last minute to replace the original director (screenwriter Leonard Yakir).

Hopper redrafted the screenplay—which had originally focused on a psychologist&#x27;s reforming of a troubled girl—into a darker story with a tragic conclusion.

===Filming===
The film was made in Vancouver, from October 15, 1979, to December 3, 1979. Various icons of Vancouver in that era are featured in the film, including the Pointed Sticks, one of the leading bands of Vancouver&#x27;s punk era. Actress Sharon Farrell recalled that Hopper essentially &quot;rewrote the script&quot; for the film every morning, and that he mandated the cast meet each day at 5:00 a.m. to discuss the day&#x27;s shoot.

==Release==
&quot;Out of the Blue&quot; was shown in competition at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1980, a screening during which critic Rex Reed wrote was met by &quot;boos, catcalls, and general nausea by shocked audiences who still cannot believe what they have seen.&quot; It was later released in Paris on April 15, 1981, Los Angeles on December 3, 1982, New York on April 8, 1983, and in Vancouver, Canada on December 3, 1983.

===Critical response===
The film has received praise for Manz&#x27;s performance in the decades following its release. Roger Ebert wrote in his 3½-star review that &quot;the movie escalates so relentlessly toward its violent, nihilistic conclusion that when it comes, we believe it.&quot;

A review in the British publication &quot;The Guardian&quot; deemed the film an &quot;accomplished dissection of fractured redneck family life,&quot; and declared Manz&#x27;s performance as &quot;stunning.&quot; &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;″s Bruce McCabe praised the film&#x27;s direction and performances, and also discussed its controversial subject matter, which, though difficult to make the film marketable, &quot;shouldn&#x27;t be held against it.&quot;

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 95% from 38 reviews. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;Led by Linda Manz&#x27;s outstanding performance, &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; confronts the darker side of human nature with a baleful, clear-eyed stare.&quot;

===Home media===
&quot;Out of the Blue&quot; was first released on VHS by Media Home Entertainment in 1984, and again in 1988. Anchor Bay Entertainment released &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; on DVD on July 27, 1999. In 2022, Severin Films released a UHD and Blu-ray combination set of the film, featuring a brand new restoration, along with numerous new bonus materials and interviews. Severin also issued a standalone Blu-ray disc as well as a DVD edition, the latter of which features a portion of the extras included on the Blu-ray editions.

==Legacy==
&quot;Out of the Blue&quot; developed a cult following in the years following its release, and has been cited by film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum as one of the 15 best films of the 1980s. In 2019, actresses Natasha Lyonne and Chloë Sevigny—both fans of the film—helped organize a crowdfund to restore it from its original elements. The restored version was screened at the 2019 Venice Film Festival. It subsequently toured the United States in early 2022, with screenings at the American Cinematheque in Los Angeles, Duke University&#x27;s Arts Center, Vancouver&#x27;s Polygon Gallery, and the Hollywood Theatre in Portland, Oregon.

The song &quot;Kill All Hippies&quot; from Scottish rock band Primal Scream&#x27;s 2000 album &quot;XTRMNTR&quot; features a sample of Manz&#x27; dialogue from the movie.

<doc id="1016277" wikidata="Q1346290" url="?curid=1016277" title="RBS 70">
<text>RBS 70 (Robotsystem 70) is a man-portable air-defense system (MANPADS) designed for anti-aircraft warfare in all climate zones and with little to no support from other forces. Originally designed and manufactured by the Swedish defence firm of Bofors Defence (now Saab Bofors Dynamics, since 2000). It uses the RB 70 missile, which is also in use in a number of other Swedish missile systems.

==History==

Before RBS 70 the mainstay of Swedish short range air defence was Robotsystem 69 (American Redeye) and the Swedish Bofors m/48 AAA. Development of the Rbs 70 to supply the Swedish air defence with a low-cost, easy-to-use and effective short-range SAM system began in 1969 when Bofors AB was contracted, who decided to use a novel guidance system in the form of a laser-beam riding missile co-developed with Laser Diode Laboratories. Further studies showed the need of a radar and an Identification friend or foe-system which were ordered from LM Ericsson and Svenska Aktiebolaget Trådlös Telegrafi (SATT) respectively in 1972. 
This became the first missile system to fully use computer simulated firing, with some 10 000 shots taken during development. In 1975, the finished system went into series production, and RBS 70 was taken into service in 1977. In 1982, the missile was improved to MK I, while the MK II came in 1990. The fourth generation, the Mach 2 &quot;BOLIDE&quot; all target missile appeared in 2003 along with improvements of the IFF-system and the ability to add a BORC thermal imager. The auto-tracking RBS 70 Next Generation with an integrated thermal imager came in 2011, now with a range of 9000 metres and 5000 metre height coverage.

As a side development, the vehicle-mounted all-weather Robotsystem 90 was in service from 1993 to 2004, then mothballed until it was reactivated in 2017.

==Design==

The RBS 70 is a Short-range Air Defense (SHORAD) laser guided missile system.

Mk 1 and Mk 2 followed shortly and are the standard RBS 70 with a range of 5,000–6,000 m and a ceiling of 3,000 m. Currently, RBS 70 is operational in 20 customer countries, on all continents and in arctic, desert, and tropical environments.

In 2003 the &quot;BOLIDE&quot; upgrade system was introduced to the RBS 70. The BOLIDE missile is an RBS 70 Mk 2 upgrade that is faster (Mach 2 vs Mach 1.6), with a range up to and can reach an altitude of 6 km. Deliveries were initiated in 2005.

===Latest upgrade===
In 2011, Saab Bofors Dynamics (successor company of Bofors Defence) announced the introduction of the new RBS 70 New Generation (RBS 70 NG). The upgraded version included an improved sighting system automatic target tracking capable of night vision and improved training and after-action review features.

==Operational use==
Iran used the RBS 70 system during the Iran–Iraq War against Iraqi aircraft.

In 1990, the Royal Australian Navy embarked two RBS 70 units and Australian Army operators on board the fleet replenishment ship HMAS &quot;Success&quot; when it deployed to the Persian Gulf in the lead-up to the first Gulf War in Kuwait.

In 1992, a Venezuelan Army RBS 70 SAM is attributed with having shot down a rebel OV-10 Bronco during the 27 November 1992 coup attempt.

The Australian government has announced the Short Range Ground Based Air Defence in 2017. The plan is to find a replacement for the RBS-70. As of 2019 the NASAMS is the chosen option. Defence Department has signed a contract with Raytheon Australia. Planned replacement of the RBS-70 is financial year 2022–23.

RBS 70 was supplied to Ukraine by Sweden at the beginning of 2023 during the Russian invasion. Sweden also provided Ukraine with the Giraffe 75 short range radar for use with the RBS 70. The Ukrainian military claims to have used RBS 70 to shoot down Russian cruise missiles and Iranian-made loitering munitions.

On 17 August 2023, near Robotyne, members of the 47th Brigade used a RBS 70 to shoot down a Russian Ka-52, reportedly killing one of the two crew. On 5 December 2023, Lieutenant General Mykola Oleschuk stated that a Ukrainian RBS 70 anti-aircraft missile took down a Su-24 aircraft using the RBS-70 MANPAD in Odesa Oblast.

On 25 October 2023, the 25th airborne brigade shot down one Mi-8 helicopter in the Luhansk region using RBS-70 missile.

On 6 December 2023, the Ukrainian Air Force shot down one Russian Su-24 in Odesa Oblast using a RBS-70. On 24 December 2023, the 47th Separate Mechanized Brigade downed a Russian SuperCam drone using a RBS-70.

On 13 May 2024, the 110th Mechanized Brigade shot down two Russian Su-25 and one Ka-52 helicopter using a RBS-70.

On 29 April 2024, Australian Deputy PM and Defence Minister Richard Marles announced a $100 million (AUD) aid package for Ukraine. Half of this is for air defence, Minister Marles said that &quot;dozens of million dollars&quot; of RBS-70s will be provided to Ukraine. Australia is retiring RBS-70 in favour of NASAMS. It is not clear if the &quot;Saab Giraffe&quot; radar is included.

<text>Sir Henry de Montfort (November 1238 – 4 August 1265) was the son of Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, and with his father played an important role in the struggle of the barons against King Henry III. Henry&#x27;s mother was Princess Eleanor of England, a daughter of King John, whose marriage to Simon further increased the foreign influence begun by the king, which was to result in great hostility by those very barons who later revolted against the king.

==Life==
Henry&#x27;s father was Simon de Montfort, the leader of the English Barons in the Second Barons&#x27; War. 
Simon was the younger son of Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester, a French noble who had been barred from his English titles and claims due to his allegiance to the French crown. Upon his father&#x27;s death, the younger Simon had traded his interests in the family&#x27;s French titles with his older brother for the sole possession of the English claims, and moved to England in 1229 to assert them. Becoming a favorite of Henry III, the younger Simon de Montfort received permission to marry the king&#x27;s sister Eleanor of England, a jump in social status that alarmed the English nobility. 
In gratitude for the King&#x27;s permission and support, the first son was named Henry in his honor.

==Second Barons&#x27; War== 
Despite this relationship, Henry de Montfort sided with his father and the other nobles in revolt against his namesake in the Second Barons&#x27; War, with his father emerging as the leader of the rebellion and eventually the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the nation.
In January 1264, Henry was one of the deputies sent to represent the barons at the Mise of Amiens. When the Mise was set aside he commanded a body of troops despatched to secure the Welsh border. On 28 February, he stormed and sacked Worcester, and soon afterwards took Gloucester, but on Edward&#x27;s approach he made a truce with him and retired to Kenilworth. With his brother Guy de Montfort, he led the vanguard at the battle of Lewes, 14 May 1264. After the victory, on 28 May, he was made constable of Dover Castle, Warden of the Cinque Ports, and treasurer of Sandwich.
When the siege of Gloucester began in 1265, Henry de Montfort and Humphrey de Bohun, holding the King and Prince Edward (later Edward I) as prisoners, spent two weeks fortifying the town and castle. 
Henry then accompanied his father to Evesham, where they intended to rendezvous with Henry&#x27;s younger brother, Simon de Montfort the Younger. 
Instead they met Prince Edward, who had ambushed the younger de Montfort&#x27;s army and then marched under its stolen Montfort banners to lure Henry and the elder Simon into a trap.

==Aftermath for Henry&#x27;s family==
Henry&#x27;s brother Simon arrived at Evesham in time to see their father&#x27;s head mounted on a spear. Another brother, Guy de Montfort, was captured during the battle and imprisoned. 
Guy later escaped and joined the younger Simon in flight to Europe. 
They found fortune in the service of Charles of Anjou, and later avenged the deaths of their father and brother by killing Henry of Almain, the nephew of the King, and their own cousin. 
This act taking place in a church, the brothers were excommunicated, which retracted sympathy for them in England. 
Simon died soon thereafter. 
As Count of Nola, Guy had two daughters, becoming in time an ancestor to several European royal families, including the British. Another brother, Amaury de Montfort, also fled to Italy. 
A cleric, he worked in the papacy before accompanying his sister Eleanor de Montfort to Wales for her marriage to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Prince of Wales. Captured by mercenaries in the employ of King Edward, the siblings were eventually released and Eleanor&#x27;s marriage took place. 
Eleanor died on 19 June 1282 giving birth to Gwenllian of Wales. 
Amaury returned to the continent, worked as a cleric, and died sometime after 1301.

<doc id="1016300" wikidata="Q2916114" url="?curid=1016300" title="Pato Fu">
<text>Pato Fu is a Brazilian indie rock band from Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais. The band was formed by lead singer &amp; rhythm guitarist Fernanda Takai, lead guitarist John Ulhoa, and bassist Ricardo Koctus, in September 1992. Long-time drummer Xande Tamietti left the band in 2014, being replaced by Glauco Nastácia; keyboardist Richard Neves replaced [Lulu Camargo in 2016. The band is also famous for their 2010 album Música de Brinquedo, which was written using only toy instruments. It was at one point included with U2 and Radiohead in a list of the 10 best bands in the world, according to Time magazine.

== History ==
Their first album, &quot;Rotomusic de Liquidificapum&quot;, was released in 1993, followed, since then, by other eight releases: &quot;Gol de Quem?&quot; (1995), &quot;Tem Mas Acabou&quot; (1996), &quot;Televisão de Cachorro&quot; (1998), &quot;Isopor&quot; (1999), &quot;Ruído Rosa&quot; (2000), &quot;MTV ao Vivo: No Museu de Arte da Pampulha&quot; (2002), &quot;Toda Cura para Todo Mal&quot; (2005), and &quot;Daqui Pro Futuro&quot; (2007), and with launch scheduled for 2010, &quot;Música de Brinquedo&quot;. The band&#x27;s popularity began to increase simultaneously with two other groups from Belo Horizonte, Jota Quest and Skank. The band plays in alternative rock style, but resorting frequently to experimental music elements. Pato Fu is frequently said to be influenced by Os Mutantes, a famous Brazilian tropicalist group from the 1960s, probably because of the experimentalism found in both bands&#x27; songs. Their music is influenced by Devo, The Cure, Radiohead, Pizzicato Five, Super Furry Animals and also Brazilian Popular Music, among various others. Takai once said her singing is influenced by Suzanne Vega, of whom she is a fan.

Takai and Ulhoa are married and had a daughter, Nina, in 2003.

The band name is from a &quot;Garfield&quot; comic strip. Garfield attacked the mailman with his &quot;Cat Fu&quot; techniques. The band liked the wordplay, but decided to change &quot;Gato&quot; (cat) to &quot;Pato&quot; (duck). Coincidentally or not, the expression had also previously appeared in the Brazilian translation of the &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; movie, as the translation to the term &quot;quack-fu&quot;.

The band celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2003 with the release of &quot;MTV ao Vivo: No Museu de Arte da Pampulha&quot;, a live performance with some of their most famous songs.

In 2010, Pato Fu recorded an album of Brazilian and international rock classics played only with toy instruments called &quot;Música de Brinquedo&quot;, which generated a positive response from the public. Songs such as &quot;Live And Let Die&quot; and &quot;Rock And Roll Lullaby&quot; were present. A live DVD, called &quot;Música de Brinquedo Ao Vivo&quot;, was recorded in 2011.

In 2015, their album &quot;Não Pare Pra Pensar&quot; was nominated for the 16th Latin Grammy Awards in the Best Brazilian Rock Album category. Their album &quot;30&quot; was chosen by the Associação Paulista de Críticos de Arte as one of the 50 best Brazilian albums of 2023.

<doc id="1016301" wikidata="Q1263195" url="?curid=1016301" title="Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo">
<text>The Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo (abbreviated RMWB) is a specialized municipality in northeast Alberta, Canada. It is the largest regional municipality in Canada by area (105650.88km2 | this number includes Wood Buffalo Nation Park of Canada) and is home to oil sand deposits known as the Athabasca oil sands.

== History ==
The &quot;Municipality of Wood Buffalo&quot; was incorporated as a specialized municipality on April 1, 1995 as a result of the amalgamation of the City of Fort McMurray and Improvement District No. 143. Specialized municipality status was granted to provide &quot;for the unique needs of a municipality including a large urban centre and a large rural territory with a small population.&quot; The &quot;Municipality of Wood Buffalo&quot; subsequently changed its name to the &quot;Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo&quot; on August 14, 1996.

=== June 2013 floods ===
By June 12, 2013, after many days of heavy rain, the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo declared a state of emergency. They organized evacuations from some areas and placed others under boil water advisories as local waterways, such as the Hangingstone River, rose to dangerously elevated levels south of Fort McMurray, causing the closure of Highway 63.

=== “The Beast” Horse River Wildfire (2016) ===

From May 3, 2016 on, over 80,000 people were affected by evacuations, by May 3 at 6:49 pm, the entirety of Fort McMurray and surrounding areas were placed under a mandatory evacuation. making it Alberta&#x27;s largest evacuation for a wildfire.

=== April 2020 floods ===
By April 30, 2020, after a 25-kilometre-long ice jam formed in the Athabasca River, flooding the northern Alberta city&#x27;s downtown and surrounding areas, and forcing 13,000 people from their home, Fort McMurray&#x27;s spring flood caused more than $520 million in insured damage, according to new numbers from the Insurance Bureau of Canada. That flood damage was followed by $1.2 billion in damage from a hailstorm in Calgary, Airdrie and Rocky View County, flooding in Edmonton in July and another storm in Calgary on July 24.

== Geography ==
The Regional Municipality (RM) of Wood Buffalo is in the northeast corner of the province of Alberta. It borders the province of Saskatchewan to the east; the Northwest Territories to the north; Improvement District No. 24 (Wood Buffalo National Park), Mackenzie County, and the Municipal District of Opportunity No. 17 to the west; and Athabasca County and the Municipal District of Bonnyville No. 87 to the south. The Athabasca River meanders northward through the central portion of the RM of Wood Buffalo before emptying into Lake Athabasca. Some of its water bodies include Christina Lake, Gardiner Lakes, Garson Lake, Gipsy Lake, Gordon Lake, Gregoire Lake, McClelland Lake, Namur Lake, Richardson Lake, and Winefred Lake (also partially within Lac La Biche County and the Municipal District of Bonnyville No. 87). Discharging northward from Lake Athabasca is Riviere des Rochers, which at its confluence with the Peace River becomes the Slave River. The Slave River forms much of the RM of Wood Buffalo&#x27;s boundary with Improvement District No. 24 north of the confluence. Land formations include the Birch Mountains northwest of Fort McKay, Fort Hills north of Fort McKay, and Thickwood Hills west of Fort McMurray. A portion of the Peace-Athabasca Delta is also within the RM of Wood Buffalo.

=== Hydrology ===
The Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo (RMWB) is in the lower basin of the Athabasca River watershed and Fort McMurray is the largest community on the banks of the river. Local rivers include the Hangingstone River, Clearwater River and Christina River, a tributary of the Clearwater River.

The Hangingstone River drains an area of , which is dominated by muskeg, and flows into the Clearwater River just upstream of the Athabasca River at Fort McMurray. The river often experiences high flows in the spring during snow melt, during heavy rainfall events and when ice jams occur during spring ice break. The RMWB warns citizens of the potential for sudden flash floods &quot;especially in populated areas adjacent to the Athabasca River, Clearwater River and Christina River.&quot; Water levels have been monitored by the Water Survey of Canada since 1970 (WSC station 07CD004). During the spring months there is increased monitoring of the &quot;Clearwater River to the south of the urban service area to provide warning of an ice break&quot; and the &quot;Athabasca River upper basin, local river levels, precipitation and overall weather patterns.&quot;

The Clearwater River, designated as part of the Canadian Heritage Rivers System, flows from its headwaters at Lloyd Lake in northwest Saskatchewan into northeast Alberta before joining the Athabasca River at Fort McMurray. &quot;The lack of significant oil sands developments means that the Clearwater River can be used as a baseline river system to provide information on the variability and characteristics of natural systems.&quot;

<text>Örbyhus is a locality situated in Tierp Municipality, Uppsala County, Sweden with 2,153 inhabitants in 2018.

Örbyhus Castle, located a few kilometers from the village, is where king Eric XIV of Sweden was imprisoned until his death from arsenic poisoning on 26 February 1577.

==History==
Libbarbo was a farm property located south of what is now Örbyhus, dating back to the 13th century. In the 1820s Libbarbo was a large farm with a number of buildings as well as a croft for a croft soldier.

In 1874, a railway station on the new railroad which connected Stockholm with Gävle was built, and formed the nucleus of the new village Örbyhus. The politician Balzar von Platen (son of the naval officer Balzar von Platen, who constructed Göta Canal) was Count of Örbyhus Castle at the time, and he may have influenced the placement of the station.

Several factories and other industries were built in Örbyhus in the early 20th century: a steam sawmill, two bed factories, and a manufacturer of harrows and other farm equipment. Bröderna Larssons Snickeri- &amp; Skidfabrik, a ski manufacturer which also made garden furniture, kick sleds and toboggans, was built in 1905, and Örbyhus also had two textile factories in the first half of the 20th century.

<text>The Cayley–Purser algorithm was a public-key cryptography algorithm published in early 1999 by 16-year-old Irishwoman Sarah Flannery, based on an unpublished work by Michael Purser, founder of Baltimore Technologies, a Dublin data security company. Flannery named it for mathematician Arthur Cayley. It has since been found to be flawed as a public-key algorithm, but was the subject of considerable media attention.

== History ==

During a work-experience placement with Baltimore Technologies, Flannery was shown an unpublished paper by Michael Purser which outlined a new public-key cryptographic scheme using non-commutative multiplication. She was asked to write an implementation of this scheme in Mathematica.

Before this placement, Flannery had attended the 1998 ESAT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition with a project describing already existing cryptographic techniques from the Caesar cipher to RSA. This had won her the Intel Student Award which included the opportunity to compete in the 1998 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in the United States. Feeling that she needed some original work to add to her exhibition project, Flannery asked Michael Purser for permission to include work based on his cryptographic scheme.

On advice from her mathematician father, Flannery decided to use matrices to implement Purser&#x27;s scheme as matrix multiplication has the necessary property of being non-commutative. As the resulting algorithm would depend on multiplication it would be a great deal faster than the RSA algorithm which uses an exponential step. For her Intel Science Fair project Flannery prepared a demonstration where the same plaintext was enciphered using both RSA and her new Cayley–Purser algorithm and it did indeed show a significant time improvement.

Returning to the ESAT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition in 1999, Flannery formalised Cayley-Purser&#x27;s runtime and analyzed a variety of known attacks, none of which were determined to be effective.

Flannery did not make any claims that the Cayley–Purser algorithm would replace RSA, knowing that any new cryptographic system would need to stand the test of time before it could be acknowledged as a secure system. The media were not so circumspect however and when she received first prize at the ESAT exhibition, newspapers around the world reported the story that a young girl genius had revolutionised cryptography.

In fact an attack on the algorithm was discovered shortly afterwards but she analyzed it and included it as an appendix in later competitions, including a Europe-wide competition in which she won a major award.

== Overview ==

Notation used in this discussion is as in Flannery&#x27;s original paper.

=== Key generation ===

Like RSA, Cayley-Purser begins by generating two large primes &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; and their product &quot;n&quot;, a semiprime. Next, consider GL(2,&quot;n&quot;), the general linear group of 2×2 matrices with integer elements and modular arithmetic mod &quot;n&quot;. For example, if &quot;n&quot;=5, we could write:

:formula_1
:formula_2

This group is chosen because it has large order (for large semiprime &quot;n&quot;), equal to (&quot;p&quot;2−1)(&quot;p&quot;2−&quot;p&quot;)(&quot;q&quot;2−1)(&quot;q&quot;2−&quot;q&quot;).

Let formula_3 and formula_4 be two such matrices from GL(2,&quot;n&quot;) chosen such that formula_5. Choose some natural number &quot;r&quot; and compute:

:formula_6
:formula_7

The public key is formula_8, formula_4, formula_10, and formula_11. The private key is formula_3.

=== Encryption ===

The sender begins by generating a random natural number &quot;s&quot; and computing:

:formula_13
:formula_14
:formula_15

Then, to encrypt a message, each message block is encoded as a number (as in RSA) and they are placed four at a time as elements of a plaintext matrix formula_16. Each formula_16 is encrypted using:

:formula_18

Then formula_19 and formula_20 are sent to the receiver.

=== Decryption ===

The receiver recovers the original plaintext matrix formula_16 via:

:formula_22
:formula_23

== Security ==

Recovering the private key formula_3 from formula_11 is computationally infeasible, at least as hard as finding square roots mod &quot;n&quot; (see quadratic residue). It could be recovered from formula_4 and formula_10 if the system formula_28 could be solved, but the number of solutions to this system is large as long as elements in the group have a large order, which can be guaranteed for almost every element.

However, the system can be broken by finding a multiple formula_29 of formula_3 by solving for formula_31 in the following congruence:

:formula_32

Observe that a solution exists if for some formula_33 and formula_34

:formula_35

If formula_31 is known, formula_37 — a multiple of formula_3. Any multiple of formula_3 yields formula_40. This presents a fatal weakness for the system, which has not yet been reconciled.

This flaw does not preclude the algorithm&#x27;s use as a mixed private-key/public-key algorithm, if the sender transmits formula_20 secretly, but this approach presents no advantage over the common approach of transmitting a symmetric encryption key using a public-key encryption scheme and then switching to symmetric encryption, which is faster than Cayley-Purser.

<doc id="1016348" wikidata="Q92617" url="?curid=1016348" title="Paul Baran">
<text>Paul Baran (born Pesach Baran ; April 29, 1926 – March 26, 2011) was a Polish American engineer who was a pioneer in the development of computer networks. He was one of the two independent inventors of packet switching, which is today the dominant basis for data communications in computer networks worldwide, and went on to start several companies and develop other technologies that are an essential part of modern digital communication.

==Early life==
He was born in Grodno (then in the Second Polish Republic, and since 1945 part of Belarus) on April 29, 1926. He was the youngest of three children in his Lithuanian Jewish family, with the Yiddish given name &quot;Pesach&quot;. His family moved to the United States on May 11, 1928, settling in Boston and later in Philadelphia, where his father, Morris &quot;Moshe&quot; Baran (1884–1979), opened a grocery store. He graduated from Drexel University (then called Drexel Institute of Technology) in 1949, with a degree in electrical engineering. He then joined the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Company, where he did technical work on UNIVAC models, the first brand of commercial computers in the United States. In 1955 he married Evelyn Murphy, moved to Los Angeles, and worked for Hughes Aircraft on radar data processing systems. He obtained his master&#x27;s degree in engineering from UCLA in 1959, with advisor Gerald Estrin while he took night classes. His thesis was on character recognition. While Baran initially stayed on at UCLA to pursue his doctorate, a heavy travel and work schedule forced him to abandon his doctoral work.

==Packet switched network design==

After joining the RAND Corporation in 1959, Baran took on the task of designing a &quot;survivable&quot; communications system that could maintain communication between end points in the face of damage from nuclear weapons during the Cold War. Then, most American military communications used high-frequency connections, which could be put out of action for many hours by a nuclear attack. Baran decided to automate RAND Director Franklin R. Collbohm&#x27;s previous work with emergency communication over conventional AM radio networks and showed that a distributed relay node architecture could be survivable. The Rome Air Development Center soon showed that the idea was practicable.

Using the minicomputer technology of the day, Baran and his team developed a simulation suite to test basic connectivity of an array of nodes with varying degrees of linking. That is, a network of n-ary degree of connectivity would have n links per node. The simulation randomly &quot;killed&quot; nodes and subsequently tested the percentage of nodes that remained connected. The result of the simulation revealed that networks in which n ≥ 3 had a significant increase in resilience against even as much as 50% node loss. Baran&#x27;s insight gained from the simulation was that redundancy was the key. His first work was published as a RAND report in 1960, with more papers generalizing the techniques in the next two years.

After proving survivability, Baran and his team needed to show proof of concept for that design so that it could be built. That involved high-level schematics detailing the operation, construction, and cost of all the components required to construct a network that leveraged the new insight of redundant links. The result was one of the first store-and-forward data layer switching protocols, a link-state/distance vector routing protocol, and an unproved connection-oriented transport protocol. Explicit detail of the designs can be found in the complete series of reports &quot;On Distributed Communications&quot;, published by RAND in 1964.

The design flew in the face of telephony design of the time by placing inexpensive and unreliable nodes at the center of the network and more intelligent terminating &#x27;multiplexer&#x27; devices at the endpoints. In Baran&#x27;s words, unlike the telephone company&#x27;s equipment, his design did not require expensive &quot;gold plated&quot; components to be reliable. The Distributed Network that Baran introduced was intended to route around damage. It provided connection to others through many points, not one centralized connection. Fundamental to the scheme was the division of the information into &quot;blocks&quot; before they were sent out across the network. That enabled the data to travel faster and communications lines to be used more efficiently. Each block was sent separately, traveling different paths and rejoining into a whole when they were received at their destination.

===Selling the idea===
After the publication of &quot;On Distributed Communications&quot;, he presented the findings of his team to a number of audiences, including AT&amp;T engineers (not to be confused with Bell Labs engineers, who at the time provided Paul Baran with the specifications for the first generation of T1 circuit that he used as the links in his network design proposal). In subsequent interviews, Baran mentioned how the AT&amp;T engineers scoffed at his idea of non-dedicated physical circuits for voice communications, at times claiming that Baran simply did not understand how voice telecommunication worked.

Donald Davies, at the National Physical Laboratory in the United Kingdom, also thought of the same idea and implemented a trial network. While Baran used the term &quot;message blocks&quot; for his units of communication, Davies used the term &quot;packets,&quot; as it was capable of being translated into languages other than English without compromise. He applied the concept to a general-purpose computer network. Davies&#x27;s key insight came in the realization that computer network traffic was inherently &quot;bursty&quot; with periods of silence, compared with relatively-constant telephone traffic. It was in fact Davies&#x27;s work on packet switching, not Baran&#x27;s, that initially caught the attention of the developers of ARPANET at the Symposium on Operating Systems Principles in October 1967. Baran was happy to acknowledge that Davies had come up with the same idea as him independently. In an e-mail to Davies, he wrote:

Leonard Kleinrock, a contemporary working on analyzing message flow using queueing theory, developed a theoretical basis for the operation of message switching networks in his proposal for a Ph.D. thesis in 1961-2, published as a book in 1964. In the early 1970s, he applied this theory to model the performance of packet switching networks. However, the representation of Kleinrock&#x27;s early work as originating the concept of packet switching is disputed by other internet pioneers, including Robert Taylor, Baran and Davies. Baran and Davies are recognized by historians and the U.S. National Inventors Hall of Fame for independently inventing the concept of digital packet switching used in modern computer networking including the Internet.

In 1969, when the US Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) started developing the idea of an internetworked set of terminals to share computing resources, the reference materials that they considered included Baran and the RAND Corporation&#x27;s &quot;On Distributed Communications&quot; volumes. The resiliency of a packet-switched network that uses link-state routing protocols, which are used on the Internet, stems in some part from the research to develop a network that could survive a nuclear attack.

==Later work==
In 1968, Baran was a founder of the Institute for the Future and was then involved in other networking technologies developed in Silicon Valley. He wrote on the subject of computer systems and privacy. Baran participated in a review of the NBS proposal for a Data Encryption Standard in 1976, along with Martin Hellman and Whitfield Diffie of Stanford University.

In the early 1980s, Baran founded PacketCable, Inc, &quot;to support impulse-pay television channels, locally generated videotex, and packetized voice transmission.&quot; PacketCable, also known as Packet Technologies, spun off StrataCom to commercialize his packet voice technology for the telephony market. That technology led to the first commercial pre-standard Asynchronous Transfer Mode product.

He founded Telebit after conceiving its discrete multitone modem technology in the mid-1980s. It was one of the first commercial products to use orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing, which was later widely deployed in DSL modems and Wi-Fi wireless modems.

In 1985, Baran founded Metricom, the first wireless Internet company, which deployed Ricochet, the first public wireless mesh networking system. In 1992, he also founded Com21, an early cable modem company. After Com21, Baran founded and was president of GoBackTV, which specializes in personal TV and cable IPTV infrastructure equipment for television operators. Later, he founded Plaster Networks, providing an advanced solution for connecting networked devices in the home or small office through existing wiring.

Baran extended his work in packet switching to wireless-spectrum theory, developing what he called &quot;kindergarten rules&quot; for the use of wireless spectrum.

In addition to his innovation in networking products, he is also credited with inventing the first doorway gun detector.

He received an honorary doctorate when he gave the commencement speech at Drexel in 1997.

== Death ==
Baran died in Palo Alto, California, at the age of 84 on March 26, 2011 from complications caused by lung cancer. Upon his death, RAND President James Thomson, stated, &quot;Our world is a better place for the technologies Paul Baran invented and developed, and also because of his consistent concern with appropriate public policies for their use.&quot;

One of the fathers of the Internet, Vinton Cerf, stated, &quot;Paul wasn&#x27;t afraid to go in directions counter to what everyone else thought was the right or only thing to do.&quot; According to Paul Saffo, Baran also believed that innovation was a &quot;team process&quot; and avoided seeking credit for himself. On hearing news of his death, Robert Kahn, co-inventor of the Internet, said: &quot;Paul was one of the finest gentlemen I ever met and creative to the very end.&quot;

<text>Monash Medical Centre (MMC) is a teaching hospital in Melbourne, Australia. It provides specialist tertiary-level healthcare to Melbourne&#x27;s south-east.

Monash Medical Centre is part of Monash Health, the largest public health service in Victoria.

==History==
Monash Medical Centre was formed in 1987 with the amalgamation of the &quot;Queen Victoria Medical Centre&quot; (an obstetric and gynaecological hospital in central Melbourne), &quot;Prince Henry&#x27;s Hospital&quot; (a general hospital in South Melbourne) and the &quot;Moorabbin Hospital&quot; (a general hospital in Moorabbin). It was built on the site of &quot;McCulloch House&quot;, a nursing home.

==Services==
===Monash Children&#x27;s Hospital===
===Cardiology===
MonashHeart provides cardiology related services and cardiac care at the Monash Medical Centre, Clayton, and at Dandenong Hospital. MonashHeart is the busiest interventional cardiology service in the state, providing coronary angiography and coronary angioplasty services to the entire south eastern area of the state. MonashHeart is the largest non-invasive imaging service in Victoria, performing nearly 14,000 echocardiograms each year for newborns through to adults.

Acute cardiac inpatient services are provided across the network. There is a 21-bed cardiac care unit at Monash Medical Centre, Clayton, which manages a high case load of ST-elevation acute myocardial infarctions, with a daily case load of 3–4 cases not being unusual; A 12-bed cardiac care unit at Dandenong Hospital, which shares the coronary angiography and angioplasty services with Monash Medical Centre, Clayton; A 24-bed combined cardiology and cardiothoracic unit, Monash Medical Centre, Clayton which manages all the post op cardiothoracic cases, as well as other general cardiology cases.

<text>Robert Richard Boyd (October 1, 1919 – September 7, 2004) was an American first baseman in the Negro leagues and Major League Baseball.

==Career==
Nicknamed &quot;Rope&quot; for his line-drive hitting, Boyd served in the US Army during World War II, and played in the Negro leagues with the Memphis Red Sox (1947–49), and in the major leagues for the Chicago White Sox (1951, 1953–54), Baltimore Orioles (1956–60), Kansas City Athletics (1961) and Milwaukee Braves (1961).

The , Boyd threw and batted left-handed, and he could shine with his glove. He was a contact hitter, slight of frame, and did not produce the kind of home run power expected from a major league first baseman. He started his professional career in the Negro leagues with the Memphis Red Sox, and played three seasons for them between 1947 and 1949, batting .352, .369 and .371, respectively.

In 1950, Boyd became the first black player to sign with the Chicago White Sox. He made his debut on September 8, 1951. Basically a backup player and pinch-hitter with the Sox, in 1954 he was sent to the St. Louis Cardinals, but did not play for them, spending 1954 and 1955 with Houston in the Double-A Texas League and hitting .321 and .310. At the end of the 1955 season, he was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles from St. Louis in the Rule 5 draft. In 1956 with the Orioles, he hit .311 with two homers and 11 RBI in 70 games.

Boyd enjoyed a career season in 1957. Only eight batters reached the .300 mark in the American League, and he finished fourth in the batting race with a .318 average behind Ted Williams (.388), Mickey Mantle (.365) and Gene Woodling (.321), and over Nellie Fox, Minnie Miñoso, Bill Skowron and Roy Sievers. Beside this, Boyd became the first Oriole regular in the 20th century to hit over .300 in batting average. The following year, he batted .309 with a career-high seven home runs.

Boyd ended his majors career in 1961. He compiled a .293 batting average with 19 home runs and 175 RBI in 693 games. Thanks to his discipline at the plate and knowledge of the strike zone, he registered an outstanding 1.465 walk-to-strikeout ratio (167-to-114). At first base, he committed only 36 errors in 4159 chances for a .991 fielding average. Via Fangraphs, Boyd has the best hitting season in the history of professional baseball, posting a Weighted Runs Created Plus of +264. 

Bob Boyd died at age 84 in Wichita, Kansas. He is a member both of the Negro League Hall of Fame and of the National Baseball Congress Hall of Fame. His nephew Dennis &quot;Oil Can&quot; Boyd pitched for three MLB teams, most notably the Boston Red Sox, between 1982 and 1991.

<text>Starquake is an action-adventure platform game written by Stephen Crow for the ZX Spectrum and published by Bubble Bus Software in 1985. It was ported to the Commodore 64, MSX, Amstrad CPC, Atari 8-bit computers, Tatung Einstein in 1985, BBC Micro in 1987 and IBM compatibles and Atari ST in 1988.

==Plot==
The player controls BLOB (Bio-Logically Operated Being), whose mission is to penetrate the unstable core of a rogue planet which has appeared from a black hole. If the core is not repaired within the set time limit, it will implode, causing a chain reaction which will destroy the entire universe. The planet is inhabited by various primitive creatures, all hazardous to the touch, and the remnants of a previous civilisation which provides the items needed to rebuild and stabilise the planet core.

==Gameplay==

Within the game, there are multiple ways to get around:

* Running is the default.
* Hover platforms can be used to fly, but prevent BLOB from picking up items. BLOB can only mount and dismount hover platforms at docking stations.
* BLOB can build his own short-lived platforms to reach high places.
* BLOB can get through some trap like doors by creating platforms then dropping onto them after they disappear.
* There are some tube-shaped lifts which will lift BLOB upwards to the top. BLOB cannot enter these whilst on a hover platform.
* There are also teleport booths scattered around the play area, each with its own destination code.
* Secret passages allow BLOB to take short cuts from one part of the map to another. An infinite lives cheat printed by Your Sinclair inadvertently removed this ability.

BLOB is able to carry up to four items at once, using a FIFO arrangement. Some of the encountered items will be useful to repair the core, while others will need to be exchanged using a Cheops Pyramid for something more useful. There is an Access credit card, which can fill in for any of the numbered chips needed to get through security doors, and for using the aforementioned Pyramid. There is also a Key which can be used to open doors.

As well as items needed to repair the core, the Access card and Key, there are items which will top up BLOB&#x27;s energy, his platform building capacity or his firepower. There is also one cylinder like object which will top up whichever level is lowest, and even add a life if BLOB is down to his last. BLOB can also top up his lives by collecting joysticks which represent an extra life.

Points are scored for shooting the various moving hazardous creatures, worth between 80 and 320 points each, and 10,000 points per core item replaced. 250 points are scored each time BLOB enters a new screen. There are also other hazards, dangerous spikes and energy fields which will kill BLOB on contact, as will the mines that move around like the creatures.

The game features 512 screens. The placement of the objects, and the identities of those needed to fix the core are randomized at the start of the game. The map/screens including locations of teleport booths remain fixed as do their destination codes. There are nine core elements to replace in order to complete the game.

==Reception==

The ZX Spectrum version was ranked 27th in the &quot;Your Sinclair Official Top 100 Games of All Time&quot; and 10th in &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Top 25:Spectrum Games&quot;.

<doc id="1016387" wikidata="Q1071713" url="?curid=1016387" title="SC Telstar">
<text>Sportclub Telstar () is a Dutch professional association football club based in the town of Velsen-Zuid, North Holland. The team competes in the Eerste Divisie, the second tier of the Dutch football league system. The club was founded on 17 July 1963, as a merger between the professional departments of rivals VSV and Stormvogels. The new club was named &quot;Telstar&quot;, after the then recently launched communications satellite.

Telstar plays its home games at the Sportpark Schoonenberg, renamed &quot;711 Stadion&quot;, for sponsorship reasons. Since its founding in 1963, the football club has used The Tornados&#x27; song &quot;Telstar&quot; as the entrance tune for home games.

==History==
When professional football was introduced in the Netherlands, both IJVV Stormvogels and neighbouring club VSV played in the professional leagues. VSV won the KNVB Cup in 1938. Because of financial problems at both clubs, their professional teams were merged on 17 July 1963. The new club was named Telstar, after the Telstar communication satellite launched that year. Stormvogels and VSV returned to amateur football. In 2001, Telstar and Stormvogels merged again, this time forming Stormvogels Telstar. This merger was disbanded on 1 July 2008, with the professional branch continuing as Telstar.

Telstar has been a mid-table team in the Eerste Divisie, the second tier of Dutch football, in recent years. They have occasionally challenged for promotion to the Eredivisie, but have not been successful in achieving this goal.

In the 2017–18 season, Telstar finished in sixth place in the league table, their highest finish since the 1993–94 campaign, where they finished fifth. The club also made it to the quarter-finals of the KNVB Cup, where they were eliminated by Feyenoord. The following season, Telstar finished in 14th place in the league table, but once again made a strong showing in the KNVB Cup. The club advanced to the round of 16, where they were beaten 4–3 by Ajax in a thrilling match.

In the 2019–20 season, Telstar finished in tenth place in the league table. The season was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with several matches still to be played. The following season saw Telstar finishing in 13th place in the league table.

<doc id="1016391" wikidata="Q7383496" url="?curid=1016391" title="Rutland Radio">
<text>Rutland Radio was an Independent Local Radio station which served the county of Rutland and the town of Stamford in Lincolnshire. 
It broadcast on 107.2 FM in Rutland and 97.4 FM across Stamford and launched on 13 December 1998 from Knights Yard, Gaol Street in Oakham.

The station was replaced by Greatest Hits Radio in September 2020, forming part of its Midlands region.

==History==

The Lincs FM Group received a licence from the Radio Authority to broadcast to Rutland on 4 June 1998, on the same day as announcements for two Leicestershire-based licences in Loughborough and Nuneaton. Although eight stations had applied for the licences by 3 February 1998, only Rutland Radio had submitted proposals for Rutland – the other seven were for the other licences. Rutland had only recovered its independence from Leicestershire a year before the station commenced.

Rutland Radio was officially aimed at people aged between 25 and 54 and broadcast a range of songs from the 1960s to the present day, with local news bulletins through the day and frequent travel updates and local events features. Its morning presenter, Rob Persani, had been with the station since its launch; Rob Persani&#x27;s final Breakfast Show was broadcast on 28 August 2020. Rutland Radio also broadcast a farming programme at 7am on Sundays, which was produced by Lincs FM and carried on other stations in the group. The show won an Arqiva Commercial Radio Award in 2016.

The station&#x27;s local community involvement was for Oakham, Uppingham and Stamford.

In early 2010, refocussing of the Lincs FM Group&#x27;s stations led to the creation of two separate station identities. Stations were either classified as &#x27;Hits&#x27; or &#x27;Music You Love&#x27; stations. Rutland, alongside Ridings FM, transferred over to the &#x27;Music You Love&#x27; log, which had previously only been carried by Compass FM. The music subsequently skewered older with a focus on the 1960s to the 1980s and with only a handful of songs released after the year 2000 in rotation. This format was carried for a number of years until the group brought Rutland and Ridings back into the &#x27;Hits&#x27; network in late 2014, with &#x27;Hits &amp; Memories&#x27; branding returning in 2017.

Rutland Radio broadcast to Stamford &amp; Rutland from its premises in Oakham. Due to its size, there was a heavy reliance on automation from presenters across the group, but there was an average of ten hours live broadcasting from its Oakham studios every day.

===Consolidation into Greatest Hits Radio===
On 8 February 2019, the Lincs FM Group was sold to Bauer. The sale was ratified in March 2020 following an inquiry by the Competition and Markets Authority.

On 1 September 2020, Rutland Radio, along with many of the stations Bauer had newly acquired, was replaced by Greatest Hits Radio. The station&#x27;s local breakfast show was replaced by a regional drivetime show. Localised news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising were retained.

On 12 September 2023, the former Rutland Radio area was combined with the new GHR transmission on the 107.7 MHz FM frequency in Peterborough formerly occupied by Kiss 105-108 to form &quot;Greatest Hits Radio Peterborough, Stamford and Rutland&quot;, also transmitted on the Peterborough local DAB multiplex; Rutland Radio had not previously broadcast on digital radio.

An independent community radio station for the area, Rutland &amp; Stamford Sound, has been established, led by Rob Persani. The new station is governed by a community interest company.

==Awards==
In December 2009 it won the Sony Radio Academy Nations &amp; Regions Award for the East Midlands. It also won this in 2008, and this award is for stations with a TSA (total survey area) of under 300,000. Coincidentally, Rob Persani is Chairman of the East Midlands branch of the Radio Academy. The station was also nominated at the 2009 Arqiva Commercial Radio awards for station of the year (TSA &lt;300,000).

<doc id="1016394" wikidata="Q7332992" url="?curid=1016394" title="Ridings FM">
<text>Ridings FM was an Independent Local Radio station serving the Wakefield District of West Yorkshire. The station was folded into Greatest Hits Radio West Yorkshire, as part of a rebrand, on 1 September 2020.

==Studios==
The station was originally based at Thornes Office Park in Wakefield before co-locating with sister station Dearne FM at Zenith Park on Whaley Road, Barugh Green, in the north-west of Barnsley in 2009.

Following a memorandum sent to Ofcom, which stated that the station had never made a profit although being a technical success, Ridings FM was moved to Doncaster where it shared a building with Trax FM, Dearne FM and Rother FM.

==Transmission==
The station&#x27;s transmitter was located at Wakefield House in Wakefield city centre. Ridings FM broadcast on 106.8 FM on 500 watts of power. From July 2001, it was made available on the Bauer Leeds DAB multiplex. This service was discontinued in 2013, as it was a significant cost and covered areas outside of Wakefield with an uneconomically small potential audience.

==FM licence==
Prior to being awarded the Wakefield licence, the station ran a trial service which ran from 11 October 1997 on 87.7 FM.

By the closing date of 8 September 1998, WF 107 Ltd (based in Wakefield), Henna FM Ltd (based in Batley providing Asian music) and Ridings FM had applied to the Radio Authority for the licence. Ridings FM was later awarded the licence on 7 January 1999.

==Programming==
The station&#x27;s output included a weekday breakfast show. The station&#x27;s news team won a Sony Bronze award in May 2000. At off peak times the station used the feed from Independent Radio News. As well as news, Ridings FM covered local sports teams from the Wakefield Trinity, Castleford Tigers and Featherstone Rovers in rugby league, to Ossett United (amalgamation of Ossett Albion and Ossett Town) and Frickley Athletic in football.

==Presenters==

During Ridings FM&#x27;s lifetime, presenters included:

* Phil Butler
* Gareth Webb
* Paul Bromley
* John Tolson
* Jamie Fletcher
* Chris Hubbard
* Kev Wilson
* Andy Hoyle

<text>Heart Yorkshire (previously Real Radio Yorkshire) is a regional radio station owned by Communicorp UK and operated by Global as part of the Heart network. It broadcasts to South and West Yorkshire.

==Overview==
===Real Radio===
Real Radio Yorkshire launched on 25 March 2002. The station transmitted from Emley Moor on 106.2 MHz FM, which covers the majority of South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire, including Barnsley, York, Selby, Harrogate, Doncaster, Huddersfield, Leeds, Rotherham and Wakefield. It also broadcast from Idle on 107.6 MHz FM to Bradford and Halifax, and on 107.7 MHz FM from Tapton Hill to Sheffield. Real Radio Yorkshire also broadcast across the whole of Yorkshire on DAB using the Regional MXR multiplex.

===Heart===
On 25 June 2012 it was announced Global (the owner of stations such as Capital and Heart) had bought GMG Radio. The former GMG stations, including Real Radio, continued to operate separately as &#x27;Real and Smooth Limited&#x27; until 1 April 2014.

On 6 February 2014, Global announced it would be rebranding all Real Radio stations as Heart. On 1 May 2014, local programming moved from Tingley, Wakefield to share facilities with sister station Capital Yorkshire in Hanover Walk, Leeds.

The full relaunch as Heart Yorkshire took place on Tuesday 6 May 2014. The station&#x27;s audience share increased from 5.5% to over 7% following the relaunch. In June 2015 the Yorkshire MXR multiplex closed. Heart Yorkshire moved their services to local multiplexes in Leeds, Bradford and Sheffield, however they chose not to take up options in Hull and York.

In February 2019, following OFCOM&#x27;s decision to relax local content obligations from commercial radio, Global announced it would replace Heart Yorkshire&#x27;s local breakfast and weekend shows with networked programming from London.

From 3 June 2019, the station&#x27;s local output consisted of a three-hour Drivetime show on weekdays hosted by Dixie &amp; Emma, alongside local news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising.

As of 24 February 2025 all programming originates from Global&#x27;s London headquarters, including &quot;Heart Drive&quot;, presented each weekday by JK and Kelly Brook.

==News==
Journalists within Yorkshire produce hourly regional news bulletins from 6 am–7 pm on weekdays and 6 am–12 pm at weekends.
