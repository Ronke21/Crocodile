<text>The Norwegian Academy for Language and Literature (), commonly known as the Norwegian Academy, is a Norwegian learned body on matters pertaining to the modern Norwegian language in its Dano-Norwegian variety, now commonly known as Riksmål and Bokmål. The academy was established in the Norwegian government&#x27;s honorary residence Grotten in 1953 based on the model of the Swedish Academy and the French Academy, but the idea was originally conceived by Bjørn Bjørnson in 1913. Its members are elected for life on the basis of scholarly, literary or artistic merits. The academy publishes the main dictionary of Norwegian, &quot;Det Norske Akademis ordbok&quot; (&quot;Dictionary of the Norwegian Academy&quot;, www.naob.no), is responsible for regulating the written standard known as Riksmål (&quot;National Language&quot;) and has a literary and cultural purpose. The academy awards the Norwegian Academy Prize in memory of Thorleif Dahl.

==History==

The academy was founded in 1953 by several notable Norwegian authors and poets, among them Arnulf Øverland, Sigurd Hoel, A.H. Winsnes, Cora Sandel and Francis Bull. They disagreed with the official language policy aiming to merge &quot;Bokmål&quot; with &quot;Nynorsk&quot; and protested against what they called state discrimination against the dominant Norwegian written standard &quot;Riksmål&quot;. This was Norway&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; written language, used by most large newspapers and by the majority of the population as a written standard (although not necessarily a spoken one). The Academy was modelled after the Swedish Academy and the French Academy.

In addition to regulating Riksmål, the most conservative and Danish-near form of Norwegian, the academy publishes dictionaries and supports the publishing of literature in Riksmål. To-day, after several reforms worth in the official Bokmål and in the traditional Riksmål, Bokmål in its &quot;moderate&quot; version and modern Riksmål more or less coincide with some deviations.

The Academy has 51 members (2021), each of whom is a specialist in miscellaneous areas of analysis, investigation and expertise. These include Nordic studies, German, English and French languages and literature, history, philosophy, law, political science, poetry et cetera. The President of the Academy is John Ole Askedal.

The Norwegian Academy for Language and Literature was represented, along with other non-governmental language organisations, in the Norwegian Language Council, which regulates the official &quot;Bokmål&quot; and &quot;Nynorsk&quot; languages, since its establishment in 1972 until it was reorganized in 2005.

In 1981, the Academy merged with Riksmålsvernet, founded in 1919.

<text>Sinclair Research Ltd is a British consumer electronics company founded by Clive Sinclair in Cambridge in the 1970s. In 1980, the company entered the home computer market with the ZX80 at £99.95, at that time the cheapest personal computer for sale in the United Kingdom. A year later, the ZX81 became available through retailers, introducing home computing to a generation, with more that 1.5 million sold. In 1982 the ZX Spectrum was released, becoming the UK&#x27;s best selling computer, and competing aggressively against Commodore and Amstrad.

A combination of the failures of the Sinclair QL computer and the TV80 pocket television led to financial difficulties in 1985, and a year later Sinclair sold the rights to its computer products and brand name to Amstrad. Sinclair Research Ltd continued to exist as a one-man company, marketing Clive Sinclair&#x27;s inventions.

== History ==
=== Founding and early years ===
On 25 July 1961, Clive Sinclair founded his first company, Sinclair Radionics Ltd. in Cambridge. The company developed hi-fi products, radios, calculators and scientific instruments. When it became clear that Radionics was failing, Sinclair took steps to ensure that he would be able to continue to pursue his commercial goals. In February 1975, he changed the name of Ablesdeal Ltd (a shelf company he had bought in September 1973 for just such an eventuality) to Westminster Mail Order Ltd. The name was changed to Sinclair Instrument Ltd in August 1975.

Finding it inconvenient to share control after the National Enterprise Board became involved in Radionics in 1976, Sinclair encouraged Chris Curry to leave Radionics, which he had worked for since 1966, and get Sinclair Instrument operational. The company&#x27;s first product was a watch-like Wrist Calculator.

=== Calculators ===
The Sinclair Executive was introduced in 1972 as the first calculator which could easily be carried in a pocket. It was also significantly cheaper than similarly featured 4-function calculators available at the time. The Sinclair Cambridge was launched in 1973 as a basic calculator and later in several enhanced versions supporting memory, advanced mathematical functions, and programmability. The Sinclair Scientific featuring trigonometric and logarithmic functions and employing Reverse Polish Notation was introduced in 1974.

=== Development of the ZX80 ===
In July 1977, Sinclair Instrument Ltd was renamed Science of Cambridge Ltd. Around the same time, Ian Williamson showed Chris Curry a prototype microcomputer based on a National Semiconductor SC/MP microprocessor and parts from a Sinclair calculator. Curry was impressed and encouraged Sinclair to adopt it as a product. In June 1978, Science of Cambridge launched its MK14 microcomputer in kit form.

In May 1979, Jim Westwood, Sinclair&#x27;s chief engineer, designed a new microcomputer based on the Zilog Z80 microprocessor. Sinclair Instrument Ltd introduced the computer as the ZX80 in February 1980, as both a kit and ready-built.

In November 1979, Science of Cambridge Ltd was renamed Sinclair Computers Ltd.

=== Commercial success and home computers ===
In March 1981, Sinclair Computers was renamed Sinclair Research Ltd and the Sinclair ZX81 was launched. In February 1982, Timex Corporation obtained a license to manufacture and market Sinclair&#x27;s computers in the USA under the name Timex Sinclair. In April the ZX Spectrum was launched. In July Timex launched the TS 1000 (a version of the ZX81) in the United States. In March 1982 Sinclair Research Ltd made an £8.55m profit on turnover of £27.17m, including a £383,000 government grant to develop a flat screen.

In 1982 Clive Sinclair converted the Barker &amp; Wadsworth mineral water bottling factory at 25 Willis Road, Cambridge, into the company&#x27;s new headquarters. (Following Sinclair&#x27;s financial troubles, the premises were sold to Cambridgeshire County Council in December 1985.)

In January 1983 the ZX Spectrum personal computer was presented at the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show. In September the Sinclair TV80 pocket television was launched, but was a commercial failure.

In 1983 the company bought Milton Hall in the village of Milton, Cambridgeshire, for £2m, establishing its &quot;MetaLab&quot; research and development facility there.

In late 1983 Timex decided to pull out of the Timex Sinclair venture which, due to strong competition, had failed to break into the United States market. However, Timex computers continued to be produced for several years in other countries. Timex Portugal launched improved versions, the TS 2048 and 2068; that company also developed and launched the FDD3000, a floppy disk system, although it was not well received by the market.

=== Mid-1980s developments ===
The Sinclair QL was announced on 12 January 1984, shortly before the Apple Macintosh went on sale. The QL was nowhere near as successful as Sinclair&#x27;s earlier computers. It suffered from several design flaws,&lt;ref name=&quot;QL News / SinclairWatch&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; noted that it was &quot;difficult to find a good word for Sinclair Research in the computer press&quot;.

Fully working QLs were not available until late summer and complaints against Sinclair regarding delays were upheld by the Advertising Standards Authority in May of that year. (In 1982 it had upheld complaints about delays in shipping Spectrums.) Especially severe were allegations that Sinclair was cashing cheques months before machines were shipped. In the autumn Sinclair was still publicly predicting it would be a &quot;million seller&quot;, and that 250,000 would be sold by the end of the year. QL production was suspended in February 1985, and the price was halved by the end of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Timex/Sinclair history&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The ZX Spectrum+, a repackaged ZX Spectrum with a QL-like keyboard, was launched in October 1984 and appeared in WHSmith&#x27;s shops the day after release. Retailers stocked the machine in large numbers in expectation of good Christmas sales. However, the machine did not sell as well as expected and, because retailers still had unsold stock, Sinclair&#x27;s income from orders dipped alarmingly in January. The Spectrum+ had the same technical specifications as the original Spectrum. An enhanced model, the ZX Spectrum 128, was launched in Spain in September 1985, with development funded by the Spanish distributor Investronica. The UK launch of this was delayed until January 1986, because retailers had large unsold stocks of the previous model.

At the January 1985 Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show, Sinclair re-entered the United States market, announcing the &quot;FM Wristwatch Radio&quot;, an LCD wristwatch with a radio attached. However, the watch had several problems and never went into full production.

Sinclair had long had an interest in electric vehicles, and during the early 1980s he worked on the design of a single-seater &quot;personal vehicle&quot;, eventually starting a company called Sinclair Vehicles Ltd in March 1983. He launched the Sinclair C5 electric vehicle on 10 January 1985, but it was a commercial disaster, selling only 17,000 units and losing Sinclair £7,000,000. Sinclair Vehicles went into liquidation later the same year. The failure of the C5, combined with those of the QL and the TV80, caused investors to lose confidence in Sinclair&#x27;s judgement.


=== Amstrad acquisition of assets ===
Sinclair Research had reportedly intended a public offering of shares on 12 March 1985, but this offering was postponed, ostensibly due to turmoil in the microcomputer industry, with Acorn Computers undergoing refinancing, and other companies such as Sinclair&#x27;s competitor Oric and distributor Prism entering receivership. Although the collapse of the latter was not expected to have a significant effect on Sinclair&#x27;s ability to reach customers, the observation was made that &quot;Sir Clive would not be trying to go public unless he thought he could use the cash&quot;, indicating that the postponement of an offering whose timing would have been planned for optimal effect would be a setback for the company.

On 28 May 1985, Sinclair Research had announced it wanted to raise an extra £10m to £15m to restructure the organisation. Given the loss of confidence in the company, the money proved hard to find. In June 1985, business magnate Robert Maxwell announced a takeover of Sinclair Research, through Hollis Brothers, a subsidiary of his Pergamon Press. However, the deal was aborted in August 1985.

The future of Sinclair Research remained uncertain until 7 April 1986, when the company sold its entire computer product range, and the &quot;Sinclair&quot; brand name, to Amstrad for £5 million. The deal did not include the company itself, only its name and products.

===Spin-offs===
Sinclair Research was reduced to an R&amp;D business and a holding company, with shareholdings in several new &quot;spin-off&quot; companies formed to exploit technologies developed by the main company. These included Anamartic Ltd (wafer-scale integration), Shaye Communications Ltd (CT2 mobile telephony) and Cambridge Computer Ltd (Z88 portable computer and satellite television receivers).

=== Return to invention ===
Since 1986, the company has continued to exist, but in a completely different form. In 1993, 1994, and 1995 Sinclair made continuing losses on decreasing turnover. Investors became worried that Clive Sinclair himself was using his own personal wealth to fund his inventions. By 1990 the company&#x27;s entire staff had been reduced to just Sinclair himself, a salesman/administrator, and an R&amp;D employee. By 1997 only Sinclair himself was working at his company.

In 1992, the &quot;Zike&quot; electric bicycle was released, Sinclair&#x27;s second attempt at changing people&#x27;s means of transport. It had a maximum speed of , and was only available by mail order. Much like the C5, the &quot;Zike&quot; was a commercial failure, and sold only 2,000 units. In 1999 Sinclair released the world&#x27;s smallest radio, in the form of the &quot;Z1 Micro AM Radio&quot;.

In 2003, the Sinclair &quot;ZA20 Wheelchair Drive Unit&quot; was introduced, designed and manufactured in conjunction with Hong Kong&#x27;s Daka Designs, a partnership which also led to the SeaDoo Sea Scooter underwater propulsion unit.

July 2006 saw the release of the A-bike, a folding bicycle invented by Sinclair, which was on sale for £200. It had been originally announced two years previously. In November 2010, Sinclair Research announced the X-1 two-wheel electric vehicle, which failed to reach production.

== Products ==
;Wrist Calculator
The Wrist Calculator was released by Sinclair Instrument in 1977.

;Multimeter DM2
A digital multimeter with an LED display, measuring voltage (DC and AC), current and resistance, released in 1975.

;MK14
The MK14 (Microcomputer Kit 14) was a computer kit sold by Science of Cambridge, introduced in 1977 for £39.95.

;ZX80
The ZX80 home computer was launched in February 1980 at £79.95 in kit form and £99.95 ready-built. In November of the same year Science of Cambridge was renamed Sinclair Computers Ltd.

;ZX81
The ZX81 (known as the TS 1000 in the United States) was priced at £49.95 in kit form and £69.95 ready-built, by mail order.

;ZX Spectrum
The ZX Spectrum was launched on 23 April 1982, priced at £125 for the 16 KB RAM version and £175 for the 48 KB version.

;TV80
The TV80 was a pocket television. Launched in September 1983, it used a flattened CRT unlike Sinclair&#x27;s previous portable televisions. The TV80 was a commercial failure selling only 15,000 units and not covering its development costs of £4m.

;Sinclair QL
The Sinclair QL was announced in January 1984, priced at £399. Marketed as a more sophisticated 32-bit microcomputer for professional users, it used a Motorola 68008 processor. Production was delayed by several months, due to unfinished development of hardware and software at the time of the QL&#x27;s launch. Hardware reliability problems and software bugs resulted in the QL acquiring a poor reputation from which it never recovered.

;ZX Spectrum+
The ZX Spectrum+ was a repackaged ZX Spectrum 48K, launched in October 1984.

;ZX Spectrum 128
The ZX Spectrum 128, with RAM expanded to 128 kB, a sound chip and other enhancements, was launched in Spain in September 1985 and the UK in January 1986, priced at £179.95.

;Computer peripherals
Sinclair created various peripherals for its computers, including memory expansion modules, the ZX Printer, and the ZX Interface 1 and ZX Interface 2 add-ons for the ZX Spectrum. A number of QL peripherals were developed by other companies but marketed under the Sinclair brand. External storage for the Spectrum was usually on cassette tapes, as was common in that era. Rather than an optional floppy disk drive, Sinclair instead opted to offer its own mass storage system, the ZX Microdrive, a tape-loop cartridge system that proved unreliable. This was also the primary storage device for the QL.

;X1 Button FM Radio
In June 1997 Sinclair Research released the X1 radio for £9.50. This miniature mono FM radio, powered by a CR2032 battery, had a fixed volume and was inserted in the ear. The X1 radio had three buttons, an on/off switch, a &quot;Scan&quot; button, and a &quot;Reset&quot; button to restart the scanning process. It came with a short length of aerial and a detachable ear hook.

=== Cancelled projects ===
The following computer products were under development at Sinclair Research during the 1980s but never reached production:

;LC3
Standing for &quot;Low Cost Colour Computer&quot;, the &quot;LC3&quot; was developed during 1983 by Martin Brennan and was intended to be a cheap Z80-based games console implemented in two chips, using ROM and (non-volatile) RAM cartridges for storage. A multi-tasking operating system for the &quot;LC3&quot;, with a full windowing GUI, was designed by Steve Berry. It was cancelled in November 1983 in favour of the QL.
;SuperSpectrum
Intended to be a 68008-based home computer, equipped with built-in ZX Microdrive, joystick, RS-232 and ZX Net ports. Sinclair&#x27;s SuperBASIC programming language was originally intended for this model but was later adopted for the QL. &quot;SuperSpectrum&quot; was cancelled in 1982 after the specification of the &quot;ZX83&quot; (QL) had converged with it. This project is not to be confused with &quot;Loki&quot;, which was described as the &quot;SuperSpectrum&quot; in an article in the June 1986 issue of &quot;Sinclair User&quot; magazine.
;Pandora
This was to be a portable computer with an integral flat-screen CRT display. Initially to be ZX Spectrum-compatible with a faster Z80 CPU, a built-in ZX Microdrive and a new 512×192-pixel monochrome video mode. Due to the limited size of flat CRT that could be manufactured, a series of folding lenses and mirrors were necessary to magnify the screen image to a usable size. The project was cancelled after the Amstrad take-over, but the &quot;Pandora&quot; concept eventually transformed into the Cambridge Computer Z88.
;Loki
This project was intended to create a greatly enhanced ZX Spectrum, possibly rivalling the Commodore Amiga. &quot;Loki&quot; was to have a 7 MHz Z80H CPU, 128 KiB of RAM, and two custom chips providing much enhanced graphics and audio capabilities. After the Amstrad buy-out in 1986, two engineers who had worked on the project, John Mathieson and Martin Brennan, founded Flare Technology to continue their work.
;Bob/Florin
According to Rupert Goodwins, this was a project to produce an add-on floppy disk drive for the ZX Spectrum.
;Tyche
This codename was assigned to a QL follow-on project running from 1984 to 1986. Among the features associated with &quot;Tyche&quot; were increased RAM capacity, internal floppy disk drives, the Psion &quot;Xchange&quot; application suite on ROM, and possibly the GEM GUI.
;Janus
This name has been associated with a design concept for a &quot;Super QL&quot; based on wafer-scale integration technology.
;Proteus
This was rumoured to be a hypothetical portable version of the QL similar to &quot;Pandora&quot;.

;Sinclair X-1
In November 2010 Sinclair told &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper that he was working on a new prototype electric vehicle, called the X-1, to be launched within a year. &quot;Technology has moved on quite a bit, there are new batteries available and I just rethought the thing. The C5 was OK, but I think we can do a better job now.&quot; The two-wheel X-1 was to have been available in July 2011 at the price of £595, but failed to reach production.

<doc id="1024000" wikidata="Q14689769" url="?curid=1024000" title="Marais des Cygnes National Wildlife Refuge">
<text>Marais des Cygnes National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) is located in Linn County, Kansas along the Marais des Cygnes River. The 7,500 acre (30 km2) Refuge was established in 1992 to protect one of the northwesternmost examples of bottomland hardwood forest in the United States as well as the largest contiguous tract of bottomland hardwood forest in Kansas.

&quot;Marais des Cygnes&quot; means &quot;marsh of swans&quot; in French.

High quality stands of bottomland hardwood forest, upland oak-hickory forest, tallgrass prairie, seasonal and permanent wetlands, and riverine areas are found throughout the refuge. These unique areas harbor many species that are considered nationally or regionally threatened such as cerulean warbler, broadhead skink, flat floater mussel (&quot;Anodonta suborbiculata&quot;), and Mead&#x27;s milkweed.

More than 30 species of warblers migrate through or nest on the refuge. The refuge also is known to harbor 30 species of mussels. Other interesting species are raccoons, badgers, minks, coyotes, skunks, beavers, muskrats, river otters, two species of fox, bobcats, paddlefish, crawfish frogs, scissor-tailed flycatchers, loggerhead shrike, and red-shouldered hawks. The refuge provides a rare opportunity to view high quality examples of a number of uncommon plant and animal communities all within a short distance of each other. Some of these communities are rare throughout North America, including bottomland hardwood forest, which has been reduced by 80% nationally, and tallgrass prairie, which has been reduced by 99% nationally.

==Recreational opportunities==

*Boating
*Fishing
*Hiking
*Hunting

==Directions==
Marais des Cygnes NWR is located 39 miles (63 km) south of the Kansas City metropolitan area along U.S. Highway 69. At the intersection of U.S. Highway 69 and Kansas Highway 52, travel east 1 mile (2 km). The refuge office is located on the south side of Kansas Highway 52.

<doc id="1024001" wikidata="Q7758637" url="?curid=1024001" title="The Proverbs of Alfred">
<text>The Proverbs of Alfred is a collection of early Middle English sayings ascribed to King Alfred the Great (called &quot;England&#x27;s darling&quot;), said to have been uttered at an assembly in Seaford, East Sussex. The collection of proverbs was probably put together in Sussex in the mid-12th century. The manuscript evidence suggests the text originated at either a Cluniac or a Benedictine monastery: either Lewes Priory, to the north of Seaford, or Battle Abbey, to the north-east.

==Transmission==
The &quot;Proverbs of Alfred&quot; survive in four manuscripts of the 13th century:

*Cotton Galba A. xix (MS C)
*Maidstone Museum A.13 (MS M)
*Cambridge, Trinity College, B.14.39 (MS T)
*Oxford, Jesus College, 29 (MS J)

The text appears to have been produced in the late 12th century. There is no reason to suppose that any of the proverbs go back to King Alfred. King Alfred, who translated several works into the vernacular, is not known to have translated or composed proverbs. However, his legendary status in later tradition gave him a reputation for having done so, as the Middle English poem &quot;The Owl and the Nightingale&quot; likewise suggests. Some of the proverbs in the &quot;Proverbs of Alfred&quot; appear elsewhere under another name (&quot;Hendyng&quot;, which may itself be less of a proper name than an adjective).

==Form and contents==
The proverbs are in alliterative verse, but the verse does not adhere to the rules of classical Old English poetry. Caesurae are present in every line, but the lines are broken in two (cf. &quot;Pearl&quot;). The collection shows signs of transition in verse form from the earlier Anglo-Saxon alliterative form to the new Norman rhyme form, for rhyme occasionally occurs in the poetry. Late in the poem, the verse even picks up Norman metre and something like a couplet form. At the same time, the proverbs resemble the gnomic compositions of earlier Anglo-Saxon instruction. The proverbs are expressed as highly compressed metaphors that are halfway to the poetry found in the Anglo-Saxon riddle and &quot;Gnomic Verses.&quot; Collections of sayings and precepts were common in Latin as well, but the distinctive compression of the Alfredian proverbs is clearly a sign of their Anglo-Saxon origin.

Given that it is most likely that the author and his antecedents gathered up proverbs over time, the heterogeneous contents of the book are predictable. The proverbs contain popular wisdom, religious instruction, and advice on the wickedness of women. The latter is most likely a scribal interpolation.

==Sample==
An example of the &quot;Proverbs&quot; is lines 423–448, here in the translation of Christopher Cannon.

<text>Homebuilt aircraft, also known as amateur-built aircraft or kit planes, are constructed by persons for whom this is not a professional activity. These aircraft may be constructed from &quot;scratch&quot;, from plans, or from assembly kits.

==Overview==
In the United States, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, homebuilt aircraft may be licensed Experimental under FAA or similar local regulations. With some limitations, the builder(s) of the aircraft must have done it for their own education and recreation rather than for profit. In the U.S., the primary builder can also apply for a repairman&#x27;s certificate for that airframe. The repairman&#x27;s certificate allows the holder to perform and sign off on most of the maintenance, repairs, and inspections themselves.

Alberto Santos-Dumont was the first to offer for free construction plans, publishing drawings of his Demoiselle in the June 1910 edition of Popular Mechanics. The first aircraft to be offered for sale as plans, rather than a completed airframe, was the Baby Ace in the late 1920s.


Homebuilt aircraft gained in popularity in the U.S. in 1924 with the start of the National Air Races, held in Dayton, Ohio. These races required aircraft with useful loads of and engines of 80 cubic inches or less and as a consequence of the class limitations most were amateur-built. The years after Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s transatlantic flight brought a peak of interest between 1929 and 1933. During this period many aircraft designers, builders and pilots were self-taught and the high accident rate brought public condemnation and increasing regulation to amateur building. The resulting federal standards on design, engineering, stress analysis, use of aircraft-quality hardware and testing of aircraft brought an end to amateur building except in some specialized areas, such as racing. In 1946 Goodyear restarted the National Air Races, including a class for aircraft powered by 200 cubic inch and smaller engines. The midget racer class spread nationally in the U.S. and this led to calls for acceptable standards to allow recreational use of amateur-built aircraft. By the mid-1950s both the U.S. and Canada once again allowed amateur-built aircraft to specified standards and limitations.

Homebuilt aircraft are generally small, one to four-seat sportsplanes which employ simple methods of construction. Fabric-covered wood or metal frames and plywood are common in the aircraft structure, but increasingly, fiberglass and other composites as well as full aluminum construction techniques are being used, techniques first pioneered by Hugo Junkers as far back as the late World War I era. Engines are most often the same as, or similar to, the engines used in certified aircraft (such as Lycoming, Continental, Rotax, and Jabiru). A minority of homebuilts use converted automobile engines, with Volkswagen air-cooled flat-4s, Subaru-based liquid-cooled engines, Mazda Wankel and Chevrolet Corvair six-cylinder engines being most common. The use of automotive engines helps to reduce costs, but many builders prefer dedicated aircraft engines, which are perceived to have better performance and reliability. Other engines that have been used include chainsaw and motorcycle engines.

A combination of cost and litigation, especially in the mid-1980s era, discouraged general aviation manufacturers from introducing new designs and led to homebuilts outselling factory built aircraft by five to one.

== History ==
The history of amateur-built aircraft can be traced to the beginning of aviation. Even if the Wright brothers, Clément Ader, and their successors had commercial objectives in mind, the first aircraft were constructed by passionate enthusiasts whose goal was to fly.

=== Early years ===
Aviation took a leap forward with the industrialization that accompanied World War I. In the post-war period, manufacturers needed to find new markets and introduced models designed for tourism. However, these machines were affordable only by the very rich.

Many U.S. aircraft designed and registered in the 1920s onward were considered &quot;experimental&quot; by the (then) CAA, the same registration under which modern homebuilts are issued Special Airworthiness Certificates. Many of these were prototypes, but designs such as Bernard Pietenpol&#x27;s first 1923 design were some of the first homebuilt aircraft. In 1928, Henri Mignet published plans for his HM-8 &quot;Pou-du-Ciel&quot;, as did Pietenpol for his Air Camper. Pietenpol later constructed a factory, and in 1933 began creating and selling partially constructed aircraft kits.

In 1936, an association of amateur aviation enthusiasts was created in France. Many types of amateur aircraft began to make an appearance, and in 1938 legislation was amended to provide for a &quot;Certificat de navigabilité restreint d&#x27;aéronef&quot; (&quot;CNRA&quot;, &quot;restricted operating certificate for aircraft&quot;). 1946 saw the birth of the Ultralight Aircraft Association which in 1952 became the Popular Flying Association in the United Kingdom, followed in 1953 by the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) in the United States and the Sport Aircraft Association in Australia.

The term &quot;homebuilding&quot; became popular in the mid-1950s when EAA founder Paul Poberezny wrote a series of articles for the magazine &quot;Mechanix Illustrated&quot; where he explained how a person could buy a set of plans and build their own aircraft at home. In 1955, Poberezny co-founded, with Robert D. Blacker, EAA&#x27;s first youth outreach program, Project Schoolflight, which brought &quot;homebuilding&quot; into high school industrial arts classes throughout the US. Poberezny&#x27;s Mechanix Illustrated articles gained worldwide acclaim and the concept of aircraft homebuilding took off.

=== Technology and innovation ===

Until the late 1950s, builders had mainly kept to wood-and-cloth and steel tube-and-cloth design. Without the regulatory restrictions faced by production aircraft manufacturers, homebuilders introduced innovative designs and construction techniques. Burt Rutan introduced the canard design to the homebuilding world and pioneered the use of composite construction. Metal construction in kitplanes was taken to a new level by Richard VanGrunsven in his RV series. As the sophistication of the kits improved, components such as autopilots and more advanced navigation instruments became common.

Litigation during the 1970s and 1980s caused stagnation in the small aircraft market, forcing the surviving companies to retain older, proven designs. In recent years, the less restrictive regulations for homebuilts allowed a number of manufacturers to develop new and innovative designs; many can outperform certified production aircraft in their class.

An example of high-end homebuilt design is Lancair, which has developed a number of high-performance kits. The most powerful is the Lancair Propjet, a four-place kit with cabin pressurization and a turboprop engine, cruising at and 370 knots (425 mph, 685 km/h). Although aircraft such as this are considered &quot;home-built&quot; for legal reasons, they are typically built in the factory with the assistance of the buyer. This allows the company which sells the kit to avoid the long and expensive process of certification, because they remain owner-built according to the regulations. One of the terms applied to this concept is commonly referred to as &quot;The 51% Rule&quot;, which requires that builders perform the majority of the fabrication and assembly to be issued a Certificate of Airworthiness as an Amateur Built aircraft.

A small number of jet kitplanes have been built since the 1970s, including the tiny Bede Aircraft BD-5J.

===Future trends===
Van&#x27;s Aircraft and Aircraft Kit Industry Association (AKIA) President Dick VanGrunsven was asked about the future of the kit aircraft industry in a wide-ranging interview in KitPlanes magazine in December 2012:

== Building materials ==
Homebuilt aircraft can be constructed out of any material that is light and strong enough for flight. Several common construction methods are detailed below.

=== Wood and fabric ===
This is the oldest construction, seen in the first aircraft and hence the best known. For that reason, amateur-built aircraft associations will have more specialists for this type of craft than other kinds.

The most commonly used woods are Sitka spruce and Douglas fir, which offer excellent strength-to-weight ratios. Wooden structural members are joined with adhesive, usually epoxy. Unlike the wood construction techniques used in other applications, virtually all wooden joints in aircraft are simple butt joints, with plywood gussets. Joints are designed to be stronger than the members. After the structure has been completed, the aircraft is covered in aircraft fabric (usually aircraft-grade polyester). The advantage of this type of construction is that it does not require complex tools and equipment, instead employing commonplace items such as saw, planer, file, sandpaper, and clamps.

Examples of amateur-built wood and fabric designs include:

* The classic Pietenpol Air Camper, a homebuilt that has been built since the 1920s
* The Bowers Fly Baby, a low-wing monoplane which has been popular since the 1960s
* The Ison miniMAX

=== Wood/composite mixture ===
A recent trend is toward wood-composite aircraft. The basic load carrying material is still wood, but it is combined with foam (for instance, to increase buckling resistance of load carrying plywood skins) and other synthetic materials like fiberglass and carbon fiber (to locally increase the modulus of load carrying structures such as spar caps).

Examples of wood-composite designs include:

*Ibis experimental aircraft project, designed by Roger Junqua
*KR series of homebuilts designed by Ken Rand
*PIK-26 designed by Kai Mellen
=== Metal ===
Planes built from metal use similar techniques to more conventional factory-built aircraft. They can be more challenging to build, requiring metal-cutting, metal-shaping, and riveting if building from plans. &quot;Quick-build&quot; kits are available which have the cutting, shaping, and hole-drilling mostly done, requiring only finishing and assembly. Such kits are also available for the other types of aircraft construction, especially composite.

There are three main types of metal construction: sheet aluminum, tube aluminum, and welded steel tube. The tube structures are covered in aircraft fabric, much like wooden aircraft.

Examples of metal-based amateur aircraft include:

* The Murphy Moose, Rebel, Super Rebel and Maverick, produced by Murphy Aircraft
* The Vans RV-4, RV-8, RV-10 and other models produced by Van&#x27;s Aircraft, are the most popular metal homebuilt aircraft
* Chris Heintz&#x27;s Zenith CH601 Zodiac and Zenith STOL CH701 family of two-seat kit planes
* The ARV Super2 has conventional wings, fuselage, and empennage, but the cockpit is a monococque of &quot;Supral&quot; superplastic alloy

=== Composite ===

Composite material structures are made of cloth with a high tensile strength (usually fiberglass or carbon fiber, or occasionally Kevlar) combined with a structural plastic (usually epoxy, although vinylester is used in some aircraft). The fabric is saturated with the structural plastic in a liquid form; when the plastic cures and hardens, the part will hold its shape while possessing the strength characteristics of the fabric.

The two primary types of composite planes are moulded composite, where major structures like wing skins and fuselage halves are prepared and cured in moulds, and mouldless, where shapes are carved out of foam and then covered with fiberglass or carbon fiber.

The advantages of this type of construction include smooth surfaces (without the drag of rivets), the ability to construct compound curves, and the ability to place fiberglass or carbon fiber in optimal positions, orientations, and quantities. Drawbacks include the need to work with chemical products as well as low strength in directions perpendicular to fiber. Composites provide superb strength to their weight. Material stiffness dependent upon direction (as opposed to equal in all directions, as with metals) allows for advanced &quot;elastic tailoring&quot; of composite parts.

Examples of amateur craft made of composite materials include:

* Canard designs such as the VariEze and Long EZ designed by Burt Rutan
* The pusher propeller Cirrus VK-30 designed by Jeff Viken and the Klapmeier brothers 
* The Europa XS family of British two-place monoplanes designed by Ivan Shaw
* The Glasair I, II and III series of high-performance homebuilts designed by Tom Hamilton

==Safety==
The safety record of homebuilts is not as good as certified general aviation aircraft. In the United States, in 2003, amateur-built aircraft experienced a rate of 21.6 accidents per 100,000 flight hours; the overall general aviation accident rate for that year was 6.75 per 100,000 flight hours.

The accident rate for homebuilt aircraft in the U.S. has long been a concern to the Federal Aviation Administration. At Sun &#x27;n Fun 2010, FAA administrator Randy Babbitt said that homebuilts &quot;account for 10 percent of the GA fleet, but 27 percent of accidents. It&#x27;s not the builders [getting into accidents], but the second owners. We need better transition training.&quot; In the US, flight instruction, including primary flight training, can be received in the owner&#x27;s homebuilt aircraft from any instructor willing to provide such training.

A study released in 2012 by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board concluded that homebuilt aircraft in the U.S. have an accident rate 3–4 times higher than the rest of the general aviation fleet. Almost 10% of accidents involving homebuilt aircraft occurred on the craft&#x27;s first flight. A further 9% of accidents occurred on their first flight after being sold, due to the new owner&#x27;s unfamiliarity with the craft. The study also identified that powerplant failures and loss of control in-flight accidents were much higher than the same rates for certified aircraft.

Most nations&#x27; aviation regulations require amateur-built aircraft to be physically marked as such (for example in the U.K. &quot;Occupant Warning – This aircraft ... is amateur built.&quot; must be displayed), and extra flight testing is usually required before passengers (who are not pilots themselves) can be carried.

==Culture==
The largest airshow in the world is the Experimental Aircraft Association&#x27;s annual EAA AirVenture Oshkosh airshow in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, which takes place in late July and early August. Other annual events are the Sun N&#x27; Fun Fly-In, which occurs in the early spring in Lakeland, Florida, and the Northwest EAA Fly-In in Arlington, Washington. These events are called fly-ins as many people fly their homebuilts and other aircraft into the airport hosting the show, often camping there for the duration. Both events last a week. Takeoffs and landings at these shows typically number in the thousands.

<doc id="1024007" wikidata="Q167408" url="?curid=1024007" title="The Statler Brothers">
<text>The Statler Brothers (sometimes simply referred to as The Statlers) were an American country music, gospel, and vocal group from Staunton, Virginia. The quartet was formed in 1955 performing locally, and from 1964 to 1972, they sang as opening act and backup singers for Johnny Cash.

Originally performing Southern gospel music at local churches, the group billed themselves as The Four Star Quartet, and later The Kingsmen. In 1963, when the song &quot;Louie, Louie&quot; by the garage rock band also called The Kingsmen became famous, the group elected to bill themselves as the Statler Brothers. Despite the name, only two members of the group (Don and Harold Reid) were actual brothers and no member had the surname of Statler. The group actually named themselves after a brand of facial tissue they had noticed in a hotel room (they later quipped that they could just as easily have named themselves &quot;the Kleenex Brothers&quot;). Don Reid sang lead; Harold Reid, Don&#x27;s older brother, sang bass; Phil Balsley sang baritone; and Lew DeWitt sang tenor and was the guitarist before being replaced due to ill health by Jimmy Fortune in 1981.

The band&#x27;s style was closely linked to their gospel roots. &quot;We took gospel harmonies,&quot; said Harold Reid, &quot;and put them over in country music.&quot; Most of their albums contain at least one gospel song, and they produced several containing only gospel. They also recorded a tribute song to The Blackwood Brothers, who influenced their music. The song &quot;We Got Paid by Cash&quot; was written by the Statler Brothers as a tribute to Johnny Cash, who discovered and mentored them.

== Career ==
Early in the group&#x27;s history, before the group named themselves The Statler Brothers, Joe McDorman was their lead singer.

The Statlers began their career at a performance at Lyndhurst Methodist Church near their hometown of Staunton, Virginia, under the name The Four Star Quartet. In 1964, they started an eight-year run as Johnny Cash&#x27;s opening act and backing vocalists. This period of their career was memorialized in their song &quot;We Got Paid by Cash.&quot; They were featured regularly on &quot;The Johnny Cash Show&quot;, his ABC hit show that ran from 1969 to 1971. Due to their expanding career, the Statlers left Cash&#x27;s entourage around the mid-1970s to concentrate on their career, a departure that took place on good terms.

Two of the Statlers&#x27; best-known songs are &quot;Flowers on the Wall,&quot; their first major hit that was composed and written by Lew DeWitt, and the socially conscious &quot;Bed of Rose&#x27;s&quot;. In the 1980s, the Statlers were a mainstay on The Nashville Network (TNN), where their videos were shown regularly. Also on TNN, between 1991 and 1998, they hosted &quot;The Statler Brothers Show&quot;, a weekly variety show, which was the network&#x27;s top-rated program for its entire 7-year run.

Throughout the Statlers&#x27; career, much of their appeal was related to their incorporation of comedy and parody into their musical act, due in large part to the humorous and comedic talent of group member Harold Reid; they were frequently nominated for awards for their comedy as well as their singing. They recorded two comedy albums under the pseudonym Lester &quot;Roadhog&quot; Moran and the Cadillac Cowboys, and one-half of one side of the album &quot;Country Music Then and Now&quot; was devoted to satirizing small-town radio stations&#x27; Saturday-morning shows.

The Statlers earned the number-one spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart four times, for &quot;Do You Know You Are My Sunshine?&quot; in 1978, &quot;Elizabeth&quot; in 1984, and in 1985, &quot;My Only Love&quot; and &quot;Too Much on My Heart.&quot; Since forming, the Statlers have released over 40 albums.

In 1980, the Statler Brothers purchased and renovated their former elementary school, Beverly Manor, in Staunton, occupying the complex for several years. The complex consisted of offices for the group, a small museum and auditorium, and an adjacent building that served as office space for unrelated businesses. A garage was built to store the two tour buses that the group had used for many years. The group has since sold the complex, which Grace Christian Church in Staunton converted back into an academic campus.

In 1970, the group began performing at an annual Independence Day festival in Gypsy Hill Park in Staunton. The event, known as &quot;Happy Birthday USA,&quot; lasted for 25 years, and included many country-music figures, including Mel Tillis, Charley Pride, and many others. The event drew as many as 100,000 fans each year. The group also honored their hometown with the song &quot;Staunton, Virginia&quot; on their 1973 album &quot;Do You Love Me Tonight&quot;.

DeWitt retired from the Statler Brothers in 1982 due to ill health. After a 3-year hiatus, he returned to the music industry as a solo artist until shortly before his death on August 15, 1990, from complications of Crohn&#x27;s disease, at age 52.

Harold Reid (born on August 21, 1939) died on April 24, 2020, after a long battle with kidney failure, at age 80.

== Retirement ==
The group disbanded and retired after completing a farewell tour on October 26, 2002. Balsley and Don Reid continue to reside in Staunton, as did Harold Reid until his death in April 2020; Fortune, though, relocated to Nashville, where he continues his music career as a solo artist, having released three albums under his own name. The Statlers remain one of the most awarded acts in the history of country music.

Don Reid has pursued a second career as an author, having written six books of his own. With his sons Donald II (&quot;Debo&quot;) and Langdon, he co-wrote &quot;You Know It&#x27;s Christmas When . . .&quot; His brother Harold and he co-wrote a history of the Statler Brothers titled &quot;Random Memories&quot;, published in February 2008. In 2020, Reid wrote a complete anthology of the Statlers&#x27; songs, titled &quot;The Music of the Statler Brothers.&quot;

== Grandstaff/Wilson Fairchild ==
Wil and Langdon Reid, the sons of Harold and Don, respectively, formed a duo in the 1990s, originally performing under the name Grandstaff. In 2007, Grandstaff recorded &quot;The Statler Brothers Song&quot; as a tribute to the Statlers.

In an interview on Nashville&#x27;s WSM (AM) on March 25, 2010, Wil Reid said that they decided to change their name to Wilson Fairchild after many people got the name &quot;Grandstaff&quot; wrong during introductions. The name comes from &quot;Wilson,&quot; Wil&#x27;s middle name, and &quot;Fairchild,&quot; Langdon&#x27;s middle name.

Sisters Kim and Karmen Reid (daughters of Harold) also enjoyed a brief stint as a country duo in the early 1980s, which included a guest appearance on an episode of &quot;Hee Haw&quot;.

== Influence ==
The Statler Brothers have been credited as the first country music act to transfer the genre&#x27;s nostalgia from a rural to a suburban setting. They have also been called &quot;America&#x27;s Poets&quot; by Kurt Vonnegut. The bluegrass duo Dailey &amp; Vincent often performs with two other members of their band as a quartet in the style of the Statlers, often performing many of the Statlers&#x27; hits in their shows. Jimmy Fortune also sometimes tours with Dailey &amp; Vincent.

<text>Homebuilt machines are machines built outside of specialised workshops or factories. This can include different things such as kit cars or homebuilt computers, but normally it pertains to homebuilt aircraft, also known as amateur-built aircraft or kit planes. Homebuilt aircraft or kit cars are constructed by amateurs. Homebuilt computers have been built at home for a long time, starting with the Victorian era pioneer Charles Babbage in the 1820s. A century later, Konrad Zuse built his own machine when electromechanical relay technology was widely available. The hobby took off with the early development of microprocessors and, since then, many enthusiasts have constructed their own computers.
A homebuilt vehicle is a wider concept than a kit car. A homebuilt vehicle is a motor vehicle (car, truck or motorcycle) built by an individual instead of a manufacturer.
These machines may be constructed &quot;from scratch&quot;, from plans, or from assembly kits. Outside of the United States (for example in Russia) people wishing to build such complex machinery often have no professional networks to rely on for spare parts, plans, or advice in the matter and therefore have to rely on their ingenuity and intuition in order to build a machine that works.

== Examples of home-built machinery ==
* Amateur radio homebrew – Homebrew is an amateur radio slang term for home-built, noncommercial radio equipment.
* Amateur telescope making – The field of amateur telescope making is considered an offshoot of the amateur astronomy community. Amateur telescope makers (sometimes called ATMs), as their name implies, are not paid professionals. They build their telescopes for the enjoyment of the hobby, or so they can make a personal contribution to the field of astronomy.
* Dune buggy - popular method of building a dune buggy involves construction of a vehicle frame from steel tubing formed and welded together. The advantage of this method is that the fabricator can change fundamental parts of the vehicle (usually the suspension and addition of a built-in roll cage). Buggies of this type are called sandrails because of the rail frame. Sandrails, as with the VW Bug, often have the engine located behind the driver. Sizes can vary from a small engined one seat size to 4 seat, 8+ cylinder vehicles. Sandrails can have panels or custom shaped body coverings over the rails and tubing that comprise the vehicle, though many are left bare.
* Amateur rocketry sometimes known as amateur experimental rocketry or experimental rocketry is a hobby in which participants experiment with fuels and make their own rocket motors, launching a wide variety of types and sizes of rockets. Amateur rocketeers have been responsible for significant research into hybrid rocket motors, and have built and flown a variety of solid, liquid, and hybrid propellant motors. On May 17, 2004 Civilian Space eXploration Team (CSXT) successfully launched the first amateur high-power rocket into space, achieving an altitude of 72 miles (115 km). Prior to that the Reaction Research Society on November 23, 1996 launched a solid-fueled rocket, designed by longtime member George Garboden, to an altitude of 50 miles (80 km) from the Black Rock Desert in Nevada.
* Stitch and glue is a simple boat building method which uses plywood, epoxy glue, and &quot;stitches&quot; and eliminates the need for stems and chines. Plywood panels are cut to detailed profiles and stitched together to form an accurate hull shape, without the need for forms or special tools. This technique is also called &quot;tack and tape&quot;, and &quot;stitch and tape&quot;.

<doc id="1024009" wikidata="Q5293553" url="?curid=1024009" title="Don Spencer">
<text>Donald Richard Spencer (born ) is an Australian singer-songwriter, musician, and former children&#x27;s television presenter. He had a long tenure as a host on &quot;Play School&quot; on both the Australian version (1968–99) and the United Kingdom version (1972–88), one of only two presenters to work on both versions.

In March 1963, his first single, &quot;Fireball&quot; – the theme tune to a UK TV science fiction series &quot;Fireball XL5&quot; – reached No.32 on the UK Singles Chart. In 2002, Spencer established the Australian Children&#x27;s Music Foundation. On Australia Day (26 January) 2007, he was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) with the citation &quot;for service to children&#x27;s music and television as a songwriter and performer, and through the establishment of the Australian Children&#x27;s Music Foundation&quot;. Spencer married Julie Horsfall, they have two children: Dean, a musician; and Danielle, an actress and singer, who was married to actor Russell Crowe between 2003 and 2018. In 2022, he celebrated his 60th year in the performing industry.

==Early life==
Spencer was born in Tamworth to John Henry and Lillian May Spencer. He attended Tamworth High School. He played hockey as a teenager and competed in the Australian championships. At 17, he left Australia and travelled to Africa, where, in his 20s, he trained with the Kenyan hockey team, trying out for the Olympics. A chance meeting with locally-born, British singer-songwriter, Roger Whittaker, in Nairobi inspired Spencer to buy a guitar and start his musical career.

==Recording and performance career==
In the early 1960s, Don Spencer moved to London and became a solo singer-guitarist, supporting various acts such as The Rolling Stones, the Four Seasons, The Hollies and Marianne Faithfull. His first single, &quot;Fireball&quot;, was released on the His Master&#x27;s Voice label; it was the closing theme song for the television science fiction series &quot;Fireball XL5&quot;, written by Barry Gray. In March 1963, it reached No. 32 on the UK Singles Chart. Other singles included &quot;Busy Doing Nothing&quot;, &quot;Worried Mind&quot;, &quot;Marriage Is for Old Folks&quot;, and a cover of The Beatles&#x27; 1965 song &quot;In My Life&quot;. In 1964, he covered Brent Edwards&#x27; version of Johnny Madara and David White&#x27;s track &quot;Pride Is Such a Little Word&quot;.

==Television and radio==
Spencer started his successful broadcasting career in the United Kingdom. At the BBC he presented his own teenage pop show &quot;Gangway!&quot; for seven years. He co-hosted a radio program called &quot;Pop-In&quot;. He later appeared in TV comedies such as &quot;Face It with Ronnie Barker&quot;. 

Spencer returned to Australia and appeared on TV&#x27;s &quot;Bandstand&quot;, briefly featured in series &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot; and &quot;Return to Eden&quot; and in the 1974 film &quot;Barry McKenzie Holds His Own&quot;. In 1977, Spencer wrote his next single, &quot;What&#x27;s a Pommie?&quot; The track was covered by fellow Australians Rolf Harris and Col Elliott.

==Play School: Children&#x27;s entertainer==

Spencer is best known for his long tenure. as a children&#x27;s entertainer, as both a presenter and recording artist, he joined the Australia TV series &quot;Play School&quot; in 1968 and the United Kingdom version of the same title in 1972. He continued on both versions for 17 years, the only male presenter to appear on both versions. One of his well-known phrases was &quot;old magazines&quot;, which he used to effect when describing items used to make something. During this period, he recorded and released albums, primarily through ABC Records over a 27 year period that helped to educate children, mostly about the many species of Australian animals, and they in turn have received awards for gold and platinum sales. He continued on the Australian version until 1999.

==Music career==
At the APRA Music Awards of 1995, Spencer&#x27;s tracks &quot;Have a Beaut Day&quot; and &quot;Stand Up&quot; were nominated for Most Performed Children&#x27;s Work; they were co-written by Spencer with Allan Caswell.

In 2002, Spencer established the Australian Children&#x27;s Music Foundation (ACMF) as its inaugural CEO. In 2007, he was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) on Australia Day (26 January) for &quot;service to children&#x27;s music and television as a songwriter and performer, and through the establishment of the Australian Children&#x27;s Music Foundation&quot;. In 2008, Spencer was awarded for Excellence in Community Support presented by Support Act Limited.

In December 2010, the ACMF sponsored a supergroup, Peacebeliever, which recorded a cover version of Plastic Ono Band&#x27;s 1969 single &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; for their charity. Alongside Spencer, fellow vocalists include Katie Noonan, Blue King Brown, Tim Freedman, Newton Faulkner, and Omara Portuondo. In July 2013, Spencer announced the ACMF&#x27;s 11th annual National Kids Songwriting Competition, which is open to school-aged children from four to eighteen years old. Spencer said, &quot;We want kids to unleash their creativity and engage with learning in a fun way ... Music can give kids really positive self expression and is a great tool for improving literacy levels&quot;.

As of 2023, Spencer continues to record and perform with his latest release a musical adaption, based on Rudyard Kipling poem &quot;If&quot;.

==Personal life==

Don Spencer married Julie Horsfall, a caterer from Yorkshire. They have two children: Dean and Danielle Spencer (born 16 May 1969). Dean is a musician, while Danielle is an actress and singer, who was married to actor Russell Crowe from 2003 to 2018.

<text>Nocardiosis is an infectious disease affecting either the lungs (&quot;pulmonary nocardiosis&quot;) or the whole body (&quot;systemic nocardiosis&quot;). It is due to infection by a bacterium of the genus &quot;Nocardia&quot;, most commonly &quot;Nocardia asteroides&quot; or &quot;Nocardia brasiliensis&quot;.

It is most common in adult immunocompromised males. In patients with brain involvement, mortality exceeds 80%; in other forms, mortality is about 50%, even with appropriate therapy.

It is one of several conditions that have been called &quot;the great imitator&quot;. Cutaneous nocardiosis commonly occurs in immunocompetent hosts and is caused in 80% of cases by &quot;Nocardia brasiliensis&quot;.

==Signs and symptoms==
Pulmonary infection
* Subacute to chronic progressive pneumonia
* Night sweats, fever, cough with chest pain
* Symptoms are more severe in immunocompromised individuals
* Radiologic studies show multiple necrotic pulmonary infiltrates.
Neurological infection
* Headache, lethargy, confusion, seizures, sudden onset of neurological deficits
* CT scan shows one or more cerebral abscesses
* Is often difficult to diagnose
* Serious risk of death
Cardiac conditions
* In recorded cases, it has caused damage to heart valves whether natural or prosthetic
Lymphocutaneous disease
* Nocardial cellulitis is akin to erysipelas but is less aggressive.
* Lymphocutaneous nocardiosis mimics the fungal infection sporotrichosis with multiple nodules alongside a lymphatic vessel 
* Persistent subcutaneous and deep bone infections have been recorded.
* May be misidentified and treated as a &quot;S. aureus&quot; skin infection
* Cultures must incubate more than 48 hours to guarantee accuracy
Ocular disease
* Very rarely, these bacteria cause keratitis
* Generally there is a history of ocular trauma.
Disseminated nocardiosis
* Disseminated infection can occur in very immunocompromised patients
* It generally involves both lung and brain abscesses
* Fever, moderate or very high can be seen
* Multiple cavitating necrotic pulmonary infiltrates develop
* Cerebral abscesses arise later
* Cutaneous lesions are very rarely seen
* Serious risk of death

==Causes==
Normally found in soil, these organisms cause occasional sporadic disease in humans and animals throughout the world. Another well publicized find is that of Nocardia as part of the oral microflora. Nocardia spp. have been reported in the normal gingivae and periodontal pockets along with other species such as &quot;Actinomyces&quot;, &quot;Arthromyces&quot; and &quot;Streptomyces&quot; spp.

The usual mode of transmission is inhalation of organisms suspended in dust. Another very common method is by traumatic introduction, especially in the jaw. This leads to the entrance of Nocardia into the blood stream and the propagation of its pathogenic effects. Transmission by direct inoculation through puncture wounds or abrasions is less common. Generally, nocardial infection requires some degree of immune suppression.

A weakened immune system is a general indicator of a person who is more susceptible to nocardiosis, such as someone who already has a disease that weakens their immune system. Additionally, those with low T-cell counts or other complications involving T-cells can expect to have a higher chance of becoming infected. Besides those with weak immune systems, a local traumatic inoculation can cause nocardiosis, specifically the cutaneous, lymphocutaneous, and subcutaneous forms of the disease. There is no racial pattern in the risk of becoming infected with Nocardiosis.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of nocardiosis can be made by a doctor using various techniques. These techniques include, but are not limited to: a chest x-ray to analyze the lungs, a bronchoscopy, a brain/lung/skin biopsy, or a sputum culture. However, diagnosis may be difficult. Nocardiae are gram positive, weakly acid-fast, branching rod-shaped bacteria and can be visualized by a modified Ziehl–Neelsen stain such as the Fite-Faraco method. In the clinical laboratory, routine cultures may be held for insufficient time to grow nocardiae, and referral to a reference laboratory may be needed for species identification. Pulmonary infiltration and pleural effusion are usually detected via x-ray.

==Treatment==
Nocardiosis requires at least six months of treatment, preferably with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or high doses of sulfonamides. In patients who do not respond to sulfonamide treatment, other drugs, such as ampicillin, erythromycin, or minocycline, may be added.

Treatment also includes surgical drainage of abscesses and excision of necrotic tissue. The acute phase requires complete bed rest; as the patient improves, activity can increase.

A new combination drug therapy (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ceftriaxone, and amikacin) has also shown promise.

== Prognosis ==
The prognosis of nocardiosis is highly variable. The state of the host&#x27;s health, site, duration, and severity of the infection all play parts in determining the prognosis. Currently, skin and soft tissue infections have a 100% cure rate, and pleuropulmonary infections have a 90% cure rate with appropriate therapy. The cure rate falls to 63% with those infected with disseminated nocardiosis, with only half of patients surviving infections that cause brain abscess. Additionally, 44% of people who are infected in the central nervous system (CNS) die, increasing to 85% if that person has an already weakened immune system. There are no preventative treatments for nocardiosis. The only recommendation is to protect open wounds to limit entrance of the bacterium.

== Epidemiology ==
Although there are no international data available on worldwide infection rates per year, there are roughly 500–1000 documented cases of nocardiosis per year in the US. Most of these cases occur in men, as there is a 3:1 ratio of male of female cases annually; however, this difference may be due to exposure frequency rather than susceptibility differences. From an age perspective, it is not highly more prevalent in one age group than another. Cutaneous nocardiosis is slightly more common in middle aged men, but as a whole, all age groups are susceptible. There is no racial pattern in the risk of becoming infected with nocardiosis.

<text>An aerobatic aircraft is an aerodyne (a heavier-than-air aircraft) used in aerobatics, both for flight exhibitions and aerobatic competitions.

Most fall into one of two categories, aircraft used for training and by flight demonstration teams, which are often standard trainers or fighters, and aircraft especially designed for aerobatics, usually at the expense of other attributes, such as stability, carrying passengers or endurance. Dates are of first flight.

<text>Dov Hoz (, September 19, 1894 - December 29, 1940) was a leader of the Labor Zionism movement, one of the founders of the Haganah organization, and a pioneer of Israeli aviation.

==Biography==
Born in Orsha, Russian Empire, in 1894, Hoz immigrated to Ottoman Palestine as a child along with his family in 1906. Beginning in 1909, he was part of the group that organized guarding activity of the city of Tel-Aviv. The group included Shaul Meirov-Avigur, Eliyahu Golomb and Moshe Sharett. During World War I, Hoz volunteered for service in the Turkish army and was sentenced to death for continuing activities to secure the Jewish settlement of Palestine. He escaped death by fleeing to the south of Palestine which had just been conquered by the British.
Hoz was one of the organizers of the Jewish Legion. From 1920 to 1930, he was a member of the central Haganah committee. From 1931 to 1940, he was a member of the national Haganah command center. He went on to become one of the heads of the labor movement and a founding member of the socialist Ahdut HaAvoda party. In 1935 he was appointed vice-mayor of Tel-Aviv, and later head of the state department of the Histadrut (Labor Federation).

Hoz died in a car accident in December 1940. He was on his way to an &quot;Aviron&quot; board meeting. He was traveling with his wife Rivka (sister of Moshe Sharett, who later became Israel&#x27;s second prime minister) and his daughter Tirza. Also in the car were his sister-in-law Tzvia Sharett and &quot;Aviron&quot; co-founder Yitzhak Ben-Ya&#x27;akov. They all lost their lives in the fatal accident.

==Aviation==
Hoz and Yitzhak Ben Ya&#x27;akov from Degania Alef were the founders of Aviron Aviation Company, for which Hoz acted as CEO. Aviron was one of a handful of aviation pioneering enterprises of the Yishuv, created with its foreseeable security needs in mind. It trained pilots and established flight lines in Mandatory Palestine and outside, while serving as cover for the budding, tiny and illegal &quot;air force&quot; of the Yishuv, eventually organised between 1945 and 10 November 1947 as Palmach&#x27;s Palavir, and then until Independence as the Haganah&#x27;s Sherut Avir.

==Legacy and commemoration==
One year after Hoz&#x27;s death, on Hanukkah 1941, Kibbutz Dorot was established in the Negev by German Jewish refugees. They dedicated their new home to the memory of the Hoz family. (Dorot is an acronym formed by the first letters of the names Dov, Rivka and Tirza.) Many national and local institutions and streets throughout Israel have been named in memory of Dov Hoz in the years since his tragic death. Tel Aviv&#x27;s former city airport, Sde Dov Airport, was also named after him.

<text>Weitchpec ( ; Karuk: &quot;Ansáfriik&quot;; Yurok: &quot;Wechpues&quot;, &quot;Wech&quot;) is an unincorporated village and CDP within the Yurok reservation in Humboldt County, California, United States. It is located northeast of Eureka, at an elevation of 361 feet (110 m). The ZIP Code is 95546.

Weitchpec is located in the northwestern part of the state at the confluence of the Klamath and Trinity Rivers, and the junction of State Highways 96 and 169.

==History==
Weitchpec is an ancestral Yurok village that long predates European contact. It was originally known as Weitspus, and was considered a major settlement of the Yurok people. Temporary Euro-American names for the settlement in the 19th century were Durkee&#x27;s Ferry and Weitchpec Bar. Durkee&#x27;s Ferry recalls Clark W. Durkee, who operated a ferry at the place in 1851. In 1855, a temporary Federal post called Camp Strowbridge was established at Weitchpec, it was later called Fort Wool. The settlement was first within the bounds of Trinity County, then in 1851 Klamath County and after 1874, Humboldt County. A post office operated at Weitchpec from 1858 to 1860 and from 1891 to 1962.

Today Weitchpec features a small store/gas station owned by the tribe (formerly Pierson&#x27;s Grocery); the Yurok Tribal Office and Community Center; and Weitchpec Elementary School. As of 2010, evening classes were available in Weitchpec in the Yurok language.

===2012 earthquake===
A 5.6 earthquake with an epicenter near Weitchpec occurred on February 13, 2012.

==Demographics==
Weitchpec first appeared as a census designated place in the 2020 U.S. Census.

<doc id="1024033" wikidata="Q422434" url="?curid=1024033" title="Potassium perchlorate">
<text>Potassium perchlorate is the inorganic salt with the chemical formula KClO4. Like other perchlorates, this salt is a strong oxidizer when the solid is heated at high temperature although it usually reacts very slowly in solution with reducing agents or organic substances. This colorless crystalline solid is a common oxidizer used in fireworks, ammunition percussion caps, explosive primers, and is used variously in propellants, flash compositions, stars, and sparklers. It has been used as a solid rocket propellant, although in that application it has mostly been replaced by the more performant ammonium perchlorate.

KClO4 has a relatively low solubility in water (1.5 g in 100 mL of water at 25 °C).

==Production==

Potassium perchlorate is prepared industrially by treating an aqueous solution of sodium perchlorate with potassium chloride. This single precipitation reaction exploits the low solubility of KClO4, which is about 1/100 as much as the solubility of NaClO4 (209.6 g/100 mL at 25 °C).

It can also be produced by bubbling chlorine gas through a solution of potassium chlorate and potassium hydroxide, and by the reaction of perchloric acid with potassium hydroxide; however, this is not used widely due to the dangers of perchloric acid.

Another preparation involves the electrolysis of a potassium chlorate solution, causing KClO4 to form and precipitate at the anode. This procedure is complicated by the low solubility of both potassium chlorate and potassium perchlorate, the latter of which may precipitate onto the electrodes and impede the current.

==Oxidizing properties==
KClO4 is an oxidizer in the sense that it exothermically &quot;transfers oxygen&quot; to combustible materials, greatly increasing their rate of combustion relative to that in air. Thus, it reacts with glucose to give carbon dioxide, water molecules and potassium chloride:

: 3 KClO4 + C6H12O6 → 6 CO2 + 6 H2O + 3 KCl

The conversion of solid glucose into hot gaseous is the basis of the explosive force of this and other such mixtures. With sugar, KClO4 yields a low explosive, provided a necessary confinement. Otherwise such mixtures simply deflagrate with an intense purple flame characteristic of potassium. Flash compositions used in firecrackers usually consist of a mixture of aluminium powder and potassium perchlorate. This mixture, sometimes called flash powder, is also used in ground and air fireworks.

As an oxidizer, potassium perchlorate can be used safely in the presence of sulfur, whereas potassium chlorate cannot. The greater reactivity of chlorate is typical – perchlorates are kinetically poorer oxidants. Chlorate produces chloric acid (), which is highly unstable and can lead to premature ignition of the composition. Correspondingly, perchloric acid () is quite stable.

For a commercial use, potassium perchlorate is mixed 50/50 with potassium nitrate to fabricate &quot;Pyrodex&quot;, a black powder substitute, and when not compressed within a muzzle loading firearm or in a cartridge, burns at a sufficiently slow rate to prevent it from being categorized with the black powder as a &quot;low explosive&quot;, and to demote it as &quot;flammable&quot; material.

==Debated medical use==
Potassium perchlorate can be used as an antithyroid agent used to treat hyperthyroidism, usually in combination with one other medication. This application exploits the similar ionic radius and hydrophilicity of perchlorate and iodide.

The administration of known goitrogen substances can also be used as a prevention in reducing the biological uptake of iodine, (whether it is the nutritional non-radioactive iodine-127 or radioactive iodine, most commonly iodine-131 (half-life = 8.02 days), as the body cannot discern between different iodine isotopes). Perchlorate ions, a common water contaminant in the USA due to the aerospace industry, has been shown to reduce iodine uptake and thus is classified as a goitrogen. Perchlorate ion is a competitive inhibitor of the process by which iodide is actively accumulated into the thyroid follicular cells. Studies involving healthy adult volunteers determined that at levels above 7 micrograms per kilogram per day (μg/(kg·d)), perchlorate begins to temporarily inhibit the thyroid gland&#x27;s ability to absorb iodine from the bloodstream (&quot;iodide uptake inhibition&quot;, thus perchlorate is a known goitrogen). The reduction of the iodide pool by perchlorate has a dual effect – reduction of excess hormone synthesis and hyperthyroidism, on the one hand, and reduction of thyroid inhibitor synthesis and hypothyroidism on the other. Perchlorate remains very useful as a single dose application in tests measuring the discharge of radioiodide accumulated in the thyroid as a result of many different disruptions in the further metabolism of iodide in the thyroid gland.

Treatment of thyrotoxicosis (including Graves&#x27; disease) with 600-2,000 mg potassium perchlorate (430-1,400 mg perchlorate) daily for periods of several months, or longer, was once a common practice, particularly in Europe, and perchlorate use at lower doses to treat thyroid problems continues to this day. Although 400 mg of potassium perchlorate divided into four or five daily doses was used initially and found effective, higher doses were introduced when 400 mg/d was discovered not to control thyrotoxicosis in all subjects.

Current regimens for treatment of thyrotoxicosis (including Graves&#x27; disease), when a patient is exposed to additional sources of iodine, commonly include 500 mg potassium perchlorate twice per day for 18–40 days.

Prophylaxis with perchlorate-containing water at concentrations of 17 ppm, corresponding to 0.5 mg/(kg·d) intake for a person of 70 kg consuming 2 litres of water per day, was found to reduce the baseline of radioiodine uptake by 67% This is equivalent to ingesting a total of just 35 mg of perchlorate ions per day. In another related study were subjects drank just 1 litre of perchlorate-containing water per day at a concentration of 10 ppm, i.e. daily 10 mg of perchlorate ions were ingested, an average 38% reduction in the uptake of Iodine was observed.

However, when the average perchlorate absorption in perchlorate plant workers subjected to the highest exposure has been estimated as approximately 0.5 mg/(kg·d), as in the above paragraph, a 67% reduction of iodine uptake would be expected. Studies of chronically exposed workers though have thus far failed to detect any abnormalities of thyroid function, including the uptake of iodine. This may well be attributable to sufficient daily exposure, or intake, of stable iodine-127 among these workers and the short 8 hr biological half life of perchlorate in the body.

To completely block the uptake of iodine-131 (half-life = 8.02 days) by the purposeful addition of perchlorate ions to a public water supply, aiming at dosages of 0.5 mg/(kg·d), or a water concentration of 17 ppm, would therefore be grossly inadequate at truly reducing a radio-iodine uptake. Perchlorate ion concentrations in a region water supply, would need to be much higher, at least 7.15 mg/kg of body weight per day or a water concentration of 250 ppm, assuming people drink 2 liters of water per day, to be truly beneficial to the population at preventing bioaccumulation when exposed to an iodine-131 contamination, independent of the availability of iodate or iodide compounds.

The distribution of perchlorate tablets, or the addition of perchlorate to the water supply, would need to continue for 80–90 days (~10 half-life of 8.02 days) after the release of iodine-131. After this time, the radioactive iodine-131 would have decayed to less than 1/1000 of its initial activity at which time the danger from the biological uptake of iodine-131 is essentially over.

===Limitations and criticisms===
So, perchlorate administration could represent a possible alternative to iodide tablets distribution in case of a large-scale nuclear accident releasing important quantities of iodine-131 in the atmosphere. However, the advantages are not always clear and would depend on the extent of a hypothetical nuclear accident. As for the stable iodide intake to rapidly saturate the thyroid gland before it accumulates radioactive iodine-131, a careful cost-benefit analysis has to be first done by the nuclear safety authorities. Indeed, blocking the thyroid activity of a whole population for three months can also have negative consequences for the human health, especially for young children. 

So, the decision of perchlorate, or stable iodine, administration cannot be left to the individual initiative and falls under the authority of the government in case of a major nuclear accident. 

Injecting perchlorate or iodide directly in the public drinking water is also probably as restrictive as tablets distribution.

<doc id="1024039" wikidata="Q13644267" url="?curid=1024039" title="List of Test cricket hat-tricks">
<text>In cricket, a hat-trick occurs when a bowler takes a wicket with each of three consecutive deliveries. Although hat-tricks can carry over between innings, meaning a batter can be dismissed twice as part of the same hat-trick, they do not carry over between matches. As of January 2025, this feat has only been achieved 48 times, by 44 different bowlers, in more than 2,000 men&#x27;s Test matches, the form of the sport in which national representative teams compete in matches of up to five days&#x27; duration. 

The first Test hat-trick was recorded on 2 January 1879, in only the third Test match to take place, by the Australia pace bowler Fred Spofforth, nicknamed &quot;The Demon Bowler&quot;, who dismissed three England batters with consecutive deliveries at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The most recent Test hat-trick was taken by Noman Ali in January 2025.

This article relates to men&#x27;s cricket only. There have been three hat-tricks in women&#x27;s Test cricket.

==Notable Test hat-tricks==
===Bowlers with multiple Test hat-tricks===
A player has taken two hat-tricks in the same Test match only once. Playing for Australia against South Africa in the first match of the 1912 Triangular Tournament at Old Trafford, Manchester, England, leg spinner Jimmy Matthews took a hat-trick in South Africa&#x27;s first and second innings, both taken on 28 May 1912. He completed both hat-tricks by dismissing South Africa&#x27;s Tommy Ward. 

Only three other cricketers have taken more than one Test hat-trick: Australian off spinner Hugh Trumble (two years apart, between the same teams at the same ground), Pakistan fast bowler Wasim Akram (just over a week apart, in consecutive matches between the same teams) and England fast bowler Stuart Broad.

===Test hat-tricks spread over two innings===
Australian Merv Hughes is the only bowler to take a hat-trick where the wickets fell over three overs. This was at WACA, Perth in 1988. He took a wicket (Curtly Ambrose) with the final ball of an over. With the first ball of his next over he took the final wicket of the West Indies innings (Patrick Patterson). He then removed the opener Gordon Greenidge with the first ball of the West Indies second innings. Even more unusually, Hughes&#x27;s two first-innings wickets were not consecutive, since Tim May had bowled an over himself in between Hughes&#x27;s two deliveries, and took the wicket of Gus Logie.

Two other hat-tricks have taken place over two innings rather than one, both taken by West Indians against Australia – Courtney Walsh and Jermaine Lawson. Walsh&#x27;s, at the Gabba in 1988, was unusual since, like Hughes&#x27; (which was in the very next Test in the series), other wickets fell between the beginning and end of the hat-trick. After dismissing Dodemaide to finish off Australia&#x27;s first innings, Walsh did not open the bowling in the Australian second innings, and in fact did not bowl until Australia had already lost two wickets and were 65 for 2: then with his first two deliveries he dismissed Wood and Veletta. Lawson&#x27;s hat trick was at the Kensington Oval in 2003. He removed tail-enders Lee and MacGill in successive deliveries before Australia declared their first innings (at 605/9), and then took the wicket of Langer with the first delivery of Australia&#x27;s second innings.

===Other notable Test hat-tricks===
*Three players have taken a hat-trick on their Test debut: English medium pace bowler Maurice Allom in 1930, New Zealand off-spinner Peter Petherick in 1976, and Australian pace bowler Damien Fleming in 1994. 
*Alok Kapali took the fewest total Test wickets of any player who recorded a hat-trick, taking only six wickets in his entire Test career. 
*Australian Peter Siddle is the only bowler to take a hat-trick on his birthday. 
*Bangladeshi off spinner Sohag Gazi is the only male player to score a century and take a hat-trick in the same Test match.
*Sri Lankan seamer Nuwan Zoysa became the first player in the history to take a hat-trick off the first three balls of a Test match. He achieved this against Zimbabwe at Harare in November 1999, dismissing Trevor Gripper, Murray Goodwin and Neil Johnson. Indian pacer Irfan Pathan is the second bowler to take a hat-trick in the first over of a Test match, against Pakistan in 2006.

In the five-match series between a Rest of the World XI and England in 1970, a hat-trick was taken by South African Eddie Barlow in the fourth match, at Headingley (the last three of four wickets in five balls). These matches were considered to be Tests at the time, but that status was later removed.

==Test hat-tricks==

England and Australia combined have taken over half of all Test match hat-tricks to date, 26 of 48.

<text>Paul Howard Poberezny (September 14, 1921 – August 22, 2013) was an American aviator, entrepreneur, and aircraft designer. He founded the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) in 1953, and spent the greater part of his life promoting homebuilt aircraft.

Poberezny is widely considered as the first person to have popularized the tradition of aircraft homebuilding in the United States. Through his work founding EAA and the organization&#x27;s annual convention in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, he had the reputation of helping inspire millions of people to get involved in grassroots aviation. Many attribute his legacy with the growth and sustainment of the US general aviation industry in the later part of the 20th century and into the early 21st. For the last two decades of his tenure as chairman of the EAA from 1989–2009, he worked closely with his son, aerobatic pilot and EAA president Tom Poberezny, to expand the organization and create several new programs within it, including an aviation education program for youth and the EAA Museum, among other initiatives.

In addition to his longtime experience as a military aviator (earning all seven types of pilot wings offered by the armed services), Poberezny was also an instructor, air show, air race and test pilot who frequently test flew his own homebuilt designs as well as various aircraft built by the EAA, such as the EAA Biplane. He flew for more than 70 years of his life in over 500 different types of aircraft, and was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1999. He also received the Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy in 2002 and was ranked fourth on &quot;Flying&quot;&#x27;s list of the 51 Heroes of Aviation, the highest-ranked living person on the list at the time of its release. Poberezny died of cancer in 2013, at the age of 91.

==Early life==
Paul Poberezny was the oldest of three children born to Peter Poberezny, a Ukrainian migrant born and raised in Terebovlia, and Jettie Dowdy, who hailed from the southern United States. Born in Leavenworth County, Kansas, Paul grew up poor in a tar paper shack in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and never experienced indoor plumbing until he went to school. He became interested in aviation at an early age and built model airplanes as his first educational experience into aircraft design. He then learned how to fly and repair aircraft in high school, starting with a WACO Primary Glider and Porterfield 35 monoplane, and followed by an American Eagle biplane after high school. Having never attended college, Poberezny once described learning to fly and maintain the Eagle as the closest thing he ever had to a college education experience.

==Experimental Aircraft Association==
Poberezny founded the Experimental Aircraft Association out of his Hales Corners, Wisconsin home in 1953. It started as predominately an aircraft homebuilding organization in his basement, but later went on to capture all aspects of general aviation internationally. Poberezny retired as EAA President in 1989, remaining as chairman of the organization until 2009. As of 2017, the organization had approximately 200,000 members in more than 100 countries.

In 1953, the EAA released a two-page newsletter named &quot;The Experimenter&quot; (later renamed &quot;Sport Aviation&quot;). The newsletter was first published and written by Paul and his wife Audrey Poberezny along with other volunteers. The now-monthly magazine focuses on experimental homebuilding and other general aviation topics, including antique, war, and classic aircraft.

EAA&#x27;s annual convention and fly-in (now known as EAA AirVenture Oshkosh) in Oshkosh, Wisconsin attracts a total attendance in excess of 600,000 people, 10,000 aircraft, and 1,000 different forums &amp; workshops annually, making it the largest of its kind in the world. It was first held in 1953 at what is now Timmerman Field in Milwaukee, and attracted only a handful of airplanes. Towards the late &#x27;50s, the event outgrew Timmerman Field and was moved to the Rockford, Illinois Municipal Airport (now Chicago Rockford International Airport). There, attendance at the fly-in continued to grow until the Rockford airport was too small to accommodate the crowds, and so it was moved to Oshkosh&#x27;s Wittman Regional Airport in 1970.

Paul&#x27;s son, aerobatic world champion Tom Poberezny, was the chairman of the annual EAA AirVenture Convention from 1977 to August 2011, and was president of EAA from 1989 to September 2010. In March 2009, Paul stepped down as Chairman of EAA and his son took on these duties as well. Tom had a large impact on the expansive growth of the organization and convention over the more than two decades that he led them with his father.

The EAA spawned the creation of numerous aviation programs and activities within the organization, including a technical counselor program, flight advisor program, youth introduction-to-aviation program (the Young Eagles), National Cadet Special Activity program as part of the Civil Air Patrol (National Blue Beret), and more. In addition, AirVenture has nearly a $200 million annual economic impact on the surrounding region of Wisconsin and inspired the formation of other similar events such as Tannkosh in Germany and Sun &#x27;n Fun in Florida, as well as similar organizations such as the Aircraft Kit Industry Association founded by pioneer homebuilder Richard VanGrunsven.

==Military career==
Poberezny served for 30 years in the Wisconsin Air National Guard and United States Air Force, including active duty during World War II and the Korean War. He retired with the rank of lieutenant colonel, and attained all seven aviation wings offered by the military: glider pilot, service pilot, rated pilot, liaison pilot, senior pilot, Army aviator, and command pilot.

==Aircraft experience==
Poberezny flew over 500 aircraft types, including over 170 home-built planes throughout his life. He was introduced to aviation in 1936 at the age of 16 with the gift of a donated damaged WACO Primary Glider that he rebuilt and taught himself to fly. A high school teacher owned the glider and offered to pay Poberezny to repair it. He hauled it to his father&#x27;s garage, borrowed books on building/repairing airplanes, and completed the restoration soon after. A friend used his car to tow the glider into the air with Poberezny at the controls; it rose to around a hundred feet when he released the tow rope and coasted to a gentle landing in a bed of alfalfa. A year later, Poberezny soloed at age 17 in a 1935 Porterfield and soon co-owned an American Eagle biplane.

After returning home from World War II, Poberezny could not afford to buy his own aircraft, so he decided to build one himself. In 1955, he wrote a series of articles for the publication &quot;Mechanix Illustrated&quot;, where he described how an individual could buy a set of plans and build an airplane at home. In the magazine were also photos of himself fabricating the Baby Ace, an amateur-built aircraft (and the first to be marketed as a &quot;homebuilt&quot;) that he bought the rights to for US$200 a few years prior. The articles became extremely popular and gave the concept of homebuilding worldwide acclaim.

He designed, modified, and built several home-built aircraft, and had more than 30,000 hours of flight time in his career. Aircraft that he designed and built include:
*Acro Sport I &amp; II
*&quot;Little Audrey&quot;
*Poberezny P-5 Pober Sport
*Pober Jr Ace
*Pober Pixie
*Pober Super Ace

Poberezny made the first test flight of the EAA Biplane example &quot;Parkside Eagle&quot; in 1971, which was constructed by students of Parkside High School in Michigan.

His 1944 North American F-51D Mustang, dubbed &quot;Paul I&quot;, which he flew at air shows and air races from 1977–2003, is on display at the EAA Aviation Museum in Oshkosh.

==Personal life and death==
In 1996, Poberezny teamed with his daughter Bonnie, her husband Chuck Parnall, and Bill Blake to write &quot;Poberezny: The Story Begins&quot;, a recounting of the early years of Paul and Audrey, including the founding of EAA. Paul Poberezny died of cancer on August 22, 2013, in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, at age 91. His estate in Oshkosh is preserved by Aircraft Spruce &amp; Specialty Co. and was opened to public tours beginning in the summer of 2017. Audrey Poberezny died on November 1, 2020, at age 95, and Tom Poberezny died on July 25, 2022, at age 75, severing the last direct link between EAA and the Poberezny family that founded it.

==Awards and legacy==
In 1971 Poberezny was the first recipient of the Duane and Judy Cole Award, presented to individuals that promote sport aviation. In 1978 he was named an honorary fellow of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, in 1986 he was inducted into the Wisconsin Aviation Hall of Fame, and in 1987, the National Aeronautic Association (NAA) awarded him the Elder Statesman of Aviation. In 1997 he was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame and in 1999, the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio. He received the NBAA&#x27;s 2001 Award for Meritorious Service to Aviation and the 2002 Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy. In 2008 the Wisconsin Historical Society named him as a &quot;Wisconsin History Maker&quot;, recognizing his unique contributions to the state&#x27;s history. &quot;Flying Magazine&quot; ranked Poberezny at number 4 on their 2013 list of the &quot;51 Heroes of Aviation&quot;, putting him ahead of figures like Bob Hoover, Amelia Earhart, Jimmy Doolittle, and even Chuck Yeager. At the time of its release, just one month before his death, Poberezny was the highest-ranked living person on the list.

Many prominent aviation figures have praised Poberezny&#x27;s legacy as being crucial to the maturation of the general aviation industry and to aviation advocacy at large. Radio newscaster and pilot Paul Harvey said that the Poberezny family &quot;militantly manned the ramparts against those who would fence off the sky&quot;, and airshow pilot Julie Clark noted Poberezny as inspiring her and &quot;countless thousands of others to get involved in the promotion of aviation.&quot; The Klapmeier brothers, fellow Wisconsinites who founded Cirrus Aircraft in the mid-1980s with a homebuilt design, also credited Poberezny and the EAA as essential to their success:

<text>Arts Commons (Formerly EPCOR Centre for the Performing Arts) is a multi-venue arts centre in downtown Calgary, Alberta, Canada, located in the Olympic Plaza Cultural District.

Occupying a full city block, Arts Commons is a multi-level complex measuring over . It is one of the three largest arts centres in Canada and is home to six resident companies, including Alberta Theatre Projects, Arts Commons Presents, Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra, Downstage, One Yellow Rabbit, and Theatre Calgary. Approximately 200 community groups make use of Arts Commons facilities every year. In addition to a variety of performance and gathering spaces, Arts Commons also houses rehearsal halls, theatre workshops, offices, meeting rooms, a café, and visual and media arts galleries.

==History==
The oldest part of the city block that houses Arts Commons is the Burns Building, named after noted Calgarian Pat Burns. Construction began in April 1912 and was completed at a cost of $350,000. In the late 1970s, the demolition of the Burns Building became a possibility, because it was on land needed for the construction of the Calgary Centre for the Performing Arts. Demolition proposals were defeated by the Calgary City Council by one vote, and, along with the Calgary Public Building (built in 1930/31 at a cost of almost $2 million), the building was incorporated into the plan for the Arts Centre. In 1979, the Public Building was bought by the City of Calgary for $3.8 million and its upper floors are still occupied by City of Calgary offices.

The newly created Centre was officially opened on September 14, 1985 by the then Premier of Alberta Peter Lougheed. After a donation by EPCOR, an Edmonton, Alberta-based utilities company, the name was changed to the EPCOR CENTRE for the Performing Arts on May 1, 2001.

On December 17, 2014, at the Annual General Meeting, it was publicly announced that the performing arts centre would be rebranded as Arts Commons, the name which represents &quot;the Arts&quot; and which expands the organization&#x27;s offerings beyond the performing arts to a wider variety of arts and genres. &quot;Commons&quot; is derived from the old town square concept where ideas are shared, people from all walks of life gather, and different perspectives are welcomed.

==Amenities offered==
Almost 400,000 people attend 1800-plus performances and events each year at the Arts Commons, including productions and presentations by the six resident companies, including Alberta Theatre Projects, Arts Commons Presents, Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra, Downstage, One Yellow Rabbit, and Theatre Calgary. Such events include live theatre, dance, spoken word and readings, children&#x27;s events, experimental theatre, art exhibits, public forums, weddings, training sessions, meetings, arts education activities, sporting events and competition, award ceremonies and live music concerts ranging from symphonic to jazz, to folk, blues, world, and rock.

==Performance and other facilities==
* Jack Singer Concert Hall, with 1,800 seats, “the Jack” is the largest venue in the building. Suspended above the stage is a 185,000-pound laminated spruce-wood acoustical canopy, which can be raised or lowered to tune the hall according to the specific needs of each performer. Named for Jack Singer, the Concert Hall is the permanent home of the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra, which employs 65 full-time musicians, and the 6,040-pipe Carthy Organ.
* Max Bell Theatre is a 750-seat theatre and is home to Theatre Calgary.
* Martha Cohen Theatre is a 418-seat theatre and is home to Alberta Theatre Projects (ATP). 
* Big Secret Theatre is a 190-seat theatre and is home to One Yellow Rabbit.
* Engineered Air Theatre is used for concerts, films, plays, weddings, receptions, and galas. Can seat up to 185 theatre-style.
* Motel Theatre is a 50-seat black box, multi-purpose venue used for plays, experimental theatre and performance art and is home to Downstage.

==Activities and performances==

== Jordan Peterson Controversy ==
After the announcement of the University of Toronto professor Jordan Peterson giving a lecture at Arts Commons was announced, several Calgarian art groups addressed an open letter to the Arts Commons&#x27; Board of Directors on July 24, 2018. The letter demanded that the event be canceled, that they provide diversity training for their staff, and issue a public apology to the &quot;LGBT community&quot;. It expressed the &quot;deep shock and disappointment&quot; that the artists and organizations signing the letter felt over Arts Commons&#x27; choice to host the speaker, who in the past has been criticized for his online and public arguments against government mandated speech laws and his opposition to Bill C-16. The letter was signed by staff of several small artist run centres, including Untitled Art Society, TRUCK Contemporary Art in Calgary, Stride Gallery, The New Gallery, other organizations such as the M:ST Performance Artist Festival Society and VOICESYYC, and over 1200 individual signatures. A responding statement written by the CEO of Arts Commons at the time, Johann Zietsman, expressed Arts Commons&#x27; support for free speech which meant, &quot;not censoring someone because we don&#x27;t agree with what they have to say.&quot; The event was not canceled and was held on July 27, 2018.

== Censorship Controversy ==
In early September 2018, The New Gallery released a statement describing the circumstances of what it said was censorship of trans artist, Beck Gilmer-Osborne, exhibiting in a vitrine space within the Arts Commons building and Calgary +15 Network. The New Gallery&#x27;s said Arts Commons had turned off the 3-channel video work being exhibited in the space because, Arts Commons said, it contained swearing and nudity that had garnered complaints from patrons. On August 29, 2018 Arts Commons sent The New Gallery a letter saying the video work would have to be edited to remove the nudity and coarse language or the artwork would be taken down. In response, on September 8, 2018, The New Gallery provided an open-letter written by the exhibiting artist, B.G-Osborne, in which Osborne stated that &quot;rather than re-edit and censor my work to comfort certain viewers who are offended by the very banal acts of swearing and non-sexual nudity, I have decided to remove the piece from the space entirely.&quot; Osborne said it was ironic that an artwork that uses the imagery of cisgender actors playing trans characters to criticize the offensive portrayal of trans people was being criticized as offensive. Arts Commons owns the walkway and vitrine spaces but each is individually curated by a different gallery or art organization. Arts Commons programming director Jennifer Johnson said in an emailed statement to CBC that &quot;while Arts Commons believes the piece, A Thousand Cuts, has merit, the language and images contained in the video and audio component are not a fit with our commitment to creating a public space for all.&quot;

In 2006, Arts Commons (at the time the &quot;EPCOR CENTRE for the Performing Arts&quot;) also received criticism for censoring a transgender artist who was exhibiting in the same +15 walk way space with another of Calgary&#x27;s artist run centre galleries, TRUCK Contemporary Art in Calgary. A temporary wall was installed throughout the length of the walk way that blocked the entire view of the vitrine space save for a smaller entrance that could be accessed on the opposite side of the walk way. This wall was installed without speaking to the artist, Edie Fake, or staff from TRUCK. The artwork was titled, &#x27;Gaylord Phoenix in the Flower Temple&#x27; and depicted a cartoon of a gender-fluid man, touching his genitals (drawn as a noodle with paisley patterns).

<doc id="1024054" wikidata="Q2407643" url="?curid=1024054" title="Fumiya Fujii">
<text>is a Japanese musician, actor and former lead singer of The Checkers born in Kurume. His younger brother is Naoyuki Fujii, a musician and former sax player for The Checkers. His eldest son is Fuji TV announcer Kōki Fujii. He formerly belonged to Yamaha Music Foundation and Three Star Pro (both during the Checkers era), and now he is part of a private agency, FFM Co.

==Biography==
Fujii was born as the first child to a father who was a Japanese National Railways employee and a mother who was a beautician. When he was a junior high school student, he encountered the Japanese rock band CAROL and started playing music. After graduating from Nanchiku High School, he joined the Moji Railway Administration Bureau of the Japan National Railways (now Kyushu Railway Company), and after a six-month apprenticeship at Tosu Station, he worked as a freight train operator at Haiki Station, maneuvering and switching freight trains. He belonged to the National Railway Workers&#x27; Union (Kokurō).

In 1983, after retiring from the Japanese National Railways, Fujii made his debut as the lead singer of The Checkers and had many hits. Not only his singing ability, but also his appearance and behavior attracted attention, and more and more young people imitated his progressive fashion. He also wrote lyrics for most of the original songs released as singles, and became a central figure in songwriting. In 1992, The Checkers disbanded, and the following year, 1993, Fujii changed the spelling of his first name from kanji to katakana, and started his solo career. Naoyuki Fujii, his younger brother, was also a part of The Checkers and began pursuing a solo career as well. Together they did the project F-Blood in the late 1990s. At the time of the breakup, Fujii was invited to the U.S. by Gota Yashiki, who was living in Los Angeles at the time. Kenji Suzuki, who also lived in Los Angeles, chose him and bought him a Gibson B-25 guitar. The first song he composed using this guitar was &quot;True Love&quot;. The song, released the same year, sold 2.4 million copies, and &quot;Another Orion&quot;, released in 1996, sold over 1.2 million copies.

Fujii conceptualized the game &quot;Baby Universe&quot;; Sony Computer Entertainment Japan helped develop the game, which was released for the PlayStation in Japan and Europe by Sony Computer Entertainment in 1997. It is an interactive art video game where the player manipulates the surreal visuals of items like a kaleidoscope with the controller while equally psychedelic music plays in the background. Players can also insert CDs after removing the game disc to listen to music during the simulation in a manner similar to &quot;Vib-Ribbon&quot;. Fujii co-owns the copyright to the game.

In addition to singing, he has held solo exhibitions under the name &quot;FUMIYART&quot; and produced the Nagoya City Pavilion &quot;Tower of the Earth&quot; for Expo 2005 (recognized by the Guinness Book of Records as the world&#x27;s largest kaleidoscope). He has also appeared in many TV dramas, and provided the voice of Rock Holmes for the 2003 &quot;Astro Boy&quot; series, in addition to writing and singing its ending theme &quot;Boy&#x27;s Heart.&quot;

His songwriting credits include &quot;Shiroi Kumo no Youni&quot; (composed by Naoyuki Fujii) for the band Saruganseki and &quot;Hoshizora no Katasumi de&quot; (lyrics and composition) for Misia. He has also produced four songs, including &quot;Heart-Shaped Tears&quot; for Hinano Yoshikawa. His many contributions to the local community include composing the Kurume song &quot;Furusato no Sasayaki&quot; for his hometown Kurume, Fukuoka Prefecture, providing the design for the Kurume Citizen Card, creating the logo for Fukuoka Broadcasting Corporation, and designing the uniform for his alma mater Nanchiku High School. The nickname of Kagoshima City FM, the first community radio station to open in Kagoshima Prefecture on October 1, 1997, &quot;FRIENDS FM 762,&quot; was named by Fujii. He has also designed the countdown T-shirts for the 1998 Winter Olympics. The T-shirts were engraved with the number of days remaining until the day of the 1998 games, and Fujii was in charge of designing the shirts from 500 to 401 days before the games.

In 2007, Fujii wrote the lyrics and composed the song &quot;Chinju no Sato&quot; in praise of the 62nd Jingū Shikinen Sengū. It is included in the single &quot;Kimi ni Naru.&quot; He stayed in Ise, Mie for three days and composed the song on the riverbank of the Isuzu River near the Uji Bridge.

On December 31, 2008, at a countdown live performance at the Nippon Budokan, Fujii tied with Eikichi Yazawa for first place with 102 performances, including performances during the Checkers era, under the name F-BLOOD, and as a solo artist. In response, he said that he was honored to have stood on the same stage as Yazawa at the Budokan since CAROL (with Yazawa) was the reason why he started his music career.

In November 2019, Fujii opened an official channel on YouTube.

<doc id="1024055" wikidata="Q1677945" url="?curid=1024055" title="Michael Ian Black">
<text>Michael Ian Black (né Schwartz; August 12, 1971) is an American comedian, actor, and writer. He has starred in several TV comedy series, including &quot;The State&quot;, &quot;Viva Variety&quot;, &quot;Stella&quot;, &quot;Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp&quot;, &quot;Michael &amp; Michael Have Issues&quot;, and &quot;Another Period.&quot; In the late 1990s to early 2000s, he was the puppeteer and voice actor for the Pets.com sock puppet dog, and played a supporting character on the NBC drama series &quot;Ed&quot;. Since 2008 he has written a number of books, including several for children.

==Early life==
Black was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Jill and Robert Schwartz, a store owner and an executive, respectively. His family is Jewish. He grew up in Hillsborough Township, New Jersey, where he attended Hillsborough High School. His parents divorced when he was three years old; his mother, Jill, later came out as a lesbian. Black&#x27;s father died at age 39 due to a head injury apparently suffered in an assault and allergic reaction during subsequent surgery.

His birth name, Schwartz, is derived from the German word &quot;schwarz&quot;, which means black. He changed his name to Michael Ian Black to avoid confusion with the actor Mike Schwartz.

Black briefly attended New York University, but dropped out to portray Raphael in the promotional campaign for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles concert tour.

==Career==
===1991–2010===
Black began his career as a member of the comedy group The State and was featured on the television show of the same name on MTV. He continued working with members of that group on the show &quot;Viva Variety&quot; in the role of &quot;Johnny Bluejeans&quot;, and in the film &quot;Wet Hot American Summer&quot;, directed by frequent collaborator David Wain.

Black also appeared on VH1&#x27;s &quot;I Love the...&quot; series, his comedy troupe Stella, and in various TV series and films. From 1998 to 2000, he was the puppeteer and voice actor for the Pets.com sock puppet, was featured in commercials for Sierra Mist, hosted the first season of NBC&#x27;s hidden-camera show &quot;Spy TV&quot; (Miss USA 1996, Ali Landry, replaced him for the second season), made several appearances in the film &quot;Big Helium Dog&quot;, and had a supporting role on the NBC dramedy &quot;Ed&quot;, later becoming the mascot for BarNone. He would later describe his experience as the sock puppet as &quot;painful but fun&quot;.

His dry, sarcastically irreverent commentary on pop culture artifacts on VH1&#x27;s &quot;I Love the &#x27;70s/&#x27;80s/&#x27;90s/New Millennium&quot; series added to his and the shows&#x27; popularity. Black stated several times on the show that he felt as if he was &quot;doomed to an eternity&quot; of doing the &quot;I Love the...&quot; series. He also made fun of himself for being a Jewish-American and sarcastically enforcing Jewish stereotypes.

Black is a poker enthusiast and appeared in five episodes of &quot;Celebrity Poker Showdown&quot; beginning in 2003, playing for the Endeavor House charity. In 2004 and 2006 he played for the charity . In 2006, he came in third (receiving $100,000 for his charity). Black was praised for his humor and his skilled poker play by Dave Foley, host of &quot;Celebrity Poker Showdown&quot;, and by poker experts Phil Gordon and Phil Hellmuth.

In the latter part of 2004, he acted as guest host of CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; while auditioning for the permanent hosting role. He was a finalist for the position, but the job eventually went to Craig Ferguson. He is also an occasional contributor to the online edition of McSweeney&#x27;s, where he writes a column titled &quot;Michael Ian Black Is a Very Famous Celebrity&quot;.

Black, along with fellow &quot;State&quot; members Michael Showalter and David Wain, co-starred in and cowrote the Comedy Central series &quot;Stella&quot;, a television adaptation of their popular stage show. The ten-episode first season debuted in June 2005 and was not renewed for a second season.
Black wrote the screenplays for two feature film comedies —&quot;Wedding Daze&quot; (2006) and &quot;Run, Fat Boy, Run&quot; (2007, co-written with leading actor Simon Pegg). Black also directed &quot;Wedding Daze&quot; which stars Jason Biggs, Joe Pantoliano, and Isla Fisher.

Black also has some minor screen credits. He appeared twice on the Adult Swim show &quot;Tom Goes to the Mayor&quot;, was a guest voice on Seth Green&#x27;s stop-motion show &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, and later did a bit for &quot;Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!&quot;. He appeared on the Comedy Central shows &quot;Crank Yankers&quot; and &quot;Reno 911!&quot;. He had a cameo in David Wain&#x27;s 2007 film &quot;The Ten&quot; as a prison guard. In September 2007, he released his first stand-up comedy album, &quot;I Am a Wonderful Man&quot;. In addition, he starred on the TV series &quot;Reaper&quot; as a gay demon trying to destroy the devil through acts of kindness. In 2008, Black published a book titled &quot;My Custom Van ... And 50 Other Mind-Blowing Essays That Will Blow Your Mind All Over Your Face&quot;. Also in 2008, he hosted &quot;Reality Bites Back&quot;, a scripted reality show on Comedy Central.

Black then developed another show for Comedy Central, &quot;Michael Ian Black Doesn&#x27;t Understand&quot;. The concept was later retooled as &quot;Michael &amp; Michael Have Issues&quot;; a pilot episode, featuring Michael Showalter, was shot in August 2008. Comedy Central confirmed in February 2009 that a seven-episode run of the show would air in July.

His first children&#x27;s book, &quot;Chicken Cheeks&quot;, was published by Simon &amp; Schuster Children&#x27;s Publishing on January 6, 2009. The book is illustrated by Kevin Hawkes. In a starred review, Kirkus called the book &quot;a perfect collaboration of text and illustration.&quot; An alternative review was aired on &quot;The Michael Showalter Showalter&quot;.

Black appeared in several Sierra Mist and Klondike commercials, as well as an eBay commercial with Showalter.

On February 21, 2009, Black instigated a &quot;Celeb-Feud&quot; — or as he called it, the &quot;World&#x27;s First Twitter War&quot; — with LeVar Burton to see if he could muster more Twitter followers than Burton. Black dubbed the feud &quot;LeWar.&quot;

===2010–present===
In 2010 Black started the podcast &quot;Mike and Tom Eat Snacks&quot; with his former &quot;Ed&quot; castmate Tom Cavanagh. Black and Meghan McCain cowrote the book &quot;America, You Sexy Bitch: A Love Letter to Freedom&quot; in June 2012. The two took a road trip across America during the summer of 2011, documenting how Americans were living.

In 2012, he starred as the host Bill Tundle in the web series &quot;Burning Love&quot;, a spoof of the TV series &quot;The Bachelor&quot; and &quot;The Bachelorette&quot;. He also co-hosted G4 TV with Candace Bailey that year. He has occasionally appeared as a guest on &quot;Red Eye with Greg Gutfeld&quot;. He stars in Adult Swim&#x27;s late night infomercial parody, &quot;You&#x27;re Whole&quot;, as Randall Tyree Mandersohn. After a guest appearance in the pilot, it was announced in 2013 that Black would join the FOX comedy &quot;Us &amp; Them&quot; in a regular role.
In 2013, he and Michael Showalter launched the podcast &quot;Topics&quot;. Alongside Jason Ritter, Alexis Bledel, and Kerri Kenney-Silver, Black appeared in the unaired 2013 Fox sitcom &quot;Us &amp; Them&quot;, a 13-episode US adaptation of the hit UK sitcom &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot;, which was canceled while the seventh episode was in production. Fox decided to not air any of the episodes. Black played the role of Brian.

He co-hosted the single-season 2013 game show &quot;Trust Me, I&#x27;m a Game Show Host&quot; alongside D.L. Hughley. He was also a co-host on &quot;Duck Quacks Don&#x27;t Echo&quot;, and one of the guest stars on the short-lived Steve Carell 2014 improv sketch show &quot;Riot&quot;. On June 11, 2014, he appeared on Ken Reid&#x27;s &quot;TV Guidance Counselor Podcast&quot;.

Black played Peepers, an uptight butler, on the Comedy Central series &quot;Another Period&quot;. He also played the role of Daniel on the TVLand series &quot;The Jim Gaffigan Show&quot;, as well as McKinley in the prequel to 2001&#x27;s &quot;Wet Hot American Summer&quot;, titled &quot;Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp&quot;.

Black hosts &quot;How to Be Amazing&quot;, an in-depth interview podcast show, produced by Black, Jennifer Brennan and Mary Shimkin. It is largely recorded at Argot Studios in New York City. In June 2017, Black recorded an episode in Los Angeles with pop star Katy Perry for her livestream marathon, &quot;Katy Perry Live: Witness World Wide&quot;.

Black appears in &quot;&quot; as Steve YouTube, the fictional germophobic creator and CEO of YouTube. The movie premiered on July 24, 2015, at VidCon 2015 in Los Angeles.

In 2018, Black began hosting a new podcast titled &quot;Obscure with Michael Ian Black&quot; in which he reads works of classic literature and makes comments about the books as he reads. In Season 1 he reads &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot; by author Thomas Hardy. In Season 2 he reads Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. In Season 3 he reads Emily Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;.

In May 2020 Black returned to a rebooted &quot;Reno 911!&quot; in a new recurring role as Captain Schwartz, named for his birthname. Schwartz is the commander of a heavily militarized parody of Hatzalah, the Jewish volunteer medical emergency service.

==Personal life==
Black married Martha Anne Hagen in 1998. They have two children, Elijah (b. 2001), and Ruthie (b. 2003). They reside in Savannah, Georgia.

Black was an atheist, but is now a &quot;reluctant deist&quot;.

<doc id="1024058" wikidata="Q2374151" url="?curid=1024058" title="Russian jokes">
<text>Russian jokes () are short fictional stories or dialogs with a punch line, which commonly appear in Russian humor. Russian joke culture includes a series of categories with fixed settings and characters. Russian jokes treat topics found everywhere in the world, including sex, politics, spousal relations, or mothers-in-law. This article discusses Russian joke subjects that are particular to Russian or Soviet culture. A major subcategory is Russian political jokes, discussed in a separate article. Every category has numerous untranslatable jokes that rely on linguistic puns, wordplay, and the Russian language vocabulary of foul language. Below, (L) marks jokes whose humor value critically depends on intrinsic features of the Russian language.
==Archetypes==

=== Named characters ===

==== Stierlitz ====
Stierlitz is a fictional Soviet intelligence officer, portrayed by Vyacheslav Tikhonov in the Soviet TV series &quot;Seventeen Moments of Spring&quot;. In the jokes, Stierlitz interacts with various characters, most prominently his nemesis Müller portrayed by Leonid Bronevoy. Usually two-liners spoofing the solemn style of the original TV voice-overs, the plot is resolved in grotesque plays on words or in parodies of the trains of thought and narrow escapes of the &quot;original&quot; Stierlitz.
* Stierlitz opens a door, and the lights go on. Stierlitz closes the door, and the lights go out. Stierlitz opens the door again; the light goes back on. Stierlitz closes the door; the light goes out again. Stierlitz deduces, &quot;It&#x27;s a refrigerator&quot;.
* Stierlitz approaches Berlin, which is veiled in smoke from widespread fires: &quot;Must have forgotten to turn off my iron,&quot; Stierlitz thought with slight irritation.
* Stierlitz wakes up in a prison cell. &quot;Which identity should I use?&quot; he wonders. &quot;Let&#x27;s see. If a person in black uniform walks in, I must be in Germany so I&#x27;ll say I&#x27;m Standartenführer Stierlitz. If they wear green uniform, I&#x27;m in the USSR so I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m Colonel Isayev&quot;. The door opens and a person in a grey uniform comes in saying, &quot;You really should ease up on vodka, Comrade Tikhonov!&quot; (grey uniform was the typical police officer&#x27;s uniform in Soviet Union since early 1970s.)

==== Poruchik Rzhevsky ====
&quot;Poruchik (Lieutenant) Dmitry Rzhevsky of the jokes is a cavalry (Hussar) officer, a straightforward, unsophisticated, and innocently rude military type whose rank and standing nevertheless gain him entrance into high society. In the jokes, he is often seen interacting with the character Natasha Rostova from the novel &quot;War and Peace&quot; by Leo Tolstoy, who would act as his opposite, showing the comedic contrast between Rzhevsky and Rostova&#x27;s behavior. The name is borrowed from a character in a musical comedy, &quot;Hussar Ballad&quot; (1962), having little in common with the folklore hero. The 1967 film rendering of &quot;War and Peace&quot; contributed to the proliferation of the Rzhevsky jokes. Some researchers point out that many jokes of this kind are versions of 19th-century Russian army jokes, retold as a new series of jokes about Rzhevsky.

Rzhevsky is often depicted as having a casual, nonchalant attitude to love and sex:
* Poruchik Rzhevsky is putting his riding boots on and is about to take leave of a charming &quot;demoiselle&quot; he had met the previous evening: &quot;&quot;Mon cher&quot; Poruchik&quot;, she intones teasingly, &quot;aren&#x27;t you forgetting about the money?&quot; Rzhevsky turns to her and says proudly: &quot;Hussars never take money!&quot; (The latter expression &quot;Gusary deneg ne berut!&quot; has become a Russian catchphrase.)

Rzhevsky is also seen giving advice to other Russian gentlemen:
* Knyaz Andrei Bolkonski asks Poruchik Rzhevsky: &quot;Tell me, Poruchik, how did you come to be so good with the ladies? What is your secret?&quot; / &quot;It&#x27;s quite &quot;simplement&quot;, &quot;mon Prince&quot;, quite &quot;simplement&quot;. I just come over and say: &#x27;Madame, would you like to fuck?&#x27;&quot; / &quot;But Poruchik, you&#x27;ll get slapped in the face for that!&quot; / &quot;&quot;Oui&quot;, most of them slap, but some of them fuck.&quot;

A series of jokes is based on a paradox of vulgarity within a high society setting:
* Natasha Rostova attends her first formal ball and dances with Pierre Bezukhov: &quot;Pierre, isn&#x27;t that grease on your collar?&quot; / &quot;Oh my, how could I miss such a terrible flaw in my costume, I&#x27;m totally destroyed!&quot; [he retreats in shame] / Then, she dances with Kniaz Bolkonsky: &quot;Andrew, isn&#x27;t there a spot of sauce on your tunic?&quot; [he faints] / Finally, she&#x27;s dancing with Rzhevsky: &quot;Poruchik, your boots are all covered in mud!&quot; / &quot;It&#x27;s not mud, it&#x27;s shit. Don&#x27;t worry, &quot;mademoiselle&quot;, it&#x27;ll fall off once it dries up.&quot;
* Poruchik Rzhevsky is dancing at a ball with a lady. He asks to be excused &quot;to go out to check on the horse&quot;. When he returns his pants are all wet. &quot;Poruchik, is it rainy outside?&quot; Asks the lady. &quot;No, m&#x27;d&#x27;mselle&quot;, Rzhevsky responds, &quot;it&#x27;s windy outside.&quot;

While successful narration of quite a few Russian jokes heavily depends on using sexual vulgarities (&quot;Russian &quot;mat&quot;&quot;), Rzhevsky, with all his vulgarity, does not use heavy &quot;mat&quot; in traditional versions of his tales. One of his favorite words is &quot;arse&quot; (which is considered rather mild among Russian vulgarities), and there is a series of jokes where Rzhevsky answers &quot;arse&quot; to some innocent question (it is typical of Rzhevsky to blurt unromantic comments in the most romantic situations):
* Poruchik Rzhevsky and Natasha Rostova are riding horses together on the countryside. &quot;Poruchik, what a beautiful meadow! Guess what I see there?&quot; / &quot;Arse, &quot;mademoiselle&quot;?&quot; / &quot;Ouch, Poruchik! I see chamomiles!&quot; (Chamomiles are Russian cliché folk flowers) / &quot;How romantic, &quot;mademoiselle&quot;! An arse amid chamomiles!...&quot;

The essence of Rzhevsky&#x27;s peculiarity is captured in the following meta-joke:
* Rzhevsky narrates his latest adventure to his Hussar comrades. &quot;...So I am riding through this dark wood and suddenly see a wide, white...&quot; / Hussars, all together: &quot;...arse!&quot; / &quot;Of course not! A glade full of chamomiles! And right in the middle there is a beautiful white...&quot; / Hussars, encore: &quot;...arse!&quot; / &quot;How vulgar of you! A mansion! So I open the door and guess what I see?&quot; / Hussars, encore: &quot;An arse!&quot; / Poruchik, genuinely surprised: &quot;How did you guess? Did I tell this story before?&quot;

This theme culminates in the following joke, sometimes called &quot;the ultimate Hussar joke&quot;:
* Countess Maria Bolkonskaya celebrates her 50th anniversary, the whole local Hussar regiment is invited, and the Countess boasts about the gifts she has received: &quot;Cornet Obolensky presented me a lovely set of 50 Chinese fragrant candles. I loved them so much that I immediately stuck them into the seven 7-branch candlesticks you see on the table. Such auspicious numbers! Unfortunately there is a single candle left, and I don&#x27;t know where to stick it...&quot; / The whole Hussar regiment takes a deep breath... but the Hussar colonel barks out: &quot;Hussars!!! Silence!!!&quot; (&quot;Гусары, молчать!&quot; has become a catchphrase too.)

==== Rabinovich ====
Rabinovich is a typical Russian Jewish surname of a protagonist of Jewish jokes in Soviet Union.
* Rabinovich fills out a job application form. The official is skeptical: &quot;You stated that you don&#x27;t have any relatives abroad, but you do have a brother in Israel.&quot; / &quot;Yes, but &quot;he&quot; isn&#x27;t abroad, &quot;I&quot; am abroad!&quot;
* Seeing a pompous and lavish burial of a member of the Politburo, Rabinovich sadly shakes his head: &quot;What a waste! With this kind of money, I could have buried the entire Politburo!&quot;
* Rabinovich calls Pamyat headquarters, speaking with a characteristic accent: &quot;Tell me, is it true that Jews sold out Russia?&quot; / &quot;Yes, of course it&#x27;s true, you &quot;Kike-schnabel&quot;!&quot; / &quot;Oh good! Could you please tell me where I should go to get my share?&quot;
* The census taker comes to the Rabinovich house: &quot;Does Abram Rabinovich live here?&quot; / &quot;No&quot; / &quot;Well, then, comrade, what is your name?&quot; / &quot;Abram Rabinovich.&quot; / &quot;Wait a minute-didn&#x27;t you just tell me that Rabinovich doesn&#x27;t live here?&quot; / &quot;Aha,&quot; &quot;You call this living?&quot;
The following example explains Vladimir Putin&#x27;s remark about &quot;Comrade Wolf&quot;, describing the policies of the United States, that many non-Russians found cryptic. In a reference to the US-led invasion of Iraq Putin said: &quot;As they say, &#x27;comrade wolf knows whom to eat.&#x27; He eats without listening and he is clearly not going to listen to anyone.&quot;
* Rabinovich is walking through the forest with a sheep, when both of them stumble into a pit. A few minutes later, a wolf also falls into the pit. The sheep gets nervous and starts bleating. Rabinovich says, &quot;What&#x27;s with all the &quot;baaahh, baaahh&quot;? Comrade Wolf knows whom to eat.&quot;

==== Vovochka ====
Vovochka is the Russian equivalent of &quot;Little Johnny&quot;. He interacts with his school teacher, Maria Ivanovna (shortened to &quot;Marivanna&quot;, a stereotypical female teacher&#x27;s name). &quot;Vovochka&quot; is a diminutive form of &quot;Vova&quot;, which in turn is a shortened version of &quot;Vladimir&quot;, creating the &quot;little boy&quot; effect. His fellow students bear similarly diminutive names. This &quot;little boy&quot; name is used in contrast with Vovochka&#x27;s wisecracking, adult, often obscene statements.
* In biology class, the teacher draws a cucumber on the blackboard: &quot;Children, could someone tell me what is this?&quot; / Vovochka raises his hand: &quot;It&#x27;s a dick, Marivanna!&quot; The teacher bursts into tears and runs out. / Shortly, the principal rushes in: &quot;All right, what did you do now? Which one of you brought Maria Ivanovna to tears? And who the hell drew that dick on the blackboard?&quot;
* The teacher asks the class to produce a word that starts with the letter &quot;A&quot;: Vovochka happily raises his hand and says &quot;Arse!&quot; (&quot;&quot; in the original) / The teacher, shocked, responds &quot;For shame! There&#x27;s no such word!&quot; / &quot;That&#x27;s strange,&quot; says Vovochka thoughtfully, &quot;the arse exists, but the word doesn&#x27;t!&quot; (The last phrase is attributed to Ivan Baudouin de Courtenay, linguist and lexicographer.)
* After March 26, all jokes about Vovochka are considered political. (In reference to elections of Vladimir Putin as President of Russia).

==== Vasily Ivanovich ====

Vasily Ivanovich Chapayev, a Red Army hero of the Russian Civil War, in the rank of Division Commander, was featured in a 1934 biopic. The most common topics are the war with the monarchist White Army, Chapayev&#x27;s futile attempts to enroll into the Frunze Military Academy, and the circumstances of Chapayev&#x27;s death (officially, he was gunned down by the Whites and drowned while attempting to flee across the Ural River after a lost battle).

Chapayev is usually accompanied by his &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; Petka (Петька, &quot;Pete&quot;), as well as Anka the Machine-Gunner (Анка-пулемётчица), and political commissar Furmanov, all based on real people. (Being well known in Russian popular culture, Chapayev, Petka, and Anka were featured in a series of Russian adventure games released in the late 1990s and 2000s.)
* &quot;I flunked my history exam, Petka. They asked me who Caesar was, and I said he&#x27;s a stallion from our 7th cavalry squadron.&quot; / &quot;It&#x27;s all my fault, Vasily Ivanovich! While you were away, I reassigned him to the 6th!&quot;
* Chapayev, Petka, and Anka, in hiding from the Whites, are crawling plastoon-style across a field: Anka first, then Petka, and Chapayev is last. / Petka says to Anka, &quot;Anka, you lied about your proletarian descent! Your mother must have been a ballerina – your legs are so fine!&quot; / Chapayev responds, &quot;And your father, Petka, must have been a plowman – the furrow you&#x27;re leaving behind you is so deep!&quot;
* On the occasion of an anniversary of the October Revolution, Furmanov gives a political lecture to the rank and file soldiers: &quot;...And now we are on our glorious way to the shining horizons of Communism!&quot; / &quot;How did it go?&quot;, Chapayev asks Petka afterwards. &quot;Exciting!... but unclear. What the hell is a horizon?&quot; / &quot;See Petka, it is a line you may see far away in the steppe when the weather is good. And it&#x27;s a tricky oneno matter how long you ride towards it, you&#x27;ll never reach it. You&#x27;ll only wear down your horse.&quot;
* See also under Fantômas below.

==== Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson ====
A number of jokes involve characters from the short stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle about the private detective Sherlock Holmes and his friend Doctor Watson. The jokes appeared and became popular soon after &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson&quot; film series was broadcast on Soviet TV in the late 1970s to mid-1980s, starring Vasily Livanov as Sherlock Holmes and Vitaly Solomin as Watson. Lines from these films are usually included in the jokes («Элементарно, Ватсон!» – &quot;Elementary, my dear Watson!&quot;). The narrator of the joke usually tries to mimic Livanov&#x27;s husky voice. The standard plot of these jokes is a short dialog where Watson naïvely wonders about something, and Holmes finds a &quot;logical&quot; explanation to the phenomenon in question. Occasionally the jokes also include other characters – Mrs Hudson, the landlady of Holmes&#x27;s residence on Baker Street; or Sir Henry and his butler Barrymore from &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;; or the detective&#x27;s nemesis Professor Moriarty.
* Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson go on a camping trip. They pitch their tent under the stars and go to sleep. Sometime in the middle of the night, Holmes wakes Watson up and says: &quot;Watson, look up, and tell me what you see.&quot; / &quot;I see millions and millions of stars.&quot; / &quot;And what do you deduce from that?&quot; / &quot;Well, if there are millions of stars, and if even a few of those have planets, it&#x27;s quite likely there are some planets like Earth out there. And if there are a few planets like Earth out there, there might also be life.&quot; / &quot;Watson, you idiot, it means that somebody stole our tent!&quot;

==== Fantômas ====
Some older jokes involve Fantômas, a fictional criminal and master of disguise from the French detective series, a character once widely popular in the USSR. His arch-enemy is Inspector Juve, charged with catching him. Fantômas&#x27; talent for disguise is usually the focus of the joke, allowing for jokes featuring all sorts of other characters:
* From the days when Prime Minister Golda Meir led Israel: Fantômas sneaks into Mao Zedong&#x27;s private chamber as the latter is on his deathbed, and respectfully removes his mask. / Mao muses: &quot;Well, Comrade Petka, fate sure does have a way of scattering friends all over the world, doesn&#x27;t it?&quot; / &quot;Ah, if you only knew, Vasily Ivanovich, what our Anka has been up to in Israel!&quot;

==== Bogatyrs ====

Bogatyrs are heroes of Russian folk tales: impossibly strong and brave warriors, but often portrayed in jokes as arrogant, cunning and cruel. The three bogatyrs are usually Ilya Muromets, Alyosha Popovich, Dobrynya Nikitich or a combination thereof; the jokes often include other folk characters (such as Baba Yaga, Koschei or Gorynych) and enemies of Rus (most often the Golden Horde), usually defeated by the end of the joke. As with most other jokes, most of these are not meant for children despite folk characters associated with kids&#x27; fairy tales.
* Three bogatyrs clash with the Three Musketeers over a petty dispute; of course, d&#x27;Artagnan challenges Ilya to a duel. Aramis, as d&#x27;Artagnan&#x27;s second, marks Ilya&#x27;s heart with a chalk: &quot;It is here that my friend chevalier d&#x27;Artagnan will have the honour to pierce you with his épée!&quot;. Ilya looks at his mace, then at d&#x27;Artagnan, then says to Alyosha Popovich: &quot;Alyosha, be kind, dust this chevalier with chalk from head to toe.&quot;
* The steppe army approaches the border of Rus&#x27; and sees the outpost hut. The military leader shouts: &quot;Russians, come out!&quot; A sleepy Dobrynya Nikitich comes out of the hut: &quot;What do you need?&quot; — &quot;We have come to conquer you!&quot; — &quot;And how many are you?&quot; — &quot;We are thousands of thousands!&quot; Dobrynya, bewildered: &quot;Good grief, who is going to bury such a crowd?!&quot;

==== Armenian Radio ====
A large number of Russian jokes begin with the words &quot;The Armenian Radio was asked a question...&quot; The answer from the Armenian Radio always turns out to be unexpected and discouraging.

=== Animals ===
Jokes set in the animal kingdom also feature characters rooted in old Slavic fairy tales, where animals are portrayed as sapient beings with a stereotypical behavior, such as the violent Wolf; the sneaky Fox; the cocky, cowardly Hare; the strong, simple-minded Bear; the multi-dimensional Hedgehog; and the Lion, king of the animal kingdom. In the Russian language all objects, animate and inanimate, have a (grammatical) gender – masculine, feminine, or neuter. The reader should assume that the Wolf, the Bear, the Hare, the Lion, and the Hedgehog are males, whereas the Fox (Vixen) is a female:
* The Bear, the Wolf and the Vixen are playing cards. The Wolf warns, shuffling: &quot;No cheating! If anyone is cheating, her smug red-furred face is going to hurt!&quot;

Animals in Russian jokes are and were very well aware of politics in the realm of humans:
* A bunch of animals including the Cock are in prison bragging about why they were sent there. The Cock doesn&#x27;t take part in this. Someone asks: &quot;And what are you in for?&quot; / &quot;I am not talking to you, criminals. I am a political prisoner!&quot; / &quot;How come?&quot; / &quot;I pecked a Young Pioneer in the arse!&quot;

Animal jokes are often fables, i.e. their punchline is (or eventually becomes) a kind of a maxim.
* The Hare runs like crazy through a forest and meets the Wolf. The Wolf asks: &quot;What&#x27;s the matter? Why such haste?&quot; / &quot;The camels there are caught and shod!&quot; The Wolf says: &quot;But you&#x27;re not a camel!&quot; / &quot;Hey, after you are caught and shod, just you try to prove to them that you are not a camel!&quot;
This joke is suggested to be an origin of the popular Russian saying &quot;try to prove you are not a camel&quot; in the sense &quot;try to prove something to someone who doesn&#x27;t want to listen&quot;, used in relation to violations of the presumption of innocence by Russian law enforcement agencies, or when someone has to fight the bureaucracy to get official papers proving that one has lost a leg or is even alive. The Hare and the joke itself were used to illustrate the hassles of a Soviet &quot;lishenets&quot; in a 1929 issue of a satirical magazine &quot;Chudak&quot;. Mikhail Melnichenko, in an article about Soviet political jokes, cites a 1926 private collection, which renders the joke in a more gruesome form, where the Hare is scared of the rumor that all camels are taken hostages by Cheka and shot (a reference to the Red Terror). Later Melnichenko in his book &quot;Coветский анекдот. Указатель сюжетов&quot; reports an earlier version, a record of a censored sketch of the comic duo Bim Bom. A similar parable was told by a 13th-century Persian poet and Sufi Jalal ad-Din Rumi, in which a person was scared to be taken for a donkey and skinned. Ben Lewis in his &quot;Hammer &amp; Tickle&quot; cites yet another version: a flock of sheep seek refuge in Finland because Beria ordered an arrest of all elephants (an allusion to the sweeping national operations of the NKVD) and they have no chance to explain the difference to Beria. Lewis traces it to &quot;a Persian poet in 12th-century Arabia, where it involves a fox running away from a royal ordinance that in theory applies only to donkeys.&quot;

====Golden Fish====
Aside from mammals, a rather common non-human is the &quot;Golden Fish&quot;, who asks the catcher to release her in exchange for three wishes. The first Russian instance of this appeared in Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s &quot;The Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish&quot;. In jokes, the Fisherman may be replaced by a representative of a nationality or ethnicity, and the third wish usually makes the punch line of the joke.
* An American, a Frenchman and a Russian are alone on an uninhabited island. They catch fish for food and suddenly catch a Golden Fish, who promises to fulfill two wishes for each in trade for her own freedom:&lt;br&gt;The American: &quot;A million dollars and to go back home!&quot;&lt;br&gt;The Frenchman: &quot;Three beautiful women and to go back home!&quot;&lt;br&gt;The Russian: &quot;Tsk, and we were getting along so well. Three crates of vodka and the two fellas back!&quot;
** Side Note: This joke is a play on the fact that in Russia it is believed that three is the optimal number of people for drinking. This in turn goes back to when in the Soviet Union a bottle of vodka cost 2.87 roubles, 3 roubles being a convenient price for three men to buy a bottle and have 13 kopecks left for a snack. The classic for the latter was a rectangular pack of soft processed cheese &quot;Druzhba&quot; (Friendship), with that exact price. Therefore, a natural company is 3, each contributing 1 rouble. This procedure was dubbed &quot;to have arranged for three (persons)&quot; (; &quot;soobrazit&#x27; na troikh&quot;, literal translation: &quot;to have figured out for three&quot;). Much of Soviet folklore is based on this interpretation of the &quot;magic of the number 3&quot;.

A similar type of joke involves a wish-granting Genie, the main difference being that in the case of the Golden Fish the Fisherman suffers from his own stupidity or greed, while the Genie is known for ingeniously twisting an interpretation of the wish to frustrate the grantee.
* A man finds an old bottle, picks it up and opens it. The Genie comes out of the bottle and says: &quot;Thanks so much for letting me out! I feel I should do something for you, too. Would you like to become a Hero of the Soviet Union?&quot; (Hero of the Soviet Union was the highest Soviet award). The guy says: &quot;Yes, sure!&quot; Next thing he knows, he finds himself on a battlefield with four grenades, alone against six German panzers.

=== Drunkards ===
* A drunkard takes a leak by a lamp pole in the street. A policeman tries to reason with him: &quot;Can&#x27;t you see the latrine is just 25 feet away?&quot; The drunkard replies: &quot;Do you think I&#x27;ve got a fire hose in my trousers?&quot;
* Drunk #1 is slowly walking, bracing himself against a fence and stumbling. He comes across Drunk #2, who is lying in mud across the street. &quot;What a disgrace! Lying around like a pig! I&#x27;m ashamed for you.&quot; / &quot;You just keep on walking, demagogue! We&#x27;ll see what you&#x27;re gonna do when you run out of your fence too!&quot;
* During the anti-alcohol campaign two drunkards agreed on a special code: &quot;book&quot; means &quot;vodka&quot;, &quot;newspaper&quot; means &quot;beer&quot;, etc. So, this is how their chat goes: &quot;Shit, newspapers are out of stock since early morning, the library opens only at 11am...&quot; The second one cuts in: &quot;To hell with the books, come over quickly: uncle Ivan brought some manuscripts from the village!&quot;

=== Policemen ===
These often revolve around the supposition that the vast majority of Russian and Soviet &quot;militsioners&quot; (policemen, now called &quot;politzia&quot;) accept bribes. Also, they are not considered to be very bright.
* Three prizes were awarded for the successes in a Socialist competition of the Traffic Inspection Department #18. The third prize is the &quot;Complete Works&quot; of Vladimir Lenin. The second prize is 100 roubles and a ticket to Sochi... The first prize is a portable stop sign. (There are several versions with this punch line about the stop sign, which is a Soviet peculiarity. A portable stop sign allowed the &quot;militsioner&quot; to put it in an unexpected or hard-to-see place on a road, to fine everyone passing it, and to appropriate most of the fines for himself. One such joke: The policeman asked his supervisor for a raise and got the reply, &quot;I cannot give you a raise, but I can give you a stop sign.&quot;)
* A person on a bus tells a joke: &quot;Do you know why policemen always go in pairs?&quot; / &quot;No, why?&quot; / &quot;It&#x27;s specialization: one knows how to read, the other knows how to write.&quot; / A hand promptly grabs him by the shoulder – a policeman is standing right behind him! / &quot;Your papers!&quot; he barks. The hapless person surrenders his official papers. / The policeman opens them, reads, and nods to his partner: &quot;Write him a citation for slandering the Soviet &quot;Militsiya&quot;, Vasya&quot;. (A version of this joke involves a third policeman whose sole job is in turn to watch over these two dangerously literate intellectuals.)

=== Ethnic stereotypes ===
Imperial Russia had been multi-ethnic for many centuries, and this situation continued throughout the Soviet period, and continues still. Throughout history, several ethnic stereotypes have developed, often in common with those views by other ethnicities (usually except for the ethnicity in question, but not always).

====Chukchi====

Chukchi (singular Chukcha), the native people of Chukotka, the most remote northeast corner of Russia, are a common minority targeted for generic ethnic jokes in Russia. They are depicted as primitive, uncivilized, and simple-minded, but clever in their own way. A propensity for saying &quot;odnako&quot; (Russian for &quot;however&quot;, depending on context) is a staple of Chukcha jokes. The straight man part of Chukcha jokes is often a Russian geologist.
* &quot;Chukcha, why did you buy a fridge, if it&#x27;s so cold on the tundra?&quot; &quot;Why, is −50° Celsius outside &quot;yaranga&quot;, is −10° inside, is −5° in fridge – warm place, &quot;odnako&quot;!&quot;
* A Chukcha comes into a shop and asks: &quot;Do you have color TVs?&quot; &quot;Yes, we do.&quot; &quot;Give me a green one.&quot;
* A Chukcha applies for membership in the Union of Soviet Writers. He is asked what literature he is familiar with. &quot;Have you read Pushkin?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Have you read Dostoevsky?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Can you read at all?&quot; The Chukcha, offended, replies, &quot;Chukcha not reader, Chukcha writer!&quot; (The last phrase has become a cliché in Russian culture, hinting at happy or militant ignorance.)

Chukchi do not miss their chance to offer a retort.
* A Chukcha and a Russian geologist go hunting polar bears. They eventually track one down. Seeing the bear, the Chukcha shouts, &quot;Run!&quot; and flees. The Russian shrugs, calmly raises his gun, and shoots the bear. &quot;Russian hunter, bad hunter!&quot;, the Chukcha exclaims. &quot;Ten kilometres to the &quot;yaranga&quot;, you haul this bear yourself!&quot;

Chukchi, due to their innocence, often see the inner truth of situations.
* A Chukcha returning home from Moscow is met with great excitement and interest from his friends. &quot;What is socialism like?&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; begins the Chukcha in awe, &quot;There, everything is for the betterment of man... I even saw that man himself!&quot; (This references the Communist slogan &quot;Всё для блага человека!&quot;, &quot;Everything for the betterment of man.&quot; The &quot;man himself&quot; is usually interpreted as either Lenin in the Mausoleum or whoever was the general secretary at the time, depending on when and where the joke was told.)

====Ukrainians====

Ukrainians are depicted as rustic, stingy, and inordinately fond of salted &quot;salo&quot; (pork back fat); their accent, which is imitated, is perceived as funny.
* A Ukrainian tourist is questioned at international customs: &quot;Are you carrying any weapons or drugs?&quot; &quot;What are drugs?&quot; &quot;They make you get high.&quot; &quot;Yes, &quot;salo&quot;.&quot; &quot;But &quot;salo&quot; is not a drug.&quot; &quot;When I eat &quot;salo&quot;, I get high!&quot;
* A Ukrainian is asked, &quot;Can you eat a kilo of apples?&quot; &quot;Yes, I can.&quot; &quot;Can you eat two kilos of apples?&quot; &quot;I can.&quot; &quot;And five kilos?&quot; &quot;I can.&quot; &quot;Can you eat 100 kilos?!&quot; &quot;What I cannot eat, I will nibble!&quot;

Ukrainians are perceived as having a grudge against Russians (derided as &quot;Moskali&quot; by Ukrainians).
* The Soviet Union has launched the first man into space. A Hutsul shepherd, standing on top of a hill, shouts over to another shepherd on another hill to tell him the news. &quot;Mykola!&quot; &quot;Yes!&quot; &quot;The &quot;moskali&quot; have flown to space!&quot; &quot;All of them?&quot; &quot;No, just one.&quot; &quot;So why are you bothering me, then?&quot; (An oral version may end at the &quot;all of them&quot; sentence, said in a hopeful tone).

==== Georgians ====

Georgians are usually depicted as stupid, greedy, hot-blooded, or addicted to sex and sometimes all four. A very loud and theatrical Georgian accent, including grammatical errors considered typical of Georgians, and occasional Georgian words are considered funny to imitate in Russian and often becomes a joke in itself.

In some jokes, Georgians are portrayed as rich, because in Soviet times they were also perceived as profiting from black market businesses. There is a humorous expression deriving from the custom in police reports of referring to them as &quot;persons of Caucasian ethnicity&quot; (). Since the Russian word for &quot;person&quot; in the formal sense, (), is the same as the word for &quot;face&quot;, this allows a play on words about &quot;faces of Caucasian ethnicity&quot;. In Russia itself, most people see &quot;persons of Caucasian ethnicity&quot; mostly at marketplaces selling fruits and flowers. Later on, many old jokes about rich Georgians were being recast in terms of &quot;New Russians&quot;.
* A plane takes off from the Tbilisi airport. A passenger storms the pilot&#x27;s cabin, waving an AK-47 rifle and demanding that the flight be diverted to Israel. The pilot shrugs in agreement, but suddenly the hijacker&#x27;s head falls off his shoulders, and a Georgian pops from behind with a blood-drenched dagger, and a huge suitcase: &quot;Lisss&#x27;n here &quot;genatsvale&quot;: No any Israel-Misrael. Fly Moscow nonstop – my roses are wilting!&quot;
* In a zoo, two girls are discussing a gorilla with a huge penis.&quot;That&#x27;s what a real man must have!&quot; A Georgian passer-by remarks, sardonically, &quot;You are badly mistaken, it&#x27;s not a man, it is a male. &quot;This&quot; is what a real man must have!&quot; He produces a thick wallet.

==== Estonians and Finns ====
Estonians and Finns are depicted as humorless, stubborn, taciturn, and slow. The Estonian accent, especially its sing-song tune and the lack of genders in grammar, forms part of the humor. The Estonian common usage of long vowels and consonants both in speech and orthography (e.g. words such as Tallinn, Saaremaa) also led to the stereotype of being slow in speech, thinking, and action. In the everyday life, a person may be derisively called a &quot;hot-headed Estonian fellow&quot; (or in similar spirit, a &quot;hot-tempered Finnish bloke&quot;, a phrase popularized by the 1995 Russian comedy &quot;Peculiarities of the National Hunt&quot;) to emphasize tardiness or lack of temperament. Indeed, Estonians play a similar role in Soviet humor to that of Finns in Scandinavian jokes.

Finnish political scientist Ilmari Susiluoto, also an author of three books on Russian humor, writes that Finns and Russians understand each other&#x27;s humor. &quot;Being included in a Russian anecdote is a privilege that Danes or Dutchmen have not attained. These nations are too boring and unvaried to rise into the consciousness of a large country. But the funny and slightly silly, stubborn Finns, the &quot;Chukhnas&quot; do.&quot;
* An Estonian stands by a railway track. Another Estonian passes by on a handcar, pushing the pump up and down. The first one asks, &quot;Iis iitt a llonngg wwayy ttoo Ttallinn?&quot; &quot;Nnoot ttoo llonngg.&quot; He gets on the car and joins pushing the pump up and down. After two hours of silent pumping the first Estonian asks again: &quot;Iis iitt a llonngg wwayy ttoo Ttallinn?&quot;&quot;&quot;Nnnoooowww&quot; iiitt iiiis llonngg wwayy.&quot;
* &quot;I told some Estonian blokes that they&#x27;re slow.&quot; &quot;What did they reply?&quot; &quot;Nothing, but they beat me up the following day.&quot;
* A Finnish family – the parents and two brothers – take car into countryside. An animal crosses the road in front of the car and runs away into the forest. An hour later one brother says, &quot;It is a fox!&quot; Two hours later, the second brother says: &quot;No, it is a wolf!&quot; Three hours later, the father replies: &quot;Well, why don&#x27;t you have a fight, you hot-headed Finnish guys!&quot;
* Two Finns are sitting near a road. Suddenly, a car passes in a blur. Half an hour later, one Finn asks: &quot;Whaaat waaaaas thaaaat?&quot; Half an hour after that, the other replies: &quot;Thaaaat waaaas Miiiiiiiikaaaa Häaaaaakkiiiiiiineeeeeen, the shaaaame of the Fiiiiinniiish naaaaation&quot;

Finns share with Chukchi their ability to withstand cold.
* At −10 °C, the heat is switched on in British homes, while Finns change into a long-sleeved shirt. At −20°, Austrians fly to Málaga, while Finns celebrate midsummer. At −200°, hell freezes over and Finland wins the Eurovision Song Contest. (This joke predates the event, previously deemed impossible, of Finland winning the contest, which happened in 2006.) At −273°, absolute zero temperature is reached, and all atomic movement ceases. The Finns shrug and say: &quot;Perkele, a bit chilly today, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;.

====Jews====
Jewish humor is a highly developed subset of Russian humor, largely based on the self-image of Russian Jews. The Jewish self-deprecating anecdotes are not the same as anti-Semitic jokes. 
Instead, whether told by Jews or non-Jewish Russians, these jokes show cynicism, self-irony, and wit that is characteristic of Jewish humor both in Russia and elsewhere in the world (see Jewish humor). The jokes are usually told with a characteristic Jewish accent (stretching out syllables, parodying the uvular trill of &quot;R&quot;, etc.) and some peculiarities of sentence structure calqued into Russian from Yiddish. Many of these jokes are set in Odesa, and to some extent the phrase &quot;Odesa humor&quot; is synonymous with &quot;Jewish jokes,&quot; even if the characters don&#x27;t have Jewish names and even their religion/ethnicity is never mentioned.
* Abram cannot sleep, tossing and turning from side to side... Finally his wife Sarah inquires: &quot;Abram, what&#x27;s bothering you?&quot; &quot;I owe Moishe 20 roubles, but I have no money. What shall I do?&quot; Sarah bangs on the flimsy wall and shouts to the neighbors: &quot;Moishe! My Abram still owes you 20 roubles? Well he isn&#x27;t giving them back!&quot; Turning to her husband, she says reassuringly: &quot;Now go to sleep and let Moishe stay awake!&quot;
* An Odesa Jew meets another one. &quot;Have you heard, Einstein has won the Nobel Prize?&quot; &quot;Oy, what for?&quot; &quot;He developed this relativity theory.&quot; &quot;Yeah, what&#x27;s that?&quot; &quot;Well, you know, five hairs on your head is relatively few. Five hairs in your soup is relatively many.&quot; &quot;And for that he gets the Nobel Prize?!&quot;
* A Red Guardsman pounds on Abram&#x27;s door. / He answers through the door: &quot;Yes?&quot; / &quot;Abram, we&#x27;ve come for everything precious.&quot; Abram thinks for a moment, and calls out, &quot;Rosa, my precious, someone&#x27;s here for you!&quot;

During the 1967 Arab–Israeli War sympathies of the ordinary Soviet people were on the side of Israel despite Egypt under Nasser being officially a Soviet ally, &quot;on the Socialist path of development&quot;.
* A quiet time at the Egypt-Israel frontline. A Jew shouts, &quot;Hey, Abdullah!&quot; A head pops up. &quot;What do you want?&quot; — and catches a bullet. Now an Egyptian shouts, &quot;Hey, Abraham!&quot; — &quot;Who asked Abraham?&quot; A head pops up. &quot;It&#x27;s me, Abdullah!&quot; — and catches a bullet.
The above joke is in part based on the common stereotype about Jews that they answer a question with a question.

====Chinese====

Common jokes center on the enormous size of the Chinese population, the Chinese language and the perceptions of the Chinese as cunning, industrious, and hard-working. Other jokes revolve around the belief that the Chinese are capable of amazing feats by primitive means, such as the Great Leap Forward.
* &quot;During the Damansky Island incident the Chinese military developed three main strategies: The Great Offensive, The Small Retreat, and Infiltration by Small Groups of One to Two Million Across the Border&quot;.
* In another joke of that time, China developed a strategy to capture all the Soviet Union (or United States, or Japan, etc.): 1. Declare a war. 2. Order soldiers to surrender, ALL of them at once.
* When a child is born in a wealthy Chinese family, there is an ancient tradition: a silver spoon is dropped onto the jade floor. The sound the spoon makes will be the name of the newborn. (see Chinese names)
* The initial report on the first Chinese human spaceflight: &quot;All systems operational, boiler-men on duty!&quot;

A good many of the jokes are puns based on the fact that a widespread Chinese syllable (written as &quot;hui&quot; in pinyin) looks very similar to the obscene Russian word for penis. For this reason, since about 1956 the Russian-Chinese dictionaries render the Russian transcription of this syllable as &quot;хуэй&quot; (&quot;huey&quot;) (which actually is closer to the correct Standard Chinese pronunciation). The most embarrassing case for the Chinese-Soviet friendship probably is the word &quot;socialism&quot; (社会主义; pinyin: &quot;shè huì zhǔ yì&quot;), rendered previously as шэ-хуй-чжу-и. The following humorous possibilities for the misunderstanding of the Chinese syllable &quot;hui&quot; are derived from Aarons&#x27;s (2012) text:
* A new Chinese ambassador is to meet Gromyko. When the latter enters, the Chinese presents himself: &quot;Zhui Hui!&quot; Gromyko, unperturbed, retorts &quot;Zhui sam!&quot; The surprised Chinese asks: &quot;And where is Gromyko?&quot; (The pun is that &quot;zhui hui&quot; (a mock Chinese name) means &quot;chew a dick&quot; in Russian and &quot;zhui sam&quot; means &quot;chew [it] yourself&quot;). 
* Сунь Хуй в Чай Вынь Пей Сам, &quot;Sun&#x27; Huy v Chay Vyn&#x27; Pey Sam&quot;, (literally meaning &quot;Dip [your] penis into tea, withdraw [and] drink [it], yourself&quot;) is a made-up &quot;Chinese name&quot; that is analogous to the English &quot;Who Flung Dung&quot;. A suitable English interpretation sounds like &quot;Dip Dick Tea, Back, You Drink&quot;. There is another variation of this joke about two Chinese persons: Сунь Хуй в Чай (&quot;Sun&#x27; Huy v Chay&quot;) and Вынь Су Хим (&quot;Vyn&#x27; Su Him&quot;), which can be translated as &quot;Dip [your] penis into tea&quot;, and &quot;Take [it] out dry&quot;, where a word &quot;сухим&quot; (&quot;suhim&quot;, meaning &quot;dry&quot;) is divided into two syllables &quot;су&quot; (&quot;su&quot;) and &quot;хим&quot; (&quot;him&quot;).
* A subset of name-based jokes use the reverse, implying direct Soviet participation in Korean war. Usually &quot;Chinese&quot; pilot Lee See Tsyn is mentioned, being an easily recognizable Russian family name Лисицын (Lisitsyn, from Лисица – &quot;vixen&quot; in Russian). Some versions also include pilots Ku Ree Tsyn, See Nee Tsyn, and Tu Pee Tsyn. These are respectively Курицин, from курица (&quot;hen&quot;), Синицын (синица, &quot;titmouse&quot;), and Тупицын (тупица, &quot;dumb one&quot;).

==== Russians ====
Russians are a stereotype in Russian jokes themselves when set next to other stereotyped ethnicities. Thus, the Russian appearing in a triple joke with two Westerners, German, French, American or Englishman, will provide for a self-ironic punchline depicting himself as simple-minded and negligently careless but physically robust, which often ensures that he retains the upper hand over his less naive Western counterparts. Another common plot is a Russian participating in a contest with technologically-superior opponents (usually, an American and a German or a Japanese) and winning with sheer brute force or a clever trick.
* A Frenchman, a German, and a Russian go on a safari and are captured by cannibals. They are brought to the chief, who says, &quot;We are going to eat you right now. But I am a civilized man, I studied human rights at the Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, so I&#x27;ll grant each of you a last request.&quot; The German asks for a mug of beer and a bratwurst. He gets it, and then the cannibals eat him. The Frenchman asks for three girls. He has crazy sex with them, and then suffers the fate of the German. The Russian demands: &quot;Hit me hard, right on my nose!&quot; The chief is surprised, but hits him. The Russian pulls out a Kalashnikov and shoots all the cannibals. The mortally-wounded chief asks him: &quot;Why didn&#x27;t you do this before we ate the German?&quot; The Russian proudly replies: &quot;Russians are not aggressors!&quot; (This joke has also been used as a Jewish joke; more specifically, as an Israeli joke, alluding to Israel&#x27;s being constantly afraid of being seen as the &quot;aggressor&quot;.)
* A Chukcha sits on the shore of the Bering Strait. An American submarine surfaces. The American captain opens the hatch and asks: &quot;Which way is Alaska?&quot; The Chukcha points his finger: &quot;That way!&quot; / &quot;Thanks!&quot; says the American, shouts &quot;South-South-East, bearing 159.5 degrees!&quot; down the hatch and the submarine submerges. Ten minutes later, a Soviet submarine emerges. The Russian captain opens the hatch and asks the Chukcha: &quot;Where did the American submarine go?&quot; The Chukcha replies: &quot;South-South-East bearing 159.5 degrees!&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t be a smart-ass&quot;, says the captain, &quot;just point your finger!&quot;
* A Frenchman, a Japanese, and a Russian are captured by an alien. He locks them in cells and demands that they amaze him using two steel balls – the winner will be released, the others will be executed. A week later, the Frenchman demonstrates a juggling trick with the balls. The Japanese has created a rock garden. However the Russian is declared winner: he broke one ball, and lost another one.

==Jokes from &quot;vicious nineties&quot;==
&quot;Vicious 90s&quot; (:ru:Лихие девяностые) refers to the period of transition from communism to &quot;jungle capitalism&quot; in the history of Russia, characterized by the rise of Russian oligarchs accompanied with the growing poverty of common people and banditism.
* Will your bank give a loan for my word of honor?&quot;
:&quot;No problem...&quot;
:&quot;And what if I don&#x27;t return it?&quot;
:&quot;Then you will be ashamed when you appear before the Almighty.&quot;
:&quot;But that’s far in the future, right?&quot;
:&quot;If you don’t return it on the fifth, on the sixth you will meet Him.&quot;
* In the cloakroom of a theatre: &quot;Would you like binoculars?&quot; – &quot;No, thanks, I have a laser sight.&quot;
=== New Russians ===
New Russians (Russian: новые русские, &quot;Novye Russkie&quot;, the &quot;nouveau-riche&quot;), a rich class of businessmen and gangsters in post-&quot;perestroika&quot;, were a very common category of characters in Russian jokes of the 1990s. A common theme is the interaction of a New Russian in his archetypal shiny black Mercedes S600, arguing with a regular Russian in his modest Soviet-era Zaporozhets after their vehicles collide. The New Russian is often a violent criminal or at least speaks criminal argot, with a number of neologisms (or common words with skewed meaning) typical among New Russians. In a way, these anecdotes are a continuation of the Soviet-era series about Georgians, who were then depicted as extremely wealthy. The physical stereotype of the New Russians is often that of overweight men with short haircuts, dressed in thick gold chains and crimson jackets, with their fingers in the horns gesture, cruising around in the &quot;600 Merc&quot; and showing off their wealth. Jokes about expensive foreign sports cars can be compared to German Manta jokes.
* A New Russian&#x27;s son complains to his father: &quot;Daddy, all my schoolmates are riding the bus, and I look like a black sheep in this 600 Merc.&quot; / &quot;No worries, son. I&#x27;ll buy you a bus, and you&#x27;ll ride like everyone else!&quot;
* A New Russian&#x27;s son complains to his father: &quot;Daddy, I&#x27;ve met a beautiful girl, but she agrees to walk with me only if I have Mercedes and 3-floor house&quot; – &quot;Okay, son, I&#x27;m ready to buy you Mercedes if she doesn&#x27;t like your Ferrari, but not to demolish two floors of our house for this foolish girl!&quot;
* A New Russian brags to his colleague: &quot;Look at my new tie. I bought it for 500 dollars in the store over there.&quot; / &quot;You were conned. You could have paid &quot;twice as much&quot; for the same one just across the street!&quot;

== Linguistic quirks ==
Like elsewhere in the world, a good many of jokes in Russia are based on puns. Other jokes depend on grammatical and linguistic oddities and irregularities in the Russian language:
* (L) The genitive plural of a noun (used with a numeral to indicate five or more of something, as opposed to the dual, used for two, three, or four, see Russian nouns) is a rather unpredictable form of the Russian noun, and there are a handful of words which even native speakers have trouble producing this form of (either due to rarity or an actual lexical gap). A common example of this is &quot;kocherga&quot; (fireplace poker). The joke is set in a Soviet factory. Five pokers are to be requisitioned. The correct forms are acquired, but as they are being filled out, a debate arises: what is the genitive plural of &quot;kocherga&quot;? Is it &quot;Kocherg?&quot; &quot;Kocherieg?&quot; &quot;Kochergov?&quot;... One thing is clear: a form with the wrong genitive plural of &quot;kocherga&quot; will bring disaster from the typically pedantic bureaucrats. Finally, an old janitor overhears the commotion, and tells them to send in two separate requisitions: one for two &quot;kochergi&quot; and another for three &quot;kochergi&quot;. In some versions, they send in a request for 4 &quot;kochergi&quot; and one extra, to find out the correct word, only to receive back &quot;here are your 4 &quot;kochergi&quot; and one extra.&quot;
:: (The correct answer is кочерёг &quot;(kocheryog)&quot;, see its Wiktionary entry.)
A basically identical plot by Mikhail Zoshchenko involves yet another answer: after great care and multiple drafts to get the genitive case correct, including the substitution of &quot;five &quot;штук&quot; (pieces)&quot; for &quot;five pokers&quot;, the response comes back: the warehouse has no &quot;kocherezhek&quot; (fully regular genitive plural of &quot;kocherezhka&quot;, &quot;little poker&quot;).

===Eggs===

The Russian word for &quot;testicle&quot; is a diminutive of &quot;egg&quot;, so the slang word is the non-diminutive form (&quot;yaitso&quot;, cf. Spanish &quot;huevo&quot;). A large variety of jokes capitalize on this:
* A man jumps onto a bus and falls over another man, who is holding a large sack and cries out: &quot;Watch the eggs!&quot; / &quot;Are you stupid? Who would carry eggs in a sack?&quot; / &quot;Watch &quot;your&quot; eggs. This sack is full of nails!&quot;
* There is an exhibit of a precious jeweled Fabergé egg at the Hermitage Museum. The label reads: &quot;Fabergé / &quot;Self-portrait&quot; (fragment)&quot;
* A train compartment holds a family: a small daughter, her mother, and grandma. A fourth passenger is a Georgian (See jokes about Georgians). The mother starts feeding a soft-boiled egg to the daughter with a silver spoon. / Grandma: &quot;Don&#x27;t you know that eggs can spoil silver?&quot; / &quot;Who would have known!&quot;, thinks the Georgian, and he hastily moves his silver cigarette case from his front pants pocket to the back one.
* Vladimir Putin, in one of his 2002 putinisms noticed by media, exploited this pun; when asked of his opinion about portraits of presidents painted on Easter eggs, he answered: &quot;I don&#x27;t know what they paint on their eggs; I haven&#x27;t seen.&quot; This is reminiscent of the following joke: A Russian invites his new American friend, a student of Russian culture, to meet his family during the Easter period: &quot;Please meet my mother!&quot; / &quot;Oh, your mother! My respects!&quot; / &quot;That&#x27;s my sister!&quot; / &quot;Oh, your sister! Charmed!&quot; / &quot;And my brother is in the kitchen, painting the eggs.&quot; / &quot;Oh, a hippie! We have them too!&quot;

== Religion ==

Some religious jokes make fun of the clergy. They tend to be told in quasi-Church Slavonic, with its archaisms and the stereotypical &quot;okanye&quot; (a clear pronunciation of the unstressed /o/ as [o]; Modern Russian or &quot;Muscovite&quot; speech reduces unstressed /o/ to [ɐ]). Clergymen in these jokes always bear obsolete names of distinctively Greek origin, and speak in a deep voice.
* (L) At the lesson of the Holy Word: &quot;Disciple Dormidontiy, pray tell me, is the soul separable from the body or not.&quot; / &quot;Separable, Father.&quot; / &quot;Verily speakest thou. Substantiate thy reckoning.&quot; / &quot;Yesterday morning, Father, I was passing by your cell and overheard your voice chanting: [imitates &quot;basso&quot; voicing] &#x27;... And now, my soul, arise and get thee dressed.&#x27; &quot; / &quot;&quot;Substantiatum est&quot;... But in vulgar!&quot; (The Russian phrase that translates literally as &quot;my soul&quot; is a term of endearment, often toward romantic partners, comparable to English &quot;my darling&quot;)
* A young woman in a miniskirt jumps onto a bus. The bus starts abruptly, and she plops into the lap of a seated elderly priest and jumps up with a surprised &quot;Whoa!&quot; / &quot;It&#x27;s not a &#x27;whoa!&#x27;, sweet child&quot;, says the priest, &quot;but the key to the doors of Cathedral of Christ the Saviour.&quot;.
*&quot;Father Deacon, what would you like – vodka or wine?&quot; – &quot;And beer&quot;, the deacon replies.
=== Afterlife ===
Other jokes touching on religion involve Heaven or Hell. They usually focus on the attempts to settle in Afterlife in a non-trivial way, or how different nationalities/professions/occupations are treated. Jokes about specific people going to Hell and receiving fitting punishment are common as well. Rarer variants include jokes about historic figures coming back from beyond to observe or settle issues of modern Russia.
* A Communist died, and since he was an honest man albeit atheist, he was sentenced to alternate spending one year in Hell and one year in Heaven. One year passed and Satan said to God: &quot;Take this man as fast as possible. Because he turned all my young demons into Young Pioneers, I have to restore some order.&quot; Another year passed, Satan meets God again and tells him: &quot;Lord God, it&#x27;s my turn now.&quot; God replied: &quot;First of all, don&#x27;t call me Lord God, but instead Comrade God; second, there is no God; and one more thing – don&#x27;t distract me or I&#x27;ll be late to the Party meeting.&quot;
* A Russian and an American are sentenced to Hell. The Devil summons them and says: &quot;Guys, you have 2 options: an American or Russian Hell. In the American one you can do what you want, but you&#x27;ll have to eat a bucket of shit every morning. The Russian one is the same, but it&#x27;s 2 buckets.&quot; The Yankee quickly makes up his mind and goes to American Hell, while the Russian eventually chooses the Russian one. In a week or so they meet. The Russian asks: &quot;So, what&#x27;s it like out there?&quot;/ &quot;Exactly what the devil said, the Hell itself is OK, but eating a bucket of shit is killing me. And you?&quot; / &quot;Ah, it feels just like home – either the shit doesn&#x27;t get delivered or there aren&#x27;t enough buckets for everyone!&quot;

== Russian military ==
In Russian military jokes, a &quot;praporschik&quot; (warrant officer) is an archetypal bully, possessed of limited wit.

A. Dmitriev illustrates his sociological essay &quot;Army Humor&quot; with a large number of military jokes, mostly of Russian origin.

There is an enormous number of one-liners, supposedly quoting a &quot;praporschik&quot;:
* &quot;Private Ivanov, dig a trench from me to the next scarecrow!&quot;
* &quot;Private Ivanov, dig a trench from the fence to lunchtime!&quot;
* &quot;Don&#x27;t make clever faces at me — you&#x27;re future officers, now act accordingly!&quot;
The punchline &quot;from the fence to lunchtime&quot; has become a well-known Russian cliché for an assignment with no defined ending (or for doing something forever).

Some of them are philosophical and apply not just to warrant officers:
* Scene One: A tree. An apple. An ape comes and starts to shake the tree. A voice from above: &quot;Think, &quot;think&quot;!&quot; The ape thinks, grabs a stick, and knocks the apple off.
* Scene Two: A tree. An apple. A &quot;praporschik&quot; comes and starts to shake the tree. A voice from above: &quot;Think, &quot;think&quot;!&quot; / &quot;There is nothing to think about, gotta shake!&quot;

A persistent theme in Russian military, police and law-enforcement-related jokes is the ongoing conflict between the representatives of the armed forces/law enforcement, and the &quot;intelligentsia&quot;, i.e. well-educated members of society. Therefore, this theme is a satire of the image of military/law-enforcement officers and superiors as dumb and distrustful of &quot;those educated smart-alecks&quot;:
* A commander announces: – &quot;The platoon has been assigned to unload &#x27;luminum, the lightest iron in the world&quot;. A trooper responds, &quot;Permission to speak... It&#x27;s &#x27;aluminium&#x27;, not &#x27;luminum&#x27;, and it&#x27;s one of the lightest metals in the world, not the lightest &#x27;iron&#x27; in the world.&quot; The commander retorts: &quot;The platoon is going to unload &#x27;luminum... and the intelligentsia are going to unload &#x27;castum ironum&#x27;!&quot; (The Russian words are &quot;lyuminiy&quot; and &quot;chuguniy&quot;).
Until shortly before &quot;perestroika&quot;, all fit male students of higher education had obligatory military ROTC courses from which they graduated as junior officers in the military reserve. A good many of military jokes originated there:
* &quot;Soviet nuclear bombs are 25% more efficient than the Atomic Bombs of the probable adversary. American bombs have 4 zones of effect: A, B, C, D, while ours have five: А, Б, В, Г, Д!&quot; (the first five letters of the Russian alphabet, they are transliterated into Latin as A, B, V, G, D).
* &quot;A nuclear bomb always hits ground zero.&quot;
* &quot;Suppose we have a unit of &quot;M&quot; tanks... no, &quot;M&quot; is not enough. Suppose we have a unit of &quot;N&quot; tanks!&quot;
* Angry threat to an idle student: &quot;I ought to drag you out into the open field, shove you face-first against a wall, and shoot you between the eyes with a shotgun, so that you&#x27;d remember it for the rest of your life!&quot;
* Cadets, write down: &quot;the temperature of boiling water is 90°.&quot; / One of the privates replies, &quot;Comrade &quot;praporshchik&quot;, you&#x27;re mistakenit&#x27;s 100°!&quot; / The officer consults his handbook, and then announces, &quot;Right, 100°. It is the right angle that boils at 90°.&quot;
* Cadets, now write down: &quot;This device works at a temperature between −400 and 400 degrees Celsius.&quot; / &quot;Comrade &quot;praporshchik&quot;, there is no such temperature as −400 degrees!&quot; / &quot;What would you know, it&#x27;s a brand new, secret device!&quot; (Note that Russia uses the Celsius scale.)

Sometimes, these silly statements can cross over, intentionally or unintentionally, into the realm of actual wit:
* &quot;Cadet, explain why you have come to class wearing the uniform of our probable military adversary!&quot; (most probably, the instructor means jeans made in the United States) The reply is: &quot;Because they are a probable war trophy!&quot;

There are jokes about Russian nuclear missile forces and worldwide disasters because of lack of basic army discipline:

* A missile silo officer falls asleep during his watch, with his face on the control board, and accidentally hits the &quot;big red button&quot;. / An angry colonel bursts in, the junior officer snaps awake and proudly announces: &quot;Nothing to report during my watch, Comrade Colonel&quot; / &quot;Nothing to report, you say?! Nothing to report?!! So where the hell is Belgium?!!!&quot;
* Somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean, two submarines, Soviet and American, come to the surface. The Soviet one is old and rusty; the American one is new and sleek matte black. On the Soviet one, the crew lounges about lazily, and a drunken captain yells at them: &quot;Who threw a &quot;valenok&quot; (traditional Russian winter footwear made of felt) on the control board? I&#x27;m asking you, who threw a &quot;valenok&quot; on the control board?!&quot; / From the American submarine, a clean-shaven, sober, and smartly-dressed captain yells scornfully: &quot;You know, folks, in America...&quot; / The Russian captain dismissively interrupts him: &quot;America??! Ain&#x27;t no fucking America no more!!&quot; [He turns back to his crew] &quot;Who threw a &quot;valenok&quot; on the control board?!&quot;

There is also eternal mutual disdain between servicemen and civilians:
* Civilian: &quot;You servicemen are dumb. We civilians are smart!&quot; / Serviceman: &quot;If you are so smart, then why don&#x27;t you march in single file?&quot;

==Black humor==
=== Chernobyl ===
* An old woman stands in the market with a &quot;Chernobyl mushrooms for sale&quot; sign. A man goes up to her and asks: &quot;Hey, what are you doing? Who&#x27;s going to buy Chernobyl mushrooms?&quot; / &quot;Well, lots of people. Some for their boss, others for their mother-in-law...&quot;
* A grandson asks his grandfather: &quot;Grandpa, is it true that in 1986 there was an accident at Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant?&quot; / &quot;Yes, there was&quot;, answers the Grandpa and patted the grandson&#x27;s head. / &quot;Grandpa, is it true that it had absolutely no consequences?&quot; / &quot;Yes, absolutely&quot;, answered the Grandpa, and patted the grandson&#x27;s other head.
* A Soviet newspaper reports: &quot;Last night the Chernobyl Nuclear Power station fulfilled the Five Year Plan of heat energy generation... in 4 microseconds.&quot; (A poke on common Soviet reports about speedy execution of five-year plans.)
* &quot;Is it true, that you may eat meat from Chernobyl?&quot; / &quot;Yes, you may. But your feces will need to be buried in concrete 30 feet deep underground.&quot;
* &quot;Mushroom hunting in Chernobyl is difficult, yet entertaining: they scramble when they spot your approach.&quot;

=== Medical ===
Medical jokes are widespread. Often, they consist of a short dialogue of doctor or nurse with a patient:
* An autopsy of a dead patient revealed that cause of death was... the autopsy.
* &quot;Nurse, where are we going?&quot; / &quot;To the morgue.&quot;/ &quot;But I&#x27;m not dead yet!&quot;/ &quot;Well, we haven&#x27;t arrived yet.&quot;
* &quot;Nurse, where are we going?&quot; / &quot;To the morgue.&quot;/ &quot;But I&#x27;m not dead yet!&quot;/ &quot;The doc said &#x27;to the morgue&#x27; — to the morgue it is!&quot; / &quot;But what is wrong with me?!&quot; / &quot;The autopsy will show!&quot;

The phrase &quot;The doc said &#x27;to the morgue&#x27; — to the morgue it is!&quot; (&quot;Доктор сказал «в морг» — значит, в морг!&quot;) became a well-known Russian cliché, meaning that something &quot;must&quot; be done whether it makes sense or not.

== University students ==

The life of most Russian university students is characterized by many people coming from small towns and crowded into grim dormitories. State universities (the only type of universities in existence during Soviet times) are notable for not caring about the students&#x27; comfort or the quality of their food. Most jokes make fun of these &quot;interesting&quot; conditions, inventive evasion by students of their academic duties or lecture attendance, constant shortage of money, and sometimes the alcoholic tendencies of engineering students.

===Nutrition===
* A sign in a student dining hall: &quot;Students, do not drop your food on the floor, two cats have already been poisoned!&quot;
* A crocodile&#x27;s stomach can digest concrete. A student&#x27;s stomach can digest that of a crocodile.
* A student in the canteen: &quot;Can I have 2 wieners... [he hears whispers all around: &quot;Look at the rich guy!&quot;] ...and 17 forks, please?&quot;

===Drinking===
* A very rumpled student peers into an exam room and slurs at the examiner: &quot;Pp-proffessosssor, wou&#x27;d you al-low a drunk student tt-o tt-ake the exam?...&quot; / The professor sighs and says, &quot;Sure, why not?&quot; / The rumpled student turns around and slurs into the hallway: &quot;G-guys, c-carry &#x27;im in.&quot;

===Study===
Also, there are a number of funny student obsessions such as &quot;zachyotka&quot; (a book of grade transcripts, carried by every student), &quot;khalyava&quot; (a chance of getting something (in this context, good or acceptable grades) without any effort), and getting a stipend for good grades. Jokes about student life (filled with relationships, alcohol, and a permanent lack of any money) are common.

A large number of jokes are about an exam: these are usually a dialogue between the professor and the student, based on a set of questions written on a &quot;bilet&quot; (a small sheet of paper, literally &quot;ticket&quot;), which the student draws at random in the exam room, and is given some time to prepare answers. Many jokes refer to students trying to pass an exam with little or no knowledge at all (&quot;khalyava&quot; as mentioned above).
* Students are asked how quickly they can learn the Japanese language. American student: &quot;I need 6 months and I will pass any exam!&quot;. German student: &quot;I think I can do it in three months!&quot;. Russian student is asked while he&#x27;s smoking outside: &quot;Hmmm... Do you have a textbook? / Yes? / Then let me finish the cigarette and we&#x27;re good to go to that exam.&quot;
* A professor enters the lectorium on the exam day. &quot;Alright slackers, a question for A grade, what&#x27;s my name? (angry yelling in the back rows) Alright, a B grade question, what&#x27;s the color of the handbook cover? (angry yelling) Fine, a C grade question: what&#x27;s the discipline the exam is on? / We are all gonna fail if he keeps this up!&quot;

Other jokes use the fact that many (or even most) students really study only when the exam is in the imminent future (in one or two days), otherwise spending time with more interesting activities such as parties.
* God sends his angel to find out what students do. Angel returns: &quot;Three months before exams. English students study, American students have parties, Russians also have parties&quot;. Next time angel reports: &quot;One month before exams. English and Americans study, Russians have parties&quot;. Next report: &quot;One night before exams. English and American students learn their subjects, Russians pray for khalyava&quot;. God: &quot;Well, if they pray, we&#x27;ll help them!&quot;

== Cowboys ==
Cowboy jokes are a series about a Wild West full of trigger-happy simple-minded cowboys, and the perception that everything is big in Texas. It is often difficult to guess whether these are imported or genuinely Russian inventions:
* In a saloon: &quot;The guy over there really pisses me off!&quot; / &quot;There are four of them; which one?&quot; / [the sound of three shots is heard] / &quot;The one still standing!&quot;
:Variant: &quot;The guy over there saved my life yesterday, I am really grateful to him.&quot; / [a gunshot] / &quot;The one that has fallen!&quot;
* Two cowboys, a newcomer and an old-timer, are drinking beer in front of a saloon. Suddenly, there is a clatter of hooves, a great cloud of dust, and something moving extremely fast from one end of town to the other. The newcomer looks at the old-timer, but seeing no reaction, decides to let the matter drop. However, several minutes later, the same cloud of dust, accompanied by the clatter of hooves, rapidly proceeds in the other direction. Not being able to see what&#x27;s behind the dust, and unable to contain his curiosity any longer, the newcomer asks: &quot;OK, what the hell was that, Bill?&quot; / &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s Uncatchable Joe. Nobody has ever managed to catch him, Harry.&quot; / &quot;Why? Is he so fast, Bill?&quot; / &quot;Nope, it&#x27;s just because nobody needs him, Harry.&quot; (&#x27;Variant: &quot;Nobody cares about him&quot;)
:The &quot;Uncatchable Joe&quot; () has become an ironic nickname in Russia for various difficult-to-find persons (not necessarily unimportant ones). It is suggested that the nickname and the joke originated from a 1923 satirical novel &quot;An Uncatchable Enemy: American Novel&quot; by Mikhail Kozyrev (:ru:Козырев, Михаил Яковлевич) which contained a funny song about a Joe who was uncatchable because no one needed him.

A joke making fun of American films and their pirated English-to-Russian dubbing:
* Two cowboys are standing at crossroads in a prairie. / &quot;Fuck, Bob!&quot; (Voice-over: &quot;Where does this road lead to, Bob?&quot;) / &quot;Shit, John!&quot; (Voice-over: &quot;It leads to Texas, John&quot;) / &quot;Fuck, Bob!&quot; (Voice-over: &quot;Hell, we don&#x27;t need to go to Texas, Bob!&quot;) / &quot;Shit, John!&quot; (Voice-over: &quot;Don&#x27;t swear, John&quot;)

==Disabilities==
There is a series of jokes set in mental hospitals, some of which have a political subtext:
* A lecturer visits the mental hospital and gives a lecture about how great communism is. Everybody claps loudly except for one person who keeps quiet. The lecturer asks: &quot;Why aren&#x27;t you clapping?&quot; and the person replies &quot;I&#x27;m not a psycho, I just work here.&quot;
* A reporter interviews a lead doctor in the asylum: &quot;How do you understand that a patient is sane enough to be released? / Well, we have a simple test: we give the patient a spoon and a tea cup and tell him to empty a full bathtub of water! / (&quot;laughing&quot;) Well, doctor, I assume a sane person will use the cup, not a spoon? / No, a sane person will pull the plug.&quot;

A large number of jokes are about &quot;distrofiks&quot;, people with severe marasmus (termed &quot;alimentary dystrophy&quot; in Russian). The main themes are the extreme weakness, slowness, gauntness, and emaciation of a dystrophic patient. Some of the jibes originated in jokes about Gulag camps. Alexander Solzhenitsyn, in his &quot;Gulag Archipelago&quot;, wrote that dystrophy was a typical phase in the life of a Gulag inmate, and quotes the following joke:
* In order to refute international rumors, Stalin allowed a foreign delegation to inspect some Gulag camps. As a result, a foreign reporter wrote &quot;a &quot;zek&quot; is lazy, gluttonous, and deceiving&quot;. Unfortunately, the same reporter soon landed in a Gulag as an inmate himself. When later released, he instead wrote &quot;a &quot;zek&quot; is lean, ringing, and transparent&quot; (Russian: &quot;tonkiy&quot;, &quot;zvonkiy&quot;, and &quot;prozrachny&quot;).
* Muscular dystrophy patients are playing hide and seek in the hospital: &quot;Vovka, where are you?&quot; / &quot;I&#x27;m here, behind this broomstick!&quot; / &quot;Hey, didn&#x27;t we have an agreement not to hide behind thick objects?&quot;
* A jovial doctor comes into a dystrophy ward: &quot;Greetings, eagles!&quot; (a Russian cliché in addressing brave soldiers) / &quot;We&#x27;re not eagles. We&#x27;re only flying because the nurse turned the fan on!&quot;
* A dystrophy patient is lying in bed and shouting: &quot;Nurse! Nurse!&quot; / &quot;What is it now?&quot; / &quot;Kill the fly! It&#x27;s trampling on my chest!&quot;

== Taboo vocabulary ==
The very use of obscene Russian vocabulary, called &quot;mat&quot;, can enhance the humorous effect of a joke by its emotional impact. Due to the somewhat different cultural attitude to obscene slang, such an effect is difficult to render in English. The taboo status often makes &quot;mat&quot; itself the subject of a joke. One typical plot goes as follows.

:A construction site expects an inspection from the higher-ups, so a foreman warns the boys to watch their tongues. During the inspection, a hammer is accidentally dropped from the fourth floor right on a worker&#x27;s head... The punch line is an exceedingly polite, classy rebuke from the mouth of the injured, rather than a typically expected &quot;#@&amp;%$!&quot;. For example the injured worker might say: &quot;Dear co-workers, could you please watch your tools a little more carefully, so as to prevent such cases and avoid work-place injuries?&quot; In another variant of the joke the punch line is &quot;Vasya, please desist in pouring molten tin over my head&quot;.

Another series of jokes exploits the richness of the &quot;mat&quot; vocabulary, which can give a substitute to a great many words of everyday conversation. Other languages often use profanity in a similar way (like the English &quot;fuck&quot;, for example), but the highly synthetic grammar of Russian provides for the unambiguity and the outstandingly great number of various derivations from a single &quot;mat&quot; root. Emil Draitser points out that linguists explain that the linguistic properties of the Russian language rich in affixes allows for expression of a wide variety of feelings and notions using only a few core &quot;mat&quot; words:

<text>Percy Dovetonsils is a fictional character created and played by television comedian Ernie Kovacs. It is probably the best remembered of Kovacs&#x27; many TV incarnations. 

==Creation==
Kovacs created the character in 1950 for his program &quot;Three to Get Ready&quot; on WPTZ in Philadelphia (the station that is now KYW-TV). The prop glasses he used were discovered by his associate Andy McKay at a novelty store for ten cents; Kovacs drew lines on the eyeballs of the glasses to give Percy a &quot;half-awake&quot; appearance. Kovacs was said to be inspired by the TV poetry readings of Ted Malone. (Malone&#x27;s program was called &quot;Between the Bookends&quot;); Percy&#x27;s sign-off was, &quot;I&#x27;ll see you just outside the bookends.&quot; Others have attributed Percy&#x27;s persona to Alexander Woollcott.

==Format==
Percy was always introduced with a sweeping flourish of harp music as a &quot;poet laureate&quot; who appeared onscreen as a bizarrely effeminate &quot;artiste&quot; with weirdly slicked hair (including two carefully placed spit-curls on his forehead) and extraordinarily thick eyeglasses that appeared to have eyes painted on the backsides of the lenses. He would appear seated in a chair wearing a zebra-patterned smoking jacket, and reading from an oversize book lying open in his lap. Percy would address the audience in a syrupy lisp and read his poems out of the book while sipping from a martini glass (which often had a daisy for a swizzle stick) and/or smoking through a long cigarette holder.

The poems themselves were corny or silly, with titles like &quot;Leslie the Mean Animal Trainer&quot; and &quot;Ode to a Housefly (Philosophical Ruminations on a Beastie in the Booze).&quot; While clever, the real humor of the poems lay in the delivery, Percy&#x27;s appearance and mannerisms, and his obvious self-satisfaction with his creations (as evidenced by a pursed-lip smile and a quiver of the head at the end of significant stanzas).

Occasionally, Percy would display talents other than his poetry; he is seen playing Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot; on a grand piano-even after the piano itself disappears from view, and as a &quot;Master Detective&quot; in the US Steel &quot;Private Eye, Private Eye&quot; special of March 8, 1961, seen on CBS. The television special was a series of skits spoofing the portrayal of private investigators on television and in films. In &quot;The Good Old Days&quot;, Kovacs as Percy tries tracking down a killer for the victim&#x27;s widow, played by Edie Adams. Percy also put in a guest appearance on &quot;The Perry Como Show&quot; in February, 1957.

==Character==
The character has characteristics of the stereotype of homosexuals common in the 1950s and early 1960s. In one segment, he looks up abruptly from his book and says &quot;That cameraman has the motht muthcular legth...&quot; It was probably a Kovacs ad-lib, if one can judge from the off-camera laughter and the momentary shaking of the camera. In one of his poems, about a cowboy, one of the lines was &quot;Are you really a gay ranchero?&quot; The term &quot;gay&quot; in that sense was not often heard on television at that time.

Percy would sometimes talk to the off-camera crew (who were frequently heard laughing at Kovacs&#x27; ad-libs), or to his unseen &quot;friend,&quot; Bruce. The lisping of both names helped reinforce the supposedly effeminate nature of those two names, a fact which George Carlin would later sometimes reference when discussing gay issues.

According to Joe Mikolas, a friend of Kovacs who also worked with him on his television shows, Kovacs had plans to make Percy Dovetonsils a more three-dimensional character, but died in an auto accident before he could start writing new material. Kovacs&#x27; own description of his character was, &quot;He&#x27;s a beautiful soul who hasn&#x27;t quite made it over the line into this rude, virile world.&quot;

==Records==
In 1961, Kovacs recorded an album of Percy reading his poetry for Vanguard Records; the album was titled, &quot;Percy Dovetonsils... Thpeaks&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube/Kovacs/Dovetonsils&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not released until 2012. Kovacs planned to release the album, but was not able to do so because of conflicts with other labels he recorded for. When the masters were given to Kovacs, he donated them to a Los Angeles area hospital. His wife, Edie Adams, was able to acquire them again in 1967; they remained part of her non-public collection of her husband&#x27;s work until her death in 2008. When found, the tape was mislabeled as film and had no music background; it was only audio of Kovacs as Percy reading his poetry.

<text>Jacques de Vitry (&quot;Jacobus de Vitriaco&quot;, 1160/70 – 1 May 1240) was a French canon regular who was a noted theologian and chronicler of his era. 
He was elected bishop of Acre in 1214 and made cardinal in 1229.
His &quot;Historia Orientalis&quot; (also known as &quot;Historia Hierosolymitana&quot;) is an important source for the historiography of the Crusades.

==Biography==
Jacques was born in central France (perhaps Reims). He was born in 1170 at the latest.

He studied at the University of Paris, becoming a canon regular in 1210 at the Priory of Saint-Nicolas d&#x27;Oignies in the Diocese of Liège, a post he maintained until his consecration as bishop in 1216. From 1211 to 1213 he preached the Albigensian Crusade, touring France and Germany with William, the archdeacon of Paris, and recruiting many Crusaders.

In 1214 Jacques was elected Bishop of Acre. He received episcopal consecration and arrived at his see in 1216. He was subsequently heavily involved in the Fifth Crusade, participating in the siege of Damietta from 1218 to 1220. In 1219 he began to write the &quot;Historia Hierosolymitana&quot;, a history of the Holy Land from the advent of Islam until the crusades of his own day, but only two parts were completed. He returned to Europe in 1225.

Between 16 April and 29 July 1229, Pope Gregory IX elevated Jacques to the College of Cardinals and transferred him to the suburbicarian see of Frascati. With the exception of a short legation to Emperor Frederick II in 1232, he spent his last years working in the papal court. He subscribed the papal bulls between 29 July 1229 and 23 June 1239. He died at Rome as Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals. His remains were transferred to Oignies and buried there in 1241.

From a document issued by Pope Gregory on 14 May 1240 it appears that de Vitry, shortly before his death, had been elected as the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, but this election was either not ratified by the Pope or he rejected it himself.
Aside from the &quot;Historia&quot;, his works include hundreds of sermons, and letters to Pope Honorius III. He also wrote about the immoral life of the students at the University of Paris and the holy life of the Beguines of Liège, in particular his &quot;Life of Marie d&#x27;Oignies&quot;, whose advice inspired him to become a canon regular.

Jacques de Vitry was fascinated by the powers held by the beguines, such that they were paralleled with the priests of the time, yet functioned outside the church proper. Although this movement was unrecognized in the church, Jacques made appeal to Pope Honorius III to legitimize the work of their community, as well as the Liège diocese, all France and throughout the Holy Roman Empire.

== Reliquary at Oignies ==
In 2015, the CROMIOSS project, led by the Archaeological Society of Namur (SAN) in partnership with several Belgian universities and research institutes, undertook an interdisciplinary scientific study around the reliquary of Jacques de Vitry, located in the church of Saint Marie d’Oigines in Belgium. Anthropological, isotopic and genetic analyses indicated a high likelihood that the remains were in fact those of Jacques de Vitry. His unique parchment mitre was also analysed. Forensic work on the skull, supplemented with DNA evidence, also allowed for the creation of a visual reconstruction of what the bishop might have looked like. The remains were reinterred at Oignies in 2019.

<doc id="1024087" wikidata="Q177755" url="?curid=1024087" title="Astrocytoma">
<text>Astrocytoma is a type of brain tumor. Astrocytomas (also astrocytomata) originate from a specific kind of star-shaped glial cell in the cerebrum called an astrocyte. This type of tumor does not usually spread outside the brain and spinal cord and it does not usually affect other organs. After glioblastomas, astrocytomas are the second most common glioma and can occur in most parts of the brain and occasionally in the spinal cord.

Within the astrocytomas, two broad classes are recognized in literature, those with:
* Narrow zones of infiltration (mostly noninvasive tumors; e.g., pilocytic astrocytoma, subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma), that often are clearly outlined on diagnostic images
* Diffuse zones of infiltration (e.g., high-grade astrocytoma), that share various features, including the ability to arise at any location in the central nervous system, but with a preference for the cerebral hemispheres; they occur usually in adults, and have an intrinsic tendency to progress to more advanced grades.

People can develop astrocytomas at any age. The low-grade type is more often found in children or young adults, while the high-grade type is more prevalent in adults. Astrocytomas in the base of the brain are more common in young people and account for roughly 75% of neuroepithelial tumors.

==Pathophysiology==
Astrocytoma causes regional effects by compression, invasion, and destruction of brain parenchyma, arterial and venous hypoxia, competition for nutrients, release of metabolic end products (e.g., free radicals, altered electrolytes, neurotransmitters), and release and recruitment of cellular mediators (e.g., cytokines) that disrupt normal parenchymal function. Secondary clinical sequelae may be caused by elevated intracranial pressure attributable to direct mass effect, increased blood volume, or increased cerebrospinal fluid volume.

===Genetic and Molecular alterations===
Homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/B is the main feature of high grade astrocytoma. In addition, a genome-wide pattern of DNA copy-number alterations (CNAs) has been uncovered, which is correlated with a patient&#x27;s survival and response to treatment. This pattern identifies among lower-grade astrocytoma patients a subtype, where the CNA genotype is correlated with an approximately one-year survival phenotype.

==Diagnosis==
An X-ray computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is necessary to characterize the extent of these tumors (size, location, consistency). CT will usually show distortion of third and lateral ventricles with displacement of anterior and middle cerebral arteries. Histologic analysis is necessary for grading diagnosis.

In the first stage of diagnosis the doctor will take a history of symptoms and perform a basic neurological exam, including an eye exam and tests of vision, balance, coordination, and mental status. The doctor will then require a CT scan and MRI of the patient&#x27;s brain. During a CT scan, X-rays of the patient&#x27;s brain are taken from many different directions. These are then combined by a computer, producing a cross-sectional image of the brain. For an MRI, the patient relaxes in a tunnel-like instrument while the brain is subjected to changes of magnetic field. An image is produced based on the behavior of the brain&#x27;s water molecules in response to the magnetic fields. A special dye may be injected into a vein before these scans to provide contrast and make tumors easier to identify.

If a tumor is found, a neurosurgeon must perform a biopsy on it. This simply involves the removal of a small amount of tumor tissue, which is then sent to a neuropathologist for examination and grading. The biopsy may take place before surgical removal of the tumor or the sample may be taken during surgery. Grading of the tumor sample is a method of classification that helps the doctor to determine the severity of the astrocytoma and to decide on the best treatment options. The neuropathologist grades the tumor by looking for atypical cells, the growth of new blood vessels, and for indicators of cell division called mitotic figures.

===Grading===
Of numerous grading systems in use for the classification of tumor of the central nervous system, the World Health Organization (WHO) grading system is commonly used for astrocytoma. Established in 1993 in an effort to eliminate confusion regarding diagnoses, the WHO system established a four-tiered histologic grading guideline for astrocytomas that assigns a grade from 1 to 4, with 1 being the least aggressive and 4 being the most aggressive.

The WHO grading scheme is based on the appearance of certain characteristics: atypia, mitosis, endothelial proliferation, and necrosis. These features reflect the malignant potential of the tumor in terms of invasion and growth rate. 
Various types of astrocytomas are given these WHO grades:

According to the WHO data, the lowest grade astrocytomas (grade I) make up only 2% of recorded astrocytomas, grade II 8%, and the higher grade anaplastic astrocytomas (grade III) 20%. The highest graded astrocytoma (grade IV GBM) is the most common primary nervous system cancer and second most frequent brain tumor after brain metastasis. Despite the low incidence of astrocytomas compared to other human cancers, mortality is significant, as the higher grades (III &amp; IV) present high mortality rates (mainly due to late detection of the neoplasm).

==Prevention==
There are no precise guidelines because the exact cause of astrocytoma is not known.

==Treatment==

For low-grade astrocytomas, removal of the tumor generally allows functional survival for many years. In some reports, the 5-year survival has been over 90% with well-resected tumors. Indeed, broad intervention of low-grade conditions is a contested matter. In particular, pilocytic astrocytomas are commonly indolent bodies that may permit normal neurologic function. However, left unattended, these tumors may eventually undergo neoplastic transformation. To date, complete resection of high-grade astrocytomas is impossible because of the diffuse infiltration of tumor cells into normal parenchyma. Thus, high-grade astrocytomas inevitably recur after initial surgery or therapy and are usually treated similarly to the initial tumor. Despite decades of therapeutic research, curative intervention is still nonexistent for high-grade astrocytomas; patient care ultimately focuses on palliative management.

==Society and culture==

===Notable cases===
In March 1990, United States Republican Party political strategist Lee Atwater was diagnosed with astrocytoma after a tumor was found in his right parietal lobe. After undergoing radiation therapy (including the then-new implant radiation treatment), Atwater died the following year at the age of 40.

Long-time U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA) died of malignant glioma.

University of Texas sniper Charles Whitman, who killed multiple people during a mass murder event in 1966, was diagnosed with astrocytoma post-mortem. The Connally Commission investigating the shooting concluded the tumor &quot;conceivably could have contributed to his inability to control his emotions and actions&quot;.

Major League pitcher Dan Quisenberry was diagnosed with grade IV astrocytoma in January 1998. He died age 45 in 1998 in Leawood, Kansas.

Richard Burns, winner of the 2001 World Rally Championship, was diagnosed with astrocytoma in 2003. Four years to the day after winning the World Rally Championship, on 25 November 2005, Burns died in Westminster, London, aged 34, after having been in a coma for some days as a result of his brain tumour.

Professional wrestler Matt Cappotelli was diagnosed with a grade 2/3 astrocytoma in December 2005, scuttling plans to promote Cappottelli to the main WWE roster. Cappotelli, who won a contract with WWE through the third season of their reality program &quot;Tough Enough&quot;, was the Ohio Valley Wrestling Heavyweight Champion at the time of his diagnosis and vacated the title in February 2006 after confirming the tumor was cancerous. Cappotelli underwent successful surgery and chemotherapy, but was unable to return to active wrestling work. He did return to OVW as a trainer in 2013. He died on June 29, 2018.

<text>Astrocytes (from Ancient Greek , , &quot;star&quot; and , , &quot;cavity&quot;, &quot;cell&quot;), also known collectively as astroglia, are characteristic star-shaped glial cells in the brain and spinal cord. They perform many functions, including biochemical control of endothelial cells that form the blood–brain barrier, provision of nutrients to the nervous tissue, maintenance of extracellular ion balance, regulation of cerebral blood flow, and a role in the repair and scarring process of the brain and spinal cord following infection and traumatic injuries. The proportion of astrocytes in the brain is not well defined; depending on the counting technique used, studies have found that the astrocyte proportion varies by region and ranges from 20% to around 40% of all glia. Another study reports that astrocytes are the most numerous cell type in the brain. Astrocytes are the major source of cholesterol in the central nervous system. Apolipoprotein E transports cholesterol from astrocytes to neurons and other glial cells, regulating cell signaling in the brain. Astrocytes in humans are more than twenty times larger than in rodent brains, and make contact with more than ten times the number of synapses.

Research since the mid-1990s has shown that astrocytes propagate intercellular Ca2+ waves over long distances in response to stimulation, and, similar to neurons, release transmitters (called gliotransmitters) in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Data suggest that astrocytes also signal to neurons through Ca2+-dependent release of glutamate. Such discoveries have made astrocytes an important area of research within the field of neuroscience.

== Structure ==


Astrocytes are a sub-type of glial cells in the central nervous system. They are also known as &quot;astrocytic glial cells.&quot; Star-shaped, their many processes envelop synapses made by neurons. In humans, a single astrocyte cell can interact with up to 2 million synapses at a time. Astrocytes are classically identified using histological analysis; many of these cells express the intermediate filament glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). 

===Types===
Several forms of astrocytes exist in the central nervous system: including &quot;fibrous&quot; (in white matter), &quot;protoplasmic&quot; (in grey matter), and &quot;radial&quot;. 

====Fibrous glia====
The fibrous glia are usually located within white matter, have relatively few organelles, and exhibit long unbranched cellular processes. This type often has astrocytic endfeet processes that physically connect the cells to the outside of capillary walls when they are in proximity to them.

====Protoplasmic glia====
The protoplasmic glia are the most prevalent and are found in grey matter tissue, possess a larger quantity of organelles, and exhibit short and highly branched tertiary processes.

====Radial glia====
The radial glial cells are disposed in planes perpendicular to the axes of ventricles. One of their processes abuts the pia mater, while the other is deeply buried in gray matter. Radial glia are mostly present during development, playing a role in neuron migration. Müller cells of the retina and Bergmann glia cells of the cerebellar cortex represent an exception, being present still during adulthood. When in proximity to the pia mater, all three forms of astrocytes send out processes to form the pia-glial membrane.

===Energy use===
Early assessments of energy use in gray matter signaling suggested that 95% was attributed to neurons and 5% to astrocytes. However, after discovering that action potentials were more efficient than initially believed, the energy budget was adjusted: 70% for dendrites, 15% for axons, and 7% for astrocytes. Previous accounts assumed that astrocytes captured synaptic K⁺ solely via Kir4.1 channels. However, it&#x27;s now understood they also utilize Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase. Factoring in this active buffering, astrocytic energy demand increases by &gt;200%. This is supported by 3D neuropil reconstructions indicating similar mitochondrial densities in both cell types, as well as cell-specific transcriptomic and proteomic data, and tricarboxylic acid cycle rates. Therefore &quot;Gram-per-gram, astrocytes turn out to be as expensive as neurons&quot;.

==Development==

Astrocytes are macroglial cells in the central nervous system. Astrocytes are derived from heterogeneous populations of progenitor cells in the neuroepithelium of the developing central nervous system. There is remarkable similarity between the well known genetic mechanisms that specify the lineage of diverse neuron subtypes and that of macroglial cells. Just as with neuronal cell specification, canonical signaling factors like sonic hedgehog (SHH), fibroblast growth factor (FGFs), WNTs and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), provide positional information to developing macroglial cells through morphogen gradients along the dorsal–ventral, anterior–posterior and medial–lateral axes. The resultant patterning along the neuraxis leads to segmentation of the neuroepithelium into progenitor domains (p0, p1 p2, p3 and pMN) for distinct neuron types in the developing spinal cord. On the basis of several studies it is now believed that this model also applies to macroglial cell specification. Studies carried out by Hochstim and colleagues have demonstrated that three distinct populations of astrocytes arise from the p1, p2 and p3 domains. These subtypes of astrocytes can be identified on the basis of their expression of different transcription factors (PAX6, NKX6.1) and cell surface markers (reelin and SLIT1). The three populations of astrocyte subtypes which have been identified are: 1) dorsally located VA1 astrocytes, derived from p1 domain, express PAX6 and reelin; 2) ventrally located VA3 astrocytes, derived from p3, express NKX6.1 and SLIT1; and 3) intermediate white-matter located VA2 astrocyte, derived from the p2 domain, which express PAX6, NKX6.1, reelin and SLIT1. After astrocyte specification has occurred in the developing CNS, it is believed that astrocyte precursors migrate to their final positions within the nervous system before the process of terminal differentiation occurs.

== Function ==

Astrocytes help form the physical structure of the brain, and are thought to play a number of active roles, including the secretion or absorption of neural transmitters and maintenance of the blood–brain barrier. The concept of a tripartite synapse has been proposed, referring to the tight relationship occurring at synapses among a presynaptic element, a postsynaptic element, and a glial element.
* Structural: They are involved in the physical structuring of the brain. Astrocytes get their name because they are &quot;star-shaped&quot;. They are the most abundant glial cells in the brain that are closely associated with neuronal synapses. They regulate the transmission of electrical impulses within the brain.
* Glycogen fuel reserve buffer: Astrocytes contain glycogen and are capable of gluconeogenesis. The astrocytes next to neurons in the frontal cortex and hippocampus store and release glucose. Thus, astrocytes can fuel neurons with glucose during periods of high rate of glucose consumption and glucose shortage. A recent research on rats suggests there may be a connection between this activity and physical exercise.
* Metabolic support: They provide neurons with nutrients such as lactate.
*Glucose sensing: normally associated with neurons, the detection of interstitial glucose levels within the brain is also controlled by astrocytes. Astrocytes &quot;in vitro&quot; become activated by low glucose and are &quot;in vivo&quot; this activation increases gastric emptying to increase digestion.
* Blood–brain barrier: The astrocyte endfeet processes encircling endothelial cells were thought to aid in the maintenance of the blood–brain barrier, and recent research indicates that they do play a substantial role, along with the tight junctions and basal lamina. However, it has recently been shown that astrocyte activity is linked to blood flow in the brain, and that this is what is actually being measured in fMRI. 
* Transmitter uptake and release: Astrocytes express plasma membrane transporters for several neurotransmitters, including glutamate, ATP, and GABA. More recently, astrocytes were shown to release glutamate or ATP in a vesicular, Ca2+-dependent manner. (This has been disputed for hippocampal astrocytes.)
* Regulation of ion concentration in the extracellular space: Astrocytes express potassium channels at a high density. When neurons are active, they release potassium, increasing the local extracellular concentration. Because astrocytes are highly permeable to potassium, they rapidly clear the excess accumulation in the extracellular space. If this function is interfered with, the extracellular concentration of potassium will rise, leading to neuronal depolarization by the Goldman equation. Abnormal accumulation of extracellular potassium is well known to result in epileptic neuronal activity. 
* Modulation of synaptic transmission: In the supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus, rapid changes in astrocyte morphology have been shown to affect heterosynaptic transmission between neurons. In the hippocampus, astrocytes suppress synaptic transmission by releasing ATP, which is hydrolyzed by ectonucleotidases to yield adenosine. Adenosine acts on neuronal adenosine receptors to inhibit synaptic transmission, thereby increasing the dynamic range available for LTP.
* Vasomodulation: Astrocytes may serve as intermediaries in neuronal regulation of blood flow.
* Promotion of the myelinating activity of oligodendrocytes: Electrical activity in neurons causes them to release ATP, which serves as an important stimulus for myelin to form. However, the ATP does not act directly on oligodendrocytes. Instead, it causes astrocytes to secrete cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a regulatory protein that promotes the myelinating activity of oligodendrocytes. This suggests that astrocytes have an executive-coordinating role in the brain.
* Nervous system repair: Upon injury to nerve cells within the central nervous system, astrocytes fill up the space to form a glial scar, and may contribute to neural repair. The role of astrocytes in CNS regeneration following injury is not well understood though. The glial scar has traditionally been described as an impermeable barrier to regeneration, thus implicating a negative role in axon regeneration. However, recently, it was found through genetic ablation studies that astrocytes are actually required for regeneration to occur. More importantly, the authors found that the astrocyte scar is actually essential for stimulated axons (that axons that have been coaxed to grow via neurotrophic supplementation) to extend through the injured spinal cord. Astrocytes that have been pushed into a reactive phenotype (termed astrogliosis, defined by the upregulation of among others, GFAP and vimentin expression, a definition still under debate) may actually be toxic to neurons, releasing signals that can kill neurons. Much work, however, remains to elucidate their role in nervous system injury.
*Long-term potentiation: There is debate among scientists as to whether astrocytes integrate learning and memory in the hippocampus. Recently, it has been shown that engrafting human glial progenitor cell in nascent mice brains causes the cells to differentiate into astrocytes. After differentiation, these cells increase LTP and improve memory performance in the mice.
*Circadian clock: Astrocytes alone are sufficient to drive the molecular oscillations in the SCN and circadian behavior in mice, and thus can autonomously initiate and sustain complex mammalian behavior.
*The switch of the nervous system: Based on the evidence listed below, it has been recently conjectured in, that macro glia (and astrocytes in particular) act both as a lossy neurotransmitter capacitor and as the logical switch of the nervous system. I.e., macroglia either block or enable the propagation of the stimulus along the nervous system, depending on their membrane state and the level of the stimulus.


Astrocytes are linked by gap junctions, creating an electrically coupled (functional) syncytium. Because of this ability of astrocytes to communicate with their neighbors, changes in the activity of one astrocyte can have repercussions on the activities of others that are quite distant from the original astrocyte.

An influx of Ca2+ ions into astrocytes is the essential change that ultimately generates calcium waves. Because this influx is directly caused by an increase in blood flow to the brain, calcium waves are said to be a kind of hemodynamic response function. An increase in intracellular calcium concentration can propagate outwards through this functional syncytium. Mechanisms of calcium wave propagation include diffusion of calcium ions and IP3 through gap junctions and extracellular ATP signalling. Calcium elevations are the primary known axis of activation in astrocytes, and are necessary and sufficient for some types of astrocytic glutamate release. Given the importance of calcium signaling in astrocytes, tight regulatory mechanisms for the progression of the spatio-temporal calcium signaling have been developed. Via mathematical analysis it has been shown that localized inflow of Ca2+ ions yields a localized raise in the cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ ions. Moreover, cytosolic Ca2+ accumulation is independent of every intracellular calcium flux and depends on the Ca2+ exchange across the
membrane, cytosolic calcium diffusion, geometry of the cell, extracellular calcium perturbation, and initial concentrations.

=== Tripartite synapse ===

Within the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, activated astrocytes have the ability to respond to almost all neurotransmitters and, upon activation, release a multitude of neuroactive molecules such as glutamate, ATP, nitric oxide (NO), and prostaglandins (PG), which in turn influences neuronal excitability. The close association between astrocytes and presynaptic and postsynaptic terminals as well as their ability to integrate synaptic activity and release neuromodulators has been termed the tripartite synapse. Synaptic modulation by astrocytes takes place because of this three-part association.

A 2023 study suggested astrocytes, previously underexplored brain cells, could be key to extending wakefulness without negative effects on cognition and health.

===Glutamatergic gliotransmission ===
Some specialized astrocytes mediate glutamatergic gliotransmission in the central nervous system. Such cells have been called hybrid brain cells because they exhibit both neuron-like and glial-like properties. Unlike traditional neurons, these cells not only transmit electrical signals but also provide supportive roles typically associated with glial cells, such as regulating the brain&#x27;s extracellular environment and maintaining overall homeostasis.

==Clinical significance==

===Astrocytomas===
Astrocytomas are primary tumors in the CNS that develop from astrocytes. It is also possible that glial progenitors or neural stem cells can give rise to astrocytomas. These tumors may occur in many parts of the brain or spinal cord. Astrocytomas are divided into two categories: low grade (I and II) and high grade (III and IV). Low grade tumors are more common in children, and high grade tumors are more common in adults. Malignant astrocytomas are more prevalent among men, contributing to worse survival.

Pilocytic astrocytomas are grade I tumors. They are considered benign and slow growing tumors. Pilocytic astrocytomas frequently have cystic portions filled with fluid and a nodule, which is the solid portion. Most are located in the cerebellum. Therefore, most symptoms are related to balance or coordination difficulties. They also occur more frequently in children and teens.

Fibrillary astrocytomas are grade II tumors. They grow relatively slowly so are usually considered benign, but they infiltrate the surrounding healthy tissue and can become malignant. Fibrillary astrocytomas commonly occur in younger people, who often present with seizures.

Anaplastic astrocytomas are grade III malignant tumors. They grow more rapidly than lower grade tumors. Anaplastic astrocytomas recur more frequently than lower grade tumors because their tendency to spread into surrounding tissue makes them difficult to completely remove surgically.

Glioblastoma is a grade IV cancer that may originate from astrocytes or an existing astrocytoma. Approximately 50% of all brain tumors are glioblastomas. Glioblastomas can contain multiple glial cell types, including astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Glioblastomas are generally considered to be the most invasive type of glial tumor, as they grow rapidly and spread to nearby tissue. Treatment may be complicated, because one tumor cell type may die off in response to a particular treatment while the other cell types may continue to multiply.

===Neurodevelopmental disorders===
Astrocytes have emerged as important participants in various neurodevelopmental disorders. This view states that astrocyte dysfunction may result in improper neural circuitry, which underlies certain psychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia.

=== Chronic pain ===
Under normal conditions, pain conduction begins with some noxious signal followed by an action potential carried by nociceptive (pain sensing) afferent neurons, which elicit excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. That message is then relayed to the cerebral cortex, where we translate those EPSPs into &quot;pain&quot;. Since the discovery of astrocyte-neuron signaling, our understanding of the conduction of pain has been dramatically complicated. Pain processing is no longer seen as a repetitive relay of signals from body to brain, but as a complex system that can be up- and down-regulated by a number of different factors. One factor at the forefront of recent research is in the pain-potentiating synapse located in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and the role of astrocytes in encapsulating these synapses. Garrison and co-workers were the first to suggest association when they found a correlation between astrocyte hypertrophy in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and hypersensitivity to pain after peripheral nerve injury, typically considered an indicator of glial activation after injury. Astrocytes detect neuronal activity and can release chemical transmitters, which in turn control synaptic activity. In the past, hyperalgesia was thought to be modulated by the release of substance P and excitatory amino acids (EAA), such as glutamate, from the presynaptic afferent nerve terminals in the spinal cord dorsal horn. Subsequent activation of AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid), NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) and kainate subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptors follows. It is the activation of these receptors that potentiates the pain signal up the spinal cord. This idea, although true, is an oversimplification of pain transduction. A litany of other neurotransmitter and neuromodulators, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), galanin, and vasopressin are all synthesized and released in response to noxious stimuli. In addition to each of these regulatory factors, several other interactions between pain-transmitting neurons and other neurons in the dorsal horn have added impact on pain pathways.

====Two states of persistent pain====

After persistent peripheral tissue damage there is a release of several factors from the injured tissue as well as in the spinal dorsal horn. These factors increase the responsiveness of the dorsal horn pain-projection neurons to ensuing stimuli, termed &quot;spinal sensitization&quot;, thus amplifying the pain impulse to the brain. Release of glutamate, substance P, and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) mediates NMDAR activation (originally silent because it is plugged by Mg2+), thus aiding in depolarization of the postsynaptic pain-transmitting neurons (PTN). In addition, activation of IP3 signaling and MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) such as ERK and JNK, bring about an increase in the synthesis of inflammatory factors that alter glutamate transporter function. ERK also further activates AMPARs and NMDARs in neurons. Nociception is further sensitized by the association of ATP and substance P with their respective receptors (P2X3) and neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R), as well as activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors and release of BDNF. Persistent presence of glutamate in the synapse eventually results in dysregulation of GLT1 and GLAST, crucial transporters of glutamate into astrocytes. Ongoing excitation can also induce ERK and JNK activation, resulting in release of several inflammatory factors.

As noxious pain is sustained, spinal sensitization creates transcriptional changes in the neurons of the dorsal horn that lead to altered function for extended periods. Mobilization of Ca2+ from internal stores results from persistent synaptic activity and leads to the release of glutamate, ATP, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-6, nitric oxide (NO), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Activated astrocytes are also a source of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), which induces pro-IL-1β cleavage and sustains astrocyte activation. In this chronic signaling pathway, p38 is activated as a result of IL-1β signaling, and there is a presence of chemokines that trigger their receptors to become active. In response to nerve damage, heat shock proteins (HSP) are released and can bind to their respective TLRs, leading to further activation.

===Other pathologies===

Other clinically significant pathologies involving astrocytes include astrogliosis and astrocytopathy. Examples of these include multiple sclerosis, anti-AQP4+ neuromyelitis optica, Rasmussen&#x27;s encephalitis, Alexander disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Studies have shown that astrocytes may be implied in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, Huntington&#x27;s disease, Stuttering and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and in acute brain injuries, such as intracerebral hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury.

==== Gomori-positive astrocytes and brain dysfunction ====

A type of astrocyte with an aging-related pathology has been described over the last fifty years. Astrocytes of this subtype possess prominent cytoplasmic granules that are intensely stained by Gomori&#x27;s chrome alum hematoxylin stain, and hence are termed Gomori-positive (GP) astrocytes. They can be found throughout the brain, but are by far the most abundant in the olfactory bulbs, medial habenula, dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, and in the dorsal medulla, just beneath the area postrema.

Gomori-positive cytoplasmic granules are derived from damaged mitochondria engulfed within lysosomes. Cytoplasmic granules contain undigested remnants of mitochondrial structures. These contents include heme-linked copper and iron atoms remaining from mitochondrial enzymes. These chemical substances account for the pseudoperoxidase activity of Gomori-positive granules that can utilized to stain for these granules. Oxidative stress is believed to be cause of damage to these astrocytes. However, the exact nature of this stress is uncertain.

Brain regions enriched in Gomori-positive astrocytes also contain a sub-population of specialized astrocytes that synthesize Fatty Acid Binding Protein 7 (FABP7). Indeed, astrocytes in the hypothalamus that synthesize FABP7 have also been shown to possess Gomori-positive granules. Thus, a connection between these two glial features is apparent. Recent data have shown that astrocytes, but not neurons, possess the mitochondrial enzymes needed to metabolize fatty acids, and that the resulting oxidative stress can damage mitochondria. Thus, an increased uptake and oxidation of fatty acids in glia containing FABP7 is likely to cause the oxidative stress and damage to mitochondria in these cells. Also, FABP proteins have recently been shown to interact with a protein called synuclein to cause mitochondrial damage.

==== Possible roles in pathophysiology ====

Astrocytes can transfer mitochondria into adjacent neurons to improve neuronal function. It is therefore plausible that the damage to astrocyte mitochondria seen in GP astrocytes could affect the activity of neurons.

A number of hypothalamic functions show declines in aging that may be related to GP astrocytes. For example, GP astrocytes are in close contact with neurons that make a neurotransmitter called dopamine in both the rat and human hypothalamus. The dopamine produced by these neurons is carried to the nearby pituitary gland to inhibit the release of a hormone called prolactin from the pituitary. The activity of dopaminergic neurons declines during aging, leading to elevations in blood levels of prolactin that can provoke breast cancer. An aging-associated change in astrocyte function might contribute to this change in dopaminergic activity.

FABP7+ astrocytes are in close contact with neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus that are responsive to a hormone called leptin that is produced by fat cells. Leptin-sensitive neurons regulate appetite and body weight. FABP7+ astrocytes regulate the responsiveness of these neurons to leptin. Mitochondrial damage in these astrocytes could thus alter the function of leptin-sensitive neurons and could contribute to an aging-associated dysregulation of feeding and body weight.

GP astrocytes may also be involved in the hypothalamic regulation of overall glucose metabolism. Recent data show that astrocytes function as glucose sensors and exert a commanding influence upon neuronal reactivity to changes in extracellular glucose. GP astrocytes possess high-capacity GLUT2-type glucose transporter proteins and appear to modulate the neuronal responses to glucose. Hypothalamic cells monitor blood levels of glucose and exert an influence upon blood glucose levels via an altered input to autonomic circuits that innervate liver and muscle cells.

The importance of astrocytes in aging-related disturbances in glucose metabolism has been recently illustrated by studies of diabetic animals. A single infusion of a protein called fibroblast growth factor-1 into the hypothalamus has been shown to permanently normalize blood glucose levels in diabetic rodents. This remarkable cure of diabetes mellitus is mediated by astrocytes. The most prominent genes activated by FGF-1 treatment include the genes responsible for the synthesis of FABP6 and FABP7 by astrocytes. These data confirm the importance of FABP7+ astrocytes for the control of blood glucose. Dysfunction of FABP7+/Gomori-positive astrocytes may contribute to the aging-related development of diabetes mellitus.

GP astrocytes are also present in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in both rodent and human brains. The hippocampus undergoes severe degenerative changes during aging in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. The reasons for these degenerative changes are currently being hotly debated. A recent study has shown that levels of glial proteins, and NOT neuronal proteins, are most abnormal in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. The glial protein most severely affected is FABP5. Another study showed that 100% of hippocampal astrocytes that contain FABP7 also contain FABP5. These data suggest that FABP7+/Gomori-positive astrocytes may play a role in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. An altered glial function in this region could compromise the function of dentate gyrus neurons and also the function of axons that terminate in the dentate gyrus. Many such axons originate in the lateral entorhinal cortex, which is the first brain region to show degeneration in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Astrocyte pathology in the hippocampus thus might make a contribution to the pathology of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

==Research==

A study performed in November 2010 and published March 2011, was done by a team of scientists from the University of Rochester and University of Colorado School of Medicine. They did an experiment to attempt to repair trauma to the Central Nervous System of an adult rat by replacing the glial cells. When the glial cells were injected into the injury of the adult rat&#x27;s spinal cord, astrocytes were generated by exposing human glial precursor cells to bone morphogenetic protein (bone morphogenetic protein is important because it is considered to create tissue architecture throughout the body). So, with the bone protein and human glial cells combined, they promoted significant recovery of conscious foot placement, axonal growth, and obvious increases in neuronal survival in the spinal cord laminae. On the other hand, human glial precursor cells and astrocytes generated from these cells by being in contact with ciliary neurotrophic factors, failed to promote neuronal survival and support of axonal growth at the spot of the injury.

One study done in Shanghai had two types of hippocampal neuronal cultures: In one culture, the neuron was grown from a layer of astrocytes and the other culture was not in contact with any astrocytes, but they were instead fed a glial conditioned medium (GCM), which inhibits the rapid growth of cultured astrocytes in the brains of rats in most cases. In their results they were able to see that astrocytes had a direct role in Long-term potentiation with the mixed culture (which is the culture that was grown from a layer of astrocytes) but not in GCM cultures.

Studies have shown that astrocytes play an important function in the regulation of neural stem cells. Research from the Schepens Eye Research Institute at Harvard shows the human brain to abound in neural stem cells, which are kept in a dormant state by chemical signals (ephrin-A2 and ephrin-A3) from the astrocytes. The astrocytes are able to activate the stem cells to transform into working neurons by dampening the release of ephrin-A2 and ephrin-A3.

In a study published in a 2011 issue of &quot;Nature Biotechnology&quot; a group of researchers from the University of Wisconsin reports that it has been able to direct embryonic and induced human stem cells to become astrocytes.

A 2012 study of the effects of marijuana on short-term memories found that THC activates CB1 receptors of astrocytes which cause receptors for AMPA to be removed from the membranes of associated neurons.

A 2023 study showed that astrocytes also play an active role in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. More specifically, when astrocytes became reactive they unleash the pathological effects of amyloid-beta on downstream tau phosphorylation and deposition, which very likely will lead to cognitive deterioration.

==Classification==
There are several different ways to classify astrocytes.

=== Lineage and antigenic phenotype ===
These have been established by classic work by Raff et al. in early 1980s on Rat optic nerves.
* Type 1: Antigenically Ran2+, GFAP+, FGFR3+, A2B5−, thus resembling the &quot;type 1 astrocyte&quot; of the postnatal day 7 rat optic nerve. These can arise from the tripotential glial restricted precursor cells (GRP), but not from the bipotential O2A/OPC (oligodendrocyte, type 2 astrocyte precursor, also called &quot;Oligodendrocyte progenitor cell&quot;) cells.
* Type 2: Antigenically A2B5+, GFAP+, FGFR3−, Ran 2−. These cells can develop &quot;in vitro&quot; from the either tripotential GRP (probably via O2A stage) or from bipotential O2A cells (which some people think may in turn have been derived from the GRP) or in vivo when these progenitor cells are transplanted into lesion sites (but &quot;probably not in normal development, at least not in the rat optic nerve&quot;). Type 2 astrocytes are the major astrocytic component in postnatal optic nerve cultures that are generated by O2A cells grown in the presence of fetal calf serum but are not thought to exist &quot;in vivo&quot;.

===Anatomical classification===

*Protoplasmic: found in grey matter and have many branching processes whose end-feet envelop synapses. Some protoplasmic astrocytes are generated by multipotent subventricular zone progenitor cells.
*Gömöri-positive astrocytes. These are a subset of protoplasmic astrocytes that contain numerous cytoplasmic inclusions, or granules, that stain positively with Gömöri trichrome stain a chrome-alum hematoxylin stain. It is now known that these granules are formed from the remnants of degenerating mitochondria engulfed within lysosomes, Some type of oxidative stress appears to be responsible for the mitochondrial damage within these specialized astrocytes. Gömöri-positive astrocytes are much more abundant within the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and in the hippocampus than in other brain regions. They may have a role in regulating the response of the hypothalamus to glucose.
*Fibrous: found in white matter and have long thin unbranched processes whose end-feet envelop nodes of Ranvier. Some fibrous astrocytes are generated by radial glia.

===Transporter/receptor classification===
*GluT type: these express glutamate transporters (EAAT1/ and EAAT2/) and respond to synaptic release of glutamate by transporter currents. The function and availability of EAAT2 is modulated by TAAR1, an intracellular receptor in human astrocytes.
*GluR type: these express glutamate receptors (mostly mGluR and AMPA type) and respond to synaptic release of glutamate by channel-mediated currents and IP3-dependent Ca2+ transients.

<text>State Route 3 (SR 3) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Washington, serving the Kitsap Peninsula in Mason and Kitsap counties. The highway begins at U.S. Route 101 (US 101) south of Shelton and travels northeast onto the Kitsap Peninsula through Belfair to Gorst, where it intersects SR 16 and begins its freeway. SR 3 travels west of Bremerton, Silverdale and Poulsbo before it terminates at the eastern end of the Hood Canal Bridge, signed as SR 104. The highway is designated as a Strategic Highway Network (STRAHNET) corridor under the National Highway System as the main thoroughfare connecting both parts of Naval Base Kitsap and is also part of the Highways of Statewide Significance program.

SR 3 was established during the 1964 highway renumbering and codified in 1970 as the successor to Secondary State Highway 14 (SSH 14) from Shelton to Belfair, Primary State Highway 14 (PSH 14) from Belfair to Gorst, and PSH 21 from Gorst to the Hood Canal Bridge. PSH 21 was previously part of State Road 21 from 1915 to 1937, while PSH 14 was part of State Road 14 and the Navy Yard Highway from 1919 to 1937. The present SR 3 freeway was opened in 1968 in the Bremerton area and was extended north to Silverdale in 1973, to Bangor in 1981, and to Poulsbo in 1983.

==Route description==
SR 3 begins at a diamond interchange with US 101 south of Shelton in unincorporated Mason County on the Olympic Peninsula. The highway travels north into Shelton at the end of Oakland Bay on 1st Street and crosses over a Puget Sound and Pacific Railroad line and Goldsborough Creek. SR 3 turns east on Pine Street and leaves Shelton, traveling northeast along Oakland Bay and a US Navy rail line. The highway continues north along Oakland Bay and Case Inlet past heavily forested areas to Allyn-Grapeview, where it serves as the western terminus of SR 302 at North Mason High School. SR 3 travels towards the southern end of the Hood Canal and intersects the eastern termini of SR 106 and SR 300 in Belfair. The highway continues northeast past Bremerton National Airport towards the community of Gorst in Kitsap County, where it forms the western terminus of SR 16.

SR 3 becomes a four-lane divided freeway and travels northeast along the Sinclair Inlet to an interchange with SR 304 in Navy Yard City, serving the city of Bremerton and Naval Station Bremerton. The freeway continues through western Bremerton past the diamond interchange with SR 310 and the community of Chico along Dyes Inlet. SR 3 travels west of Silverdale past the western terminus of SR 303 at the Kitsap Mall and east of Naval Submarine Base Bangor in Bangor. The freeway continues north towards Poulsbo past the termini of SR 308 and SR 305, which serve Keyport and Bainbridge Island respectively. SR 3 travels north from Poulsbo as a two-lane road towards Port Gamble and ends at the eastern approach of the Hood Canal Bridge at an intersection with SR 104.

Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of SR 3 was between SR 16 in Gorst and SR 304 in Navy Yard City, serving 69,000 vehicles, while the least busiest section was southwest of Allyn-Grapeview at an intersection with Grapeview Loop Road, serving 6,600 vehicles. SR 3 is designated as a STRAHNET corridor within National Highway System, connecting Naval Base Kitsap to the state highway system between Gorst and Bangor, while the rest of the highway is part of the system, which includes roadways important to the national economy, defense, and mobility. WSDOT designates the entire route of SR 3 as a Highway of Statewide Significance, which includes highways that connect major communities in the state of Washington.

==History==
SR 3 follows the route of a paved section of State Road 21 between Belfair and Port Gamble on the Kitsap Peninsula that was added to the state highway system in 1915. The highway was later split between the Navy Yard Highway from Belfair to Bremerton and State Road 21 from Bremerton to Port Gamble in 1919. In 1923, the state highway system was restructured and the Navy Yard Highway was numbered as State Road 14, while State Road 21 kept its designation. The Navy Yard Highway, an unpaved highway connecting Union to Charleston, was dedicated on June 12, 1923.

During the creation of the primary and secondary state highway system in 1937, the paved State Roads 14 and 21 kept their numerical designations and became PSH 14 and PSH 21, respectively. PSH 21 was extended southwest from Bremerton on the former Navy Yard Highway to Gorst, while PSH 14 turned south at Gorst and headed towards Tacoma. A branch of PSH 14, named SSH 14A, was designated on a gravel road that connected the main highway at Belfair to US 101 in Shelton. In 1955, PSH 21 was extended southwest along PSH 14 from Gorst to Union, shortening PSH 14 to its current route as SR 16.

During the 1964 highway renumbering, a new state route system replaced the existing primary and secondary state highways and SR 3 was designated along SSH 14A, PSH 14, and PSH 21 on its present route when it was codified in 1970. Construction of the freeway section of SR 3 began in 1963 between SR 304 in Navy Yard City and Silverdale west of Bremerton and was opened in February 1968 at a cost of $2.2 million. The freeway was extended north towards Poulsbo in late 1973, and further north to Naval Submarine Base Bangor in 1981 after the arrival of &quot;Ohio&quot;-class submarines at Bangor. The Poulsbo section was widened and extended through an interchange with SR 305 in the early 1990s. The freeway was originally intended to connect with SR 16 (itself upgraded to a freeway in the 1970s and 1980s) with a bridge across the Sinclair Inlet.

In the 2000s, WSDOT re-built the interchange between SR 3 and SR 303 in Silverdale at a cost of $26 million, paid for by a 2003 gas tax. The new interchange, opened in November 2007, split the western terminus of SR 303 between two exits, signed as 45A and 45B, and removed a loop ramp that created turning conflicts. WSDOT began study of a Belfair bypass in 1966 and completed a provisional report in 2010 that did not recommend constructing a bypass of the community, instead opting for a project to widen the highway and add safety improvements that began work in late 2013. The project was revived later in the decade and is scheduled to be completed by 2026, carrying the new alignment of SR 3 while the existing road remains as a business route through Belfair.

<text>Germán Darío Lux (born 7 June 1982) is an Argentine former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper.

After starting out at River Plate, he spent most of his career in Spain with Mallorca and Deportivo.

==Club career==
===River Plate===
Lux was born in Carcarañá, Santa Fe Province. Nicknamed &quot;Poroto&quot;, he joined Club Atlético River Plate&#x27;s youth system aged 16, and made his Primera División debut in 2001. Shortly after, he became first choice.

In the 2006 &quot;Apertura&quot;, Lux lost his job to emergent talent Juan Pablo Carrizo and, a few months after, was cut from the squad by coach Daniel Passarella. In the beginning of the year he also lost his brother, who committed suicide.

===Mallorca===
Lux signed a four-year deal with RCD Mallorca for 2007–08, as a backup to youth graduate Miguel Ángel Moyá, but benefitted from an injury to the latter to appear in ten La Liga matches during the season. In his second year, the same occurred: Moyá was again downed with physical problems and Lux was promoted to starter, but lost his job in January 2009 with the signing of Dudu Aouate from Deportivo de La Coruña.

===Deportivo===
In the following two seasons, Lux was almost exclusively restricted to Copa del Rey matches with Mallorca, only totalling five league appearances. The same fate befell him at his next club, Deportivo La Coruña, where he initially played second-fiddle to Dani Aranzubia.

Lux was again the starter in the 2013–14 campaign, as the Galicians finished runners-up in the Segunda División and subsequently returned to the top flight. Afterwards, he alternated in goal with Fabricio.

===Return to River===
On 26 June 2017, ten years after leaving for Europe, the 35-year-old Lux returned to River Plate on a three-year contract. In December 2021, after several years as backup to Franco Armani where he was often criticised for his performances, he announced his retirement.

==International career==
As a starter during the 2004 Summer Olympics (all six matches, no goals conceded), Lux was instrumental in the gold medal triumph of the Argentina national team, who scored 17. He made his full debut on 9 March 2005 in a 1–1 friendly draw against Mexico, as manager José Pékerman only fielded players based in the Argentine league.

Lux was also first-choice in the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup for the runners-up. He was left out of the squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, however, and Oscar Ustari was picked instead.

==Personal life==
Lux&#x27;s older brother, Javier, was also a footballer. A midfielder, he played for several teams during his career.

<doc id="1024110" wikidata="Q1152568" url="?curid=1024110" title="Pingyuan Province">
<text>Pingyuan () was a former province of the People&#x27;s Republic of China that existed between 1949 and 1952. Its capital was Xinxiang, now in Henan province.

==History==
Pingyuan Province was established on August 20, 1949, comprising adjoining prefectures in the provinces of Henan and Shandong:

*Xinxiang, Henan (along with then-separate urban centre Xinxiang City)
*Puyang, Henan
*Anyang, Henan (along with then-separate urban centre Anyang City)
*Heze, Shandong
*Huxi, Shandong
*Liaocheng, Shandong

Pan Fusheng was the first Communist Party Chief of the province, and Chao Zhefu was its only governor. In March 1950, a number of peasants and cattle froze to death when transporting grain to government storage in Puyang prefecture. Pan took partial responsibility for the &quot;Puyang Incident&quot; and was demoted to deputy party chief. He was replaced by Wu De.

The province was abolished on November 15, 1952. Its component territories were returned to their original provinces - with the exception of Anyang&#x27;s Wu&#x27;an, Shexian and Linzhang counties, which were transferred to Handan prefecture in Hebei.

<doc id="1024113" wikidata="Q2614627" url="?curid=1024113" title="Abortion in Chile">
<text>Chile&#x27;s abortion laws have evolved significantly in recent years. Since 2017, abortion has been legal under three specific circumstances: when the woman&#x27;s life is at risk, in cases of rape (within 12 weeks of pregnancy or 14 weeks if the victim is under 14), and in instances of severe fetal malformations. Despite these legal changes, some medical professionals refuse to perform abortions, particularly in rape cases.

The shift toward broader reproductive rights began in 2006 when activists successfully pushed for the legalization of emergency contraceptives under President Michelle Bachelet&#x27;s administration. By 2010, public health centers were mandated to provide free emergency contraception to individuals over 14 years old without requiring parental consent.

In August 2017, the National Congress approved a bill legalizing abortion under the aforementioned conditions. This legislation took effect in September 2017, following a constitutional challenge by conservative groups. By January 2018, abortion services became available under public and private medical coverage.

Further attempts to expand reproductive rights have faced setbacks. In November 2021, the Chamber of Deputies rejected a bill to decriminalize abortion up to 14 weeks. Similarly, in 2022, a proposed constitution that included provisions for reproductive rights and abortion legalization was rejected by a majority of Chilean voters in a national referendum.

== Legal background ==
In 1931, the Health Code introduced a provision allowing therapeutic abortion, permitting women whose lives were at risk to undergo the procedure with the approval of two doctors. However, this provision was abolished by the military dictatorship on September 15, 1989, citing advancements in medicine that made it &quot;no longer justifiable.&quot;

The current laws regarding abortion are codified in the penal code under articles 342 to 345, which address &quot;Crimes and Offences against Family Order, Public Morality and Sexual Integrity.&quot; According to these laws, illegal abortions are punishable by up to five years of imprisonment for the person performing the procedure, and up to ten years if violence is used against the pregnant woman. If a pregnant woman consents to or performs an illegal abortion on herself, she may face up to five years in prison. Additionally, a medical doctor practicing an illegal abortion may be sentenced to up to 15 years of imprisonment. The country&#x27;s constitution, in article 19-1, states that &quot;the law protects the life of those about to be born.&quot; Prior to 2022, a two-thirds majority in each chamber of the Chilean Congress was required to amend this article.

Since 1990, legislators have submitted 15 bills related to abortion for discussion in Congress, with 12 bills presented in the Chamber of Deputies and three in the Senate. Approximately half of these bills aimed to increase existing penalties or create legal barriers to hinder the legalization of abortion. Two other bills suggested the construction of monuments to commemorate the &quot;innocent victims of abortion.&quot; Four bills have requested allowing abortion when the mother&#x27;s life is at risk, and one bill proposed it in cases of rape. Currently, nine bills are under review, while one has been rejected. Five others have been archived, meaning they have not been discussed for two years. Two identical bills requesting the reinstatement of therapeutic abortion as it was before 1989 are currently under review in the Chamber&#x27;s Medical Commission. The first bill was submitted on January 23, 2003, and the latest on March 19, 2009.

In November 2013, during the administration of conservative President Sebastián Piñera, a law was enacted declaring March 25 as the &quot;day of those about to be born and of adoption.&quot;

== Legalization ==
On January 31, 2015, President Michelle Bachelet submitted a draft bill to Congress with the aim of decriminalizing abortion in specific cases. The proposed cases included situations where the mother&#x27;s life is at risk, when the fetus will not survive the pregnancy, and in instances of rape during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy (18 weeks if the woman is under 14 years old). On August 2, 2017, Congress approved the bill, reducing the allowable timeframe to 14 weeks in the case of a girl under 14 who has been raped. A request from the opposition to declare the law unconstitutional was rejected by the country&#x27;s Constitutional Court in a 6-4 decision on August 21, 2017.

The court ruling allowed health facilities to refuse to provide abortions by claiming &quot;conscientious objector&quot; status, although the bill, as approved by Congress, granted this right only to individuals. President Bachelet promulgated the law on September 14, 2017, and it was published in the country&#x27;s official gazette on September 23, 2017. The Ministry of Health published a protocol for &quot;conscientious objectors&quot; on January 27, 2018. Subsequently, medical coverage in both the public and private sectors became available on January 29, 2018.

On March 23, 2018, the incoming administration of Sebastián Piñera made modifications to the protocol, allowing private health institutions receiving state funds to invoke conscientious objection. However, in May 2018, the Office of the Comptroller General declared both versions of the protocol illegal. In October 2018, the government published an amended protocol, reinstating the prohibition on private health institutions receiving state funds from invoking conscientious objection. Nevertheless, in December 2018, the Constitutional Court, acting on a request from a group of lawmakers supporting the sitting administration, deemed that specific section of the protocol unconstitutional.

== Women&#x27;s health ==
An amendment made by the Chilean government to section 119 of the Health Code in 1989 stated that there could be no actions taken that would induce an abortion. This amendment was made due to the belief that with medical advances in maternal care, abortion was no longer seen as a necessary means of saving a woman&#x27;s life.

Concern over high rates of abortion and high maternal mortality rates led the Chilean government to launch a publicly funded family planning program in 1964. Deaths due to illegal abortions dropped from 118 to 24 per 100,000 live births between 1964 and 1979.

There was also a statistically significant decrease in maternal deaths due to abortion from 1990 to 2000. Experts attribute the decline in hospitalizations due to abortion during this period to the increased use of sterilization and antibiotics by illegal abortion providers, the increased availability of the abortifacient drug misoprostol, and the increased use of contraception. In terms of accessibility, in 2002 it was noted that most of the family planning services were offered to married women.

A 2015 study by the Chilean epidemiologist Elard Koch has shown that the decreasing trend in maternal deaths due to abortion has continued through 2009. These results challenge the common notion that less permissive abortion laws lead to greater mortality associated with abortion. Koch states that the increases in women&#x27;s education and in community support programs for women with unplanned pregnancies have contributed to the reduction of induced abortions and maternal deaths in Chile.

In the period 2000 to 2004, abortion was the third leading cause of maternal mortality in the country, accounting for 12% of all maternal deaths. While there are no accurate statistics, it is estimated that between 2000 and 2002 there were between 132,000 and 160,000 abortions in the country.

A 1997 study found that the majority of eighty women prosecuted in Santiago for having an abortion were young, single mothers, and that many were domestic workers who had moved to the city from rural areas. It also found most of the women were reported to authorities by the hospital at which they sought treatment for their complications, and had no legal representation, or were defended by inexperienced law students.

== Public opinion ==
A July 2006 MORI survey found that 26% of Chileans believed that abortion is &quot;justified&quot;, up from 18% in 1990.

A July 2008 all-female nationwide face-to-face poll by NGO Corporación Humanas found that 79.2% of Chilean women were in favor of decriminalizing abortion when the life of the pregnant woman is at risk; 67.9% said it was urgent to legislate on the matter. According to the study, 74.0% of women believed abortion should be permitted in cases of rape, 70.1% in instances of fetal abnormality and 24% in all cases a woman decided it was appropriate.

A March 2009 nationwide telephone poll published by &quot;La Tercera&quot; newspaper found 67% were against abortion, 19% in favor and 11% in favor only in extreme cases. Regarding abortion when the life of the pregnant woman is at risk, 48% were in favor, 3% only in extreme cases and 47% were against. In cases where the baby would be born with a defect or disease that would most likely cause the baby&#x27;s death, 51% were against permitting an abortion, 45% were in favor and 2% only in extreme cases. 83% were against performing an abortion on an underage girl who had unprotected sex, while 14% were in favor. 57% were in favor of abortion in the case of rape, with 39% against it.

An October 2009 opinion poll published by Universidad Diego Portales and covering 85% of urban areas of Chile found that a majority were against abortion when the pregnant woman or couple did not have the economic means to raise a baby (80%), when the pregnant woman or couple did not want to have a baby (68%), and when the fetus had a &quot;serious defect&quot; (51%). On the other hand, a majority were in favor of abortion when the pregnant woman&#x27;s health is at risk (63%) and in cases of rape (64%).

A January 2017 opinion poll conducted by CADEM found that 57% wanted abortion to be allowed in only a few cases, while 19% wanted abortion illegal in all cases and 22% wanted it legal in all cases. A majority were in favor of abortion when the woman&#x27;s health is at risk (76%), when the fetus does not have a high probability of survival (72%), and when a woman is pregnant as a result of rape (71%), while only a minority supported abortion in cases of a fetus having a physical disability (36%) and in cases of a mother not being able to afford a child (20%).

In August 2021, a Cadem survey showed that 46% of Chileans agree with abortion within 14 weeks, 52% disapprove of the measure and another 2% did not know or did not respond.

== Church influence ==
Around 66% of Chilean citizens identify themselves as members of the Catholic Church, and the government observes many Catholic holidays. The Church has consistently maintained conservative views on abortion while supporting birth control as a means of preventing abortion.  

In the 1960s, the Church supported family planning initiatives aimed at reducing maternal mortality rates and stemming the rapid population growth of the time. During the Christian Democratic government of the 1960s, the Church supported the use of contraceptive pills. With the military coup of Augusto Pinochet, there was a return to a new conservative approach in the Catholic Church during the 1980s and 1990s, which is argued to still be strong today.

Today, Catholic arguments in the abortion debates often cite Pope Paul VI&#x27;s &quot;Humanae vitae&quot;, an argument that asserts that there should be no unnatural intervention in family building between a man and a woman. This argument is mainly used against abortion but has also been used as an argument against birth control. However, this argument is not the sole view of Catholics in Chile. While the majority of Catholic leaders do not support abortion or contraceptives, there are arguments that find that practicing &quot;sensus fidel&quot; or simply being faithful is enough and that &quot;Humanae vitae&quot; does not accurately reflect the necessity of modern-day practices. 

There are two important conservative Catholic groups that influence modern-day abortion dialogue: 

# Opus Dei is a Catholic organization that was formed in 1928 by St. Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer y Albás. Opus Dei has a rigid structure to its approach towards Catholic practice and is against abortion. It has been criticized for aggressively recruiting elites, given that it was formed with highly influential and educated members. Opus Dei continues to enjoy the support of the Vatican.
# The Legionaries of Christ is a Catholic organization formed in 1941 by Marcial Maciel, a controversial figure who was asked by Pope Benedict XVI to step down from his priesthood duties in 2005 in light of accusations that he had committed abuse against minors. The Legionaries of Christ are known to recruit members and have influence in elite business sectors in Chile.

These two groups are thought to have influence in more elite circles in Chile which then influence public opinion on abortion as well as policies regarding abortion access.

== International reaction ==
In November 2004, the United Nations (UN) committee monitoring compliance with the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) ruled that Chile should allow abortion in cases of rape and incest. In 2007, the United Nations Human Rights Council expressed concern over the country&#x27;s &quot;improperly restrictive&quot; legislation on abortion, especially in cases where the life of the mother is at risk. The UN&#x27;s High Commissioner for Human Rights also expressed concern over the country&#x27;s &quot;excessively restrictive abortion laws&quot; in May 2009.

<doc id="1024131" wikidata="Q260802" url="?curid=1024131" title="Jean Bourgain">
<text>Jean Louis, baron Bourgain (; – ) was a Belgian mathematician. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1994 in recognition of his work on several core topics of mathematical analysis such as the geometry of Banach spaces, harmonic analysis, ergodic theory and nonlinear partial differential equations from mathematical physics.

==Biography==
Bourgain received his PhD from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel in 1977. He was a faculty member at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and, from 1985 until 1995, professor at Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques at Bures-sur-Yvette in France, at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey from 1994 until 2018. He was an editor for the &quot;Annals of Mathematics&quot;. From 2012 to 2014, he was a visiting scholar at UC Berkeley.

His research work included several areas of mathematical analysis such as the geometry of Banach spaces, harmonic analysis, analytic number theory, combinatorics, ergodic theory, partial differential equations and spectral theory, and later also group theory. He proved the uniqueness of the solutions for the initial value problem of the Korteweg–De Vries equation. He formulated what became known as the Bourgain slicing problem in high-dimensional convex geometry. In 1985, he proved Bourgain&#x27;s embedding theorem in metric dimension reduction, which states that every metric space can be embedded into an formula_1 space of dimension formula_2 with distortion formula_3. Together with Vitali Milman, he contributed to progress on Mahler’s conjecture in 1987. In 2000, Bourgain connected the Kakeya problem to arithmetic combinatorics. As a researcher, he was the author or coauthor of more than 500 articles.

Together with Ciprian Demeter and Larry Guth, he proved Vinogradov&#x27;s mean-value theorem in 2015.

Bourgain was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in late 2014. He died of it on 22 December 2018 at a hospital in Bonheiden, Belgium.

== Awards and recognition ==
Bourgain received several awards during his career, the most notable being the Fields Medal in 1994.

In 2009 Bourgain was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

In 2010, he received the Shaw Prize in Mathematics.

In 2012, he and Terence Tao received the Crafoord Prize in Mathematics from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

In 2015, he was made a baron by king Philippe of Belgium.

In 2016, he received the 2017 Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics.

In 2017, he received the 2018 Leroy P. Steele Prizes.

<doc id="1024133" wikidata="Q7776063" url="?curid=1024133" title="The World Tomorrow (radio and television)">
<text>The World Tomorrow is a half-hour radio and television program which was sponsored by the Worldwide Church of God (originally known as the Radio Church of God) led by Herbert W. Armstrong. It originally ran from 1934 to 1994. A 15-minute version of the radio program (under varied translations of &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot;) was broadcast in the French, German, Italian, Russian, and Spanish languages.

==Radio==
Herbert W. Armstrong secured a temporary 15-minute slot on KORE, Eugene, Oregon, on October 9, 1933. That became a permanent half-hour slot on January 7, 1934. Armstrong founded the Radio Church of God with the first broadcast in 1934, to serve as the home church for his pioneering broadcast-based ministry. Armstrong&#x27;s radio program &quot;eventually reached millions with its message of the imminent end of the world to be followed by the second coming of Christ.&quot;

Following the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair in New York City, the broadcast was renamed &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot;, inspired by the theme of the fair, &quot;the World of Tomorrow&quot;. In 1968, the Radio Church of God changed its name to the Worldwide Church of God.

==Television==
There have been three eras of &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot; on television.

===1950s===
The first era featured Herbert W. Armstrong speaking from a Hollywood sound stage in the 1950s, before the advent of videotape, when all syndicated programs had to be recorded on film. The original series was shown on a portion of the ABC Television Network for half an hour, once a week, in black and white.

===1967 to 1986===
The second era began in 1967, beginning with black-and-white television broadcasts before changing to color in 1968. They continued well into the 1980s. The presenter was originally Garner Ted Armstrong, youngest son of Herbert Armstrong. Following his ouster from his father&#x27;s church in mid-1978 and his subsequent founding of his own church, the Church of God International, Herbert W. Armstrong resumed the presentation. The broadcasts largely involved analysis of how current events in the world tied into the church&#x27;s views of Biblical prophecies. Both the radio and television broadcasts of &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot; invariably told their audience how to receive the church&#x27;s magazine, &quot;The Plain Truth&quot;, the content of which was largely similar to that of the broadcasts.

At its peak, the radio program was broadcast worldwide on 360 stations, and the television program was viewed by 20 million people on 165 stations.

===1986 to 1994===
Following Herbert Armstrong&#x27;s death in 1986, the television program was presented by David Hulme, David Albert, Richard Ames, and Ronald Kelley, on a rotating basis until 1994, when doctrinal shifts in the Worldwide Church of God, and declining revenues, led to the program&#x27;s cancellation.

==Format==
The programs originated daily in a half-hour format, primarily from a studio located on the campus of Ambassador College in Pasadena, California, which was owned and operated by the church as a then-unaccredited liberal arts institution. Other studios were located at Ambassador College, Bricket Wood, Herts, England, and Ambassador College (later accredited as Ambassador University) at Big Sandy, Texas, U.S.

In 1958, Garner Ted Armstrong took over the narration of the half-hour all-talk presentation.

The program was introduced and concluded by the voice of Hollywood radio and television announcer Art Gilmore. &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot; concluded with a segment of music from the Capitol Hi &quot;Q&quot; production music library (Reel M-27, cue C-95B, &quot;Documentary Legato End Title&quot;, composed by William Loose) over which Art Gilmore gave the program address which varied according to the country that it was being aired in, or where its broadcast was intended to be received.

===International versions===
A 15-minute and usually once-a-week version of the same program was broadcast by various speakers in the French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish languages.

* French: The French language edition was primarily aired in parts of Canada and Haiti over several local stations and in Europe over the super-power station Europe 1. The presenter was Dibar Apartian who recorded the programs in the same studio used by Herbert W. and later Garner Ted Armstrong on the Pasadena, California campus of Ambassador College. The program was also supported by a French-language edition of &quot;The Plain Truth&quot; magazine.
* German: The German language edition was primarily aired in Europe over Europe 1. The presenter was a graduate of Ambassador College in Pasadena where the program was recorded. The program was supported by a German language edition of &quot;The Plain Truth&quot; magazine.
* Italian: The Italian language edition was primarily aired in Montreal, Quebec and Toronto, Ontario in Canada over two local stations. The presenter was also a graduate of Ambassador College in Pasadena where the program was also recorded.
* Russian: The Russian language edition was primarily aired for a short period of time in the 1950s-1960s over the super-power station Radio Monte Carlo, which was beamed towards the USSR. The presenter was a Russian-language Hollywood presenter who translated the English scripts and then recorded the programs.
* Spanish: The Spanish language edition was primarily aired in parts of South America, although it was also aired from Porto, Portugal. The original presenter was Dr. Benjamin Rea who was Vice-Chancellor of Ambassador College at Bricket Wood in Hertfordshire, England which is where he recorded the programs in the radio studio located on the campus. The program was also supported by a Spanish language edition of &quot;La Pura Verdad&quot; magazine.

===Archived episodes===
Copies of &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot; broadcast episodes from 1978 to 1983 are held in the Television Religion Collection of the United States Library of Congress. The copies were placed into the Library of Congress archival holdings at the request of United States Senator Bob Dole.

==Rights to use title==
A new trademark for the television program name &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot; was registered in 2004 by Earl and Shirley Timmons. The Timmons, members of the WCG, and Garner Ted Armstrong&#x27;s Church of God International and Intercontinental Church of God, split from the Armstrong organization after the death of Garner Ted Armstrong, forming a breakaway independent group named Church of God, Worldwide Ministries, with its headquarters in Sevierville, Tennessee.

<doc id="1024142" wikidata="Q139708" url="?curid=1024142" title="Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon">
<text>The Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon (; , also referred to as the Levant States; 1923−1946) was a League of Nations mandate founded in the aftermath of the First World War and the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire, concerning the territories of Syria and Lebanon. The mandate system was supposed to differ from colonialism, with the governing country intended to act as a trustee until the inhabitants were considered eligible for self-government. At that point, the mandate would terminate and a sovereign state would be born.

During the two years that followed the end of the war in 1918—and in accordance with the Sykes–Picot Agreement signed by the United Kingdom and French Third Republic during the war—the British held control of most of Ottoman Iraq (now Iraq) and the southern part of Ottoman Syria (now Israel, Palestine and Transjordan), while the French controlled the rest of Ottoman Syria (including Lebanon, Alexandretta, and portions of Cilicia). In the early 1920s, British and French control of these territories became formalized by the League of Nations&#x27; mandate system. And on 29 September 1923 France was assigned the League of Nations mandate of Syria, which included the territory of present-day Lebanon and Alexandretta in addition to modern Syria. The League of Nations monitored the mandates through the Permanent Mandates Commision (PMC). The PMC allowed other states to voice their thoughts on the management of the mandates, such as in economic matters.

The administration of the region under the French was carried out through a number of different governments and territories, including the Syrian Federation (1922–1924), the State of Syria (1925-1930) and the Mandatory Syrian Republic (1930–1946), as well as smaller states: Greater Lebanon, the Alawite State, and the Jabal Druze State. Hatay State was annexed by Turkey in 1939. The French mandate lasted until 1946, when French troops eventually left Syria and Lebanon, which had both declared independence during World War II.

==Background==
With the defeat of the Ottomans in Syria, British troops, under General Sir Edmund Allenby, entered Damascus in 1918 accompanied by troops of the Arab Revolt led by Faisal, son of Hussein bin Ali, King of Hejaz. Faisal established the first new postwar Arab government in Damascus in October 1918, and named Ali Rikabi a military governor.
The new Arab administration formed local governments in the major Syrian cities, and the pan-Arab flag was raised all over Syria. The Arabs hoped, with faith in earlier British promises, that the new Arab state would include all the Arab lands stretching from Aleppo in northern Syria to Aden in southern Yemen.

However, in accordance with the secret Sykes–Picot Agreement between Britain and France, General Allenby assigned to the Arab administration only the interior regions of Syria (the eastern zone). Palestine (the southern zone) was reserved for the British. On 8 October, French troops disembarked in Beirut and occupied the Lebanese coastal region south to Naqoura (the western zone), replacing British troops there. The French immediately dissolved the local Arab governments in the region.

France demanded full implementation of the Sykes–Picot Agreement, with Syria under its control. On 26 November 1919, British forces withdrew from Damascus to avoid confrontation with the French, leaving the Arab government to face France. Faisal had travelled several times to Europe since November 1918, trying to convince France and Britain to change their positions, but without success. France&#x27;s determination to intervene in Syria was shown by the naming of General Henri Gouraud as high commissioner in Syria and Cilicia. At the Paris Peace Conference, Faisal found himself in an even weaker position when the European powers decided to renege on the promises made to the Arabs. Throughout the early period of colonial administration, collaboration persisted between British and French authorities in the region, in fulfillment of economic interests of both parties in the region, such as in the establishment of a customs-free zone for goods produced within the British and French controlled territories. 

In May 1919, elections were held for the Syrian National Congress, which convened in Damascus. 80% of seats went to conservatives. However, the minority included dynamic Arab nationalist figures such as Jamil Mardam Bey, Shukri al-Kuwatli, Ahmad al-Qadri, Ibrahim Hanano, and Riyad as-Solh. The head was moderate nationalist Hashim al-Atassi.

In June 1919, the American King–Crane Commission arrived in Syria to inquire into local public opinion about the future of the country. The commission&#x27;s remit extended from Aleppo to Beersheba. They visited 36 major cities, met with more than 2,000 delegations from more than 300 villages, and received more than 3,000 petitions. Their conclusions confirmed the opposition of Syrians to the mandate in their country as well as to the Balfour Declaration, and their demand for a unified Greater Syria encompassing Palestine. The conclusions of the commission were ignored by both Britain and France.

Unrest erupted in Syria when Faisal accepted a compromise with French Prime Minister Clemenceau. Anti-Hashemite demonstrations broke out, and Muslim inhabitants in and around Mount Lebanon revolted in fear of being incorporated into a new, mainly Christian, state of Greater Lebanon. A part of France&#x27;s claim to these territories in the Levant was that France had been acknowledged as a protector of the minority Christian communities by the Ottoman Empire.

In March 1920, the Congress in Damascus adopted a resolution rejecting the Faisal-Clemenceau accords. The congress declared the independence of Syria in her natural borders (including Southern Syria or Palestine), and proclaimed Faisal the king of all Arabs. Faisal invited Ali Rikabi to form a government. The congress also proclaimed political and economic union with neighboring Iraq and demanded its independence as well.

On 25 April, the supreme inter-Allied council, which was formulating the Treaty of Sèvres, granted France the mandate of Syria (including Lebanon), and granted Britain the Mandate of Palestine (with Trans-Jordan later), and Iraq. Syrians reacted with violent demonstrations, and a new government headed by Hashim al-Atassi was formed on 7 May 1920. The new government decided to organize general conscription and began forming an army.
These decisions provoked adverse reactions by France as well as by the Maronite patriarchate of Mount Lebanon, which denounced the decisions as a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. In Beirut, the Christian press expressed its hostility to the decisions of Faisal&#x27;s government. Lebanese nationalists used the crisis against Faisal&#x27;s government to convene a council of Christian figures in Baabda that proclaimed the independence of Lebanon on 22 March 1920.

On 14 July 1920, General Gouraud issued an ultimatum to Faisal, giving him the choice between submission or abdication. Realizing that the power balance was not in his favor, Faisal chose to cooperate. However, the young minister of war, Youssef al-Azmeh, refused to comply. In the resulting Franco-Syrian War, Syrian troops under al-Azmeh, composed of the little remaining troops of the Arab army along with Bedouin horsemen and civilian volunteers, met the better trained 12,000-strong French forces under General Mariano Goybet at the Battle of Maysaloun. The French won the battle in less than a day and Azmeh died on the battlefield, along with many of the Syrian troops, while the remaining troops possibly defected. General Goybet captured Damascus with little resistance on 24 July 1920, and the mandate was written in London two years later on 24 July 1922.

==States created during the French Mandate==

Arriving in Lebanon, the French were received as protectors by many Maronite Christians, who saw their rule as a step toward autonomy, but in the rest of Syria, the French faced widespread resistance.

The mandate region was subdivided into six states. They were the states of Damascus (1920), Aleppo (1920), Alawites (1920), Jabal Druze (1921), the autonomous Sanjak of Alexandretta (1921, modern-day Hatay), and the State of Greater Lebanon (1920), which became later the modern country of Lebanon.

While these divisions were partly were based in part on the sectarian demographics, they also reflected French colonial strategy. By encouraging localized identities, the French sought to weaken nationalist movements prevent the emergence of a unified identity. Many of the different Syrian sects were hostile to the French mandate and to the division it created, as shown by the numerous revolts that the French encountered in all of the Syrian states. The Maronite Christians of Mount Lebanon, on the other hand, were a community with a dream of independence that was being realized under the French. Therefore, Greater Lebanon was the exception among the newly formed states.

It took France three years from 1920 to 1923 to gain full control over Syria and to quell all the insurgencies that broke out, notably in the Alawite territories, Mount Druze and Aleppo.

Although there were uprisings in the different states, the French deliberately gave different ethnic and religious groups in the Levant their own lands in the hopes of prolonging their rule. The French hoped to fragment the various groups in the region, to mitigate support for the Syrian nationalist movement seeking to end colonial rule. The administration of the state governments was heavily dominated by the French. Local authorities were given very little power and did not have the authority to independently decide policy. The small amount of power that local leaders had could easily be overruled by French officials. The French did everything in their power to prevent people in the Levant from developing self-sufficient governing bodies.







===State of Greater Lebanon===

On 3 August 1920, Arrêté 299 of the &quot;Haut-commissariat de la République française en Syrie et au Liban&quot; linked the cazas of Hasbaya, Rachaya, Maallaka and Baalbeck to what was then known as the Autonomous Territory of Lebanon. Then on 31 August 1920, General Gouraud signed Arrêté 318 delimiting the State of Greater Lebanon, with explanatory notes stating that Lebanon would be treated separately from the rest of Syria. On 1 September 1920, General Gouraud publicly proclaimed the creation of the State of Greater Lebanon (, ) at a ceremony in Beirut.

Greater Lebanon was created by France to be a &quot;safe haven&quot; for the Maronite population of the &quot;mutasarrifia&quot; (Ottoman administrative unit) of Mount Lebanon. Mt. Lebanon, an area with a Maronite majority, had enjoyed varying degrees of autonomy during the Ottoman era. However, in addition to the Maronite Mutasarrifia other, mainly Muslim, regions were added, forming &quot;Greater&quot; Lebanon. Those regions correspond today to North Lebanon, South Lebanon, Biqa&#x27; valley, and Beirut. The capital of Greater Lebanon was Beirut. The new state was granted a flag, merging the French flag with the cedar of Lebanon.
Maronites were the majority in Lebanon and managed to preserve its independence; an independence that created a unique precedent in the Arab world, as Lebanon was the first Arab country in which Christians were not a minority. The State of Greater Lebanon existed until 23 May 1926, after which it became the Lebanese Republic.

Most Muslims in Greater Lebanon rejected the new state upon its creation. Some believe that the continuous Muslim demand for reunification with Syria eventually brought about an armed conflict between Muslims and Christians in 1958 when Lebanese Muslims wanted to join the newly proclaimed United Arab Republic, while Lebanese Christians were strongly opposed. However, most members of the Lebanese Muslim communities and their political elites were committed to the idea of being Lebanese citizens by the late 1930s, even though they also tended to nurture Arab nationalist sentiments.

===State of Alawites===

On 19 August 1920, General Gouraud signed Arrêté 314 which added to the autonomous sandjak of Alexandretta the cazas of Jisr el-Choughour, the madriyehs of Baher and Bujack (caza of Latakia), the moudiriyeh of Kinsaba (caza of Sahyoun) &quot;with a view to the formation of the territories of Greater Lebanon and the Ansarieh Mountains&quot;; where the &quot;Ansarieh Mountains&quot; area was to become the Alawite State. On 31 August 1920, the same day that the decree creating Greater Lebanon was signed, General Gouraud signed Arrêté 319 delimiting the State of Alawites, and Arrêté 317 adding the caza of Massyaf (Omranie) into the new State.

The State of Alawites (, ) was located on the Syrian coast and incorporated a majority of Alawites, a branch of Shia Islam. The port city of Latakia was the capital of this state. Initially it was an autonomous territory under French rule known as the &quot;Alawite Territories&quot;. It became part of the Syrian Federation in 1922, but left the federation again in 1924 and became the &quot;State of Alawites&quot;. On 22 September 1930, it was renamed the &quot;Independent Government of Latakia&quot;. The population at this time was 278,000. The government of Latakia finally joined the Syrian Republic on 5 December 1936. This state witnessed several rebellions against the French, including that of Salih al-Ali (1918–1920).

On 28 June 1922, Arrêté 1459 created a &quot;Federation of the Autonomous States of Syria&quot; which included the State of Aleppo, the State of Damascus and the State of the Alawis. However, two and a half years later on 5 December 1924, Arrêté 2979 and Arrêté 2980 established the Alawite State as an independent state with Latakia as its capital, and separately unified the States of Aleppo and Damascus into a single State called &quot;État de Syrie&quot; (&quot;State of Syria&quot;), formally established on 1 January 1925.

In 1936, both Jebel Druze and the Alawite State were incorporated into the State of Syria.

===State of Syria===
On 1 September 1920, the day after the creation of Greater Lebanon and the Alawite State, Arrêté 330 separated out of the previous &quot;Gouvernement de Damas&quot; (&quot;Government of Damascus&quot;) an independent government known as the &quot;Gouvernement d&#x27;Alep&quot; (&quot;Government of Aleppo&quot;), including the autonomous sandjak of Alexandretta, which retained its administrative autonomy. The terms &quot;Gouvernement d&#x27;Alep&quot; &quot;Gouvernement de Damas&quot; were used interchangeably with &quot;l&#x27;État d&#x27;Alep&quot; and &quot;l&#x27;État de Damas&quot; – for example, Arrete 279 1 October 1920 stated in its preamble: &quot;Vu l&#x27;arrêté No 330 du 1er Septembre 1920 créant l&#x27;État d&#x27;Alep&quot;.

The State of Aleppo (1920–1925, , ) included a majority of Sunni Muslims. It covered northern Syria in addition to the entire fertile basin of river Euphrates of eastern Syria. These regions represented much of the agricultural and mineral wealth of Syria. The autonomous Sanjak of Alexandretta was added to the state of Aleppo in 1923. The capital was the northern city of Aleppo, which had large Christian and Jewish communities in addition to the Sunni Muslims. The state also incorporated minorities of Shiites and Alawites. Ethnic Kurds and Assyrians inhabited the eastern regions alongside the Arabs. The General Governors of the state were Kamil Pasha al-Qudsi (1920–1922) Mustafa Bey Barmada (1923) and Mar&#x27;i Pasha Al Mallah (1924-1925).

The State of Damascus was a French mandate from 1920 to 1925. The capital was Damascus.

The primarily Sunni population of the states of Aleppo and Damascus were strongly opposed to the division of Syria. This resulted in its quick end in 1925, when France united the states of Aleppo and Damascus into the State of Syria.

====Sanjak of Alexandretta====
The Sanjak of Alexandretta became an autonomous province of Syria under Article 7 of the French-Turkish treaty of 20 October 1921: &quot;A special administrative regime shall be established for the district of Alexandretta. The Turkish inhabitants of this district shall enjoy facility for their cultural development. The Turkish language shall have official recognition&quot;.

In 1923, Alexandretta was attached to the State of Aleppo, and in 1925 it was directly attached to the French mandate of Syria, still with special administrative status. The sanjak was given autonomy in November 1937 in an arrangement brokered by the League. Under its new statute, the sanjak became &#x27;distinct but not separated&#x27; from the French Mandate of Syria on the diplomatic level, linked to both France and Turkey for defence matters.

In 1938, the Turkish military went into the Syrian province and expelled most of its Alawite Arab and Armenian inhabitants. Before this, Alawi Arabs and Armenians were the majority of Alexandretta&#x27;s population.

The allocation of seats in the sanjak assembly was based on the 1938 census held by the French authorities under international supervision. The assembly was appointed in the summer of 1938, and the French-Turkish treaty settling the status of the Sanjak was signed on 4 July 1938.

On 2 September 1938, the assembly proclaimed the Sanjak of Alexandretta as the Hatay State. The republic lasted for one year under joint French and Turkish military supervision. The name &quot;Hatay&quot; itself was proposed by Atatürk and the government was under Turkish control.
In 1939, following a popular referendum, the Hatay State became a Turkish province.

===State of Jabal Druze===

On 24 October 1922, Arrêté 1641 established the &quot;&quot; (&quot;Autonomous State of Jabal Druze&quot;)

It was created for the Druze population of southern Syria. It had a population of some 50,000 and its capital in As-Suwayda.

In 1936, both Jebel Druze and the Alawite State were incorporated into the State of Syria.

==Demands for autonomy not granted by the French Mandate authorities==

===Al-Jazira Province===

In 1936–1937, there was some autonomist agitation among Assyrians and Kurds, supported by some Bedouins, in the province of Al-Jazira. Its partisans wanted the French troops to stay in the province in the event of a Syrian independence, as they feared the nationalist Damascus government would replace minority officials by Muslim Arabs from the capital. The French authorities refused to consider any new status of autonomy inside Syria.

===Golan Region===
In Quneitra and the Golan Region, there was a sizeable Circassian community. For the same reasons as their Assyrian, Kurdish and Bedouin counterparts in Al-Jazira province in 1936–1937, several Circassian leaders wanted a special autonomy status for their region in 1938, as they feared the prospect of living in an independent Syrian republic under a nationalist Arab government hostile towards the minorities. They also wanted the Golan region to become a national homeland for Circassian refugees from the Caucasus. A Circassian battalion served in the French Army of the Levant and had helped it against the Arab nationalist uprisings. As in Al-Jazira Province, the French authorities refused to grant any autonomy status to the Golan Circassians.

== Economy ==

Already in 1921, the French wanted to develop the agricultural sector and over a feasibility study of the &quot;Union Economique de Syrie&quot; the North-East Syrian and the Alawite State were deemed profitable for the cotton cultivation. Investments began in 1924, but it took until the 1930s to produce more than the level reached in 1925. Due to the high economic integration of the region, a trade separation would have harmed both mandates. In order to maintain the economic ties established in the region during Ottoman times the British and the French agreed to a customs-free zone between their mandates in 1921, even though this decision was protested by French manufacturers. The population of Palestine, Syria and Lebanon were strongly in favor of the customs-free zone and successfully protested against a possible abolition in 1927. This affected: local and imported goods, processed goods and goods currently in transit. By 1933, Palestine was the largest importer of Syrian goods, while the French held a share of 7.5% of the imports. Between the two World Wars, France became the largest trader of goods of the French Mandate. From 1933 onwards, Japan was also a large source for imports.

<text>In Japanese, is a military unit and may be literally translated as &quot;&quot;, &quot;task force&quot;, &quot;division (of ships)&quot;, &quot;group&quot; or &quot;wing&quot;. The terms &quot;regiment&quot; and &quot;flotilla&quot;, while sometimes used as translations of &quot;sentai&quot;, are also used to refer to larger formations.

==Imperial Japanese aviation &quot;sentai&quot;==
The term was used during World War II by the military of the Empire of Japan for Imperial Japanese Army Air Service (IJAAS) and Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (IJNAS) military aviation units equivalent to a group or wing in other air forces. However, the term had slightly different meanings in the IJAAS and the IJNAS.

An IJAAS &quot;Sentai&quot; was made up of two to four squadrons (&quot;chūtai&quot;). In the IJAAS, two or more &quot;Sentai&quot; comprised a &quot;hikōdan&quot; (air brigade). In the later stages of World War II, the IJAAS abolished &quot;chūtai&quot; and divided its &quot;sentai&quot; into &quot;hikōtai&quot; (flying units) and &quot;seibitai&quot; (maintenance units). A &quot;sentai&quot; commander (&quot;sentaichō&quot;) was generally a lieutenant colonel.

In the IJNAS, a &quot;sentai&quot; was a larger unit: a &quot;Kōkūtai&quot; was the equivalent of an IJAAS &quot;sentai&quot;. Several &quot;sentai&quot; made up a &quot;kantai&quot; (air fleet). In the IJNAS, a &quot;Sentaichō&quot; was usually a naval captain.

==Imperial Japanese naval &quot;sentai&quot;==
&quot;Sentai&quot; in the Japanese Navy were prescribed by the document &quot;Naval military command No. 10, dated 30 November 1914.

Paraphrased, they were defined as follows:
*: comprising two or more warships of the same type.
*: comprising two or more aircraft carriers, seaplane tenders or air groups.
*: comprising two or more destroyers, possibly with a light cruiser as a squadron flagship.
*: comprising two or more submarines, with a submarine tender or cruiser as submarine squadron leader, and some submarine divisions. The &quot;1st Sensui Sentai&quot; was formed on 1 April 1919 from the former &quot;4th Suirai Sentai&quot;.
*: comprising two or more landing ship divisions. First unit the &quot;1st Yusō Sentai&quot; was organized on 25 September 1944.
*: comprising a mother ship and individual suicide weapons, such as &quot;Kaiten&quot;, &quot;Kairyū&quot;, &quot;Kōryū&quot; and &quot;Shin&#x27;yō&quot;. The first such unit was the &quot;1st Tokkō Sentai&quot;, organized on 20 March 1945.

==Cultural references==

The is a franchise of Japanese tokusatsu television dramas produced by Toei and TV Asahi that uses the word &quot;sentai&quot; to describe a group of three or more costumed superheroes who often pilot fictional robotic vehicles to fight &quot;kaiju&quot;.

<doc id="1024156" wikidata="Q6286295" url="?curid=1024156" title="Joseph Plumb Martin">
<text>Joseph Plumb Martin (also spelled as Joseph Plum Martin; November 21, 1760 – May 2, 1850) was a soldier in the Connecticut Militia and Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, and was mustered out as a 23-year-old Sergeant in a Sapper company. His published narrative of his experiences, re-discovered in the 1950s, has become a valuable resource for historians in understanding the conditions of a common soldier of that era, as well as the battles in which Martin participated.

==Early life==
Joseph Plumb Martin was born in Becket, Massachusetts on November 21, 1760 to the Reverend Ebenezer Martin and Susannah Plumb. At the age of seven, he was sent to live with his affluent grandparents in Milford, Connecticut. Because his family was well-to-do (his father studied at Yale), Martin was able to receive a well-rounded education, including reading and writing.

==Revolutionary War service==
When Martin was 15, in 1775, he was eager to join the war effort following the Battles of Lexington and Concord. His grandparents initially opposed the idea, but agreed after Martin vowed to run away and join a naval ship as a privateer if he was not allowed to join. He joined the Connecticut Militia in June 1776 and was assigned duty in the New York City area, then under General George Washington&#x27;s command, arriving just before the opening of the British Long Island Campaign. His first tour of duty ended in December 1776, and he returned home just prior to the Battles of Trenton and Princeton.

After a restless winter and spring back in Connecticut, the 16-year-old veteran enlisted in the Continental Army on April 22, 1777, signing on for the duration of the American Revolutionary War. He served with the 17th Continental Regiment under the command of General James Varnum.

Martin participated in such notable engagements as the Battle of Brooklyn, the Battle of White Plains, the siege on Fort Mifflin and the Battle of Monmouth. He encamped at Valley Forge, witnessed John Andre being escorted to his execution and was also present during the climactic Siege of Yorktown. He was assigned to the Light Infantry in 1778, attaining the rank of Corporal. In the summer of 1780, under Washington&#x27;s order to form a Corps of Sappers and Miners, he was recommended by his superior officers to be a non-commissioned officer of this regiment, and in being selected, was promoted to Sergeant. Prior to Yorktown, the corps was responsible for digging the entrenchments for the Continental Army.

During the battle, they were also a vanguard for a regiment commanded by Alexander Hamilton, clearing the field of sharpened logs called abatis so that Hamilton&#x27;s regiment could capture Redoubt #10.

==Postwar years==
Martin was discharged from duty in June 1783, a few months before the Continental Army disbanded the following October. He taught in New York State for a year, and eventually settled on Maine&#x27;s frontier, becoming one of the founders of the town of Prospect, near modern-day Stockton Springs. Over the years, he was known locally for being a farmer, selectman, Justice of the Peace and Town Clerk (the last position being held for over 25 years).

He married Lucy Clewley (born 1776) in 1794 with whom he had five children: Joseph (born 1799), Nathan and Thomas (twins, born 1803), James Sullivan (born 1810), and Susan (born 1812). He also wrote many stories and poems over the years, most famously a narrative of his experiences during the war in 1830, apparently sourced from a journal that he had kept, but that is now lost.

In 1794, he became involved in a bitter land dispute with land speculator Henry Knox, former Major-General in the Continental Army and Secretary of War under George Washington&#x27;s administration as President. Knox claimed that he owned Martin&#x27;s farm, as well as the surrounding in an area now known as Waldo County, Maine. Martin claimed this was not true, and that he had the right to farm the land.

In 1797, Knox&#x27;s claim was upheld. Martin&#x27;s 100-acre farm was valued by three commissioners: one appointed by the settlers, one by the proprietors, and the third by the first two. Martin&#x27;s was appraised for the sum of $170, payable over six years in three installments either in cash or in farm products. He could not raise the money and begged Knox to allow him to keep the land. There is no evidence that Knox even acknowledged his plaintive letters and appeared to let him remain on the land. Plumb Martin farmed only eight(8) acres of the original 100 he opted for. Knox died in 1806, never demanding payment from Plumb Martin. By 1811, his farmland was cut by half, and by 1818, when he appeared in the Massachusetts General Court with other Revolutionary War veterans to claim a war pension, he owned nothing.

In 1818, Martin&#x27;s war pension was approved and he received $96 a year for the rest of his life. Still, other war veterans were fighting for what they were properly owed and, in an effort to further the cause of the veterans, Martin published his memoirs anonymously in 1830. It was not considered a success and mainly fell to the wayside, apparently lost to history. In 1836, a platoon of United States Light Infantry was marching through Prospect and discovered that Plumb Martin resided there. The platoon stopped outside of his house and fired a salute in honor of the Revolutionary War Hero.

==Death==
Martin died on May 2, 1850, at the age of 89. He is buried with his wife at the Sandy Point Cemetery, outside of Stockton Springs, Maine.

== Joseph Plumb Martin&#x27;s narrative ==
Martin&#x27;s narrative of the war has been frequently cited by scholars as an excellent primary source for the American Revolution. For most of the war, Martin was a private in the army, and his account does not involve the usual heroes of the Revolution. His narrative is considered one of the major primary sources for historians, researchers and re-enactors of the American Revolution. 

Martin&#x27;s narrative was originally published anonymously in 1830, at Hallowell, Maine, as &quot;A narrative of some of the adventures, dangers, and sufferings of a Revolutionary soldier, interspersed with anecdotes of incidents that occurred within his own observation&quot;. It has been republished in many forms, but was thought lost to history. In the mid-1950s, a first edition copy of the narrative was found and donated to Morristown National Historical Park. The book was published again by Little, Brown in 1962, and with permission reprinted by Eastern National in 2006, in an edition edited by George F. Scheer under the title &quot;Private Yankee Doodle&quot;; as well as appearing as a volume in Series I of &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ &quot;Eyewitness Accounts of the American Revolution&quot; in 1968. The current edition, published in 2001, is entitled &quot;A Narrative of a Revolutionary Soldier: Some of the Adventures, Dangers and Sufferings of Joseph Plumb Martin&quot;. Other current versions include a version adapted for children, entitled &quot;Yankee Doodle Boy&quot; and &quot;The Memoirs of a Revolutionary Soldier&quot;, and an annotated version entitled &quot;Private Yankee Doodle&quot;. His narrative is quoted in numerous works on the American Revolution, including those written by David McCullough and Robert Leckie.

Martin has been portrayed on various television documentaries/dramas: by Aaron Carter (in &quot;Liberty&#x27;s Kids&quot;), Philip Seymour Hoffman (in the PBS series &quot;Liberty! The American Revolution&quot;), and Rick Schroder (in &quot;The American Revolution&quot;). First edition copies of his narrative reside in the Library of Congress, the US Army Military History Institute at Carlisle, PA, as well as the collection of artifacts at Morristown National Historical Park. The Joseph Plumb Martin Trail, named in his honor, encircles Valley Forge National Historical Park in Pennsylvania.

<doc id="1024181" wikidata="Q50600" url="?curid=1024181" title="Carlos Tevez">
<text>Carlos Alberto Tevez (; né Martínez; born 5 February 1984) is an Argentine professional football manager and former player. A dynamic forward in his prime, Tevez was capable of playing as a striker, as a winger, as a supporting forward, or as an attacking midfielder. He was most recently the head coach of Primera División club Independiente.

Tevez began his career with Boca Juniors, winning the Copa Libertadores and Intercontinental Cup in 2003 before moving to Brazilian club Corinthians, where he won the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A. His moves to English clubs West Ham United in 2006 and Manchester United in 2007 were plagued by issues relating to his third-party ownership by Media Sports Investment, and their resulting sagas paved the way for changes to both Premier League and FIFA regulations.

In 2009, Tevez joined Manchester United&#x27;s rivals Manchester City. In the 2010–11 season he won the Premier League Golden Boot, and in the 2011–12 season he won the Premier League title. In 2013, he joined Juventus, where he won two &quot;Scudetti&quot; among other trophies. He returned to Boca Juniors in June 2015, before joining Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua the following years in a deal which made him one of the highest-paid footballers in the world. He again returned to Boca Juniors for a third spell in 2018, and won the 2017–18 and 2019–20 Primera División titles.

Tevez made his international debut for Argentina in 2004, earning 76 caps and scoring 13 times for the side. A gold medal and Summer Olympics Golden Boot winner at the 2004 Olympics, he also played at two FIFA World Cups, a FIFA Confederations Cup and four Copa América tournaments. He has been awarded the South American Footballer of the Year three times, the Footballer of the Year of Argentina twice, and the Argentine Sportsperson of the Year once. He has also been named in the South American Team of the Year three times. He announced his retirement from professional football in June 2022.

==Early life==
Tevez was born Carlos Alberto Martínez by his mother&#x27;s surname in Ciudadela, Buenos Aires Province, and raised in the neighbourhood of Ejército de Los Andes, better known as &quot;Fuerte Apache&quot;. It was from there he received the nickname of &quot;El Apache&quot;. His biological parents were Juan Alberto Cabral and Fabiana &quot;Trina&quot; Martínez. He was adopted by his maternal aunt Adriana Noemí Martínez and her husband Segundo Raimundo Tévez. His adopted parents changed his surname to his adopted father&#x27;s during a conflict between his junior club All Boys and Boca Juniors.

Tevez has a distinctive burn scar that runs down his neck from his right ear to his chest. He was accidentally scalded with boiling water as a child, which caused third-degree burns and kept him hospitalised in intensive care for nearly two months. After joining Boca Juniors, Tevez refused an offer from the club to have them cosmetically improved, saying the scars were a part of who he was in the past and who he is today.

The early life of Tevez was featured in &quot; (Spanish: Apache: La vida de Carlos Tevez)&quot;, an eight-part 2019 Argentine television series starring Balthazar Murillo, Sofía Gala and Vanesa González.

==Club career==

===Boca Juniors===

At age 16, Tevez made his debut for Boca Juniors against Talleres de Córdoba in the Torneo Apertura of the 2001–02 Argentine Primera División, on 21 October 2001. Boca Juniors were crowned champions of the 2001 Copa Libertadores and faced Bayern Munich at the 2001 Intercontinental Cup on 27 November, where they lost 1–0, although Tevez was not included in the squad. He went on to score 1 goal in 11 league appearances in the 2001–02 season. Boca had finished in first place of their 2002 Copa Libertadores group and had reached the quarter-finals, where they faced Paraguay&#x27;s Club Olimpia on 8 May. Tevez scored after 18 minutes in the first-leg to give Boca Juniors a 1–0 lead, until Olimpia levelled the scores in the 67th minute when Boca defender Cristian Traverso scored an own goal. Boca lost the second-leg 1–0 in Asunción on 16 May. Boca finished three points behind Independiente to finish in second position during the Torneo Apertura. Boca Juniors eventually finished four points behind River Plate to claim second position in the Torneo Clausura.

Tevez scored 10 goals in 32 appearances for Boca during the 2002–03 season. During the 2002 Copa Sudamericana, Boca were eliminated 3–1 on aggregate by Gimnasia de La Plata in the first round. Boca participated at the 2003 Copa Libertadores and reached the final of the competition, where they faced Santos. Boca won 5–1 on aggregate, with Tevez scoring in the 3–1 away win in the second leg. Tevez was also voted as the tournament&#x27;s best player. Tevez scored 12 goals in 23 appearances during the 2003–04 season. Boca were crowned champions of the Torneo Apertura, where Tevez finished as the Apertura&#x27;s seventh top goalscorer with eight goals. Boca then finished in second spot of the Torneo Clausura, four points behind River Plate. During the 2003 Copa Sudamericana, Boca Juniors reached the quarter-final stages where they were eliminated by Colombia&#x27;s Atlético Nacional 5–1 on aggregate. During the 2003 Intercontinental Cup, Tevez, who had just returned to the side from injury, entered the field in the 73rd minute for Guillermo Barros Schelotto, as Boca Juniors defeated Milan 3–1 on penalties to claim the Intercontinental Cup.

Boca had reached the final of the 2004 Copa Sudamericana, where they beat Bolivia&#x27;s Bolívar 2–1 on aggregate. Tevez scored in Boca&#x27;s 2–0 second-leg win. Boca finished as runners-up of the 2004 Copa Libertadores. Tevez scored in both games of Boca&#x27;s round of 16 wins against Peru&#x27;s Club Sporting Cristal. Tevez also scored for Boca Juniors in their 2–1 second-leg loss to arch rivals River Plate, having drawn them level 2–2 on aggregate, which Boca went on to win 5–4 on penalties. Tevez was sent off for imitating a chicken when celebrating a goal against River Plate, clearly mocking the opposition crowd, with River called &#x27;Gallinas&#x27; (&#x27;chickens&#x27;) by other fans for their habit choking late on. Boca played against Colombia&#x27;s Once Caldas in the final, where after drawing 1–1 on aggregate, Boca lost 2–0 on penalties. Tevez scored two goals in nine league appearances in the Torneo Apertura of the 2004–05 season. Boca Juniors faced Peru&#x27;s Cienciano in the 2004 Recopa Sudamericana on 7 September. Tevez scored after 33 minutes to give Boca Juniors a 1–0 lead, but Cienciano equalised and the match was decided by a penalty shoot-out. Boca lost 4–2 on penalties, where Tevez had failed to convert his side&#x27;s second spot-kick.

During his time at Boca Juniors, Tevez was listed by the media as a potential heir to Diego Maradona, whose number 10 shirt he had inherited at the club .

===Corinthians===

In January 2005, Tevez was transferred to Brazilian Série A club Corinthians for $16 million cash and youth players worth $2 million. Kia Joorabchian and Tevez also received an additional 15% and 10% transfer fee respectively. The transfer fee has also been reported as $22 million. Tevez signed a five-year, £6.85 million contract following the Brazilian club&#x27;s deal with Media Sports Investment (MSI). The deal was the biggest transfer ever in South American football. Investigation by Brazilian police later revealed MSI owned 35% of the player rights (through BVI company MSI Group Limited) while another 65% owned by Just Sport Limited, another BVI company. Tevez captained the squad to the 2005 Campeonato Brasileiro title, scoring 20 goals, including a hat-trick in a 7-1 victory over Santos on 6 November. He was named the league&#x27;s best player by the Brazilian Football Confederation, becoming the first non-Brazilian player to win the award since 1976.

After scoring in a match against Fortaleza in July 2006, Tevez celebrated by putting his index finder to his mouth to make a gesture asking for silence, a gesture which angered the Corinthians supporters; reports said that the fans later damaged his car. In response to the incident, Tevez apologized for the gesture, but threatened to leave the club if the violence continued, also adding that he would not take his daughter and wife to the stadium anymore. With the arrival of new manager Émerson Leão in August 2006, who stripped Tevez of the captaincy, Tevez requested to exit the club, saying that he would &quot;not play as long as Leão is in charge&quot;.

===West Ham United===

Tevez confirmed on his website on 31 August that both he and Corinthians teammate Javier Mascherano were signing for West Ham United on permanent deals for undisclosed fees.

Tevez made his West Ham debut after coming on as a second-half substitute in the 1–1 home draw with Aston Villa on 10 September 2006. However, after this match, West Ham went on a nine-game winless streak (one draw and eight defeats), which included seven consecutive matches without scoring. This winless run also included going out of both the UEFA Cup and League Cup. In November of the same season, Tevez left the ground early after being substituted and throwing a tantrum during a league match against Sheffield United, and as punishment, his teammates decided Tevez had to donate half of a week&#x27;s wages to charity and train in a Brazil jersey. Tevez refused to wear the shirt, saying, &quot;I played in Brazil and have a great respect for Brazil and Brazilians but I&#x27;m Argentine and won&#x27;t wear that shirt.&quot;

On 6 January 2007, Tevez made his first start for West Ham under the new management of Alan Curbishley in a 3–0 FA Cup third round victory over Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. He scored his first West Ham goal and assisted two others on 4 March 2007 in a 4–3 home defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. In April 2007, West Ham were fined a record £5.5 million for breaching Premier League rules over the signings of Tevez and Mascherano. Nonetheless, Tevez was cleared to play for West Ham by the Premier League after changes were planned to be made to a third-party agreement related to him. That same month, Tevez was named the club&#x27;s Hammer of the Year.

In relegation-threatened West Ham&#x27;s final league match of the season against Manchester United on 13 May, Tevez scored the only goal in a 1–0 victory. The match result secured West Ham&#x27;s stay in the top flight after Sheffield United&#x27;s failure to beat Wigan Athletic at home on the same day.

====2007 transfer saga====
In June 2007, Tevez rejected a move to Inter Milan, and his representative, Kia Joorabchian, stated that he was in discussions to stay with West Ham, as the player had settled into the Premier League and wanted to remain in England. Tevez replied that he would not make a decision until the Copa América concluded in July.

On 5 July, it was reported that Tevez had agreed to join Manchester United. West Ham said they would block any transfer unless they received a majority of the transfer fee. The next day, West Ham released a statement saying Tevez was under contract until June 2010, in addition to denying having held negotiations with any other club. Joorabchian contradicted the claim by stating West Ham had given permission to United to engage in talks.

Manchester United and West Ham sought FIFA&#x27;s assistance to rule on Tevez&#x27;s ownership, but on 24 July, FIFA suggested the case be referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Joorabchian intervened by issuing West Ham with a High Court writ &quot;...to compel West Ham to release the registration of Carlos Tevez in accordance with contracts entered into between the parties&quot;. However, the case never made it to court as the Premier League approved an agreement between West Ham and MSI in which MSI would pay £2 million to West Ham, who in turn released Tevez from his contract.

====Sheffield United controversy====
Sheffield United were relegated after their loss to Wigan Athletic on the final day of the 2006–07 season, while West Ham United narrowly avoided relegation by beating the newly crowned champions Manchester United 1–0 on the same day, finishing three points ahead of Sheffield and having a superior goal difference to them by one. The Premier League fined West Ham a record £5.5 million in the signing of Tevez and compatriot Javier Mascherano. They were found to have been partially owned by businessman Kia Joorabchian&#x27;s Media Sports Investment (MSI) company.

As a result, Sheffield United first appealed to the league for reinstatement to the Premier League. After this claim failed, the club sought damages from West Ham arising from the relegation. Initial media reports suggested Sheffield United sought £30 million, which they believed was the true cost of relegation. The controversy continued for nearly two years, interspersed with various differing media reports and speculations. However, on 17 March 2009, both clubs reached an out-of-court settlement to end their dispute, whereby West Ham paid £20 million (£4 million &quot;per&quot; year over the next five seasons) as compensation to Sheffield United.

===Manchester United===

Manchester United put forward a proposed two-year loan deal for Tevez, which was approved on 10 August 2007. He made his debut on 15 August when he started in place of the injured Wayne Rooney in a 1–1 draw against Portsmouth. On 23 September, he scored his first goal in a 2–0 home victory against Chelsea. In November, United manager Sir Alex Ferguson confirmed the club wanted to sign Tevez permanently, saying, &quot;He&#x27;ll get me 15 goals this season, and what&#x27;s more, they&#x27;ll be important goals.&quot; Tevez was greeted with an ovation and singing of &quot;There&#x27;s Only One Carlos Tevez&quot; from the West Ham supporters upon his return to Upton Park for an away match (lost by Manchester United) on 29 December.

Tevez scored a total of five goals during Manchester United&#x27;s successful 2007–08 UEFA Champions League campaign. He also scored the first penalty in the shoot-out against Chelsea in the final, which Manchester United won 6–5 after the match had ended 1–1 after extra time.

Tevez scored his first league goal of the 2008–09 season on 13 September 2008 in a 2–1 away defeat to Liverpool, and his first hat-trick came on 3 December 2008, when he scored a quartet of goals in United&#x27;s 5–3 League Cup win over Blackburn Rovers in the fifth round. His first UEFA Champions League goal of the season, against Aalborg BK on 10 December, was the fastest goal scored in the tournament for 2008–09 at two minutes and 41 seconds.

On 21 December, Tevez started for United in the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup Final, which United won 1–0 over Ecuadorean club LDU Quito, but he was substituted in the 51st minute for Jonny Evans after Nemanja Vidić was sent off.

On 10 May 2009, Tevez was reported as saying that he believed his time at Manchester United would come to an end that summer and he expressed his dissatisfaction at not having been offered a permanent contract with the club and having been dropped from the team despite, in his opinion, not having played badly. Despite this outburst, Tevez was named in Manchester United&#x27;s starting 11 for the derby match against Manchester City later that day, before scoring the second of United&#x27;s two goals on the stroke of half-time, which prompted chants of &quot;Fergie, sign him up&quot; from some of the club&#x27;s fans. After the match, Ferguson refused to be drawn on the subject of Tevez&#x27;s future with the club, saying, &quot;I didn&#x27;t read any of the papers. He&#x27;s a Manchester United player.&quot;

The following match for Manchester United was away at Wigan. Tevez did not start the match, but came off the bench on 58 minutes and scored the equaliser three minutes later with a flamboyant back-heeled finish. His introduction immediately improved the team&#x27;s play and Michael Carrick scored the winner on 86 minutes. After the game, to the relief of most United fans, Ferguson announced the club had commenced talks to sign Tevez on a permanent deal. Tevez started the next match against Arsenal, but was substituted by Park Ji-sung in the 66th minute. As he left the field, the Manchester United supporters applauded him in what would be his last match at Old Trafford for United. United chief executive David Gill suggested that Tevez&#x27;s future would be resolved by early June 2009. Although United agreed to meet the option fee of £25.5 million and offered Tevez a five-year contract that would have made him one of the club&#x27;s top earners, Tevez&#x27;s advisors informed the club he no longer wished to play for Manchester United. Nevertheless, reports also emerged that Tevez had ruled out signing for Liverpool, given the implications of a Manchester United player moving to join their north-west rivals.

===Manchester City===

After protracted negotiations, Tevez signed a five-year contract with Manchester United&#x27;s cross-town rivals, Manchester City, after a medical on 14 July 2009. On 12 September, it was claimed the transfer fee was £47 million, a British transfer record, but this was later denied by both Manchester City and MSI. Tevez was given the number 32 shirt, just as he was at Manchester United and West Ham. In signing for Manchester City, Tevez became the first player to move between the two Manchester clubs since Terry Cooke moved from United to City in 1999. After signing Tevez, Manchester City erected a blue &quot;Welcome to Manchester&quot; billboard with Tevez in the background. The billboard was located at the top of Deansgate in the Manchester city centre, which leads to Salford and Trafford, where Old Trafford is outside the boundaries of the City of Manchester.

Tevez made his City debut coming off the bench against Blackburn Rovers in a 2–0 away win. He scored his first goal for the club on 27 August 2009 against Crystal Palace in the second round of the League Cup, heading-in City&#x27;s second goal in a 2–0 victory.

in September 2009, Tevez suffered a knee injury while on international duty with Argentina, which would keep him out for two to three weeks, forcing him to miss the match against Arsenal. It was also thought Tevez would miss the Manchester derby the following weekend, but he recovered in time to play in the match. He set up his side&#x27;s first goal for Gareth Barry, but City ended up losing 4–3.
Tevez scored his first and second Premier League goals for the club during a 3–1 win over his former club, West Ham, prompting City fans to imitate the chant, &quot;Fergie, sign him up.&quot; Later that week, he scored the third goal in Manchester City&#x27;s 5–1 win over Scunthorpe United in the League Cup, and three weeks later, he scored his third successive cup goal in the quarter-finals against Arsenal. The following week, he scored the winner in a 2–1 win over Chelsea. One week later he scored twice in a 3–3 draw with Bolton Wanderers. His next two goals came against Sunderland and Stoke City, scoring six goals in as many matches. On 28 December, he continued his goalscoring run, scoring two against Wolverhampton Wanderers, making it eight goals in seven matches. Tevez scored his first Premier League hat-trick for Manchester City on 11 January 2010 in a 4–1 home win over Blackburn, coincidentally on the same night he received his first ever Premier League Player of the Month award for December 2009.

On 19 January 2010, Tevez spearheaded City&#x27;s attack as the club defeated Manchester United in the first leg of the League Cup semi-final at the City of Manchester Stadium. Despite United taking a 1–0 lead, Tevez hit the equaliser in from the penalty spot before heading the winner in the 65th minute. On 27 January, Tevez scored his and Manchester City&#x27;s third goal of the tie in the second leg at Old Trafford. However, a stoppage-time goal from Wayne Rooney sent Manchester United through to the final with a 4–3 aggregate win.

On 27 February 2010, Tevez scored two goals against Chelsea in a 4–2 away win over the league leaders, following his return from compassionate leave in Argentina. On 29 March 2010, Tevez scored his second Premier League hat-trick for Manchester City against Wigan in a 3–0 victory. At the end of his first year at Manchester City, he was given two club awards, the Etihad Player of the Year award and the Players&#x27; Player of the Year award.

On 18 August 2010, Tevez was made club captain by manager Roberto Mancini, replacing defender Kolo Touré. Tevez continued his scoring form in the Premier League from 2009–10 in the 2010–11 season with two goals in the 3–0 victory over Liverpool. Against Wigan, Tevez scored again in a 2–0 win. He continued his goalscoring run in a 1–0 win against Chelsea, taking his tally to six goals in five matches. He scored a penalty in a 2–1 home win against Newcastle United, then followed up with two more goals against Blackpool in a 3–2 away win.

In December 2010, despite his agent recently asking the club to renegotiate and improve his contract, Tevez handed the club a written transfer request, citing family reasons and a breakdown in &quot;relationship with certain executives and individuals at the club&quot;. The transfer request was rejected by the club, with a senior club official describing Tevez&#x27;s reasons for wanting to leave as &quot;ludicrous and nonsensical&quot;, while the club also stated the player would not be sold in the January transfer window and would seek compensation for breach of contract from his agent if he retired or refused to play.

On 20 December 2010, Tevez withdrew his transfer request and expressed his &quot;absolute commitment&quot; to Manchester City following &quot;clear-the-air&quot; talks. On 26 December 2010, Tevez scored twice as City won 3–1 away at Newcastle. Further goals against Leicester City, Wolverhampton Wanderers, West Bromwich Albion, Birmingham City and Notts County took him to 50 goals for the club. The mere 73 matches played to reach this figure made him the second-fastest player in City&#x27;s history to reach that figure, behind Derek Kevan&#x27;s 64-game record.
After missing the 1–0 FA Cup semi-final victory over Manchester United at Wembley Stadium due to a hamstring injury, Tevez returned to captain City on 14 May 2011 in the 1–0 final over Stoke City. Two days later, amid rumours of his departure to Italy in the summer, he announced his desire to stay at Eastlands. However, on 8 June, he told an Argentine chat show host that he &quot;would not even return there on vacation&quot;.

Due to his commitments to the national team in the summer, Tevez was not on the bench for City in the first Premier League match of the 2011–12 season against Swansea City. Tevez made his first appearance of the season in City&#x27;s second match of the season against Bolton Wanderers, coming on in the 68th minute for fellow Argentine Sergio Agüero. Despite losing the captain&#x27;s armband to Vincent Kompany, Tevez stated in an interview he had a complete turn around on his stance on Manchester and that he is not moving: &quot;I&#x27;m happy at City and I&#x27;m not moving from there.&quot; Tevez started his first match of the season against Wigan Athletic, in which Tevez missed a penalty that was won by David Silva; nonetheless, he played well in the match which ended 3–0 to City, with Agüero scoring a hat-trick. On 14 September, Tevez made an appearance in City&#x27;s first ever UEFA Champions League match, against Napoli, coming on as a second-half substitute for Edin Džeko in a 1–1 draw.

====Bayern Munich dispute====
On 27 September 2011, Tevez was named as a substitute for City&#x27;s game at Bayern Munich. Mancini claimed Tevez refused to come on as a substitute in the second half, when City was 2–0 down to Bayern, although Tevez denied this calling it a misunderstanding. Tevez&#x27;s actions received widespread condemnation from various pundits and commentators, with Mancini claiming he wanted Tevez &quot;out of Manchester City&quot;, and that he would never play for the club again. Tevez was suspended by Manchester City for a maximum period of two weeks as the club began an investigation into whether he refused to come on as a substitute. Following discussions with Mancini, club owner Sheikh Mansour authorised the placing of Tevez on garden leave where the Argentinian would be paid in full but instructed to stay away from the Manchester City training ground.

====Return to first team====
Having failed to secure a transfer, Tevez was fined several weeks&#x27; wages and denied a loyalty bonus, but returned to Manchester and resumed training on 14 February 2012, with the backing of his fellow players. Mancini had previously stated he was ready to welcome Tevez to the fold to boost their bid for the Premier League title. On 21 February, Tevez publicly apologised &quot;sincerely and unreservedly&quot; for his conduct, and withdrew his appeal over the city&#x27;s decision to severely fine him. However, he was omitted from the club&#x27;s 2011–12 UEFA Europa League squad. On 23 February, Mancini drew a line under his dispute with Tevez and insisted Tevez was available for selection.

Tevez made his return to the Manchester City first-team in a 2–1 home victory against Chelsea on 21 March, coming on for Nigel de Jong in the 66th minute before providing the assist for Samir Nasri&#x27;s winning goal. His first goal of the season came four matches later, the third goal in a 4–0 home win against West Brom on 11 April. On 14 April, Tevez scored a hat-trick and provided an assist for Sergio Agüero in a 6–1 away win against Norwich City. He celebrated his third strike with a golf swing, in response to the pundits who questioned his desire during his leave of absence in which he was pictured on the golf course. He also played in City&#x27;s title-winning match against Queens Park Rangers on 13 May.

On 12 August 2012, Tevez scored Manchester City&#x27;s second goal in a 3–2 win over Chelsea in the 2012 Community Shield. The following weekend, he scored City&#x27;s first goal of the 2012–13 Premier League season, against Southampton. On 26 August, Tevez scored his third goal in three matches in a 2–2 draw with Liverpool, his 100th goal in English football. The following week, he scored the final goal in a 3–1 win over QPR to become the first Manchester City player to score 50 goals for the club in the Premier League. On 3 November, when City met West Ham at Upton Park, Tevez received a warm welcome from West Ham fans; he responded by giving them a cross-armed &quot;Hammers&quot; salute. Speaking after the match, Tevez said, &quot;I have always had a fantastic relationship with the West Ham supporters. They were singing my name before the game and that&#x27;s why I did that (Hammers salute), in tribute to them. I&#x27;ve always felt really at home there.&quot;

On 19 January 2013, it was reported Tevez had revealed he nearly retired from professional football in 2012 in the midst of his Manchester City and Argentina crisis. He also spoke about his future and when he would return to Argentina: &quot;I&#x27;ve already said I want to retire wearing a Boca shirt, it&#x27;s my dream as well as my family&#x27;s. After the World Cup, we&#x27;ll see. I could finish my contract next year and go to Boca.&quot;

===Juventus===
====2013–14 season====

On 26 June 2013, Tevez signed a three-year contract with Juventus for a reported £12 million, with the fee subject to performance. The fee combined with wages and bonuses due to Tevez in the final year of his contract was estimated to save Manchester City about £27 million. He was assigned the number 10 shirt, which had last been worn by the club&#x27;s all-time top goalscorer and appearance holder Alessandro Del Piero in 2012.

On 18 August 2013, Tevez made his competitive debut for Juventus, scoring the fourth goal in a 4–0 rout of Lazio in the 2013 Supercoppa Italiana. On 24 August, he made his first appearance in Serie A, scoring the only goal as Juventus beat Sampdoria 1–0 in their opening match of the 2013–14 season.

On 15 December 2013, Tevez scored his first hat-trick for Juve in a 4–0 Serie A win against Sassuolo at Juventus Stadium. On 23 February 2014, he scored the only goal in Juve&#x27;s 1–0 victory against Torino in the &quot;Derby della Mole&quot;.

Tevez ended the season as the team&#x27;s top goalscorer with 21 goals in all competitions, and was named as Juve&#x27;s &quot;Player of the Season&quot;. He was the third-highest goalscorer in Serie A with 19 goals, as the &quot;Bianconeri&quot; won a 30th &quot;Scudetto&quot;.

====2014–15 season====
On 16 September 2014, Tevez scored twice in Juventus&#x27; 2–0 win against Malmö FF in the group stage of the 2014–15 Champions League, his first goals in the competition since 2009. He scored another brace in the 2014 Supercoppa Italiana against Napoli in Doha on 22 December, but hit the post with the first attempt as Juventus lost in a penalty shoot-out.

On 24 February 2015, Tevez scored the opening goal in Juventus&#x27;s 2–1 defeat of Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League round of 16 first leg. Three weeks later, he scored twice and assisted another at the Westfalenstadion as Juve beat the German club 3–0 to qualify for the quarter-finals. On 5 May, Tevez scored from a penalty to give Juventus a 2–1 victory against defending champions Real Madrid in the first leg of the UEFA Champions League semi-final, at Juventus Stadium in Turin; this was his 50th goal for Juventus.

Tevez ended the Serie A season with 20 goals, helping Juventus to a fourth consecutive &quot;Scudetto&quot;. On 6 June 2015, he started in the 2015 Champions League final as Juventus was defeated 3–1 by Barcelona at Berlin&#x27;s Olympiastadion. Tevez was involved in Álvaro Morata&#x27;s temporary equaliser, as he scored from a rebound after Barcelona&#x27;s goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen had parried the Argentine&#x27;s initial shot.

===Return to Boca Juniors===
====2015 season====

On 26 June 2015, while representing Argentina at the 2015 Copa América, Tevez returned to his first club Boca Juniors to pursue his dream of winning the Argentine Primera División. On 13 July 2015, Juventus confirmed Tevez had transferred to Boca Juniors for a fee of €6.5 million, but in a pure players swap deal. On 15 July 2015, Tevez was named to the ten-man shortlist for the 2015 UEFA Best Player in Europe Award, where it was announced on 12 August he placed ninth. Tevez made his first appearance since his return to the club on 18 July in a 2–1 win over Quilmes, and scored his first goal from a free-kick on 29 July in a 3–0 win over Banfield in the last 32 of the Copa Argentina. Four days later, he scored the first league goal of his return in an eventual 3–4 home loss to Unión. Tevez had a large impact, scoring 9 goals in 15 matches as he finished the 2015 season by achieving his goal of winning the Argentine Primera División and Copa Argentina double with Boca Juniors, becoming the first footballer to win two domestic league and cup doubles in one calendar year. On 14 December 2015, Tevez was named the 2014–15 Serie A Footballer of the Year.

====2016 season====
Tevez was criticised in the media for his negative performance following Boca&#x27;s 4–0 defeat to San Lorenzo in the 2015 Supercopa Argentina on 10 February 2016. On 20 April 2016, Tevez scored two goals in a 6–2 win over Deportivo Cali, which allowed Boca to top their Copa Libertadores group and advance to the round of 16 unbeaten. On 5 May, he scored from a penalty and later set up a goal for teammate Cristian Pavón as Boca defeated Cerro Porteño 3–1 at home in the second leg of the round of 16 of the Copa Libertadores to advance to the quarter-finals, following a 5–2 win on aggregate. On 19 May, he scored Boca&#x27;s first penalty in their 4–3 home shootout victory over Nacional, in the second leg of the Copa Libertadores quarter-finals, following a 2–2 draw on aggregate, to help his team to advance to the semi-finals of the tournament for the first time since 2012. However, Boca were eliminated 5–3 on aggregate by Independiente in the semi-finals of the competition, on 14 July. On 11 December, Tevez scored a match-winning brace in a 4–2 away win in the &quot;Superclásico&quot; against rivals River Plate.

===Shanghai Shenhua===
On 29 December 2016, Tevez signed for Chinese Super League club Shanghai Shenhua, on a reported annual salary of $41 million, which would make him the world&#x27;s highest-paid football player. Tevez subsequently played down the reports he became the highest-paid player in the world following his move, saying, &quot;My salary isn&#x27;t as high as the legends.&quot;

He made his league debut on 5 March in the first round of the 2017 Chinese Super League against Jiangsu Suning, also scoring his first goal in the match, from the penalty spot in the first half in his team&#x27;s 4–0 win. He also assisted his club&#x27;s first and fourth goals, both scored by Giovanni Moreno.

He was criticised by manager, Wu Jingui during his time in Shanghai for being overweight and unfit to play. Tevez described his time in China as a &quot;holiday&quot;.

===Third spell at Boca Juniors===
On 5 January 2018, Boca Juniors announced on their social media that Tevez had rejoined the club.

He won the 2017–18 and 2019–20 Primera División titles with the team.

On 4 June 2021, Tevez announced that he would be leaving Boca Juniors. In a press conference, Tevez said that he was &quot;physically fit to continue but not mentally&quot; and that he can continue to play &quot;at the age of 42, but not in Boca Juniors&quot;. He also thanked the club and left the option open for an offer to continue playing elsewhere.
In June 2022, Tevez announced his retirement from professional football. He attributed his decision to retire to the loss of his father, Segundo, whom he called his &quot;number one fan&quot;, to COVID-19 in February 2021.

==International career==

===Early international career===

Tevez first came into prominence with Argentina while playing in the 2001 FIFA U-17 World Championship. At the 2004 Olympic Games in Greece, he won the gold medal – Argentina&#x27;s first in any event since 1952 – and scored eight goals in six matches to be the top scorer of the competition. This included the winner in the final against Paraguay, two in a 6–0 group-stage rout of Serbia and Montenegro, and a hat-trick in a 4–0 quarter-final win over Costa Rica. Tevez represented Argentina&#x27;s senior team in the 2004 Copa América, where the team reached the final, only to lose out to rivals Brazil on penalties; he scored a goal in both of the preceding rounds. He was the world&#x27;s second-highest goalscorer of 2004 in overall international competition with 16 goals, one fewer than Iran forward Ali Daei.

He was also a member of Argentina&#x27;s 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup squad that lost again to Brazil in the final. Tevez was called up for the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals, and scored his only goal of the tournament in Argentina&#x27;s 6–0 group stage thrashing of Serbia and Montenegro on 16 June, as a substitute for Javier Saviola. He was also a member of the Argentina squad which reached the 2007 Copa América Final. Five minutes after coming on for Lionel Messi, he scored to conclude a 4–1 group stage comeback defeat of the United States in Maracaibo.

===2010 FIFA World Cup===
During 2010 World Cup qualifying, Tevez was sent off twice in a three-game stretch, once against Colombia on 21 November 2007 after he kicked Rubén Darío Bustos in the 24th minute, and then on 9 September 2008 after a late tackle on Darío Verón which earned him a red card in the 31st minute of a 1–1 draw with Paraguay after he had been booked earlier. Tevez later apologised for the incident.

Tevez was again selected in the Argentina squad for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. He scored twice in the tournament, both goals coming in the round of 16 match against Mexico. His first goal was a header scored in controversial style as he was in an offside position as Lionel Messi passed to him. However, the offside was missed by the referee&#x27;s assistant and the goal was allowed to stand. Tevez scored his second goal of the game with a powerful shot from outside the box.

===Later international career===
At the 2011 Copa América, Tevez was the only player from either side to miss in the quarter-final penalty shoot-out against Uruguay, resulting in Argentina&#x27;s elimination. After Alejandro Sabella&#x27;s appointment as manager in July 2011, Tevez was not selected in an Argentina squad for three years, missing out as the team finished as runner-up at the 2014 World Cup.

On 27 October 2014, new manager Gerardo Martino recalled Tevez for friendly matches against Portugal and Croatia. He made his return to international football on 12 November 2014 at the Boleyn Ground, London, in a 2–1 win against Croatia.

In May 2015, Tevez was selected in Argentina&#x27;s squad for the 2015 Copa América in Chile. On 26 June, he scored the winning kick in the 5–4 penalty shoot-out defeat of Colombia in the quarter-final, which allowed Argentina to advance to the semi-final. Argentina reached the final, only to be defeated by hosts Chile on penalties, as Tevez won his third runners-up medal in the tournament.

In May 2016, Tevez was omitted from Argentina&#x27;s 23-man squad for the Copa América Centenario.

==Player profile==
===Style of play===
Tevez was a quick, tenacious, powerful, hard-working, dynamic and versatile forward, with a sturdy physique. A technical, tactically intelligent, and creative player, with an eye for goal, Tevez was capable of playing as a striker, as a winger, or even as a supporting forward, or as an attacking midfielder, due his finishing and positioning, as well as his vision, creativity, movement and passing ability, which enabled him to exploit space and provide assists for teammates as well as score goals himself. He was also occasionally deployed as a false 9 throughout his career. Due to his pace, strength, work-rate and stamina, Tevez was also extremely useful when possession is lost, and he excelled at pressing opponents, aiding his team to win back the ball and start attacking plays, making him effective both defensively and offensively. Tevez was also a skillful dribbler, and he possessed an accurate and powerful shot from distance; he was also an accurate penalty kick and free-kick taker.

===Goal celebrations===
Tevez was known for his dancing goal celebrations ever since playing for Boca Juniors, as well with Corinthians of Brazil. During his time at Manchester United, he would hide a baby&#x27;s dummy in his shorts and put it in his mouth after scoring a goal as a commemorative gesture to his baby daughter. After his move to Manchester City, Tevez often performed a dance where he puts his hands together, bends down and rocks his body; this dance has been named after him as the &quot;Tevez Dance&quot;.

==Managerial career==
===Rosario Central===
On 21 June 2022, shortly after announcing his retirement as a player, Tevez was appointed as head coach of Argentine Primera División side Rosario Central. After just five months in charge, he resigned at the end of the 2022 Argentine Primera División season, citing the club&#x27;s upcoming directorial elections.

===Independiente===
In August 2023, Tevez became the manager of Independiente. On 9 December 2023, he extended his contract with Independiente until 31 December 2026.

On 17 May 2024, Tevez announced that he would leave Independiente after the subsequent match against Platense.

==Personal life==
Tevez once performed as the front-man for his &quot;cumbia villera&quot; musical group Piola Vago alongside his brother Diego. The group&#x27;s most successful hit, &quot;Lose Your Control&quot;, charted in Argentina.

On 6 February 2009, Tevez was stopped by Greater Manchester Police near junction 7 of the M60 motorway. It was found Tevez was driving without a full UK driving licence and with illegally tinted windows. His car was then impounded by the police since he could not arrange for it to be removed himself.

In 2010, he was in an open relationship with 19-year-old actress Brenda Asnicar that lasted about a year.

Tevez, a keen golfer, caddied for his friend Andrés Romero at the 2012 Open Championship.

On 22 December 2016, Tevez married 32-year-old Vanesa Mansilla in his homeland Argentina. They have two daughters together: Florencia and Katia.

In a 2023 interview, Tevez said that during his time in England he had refused to learn English as he had a &quot;cultural problem with the English&quot;. This had a happened as he blamed the English for the Falklands War in which his uncle had taken part and after which he had become an alcoholic.

<text>The Grundy NewBrain was a line of microcomputers launched in 1982 by Grundy Business Systems Ltd of Teddington and Cambridge, England. A contemporary of the ZX80 and BBC Micro, the NewBrain was mostly used in business settings. It is notable for its chicklet keyboard and models that featured a one-line display, allowing them to be used as a portable computer, in addition to television output. Another unique feature of the system was NewBrain BASIC, a BASIC programming language that featured an on-the-fly compiler. 

Originally designed at Sinclair Radionics, government ownership of that company led to Clive Sinclair leaving the company and starting a new low-cost design, the ZX80. It was considered for the BBC Micro project, but development was not complete and that was won by Acorn Computers instead. The design was then sold off by the government to recently-formed Grundy. Grundy produced the system between 1982 and 1983, with approximately 50,000 units sold during this period. The design was then sold to Dutch firm Tradecom to fill a contract for computers in training centres. These units came from existing stocks, and plans to open a factory in India never materialized.

==History==
=== Beginnings ===
Through the mid-1970s, Clive Sinclair&#x27;s firm Sinclair Radionics entered a period of financial difficulties. This led to investment from the National Enterprise Board (NEB) in 1976 to ensure the company did not foreclose. The NEB had formed the previous year to nationalize technology companies considered critical to the UK.

Seeing his management of the company would suffer, Sinclair dusted off a company he had purchased and left unused, a shelf company, and formed Sinclair Instrument. He asked Radionics employee Christopher Curry to start it up, and in July 1977, Sinclair Instrument was renamed Science of Cambridge Ltd. Around the same time, Curry was introduced to a new small computer designed by Ian Williamson that combined a National Semiconductor SC/MP central processing unit (CPU) with parts from one of Sinclair&#x27;s calculator designs. Curry put this on the market as the MK14 in June 1978, for the very low price of £40.

Curry wanted to start the development of a larger machine similar to the Apple II, but the company simply didn&#x27;t have the funds to develop it. In 1978, the NEB agreed to fund the development of such a machine at Radionics. This prompted Curry to leave Science of Cambridge, and partner with Hermann Hauser to form Acorn Computers. At Radionics, development began with Mike Wakefield as the designer and Basil Smith as the software engineer.

In early 1979, the NEB sold off Radionics&#x27; calculator product lines. In July, Sinclair had enough of the NEB and quit, moving to Science of Cambridge. In return, the NEB renamed Radionics to Sinclair Electronics in September and the company was dedicated to bringing the new machine to market. Meanwhile, at Science of Cambridge, Sinclair began the development of a much simpler machine with the goal of hitting a sub-£100 price point. This would emerge in early 1980 as the ZX80. The company was renamed Sinclair Research in 1981 and the ZX81 launched.

In January 1980 the former Radionics once again renamed to become Thandar Electronics, but the 1979 Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher began selling off government-owned properties and did so in this case by selling Thandar to Thurlby Electronics, who had no interest in the computer project. The NEB then transferred the project to another NEB-owned company, Newbury Laboratories.

Newbury gave it the name NewBrain and announced the imminent release of three models, including a battery-powered portable computer. By this time the machine was no longer as innovative as it had been when first designed; in 1980 &quot;Personal Computer World&quot; said it was &quot;significantly in advance of anything that had been seen in the field of handheld computing&quot;, but by the end of that year with the systems still not released, and it was not long before &quot;Your Computer&quot; noted &quot;the endless delays in its development mean that it has now lagged behind a new generation of personal computers.&quot;

=== BBC micro project ===
In early 1980, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) Further Education department conceived the idea of a computer literacy programme, principally in response to the impact of a 1979 six-part ITV documentary series, &quot;The Mighty Micro&quot;, in which Dr Christopher Evans from the UK National Physical Laboratory predicted the coming (micro) computer revolution. It was a very influential documentary — so much so that questions were asked in Parliament.

As a result of the questions in Parliament, the Department of Industry (DoI) became interested in the programme. BBC Engineering was instructed to attempt to draw up an objective specification for a machine that the program could be tailored to, and under pressure from the DoI, they wanted to choose a UK-built system. The market provided few alternatives, so the BBC specification was closely written around the NewBrain specification with the expectation they would bid on the project.

The BBC released the specification in 1981, but at this time Newbury was nowhere near ready to go into production as they were having problems with the uncommitted logic arrays (ULAs) that provided much of the customization. The BBC&#x27;s programmes, initially scheduled for Autumn 1981, were moved back to Spring 1982. By this time, Sinclair and Curry had also heard of the project, and demanded they be allowed to bid on it. Sinclair were well down the road with the ZX80, which was a much simpler machine that could not come close to meeting the original specification. Curry visited the BBC and convinced them they were ready to go with a machine that could mostly meet the specification. Acorn won the contract.

As a result of the BBC&#x27;s decision, Newbury no longer had a launch customer for the NewBrain. The British Technology Group, which had replaced the NEB by this time, sold the final design and production rights to Grundy. Grundy had been looking for an entrant into the personal computer business, as they were already producing a CP/M 2.2-based machine, built into a &#x27;dumb terminal&#x27; as a virtual clone of the Intertec Superbrain.

=== Commercial use ===
Over 50,000 NewBrain units were sold to educational, scientific, industry, small business and banking sectors; as well as to home users. Scientific use was strong because of the unusually high precision of the NewBrain&#x27;s floating point computations and its very high-resolution graphics. Business use was also proportionally high due to the availability of CP/M based software. The main industrial use was within the pharmaceutical industry. The computer was widely used by the Angolan Government; the central planning of the Angolan Ministry of Commerce in 1981 - 1984 were made using this machine instead of much more expensive computers.

=== Demise ===
Tradecom purchased Grundy Business Systems in 1983 in order to fulfil a contract to supply microcomputers to schools and training centres in the Netherlands. They created a server to which several NewBrains could use its floppy discs to load programs down the serial cable and simple switching enabled the teacher to view the screen of the students. They also demonstrated a keyboard with predictive text laid out in a non-QWERTY fashion. They were given television coverage, but the NewBrain&#x27;s part in this was not mentioned. Tradecom&#x27;s NewBrains were supplied entirely by existing stock. A press release was made of a new factory in India to provide NewBrains for the Indian market and to supply Europe, but nothing materialised.

=== Today ===
The Dutch NewBrain user group has PDF downloads of various publications and a link to a Greek website that contains a PC-based emulator. The Dutch website has many of the programs that were available for the NewBrain, and these can be run on the emulator.

== Models ==

Two main models were released. The model &#x27;A&#x27; needed to display on either a TV or a monitor. The model &#x27;AD&#x27; also included a one-line, 16-character, vacuum fluorescent (VF) display on the unit which permitted operation with or without a TV screen or monitor — the VF display responded to the cursor keys and scrolled around the screen display area. One additional model was released, but this was a custom version for a pharmaceutical chain, with no screen display — only the VF display — and was not widely known.

An expansion chassis was released, providing an additional 64 kB of paged memory. Since the Z80 has a 16-bit address bus, it can only address 64 kB of memory at a time. The paged memory system in the expansion chassis used bank switching to allow the NewBrain to take advantage of several 64 kB modules. The expansion module included a parallel printer port and two hardware based serial ports and an expansion bus to connect further modules such as the 8 and 16 way serial modules under development. The expansion module included Series 2 software, replacing those in the processor module as well as software for the new devices. 

CP/M 2.2 was also available. Under CP/M 2.2 the internal BASIC ROM was paged out for the CP/M ROM but this gave only 32 kB memory to CP/M. With the expansion module fitted the three 8 kB ROMs of the processor module were paged out to give the NewBrain one of the highest available TPA (Transient Program Area — memory left after the OS demands are satisfied) to CP/M. Grundy Business Systems released two 5.25&quot; drive formats, 40 track 200 kB single sided and 80 track 800 kB double sided. Several independent dealers provided 40 track 400 kB double sided drive. In 1983 the Sony 3.5&quot; became available and single and paired units were supplied to dealers in the NewBrain cream cases. The 3.5&quot; 800 kB discs also got a more effective format allowing the files from 4x200 kB floppies to be stored on one 800 kB disc.

== Software ==

The unexpanded NewBrain contains software provided in ROM, primarily BASIC, a full screen editor and device drivers. Other packages were also included within the ROM (e.g. maths and graphics packages) and were accessible to BASIC and any other software.

All I/O was stream-based, and orthogonal: any device could be replaced by an alternative, although the manual did warn that devices had to be chosen with care. This approach did make it easy to write programs that could swap between input and output coming from a screen, keyboard or tape. 

The maths package had 12 figures of accuracy and a dynamic range of 10−150 to 10150, compared to most common machines having 6 figure accuracy and a dynamic range of 10−38 to 10+38. This was achieved by using base 256 for the floating point format, rather than the more common base 2, and using six bytes for storing numbers, rather than the more common four. Five bytes stored the basic number, with the last byte storing the sign in the first bit, and the remaining seven bits storing the exponent. For example, π was stored as 3.14159265358.

Benchmarks show that even though the NewBrain performed double accuracy calculations, it was one of the fastest 8-bit computers available for several years, completing PCW Benchmark 8 in 7.0 seconds. For comparison against other contemporary machines, the Sinclair Spectrum took 25.3 seconds, the BBC Micro took 5.1 seconds, but with fewer significant digits. The 16-bit IBM PC took 3.5 seconds.

The graphics screen was separate from the text screen and was opened as a new output stream that shared space with the text screen. The graphics commands were based on &#x27;turtle&#x27; keywords and provided a flexible means of drawing. The last two generations of NewBrain ROMs included additional graphics commands — ROM 1.9 had two more commands, and ROM 2.0 some more. But to ensure compatibility little software would use these additional commands. The programmers were working on version 2.2 as well as versions for different keyboards, including Greek and Swedish as well as French and German. Grundy had been considering offering the Series 2 ROMs to existing users. This required the existing soldered in ROMs to be removed from the circuit board and a socket soldered in. The tight fit and labour cost was high on this retrofitting, and the failure of the company in 1983 meant that users were never aware that this was being considered.

The version of BASIC was an extended version of ANSI BASIC, the facilities of which were similar to those in Microsoft BASIC. The graphics package included commands that could draw dots, lines, arcs, filled-in areas and annotated axes.

Grundy offered a &#x27;Software Technical Manual&#x27;. This manual documented various routines that could be called in the ROM and the calling parameters. It was left to the NewBrain user groups to publish the details of how to access these routines through the indirect call. (A low-memory address was called with the relevant routine parameters, and this address would call the ROM-specific location of a jump table which, in turn, then called the final routine.) Even screen access required this indirect use, as the screen location would change as new input and output streams were created, including high-resolution (for the time) graphic streams. Memory maps and other technical information were included in numerous technical notes which were supplied to dealers and owners free of charge. The Technical Manual had a retail price of £50.

HiSoft Systems produced NewBrain versions of their Pascal compiler and editor. A number of CP/M applications were converted to using the NewBrain&#x27;s CP/M terminal and made available on NewBrain 5.25&quot; and 3.5&quot; formatted diskettes. These included Z80 Assemblers and debuggers, Pro Pascal and Pro Fortran, TCL Pascal, dBase II, WordStar 3.3, Peachtree Accounting applications, the Superfile database and CP/M versions of Hisoft Pascal, Modula-2, Z80 Assembler and text editor.

Many third party software houses (e.g. IEL, MicroMart, Black Knight Computers) provided independent software for the NewBrain, which was supplied to users such as the British Ministry of Defence, and Cambridge University.

<text>Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke (, 1853–1927) also known to followers as the Servant of the Messenger () and Serigne Touba or &quot;Sheikh of Touba&quot;, was a Sufi saint and religious leader in Senegal and the founder of the large Mouride Brotherhood (the &quot;Muridiyya&quot;).

Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba produced poems and tracts on meditation, rituals, work, and Quranic study. He led a pacifist struggle against the French colonial empire travelling across the Atlantic Ocean while not waging outright war on the French like several prominent Tijani marabouts had done.

== Early life and background ==
Amadou was born on the outskirts of 1270 A.H. (around 1853 A.D.) in the village of Mbacké (&quot;Mbàkke Bawol&quot; in Wolof) in Baol. He was born into a family with an ancient Islamic tradition, which had nevertheless maintained close relations and alliances with royal dynasties such as the Guééj. His father Maam Mor Anta Saly Mbacke was a Marabout from the Qadiriyya, the oldest tariqa (Sufi order) in Senegal. He had been appointed Qadi of the kingdom both by Maba Diakhou Ba and the Damel Lat Jor. It is said that even at a young age, Ahmadou Bamba pressured his father to give up his important position as Qadi to the Damel. Ahmadou Bamba disavowed this collaboration, which he considered suspicious in that it obliged his father to render power-inspired rulings potentially contrary to Islamic law. Bamba was the second son of Maam Mor Anta Saly Mbacke and Maam Mariyama Bousso (better known by the name Maam Diaara Bousso, or Diaratoullah in Arabic, which means &quot;neighbor of God&quot;). Both of his parents descended from the well-known patriarch Maam Mahram Mbacke, with their ancestors hailing from Fouta, northern Senegal.

==Foundation of Mouridiyya and Touba==
The Mouride brotherhood began to develop at the end of the 19th century, following the defeat of the Wolof monarchies. This period of deep socio-political crisis was conducive to the birth of religious organizations founded by strong personalities renowned for their science and holiness. Ahmadou Bamba founded the Mouride brotherhood in 1883, with its capital in Touba, Senegal. Today, Touba serves as the location of the sub-Saharan Africa&#x27;s largest mosque, which was built by the Mourides.

Ahmadou Bamba&#x27;s teachings emphasized the virtues of pacifism, hard work and good manners through what is commonly known as &quot;Jihādu nafs&quot; which emphasizes a personal struggle over &quot;negative instincts.&quot; As an ascetic marabout who wrote tracts on meditation, rituals, work, and Quranic study, he is perhaps best known for his emphasis on work and industriousness.

Bamba&#x27;s followers call him a mujaddid (&quot;renewer of Islam&quot;), citing a hadith that implies that God will send renewers of the faith every 100 years (the members of all the Senegalese brotherhoods claim that their founders were such renewers).

Abdoul Ahad Mbacke, the third Caliph (Mouride leader) and son of Ahmadou Bamba, declared that Ahmadou Bamba had met the prophet Muhammad in his dreams, a tale that has become an article of faith for Mouride believers. During the month of Ramadan 1895, Muhammed and his companions appeared to him in a dream in Touba to confer upon him the rank of &quot;mujaddid&quot; of his age, and to test his faith. From this, Bamba is said to also have been conferred the rank of &quot;Servant of the Prophet.&quot;

He founded the city of Touba in 1887. In one of his numerous writings, &quot;Matlabul Fawzeyni&quot; (the quest for happiness in both worlds), Bamba describes the purpose of the city, which was intended to reconcile the spiritual and the temporal.

== Facing colonial rule and exile==

As Bamba&#x27;s fame and influence spread, the French colonial government worried about his growing power and potential to wage war against them. He had stirred &quot;anti-colonial disobedience&quot; and even converted a number of traditional kings and their followers and no doubt could have raised a huge military force, as Muslim leaders like Umar Tall and Samory Touré had before him. During this time, the French army and French colonial government were weary of Muslim leaders inciting revolts as they finished taking over Senegal.

The phobia of the colonial administration at the place of any Islamic movement made the judgements given to the Privy Council often constitute lawsuits of intention to religious leaders. Stopped in Diéwol, Cheikh Ahmadou Bamba was transferred to the office of the Governor of the colonial administration in Saint-Louis (Senegal). On Thursday September 5, 1895, he appeared before the Privy Council (Conseil d&#x27;Etat) of Saint-Louis to rule on his case. Ahmadou Bamba prayed two rakat in the Governor&#x27;s office before addressing the council, declaring his firm intention to be subjected to God alone. With this symbolic prayer and stance in the sanctuary of the deniers of Islam, Bamba came to embody a new form of nonviolent resistance against the aims of colonial evangelists. Proof of Bamba having recited these prayers is not included in colonial archives, but is rather based on the testimonies of his disciples. As a result of Bamba&#x27;s prayers, the Privy Council decided to deport him to &quot;a place where its fanatic preachings would not have any effect&quot;. and exiled him to the equatorial forest of Gabon, where he remained for seven years and nine months. While in Gabon, he composed prayers and poems celebrating Allah.

From the beginning of the 19th century, the imperialist policy of France ended with the defeat of all the armed resistance movements in Senegal and the installation of a policy of Christianization and assimilation of the new colony to the cultural values of the metropolis. This led to a policy of exile or systematic elimination of the Muslim spiritual guides who openly spoke out against the colonial government. Thus, Ahmadou Bamba, whose only alleged crime was persisting in preaching Islam, was subjected to all manner of deprivation and trials for 32 years. Exiled for seven years to Gabon and five years to Mauritania and placed under house arrest in Diourbel, Senegal for fifteen years, Bamba nevertheless did not cease to defend the message of Islam until his death in 1927.

In the political sphere, Ahmadou Bamba led a pacifist struggle against French colonialism while trying to restore a purer practice of Islam insulated from French colonial influence. In a period when successful armed resistance was impossible, Cheikh Ahmadou Bamba led a spiritual struggle against colonial culture and politics. Although he did not wage outright war on them as several prominent Tijaan marabouts had done, he taught what he called the &quot;jihād al-&#x27;akbar&quot; or &quot;greater struggle,&quot; which fought not through weapons but through learning and fear of God.

As Bamba gathered followers, he taught that salvation comes through complete submission to God and hard work. The Mouride order has built, following this teaching, a large economic organisation, involved in many aspects of the Senegalese economy. Groundnut cultivation, the primary cash crop of the colonial period, was an early example of this. Young followers were recruited to settle marginal lands in eastern Senegal, found communities and create groundnut plantations. With the organisation and supplies provided by the Brotherhood, a portion of the proceeds were returned to Touba, while the workers, after a period of years, earned ownership over the plantations and towns.

Fearing his influence, the French sentenced him to exile in Gabon (1895–1902) and later in Mauritania (1903–1907). However, these exiles inspired stories and folk tales of Bamba&#x27;s miraculous survival of torture, deprivation, and attempted executions, and thousands more flocked to his organization.

By 1910, the French realized that Bamba was not interested in waging violent war against them, and was in fact quite cooperative, eventually releasing him to return to his expanded community. In 1918, they rewarded him with the French Legion of Honor for enlisting his followers in the First World War: he refused it. They allowed him to establish his community in Touba, believing in part that his doctrine of hard work could be made to work with French economic interests.

His movement continued to grow, and in 1926 he began work for the great mosque at Touba.

==Death==
After his death in 1927, he was buried in Touba at a site he had chosen, adjacent to the future location of The Grand Mosque. He was succeeded by his descendants as hereditary leaders of the brotherhood with absolute authority over the followers. Currently, Serigne Mountakha Mbacké is the Khalifa-General, Ahmadou Bamba&#x27;s oldest living grandson who holds the brotherhood&#x27;s highest office.

==Legacy==
Today, Ahmadou Bamba has an estimated following of more than 3 million people and parades occur around the world in his honor, including in various cities in the United States. One such city is New York, where Muslims of West African descent have organized an &quot;annual Cheikh Ahmadou Bamba Day parade&quot; for over twenty years. Celebrations like these create platforms to &quot;redefine the boundaries of their African identities, cope with the stigma of blackness, and counteract an anti-Muslim backlash&quot;.

Every year, millions of Muslims from all over the world make a pilgrimage to Touba (known as the Magal), worshipping at the mosque and honoring the memory of Ahmadou Bamba.
Ahmadou Bamba has several surviving photographs, in which he wears a flowing white robe and his face is mostly covered by a scarf. These pictures are venerated and reproduced in paintings on walls, buses, taxis, etc. all over Senegal. The first surviving photo was originally taken in 1913 by &quot;French colonial authorities&quot;.

Modern Mourides contribute earnings to the brotherhood, which provides social services, loans, and business opportunities in return.

Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba is also known to have invented Café Touba. Bamba traditionally mixed coffee and spices together for medicinal purposes, and served it to his followers.

Senegalese musician Youssou N&#x27;Dour has claimed to be a follower of Mouridism. His 2004 Grammy-winning album &quot;Egypt&quot; features multiple songs that praise Bamba.

<doc id="1024200" wikidata="Q3811256" url="?curid=1024200" title="June of 44">
<text>June of 44 is an American rock band which was formed in 1994 from ex-members of Rodan, Lungfish, Rex, and Hoover. The band&#x27;s name refers to the period during which writers Henry Miller and Anaïs Nin corresponded.

The band toured extensively, reaching as far as Australia. They were a collective from 1994 to 2000, and reunited in 2018. Their style consists of a post-hardcore and math rock base, while their later releases delve into experimental jazz, ambient dub and angular post-punk.

Their debut album &quot;Engine Takes to the Water&quot; (1995) drew comparisons with both Slint and Will Oldham. The following year&#x27;s &quot;Tropics and Meridians&quot; saw the band compared to Tortoise and The For Carnation. Drummer Doug Scharin had started HiM as a side project, which sometimes also featured bassist Fred Erskine, and Scharin also later started the avant-garde band Out in Worship. Meadows also had a side project, forming Sonora Pine with Tara Jane O&#x27;Neill. June of 44 released three further albums, incorporating more electronics and jazz influences, before the band split up in 1999, with vocalist/guitarist Jeff Mueller forming Shipping News and vocalist Sean Meadows forming Everlasting the Way and later Letter E. Erskine joined Abilene, while Scharin continued with HiM, also guesting with several other bands. The band reunited in 2018 and released a new album titled &quot;Revisionist: Adaptations &amp; Future Histories in the Time of Love and Survival&quot; in 2020.

<text>Charles Willson Woodside (1905 – May 29, 1991) was a Canadian journalist well-known for his World War II reporting. He was also an author and a professor of political science at the University of Guelph.

==Biography==
Willson Woodside was born in Portage la Prairie, Manitoba and raised in the prairies of Canada. He attained a bachelor&#x27;s degree in engineering at the University of Toronto just prior to the Great Depression; following this he worked briefly as an engineer and then taught at the University of Toronto from 1929 to 1934.

During this time he travelled extensively during the summers in Europe and particularly in Germany, although he was barred from the country by the Nazis after several visits.

During this period Woodside became a journalist and prominently predicted the outbreak of war in Europe. During the Second World War, he was a member of the Allied press corps and reported nightly on the radio for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Following the war, he became Foreign Editor at Saturday Night.

Woodside also served in the post-war period as the executive director of the United Nations Association in Canada. In 1954, he ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada as a Tory in a by-election in the Toronto riding of Trinity, losing to Liberal Donald Carrick by 1352 votes. He wrote a book entitled &quot;The University Question&quot; which discussed the funding and use of higher education in Canada. He then joined the political science department of the University of Guelph, Ontario, as a founding member of the faculty and also chair. He was a professor of the university from 1966 to 1974. His archives are presently held in the university&#x27;s library.

Woodside was the great-nephew of Henry Joseph Woodside, an entrepreneur and soldier known for his photography during the Boer War and the First World War.

<doc id="1024211" wikidata="Q1349413" url="?curid=1024211" title="Bamba (snack)">
<text>Bamba () is a snack made of peanut-butter-flavored puffed maize manufactured by the Osem corporation in Kiryat Gat, Israel.
Bamba is one of the leading snack foods produced and sold in Israel. It was introduced in 1964. Bamba makes up 25% of the Israeli snack market.

Similar products from other domestic manufacturers include &quot;Parpar&quot; (Literally &quot;Butterfly&quot;, Telma, since 2000 a subsidiary of Unilever), &quot;Shush&quot; (Strauss-Elite), and &quot;Smoki&quot; (Štark). Osem named the snack &quot;Bamba&quot; because it sounded like baby talk.

==Overview==
Bamba is made from peanut-butter-flavored puffed maize. Bamba contains no preservatives or food coloring, is enriched with several vitamins, and contains high amounts of Unsaturated fat. The energy content is 160 calories per 28 grams. Bamba is certified kosher by &quot;Badatz&quot; Jerusalem. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; describes it as &quot;Cheez Doodles without the cheese.&quot;

==Manufacturing process==
Corn grits are &quot;popped&quot; under high pressure, turning them into long lines of white, puffed, unflavored Bamba. The lines are cut into nuggets and then moved to a drying chamber where they are air-baked for 20 seconds, which gives them a crispy texture. The peanut butter, imported from Argentina, is added at the end. A worker stands on a step above the rotating drums and pours a pitcher of liquid peanut butter into each of the containers. As the drums turn, the nuggets are coated. The hot Bamba is then moved along a conveyor belt to cool before packaging.

==Variations==

In 1964, Bamba was trialed with a cheese flavor but proved unpopular and was dropped. Osem quickly changed tack and launched Bamba in different flavors, including corn, grill, caraway and peanut butter, which became the mainstay of Bamba. 

Nowadays, Osem also produces strawberry-flavored Bamba (officially called &#x27;Sweet Bamba&#x27; , and unofficially &#x27;Red Bamba&#x27; ) that is round in shape instead of oblong, and red instead of the usual color. It was originally colored with an artificial red dye, which has since been replaced with beetroot.
In 2008 Osem introduced a new Bamba flavor, nougat-filled, produced at the Osem plant in Sderot. It is considered by the Nestlé group, owner of the controlling interest in Osem, to be one of the great successes of Nestlé in Israel.
Osem introduced a halva-filled and a chocolate-filled Bamba in 2010, and a &quot;Bamba-filled Bamba&quot; (a peanut-butter-paste filled Bamba) in 2013. In 2014 Osem introduced a special edition of Bamba and their other popular snack Bissli within the same blue package, named &quot;Bissli-Bamba Mix&quot;, another edition of &quot;Mix&quot; included onion-flavor Bissli, packaged in a green pack. In 2015, 60g bags of Bamba bomba were introduced to the market, as well as Banana Punch flavoured Bamba. Coin sized and shaped, &quot;round Bamba&quot; was introduced by the company In 2016, as well as a mini Bamba version of the snack called &quot;Bambini&quot;. For Purim 2017, Osem introduced a Pretzel shaped Bamba, and towards the summer of that same year, a caramel biscuit flavoured cream filled Bamba. Ice-coffee filled Bamba was introduced in 2018, and in winter 2019 Osem introduced both Cappuccino cream filled Bamba, as well as Bamba with Chocolate. 

In 1963 the Bahlsen company launched a very similar product to the classic Bamba called &#x27;Erdnussflips&#x27; (peanut flips) in Germany where it remains a staple snack. 

Another similar snack appeared in 1972. &#x27;Smoki&#x27; were introduced to the Southeastern European market by the Serbian company Štark (then Soko-Štark). 

In 2017 Trader Joe&#x27;s began offering Bamba under their private label, imported from Osem in Israel.

==Peanut allergy==
As Bamba is made with peanuts, people allergic to peanuts may be severely affected by it. Early peanut consumption is associated with a lower prevalence of peanut allergy. A 2008 study concluded that, due to the extensive consumption of Bamba by infants in Israel, peanut allergy is rare among Israelis. A control group of Jewish children in the UK had ten times higher rates of allergy; the difference is not accounted for by differences in atopy, social class, genetic background, or peanut allergenicity. The later Learning Early About Peanut Study (LEAP) also showed that high-risk children who were given softened sticks of Bamba in early life had a lower rate of peanut allergy later in life. Children who were exposed to peanuts through Bamba showed an 81% reduction in peanut allergy prevalence. Medical researchers speculate that the case of Bamba consumption in Israel, with the early introduction of peanut in diets, offers lessons for reducing rates of peanut allergy among children. Bamba has the potential to be a less potent and safer substrate for peanut oral immunotherapy compared to raw and roasted peanuts. The snack has decreased IgE binding, lower levels of major allergens, and decreased protein extractability per unit mass. 

== Advertising ==
Bamba&#x27;s advertising features the &quot;Baby Bamba&quot; character heavily. &quot;Bamba Baby&quot; is a cartoon character, depicted wearing a blue diaper. He has one tooth, and is bald except for one ginger curl at the front of his head. In honor of International Women&#x27;s Day 2020, a female &quot;Baby Bamba&quot; was introduced. Female &quot;Baby Bamba&quot; wears a pink T-shirt and has pigtails. In March 2021 the baseball team New York Mets announced a partnership with the brand.

<text>Pocologan is a rural community in Charlotte County, New Brunswick, Canada. Pocologan word origin is from Maliseet that means marshy area or bay and also resting place for canoes. The community is named after the nearby Pocologan River.

Located on the Bay of Fundy between Saint John and St. George, the community originally included New River Beach.

Clam harvesting and processing was an early industry however it was mostly non-existent by the 1980s due to over-harvesting.

<text>A heliostat (from &quot;helios&quot;, the Greek word for &quot;sun&quot;, and &quot;stat&quot;, as in stationary) is a device that includes a mirror, usually a plane mirror, which turns so as to keep reflecting sunlight toward a predetermined target, compensating for the Sun&#x27;s apparent motions in the sky.

The target may be a physical object, distant from the heliostat, or a direction in space. To do this, the reflective surface of the mirror is kept perpendicular to the bisector of the angle between the directions of the Sun and the target as seen from the mirror. In almost every case, the target is stationary relative to the heliostat, so the light is reflected in a fixed direction. According to contemporary sources the heliostata, as it was called at first, was invented by Willem &#x27;s Gravesande (1688–1742). Other contenders are Giovanni Alfonso Borelli (1608–1679) and Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit (1686–1736). A heliostat designed by George Johnstone Storey is in the Science Museum Group collection.

Currently, most heliostats are used for daylighting or for the production of concentrated solar power, usually to generate electricity. They are also sometimes used in solar cooking. A few are used experimentally to reflect motionless beams of sunlight into solar telescopes. Before the availability of lasers and other electric lights, heliostats were widely used to produce intense, stationary beams of light for scientific and other purposes.

Most modern heliostats are controlled by computers. The computer is given the latitude and longitude of the heliostat&#x27;s position on the Earth and the time and date. From these, using astronomical theory, it calculates the direction of the Sun as seen from the mirror, e.g. its compass bearing and angle of elevation. Then, given the direction of the target, the computer calculates the direction of the required angle-bisector, and sends control signals to motors, often stepper motors, so they turn the mirror to the correct alignment. This sequence of operations is repeated frequently to keep the mirror properly oriented.

Large installations such as solar-thermal power stations include fields of heliostats comprising many mirrors. Usually, all the mirrors in such a field are controlled by a single computer.

There are older types of heliostat which do not use computers, including ones that are partly or wholly operated by hand or by clockwork, or are controlled by light-sensors. These are now quite rare.

Heliostats should be distinguished from solar trackers or sun-trackers that point directly at the sun in the sky. However, some older types of heliostat incorporate solar trackers, together with additional components to bisect the sun-mirror-target angle.

A siderostat is a similar device which is designed to follow a fainter star, rather than the Sun.

==Large-scale projects==
In a solar-thermal power plant, like those of The Solar Project or the PS10 plant in Spain, a wide field of heliostats focuses the Sun&#x27;s power onto a single collector to heat a medium such as water or molten salt. The medium travels through a heat exchanger to heat water, produce steam, and then generate electricity through a steam turbine.

A somewhat different arrangement of heliostats in a field is used at experimental solar furnaces, such as the one at Odeillo, in France. All the heliostat mirrors send accurately parallel beams of light into a large paraboloidal reflector which brings them to a precise focus. The mirrors have to be located close enough to the axis of the paraboloid to reflect sunlight into it along lines parallel to the axis, so the field of heliostats has to be narrow. A closed loop control system is used. Sensors determine if any of the heliostats is slightly misaligned. If so, they send signals to correct it.

It has been proposed that the high temperatures generated could be used to split water producing hydrogen sustainably.

==Small-scale projects==
Smaller heliostats are used for daylighting and heating. Instead of many large heliostats focusing on a single target to concentrate solar power (as in a solar power tower plant), a single heliostat usually about 1 or 2 square meters in size reflects non-concentrated sunlight through a window or skylight. A small heliostat, installed outside on the ground or on a building structure like a roof, moves on two axes (up/down and left/right) in order to compensate for the constant movement of the Sun. In this way, the reflected sunlight stays fixed on the target (e.g. window).

Genzyme Center, corporate headquarters of Genzyme Corp. in Cambridge, Massachusetts, uses heliostats on the roof to direct sunlight into its12-story atrium.

In a 2009 article, Bruce Rohr suggested that small heliostats could be used like a solar power tower system. Instead of occupying hundreds of acres, the system would fit in a much smaller area, like the flat rooftop of a commercial building, he said. The proposed system would use the power in sunlight to heat and cool a building or to provide input for thermal industrial processes like processing food. The cooling would be performed with an absorption chiller. Rohr proposed that the system would be &quot;more reliable and more cost-effective per square meter of reflective area&quot; than large solar power tower plants, in part because it would not be sacrificing 80 percent of the power collected in the process of converting it to electricity.

==Design==
Heliostat costs represent 30-50% of the initial capital investment for solar power tower power plants depending on the energy policy and economic framework in the location country. It is of interest to design less expensive heliostats for large-scale manufacturing, so that solar power tower power plants may produce electricity at costs more competitive to conventional coal or nuclear power plants costs.

Besides cost, percent solar reflectivity (i.e. albedo) and environmental durability are factors that should be considered when comparing heliostat designs.

One way that engineers and researchers are attempting to lower the costs of heliostats is by replacing the conventional heliostat design with one that uses fewer, lighter materials. A conventional design for the heliostat&#x27;s reflective components utilizes a second surface mirror. The sandwich-like mirror structure generally consists of a steel structural support, an adhesive layer, a protective copper layer, a layer of reflective silver, and a top protective layer of thick glass. This conventional heliostat is often referred to as a glass/metal heliostat. Alternative designs incorporate recent adhesive, composite, and thin film research to bring about materials costs and weight reduction. Some examples of alternative reflector designs are silvered polymer reflectors, glass fiber reinforced polyester sandwiches (GFRPS), and aluminized reflectors. Problems with these more recent designs include delamination of the protective coatings, reduction in percent solar reflectivity over long periods of sun exposure, and high manufacturing costs.

==Tracking alternatives==
The movement of most modern heliostats employs a two-axis motorized system, controlled by computer as outlined at the start of this article. Almost always, the primary rotation axis is vertical and the secondary horizontal, so the mirror is on an alt-azimuth mount.

One simple alternative is for the mirror to rotate around a polar aligned primary axis, driven by a mechanical, often clockwork, mechanism at 15 degrees per hour, compensating for the Earth&#x27;s rotation relative to the Sun. The mirror is aligned to reflect sunlight along the same polar axis in the direction of one of the celestial poles. There is a perpendicular secondary axis allowing occasional manual adjustment of the mirror (daily or less often as necessary) to compensate for the shift in the Sun&#x27;s declination with the seasons. The setting of the drive clock can also be occasionally adjusted to compensate for changes in the Equation of Time. The target can be located on the same polar axis that is the mirror&#x27;s primary rotation axis, or a second, stationary mirror can be used to reflect light from the polar axis toward the target, wherever that might be. This kind of mirror mount and drive is often used with solar cookers, such as Scheffler reflectors. For this application, the mirror can be concave, so as to concentrate sunlight onto the cooking vessel.

The alt-azimuth and polar-axis alignments are two of the three orientations for two-axis mounts that are, or have been, commonly used for heliostat mirrors. The third is the target-axis arrangement in which the primary axis points toward the target at which sunlight is to be reflected. The secondary axis is perpendicular to the primary one. Heliostats controlled by light-sensors have used this orientation. A small arm carries sensors that control motors that turn the arm around the two axes, so it points toward the sun, incorporating a solar tracker. A simple mechanical arrangement bisects the angle between the primary axis, pointing to the target, and the arm, pointing to the Sun. The mirror is mounted so its reflective surface is perpendicular to this bisector. This type of heliostat was used for daylighting prior to the availability of cheap computers, but after the initial availability of sensor control hardware.

There are heliostat designs which do not require the rotation axes to have any exact orientation. For example, there may be light-sensors close to the target which send signals to motors so that they correct the alignment of the mirror whenever the beam of reflected light drifts away from the target. The directions of the axes need be only approximately known, since the system is intrinsically self-correcting. However, there are disadvantages, such as that the mirror has to be manually realigned every morning and after any prolonged cloudy spell, since the reflected beam, when it reappears, misses the sensors, so the system cannot correct the orientation of the mirror. There are also geometrical problems which limit the functioning of the heliostat when the directions of the Sun and the target, as seen from the mirror, are very different. Because of the disadvantages, this design has never been commonly used, but some people do experiment with it.

Typically, the heliostat mirror moves at a rate that is 1/2 the angular motion of the Sun. There is another arrangement that satisfies the definition of a heliostat yet has a mirror motion that is 2/3rd of the motion of the Sun.

Many other types of heliostat have also occasionally been used. In the very earliest heliostats, for example, which were used for daylighting in ancient Egypt, servants or slaves kept the mirrors aligned manually, without using any kind of mechanism. (There are places in Egypt where this is done today, for the benefit of tourists. In the 1997 film &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; an Egyptian boy holds a mirror to illuminate a wall inside a cave for a fictional archaeologist.) Elaborate clockwork heliostats were made during the 19th Century which could reflect sunlight to a target in any direction using only a single mirror, minimizing light losses, and which automatically compensated for the Sun&#x27;s seasonal movements. Some of these devices are still to be seen in museums, but they are not used for practical purposes today. Amateurs sometimes come up with &quot;ad hoc&quot; designs which work approximately, in some particular location, without any theoretical justification. An essentially limitless number of such designs are possible.

<doc id="1024215" wikidata="Q2062446" url="?curid=1024215" title="Kingdom Come (British band)">
<text>Kingdom Come were a British rock band fronted by Arthur Brown. The band was recognized for Brown&#x27;s theatrical and operatic singing, and a sound that drew from psychedelic and progressive rock. This combination made the band a hit on Britain&#x27;s festival circuit, but lack of record sales, indifference from music critics, and poor record label promotion (especially in the US) led to its eventual demise in 1974. 

The band was later marketed as Arthur Brown&#x27;s Kingdom Come in North America due to name conflicts with an unrelated band with the same name. Despite their lack of commercial success, Kingdom Come&#x27;s 1973 album &quot;Journey&quot; has received generally positive retrospective reviews from critics. Alan Holmes of &quot;Freq&quot; said that &quot;&quot;Journey&quot; was so far ahead of its time that you have to keep checking the sleeve to make sure that it really does say 1973 and not 1983&quot; and that the album was &quot;not only Arthur Brown&#x27;s masterpiece, but also one of the truly great albums of the seventies.&quot; 

The album was also &quot;most noted in retrospect as one of the first rock records to use a drum machine, which was still quite a novelty back in 1973&quot;.

==Band history==
After the collapse of The Crazy World of Arthur Brown in 1969, when keyboardist Vincent Crane and drummer Carl Palmer left to eventually form Atomic Rooster, Brown worked with a varied group of musicians on projects called Strangelands, Puddletown Express, and (briefly) the Captain Beefheart-influenced Rustic Hinge, before finding the musicians who would make up Kingdom Come. Chief among these was guitarist Andy Dalby, who was the only consistent member after Brown himself.

Apart from Brown and Dalby, at the time of their first album, &quot;Galactic Zoo Dossier&quot;, the band included Julian Paul Brown (no relation, synthesizer), Michael &quot;Goodge&quot; Harris (keyboards), Desmond Fisher (bass), and Martin &quot;Slim&quot; Steer (drums). The band appeared at the 1971 Glastonbury Festival and featured in the accompanying film. By the time of their second album, &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, Julian Paul Brown had left and Desmond Fisher was replaced by Phil Shutt, later known as Phil Curtis. Steer left in mid-1972 to be replaced by a drum machine. Harris left shortly before the recording of their final album, &quot;Journey&quot;, and was replaced by American keyboard and synthesizer player Victor Peraino. 

Brown stated in an interview with an English music magazine that the three albums were intended to present a thematic progression. The first focused on the state of humankind in the present, the second on the human animal itself and the dichotomy between the body and mind, and the third on cosmic and spiritual matters.

For synthesizers Kingdom Come used the VCS3, and the Mellotron and theremin also figured prominently in the group&#x27;s repertoire, especially after the addition of Victor Peraino in the band&#x27;s line-up. On the final album, &quot;Journey&quot;, recorded in November 1972, there was no drummer either on the record or on tour; all the drum sounds were from the Bentley Rhythm Ace, an early drum machine manufactured by the Ace Tone company of Japan (Ace Tone later evolved into the Roland Corporation). &quot;Journey&quot; was the first album on which a drum machine produced all the percussion.

A number of factors contributed to the end of Kingdom Come, including mediocre album sales, critical disdain, the revolving door membership of the band, and Brown&#x27;s frustration with the music business in general. The band dissolved rather than officially breaking up, with Brown citing a desire to play simpler music and opt for a simpler lifestyle in general in later interviews. Following their split, Peraino returned to Detroit, where he made an album called &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; in 1975 with some local musicians as Victor Peraino&#x27;s Kingdom Come. Nearly 40 years later, in 2014, Peraino made another album, &quot;Journey in Time&quot;, under the same group name, this time with guest appearances from Arthur Brown on five of the tracks.

<text>Gerald Lyman Kenneth Smith (February 27, 1898 – April 15, 1976) was an American Disciples clergyman, politician and organizer known for his populist and far-right demagoguery. He began his career as a leader of the populist Share Our Wealth movement during the Great Depression. After the death of Huey Long he shifted away from advocating wealth redistribution towards anti-communism and later anti-semitism, becoming known for far-right causes such as the Christian Nationalist Crusade, which he founded in 1942. He founded the America First Party in 1943 and was its 1944 presidential candidate, winning fewer than 1,800 votes.

Smith has been noted as &quot;the most persistently successful of America&#x27;s anti-Jewish propagandists&quot; and &quot;the most infamous American fascist&quot;.

Late in life, he built the Christ of the Ozarks statue in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, with donations, and initiated the Passion Play there.

==Early life and education==
Gerald Lyman Kenneth Smith was born on February 27, 1898, in Pardeeville, Wisconsin, to Sarah and Lyman Z. Smith. He had one sister, Barbara, who was ten years older. His father was a traveling salesman and preacher who spoke on patriotic occasions and was a supporter of Robert La Follette. Gerald Smith said of his childhood, &quot;We took it for granted that the word &#x27;Christian&#x27; was the companion for the word &#x27;American.&#x27;&quot; The family moved to rural Richland County, Wisconsin, and Gerald Smith received a public education, first at rural schools and then at a larger school in Viola. After Lyman Smith recovered from pernicious anemia, which he had suffered from during most of his son&#x27;s childhood, the family moved to Viroqua, Wisconsin, where Gerald Smith graduated high school in 1915.

In 1918, after two and a half years of study, Smith graduated from Valparaiso University in Indiana with a degree in biblical studies. Smith enlisted in the United States Army but was not deployed before the end of World War I. An attack of nephritis forced him to return to Viroqua to recuperate.

==Ministry==
Smith said that he determined he would be a Disciples of Christ minister, like three generations of his family before him, when he was twelve. He was ordained in 1916, while at Valparaiso. Upon his recovery from nephritis in 1919, he became a temporary pastor in Soldiers Grove, Wisconsin, then at a larger church in Footville, then organized another church in the larger community of Beloit. On return from a trip to Chicago, he expressed his earliest recorded views on race in a letter to his parents: &quot;[W]hen you see the white and black mixing it is terrible. White girls dancing cheek to cheek with black men. ... It sickens one.&quot;

After marriage and another period of illness, Smith joined a larger church in Kansas, Illinois. In 1922, he drew national attention for a sermon at a ministerial convention in St. Louis and moved to Indianapolis, where he preached to a congregation of two thousand. In Indianapolis, rumors circulated that he was a member of the Ku Klux Klan; an accusation Smith denied throughout his life.

In 1929, Smith&#x27;s wife contracted tuberculosis, and he moved his family to Shreveport, Louisiana, to seek treatment. He became minister of Kings Highway Christian Church, where his congregation included the city&#x27;s mayor, two bank presidents, and the president of the Chamber of Commerce. In his early time in Shreveport, Smith was ecumenical, preaching at B&#x27;Nai Zion Temple and in return sharing his pulpit with the temple&#x27;s rabbi.

==Politics==
===Huey Long and Share Our Wealth===

Upon his move to Shreveport, shortly after the 1929 stock market crash, Smith began to engage more actively in politics. He became chaplain of the Louisiana American Federation of Labor and delivered a keynote at the Louisiana chapter meeting of the American Bankers&#x27; Association. He also began preaching radio sermons calling for social reform and denouncing the Standard Oil Company.

Shortly after his arrival in the city, Smith met Governor Huey P. Long, who maintained a law office there. His friendship with Long ultimately forced his resignation from his church in 1933, as many of the congregation were opposed to Long. Following his resignation, Smith allegedly turned toward fascist politics by contacting William Dudley Pelley and attempting to reach Adolf Hitler to discuss &quot;Semitic&quot; and &quot;anti-German&quot; propaganda.

In 1934, Long formed the Share Our Wealth Society, which proposed minimum and maximum limits on household wealth and income, and named Smith its national organizer. In describing his campaign philosophy, Smith wrote that &quot;in order to succeed, a mass movement must be superficial for quick appeal, fundamental for permanence, dogmatic for certainty, and practical for workability.&quot; Smith delivered campaign speeches for Share Our Wealth throughout the country, described as &quot;a combination of Savonarola and Elmer Gantry&quot; and often drawing large crowds of supporters and hecklers. In 1935, he boasted to a reporter that he might &quot;duplicate the feat of Adolph Hitler in Germany&quot;. Behind the scenes, he encouraged Long to challenge President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936.

After Long was assassinated in 1935, Smith failed to take control of the Long faction in Louisiana and was effectively expelled from the state politically by Seymour Weiss. Smith was fired from Share Our Wealth, which was soon abolished.

===Union Party===

After departing Louisiana, Smith campaigned in Georgia for white supremacist Governor Eugene Talmadge, who intended to oppose Roosevelt for the 1936 Democratic nomination. Smith then joined Francis Townsend, an advocate of pension reform, in New York City on the incorrect belief that Townsend had acquired Long&#x27;s mailing list. Smith soon ingratiated himself to Townsend against the misgivings of many of Townsend&#x27;s advisors. In November 1935, Smith convinced Townsend to join with Charles Coughlin, an anti-Roosevelt Roman Catholic priest, to back William Lemke for president to oppose, in Smith&#x27;s words, &quot;the communistic philosophy of [Roosevelt advisors] Frankfurter, Ickes, Hopkins, and Wallace&quot;.

Late in the 1936 campaign, Smith announced his intent to form an independent movement to oppose communism and &quot;seize the government of the United States.&quot; He claimed support from &quot;ten million patriots&quot; willing to sacrifice their lives to prevent &quot;an international plot to collectivize [the United States]&quot; and from wealthy donors who would provide one percent of their annual incomes &quot;to make America vigorously nationalistic.&quot; Townsend promptly disowned Smith and Lemke&#x27;s campaign manager expelled him from the Union Party, despite his protests. Coughlin ignored the controversy, having already developed antipathy toward Smith during the campaign.

In the fall of 1936, Smith returned to Louisiana to join former Governor James A. Noe in a tour of Louisiana in which the two railed against Governor Richard Leche&#x27;s sales tax on luxury items, revenue that the governor claimed was essential for the state&#x27;s share of the new Social Security program. Noe charged that Leche &quot;sold out to Roosevelt to finance Social Security.&quot; On October 22, he was punched in the face after delivering a radio talk in New Orleans. On the night before the election, he was arrested for disturbing the peace, reviling the police, and using obscene language after attacking Leche on statewide radio. Despite the boasts of Smith, Townsend, and Coughlin, the Union ticket received only 2 percent of the national vote, mostly in Catholic precincts where Coughlin&#x27;s popularity was strongest; within two years, the party collapsed entirely.

===America First Party of 1943===
As European tensions rose with the ascendancy of the Nazi Party in Germany, Smith tried to form an alliance with the non-interventionist America First Committee, but did not succeed.

In 1943, Smith formed the America First Party, essentially appropriating the name. He became a member of William Dudley Pelley&#x27;s fascist Silver Legion of America, which was patterned after Hitler&#x27;s brown shirts. (Pelley was later convicted for violating the Espionage Act in 1942 and sentenced to 15 years in prison, but he was acquitted in 1944 for violating the Alien Registration Act.) Smith told an audience of Silver Shirts, &quot;We&#x27;re going to drive that cripple out of the White House,&quot; meaning Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

After moving to Michigan, Smith ran for the United States Senate as a Republican from there, but lost in the primary.

In 1947, the Anti-Defamation League of B&#x27;nai Brith cited Smith&#x27;s Christian Nationalist Crusade along with Merwin K. Hart&#x27;s National Economic Council and the Ku Klux Klan as &quot;organized anti-Jewish organizations... which had significant influence, resources and membership.&quot; In late 1947, Smith moved CNC offices from Detroit to St. Louis.

===Presidential bids===
Smith ran as the America First Party candidate in the 1944 presidential election, winning 1,781 votes (1530 in Michigan, 281 in Texas). In 1948, with running mate Harry Romer on the Christian Nationalist Party ticket, he received 48 votes. Smith&#x27;s only other bid for the presidency was in 1956, when he received eight write-in votes in California.

Of his run for president, Smith biographer Glen Jeansonne wrote, &quot;Smith was fascinated by the Office of the President of the United States&quot;, and that &quot;Gerald Smith ran for president because he lusted for power, but his hatred for Jews and his relentless crusade against them had no such &#x27;rational&#x27; motivation&quot;.

===Post-war activities===
In 1946, Smith was sentenced to 60 days in jail for contempt in court for Illinois for misconduct at the trial of Arthur Terminiello, a Catholic priest charged over inflammatory comments made against various racial groups. His publicity agent, Don Lohbeck, who was found guilty with him, was sentenced to 30 days in jail.

In the early 1950s, at the time of the appointment of Anna M. Rosenberg as Assistant Secretary of Defense, the Anti-Defamation League published an article attributing the attacks on Rosenberg&#x27;s loyalty to &quot;professional anti-Semites and lunatic nationalists&quot;, including the &quot;Jew-baiting cabal of John Rankin, Benjamin Freedman and Gerald Smith&quot;. Smith&#x27;s activism in the Los Angeles area was opposed by a coalition of Jewish and black groups; a headline in the &quot;B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Messenger&quot; called him &quot;the Little Fuehrer&quot;.

In 1956, Smith joined a strong campaign against the Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act. He was among such opponents as those who nicknamed it the &quot;Siberia Bill&quot; and denounced it as being part of a communist plot to hospitalize and brainwash Americans. It was a bipartisan, federal effort to improve mental health care for residents of Alaska, which was still a territory, and its passage was aided by the support of the conservative senator Barry Goldwater.

The Christian Nationalist platform called for deportations of Jews and African Americans. Smith and his groups also targeted screeds against Catholics, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and others. In 1959, the &quot;Cross and the Flag&quot;, the Christian Nationalist Crusade&#x27;s magazine, claimed that six million Jews were not killed in death camps in Europe during World War II but instead immigrated to the United States during the war.

===Last years===
Smith eventually moved to Eureka Springs, Arkansas, where he bought and renovated a mansion as a retirement home. In 1964, he began construction of a planned religious theme park on his own property, to be called &quot;Sacred Projects&quot;. Smith&#x27;s biographer, Glen Jeansonne, in &quot;Gerald L. K. Smith: Minister of Hate&quot;, writes that Smith only had $5,000 to his name at the end of 1963 and yet raised $1,000,000 by the spring of 1964 to commission and construct the &quot;Christ of the Ozarks&quot; project.

Although the park was never fully developed, in 1966 the centerpiece, the Christ of the Ozarks statue, was completed on Magnetic Mountain at an elevation of 1,500 feet, from where it overlooked the town. Emmet Sullivan, the sculptor, had worked under Gutzon Borglum as one of the sculptors of Mount Rushmore.

Smith&#x27;s original plans were for a life-size recreation of ancient Jerusalem in the hills near Eureka Springs; no construction of this portion took place. He did initiate an annual outdoor Passion Play, inspired by another passion play which is performed every ten years in the town of Oberammergau, Germany. It is staged in an amphitheater located near the statue for several nights each week from late April through late October.

==Personal life and death==

Smith married Elna Sorenson in 1922. The couple adopted their only child, whom they named Gerald L. K. Smith Jr.

Smith died age 78 on April 15, 1976, of pneumonia in Glendale, California. His wife took over the Christian Nationalist Crusade at his death. With his wife, he is buried adjacent to the Christ of the Ozarks statue, where hymns are continuously played near the graves.

==Works==

Smith is claimed to be the originator of the following quotation, often wrongly attributed to others (in particular Baptist pastor, author, and political commentator, Adrian Rogers, who quoted it in a sermon without attribution):
According to the Congressional Record of 1958, it had also been said by U.S. Senator James Eastland of Mississippi during his address at the November 13, 1957, annual meeting of the Illinois Agricultural Association.

Smith read Henry Ford&#x27;s book &quot;The International Jew&quot;, of which he noted, &quot;The day came when I embraced the research of Mr. Ford and his associates and became courageous enough and honest enough and informed enough to use the words: &#x27;Communism is Jewish.&#x27;&quot; Smith sold many copies of this book, which he reprinted.

<doc id="1024217" wikidata="Q643640" url="?curid=1024217" title="Fudai daimyō">
<text>was a class of &quot;daimyō&quot; (大名) in the Tokugawa Shogunate (徳川幕府) of Japan who were hereditary vassals of the Tokugawa before the Battle of Sekigahara. &quot;Fudai daimyō&quot; and their descendants filled the ranks of the Tokugawa administration in opposition to the &quot;tozama daimyō&quot; and held most of the power in Japan during the Edo period.

==Origins==
&quot;Fudai daimyōs&quot; originated from the families and clans who had served the prominent Tokugawa clan before its rise to national primacy during the Azuchi–Momoyama period in the late Sengoku period, including the Honda, Sakai, Sakakibara, Ii, Itakura, and Mizuno clans. 
A number of other clans which were not retainers of the Tokugawa before the Azuchi–Momoyama period also came to be counted as &quot;fudai&quot;, such as the Ogasawara and the Doi. Honda Tadakatsu, Sakakibara Yasumasa, Sakai Tadatsugu, and Ii Naomasa — Tokugawa Ieyasu&#x27;s &quot;Four Great Generals&quot; — were all pre-Edo period &quot;fudai&quot; who went on to become &quot;fudai daimyōs&quot;. In addition, some branches of the Matsudaira clan, from which the Tokugawa clan originated, were classed as &quot;fudai&quot; while allowed to retain the Matsudaira name.

According to &quot;Mikawa Monogatari&quot; which is authored by Ōkubo Tadataka, they are divided into Anjo Fudai, Yamanaka Fudai, and Okazaki Fudai. the vassals who served the Matsudaira clan when they had their base in Anjo Castle were Anjo Fudai, the vassals who served after they captured Yamanaka Castle were Yamanaka Fudai, and the vassals who served after they moved their base to Okazaki Castle were Okazaki Fudai. According to historian Yasutsune Owada, Anjo Fudai vassals has served the Matsudaira clan since the time of Ieyasu&#x27;s grandfather, Matsudaira Kiyoyasu. Thereby, Ieyasu highly valued them, and placed great importance on the Anjo Fudai vassals. The clans which considered as Anjo fudai were the Ishikawa, Ōkubo, Naitō, Abe, Aoyama, Uemura, Hiraiwa, Naruse, Sakai, Honda and Watanabe clan.

==Edo period (江戸時代)==
The birth of the &quot;fudai daimyō&quot; class began as Tokugawa Ieyasu (徳川家康) rose to power in Japan in the 16th century. Ieyasu&#x27;s &quot;han&quot; (domains) increased as he gained prominence, and as his domains increased, he began to hand out landholdings to his vassals, so that one by one, many of them became &quot;daimyōs&quot;, the powerful feudal lords of the &quot;samurai&quot; warrior noble class. Ieyasu became the most powerful lord in Japan following victory at the Battle of Sekigahara in October 1600, displacing the Toyotomi clan and unofficially founding the Tokugawa Shogunate as his &quot;de facto&quot; military government with himself as the &quot;Shōgun&quot;. However, Ieyasu sought to consolidate his rule from potential usurpers, including the Toyotomi loyalists who were still fighting for Toyotomi Hideyori, the son and designated successor of Ieyasu&#x27;s rival Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who had been an infant at the Battle of Sekigahara. The capital of the Tokugawa Shogunate was established in the eastern city of Edo, and Ieyasu filled his administration with &quot;fudai&quot; in fear of the &quot;tozama&quot; (&quot;outside&quot;) &quot;daimyōs&quot;, who became Tokugawa vassals only after the battle. The &quot;fudai&quot;, in contrast to the &quot;tozama&quot;, typically ruled small domains in strategic locations along Japan&#x27;s principal roads or in the Kantō region near Edo. High-ranking posts in the shogunate government (&quot;Bakufu&quot;) such as the &quot;rōjū&quot;, the &quot;wakadoshiyori&quot;, and the &quot;Kyoto Shoshidai&quot; normally went to &quot;fudai&quot;.

The Tudai daimyō lords usually characterized that with their domination in bureaucratic bodies of the central government, in contrast with the Tozama daimyō lords that mostly limited to their jurisdictions of their respective domains. However it was not almost the case, as The Ii clan, Honda clan of Tadakatsu branch, and Sakakibara clan were also hereditarily acted as guardians of provinces, and traditionally served more in military roles than bureaucratic ones.

Occasionally, a family could be raised to or from &quot;fudai&quot; status. For instance, the Matsudaira clan to which Matsudaira Sadanobu belonged went from being a &quot;fudai&quot; house to being a &quot;shinpan&quot; (recognized relative) of the Tokugawa family. Also, a &quot;hatamoto&quot; who had an increase in income which raised his income level over 10,000 &quot;koku&quot; became a &quot;fudai daimyō&quot;.

==&quot;Bakumatsu&quot; and Meiji Restoration==

Many &quot;fudai daimyōs&quot; were involved in the vigorous political activity of the &quot;Bakumatsu&quot;, the gradual decline of the Tokugawa Shogunate from 1853, and the renewed military activities which occurred in that period. Two such men of &quot;fudai daimyō&quot; background were Ogasawara Nagamichi and Itakura Katsukiyo, who were two of the last &quot;rōjū&quot;, and actively worked for reform and strengthening of the ailing shogunate. Others, such as Matsudaira Munehide, were involved in diplomacy and foreign affairs.

In the Boshin War of 1868 to 1869, when supporters of the Imperial Court rose up in the Meiji Restoration against the Tokugawa Shogunate, some &quot;fudai&quot; houses such as the Toda of Ogaki and the Tōdō of Tsu sided with the shogunate during the first battle at Toba–Fushimi. However, after the shogunate&#x27;s loss there, many &quot;fudai&quot; houses did not side with the shogunate or with remnants of the Shōgun&#x27;s former army under Enomoto Takeaki which moved northward to Hokkaido and eventually set up the Ezo Republic. Some remained neutral, while others (like the lords of Ōgaki and Tsu) switched allegiances and openly supported the new Imperial Japanese Army. Ogasawara Nagamichi and Itakura Katsukiyo led small groups of their retainers during the fight against the Imperial forces. However, their domains had already been occupied by the Imperial army, and were forced to participate in the war on the Imperial army&#x27;s behalf. Only one &quot;fudai daimyō&quot;, Hayashi Tadataka of Jōzai Domain, willingly left his domain early in 1868, and led most of his retainer force on behalf of the armies of the former &quot;Shōgun&quot;, in the fight against the Imperial army. Also, a handful of &quot;fudai&quot; in the north of Honshu formed part of the Northern Alliance, fighting for the Alliance but not for the now-retired &quot;Shōgun&quot;.

Most of the &quot;fudai&quot; in the country entered the Meiji era peacefully, and ruled their domains until abolition of the domains in 1871. After this, the former families of &quot;fudai daimyōs&quot; transitioned into the &quot;kazoku&quot; in the new Japanese nobility system.

<text>The Martin XB-27 (Martin Model 182) was an aircraft proposed by the Glenn L. Martin Company to fill a strong need in the United States Army Air Corps for a high-altitude medium bomber. Its design was based approximately on that of Martin&#x27;s own B-26 Marauder. The XB-27 remained on paper, and no prototypes were built.

<doc id="1024226" wikidata="Q4808781" url="?curid=1024226" title="Asset-based lending">
<text>Asset-based lending is any kind of lending secured by an asset. This means, if the loan is not repaid, the asset is taken. In this sense, a mortgage is an example of an asset-based loan. More commonly however, the phrase is used to describe lending to business and large corporations using assets not normally used in other loans. Typically, the different types of asset-based loans include accounts receivable financing, inventory financing, equipment financing, or real estate financing. Asset-based lending in this more specific sense is possible only in certain countries whose legal systems allow borrowers to pledge such assets to lenders as collateral for loans (through the creation of enforceable security interests).

==Usage==
Asset-based lending is usually done when the normal routes of raising funds is not possible, such as the capital markets (selling bonds to investors) and normal unsecured or mortgage secured bank. This is often because the company has exhausted other capital raising options or needs more immediate capital for project financing needs (such as inventory purchases, mergers, acquisitions, and debt purchasing). Asset-based loans are also usually accompanied by lower interest rates, as in the event of a default the lender can recoup its investment by seizing and liquidating the assets tied to the loan.

Many financial services companies now use asset-based lending package of structured and leveraged financial services. Many banks, both national investment banks (e.g. Citi, J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, et al.) and regional banks, offer these services to corporate clients.

Asset-based lenders are known for taking out tombstone ads in much the same way as investment banks.

An example of asset-based loan usage was when the global securitization market shrank to an all-time low after the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc in 2008. Within Europe in 2008, over 710 billion euros worth of bonds were issued, backed largely by asset-based loans, such as home and auto loans.

Asset-based lending, once considered a last-resort finance option, has become a popular choice for companies and individuals that do not have the credit ratings, track record, or patience to pursue more traditional capital sources.

==Features of asset-based loans==

===Asset-based loans===
An asset-based business line of credit is usually designed for the same purpose as a normal business line of credit: to allow the company to bridge itself between the timing of cashflows of payments it receives and expenses. The primary timing issue involves what are known as accounts receivables—the delay between selling something to a customer and receiving payment for it.

A non-asset-based line of credit will have a credit limit set on account opening by the accounts receivables size, to ensure that it is used for the correct purpose. An asset-based line of credit however, will generally have a revolving credit limit that fluctuates based on the actual accounts-receivable balances that the company has on an ongoing basis. This requires the lender to monitor and audit the company to evaluate the accounts receivable size, but also allows for larger limit lines of credits and can allow companies to borrow that which it normally would not be able. Generally, terms stipulating seizure of collateral in the event of default allow the lender to profitably collect the money owed to the company should the company default on its obligations.

===Factoring receivables===
Factoring of receivables is a subset of asset-based lending (which uses inventory or other assets as collateral). The lender mitigates its risk by controlling with whom the company does business to make sure that the company&#x27;s customers can actually pay.

Lines of credit may require that the company deposit all of its funds into a &quot;blocked&quot; account. The lender then approves any withdrawals from that account by the company and controls when the company pays down the line of credit balance.

===Pledging receivables===
Still another subset of a collateralized loan is a pledging of receivables and an assignment of receivables as collateral for the debt. In these instances, receivables are transferred to the lender when they are &quot;pledged&quot; as collateral. When the receivables are &quot;pledged&quot; as collateral, or &quot;assigned&quot; with the condition that the lender has recourse in the event the receivables are &quot;uncollectible&quot;, the receivables continue to be reported as the borrower&#x27;s asset on the borrower&#x27;s balance sheet and only a footnote is required to indicate these receivables are used as collateral for debt. The debt is reported as a liability on the borrower&#x27;s balance sheet and as an asset (specifically, a receivable) on the lender’s balance sheet.

In some situations, the lender can actually &quot;repledge&quot; or sell the collateral the borrower used to secure the loan from the lender. In this instance, the borrower continues to recognize the receivables as an asset on its balance sheet, and the lender only records the liability associated with the obligation to return the asset.

<doc id="1024229" wikidata="Q130842" url="?curid=1024229" title="Greater Lebanon">
<text>The State of Greater Lebanon (; ), informally known as French Lebanon, was a state declared on 1 September 1920, which became the Lebanese Republic (; ) in May 1926, and is the predecessor of modern Lebanon.

The state was declared on 1 September 1920, following Decree 318 of 31 August 1920, as a League of Nations Mandate under the proposed terms of the Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon which was to be ratified in 1923. When the Ottoman Empire was formally split up by the Treaty of Sèvres in 1920, it was decided that four of its territories in the Middle East should be League of Nations mandates temporarily governed by the United Kingdom and France on behalf of the League. The British were given Palestine and Iraq, while the French were given a mandate over Syria and Lebanon.

General Gouraud proclaimed the establishment of the state with its present boundaries after support from the majority of Lebanese regardless of religion and with Beirut as its capital. The new territory was granted a flag, merging the French flag with the Lebanese cedar.

==Background==

===Name and Conception===

The term &quot;Greater Lebanon&quot; alludes to the almost doubling of the size of the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate, the existing former autonomous region, as a result of the incorporation of the former Ottoman districts of Tripoli and Sidon as well as the Bekaa Valley. The Mutasarrifate had been established in 1861 to protect the local Christian population by the European powers under the terms of the Règlement Organique. The term, in French &quot;Le Grand Liban&quot;, was first used by the Lebanese intellectuals Bulus Nujaym and Albert Naccache, during the buildup to the 1919 Paris Peace Conference.

Nujaym was building on his widely read 1908 work &quot;La question du Liban&quot;, a 550-page analysis which was to become the foundation for arguments in favor of a Greater Lebanon. The work argued that a significant extension of Lebanon&#x27;s boundaries was required for economic success. The boundaries suggested by Nujaym as representing the &quot;Liban de la grande époque&quot; were drawn from the map of the 1860-64 French expedition, which has been cited as an example of a modern map having &quot;predicted the nation instead of just recording it&quot;.

===Paris Peace Conference===
On 27 October 1919, the Lebanese delegation led by Maronite Patriarch Elias Peter Hoayek presented the Lebanese aspirations in a memorandum to the Paris Peace Conference. This included a significant extension of the frontiers of the Lebanon Mutasarrifate, arguing that the additional areas constituted natural parts of Lebanon, despite the fact that the Christian community would not be a clear majority in such an enlarged state. The quest for the annexation of agricultural lands in the Bekaa and Akkar was fueled by existential fears following the death of nearly half of the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate population in the Great Famine; the Maronite church and the secular leaders sought a state that could better provide for its people. The areas to be added to the Mutasarrifate included the coastal towns of Beirut, Tripoli, Sidon and Tyre and their respective hinterlands, all of which belonged to the Beirut Vilayet, together with four Kazas of the Syria Vilayet (Baalbek, the Bekaa, Rashaya and Hasbaya).

==Proclamation==

Following the peace conference, the French were awarded the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, under which the definition of Lebanon was still to be set by the French. Most of the territory was controlled by the Occupied Enemy Territory Administration, with the remainder controlled for a short time by the Arab Kingdom of Syria until the latter&#x27;s defeat in July 1920. Following the decisive Battle of Maysalun, Lebanese Maronites openly celebrated the Arab defeat.

On 24 August 1920, French Prime Minister Alexandre Millerand wrote to Archbishop Khoury: &quot;Your country&#x27;s claims on the Bekaa, that you have recalled for me, have been granted. On instructions from the French government, General Gouraud has proclaimed at Zahle&#x27;s Grand Kadri Hotel, the incorporation into Lebanon of the territory that extends up to the summit of the Anti-Lebanon range and of Hermon. This is the Greater Lebanon that France wishes to form to assure your country of its natural borders.&quot;

== World War II and Later history ==
=== Syria-Lebanon Campaign ===

During World War II when the Vichy government assumed power over French territory in 1940, General Henri Fernand Dentz was appointed as high commissioner of Lebanon. This new turning point led to the resignation of Lebanese president Émile Eddé on 4 April 1941. After five days, Dentz appointed Alfred Naqqache for a presidency period that lasted only three months. The Vichy authorities allowed Nazi Germany to move aircraft and supplies through Syria to Iraq where they were used against British forces. Britain, fearing that Nazi Germany would gain full control of Lebanon and Syria by pressure on the weak Vichy government, sent its army into Syria and Lebanon.

After the fighting ended in Lebanon, General Charles de Gaulle visited the area. Under various political pressures from both inside and outside Lebanon, de Gaulle decided to recognize the independence of Lebanon. On 26 November 1941, General Georges Catroux announced that Lebanon would become independent under the authority of the Free French government.

=== Levant Crisis and Independence ===

Elections were held in 1943 and on 8 November 1943, the new Lebanese government unilaterally abolished the mandate. The French reacted by throwing the new government into prison. Lebanese nationalists declared a provisional government, and the British diplomatically intervened on their behalf. In the face of intense British pressure and protests by Lebanese nationalists, the French reluctantly released the government officials on 22 November 1943, and accepted the independence of Lebanon.

In October, the international community recognized the independence of Lebanon, which was admitted as a founding member of the United Nations along with Syria. On 19 December 1945, an Anglo-French agreement was eventually signed – both British forces from Syria and French forces from Lebanon were to be withdrawn by early 1946.

==Government==
The first Lebanese constitution was promulgated on 23 May 1926, and subsequently amended several times. Modeled after that of the French Third Republic, it provided for a bicameral parliament with Chamber of Deputies and a Senate (although the latter was eventually dropped), a President, and a Council of Ministers, or cabinet. The president was to be elected by the Chamber of Deputies for one six-year term and could not be reelected until a six-year period had elapsed; deputies were to be popularly elected along confessional lines.

A custom of selecting major political officers, as well as top ranks within the public administration, according to the proportion of the principal sects in the population was strengthened during this period. Thus, for example, the president ought to be a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim, and the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies a Shia Muslim. A Greek Orthodox and a Druze would always be present in the cabinet. This practice increased sectarian tension by providing excessive power to the Maronite president (such as the ability to choose the prime minister), and hindered the formation of a Lebanese national identity. Theoretically, the Chamber of Deputies performed the legislative function, but in fact bills were prepared by the executive and submitted to the Chamber of Deputies, which passed them virtually without exception. Under the Constitution, the French high commissioner still exercised supreme power, an arrangement that initially brought objections from the Lebanese nationalists. Nevertheless, Charles Debbas, a Greek Orthodox, was elected the first president of Lebanon three days after the adoption of the Constitution.

At the end of Debbas&#x27;s first term in 1932, Bishara al-Khuri and Émile Eddé competed for the office of president, thus dividing the Chamber of Deputies. To break the deadlock, some deputies suggested Shaykh Muhammad al Jisr, who was chairman of the Council of Ministers and the Muslim leader of Tripoli, as a compromise candidate. However, French high commissioner Henri Ponsot suspended the constitution on 9 May 1932, and extended the term of Debbas for one year; in this way he prevented the election of a Muslim as president. Dissatisfied with Ponsot&#x27;s conduct, the French authorities replaced him with Count Damien de Martel, who, on 30 January 1934, appointed Habib Pacha Es-Saad as president for a one-year term (later extended for an additional year).

Émile Eddé was elected president on 30 January 1936. A year later, he partially reestablished the Constitution of 1926 and proceeded to hold elections for the Chamber of Deputies. However, the Constitution was again suspended by the French high commissioner in September 1939, at the outbreak of World War II.

=== High Commissioners of the Levant ===
The High Commissioner of the Levant, named after 1941 the General Delegate to Syria and Lebanon, was the highest ranking authority representing France in the French-mandated countries of Syria and Lebanon. Its office was based in Beirut, Lebanon in the Pine Residence and is now the official residence of the French ambassador to Lebanon. The office was first held by Henri Gouraud. Jean Chiappe should have held office on 24 November 1940 but the aircraft taking him to Lebanon was shot down by mistake by Italian air force taking part in the Battle of Cape Spartivento near Sardinia. The pilot, Henri Guillaumet, the other members of the crew including Marcel Reine, the two passengers, Chiappe, his leader of the cabinet, were killed. Last to hold office was Étienne Paul-Émile-Marie Beynet which began on 23 January 1944 and ended on 1 September 1946, 5 months after the withdrawal of French forces in Lebanon.

===Education===
With the establishment of the &quot;Service de l&#x27;Instruction Publique&quot; (SIP), the Mandate’s institution responsible for overseeing Lebanon’s educational programme, the French authorities actively promoted French culture and the French language within Lebanese education. Foreign mission schools were the main institutions for education, providing higher standards of education than under Ottoman administration, with no state-run system. Although public educational institutions played a significant role in nation-state building throughout the Mandate era, the SIP contradicted this policy in Lebanon by permitting religious communities to establish their own private schools.

=== Personal Status Law ===
With the establishment of the Mandate of Greater Lebanon, personal status of citizens were designated to officially recognized sects, altering the political dynamics between the communities that resided in the territory, granting legal authority in civil law disputes to sect-based courts. The sect-based authority had at times inadvertently both affirmed and conflicted with the borders of Greater Lebanon, within civil legal matters such as divorce, as Linda Sayed argues that members of religious sects who lived outside of Greater Lebanon, which were given legal authority in Greater Lebanon could use its authority to contest legal decisions made in the Mandate territories they resided in such as the Mandate for Palestine. 

== Demographics ==
The first and only official religious census of Greater Lebanon was carried out in 1932 which concludes that the population is roughly split equality between Muslims and Christians, the largest sects being Maronite Christianity, Sunni Islam and Shia Islam.

In total 785,542 people lived within the boundaries of Greater Lebanon in 1932.

<text>Beal Aerospace was a launch vehicle development company founded in February 1997 by Andrew Beal, president of Beal Bank in Dallas, Texas. Headquartered in Frisco, Texas, the goal of the company was to build and operate a privately developed heavy lift orbital launch vehicle. It ceased operations on October 23, 2000.

==Company history==
After being founded in 1997, employment grew to approximately 200 people at the company&#x27;s peak in late 1999. A rocket engine test facility was successfully established in McGregor, Texas. There, the company conducted liquid-fueled engine tests, added several buildings, and built a vertical test stand. Ambitious plans were made to establish a launch pad on Sombrero Island in Anguilla, and to mass-produce launch vehicles in the Virgin Islands, but environmentalists were fiercely opposed to these development plans.

On March 4, 2000, Beal Aerospace conducted a successful test firing of the BA-2 rocket engine, the largest since the NASA Apollo program.

Following NASA&#x27;s announcement that they would fund research and development of competing launch vehicles under the Space Launch Initiative (SLI), Andrew Beal announced on October 23, 2000, that Beal Aerospace would cease operations. Beal cited NASA&#x27;s commercial practices as the primary reason for closing.

==Launch vehicles==
Beal Aerospace initially considered a rocket that used kerosene and liquid oxygen, but soon switched to kerosene fuel in combination with high concentration hydrogen peroxide oxidizer. This combination was selected in order to avoid the expense and complexity of cryogenic storage, and to reduce development costs. Kerosene was injected into the hot steam and oxygen exhaust products of catalytically decomposed hydrogen peroxide, resulting in spontaneous ignition. The original BA-1 launch vehicle design was intended to service the LEO (Low Earth Orbit) satellite constellation launch market, but was replaced by the much larger BA-2 design when it was decided to concentrate on the more stable Geostationary satellite launch market as the LEO constellations became financially unsound. All three stages of the BA-2 vehicle were to be pressure-fed using high-pressure helium storage to replace the expense and complexity of turbopumps. All of the BA-2 propellant tanks and primary structures were to be manufactured from lightweight composite materials. The engines were self-cooled with ablative materials.

==Subsequent history==
After the dissolution of Beal Aerospace, its McGregor, Texas test site was acquired by SpaceX to become its McGregor test site in late 2002.

<doc id="1024240" wikidata="Q2518704" url="?curid=1024240" title="Yesterday Went Too Soon">
<text>Yesterday Went Too Soon is the second studio album by Welsh rock band Feeder. It was released on 30 August 1999 on The Echo Label.

&quot;Yesterday Went Too Soon&quot; entered the UK charts at #8, after a decent amount of critical success. The title track gave them their first top 20 single, and the album would in total give the band 4 top 50 hits. Its critical and cult appeal including slots on Top of the Pops for the first time, enabled the album to aid the band&#x27;s breakthrough which was completed on the follow-up &quot;Echo Park&quot;.

The album gained a Silver certification in April 2001, shortly before the release of breakthrough album &quot;Echo Park&quot;, and then went Gold in March 2003 after the extended commercial recognition of &quot;Comfort In Sound&quot;, thus making the album an overdue commercial success sales-wise.

Despite the band&#x27;s American breakthrough with single &quot;High&quot; and extensive touring in the States, &quot;Yesterday Went Too Soon&quot; was never released in the US. Promotional copies of the album were released by the band&#x27;s former US label Elektra, but they would ultimately turn down the album for distribution.

==Charts and sales==
When the album was released, the band&#x27;s reputation was on the rise and it entered the UK albums chart at number eight, which was at the time an unexpected chart position for the band. Before that, the band had released the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Day In Day Out&quot;, in March 1999 which charted at #31 followed by &quot;Insomnia&quot; at #22, resulting in their first appearance on Top of the Pops. A week before the album&#x27;s release, the band played the main stage of the Reading and Leeds festivals, while the title track from the album was at #20 in the singles chart. The album was then released on 30 August 1999. Only one single was lifted from the album after its release, in which a re-recorded version of &quot;Paperfaces&quot; charted at #41.

The album was &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s #24 album of 1999, while &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; placed the album in at #6 and &quot;Kerrang!&quot; ranked it at #16.

==Background==
The band decided to self-produce the album, brought in Matt Sime for engineering duties and had the album mixed in New York by Andy Wallace.

The working title for the album was originally &quot;A Life Through Headphones&quot;, and was originally set to be a double album. The name change was due to former Take That singer Robbie Williams releasing his solo debut album &quot;Life Thru a Lens&quot;, with the band not wanting to be compared to him.

The album was written and recorded during and before the band&#x27;s US tour of 1998. Before they left the UK, some demos were recorded with a few completed into final recordings, with some of these featuring on their single &quot;Suffocate&quot; as B-sides. &quot;Dry&quot; on CD2 of the single was later made into a full band version, as opposed to the acoustic recording found on the single.

Some of the album&#x27;s lyrical themes were derived from Grant&#x27;s personal perspective of working in a menial supermarket job (&quot;Day in Day Out&quot;), his experiences after gigs on their US tour (&quot;Insomnia&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re My Evergreen&quot;), past relationships (the title track and &quot;Dry&quot;), the music industry (&quot;Hole in My Head&quot;) and &quot;fear of commitment in relationships&quot; (&quot;Anaesthetic&quot;) amongst others. Musically, the album employed an indie rock feel to it, which also featured extended appearances of an acoustic guitar on some of its tracks.

&quot;Dry&quot; was re-recorded as a full band version after the original acoustic version appeared on &quot;Suffocate&quot; as a b-side. That single&#x27;s b-sides featured tracks from the sessions for that album, therefore revealing what sort of direction it would take on.

The album was due for release in June 1999, but this was delayed to include material written after its completion which the band felt was too good to leave off.

Cover artwork and images for the album and related singles were photographed by Rick Guest in the grounds of the recently decommissioned RAF Ash in Kent.

<text>Echo Park is the third studio album by Welsh rock band Feeder. It was their first album since 1999&#x27;s &quot;Yesterday Went Too Soon&quot;. The album was recorded at Great Linford Manor in Milton Keynes during most of 2000 and was produced by Gil Norton.

Following a return to live performances of their own, after performing for most of the year at various festivals and the release of the singles &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; and &quot;Seven Days in the Sun&quot; the album was released on 23 April 2001. Two further singles—&quot;Turn&quot; and &quot;Just a Day&quot;—followed the album&#x27;s release, in which the latter was not on the album, but as a B-side on &quot;Seven Days in the Sun&quot;. The album initially received mixed reviews from the music press but was received well by the public and in retrospect by critics, reaching number five on the UK Albums Chart. It is the last album to feature drummer Jon Lee before his death the following year.

Following the minor commercial success of their highly regarded 1999 album, &quot;Yesterday Went Too Soon&quot;, the band appeared at the &quot;Manic Millennium&quot; concert at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, South Wales, supporting fellow Welsh band the Manic Street Preachers, before a headline show at the London Astoria the following year. During this time Grant Nicholas, the group&#x27;s frontman and principal songwriter, began to write new material for a future album, with songs such as &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; and &quot;Seven Days in the Sun&quot; emerging through the course of the year. Versions of the newly composed songs were performed many times during the course of 2000 at various festivals such as V2000 (in which &quot;Oxygen&quot; was performed, and broadcast on MTV UK), the Glastonbury Festival and T in the Park, before the band then embarked on a mini-tour playing small venues in December.

Lyrically a lot of the album is inspired by Grant Nicholas ending a long-term relationship around the time of writing the record. Mainly in songs such as &quot;Buck Rogers&quot;, &quot;Piece by Piece&quot;, &quot;We Can&#x27;t Rewind&quot;, &quot;Turn&quot;, &quot;Tell All Your Friends&quot; and &quot;Satellite News&quot;.

During the summer of the same year, Feeder began to finalise the song demos while on breaks from touring. The band recorded at the Milton Keynes recording studio, Great Lindford Manor, which comprises a family living upstairs and the studio downstairs.

Producer Gil Norton worked alongside the band. In an interview, Grant said that there were periods of time in which there was friction between him (Gil) and the band, but said that despite the occasional arguments, they still remained good friends, and continued to work together on the next two studio albums.

==Music==
&quot;Echo Park&quot; features a varied mix of musical styles. While most of the tracks are fast, with &quot;We Can&#x27;t Rewind&quot; showing aggression, and demonstrate the change in direction to a more commercial approach, other songs such as &quot;Piece by Piece&quot;, &quot;Satellite News&quot;, &quot;Turn&quot; and &quot;Oxygen&quot; reveal a quieter, slower and more melodic temperament. With &quot;Echo Park&quot;, the band began to incorporate additional instruments into their sound. Many tracks feature the use of Moog synthesizers, which Grant experimented with during the recording of the album. The opening track, &quot;Standing on the Edge&quot;, is seen by Grant as the most experimental track on the album, as it is mostly synthesized. The closing track &quot;Bug&quot;, was recorded live in the studio and uses more dirty-sounding riffs than most of the tracks on the record.

The voice heard at the beginning of the track &quot;Standing on the Edge&quot; is that of Matt Sime who is a friend of the band. He played keyboards on tour from 2000 to 2001, and also at their festival appearances of 2002. He continued to work with the band in the studio, engineering their recordings, until retiring permanently from the music business in 2011.

The lyrical themes explored on &quot;Echo Park&quot; range from those of relationships on &quot;Buck Rogers&quot;, to the idea of turning the clock back and wanting to change the past on &quot;Turn&quot;. The two songs both feature dark moods in the lyrics, with &quot;Oxygen&quot; and &quot;Satellite News&quot; also employing a similar approach.

==Release==
&quot;Echo Park&quot; was released in the United Kingdom on 23 April 2001. Before the album&#x27;s release, the single &quot;Seven Days in the Sun&quot; reached #14 in the UK Singles Chart, which was the follow-up to &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; which reached #5. The album entered the UK Albums Chart at the same position, before becoming their first Gold album; they had been in danger of splitting up if the album didn&#x27;t sell well. Grant said at the time in a &quot;Melody Maker&quot; interview, &quot;It&#x27;s the same with any band. That&#x27;s just the way the music business is. There is only a certain amount of money a label will put into a band. I&#x27;m just being realistic. We&#x27;ve been around for seven or eight years and I am not planning on giving up, but we&#x27;re putting everything into this record and I&#x27;m just hoping that people like it&quot;.

In July 2001 Echo released &quot;Turn&quot; as the third UK single to be taken directly from the album. The single reached #27 on the UK Singles Chart. It was the last UK single from the album, but &quot;Just a Day&quot;, a B-side from &quot;Seven Days in the Sun&quot;, was released in December of that year, and made #12 in the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Piece by Piece&quot; was released in Europe only shortly after &quot;Turn&quot;. In August 2003, the album was later certified Platinum after the commercial success of &quot;Comfort in Sound&quot;.

===Accolades===
In 2015, &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; included the album in its list &quot;In Depth: Lost Albums 2000–2015&quot;. a list of 16 albums the website considers to be great but overlooked.

The album was also featured as one of 38 albums on the Official Charts website as one of their “Albums turning 20 years old in 2021”.

The week the album was released “Free All Angels”, by Northern Ireland band Ash, entered the top spot of the album charts and initially had a substantial career sales lead over “Echo Park”. In late 2020 however, “Echo Park” sold more than any other album to be released that week overall, on 332,000 sales. “Free All Angels” stood on 299,000 at the time, aided hugely by streaming equivalent sales for &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; being much more significant than that of &quot;Shining Light&quot; the most streamed track from Ash&#x27;s album.
