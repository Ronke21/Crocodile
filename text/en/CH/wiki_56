<text>In Dutch history, the year 1672 is referred to as the  (; Disaster Year). In May 1672, following the outbreak of the Franco-Dutch War and its peripheral conflict the Third Anglo-Dutch War, France, supported by Münster and Cologne, invaded and nearly overran the Dutch Republic. At the same time, it faced the threat of an English naval blockade in support of the French endeavor, though that attempt was abandoned following the Battle of Solebay. A Dutch saying coined that year describes the Dutch people as (&quot;irrational&quot;), its government as (&quot;distraught&quot;), and the country as (&quot;beyond salvation&quot;). The cities of the coastal provinces of Holland, Zealand and Frisia underwent a political transition: the city governments were taken over by Orangists, opposed to the republican regime of the Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt, ending the First Stadtholderless Period.

By late July however, the Dutch position had stabilised, with support from Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I, Brandenburg-Prussia, and Spain; this was formalised in the August 1673 Treaty of the Hague, which Denmark joined in January 1674. Following further defeats at sea at the hands of the Dutch navy, the English, whose parliament was suspicious of King Charles&#x27;s motives in his alliance with France, and with Charles himself wary of French domination of the Spanish Netherlands, settled a peace with the Dutch republic in the Treaty of Westminster in 1674. With England, Cologne, and Münster having made peace with the Dutch and with the war expanding into the Rhineland and Spain, French troops withdrew from the Dutch Republic, retaining only Grave and Maastricht. To offset these setbacks, Swedish forces in Swedish Pomerania attacked Brandenburg-Prussia in December 1674 after Louis threatened to withhold their subsidies; this sparked Swedish involvement in the 1675–1679 Scanian War and the Swedish-Brandenburg War whereby the Swedish army tied up the armies of Brandenburg and some minor German principalities plus the Danish army in the north.

From 1674 to 1678, the French armies managed to advance steadily in the southern Spanish Netherlands and along the Rhine, defeating the badly coordinated forces of the Grand Alliance with regularity. Eventually the heavy financial burdens of the war, along with the imminent prospect of England&#x27;s reentry into the conflict on the side of the Dutch and their allies, convinced Louis XIV of France to make peace despite his advantageous military position. The resulting Peace of Nijmegen between France and the Grand Alliance left the Dutch Republic intact and France generously aggrandized in the Spanish Netherlands.

==Situation in the Republic==
During the Eighty Years&#x27; War there had been tension in the provinces between adherents of a government ruled by the burgher oligarchy, called regents, and those who favoured a government led by the Prince of Orange. These tensions had escalated in 1650 when William II, Prince of Orange had tried to conquer Amsterdam, the main bastion of the Regents of the De Graeff and Bicker clans. After negotiations, he succeeded in removing a number of his adversaries from office.

When William died from smallpox later that year, the republican party came back into power. The Act of Seclusion declared that they would not appoint his son, William III of Orange, or anybody else to the office of Stadholder, stating that a supreme head of government would be harmful to &#x27;True Liberty&#x27;. Johan de Witt was appointed Grand Pensionary of Holland and led the States of Holland, the most important province within the Union.

The takeover by the regents did not go without protest from the Orangists, but with the economy booming and peace on the Union&#x27;s borders they had little opportunity to remove the government from office. To appease the Orangists, and because of their own business interests, the Dutch Regents tried to keep the peace within Europe.

==Foreign affairs==
When the Republic fought for its independence from Spain, it had allied with France and England. In 1648, as part of the Peace of Westphalia, the Republic made peace with Austria and Spain. France had only made peace with Austria and continued fighting Spain until the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659. A condition of that peace was that Louis XIV would marry Maria Theresa, daughter of Philip IV of Spain. Maria Theresa would also renounce her share of the inheritance in exchange for a large dowry. The dowry, however, was never paid by the Spanish.

During the 1650s and 1660s the existing tensions between Dutch trade interests and English trade interests grew. The First Anglo-Dutch War was fought between the republics, resulting in a victory for the English. In a secret appendix to the Treaty of Westminster, the Act of Seclusion, Holland declared that it abolished the office of Stadholder and would never allow the States-General of the Netherlands to appoint a member of the House of Orange to the office of Captain-General. Oliver Cromwell, who was Lord Protector of England at that time, insisted on this condition because William II had assisted Charles I (his father-in-law) during the English Civil War. While supporters of the Dutch Regent favoured diminishing the influence of the House of Orange, by agreeing to the English conditions they intermingled internal and foreign affairs and infuriated the pro-Orange faction.
When Charles II was crowned king of England in 1660 during the English Restoration, the Act of Seclusion was declared void, but to the dismay of Holland, Charles affirmed those clauses of the peace which negatively impacted Dutch trade interests.

An English attempt to take over Dutch trade and colonies led to the Second Anglo-Dutch War. After the previous war Johan de Witt had supervised the expansion and improvement of the Dutch navy at the cost of neglecting the Dutch army. With the new fleet and the help of France, with whom they had allied again, the Dutch ultimately defeated the English at sea through the Raid on the Medway and put pressure on the English ally Münster. First Münster and then England were forced to make peace. While France had helped to put pressure on England and Münster they had not committed a major part of their army or fleet. After the death of Philip IV, Louis XIV claimed part of the inheritance for his wife. According to local law in parts of the Spanish Netherlands daughters of an earlier marriage took precedence before the sons of a later marriage. The way Louis XIV explained this, Maria Theresa, daughter of the first marriage of Philip IV, should inherit the Spanish Netherlands because Philip&#x27;s son, Charles II was from Philip&#x27;s second marriage. This went against the interests of the Dutch Republic, who preferred having a weak state as their neighbour to the south.

Because of this, Johan de Witt allied with the defeated English and Sweden, who had an army nearby in Germany, forming the Triple Alliance. In secret clauses of the treaty they agreed to use force if Louis XIV would not come to terms with Spain.

==&quot;Renversement des Alliances&quot;==
France made peace with Spain, but because the secret clauses of the Triple Alliance were soon made public, Louis XIV felt insulted by the &quot;perfidious&quot; Dutch, who according to him had broken faith. Immediately after the peace agreement, France took steps to isolate the Republic. Sweden and Münster were quickly bribed, but the English public distrusted Louis XIV. The English king, on the other hand, saw war with the Dutch as being in his best interests. He hoped that a defeat of the Republic would lead to the fall of the republican government so that his nephew, William III of Orange, could take power. A war would also be a good opportunity to crush the Dutch competition in trade and colonies. Additionally, Louis promised Charles a notable sum of money, so enabling him to rule without having to consult the English parliament.

In 1670, after the mediation of Charles&#x27; sister Henrietta Anne Stuart, wife of Louis&#x27;s brother the Duc d&#x27;Orléans, France and England signed the secret Treaty of Dover.

==To war==
The Dutch were aware that negotiations between England and France were going on, but specific details were not known. Johan de Witt counted on the unpopularity among the English public of a war with a fellow Protestant nation and tried to improve relations with the French. The discussion on the issue of the Spanish Netherlands, however, yielded no consensus between the two countries. France saw the Rhine as its natural border and between France and the Rhine lay the Spanish Netherlands and the Dutch Generality Lands. The Dutch felt threatened by the French ambitions. According to the French ambassador, the Dutch acted from the motto: &quot;Gallicus amicus, non vicinus&quot;, or &quot;The Frenchman is a good friend, but a bad neighbour&quot;. The Dutch again reinforced their fleet, but made insufficient preparations for their army because of a shortage of money. The Regents also distrusted an army that had often been an instrument of the Orange party. With war becoming more and more likely, pressure increased on the Dutch government to appoint William III, who had not yet come of age, to the office of Stadtholder and Captain-General. In February 1672, Johan de Witt finally agreed to appoint William as Captain-General for the duration of a single war campaign.

==War==
On 12 March 1672 Robert Holmes attacked a Dutch trade convoy, the Smyrna fleet. France, the Electorate of Cologne and the Bishopric of Münster declared war in April. In June, Louis XIV&#x27;s army, led by Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Condé and Turenne bypassed the Dutch southern defence through the Spanish Netherlands, the possessions of Münster and Cologne and other French allies and invaded the Dutch from the east.

At the IJssel, a short battle was easily won by the French and Groenlo was taken. The whole of the Republic lay open to the French. Panic broke out in the cities in Holland, Zeeland and Utrecht. Lower and middle-class people revolted against the government and demanded the appointment of the Prince along with the punishment of those responsible for the war and the state of the army. Johan de Witt and several others resigned and the government of the Regents fell. Partisans of William III took over. One of William&#x27;s first acts was to strike out the word &#x27;honourably&#x27; from Johan de Witt&#x27;s letter of resignation.

==Lynching of the De Witt brothers==
Popular sentiment remained unsatisfied and frustrations with the hopeless military situation led to the search for scapegoats. In August, Cornelis de Witt, the less gifted and less popular brother of Johan de Witt, was imprisoned in The Hague on suspicion of treason and plotting to assassinate William. When Johan de Witt visited his brother, the small cavalry security detail present was sent away on the pretext of stopping a group of marauding peasants. Around the prison a crowd had gathered, demanding the punishment of the brothers. The prison was stormed — according to some contemporary accounts, after Orangist Cornelis Tromp, an enemy of Johan de Witt, had given the sign — by civil militia. The brothers were taken and murdered by the militia members and their bodies mutilated and partly eaten by the crowd. The names of a few of the murderers became known but they were protected and, in some cases, even rewarded by Prince William. Many modern historians suspect that the murders were the result of a conspiracy involving, among others, William himself, although direct evidence for his involvement has not been found.

==The Waterline==
The French had advanced from the IJssel to Utrecht. By that time, negotiations had begun. Louis XIV and Charles II of England had intended that William become Sovereign Prince at the head of a Hollandic rump state principality, a joint protectorate (with the British occupying key Hollandic cities and the isle of Walcheren). Louis halted his army to allow the Orangists to take over Holland and come to an arrangement with him. He offered the Dutch peace in exchange for either the southern fortresses, religious freedom for Catholics and six million guilders, or the retention of his present conquests and sixteen million guilders. These demands, especially the financial portions, led to a renewed public outrage and the Dutch mood abruptly changed from defeatism to a dogged determination to resist the French.

While negotiations took place, the French failed to prevent the Dutch from inundating the Dutch Waterline. Before the French understood the nature and importance of this defence system, William III&#x27;s small army withdrew behind it and further French advance was blocked by an impassable barrier of water and mud. This small success for the Dutch was followed by others. The Dutch fleet under admiral Michiel de Ruyter had already defeated the Anglo-French fleet at the Battle of Solebay, and on 28 August 1672 the German Bishop of Münster, Bernhard von Galen, withdrew from the siege of Groningen – an event still celebrated annually in Groningen.

On the diplomatic front, the Holy Roman Empire and Spain took the side of the Netherlands. In 1673, Bonn fell to a Dutch army. This forced the French to retreat from most of the Republic. England, Münster and Cologne made peace in 1674; the French fought on until 1678. (For the rest of the war, see Franco-Dutch War.)

==Effects==
The experience of the Rampjaar had considerable influence on the direction of Dutch foreign policy. William III saw it as his life&#x27;s work to defend both the Republic and Europe against French hegemony. In all the wars of Louis XIV, the Dutch would support his adversaries. In 1688, when faced with an English king who again seemed to side with the French, the Dutch mobilised their full resources in order to invade Britain and overthrow the Catholic Stuart Dynasty (the Glorious Revolution)—an event of immense historical importance. Although a gamble, it was considered worthwhile, since after the Rampjaar, the possibility of a Catholic and French-dominated Britain was regarded as a mortal threat to the Netherlands. In England, public opinion was already turning against the French but was accelerated by the war of 1672. While Charles II and his successor James II of England still had French sympathies, they had to take into account the English public&#x27;s distrust of France.

The Dutch economy never fully recovered from the severe crisis, although the Dutch Golden Age is sometimes said to have continued until the end of the century. The art market was as severely affected as other trades. A famous comment by Jan Vermeer&#x27;s widow described how he was unable to sell work thereafter. The leading maritime artists, Willem van de Velde the Elder and his son Willem II, both emigrated to London, never to return.

<doc id="1027194" wikidata="Q284224" url="?curid=1027194" title="City of Kogarah">
<text>The City of Kogarah was a local government area in the St George region of southern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. The centre of the city is located south-west of the Sydney central business district and west of Botany Bay.

The Municipality of Kogarah was established on 22 December 1885 and in 2008 Kogarah became the first local government area in New South Wales to become a city by popular vote. The city was bounded by the Illawarra railway line, Georges River, Rocky Point Road, Princes Highway and Harrow Road. The name &quot;Kogarah&quot; is Aboriginal, meaning place of reeds and takes its name from the reeds that grew in the inlets along the Georges River and at the head of Kogarah Bay. On 12 May 2016, the NSW Government announced that Kogarah and Hurstville councils would merge to form Georges River Council with immediate effect.

==Council history==
The &quot;Municipal District of Kogarah&quot; was proclaimed on 23 December 1885, and the district&#x27;s boundaries commenced at the intersection of the Illawarra Railway Line with the northern shore of Georges River. The Municipal District was renamed the &quot;Municipality of Kogarah&quot; following the passage of the &quot;Municipalities Act, 1897&quot; on 6 December 1897. On 22 December 1916 and 1 January 1969, parts of Municipality of Rockdale were transferred to Kogarah. Kogarah was proclaimed a city in 2008.

In December 1920, Kogarah combined with the councils of Rockdale, Hurstville, and Bexley to form the St George County Council. The elected County Council was established to provide electricity to the Kogarah, Rockdale, Hurstville, and Bexley areas, and ceased to exist when it was amalgamated with the Sydney County Council on 1 January 1980.

===Council Chambers===
In 1910 the council acquired land in Belgrave Street, Kogarah, for £285. The foundation stone of the Council Chambers was laid 27 March 1912 by the Mayor W. J. Jones and was designed by Alderman Charles Herbert Halstead. The completed Council Chambers was officially opened on 7 September 1912 by the Governor, Lord Chelmsford.

The 1912 Council Chambers had had many alterations, including a first floor addition completed to a design by architects Moore &amp; Dyer in 1937 which had required the council to hold its meetings at the St George County Council headquarters in Montgomery Street while construction occurred. The newly remodelled chambers were officially reopened by the Minister for Local Government, Eric Spooner, on 28 April 1937. In 1970 it was decided to replace the old council chambers, which were demolished to make way for the Kogarah Civic Centre, opened by Governor Sir Roden Cutler in 1973.

===Amalgamation===
Efforts to bring about a unified council for the St George area were raised regularly since 1901 and the 1946 Clancy Royal Commission into local government boundaries recommended the amalgamation of the municipalities of Hurstville, Kogarah, Rockdale and Bexley. In the following act of parliament passed in December 1948, the Local Government (Areas) Act 1948, the recommendations of the commission were modified, leading only to the merger of Bexley and Rockdale councils. A merger was again considered in the 1970s, but 1977 plebiscites run in Hurstville and Kogarah rejected the idea. A further idea of amalgamating Kogarah and Hurstville with Sutherland Shire to the south was raised in 1999 but did not progress. Kogarah opposed an attempt by the NSW Government to amalgamate with Hurstville and Rockdale in 2003.

A 2015 review of local government boundaries by the NSW Government Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal recommended that Kogarah merge with the City of Hurstville to form a new council with an area of and support a population of approximately 147,000. On 12 May 2016, the NSW Government announced that Kogarah and Hurstville would merge to form Georges River Council with immediate effect.

== Demographics ==
At the 2011 Census, there were people in the Kogarah local government area, of these 48.8% were male and 51.2% were female. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 0.4% of the population. The median age of people in the Kogarah City Council was 37 years. Children aged 0 – 14 years made up 17.6% of the population and people aged 65 years and over made up 14.1% of the population. Of people in the area aged 15 years and over, 54.5% were married and 8.8% were either divorced or separated.

Population growth in the City between the 2001 Census and the 2006 Census was 5.32%; and in the subsequent five years to the 2011 Census, population growth was 6.22%. When compared with total population growth of Australia for the same periods, being 5.78% and 8.32% respectively, population growth in Kogarah local government area was marginally lower than the national average. The median weekly income for residents within the city was generally on par with the national average.

== Council ==
===Composition and election method===
Kogarah City Council was composed of twelve councillors elected proportionally as four separate wards, each electing three councillors. All councillors were elected for a fixed four-year term of office. The mayor was elected by the councillors at the first meeting of the council. The last election was held on 8 September 2012, and the final makeup of the council for the term 2012–2016, in order of election by ward, was as follows:

<doc id="1027198" wikidata="Q5141383" url="?curid=1027198" title="Cohoba">
<text>Cohoba is a Taíno transliteration for a ceremony in which the ground seeds of the &quot;cojóbana&quot; tree (&quot;Anadenanthera&quot; spp.) were inhaled, the Y-shaped nasal snuff tube used to inhale the substance, and the psychoactive drug that was inhaled. Use of this substance produced a hallucinogenic, entheogenic, or psychedelic effect. The &quot;cojóbana&quot; tree is believed by some to be &quot;Anadenanthera peregrina&quot; although it may have been a generalized term for psychotropics, including the quite toxic &quot;Datura&quot; and related genera (Solanaceae). The corresponding ceremony using &quot;cohoba&quot;-laced tobacco is transliterated as &quot;cojibá&quot;. This was said to have produced the sense of a visionary journey of the kind associated with the practice of shamanism.

The practice of snuffing &quot;cohoba&quot; was popular with the Taíno and Arawakan peoples, with whom Christopher Columbus made contact. However, the use of &quot;Anadenanthera&quot; spp. powder was widespread in South America, being used in ancient times by the Wari culture and Tiwanaku people of Peru and Bolivia and also by the Yanomami people of Brazil and Venezuela. Other names for &quot;cohoba&quot; include &quot;vilca&quot;, &quot;cebíl&quot;, and &quot;yopó&quot;. In Tiwanaku culture, a snuff tray was used along with an inhaling tube.

Fernando Ortiz, the founder of Cuban Cultural Studies, offers a detailed analysis of the use of &quot;cohoba&quot; in his important anthropological work, &quot;&quot;.

== History ==
Cohoba is also known as yopo. Historically, this narcotic snuff was prepared and used by the indigenous people living in South America and the natives of the Caribbean. Early accounts of it first appeared during the time of Christopher Columbus&#x27;s exploration, with its first documentation written in 1496 by Ramon Pane—who travelled with Columbus in the second voyage. The name of &quot;cohoba&quot; refers to the finely ground, cinnamon-colored snuff itself, as well as the ceremonial practice using it by South American tribes. Cuiva and Piaroa people of Orinocoan descent commonly consume Cohoba. As a part of important shamanistic rituals, cohoba represents identity and sociality.

The blending step of the plant mixture determines the potency of &quot;cohoba,&quot; based on the quality of the ingredients and its preparation. &quot;Cohoba&quot; seeds are harvested once they mature, from October to February, such that &quot;cohoba&quot; can be prepared fresh by shamans throughout the year, when necessary. The bark of the &quot;cohoba&quot; tree is then collected, with its quality judged by the fineness and whiteness of the powdered ash after burning the bark. Meanwhile, the seeds of the &quot;cohoba&quot; plant are pulverized and skillfully blended with the powdered bark ash to create a dough resembling butter. Once the desired texture is achieved, the dough is flattened into a cookie and cooked over a fire. Traditionally, &quot;yopo&quot; is taken by deep inhalation through bifurcated tubes from a special apparatus resembling a slightly deep, concave wooden plate.

== Symptoms ==
Though there are myriad somatic symptoms, ranging from violent sneezing to increased mucus production and bloodshot eyes, &quot;cohoba&quot; is appreciated for the altered, other-worldly state of consciousness it lends to the user. Even though &quot;cohoba&quot; is often snuffed with tobacco, it has pharmacologically intriguing properties distinct from tobacco. The active components in &quot;cohoba&quot; responsible for the hallucinogenic effects are DMT (&quot;N,N-&quot;dimethyltryptamine) and bufotenine (&quot;N,N-&quot;dimethyl-5-hydroxytryptamine). The effects of DMT include kaleidoscopic visions similar to LSD that may lead to scenery hallucinations, accompanied by auditory hallucinations. The psychotic effects derived from bufotenine have been suggested to have resulted from central nervous system activity. Though &quot;cohoba&quot; usage is not as widespread as before, it is still taken up today by various localities of South America for the aforementioned rich, hallucinogenic properties.

<doc id="1027207" wikidata="Q29778" url="?curid=1027207" title="Pay-per-click">
<text>Pay-per-click (PPC) is an internet advertising model used to drive traffic to websites, in which an advertiser pays a publisher (typically a search engine, website owner, or a network of websites) when the ad is clicked. This differs from more traditional advertising, which usually requires upfront payment regardless of engagement.

Pay-per-click is usually associated with first-tier search engines (such as Google Ads, Amazon Advertising, and Microsoft Advertising). With search engines, advertisers typically bid on keyword phrases relevant to their target market and pay when ads (text-based search ads or shopping ads that are a combination of images and text) are clicked. In contrast, content sites commonly charge a fixed price per click rather than use a bidding system.

PPC display advertisements, also known as banner ads, are shown on websites with related content that have agreed to show ads and are typically not pay-per-click advertising, but instead, usually charge on a cost per thousand impressions (CPM).

Social networks such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Reddit, Pinterest, TikTok, and Twitter have also adopted pay-per-click as one of their advertising models. The amount advertisers pay depends on the publisher and is usually driven by two major factors: the quality of the ad, and the maximum bid the advertiser is willing to pay per click measured against its competitors&#x27; bids. In general, the higher the quality of the ad, the lower the cost per click is charged, and vice versa.

However, websites can offer PPC ads. Websites that utilize PPC ads will display an advertisement when a query (keyword or phrase) matches an advertiser&#x27;s keyword list that has been added in different ad groups, or when a content site displays relevant content. Such advertisements are called &quot;sponsored links&quot; or &quot;sponsored ads&quot;, and appear adjacent to, above, or beneath organic results on search engine results pages (SERPs), or anywhere a web developer chooses on a content site.

The PPC advertising model is open to abuse through click fraud, although Google and others have implemented automated systems to guard against abusive clicks by competitors or corrupt web developers.

==Purpose==
Pay-per-click, along with cost per impression (CPM) and cost per order, is used to assess the cost-effectiveness and profitability of internet marketing and drive the cost of running an advertisement campaign as low as possible while retaining set goals. In Cost Per Thousand Impressions (CPM), the advertiser only pays for every 1000 impressions of the ad. Pay-per-click (PPC) has an advantage over cost-per-impression in that it conveys information about how effective the advertising was. Clicks are a way to measure attention and interest. If the main purpose of an ad is to generate a click, or more specifically drive traffic to a destination, then pay-per-click is the preferred metric. The quality and placement of the advertisement will affect click through rates and the resulting total pay-per-click cost.

==Construction==

Cost-per-click (CPC) is calculated by dividing the advertising cost by the number of clicks generated by an advertisement. The basic formula is:

:Cost-per-click ($) = Advertising cost ($) / Ads clicked (#)

There are two primary models for determining pay-per-click: flat-rate and bid-based. In both cases, the advertiser must consider the potential value of a click from a given source. This value is based on the type of individual the advertiser is expecting to receive as a visitor to their website, and what the advertiser can gain from that visit, which is usually short-term or long-term revenue. As with other forms of advertising, targeting is key, and factors that often play into PPC campaigns include the target&#x27;s interest (often defined by a search term they have entered into a search engine or the content of a page that they are browsing), intent (e.g., to purchase or not), location (for geo targeting), a device used (e.g. whether the user is searching from a desktop device or mobile) and the day and time that they are browsing.

===Flat-rate PPC===
In the flat-rate model, the advertiser and publisher agree upon a fixed amount that will be paid for each click. In many cases, the publisher has a rate card that lists the pay-per-click (PPC) within different areas of their website or network. These various amounts are often related to the content on pages, with content that generally attracts more valuable visitors having a higher cost per click than content that attracts less valuable visitors. However, in many cases, advertisers can negotiate lower rates, especially when committing to a long-term or high-value contract.

The flat-rate model is particularly common on comparison shopping engines, which typically publish rate cards. However, these rates are sometimes minimal, and advertisers can pay more for greater visibility. These sites are usually neatly compartmentalized into product or service categories, allowing a high degree of targeting by advertisers. In many cases, the entire core content of these sites is paid ads.

===Bid-based PPC===
The advertiser signs a contract that allows them to compete against other advertisers in a private auction hosted by a publisher or, more commonly, an advertising network. Each advertiser informs the host of the maximum amount that he or she is willing to pay for a given ad spot (often based on a keyword), usually using online tools to do so. The auction plays out in an automated fashion every time a visitor triggers the ad spot.

When the ad spot is part of a search engine results page (SERP), the automated auction takes place whenever a search for the keyword that is being bid upon occurs. All bids for the keyword that targets the searcher&#x27;s Geo-location, the day and time of the search, etc. are then compared, and the winner is determined. All this happens in real-time, therefore this is called real-time-bidding or RTB, and in a fraction of a second. In situations where there are multiple ad spots, a common occurrence on SERPs, there can be multiple winners whose positions on the page are influenced by the amount each has bid and the quality of their ad. The bid and Quality Score are used to give each advertiser&#x27;s advert an ad rank. The ad with the highest ad rank shows up first. The predominant three match types for both Google and Bing are Broad, Exact, and Phrase Match. Google Ads and Bing Ads also offer the Broad Match Modifier type (although Google retired it in July 2021) which differs from broad match in that the keyword must contain the actual keyword terms in any order and doesn&#x27;t include relevant variations of the terms.

In addition to ad spots on SERPs, the major advertising networks allow for contextual ads to be placed on the properties of 3rd-parties with whom they have partnered. These publishers sign up to host ads on behalf of the network. In return, they receive a portion of the ad revenue that the network generates, which can be anywhere from 50% to over 80% of the gross revenue paid by advertisers. These properties are often referred to as a &quot;content network&quot; and the ads on them as &quot;contextual ads&quot; because the ad spots are associated with keywords based on the context of the page on which they are found. In general, ads on content networks have a much lower click-through rate (CTR) and conversion rate (CR) than ads found on SERPs and consequently are less highly valued. Content network properties can include websites, newsletters, and e-mails.

Advertisers pay for every single click they receive, with the actual amount paid based on the amount of bid. It is common practice amongst auction hosts to charge a winning bidder just slightly more (e.g. one penny) than the next highest bidder or the actual amount bid, whichever is lower. This avoids situations where bidders are constantly adjusting their bids by very small amounts to see if they can still win the auction while paying just a little bit less per click.

In order to maximize success and achieve scale, automated bid management systems can be deployed. These systems can be used directly by the advertiser, though they are more commonly used by advertising agencies that offer PPC bid management as a service. These tools generally allow for bid management at scale, with thousands or even millions of PPC bids controlled by a highly automated system. The system generally sets each bid based on the goal that has been set for it, such as maximizing profit, maximizing traffic, getting the very targeted customer at break even, and so forth. The system is usually tied into the advertiser&#x27;s website and fed the results of each click, which then allows it to set bids. The effectiveness of these systems is directly related to the quality and quantity of the performance data that they have to work with — low-traffic ads can lead to a scarcity of data problem that renders many bid management tools useless at worst, or inefficient at best.

As a rule, the contextual advertising system (Google Ads, Yandex.Direct, etc.) uses an auction approach as the advertising payment system.

==History==

Several sites claim to be the first PPC model on the web, with many appearing in the mid-1990s. For example, in 1996, the first known and documented version of a PPC was included in a web directory called Planet Oasis. This was a desktop application featuring links to informational and commercial websites, and it was developed by Ark Interface II, a division of Packard Bell NEC Computers. The initial reactions from commercial companies to Ark Interface II&#x27;s &quot;pay-per-visit&quot; model were skeptical, however. By the end of 1997, over 400 major brands were paying between $.005 to $.25 per click plus a placement fee.

In February 1998 Jeffrey Brewer of Goto.com, a 25-employee startup company (later Overture, now part of Yahoo!), presented a pay per click search engine proof-of-concept to the TED conference in California. This presentation and the events that followed created the PPC advertising system. Credit for the concept of the PPC model is generally given to Idealab and Goto.com founder Bill Gross.

Google started search engine advertising in December 1999. It was not until October 2000 that the AdWords system was introduced, allowing advertisers to create text ads for placement on the Google search engine. However, PPC was only introduced in 2002; until then, advertisements were charged at cost-per-thousand impressions or Cost per mille (CPM). Overture has filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Google, saying the rival search service overstepped its bounds with its ad placement tools.

Although GoTo.com started PPC in 1998, Yahoo! did not start syndicating GoTo.com (later Overture) advertisers until November 2001. Prior to this, Yahoo&#x27;s primary source of SERPs advertising included contextual IAB advertising units (mainly 468x60 display ads). When the syndication contract with Yahoo! was up for renewal in July 2003, Yahoo! announced its intent to acquire Overture for $1.63 billion. Today, companies such as adMarketplace, ValueClick and acknowledge offering PPC services, as an alternative to AdWords and AdCenter.

Among PPC providers, Google Ads (formerly Google AdWords), Microsoft adCenter and Yahoo! Search Marketing had been the three largest network operators, all three operating under a bid-based model. For example, in the year 2014, PPC(AdWords) or online advertising contributed approximately US$45 billion of the total US$66 billion of Google&#x27;s annual revenue In 2010, Yahoo and Microsoft launched their combined effort against Google, and Microsoft&#x27;s Bing began to be the search engine that Yahoo used to provide its search results. Since they joined forces, their PPC platform was renamed AdCenter. Their combined network of third-party sites that allow AdCenter ads to populate banner and text ads on their site is called BingAds.

== PPC Statistics ==

* Customers are 50% more likely to purchase something after clicking a paid ad.
* SMEs spend $108,000 to $120,000 annually on PPC ads.
* 57.5% of users don&#x27;t recognize paid ads when they see them.
*Click bots and fake traffic cost online advertisers $35 Billion

==Legal==

In 2012, Google was initially ruled to have engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct by the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC) in possibly the first legal case of its kind. The ACCC ruled that Google was responsible for the content of its sponsored AdWords ads that had shown links to a car sales website Carsales. The ads had been shown by Google in response to a search for Honda Australia. The ACCC said the ads were deceptive, as they suggested Carsales was connected to the Honda company. The ruling was later overturned when Google appealed to the High Court of Australia. Google was found not liable for the misleading advertisements run through AdWords despite the fact that the ads were served up by Google and created using the company&#x27;s tools.

==Click fraud==

A common concern amongst advertisers is the practice known as &quot;click fraud&quot;. This takes two forms:

#Publishers who illegitimately click on or fraudulently arrange for clicks to be generated on adverts, in order to increase their own publisher revenues. In 2018, the FBI, in partnership with Google and other major industry ad platforms, cracked down on an illegal ad fraud scheme known as &quot;3ve&quot;, which was estimated to have defrauded advertisers several millions of dollars in combined ad costs. The case highlighted the extent of ad fraud; as of 2018, ad fraud annual revenue was on track to be worth more than the illicit drug trade, with over $19 billion estimated to have been stolen by click fraudsters.
#Advertisers who attempt to derail competitors&#x27; adverts, by clicking on them in an effort to raise their competitors&#x27; costs in order to give themselves an unfair advantage in the advertising space. The Google Ads platforms claim to be able to identify such clicks, and label such traffic as &quot;invalid clicks&quot;.

<doc id="1027216" wikidata="Q16827722" url="?curid=1027216" title="Confraternity of Christian Doctrine">
<text>The Confraternity of Christian Doctrine (CCD) is an association established in Rome in 1562 for the purpose of providing religious education. In modern usage, it refers to the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine, Inc., which owns the copyright on the New American Bible Revised Edition, and is a term colloquially used for the catechesis or religious education program of the Catholic Church, normally designed for children. In some Catholic parishes, CCD is called PSR, meaning Parish School of Religion, or SRE, meaning Special Religious Education.

==Background==
In the thirteenth century, the Apostles&#x27; Creed and the Lord&#x27;s Prayer formed the general basis of religious instruction. All the faithful within the Catholic Church were required to know them by heart, and parish priests were commanded to explain them on Sundays and festivals. Eventually, the range of instruction was widened to include the Commandments, the sacraments, and the virtues and vices.

In 1281 the Synod of Lambeth, England, ordered priests to explain these truths of faith four times a year. The Provincial Council of Lavours, France, in 1368, expanded this and commanded priests to give instruction on all Sundays and feast days. This council also published a catechism to serve as a textbook for the clergy in giving instructions in Christian doctrine, which was followed in all the dioceses of Languedoc and Gascony. Similar manuals were published elsewhere.

Partly in response to the challenge to uniformity posed by the Reformation, the Council of Trent stated that church reform must begin with the religious instruction of the young. The Council issued the &quot;Catechismus ad Parochos&quot; and decreed that, throughout the Church, instructions in Christian doctrine should be given on Sundays and festivals.

==History==
In 1536, the Abbot Castellino da Castello had inaugurated a system of Sunday schools in Milan. Around 1560, a wealthy Milanese nobleman, Marco de Sadis-Cusani, having established himself in Rome, was joined by a number of zealous associates, both priests and laymen, and pledged to instruct both children and adults in Christian doctrine. In 1562, Pope Pius IV made the Church of Sant&#x27; Apollinare their central institution; but they also gave instructions in schools, in the streets and lanes, and even in private houses. As the association grew, it divided into two sections: the priests formed themselves into a religious congregation, the &quot;Fathers of Christian Doctrine&quot;, while the laymen remained in the world as &quot;The Confraternity of Christian Doctrine&quot;.

Encouragement from the Holy See was quickly forthcoming. In 1571, Pope Pius V, in the Brief &quot;Ex debito pastoralis officii&quot;, recommended that bishops establish it in every parish. In 1607, Pope Paul V, by the Papal Brief &quot;Ex credito nobis&quot;, erected it into an archconfraternity, with St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome as its headquarters. In 1686, a rescript of the Sacred Congregation of Indulgences urged its establishment wherever possible.
From Rome it spread rapidly over Italy, France and Germany. It found advocates in Robert Bellarmine and Francis de Sales, and Charles Borromeo established it in every parish of his diocese.

Pope Pius X was a strong proponent of CCD. In 1905, in his letter &quot;Acerbo nimis&quot;, he mandated the establishment of the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine (catechism class) in every parish. 
The First Provincial Council of Westminster urged that its members should be used in both Sunday and day-schools.

If the central confraternity in a diocese is affiliated to the Archconfraternity of Santa Maria del Pianto in Rome, all others participate in all the confraternity indulgences.

==Similar groups==
Similar in scope and character to the CCD are the &quot;Pieuses Unions de la Doctrine Chrétienne&quot;, founded by the Sisters of Perpetual Adoration at Brussels in 1851, for giving religious instruction to boys and girls. In Brussels, they were (as of 1913) found in about thirty parishes. In 1894, Pope Leo XIII erected it into an archconfraternity for Belgium.

The &quot;Archconfraternity of Voluntary Catechists&quot; (loosely corresponding to the French &quot;Oeuvre des Catéchismes&quot;) was founded to help parish priests in giving religious instructions to children attending the primary schools in Paris and other parts of France, after these had been laicized. In 1893, Pope Leo XIII gave it the rank of an archconfraternity with power to affiliate all similar confraternities in France. The indulgences granted to all these confraternities are numerous.

In 1902, the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine was established in the Archdiocese of New York by Archbishop Michael A. Corrigan, as proposed by Marion Gurney, who was its first secretary.

==Contemporary usage==
The Confraternity of Christian Doctrine is now commonly referred to by its abbreviation, CCD, or simply as &quot;Catechism&quot;, and provides religious education to Catholic children attending secular schools. Inconsistently, CCD has also been offered under a spectrum of banners and acronyms, but all serve the same parochial function of providing a course of study that has been pre-approved by the diocese as meeting the requirements for children not enrolled in a Catholic school (i.e., public school students) to engage with the sacraments at the same time as their diocese-sponsored peers.

While CCD remains the official shorthand of the institution, occasionally parishes have opted to style their individual program as PSR (Parish School of Religion), SRE (Special Religious Education), and PRP (Parish Religious Program), especially when it occurs as a condensed extended-day summer program. These are merely some examples, and not an exhaustive list.

Similar to children&#x27;s Sunday schools in Protestant churches, CCD education is provided by both members of the clergy and lay staff. Unlike Protestant Sunday programs, CCD does not afford participating children an excuse from the weekend Mass they attend with their family unit, and only in rare occasions is it even offered in conjunction with (i.e., immediately before or after) a weekly Mass. Catholic culture in America often necessitates or at least prefers that instructors hold credentials in education, ministry, or both, in addition to professing that one lives in strict adherence to church teaching and customs. CCD attendance is considered by the Holy See to be vital to children&#x27;s development as Catholics and an important complement to the limited liturgic participation they regularly experience while accompanying their family to church throughout the year. These classes not only educate children about Jesus and the Catholic faith but more practically prepare children to fully participate in adult spiritual life by providing a secure foundation to receive the sacraments of Penance (confession), the Eucharist (Holy Communion), and Confirmation.

Organisations called Confraternity of Christian Doctrine have been established in many countries and organise modern CCD programs.

The Confraternity of Christian Doctrine, Inc. is an affiliate of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops established in 1946 and based in Washington DC, which owns the copyright on the New American Bible Revised Edition, the translation most commonly used in US Catholic churches and incorporated in the lectionary for Mass used in the USA. The organisation operates an international grant-funding programme in conjunction with the Catholic Biblical Association, using royalties to support &quot;Catholic biblical literacy and Catholic biblical interpretation&quot;.

<doc id="1027219" wikidata="Q505887" url="?curid=1027219" title="Rex Warner">
<text>Reginal Ernest Warner (Rex) (9 March 1905 – 24 June 1986) was an English classicist, writer, and translator. He is now probably best remembered for &quot;The Aerodrome&quot; (1941). Warner was described by V. S. Pritchett as &quot;the only outstanding novelist of ideas whom the decade of ideas produced&quot;.

==Biographical sketch==

He was born in Birmingham, England, and brought up mainly in Gloucestershire, the son of the Rev. Frederic Ernest Warner, vicar of Amberley, and his wife Kathleen Luce, daughter of the Rev. John James Luce. He was educated at St. George&#x27;s School in Harpenden and at Wadham College, Oxford, where he associated with W. H. Auden, Cecil Day-Lewis, and Stephen Spender and published in &quot;Oxford Poetry&quot;. He obtained a 1st in Classical Moderations in 1925 and later graduated with a 3rd in English in 1928. He then spent time teaching, some of it in Egypt.

Warner&#x27;s debut story, &quot;Holiday&quot;, appeared in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; in 1930. His first collection, &quot;Poems&quot;, appeared in 1937. His poem, &quot;Arms in Spain&quot;, a satire on German and Italian support for the Spanish Nationalists, has often been reprinted. He was also a contributor to &quot;Left Review&quot;. Warner was a great admirer of Franz Kafka and his fiction was &quot;profoundly influenced&quot; by Kafka&#x27;s work. Warner&#x27;s first three novels all reflect his anti-fascist beliefs; &quot;The Wild Goose Chase&quot; is in part a dystopian fantasy about the overthrow of a tyrannical government in a heroic revolution. His second novel, &quot;The Professor&quot;, published around the time of the Nazi Anschluss, is the story of a liberal academic whose compromises with a repressive government lead eventually to his arrest, imprisonment and murder &quot;while attempting to escape&quot;. Contemporary reviewers saw parallels with the Austrian leaders Engelbert Dollfuss and Kurt Schuschnigg.

Although Warner was initially sympathetic to the Soviet Union, &quot;the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact left him disillusioned with Communism&quot;. &quot;The Aerodrome&quot; is an allegorical novel whose young hero is faced with the disintegration of his certainties about his loved ones, and with a choice between the earthy, animalistic life of his home village and the pure, efficient, emotionally detached life of an airman. &quot;The Times&quot; described &quot;The Aerodrome&quot; as Warner&#x27;s &quot;most perfectly accomplished novel&quot;.
&quot;Why Was I Killed?&quot; (1943) is an afterlife fantasy with an anti-war theme.

Warner then abandoned contemporary allegory in favour of historical novels about Ancient Greece and Rome, including &quot;Imperial Caesar&quot;, for which he was awarded the 1960 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction. &quot;Imperial Caesar&quot; was praised by John Davenport as &quot;delightfully perceptive and funny&quot;, and by Storm Jameson as &quot;brilliant, intelligent, continuously interesting. It has everything.&quot; &quot;The Converts&quot;, a novel about Saint Augustine, reflected Warner&#x27;s own increasing devotion to Christianity. He dedicated it to the Greek poet and diplomat George Seferis.

Warner served in the Home Guard during the Second World War and also worked as a Latin teacher at a Grammar School in Morden as there was a shortage of teachers. From 1945 to 1947 he was in Athens as Director of the British Institute. At that time he became involved in numerous translations of classical Greek and Latin authors. His translation of Thucydides&#x27; &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot; for Penguin Classics sold over a million copies. He also translated &quot;Poems of George Seferis&quot; (1960).

Warner&#x27;s time in Greece coincided with the early stages of the Greek Civil War, which ended with the Greek Communists defeated and suppressed. This formed the background to his book &quot;Men of Stones: A Melodrama&quot; (1949), depicting imprisoned leftists presenting &quot;King Lear&quot; in their prison camp.

In 1961 Warner was appointed Tallman Professor of Classics at Bowdoin College and from 1962 to 1973 he was a professor at the University of Connecticut. While he was in the United States he was interviewed for the book &quot;Authors Take Sides on Vietnam&quot; (1967) and argued for withdrawal from Indochina.

Rex Warner retired to England in 1973 and died in Wallingford, Oxfordshire in 1986.

==Personal life==
Warner was married three times, but to only two women. His first marriage was to Frances Chamier Grove, in 1929. Their marriage ended in divorce and in 1949 Warner married Barbara, Lady Rothschild, formerly the wife of Baron Victor Rothschild. After his second divorce, in 1966, he remarried his first wife. Warner and his wife Frances had three children. He had further children including a daughter Anne, who wrote about the relationship between Warner and her mother (when he was not married) in the book &#x27;The Blind Horse of Corfu&#x27;.

<doc id="1027223" wikidata="Q2065108" url="?curid=1027223" title="Mount Tehama">
<text>Mount Tehama (also called Brokeoff Volcano or Brokeoff Mountain) is an eroded andesitic stratovolcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc and the Cascade Range in Northern California. Part of the Lassen volcanic area, its tallest remnant, Brokeoff Mountain, is itself the second highest peak in Lassen Volcanic National Park and connects to the park&#x27;s highest point, Lassen Peak. Located on the border of Tehama County and Shasta County, Brokeoff&#x27;s peak is the highest point in the former. The hikers that summit this mountain each year are treated to &quot;exceptional&quot; views of Lassen Peak, the Central Valley of California, and many of the park&#x27;s other features. On clear days, Mount Shasta can also be seen in the distance.

Brokeoff Volcano was active from 590,000 to 387,000 years ago, during which period it erupted numerous flows with compositions ranging from basaltic andesite to dacite. At its peak, Brokeoff Volcano reached an estimated height of and had a basal circumference of approximately . At approximately 313,000 years ago volcanism began shifting to the northeast of Brokeoff Volcano, with volcanism currently focused around the modern Lassen Peak. Following the end of volcanism at Brokeoff Volcano, cooling magma beneath the surface continued to drive hot, highly reactive hydrothermal fluids circulating near the central vent of the volcano. These hydrothermal fluids chemically weathered the volcanic rocks near the central vent, making them particularly susceptible to physical erosion. Glaciers and streams were able to rapidly erode the hydrothermally altered rocks near the central vent, creating the deep Mill Canyon and exposing deep into the core of the ancient volcano.

Many of the lava flows along the flanks of Brokeoff Volcano were not as extensively chemically weathered, resulting in the flanks of much of the volcano being preserved. Remnants of the flanks of Brokeoff Volcano include Brokeoff Mountain, Mount Conard, Pilot Pinnacle, Mount Diller, and Diamond Peak.

== History ==
The area near Lassen Peak became a haven for new settlers throughout the 1800s. Wagon trains followed winding trails on the Nobles Emigrant Trail which cut through the Lassen Peak vicinity near Sacramento Valley. One of the main landmarks along this trail was a volcano. Called Lassen Peak after Peter Lassen, a prominent blacksmith and guide who escorted California settlers, the volcano and the area around it were given merit for their gripping volcanic phenomena, which included lava beds and extinct volcanic cones. In May 1907, Lassen Peak was declared a national monument by President Theodore Roosevelt to protect the area for &quot;future generations to study and enjoy&quot;. Roosevelt had been told that the area was actually extinct in terms of eruptive activity. Despite assurance from Native Americans in the area that the mountain was indeed active, settlers continued to think that Lassen Peak was extinct and &quot;dead&quot; and so continued to settle nearby. The natives continued to declare that &quot;one day the mountain would blow itself to pieces&quot;. In May 1914, almost exactly seven years later, the volcano began a large explosive eruption sequence. More than a hundred eruptions of varying size took place over the next seven years, attracting national interest and the designation of national park in 1916.

== Geography and geology ==
The state of California is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of highly active tectonic activity that includes seismicity and volcanism. Brokeoff and the other volcanoes near Lassen Peak were produced by subduction of the oceanic Juan de Fuca Plate under the North American Plate.

Brokeoff Volcano represents the Pleistocene component of the Lassen volcanic complex, an area of active volcanism for more than three million years. It formed during a period of eruptive activity approximately 600,000 years ago on a series of faults; the largest of these eruptions was about 50 times as powerful as the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. During the Pleistocene, constantly renewed lava of andesite flowed from the central vent of the volcano. The eruption of overlapping andesitic lava flows accumulated to build the volcano. By the time it reached its peak size, the volcano was immense, measuring at its base between and wide and more than tall. Activity at Brokeoff lasted for approximately 200,000 years. Eruptions varied from ejection of pyroclastic material to andesitic lava flows built primarily of feldspar, pyroxene, and olivine.

Soon after the formation of Brokeoff, other, smaller volcanoes began to form. Shield volcanoes like Raker Peak, Red Mountain, Prospect Peak, and Mount Harkness appeared. At this point, the Pleistocene was coming to an end. One additional and final vent formed on the northeastern flank of the volcano, erupting glassy dacitic flows. Over time, the volcano became dilapidated from extensive erosion and hydrothermal alteration, and was eroded by creeks and glaciers. Later activity built more than thirty other cones known as the Lassen Domes. Today the most active volcano in the area is Lassen Peak. Other smaller craters younger than 50,000 years are also active.

Brokeoff&#x27;s remains are exposed to the southwest Mount Lassen in Shasta County, California. Sulphur Works, an area known for its sharp, putrid scent, is thought to be the center of the ancient volcano. The central vent of Brokeoff Volcano was located near modern Diamond Peak. 
After volcanism at Brokeoff ended, magmatism became more silicic and began migrating toward Lassen Peak&#x27;s northern flank. The last 400,000 years have seen at least three known flows, parts of which are still on Raker Peak and Mount Conard. A subsequent explosive eruption ejected of material and created a large crater, which was soon covered by lava. Twelve lava domes were built throughout the area and the next period of eruptive activity began. Spanning 50,000 years it ejected to of material and was followed by a third period. At least twelve periods of activity have taken place since Brokeoff formed, consisting of activity including pyroclastic flows, pasty lavas, and additional lava domes. Among the vents built by this activity is Lassen Peak.

== Flora and fauna ==
Near the trailhead at lower elevations, alder thickets are present, as well as incense cedar, red firs, and western white pine. At higher elevations, groups of mountain hemlock and lupines prevail. Eagles and hawks can be frequently noted on high crags, and squirrels and pika live about the mountain.

== Recreation ==
Hiking is especially popular on the mountain during summer. The mountain trail lasts between four and six hours, spans , and offers &quot;exceptional&quot; views of Mount Diller, Lassen Peak, Chaos Crags, and Mount Conard.

Due to the characteristically intermittent eruptions of active volcanoes such as Lassen Peak, there is some threat from the volcanoes of the LVNP. Dacitic explosive eruptions have taken place within the last 50,000 years at Lassen Peak, Chaos Crags, and Sunflower Flat, and effusive eruptions of basalt have occurred at Tumble Buttes, Hat Mountain, and Prospect Peak. Pyroclastic flows and lahars could easily occur near glaciated areas and in river valleys like Hat Creek Valley. In addition to the volcanic hazards that could possibly occur, one volcano did erupt in the 20th century in LVNP: (Lassen Peak). Lassen&#x27;s eruptions (1914–21, though most activity occurred between 1914 and 1917) were very small compared to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.

<doc id="1027229" wikidata="Q811591" url="?curid=1027229" title="Method of analytic tableaux">
<text>In proof theory, the semantic tableau (; plural: tableaux), also called an analytic tableau, truth tree, or simply tree, is a decision procedure for sentential and related logics, and a proof procedure for formulae of first-order logic. An analytic tableau is a tree structure computed for a logical formula, having at each node a subformula of the original formula to be proved or refuted. Computation constructs this tree and uses it to prove or refute the whole formula. The tableau method can also determine the satisfiability of finite sets of formulas of various logics. It is the most popular proof procedure for modal logics.

A method of truth trees contains a fixed set of rules for producing trees from a given logical formula, or set of logical formulas. Those trees will have more formulas at each branch, and in some cases, a branch can come to contain both a formula and its negation, which is to say, a contradiction. In that case, the branch is said to close. If every branch in a tree closes, the tree itself is said to close. In virtue of the rules for construction of tableaux, a closed tree is a proof that the original formula, or set of formulas, used to construct it was itself self-contradictory, and therefore false. Conversely, a tableau can also prove that a logical formula is tautologous: if a formula is tautologous, its negation is a contradiction, so a tableau built from its negation will close.

== History ==
In his &quot;Symbolic Logic Part II&quot;, Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (also known by his literary pseudonym, Lewis Carroll) introduced the Method of Trees, the earliest modern use of a truth tree.

The method of semantic tableaux was invented by the Dutch logician Evert Willem Beth (Beth 1955) and simplified, for classical logic, by Raymond Smullyan (Smullyan 1968, 1995). Smullyan&#x27;s simplification, &quot;one-sided tableaux&quot;, is described here. Smullyan&#x27;s method has been generalized to arbitrary many-valued propositional and first-order logics by Walter Carnielli (Carnielli 1987).

Tableaux can be intuitively seen as sequent systems upside-down. This symmetrical relation between tableaux and sequent systems was formally established in (Carnielli 1991).

==Propositional logic==

=== Background ===
A formula in propositional logic consists of letters, which stand for propositions, and connectives for conjunction, disjunction, conditionals, biconditionals, and negation. The truth or falsehood of a proposition is called its truth value. A formula, or set of formulas, is said to be satisfiable if there is a possible assignment of truth-values to the propositional letters such that the entire formula, which combines the letters with connectives, is itself true as well. Such an assignment is said to &quot;satisfy&quot; the formula.

A tableau checks whether a given set of formulae is satisfiable or not. It can be used to check either validity or entailment: a formula is valid if its negation is unsatisfiable, and formulae formula_1 imply formula_2 if formula_3 is unsatisfiable.

The following table shows some notational variants for logical connectives, for readers who may be more familiar with a different notation from the one used here. In general, as of the time of the inclusion of this sentence, the first symbol in each line has been used in the text of this article; however, since Wikipedia editors are not rule-bound to use consistent notation within or between articles, this may change.

=== General method ===
The main principle of propositional tableaux is to attempt to &quot;break&quot; complex formulae into smaller ones until complementary pairs of literals are produced or no further expansion is possible.
The method works on a tree whose nodes are labeled with formulae. At each step, this tree is modified; in the propositional case, the only allowed changes are additions of a node as descendant of a leaf. The procedure starts by generating the tree made of a chain of all formulae in the set to prove unsatisfiability. Then, the following procedure may be repeatedly applied nondeterministically:

# Pick an open leaf node. (The leaf node in the initial chain is marked open).
# Pick an applicable node on the branch above the selected node.
# Apply the applicable node, which corresponds to expanding the tree below the selected leaf node based on some expansion rule (detailed below).
# For every newly created node that is both a literal/negated literal, &quot;and&quot; whose complement appears in a prior node on the same branch, mark the branch as &quot;closed&quot;. Mark all other newly created nodes as &quot;open&quot;.

Eventually, this procedure will terminate, because at some point every applicable node gets applied, and the expansion rules guarantee that every node in the tree is simpler than the applicable node used to create it.

The principle of tableau is that formulae in nodes of the same branch are considered in conjunction while the different branches are considered to be disjuncted. As a result, a tableau is a tree-like representation of a formula that is a disjunction of conjunctions. This formula is equivalent to the set to prove unsatisfiability. The procedure modifies the tableau in such a way that the formula represented by the resulting tableau is equivalent to the original one. One of these conjunctions may contain a pair of complementary literals, in which case that conjunction is proved to be unsatisfiable. If all conjunctions are proved unsatisfiable, the original set of formulae is unsatisfiable.

===And===

Whenever a branch of a tableau contains a formula formula_4 that is the conjunction of two formulae, these two formulae are both consequences of that formula. This fact can be formalized by the following rule for expansion of a tableau:
(formula_5) If a branch of the tableau contains a conjunctive formula formula_4, add to its leaf the chain of two nodes containing the formulae formula_7 and formula_2
This rule is generally written as follows:

:formula_9

A variant of this rule allows a node to contain a set of formulae rather than a single one. In this case, the formulae in this set are considered in conjunction, so one can add formula_10 at the end of a branch containing formula_4. More precisely, if a node on a branch is labeled formula_12, one can add to the branch the new leaf formula_13.

===Or===

If a branch of a tableau contains a formula that is a disjunction of two formulae, such as formula_14, the following rule can be applied:
(formula_15) If a node on a branch contains a disjunctive formula formula_14, then create two sibling children to the leaf of the branch, containing the formulae formula_7 and formula_2, respectively.
This rule splits a branch into two, differing only for the final node. Since branches are considered in disjunction to each other, the two resulting branches are equivalent to the original one, as the disjunction of their non-common nodes is precisely formula_14. The rule for disjunction is generally formally written using the symbol formula_20 for separating the formulae of the two distinct nodes to be created:

:formula_21

If nodes are assumed to contain sets of formulae, this rule is replaced by: if a node is labeled formula_22, a leaf of the branch this node is in can be appended two sibling child nodes labeled formula_23 and formula_24, respectively.

===Not===

The aim of tableaux is to generate progressively simpler formulae until pairs of opposite literals are produced or no other rule can be applied. Negation can be treated by initially making formulae in negation normal form, so that negation only occurs in front of literals. Alternatively, one can use De Morgan&#x27;s laws during the expansion of the tableau, so that for example formula_25 is treated as formula_26. Rules that introduce or remove a pair of negations (such as in formula_27) are also used in this case (otherwise, there would be no way of expanding a formula like formula_28:

:formula_29

:formula_30

===Closure===
Every tableau can be considered as a graphical representation of a formula, which is equivalent to the set the tableau is built from. This formula is as follows: each branch of the tableau represents the conjunction of its formulae; the tableau represents the disjunction of its branches. The expansion rules transforms a tableau into one having an equivalent represented formula. Since the tableau is initialized as a single branch containing the formulae of the input set, all subsequent tableaux obtained from it represent formulae which are equivalent to that set (in the variant where the initial tableau is the single node labeled true, the formulae represented by tableaux are consequences of the original set.)
The method of tableaux works by starting with the initial set of formulae and then adding to the tableau simpler and simpler formulae until contradiction is shown in the simple form of opposite literals. Since the formula represented by a tableau is the disjunction of the formulae represented by its branches, contradiction is obtained when every branch contains a pair of opposite literals.
Once a branch contains a literal and its negation, its corresponding formula is unsatisfiable. As a result, this branch can be now &quot;closed&quot;, as there is no need to further expand it. If all branches of a tableau are closed, the formula represented by the tableau is unsatisfiable; therefore, the original set is unsatisfiable as well. Obtaining a tableau where all branches are closed is a way for proving the unsatisfiability of the original set. In the propositional case, one can also prove that satisfiability is proved by the impossibility of finding a closed tableau, provided that every expansion rule has been applied everywhere it could be applied. In particular, if a tableau contains some open (non-closed) branches and every formula that is not a literal has been used by a rule to generate a new node on every branch the formula is in, the set is satisfiable.

This rule takes into account that a formula may occur in more than one branch (this is the case if there is at least a branching point &quot;below&quot; the node). In this case, the rule for expanding the formula has to be applied so that its conclusion(s) are appended to all of these branches that are still open, before one can conclude that the tableau cannot be further expanded and that the formula is therefore satisfiable.

===Set-labeled tableau===

A variant of tableau is to label nodes with sets of formulae rather than single formulae. In this case, the initial tableau is a single node labeled with the set to be proved satisfiable. The formulae in a set are therefore considered to be in conjunction.

The rules of expansion of the tableau can now work on the leaves of the tableau, ignoring all internal nodes. For conjunction, the rule is based on the equivalence of a set containing a conjunction formula_4 with the set containing both formula_7 and formula_2 in place of it. In particular, if a leaf is labeled with formula_12, a node can be appended to it with label formula_13:

:formula_36

For disjunction, a set formula_37 is equivalent to the disjunction of the two sets formula_38 and formula_39. As a result, if the first set labels a leaf, two children can be appended to it, labeled with the latter two formulae.

:formula_40

Finally, if a set contains both a literal and its negation, this branch can be closed:

:formula_41

A tableau for a given finite set &quot;X&quot; is a finite (upside down) tree with root &quot;X&quot; in which all child nodes are obtained by applying the tableau rules to their parents. A branch in such a tableau is closed if its leaf node contains &quot;closed&quot;. A tableau is closed if all its branches are closed. A tableau is open if at least one branch is not closed.

Below are two closed tableaux for the set 
:formula_42
Each rule application is marked at the right hand side. Both achieve the same effect, the first closes faster. The only difference is the order in which the reduction is performed.

:formula_43
and second, longer one, with the rules applied in a different order:
:formula_44

The first tableau closes after only one rule application while the second one misses the mark and takes a lot longer to close. Clearly, we would prefer to always find the shortest closed tableaux but it can be shown that one single algorithm that finds the shortest closed tableaux for all input sets of formulae cannot exist.

The three rules formula_45, formula_46 and formula_47 given above are then enough to decide if a given set formula_48 of formulae in negated normal form are jointly satisfiable:

Just apply all possible rules in all possible orders until we find a closed tableau for formula_48 or until we exhaust all possibilities and conclude that every tableau for formula_48 is open.

In the first case, formula_48 is jointly unsatisfiable and in the second the case the leaf node of the open branch gives an assignment to the atomic formulae and negated atomic formulae which makes formula_48 jointly satisfiable. Classical logic actually has the rather nice property that we need to investigate only (any) one tableau completely: if it closes then formula_48 is unsatisfiable and if it is open then formula_48 is satisfiable. But this property is not generally enjoyed by other logics.

These rules suffice for all of classical logic by taking an initial set of formulae &quot;X&quot; and replacing each member &quot;C&quot; by its logically equivalent negated normal form &quot;C&#x27; &quot; giving a set of formulae &quot;X&#x27; &quot;. We know that &quot;X&quot; is satisfiable if and only if &quot;X&#x27; &quot; is
satisfiable, so it suffices to search for a closed tableau for &quot;X&#x27; &quot; using the procedure outlined above.

By setting formula_55 we can test whether the formula &quot;A&quot; is a tautology of classical logic: 

If the tableau for formula_56 closes then formula_57 is unsatisfiable and so &quot;A&quot; is a tautology since no assignment of truth values will ever make &quot;A&quot; false. Otherwise any open leaf of any open branch of any open tableau for formula_56 gives an assignment that falsifies &quot;A&quot;. 
===Conditional===
Classical propositional logic usually has a connective to denote material implication. If we write this connective as ⇒, then the formula &quot;A&quot; ⇒ &quot;B&quot; stands for &quot;if &quot;A&quot; then &quot;B&quot;&quot;. It is possible to give a tableau rule for breaking down &quot;A&quot; ⇒ &quot;B&quot; into its constituent formulae. Similarly, we can give one rule each for breaking down each of ¬(&quot;A&quot; ∧ &quot;B&quot;), ¬(&quot;A&quot; ∨ &quot;B&quot;), ¬(¬&quot;A&quot;), and ¬(&quot;A&quot; ⇒ &quot;B&quot;). Together these rules would give a terminating procedure for deciding whether a given set of formulae is simultaneously satisfiable in classical logic since each rule breaks down one formula into its constituents but no rule builds larger formulae out of smaller constituents. Thus we must eventually reach a node that contains only atoms and negations of atoms. If this last node matches (id) then we can close the branch, otherwise it remains open.

But note that the following equivalences hold in classical logic where (...) = (...) means that the left hand side formula is logically equivalent to the right hand side formula:

formula_59

If we start with an arbitrary formula &quot;C&quot; of classical logic, and apply these equivalences repeatedly to replace the left hand sides with the right hand sides in &quot;C&quot;, then we will obtain a formula &quot;C&#x27; &quot; which is logically equivalent to &quot;C&quot; but which has the property that &quot;C&#x27; &quot; contains no implications, and ¬ appears in front of atomic formulae only. Such a formula is said to be in negation normal form and it is possible to prove formally that every formula &quot;C&quot; of classical logic has a logically equivalent formula &quot;C&#x27; &quot; in negation normal form. That is, &quot;C&quot; is satisfiable if and only if &quot;C&#x27; &quot; is satisfiable.

=== Propositional tableau with unification ===
The above rules for propositional tableau can be simplified by using uniform notation. In uniform notation, each formula is either of type formula_60 (alpha) or of type formula_61 (beta). Each formula of type alpha is assigned the two components formula_62, and each formula of type beta is assigned the two components formula_63. Formulae of type alpha can be thought of as being conjunctive, as both formula_64 and formula_65 are implied by formula_66 being true. Formulae of type beta can be thought of as being disjunctive, as either formula_67 or formula_68 is implied by formula_69 being true. The below tables shows how to determine the type, and the components, of any given propositional formula:

formula_70 formula_71

In each table, the left-most column shows all the possible structures for the formulae of type alpha or beta, and the right-most columns show their respective components. Alternatively, the rules for uniform notation can be expressed using signed formulae:

formula_72

When constructing a propositional tableau using the above notation, whenever one encounters a formula of type alpha, its two components formula_73 are added to the current branch that is being expanded. Whenever one encounters a formula of type beta on some branch formula_74, one can split formula_74 into two branches, one with the set {formula_74, formula_67} of formulae, and the other with the set {formula_74, formula_68} of formulae.

==First-order logic tableau==

Tableaux are extended to first-order predicate logic by two rules for dealing with universal and existential quantifiers, respectively. Two different sets of rules can be used; both employ a form of Skolemization for handling existential quantifiers, but differ on the handling of universal quantifiers.

The set of formulae to check for validity is here supposed to contain no free variables; this is not a limitation as free variables are implicitly universally quantified, so universal quantifiers over these variables can be added, resulting in a formula with no free variables.

===First-order tableau without unification===

A first-order formula formula_80 implies all formulae formula_81 where formula_82 is a ground term. The following inference rule is therefore correct:

:formula_83 where formula_82 is an arbitrary ground term

Contrarily to the rules for the propositional connectives, multiple applications of this rule to the same formula may be necessary. As an example, the set formula_85 can only be proved unsatisfiable if both formula_86 and formula_87 are generated from formula_88.

Existential quantifiers are dealt with by means of Skolemization. In particular, a formula with a leading existential quantifier like formula_89 generates its Skolemization formula_90, where formula_91 is a new constant symbol.

:formula_92 where formula_91 is a new constant symbol
The Skolem term formula_91 is a constant (a function of arity 0) because the quantification over formula_95 does not occur within the scope of any universal quantifier. If the original formula contained some universal quantifiers such that the quantification over formula_95 was within their scope, these quantifiers have evidently been removed by the application of the rule for universal quantifiers.

The rule for existential quantifiers introduces new constant symbols. These symbols can be used by the rule for universal quantifiers, so that formula_97 can generate formula_98 even if formula_91 was not in the original formula but is a Skolem constant created by the rule for existential quantifiers.

The above two rules for universal and existential quantifiers are correct, and so are the propositional rules: if a set of formulae generates a closed tableau, this set is unsatisfiable. Completeness can also be proved: if a set of formulae is unsatisfiable, there exists a closed tableau built from it by these rules. However, actually finding such a closed tableau requires a suitable policy of application of rules. Otherwise, an unsatisfiable set can generate an infinite-growing tableau. As an example, the set formula_100 is unsatisfiable, but a closed tableau is never obtained if one unwisely keeps applying the rule for universal quantifiers to formula_88, generating for example formula_102. A closed tableau can always be found by ruling out this and similar &quot;unfair&quot; policies of application of tableau rules.

The rule for universal quantifiers formula_103 is the only non-deterministic rule, as it does not specify which term to instantiate with. Moreover, while the other rules need to be applied only once for each formula and each path the formula is in, this one may require multiple applications. Application of this rule can however be restricted by delaying the application of the rule until no other rule is applicable and by restricting the application of the rule to ground terms that already appear in the path of the tableau. The variant of tableaux with unification shown below aims at solving the problem of non-determinism.

The main problem of tableau without unification is how to choose a ground term formula_82 for the universal quantifier rule. Indeed, every possible ground term can be used, but clearly most of them might be useless for closing the tableau.

A solution to this problem is to &quot;delay&quot; the choice of the term to the time when the consequent of the rule allows closing at least a branch of the tableau. This can be done by using a variable instead of a term, so that formula_80 generates formula_106, and then allowing substitutions to later replace formula_107 with a term. The rule for universal quantifiers becomes:

:formula_108 where formula_107 is a variable not occurring everywhere else in the tableau

While the initial set of formulae is supposed not to contain free variables, a formula of the tableau may contain the free variables generated by this rule. These free variables are implicitly considered universally quantified.

This rule employs a variable instead of a ground term. What is gained by this change is that these variables can be then given a value when a branch of the tableau can be closed, solving the problem of generating terms that might be useless.

As an example, formula_110 can be proved unsatisfiable by first generating formula_111; the negation of this literal is unifiable with formula_112, the most general unifier being the substitution that replaces formula_113 with formula_114; applying this substitution results in replacing formula_111 with formula_86, which closes the tableau.
This rule closes at least a branch of the tableau—the one containing the considered pair of literals. However, the substitution has to be applied to the whole tableau, not only on these two literals. This is expressed by saying that the free variables of the tableau are &quot;rigid&quot;: if an occurrence of a variable is replaced by something else, all other occurrences of the same variable must be replaced in the same way. Formally, the free variables are (implicitly) universally quantified and all formulae of the tableau are within the scope of these quantifiers.

Existential quantifiers are dealt with by Skolemization. Contrary to the tableau without unification, Skolem terms may not be simple constants. Indeed, formulae in a tableau with unification may contain free variables, which are implicitly considered universally quantified. As a result, a formula like formula_89 may be within the scope of universal quantifiers; if this is the case, the Skolem term is not a simple constant but a term made of a new function symbol and the free variables of the formula.

:formula_118 where formula_119 is a new function symbol and formula_120 the free variables of formula_121
This rule incorporates a simplification over a rule where formula_120 are the free variables of the branch, not of formula_121 alone. This rule can be further simplified by the reuse of a function symbol if it has already been used in a formula that is identical to formula_121 up to variable renaming.

The formula represented by a tableau is obtained in a way that is similar to the propositional case, with the additional assumption that free variables are considered universally quantified. As for the propositional case, formulae in each branch are conjoined and the resulting formulae are disjoined. In addition, all free variables of the resulting formula are universally quantified. All these quantifiers have the whole formula in their scope. In other words, if formula_125 is the formula obtained by disjoining the conjunction of the formulae in each branch, and formula_120 are the free variables in it, then formula_127 is the formula represented by the tableau. The following considerations apply:

* The assumption that free variables are universally quantified is what makes the application of a most general unifier a sound rule: since formula_106 means that formula_129 is true for every possible value of formula_107, then formula_81 is true for the term formula_82 that the most general unifier replaces formula_95 with.
* Free variables in a tableau are rigid: all occurrences of the same variable have to be replaced all with the same term. Every variable can be considered a symbol representing a term that is yet to be decided. This is a consequence of free variables being assumed universally quantified over the whole formula represented by the tableau: if the same variable occurs free in two different nodes, both occurrences are in the scope of the same quantifier. As an example, if the formulae in two nodes are formula_134 and formula_135, where formula_95 is free in both, the formula represented by the tableau is something in the form formula_137. This formula implies that formula_138 is true for any value of formula_95, but does not in general imply formula_140 for two different terms formula_82 and formula_142, as these two terms may in general take different values. This means that formula_95 cannot be replaced by two different terms in formula_134 and formula_135.
* Free variables in a formula to check for validity are also considered universally quantified. However, these variables cannot be left free when building a tableau, because tableau rules works on the converse of the formula but still treats free variables as universally quantified. For example, formula_146 is not valid (it is not true in the model where formula_147, and the interpretation where formula_148). Consequently, formula_149 is satisfiable (it is satisfied by the same model and interpretation). However, a closed tableau could be generated with formula_150 and formula_151, and substituting formula_95 with formula_91 would generate a closure. A correct procedure is to first make universal quantifiers explicit, thus generating formula_154.

The following two variants are also correct.

* Applying to the whole tableau a substitution to the free variables of the tableau is a correct rule, provided that this substitution is free for the formula representing the tableau. In other worlds, applying such a substitution leads to a tableau whose formula is still a consequence of the input set. Using most general unifiers automatically ensures that the condition of freeness for the tableau is met.
* While in general every variable has to be replaced with the same term in the whole tableau, there are some special cases in which this is not necessary.

Tableaux with unification can be proved complete: if a set of formulae is unsatisfiable, it has a tableau-with-unification proof. However, actually finding such a proof may be a difficult problem. Contrarily to the case without unification, applying a substitution can modify the existing part of a tableau; while applying a substitution closes at least a branch, it may make other branches impossible to close (even if the set is unsatisfiable).

A solution to this problem is &quot;delayed instantiation&quot;: no substitution is applied until one that closes all branches at the same time is found. With this variant, a proof for an unsatisfiable set can always be found by a suitable policy of application of the other rules. This method however requires the whole tableau to be kept in memory: the general method closes branches, which can be then discarded, while this variant does not close any branch until the end.

The problem that some tableaux that can be generated are impossible to close even if the set is unsatisfiable is common to other sets of tableau expansion rules: even if some specific sequences of application of these rules allow constructing a closed tableau (if the set is unsatisfiable), some other sequences lead to tableaux that cannot be closed. General solutions for these cases are outlined in the &quot;Searching for a tableau&quot; section.

==Tableau calculi and their properties==

A tableau calculus is a set of rules that allows building and modification of a tableau. Propositional tableau rules, tableau rules without unification, and tableau rules with unification, are all tableau calculi. Some important properties a tableau calculus may or may not possess are completeness, destructiveness, and proof confluence.

A tableau calculus is called complete if it allows building a tableau proof for every given unsatisfiable set of formulae. The tableau calculi mentioned above can be proved complete.

A remarkable difference between tableau with unification and the other two calculi is that the latter two calculi only modify a tableau by adding new nodes to it, while the former one allows substitutions to modify the existing part of the tableau. More generally, tableau calculi are classed as &quot;destructive&quot; or &quot;non-destructive&quot; depending on whether they only add new nodes to tableau or not. Tableau with unification is therefore destructive, while propositional tableau and tableau without unification are non-destructive.

Proof confluence is the property of a tableau calculus being able to obtain a proof for an arbitrary unsatisfiable set from an arbitrary tableau, assuming that this tableau has itself been obtained by applying the rules of the calculus. In other words, in a proof confluent tableau calculus, from an unsatisfiable set one can apply whatever set of rules and still obtain a tableau from which a closed one can be obtained by applying some other rules.

==Proof procedures==

A tableau calculus is simply a set of rules that prescribes how a tableau can be modified. A proof procedure is a method for actually finding a proof (if one exists). In other words, a tableau calculus is a set of rules, while a proof procedure is a policy of application of these rules. Even if a calculus is complete, not every possible choice of application of rules leads to a proof of an unsatisfiable set. For example, formula_155 is unsatisfiable, but both tableaux with unification and tableaux without unification allow the rule for the universal quantifiers to be applied repeatedly to the last formula, while simply applying the rule for disjunction to the third one would directly lead to closure.
For proof procedures, a definition of completeness has been given: a proof procedure is strongly complete if it allows finding a closed tableau for any given unsatisfiable set of formulae. Proof confluence of the underlying calculus is relevant to completeness: proof confluence is the guarantee that a closed tableau can be always generated from an arbitrary partially constructed tableau (if the set is unsatisfiable). Without proof confluence, the application of a &#x27;wrong&#x27; rule may result in the impossibility of making the tableau complete by applying other rules.

Propositional tableaux and tableaux without unification have strongly complete proof procedures. In particular, a complete proof procedure is that of applying the rules in a &quot;fair&quot; way. This is because the only way such calculi cannot generate a closed tableau from an unsatisfiable set is by not applying some applicable rules.

For propositional tableaux, fairness amounts to expanding every formula in every branch. More precisely, for every formula and every branch the formula is in, the rule having the formula as a precondition has been used to expand the branch. A fair proof procedure for propositional tableaux is strongly complete.

For first-order tableaux without unification, the condition of fairness is similar, with the exception that the rule for universal quantifiers might require more than one application. Fairness amounts to expanding every universal quantifier infinitely often. In other words, a fair policy of application of rules cannot keep applying other rules without expanding every universal quantifier in every branch that is still open once in a while.

==Searching for a closed tableau==

If a tableau calculus is complete, every unsatisfiable set of formulae has an associated closed tableau. While this tableau can always be obtained by applying some of the rules of the calculus, the problem of which rules to apply for a given formula still remains. As a result, completeness does not automatically imply the existence of a feasible policy of application of rules that always leads to a closed tableau for every given unsatisfiable set of formulae. While a fair proof procedure is complete for ground tableau and tableau without unification, this is not the case for tableau with unification.
A general solution for this problem is that of searching the space of tableaux until a closed one is found (if any exists, that is, the set is unsatisfiable). In this approach, one starts with an empty tableau and then recursively applies every possible applicable rule. This procedure visits a (implicit) tree whose nodes are labeled with tableaux, and such that the tableau in a node is obtained from the tableau in its parent by applying one of the valid rules.

Since each branch can be infinite, this tree has to be visited breadth-first rather than depth-first. This requires a large amount of space, as the breadth of the tree can grow exponentially. A method that may visit some nodes more than once but works in polynomial space is to visit in a depth-first manner with iterative deepening: one first visits the tree depth first up to a certain depth, then increases the depth and perform the visit again. This particular procedure uses the depth (which is also the number of tableau rules that have been applied) for deciding when to stop at each step. Various other parameters (such as the size of the tableau labeling a node) have been used instead.

===Reducing search===

The size of the search tree depends on the number of (children) tableaux that can be generated from a given (parent) one. Reducing the number of such tableaux therefore reduces the required search.

A way for reducing this number is to disallow the generation of some tableaux based on their internal structure. An example is the condition of regularity: if a branch contains a literal, using an expansion rule that generates the same literal is useless because the branch containing two copies of the literals would have the same set of formulae of the original one. This expansion can be disallowed because if a closed tableau exists, it can be found without it. This restriction is structural because it can be checked by looking at the structure of the tableau to expand only.
Different methods for reducing search disallow the generation of some tableaux on the ground that a closed tableau can still be found by expanding the other ones. These restrictions are called global. As an example of a global restriction, one may employ a rule that specifies which of the open branches is to be expanded. As a result, if a tableau has for example two non-closed branches, the rule specifies which one is to be expanded, disallowing the expansion of the second one. This restriction reduces the search space because one possible choice is now forbidden; completeness is however not harmed, as the second branch will still be expanded if the first one is eventually closed. As an example, a tableau with root formula_156, child formula_157, and two leaves formula_114 and formula_159 can be closed in two ways: applying formula_45 first to formula_114 and then to formula_159, or vice versa. There is clearly no need to follow both possibilities; one may consider only the case in which formula_45 is first applied to formula_114 and disregard the case in which it is first applied to formula_159. This is a global restriction because what allows neglecting this second expansion is the presence of the other tableau, where expansion is applied to formula_114 first and formula_159 afterwards.

==Clause tableaux==

When applied to sets of clauses (rather than of arbitrary formulae), tableaux methods allow for a number of efficiency improvements. A first-order clause is a formula formula_168 that does not contain free variables and such that each formula_169 is a literal. The universal quantifiers are often omitted for clarity, so that for example formula_170 actually means formula_171. Note that, if taken literally, these two formulae are not the same as for satisfiability: rather, the satisfiability formula_170 is the same as that of formula_173. That free variables are universally quantified is not a consequence of the definition of first-order satisfiability; it is rather used as an implicit common assumption when dealing with clauses.

The only expansion rules that are applicable to a clause are formula_103 and formula_46; these two rules can be replaced by their combination without losing completeness. In particular, the following rule corresponds to applying in sequence the rules formula_103 and formula_46 of the first-order calculus with unification.

:formula_178 where formula_179 is obtained by replacing every variable with a new one in formula_180

When the set to be checked for satisfiability is only composed of clauses, this and the unification rules are sufficient to prove unsatisfiability. In other worlds, the tableau calculi composed of formula_181 and formula_182 is complete.

Since the clause expansion rule only generates literals and never new clauses, the clauses to which it can be applied are only clauses of the input set. As a result, the clause expansion rule can be further restricted to the case where the clause is in the input set.

:formula_178 where formula_179 is obtained by replacing every variable with a new one in formula_180, which is a clause of the input set

Since this rule directly exploits the clauses in the input set there is no need to initialize the tableau to the chain of the input clauses. The initial tableau can therefore be initialize with the single node labeled formula_186; this label is often omitted as implicit. As a result of this further simplification, every node of the tableau (apart from the root) is labeled with a literal.
A number of optimizations can be used for clause tableau. These optimization are aimed at reducing the number of possible tableaux to be explored when searching for a closed tableau as described in the &quot;Searching for a closed tableau&quot; section above.

===Connection tableau===

Connection is a condition over tableau that forbids expanding a branch using clauses that are unrelated to the literals that are already in the branch. Connection can be defined in two ways:

; strong connectedness : when expanding a branch, use an input clause only if it contains a literal that can be unified with the negation of the literal in the current leaf
; weak connectedness : allow the use of clauses that contain a literal that unifies with the negation of a literal on the branch

Both conditions apply only to branches consisting not only of the root. The second definition allows for the use of a clause containing a literal that unifies with the negation of a literal in the branch, while the first only further constraint that literal to be in leaf of the current branch.

If clause expansion is restricted by connectedness (either strong or weak), its application produces a tableau in which substitution can applied to one of the new leaves, closing its branch. In particular, this is the leaf containing the literal of the clause that unifies with the negation of a literal in the branch (or the negation of the literal in the parent, in case of strong connection).

Both conditions of connectedness lead to a complete first-order calculus: if a set of clauses is unsatisfiable, it has a closed connected (strongly or weakly) tableau. Such a closed tableau can be found by searching in the space of tableaux as explained in the &quot;Searching for a closed tableau&quot; section. During this search, connectedness eliminates some possible choices of expansion, thus reducing search. In other worlds, while the tableau in a node of the tree can be in general expanded in several different ways, connection may allow only few of them, thus reducing the number of resulting tableaux that need to be further expanded.

This can be seen on the following (propositional) example. The tableau made of a chain formula_187 for the set of clauses formula_188 can be in general expanded using each of the four input clauses, but connection only allows the expansion that uses formula_189. This means that the tree of tableaux has four leaves in general but only one if connectedness is imposed. This means that connectedness leaves only one tableau to try to expand, instead of the four ones to consider in general. In spite of this reduction of choices, the completeness theorem implies that a closed tableau can be found if the set is unsatisfiable.

The connectedness conditions, when applied to the propositional (clausal) case, make the resulting calculus non-confluent. As an example, formula_190 is unsatisfiable, but applying formula_181 to formula_114 generates the chain formula_187, which is not closed and to which no other expansion rule can be applied without violating either strong or weak connectedness. In the case of weak connectedness, confluence holds provided that the clause used for expanding the root is relevant to unsatisfiability, that is, it is contained in a minimally unsatisfiable subset of the set of clauses. Unfortunately, the problem of checking whether a clause meets this condition is itself a hard problem. In spite of non-confluence, a closed tableau can be found using search, as presented in the &quot;Searching for a closed tableau&quot; section above. While search is made necessary, connectedness reduces the possible choices of expansion, thus making search more efficient.

===Regular tableaux===

A tableau is regular if no literal occurs twice in the same branch. Enforcing this condition allows for a reduction of the possible choices of tableau expansion, as the clauses that would generate a non-regular tableau cannot be expanded.

These disallowed expansion steps are however useless. If formula_2 is a branch containing a literal formula_195, and formula_196 is a clause whose expansion violates regularity, then formula_196 contains formula_195. In order to close the tableau, one needs to expand and close, among others, the branch where formula_199, where formula_195 occurs twice. However, the formulae in this branch are exactly the same as the formulae of formula_2 alone. As a result, the same expansion steps that close formula_199 also close formula_2. This means that expanding formula_196 was unnecessary; moreover, if formula_196 contained other literals, its expansion generated other leaves that needed to be closed. In the propositional case, the expansion needed to close these leaves are completely useless; in the first-order case, they may only affect the rest of the tableau because of some unifications; these can however be combined to the substitutions used to close the rest of the tableau.

==Tableaux for modal logics==

In a modal logic, a model comprises a set of &quot;possible worlds&quot;, each one associated to a truth evaluation; an &quot;accessibility relation&quot; specifies when a world is &quot;accessible&quot; from another one. A modal formula may specify not only conditions over a possible world, but also on the ones that are accessible from it. As an example, formula_206 is true in a world if formula_7 is true in all worlds that are accessible from it.

As for propositional logic, tableaux for modal logics are based on recursively breaking formulae into its basic components. Expanding a modal formula may however require stating conditions over different worlds. As an example, if formula_208 is true in a world then there exists a world accessible from it where formula_7 is false. However, one cannot simply add the following rule to the propositional ones.

:formula_210

In propositional tableaux all formulae refer to the same truth evaluation, but the precondition of the rule above holds in one world while the consequence holds in another. Not taking this into account would generate incorrect results. For example, formula formula_211 states that formula_114 is true in the current world and formula_114 is false in a world that is accessible from it. Simply applying formula_45 and the expansion rule above would produce formula_114 and formula_216, but these two formulae should not in general generate a contradiction, as they hold in different worlds. Modal tableaux calculi do contain rules of the kind of the one above, but include mechanisms to avoid the incorrect interaction of formulae referring to different worlds.

Technically, tableaux for modal logics check the satisfiability of a set of formulae: they check whether there exists a model formula_217 and world formula_218 such that the formulae in the set are true in that model and world. In the example above, while formula_114 states the truth of formula_114 in formula_218, the formula formula_222 states the truth of formula_216 in some world formula_224 that is accessible from formula_218 and which may in general be different from formula_218. Tableaux calculi for modal logic take into account that formulae may refer to different worlds.

This fact has an important consequence: formulae that hold in a world may imply conditions over different successors of that world. Unsatisfiability may then be proved from the subset of formulae referring to a single successor. This holds if a world may have more than one successor, which is true for most modal logics. If this is the case, a formula like formula_227 is true if a successor where formula_57 holds exists and a successor where formula_229 holds exists. In the other way around, if one can show unsatisfiability of formula_57 in an arbitrary successor, the formula is proved unsatisfiable without checking for worlds where formula_229 holds. At the same time, if one can show unsatisfiability of formula_229, there is no need to check formula_57. As a result, while there are two possible way to expand formula_227, one of these two ways is always sufficient to prove unsatisfiability if the formula is unsatisfiable. For example, one may expand the tableau by considering an arbitrary world where formula_57 holds. If this expansion leads to unsatisfiability, the original formula is unsatisfiable. However, it is also possible that unsatisfiability cannot be proved this way, and that the world where formula_229 holds should have been considered instead. As a result, one can always prove unsatisfiability by expanding either formula_208 only or formula_238 only; however, if the wrong choice is made the resulting tableau may not be closed. Expanding either subformula leads to tableau calculi that are complete but not proof-confluent. Searching as described in the &quot;Searching for a closed tableau&quot; may therefore be necessary.

Depending on whether the precondition and consequence of a tableau expansion rule refer to the same world or not, the rule is called static or transactional. While rules for propositional connectives are all static, not all rules for modal connectives are transactional: for example, in every modal logic including axiom T, it holds that formula_206 implies formula_7 in the same world. As a result, the relative (modal) tableau expansion rule is static, as both its precondition and consequence refer to the same world.

===Formula-deleting tableau===

A method for avoiding formulae referring to different worlds interacting in the wrong way is to make sure that all formulae of a branch refer to the same world. This condition is initially true as all formulae in the set to be checked for consistency are assumed referring to the same world. When expanding a branch, two situations are possible: either the new formulae refer to the same world as the other one in the branch or not. In the first case, the rule is applied normally. In the second case, all formulae of the branch that do not also hold in the new world are deleted from the branch, and possibly added to all other branches that are still relative to the old world.

As an example, in S5 every formula formula_206 that is true in a world is also true in all accessible worlds (that is, in all accessible worlds both formula_7 and formula_206 are true). Therefore, when applying formula_244, whose consequence holds in a different world, one deletes all formulae from the branch, but can keep all formulae formula_206, as these hold in the new world as well. In order to retain completeness, the deleted formulae are then added to all other branches that still refer to the old world.

===World-labeled tableau===

A different mechanism for ensuring the correct interaction between formulae referring to different worlds is to switch from formulae to labeled formulae: instead of writing formula_7, one would write formula_247 to make it explicit that formula_7 holds in world formula_218.

All propositional expansion rules are adapted to this variant by stating that they all refer to formulae with the same world label. For example, formula_250 generates two nodes labeled with formula_247 and formula_252; a branch is closed only if it contains two opposite literals of the same world, like formula_253 and formula_254; no closure is generated if the two world labels are different, like in formula_253 and formula_256.

A modal expansion rule may have a consequence that refers to different worlds. For example, the rule for formula_208 would be written as follows

:formula_258

The precondition and consequent of this rule refer to worlds formula_218 and formula_224, respectively. The various calculi use different methods for keeping track of the accessibility of the worlds used as labels. Some include pseudo-formulae like formula_261 to denote that formula_224 is accessible from formula_218. Some others use sequences of integers as world labels, this notation implicitly representing the accessibility relation (for example, formula_264 is accessible from formula_265.)

===Set-labeling tableaux===

The problem of interaction between formulae holding in different worlds can be overcome by using set-labeling tableaux. These are trees whose nodes are labeled with sets of formulae; the expansion rules explain how to attach new nodes to a leaf, based only on the label of the leaf (and not on the label of other nodes in the branch).

Tableaux for modal logics are used to verify the satisfiability of a set of modal formulae in a given modal logic. Given a set of formulae formula_266, they check the existence of a model formula_217 and a world formula_218 such that formula_269.

The expansion rules depend on the particular modal logic used. A tableau system for the basic modal logic K can be obtained by adding to the propositional tableau rules the following one:

:formula_270

Intuitively, the precondition of this rule expresses the truth of all formulae formula_1 at all accessible worlds, and truth of formula_229 at some accessible worlds. The consequence of this rule is a formula that must be true at one of those worlds where formula_229 is true.

More technically, modal tableaux methods check the existence of a model formula_217 and a world formula_218 that make set of formulae true. If formula_276 are true in formula_218, there must be a world formula_224 that is accessible from formula_218 and that makes formula_280 true. This rule therefore amounts to deriving a set of formulae that must be satisfied in such formula_224.

While the preconditions formula_276 are assumed satisfied by formula_283, the consequences formula_280 are assumed satisfied in formula_285: same model but possibly different worlds. Set-labeled tableaux do not explicitly keep track of the world where each formula is assumed true: two nodes may or may not refer to the same world. However, the formulae labeling any given node are assumed true at the same world.

As a result of the possibly different worlds where formulae are assumed true, a formula in a node is not automatically valid in all its descendants, as every application of the modal rule corresponds to a move from a world to another one. This condition is automatically captured by set-labeling tableaux, as expansion rules are based only on the leaf where they are applied and not on its ancestors.

Notably, formula_286 does not directly extend to multiple negated boxed formulae such as in formula_287: while there exists an accessible world where formula_288 is false and one in which formula_289 is false, these two worlds are not necessarily the same.

Differently from the propositional rules, formula_286 states conditions over all its preconditions. For example, it cannot be applied to a node labeled by formula_291; while this set is inconsistent and this could be easily proved by applying formula_286, this rule cannot be applied because of formula formula_114, which is not even relevant to inconsistency. Removal of such formulae is made possible by the rule:

:formula_294

The addition of this rule (thinning rule) makes the resulting calculus non-confluent: a tableau for an inconsistent set may be impossible to close, even if a closed tableau for the same set exists.

Rule formula_295 is non-deterministic: the set of formulae to be removed (or to be kept) can be chosen arbitrarily; this creates the problem of choosing a set of formulae to discard that is not so large it makes the resulting set satisfiable and not so small it makes the necessary expansion rules inapplicable. Having a large number of possible choices makes the problem of searching for a closed tableau harder.

This non-determinism can be avoided by restricting the usage of formula_295 so that it is only applied before a modal expansion rule, and so that it only removes the formulae that make that other rule inapplicable. This condition can be also formulated by merging the two rules in a single one. The resulting rule produces the same result as the old one, but implicitly discard all formulae that made the old rule inapplicable. This mechanism for removing formula_295 has been proved to preserve completeness for many modal logics.

Axiom T expresses reflexivity of the accessibility relation: every world is accessible from itself. The corresponding tableau expansion rule is:

:formula_298

This rule relates conditions over the same world: if formula_299 is true in a world, by reflexivity formula_2 is also true &quot;in the same world&quot;. This rule is static, not transactional, as both its precondition and consequent refer to the same world.

This rule copies formula_299 from the precondition to the consequent, in spite of this formula having been &quot;used&quot; to generate formula_2. This is correct, as the considered world is the same, so formula_299 also holds there. This &quot;copying&quot; is necessary in some cases. It is for example necessary to prove the inconsistency of formula_304: the only applicable rules are in order formula_305, from which one is blocked if formula_306 is not copied.

===Auxiliary tableaux===

A different method for dealing with formulae holding in alternate worlds is to start a different tableau for each new world that is introduced in the tableau. For example, formula_208 implies that formula_7 is false in an accessible world, so one starts a new tableau rooted by formula_57. This new tableau is attached to the node of the original tableau where the expansion rule has been applied; a closure of this tableau immediately generates a closure of all branches where that node is, regardless of whether the same node is associated other auxiliary tableaux. The expansion rules for the auxiliary tableaux are the same as for the original one; therefore, an auxiliary tableau can have in turns other (sub-)auxiliary tableaux.

===Global assumptions===

The above modal tableaux establish the consistency of a set of formulae, and can be used for solving the local logical consequence problem. This is the problem of telling whether, for each model formula_217, if formula_7 is true in a world formula_218, then formula_2 is also true in the same world. This is the same as checking whether formula_2 is true in a world of a model, in the assumption that formula_7 is also true in the same world of the same model.

A related problem is the global consequence problem, where the assumption is that a formula (or set of formulae) formula_316 is true in all possible worlds of the model. The problem is that of checking whether, in all models formula_217 where formula_316 is true in all worlds, formula_2 is also true in all worlds.

Local and global assumption differ on models where the assumed formula is true in some worlds but not in others. As an example, formula_320 entails formula_321 globally but not locally. Local entailment does not hold in a model consisting of two worlds making formula_322 and formula_323 true, respectively, and where the second is accessible from the first; in the first world, the assumptions are true but formula_321 is false. This counterexample works because formula_322 can be assumed true in a world and false in another one. If however the same assumption is considered global, formula_326 is not allowed in any world of the model.

These two problems can be combined, so that one can check whether formula_2 is a local consequence of formula_7 under the global assumption formula_316. Tableaux calculi can deal with global assumption by a rule allowing its addition to every node, regardless of the world it refers to.

==Notations==

The following conventions are sometimes used.

===Uniform notation===

When writing tableaux expansion rules, formulae are often denoted using a convention, so that for example is always considered to be formula_330. The following table provides the notation for formulae in propositional, first-order, and modal logic.

Each label in the first column is taken to be either formula in the other columns. An overlined formula such as formula_331 indicates that formula_64 is the negation of whatever formula appears in its place, so that for example in formula formula_333 the subformula formula_64 is the negation of .

Since every label indicates many equivalent formulae, this notation allows writing a single rule for all these equivalent formulae. For example, the conjunction expansion rule is formulated as:

:formula_335

===Signed formulae===

A formula in a tableau is assumed true. Signed tableaux allows stating that a formula is false. This is generally achieved by adding a label to each formula, where the label T indicates formulae assumed true and F those assumed false. A different but equivalent notation is that to write formulae that are assumed true at the left of the node and formulae assumed false at its right.

<text>Sherone Simpson (born 12 August 1984) is a retired Jamaican track and field sprint athlete. She is a gold medalist in the 4 × 100 m relay from the 2004 Olympics and silver medalist in 2005 World Championships and now is the silver medalist in the individual event at the 2008 Summer Olympics, after she tied for second with Kerron Stewart in a photo finish.

On 14 July 2013, Simpson announced that she had tested positive for the drug oxilofrine. In April 2014, the Jamaica Anti-Doping Commission announced that she would be suspended for 18 months over doping charges, expiring in December that year. However, after appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), the suspension was lifted on 14 July 2014.

==Biography==
With her personal best of 10.82 seconds in the 100 m, Simpson is ranked 7th among Jamaican women, behind Elaine Thompson-Herah (10.54), Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (10.60), Shericka Jackson (10.65), Merlene Ottey (10.74), Kerron Stewart (10.75), and Veronica Campbell Brown (10.76). Simpson&#x27;s 200 m personal best of 22.00 seconds ranks her 9th among Jamaican women behind Elaine Thompson-Herah, Merlene Ottey, Grace Jackson, Veronica Campbell-Brown, Juliet Cuthbert, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, Shericka Jackson and Kerron Stewart. She has run this time on two occasions. Simpson is coached by Stephen Francis in Kingston, Jamaica, where she attends the University of Technology. She is also a graduate of Manchester High.

Simpson won the gold medal in the women&#x27;s 200 m at the 2006 Commonwealth Games, beating Olympic champion Veronica Campbell and completing a Jamaican sweep of 100–200 m gold medals. Jamaica also won both sprint hurdles gold medals.

At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing she competed at the 100 m sprint. In her first round heat she placed third behind Yevgeniya Polyakova and Jade Bailey in a time of 11.48 to advance to the second round. There she improved her time to 11.02 seconds to win her heat in front of Muna Lee and Chandra Sturrup. With 11.11 seconds in her semi final race she placed fourth and earned her spot in the Olympic final. In a remarkable race with fellow Jamaican Shelly-Ann Fraser taking the gold, Simpson and Kerron Stewart both finished in 10.98 seconds to share the silver medal and to complete the Jamaican sweep. Together with Fraser, Stewart, Sheri-Ann Brooks, Aleen Bailey and Veronica Campbell-Brown she also took part in the 4 × 100 m relay. In their first round heat (without Simpson and Stewart) they placed first in front of Russia, Germany and China. Their time of 42.24 seconds was the first time overall out of sixteen participating nations. With this result they qualified for the final, in which they replaced Brooks and Bailey with Simpson and Stewart. Eventually they did not finish their race, due to a mistake in the baton exchange.

===Anti-doping rule violation===
On 14 July 2013, Simpson informed that a urine sample she supplied after competing in the Jamaican national championships in June 2013 had tested positive for the banned stimulant oxilofrine, along with Asafa Powell. On 10 April 2014, both athletes received an 18-month suspension from competing, which was set to expire in December that year. However, after appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), both athletes&#x27; suspensions were reduced to six months expiring in December 2014. CAS stated that: &quot;They put forward that the offence committed was minor because it was caused by contamination of the food supplement Epiphany D1 by the banned substance oxilofrine.

<text>Lokakṣema (लोकक्षेम, ) (flourished 147–189) was a Kushan Buddhist monk who travelled to China during the Han dynasty and is one of the first known translators of Mahayana religious texts into any language. 

==Biography==

Details of Lokakṣema&#x27;s life come to us via a short biography by Sengyou (僧祐; pinyin: Sēngyòu; 445–518 CE) and his text &quot;Collected Records concerning the Tripitaka&quot; (出三藏記集 Chu sanzang jìjí, T2145).

The name 婁迦讖 is usually rendered in Sanskrit as Lokakṣema, though this is disputed by some scholars, and variants such as Lokakṣama have been proposed. In particular the character 讖 can be read as &quot;chen&quot; or &quot;chan&quot;. Sengyou refers to him as &quot;Zhīchèn&quot; (). The &quot;Zhī&quot; () prefix added to his Chinese name suggests that Lokaksema was of Yuezhi () ethnicity. He is traditionally said to have been a Kushan, though the Chinese term &quot;Yuezhi&quot; covered a broad area of what is now Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.

Given his background, Lokaksema was very likely to be multilingual and knew various languages including Gandhari Prakrit which was used as the language of religion, administration and commerce in the North Western parts of India. It is speculated however by the scholar, Paul Harrison, that his mother tongue was Bactrian language.

Lokaksema arrived in the Han capital Luoyang toward the end of the reign of Emperor Huan of Han (r.147-168), and between 178 and 189 CE translated a number of Mahayāna Buddhist texts into Chinese.

Lokaksema&#x27;s translation activities, as well as those of the Parthians An Shigao and An Xuan slightly earlier, or his fellow Yuezhi Dharmarakṣa (around 286 CE) illustrate the key role Central Asians had in propagating Buddhism to the countries of East Asia. With the decline and fall of the Han, the empire fell into chaos and Lokakṣema disappears from the historical record so that we do not know the date of his death.

=== Extant translations ===
The editors of the Taishō Tripiṭaka attribute twelve texts to Lokakṣema. These attributions have been studied in detail by Erik Zürcher, Paul Harrison and Jan Nattier, and some have been called into question.

Zürcher considers it reasonably certain that Lokakṣema translated the following:

* T224. 道行般若經. A translation of the &quot;Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot;.
* T280. 佛說兜沙經. &quot;The Scripture on the Tusita Heaven&quot;, part of the proto-Avatamsaka Sutra
* T313. 阿閦佛國經. &quot;Akṣohhya-vyūha&quot;
* T350. 說遺日摩尼寶經. Kaśyapaparivrata
* T418. 般舟三昧經. &quot;Pratyutpanna Samādhi Sūtra&quot;
* T458. 文殊師利問菩薩署經. &quot;Mañjuśrī&#x27;s Inquiry Concerning the Bodhisattva Career&quot;.
* T626. 阿闍世王經. &quot;Ajātaśatru Kaukṛtya Vinodana Sūtra&quot;
* T807. 佛說內藏百寶經. &quot;The Hundred Jewels of the Inner Treasury.&quot;

According to Nattier, Harrison &quot;expresses reservations&quot; concerning the &quot;Akṣohhya-vyūha&quot; (T313), and considers that T418 is the product of revision and does not date from Lokakṣema&#x27;s time.

Conversely, Harrison considers that the following ought to be considered genuine:

* T624 伅真陀羅所問如來三昧經 &quot;Druma-kinnara-rāja-paripṛcchā-sūtra&quot;

A characteristic of Lokakṣema&#x27;s translation style was the extensive transliteration of Indic terms and his retention of India stylistic features such as long sentences. He typically rendered Indic verse as Chinese prose, making no attempt to capture the meter. Based on evidence from Chinese catalogues of texts, Nattier suggests that T224 and T418 are representative of Lokakṣema and might stand as &quot;core texts&quot;, i.e. as representative of his style of translating, although both show some signs of later editing. A second tier of texts—T280, T350, T458, and T807—all strongly resemble Lokakṣema&#x27;s core texts, though with occasional anomalies. T624 and T626 form a third tier with more deviations from the distinctive style of Lokakṣema. If T313 was indeed a translation by Lokakṣema, it has been extensively revised by an unknown editor, though the prose sections are closer to his style than the verse.

=== Lost works ===
Several translations attributed to Lokakṣema have been lost:

* &quot;Shoulengyan jing&quot; (a version of the Suramgama-samādhi-sutra, already lost in Sengyou&#x27;s time)
* &quot;Guangming sanmei jing&quot; &quot;Sutra on the Samadhi of Luminosity&quot;
* &quot;Hu banniehuan jing&quot; &quot;The Hu Parinirvāṇa Sutra&quot;
* &quot;Bo benjing&quot; (&quot;The Original *Puṣya Sutra&quot;)

<doc id="1027240" wikidata="Q271555" url="?curid=1027240" title="Biryani">
<text>Biryani () is a mixed rice dish popular in South Asia, made with rice, meat (chicken, goat, lamb, beef) or seafood (prawns or fish), and spices. To cater to vegetarians, the meat or seafood can be substituted with vegetables or paneer. Sometimes eggs or potatoes are also added.

Biryani is one of the most popular dishes among the South Asian diaspora, although the dish is often associated with the region&#x27;s Muslim population in particular. Similar dishes are also prepared in Iran, Iraq, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia. &quot;Biryani&quot; is the single most-ordered dish on Indian online food ordering and delivery services, and has been labelled as the most popular dish overall in India.
==Etymology==

One theory states that it originated from &quot;birinj&quot; (), the Persian word for rice. Another theory states that it was derived from &quot;biryan&quot; or &quot;beriyan&quot; (), which means &quot;to fry&quot; or &quot;to roast&quot;. It may alternatively be related to the Persian word &quot;bereshtan&quot; () which also means &quot;to roast (onions)&quot;, as the dish is often prepared by flavouring rice with fried onions and meat, besides mild spices.

==Origin==
The exact origin of the dish is uncertain, however, it has been suggested that it originated in Persia. In North India, different varieties of &quot;biryani&quot; developed.

According to the historian Lizzie Collingham, the modern &quot;biryani&quot; developed in the royal kitchens of the Mughal Empire (1526–1857) and is a mix of the native spicy rice dishes of South Asia and the Persian &quot;polao&quot;. Indian restaurateur Kris Dhillon believes that the dish originated in Persia and was brought to South Asia by the Mughals. Salma Hossein, whom the BBC has dubbed the &quot;doyenne of Islamic cooking in India,&quot; shares a similar view, asserting that biryani came to South Asia from Persia even before the Mughal era. Food scholar Pushpesh Pant also challenges the Mughal-origin claim, stating that it originated in Iran and that &quot;there is no evidence that biryani first came to this land with the Mughals. It is far more probable that it travelled with pilgrims and soldier-statesmen of noble descent to the Deccan region in South India&quot;.

Another theory claims that the dish was prepared in South Asia before the first Mughal emperor Babur conquered India. The 16th-century Mughal text &quot;Ain-i-Akbari&quot; makes no distinction between &quot;biryanis&quot; and &quot;pilaf&quot; (or &quot;pulao&quot;): it states that the word &quot;biryani&quot; is of older usage in India. A similar theory, that &quot;biryani&quot; came to India with Timur&#x27;s invasion, appears to be incorrect because there is no record of &quot;biryani&quot; having existed in his native land during that period.

According to Pratibha Karan, who wrote the book &quot;Biryani&quot;, &quot;biryani&quot; is of Mughal origin, derived from &quot;pilaf&quot; varieties brought to the South Asian subcontinent by Arab and Persian traders. She speculates that the &quot;pulao&quot; was an army dish in medieval India. Armies would prepare a one-pot dish of rice with any available red meat. Over time, the dish became &quot;biryani&quot; due to different methods of cooking, with the distinction between &quot;pulao&quot; and &quot;biryani&quot; being arbitrary.

According to Vishwanath Shenoy, the owner of a &quot;biryani&quot; restaurant chain in India, one branch of &quot;biryani&quot; comes from the Mughals, while another was brought by the Arab traders to Malabar in South India.

There are various apocryphal stories dating the invention to Shah Jahan&#x27;s time but Rana Safvi, the distinguished historian, says she could only find a recipe from the later Mughal period, from Bahadur Shah Zafar&#x27;s time. It is not her claim that there was no biryani before that; just that she has not found a recipe. Other historians who have gone through texts say that the first references to biryani only appear around the 18th century.

=== South India ===

Some claim that the dish &quot;oonchoru&quot; as mentioned in Sangam literature, which dates from between 200 BCE and 200 CE, is a predecessor of modern biryani. This dish, which was served to the soldiers of the Chera kings in Kerala, was said to be made of rice, ghee, meat, turmeric, coriander, pepper, and bay leaf.

The spices used in the preparation of South Indian biryanis, such as those used in the Malabar variety, are distinctive to the region and the Western Ghats. These spices are not found in the Middle East, Persia, or North India, underscoring the unique culinary heritage and local ingredients of South Indian biryani.

In South India, where rice is more widely used as a staple food, several distinct varieties of &quot;biryani&quot; emerged from Hyderabad in Telangana, Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh, Mangalore and Bhatkal in Coastal Karnataka, Thalassery in Kerala, as well as Ambur and Chettinad in Tamil Nadu.

=== Difference between biryani and pulao ===

&quot;Pilaf&quot; or &quot;pulao&quot;, as it is known on the Indian subcontinent, is another mixed rice dish popular in the cuisines of the Indian subcontinent, Central Asia, and Middle Eastern cuisine. Opinions differ on the differences between &quot;pulao&quot; and &quot;biryani&quot;, and whether there is actually a difference between the two. 

According to Delhi-based historian Sohail Hashmi, &quot;pulao&quot; tends to be plainer than &quot;biryani&quot;, and consists of meat or vegetables cooked with rice with the bottom layered with potatoes or onions. &quot;Biryani&quot; contains more gravy (or &quot;yakhni&quot;), and is often cooked longer, leaving the meat (and vegetables, if present) more tender, and the rice more flavoured. &quot;Biryani&quot; is also cooked with additional dressings and often would have a light layer of scorched rice at the bottom.

Author Pratibha Karan states that while the terms are often applied arbitrarily, the main distinction is that a &quot;biryani&quot; consists of two layers of rice with a layer of meat (and vegetables, if present) in the middle, while the &quot;pulao&quot; is not layered.

Author Colleen Taylor Sen lists the following distinctions between &quot;biryani&quot; and &quot;pulao&quot;:
* &quot;Biryani&quot; is the primary dish in a meal, while the &quot;pulao&quot; is usually a secondary accompaniment to a larger meal.
* In &quot;biryani&quot;, meat (and vegetables, if present) and rice are cooked separately before being layered and cooked together for the gravy to absorb into the rice. &quot;Pulao&quot; is a single-pot dish: meat (or vegetables) and rice are cooked separately and they are not mixed. However, some other writers have reported &quot;pulao&quot; recipes in which the rice and meat are cooked together and then simmered for dum cooking until the liquid is absorbed.
* &quot;Biryanis&quot; have more complex and stronger spices compared to &quot;pulao&quot;.
:The British-era author Abdul Halim Sharar mentions that &quot;biryani&quot; has a stronger taste of curried rice due to a greater amount of spices.

==Ingredients==
Ingredients for &quot;biryani&quot; are extensive and vary according to the region and the type of meat and vegetables used. Meat (chicken, goat, beef, lamb, prawn or fish) is the prime ingredient with rice. As is common in dishes of South Asia, vegetables are sometimes also used when preparing &quot;biryani&quot;. Corn may be used, depending on the season and availability. Navratan &quot;biryani&quot; tends to use sweeter, richer ingredients such as cashews, sultanas (&quot;kishmish&quot;), and fruits such as apples and pineapples.

The spices and condiments used in biryani may include fennel seeds, &quot;ghee&quot; (clarified butter), nutmeg, mace, pepper, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, coriander, mint, ginger, onions, tomatoes, green chilies, star anise, and garlic. The premium varieties include saffron. Some commercial recipes for biryani also include aromatic essences such as Mitha attar, kewra and rose water. Dried sour prunes (&quot;alu bukhara&quot;) may also be added to the biryani. In &quot;nasi briyani&quot; and other variants made in Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia, typical Southeast Asian spices and aromatics such as pandan leaf may be used alongside typical South Asian spices.

The main ingredient that usually accompanies the spices is chicken, lamb or goat meat; special varieties might use beef or seafood instead. The dish may be served with &quot;dahi chutney&quot; or &quot;raita&quot;, with the sole purpose of them being to soothe the biryani and lower the heat from the spices in the biryani. Other sides include seekh kebab, &quot;Qorma&quot;, curry, a sour dish of aubergine (&quot;brinjal&quot;), boiled eggs, and salad.

== Preparation styles ==
&quot;Biryani&quot; can be cooked using one of two styles/techniques, &quot;pakki&quot; (&quot;cooked&quot;) and &quot;kacchi&quot; (&quot;raw&quot;).
* In a &quot;pakki biryani&quot;, the rice, marinated meat, and any vegetables are partially (&quot;three-quarters&quot;) cooked separately, before being combined into layers in a cooking vessel. Different layers of rice may be treated with different spices (e.g., with dissolved saffron or turmeric to give the rice different colours and flavours). The contents are then baked to complete the cooking and allow the flavours to combine. Alternatively, the components may be fully cooked, and then simply combined by layering before serving.
* In a &quot;kacchi biryani&quot;, layers of raw marinated meat are alternated in layers with wet, pre-soaked, raw rice (which may be treated with different spices as above), and cooked together by baking, or medium-to-low direct heat (typically, for at least an hour). Cooking occurs by a process of steaming from the ingredients&#x27; own moisture: the cooking vessel&#x27;s lid is sealed (traditionally, with a strip of wheat dough) so that steam cannot escape (proper dum pukht).
:A yoghurt-based marinade at the bottom of the cooking pot provides additional flavour and moisture. Potatoes often comprise the bottom layer (a technique also used in Iranian cuisine), because, with their natural moisture content, they brown well with less risk of getting burned accidentally. The lid is not opened until the dish is ready to serve. &quot;Kacchi biryani&quot; is technically much more demanding and time-consuming than &quot;pakki biryani&quot;, for the following reasons:
:* The different ingredients—meat, rice, vegetables—have different cooking times: tender cuts of meat/chicken can be fully cooked well before the rice is done. To prevent this, many &quot;kacchi&quot; recipes use parboiled (semi-cooked) rice rather than raw rice.
:* If direct heat is used, there is a risk that the food layer in contact with the vessel bottom may get burned while the interior&#x27;s contents are still raw. This risk is minimized by sustained baking with moderate heat or very slow cooking on low direct heat. This approach, however, increases cooking time considerably.
:* One method is cooking the dish &quot;blind&quot;, with the cooking vessel sealed, so one cannot monitor the cooking progress—it takes expertise and understanding of the raw foods used, the heat required to cook those raw foods, and how the climate can affect the cooking process. Hence making &quot;kacchi biryani&quot; requires a seasoned hand.

==Varieties==
===On the Indian subcontinent===

There are many types of &quot;biryani&quot;, whose names are often based on their region of origin. For example, Sindhi biryani developed in the Sindh region of what is now Pakistan, and Hyderabadi biryani developed in the city of Hyderabad in South India.

Some have taken the name of the shop that sells it, for example: &quot;Haji Biriyani&quot;, &quot;Haji Nanna Biriyani&quot; in Old Dhaka, &quot;Fakhruddin Biriyani&quot; in Dhaka, Students &quot;biryani&quot; in Karachi, Lucky &quot;biryani&quot; in Bandra, Mumbai and Baghdadi &quot;biryani&quot; in Colaba, Mumbai. &quot;Biryanis&quot; are often specific to the Muslim communities where they originate; they are usually the defining dishes of those communities.

==== Ambur/Vaniyambadi biryani ====
Ambur/Vaniyambadi &quot;biryani&quot; is a variety cooked in the neighboring towns of Ambur and Vaniyambadi in the Tirupattur district of the northeastern part of Tamil Nadu, which houses a high Muslim population. It was introduced during the time of the Nawabs of Arcot who once ruled the area. It is typically made with &quot;jeera samba&quot; rice. Nowadays, it is popular as both Ambur or Vaniyambadi style &quot;biryani&quot; as those are two prominent towns along the popular Bangalore to Chennai highway, where travellers are known to stop for eating.

The Ambur/Vaniyambadi &quot;biryani&quot; is often accompanied by &quot;dhalcha&quot;, a sour &quot;brinjal&quot; curry, and &quot;pachadi&quot; or &quot;raitha&quot; (sliced onions mixed with plain yogurt, tomato, chilies, and salt). It is known to have a distinctive aroma and is considered light on the stomach. The usage of spice is moderate, and curd is used as a gravy base. It also utilizes a higher ratio of meat to rice. Ambur-style &quot;biryani&quot; is popular as a street food all across South India.

==== Bhatkali/Navayathi biryani ====
This is an integral part of the Navayath cuisine and a specialty of Bhatkal, a coastal town in Karnataka. Its origins are traced to the Persian traders who introduced &quot;biryani&quot; along with &quot;kababs&quot; and Indian breads. In Bhatkali &quot;biryani&quot;, the meat is cooked in an onion and green chili-based &quot;masala&quot; and layered with fragrant rice. It has a unique spicy and heady flavour, and the rice is overwhelmingly white with mild streaks of orange. Its variations include beef, goat, chicken, &quot;titar&quot; (partridge), egg, fish, crab, prawn, and vegetable &quot;biryani&quot;.

Though similar to those in Thalassery, this &quot;biryani&quot; differs with lingering after-notes of mashed onions laced with garlic. A few chilies and spices littered with curry leaves lends a unique flavour to Bhatkali &quot;biryani&quot;. No oil is used.

Another variety common among the Navayath mainly involves rice vermicelli being used as a substitute for rice, therefore lending this biryani the name &quot; shayya&quot; or &quot;shayyo&quot; as a result of its use. Like many other recipes, the meat, typically chicken, is first cooked with spices and yoghurt, with the vermicelli and fried onions being added later.

==== Bohri biryani ====
This &quot;biryani&quot;, traditionally made by the Bohri community, is one with a rich history. The Bohris, originally from Yemen, migrated mainly to Gujarat and other parts of India between the 11th and 13th centuries. As a result, the dish incorporates both Yemeni and Gujarati influences. The recipe is typically standard and can vary; although its signature ingredients include crispy potatoes along with even more tomatoes and onions. It is seemingly also a dish in Pakistan. 

==== Chettinad biryani ====
Chettinad &quot;biryani&quot; is famous in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is mostly made using &quot;jeera samba&quot; rice, and is known to have a distinct aroma of spices and &quot;ghee&quot;.This biryani is usually paired with &quot;nenju elumbu kuzhambu&quot;, a spicy and tangy goat meat gravy . The &quot;podi kozhi&quot; is usually topped with fried onions and curry leaves.

==== Degh ki biryani/akhni biryani of Parbhani ====

Degh ki Biryani is a traditional biryani dish made with small cubes of beef or mutton. This biryani is believed to have originated in the Ahmadnagar Sultanate and is particularly famous in Parbhani, a city in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra. It is commonly served at weddings.

The meat is marinated with a blend of spices, including ginger, garlic, red chili powder, cumin, garam masala, fried onions, and curd, enhancing its rich flavor. This biryani is also referred to as &quot;Kachay Gosht ki Biryani&quot; or &quot;Dum Biryani&quot;, as the marinated meat is slow-cooked with fragrant, short-grained rice under &quot;dum&quot; (sealed, slow-cooking method) to enhance its aroma and taste.The dish is cooked on a low flame using the &quot;dum&quot; method, allowing the flavors to infuse deeply, resulting in a rich, aromatic biryani.

==== Delhi biryani ====
The Delhi version of &quot;biryani&quot; developed a unique local flavour as the Mughal kings shifted their political capital to the North Indian city of Delhi. Until the 1950s, most people cooked &quot;biryani&quot; in their home and rarely ate at eateries outside of their homes. Hence, restaurants primarily catered to travellers and merchants. Any region that saw more of these two classes of people nurtured more restaurants, and thus their own versions of &quot;biryani&quot;. This is the reason why most shops that sold &quot;biryani&quot; in Delhi, tended to be near mosques such as Jama Masjid (for travellers) or traditional shopping districts (such as Chandni Chowk).

Each part of Delhi has its own style of biryani, often based on its original purpose, thus giving rise to Nizamuddin &quot;biryani&quot;, Shahjahanabad &quot;biryani&quot;, etc. Nizamuddin &quot;biryani&quot; usually had little expensive meat and spices as it was primarily meant to be made in bulk for offering at the Nizamuddin Dargah shrine and thereafter to be distributed to devotees. A non-&quot;dum&quot; &quot;biryani&quot;, using many green chillies, popularized by the Babu Shahi Bawarchi shops located outside the National Sports Club in Delhi is informally called Babu Shahi &quot;biryani&quot;. Another version of Delhi &quot;biryani&quot; uses &quot;achaar&quot; (pickles) and is called achaari &quot;biryani&quot;.

==== Dhakaiya biryani ====

The city of Dhaka in Bangladesh used to be the capital of Bengal Subah and is known for Dhakaiya Kacchi &quot;Biryani&quot;, a Chevon &quot;Biryani&quot; made with highly seasoned rice and goat meat. The recipe includes: highly seasoned rice, goat meat, mustard oil, garlic, onion, black pepper, saffron, clove, cardamom, cinnamon, salt, lemon, &quot;doi&quot;, peanuts, cream, raisins and a small amount of cheese (either from cows or buffalo). It is accompanied by &quot;borhani&quot;, a salted mint drink made of yogurt, coriander, mint and salt.

Haji &quot;biryani&quot; is a favourite among Bangladeshis living abroad. A recipe was handed down by the founder of one Dhaka restaurant to the next generation. Haji Mohammad Shahed claimed, &quot;I have never changed anything, not even the amount of salt&quot;. Bengali style biryani often includes potatoes.

==== Dindigul biryani ====
The city of Dindigul in Tamil Nadu is noted for its &quot;biryani&quot;, which uses a little curd and lemon juice for a tangy taste.

==== Donne biryani ====
According to some historians, this &quot;biryani&quot; is believed to have originated many centuries back, although the origins are numerous and disputed. One historical account states that back in 1638, Shahaji Bhosale of the Maratha Empire achieved his conquest of Bangalore in Karnataka, and his descendants set up and ran these new establishments called &quot;military hotels&quot;.

Today, the military hotels of Bangalore are well known for selling &quot;biryani&quot; served in dried leaf bowls called donne, in Kannada. Just like many other biryani varieties in South India, it uses the standard short grain &quot;seeraga samba&quot; rice. Along with yogurt and spices, it contains a gravy that is mainly composed of mint, coriander leaves and green chillies, that gives the biryani its signature green colour. To impart a specific taste, the recipe for this biryani usually includes either kapok buds (known as Marathi Moggu) or stone flowers as additional spices. The choice of meat can be either chicken or mutton.

==== Hyderabadi biryani ====

Hyderabadi &quot;biryani&quot; is India&#x27;s most famous &quot;biryani&quot;; some say &quot;biryani&quot; is synonymous with Hyderabad. Hyderabadi &quot;biryani&quot; developed in Hyderabad Subah under the rule of Asaf Jah I, who was first appointed as the governor of Deccan by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. It is made with &quot;basmati&quot; rice, spices and goat meat. Popular variations use chicken instead of goat meat. There are various forms of Hyderabadi &quot;biryani&quot;, such as &quot;kachay gosht ki biryani&quot; or &quot;dum biryani&quot;, where goat meat is marinated and cooked along with the rice. It is left on a slow fire or &quot;dum&quot; for a fragrant and aromatic flavour.

==== Kutchi/Memoni biryani ====
Memoni or Kutchi &quot;biryani&quot; is an extremely spicy variety developed by the Memons of Gujarat-Sindh region in India and Pakistan. It is made with mutton, &quot;dahi&quot;, fried onions, and potatoes, and fewer tomatoes compared to Sindhi &quot;biryani&quot;.

==== Kalyani biryani ====

Kalyani &quot;biryani&quot; is a beef &quot;biryani&quot; from the former state of Hyderabad Deccan. Also known as the &quot;poor man&#x27;s&quot; Hyderabadi &quot;biryani&quot;, Kalyani &quot;biryani&quot; is made from small cubes of buffalo meat or cow meat. 

The meat is flavoured with ginger, garlic, turmeric, red chili, cumin, coriander powder, and lots of onion and tomato. It is first cooked in a thick curry and then cooked along with rice. It is then cooked on &quot;dum&quot; (the Indian method of steaming in a covered pot). It has a distinct flavour of tomatoes, &quot;jeera&quot; and &quot;dhania&quot;. 

Kalyani &quot;biryani&quot; is supposed to have originated in Bidar during the reign of the Kalyani Nawabs, who migrated to Hyderabad in mid 18th century after one of the Nawabs, Ghazanfur Jang married into the Asaf Jahi family uniting their realms. Kalyani &quot;biryani&quot; was served by the Kalyani Nawabs to all of their subjects who came from Bidar to Hyderabad and stayed or visited their &quot;devdi&quot; or noble mansion.

==== Kizhi biryani ====
This variant of &quot;biryani&quot; is well-known to the state of Kerala, and gets its name from the method by which it is prepared. The recipe is considerably different from many others due to its preparation and assemblage. The meat can typically be chicken, fish or &quot;chemmeen&quot; (prawns), depending on the region. Unlike the other methods, the meat is marinated in spices and lemon juice and cooked separately; with the same applying for the rice and gravy. Coconut milk is somewhat used as a signature ingredient to enrich the texture.

The easily distinguishable aspect of this biryani is in its serving. A banana leaf is cut in half and tempered, and the meat, rice and gravy are all placed together in a particular fashion on its surface, involving some herbs and &quot;birista&quot; (fried onions). Additional accompaniments may include eggs and coconut chutney. After assembly, the biryani is wrapped within the leaf and steamed. Due to the manner in which it is cooked and served, this is most likely ideal to be consumed by only one person.

==== Kolkata biryani ====
Calcutta or Kolkata &quot;biryani&quot; evolved from Dhakaiya biryani and the Lucknow style biryani when Awadh&#x27;s last Nawab, Wajid Ali Shah, was exiled in 1856 to the Kolkata suburb of Metiabruz. Shah brought his personal chef with him. Like Dhakaiya biryani, the Kolkata biryani is characterized by the presence of potatoes in it.

==== Lucknow biryani ====
Lucknow was a capital of Awadh Subah. For Lucknow/ awadhi biryani, basmati rice is cooked in ghee with warm, aromatic spices and then layered with a type of meat curry or marinade, sealed, and cooked over low heat until done.

==== Beary Biryani (Mangalorean-style Biryani) ====
Beary Biryani is a specialty of the Beary Muslim community in coastal Karnataka and is also referred to as Mangalorean-style Biryani.This biryani is distinct for its use of green chilies and coconut, giving it a rich, mildly spicy flavor with subtle hints of fennel.The spice blend typically includes nutmeg, mace (&quot;javitri&quot;), fennel seeds, poppy seeds, star anise, almonds, and fresh mint leaves, contributing to its unique aroma and flavor.The rice and meat (mutton, chicken, or beef) are first cooked separately, then layered and slow-cooked together in the &quot;dum&quot; style, allowing the flavors to blend harmoniously.This biryani is popularly served at weddings and family gatherings, making it an integral part of Beary Muslim culinary traditions.
==== MLA Potlam biryani ====
This viral style of &quot;biryani&quot; traces its origins to &quot;The Spicy Venue&quot; restaurant in Hyderabad. The recipe is quite unique and easily distinguishable from every other biryani by appearance. It is composed of a mutton keema and prawn biryani wrapped inside an omurice-style seasoned omelette.

==== Rawther biryani ====

This type of &quot;biryani&quot; is popular in the Palakkad and Coimbatore regions. This was most commonly prepared by Rowther families in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. This type of &quot;biryani&quot; is cooked in a different style. Goat meat is most commonly used and it is entirely different from Malabar &quot;biryani&quot;.

==== Sindhi biryani ====

The exotic and aromatic Sindhi &quot;biryani&quot;, originating in the former Mughal subah based in Thatta is known in Pakistan for its spicy taste, fragrant rice, and delicate meat. Sindhi &quot;biryani&quot; is a beloved staple in food menus of Pakistani and Sindhi cuisine. This &quot;biryani&quot; is prepared with meat and a mixture of basmati rice, vegetables, and various spices.

==== Sofiyani biryani ====
Also known as &quot;safeeda biryani&quot;, this variant of biryani is another with Hyderabadi origins. It was said to have been created for a Nizam who was very fond of biryani but was unable to digest spices. Today, the recipe mainly involves khoya and almond paste as a base along with meat and many other ingredients, albeit with no trace of red chillies or chilli powder, which alludes to the so-called &quot;white&quot; look of this dish. Green chillies may be used as an alternative.

==== Sri Lankan biryani ====

&quot;Biryani&quot; was introduced in the 1900s to Sri Lanka by the Indian Muslims who engaged in trade within the country. In many cases, Sri Lankan &quot;biryani&quot; is spicier than most Indian varieties. Side dishes may include Malay pickle, Cashew curry and Mint sambol.

==== Thalassery biryani ====
Thalassery &quot;biryani&quot; is the variation of &quot;biryani&quot; found in the Indian state of Kerala. It is one of the many dishes of the Kerala Muslim community, and very popular.

The ingredients are chicken with spices and the unique ingredient being the choice of rice, called &quot;khyma&quot;. &quot;Khyma&quot; rice is generally mixed with &quot;ghee&quot;. Although a large number of spices such as mace, cashew nuts, sultana raisins, fennel-cumin seeds, tomatoes, onions, ginger, garlic, shallots, cloves and cinnamon are used, there is only a small amount of chilli (or chili powder) used in its preparation.

As a &quot;pakki&quot; type of &quot;biryani&quot;, the Thalassery biryani uses a small-grained thin (not round) fragrant variety of rice known as &quot;khyma&quot; or &quot;jeerakasala&quot;. The &quot;dum&quot; method of preparation (sealing the lid with dough [&quot;maida&quot;] or cloth and placing red-hot charcoal above the lid) is applied here to avoid scorched rice.

In Kerala, another variety called beef &quot;biryani&quot; is well known.

===Outside the Indian subcontinent===

====Burma====
In Myanmar (Burma), &quot;biryani&quot; is known in Burmese as &quot;danpauk&quot; or &quot;danbauk&quot; (), derived from the Persian term &quot;dum pukht&quot;, which refers to a slow oven cooking technique. &quot;Danbauk&quot; is a mainstay at festive events such as Thingyan, weddings and donation feasts. Given &quot;danbauk&quot;″s South Asian origins, &quot;danbauk&quot; restaurants and chains have traditionally been owned by Muslims, but in recent decades Buddhist entrepreneurs have entered the market.

Featured ingredients include: cashew nuts, yogurt, raisins and peas, chicken, cloves, cinnamon, saffron and bay leaf cooked in long-grain rice. In &quot;danbauk&quot;, chicken specially seasoned with a &quot;danbauk&quot; masala spice mix, is cooked with the rice. &quot;Danbauk&quot; is typically eaten with a number of side dishes, including a fresh salad of sliced onions, julienned cabbage, sliced cucumbers, fermented limes and lemons, fried dried chilies, and soup. In recent decades, &quot;danbauk&quot; restaurants have innovated variations, including &quot;ambrosia&quot; &quot;biryani&quot; (), which features dried fruits and buttered rice.

====West Asia====
In Iraq and in the states of the Persian Gulf, &quot;biryani&quot; (برياني: &quot;biryani&quot;) is usually saffron-based with chicken usually being the meat or poultry of choice. It is popular throughout Iraq, especially in the Kurdistan Region. Most variations also include vermicelli, fried onions, fried potato cubes, almonds, and raisins spread liberally over the rice. Sometimes, a sour/spicy tomato sauce is served on the side (&quot;maraq&quot;).

In Iran, during the Safavid dynasty (1501–1736), a dish called &quot;Beriyan Polo&quot; (Nastaliq script: ) was made with lamb or chicken, marinated overnight—with yogurt, herbs, spices, dried fruits like raisins, prunes or pomegranate seeds—and later cooked in a &quot;tannour&quot; oven, then served with steamed rice.

====Afghan biryani====
A different dish called &quot;biryan&quot; is popular in Afghanistan. &quot;Biryan&quot; traces its origins to the same source as &quot;biryani&quot;, when most of Afghanistan was part of Kabul and Qandahar Subahs and as today sold in Afghanistan as well as in Bhopal, India. &quot;Biryan&quot; is prepared by cooking &quot;gosht&quot; and rice together, but without the additional gravy (&quot;yakhni&quot;) and other condiments that are used in &quot;biryani&quot;. The Delhi-based historian Sohail Hashmi refers to the &quot;biryan&quot; as midway between &quot;pulao&quot; and &quot;biryani&quot;. Afghan &quot;biryani&quot; tends to use much dry fruit such as raisins and lesser amounts of meat, often cut into tiny pieces.

====Indonesia====

&quot;Nasi kebuli&quot; is an Indonesian spicy steamed rice dish cooked in goat meat broth, milk and &quot;ghee&quot;. &quot;Nasi kebuli&quot; is descended from &quot;kabuli palaw&quot; which is an Afghan rice dish, similar to &quot;biryani&quot; served in the Indian subcontinent.

Although Indonesia has authentic &quot;nasi kebuli&quot;, Indonesia also inherited and has local-style of &quot;biryani&quot; which is known as &quot;nasi biryani&quot; or &quot;nasi briyani&quot;. &quot;Nasi biryani&quot; is popular among and often associated as Acehnese, Arab Indonesian, Indian Indonesian and Malay cuisine.

====Malaysia and Singapore====

The Malaysian and Singaporean variety of biryani is called &quot;nasi briyani&quot; or &quot;nasi biryani&quot;. Although authentic styles of biryani from South India are popular, nasi briyani remains the most popular. The key differences between nasi briyani and Indian biryanis are that the meat in nasi briyani is cooked separately from the rice, and there is more curry, sauce, or gravy present in the nasi briyani than in Indian biryanis.

&quot;Nasi briyani&quot; dishes are very popular in Malaysia and Singapore. As an important part of Malaysian and Singaporean Indian cuisines, they are popularized through mamak stalls, hawker centres, and food courts as well as fine dining restaurants.

There are also eateries that sell pork as the main meat of the dish in Singapore.

==== Mauritius ====

&quot;Biryani&quot; dishes are very popular in Mauritius, especially at Muslim weddings and festivities. It is also widely available at street food places. Mauritian biryanis are often accompanied by an achaar (mango pickles), chilies and salads.

====Philippines====
Kapampangan cuisine of the Philippines (often in Pampanga) features a special dish called &quot;nasing biringyi&quot; (chicken saffron rice), resembling the Malaysian &quot;nasi briyani&quot; in both name and form, that is typically prepared only during special occasions such as weddings, family get-togethers or fiestas. It is not a staple of the Filipino diet as it is difficult to prepare compared to other usual dishes. A version that has merged with the Filipino version of the Spanish &quot;paella&quot; is known as &quot;bringhe&quot;.

South Asian and Middle Eastern-styled biryani underwent a surge in popularity in Manila in the 2020s, with both high-end restaurants and working-class eateries serving the dish, popularized by both Indian Filipinos and other South Asians as well as returning Overseas Filipino Workers from the Middle East. Some restaurants adjust recipes to suit Filipino palates.

====South Africa====

In the Cape Malay culture, a variation of &quot;biryani&quot; incorporates lentils as a key ingredient in the dish along with meat (usually beef, chicken, seafood or vegetables). The dish is made by cooking the rice and legumes and meat and gravy separately, then mixing it. Uncommonly, it is made using the &quot;dum&quot;-cooking method. The spices are similar to those used in the original Indian &quot;biryani&quot;.

==== East Africa ====

Variants of biryani exist in the cuisines of Somalia, Kenya, and Tanzania due to centuries of trade between the East African coast and South Asia for centuries, and the more recent migration of Indians to the latter two countries more recently during the British colonial era.

Zanzibar has its own form of biryani characterized by the mixture of East African and Indian spices, as well as influences from Arab cuisine. The meat used is most commonly chicken. This variant is similar to the forms of biryani served in Kenya.

In Somalia, the descendant of biryani is bariis iskukaris. It is served with chicken, goat, beef, lamb, or camel meat, and spiced with the Somali spice mixture &quot;xawaash&quot; and other spices. A unique characteristic of bariis and other Somali dishes is the addition of banana on the side to be mixed with the dish.

====Thailand====

&quot;Biryani&quot; in Thailand is commonly known as &quot;khao mhok&quot; (). It is commonly paired with chicken, beef or even fish and topped with fried garlic. The dish is common in Thai cuisine and is often served with a green sour sauce.

===Similar dishes===
==== Tehari ====
Tehari and tehri are various names for the vegetarian adaptation of Biryani but are mainly classified as pulao. It was developed for the Hindu bookkeepers of the Muslim Nawabs. It is prepared by adding potatoes to the rice, as opposed to the case of biryani, where the rice is added to the meat. In Kashmir, tehari is sold as street food. Tehari became more popular during World War II, when meat prices increased substantially and potatoes became the popular substitute in biryani.

<text>Pingewood is a hamlet in the civil parish of Burghfield, to the south of Reading, in the English county of Berkshire. It lies to the Southwest of Burghfield Bridge

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Pingewood&quot; is thought to derive from the Common Brittonic words corresponding to modern Welsh &quot;penn&quot; (&quot;head, peak, tip or end&quot;) and &quot;coed&quot; (&quot;wood&quot;). When Old English became the dominant language in the area, around the fifth century, Old English-speakers did not understand the meaning and added their own descriptive word &quot;wood&quot; on the end. The principal survey of Celtic place-names in England, by Richard Coates and Andrew Breeze, marks this interpretation as uncertain, however.

==History==
Until 1938, Pingewood was a peaceful little hamlet with country lanes and high hedges. In the centre of the hamlet was Kirton&#x27;s Farm, located at the north end of a road that ran north to south, parallel to the Reading to Basingstoke railway but a little further to the west. There were 13 cottages, with a Church school at the southern end of the road, a large village green with a Coronation seat, and a smallholding called Moore&#x27;s Farm. At both ends of the road, it curved to the east to cross the railway, and there was also a pond by the northern crossing, dug out when the railway bridge was built. Around the copse were more cottages, all being pulled down under a system known as &#x27;quit-rent&#x27;. In one of these lived a woman reputed to be a witch. A little further to the north was Cottage Lane, with farm buildings and cottages.

==Gravel pits==
By 1938 excavation had begun in the gravel pits. Because of the high water table, these pits then filled naturally with water to form Pingewood Lake which covers about . The footpaths vanished, with trees and cowslips, as more land was taken. The school closed in 1958, the farms disappeared - replaced by sailing, water skiing and other water-sports.

In the 1960s, the M4 motorway cut the hamlet in half. Kirtons Farm is now a hotel and Knights Farm is derelict. The original Kirtons Farmhouse was an H-plan building dating from the 16th century, which was subsequently altered in the 18th and 20th centuries. Most of the ground floor is constructed of painted brick, while the first floor is timber framed, with brick infill. Knights Farm dates from the late 18th century, with 19th century additions, and 20th century alterations. It is a 2-storey building with an attic. The land south of Pingewood is a huge landfill.

==Streams and brooks==
Streams and brooks criss-cross the hamlet. To the south, and running west to east, flows The Teg, which joins Burghfield Brook on the south-eastern boundary of the hamlet. Burghfield Brook acts as the boundary for West Berkshire on both sides of the junction, and continues for a short distance to the north-east, where it joins Foudry Brook, a tributary of the River Kennet.

==Haunted house==
Searle&#x27;s Farm is an ancient Tudor building now in the middle of the gravel pits. Legend has it that, sometime in the 19th century, an unmarried serving girl found that she was pregnant and committed suicide by throwing herself from one of the windows. It is said that a soft white light is seen coming from under the door to that room. Several visitors claim to have the same dream while sleeping in the room. A young girl in a flowing white dress is seen at the window, staring out over the surrounding countryside. She is illuminated in a soft white light.

==Plot==
Pebbles, who now works for an ad agency and Bamm-Bamm, who works in a car repair shop, decide to get married after Bamm-Bamm proposes with a poem, in the middle of the street (after Pebbles mistakenly thinks he was trying to dump her when Bamm-Bamm read her a letter that started &quot;Dear Pebbles&quot;). However, Fred loses the family savings when he bets it on his team, the Bedrock Brontos, who go on to lose. Fred tries asking for a raise from Mr. Slate, but is dismissed from his job because of his violent temper.

Fred enlists Barney&#x27;s help in earning more money for the wedding, but they fail, losing Barney&#x27;s money to a real estate con artist and becoming more in debt than before. Meanwhile, Wilma&#x27;s mother Pearl Slaghoople arrives to help with the wedding. Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm decide to elope in Rock Vegas because of their parents&#x27; arguing and fighting. Barney angrily reveals the truth about Fred and Wilma’s nest egg. Wilma, livid at Fred, forces him out of the house. After seeing that even Dino’s mad at him, Fred finally realizes the error of his ways and decides to fix his mistakes. Reconciling with Barney, Wilma, Betty and Pearl, Fred asks Barney to help search for Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm.

Fred and Barney travel to Rock Vegas looking for Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm. They stop at a casino where Barney wins more money. They are attacked by the Wedding Whackers gang after mistaking them for Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm getting married and took a photo of them robbing a newlywed couple. Shortly afterwards they are rescued by Bamm-Bamm for Pebbles. During the chase, the photo of the Wedding Whackers is destroyed, so the four are captured as suspects of being the marriage whackers, along with the real marriage whackers.

While in detainment, Fred reveals all the trouble he has gone through to try to help Pebbles with her wedding ceremony which leads the marriage whackers to confess to their crimes, to the dismay of the Whackers&#x27; mother. Since Barney made a lot of money on his casino wins on the big wheel, they can use it to pay for the wedding, replace their nest eggs and pay off their debts. Fred, Barney, Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm finally reunite with Wilma, Betty and the others. Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm get married, with Fred, Barney, Dino, Wilma and Betty as the happy ones seeing them getting married. Fred gets his job back from Mr Slate and is given a raise after being invited to the wedding. At the end, Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm reveal they are moving to Hollyrock with Barney paying their way with his share of the Rock Vegas winnings, at which Fred gets angry with Barney and they start to fight again.

==Home media==
Cartoon Network, in association with Turner Home Video, released the movie on VHS on January 14, 1997. Then Warner Home Video released it on April 21, 1998, and again in 1999 and 2000, but they are now out of print. On October 9, 2012, Warner Archive released &quot;The Flintstones- I Yabba-Dabba Do!&quot; on DVD in region 1 as part of their Hanna–Barbera Classics Collection. This is a Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) release, available through Warner&#x27;s online store, Amazon.com and Wal-Mart.com.

On August 4, 2020, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment gave it its first wide release as part of the DVD collection &quot;The Flintstones: 2 Movies &amp; 5 Specials.&quot;

==Syndication==
This spinoff movie has aired on Cartoon Network in the 1990s, then ran on Boomerang in the 2000s.

==Sequel==
&quot;Hollyrock-a-Bye Baby&quot; was released in 1993. The sequel is considered very difficult to syndicate after its original broadcast and the attempt at releasing it on home media was delayed until 2012, mainly due to the involved suggestive material relating to child birth. However, it eventually aired on Cartoon Network and Boomerang usually as part of Mother&#x27;s Day special programming in the early 2000s.

<doc id="1027252" wikidata="Q153184" url="?curid=1027252" title="Windows Glyph List 4">
<text>Windows Glyph List 4, or more commonly WGL4 for short, also known as the &quot;Pan-European character set&quot;, is a character repertoire on Microsoft operating systems comprising 657 Unicode characters, two of them for private use. Its purpose is to provide an implementation guideline for producers of fonts for the representation of European natural languages; fonts that provide glyphs for the entire set of characters can claim WGL4 compliance and thus can expect to be compatible with a wide range of software.

, WGL4 characters were the only ones guaranteed to display correctly on Microsoft Windows. More recent versions of Windows display far more glyphs.

Because many fonts are designed to fulfill the WGL4 set, this set of characters is likely to work (display as other than replacement glyphs) on many computer systems. For example, all the non-private-use characters in the table below are likely to display properly, compared to the many missing characters that may be seen in other articles about Unicode.

==Repertoire==
The repertoire, defined by Microsoft, encompasses all the characters found in Windows code pages 1252 (&quot;Windows Western&quot;), 1250 (&quot;Windows Central European&quot;), 1251 (&quot;Windows Cyrillic&quot;), 1253 (&quot;Windows Greek&quot;), 1254 (&quot;Windows Turkish&quot;), and 1257 (&quot;Windows Baltic&quot;), as well as characters from DOS code page 437.

It does not cover the combining diacritics used by Vietnamese-related code page 1258, the Thai letters used in code page 874, Hebrew and Arabic letters covered by code pages 1255 and 1256, or the ideographic characters used by code pages 932, 936, 949 and 950.

It also does not cover the Romanian letters Ș, ș, Ț, and ț (U+0218–B), which were added to several of Microsoft&#x27;s fonts for Windows Vista (long after the WGL4 repertoire was originally defined).

In version 1.5 of the OpenType Specification (May 2008) four Cyrillic characters were added to the WGL4 character set: Ѐ (U+0400), Ѝ (U+040D), ѐ (U+0450) and ѝ (U+045D).

<text>The 1991 CONCACAF Gold Cup was the first edition of the Gold Cup, the soccer championship of North America, Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF), and the eleventh overall CONCACAF tournament. The last time the CONCACAF Championship was held was 1971, from that point on the first-place finishers of World Cup qualifying were considered continental champions.

The tournament was hosted by the United States and played in the Greater Los Angeles area of California at two venues: the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the Rose Bowl. The eight teams were broken up into two groups of four; the top two teams of each group would advance to the semifinals. The Gold Cup was won by the United States, who eliminated Mexico in the semi-finals match, and went on to beat Honduras on penalties after tying them in the final 0–0.

==Qualified teams==
==Venues==
==Squads==

<text>The Rehearsal was a satirical play aimed specifically at John Dryden and generally at the sententious and overly ambitious theatre of the Restoration tragedy. The play was first staged on 7 December 1671 at the Theatre Royal, and published anonymously in 1672, but it is certainly by George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and others. Several people have been suggested as collaborators, including Samuel Butler of &quot;Hudibras&quot; fame, Martin Clifford, and Thomas Sprat, a Royal Society founder and later Bishop of Rochester.

The play concerns a playwright named Bayes attempting to stage a play. The play he is going to put on is made up almost entirely of excerpts of existing &quot;heroic dramas&quot;. The name &quot;Bayes&quot; indicates the poet laureate. The previous poet laureate had been William Davenant, and Davenant did stage spectacles and plays with exceptionally bombastic speeches from the heroes (e.g. &quot;The Siege of Rhodes&quot;). However, the poet laureate at the time of the play was Dryden, and most of the excerpts in the play-within-a-play are liftings from Dryden. In particular, Dryden&#x27;s &quot;The Conquest of Granada&quot;, which had been his most popular play (and the one whose preface had defined &quot;heroic drama&quot;), is the play Buckingham parodies. Dryden had written other heroic drama aside from &quot;The Conquest of Granada.&quot; In fact, he had been so prolific in that vein that Martin Clifford accused him of &quot;stealing from himself.&quot; The reason that &quot;The Conquest of Granada&quot; was such a target, however, is the &quot;Preface&quot; to the printed version of &quot;The Conquest of Granada.&quot; There, Dryden scolds his fellow dramatists for having immoral heroes and low sentiments, and he proposes a new type of theatre, the heroic drama. Buckingham&#x27;s play is, in a sense, the old theatre biting him back. In &quot;The Rehearsal,&quot; a director/author attempts to put on a new play, and he lectures his actors and critics with impossible and absurd instructions on the importance of what they are doing.

&quot;The Rehearsal&quot; infuriated Dryden, and it is not possible to see the satire without some political cause or effect. (Dryden would not forget the satire, and he made Buckingham into the figure of Zimri in his &quot;Absalom and Achitophel&quot;.) However, for readers and viewers what was most delightful was the way that Buckingham effectively punctures the puffed up bombast of Dryden&#x27;s plays. By taking Dryden&#x27;s own words out of context and pasting them together, Buckingham disrupts whatever emotions that might have gone with them originally and exposes their inherent absurdity.

The play is credited with putting an end to heroic drama, but, in the long run, it did not. If &quot;heroic drama&quot; is understood only as the writings of Dryden in an heroic vein, then perhaps &quot;The Rehearsal&quot; was a success. Dryden was unable or unwilling to pursue heroic drama for long after &quot;The Rehearsal&quot; came out. Whether &quot;The Rehearsal&quot; or the she-tragedy made popular by the acting of Elizabeth Barry did it, there &quot;was&quot; a turn away from the Classical heroes of Dryden&#x27;s heroic drama. However, new plays with exaggerated heroes who mouth impossibly high-sounding moral sentiments and accomplish impossibly extravagant actions continued to be written through to the 1740s (see, for example, Henry Carey&#x27;s &quot;Chrononhotonthologos&quot;). In fact, the trend toward absurdly lofty bombast and sentiment was so strong that Richard Brinsley Sheridan reworked &quot;The Rehearsal&quot; for his play, &quot;The Critic&quot; (1779), where the target was the inflated importance and prose of theatre criticism. To some degree, the parodic form of a play-within-a-play goes back to Shakespeare&#x27;s satire of pantomime plays in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and forward to the contemporary Mel Brooks film (and later stage musical) &quot;The Producers&quot;.

Eighteenth-century editions of &quot;The Rehearsal&quot; contained a Key that identified the Restoration plays to which Buckingham and his collaborators allude in their work. The Key was originally attributed to Buckingham himself, but is actually the work of Morphew Briscoe. Briscoe&#x27;s Key contains some accurate information, but also has deficiencies. Later commentators have worked to improve upon it.

==Plot synopsis==

===Act I, Scene I===

Johnson and Smith, who has just come to the city from the country, meet by chance and begin talking about the new plays that are currently being shown. The author and director of a new play, Bayes, appears and introduces his production to the two men, boasting about the greatness of his work. Lacking inspiration for original material, Bayes steals all of his ideas from different epics and plays of the time, as well as classical authors such as Seneca and Pliny. Wanting to show off his play, he offers to bring Johnson and Smith to a rehearsal.

When the three men arrive at the rehearsal stage, the actors are seen struggling to understand how they should portray their roles. Bayes continually intervenes to explain what&#x27;s going on in the play to Smith and Johnson and also to direct the players.

Because it lacks logic or continuity, Smith constantly asks Bayes about the plot of the play. However, Bayes asserts that Smith doesn&#x27;t understand because he&#x27;s been in the country for too long. Johnson spurs Bayes on, because he wants to see the foolishness of the play and to irritate his close friend Smith.

One proposed prologue or perhaps epilogue of Bayes’ play features the characters Thunder and Lightning, who threaten the audience. The prologue is ludicrous and Smith once again questions Bayes about what&#x27;s happening. Bayes defends himself and the play by stating that it is a &quot;new way of writing.&quot; Because at first he doesn&#x27;t understand that Smith is criticising, Bayes just answers all the questions as if they were purely academic queries and not patronising questions.

===Act II, Scene I===

Bayes introduces his play, and claims that it will begin with two men whispering to one another. The egotistical playwright justifies the whispering on the grounds that they&#x27;re politicians and not supposed to talk about matters of state. We later discover the two men are plotting against the two kings of Brentford, and Bayes wants to foreshadow the future overthrowing of the kings.

===Act II, Scene II===

Two kings enter the stage, hand in hand. They begin speaking of the whispering between the usher and the physician which Smith once again questions, as the kings were not present in the previous scene. Bayes faults the actors by saying they should have entered earlier.

===Act II, Scene III===

Yet another new actor comes out as Prince Pretty-man and immediately falls asleep, allegedly as a symptom of his love for Cloris. A woman actress enters, supposedly Prince Pretty-man&#x27;s love interest, whom he describes as &quot;a blazing comet.&quot; Prince Pretty-man falls asleep again, then suddenly awakes, declaring &quot;it&quot; is resolved. No one is sure, other than Bayes, what &quot;it&quot; is. When questioned, Bayes declares that this is the new style of writing, where one doesn&#x27;t need to explain oneself.

===Act II, Scene IV===

The whispering conspirators return, apprehensive that their whispers from the opening scene were overheard. This scene, according to Bayes, is meant to show the audience how businessmen ought to discuss business. In light of their predicament, the two actors pull out their swords and claim the two thrones; somehow this indicates that these two men have overthrown the kings and are now the new kings. They exit triumphantly.

===Act II, Scene V===

Four actor-soldiers enter and kill one another. Despite their deaths, they are expected to stand up and perform a difficult dance. Bayes offers abusive criticism on their dancing. The actors complain that they are unable to dance to this music, since it begins fast and ends slow. Bayes attempts to show them how it&#x27;s done, but falls on his face, breaking his nose.

===Act III, Scene I===

Act III begins after Bayes&#x27;s injury from his previous fall, whereupon he tells Johnson and Smith he plans to end every act with a dance. Bayes then continues to describe his style of writing, adding that some scenes of his play might be entirely unnecessary to the plot, but are full of &quot;Wit&quot; and are very popular in the &quot;new style&quot; of writing. In fact, the further the play continues, the less sense it makes, and the more Bayes defends it. Discussion continues to include Bayes&#x27; approval of such devices as &quot;songs, ghosts, and dances,&quot; as a way of filling the theatre seats. Finally, Bayes calls his play a &quot;Touch-stone,&quot; and says he will be able to judge the character of any man by observing his reaction to the play.

===Act III, Scene II===

Scene 2 of the play includes 3 major plot developments: the mysterious death, the fisherman/prince conundrum, and the boots/love affair.

The scene begins with the revelation that someone has died; however, exactly who has died is a rather obscure matter. Cordelio enters with a message that is difficult to grasp because all the audience can understand is that someone has died based on one person&#x27;s words from one kingdom through another&#x27;s words, incomprehensible. Smith questions Bayes on the identity of who has died, and Bayes still refuses to reveal the character, even suggesting that &quot;she&quot; may still not be dead.

The supposed killer is a fisherman, whom Prince Pretty-Man had believed was his father. Bayes expects his audience to already know that the Prince was a foundling raised as a son by the fisherman, information that was not given during the earlier scenes of the play. The prince then finds out that he is not actually the fisherman&#x27;s son. He is disturbed by this because he would rather be the son of a fisherman than a bastard.

Prince Volscius falls in love with a barmaid&#x27;s daughter, who ignores his advances. He is putting on his boots while talking about his love and how he feels love sick. He is giving the boot-putting-on process a second meaning. Boot-putting-on process = indecision. Bayes, Johnson, and Smith talk about this dilemma as if it were a real struggle. The scene concludes with a dance to top off the act – Bayes&#x27;s signature.

===Act IV, Scene I===

This scene is centred around a funeral. The funeral is for a new made-up character, Lardella, who drowned at sea. Bayes has created her brother as well, Drawcansir, a fierce warrior-hero in the play who &quot;frights his mistress, snubs up kings, baffles Armies, and does what he will, without regard to good manners, justice or numbers.&quot; (4.1)
Act IV Scene I begins with Bayes’ reading of a letter that he wrote from Lardella as her final words, to be written to her cousin, the King. This final note is a ridiculous metaphor comparing herself to a &quot;humble bee&quot; forever to buzz around in the after-life, essentially haunting the king for the rest of his life. The two usurpers both loved Lardella, and are determined to stab themselves rather than live without her. However, Pallas intervenes and informs them that Lardella is actually alive and they should have a banquet in place of the funeral. To add to the ridiculous scene, Pallas presents a lance full of wine, a pie in her helmet, and a buckler made of cheese. This &quot;nuptial banquet&quot; is then interrupted by Drawcansir&#x27;s arrival. He snatches the usurper&#x27;s bowls of wine, threatening anyone who would try to prevent him: &quot;Who e&#x27;er to gulp one drop of this dares think I&#x27;l stare away his very pow&#x27;r to drink. I drink, I huff, I strut, look big and stare, And all this I can do, because I dare.&quot;

===Act IV Scene II===
Bayes introduces the next scene in which Prince Pretty-Man and Prince Volscius argue because they love two different women. They are arguing over whose woman is better. Bayes keeps interjecting comments about how excellent the lines are. Pretty-Man starts out saying how he wants to talk to Volscius about something. Volscius response that he will listen but there is no way that Pretty-Man&#x27;s love is greater than his. Pretty-Man and Volscius begin to go back and forth arguing about how great their loves are. They declare their loves are so divine that even gods cannot compare. Their comparisons are very extreme and outlandish. Parthenope is the woman that Prince Volscius loves and Cloris is she whom Prince Pretty-Man loves. At the end of the scene the argument is not actually resolved, because Bayes drops his wig. Johnson wonders why the scene is suddenly all in verse in comparison to the rest of the play and Bayes&#x27;s responds that the subject is too lofty for prose. Bayes continues to congratulate himself on the magnificence of his writing.

===Act V===

At the very beginning of Act V Bayes introduces a scene with many characters including the two usurper kings, four cardinals, and two princes, as well as many of the lovers and the two usurper kings. Two cardinals are dressed differently from the others but Bayes won&#x27;t tell them why this is important. Then the scene changes with Bayes bragging about Amaryllis speaking very well about the situation. Amaryllis speaks two words and is then cut off by music. The usurpers that are on the thrones perceive that the real kings are coming, and decide to leave. Then the rightful kings descend on clouds singing, symbolising their divine right to rule. Bayes tries to emphasise the kings’ importance by having them speak in rhyme. However the kings’ speech is garbled nonsense. At the end of the speech, fiddlers come out and the kings say they are going to play a coranto. Meanwhile, the fiddlers play a totally irrelevant song. Smith points out that the way the kings are speaking is just confusing. Bayes defends himself by explaining they need to speak in rhyme because they came down from the clouds. The kings call for a dance before they discuss &quot;serious counsel.&quot; The kings’ army then arrives to warn thekings that war approaches. The kings pay them, and while Amaryllis is trying to speak again a fight breaks out over the money sent to the army. The kings flee.

At this point Bayes is trying to defend his play from Johnson and Smith. This happens in an interim in acts between the play. They talk about having a fight scene, and Bayes says that there is one coming up. The fight scene is a mockery of fighting because the two actors meant to fight the war each have a lute in one hand and a sword in the other. They carry out their battle in the form of a recitative, each singing of the battle to be fought by huge armies. Bayes says the battle is interrupted by a double eclipse in the form of a dance. Luna is concealed by her veil, like an eclipse, and calls for earth to appear. The sun soon joins them. They dance. Bayes calls an end to the eclipse and another battle ensues. Bayes calls out commands for the battle. The soldiers, some on hobby horses, fight, and one man, Drawcansir, comes in and kills everyone on both sides. Drawcansir then has a brief monologue about how good a fighter he is. He has apparently killed thousands of people and he thinks he stronger than other heroes of literature. He exits.

Johnson and Smith suggest that the dead characters cannot be carried offstage, since there is no one to carry them. Bayes finds this ridiculous because they are not actually dead, so he commands the soldiers to just walk off stage because the audiences knows that they are not actually dead, then he steps out to speak to &quot;Mr. Ivory.&quot; Johnson and Smith leave before he returns. Bayes and the players return and Bayes wonders where the men went and goes to find them. One of the actors reads a paper that Bayes left behind that is another bit of &quot;plot.&quot; These actors leave for dinner. Bayes enters again; he couldn&#x27;t find the gentlemen. He then ridicules them for leaving his play early. The stage manager enters, and says that all of the other players have left. Bayes is insulted and starts ranting about how horrible the players are. He says he wants to sell the play to another theatre. He leaves, resolving to take his play with him. Then the remaining players all go to dinner after a short dance.

The epilogue says that there has been no plot to this play. There is also no wit. The remainder is to deplore that plays in that time are ridiculous and nonsensical. The epilogue hopes no more such plays will be written.

<doc id="1027271" wikidata="Q7127418" url="?curid=1027271" title="Palestinian identity">
<text>Prior to the rise of nationalism during the decline of the Ottoman Empire, the term Palestinian referred to any person born in or living in Palestine, regardless of their ethnic, cultural, linguistic, and religious affiliations. During the British Mandate for Palestine, the term &quot;Palestinian&quot; referred to any person legally considered to be a citizen of Mandatory Palestine as defined in the 1925 Citizenship Order. 

Starting from the late 19th-century, the Arabic-speaking people of Palestine have used the term &quot;Palestinian&quot; as one of the endonyms of self-identification, with other terms such as &quot;Arab&quot; and &quot;Palestinian Arab&quot; being more frequent and dominant in usage until recent times. 

After the establishment of the State of Israel during the 1948 Palestine War, the Jews of Mandatory Palestine became known as &quot;Israeli Jews&quot;, having developed a national Jewish identity centered on a Jewish National Homeland in Palestine, derived from a political and ideological movement known as Zionism. By the mid-1950s, the term &quot;Palestinian&quot; has shifted to be a demonym that exclusively refers to the Arabs of former Mandatory Palestine who did not become citizens of the State of Israel, including their descendants, who had developed a distinctly Palestinian-Arab national identity.

In contemporary times, the term &quot;Palestinian&quot; is the national demonym of the Palestinian people. 

==Types and definitions==
===Geographically ===
&quot;Palestinian&quot; may be used as an adjective to describe persons or objects which are related to Palestine. Examples of such usages may include the &quot;Palestinian Talmud&quot;, an alternative name for the Jerusalem Talmud. This was employed by historical authors such as Zosimus describing Palmyrene troops who originated from Palestine in the Crisis of the Third Century, Shams-Al-Din Al-Maqdisi as a term of self-identification in his travels, and Fulcher of Chartres describing the continuous settlement of the Frankish and Orthodox Crusaders. 

===Legally===
During the British Mandate over Palestine, a &quot;Palestinian&quot; could mean any person who was born in or hailed from the region of Palestine or was a citizen of the Mandatory Palestine. The term covered all the inhabitants of the region, including people from Muslim, Christian and Jewish backgrounds, and all ethnicities, including Arabs, the Dom people, Samaritans, Druze, Bedouins and the traditional Jewish communities of Palestine, or Old Yishuv, whose ancestors were already living there prior to the onset of Zionist immigration.

In the aftermath of the 1948 Palestine war and the establishment of the State of Israel, a &quot;Palestinian&quot; tends to refer to individuals from non-Jewish communities born in the West Bank and Gaza, and citizens of the State of Palestine, including the populations of Palestinian refugees living in the wide Middle East and other Palestinian diaspora populations worldwide.

Prior to the establishment of the State of Palestine then an interim government during the Oslo Accords in 1993: the remaining parts of Arab Palestine were occupied by Jordan and Egypt. The people of the West Bank became citizens of the Kingdom of Jordan until its disengagement in 1988, as part of the annexation of the occupied parts which were later renamed as &quot;West Bank of the Jordan River&quot;, while the inhabitants of the Egyptian-occupied Gaza Strip were considered to be citizens of the internationally unrecognized client All-Palestine Government. The residents of the Gaza Strip became stateless after the dissolution of the All-Palestine government. 

In Israel, former Palestinian Jews that acquired Israeli citizenship became Israeli Jews, while non-Jewish Palestinians that acquired Israeli citizenship came to be referred to as Israeli Arabs.

====Palestinian refugees====

UNRWA defines the Palestinian refugees as those whose normal place of residence between June 1946 and May 1948 was in the land that is now Israel, but they went outside during the 1948 war. UNRWA, however, provides aid to Palestinian refugees defined as such, as well as the descendants of those Palestinians. UNRWA does define &quot;Palestinian refugees&quot; to include descendants of &quot;refugees&quot;.

Politically 

The PLO&#x27;s Palestinian National Covenant of 1964 defines a Palestinian as &quot;the Arab citizens who were living permanently in Palestine until 1947, whether they were expelled from there or remained. Whoever is born to a Palestinian Arab father after this date, within Palestine or outside it, is a Palestinian&quot;.

===In Ethnography ===

The word &quot;Palestinian&quot; in Academia is occasionally used as a term rather than a demonym by ethnographers, linguists, theologians, and historians to denote a specific subculture in Palestine. In such context, it covers not only those who have a Palestinian Arab national identity or Jews of Palestine, but also those inhabitants of the Southern Levant as a whole, Including ethnic and religious minorities such as the Druze, the Dom, the Circassians, and the Samaritans, while excluding the Bedouin (who culturally and linguistically group with the Arabian Peninsula)

==Emergence of Palestinian nationality==

The timing and causes behind the emergence of a distinctively Palestinian national consciousness among the Arabs of Palestine are matters of scholarly disagreement. Some argue that it can be traced as far back as the peasants&#x27; revolt in Palestine in 1834 (or even as early as the 17th century), while others argue that it did not emerge until after the Mandatory Palestine period. Legal historian Assaf Likhovski states that the prevailing view is that Palestinian identity originated in the early decades of the 20th century, when an embryonic desire among Palestinians for self-government in the face of generalized fears that Zionism would lead to a Jewish state and the dispossession of the Arab majority crystallised among most editors, Christian and Muslim, of local newspapers. The term itself &quot;Filasṭīnī&quot; was first introduced by Khalīl Beidas in a translation of a Russian work on the Holy Land into Arabic in 1898. After that, its usage gradually spread so that, by 1908, with the loosening of censorship controls under late Ottoman rule, a number of Muslim, Christian and Jewish correspondents writing for newspapers began to use the term with great frequency in referring to the &#x27;Palestinian people&#x27;(&quot;ahl/ahālī Filasṭīn&quot;), &#x27;Palestinians&#x27; (&quot;al-Filasṭīnīyūn&quot;) the &#x27;sons of Palestine(&quot;abnā’ Filasṭīn&quot;) or to &#x27;Palestinian society&#x27;,(&quot;al-mujtama&#x27; al-filasṭīnī&quot;).
Whatever the differing viewpoints over the timing, causal mechanisms, and orientation of Palestinian nationalism, by the early 20th century strong opposition to Zionism and evidence of a burgeoning nationalistic Palestinian identity is found in the content of Arabic-language newspapers in Palestine, such as &quot;Al-Karmil&quot; (est. 1908) and &quot;Filasteen&quot; (est. 1911). Filasteen initially focused its critique of Zionism around the failure of the Ottoman administration to control Jewish immigration and the large influx of foreigners, later exploring the impact of Zionist land-purchases on Palestinian peasants (, &quot;fellahin&quot;), expressing growing concern over land dispossession and its implications for the society at large.

Historian Rashid Khalidi&#x27;s 1997 book &quot;Palestinian Identity: The Construction of Modern National Consciousness&quot; is considered a &quot;foundational text&quot; on the subject. He notes that the archaeological strata that denote the history of Palestine – encompassing the Biblical, Roman, Byzantine, Umayyad, Abbasid, Fatimid, Crusader, Ayyubid, Mamluk and Ottoman periods – form part of the identity of the modern-day Palestinian people, as they have come to understand it over the last century. Noting that Palestinian identity has never been an exclusive one, with &quot;Arabism, religion, and local loyalties&quot; playing an important role, Khalidi cautions against the efforts of some extreme advocates of Palestinian nationalism to &quot;anachronistically&quot; read back into history a nationalist consciousness that is in fact &quot;relatively modern&quot;.

Khalidi argues that the modern national identity of Palestinians has its roots in nationalist discourses that emerged among the peoples of the Ottoman empire in the late 19th century that sharpened following the demarcation of modern nation-state boundaries in the Middle East after World War I. Khalidi also states that although the challenge posed by Zionism played a role in shaping this identity, that &quot;it is a serious mistake to suggest that Palestinian identity emerged mainly as a response to Zionism.&quot;

Conversely, historian James L. Gelvin argues that Palestinian nationalism was a direct reaction to Zionism. In his book &quot;The Israel-Palestine Conflict: One Hundred Years of War&quot; he states that &quot;Palestinian nationalism emerged during the interwar period in response to Zionist immigration and settlement.&quot; Gelvin argues that this fact does not make the Palestinian identity any less legitimate: &quot;The fact that Palestinian nationalism developed later than Zionism and indeed in response to it does not in any way diminish the legitimacy of Palestinian nationalism or make it less valid than Zionism. All nationalisms arise in opposition to some &#x27;other.&#x27; Why else would there be the need to specify who you are? And all nationalisms are defined by what they oppose.&quot;

David Seddon writes that &quot;[t]he creation of Palestinian identity in its contemporary sense was formed essentially during the 1960s, with the creation of the Palestine Liberation Organization.&quot; He adds, however, that &quot;the existence of a population with a recognizably similar name (&#x27;the Philistines&#x27;) in Biblical times suggests a degree of continuity over a long historical period (much as &#x27;the Israelites&#x27; of the Bible suggest a long historical continuity in the same region).&quot;

Baruch Kimmerling and Joel S. Migdal consider the 1834 Peasants&#x27; revolt in Palestine as constituting the first formative event of the Palestinian people. From 1516 to 1917, Palestine was ruled by the Ottoman Empire save a decade from the 1830s to the 1840s when an Egyptian vassal of the Ottomans, Muhammad Ali, and his son Ibrahim Pasha successfully broke away from Ottoman leadership and, conquering territory spreading from Egypt to as far north as Damascus, asserted their own rule over the area. The so-called Peasants&#x27; Revolt by Palestine&#x27;s Arabs was precipitated by heavy demands for conscripts. The local leaders and urban notables were unhappy about the loss of traditional privileges, while the peasants were well aware that conscription was little more than a death sentence. Starting in May 1834 the rebels took many cities, among them Jerusalem, Hebron and Nablus and Ibrahim Pasha&#x27;s army was deployed, defeating the last rebels on 4 August in Hebron. Benny Morris argues that the Arabs in Palestine nevertheless remained part of a larger national pan-Arab or, alternatively, pan-Islamist movement. Walid Khalidi argues otherwise, writing that Palestinians in Ottoman times were &quot;[a]cutely aware of the distinctiveness of Palestinian history ...&quot; and &quot;[a]lthough proud of their Arab heritage and ancestry, the Palestinians considered themselves to be descended not only from Arab conquerors of the seventh century but also from indigenous peoples who had lived in the country since time immemorial, including the ancient Hebrews and the Canaanites before them.&quot;

Zachary J. Foster argued in a 2015 &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; article that &quot;based on hundreds of manuscripts, Islamic court records, books, magazines, and newspapers from the Ottoman period (1516–1918), it seems that the first Arab to use the term &quot;Palestinian&quot; was Farid Georges Kassab, a Beirut-based Orthodox Christian.&quot; He explained further that Kassab&#x27;s 1909 book &quot;Palestine, Hellenism, and Clericalism&quot; noted in passing that &quot;the Orthodox Palestinian Ottomans call themselves Arabs, and are in fact Arabs,&quot; despite describing the Arabic speakers of Palestine as Palestinians throughout the rest of the book.&quot;

Bernard Lewis argues it was not as a Palestinian nation that the Arabs of Ottoman Palestine objected to Zionists, since the very concept of such a nation was unknown to the Arabs of the area at the time and did not come into being until very much later. Even the concept of Arab nationalism in the Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire, &quot;had not reached significant proportions before the outbreak of World War I.&quot; Tamir Sorek, a sociologist, submits that, &quot;Although a distinct Palestinian identity can be traced back at least to the middle of the nineteenth century (Kimmerling and Migdal 1993; Khalidi 1997b), or even to the seventeenth century (Gerber 1998), it was not until after World War I that a broad range of optional &quot;political&quot; affiliations became relevant for the Arabs of Palestine.&quot;

Israeli historian Efraim Karsh takes the view that the Palestinian identity did not develop until after the 1967 war because the Palestinian exodus had fractured society so greatly that it was impossible to piece together a national identity. Between 1948 and 1967, the Jordanians and other Arab countries hosting Arab refugees from Palestine/Israel silenced any expression of Palestinian identity and occupied their lands until Israel&#x27;s conquests of 1967. The formal annexation of the West Bank by Jordan in 1950, and the subsequent granting of its Palestinian residents Jordanian citizenship, further stunted the growth of a Palestinian national identity by integrating them into Jordanian society.

The idea of a unique Palestinian state distinct from its Arab neighbors was at first rejected by Palestinian representatives. The First Congress of Muslim-Christian Associations (in Jerusalem, February 1919), which met for the purpose of selecting a Palestinian Arab representative for the Paris Peace Conference, adopted the following resolution: &quot;We consider Palestine as part of Arab Syria, as it has never been separated from it at any time. We are connected with it by national, religious, linguistic, natural, economic and geographical bonds.&quot;

==Denial of Palestinian identity==

Since the days of early Christian Zionism, Palestinian identity has been the subject of dismissive rhetoric. The phrase &quot;A land without a people for a people without a land&quot; was used as early as 1843 by a Christian Restorationist clergyman, and the phrase continued to be used for almost a century predominantly by Christian Restorationists, and was later adopted as Jewish Zionist slogan, to an extent that historians dispute.

After the inception of the State of Israel, a phrase that has similarly become oft repeated is Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir&#x27;s remark that &quot;There was no such thing as Palestinians. When was there an independent Palestinian people with a Palestinian state? It was either southern Syria before the First World War and then it was a Palestine including Jordan. It was not as though there was a Palestinian people in Palestine considering itself as a Palestinian people and we came and threw them out and took their country from them. They did not exist.&quot; as part of an interview with Frank Giles, then deputy editor of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; on June 15, 1969, to mark the second anniversary of the Six-Day War. It is considered to be the most famous example of Israeli denial of Palestinian identity, and has been frequently been used to illustrate the denial of Palestinian history and sum up the Palestinians&#x27; sense of invisibility to Israel.

In 2023, Bezalel Smotrich, the Minister of Finance in Israel&#x27;s 2022 far-right coalition government, reiterated the denial of Palestinian identity.

<text>ASCI Blue Pacific was a supercomputer installed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in Livermore, CA at the end of . It was a collaboration between IBM and LLNL.

It was an IBM RS/6000 SP &quot;massively parallel processing&quot; system. It contained 5,856 PowerPC 604e microprocessors. Its theoretical top performance was 3.9 teraflops.

It was built as a stage of the Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative (ASCI) started by the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Nuclear Security Administration to build a simulator to replace live nuclear weapon testing following the moratorium on testing started by President George H. W. Bush in 1992 and extended by Bill Clinton in 1993.

<text>Kyrkliga Folkpartiet ( or Popular Party) was a minor pro-fascist party in Sweden founded in 1930. The party was formed and led by Ivar Rhedin, a priest in the Church of Sweden. Rhedin was the editor of &quot;Göteborgs Stiftstidning&quot; (&quot;Magazine of the Diocese of Gothenburg&quot;), in which he wrote many pro-German articles. The party was an ally of the main Nazi party in Sweden, National Socialist Workers Party. But the cooperation between the two parties did not last. Although both groups were staunch antisemites, their approaches toward the Jews were somewhat different. Rhedin, as a conservative Christian, was against the Jews as a religious community. NSAP were against the Jews as a race. Rhedin had no problem in accepting Jews who converted to Christianity, whereas NSAP and other nazi groups considered that converted Jews continued to be Jews in racial aspects. The party was closed down in 1936.

<text>Moeritherium (&quot;the beast from Lake Moeris&quot;) is an extinct genus of basal proboscideans from the Eocene of North and West Africa. The first specimen was discovered in strata from the Fayum fossil deposits of Egypt. It was named in 1901 by Charles William Andrews, who suggested that it was an early proboscidean, perhaps ancestral to mastodons, although subsequent workers considered it everything from a relative of manatees to a close relative of both clades&#x27; common ancestor. Currently, &quot;Moeritherium&quot; is seen as a proboscidean that, while fairly basal, predates the split between elephantiforms and deinotheres. Seven species have been named, though only three (M. lyonsi, M. gracile, and M. chehbeurameuri), are currently considered valid. 

&quot;Moeritherium&quot; is unusual even among basal proboscidean standards. Like many later members of the group, it had two sets of tusks: the ones on the upper jaw pointed downwards, while those of the mandible (lower jaw) were flat and formed a spade shape. In addition to these trunks, it retained its upper canines, though had lost the lower set. The morphology of the skull, particularly the nasal cavity (which was only slightly retracted), suggests that &quot;Moeritherium&quot; lacked a trunk. It may have instead possessed a small, tapir-like proboscis, formed from the fusion of the upper lip and the nose, an evolutionary precursor of trunks. Though poorly described in the literature, &quot;Moeritherium&quot;&#x27;s torso is known to have been very long, and its limbs were short. These divergent traits have led to comparisons with desmostylians, a lineage of extinct mammals formerly believed to have been relatives of manatees.

&quot;Moeritherium&quot; has been suggested to have led a semi-aquatic lifestyle. While this originally stemmed from perceived similarities to sirenians (manatees and dugongs), morphological data and isotope analysis has since lent it a great deal of support. The elongated body of &quot;Moeritherium&quot;, and the high position of its eyes and ears, are likely a result of its lifestyle, and its unusual dentition is likely an adaptation for feeding on water plants.

==Taxonomy==
=== Early history ===
The type species of &quot;Moeritherium&quot;, &quot;M. lyonsi&quot;, was discovered in strata belonging to the Qasr el Sagha Formation in the Fayum fossil deposits of Egypt. The type specimen (CGM C.10000) consists of an almost complete mandible. It was described in 1901 by Charles William Andrews, who proposed two hypotheses for its phylogenetic position: either &quot;Moeritherium&quot; was part of the obsolete order Amblypoda, or it was an early proboscidean, perhaps &quot;a generalised forerunner of the Mastodon type&quot;. In any case, he regarded it as an ungulate. 

=== Additional species ===
In 1902, after conducting a more thorough examination of specimens collected by himself and his colleague, Hugh John Llewellyn Beadnell, he named a second species from the Qasr el Sagha, &quot;M. gracile&quot;; a third was recognised in the same paper, though he did not provide a name, and referred to it simply as &quot;M.&quot; sp. The two species were distinguished from &quot;M. lyonsi&quot; by a more gracile build and a larger body size respectively. The lack of material overlap has made it difficult to determine how &quot;M. gracile&quot; actually relates to &quot;M. lyonsi&quot;, as their holotypes consist of different skull elements; the type specimen of the former (CGM C.10003) is a palate with no associated lower teeth. Regardless, they are treated as belonging to the same genus, and are likely separate. Two years later, a fourth taxon, &quot;M. trigodon&quot;, was described, also by Andrews, based on remains recovered from the &quot;fluvio-marine beds&quot; (equivalent to the Jebel Qatrani Formation) around the lake Birket-el-Qurun. In 1955, over half a century after the genus&#x27; initial naming, Sri Lankan artist and palaeontologist Paulus Edward Pieris Deraniyagala named two additional species, &quot;P. latidens&quot; and &quot;P. pharaonensis&quot;, based on isolated mandibular fragments.

In 1911, German zoologist Max Schlosser divided &quot;M. lyonsi&quot; into two species: &quot;M. lyonsi&quot;, restricted to the Qasr el Sagha Formation, and &quot;M. andrewsi&quot;, restricted to the Jebel Qatrani. This classification, however, has been rejected. In 1971, German zoologist Heinz Tobien opted to synonymise the entire genus with &quot;M. lyonsi&quot;, though he chose to altogether disregard, Deraniyagala&#x27;s species, likely as they were poorly diagnostic. In 2006, Cyrile Delmer et al. published a paper describing a new &quot;Moeritherium&quot; species, &quot;M. chehbeurameuri&quot;, from Bir El Ater, Algeria. In their paper, they treated most of the above species (with the exception of &quot;M. latidens&quot; and &quot;M. pharaonensis&quot;) as valid. While the paper was not intended as a systematic revision, they chose to treat at the very least three species as valid: the type species &quot;M. lyonsi&quot;, &quot;M. gracile&quot;, and &quot;M. chehbeaurameuri&quot;.

=== Classification ===
Henry Fairfield Osborn, in 1909, suggested that &quot;Moeritherium&quot; was more similar to sirenians (manatees and dugongs, and their extinct kin) to any living or extinct proboscidean. In 1921, however, he rejected this view, and divided Proboscidea into four suborders or superfamilies: Moeritherioidea, Deinotherioidea, Mastodontoidea, and Elephantoidea. In a 1988 paper discussing the systematics of proboscideans, Pascal Tassy abandoned this system and neglected to provide any superfamily-rank clades. Erecting the suborder Elephantiformes, Tassy placed &quot;Moeritherium&quot; outside it, alongside &quot;Barytherium&quot;, &quot;Numidotherium&quot;, and the Deinotheriidae. He considered &quot;Moeritherium&quot; among the most basal proboscideans, with &quot;Numidotherium&quot; being the most basal and &quot;Barytherium&quot; being only slightly less basal than that. In a 2021 paper describing a new genus (&quot;Dagbatitherium tassyi&quot;) Lionel Hautier et al. ran a phylogenetic analysis which recovered &quot;Moeritherium&quot; as sister to a clade including deinotheres and elephantiforms.

A cladogram of Proboscidea based on the phylogenetic analysis of Hautier et al. 2021 is below:

==Description==

&quot;Moeritherium&quot; was a fairly small, very elongate taxon. It was smaller than most later proboscideans. The species &quot;M. lyonsi&quot; has an estimated body length of . At the shoulder, this species measured only , and it had a body mass of , though &quot;Moeritherium&quot; exhibited strong sized-based sexual dimorphism, so this estimate should be considered a crude average.

=== Skull and dentition ===

The skull of &quot;Moeritherium&quot; was long, slender, and very low for the entirety of its length. The cranial region is nearly twice as long as the facial region. The orbit (eye socket) occupied a fairly anterodorsal position, meaning that it sat towards the front and top of the skull, and resembled that of sirenians. Unlike later proboscideans, the naris (nasal cavity) was fairly close to the front of the skull, which, in conjunction with the length of the mandible, suggests that a conventional trunk was absent in &quot;Moeritherium&quot;. It may have instead possessed a wide, mobile unit comprising the nose and upper lip, similar to the proboscis of modern tapirs. The external ear would have been high up on the skull, which may have been an adaptation for a semiaquatic lifestyle; the same, however, is observed in other proboscideans that are unlikely to have been aquatic, such as &quot;Gomphotherium&quot; and &quot;Palaeomastodon&quot;.

&quot;Moeritherium&quot; has a dental formula of . The first lower incisors sit close together, forming a spade shape, while the equivalent set on the upper jaw, actually the second incisors (as in later genera), were modified into short, curved tusks. &quot;Moeritherium&quot; still retained the first and third upper incisors, and the upper canines, though in a highly reduced form. The cheek teeth (the premolars and molars) were bunodont, bearing rounded cusps, though were also lophodont, bearing large ridges called lophs between cusps. The premolars are large and broad in relation to the molars, a condition not seen in more derived proboscideans, though similar to in manatees.

=== Postcranial skeleton ===
The postcranial anatomy of &quot;Moeritherium&quot; has been compared to desmostylians, such as &quot;Pezosiren&quot;. Both taxa have an extremely elongated, broad torso, possibly an adaptation for diving in both taxa. Little of the cervical (neck) vertebrae is known, save for the atlas and some of the middle cervical vertebrae. Most of the vertebral column, save for some cervical vertebrae and one of the thoracic (upper body) vertebrae, is known from a specimen that was at some point catalogued as C. 10005, probably belonging to &quot;M. lyonsi&quot;. A more complete specimen of &quot;Moeritherium&quot; is known, though has not been described in detail. Like modern proboscideans, there twenty-three presacral vertebrae (those preceding the sacrum). The lumbar (lower back) region was longer proportionally than in modern proboscideans, while the thoracic region was slightly shorter. &quot;Moeritherium&quot;&#x27;s limbs were extremely short compared to those of later taxa, being roughly half as big, proportionally, as those of extant elephants.

== Palaeobiology ==

=== Lifestyle ===
The notion of &quot;Moeritherium&quot; being semi-aquatic dates as far back as 1909, when Henry Fairfield Osborn suggested that it was not only related to sirenians, but resembled them in habits. In his 1923 paper discussing the genus&#x27; morphology, Japanese zoologist Matsumoto Hikoshichirō listed adaptations that indicated a semi-aquatic lifestyle (such as the high position of the eyes and ears), though also listed several that were evidence against it (such as its dentition, which to him seemed better-suited to a terrestrial forager). In his view, &quot;Moeritherium&quot; was unlikely to be semi-aquatic. However, similarities with desmostylians have been noted in the postcranial skeleton, and its unusual limb proportions have been cited as the product of a semi-aquatic lifestyle. In 2008, stable isotopic analysis lent further credence to the semiaquatic model, with its oxygen isotope ratios more closely resembling those of aquatic ones than fully terrestrial ones, with it being suggested that &quot;Moeritherium&quot; likely consumed freshwater plants.

== Palaeoenvironment ==

The environment of the Jebel Qatrani Formation, from which some specimens of &quot;Moeritherium&quot; are known, have been described as a subtropical to tropical lowland plain by Bown, who further suggests the presence of streams and ponds.

Based on the occurrence of birds that are associated with water (such as ospreys, early flamingos, jacanas, herons, storks, cormorants and shoebills), Rasmussen and colleagues similarly inferred that the environment featured slow-moving freshwater with a substantial amount of aquatic vegetation. Although lithology suggests that most fossils were deposited on sandbanks after being transported by currents, the authors argue that swamps could have easily formed along the banks of the river that was present during the Oligocene and may account for the mudstone found in certain quarries. They furthermore suggest that the fossil birds of Fayum, due to their affinities with modern groups, should be considered a more valuable indicator of the environment when compared with the fossil mammals, many of which belonged to families lacking modern examples. The absence of other birds typical for such an environment may be explained either through sampling bias or due to the fact that said groups had simply not yet been present in Oligocene Africa. Generally, Rasmussen and colleagues compare the environment of Jebel Qatrani to freshwater habitats in modern Central Africa. The discovery of snakehead fossils seem to support Rasmussen&#x27;s interpretation, as the &quot;Parachanna&quot; today prefers slow-moving backwaters with plenty of vegetation. Other fish present meanwhile, notably &quot;Tylochromis&quot;, suggest that deep, open water was likewise present. The river channels may have been overgrown with reeds, papyrus and featured floating vegetation like water lilies and &quot;Salvinia&quot;.

In a 2001 paper Rasmussen et al&quot;.&quot; argued that the sandstone and mudstone of the formation likely formed as sediments were aggraded by a system of river channels that emptied towards the west into the Tethys. Here they reconstructed the environment as a tropical lowland swamp forest intermingled with marshes. They furthermore suggest that the environment would have experienced monsoons.

Overall this indicates that this region was a part of an extensive belt of tropical forest that stretched across what is now northern Africa, which would gradually give rise to open woodland and even steppe the further one was to travel inland.

<text>ASCI Blue Mountain was a supercomputer installed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico. It was designed to run simulations for the United States National Nuclear Security Administration&#x27;s Advanced Simulation and Computing program. The computer was a collaboration between Silicon Graphics Corporation and Los Alamos National Laboratory. It was installed in 1998. 

It was a cluster of ccNUMA SGI Origin 2000 systems. It contains 6,144 MIPS R10000 microprocessors in 48 systems, each with 128 CPUs, connected by HIPPI in 438 racks. Its theoretical top performance is 3.072 teraflops. 

It was built as a stage of the Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative (ASCI) started by the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Nuclear Security Administration to build a simulator to replace live nuclear weapons testing following the moratorium on testing started by President George H. W. Bush in 1992 and extended by Bill Clinton in 1993. It was unveiled (commissioned) in 1998. In June 1999 it was the world&#x27;s second fastest computer, and remained among the world&#x27;s ten fastest computers until November 2001. According to the Los Alamos National Laboratory website, the supercomputer set a world record in May 2000, with the equivalent of 17.8 years of normal computer processing within 72 hours, including 15,000 engineering simulations requiring 10 hours each.

First commissioned in November 1998, the Blue Mountain was decommissioned on Monday, November 8, 2004 at 8 am, and was replaced by the ASCI Q, Lightning, and QSC supercomputers.

<doc id="1027287" wikidata="Q2407261" url="?curid=1027287" title="The Saga of Recluce">
<text>The Saga of Recluce is a series of fantasy novels written by L. E. Modesitt Jr. The initial novel in the series, &quot;The Magic of Recluce&quot;, was published in 1991. The series is still in publication with the latest novel published in November 2024, and two scheduled for 2025. In 2015 Modesitt stated that the (then) 20 novels in the &quot;Recluce&quot; series had sold nearly three million copies.

The 24 books of the series describe the changing, often confrontational, relationship between the descendants of two technologically advanced cultures, representatives of whom have been marooned on a sparsely inhabited world and regressed to the level of the existing inhabitants&#x27; primitive technology. Themes of gender stereotyping, sexism, ageism, racism, ethics, economics, environmentalism and politics are explored in the course of the series, which examines the world through the eyes of its protagonists.

The series is published outside of internal chronological order. The first book published in the series occurs near the end of the overall story, with subsequent books jumping further into the past to expand on elements of history. The author recommends reading the books in publication order. As of the most recent novel, &quot;Overcaptain&quot;, the saga covers 10 different time periods and 12 major story lines. The stories demonstrate the progression of real-life events into myth and legend over the progression of centuries, as the characters in one book will be known as heroes or mythical figures in other, chronologically later books. Additionally, certain characters appear in multiple books, the protagonists in one novel, appearing as a supporting characters in others.

Within the Recluce universe, all matter has inherent properties called &quot;order&quot; and &quot;chaos&quot;. Magic manifests as a person&#x27;s ability to manipulate these properties through thought. The feats which are feasible depend on the user&#x27;s (genetically limited) potential, on developing those abilities, and on the laws that govern the interaction and balance between the two forces in nature. Generally, those who manipulate order are called (black) mages. Those who manipulate chaos are called (white) wizards. Rare individuals (grays) can manipulate both. There are personal costs to using magic, both immediate and long term.

==Publishing history==
The novels were not published in the order in which events occurred in-universe. This table provides both the publication order and the in-universe chronological order (Recluce Year). The author has stated that publication order is the appropriate reading order.

*&quot;Recluce Tales&quot; (3 January 2017)

==Plot==
===Setting===
All of the novels take place in the same fantasy universe, spanning a time period of over two thousand years.

Within this universe, all matter is aligned with two competing forces: order and chaos. In their natural state, these forces are equally matched, in a condition called Balance. These two forces can be seen as fantasy representations of the natural entropy (chaos) that occurs in matter, balanced by the various molecular forces (order) that bind matter into structured forms. These forces are understood, at a basic level, by all inhabitants of the world. The colour white is identified with chaos; black with order. The first published novel explains it this way: white is the chaotic combination of all wavelengths of visible light, while black is the absence of this light. The extreme of either is undesirable...for a human, perfect chaos is destruction, perfect order is death.

Rare individuals within the universe possess the inborn ability to manipulate these forces. White wizards can draw chaos from a surrounding area and focus it into bolts of flame. Black mages can concentrate order into matter, making it unnaturally strong. 

A more limited &quot;subclass&quot; of black mage which is generally acceptable, even highly desirable, even in white chaos dominated societies is the healer. Both forces can be used to kill or to shield. Both types of wielders can, to a degree, detect the presence of both forces. People who are being deceptive, infections, and toxins emanate chaos of differing types discernible by a trained wielder.

Openly gray mages are extremely rare. They manipulate both order and chaos. They are among the most powerful characters in the series. They can prolong their lives and perform awesome magical feats. It is hinted that some black mages could have become gray if they had decided to, and many of the white wizards are implied to be secretly gray, and they may not even be aware of this. &quot;Grays&quot; can choose the lifestyle of a Druid. Druids live in seclusion and are far less known, most in the Great Forest of Naclos. They exercise magic differently.

Part of the plot in each novel involves protagonists discovering novel ways to wield chaos and order. Individuals vary significantly in innate magical strength and in skill at wielding it. They improve through exerting themselves through practice, developing new techniques via personal experimentation, and by studying written lore (which is scant and cryptic).

The manipulation of chaos comes at a price: over time, it can permeate a wizard, accelerating the deterioration of everything around him or her (example: wine turning to vinegar almost before the wizard can drink it). Those wizards who channel chaos through their bodies (nearly all of them) have short lifespans, inversely proportional to the amount of chaos they raise. Some have found ways to reduce this effect. Additionally, any living being that is exposed to much chaos (such as the inhabitants of Fairhaven) experiences a burning sensation upon touching an ordered object, akin to touching an extremely cold object. The effect&#x27;s severity is proportional to the accumulated chaos. For White Wizards, the result is often death.

The manipulation of order has costs too. Wielding it carelessly can drain a mage of the order needed to sustain life (example: absent-mindedly stroking one&#x27;s wooden staff). Exceptional mages in the series discover ways to use order to funnel chaos, working around their inability to manipulate chaos directly. This is effective in combat but these actions backlash on the wielder because death itself releases chaos. The unleashed chaos harms the mage. It can cause disorientation, even sensory deprivation, for timespans proportional to the amount of destruction.

The original wielders of magic were marooned on the world of Recluce from another universe, where they were space-farers engaged in a protracted war, and most of the novels take place long after these arrivals, however, &quot;Fall of Angels&quot; does provide a brief glimpse into that other universe. The reader first discovers this through quotes and legends peppered throughout the series. The preexisting native population had developed something approximating medieval technology. The new arrivals could not keep their technology operational, but found the same skill with which they interfaced with their ship, allowed them to manipulate latent forces within the new world.

The ancestors of the people who would rule empires powered and dominated by white chaos were stranded first, they were the Rationalists (aka &quot;Rats&quot;, or &quot;Demons&quot;). They would found an empire, Cyador, that would destroy the majority of the Great Forest, what they call The Accursed Forest, enclosing the remainder inside a great wall, and dominated the East of the continent of Candar. This empire would be patriarchal and could be oppressive to women in varying degrees through its history, but a genteel and paternal sort of oppression, in contrast to the &quot;native&quot; misogynists, who are more predatory and crude.

The ancestors of those who would predominantly wield black order known as Angels, were marooned 600 years later, and would found two authoritarian, militaristic, matriarchal, vaguely misandrist states on Candar and generally fought native opponents rather than their Rationalist counterparts. The series is named for a black order-based island state which was founded by two powerful individuals from those states, abandoning the matriarchy and vague misandry in favor of a more modern (but not fully) outlook. However it does evolve an intolerance for anything that threatens its highly successful order-based homogeneity, banishing anyone they believe to be undesirable, chaos wielders and those unwilling or unable to fit in to Recluce society alike.

The technology, weaponry, and ideology of each culture is reflected in the magical abilities, hair colour, and world views of their descendants in the Recluce universe. Offspring can usually inherit magical abilities, and talent for both black order and white chaos appeared in the descendants of both groups, although one was generally favored over the other, if the other wasn&#x27;t oppressed or shunned.

The arrival of the Angels is described in &quot;Fall of Angels&quot;: a space warship, the &quot;Winterlance&quot;, is part of an Angel fleet attacking a Rationalist blockade. The Angels are losing. During the battle, an exceptional event occurs: energy weapons of opposite types align and focus on the Winterlance. The result is surprising: instead of being destroyed, the ship materializes elsewhere. From various evidence, the crew concludes that they are in an alternate universe, ruled by different physical laws. The ship no longer functions but it is close to a habitable planet, and the crew crash lands there. Soon, individuals discover strange talents and physical changes (such as hair colour) that will ultimately become linked to order magic. Upon contacting the planet&#x27;s locals, they discover that Rationalists are also present on the planet.

===Chronology===
Chronologically, the series spans 2,255 years. The story actually begins well before even the earliest novel, with the arrival of the &quot;demons of light&quot; from another universe. Using their manifest chaos powers as well as their advanced technology, these people create an empire called Cyador, on the continent of Candar. While the series is named after Recluce, that island is uninhabited for the first millennium of the story.

The first two books as of 2024, chronologically, are &quot;From the Forest&quot; and &quot;Overcaptain&quot;, which describe the operation of the Cyador army and its battles against the natives of Candar. These novels, together with &quot;Magi&#x27;i of Cyador&quot; and &quot;Scion of Cyador&quot;, primarily serve to flesh out a formerly unknown part of the history of the universe. The story does establish one key element in the history of Cyador: the ultimate decline of the advanced technology of the Rationalists. Initially, upon landing on a mostly-uninhabited part of one of the world&#x27;s continents, the Rationalists (later known as Demons) managed to create a number of advanced mechanical devices, powered by chaos. They also erected a number of collection towers that were used to focus chaos into these devices. By the time of the first novel, these towers are failing, and the empire is losing the ability to maintain its advanced technology. The opening of &quot;Magi&#x27;i of Cyador&quot; was once considered &quot;Year 1&quot; in the history of Recluce, as no years are given in the text of the book, but was later made year 410 by the author, with the founding of Cyad given as the start of the calendar. Per the table above, the first stories in the latest series date from year 92-104. Modesitt has stated in an interview that he does not intend to add any earlier stories.

&quot;The Fall of Angels&quot;, 400 years later, details the arrival of the Angels and the founding of the female-dominated city of Westwind. Unlike the Demons, the Angels manipulate order. Of note are two specific angels, Nylan and Ryba, who would become legendary figures in coming novels. Ryba develops a talent for prophecy. Her extensive writings are quoted by future generations as &quot;The Book of Ryba&quot;, while Nylan develops the foundations of order magic. Nylan also fathers the child Weryl. In &quot;The Chaos Balance&quot;, Nylan leaves Westwind for a more direct confrontation with Cyador. By this time, the fire-wagons and fire-lances that were once central to the empire have vanished, and the empire is fully dependent on its chaos wizards. The ultimate result of this confrontation is the founding of the Druids, which take up residence in a magically active forest called The Accursed Forest by the natives, but The Great Forest of Naclos in later generations.

Set ten years after the events in &quot;The Chaos Balance&quot;, &quot;Arms-Commander&quot; follows the story of Saryn, the head of the guards of Westwind. She tries to protect Westwind, as political and military problems build in the surrounding countries of Gallos, Lornth, and Suthya. In this novel, characters indicate that almost 10 generations have passed since the reign of Lorn in Cyador.

Decades after the fall of Cyador, &quot;Cyador&#x27;s Heirs&quot; finds its survivors have reestablished themselves in Cigoerne, a fertile country coveted by hostile neighbors in less hospitable lands. Young Lerial, the second son of Duke Kiedron, lives in the shadow of his older brother Lephi, the heir to their father&#x27;s realm. Lerial&#x27;s future seems preordained: He will one day command his brother&#x27;s forces in defense of Cigoerne, serving at his older sibling&#x27;s pleasure and no more. But when Lerial is sent abroad to be fostered by Major Altyrn to learn the skills and wisdom he will need to fulfill his future duties, he begins a journey into a much larger world that brings out his true potential. Lerial has talents that few, as yet, suspect: he is one of those rare beings who can harness both Order and Chaos, the competing natural forces that shape the world and define the magic that exists within it. And as war finally engulfs the fringes of Cigoerne, Lerial&#x27;s growing mastery of Order and Chaos is tested to its limits
and his own.

Generations after the Angels reshaped the political climate in central Candar, the Prefect of Gallos seeks for an excuse to start another war with Westwind in the opening of &quot;The Mongrel Mage&quot;. The Prefect sends three white mages with an escort to investigate &#x27;raids&#x27; in the bordering plains between the two powers. Those mages are Beltur, his prominent white mage uncle, and his uncle&#x27;s apprentice. After their findings displease the Prefect and his high mages, Beltur&#x27;s uncle sacrifices himself so the young man can flee. With the aid of Jessyla, a young healer, Beltur travels to Elparta in Spidlar alongside a black mage named Athaal. Beltur, always considered weak as a white mage, is revealed to be a black, or possibly gray, mage. In Elparta he increases his skills in order magic, finds works serving in the city patrol and helping a coppersmith forge cupridium, and strives to recover from the turmoil of Gallos. Soon, however, he discovers he cannot escape his past, as the Prefect and his white mages decide to conquer Elparta with their powerful army. Recruited into Elparta&#x27;s defense, Beltur excels as an arms-mage, bolstered by his desire to defend his new home and its people which now includes Jessyla, her mother, and many other recent friends. The victory of Elparta is marred by the loss of Athaal who Beltur was unable to save in battle. In &quot;Outcasts of Order&quot; Beltur attempts to return to his daily routine immediately after the war with Gallos but intrigue among the Trader&#x27;s Council and the local group of black mages removes any chance he has to make Elparta his permanent home. He begins to train the young daughter of a black mage who is destined to be a powerful chaos wielder. Forced to flee after defending himself and his coppersmith partner from two murderous black mages, Beltur travels to Axalt as the request of the smith and with Jessyla as his new consort. Adjusting to a new life in Axalt grows increasingly complicated as once again the powerful are threatened by his presence. When his white mage apprentice and her family are exiled from Elparta they seek refuge with Beltur in Axalt. Despite assistance from the coppersmith&#x27;s family Beltur, Jessyla and their guests are barely able to secure permission to stay. When he is unable to prevent a murder, Beltur tries to enact some justice for it, but ultimately is forced out of another city. Remembering an invitation from a mysterious trader in Montgren, Beltur and Jessyla travel with the young white mage and her family to the small duchy to seek a better life. Surviving bandit raids and surveying local power structures along the way, Beltur&#x27;s followers arrive in Montgren to find themselves not only welcome, but expected. The Duchess offers them an enticing prospect - they can become the new council for a practically abandoned town, making it a home shaped in their own image. Beltur accepts and pledges to manage the town, Haven, as a place where mages of both chaos and order will be welcome.

500 years after the arrival of the Angels, in &quot;The Towers of Sunset&quot;, Cyador is long gone. But, half-way across the continent of Candar, towards the East, is Fairhaven: a city-state ruled by an oligarchy of white wizards. Their prejudices and their written history imply that Fairhaven was founded by descendants of Cyador. Westwind is the bulwark of the matriarchal societies of Western Candar which hold to the Legend of Ryba. Westwind is under threat from the white wizards of the city of Fairhaven, which exerts a great deal of influence over the male-dominated lands of Eastern Candar. A very strong order mage, Creslin, who is suggested to be the son of Weryl and grandson of the first &quot;black mage&quot; Nylan, flees female-dominated Westwind prior to an arranged marriage, only to be pursued by the white wizards who fear his strength. He ultimately escapes Candar, having married a chaos wizard in the process, and sails to the uninhabited island of Recluce. Here, Creslin begins a society based entirely on order magic. We also begin to learn the dangers of widespread order or chaos magic, as Creslin&#x27;s unskilled efforts to make Recluce habitable cause severe weather elsewhere in the world, including massive storms, hurricanes, floods and droughts.

Several hundred years later, the chaos wizards in Candar have managed to conquer almost the entire continent. Beginning in the year 1590, &quot;The White Order&quot; and &quot;Colors of Chaos&quot; depict the progress of a young chaos wizard named Cerryl as he rises in the ranks of the white wizards. He is constantly fending off attempts on his life from the extremely powerful wizard Jeslek, who has begun to literally raise mountains from the ground to protect the paved highways the chaos wizards have been creating across Candar. At the same time, in the year 1600, &quot;The Magic Engineer&quot; details the journey of Dorrin, an order mage from Recluce. This is the point, both chronologically and to the reader, where the importance of balance between chaos and order starts to become apparent. (There are some hints in this regard in the first novel, but here the underlying causes are explained more fully.) Creslin&#x27;s attempts to focus order around Recluce have led to an abundance of &quot;free chaos&quot; elsewhere in the world. This has led to increasingly stronger chaos wizards, ultimately leading to the formation of a &#x27;chaos-focus&#x27; in the wizard Jeslek, granting him extraordinary strength. This, in turn, is allowing more order to be focused in Recluce, until something catastrophic happens to reset the balance.

Dorrin begins using order magic with his innate engineering talent to create steam-powered machines from order-infused wood and metal. These are capable of containing large amounts of chaos energy. Of particular note are the extremely fast and powerful warships that Recluce begins to build, after Dorrin demonstrates their usefulness. The vast amount of order concentrated in these ships will accelerate the growth of chaos in the world. Dorrin spends some time in Candar fighting off the white wizards, then returns to Recluce to become the first &quot;order engineer&quot; and founds what later becomes the major city on Recluce, named after Nylan from &quot;The Fall of Angels&quot;. Meanwhile, Jeslek is ultimately destroyed in his confrontation with Dorrin, leading to Cerryl becoming High Wizard and attempting some measure of truce with Recluce.

In 1900, the story continues with &quot;Natural Ordermage&quot; and &quot;Mage-Guard of Hamor&quot;. It deals with the familiar motif of exile for a budding mage as yet unable and/or unwilling to control his newfound powers, this time on the continent-country of Hamor. The switch (which is a Modesitt trademark) from a pro-Recluce viewpoint to one inside the heretofore vilified Hamorian empire provides a probing look at prejudice, and also lays bare the conflict and corruption within the Recluce society and organizations at that time. Rahl, an apprentice scrivener with no taste for responsibility or accountability, is discovered by the magisters of Recluce to have an inordinately strong grasp of certain order abilities. As their methods are not suited to instruct one such as him he is exiled to Hamor. Caught in the middle of a conspiracy immediately after his arrival, Rahl soon finds himself in the infamous penal ironworks of Luba only to escape them when his abilities surface. As a mage-guard of the Empire he finds himself forced to become more than he was in order to survive first as a patroller and then as an officer in an army during a civil war.

After centuries of relative peace, in 2050, &quot;The Order War&quot; depicts the progress of two order mages from Recluce, Justen and Gunnar, as they attempt to defend the last free country in Candar from the white wizards, who have begun to use order-based soldiers to add to their own defense while simultaneously increasing their own chaos powers by increasing the amount of order in the world, as according to the plans of Cerryl from &quot;The White Order&quot; and &quot;Colors of Chaos&quot;. During their journey, Justen transitions himself into a gray mage, and is ultimately driven into the forest of Naclos, where he becomes a Druid. We also meet several legendary figures, including Ayrlyn (the wife of Nylan and one of the original angels) and the still alive Weryl, and learn how the Druids&#x27; mastery of both order and chaos has enabled them to keep their bodies alive for thousands of years. Justen leaves the forest and returns to fight the chaos wizards, and uses his newfound knowledge of order and chaos balance mastery to
form a tremendous weapon. This weapon unleashes the apocalyptic event that has been building for centuries, drawing on vast amounts of both order and chaos to utterly destroy the chaos wizards&#x27; capital city and kill nearly all of the powerful chaos wizards in the process. The result of this is a dramatic reduction in both free order and free chaos in the world.

Another diversionary storyline begins in 2110, with &quot;Wellspring of Chaos&quot; and &quot;Ordermaster&quot; depicting the life of an unlikely mage named Kharl. This storyline (which spans the continents of Nordla and Austra) tells the story of Kharl&#x27;s transition from cooper to order-mage. Kharl becomes a powerful self-taught order-mage, an unlikely hero, and reputedly the most powerful black mage outside of Recluce during this time period. The two books flesh out the resistance of Nordla and Austra to the Empire of Hamor&#x27;s attempts to expand their influence on the two continents. Notable characters from previous books of the series make brief appearances, including the gray wizard Justen. The two books flesh out two of the areas of the world that were mostly ignored in earlier novels and provides insight into the evolution of the Empire of Hamor, which plays a prominent part at the end of the series.

The final part of the saga occurs in the year 2250 and begins with &quot;The Magic of Recluce&quot;. Gunnar, who has kept himself and his family alive using druidic techniques taught by his brother Justen, sends his son Lerris (who is unaware of his father&#x27;s history and his own magical potential) to Candar to undertake a rite of passage commonly administered to dissatisfied individuals living in Recluce, especially those who have an affinity or ability for either order or chaos. While exiled to Candar, Lerris meets his uncle Justen, and comes to understand his father&#x27;s ulterior motives for sending him off. Centuries of dominance by Recluce and their order engineers has once again led to increasingly more powerful chaos wizards in Candar, with one in particular threatening to cause trouble on the scale of the white council. Gunnar has sent Lerris to Candar with the suspicion that a strong order mage and strong chaos wizard will ultimately be drawn into direct conflict, and that Lerris would take care of the
problem without Recluce being directly involved. Lerris ultimately defeats the white wizard and settles down in Candar to live as a woodworker.

The climax of the story, 5 years later, in &quot;The Death of Chaos&quot; sees the powerful Empire of Hamor, the oldest inhabited continent in the world, has been using the relative instability of the rest of the world to build weapons using bound order, building an enormous fleet of steel warships armed with powerful cannons. In the final climactic battle on the shores of Recluce, Lerris and his family use their mastery of order and chaos to forcibly impose a balance on the world, unleashing vast amounts of subterranean lava directly into the ocean beneath the invading Hamorian forces. In the end, Lerris uses the vast amounts of order in Recluce to bind all of the free chaos into small, balanced units (again, strongly reminiscent of particle physics). The result is the destruction of nearly all of the order and chaos magic in the world, including Lerris&#x27;s family (which was being kept alive by magic) and even parts of the continent of Recluce itself.

Aside from the titanic magical battles, the book introduces the unique character of Lerris - wielder of enormous, literally earth-shaking magical power, yet whose true passion and vocation is woodworking and creating exquisite pieces of furniture by completely material tools and with no use of magic. At the concluding scene of the book - and so far, of the entire series - Lerris, deeply scarred from the final cataclysmic battle, is happy to leave magic behind him and settle into the life of a skilled craftsman.

<doc id="1027298" wikidata="Q4492003" url="?curid=1027298" title="Fort Knox (Maine)">
<text>Fort Knox, now Fort Knox State Park or Fort Knox State Historic Site, is located on the western bank of the Penobscot River in the town of Prospect, Maine, about from the mouth of the river. Built between 1844 and 1869, it was the first fort in Maine built entirely of granite; most previous forts used wood, earth, and stone. It is named after Major General Henry Knox, the first U.S. Secretary of War and Commander of Artillery during the American Revolutionary War, who at the end of his life lived not far away in Thomaston. As a virtually intact example of a mid-19th century granite coastal fortification, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1969 and declared a National Historic Landmark on December 30, 1970. Fort Knox also serves as the entry site for the observation tower of the Penobscot Narrows Bridge that opened to the public in 2007.

==History==
===Background===
Local memory of the humiliation of Maine at the hands of the British during the American Revolution and again during the War of 1812 contributed to subsequent anti-British feeling in Eastern Maine. The Penobscot Expedition of 1779 aimed to force the British from New Ireland (Maine), but ended in a debacle. The Americans lost 43 ships and suffered approximately 500 casualties in the worst naval defeat for the United States prior to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Then in autumn 1814, during the War of 1812, a British naval force and soldiers sailed up the Penobscot and defeated an outnumbered American force in the Battle of Hampden. The British followed their victory by looting both Hampden and Bangor. The American defeat contributed to the post-war movement for Maine&#x27;s statehood, which occurred in 1820, as Massachusetts had failed to protect the region.

The Aroostook War of 1838-1839 revived anti-British feeling and concern over the vulnerability of the region to another attack like that of 1814. Also, the Penobscot valley and Bangor were major sources of shipbuilding lumber. The response was the inclusion of the Penobscot in the Third System of coastal fortifications, and the construction of Fort Knox, a large, expensive, granite fort at the mouth of the Penobscot River.

===Construction===
Construction began in 1844 and continued until all masonry fort funding was withdrawn in 1869, with the fort mostly complete except for the emplacements on the &quot;roof&quot; or barbette level. Funding from Congress was intermittent, and the fort&#x27;s design was never fully completed despite an expenditure of $1,000,000. Granite was quarried five miles (8 km) upriver from Mount Waldo in Frankfort. The fort&#x27;s overall design was by Joseph G. Totten, the foremost fortification engineer of the Army Corps of Engineers in his day. Notable engineer officers supervising construction included Isaac Ingalls Stevens and Thomas L. Casey.

Besides the main fort with 64 guns, Fort Knox had two open water batteries facing the river, each equipped with a shot furnace to heat cannonballs sufficiently that they could ignite wooden ships if the ball lodged in the vessel. These furnaces became obsolete with the adoption of ironclad warships.

===Civil War===
Fort Knox never saw battle, though it was manned during times of war. During the American Civil War volunteers from Maine, mostly recruits in training before assignment to active duty, manned the fort. Thomas Lincoln Casey supervised work on the fort, including adapting the batteries to use the recently invented Rodman cannon, and oversaw its completion.

===Spanish–American War===
A regiment from Connecticut manned Fort Knox during the Spanish–American War. A plaque at the fort describes the laying of a controlled minefield in the river during this war, which Congress appropriated $3,200 for shortly after its outbreak.

===Post Spanish–American War===
The garrison was reduced to one man, the &quot;Keeper of the Fort&quot; or caretaker with the rank of ordnance sergeant, at the end of the war. The keeper attended to the condition and maintenance of the fort, and reported to Fort Preble in South Portland. In 1900 the fort received a permanent &quot;torpedo storehouse&quot; for storing naval mines (which were called torpedoes at the time) that is now the Visitor Center.

In 1923, the federal government declared the fort excess property and put its grounds up for sale. The state of Maine bought it for $2,121. It has been administered as a Maine state historic site since 1943.

A work crew from the Ellsworth camp of the Civilian Conservation Corps, Co. 193 was deployed to transform the fort into a tourist destination. The November 1936 issue of Brann News, the camp newspaper lists work accomplished: &quot;picnic area, reforestation, road construction, drainage in fort itself, Spring development, table and bench combinations, fireplaces, reconstruction of the retaining wall on the river side of the fort, repairing masonry work, in the interior of the fort.&quot;

==Present==
The fort today is distinguished as one of the best-preserved and most accessible forts in the United States. Virtually all of the fort is open to the public. Several period weapons are on site, including two 15-inch Rodman smoothbores in the water batteries (one remounted), an 8-inch Rodman converted rifle near the parking lot, a 10-inch Rodman smoothbore in the fort, and several 24-pounder flank howitzers. Some of the flank howitzers are mounted on original carriages; &quot;Fort Monroe 1862&quot; can be seen on the bronze plates of these carriages. Remounted 15-inch Rodman guns are rare, as they weigh 50,000 pounds. They were the largest weapon produced in quantity of the Civil War era.

==Friends of Fort Knox==

The Friends of Fort Knox, a nonprofit group formed in the 1990s, has been responsible for many fort repairs and improvements. Friends of Fort Knox projects include the transformation of the Torpedo Storage Shed into the Visitor and Education Center, restoration of the Officer&#x27;s Quarters, installation of interpretive panels, repair of Battery A powder magazine, restoration and display of four 24-pound flank defense howitzers, repair and opening of the enlisted men&#x27;s quarters, cistern, rooms and extensive masonry repair.

The Friends reached an agreement with the State Department of Conservation to take over day-to-day operations of the Fort, and began doing so on April 15, 2012. The State retains ownership of the fort as part of the agreement. The lease runs through 2015 and requires the Friends to be responsible for all maintenance of the grounds as well as the interior and exterior of buildings on the property. The Friends may also improve or alter the fort as long as any changes are consistent with the law.

Beginning in 2012 the Friends were authorized to set the entrance fee to the fort, with the approval of the Bureau of Parks and Lands, with such fees consistent with the goal of keeping entry affordable for Maine residents. In exchange, the Friends keep 85 percent of entrance fee revenue, with the rest going to the State General Fund.

==In the media==
===Television===
Fort Knox was featured as one of the haunted locations on the paranormal TV series &quot;Most Terrifying Places in America&quot; in an episode titled &quot;Cursed Towns&quot; that aired on the Travel Channel in 2018.

The Travel Channel&#x27;s television show &quot;Destination Fear&quot; filmed at the abandoned fort for the third episode of their third season (2021).

<text>Gerard Chittocque Brandon (September 15, 1788March 28, 1850) was an American political leader who twice served as Governor of Mississippi during its early years of statehood. He was the first native-born governor of Mississippi. He was a delegate to the constitutional conventions of 1817 and 1832. He served as Speaker of the Mississippi House of Representatives in 1822. As Lieutenant Governor of Mississippi he served as President of the Mississippi Senate. When Walter Leake died in 1825 he became governor. He also succeeded David Holmes who resigned in 1826 due to ill health. He was elected to the office in 1827 and again in 1829. Brandon, Mississippi is named for him.

==Early life and education==
Gerard Brandon was the son of an Irish immigrant, Gerard Chittocque Brandon, who established and ran the Selma Plantation in Adams County, Mississippi, and Dorothy Nugent, the daughter of Irish immigrants Matthew Nugent and Isabel MacBray. The couple moved to Mississippi from South Carolina sometime in 1785.

Brandon was born September 15, 1788, in Natchez, in the Territory of Mississippi, the second child and first son of the family. He was educated at Princeton University and the College of William &amp; Mary and served in the War of 1812. He later practiced law at Washington, Mississippi and was a successful planter, following his father&#x27;s footsteps, in Adams County, Mississippi.
He married Margaret Chambers on January 18, 1816, in Bardstown, Kentucky. In 1817 Gerard Brandon bought Windy Hill Manor. At his death, Windy Hill Manor was inherited by his daughter, Elizabeth, who married William Stanton. Elizabeth and William&#x27;s descendants lived at Windy Hill Manor until the 1940s. The last in the line were three unmarried sisters, Elizabeth, Maude, and Beatrice. When the last sister died in 1945, the house sat abandoned until 1965, when it was demolished.

After Margaret Chambers&#x27;s death in June 1820, Gerard Brandon married Betsy Stanton on July 12, 1824, in Adams County, Mississippi. The governor had a total of eight children with his two wives.

Brandon died at 61 on March 28, 1850, and was buried in a private family cemetery at his Columbian Springs Plantation in Wilkinson County, Mississippi.

A slaveholder himself, he said he considered slavery an evil; his son, however, possessed a fortune in human property, including the kidnapped Henrietta Wood.

==Political life==
Brandon, a delegate to the constitutional conventions of 1817 and 1832, helped draft Mississippi&#x27;s first two constitutions. He served in the Mississippi Legislature and was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives in 1822.

In 1825, Brandon became governor of Mississippi for the first time upon the death of Walter Leake, serving from Leake&#x27;s death on November 17, 1825, until January 7, 1826, when David Holmes, the last territorial governor and first governor of the State of Mississippi was again inaugurated as governor.

Brandon became acting governor of Mississippi again on July 25, 1826 when Governor David Holmes resigned due to ill health. Brandon served until January 9, 1832, being reelected in the 1827 election and 1829 election.

Gerard Brandon served as governor during an era known as the &quot;Flush Times,&quot; an era of expanded settlement and development in Mississippi and the surrounding areas. During his administration, the finalization of two Indian land sessions opened millions of acres of land to settlement, beginning the development of the cotton industry that would define Mississippi&#x27;s economy in the coming years. Governor Brandon oversaw the expansion of transportation in the infrastructure to connect the new agricultural land, as well as the construction of public schools and the chartering of Mississippi&#x27;s first railroad.

During Brandon&#x27;s administration, political and economic changes, including the creation of several new counties (Washington, Madison, Rankin, and Lowndes) and the expansion of suffrage to all white males, induced the populace to vote in favor of a constitutional convention to replace Mississippi&#x27;s Constitution of 1817.

After his term as governor ended, Brandon served as a delegate to the 1831 Constitutional Convention for Adams County. He then lived as a private citizen until his death in 1850.

Brandon, Mississippi, the county seat of Rankin County, is named after Gerard Brandon.

<doc id="1027305" wikidata="Q1778186" url="?curid=1027305" title="The Fiery Furnaces">
<text>The Fiery Furnaces are an American indie rock band, formed in 2000 in Brooklyn, New York. The band&#x27;s primary members are Matthew and Eleanor Friedberger. The siblings are originally from Oak Park, Illinois, a near-western suburb of Chicago. They are known for their ambitious, highly conceptual releases, which have frequently divided critical opinion.

In May 2011, the band entered a nine-year hiatus, with both Matthew and Eleanor pursuing solo careers. In February 2020, it was announced that The Fiery Furnaces would reunite to play at the Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic the event was canceled. It was later revealed that the band signed to Jack White&#x27;s Third Man Records label.

== History ==
The Fiery Furnaces signed with Rough Trade in 2002, and recorded their debut album, &quot;Gallowsbird&#x27;s Bark&quot;, the same year. Released in 2003, it was often compared in the press to The White Stripes due to the garage blues elements of the band&#x27;s sound and the fact that the members are siblings, which the White Stripes duo originally presented themselves as.

Matthew is primarily responsible for the band&#x27;s studio instrumentation and songwriting, while Eleanor handles the majority of the vocal duties. Drummer Andy Knowles and bassist Toshi Yano both joined the band for live performances in time for their 2004 tour. Beginning with a performance at the April 2004 All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival in Camber Sands, England, the band&#x27;s live performances took the form of hour-long, continuous sets of music featuring snippets from most of their recorded songs. Many times, several songs were melded together to create a conglomerate song that encompassed material from previously released songs, this producing similarly complicated set lists for the band to follow.

The Fiery Furnaces released their second album, &quot;Blueberry Boat&quot;, in the summer of 2004. It is also often interpreted as a multi-layered concept album. &quot;Quay Cur,&quot; the ten-minute lead track on Blueberry Boat, switches from dirty, gurgling organ to slide-guitar-fueled ditties, pulsing electronic beats to abstract lullaby within a few minutes, highlighting the Fiery Furnaces&#x27; variety in songwriting. Some critics, however, interpreted this type of material as evidence that the album is unfocused. The epic nature of the majority of the songs made them unsuitable for radio play so the band prepared &quot;Single Again,&quot; a take on a traditional folk song as a substitute.

This single, along with their previously released ones, was mostly only made available to the UK audience, so in January 2005 the band released a 41-minute compilation disc named &quot;EP&quot; (this confusingly being a designation commonly reserved for shorter discs). &quot;EP&quot; featured two new songs, all of the band&#x27;s singles and b-sides (with the exception of an alternate version of &quot;We Got Back The Plague&quot; found on the &quot;Tropical Ice-Land&quot; single), and was for this reason a contrast to the epic and, according to some, inaccessible nature of &quot;Blueberry Boat&quot;.

Their following album, &quot;Rehearsing My Choir&quot; (released in October 2005), saw the band return to an experimental sound once again. A concept album featuring the Friedbergers&#x27; grandmother, Olga Sarantos, narrating stories about her life, &quot;Rehearsing My Choir&quot; was met with widely differing opinions from both the press and the band&#x27;s fans, being branded &quot;difficult&quot; even by those who rated it highly. Sarantos previously worked as choir director at a Greek Orthodox church, and her croaked reminiscences form the backbone to this peculiar, piecemeal storybook of an album. Jason Loewenstein of Sebadoh and Bob D&#x27;Amico took over band duties for the supporting tour, replacing Toshi Yano and Andy Knowles.

The band released their fifth LP, entitled &quot;Bitter Tea&quot;, in April 2006. In interviews they stated that the album was influenced by the sound of synthpop group Devo, and Eleanor Friedberger stated the album was &quot;definitely the poppiest thing we&#x27;ve done.&quot;

Matthew Friedberger released &quot;Winter Women and Holy Ghost Language School&quot; in August 2006, two separate albums which were packaged as a double album. Eleanor appeared on neither album and Matthew did not tour in support of his solo releases.

The band did a short tour in October and November 2006, supported by San Francisco experimental rock band, Deerhoof. This tour saw Matthew on keyboard, Eleanor on vocals, Jason Loewenstein on wah-wah pedaled guitar, Bob D&#x27;Amico on drums and the addition of Michael Goodman on percussion. The songs had a tropical/salsa feel to them, and most of the tracks from &quot;Bitter Tea&quot; were played as one long song, lasting 30 minutes—a medley format the band previously used while promoting &quot;Blueberry Boat&quot;.

In June 2007, it was announced in The Chicago Reader that the band had signed with Chicago label Thrill Jockey and their album &quot;Widow City&quot; was later released on October 9, 2007. Unlike their two previous efforts, this album lacks a central concept and has a 70s album rock feel. The band toured in support of the album throughout the later months of 2007 and early 2008. A live compilation album, &quot;Remember&quot;, was released on August 16, 2008.

The band&#x27;s seventh studio album &quot;I&#x27;m Going Away&quot; was released in the US on July 21, 2009, on Thrill Jockey and the UK on August 24, 2009. A second album, &quot;Take Me Round Again&quot;, which presents many of the same songs from &quot;I&#x27;m Going Away&quot; in a new way, was released on November 10, 2009. These tracks were made individually by Mathew and Eleanor, resulting in some overlap. These songs have the same lyrics as &quot;I&#x27;m Going Away&quot;, but consist of completely new instrument and vocal recordings that give a new take on the same material.

===Hiatus===
The Fiery Furnaces went on an extended hiatus following a brief 2011 tour. Their final concert before the hiatus was on May 27, 2011 at the Primavera Sound Festival in Barcelona. Since then, each of the siblings has focused on their solo careers, with Matthew releasing a vinyl box set entitled &quot;Solos&quot; in 2011, and Eleanor releasing her first solo album, titled &quot;Last Summer&quot;, on July 12, 2011.

===Return===
In early 2020, The Fiery Furnaces announced they would be performing at the Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago that July, their first live show in nearly a decade. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic the event was cancelled.
They ended up performing at the Pitchfork Music Festival in 2021.

It was later revealed that the band signed to Jack White&#x27;s Third Man Records label.

The band returned on 18 June 2020 with a new single, &quot;Down at the So and So on Somewhere&quot;, the single received praise from Pitchfork, RollingStone, The Guardian, Uncut, and other publications.

<text>The figurine, also called the Lion-man of, is a prehistoric ivory sculpture discovered in Hohlenstein-Stadel, a German cave, part of the Caves and Ice Age Art in the Swabian Jura UNESCO World Heritage Site, in 1939. The German name, , meaning &quot;lion-person&quot; or &quot;lion-human&quot;, is used most frequently because it was discovered and is exhibited in Germany. It is an anthropomorphic figurine combining a human-like body with the head of a cave lion.

Determined by carbon dating of the layer in which it was found to be between 35,000 and 41,000 years old, it is one of the oldest-known examples of an artistic representation and the oldest confirmed statue ever discovered. Its age associates it with the archaeological Aurignacian culture of the Upper Paleolithic. An example of zoomorphic art, it was carved out of mammoth ivory using a flint stone knife. Seven parallel, transverse, carved gouges are on the left arm.

After several reconstructions that have incorporated newly found fragments, the figurine stands tall, wide, and thick. It is currently displayed in the Museum Ulm, in the city of Ulm.

==History==
Systematic excavations at Hohlenstein-Stadel cave began in 1937 under the direction of historian Robert Wetzel. 

The discovery of a fragmented mammoth ivory figurine was made on 25 August 1939 by geologist Otto Völzing. The start of World War 2 just one week later meant that the fieldwork was left incomplete and analysis of the finds was not undertaken. The excavation trenches were back-filled with the same soil in which the ivory had been found. For approximately thirty years, the fragments lay forgotten at the nearby Museum Ulm. It was not until archaeologist Joachim Hahn started an inventory and assembly of more than 200 fragments that a figurine with animal and human features began to emerge.

Wetzel continued to spend summers digging at the site until 1961, and further finds of ivory were made on the cave floor in the 1970s. In 1982, paleontologist Elisabeth Schmid combined the new fragments with Hahn&#x27;s reconstruction, correcting some errors and adding pieces of the nose and mouth which emphasized the figurine&#x27;s feline characteristics.

In 1987, a comprehensive restoration began in the workshops of the Landesmuseum Württemberg by Ute Wolf in cooperation with Schmid. During the work, which took more than six months, it was realized that the figurine was only about two-thirds complete. The back was severely damaged and the legs were missing some ivory lamellae. The ears, eye-holes, two-thirds of the mouth and nose, and the back of the head were preserved. To fill gaps in the head and body, a reversible substance consisting of a mixture of beeswax, artificial wax, and chalk was used.

From 2008, further excavations were carried out in the cave. All layers were sifted systematically, which led to many minute fragments being discovered. The first new adjustments were simulated virtually so that fragments could be added without having to disassemble the original recreation.

In 2012, a second restoration was begun in the workshops of the State Office for the Preservation of Historical Monuments in Esslingen under the leadership of Nicole Ebinger-Rist. The figurine was disassembled into its individual parts and newly discovered fragments were added along with the old ones, allowing further completion of areas of the head, back, and right side of the body, and artificial additions used during the first restoration were discarded. The figurine grew in height from 296 to 311 millimetres. Work was completed in late 2013.

==Interpretation==
Some researchers have ascribed sexual characteristics to the object. Initially, the figurine was classified as male by Hahn who suggested a plate on the abdomen could be a flaccid penis. Schmid later classified this feature as a pubic triangle; however, from examination of new parts of the sculpture, she proposed that the figurine was that of a woman with the head of a female cave lion (&quot;Panthera spelaea&quot;). Male European cave lions appear to have largely or completely lacked the distinctive manes of their African counterparts, so the absence of a mane could not determine categorically that the figurine was that of a lioness, and a debate about its sex ensued among some involved in the research and the popular press. Kurt Wehrberger, of the Museum Ulm, stated that the statue had become an &quot;icon of the feminist movement&quot;.

After the 2012–2013 restoration, it was realized that the triangular platelet in the genital area was processed all around, separating it from the figurine. A fracture point suggests that originally it may have been square in shape, which most commonly could be interpreted as a stylized male sex organ. Debate continues, even though an objective determination of the sex of the figurine may be impossible.

The figurine lay in a chamber almost from the entrance of the Stadel cave, accompanied by many other objects. Bone tools and worked antlers were found, along with jewellery consisting of pendants, beads, and perforated animal teeth. The chamber was probably a special place, possibly used as a storehouse, hiding-place, or maybe as an area for cultic rituals.

A similar but smaller lion-headed human figurine was found in Hohle Fels. Archaeologist Nicholas Conard suggested that &quot;the occupants of Hohle Fels in the Ach Valley and Hohlenstein-Stadel in the Lone Valley must have been members of the same cultural group and shared beliefs and practices connected with therianthropic images of felids and humans&quot; and that &quot;the discovery of a second lends support to the hypothesis that Aurignacian people practised a form of shamanism.&quot;

The figurine shares certain similarities with later French cave paintings, which also show hybrid creatures with human-like lower bodies and animal heads, such as the &quot;Sorcerer&quot; from the Trois Frères in the Pyrenees or the &quot;Bison-man&quot; from the Grotte de Gabillou in the Dordogne.

Debate exists as to whether the figurine depicts a lion or human-lion hybrid figure at all; with similarities to a standing bear, and the unreliable nature of the reconstructions cited.

==Manufacture==
The carving of the figurine from hard mammoth tusk would have been a complex and time-consuming task. A similarly sized tusk found in the same cave has marks that &quot;indicate that the skin and thin bone around the tooth cavity of the upper jaw were cut through to the surface of the tooth, which was then exposed for detachment with a hammer. The tip was harder and had to be removed by wedging and splitting.&quot;

Wulf Hein and Kurt Wehrberger conducted an experimental replication with the kinds of stone tool available at the time. Removing the base of the tusk took ten hours. The body was carved with a steep-fronted scraper; the burins requiring regular resharpening. Several tools were needed to separate the torso from the insides of the arms while shaping the head and shoulders, which involved difficult cutting across the grain of the ivory, often requiring two hands on the tool. The basic shaping is estimated to have taken around 200 hours, and in total the recreation likely took more than 370 hours. Jill Cook, Curator of Palaeolithic collections at the British Museum, suggests that &quot;unless the sculpture was created slowly at odd moments over several months, someone as skilled as an artist may have been excused from other subsistence tasks to work specially on this piece.&quot;

In his October 2017 BBC Radio 4 series &quot;Living with the Gods&quot;, Neil MacGregor asked Cook
... so why would a community living on the edge of subsistence, whose primary concerns were finding food, keeping that fire going, protecting children from predators, allow someone to spend so much time away from those tasks?

She replied that it was about
... a relationship to things unseen, to the vital forces of nature, that you need to perhaps propitiate, perhaps connect to, in order to ensure your successful life.

<doc id="1027322" wikidata="Q1142296" url="?curid=1027322" title="The Zutons">
<text>The Zutons are an English indie rock band formed in Liverpool, in 2002. The band currently consists of Dave McCabe (vocals, guitar), Sean Payne (drums), Abi Harding (saxophone), Jay Lewis (guitar), Neil Bradley (keyboards) and Tim Cunningham (bass).

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Who Killed... The Zutons?&quot;, was released in April 2004. With the release of their second studio album, &quot;Tired of Hanging Around&quot; (2006), the band achieved UK chart success with the singles, &quot;Why Won&#x27;t You Give Me Your Love?&quot; and &quot;Valerie&quot;, both of which reached number 9 on the UK Singles Chart.

Founding guitarist Boyan Chowdhury left the band in 2007 and was replaced by Paul Molloy for their third studio album, &quot;You Can Do Anything&quot;, which was released in June 2008. The band quietly disbanded the following year in 2009, and briefly reunited in 2016 for a one-off performance with Chowdhury, billed as &quot;probably [their] last ever performance&quot; in remembrance of their friend, actor and former Tramp Attack frontman, Kristian Ealey. 

In November 2018, the band announced a full reunion tour to commemorate and perform their debut album, with Jay Lewis of Cast and The La&#x27;s replacing founding bass guitarist Russell Pritchard. Following the tour&#x27;s completion, the band remained together, with Chowdhury eventually departing again in 2022.

After a sixteen-year gap between studio albums, the band released their fourth studio album, &quot;The Big Decider&quot;, in April 2024. The album was produced by Nile Rodgers, Ian Broudie of the Lightning Seeds, and drummer Sean Payne. It reached number seven on the UK Albums Chart.

==History==
===Formation===
The Zutons formed in Liverpool in 2001, taking their name from Captain Beefheart&#x27;s Magic Band guitarist Zoot Horn Rollo. McCabe had previously been in the band Tramp Attack. Both Pritchard and Payne were members of Edgar Jones&#x27; post Stairs band The Big Kids (with Sean&#x27;s brother Howie Payne of The Stands). The band was originally a four-piece, before Payne&#x27;s girlfriend Abi Harding began joining The Zutons on stage for a couple of songs mid-set, playing simple saxophone lines. The other band members liked the way her saxophone enhanced their sound and Harding became a full member, contributing vocals and sax.

Deltasonic head Alan Wills was initially dubious about the musical talents of McCabe: &quot;I&#x27;d heard other bands Jay had played in and I thought they were all rubbish&quot;. The Coral&#x27;s James Skelly was persistent in trying to convince Wills of his friend&#x27;s potential and the breakthrough finally came when the bedroom demos of the newly formed Zutons persuaded the Deltasonic head into working with them.

At first, the band had to battle comparisons to The Coral. Both bands were Merseyside bands prominent in the Liverpool music scene; were on the same record label; shared the same producer, Ian Broudie; and were good friends, with McCabe having previously written songs with James Skelly. The band&#x27;s music has proved difficult to categorize, being described as &quot;psychedelic cartoon punk&quot;. McCabe, who is also the lead songwriter, includes amongst his influences Talking Heads, Devo, Sly &amp; the Family Stone, Dexys Midnight Runners, Sublime and Madness.

===Early singles and &quot;Who Killed... The Zutons?&quot; (2002–2005)===
The first record the band put out was the 3-track CD &quot;Devil&#x27;s Deal&quot;, released in September 2002. The following spring they released &quot;Creepin&#x27; and a Crawlin&#x27;,&quot; and then the download-only single &quot;Haunts Me&quot; in November 2003. The band&#x27;s &quot;Z&quot; logo was changed early in 2004 to avoid confusion with the Zenith logo.

The Zutons&#x27; debut album, &quot;Who Killed... The Zutons?&quot;, was released in April 2004, and initially reached No. 13 in the UK album chart. However, after nearly a year, it moved up to No. 9 in early 2005. The LP had a specially printed 3-D cover and came with Zutons 3-D viewing glasses, which many fans then wore to their concerts. Early copies of the album also included a bonus 4-track CD of alternative versions of their songs. The album was critically acclaimed and was a nominee for the 2004 Mercury Music Prize. The band themselves were nominated for the British Breakthrough Act award at the 2005 BRIT Awards. The album was later re-issued following the single &quot;Don&#x27;t Ever Think (Too Much)&quot;, with that song being added as track 13. The track &quot;Confusion&quot; was used in a Peugeot 307 car advert in the UK during 2004-2005.

===&quot;Tired of Hanging Around&quot; (2006–2007)===
The new album &quot;Tired of Hanging Around&quot; was released on 17 April 2006 and reached No. 2 in the UK album charts. The first two singles from the album, &quot;Why Won&#x27;t You Give Me Your Love?&quot; and &quot;Valerie&quot;, both peaked at 9 in the UK charts, a fair achievement considering their highest place previously had been with the single &quot;Don&#x27;t Ever Think (Too Much)&quot; at 15. The band toured the UK in May 2006 following the release of this album. They played at the Jersey Live Festival on 2 September 2006 before their second UK tour, which began in November 2006. In October 2006, they performed at The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball. On New Year&#x27;s Eve 2006, the Zutons appeared on Jools Holland&#x27;s annual &quot;Hootenanny&quot; on BBC television, on which they performed their songs &quot;Valerie&quot;, &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Give Me Your Love?&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s The Little Things We Do.&quot;

As the November tour began, the band gave an interview to STV discussing songwriting, making videos and their American dates with The Killers. In a separate interview, Payne complained about the tendency of music writers and magazines to generalise a particular city as the breeding ground of new &#x27;movements&#x27;, &quot;A lot of bands get lumped in when they&#x27;re in the same neck of the woods and journalists–especially in England–like to make a big deal out of that and make it into a scene, as if the individual bands aren&#x27;t good enough to write about.&quot;

The band announced on 13 July 2007 that guitarist Boyan Chowdhury had left The Zutons, citing &quot;musical differences&quot;. In late 2007, Paul Molloy, formerly of The Skylarks and The Stands, joined the band.

===&quot;You Can Do Anything&quot; and split (2008–2009)===
The band released their third studio album, titled &quot;You Can Do Anything&quot;, on 2 June 2008. It was the band&#x27;s first album to feature Molloy on lead guitar. The first single was &quot;Always Right Behind You&quot;, which was released on 26 May 2008. The album was recorded earlier in the year in Los Angeles, California. On 17 May 2008, The Zutons appeared on Soccer AM as guest stars. They performed &quot;Always Right Behind You&quot; at the end to celebrate the last show of the season. In the summer of 2008, The Zutons had their first UK tour in 2 years. They were scheduled to play seven gigs in forest settings as part of The Forestry Commission&#x27;s Forest Tour.

On 26 July 2008, The Zutons performed at Japan&#x27;s Fuji Rock Festival for a third time. On 30 August 2008, the band appeared at the indie festival Jersey Live, headlining the festival along with The Prodigy. Over the 2008 Christmas holidays, the Zutons were dropped from Sony/BMG. Following a run of 2009 festival performances including Summer Sundae in Leicester and Wickerman Festival, the band quietly disbanded.

Chowdhury formed a new band, the Venus Fury, shortly after his departure from The Zutons. In May 2013, he collaborated with musician David South and scriptwriter Michelle Langan to produce &quot;Shoebox&quot;, a musical theatre play set in 1950s Liverpool. In 2016, Harding became the keyboardist and saxophonist for The Lightning Seeds, the band of the Zutons&#x27; former producer Ian Broudie.
===2016 continuation===
In April 2016, three members of the band, including original guitarist Chowdhury, performed at a tribute concert for the Warrington indie rock group Viola Beach, whose members had died earlier that year in a car accident in Sweden. On 23 June 2016, it was announced that the original line-up of the band would reform for a one-off gig at Mountford Hall, Liverpool, on 30 September 2016. A fundraiser in celebration of their friend, actor and former Tramp Attack frontman Kristian Ealey, who died earlier in the year. The show was billed as the band&#x27;s &quot;last ever&quot;. McCabe explained: &quot;I&#x27;m not against doing gigs as The Zutons, it&#x27;s the others who don&#x27;t want to keep doing it, and I understand why. With two of them it&#x27;s personal issues and Russ plays with Noel Gallagher.&quot; He also revealed that the band almost reformed in 2014 to mark the tenth anniversary of the band&#x27;s debut album but that, &quot;if The Zutons were ever to reform properly, I don&#x27;t think it would be the original line-up&quot;.

In November 2018, the band announced a reunion tour to play &quot;Who Killed... The Zutons?&quot; on its 15th anniversary. While original members , Boyan Chowdhury, Sean Payne and Abi Harding were all on board, Russell Pritchard confirmed via social media that he was not taking part in the reunion tour. In place of Pritchard, Cast member Jay Lewis was recruited to play bass.

On 27 July 2021, the band announced via their Twitter page that they were to support Nile Rodgers on one of the UK dates of his tour. They also confirmed that Rodgers would be producing the band&#x27;s fourth studio album. On 24 October, they posted a photo with Rodgers at Abbey Road Studios while working on their fourth album. In November 2023, the band announced that their fourth studio album, &quot;The Big Decider&quot;, would be released on 26 April 2024. The new album announcement was accompanied by news that the band was to play a series of 22 UK gigs in smaller venues from late January to March 2024. Strong sales for these shows led to the tour being extended with 11 more UK appearances throughout April at larger venues.

<text>No. 7 Squadron is a special operations support squadron of the Royal Air Force operates the Boeing Chinook HC6 from RAF Odiham, Hampshire.

==History==

===Formation and early years===
No. 7 Squadron was formed at Farnborough Airfield on 1 May 1914 as the last squadron of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) to be formed before the First World War, but has been disbanded and reformed several times since, the first being after only three months of existence, the latter as early as 28 September 1914. The squadron spent most of the First World War in observation and interception roles and was responsible for the first ever interception of an enemy aircraft over Britain.

No 7 Squadron deployed to France in April 1915, flying Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.5s for reconnaissance and Vickers Gunbuses as escort fighters. Captain John Aidan Liddell of 7 Squadron won the Victoria Cross for his actions on 31 July 1915, when he continued his reconnaissance mission over Belgium after the aircraft was hit by ground fire, the aircraft being badly damaged and Liddell suffering a broken thigh. Although he successfully recovered the R.E.5 to allied lines, saving his observer, he died of his wounds a month later.

The squadron re-equipped with B.E.2s in 1916, which it used for both bombing and reconnaissance during the Battle of the Somme that year. The B.E.2s were replaced by R.E.8s in July 1917, continuing in the reconnaissance role for the rest of the war, operating in Ypres during the Battle of Passchendaele in the summer and autumn of 1917 and in support of Belgium forces in the closing months of the war. It disbanded at the end of 1919.

===To Bomber Command===
It re-formed at RAF Bircham Newton on 1 June 1923 with the Vickers Vimy as a night heavy bomber squadron, continuing in this role with a succession of types through the inter-war period. It started to receive the Vickers Virginia bomber on 22 May 1924, being the first RAF Squadron to operate Virginias, although it did not dispose of the last of its Vimys until April 1927. In 1927 it moved to RAF Worthy Down, commanded by Charles Portal, later to become Chief of the Air Staff during the Second World War. In 1932, Frederick Higginson, who became a fighter ace in the Second World War, was assigned as a mechanic-gunner to the squadron.

The squadron gained a reputation as being one of the leading RAF heavy bomber squadrons, winning the Lawrence Minot Memorial Bombing Trophy six times between 1927 and 1933 and shared in 1934 with 54 Squadron, achieving an average bombing error of 40 yards (37 m). By this time, the elderly Virginia was obsolete and in April 1935 they were replaced by the more modern Handley Page Heyford, with which the squadron won the Lawrence Minot trophy yet again in 1935. Part of the squadron was split off in October 1935 to form No. 102 Squadron, while the remainder moved to RAF Finningley in September 1936. In April 1937 the squadron received four Vickers Wellesleys to equip a flight which was again split off to form 76 Squadron.

In March 1938 it replaced its Heyford biplanes with monoplanes from Armstrong Whitworth Whitley . It re-equipped again in April 1939, with Handley Page Hampden bombers replacing the Whitleys. In June 1939 it became a training unit, preparing crews for the Hampden equipped 5 Group.

===Second World War===

On the outbreak of the Second World War, it continued to be used for training bomber crews, disbanding on 4 April 1940 when it merged with 76 Squadron to form No. 16 OTU. On 1 August 1940 it reformed, becoming the first squadron to equip with the new Short Stirling heavy bomber, the first RAF squadron to operate four engined bombers during the Second World War, flying the first bombing raids with the Stirling against oil storage tanks near Rotterdam on the night of 10/11 February 1941. It flew on the 1000 bomber raids to Cologne, Essen and Bremen in May and June 1942. It was transferred to the Pathfinder Force in August 1942, with the job of finding and marking targets for the Main Force of Bomber Command bombers.

The squadron re-equipped with the Avro Lancaster from 11 May 1943, flying its first mission with the Lancaster on 12 July 1943. It continued in the Pathfinder role until the end of the war in Europe. It flew its last bomber mission on 25 April 1945 against Wangerooge, and dropped food to starving civilians in the Netherlands in May. While it was planned to fly 7 Squadron out to the Far East to join Tiger Force for air attacks against Japan, the war ended before the squadron was due to move. The squadron carried out 5,060 operational sorties with the loss of 165 aircraft.

===Post-war===
After World War II it was equipped with Avro Lincoln bombers, an update of the Lancaster. Based at RAF Upwood, the Lincoln was for several years the front line Cold War bomber aircraft. It was used in the Malayan emergency, the Middle East, the Trucial States (the Emirates) and then Aden. The squadron disbanded on 2 January 1956 before reforming with the Vickers Valiant at RAF Honington in Suffolk in December that year, flying them in the Strategic Bomber role until disbanding in 1962. 7 Squadron was eventually reformed in 1970, this time as a target squadron flying the English Electric Canberra until January 1982.

The squadron reformed in the Support Helicopter role, receiving Chinooks HC.1s in September 1982. The Chinook HC.2, equivalent to the US Army CH-47D standard, began to enter RAF service in 1993. Following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, 7 Squadron took part in the UK&#x27;s deployment to the Gulf in 1991.

On 2 June 1994, a 7 Squadron Chinook HC.2 (ZD576) crashed into the Mull of Kintyre while carrying 25 senior members of the British security forces from RAF Aldergrove, Belfast to Inverness. All passengers and the four crew were killed. In April 2001, 7 Squadron RAF became part of the Joint Special Forces Aviation Wing (JSFAW) with a role to support the United Kingdom Special Forces. On 19 August 2009, a Chinook made an emergency landing in Afghanistan after being hit by a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG).

In March 2020, the squadron was awarded the right to emblazon battle honours on its squadron standard, recognising its role in the British military intervention in Sierra Leone in 2000 and the War in Afghanistan between 2001 and 2014.

<text>The Gold Star Wives of America (Gold Star Spouses) (GSW) is a private nonprofit organization formed before the end of World War II that provides support for surviving spouses and children of those who lost their lives due to military service Armed Forces of the United States.

== History ==

In March 1929, the Congress passed a law to offer financial compensations to mothers and wives of soldiers killed on the field. From 1930 to 1933, the government paid for more than 6,000 Gold Star mothers and wives to go to Europe to pray onsite for their lost ones.

The first meeting took place on April 5, 1945, when four young widows met in Marie Jordan&#x27;s apartment on West 20th Street in New York City. One week later, President Franklin D. Roosevelt died, and shortly thereafter, Eleanor Roosevelt joined the organization. Mrs. Roosevelt attended meetings, wrote about the organization in her &quot;My Day&quot; column, entertained children of Gold Star Wives at a picnic at her home in Hyde Park, New York, served on the first board of directors, and was one of the original 15 signers when the organization was chartered as a non-profit organization in the State of New York in December 1945. The group holds a congressional charter under Title 36 of the United States Code under Public Law 96-497.

From the outset, the organization sponsored a variety of activities for the children, and guided them as they formed their own auxiliary of the organization called the Gold Star Sons and Daughters.

Gold Star Wives groups were soon organized in other cities throughout the country, and were chartered as chapters of the Gold Star Wives of America, Inc.s The Korean War, Vietnam, the Gulf War, Afghanistan and Iraq brought in new groups of widows (widowers). Added to the survivors of service personnel killed in action are thousands who die each year from service-connected causes. Remarried widows are eligible for membership.

In 1980, the organization received its federal charter from Congress.

In 1947, the US Congress established the Gold Star label pin presented to spouses and families of service officers killed in combat.

A senate resolution created the Gold Star Wives Day, which was first celebrated on December 18, 2010.

== Description ==

There are members and local chapters throughout the United States. The country is divided into eight regions. Region conferences are held in the spring where recommendations originate for presentation to the national convention held each year, usually in July.

An Appreciation Award Reception is held in Washington, D.C. in late May honoring those who have shown that they have gratefully remembered those who gave their lives in the service of our country, and their survivors.

<text>The Mercury Theatre was an independent repertory theatre company founded in New York City in 1937 by Orson Welles and producer John Houseman. The company produced theatrical presentations, radio programs and motion pictures. The Mercury also released promptbooks and phonographic recordings of four Shakespeare works for use in schools.

After a series of acclaimed Broadway productions, the Mercury Theatre progressed into its most popular incarnation as &quot;The Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot;. The radio series included one of the most notable and infamous radio broadcasts of all time, &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, broadcast October 30, 1938. The &quot;Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot; produced live radio dramas in 1938–1940 and again briefly in 1946.

In addition to Welles, the Mercury players included Ray Collins, Joseph Cotten, George Coulouris, Martin Gabel, Norman Lloyd, Agnes Moorehead, Paul Stewart, and Everett Sloane. Much of the troupe would later appear in Welles&#x27;s films at RKO, particularly &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot;.

==Theatre==

Part of the Works Progress Administration, the Federal Theatre Project (1935–39) was a New Deal program to fund theatre and other live artistic performances and entertainment programs in the United States during the Great Depression. In 1935, John Houseman, director of the Negro Theatre Unit in New York, invited his recent collaborator, 20-year-old Orson Welles, to join the project. Their first production was an adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; with an entirely African-American cast. It became known as the &quot;Voodoo Macbeth&quot; because Welles changed the setting to a mythical island suggesting the Haitian court of King Henri Christophe, with Haitian &quot;vodou&quot; fulfilling the rôle of Scottish witchcraft. The play opened April 14, 1936, at the Lafayette Theatre in Harlem and was received rapturously.

That production was followed by an adaptation of the farce &quot;Horse Eats Hat&quot; and, in 1937, Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; and Marc Blitzstein&#x27;s socialist musical &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot;. The latter received much publicity when on the eve of its preview the theatre was padlocked by the WPA. Welles invited the waiting audience to walk several blocks to a neighboring theatre where the show was performed without sets or costumes. Blitzstein played a battered upright piano while the cast, barred from taking the stage by their union, sat in the audience and rose from their seats to sing and deliver their dialogue.

Welles and Houseman broke with the Federal Theatre Project in August 1937 and founded their own repertory company, which they called the Mercury Theatre. The name was inspired by the title of the iconoclastic magazine, &quot;The American Mercury&quot;.

&quot;All the Mercury offerings bore the credit line, &#x27;Production by Orson Welles,&#x27;&quot; wrote critic Richard France, &quot;implying that he functioned not only as the director, but as designer, dramatist, and, most often, principal actor as well. To be sure, this generated a good bit of resentment among his collaborators (the designers, in particular). However, in a more profound sense, that credit is, in fact, the only accurate description of a Welles production. The concepts that animated each of them originated with him and, moreover, were executed in such a way as to be subject to his absolute control.&quot;

Welles and Houseman secured the Comedy Theatre, a 687-seat Broadway theatre at 110 West 41st Street in New York City, and reopened it as the Mercury Theatre. It was the venue for virtually all their productions from November 1937 through November 1938.

===&quot;Caesar&quot; (1937–38)===
The Mercury Theatre began with a groundbreaking, critically acclaimed adaption of &quot;The Tragedy of Julius Caesar&quot; that evoked comparison to contemporary Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. It premiered on Broadway on November 11, 1937.

The production moved from the Mercury Theatre to the larger National Theatre on January 24, 1938. It ran through May 28, 1938, for a total of 157 performances.

The cast included Joseph Holland (Julius Caesar), George Coulouris (Marcus Antonius), Joseph Cotten (Publius), Martin Gabel (Cassius), Hiram Sherman (Casca), John A. Willard (Trebonius), Grover Burgess (Ligarius), John Hoysradt (Decius Brutus), Stefan Schnabel (Metellus Cimber), Elliott Reid (Cinna), William Mowry (Flavius), William Alland (Marullus), George Duthie (Artemidorus), Norman Lloyd (Cinna, the poet), Arthur Anderson (Lucius), Evelyn Allen (Calpurnia, wife to Caesar), Muriel Brassler (Portia, wife to Brutus), and John Berry (extra). At the National Theatre, Polly Rowles took the role of Calpurnia and Alice Frost played Portia.

From January 20, 1938, a roadshow version of &quot;Caesar&quot; with a different cast toured the United States. The company included Tom Powers as Brutus, and Edmond O&#x27;Brien as Marc Antony.

===&quot;The Shoemaker&#x27;s Holiday&quot; (1938)===

The Mercury Theatre&#x27;s second production was a staging of Thomas Dekker&#x27;s Elizabethan comedy &quot;The Shoemaker&#x27;s Holiday&quot;, which attracted &quot;unanimous raves again&quot;. It premiered on January 1, 1938, and ran to 64 performances in repertory with &quot;Caesar&quot;, until April 1. It then moved to the National Theatre through April 28.

===&quot;Heartbreak House&quot; (1938)===

The first season of the Mercury Theatre concluded with George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Heartbreak House&quot;, which again attracted strong reviews. It premiered April 29, 1938, at the Mercury Theatre and ran for six weeks, closing June 11. Shaw insisted that none of the text be altered or cut, resulting in a longer and more conventional production that limited Welles&#x27;s creative expression. It was chosen to demonstrate that the Mercury&#x27;s style did not depend upon extensive revision and elaborate staging.

Geraldine Fitzgerald, a fellow member of the Gate Theatre company while Welles was in Dublin, was brought over from Ireland for her American debut as Ellie Dunn. Welles played the octogenarian Captain Shotover. Other cast were Brenda Forbes (Nurse Guinness), Phyllis Joyce (Lady Utterword), Mady Christians (Hesione Hushabye), Erskine Sanford (Mazzini Dunn), Vincent Price (Hector Hushabye), John Hoysradt (Randall Utterword) and Eustace Wyatt (The Burglar)

===&quot;Too Much Johnson&quot; (1938)===
The fourth Mercury Theatre play was planned to be a staging of &quot;Too Much Johnson&quot;, an 1894 comedy by William Gillette. The production is now remembered for Welles&#x27;s filmed sequences, one of his earliest films. There were to be three sequences: a 20-minute introduction, and 10-minute sequences transitioning into the second and third acts.

The production was meant to be a summer show on Broadway in 1938, but technical problems (the Mercury Theatre in New York was not yet adequately equipped to project the film segments) meant that it had to be postponed. It was due to run in repertory with &quot;Danton&#x27;s Death&quot; in the fall of 1938, but after that production suffered from numerous budgetary over-runs, a New York run of &quot;Too Much Johnson&quot; was abandoned altogether. The play ran for a two-week trial at the Stony Creek Summer Theatre, Stony Creek, Connecticut, from August 16, 1938, in a scaled-back version which never made use of the filmed sequences.

Long considered lost, the footage for &quot;Too Much Johnson&quot; was rediscovered in 2013.

===&quot;Danton&#x27;s Death&quot; (1938)===

A production of Georg Büchner 1835 play &quot;Danton&#x27;s Death&quot;, about the French Revolution, was the next Mercury stage production. It opened on November 2, 1938, but met with limited success and only ran to 21 performances, closing November 19. The commercial failure of this play forced the Mercury to significantly scale back on the number of plays planned for their 1938–39 season. &quot;Danton&#x27;s Death&quot; was the last Mercury production at the Mercury Theatre, which had been leased until 1942. The company relinquished the theatre in June 1939.

===&quot;Five Kings (Part One)&quot; (1939)===

The final full-length Mercury production before the troupe headed to Hollywood in 1939 was &quot;Five Kings (Part One)&quot;. This was an entirely original play by Welles about Sir John Falstaff, which was created by mixing and re-arranging dialogue from five different Shakespeare plays (primarily taken from &quot;Henry IV, Part I&quot;, &quot;Henry IV, Part II&quot;, and &quot;Henry V&quot;, but also using elements of &quot;Richard II&quot; and &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;), to form a wholly new narrative. It opened on February 27, 1939, at the Colonial Theatre, Boston, in a five-hour version playing from 8pm to 1am. As the title suggests, the play was intended to be the first of a two-part production, but although it opened in three other cities, poor box-office receipts meant that plan had to be abandoned, and &quot;Five Kings (Part One)&quot; never played in New York, while &quot;Five Kings (Part Two)&quot; was never produced at all.

&quot;Five Kings&quot; was an intensely personal project for Welles, who would revive a substantially rewritten version of the play (retitled &quot;Chimes at Midnight&quot;) in Belfast and Dublin in 1960, and would eventually make a film of it, which he came to regard as his favourite of his own films.

===&quot;The Green Goddess&quot; (1939)===
In July and August 1939, after having signed a contract with the RKO film studio, the Mercury Theatre toured the RKO Vaudeville Theatre circuit with an abbreviated, twenty-minute production of the William Archer melodrama &quot;The Green Goddess&quot;, five minutes of which took the form of a film insert. The show was performed as often as four times a day.

===&quot;Native Son&quot; (1941)===
The Mercury Theatre had moved to Hollywood late in 1939, after Welles signed a film contract which would eventually result in his debut, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, in 1941. In the intervening period, the troupe focused on their radio show, which had begun in 1938 and continued until March 1940. Their last full play after moving to Hollywood was a stage adaptation of Richard Wright&#x27;s anti-racism novel &quot;Native Son&quot;. It opened at the St. James&#x27;s Theatre, New York, on March 24, 1941 (just a month before &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; premiered), and received excellent reviews, running to 114 performances. This was the final Mercury production which Welles and Houseman collaborated upon.

&quot;The Mercury Theatre was killed by lack of funds and our subsequent move to Hollywood,&quot; Welles told friend and mentor Roger Hill in a conversation June 20, 1983. &quot;All of the money I had made on radio was spent on the Mercury, but I didn&#x27;t make enough money to finance the entire operation. Hollywood was really the only choice. … I think all acting companies have a lifespan. My partnership with John Houseman came to an end with the move to California. He became my employee, expensive and not particularly pleasant or productive. Our mutual discomfort led to his decamping California and returning to New York.&quot;

===&quot;The Mercury Wonder Show&quot; (1943)===

Although the Mercury troupe technically dissolved either in 1941 (when Welles and Houseman parted) or 1942 (when the entire Mercury unit was sacked by RKO - see below), Welles produced and directed this morale-boosting variety show for US troops in 1943, featuring a number of Mercury actors including Joseph Cotten and Agnes Moorehead. The show was based in a 2,000-seater tent on Cahuenga Boulevard, Hollywood, where it ran for a month from August 3, 1943, before touring nationwide.

==Radio==
===&quot;The Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot; (1938)===
By 1938, Orson Welles had already worked extensively in radio drama, becoming a regular on &quot;The March of Time&quot;, directing a seven-part adaptation of Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, and playing the title character in &quot;The Shadow&quot; for a year, as well as a number of uncredited character roles.

After the theatrical successes of the Mercury Theatre, CBS Radio invited Welles to create a summer show. The series began on July 11, 1938, with the formula that Welles would play the lead in each show. .

Welles insisted his Mercury company — actors and crew — be involved in the radio series. This was an unprecedented and expensive request, especially for one so young as Welles. Most episodes dramatized works of classic and contemporary literature. It remains perhaps the most highly regarded radio drama anthology series ever broadcast, most likely due to the creativity of Orson Welles.

&quot;The Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot; was an hour-long program. Houseman wrote the early scripts for the series, turning the job over to Howard E. Koch at the beginning of October. Music for the program was composed and conducted by Bernard Herrmann. Their first radio production was Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;, with Welles playing both Count Dracula and Doctor Seward. Other adaptations included &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, &quot;The Thirty-Nine Steps&quot;, &quot;The Man Who Was Thursday&quot; and &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;.

Originally scheduled for nine weeks, the network extended the run into the autumn, moving the show from its Monday night slot, where it was the summer substitute for the &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot;, to a Sunday night slot opposite Edgar Bergen&#x27;s popular variety show.

The early dramas in the series were praised by critics, but ratings were low. A single broadcast changed the program&#x27;s ratings: the October 30, 1938 adaptation of H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;. Possibly thousands of listeners thought Martians were in fact invading the earth, due to the faux-news quality of most of the broadcast. Significant publicity was generated, and &quot;The Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot; quickly became one of radio&#x27;s top-rated shows. The notoriety of &quot;The &#x27;War of the Worlds&quot; had a welcome side effect of netting the show the sponsorship of Campbell&#x27;s Soup, guaranteeing its survival for a period, and beginning on December 9, 1938, the show was retitled &quot;The Campbell Playhouse&quot;.

===&quot;The Campbell Playhouse&quot; (1938–1940)===

The Mercury Theatre continued broadcasting 60-minute episodes in 1938–40, now sponsored by Campbell&#x27;s Soup and punctuated by commercials. The company moved to Hollywood for their second season, and Hollywood stars began to be featured in guest roles. The programme was billed as &quot;The Campbell Playhouse presents the Mercury Theatre&quot;. A full list of the 56 episodes can be found at &quot;The Campbell Playhouse&quot;.

&quot;The Campbell Playhouse&quot; briefly continued after Welles&#x27;s final performance in March 1940, with a truncated third season broadcast thereafter without the Mercury Theatre, but it was not a success.

===&quot;The Mercury Summer Theatre of the Air&quot; (1946)===

The Mercury troupe had disbanded by the time Welles made this series, commonly known as &quot;The Mercury Summer Theatre&quot;, in the summer of 1946. Nonetheless, it carried the Mercury name, was produced, written, directed and presented by Welles (and often starred or co-starred him), and it combined abridged scriptings of old Mercury performances with new shows. Occasionally, former members of the troupe would guest star in the 30-minute program. The series had limited success, it only lasted 15 episodes, and it was not renewed for a further season.

==Film==
===Move to Hollywood===
Orson Welles&#x27;s notoriety following &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; broadcast earned him Hollywood&#x27;s interest, and RKO studio head George J. Schaefer&#x27;s unusual contract. Welles made a deal with Schaefer on July 21, 1939, to produce, direct, write, and act in three feature films. (The number of films was later changed - see below.) The studio had to approve the story and the budget if it exceeded $500,000. Welles was allowed to develop the story without interference, cast his own actors and crew members, and have the privilege of final cut, unheard of at the time for a first-time director. (Welles later claimed that nobody in Hollywood had enjoyed this level of artistic freedom since Erich von Stroheim in the early 1920s.) Additionally, as part of his contract, he set up a &quot;Mercury Unit&quot; at RKO; containing most of the actors from the Mercury&#x27;s theatre and radio productions, as well as numerous technicians, (such as composer Bernard Herrmann), who were brought in from New York. Few of them had any film experience.

Welles spent the first five months of his RKO contract learning the basics of making films, and trying to get several projects going with no success. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said, &quot;They are laying bets over on the RKO lot that the Orson Welles deal will end up without Orson ever doing a picture there.&quot; First, Welles tried to adapt &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, but there was concern over the idea to depict it entirely with point of view shots, as Welles was unable to come up with an acceptable budget. Welles then considered adapting Cecil Day-Lewis&#x27; novel &quot;The Smiler with the Knife&quot;, but realized that this relatively straightforward pulp thriller was unlikely to make much impact for his film debut. He concluded that to challenge himself with a new medium, he had to write an original story.

===&quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941)===

As Welles decided on an original screenplay for his first film, he settled on a treatment he wrote, entitled &quot;American&quot;. In its first draft, it was only partially based on William Randolph Hearst, and also incorporated aspects of other tycoons such as Howard Hughes. However, &quot;American&quot; was heavily overlength, and Welles soon realized he would need an experienced co-writer to help redraft it—preferably one with experience of working with tycoons.

In 1940, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz was a former Hearst journalist recuperating from a car accident, and was in between jobs. He had originally been hired by Welles to work on &quot;The Campbell Playhouse&quot; radio program and was available to work on the screenplay for Welles&#x27;s film. The writer had only received two screenplay credits between 1935 and his work on &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and needed the job, his reputation having plummeted after he descended into alcoholism in the late 1930s. In the 1970s and 1980s, there was a dispute amongst historians regarding whose idea it was to use William Randolph Hearst as the basis for Charles Foster Kane. For some time, Mankiewicz had wanted to write a screenplay about a public figure, perhaps a gangster, whose story would be told by the people that knew him. Welles claimed it was his idea to write about Hearst, while film critic Pauline Kael (in her widely publicised 1971 essay &quot;Raising Kane&quot;) and Welles&#x27;s former business partner John Houseman claim that it was Mankiewicz&#x27;s idea. Kael further claimed that Welles had written nothing of the original script, and did not deserve a co-writer credit. However, in 1985, film historian Robert Carringer showed that Kael had only reached her conclusion by comparing the first and last drafts of the &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; script, whereas Carringer examined every intermediate draft by Mankiewicz and Welles, and concluded that a co-writer credit was justified, with each man writing between 40% and 60% of the script. He additionally concluded that Houseman&#x27;s claims to have contributed to the script were largely unfounded.

Mankiewicz had already written an unperformed play entitled, &quot;The Tree Will Grow&quot; about John Dillinger. Welles liked the idea of multiple viewpoints but was not interested in playing Dillinger. Mankiewicz and Welles talked about picking someone else to use a model. They hit on the idea of using Hearst as their central character. Mankiewicz had frequented Hearst&#x27;s parties until his alcoholism got him barred. The writer resented this and became obsessed with Hearst and Marion Davies. Hearst had great influence and the power to retaliate within Hollywood so Welles had Mankiewicz work on the script outside of the city. Because of the writer&#x27;s drinking problem, Houseman went along to provide assistance and make sure that he stayed focused. Welles also sought inspiration from Howard Hughes and Samuel Insull (who built an opera house for his girlfriend). Although Mankiewicz and Houseman got on well with Welles, they incorporated some of his traits into Kane, such as his temper.

During production, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; was referred to as &quot;RKO 281&quot;. Filming took place between June 29, 1940, and October 23, 1940, in what is now Stage 19 on the Paramount Pictures lot in Hollywood, and came in under schedule. Welles prevented studio executives of RKO from visiting the set. He understood their desire to control projects and he knew they were expecting him to do an exciting film that would correspond to his &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; radio broadcast. Welles&#x27;s RKO contract had given him complete control over the production of the film when he signed on with the studio, something that he never again was allowed to exercise when making motion pictures. According to an RKO cost sheet from May 1942, the film cost $839,727 compared to an estimated budget of $723,800.

When the film was released, pressure from William Randolph Hearst led to many cinemas refusing to screen it, and it was screened in so few places that RKO made a substantial loss on the film on its original release. As a consequence of this, Welles&#x27;s RKO contract was renegotiated, and he lost the right to control a film&#x27;s final cut—something which would have major consequences for his next film, &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons.&quot;

===&quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; (1942)===

Welles&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; was an adaptation of Booth Tarkington&#x27;s novel &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot;, a childhood favorite of his which he had already adapted for the radio. It portrayed the decline and fall of a proud Midwestern American family of the 19th century, as the motor car in the 20th century makes them obsolete.

Welles&#x27;s relations with RKO grew strained during the making of this film. His stock had fallen considerably after &quot;Kane&quot; had commercially flopped. Whereas studio head George Schaefer had given Welles &quot;carte blanche&quot; over &quot;Kane&quot;, he closely supervised &quot;Ambersons&quot;, sensing that his own position was in danger (which indeed it was - Schaefer was fired as head of RKO shortly after &quot;Ambersons&quot; was completed, and a commonly-attributed reason was for his having hired Welles with such a generous contract). RKO itself was in serious financial trouble, running a deficit.

Welles himself considered his original cut of &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; to have been one of his finest films - &quot;it was a much better picture than &quot;Kane&quot;&quot;. However, RKO panicked over a lukewarm preview screening in Pomona, California, when the film ran second in a double-bill with a romantic comedy. Around 55% of the audience strongly disliked the film (although the surviving audience feedback cards show that the remaining minority gave fulsome praise, using words such as &quot;masterpiece&quot; and &quot;cinematic art&quot;). Welles was in Brazil filming &quot;It&#x27;s All True&quot; (see below), so the studio decided to trim over 40 minutes of the film&#x27;s two-hour running time.

The first half of the film, portraying the happy times of the Ambersons in the 19th century, was largely unaffected. However, the vast majority of the second half of the film, portraying the Ambersons&#x27; fall from grace, was largely discarded as too depressing. Actors were drafted in for reshoots by other directors, who shot new scenes, including an upbeat, optimistic ending out of key with the rest of the film. The discarded 40 minutes of scenes by Welles were burned, and detailed, telegraphed instructions from him suggesting further compromises to save the film were thrown away, unread. This truncated version of &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; had a limited released in two Los Angeles cinemas in July 1942, where it did indifferently, and like &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, the film lost RKO hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Later in 1942, George Schaefer was dismissed as studio head. One of the first changes initiated by his successor, Charles Koerner, was to fire Welles from RKO, and his entire Mercury unit was removed from the studio and closed down.

===&quot;Journey into Fear&quot; (1943) and &quot;It&#x27;s All True&quot; (1942-1993)===

Welles&#x27;s RKO contract was renegotiated after the commercial failure of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. Instead of delivering three major &quot;A-pictures&quot; for the studio, Welles would instead deliver two, and would compensate for the high costs of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; by delivering two further films with lower budgets.

One of these was the straightforward espionage thriller &quot;Journey into Fear&quot;, based on a novel by Eric Ambler. Welles wrote and produced the film, but opted not to be the main director, not least as the film was on a tight schedule, filming back-to-back with &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot;. The project appealed to RKO, especially as it seemed to be a low-risk, low-budget film.

The other project was first suggested by David Rockefeller, and since Welles was qualified as medically unfit for war service, it was suggested he could render service to the war effort by making a film to encourage Pan-American sentiment, since the US State Department was worried about fascist sympathies in some Latin American countries. The film&#x27;s concept was loosely defined as an anthology of stories about different Americans being united against fascism, and it was hoped that a Pan-American song-and-dance number could be recorded. In February 1942, Brazil&#x27;s carnival season was rapidly approaching, so it was decided to quickly send Welles over with technicolour cameras to film the carnival, and he could decide how to use the film later.

Studio director Norman Foster was heavily involved in both projects. Officially, he was the sole director of &quot;Journey into Fear&quot;. However, studio documentation and photographs show Welles directing that film (often in costume for his supporting role as &quot;Colonel Haki&quot;), and fuelled by amphetamines, he was directing &quot;Ambersons&quot; in the day and &quot;Journey&quot; at night. He finished his &quot;Journey&quot; scenes in the small hours of the morning he left for Brazil, and Foster directed the rest of the film to Welles&#x27;s specific instructions. RKO found &quot;Journey into Fear&quot; too eccentric in its original form, and kept the film for a year before releasing it in 1943, by which time they had cut over twenty minutes. As with &quot;Ambersons&quot;, the excised footage was burned.

While Welles was in Brazil, he sent Foster to Mexico to direct one of the sequences of &quot;It&#x27;s All True&quot; (based on the short story &quot;My Friend Bonito&quot;, about a boy and his donkey), while he began to develop the rest of the film. As well as working his carnival footage into a sequence on the history of Samba, he filmed a sequence called &quot;Four raftmen&quot;, about an epic sea voyage undertaken by &quot;Jangedeiros&quot; fishermen to seek justice from Brazil&#x27;s president.

RKO rapidly turned against Welles and the &quot;It&#x27;s All True&quot; project. Film historian Catherine Benamou has argued, based on extensive work in the RKO archives, that racism was a major underlying factor, and that RKO was alarmed that Welles was choosing to make non-white Americans the heroes of his story. As well as ignoring his instructions while the studio recut &quot;Ambersons&quot; and &quot;Journey&quot;, they began issuing press releases attacking him for profligacy with studio funds, and accusing him of wasting his time in Brazil by attending lavish parties and drinking into the small hours (which he did - but fortified by amphetamines, he would also be the first to report for filming at 6am). When a filming accident resulted in one actor drowning, RKO cited this as an example of Welles&#x27;s irresponsibility. Finally, they ordered him to abandon the film. Not wishing to leave, Welles remained in Brazil with a skeleton crew which he funded himself, but eventually had to return when he ran out of film and RKO refused to send him any more.

After Welles was sacked in 1942, RKO had no plans for the &quot;It&#x27;s All True&quot; footage. Some of it was dumped in the Pacific Ocean. Welles tried to buy back the negative, convinced he could fashion &quot;It&#x27;s All True&quot; into a commercially successful film about samba, and he wrote the studio an &quot;IOU&quot; note for it, but when he could not afford the first installment on payments, the footage reverted to the studio. The footage was long presumed lost (though some of it was found again in 1985 and incorporated into a partial restoration in 1993), and Welles was unable to find a directing job for over three years, and even then, only for a formulaic low-budget thriller. In the meantime, the Mercury Theatre had disbanded for good.

===Later cinema===
The Mercury Theatre production team of John Houseman and Orson Welles separated during the making of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, but as the RKO Mercury unit retained its name until its removal from the studio in 1942. Since the Mercury Theatre name was not trademarked, Welles continued to use it for some of his subsequent projects. 

===Mercury Theatre actors in Welles&#x27;s films===
Welles cast a number of regular Mercury Theatre actors in his later films. Unless otherwise noted, information in this table is taken from &quot;Orson Welles at Work&quot; (2008) by Jean-Pierre Berthomé and Francois Thomas.
==Publishing and recording==
One book was released under the Mercury Theatre imprint, with accompanying sets of records:

*Orson Welles and Roger Hill, &quot;The Mercury Shakespeare&quot; (Harper and Row, New York, 1939)

This was in fact a revised omnibus version of three volumes released in 1934 under the umbrella title of &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Shakespeare&quot;, published by the 19-year-old Welles and his former school teacher &amp; lifelong friend Roger Hill, by the Todd Press, the imprint of the Todd School for Boys where Welles was a pupil and Hill became Headmaster. The book contained &quot;acting versions&quot; (i.e. abridgments) of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; and &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. Accompanying the book, the Mercury Theatre released three sets of specially-recorded 12-inch 78-RPM gramophone records of these plays. Each of the three plays filled up 11, 10 and 12 records respectively.

In addition to this, a great number of &quot;Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot; and &quot;Campbell Playhouse&quot; radio plays were subsequently turned into records, tapes and CDs, in many cases decades after their broadcast. For full details, see Orson Welles discography.

<doc id="1027329" wikidata="Q1263357" url="?curid=1027329" title="Ducati 916">
<text>The Ducati 916 is a fully faired sport bike made by Ducati from 1994 to 1998. Featuring a fuel injected, 4-valve, desmo, liquid-cooled, 90° V-twin engine in a trellis frame with a single-sided swingarm and USD forks, the 916 is frequently cited as one of the most beautiful motorcycles ever.

==Design and development==
The first development of the 916 model family can be traced back to the development of the four-valve Ducati engine, the Desmoquattro, through the development and racing of the earlier Pantah models, to the road-going 851 and 888 models.

The chief designer of Ducati motorcycles since the 1970s was Fabio Taglioni (1920–2001), who introduced the Pantah in 1979. The engine was updated in the 1990s in the SuperSport (SS) series and all modern Ducati engines are derivatives of the Pantah, which used its camshafts to both open and close the engine&#x27;s valves, eliminating the usual valve closing springs, a system called &#x27;desmodromic&#x27;. Taglioni, did not, however, have an interest in four-valve head engines, and so this was left to his successor. The eight-valve V-twin was the work of Taglioni&#x27;s successor, Massimo Bordi.

Designed by Massimo Tamburini and Sergio Robbiano and his team at the Cagiva Research Centre in San Marino, the 916&#x27;s water-cooled engine was a revision of that of its predecessor, the 888, with larger displacement and a new engine management system. The greater displacement was accomplished by increasing the crankshaft stroke from 64 mm to 66 mm, keeping the same 94 mm bore size as the 888, resulting in a capacity of 916 cc. (By the time the 916 was introduced, the final 851/888 Corse engines had also had their bore sizes increased to 96 mm resulting in &#x27;race only&#x27; capacities of 926 cc and 955 cc respectively.)

The 916 was a smaller motorcycle than the 888, with a chrome-moly trellis frame which was shared with the Ducati 748 in 1995 and beyond. This was combined with striking new bodywork that featured aggressive lines. In contrast to Japanese inline four-cylinder competitors of the time, its V-twin engine produced less outright power, but a more even torque spread. The 916 model was replaced by the 996 model in 1999.

Design of the Ducati 916 was a synthesis of form and function:
* The stylish single-sided swingarm was designed to make wheel changes faster during races.
* The underseat exhausts improve aerodynamic performance, and gave very clean lines. This feature was initially introduced on the Honda NR, and although Ducati was not the first, it has remained one of the trademark features of 916 line.

Journalist Kevin Ash suggested that although the 916 was &quot;one of the most influential machines of the last twenty years&quot;, the design is actually derivative of the Honda NR750, with the shared elements of underseat exhaust, narrow waist, similar squared-off dual headlights, and single-sided swingarm holding a large-section rear tire.

===Reception===
Making its debut in 1994, the Ducati 916 was admired because of its new design and outstanding technical features. At the time of introduction, the 916 was recognized by winning &quot;every magazine&#x27;s Bike of the Year award for 1994&quot;, and Ducati sold out its entire first year&#x27;s production run in the United States before any had actually arrived there.

==916 Senna==
First presented at the Bologna Motor Show in December 1994, the 916 Senna was a special edition to commemorate Formula 1 World Champion, Ayrton Senna, an avid Ducati enthusiast who endorsed its release shortly before his death in May 1994. At the time, the project was facilitated by the fact that Claudio Castiglioni, Ducati&#x27;s owner, was a personal friend of Senna&#x27;s. In total, between 1995, 1998 and 2001, Ducati released three &quot;Senna&quot; editions and, in every instance, net proceeds were donated to the Instituto Ayrton Senna charity.

==Racing==

Ducati won 4 Superbike World Championships with the 916, in 1994–1996, and in 1998, with riders Carl Fogarty and Troy Corser. Ducati won the Manufacturer&#x27;s Championship in all those years.

On March 1 and 2 in 1999, at the AHRMA Classic Days at Daytona International Speedway, Devin Battley rode a 1998 Ducati 916 to two victories. First, in the eight-lap Formula One class, and then in the Battle of the Twins Open class.

==Subsequent models and legacy==
The 916 was later replaced by the 996 and 998 with similar design but revised engines and more power.

Massimo Tamburini went on to design the MV Agusta F4, the bike which is seen as his replacement for the 916 range, and it shares many similarities with the 916 especially in the tail section. Both of these Tamburini designs were featured in the Guggenheim Museum&#x27;s 1998 &quot;The Art of the Motorcycle&quot; exhibit.

Looking back over a decade after its introduction, it is regularly placed on top lists of important designs in motorcycle history by authorities like the Guggenheim Museum, Bennetts, and Design Week; and authors Ian Falloon, Hugo Wilson, and Margaret Henderson. In a retrospective on the 1990s, &quot;Motorcyclist&quot; magazine simply stated, &quot;1994: Ducati 916 debuts. Did anything else happen that year?&quot;

In addition to the Guggenheim exhibit noted above, an example is also held by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.

<doc id="1027332" wikidata="Q322740" url="?curid=1027332" title="Prison abolition movement in the United States">
<text>The prison abolition movement is a network of groups and activists that seek to reduce or eliminate prisons and the prison system, and replace them with systems of rehabilitation and education that do not focus on punishment and government institutionalization. The prison abolitionist movement is distinct from conventional prison reform, which is intended to improve conditions inside prisons.

Supporters of prison abolitionism are a diverse group with differing ideas as to exactly how prisons should be abolished, and what, if anything, should replace them. Some supporters of decarceration and prison abolition also work to end solitary confinement, the death penalty, and the construction of new prisons through non-reformist reforms. Others support books-to-prisoner projects and defend prisoners&#x27; right to access information and library services. Some organizations, such as the Anarchist Black Cross, seek the total abolishment of the prison system without any intention to replace it with other government-controlled systems.

== Definition ==
Scholar Dorothy Roberts takes the prison abolition movement in the United States to endorse three basic theses:

# &quot;[T]oday’s carceral punishment system can be traced back to slavery and the racial capitalist regime it relied on and sustained.&quot;
# &quot;[T]he expanding criminal punishment system functions to oppress black people and other politically marginalized groups in order to maintain a racial capitalist regime.&quot;
# &quot;[W]e can imagine and build a more humane and democratic society that no longer relies on caging people to meet human needs and solve social problems.&quot;

Thus, Roberts situates the theory of prison abolition within an intellectual tradition including scholars such as Cedric Robinson, who developed the concept of racial capitalism, and characterizes the movement as a response to a long history of oppressive treatment of black people in the United States. In Canada, many abolitionists have called Canada&#x27;s prisons the &quot;new residential schools&quot;, which were designed as a cultural genocide of Indigenous people.

Legal scholar Allegra McLeod notes that prison abolition is not merely a negative project of &quot;opening … prison doors&quot;, but rather &quot;may be understood instead as a gradual project of decarceration, in which radically different legal and institutional regulatory forms supplant criminal law enforcement.&quot; Prison abolition, in McLeod&#x27;s view, involves a positive agenda that reimagines how societies might deal with social problems in the absence of prisons, using techniques such as decriminalization and improved welfare provision.

Like Roberts, McLeod sees the contemporary theory of prison abolition as linked to theories regarding the abolition of slavery. McLeod notes that W. E. B. Du Bois—particularly in his &quot;Black Reconstruction in America&quot;—saw abolitionism not only as a movement to end the legal institution of property in human beings, but also as a means of bringing about a &quot;different future&quot; wherein former slaves could enjoy full participation in society. (Angela Davis explicitly took inspiration from Du Bois&#x27;s concept of &quot;abolition democracy&quot; in her book &quot;Abolition Democracy: Beyond Empire, Prisons, and Torture&quot;.) Similarly, on McLeod&#x27;s view, prison abolition implies broad changes to social institutions: &quot;[a]n abolitionist framework&quot;, she writes, &quot;requires positive forms of social integration and collective security that are not organized around criminal law enforcement, confinement, criminal surveillance, punitive policing, or punishment.&quot;

The abolition of prisons is not only about the closure of prisons. Abolitionist views is also a way to counter the hegemonic discourse, and gives an alternative ways of thinking. It is a way to reconceptualize basic notions like crime, innocence, punishment etc.

== Historical development ==

=== Anarchism and prison abolition ===
Many anarchist organizations believe that the best form of justice arises naturally out of social contracts, restorative justice, or transformative justice.

Anarchist opposition to incarceration can be found in articles written as early as 1851, and is elucidated by major anarchist thinkers such as Proudhon, Bakunin, Berkman, Goldman, Malatesta, Bonano, and Kropotkin.

Personal experiences in prison because of revolutionary activity prompted many anarchists who were “deeply affected by their experiences” to publish their criticisms. In 1886, the trial of eight anarchists following the Haymarket riots brought state repression to public attention. Lucy Parsons, an anarchist and wife of one of the Haymarket eight, embarked on a speaking tour through 17 different states speaking to a total of almost 200,000 people. A single rally in Havana, Cuba, to support the families of the eight accused anarchists raised nearly $1000. Speaking at his trial, in a widely disseminated speech, one of the co-accused, August Spies, stated: It is not likely that the honorable Bonfield and Grinnell can conceive of a social order not held intact by the policeman&#x27;s club and pistol, nor of a free society without prisons, gallows, and State&#x27;s attorneys. In such a society they probably fail to find a place for themselves. And is this the reason why Anarchism is such a &quot;pernicious and damnable doctrine?&quot;The Anarchist Red Cross, a prisoner support group and the precursor to the Anarchist Black Cross, was founded roughly in 1906. By that year, groups existed in Kiev, Odessa, Bialystok, and trials of its members, led to its spread across Europe and North America. A 2018 guide to starting an Anarchist Black Cross group states that &quot;we need to destroy all the prisons, and free all the prisoners. Our position is an abolitionist stance against the state and it’s prisons.&quot;

In 1917, the Anarchist Red Cross would disband and members joined the revolution in Russia. Following the February revolution, political prisoners were released from Russian jails, in a massive wave of amnesties. The Anarchist Red Cross reorganised in 1919 as the Anarchist Black Cross, with some members joining the anarchist insurgent, Nestor Makhno.

Makhno, a Ukrainian anarchist who was freed in 1917 from a life sentence in prison, organised a revolutionary insurgent army along anarchist principles that would come to control a territory of seven-and-a-half million people. Upon taking control of a town, Makhnovists would destroy “all remnants and symbols of slavery: prisons, police and gendarmerie posts were blown up with dynamite or put to the torch.” Prisoners in battle who were not officers were typically welcomed into the ranks of Makhnovists or freed. The Makhnovist revolutionary insurgent army adopted a declaration in 1919, stating we are against all rigid judicial and police machinery, against any legislative code prescribed once and for all time, for these involve gross violations of genuine justice and of the real protections of the population. These ought not to be organized but should be instead the living, free and creative act of the community. Which is why all obsolete forms of justice—court administration, revolutionary tribunals, repressive laws, police or militia, Cheka, prisons and all other sterile and useless anachronisms—must disappear of themselves or be abolished from the very first breath of the free life, right from the very first steps of the free and living organization of society and the economy.The Anarchist Black Cross was reconstituted in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War and Anarchist Revolution. The pressure from the number of anarchist prisoners in need of aid led to the closing of “most of the chapters in the United States and Europe.” Alternative groups, such as the Alexander Berkman Aid Fund and the Society to Aid Anarchist Prisoners in Russia would take their place. Another resurgence was felt in 1967, and, again, in 1979 owing to the efforts of Lorenzo Kom’boa Ervin, whose writings on prison and anarchism are credited as having spread and been foundational to Black anarchism.

Anarchists agitation against prisons in Canada has included Bulldozer, an anti-prison anarchist project founded in Toronto in 1980. Bulldozer was closed after being raided and charged with sedition. The End the Prison Industrial Complex (Epic) was formed in 2009, and Anarchist Black Cross projects emerged throughout the 2000s. Anarchists and abolitionists within Québec organise yearly noise demonstrations outside of prison facilities on New Year&#x27;s Eve. A campaign to stop the construction of a migrant prison involved anarchists unloading thousands of crickets into the offices of an architectural firm in 2018.

Campaigns to free anarchist prisoners have served as the basis for calling for freedom for all prisoners. June 11, 2011, international solidarity actions for anarchist prisoners Marie Mason and Eric McDavid triggered the start of an international day and week of solidarity with all anarchist prisoners in 2015. 2022&#x27;s week of solidarity included actions in Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Uruguay, Greece, the UK, and other countries. The 2022-2023 hunger strike of anarchist prisoner Alfredo Cospito led to police skirmishes with protesters in Rome, a Turin cell tower being lit on fire, and a letter with bullets was sent to a newspaper stating &quot;if Alfredo Cospito dies judges will all be targets, two months without food, burn down the prisons.&quot; International actions to free Cospito, included the burning of a Strabag excavator in Germany. The Italian placed their embassies on &quot;alert&quot; in response to mobilizations.

The Rojavan Revolution, which many have considered illustrative of, and rooted in, anarchist theory, involved the mass liquidation of prisons and freeing of political prisoners and nonviolent offenders. Neighbourhood based &quot;peace committees,&quot; composed of elected community members with, largely, no formal legal education, were created to resolve conflicts using a model of consensus and restorative justice.

=== Prison abolition and the New Left ===
Angela Davis traces the roots of contemporary prison abolition theory at least to Thomas Mathiesen&#x27;s 1974 book &quot;The Politics of Abolition&quot;, which had been published in the wake of the Attica Prison uprising and unrest in European prisons around the same time. She also cites activist Fay Honey Knopp&#x27;s 1976 work &quot;Instead of Prisons: A Handbook for Abolitionists&quot; as significant in the movement.

Eduardo Bautista Duran and Jonathan Simon point out that George Jackson&#x27;s 1970 text &quot;Soledad Brother&quot; drew global attention to the conditions of prisons in the United States and made prison abolition a tenet of the New Left.

Liz Samuels has observed that, following the Attica Prison uprising, activists began to coalesce around a vision of abolition, whereas previously they had endorsed a program of reform.

== 1973 Walpole Prison uprising ==

In 1973, two years after the Attica Prison uprising, the inmates of Walpole prison, in Massachusetts, formed a prisoners&#x27; union to protect themselves from guards, end behavioral modification programs, advocate for the prisoner&#x27;s right for education and healthcare, gain more visitation rights, work assignments, and to be able to send money to their families.

The union also created a general truce within the prison and race-related violence sharply declined. During the Kwanzaa celebration, black prisoners were placed under lockdown, angering the whole facility and leading to a general strike. Prisoners refused to work or leave their cells for three months, to which the guards responded by beating prisoners, putting prisoners in solitary confinement, and denying prisoners medical care and food.

The strike ended in the prisoners&#x27; favour as the superintendent of the prison resigned. The prisoners were granted more visitation rights and work programs. Angered by this, the prison guards went on strike and abandoned the prison, hoping that this would create chaos and violence throughout the prison. But the prisoners were able to create an anarchist community where recidivism dropped dramatically and murders and rapes fell to zero. Prisoners volunteered to cook meals. Vietnam veterans who had been trained as medics took charge of the pharmacy and distribution of medication. Decisions were made in community assemblies.

== Advocates of prison abolition ==
Angela Davis writes: &quot;Mass incarceration is not a solution to unemployment, nor is it a solution to the vast array of social problems that are hidden away in a rapidly growing network of prisons and jails. However, the great majority of people have been tricked into believing in the efficacy of imprisonment, even though the historical record clearly demonstrates that prisons do not work.&quot;

In 1997, Angela Davis and Ruth Wilson Gilmore co-founded Critical Resistance, which is an organization working to &quot;build an international movement to end the Prison Industrial Complex by challenging the belief that caging and controlling people makes us safe.&quot; Other similarly motivated groups such as the Prison Activist Resource Center (PARC), a group &quot;committed to exposing and challenging all forms of institutionalized racism, sexism, able-ism, heterosexism, and classism, specifically within the Prison Industrial Complex,&quot; and Black &amp; Pink, an abolitionist organization that focuses around LGBTQ rights, all broadly advocate for prison abolition. Furthermore, the Human Rights Coalition, a 2001 group based in the city of Philadelphia that aims to abolish prisons, with their mission stating &quot;to empower prisoners&#x27; families to be leaders in prison organizing and to teach them how to advocate on behalf of their loved ones in prison and expose the inhumane practices of the Department of Corrections.&quot; In addition, the California Coalition for Women Prisoners, a grassroots organization dedicated to dismantling the PIC, can all be added to the long list of organizations that desire a different form of justice system.

Project NIA, an organization founded in 2009 by Mariame Kaba, helps to end the incarceration of youth, as well as victims of violence &quot;through community-based alternatives to the criminal legal process.&quot;

Since 1983, the International Conference on Penal Abolition (ICOPA) gathers activists, academics, journalists, and &quot;others from across the world who are working towards the abolition of imprisonment, the penal system, carceral controls and the prison industrial complex (PIC),&quot; to discuss three important questions surrounding the reality of prison abolition ICOPA was one of the first penal abolitionist conference movements, similar to Critical Resistance in America, but &quot;with an explicitly international scope and agenda-setting ambition.&quot;

Anarchists wish to eliminate all forms of state control, of which imprisonment is seen as one of the more obvious examples. Anarchists also oppose prisons given that statistics show incarceration rates affect mainly poor people and ethnic minorities, and do not generally rehabilitate criminals, in many cases making them worse.

In October 2015, members at a plenary session of the National Lawyers Guild (NLG) released and adopted a resolution in favor of prison abolition.

In Canada, a number of organizations support prison abolition, which includes the Saskatchewan Manitoba Alberta Abolition Organization (SMAAC) or the Toronto Prisoners’ Rights Project. These organizations collaborate and organize on issues of prison abolition and work towards prison abolition.

Many large socialist organizations in the United States support police and prison abolition, including Democratic Socialists of America and the Party for Socialism and Liberation.

== Disability, mental illness and prison ==

Prison abolitionists such as Amanda Pustilnik take issue with the fact that prisons are used as a &quot;default asylum&quot; for many individuals with mental illness: 

Why do governmental units choose to spend billions of dollars a year to concentrate people with serious illnesses in a system designed to punish intentional lawbreaking, when doing so matches neither the putative purposes of that system nor most effectively addresses the issues posed by that population?
In the United States, there are more people with mental illness in prisons than in psychiatric hospitals. In Canada, mental health issues are 2 to 3 times more prevalent in prisons than in the general population.

Prison abolitionists contend that prisons violate the Constitutional rights (5th and 6th Amendment rights) of mentally ill prisoners on the grounds that these individuals will not be receiving the same potential for rehabilitation as the non-mentally ill prison population. This injustice is sufficient grounds to argue for the abolishment of prisons. Prisons were not designed to be used to house the mentally ill, and prison practices like solitary confinement are damaging to mental health. Additionally, individuals with mental illnesses have a much higher chance of committing suicide while in prison.

In response to the fear that prisons are needed for the most serious cases of mentally ill, Liat Ben-Mosh describe prison abolitionist&#x27;s&#x27; view on the issue: &quot;Many prison abolitionists advocate for transformative justice and healing practices in which no one will be restrained or segregated, while some, like PREAP, believe that there will always be a small percentage of those whose behavior is so unacceptable or harmful that they will need to be incapacitated, socially exiled, or restrained and that this should be done humanely, temporarily, and not in a carceral or punitive manner.&quot; Another point raised is that the current focus in criminal justice reform on nonviolent, nonserious and nonsexual offences shrinks the borders and understandings of innocence and guilt.

== Aging in prison ==
The prison abolition movement and prison abolitionists like Liat Ben-Moshe have taken issue with the treatment of the aging population in prisons. Prolonged sentencing policies have resulted in an increased aging population in prisons as well as the harsh conditions of imprisonment. A number of reasons can contribute to older adult&#x27;s risk for illness while in prison. Prisons are not intended to be used as nursing homes, hospice or long-term care facilities for the aging prison population. Despite this, prison hospice does exist.

In Canada, individuals 50 years of age and older in federal custody account for 25% of the federal prison population. Investigations into the Canadian federal penitentiary have found that there is a general failure of the Correctional Service of Canada to meet safe and humane custody and assisting in the rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders into the community. The conditions of confinement of older individuals jeopardize the protection of their human rights. The conditions of the aging population in Canada has been denounced by persons who are incarcerated.

== Proposed reforms and alternatives ==
Proposals for prison reform and alternatives to prisons differ significantly depending on the political beliefs behind them. Often they fall in one of three categories from the &quot;Attrition Model&quot;, a model proposed by the Prison Research Education Action Project in 1976: moratorium, decarceration, and excarceration. Proposals and tactics often include:

* Penal system reforms:
** Substituting, for incarceration, supervised release, probation, restitution to victims, and/or community work.
** Decreasing terms of imprisonment by abolishing mandatory minimum sentencing
** Decreasing ethnic disparity in prison populations
* Prison condition reforms
* Crime prevention rather than punishment
* Abolition of specific programs which increase prison population, such as the prohibition of drugs (e.g., the American War on Drugs) and prohibition of prostitution.
* Education programs to inform people who have never been in prison about its problems
* Fighting individual cases of wrongful conviction

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime published a series of handbooks on criminal justice. Among them is Alternatives to Imprisonment which identifies how the overuse of imprisonment impacts fundamental human rights, especially those convicted for lesser crimes.

Social justice and advocacy organizations such as Students Against Mass Incarceration (SAMI) at the University of California, San Diego often look to Scandinavian countries Sweden and Norway for guidance in regard to successful prison reform because both countries have an emphasis on rehabilitation rather than punishment. According to Sweden&#x27;s former Prison and Probation Service Director-General, Nils Öberg, this emphasis is popular among the Swedish because the act of imprisonment is considered punishment enough. This focus on rehabilitation includes an emphasis on promoting normalcy for inmates, a charge led by experienced criminologists and psychologists. In Norway a focus on preparation for societal re-entry has yielded &quot;one of the lowest recidivism rates in the world at 20%, [while] the US has one of the highest: 76.6% of [American] prisoners are re-arrested within five years&quot;. The Swedish incarceration rate decreased by 6% between 2011 and 2012.

=== Abolitionist views ===
Many prison reform organizations and abolitionists in the United States advocate community accountability practices, such as community-controlled courts, councils, or assemblies as an alternative to the criminal justice system.

Abolitionists like Angela Davis recommend four measures as a way to deal with violent and other serious crimes: (1) make mental health care available to all (2) everyone should have access to affordable treatment for substance use disorders (3) make a stronger effort to rehabilitate those who commit criminal offences and (4) employ reparative or restorative justice measures as an accountability tool to reconcile offenders with their victims and undo or compensate the harm done.

Organizations such as INCITE! and Sista II Sista that support women of color who are survivors of interpersonal violence argue that the criminal justice system does not protect marginalized people who are victims in relationships. Instead, victims, especially those who are poor, minorities, transgender or gender non-conforming can experience additional violence at the hands of the state. Instead of relying on the criminal justice system, these organizations work to implement community accountability practices, which often involve collectively-run processes of intervention initiated by a survivor of violence to try to hold the person who committed violence accountable by working to meet a set of demands.
For organizations outside the United States see, e.g. Justice Action, Australia.

Some anarchists and socialists contend that a large part of the problem is the way the judicial system deals with prisoners, people, and capital. According to Marxists, in capitalist economies incentives are in place to expand the prison system and increase the prison population. This is evidenced by the creation of private prisons in America and corporations like CoreCivic, formerly known as Correction Corporation of America (CCA). Its shareholders benefit from the expansion of prisons and tougher laws on crime. More prisoners is seen as beneficial for business. Some anarchists contend that with the destruction of capitalism, and the development of social structures that would allow for the self-management of communities, property crimes would largely vanish. There would be fewer prisoners, they assert, if society treated people more fairly, regardless of gender, color, ethnic background, sexual orientation, education, etc.

The demand for prison abolition is a feature of anarchist criminology, which argues that prisons encourage recidivism and should be replaced by efforts to rehabilitate offenders and reintegrate them into communities.

==== “Nine perspectives for prison abolitionists” ====

&quot;Instead of prisons: a handbook for abolitionists&quot;, republished by Critical Resistance in 2005, outlines what the organization identifies as the nine main perspectives for prison abolitionists:

* Perspective 1 The imprisonment of a human being is inherently immoral, and while total abolition of the current prison system is not an easy task, it is possible. The first step towards abolition is admitting that prisons cannot be reformed, as a carceral system is founded on brutality and contempt for those imprisoned. Additionally, the current system works to disproportionally imprison poor and working-class people, so its abolition would ensure progress towards equality. Abolitionists see many similarities between today&#x27;s carceral system and the slavery establishment of the past, and would in fact say that the current system is simply reformed enslavement which perpetuates the same oppressive and discriminatory patterns. But just as superficial reforms could not alter the brutality of the slave system, reforms cannot change a system rooted in racism.

* Perspective 2 The abolitionist message requires changing our language and definitions of punishment “treatment” and “inmates”. In order to break away from the prison system, we must use honest language and take back the power of our vocabulary.

* Perspective 3 Imprisonment is not a proper response to deviance. Abolitionists promote reconciliation rather than punishment, a perspective seeking to restore both the criminal and the victim while limiting the disruption of their lives in the process.

* Perspective 4 Abolitionists advocate for changes beneficial to the prisoner but do so while remaining a non-member of the system. In a similar fashion, abolitionists respect the personhood of system managers but oppose their role in the perpetuation of an oppressive system.

* Perspective 5 The abolitionist message extends farther than the traditional helping relationship; Abolitionists identify themselves as allies of the imprisoned, respecting their perspectives as well as the requirements for abolition.

* Perspective 6 The empowerment of prisoners and ex-prisoners is crucial to the abolitionist movement. Programs and resources dedicated to reinstating that which has been stripped from them by the prison system are fundamental in putting power back in their own hands.

* Perspective 7 Abolitionists believe that citizens are the true source of institutional power which can lead to the abolition of the prison system. Giving or limiting support from certain policies and practices will enable the progression of the abolitionist movement.

* Perspective 8 Abolitionists believe that crime is a consequence of a broken society, and resources must be used towards social programs instead of the funding of prisons. They advocate for public solutions to public problems, producing effects which will benefit everyone in society.

* Perspective 9 An emphasis is placed on the correction of society rather than the correction of an individual. It is only in a corrected or caring community that individual redemption and rehabilitation can be achieved. Thus, abolitionists see that the only adequate alternative to the prison system is building a kind of society which has no need for prisons.

<text>William Lewis Guy (September 30, 1919 – April 26, 2013) was an American politician who was the 26th governor of North Dakota from 1961 to 1973. Guy was North Dakota&#x27;s longest-serving governor in state history, serving two consecutive two-year terms and two four-year terms in office.

==Biography==
Guy was born in Devils Lake, North Dakota. After receiving his B.S. degree from North Dakota Agricultural College (NDAC), where he was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Blue Key National Honor Society. He served in the U.S. Navy in World War II as a gunnery officer, achieving the rank of lieutenant. He received a master&#x27;s degree from the University of Minnesota, and then became the assistant county agent for Cass County. With his wife, the former Jean Mason, whom he married on January 30, 1943, Guy began farming at Amenia, North Dakota, in 1948 and taught agricultural economics at NDAC during the winter quarters.

He served in the North Dakota House of Representatives for one term from 1959 to 1961. In the legislature, Guy served as assistant minority leader. He died on the morning of April 26, 2013 at West Fargo, North Dakota. He was 93. He had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

==Governor of North Dakota==
His election as governor on the Democratic-Nonpartisan League ticket finally established the two-party system in North Dakota. As governor, Guy served two two-year terms and two four-year terms. He began modernizing state government by implementing the new Office of Management and Budget. During his terms, the state hospital&#x27;s patient load was reduced from 2,600 to 600 and eight regional mental health districts were established. Guy organized the five-state Old West Trail Tourist Loop. The interstate highway system, 350 Minuteman missiles, the anti-ballistic missiles site, and Garrison Diversion were large federal projects that came to North Dakota during Guy&#x27;s watch. He was instrumental in bringing three sugar beet refineries and large scale coal-fired electrical generation to North Dakota. Governor Guy was selected by President Lyndon B. Johnson to observe the first presidential elections in South Vietnam. He originated the concept of an interpretive North Dakota Heritage Center and promoted its construction. The Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider Award was established by Governor Guy as North Dakota&#x27;s highest recognition. Guy organized and served as the first chairman of the Midwest Governors&#x27; Conference in 1962. In 1966, he was elected chairman of the National Governors&#x27; Conference. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the United States Senate in 1974.

<text>The 1996 CONCACAF Gold Cup was the third edition of the Gold Cup, the soccer championship of North America, Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF).

The tournament returned to the United States and California; the games were hosted by Los Angeles, San Diego, and Anaheim. The format of the tournament changed from 1993: it was expanded to nine teams, separated into three groups of three and played in January as opposed to the 1993 edition which was played in July.

The top team in each group, plus the best second-place finisher would advance to the semifinals. For the first time, a non-CONCACAF team was invited: Brazil, who sent their under-23 side. Mexico won their second straight Gold Cup, beating the Brazilians 2–0 in the final.

<doc id="1027348" wikidata="Q7043061" url="?curid=1027348" title="No. 18 Squadron RAF">
<text>No. 18 Squadron of the Royal Air Force (also known as No. 18 &#x27;Burma&#x27; Squadron) operates the Boeing Chinook from RAF Odiham. Owing to its heritage as a bomber squadron, it is also known as No. 18 (B) Squadron.

Formed in 1915 as a fighter squadron, it also operated early bomber types. After reforming in 1931 it again operated a variety of bi-plane bombers before seeing action during WWII on a number of fronts with the Bristol Blenheim. Reformed again in 1953 it went on to operate jet bombers such as the Canberra and Valiant. In 1964 it started flying helicopters, firstly with the Wessex, and from 1981 with the Chinook heavy-lift helicopter.

==History==

===First World War===

The squadron was formed on 11 May 1915 at Northolt as part of the Royal Flying Corps. It arrived in France on 19 November 1915, principally equipped with the Vickers FB5 &#x27;Gunbus&#x27;, supplemented by a few Airco DH.2s and Bristol Scouts, and operating in the Army cooperation role. By April 1916 the squadron had re-equipped with FE2bs. Victor Huston became a flying ace piloting one of these. The squadron was heavily deployed during the Battle of the Somme, where it was attached to the Cavalry Corps and trained to assist it in the event on any breakthrough, but towards the end of the year and into early 1917, was increasingly deployed on night operations as its F.E.2bs became more vulnerable during daylight operations.

The squadron re-equipped with Airco DH.4s from June 1917, although operations continued with F.E.2 until at least August 1917 as its DH.4s were equipped with the unreliable RAF 3 engine. Once these reliability problems were solved, the squadron, began to specialise in long-range attacks, but this changed in March 1918 when the Germans launched Operation Michael, the opening move of their Spring Offensive. 18 Squadron was among many units deployed to stop the German attacks, resorting to low level attacks as well as more conventional medium level operations. As the Germans switched the focus of their operations northwards in the Battle of the Lys, the squadron was again heavily involved, and on 12 April, the squadron carried out six separate attacks in the vicinity of Merville, with 13 pilots flying between them 44 flying hours that day. In September 1918, the squadron began to re-equip with Airco DH.9As, this process continuing until November that year. By the end of the war, the squadron had claimed 200 air-to-air victories. Flight Lieutenant David Stewart, who had shot down two aircraft as an observer flying with 20 Squadron, was credited with 14 more as a pilot flying with 18 Squadron. Following the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that ended the fighting on the Western Front, 18 Squadron moved into Germany in support of the Occupation of the Rhineland in early 1919, carrying mail between the British Army of the Rhine and the United Kingdom. The squadron returned to Britain in September 1919 and disbanded at Weston-on-the-Green on 31 December 1919.

===Reformation===
The squadron reformed at RAF Upper Heyford in Oxfordshire on 20 October 1931, equipped with the Hawker Hart light bomber. As well as training for its main role, the squadron participated in the 1932 and 1935 Hendon Air Shows as well as the Royal Review of the Royal Air Force by King George V at RAF Mildenhall in July 1935. In January 1936, the squadron moved to RAF Bircham Newton in Norfolk, with the squadron&#x27;s C Flight being detached to form No. 49 Squadron on 10 February. In April 1936, the squadron&#x27;s Harts were replaced by the improved Hawker Hind derivative. The squadron joined the newly established No. 1 Group RAF in July 1936, and moved back to Upper Heyford in September 1936. 18 Squadron transferred to 2 Group on 1 January 1939, re-equipping with Bristol Blenheim I monoplane twin-engined bombers in May 1939.

===Second World War===
On the outbreak of the Second World War, No. 18 Squadron along with 57 Squadron comprised No. 70 Wing and was still based at Upper Heyford and equipped with Blenheim Is. The wing was allocated for deployment to France as part of the BEF Air Component, with the role of strategic reconnaissance. 18 Squadron reached France by the end of September 1939, commencing operations in October and re-equipping with Blenheim IVs in February 1940. When Germany invaded France and the Low Countries, 18 Squadron took part in bombing missions against German troops as well as their envisioned reconnaissance missions. After the squadron was forced to change airfields three times in three days, it was ordered to evacuate back to England on 19 May, moving to RAF Watton in Norfolk. Losses had been heavy, however, with only three Blenheims returning from France.
The squadron, which had rejoined 2 Group, moved to Gatwick on 26 May and to West Raynham on 12 June 1940. Operations restarted on 4 July, when three Blenheims (one of which was lost) attacked oil targets in Germany. Operations were initially daylight attacks against targets including barges collected for the planned German invasion of Britain, with heavy losses, with the Squadron switching to night operations from August that year. It moved to Great Massingham on 8 September, continuing to attack Channel ports, with increased attacks against German airfields from December. On 3 April 1941, the squadron moved to Oulton in Norfolk, with its main duties as daylight anti-shipping duties, with the squadron also taking part in &#x27;Circus&#x27; operations, heavily escorted raids against targets in France to draw German fighters into combat. The squadron moved to Horsham St Faith on 13 July 1941 and to Manston in Kent on 16 August. During one raid over France on 19 August 1941, one aircraft dropped a box over Saint-Omer airfield containing an artificial leg. It was a spare for Wing Commander Douglas Bader. 

In October 1941, the squadron&#x27;s air component (i.e. its aircraft and aircrews) were detached to Malta, while the ground component remained in the UK and was used for maintenance and guard duties. While based at Malta, the squadron&#x27;s aircraft were used for attacks against targets in Sicily and North Africa, as well as striking against Italian shipping convoys. Losses were heavy (the two Malta-based Blenheim squadrons, 18 and 107, had lost over 57 aircraft during operations from Malta during 1941, including 15 in December alone) and the squadron&#x27;s strength was supplemented by co-opting Blenheims on transit through Malta to Egypt and their crews as reinforcements. On 4 January 1942, the squadron took part in a large scale attack against Castelvetrano Airfield in Sicily, where reconnaissance had spotted large numbers of transports and bombers. Ten Blenheims from 18 and 107 Squadrons attacked first, claiming 30 aircraft destroyed and many more damaged, and this was followed up that night by multiple attacks by three Vickers Wellington bombers which claimed a further 14 aircraft destroyed, at the cost of one Wellington. Actual German and Italian losses consisted of six Savoia-Marchetti SM.82s, four CANT Z.1007 Alciones, one Junkers Ju52 and one Fiat CR.42 Falco, with a further 42 aircraft damaged, badly disrupting Axis air transport operations to North Africa. Later that month the surviving aircraft and aircrews of 18 Squadron left Malta for the Middle East, and had been absorbed into other units by March 1942.

Back in England, the squadron was rebuilt at RAF Wattisham, Suffolk, with a mixture of new crews from training units and some ex-107 Squadron crews returned from Malta, and still equipped with the Blenheim IV. It remained part of 2 Group. Night intruder and Army cooperation operations were added to the squadron&#x27;s duties. On the night of 30/31 May 1942, 17 Blenheims from 18 Squadron carried out intruder attacks against Juvincourt Airfield, St. Trond Airfield and Venlo Airfield in support of Operation Minellium, the thousand-bomber raid against Cologne. On the night of 1/2 June, 18 Squadron again carried out intruder operations in support of a thousand-bomber raid against Essen.

In August 1942, the squadron was withdrawn from operations to prepare for deployment to North Africa in support of Operation Torch, and was re-equipped with Blenheim V bombers (also known as Bisleys). The Blenheim V carried a heavier defensive armament, but was significantly heavier, and was therefore slower than the aircraft it replaced and had poor engine-out handling characteristics. On 10 October 1942, the Squadron&#x27;s Blenheims flew from Portreath in Cornwall to Blida in Algeria. On 17 November 1942, twelve 18 Squadron Blenheims set off without fighter escort from Blida to attack Bizerte-Sidi Ahmed airfield, but were attacked by Messerschmitt Bf 109s of Jagdgeschwader 51. Two Blenheims were shot down by the German fighters, with two more destroyed after colliding when trying to avoid the fighters, and a fifth was damaged by flak and crash landed at Djidjelli. One Bf 109 was shot down by the Blenheims, while several German aircraft were damaged or destroyed on the ground. On 31 November 1942, the squadron moved forwards to Canrobert Airfield, which was closer to the front line, so that it could better support the allied ground forces. On the morning of 4 December 1942, six 18 Squadron Blenheims attacked an airstrip north of Chouigui, and in the afternoon of the same day, eight 18 Squadron Blenheims and two more from 614 Squadron took off to repeat the attack, led by Wing Commander Hugh Malcolm, 18 Squadron&#x27;s commanding officer. No fighter escort was available. One aircraft crash landed due to engine trouble, and as they approached the target area, the formation was attacked by large numbers of Bf 109s of Jagdgeschwader 51 and Jagdgeschwader 2 airfield in December 1942. Malcolm pressed on with the attack as one by one all of the Blenheims were shot down, with Malcolm the last. Four crews survived, but Malcolm did not and he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. 

These losses were quickly replaced, and the squadron was back in action on 27 December 1942, although it was limited to night operations, attacking enemy road transports. On 18 January 1943, the Squadron lost another commanding officer when Wing Commander Tucker failed to return from a night intruder mission. The squadron was withdrawn from active service at the beginning of February 1842 to await re-equipment with more modern aircraft, but a German offensive resulted in the Squadron being ordered back onto operations with borrowed Blenheims on 18 February. On the night of 28/29 March 1943, the squadron flew its last operations with the Blenheim before standing down to re-equip with the Douglas Boston.

During 1943–45, No. 18 Squadron supported the allied advance through Italy before moving to Greece in September 1945, disbanding there on 31 March 1946.

===Post war===
18 Squadron was reformed in 1953 at RAF Scampton, Lincolnshire and equipped with the Canberra B.2 medium bomber before disbanding again on 1 February 1957.

On 15 December 1958, No. 199 Squadron RAF, operating Canberras and Vickers Valiants in the electronic countermeasures (ECM) role, disbanded, with the Valiant equipped C Flight being redesignated No. 18 Squadron. The squadron&#x27;s seven Valiants were fitted with an array of powerful jammers to interfere with communications and radar. They were initially employed for training purposes, simulating hostile jamming in Fighter Command exercises (and occasionally inadvertently jamming TV reception over much of the United Kingdom), but later added a bomber support role. The squadron was disbanded on 31 March 1963, as the RAF&#x27;s Vulcan and Victor bombers were now fitted with effective ECM equipment, while the training role could be performed more economically by smaller aircraft such as the Canberra.The Squadron was next operational in 1964, equipped with the Westland Wessex HC.2 at RAF Odiham, formed when the Wessex Intensive Flying Trials Unit was disbanded and re-designated No. 18 Squadron. It moved to RAF Gütersloh, Westphalia in support of the BAOR in Germany in August 1970 but disbanded again on 20 November 1980.

The squadron was reformed on 4 August 1981, becoming the first RAF squadron to fly the Boeing Chinook HC.1. 18 Squadron was the only Chinook squadron that took part in Operation Corporate during the Falklands War in 1982 with four detached and sent south. All were lost, except one, when the ship carrying them, the &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot; was sunk after being hit by an Exocet missile. The remaining aircraft (Bravo November, ZA718) flew almost continuously until the end of the conflict. Squadron Leader Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Langworthy AFC RAF was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) for his part in the air operations. In August 1983 the squadron returned to Gutersloh. 18 Squadron took part in the UK&#x27;s deployment to the Gulf following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. After this the squadron was subject to the restructures from the Options for Change decisions which included the transfer of Gutersloh to the British Army, so December 1992 18 Squadron relocated to RAF Laarbruch. With the further drawing down of the British presence in Germany, 18 Squadron left the continent and returned to Odiham in August 1997.
The Chinook HC.2, equivalent to the US Army CH-47D standard, began to enter RAF service in 1993. The squadron&#x27;s Chinook HC.2s were deployed to Iraq for Operation Telic.

In 2017, the Squadron participated in Operation Ruman: UK relief effort in the Caribbean after Hurricane Irma. In 2018, Chinook Mk5s drawn from the Squadron formed most of 1310 Flight which was deployed to Mali, to support Operation Barkhane-the French-led counter-terrorist operation in the country.

In March 2020, the squadron was awarded the right to emblazon a battle honour on its squadron standard, recognising its role in the War in Afghanistan between 2001 and 2014.

==History==

===First World War===

27 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps formed at Hounslow Heath Aerodrome on 5 November 1915, being split off from 24 Squadron. Initially using aircraft borrowed from 24 Squadron, 27 Squadron moved to Swingate Down outside Dover in late November 1915, and in early February 1916, received its initial operating equipment, the Martinsyde Elephant fighter aircraft, hence the use of an elephant for the squadron badge. It transferred to France on 1 March 1916, serving as part of 9th Wing RFC. Initially the squadron was tasked with using its aircraft as escort fighters, but by the time the Battle of the Somme began, it was clear that the Elephant was unsuitable as a fighter. At the Somme, the squadron was initially tasked with mounting standing fighter patrols to protect British bombers and reconnaissance aircraft and with bomber-reconnaissance duties, taking advantage of the Martinsyde&#x27;s good range and load carrying capacity, carrying out its first bombing mission on 1 July 1916. It was ordered to concentrate on bombing duties on 9 July.

The squadron continued to operate its Martinsydes into 1917, taking part in the Battle of Arras in April–May, the Battle of Messines in June, where the squadron attacked German airfields, and the Battle of Passchendaele (also known as the Third Battle of Ypres), where the squadron attacked railway targets and airfields, from July that year. It re-equipped with Airco DH.4s, which carried twice the bombload of the Martinsyde at greater speed and height, while carrying a gunner to defend against enemy fighters, from between September and December 1917, but was still equipped with a mixture of Martinsydes and DH.4s when it flew in support of the British offensive at Cambrai.

In March 1918, the squadron moved to Villers-Bretonneux east of Amiens as part of a concentration of the RFCs resources against the likely route of a suspected German offensive. The morning of 21 March brought the start of Operation Michael, the opening part of the German spring offensive. At first the squadron was deployed against railway junctions, to slow the movement of German reinforcements. On 24 March, the squadron was forced to evacuate from Villers-Bretonneux, threatened by the German advance, to Beauvois-en-Cambrésis. On 25 March, as the Germans threatened to breakthrough near Bapaume, all available squadrons, including 27 Squadron, were ordered to carry out low level attacks against the German troops. The squadron continued to fly a mixture of low level attack against troop concentrations and high level attacks over the next few days, and on 29 March was forced to move airfields again, this time to Ruisseauville. On 1 April 1918, the RFC merged with the Royal Naval Air Service to form the Royal Air Force, but this had little effect on the squadrons at the front, with 27 Squadron continuing to operate against the German offensive. On 9 April, the Germans launched the second stage of its offensive, an attack near the River Lys at the junction between the British First and Second Armies. 27 Squadron was again deployed against the offensive attacking railway targets from 12 April. It started to receive DH.9 bombers in July 1918, but as these proved to be inferior to the DH.4, managed to keep some of its DH.4s until the end of the war. The squadron was disbanded on 22 January 1920.

===Inter-war period===
On 1 April 1920, No. 27 was reformed by re-numbering No. 99 Squadron RAF then in India, flying Airco DH.9A light bombers from Risalpur over the North-West Frontier. Operations included Pink&#x27;s War, an aerial bombardment campaign against militant Mahsud tribesmen in South Waziristan in March and April 1925, the first colonial policing action carried out solely by the RAF, without the participation of the British Army. The squadron&#x27;s DH.9As were eventually replaced by Westland Wapitis in 1928, when the squadron moved to Kohat. In December 1928, Flying Officer Tusk and Leading Aircraftman Donaldson (both of 27 Squadron), flew the first mission of the Kabul Airlift. Strictly a reconnaissance flight to ascertain the situation of the British Legation in Kabul during a civil war, they were shot at by local tribesmen and forced to land at a nearby airstrip. After this they managed to dash across no-man&#x27;s land and arrived at the legation to set up communications with their home base of Risalpur.

===War in the East===
The outbreak of the Second World War in Europe in September 1939 saw part of the squadron deployed on coastal anti-submarine and anti-shipping patrols from Madras, before on 1 October 1939, the squadron became a flying training school training pilots for the Indian Air Force, operating de Havilland Tiger Moth and Hawker Hart biplanes as well as Wapitis, and based at Risalpur. Many of the squadron&#x27;s former operational pilots were employed ferrying Bristol Blenheim bombers from Egypt to India and the Far East, and in January 1941, Blenheims started to be delivered to the squadron, allowing a Blenheim-equipped 27 Squadron to be split off from the training school in February and sent to Singapore. The squadron&#x27;s Blenheims were Mk IF aircraft, fitted with an under-fuselage gun-pack for use as a long-range and night fighter, and were the only RAF night fighters in the Far East. The squadron moved to Butterworth in May 1941 and to Sungai Petani in August that year. Japan invaded Malaya on 8 December 1941, and 27 Squadron flew off eight Blenheims that morning to attack Japanese invasion shipping. Poor weather prevented them from locating any Japanese ships, however, and air attacks on Sungai Petani that day wrecked the airfield and left the squadron with only four airworthy aircraft. It was evacuated to Butterworth that evening. The remaining aircraft were pulled back to Singapore by 12 December, where they, together with a few Blenheim Is from other squadrons operated under the name of 27 Squadron. The remaining Blenheims based at Singapore, including those of 27 Squadron were evacuated to Sumatra from 23 January 1941, ending up operating from Palembang. On 14 February four of its Blenheims attacked Japanese ships invading Sumatra, with the loss of two Blenheims, with all airworthy aircraft evacuating to Java on 15 February. Here the squadron effectively ceased to exist.

A new No. 27 Squadron was formed at RAF Amarda Road India on 19 September 1942, although it initially had no aircraft, not receiving its first Bristol Beaufighter until 22 October and not having a full complement of Beaufighters until 21 December. It flew its first operation, an attack on Taungoo airfield in Burma, on 24 December 1942. The squadron moved to Kanchrapara in January 1943, and to Agartala in February, joining 169 Wing of 224 Group. The squadron used its Beaufighters for ground-attack missions over Burma and anti-shipping strikes. In April 1943, the squadron received a number of de Havilland Mosquitoes for evaluation, and a flight was re-equipped with Mosquitoes in December that year. The glue-and-plywood construction of the otherwise excellent Mosquito proved to be less than optimal for tropical Burma, and the operations were plagued by technical problems. They eventually relinquished the Mosquitoes to No. 680 Squadron RAF, retaining the Beaufighters and continuing the Squadron&#x27;s diet of ground attack and anti-shipping strikes, switching to air-jungle rescue in April 1945.

Following the Japanese surrender, it was deployed to Batavia during the Indonesian War of Independence, being disbanded on 1 February 1946.

===Post-war service===
On 24 November 1947, the squadron reformed at RAF Oakington as a Transport unit equipped with Douglas Dakota transports. It flew both routine scheduled transport routes and trained in glider towing, and took part in the Berlin Airlift in 1948–49. It was disbanded on 10 November 1950. On 15 June 1953, No. 27 Squadron reformed at RAF Scampton as part of RAF Bomber Command, with Canberra bombers. It took part in the Suez Crisis in 1956, and was disbanded at RAF Waddington on 31 December 1957.

In April 1961, the squadron reformed at RAF Scampton as the first squadron to be equipped with the Avro Vulcan B2 V bomber and formed part of the UK nuclear deterrent strike force. The squadron&#x27;s Vulcans were equipped with the Blue Steel one megaton stand-off bomb until 1969 when their eight aircraft were each re-equipped with a WE.177B laydown bomb of 450 kt yield. The squadron&#x27;s role assigned to SACEUR in a low-level penetration role was tactical support for ground forces resisting a Soviet land attack into Western Europe by striking targets assigned by SACEUR, beyond the forward edge of the battlefield, and deep into enemy-held areas. By the end of 1971 the squadron had relinquished its nuclear delivery role, and stood down until in December 1973 it was reformed at RAF Scampton with the Vulcan B2 to operate in the Maritime Radar Reconnaissance (MRR) role assigned to SACLANT.

From 1973 to 1982 the squadron performed the duties of &#x27;Strategic Reconnaissance&#x27; with onboard equipment to monitor the fall-out from air and ground-based nuclear tests being performed by emerging nuclear powers in the Indian sub-continent and SE Asia. The squadron&#x27;s Vulcan B2s were modified (and re-designated as &quot;Vulcan B.2 (MRR)&quot;) to carry underwing &#x27;sniffer&#x27; and collection equipment to detect and collect samples of airborne contamination for later analysis at the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment (AWRE) at Aldermaston. The samples were collected by flying through the high altitude dust cloud of a ground-based test or the downwind contamination of the upper atmosphere after an air burst. The squadron disbanded again at Scampton in 1982.

The squadron reformed again at RAF Marham in 1983 with twelve Tornado GR1 aircraft and eighteen WE.177 nuclear bombs, and once again assigned to SACEUR in 1984, the squadron&#x27;s role was low-level penetration tactical support for ground forces resisting a Soviet land attack into Western Europe by striking targets beyond the forward edge of the battlefield. The squadron&#x27;s allocation of eighteen WE.177 weapons was because of the greater carrying capacity of the Tornado, which could carry two weapons. The apparent mismatch between twelve Tornado aircraft and eighteen nuclear weapons was because RAF staff planners expected up to one third attrition of aircraft in the conventional phase, with sufficient aircraft held back in reserve to deliver the squadron&#x27;s full stock of nuclear weapons if the conflict escalated to the use of tactical nuclear weapons. In September 1993, the squadron&#x27;s Tornado aircraft and personnel moved to RAF Lossiemouth and took on the number plate of No. 12 Squadron which had recently disbanded at RAF Marham.

===Helicopters===

The No. 27 Squadron number plate was transferred to RAF Odiham and became No. 27 (Reserve) Squadron, the Chinook/Puma Operational Conversion Unit, formerly No. 240 Operational Conversion Unit RAF (OCU). It regained full squadron status in January 1998 equipped with Chinooks only. In 2002 the squadron&#x27;s Chinooks saw service in Afghanistan as they transported Royal Marines from 3 Commando Brigade for Operation Jacana.

The squadron also served in a transport role during the 2003 invasion of Iraq and was stationed at Basra as part of No. 1310 Flight RAF, supporting Operation Telic. In July 2006, 3 Chinook helicopters of No. 27 Squadron deployed to RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus to evacuate British citizens from Lebanon. It deployed to Afghanistan for Operation Herrick in 2011.

In March 2020, the squadron was awarded the right to emblazon a battle honour on its squadron standard, recognising its role in the War in Afghanistan between 2001 and 2014.

In 2007, Olly Lambert made a documentary for the BBC about a two-month deployment of 27 Squadron in Helmand, Afghanistan. It documented the daily routines and work of the squadron personnel on duty during Operation Herrick. Named &quot;Above Enemy Lines&quot;, it was first screened on BBC One on 9 October 2007, and was noted for its graphic portrayal of the evacuation and loss of Private Christopher Gray, fatally shot in an ambush in Now Zad on 13 April 2007.

<text>The 1998 CONCACAF Gold Cup was the fourth edition of the Gold Cup, the soccer championship for the member associations of CONCACAF, which governs the sport in North America, Central America, and the Caribbean.

The tournament was once again held in the United States, with matches played in Los Angeles, Miami, and Oakland, California. The format of the tournament changed from 1996: it was expanded to ten teams, with four in Group A and three each in Groups B and C. The top team in each group, plus the second place in Group A would advance to the semifinals. Brazil was invited again, and brought their senior team this time. Prior to the tournament, Canada withdrew due to a lack of available players and were replaced by Jamaica.

Jamaica topped Group A over Brazil, who they tied 0–0, in a surprise result for the team. In the semi-finals, the United States beat Brazil, as Preki scored the lone goal and Kasey Keller preserved the clean sheet. The United States could not repeat that performance in front of a pro-Mexican final crowd in Los Angeles. Mexico won their third straight Gold Cup, 1–0, on a Luis Hernández goal.

<doc id="1027393" wikidata="Q206327" url="?curid=1027393" title="Bernard Kouchner">
<text>Bernard Kouchner (born 1 November 1939) is a French politician and doctor. He is the co-founder of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and Médecins du Monde. From 2007 until 2010, he was the French Minister of Foreign and European Affairs in the center-right Fillon government under president Nicolas Sarkozy, although he had been in the past a minister in socialist governments. In 2010, &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; considered Kouchner the 15th most influential Jew in the world. Since 2015 Kouchner is workstream leader for the AMU (Agency for the Modernisation of Ukraine), where he contributes his expertise in healthcare.

==Early life==
Kouchner was born in Avignon, to a Jewish father and a Protestant mother. Kouchner&#x27;s paternal grandparents were Russian-born Jews who escaped the pogroms by immigrating to France, but perished decades later in Auschwitz.

==Career==
Kouchner began his political career as a member of the French Communist Party (PCF), from which he was expelled in 1966 for attempting to overthrow the leadership. On a visit to Cuba in 1964, Kouchner spent the night fishing and drinking with Fidel Castro. In the protests of May 1968, he ran the medical faculty strike committee at the Sorbonne.

===Co-Founder of Médecins Sans Frontières and Médecins du Monde===
Kouchner worked as a physician for the Red Cross in Biafra in 1968 (during the Nigerian Civil War). His experience as a physician for the Red Cross led him to co-found Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) in 1971, and then, due to a conflict of opinion with MSF chairman Claude Malhuret, he established &quot;Doctors of the World&quot; (&#x27;Médecins du Monde&#x27;) in 1980. Kouchner worked as a humanitarian volunteer during the Siege of Naba&#x27;a refugee camp in Lebanon in East Beirut during the Lebanese Civil War taking risks that &quot;other foreign aid workers weren&#x27;t, even worked closely with the Shia cleric Imam Musa al-Sadr&quot;.

===Career in government===
From 1988, Kouchner began his government career in Socialist governments, though he was not always a member of the Socialist Party (PS). He became &quot;Secrétaire d&#x27;état&quot;, a lower position in the Cabinet, for Humanitarian Action in 1988 in the Michel Rocard cabinet, then Minister of Health under Pierre Bérégovoy in 1992, during Mitterrand&#x27;s presidency.

===Member of the European Parliament, 1994–1997===
Kouchner continued his political career in the European Parliament from 1994 to 1997. During the time, he chaired the Committee on Development and Cooperation and served on the Subcommittee on Human Rights. In addition to his committee assignments, he was a member of the Parliament&#x27;s delegation for relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Together with Judge Andrée Ruffo, Kouchner established the International Bureau for Children&#x27;s Rights (IBCR), a non-governmental organization based in Montreal, in 1994.

===Minister of Health, 1997–1999===
When Lionel Jospin became Prime Minister in 1997, Kouchner became Minister of Health for the second time. He held the office until 1999.

===UN Representative in Kosovo, 1999–2001===
On 15 July 1999, pursuant to Security Council Resolution 1244, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan nominated Kouchner as the second UN Special Representative and Head of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). During 18 months, he led UN efforts to create a new civil administration and political system replacing the Serbian ones, and to rebuild the economy shattered by the Kosovo War. Thus, municipal councils were elected at local level by the end of 2000. He was replaced on 21 January 2001 by Danish Social Democrat Hans Hækkerup. Later, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Pristina for his services to Kosovo.

===Minister of Health, 2001–2002===
Kouchner became at this time Minister of Health for the third time, until the 2002 elections.

===Candidate for UN positions===
In 2005, Kouchner was a candidate for the position of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), but lost the appointment in favor of former Portuguese Prime Minister, António Guterres, who was nominated by then-UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan.

In 2006, Kouchner was also a candidate to become Director-General of the World Health Organization. He lost before the final election round, and (Hong Kong) Chinese candidate Margaret Chan was later elected.

In 2007, the European Commission appointed Kouchner as its representative on the International Independent Group of Eminent Persons (IIGEP), a group of individuals nominated by international donor countries and the government of Sri Lanka, vested with a wide mandate to observe all investigations and inquiries conducted by and on behalf of the Commission of Inquiry into alleged human rights abuses in Sri Lanka.

===Minister of Foreign Affairs, 2007–2010===
After the election of Nicolas Sarkozy as President of France in 2007, Kouchner was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs in Prime Minister François Fillon&#x27;s government, even though Kouchner supported Sarkozy&#x27;s Socialist rival Ségolène Royal during the campaign. He has since been expelled from the Socialist Party for his acceptance of the post.

Kouchner was dismissed in the November 2010 Fillon cabinet reshuffle.

==Political positions==
===On the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq===
Kouchner is a longtime advocate of humanitarian intervention. In early 2003, he pronounced himself in favour of removing Saddam Hussein as President of Iraq, arguing that interference against dictatorship should be a global priority, and continued to say that now, the focus should be on the actual people themselves, and that they are the only ones who could answer &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to war.

In a 4 February 2003 editorial with Antoine Veil in &quot;Le Monde&quot;, entitled &quot;Neither War Nor Saddam&quot;, Kouchner said that he was opposed to the impending War in Iraq, and, as the title suggests, to the remaining in power of Saddam Hussein, the removal of whom should be accomplished via a concerted UN, preferably diplomatic, solution. He later became a fierce critic of how the occupation was subsequently conducted.

===On Europe===
Kouchner is a well-known pro-European. He supported the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty when it was threatened to be rejected by the Irish in referendum. In the run up to the referendum in the Republic of Ireland on the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, Kouchner warned that any &quot;No&quot; vote towards the treaty would be detrimental to Ireland and the Irish economy. He also commented that &quot;It would be very, very awkward if we were not able to count on the Irish, who have often counted on Europe&quot;. His comments were dismissed as &quot;unhelpful&quot; by leading Irish politicians, and some media commentators have suggested that his remarks may have galvanised the &quot;No&quot; campaign in the run up to the rejection of the Lisbon Treaty on 13 June 2008.

In 2012, Kouchner co-signed the George Soros call for a strengthening of the European prerogatives as an answer to the eurozone crisis.

===Comments on Iran nuclear situation===
In September 2007, Kouchner&#x27;s public comments on the Iranian nuclear situation attracted much attention and controversy. In an interview on 16 September 2007, he said, &quot;We will negotiate until the end. And at the same time we must prepare ourselves [...] for the worst...The worst, it&#x27;s war&quot;. He stated that France was committed to a diplomatic resolution and that no military action was planned, but that an Iranian nuclear weapon would pose &quot;a real danger for the whole world&quot;.
Iranian officials criticized the comments as &quot;inflammatory&quot;. The chief UN nuclear inspector Mohamed ElBaradei, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency indirectly responded to Kouchner by characterizing talk of attacking Iran as &quot;hype&quot;, saying the use of force should only be considered as a last resort and only if authorized by the UN Security Council.

&quot;I would not talk about any use of force&quot;, he said. On 18 September 2007, Kouchner attempted to respond to criticisms. In comments to newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot;, he stated, &quot;I do not want it to be said that I am a warmonger! [...] My message was a message of peace, of seriousness and of determination. [...] The worst situation would be war. To avoid that, the French attitude is to negotiate, negotiate, negotiate, without fear of being rebuffed, and to work with our European friends on credible sanctions.&quot;

===Comments on a unity government for Zimbabwe===
On 1 July 2008, France assumed the presidency of the Council of the European Union. In his capacity as the French foreign minister, he commented after the African Union summit, that The European Union would only recognise a Zimbabwe unity government headed by Morgan Tsvangirai not Robert Mugabe.

===Use of condoms to prevent AIDS in Africa===
Kouchner denounced statements by Pope Benedict XVI claiming that condoms promoted AIDS, saying they were &quot;the opposite of tolerance and understanding&quot;.

==Life after politics==
After leaving politics, Kouchner took on a variety of positions, including the following:
* American University of Kurdistan (AUK), Member of the Board of Trustees
* Aurora Prize, Member of the Selection Committee (since 2017)
* &quot;Devex&quot;, Member of the Board of Advisors

* Fondation Agir Contre l&#x27;Exclusion (FACE), Member of the Board
* International Campaign for Tibet (ICT), Member of the International Council of Advisors
* Toledo International Centre for Peace (CITpax), Member of the Advisory Council

==Personal life==
Kouchner has three children (Julien, Camille and Antoine) by his first wife, Évelyne Pisier, a law professor, and one child, Alexandre, by his present wife Christine Ockrent, a TV anchor and author.

==Honours==
* Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement (2005)

<text>No. 78 Squadron of the Royal Air Force, is the squadron number plate of RAF (Unit) Swanwick based at London Area Control Centre, Swanwick, Hampshire. The squadron was allocated the role in early 2021. 

Between January 2008 and September 2014 it operated the AgustaWestland Merlin HC3/3A transport helicopter from RAF Benson until 30 September 2014, when the Merlins were transferred to the Commando Helicopter Force of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm at RNAS Yeovilton.

Between May 1986 and December 2007, No. 78 Squadron was based at RAF Mount Pleasant, Falkland Islands, operating Westland Sea King HAR3s and until 2006 the Boeing Chinook HC2.

==History==

===First World War===
No. 78 Squadron was formed as part of the Royal Flying Corps on 1 November 1916 for home defence at Harrietsham and tasked with protecting the southern English coast. It was originally equipped with obsolescent B.E.2 two-seat biplanes, and the closely related B.E.12 single-seater. On the night of 25 September 1917 a Captain Bell of the squadron encountered a German Gotha and attacked it over RAF Joyce Green. John Rawlings, writing in &quot;Fighter Squadrons of the Royal Air Force&quot; (1969), stated that &#x27;it was believed that he damaged it for one of the German raiders failed to return that night, being lost at sea.&#x27; The squadron received Sopwith 1½ Strutters in late 1917, followed by Sopwith Camels in mid-1918. It arrived at Sutton&#x27;s Farm, under the command of Major Cuthbert Rowden, in September 1917 and was there until December 1919, with a detachment at RAF Biggin Hill. The squadron disbanded on 31 December 1919 following the Armistice.

===Reformation and Second World War===

During the buildup of the RAF in the period before World War II, No. 78 Squadron was reformed at RAF Boscombe Down on 1 November 1936, twenty-two years after it was first formed, by redesignating a flight of the Handley Page Heyford equipped No. 10 Squadron. The new squadron moved to RAF Dishforth in Yorkshire early in 1937, joining No. 4 Group RAF of RAF Bomber Command. In July 1937 it was equipped with Armstrong Whitworth Whitley night bombers.

On the outbreak of the Second World War, the squadron was designated as a training squadron. It moved to RAF Linton-on-Ouse on 15 October 1939, returning to Dishforth in July when it returned to front-line duties as a night bomber squadron. In February 1941, Whitleys from No. 78 Squadron and No. 51 Squadron, flying from Malta, were used to drop paratroops over southern Italy for Operation Colossus, the first British paratroop operation of the Second World War. In April 1941, the squadron moved to RAF Middleton St. George. In September, the squadron flew its first bombing raid against Berlin. It moved again, to RAF Croft, in October 1941.
In early 1942, the squadron started to receive four-engine Handley Page Halifaxes to replace its Whitleys, with conversion being completed in March that year, and flying its first operation with the Halifax, against Ostend on 29 April 1942. On the night of 30/31 May 1942, No. 78 Squadron contributed 22 Halifaxes to Operation Millennium, the first &quot;1,000 bomber&quot; raid against Cologne.

The squadron moved back to Middleton St. George in June 1942 and to Linton-on-Ouse in September 1942. In June 1943, the squadron moved to RAF Breighton to free up Linton-on Ouse for the Canadian bomber force of No. 6 Group.

In January 1944, the squadron replaced its Merlin-powered Halifax B.IIs with Halifax B.IIIs, powered by Bristol Hercules radial engines which gave greater performance. The squadron continued in the bomber mission until the end of the war in Europe, both against German cities and in direct support of allied ground forces during and after the invasion of France in June 1944. In total, the squadron had dropped 17,000 tonnes of bombs and mines during 6,337 operational sorties, losing 182 aircraft but claiming 28 enemy fighters shot down.

===Transport operations (1945–1971)===
In May 1945, the squadron was transferred into Transport Command, re-equipping with Douglas Dakota Mk.IVs in July–August 1945 and moving to Cairo in September, flying transport operations around the Middle East and Air-Sea Rescue patrols over the Eastern Mediterranean. It remained active in the post-war period as a transport squadron, converting to Vickers Valetta C.1s in April 1950, before being disbanded at RAF Fayid in Egypt on 30 September 1954.

The squadron was reformed on 15 April 1956 at RAF Khormaksar in Aden, operating Scottish Aviation Pioneer CC.1 single-engine STOL transports. These were replaced by larger, twin-engined, Scottish Aviation Twin Pioneer CC.1s in November 1958. The unit was awarded its squadron standard on 1 April 1962 by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, having reached 25 years of service. In 1965 these were transferred to No. 21 Squadron and the squadron converted to a helicopter unit operating the Wessex. It transferred to RAF Sharjah in 1967, continuing to fly in the army support and Search and Rescue roles until being disbanded on 1 December 1971.

===Helicopter operations (1986–2014)===
The Squadron reformed on 22 May 1986 when No. 1310 Flight, operating Boeing Chinooks, and the Westland Sea King HAR.3 equipped No. 1564 Flight merged at RAF Mount Pleasant in the Falkland Islands.

From 1988, No. 78 Squadron was based in the Falkland Islands. The squadron operated Westland Sea King HAR.3 and Chinook HC2s.
In December 2007, No. 78 Squadron reverted to its previous identity of No. 1564 Flight and a new No. 78 Squadron stood-up at RAF Benson as part of the Joint Helicopter Command on 28 January 2008, flying the AgustaWestland Merlin HC3 and six new Merlin HC3A helicopters purchased from Denmark. The squadron shared the total fleet of twenty eight RAF Merlin helicopters with No. 28 (AC) Squadron, also based at RAF Benson.

Following the transfer of the squadron&#x27;s Merlins to 846 Naval Air Squadron of the Fleet Air Arm, No. 78 Squadron was disbanded on 30 September 2014.

On 24 March 2020, the squadron was awarded a battle honour, recognising its role in the War in Iraq between 2003 and 2011.

=== Military air traffic control (2021 – present) ===
The squadron number plate was allocated to RAF (Unit) Swanwick during early 2021. The unit is embedded in the civilian London Area Control Centre, based at Swanwick in Hampshire and provides a military air traffic control service across the UK.

<text>The Miami River is a stream in upstate New York and is a part of the Hudson River watershed. The river&#x27;s headwaters rise in the Adirondack Mountains at about northwest of Speculator and flows southeast for about with Pillsbury Mountain on the southwest and Page Mountain to the northeast. It turns sharply southwest for about one mile and then turns sharply east for about a mile, after which it flows mostly northeast for about before flowing into Lewey Lake at . Lewey Lake empties into Indian Lake, which is drained by the Indian River, which then flows into the Hudson River approximately to the northeast of Lewey Lake.

<doc id="1027403" wikidata="Q620464" url="?curid=1027403" title="G-code">
<text>G-code (abbreviation for geometric code; also called RS-274) is the most widely used computer numerical control (CNC) and 3D printing programming language. It is used mainly in computer-aided manufacturing to control automated machine tools, as well as for 3D-printer slicer applications. G-code has many variants.

G-code instructions are provided to a machine controller (industrial computer) that tells the motors where to move, how fast to move, and what path to follow. The two most common situations are that, within a machine tool such as a lathe or mill, a cutting tool is moved according to these instructions through a toolpath cutting away material to leave only the finished workpiece and/or an unfinished workpiece is precisely positioned in any of up to nine axes around the three dimensions relative to a toolpath and, either or both can move relative to each other. The same concept also extends to noncutting tools such as forming or burnishing tools, photoplotting, additive methods such as 3D printing, and measuring instruments.

== History ==

The first implementation of a numerical control programming language was developed at the MIT Servomechanisms Laboratory in the 1950s. In the decades that followed, many implementations were developed by numerous organizations, both commercial and noncommercial. Elements of G-code had often been used in these implementations. The first standardized version of G-code used in the United States, &quot;RS-274&quot;, was published in 1963 by the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA; then known as Electronic Industries Association). In 1974, EIA approved &quot;RS-274-C&quot;, which merged &quot;RS-273&quot; (variable block for positioning and straight cut) and &quot;RS-274-B&quot; (variable block for contouring and contouring/positioning). A final revision of &quot;RS-274&quot; was approved in 1979, as &quot;RS-274-D&quot;. In other countries, the standard &quot;ISO 6983&quot; (finalized in 1982) is often used, but many European countries use other standards. For example, &quot;DIN 66025&quot; is used in Germany, and PN-73M-55256 and PN-93/M-55251 were formerly used in Poland.

During the 1970s through 1990s, many CNC machine tool builders attempted to overcome compatibility difficulties by standardizing on machine tool controllers built by Fanuc. Siemens was another market dominator in CNC controls, especially in Europe. In the 2010s, controller differences and incompatibility were mitigated with the widespread adoption of CAD/CAM applications that were capable of outputting machine operations in the appropriate G-code for a specific machine through a software tool called a post-processor (sometimes shortened to just a &quot;post&quot;).

== Syntax ==

G-code began as a limited language that lacked constructs such as loops, conditional operators, and programmer-declared variables with natural-word-including names (or the expressions in which to use them). It was unable to encode logic but was just a way to &quot;connect the dots&quot; where the programmer figured out many of the dots&#x27; locations longhand. The latest implementations of G-code include macro language capabilities somewhat closer to a high-level programming language. Additionally, all primary manufacturers (e.g., Fanuc, Siemens, Heidenhain) provide access to programmable logic controller (PLC) data, such as axis positioning data and tool data, via variables used by NC programs. These constructs make it easier to develop automation applications.

== Extensions and variations ==

Extensions and variations have been added independently by control manufacturers and machine tool manufacturers, and operators of a specific controller must be aware of the differences between each manufacturer&#x27;s product.

One standardized version of G-code, known as &quot;BCL&quot; (Binary Cutter Language), is used only on very few machines. Developed at MIT, BCL was developed to control CNC machines in terms of straight lines and arcs.

Some CNC machines use &quot;conversational&quot; programming, which is a wizard-like programming mode that either hides G-code or completely bypasses the use of G-code. Some popular examples are Okuma&#x27;s Advanced One Touch (AOT), Southwestern Industries&#x27; ProtoTRAK, Mazak&#x27;s Mazatrol, Hurco&#x27;s Ultimax and Winmax, Haas&#x27; Intuitive Programming System (IPS), and Mori Seiki&#x27;s CAPS conversational software.

<doc id="1027405" wikidata="Q464910" url="?curid=1027405" title="Mukhtar Mai">
<text>Mukhtaran Bibi (; born ), now known as Mukhtār Mā&#x27;ī, is a Pakistani human rights activist from the village of Meerwala, located in the rural &quot;tehsil&quot; of Jatoi in the Muzaffargarh District of Punjab, Pakistan. In June 2002, Mā&#x27;ī was the victim of a gang-rape sanctioned by a tribal council of the local &quot;Mastoi Baloch&quot; clan, as a form of &#x27;honour revenge&#x27;; the council ruling was a result of a dispute between the wealthier Mastoi Baloch and Mā&#x27;ī&#x27;s &quot;Tatla&quot; clan.

Although local custom would expect her to commit suicide after being raped, Mā&#x27;ī spoke up and pursued a case against her rapists, which was picked up by both domestic and international media. On 1 September 2002, an anti-terrorism court sentenced six men, including the four rapists, to death for rape. However, in 2005, the Lahore High Court cited &quot;insufficient evidence&quot; and subsequently acquitted five of the six convicted rapists, while commuting the punishment of the sixth man to a life sentence. Mā&#x27;ī and the government appealed this decision, leading the Supreme Court of Pakistan to suspend the acquittal and hold hearings for an appeal; In April 2011, the Supreme Court set aside the acquittals of four of the men, but confirmed the acquittal of the other five. Mukhataran Bibi&#x27;s attorney and supporters planned an appeal of the verdict.

Though the safety of Mā&#x27;ī and her family and friends has been in jeopardy since the incident, she remains an outspoken advocate for women&#x27;s rights in Pakistan and elsewhere. She started the &quot;Mukhtar Mai Women&#x27;s Welfare Organization&quot; to help support and educate women in rural areas throughout Pakistan. In April 2007, Mā&#x27;ī won the North–South Prize from the Council of Europe. In 2005, &quot;Glamour&quot; magazine named her &#x27;Woman of the Year&#x27;. According to a 2006 &quot;The New York Times&quot; report, &quot;Her autobiography is the No. 3 best seller in France, and movies are being made about her. She has been praised by dignitaries like Laura Bush and the French foreign minister&quot;. However, on 8 April 2007, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Mā&#x27;ī lives in fear for her life due to threats from the Pakistani government and local feudal lords. Former President of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf has admitted on his personal blog that he placed restrictions on her movement in 2005, as he was fearful that her work and the publicity it received would hurt the international image of Pakistan.

== Rape incident ==
Mai&#x27;s 12-year-old brother, Abdul Shakoor Tatla (or Shakur Tatla), was abducted by three Baloch Mastoi men. He was taken to a sugar field where he was gang raped and sodomized repeatedly. When the boy refused to stay silent about the incident, he was kept imprisoned in the home of Abdul Khaliq, a Mastoi man. When police came to investigate, Shakoor was accused of having an affair with Khaliq&#x27;s sister, Salma Naseen, who was in her late 20s at the time. Shakoor was then arrested on charges of adultery but later released. In later trials, Shakoor&#x27;s rapists were convicted of sodomy and sentenced to five years of imprisonment.

The Mastoi tribal council (jirga) convened separately regarding Shakoor&#x27;s alleged affair with Naseen. They concluded that Shakoor should marry Naseen while Mai be married to a Mastoi man. Villagers rejected this conclusion due to the belief that adultery must be punished with adultery. Mai was called to the council to apologize to the Mastoi tribe for her brother&#x27;s actions. When she arrived, she was dragged to a nearby hut where she was gang raped in retaliation by four Mastoi men while an additional 10 people watched. Following the rape, she was paraded nude through the village. Her clothes were presented as evidence in court and following the medical examination of Mukhtaran and chemical analysis of her clothes at least two semen stains were revealed.

== Media coverage ==
In the following days, the story became headline news in Pakistan, and remained so for months. By 3 July, the BBC had picked up on the story. &quot;Time&quot; magazine ran a story on the case on 15 July 2002.

== Government reactions ==
The Government of Pakistan awarded Mukhtaran with a sum of 500,000 rupees (4518 U.S. dollars) on 5 July 2002. Mukhtaran reportedly told Attiya Inayatullah, the Women&#x27;s Development Minister who gave her the cheque that she &quot;would have committed suicide if the government had not come to her help.&quot;

===Exit-Control List===
On 10 June 2005, shortly before she was scheduled to fly to London on the invitation of Amnesty International, Mukhtaran was put on Pakistan&#x27;s Exit Control List (ECL), a list of people prohibited from traveling abroad, a move that prompted protest in Pakistan and around the world. Parvez Musharraf was out of the country in Australia and New Zealand, but admitted to the press that he had placed Mukhtaran on the blacklist, because he did not &quot;want to project a bad image of Pakistan&quot;. Although Pakistan had claimed that Mukhtaran had decided on her own not to go to the U.S., because her mother was sick (which she was not), Musharraf in effect acknowledged that this was a lie.

On 12 June 2005 Mukhtaran was abruptly asked by the government to travel to Lahore to meet with provincial assembly member Shagufta Anwar, and then go to Islamabad to meet with Presidential advisor, Nilofer Bakhtiar. Mukhtaran stated that she did not know the purpose of the trip but knew that she would be meeting &quot;one Shagufta and in Islamabad the PM’s adviser&quot;. She again criticized the police personnel assigned at her residence in Meerwala, saying that they had made life miserable for her and her family, and that her aide Naseem was denied exit from Mukhtaran&#x27;s house. Furthermore, the local police were pressing her to surrender her passport, coinciding with an invitation extended by an organization of Pakistani doctors in North America for Mukhtaran to attend a being organized there that month to discuss the state of women and human rights in Pakistan. Mukhtaran observed that &quot;I think the government does not want me to attend that moot (..) for this reason, perhaps, my name has been put on the Exit Control List&quot;.

On 13 June following a lunch at the Chief Minister&#x27;s House in Lahore, she left for Islamabad with Bakhtiar&#x27;s secretary assigned to &#x27;escort&#x27; her. Contact with Mukhtaran could not be established to know the purpose of her visit to Lahore, because her cellular phone did not respond for hours.

On 14 June 2005, at a press conference in Islamabad, Mukhtaran demanded removal of her name from the Exit Control List, and also complained that she was &quot;virtually under house arrest&quot; because of the large police contingent assigned to protect her.

Asma Jahangir, a Pakistani human rights lawyer confirmed that Mukhtaran had been taken to Islamabad, furiously berated and told that Musharraf was very angry with her. She was led sobbing to detention at a secret location and barred from contacting anyone, including her lawyer. Jahangir said Mukhtaran was in illegal custody.

===Passport confiscated===
On 19 June 2005, &quot;The New York Times&quot; columnist Nicholas D. Kristof reported that as Mai returned from the US embassy in Islamabad, after getting her passport stamped with a US visa, it was &quot;confiscated&quot; by Musharraf&#x27;s government, they were claiming she was now free to travel to the U.S., and removing her name from the ECL, thus rendering her unable to travel outside the country. A column by Khalid Hasan in Pakistan&#x27;s &quot;Daily Times&quot; called the government&#x27;s actions &quot;folly&quot; and &quot;ham-fisted&quot;, and said that it had &quot;failed abjectly&quot; to support the liberal &quot;convictions it claims to have&quot; with actions. Mai has since refused to talk about what happened in Islamabad, when she withdrew her application for a visa to the United States or who had taken her passport.

On 27 June 2005 Mukhtaran&#x27;s passport was returned to her.

On 29 June 2005, on his official website, Musharraf wrote that &quot;Mukhtaran Mai is free to go wherever she pleases, meet whoever she wants and say whatever she pleases.&quot;

== Legal case ==
=== Anti-Terrorist Court ===
Mukhtaran&#x27;s attackers, and the Mastoi of the so-called &quot;panchayat&quot; that conspired in her rape, were sentenced to death by the Dera Ghazi Khan Anti-Terror Court (ATC) in 2002. The ATC venue was ruled appropriate in this case because the Mastoi had intimidated and terrorized (and continue to threaten) Mukhtaran&#x27;s Tatla Clan and the people of the area. The court convicted six men (four rapists and two of the village jurors) and sentenced them to death on 1 September 2002. Eight other accused men were released. Mai filed an appeal with the Multan bench of the Lahore high court against the acquittal of the eight men set free on 3 September 2002.

Mai went on to become a symbol for advocates for the health and security of women in her region, attracting both national and international attention to these issues. Mukhtaran used the compensation money awarded by the Pakistani government as well as donations from around the world to build two local schools for girls.

=== Appeal and the Lahore High Court ===
On 3 March, the Lahore High Court reversed the judgement by the trial court on the basis of &quot;insufficient evidence&quot; and subsequently five of the six men sentenced to death were acquitted. The Pakistani government decided to appeal the acquittal, and Mukhtaran asked the court not to order the release of the five men, who then remained in detention under a law that allows for a 90-day detention without charges.

=== Legal representation ===
Mukhtaran has been represented by panels of lawyers. One such team is headed by Pakistan&#x27;s Attorney General, Makhdoom Ali Khan. Another panel is led by Aitzaz Ahsan, a lawyer and politician belonging to the Pakistan Peoples Party, who has been representing Mukhtaran pro bono. However, her rapists were found not guilty. Advocate Malik Muhammad Saleem won this case against Mukhtaran and the accused were released. The Federal Sharia Court in Pakistan decided to suspend this decision of Lahore High Court on 11 March, arguing that Mai&#x27;s case should have been tried under the Islamic Hudood laws. Three days later the Supreme Court ruled that the Federal Sharia Court did not have the authority to overrule the decision and decided to hear the case in the Supreme Court.

=== Retrial of rapists ===
The Lahore high court ruled on 6 June 2005 that the accused men could be released on payment of a 50,000 rupees ($840) bond. However, the men were unable to come up with the money, and remained in jail while the prosecution appealed against their acquittal. Just over two weeks later, the Supreme Court intervened and suspended the acquittals of five men as well as the eight who were acquitted at the original trial in 2002. All 14 were retried in the Supreme Court.

On 21 April 2011, the Supreme Court set aside the Lahore High Court&#x27;s acquittal of A. Ditta, Ghulam Farid, Faiz Mastoi and Ramzan Parchar. However the Supreme Court confirmed acquittal of Khalil Ahmad, Ghulam Hussain, Qasim Rasool, Hazoor and Nazar Hussain for being falsely implicated by Mukhtar Mai. Mukhataran Bibi&#x27;s attorney and supporters planned and to file a review petition against this verdict.

== Threats ==
On 8 April 2007, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Mukhtaran was living in fear for her life of the Pakistani government and local feudal lords. It also reported that Mukhtaran&#x27;s friends, colleagues and their families are at great risk from violence by local feudal lords, and/or the government of Pakistan.

== Post-case work ==
Mukhtaran began to work to educate girls, and to promote education with a view towards raising awareness to prevent future honour crimes. Out of this work grew the organization Mukhtar Mai Women&#x27;s Welfare Organization (MMWWO). The goals of MMWWO are to help the local community, especially women, through education and other projects. The main focus of her work is to educate young girls, and to educate the community about women&#x27;s rights and gender issues. Her organization teaches young girls, and tries to make sure they stay in school, rather than work or get married. In Fall 2007, a high school will be started by her group. The MMWWO also provides shelter and legal help for people, often women, who are victims of violence or injustice.

== 2009–present ==
On 11 December 2008, Mukhtaran was informed by Sardar Abdul Qayyum, the sitting Federal Minister for Defence Production, to drop the charge against the accused. According to Mukhtaran, the minister called her uncle, Ghulam Hussain, to his place in Jatoi and passed on a message to Mukhtaran that she should drop the charges against the thirteen accused of the Mastoi tribe, who were involved either in the verdict against Mukhtaran, or who gang raped her. The minister said that, if she did not comply, he and his associates would not let the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision go in favour of Mukhtaran. It is believed that the Mastoi clan have political influence of sufficient weight to bring pressure to bear on the supreme court via establishment and political figures. The Supreme Court of Pakistan had listed Mukhtaran case for hearing in the second week of February 2009 (hearing was expected on 10 or 11 February).

On 11 June 2009, the Multan Electric Power Company raided the MMWWO (Mukhtar Mai&#x27;s Women Welfare Organization) in Meerwala, Pakistan, disconnecting all electricity to the grounds, falsely accusing the organization of stealing electricity despite records proving they have paid all bills in full. MMWWO and hundreds of families in the surrounding area were without power for several days. Today, while the power to the surrounding area has been restored, the MMWWO grounds, which house the Mukhtaran Girls Model School, Women&#x27;s Resource Centre, and Shelter Home for battered women (whose premises was raided despite the fact that men are strictly prohibited), are still enduring blistering temperatures. According to MMWWO employees, who were witnesses, the power company officials claimed that the raid was ordered by Abdul Qayyum Jatoi, the Federal Minister for Defense Production. This raid has significantly hindered the ability of Mai&#x27;s organization to carry out its important human rights work, providing services for vulnerable women, girls and boys.

Hearings for the Supreme Court case have repeatedly been delayed, while her attackers remain imprisoned and her case is pending.

In June 2010, it was reported that Pakistan Peoples Party legislator Jamshed Dasti has threatened Mai to withdraw her appeal in the Supreme Court against the accused rapists. Mai said in an exclusive interview to the &quot;Express Tribune&quot; that Dasti threatened her last week through his messengers in Mir Wala (Muzaffargarh) and through the supporters of Federal Minister for Defence Production, Sardar Qayyum Jatoi, whose constituency she resides in, is putting pressure on her family in various ways, for example, to remove the police check post from outside their house. She stated her family was living in fear. Dasti, a critic of Mai, confirmed that he had requested her to reach a compromise on the matter.

On 21 April 2011, Malik Saleem, defense lawyer for the men accused of gang-raping Mukhtaran Mai under orders of the Mastoi clan, announced that five have been acquitted by the Supreme Court of Pakistan while the sixth suspect, Abdul Khalique had his life sentence upheld. Although the release of the suspects places Mukhtaran Mai in even greater danger she has vowed not to shut down her school. The Supreme Court&#x27;s decision shocked and disappointed many Pakistanis, especially human rights activists.

==Awards and acclaim==
* On 2 August 2005, the Pakistani government awarded Mukhtaran the Fatima Jinnah gold medal for bravery and courage.
* On 2 November 2005, the US magazine &quot;Glamour&quot; named Mukhtaran as their Woman Of The Year.
* On 12 January 2006, Mukhtaran Mai published her memoir with the collaboration of Marie-Thérèse Cuny under the title &quot;Déshonorée&quot;. The originating publisher of the book is OH ! Editions in France and her book was published simultaneously in German by Droemer Verlag as &quot;Die Schuld, eine Frau zu sein&quot;.
* On 16 January 2006, to coincide with the publication of her memoir, Mukhtaran Mai travelled to Paris (France) and was received by Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy.
* On 2 May 2006, Mukhtaran spoke at the United Nations headquarters in New York. In an interview with United Nations TV, Mai said that &quot;she wanted to get the message across to the world that one should fight for their rights and for the rights of the next generation.&quot; She was welcomed by UN Under-Secretary General Shashi Tharoor, who said, “I think it is fair to say that anyone who has the moral courage and internal strength to turn such a brutal attack into a weapon to defend others in a similar position, is a hero indeed, and is worthy of our deepest respect and admiration.”
* On 31 October 2006, Mukhtaran&#x27;s memoir was released in the United States as &quot;In the Name of Honor: A Memoir&quot;.
* On 15 November 2006, Pakistan&#x27;s lower house of Parliament voted to alter its rape laws to move them from religious law to penal code, effectively separating rape from adultery. It also modifies the law to no longer require that the victim produce four witnesses of the assault, and it allows circumstantial and forensic evidence be used for investigation. The bill reduced the penalty for adultery from execution to a maximum of five years&#x27; incarceration and a 10,000 rupee fine. A modified version of the bill, called the Protection of Women Bill, was signed by Musharraf in late 2006. Critics of the final version of the law complained that &quot;[a] judge can still decide whether rape cases will be heard in a civil or an Islamic court. Rape victims will have to report their complaints to district courts, not at local police stations, compelling many to travel long distances. As a result, many will be discouraged.&quot;
* In March 2007, Mukhtaran formally received the 2006 North-South Prize of the Council of Europe for her contribution to human rights. In April 2007, Mukhtaran Mai won the North-South Prize from the Council of Europe.
* In October 2010, Laurentian University of Canada decided to award an honorary doctorate degree to Mukhtar Mai.

==In popular culture==

In 2008 Mukhtaran&#x27;s experiences were the subject of a documentary by Catherine Ulmer López focusing on the aftermath of the rape especially on Mukhtaran&#x27;s schools as well as an important look inside Pakistan, &quot;where the impact of Islamic fundamentalism is revealed and how women are fighting its oppressive and violent impact.&quot; The documentary was shown at the Starz Denver Festival, the 7th Human Rights Film Festival and the 22nd International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam in 2009.

In 2014, the chamber opera &quot;Thumbprint&quot; opened in New York, based on a song cycle that was first performed in 2009. The earlier song cycle was composed by Kamala Sankaram, and Susan Yankowitz helped to transform it into the opera. Sankaram sang the lead role of Mai. &quot;Thumbprint&quot; made its Los Angeles premiere in June 2017.

<doc id="1027406" wikidata="Q26848" url="?curid=1027406" title="Big Van Vader">
<text>Leon Allen White (May 14, 1955 – June 18, 2018), better known by his ring names Big Van Vader or simply Vader, was an American professional wrestler and professional football player. Throughout his career, he performed for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), Catch Wrestling Association (CWA), World Championship Wrestling (WCW), the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), and Pro Wrestling Noah (NOAH) during the 1990s and 2000s. He is widely regarded as the greatest super-heavyweight professional wrestler of all time.

White performed as a monstrous wrestler, and he was capable of aerial maneuvers: his diving moonsault was voted the &quot;Best Wrestling Maneuver&quot; of 1993 by &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; (&quot;WON&quot;) readers. White is a 12-time world champion—he won the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, the CWA World Heavyweight Championship and the WCW World Heavyweight Championship three times each, the UWA World Heavyweight Championship once and the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship twice. In 1989 he held IWGP title (Japan), CWA title (Austria), and UWA title (Mexico) at the same time. He also won the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship once, and won the battle royal main event of the 1993 Battlebowl pay-per-view (PPV)—among other accolades in WCW, Mexico and Japan. He headlined multiple PPV events for the WWF and WCW. Vader was inducted into the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; Hall of Fame in 1996 and the WWE Hall of Fame in 2022.

==Early life==
Leon Allen White was born in Lynwood, California, on May 14, 1955, and grew up in Compton, California. He was raised with his sister in a rough area of Los Angeles known as South Central, where the siblings experienced a home break-in. His father was a US Marine. His father also was an underwater welder for the US Navy and invented an automobile hoist, which made the family wealthier and let them move to a safer neighborhood in Bell, where White attended Bell High School. In high school, he competed in shot put on the track and field team, wrestled, and played football.

==American football career==
White was a nationally ranked center that was recruited by forty colleges. He played offensive line at the University of Colorado, where he was named a second-team All-American at guard by United Press International for the Buffaloes in 1977. He earned a business administration degree.

===Professional career===

In the 1978 NFL draft, White was drafted as a center by the Los Angeles Rams with the 24th pick of the 3rd Round (80th overall). White&#x27;s second season saw the Rams go to the Super Bowl and earned White an NFC championship ring. White spent the season on the injured reserve list due to knee problems. He did not play a single down and registered no statistics. White was forced into retirement by a ruptured patella.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== American Wrestling Association (1985–1987) ===
While working out at a gym, White was spotted by a man who remembered him from his college football days who suggested he look into professional wrestling. Trained by Brad Rheingans, White got his first national exposure in the American Wrestling Association (AWA). He went by the moniker Baby Bull, which was later changed to Bull Power. White honed his skills during this time, and his ring work improved significantly to the point that he was booked in a match with Stan Hansen for the AWA World Heavyweight Championship, in which he was defeated.

=== Catch Wrestling Association (1986–1987, 1989–1991) ===
In May 1986, White went to Europe to compete for Otto Wanz and his promotion, Catch Wrestling Association, touring Austria and Germany, using the name Bull Power. That summer, he took part in the three-day tournament for the Vienna Catch Cup, in Austria. He made it to the finals, before losing to Klaus Wallas. On March 22, 1987, he won his first championship, the CWA World Heavyweight Championship, defeating Otto Wanz in Denver, Colorado, ending Wanz&#x27;s reign of nearly nine years in its only title change in the United States. He held onto the title for nearly four months, before losing it back to Wanz on July 11 in Graz, Austria. In December 1987, he participated in his second tournament, the Bremen Catch Cup, in Germany. He defeated Rambo in the finals, to win his first tournament.

In 1989, Bull Power returned to the CWA, to challenge Otto Wanz for the CWA World Heavyweight Championship. On August 21 in Vienna, Austria, he defeated Wanz to win his second CWA World title. He held onto the title for a little over four months before losing it back to Wanz in Bremen, Germany, on December 22. A year later, Otto Wanz retired and the CWA World title was held up. Bull Power defeated Rambo to win the vacant title for the third and final time. He held to the title for over six months, before losing it to Rambo in Graz, Austria on July 6, 1991. Five months later, he defeated Tatsumi Fujinami to become the inaugural CWA Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion. He vacated the title in 1992 after signing with World Championship Wrestling.

=== New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1987–1992) ===
==== Takeshi Puroresu Gundan (1987–1988) ====
Although originally signed to All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), AJPW owner Giant Baba traded White&#x27;s contract over to New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) in 1987 after consideration. Upon joining NJPW, White was given the ring name Big Van Vader and began to wear a black wrestling mask. His new identity was based on a strong warrior of the same name from Japanese folklore. On December 27, Vader was introduced as the crown jewel of the Takeshi Puroresu Gundan stable which was managed by Takeshi Kitano at the Year End in Kokukigan event. Vader challenged Antonio Inoki, who had already defeated Riki Choshu, and defeated the worn-down Inoki. The pro-Inoki audience rioted, resulting in NJPW being banned from Sumo Hall, its home arena. The ban remained in effect until 1989, when NJPW did its first show back in Sumo Hall on February 22.

Vader lost a rematch to Inoki via disqualification on January 4, 1988. He remained unpinned during the first few months of his NJPW career and was presented as a dominant competitor, often winning handicap matches against numerous opponents. On May 8, Vader faced Tatsumi Fujinami for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship after Inoki vacated the title due to an injury. Vader lost the match via disqualification, resulting in Fujinami winning the title. On June 26, Vader challenged Fujinami for the title in a rematch and lost the match. It marked Vader&#x27;s first pinfall loss in NJPW. Vader entered that year&#x27;s 1988 IWGP League to become the #1 contender for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, but failed to win the tournament, lasting it at third place. Vader continued to rise up the ranks in IWGP, becoming a huge main event star by the end of the year.

==== IWGP Heavyweight Champion (1989–1991) ====
After winning the final match of an eight-man tournament against Shinya Hashimoto at Battle Satellite in Tokyo Dome, Vader was declared the new IWGP Heavyweight Champion. He was the first gaijin (non-Japanese) wrestler to hold the title. On May 25, one month after being crowned champion, Vader lost the title to Russian suplex master Salman Hashimikov. Hashimikov dropped the title to Vader&#x27;s old rival, Riki Choshu, on July 12. On August 10, Vader defeated Choshu to become a two-time IWGP Heavyweight Champion.

On February 10, 1990, Vader faced Stan Hansen at an AJPW versus NJPW supercard show called Super Fight in Tokyo Dome. Before Vader entered the ring, Hansen accidentally broke Vader&#x27;s nose with the bull rope Hansen carried to the ring for his matches. During an exchange of stiff punches, Hansen unintentionally poked Vader&#x27;s left eye with his thumb during their brawl, which caused the eye to pop out of its socket. After removing his mask, pushing the eye back into its socket and holding it in place with his eyelid, Vader continued wrestling Hansen until the match was rendered a no contest. As a result of the injury, Vader required a metal plate to be surgically placed under his eye. Vader&#x27;s success garnered the attention of World Championship Wrestling (WCW), who convinced him to work for them while still the IWGP Heavyweight Champion and an active competitor in NJPW.

In January 1991, Vader defeated Tatsumi Fujinami to earn himself a third IWGP Heavyweight Title reign. During this match, Vader began bleeding from his eye, which required surgery when he returned to the United States. This reign was short-lived, however, as Vader lost the title back to Fujinami on March 4. At this point, WCW and NJPW were reaching a tentative working agreement. This benefited Vader, as he could now have his schedule coordinated far more easily. This helped alleviate his difficulty in gaining notoriety in WCW, as his previously infrequent appearances did not allow the audience to see him very often.

==== Big, Bad, and Dangerous (1992) ====
On March 1, 1992, he and Bam Bam Bigelow began teaming up as &quot;Big, Bad, and Dangerous&quot;. The duo went on to win the IWGP Tag Team Championship from Hiroshi Hase and Keiji Mutoh. In May, Vader faced Mutoh, now known as The Great Muta, one on one and suffered a legitimate knee injury. This injury was a factor in him and Bigelow losing the title to the WCW World Tag Team Champions, The Steiner Brothers after a nearly four-month reign. This also marked a decrease in his NJPW appearances, as Vader began to focus almost entirely on WCW and the WCW World Heavyweight Championship.

=== Universal Wrestling Association (1989–1990) ===
In November 1989, White, as Big Van Vader, made his debut in Mexico for Universal Wrestling Association. On November 12, he defeated El Canek to win the UWA World Heavyweight Championship. Five days later, he made a couple of shows for Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre in trios matches, teaming with Fabuloso Blondy. He kept the UWA World title for over a year, before losing it back to Canek on December 9.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1990–1995) ===

====Early run (1990–1991)====
Vader was originally signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1990 but was only used sparingly until 1991. Vader&#x27;s first match in WCW took place on July 7, 1990, at The Great American Bash, where he defeated Tom Zenk in a little over two minutes. Seven months later, he returned for WrestleWar, where he battled Stan Hansen to a double disqualification. Eight months later, he returned to Halloween Havoc and took part in the Chamber of Horrors match, in which Vader&#x27;s team lost due to Abdullah the Butcher being electrocuted by their partner, Cactus Jack. Two months later, he took part in Starrcade&#x27;s Lethal Lottery, where he teamed with Mr. Hughes and defeated Rick Steiner and The Nightstalker (who was subbing for an injured Diamond Studd) to advance to the Battlebowl battle royal, in which he was eliminated.

==== World Heavyweight Champion (1992–1993) ====
When he began working for WCW full-time, Vader was paired with a manager, Harley Race, and received a shot at Sting&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship on April 12, 1992, and was disqualified. Sting suffered a pair of cracked ribs and a ruptured spleen in the match after taking a &quot;Vader Bomb&quot; from Vader, though he continued to compete infrequently while recuperating. Vader received a rematch with Sting on July 12 at The Great American Bash, which he won to become the new WCW World Heavyweight Champion. His reign was short-lived, as he re-injured his knee, forcing him to lose the title three weeks later to Ron Simmons, who substituted for Sting after he was attacked by Jake Roberts earlier that night. Vader was out of action after Clash of the Champions in September as he underwent knee surgery. Upon his return at Halloween Havoc, Vader sent Nikita Koloff into retirement and legitimately sprained the back of jobber Joe Thurman, sending him to the hospital. At Starrcade, Vader lost to Sting in the finals of the King of Cable tournament. Two days later, Vader defeated Simmons by taking advantage of a shoulder injury of Simmons&#x27;s to regain the World Heavyweight Championship. On March 11, 1993, Vader lost the WCW World Heavyweight Championship to Sting but regained it six days later.

Upon returning to WCW, Mick Foley, then wrestling as Cactus Jack, defeated Vader via count out on the April 17 episode of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;. During the match, Jack suffered a broken nose and needed 27 stitches on his face. The match was heavily edited for broadcast, as WCW did not wish to show severe bleeding. In a rematch on April 24, Vader powerbombed Jack onto the concrete floor outside the ring, resulting in Jack suffering a concussion and temporary loss of feeling in his left hand and leg. In the meantime, Vader began to feud with a new arrival to WCW, Davey Boy Smith. They met at Slamboree in May for the World Heavyweight Championship. Vader lost by disqualification when he hit Smith with a chair, though he retained the title. Vader and Sid Vicious then formed a partnership and called themselves The Masters of the Powerbomb. They were defeated by Smith and his new partner, Sting, at Beach Blast in July. Following this, Vader and Cactus Jack&#x27;s feud was restarted as Jack was cleared to return for Halloween Havoc to face Vader in a Texas Death match. Vader won when Harley Race stunned Jack with a cattle prod that kept him down for a ten count. On March 16, 1994, Foley lost his right ear in a match with Vader in Munich, Germany; Foley&#x27;s head became trapped in the ropes, which were under excessive tension, causing his ear to be torn off.

Vader was originally scheduled to face Sid Vicious at Starrcade. The real-life dismissal of Vicious after his stabbing incident with Arn Anderson in England, however, forced WCW to find a quick replacement. Executive producer Eric Bischoff placed Ric Flair in the match, which was scheduled in Flair&#x27;s hometown of Charlotte, North Carolina. In the storyline, Vader did not take Flair seriously until he agreed to put his career on the line against Vader&#x27;s title. Vader dominated the match, but Flair capitalized on failed interference by Race and Vader&#x27;s weakened knees to win the match with a rollup and end Vader&#x27;s third World Heavyweight Championship reign.

====United States Champion; Dungeon of Doom (1994–1995)====
Big Van Vader continued to feud with Flair until SuperBrawl IV, when Flair once again defeated him, this time in a &quot;Thundercage&quot; match, with the help of the special guest referee The Boss. As a result, Vader began feuding with The Boss, whom he defeated at Spring Stampede. He also faced Sting at Slamboree for the vacant International World Heavyweight Championship. Sting requested the match rather than be awarded the title after an injury to his original opponent, Rick Rude, and defeated Vader. At Bash at the Beach, he defeated the former Boss, now known as The Guardian Angel by disqualification. Two months later at Fall Brawl, he defeated Angel and Sting in a triangle match to determine the number one contender for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, now held by Hulk Hogan. A month later at Halloween Havoc, he defeated the Guardian Angel in a rematch. At Clash of the Champions XXIX, Vader defeated Dustin Rhodes and earned the opportunity to face the United States Heavyweight Champion Jim Duggan, whom he defeated for the title at Starrcade.

In January 1995, Vader had to end his alliance with Harley Race, who left WCW after a real-life automobile crash. Vader confronted World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan, and informed him that he could not avoid the monster. The two met at SuperBrawl V, with Vader managing to kick out of Hogan&#x27;s leg drop after a count of one. The referee was knocked out before Vader hit the &quot;Vader Bomb&quot; on Hogan. Ric Flair ran to the ring, made the three count, and attacked Hogan, resulting in Vader&#x27;s disqualification. A rematch was signed, a strap match for the inaugural Uncensored pay-per-view. Flair once again intervened (this time in drag to avoid revealing his presence) and managed to cost Vader the match by getting himself carried by Hogan as he touched all four turnbuckle pads. Vader was stripped of the United States Heavyweight Championship on April 23, 1995, for multiple violent offenses. However, Vader gained another opportunity to win the World Heavyweight Championship from Hogan at Bash at the Beach in a Steel Cage match. He conspired with Kevin Sullivan and the Dungeon of Doom to gain a psychological edge before the encounter, which Vader lost when Hogan escaped the cage. He then restarted his feud with Flair, based on his frustration at Flair&#x27;s constant interference in his title matches and Flair&#x27;s annoyance at his inability to defeat Hogan. At Clash of the Champions XXXI, Vader defeated Flair and Arn Anderson in a 2-on-1 handicap match. Following the event, Hogan grew interested in Vader and asked for his assistance in his developing feud with the Dungeon of Doom by asking him to join him, Randy Savage, and Sting for WarGames. Vader complied but the storyline never developed as, shortly after, Vader was fired from WCW after a locker room brawl with Paul Orndorff.

The title video for the September 4 debut edition of &quot;Monday Nitro&quot; featured multiple shots of Vader (along with Hogan, Sting and Savage). Absent from the first episode, he had been scheduled to face Hogan for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship on the September 11 episode but was replaced by Lex Luger, who issued a challenge to Hogan on the debut show.

===UWF International (1993–1995)===
In late February 1993, White signed an eight-date agreement with the Union of Wrestling Forces International (UWFi), where he competed as Super Vader due to legal issues concerning the Big Van Vader name. By September 1993, he was simply known as Vader in the United States. He worked with UWFi for over two years, winning the Best of the World Tournament, which started on April 3 and ended on August 18, 1994. Vader first defeated Salman Hashimikov and then Masahito Kakihara in the quarterfinals. In the semifinals, Vader defeated Kiyoshi Tamura, and beat Nobuhiko Takada in the finals to win the tournament and the UWFi Pro-Wrestling World Heavyweight Championship. He would hold onto the title for over eight months, before losing the title to Takada on April 20, 1995. He left shortly thereafter.

=== Return to NJPW (1996) ===
At Wrestling World on January 4, Vader had his first post-WCW match, facing the man whose four-year winning streak Vader had ended over eight years prior, Antonio Inoki. Inoki was over 50 years old at the time, but the match lasted nearly fourteen minutes before Inoki won the match.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1996–1998) ===

==== Camp Cornette (1996–1997) ====
In the weeks leading up to the 1996 Royal Rumble, Vader&#x27;s debut was heavily hyped on television as he was billed as &quot;The Man They Call Vader&quot; (though Vince McMahon had originally wanted to rename him &quot;The Mastodon&quot;). He made his first World Wrestling Federation (WWF) appearance as a participant in the Royal Rumble match, as he entered at number 13 and eliminated Jake Roberts, Doug Gilbert, one member of the Squat Team, and Savio Vega; he also fought with his ally Yokozuna, but Vader was eliminated by Shawn Michaels before he re-entered the ring and started assaulting everyone, including Michaels. Vader defeated Vega on the following &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, before assaulting WWF officials and eventually, WWF President Gorilla Monsoon demanded that Vader cease his attacks and received a Vader Bomb for his efforts. As a result, Vader was suspended for his actions, though in reality, he needed time off for shoulder surgery.

Jim Cornette campaigned for Vader&#x27;s reinstatement, and by the time Vader returned, Yokozuna had left Cornette&#x27;s management. At February&#x27;s In Your House 6, Vader appeared during Yokozuna&#x27;s match against The British Bulldog, and as Yokozuna was about to pin The Bulldog, Vader attacked him, handcuffed him, and delivered a severe beating. This led to what was supposed to be a one-on-one encounter between Vader and Yokozuna at WrestleMania XII. However, the match became a six-man tag team match pitting Vader, Owen Hart, and The British Bulldog against Yokozuna, Ahmed Johnson, and Jake Roberts, with the stipulation that if Yokozuna&#x27;s team won the match, he would have five minutes alone with Cornette in the ring; this never occurred as Vader&#x27;s team won the match when Vader pinned Roberts.

Vader then attacked the WWF World Heavyweight Champion Shawn Michaels after one of Michaels&#x27; matches, which earned him a spot in a six-man tag team match at In Your House 9: International Incident, where Vader, Owen Hart, and The British Bulldog teamed up against Michaels, Ahmed Johnson, and Sycho Sid; Vader pinned Michaels to win the match for his team. Vader faced Michaels again at SummerSlam, where Michaels won by pinfall.

Following his feud with Michaels, Vader faced off against The Undertaker in a singles match at the Royal Rumble, and during the match, The Undertaker&#x27;s former manager, Paul Bearer, attacked him and helped Vader win; Bearer then became Vader&#x27;s manager. Both Vader and Undertaker went on to compete in the Royal Rumble match, during which Stone Cold Steve Austin was eliminated by Bret Hart; however, the referees did not see this, as they were attending to Terry Funk and Mankind on the floor, allowing Austin to sneak back into the ring and eliminate both Vader and Undertaker, then Bret Hart, who was busy eliminating Fake Diesel, and win the Royal Rumble. As a result of this, Vader and the other men eliminated by Austin, Bret Hart and The Undertaker, were put into the four-way main event of February&#x27;s In Your House 13: Final Four for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, in which Vader, after bleeding profusely, was eliminated by The Undertaker. Bearer then persuaded his two proteges, Vader and Mankind, to go after the WWF Tag Team Championship, despite the fact that the two men often brawled between themselves. They failed in their bid to win the tag team gold at WrestleMania 13.

==== Various feuds and departure (1997–1998) ====
Vader again received an opportunity to face The Undertaker, this time for the WWF Championship at In Your House 16: Canadian Stampede, but lost. On the following night&#x27;s &quot;Raw is War&quot;, Vader wrestled The Patriot, who won the match and then went after Bret Hart, who came to ringside during the match; Vader attacked The Patriot and then brought him back into the ring, where he went for the Vader Bomb, but Hart came into the ring and laid the Canadian flag over The Patriot, so Vader got down, picked up the Canadian flag, broke it, and started a brawl with Hart. This turned Vader face and served to bring Vader into the USA vs. Canada feud, which culminated at Survivor Series, where Vader was the leader of Team USA, with Goldust, Marc Mero, and Steve Blackman (replacing the injured Patriot) as they faced Team Canada, composed of the British Bulldog, Jim Neidhart, Doug Furnas, and Phil LaFon; during the match, Goldust walked out on his team and Team USA lost the match after The Bulldog pinned Vader after hitting him with the ring bell. Goldust and Vader feuded throughout the fall and finally faced off at the Royal Rumble, in a match that Vader won. Goldust eliminated Vader from the Royal Rumble match later that night (Vader entered at number 30).

Following his feud with Goldust, Vader began feuding with Kane, and both faced off for the first time at No Way Out of Texas, where Vader lost after a chokeslam and a Tombstone Piledriver before Kane subsequently attacked him with a large steel wrench, resulting in Vader being taken away on a stretcher and was kept off of television for a while. Two months later, at , Vader returned during Kane&#x27;s inferno match against The Undertaker; as Kane was attempting to leave the match, Vader appeared and fought him back to the ring to continue the match, which Kane lost. Vader and Kane had a rematch at Over the Edge in a mask vs. mask match, in which Vader attempted to use a wrench on Kane like the one used on him months before, but Kane managed to recover and defeat Vader, costing him his mask in the process. In a post-match interview with Michael Cole, Vader said, &quot;I made the biggest mistake of my life. Maybe Vader time is over. I&#x27;m nothing but a big piece of shit. A big fat piece of shit&quot;.

Subsequently, Vader had a series of losses and was reduced to the status of a jobber to the stars, having a feud with Mark Henry which Vader lost. After considering retirement, Vader instead negotiated his own release from the WWF so he could once again wrestle in Japan. His final WWF pay-per-view match was a loss to Bradshaw at in a No Holds Barred match. He lost to Edge on the October 11, 1998, episode of &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot; in his final televised WWF match. In a shoot interview, Jim Cornette said part of the reason that Vader&#x27;s WWF run was not as successful as what was hoped was due to the failure to properly book him.

=== All Japan Pro Wrestling (1998–2000) ===
After leaving the WWF, Vader returned to Japan. He returned to All Japan Pro Wrestling forming a team with his old foe Stan Hansen, with whom he made it to the finals of the 1998 World&#x27;s Strongest Tag Determination League, where they were defeated by Kenta Kobashi and Jun Akiyama. At the beginning of 1999, he became the number one contender to the Triple Crown by defeating Kobashi. He then won the (vacant) Triple Crown Title on March 6, 1999, by defeating Akira Taue. He then won the 1999 Champion Carnival. Vader lost the Triple Crown to Misawa on May 2, 1999, at the Giant Baba Memorial Show, and he regained it from Misawa on October 30.

While defending the Triple Crown, Vader won the World Tag Team Championship with a recently returned &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Steve Williams on February 20, 2000. However, the week after on February 27, Vader lost the Triple Crown to Kenta Kobashi. Upon losing the title, Vader continued defending his tag team titles with Williams before Vader took some time off, disappearing from TV in April 2000 after a singles loss to Misawa. The Tag Team titles were vacated that month, and Williams went on to feud with Mike Barton to set up their Brawl For All revenge angle.

=== Pro Wrestling NOAH (2000–2003) ===

Upon returning from his hiatus, Vader joined Mitsuharu Misawa&#x27;s newly created Pro Wrestling Noah promotion in October 2000. He had a strong dominance in the tag team division with 2 Cold Scorpio, where they had a great number of victories on television and pay-per-views. Vader earned many singles victories as well against several of the roster&#x27;s Japanese wrestlers. He often had matches against Jun Akiyama as part of a grudge feud that was carried over from their times facing each other in AJPW. While teaming together, Vader and Scorpio often found themselves fighting against Akiyama and whatever Japanese partner he had at the moment.

Vader and Scorpio won the grudge feud by defeating Jun Akiyama and Akitoshi Saito on an October 19, 2001, pay-per-view, where they became the inaugural GHC Tag Team Champions. They lost the titles to Mitsuharu Misawa and Yoshinari Ogawa on November 30. Having lost the tag team titles, Vader tried to reprioritize himself and pursue Jun Akiyama&#x27;s GHC Heavyweight Championship (the top title of the company), where it culminated in a much hyped pay-per-view main event on December 9, 2001. Vader lost the match by submitting to Akiyama, and right after the event he took a break from wrestling for two months.

Vader returned to NOAH&#x27;s television programs in March 2002. He and Scorpio continued teaming, and despite them not winning the titles again, they continued having many victories in the tag team and singles division throughout 2002. Vader&#x27;s last appearance in NOAH was in January 2003.

=== NWA Total Nonstop Action (2003, 2015) ===
On February 19, 2003, Vader appeared in NWA Total Nonstop Action (NWA-TNA) to defend Dusty Rhodes, who was fighting with The Harris Brothers. He and Dusty won a tag team match the next week against the Harris Brothers via disqualification. He then began a feud with Nikita Koloff, whose career Vader ended long ago. However, TNA and Vader soon parted ways.

Vader made a one-off return to TNA on the June 24, 2015, episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; for a singles match against Bram. Vader won the match via disqualification after Bram used a ring wrench to hit Vader in the head. Matt Morgan then entered the ring to save Vader and take out Bram. This was his final appearance for the company.

=== Sporadic returns to WWE (2005, 2012, 2016) ===

Vader returned to the WWF, now World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), on the October 31, 2005, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; when Jonathan Coachman announced that Vader and Goldust would be in his corner for his street fight against Stone Cold Steve Austin the next night at Taboo Tuesday. When Austin decided not to participate, he was replaced by Batista. Vader and Goldust interfered in the match on Coachman&#x27;s behalf and received spinebusters for their efforts.

On the June 11, 2012, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Vader defeated Heath Slater in a singles match. On July 23 on the 1000th episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Vader and several other legends prevented Slater from leaving in his match against Lita, which she won.

In April 2016, Vader made a one-night appearance at the 2016 WWE Hall of Fame ceremony to induct Stan Hansen into the WWE Hall of Fame. On March 7, 2022, it was announced that he would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame.

=== Independent circuit (2004–2007, 2010–2017) ===
Vader returned to Japan, wrestling at a NJPW Wrestle Land show. He also worked in the independent circuit as Big Van Vader, including a tag match with Mike Awesome against Samoa Joe and Dan Maff in Jersey All Pro Wrestling on June 5, 2004. On May 12, 2007, Vader faced Brutus Beefcake at Spartan Slamfest, a World Wrestling Coalition charity show. The match was held at the Kingston Armory in Kingston, Pennsylvania. After wrestling his last match in 2007, White began working as a high school football coach and retired from the sport.
On April 29, 2010, White made a return to wrestling under his Vader ring name at the event Vader Time 5 Return of the Emperor. At the event, he teamed with his son Jesse and former tag team partner 2 Cold Scorpio to successfully defeat Makoto Hashi, Tamon Honda and Tatsumi Fujinami in the main event.

Vader made his in-ring return to the United States on January 28, 2012. He defeated Arik Royal and Adam Page in a handicap match at WrestleReunion: Los Angeles. On May 11, 2012, at Resistance Pro&#x27;s event A Small Deadly Space, Vader defeated Jay Bradley.

In May 2016, Will Ospreay and Ricochet faced each other during the NJPW tournament Best of the Super Juniors. During the match, both wrestlers performed a high flying, fast-paced sequence. When Vader saw the sequence, he complained on social media about the current direction of pro wrestling, specifically about matches being too scripted and overly choreographed. During the following weeks, Vader and Ospreay feuded on Twitter, which led to England-based promotion Revolution Pro Wrestling (RevPro) booking a match between them. The match took place on August 12, 2016, with Vader defeating Ospreay. Two days later, Vader made an appearance in Colchester, England for the XWA Wrestling (XWA) promotion, defeating &quot;Savvy&quot; Sid Scala.

On April 20, 2017, Vader made an appearance in Japan at Korakuen Hall as part of the Dradition show to celebrate the 45th anniversary of the debut of Tatsumi Fujinami. Following a six-man tag team match, Vader collapsed due to being dropped on his head during the match, but he was able to walk backstage under his own power and he remained in Japan as he was scheduled to work two more shows in Fukuoka and Osaka. On April 22, Vader, Takuma Sano, and Yoshiaki Fujiwara lost a six-man tag team match to Koji Kanemoto, Shiro Koshinaka and Tatsumi Fujinami. On April 23, Vader, Riki Choshu, and Tatsumi Fujinami defeated Shiro Koshinaka, Takuma Sano, and Yoshiaki Fujiwara. The final match of his career took place August 26, 2017, for Top Rope Promotions with Vader coming out victorious.

===Return to AJPW (2011–2012)===
In the aftermath of the 2011 natural disasters in Japan, Vader and his son Jesse wrestled on special tribute cards for All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) and Pro Wrestling Zero1. On December 7, 2012, Vader returned to AJPW once again, teaming with Keiji Mutoh and Kenso to defeat Bambi Killer, Franz Dynamite and Mazada in a six-man tag team match.

==Professional wrestling style and persona==

White is considered one of the greatest super-heavyweight professional wrestlers of all time. He used his size and weight as part of his moves making them look much more painful than when performed by someone half his size. For example, his finishing move, called the Vader Bomb, which is a corner slingshot splash, when he would bounce off the middle rope and land on a prone opponent. He was also noted for his impressive agility, as he can perform a simple dropkick despite his frame. One of his signature moves was the &quot;Vader Sault&quot;, a moonsault or a backward somersault jump off the top rope, a move that requires significant agility and is usually performed by much smaller wrestlers.

===Video games===
The &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; character Raiden, also known as &quot;Big Bear&quot;, is based on Vader&#x27;s appearance in Japan. The character Alexander the Grater from &quot;Saturday Night Slam Masters&quot; bears a resemblance to Vader. Alexander also wears a mask very similar to the mastodon mask Vader wore during ring entrances in the 1980s and early 1990s. Vader himself appears as a playable character in the WCW video games &quot;WCW Wrestling&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;WCW SuperBrawl Wrestling&quot;, the WWE video game &quot;WWF In Your House&quot;, and as a downloadable or unlockable legend in &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009&quot;, &quot;WWE &#x27;12&quot;, &quot;WWE &#x27;13&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K16&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K17&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K18&quot;, and &quot;WWE 2K19&quot;. He has also been featured, both officially and unofficially, in numerous Japanese wrestling games, such as the &quot;Fire Pro Wrestling&quot; series, &quot;Virtual Pro Wrestling&quot;, &quot;King of Colosseum&quot; (he is a preset model in &quot;King of Colosseum II&quot;″s EDIT mode), the latter two editions of the &quot;All Star Pro-Wrestling&quot; series, and &quot;Wrestle Kingdom 2&quot;, where he is also featured in the cover art.

==Personal life==
White and his wife Grace Connelly, married in 1979. Together they have a son, Jesse White, who was born on April 19, 1986. In July 2009, Jesse began training to become a professional wrestler in Japan. He originally committed to the University of Oklahoma and was touted for the National Football League, but was taken out with a hip injury. In April 2011, he signed a developmental contract with WWE, and used the name Jake Carter, until September 16, 2013, when he was released.

White was a born again Christian.

While in Kuwait during a WWF tour in April 1997, White appeared on the television program &quot;Good Morning Kuwait&quot; along with Mark Calaway, who was WWF World Heavyweight Champion at that time. During the interview, the host asked both of them if wrestling was fake. In response, White flipped over the table they were sitting at and grabbed the host by the tie, asking him if it seemed fake while using foul language. He was then arrested and detained by Kuwaiti authorities for two weeks. In December, White was fined 50 Kuwaiti dinars (about $164) for this incident. In a later interview, it was revealed that this incident was in fact scripted, as it was pitched to both White and Earl Hebner by the producers of the show in an attempt to boost viewership numbers; however, the host was not apprised of the plan, which resulted in him filing for charges against White.

===Health problems and death===
Partially due to years of alcohol abuse and travel, White and his wife divorced in 2007, inspiring him to quit drinking and curtail his travel.
White had double knee replacement surgery, resulting in wound infection, and he was bedridden for six months. Soon after recovering, he passed out during a plane trip to Japan for an autograph session. He was in a coma for 33 days, during which he lost 112 pounds.

In November 2016, White was involved in a rollover car accident that left him unconscious for 35 minutes. Being diagnosed with congestive heart failure, he consulted two heart doctors, who told him he had two years to live. He later received another opinion that was more optimistic. In a March 2017 interview on the &quot;Two Man Power Trip of Wrestling&quot; podcast, White explained that he regretted tweeting about his diagnosis. He said he would continue to wrestle and if the tests were proven to be true, he would like to die in the ring.

In March 2018, White went in for heart surgery followed by another to treat an arrhythmia. White died on June 18, 2018, after a month-long hospitalization for pneumonia. He was 63 years old. In the months before his death, White was frequently visited and supported by fellow wrestler Sting.

<text>Trafalgar Day is the celebration of the victory won by the Royal Navy, commanded by Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson, over the combined French and Spanish fleets at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805.

==History==
The formation of the Navy League in 1894 gave added impetus to the movement to recognise Nelson&#x27;s legacy, and grand celebrations were held in Trafalgar Square in London on Trafalgar Day, 1896. It was commemorated by parades, dinners and other events throughout much of the British Empire in the 19th century and early 20th century. It continues to be celebrated by navies of the Commonwealth of Nations. Its public celebration declined after the end of World War I in 1918. The massive casualties and upheaval had changed the general public perception of war as a source of glorious victories to a more sombre view of it as a tragedy, for which the newly instituted Armistice Day on 11 November was created. However, Trafalgar Day was still marked as a public day each year. Around 1993, it was rumoured that John Major&#x27;s government might make it a public holiday in place of May Day, and this plan was revived in the 2011 Tourism Strategy created by the then coalition government.

The year 2005 was the bicentennial of the Battle of Trafalgar, and the Royal Navy led &quot;Trafalgar 200&quot; celebrations. The 2005 International Fleet Review held off Spithead in the Solent on 28 June was the first since 1999 and the largest since Her Majesty The Queen&#x27;s 1977 Silver Jubilee.

==Trafalgar Night==
On 21 October each year the commissioned officers of the Royal Navy celebrate the victory at the Battle of Trafalgar by holding a Trafalgar Night dinner in the Officer&#x27;s Mess.

At a Trafalgar Night banquet or dinner, a speech is usually made by a guest of honour who ends it with a toast to &quot;The Immortal Memory ...&quot; (The rest of the wording of the toast varies depending on what is said in the speech). On 21 October 2005 (the 200th anniversary), at such a dinner the traditional toast was given by Queen Elizabeth II:
Such dinners also occur each year on or around 21 October in locations other than Royal Navy ships.

The Royal Naval Museum in Portsmouth hold a &quot;Trafalgar Night Dinner&quot; each year on a date close to 21 October.

The British ambassador in Washington hosts such a dinner at which the guest of honour may be a senior officer in the United States Navy.

==British celebrations==

Sea Cadet Corps in the United Kingdom hold a youth cadet parade known as the National Trafalgar Day Parade on Trafalgar Square each year. The parade is formed with a platoon from each area, a guard and a massed band. This is held on the closest Sunday to 21 October. Units and Districts from around the country celebrate this day – usually with a town parade.

Birmingham celebrates the anniversary with a ceremony at the statue of Lord Nelson – the oldest such statue in the United Kingdom – in the Bull Ring. The ceremony is led by the Lord Mayor of Birmingham and involves men and women of , Sea Cadet units from across the West Midlands and various civic organisations, including The Nelson Society and The Birmingham Civic Society. Afterwards representatives of naval and civic organisations lay wreaths and a parade marches off to Victoria Square, the public square in front of the seat of local government, where the Lord Mayor takes the salute.

Another aspect of the Birmingham celebration is that the statue is regaled with swags of laurel and flowers, possibly due to its location by the wholesale flower markets of the city. This tradition, marked through most of the nineteenth century, was revived in 2004.

In Edinburgh, citizens commissioned the Nelson Monument on Calton Hill in memory of Admiral Lord Nelson. Weather permitting, the Trafalgar flag signal &quot;England expects that every man will do his duty&quot; is flown on Trafalgar Day. Looking like a tall stone telescope, the Nelson Monument contains a time ball which drops at 1 o&#x27;clock daily.

The village of Dervock in County Antrim (Northern Ireland) has the only known memorial which takes the form of a stained-glass window depicting Admiral Lord Nelson minutes before he was killed on board in 1805. It is believed that this is the only memorial on the island, Nelson&#x27;s pillar in Dublin (the earliest memorial to Admiral Nelson) having been destroyed in 1966, and in 2015 residents organised their first ever &quot;Trafalgar Day&quot;.

In Gibraltar, the Trafalgar Day service takes place at the Trafalgar Cemetery, where the senior Naval Commander reads an extract from the &quot;Gibraltar Chronicle&quot; newspaper, the first periodical to report on the battle. Some sailors died in Gibraltar of wounds received at Trafalgar; they are buried in Gibraltar. HMS &quot;Victory&quot;, with Nelson&#x27;s body on board, underwent repairs in Gibraltar prior to sailing for Britain.

In the Isle of Man, John Quilliam, 1st Lieutenant of HMS &quot;Victory&quot; in 1805, is buried in the graveyard of Kirk Arbory, Ballabeg. An annual parade and church service takes place on Trafalgar Day.

==International celebrations==

The victory is celebrated in Nelson, New Zealand (named after Horatio Nelson), usually in Trafalgar Square and sometimes involves pupils from the local Victory Primary School. Many streets in Nelson are named after Trafalgar and crew members of Victory.

The victory is celebrated each year in the Australian town of Trafalgar, Victoria, in which the small town of 2,200 holds an annual Battle of Trafalgar Festival with the Trafalgar Day Ball held on the Friday or Saturday closest to 21 October each year.

<doc id="1027412" wikidata="Q7719794" url="?curid=1027412" title="The Brady Kids">
<text>The Brady Kids is an American animated television series and a spin-off based on the ABC live-action sitcom &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, produced by Filmation in association with Paramount Television. It aired on ABC from September 9, 1972, to October 6, 1973, and also spun off another Filmation series, &quot;&quot;, starring Rick Springfield.

==Background==
In 1972, with the live action sitcom &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; preparing for the start of its fourth season, show creator and executive producer Sherwood Schwartz approached Filmation about the creation of an animated series featuring the Brady Kids. Filmation agreed, and Lou Schiemer and Norm Prescott (who would later develop Schwartz properties &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Planet&quot; and &quot;The New Adventures of Gilligan&quot;) headed up the project.

==Characters==
The original show&#x27;s six children (Barry Williams, Maureen McCormick, Christopher Knight, Eve Plumb, Mike Lookinland and Susan Olsen) voiced their animated counterparts in the first season. As the series&#x27; title implies, the parents and Alice the housekeeper characters were omitted from the show. At the end of the first season, Filmation asked the kids to continue on their existing contracts for another five episodes in a second season. The kids&#x27; original answer was no, prodded on by their agent Harvey Shotz. Filmation threatened both to sue the children over breach of contract, and to continue the show without their voices. Knight, Lookinland, Plumb, and Olsen agreed to the extended Filmation contract, but Williams and McCormick did not agree. Williams and McCormick were replaced with Lane Scheimer and Erika Scheimer, the son and daughter of Filmation producer Lou Scheimer.

===The Bradys===
* Greg Brady: Barry Williams (season 1), Lane Scheimer (season 2)
* Marcia Brady: Maureen McCormick (season 1), Erika Scheimer (season 2)
* Peter Brady: Christopher Knight (credited as &quot;David E. Smith&quot; in season 2)
* Jan Brady: Eve Plumb
* Bobby Brady: Mike Lookinland
* Cindy Brady: Susan Olsen

===Other characters===
* Marlon: Larry Storch
* Ping and Pong: Larry Storch
* Mop Top: Larry Storch
* Chuck White: Larry Storch
* Fleetwood: Larry Storch
* Babs: Jane Webb

===Crossover with DC comics===
* Superman: Lennie Weinrib
* Lois Lane: Jane Webb
* Wonder Woman: Jane Webb

==Production==
While Schwartz originally intended to hand off full editorial control to Schiemer and Prescott, he eventually returned to become an active part of production, reviewing scripts and advising on creative input.

Much of the animation for the series was copied over from another Filmation series, &quot;The Archie Show&quot;. Walk cycles, profile pictures, and scenes where the Brady kids play in a band were all frame-by-frame replacements for looped frames originally seen of The Archies on &quot;The Archie Show&quot;. Many of Mop Top&#x27;s poses were copied from the Archies&#x27; character Hot Dog. Mop Top copied Hot Dog&#x27;s design (from Archie) with the only difference being a pallette change. Fleetwood&#x27;s poses and walk cycles were often copied from Rudy of &quot;Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids&quot;.

Originally aired as a one-hour segment on &quot;The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie&quot;, the pilot episode was split into two half-hour segments on &quot;The Brady Kids&quot;. A total of 22 episodes were produced. Season 1 aired Saturday mornings from 10:30 to 11:00 AM, and season 2 aired Saturday mornings from 11:00 to 11:30 AM. Season 1 contained 17 episodes, and season 2 contained 5. Season 2 was specifically created by Filmation with the intent on 5 episodes to bring the total count of episodes to 22, the minimum required for syndication. Like most 1970s-era Saturday morning cartoon series as well as &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; show itself, &quot;The Brady Kids&quot; contained an adult laugh track.

The opening sequence in the first season featured the fourth season &quot;grid&quot; familiar to &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; viewers, without the center column that is normally occupied by the adults (Mike, Carol and Alice). Near the end of the theme song (featuring new lyrics set to the original &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; theme complete with a 1970&#x27;s style piano), Marlon flies up and down the center, &quot;magically&quot; transforming the live-action children into their animated counterparts. The second seasons&#x27;s intro features Marlon flying up and down the center of an empty blue background to reveal the Brady Kids.

Schwartz would admit that he was not happy with the series in an interview with &quot;RetroCrush&quot; many years later, stating, &quot;My conversation was to give a new platform that was more imaginative than real life situations, but I didn&#x27;t find it particularly good, so we stopped it after a year.&quot;

==Episodes==

<doc id="1027418" wikidata="Q5729655" url="?curid=1027418" title="Henry W. Grady">
<text>Henry Woodfin Grady (May 24, 1850 – December 23, 1889) was an American journalist and orator who helped reintegrate the states of the Confederacy into the Union after the American Civil War. Grady encouraged the industrialization of the postbellum South, which Grady referred to as &quot;The New South.&quot; He was praised by contemporaries and by authors Shavin and Galphin as a civic promoter, political strategist, and captivating speaker, and by Atlanta journalist Frederick Allen as a visionary. However, in modern times, Grady&#x27;s arguments for the need for white supremacy in the post–Civil War South have resulted in his legacy being seen as mixed and overtly racist. Grady&#x27;s name has been removed from several schools including Atlanta&#x27;s former Grady High School. Grady was the father-in-law of Federal Reserve Chairman Eugene Robert Black and grandfather of banker and World Bank President Eugene R. Black Sr.

==Early life==
As a teenager, Henry Grady experienced fierce Civil War fighting in his home state of Georgia. His father William Sammons Grady was a Confederate States Army officer who died of wounds received at the Battle of the Crater. After his father&#x27;s death, he was raised by his mother Anne in Athens, Georgia. He was educated in the classical tradition of a southern gentleman of the time at the University of Georgia (Bachelor of Arts in 1868). In 1867, he became a member of the Phi Kappa Literary Society, and later attended the University of Virginia to study law, but became especially interested in the Greek and Anglo-Saxon languages, history, and literature, which led to a career in journalism.

Grady was a charter member of the Eta chapter of Chi Phi at the University of Georgia. In 1882 he was elected as the first Grand Alpha (National President) from the south after the union of the Northern and Southern Orders of Chi Phi in 1871.

==Journalist and editor==
Upon graduation, he held a series of brief journalistic jobs with the &quot;Rome Courier&quot;, the &quot;Atlanta Herald&quot;, and the &quot;New York Herald&quot;. After working in New York City, Grady returned to the South as a reporter-editor for the &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot;.

In 1880, with $20,000 borrowed from Cyrus West Field, Grady bought a one-fourth interest in the paper and began a nine-year career as one of Georgia&#x27;s most celebrated journalist-publishers. On the business end, he quickly built the newspaper into the state&#x27;s most influential, with a national circulation of 120,000.

In the tumultuous decades following Reconstruction, when hatreds lingered and many whites worked to re-establish white supremacy, Grady popularized an antithesis between the &quot;old South&quot; which &quot;rested everything on slavery and agriculture, unconscious that these could neither give nor maintain healthy growth,&quot; and a &quot;new south&quot; – &quot;thrilling with the consciousness of growing power and prosperity:&quot;

The new South presents a perfect democracy...; a social system compact and closely knitted, less splendid on the surface, but stronger at the core; a hundred farms for every plantation, fifty homes for every palace; and a diversified industry that meets the complex needs of this complex age

as he said in an 1886 speech in New York. His audience included J. P. Morgan and H. M. Flagler at Delmonico&#x27;s Restaurant, at a meeting of the New England Society of New York.

From 1882 to 1886, along with Nathaniel E. Harris, Grady promoted the founding in Atlanta of the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), a state vocational education school intended to train workers for new industries.

==Orator and spokesman for the &quot;New South&quot;== 

Grady was also praised for his great passion for political oratory (he supported Prohibition and a Georgia veterans&#x27; home for disabled or elderly Confederate soldiers), commitment to the new peace, and well-known sense of humor. To a large crowd in Boston, Grady said &quot;I am a talker by inheritance: my father was an Irishman and my mother was a woman.&quot;

That sense of humor got Grady through more than one difficult situation. Once at a banquet of northern elites, he was waxing eloquent about the brilliant prospects for northern investments in a New South determined to rise from the ashes of defeat. Grady spotted General William T. Sherman in the audience, the celebrated Yankee soldier who was credited with defeating and burning much of Georgia, and particularly Atlanta, on his infamous march to the sea. Without missing a beat, Grady acknowledged the general by noting that the people of Georgia thought Sherman an able military man, &quot;but a mite careless about fire.&quot;

In another speech, Grady wanted to gently chastise his Southern audience for what he believed to be Georgia&#x27;s economic shortcomings. Rather than pounding them with statistics, he entertained them with stories that made the points. He said:

I attended a funeral once in Pickens county in my State. This funeral was peculiarly sad. It was a poor &quot;one gallus&quot; fellow, whose breeches struck him under the armpits and hit him at the other end about the knee—he didn&#x27;t believe in decollete clothes. They buried him in the midst of a marble quarry: they cut through solid marble to make his grave, yet a little tombstone they put above him was from Vermont. They buried him in the heart of a pine forest, and yet the pine coffin was imported from Cincinnati. They buried him within touch of an iron mine, and yet the nails in his coffin and the iron in the shovel that dug his grave were imported from Pittsburg. They buried him by the side of the best sheep-grazing country on the earth, and yet the wool in the coffin bands and the coffin bands themselves were brought from the North. The South didn&#x27;t furnish a thing on earth for that funeral but the corpse and the hole in the ground. There they put him away and the clods rattled down on his coffin, and they buried him in a New York coat and a Boston pair of shoes and a pair of breeches from Chicago and a shirt from Cincinnati, leaving him nothing to carry into the next world with him to remind him of the country in which he lived, and for which he fought for four years, but the chill of blood in his veins and the marrow in his bones. The &quot;Georgia Historical Quarterly&quot; brought that story full circle, noting Grady&#x27;s response to the eventual growth of quarries in Pickens County. He boasted that the grave he had so often referenced in his speeches lay less than 100 yards from one of the quarries. Grady believed, according to the &quot;Quarterly&quot;, that he had lived long enough to see his vision of an industrially independent New South come true. 
Grady&#x27;s prestige reached such a height that he became the only non-member ever to adjourn the Georgia Legislature. It occurred on the election of Grover Cleveland to the presidency. News of the close contest arrived at 11 a.m. during the Legislature&#x27;s session. In his exuberance, Grady rushed to the Capitol with the announcement. He brushed past the doorkeeper and into the chamber shouting in senatorial tones, &quot;Mr. Speaker, a message from the American people.&quot; Sensing the purpose of the intrusion, the Speaker offered Grady a place by his side. However, Grady strode up the aisle to the Speaker&#x27;s desk, grabbed the Speaker&#x27;s gavel, and cried out, &quot;In the name of the American people, I declare this House adjourned in honor of the election of the first Democratic President in twenty-five years.&quot;

==White supremacy==
Grady&#x27;s conception of the New South was based on the social supremacy of whites over blacks, according to his own words: Grady stated in 1888, &quot;the supremacy of the white race of the South must be maintained forever, and the domination of the negro race resisted at all points and at all hazards, because the white race is the superior race... [This declaration] shall run forever with the blood that feeds Anglo-Saxon hearts&quot;. This was not the first time that Grady had advocated for the supremacy of whites over blacks. In his 1887 speech to the State Fair of Texas in Dallas, Grady stated: Standing in the presence of this multitude, sobered with the responsibility of the message I deliver to the young men of the South, I declare that the truth above all others to be worn unsullied and sacred in your hearts, to be surrendered to no force, sold for no price, compromised in no necessity, but cherished and defended as the covenant of your prosperity, and the pledge of peace to your children, is that the white race must dominate forever in the South, because it is the white race, and superior to that race by which its supremacy is threatened. 

Some argue other Henry Grady quotes paint a different picture. In December 1886, he opened his famous New South speech by repeating the words of Georgia Senator Benjamin H. Hill: &quot;There was a South of slavery and secession -- that South is dead. There is a South of Union and freedom -- that South, thank God, is living, breathing, growing every hour.&quot;

Under Grady&#x27;s editorial guidance, the &quot;Constitution&quot; wrote about lynching with levity, condoning and even encouraging it. One headline read, &quot;The Triple Trapeze: Three Negroes Hung to a Limb of a Tree.&quot; Another rhymed, &quot;Two Minutes to Pray Before a Rope Dislocated Their Vertebrae.&quot; University of Massachusetts Amherst

Journalism Professor Kathy Roberts Forde, sees it this way: &quot;Grady may have united Southern and Northern whites, but he did not unite the country. Rather, he excluded black Americans from the union of North and South and the national democratic project that union represented.&quot;

==Death==
On December 12, 1889, Grady delivered a speech in Boston at Faneuil Hall titled &quot;The Race Problem in the South&quot;. Grady was already ill, and the weather was terrible. His health worsened to the point that he barely made it back to Georgia. By the time he made it to the depot at Atlanta, he was too exhausted to appreciate the reception prepared for him and had to be shielded from the crowd and escorted home by his physician.

By December 23, he was diagnosed with pneumonia and died that day at his home in Atlanta. He was buried on Christmas Day 1889, first in a friend&#x27;s crypt at Oakland Cemetery because of family finances. His body was re-interred at Westview Cemetery when it opened soon afterward.

==Legacy and honors==
Grady County in Georgia and Oklahoma were named in his honor, as was Grady, Alabama. Places in Atlanta named for him include Grady Memorial Hospital, the now-demolished Henry Grady Hotel, and the Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Georgia. Henry W. Grady High School was renamed in December 2020 to Midtown High School, due to Grady&#x27;s white supremacist philosophy. 

The city erected a statue in his honor in 1891. During the 1906 Atlanta race riot, mob members laid the bodies of three of their African-American victims at the base of the statue. the statue still stands on Marietta Street in the heart of downtown Atlanta. Other places include Henry Woodfin Grady Elementary School in Tampa, Florida. Henry W. Grady Middle School in Houston, Texas, was renamed in 2016.

In 1931 Grady was the first person inducted into the Georgia Newspaper Hall of Fame, memorialized via a bust by artist Steffen Thomas. During World War II the Liberty ship was built in Brunswick, Georgia and named in his honor.

Grady&#x27;s family grave site in Atlanta was desecrated in June 2020.

<doc id="1027420" wikidata="Q849861" url="?curid=1027420" title="Donnington Castle">
<text>Donnington Castle is a ruined medieval castle, situated in the small village of Donnington, just north of the town of Newbury in the English county of Berkshire. It was founded by Sir Richard Abberbury the Elder in 1386 and was bought by Thomas Chaucer before the castle was taken under royal control during the Tudor period. During the First English Civil War the castle was held by the royalist Sir John Boys and withstood an 18-month siege; after the garrison eventually surrendered, Parliament voted to demolish Donnington Castle in 1646. Only the gatehouse survives. The site is a scheduled monument under the care of English Heritage.

==History==

The manor of Donnington had been owned by the Abberbury family since 1292, 
Donnington Castle was built by its original owner, Sir Richard Abberbury the Elder, under a licence granted by Richard II in 1386. The surviving castle gatehouse dates from this time. In 1398, the castle was sold to Thomas Chaucer, son of the poet Geoffrey Chaucer, as a residence for his daughter Alice, who later became Duchess of Suffolk.
The Duke of Suffolk William De La Pole made Donnington his occasional residence, and considerably enlarged the buildings.

This family later fell out with the Tudor monarchs, and the castle became a royal property. In 1514 it was given to Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk. Though Brandon appears to have stayed at the Donnington Castle in 1516, by the time the castle and manor returned to the Crown in 1535 the structure was in a state of decay. King Henry VIII, Edward VI, and Queen Elizabeth I visited Donnington Castle, in 1539, 1552, and 1568 respectively.

In 1590 Elizabeth I granted keepership to Elizabeth Cooke (Lady Russell), the first woman to hold such a title in England.
In 1600, Elizabeth I gave the castle and surrounding manor to Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham. Howard took possession in September 1603 and Russell disputed his rights. By the time the English Civil War broke out in 1643, the castle was owned by the Parliamentarian John Packer family but after the First Battle of Newbury it was taken for the King, Charles I, and held by Sir John Boys. They quickly enhanced the castle&#x27;s defences by adding earthworks in a star shape to provide gun emplacements. Parliamentarians laid siege to the castle in October 1644 and the garrison held out for 18 months. With permission from the king, Boys surrendered the castle in April 1646 and was allowed to leave with all his men.

In 1646 Parliament voted to demolish the castle; only the gatehouse was left standing though the 17th-century earthworks can still be seen. The castle is now in the care of English Heritage and is a scheduled ancient monument number 1007926.

The castle stayed in the Packer family until the mid 18th century, when Robert Packer married Mary Winchcombe, and the property passed into the Winchcombe family tree. From 1833 to 1881 the manor and castle was owned by Winchcombe Henry Howard Hartley,

==Layout==

Donnington Castle was originally built in a roughly rectangular form, though the west facade projected outwards irregularly. It was enclosed by a curtain wall, with a round tower at each of the four corners. Roughly halfway along the two walls running from west to east were two square towers. The courtyard enclosed by the curtain walls would probably have contained a hall, kitchens, and accommodation for guests. Measured from the inner sides of the curtain walls, the courtyard measured north to south and east to west.

During the Civil War star-shaped defences were built around the castle to facilitate gun emplacements. Only the gatehouse, crested by battlements, survived the castle&#x27;s destruction in 1646; standing three storeys high, it measures internally. Modern walls standing high outline the original layout of the demolished castle. The star-shaped earthworks added during the Civil War are still visible, surviving to a height of .

==Castle Occupants==
Donnington Castle&#x27;s close association with the English monarchy dates back to its construction under a license granted by Richard II to the Adderbury family. Although the castle changed hands several times, it eventually became the property of the royal family, and consequently, many notable figures closely linked to the English monarchy visited Donnington.

Among the most prominent residents of Donnington were Sir Richard Abberbury the Elder, the original owner of the castle and Chamberlain to Anne of Bohemia; Alice Chaucer, Duchess of Suffolk; William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk; Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk and 1st Viscount Lisle; King Henry VIII; King Edward VI; Queen Elizabeth I; Elizabeth Cooke, Lady Russell; Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham; John Packer, Parliamentarian, and secretary to George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham; Sir John Boys, the Royalist Governor of Donnington Castle; and Robert Packer, a politician and Member of Parliament. 

==In Popular Culture==
Donnington Castle appears in an episode of &quot;The Saint&quot; called &#x27;Little Girl Lost&#x27;, first broadcast on 2 December 1966.

The castle appeared in the Children&#x27;s Film Foundation feature &quot;A Hitch in Time&quot; (1978), starring Patrick Troughton.

The twin-towered gatehouse is depicted on the cover of the compilation album &quot;The Best of &quot;Tenpole Tudor&quot; : Swords of a Thousand Men&quot; (2001).

<doc id="1027422" wikidata="Q772726" url="?curid=1027422" title="2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup">
<text>The 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup was the fifth edition of the Gold Cup, the soccer championship of North America, Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF), and the 15th overall CONCACAF tournament. It was held in Los Angeles, Miami, and San Diego in the United States. The format of the tournament changed from 1998; it was expanded to twelve teams, split into four groups of three. The top two teams in each group would advance to the quarter-finals. Peru and Colombia were invited from CONMEBOL, and the Republic of Korea was invited from AFC.

With all three games in Group D ending in ties and Canada tied with the Republic of Korea on every tiebreaker, a coin toss was used. Canada won and advanced to the quarter-finals. They went on to win their first and to date only Gold Cup title. In the quarter-finals, Canada upset defending champions Mexico in golden goal extra time 2–1. They defeated Trinidad and Tobago in the semi-finals 1–0 after Craig Forrest saved a first-half penalty. Already assured as CONCACAF champions, Canada topped invitees Colombia 2–0 in the final.

The tournament marks the only time a CONCACAF Gold Cup has been won by a country other than the United States or Mexico, and the only time in the tournament&#x27;s history that neither the United States nor Mexico made to the semifinal.

<doc id="1027431" wikidata="Q327195" url="?curid=1027431" title="Edgar de Wahl">
<text>Edgar von Wahl (Interlingue: , born Edgar Alexis Robert von Wahl, 23 August 1867 – 9 March 1948) was a Baltic German mathematics and physics teacher who lived in Tallinn, Estonia. He also used the pseudonym Julian Prorók, and is best known as the creator of Interlingue, an international auxiliary language that was known as Occidental throughout his life.

He was born to the Baltic German noble von Wahl family in the then Russian Empire and spent most of his childhood in Tallinn (Reval) and the capital Saint Petersburg. He studied at the University of Saint Petersburg and at the Saint Petersburg Academy of Arts. During and after his studies he served in the navy. After completing the military service in 1894 he lived permanently in Tallinn and worked as a teacher. During World War II, when most Baltic Germans left Estonia in 1939–1941, he decided to stay. He was arrested in 1943 by the Nazi German occupation authorities and placed in a psychiatric clinic because of alleged dementia. He stayed there until his death in 1948.

Wahl was engaged with interlinguistics from an early age. He was first introduced to Volapük by his father&#x27;s colleague Waldemar Rosenberger and even started to compose a lexicon of marine terminology for the language, before turning to Esperanto in 1888. After the failure of Reformed Esperanto in 1894, of which Wahl had been a proponent, he started work to find an ideal form of an international language. In 1922, he published a &quot;key&quot; to a new language, &quot;Occidental&quot;, and the first edition of the periodical &quot;Kosmoglott&quot; (later &quot;Cosmoglotta&quot;). Wahl developed the language over several decades on the advice of its speakers, but became isolated from the movement (then centred in Switzerland) from 1939 after the start of World War II.

== Biography ==

=== Ancestry ===
Edgar von Wahl was a member of the Päinurme line of the Wahl noble family. Edgar von Wahl&#x27;s great-grandfather was Carl Gustav von Wahl, who acquired the Pajusi, Tapiku and Kavastu manors and was also the owner of Kaave Manor for a short time. Carl Gustav von Wahl had a total of 14 children from two marriages, from whom various Wahl lines descended. Of them, Edgar von Wahl&#x27;s grandfather Alexei von Wahl, a civil servant who bought Päinurme manor in 1837, laid the foundation for the Päinurme line. In addition, he was a tenant at Taevere Manor, where Edgar&#x27;s father Oskar von Wahl was born.

=== Childhood and youth ===
Edgar Alexis Robert von Wahl was born on 23 August 1867 to Oskar von Wahl and Lydia Amalie Marie (married 1866 in Tallinn), in what is now Pervomaisk, Mykolaiv Oblast, in Ukraine (then in the Kherson Governorate, Russian Empire). The Wahl family had moved to Ukraine after his father, a railway engineer, started work on the Odesa–Balta–Kremenchuk–Kharkov railway in 1866. By 1869, the Wahl family had moved to Kremenchuk, where Wahl&#x27;s brother Arthur Johann Oskar was born in 1870. After that, the family moved to Tallinn, where Wahl&#x27;s two sisters were born – Lydia Jenny Cornelia in 1871 and Harriet Marie Jenny in 1873. The family later moved to Saint Petersburg where the third sister Jenny Theophile was born in 1877.

Wahl grew up in Saint Petersburg. He began studying at the Gymnasium in Saint Petersburg, graduating in 1886. He then studied at the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics at the University of Saint Petersburg and architecture and painting at the Saint Petersburg Academy of Arts. While at university, Wahl joined the Baltic German operating in St. Petersburg, where he served as treasurer in the autumn term of 1891. He graduated in 1891 and in 1893 received a diploma as a teacher of drawing at the Elementary School of the Academy of Arts. He worked briefly as a substitute teacher in Saint Petersburg in the autumn of 1891, before entering the navy.

During his boyhood, Wahl learnt several languages; he became fluent in German, Russian, Estonian and French. In upper secondary school he studied Latin and ancient Greek, and Spanish at university. In addition to these, throughout his life he was able to make himself understood in nine other languages. He had an interest in creating languages from a young age:

Even in my youth, I had the idea of constructing a language. Full of stories from Cooper, Gustave Aimard etc, I played American Indians with my friends, and conceived the idea of a special quasi-Indian jargon for our games. It was made of Indian words taken from stories, and completed with other necessary words taken from diverse other languages. It had a grammar composed of mixed Ancient Greek and Estonian. This language was never used because my friends refused to learn it.

=== Military service ===
In 1892, Wahl volunteered to serve in the Russian Navy. During his service, he travelled extensively, visiting the Caribbean islands and the United States among other places. In early 1894, he received the rank of (Russian: ) and retired shortly thereafter. In the summer of 1904, Wahl was again called to active service. He served in the Baltic Fleet until October 1905, although he did not participate in the battles of the Russo-Japanese War.

According to the memoirs of Estonian artist , who knew Wahl as a youth, Wahl had been very proud of his Tsarist-era officer&#x27;s uniform and he sometimes wore it even decades later:

It is, however, unlikely that Wahl participated in the suppression of the Sveaborg rebellion, having already been released from service by then. He may have been called to active service during World War I.

During his service in the navy, Wahl was awarded the 2nd and 3rd rank of the Order of Saint Stanislav and the 3rd rank of the Order of Saint Anne. After acquiring Estonian citizenship at the end of 1920 Wahl was from 1921 also registered as a reserve officer of the Republic of Estonia.

=== Tallinn 1894–1917 ===
In 1894, Wahl moved to Tallinn, where he spent most of the rest of his life. That autumn, he started working as a teacher of mathematics and physics at St. Peter&#x27;s High School of Science (now the Tallinn Secondary School of Science). Later he taught drawing at run by Baronness Elisabeth von der Howen, the , and the Tallinn Cathedral School. His teaching was interrupted only by his military service.

Wahl&#x27;s teaching style was described in the memoirs of the later Estonian Minister of Education Aleksander Veiderma, who himself studied at St Peter&#x27;s High School of Science from 1906 to 1909:

Mathematics and physics were also taught by Edgar von Wahl, a former naval officer who always had some catchy remarks about an event or person. He was very messy in conducting physics experiments: utensils or glass often broke. His attitude towards students was simple, which is also confirmed by the nickname Sass.

:— Memoirs of Aleksander Veiderma

At the turn of the century, Wahl began to publish articles on linguistics in specialized publications, as well as writing in various Tallinn newspapers and magazines. Since 1898, Wahl had been a member of the &quot;Estonian Literature Society&quot; (German: &quot;Ehstländische Literärische Gesellschaft&quot;), a German-language association that regularly organised presentations by and for its members. Under the pseudonym Julian Prorók, he published a booklet &quot;Ketzereien: Keimzellen einer Philosophie&quot; (&quot;Heresies: Gametes of a Philosophy&quot;) in 1906 about his vision of global developments.

Wahl also entered politics before the outbreak of World War I. In 1913, he was elected to the Tallinn city council, and became a member of the council committee for the protection of monuments of ancient buildings. Despite his teaching position, Wahl did not address education issues on the city council. He was an active attendee at council meetings, but spoke little.

After the start of World War I, the Germans living in the Russian Empire were subjected to repression, from which Wahl did not completely escape; the , of which Wahl had been a member, was closed. In autumn 1914, he found himself at the centre of a propaganda campaign to change German place names. As a city councillor, he participated in discussions on the renaming of the city of Tallinn, following Mayor Jaan Poska&#x27;s proposal replace its name with the Old Russian-language &quot;Kolyvan&quot; (in the discussion of the matter, the incorrect name &quot;Kalyvan&quot; was used). Wahl discovered that the oldest names of the city were &quot;Ledenets&quot; or &quot;Lindanisa&quot;. He was interested in how much it would cost to change the name, which was said to have been met with &quot;general laughter&quot; at the council. The votes required to change the name were eventually reached by the council, but the change itself did not take place.

Wahl was elected to the city council held just before the February Revolution in 1917. On the new council, he became a member of the city&#x27;s fire department, public education, and pawnshop affairs committees, and continued as a member of the committee for the protection of monuments of ancient buildings. However, in August 1917, a new council was elected, and Wahl&#x27;s political activities ceased.

=== Life in independent Estonia ===
In February 1918, at the time of the Estonian Declaration of Independence, Wahl expressed a desire to join the voluntary militia Omakaitse. As a student who wrote weapon permits for volunteers: &quot;Among those who wanted to bear weapons, I only remember one: my physics teacher, von Wahl. I think I remember it because of the mood that might have arisen in the soul of a young student when his teacher asks him for a weapon.&quot;

In 1919, the Secondary School of Science was divided by language: the Tallinn High School of Science taught in Estonian and the Tallinn German High School of Science taught in German. Wahl continued as a professor at the latter, where he taught classes in mathematics, physics, geography, cosmography, and drawing. He had a house on Eha Street, not far from the school, where students often went for follow-up work. He had designed this house in a marine style and it was therefore nicknamed the &quot;cabin&quot; by his students. Among his students, Wahl was a popular teacher who was particularly dedicated to teaching geography since he had travelled extensively. The students were impressed by the fact that Wahl was a member of the English Club, which operated at the school.

Wahl sometimes clashed with his colleagues, openly expressing his distaste for modern art, for instance comparing it to communism when invited to an art exhibition by the school&#x27;s art teacher. He retired in the mid-1920s, but continued to teach part-time until 1933. He then took up his hobbies, especially constructed languages, which had become a passion since the days of Saint Petersburg. Additionally, he was editor of the magazine &quot;&quot; from 1929 to 1930.

=== During World War II ===
Unlike his relatives, Wahl did not leave to be in 1939, deciding to stay in Estonia. He represented the idealistic pan-European idea and did not like the National Socialist government of Germany, calling it a &quot;termite state&quot;. Wahl may also have chosen to stay to avoid abandoning his large archive. The danger of ending up in a retirement home in Germany might also have played a role: this had happened to several of his acquaintances. Wahl again avoided the to Germany that took place in the winter and early spring of 1941. He was certainly aware of the opportunity to leave, for when asked about his plans by one of his former students, he replied, leaving no doubt that his decision was stay in Estonia:

In the first year of Soviet rule in Estonia (1940-1941) Wahl managed to escape any repressions, although some of his relatives were arrested. After the beginning of the German occupation of Estonia, he was suspected of anti-state activities. Wahl was arrested on 12 August 1943, because of letters sent to Posen, to his wife&#x27;s sister-in-law, that were caught by the censors in Königsberg in July of that year. In these letters, he had predicted the outbreak of an uprising in Poland and advised the family who lived there to go to Germany:

In the same letter, Wahl noted that he had previously predicted the attack on Pearl Harbor and the subsequent outbreak of war between the United States and Japan. During the interrogation Wahl did not deny what he had written, and repeated several of the accusations he had made, &quot;firmly believing&quot; in the veracity of his predictions. He was held for some time in the Tallinn &quot;labour and education camp&quot;, but the testimony given during his interrogation was considered strange by the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot;, and so Wahl was sent to be examined at the . There he was diagnosed with dementia caused by ageing and left in the Seewald hospital, which also saved him from a possible death penalty. Wahl was defended by several close relatives and friends who claimed that he was not responsible for his actions.

During the bombing raid in March 1944, Wahl&#x27;s house, including his archive collection, was destroyed, which came as a great shock to him. Three years later, in a letter to the Finnish Occidentalist Armas Ramstedt, he recalled that what had happened was a real disaster, during which many irreplaceable and unique materials were lost.

=== Last years and death ===
In August 1945, of the Germans still living in Estonia by the Soviet NKVD took place. The list of people to be deported included Wahl&#x27;s name. At the time of the deportation, however, he was among a dozen people who were not deported or whose whereabouts could not be determined. Although the reasons for Wahl&#x27;s escape are not known, in some cases the head of the task force that carried out the deportation made the decision not to take the seriously ill or disabled, so the decision may have been influenced by the opinion of the hospital staff. Therefore, it was his presence in a mental hospital that saved Wahl for a second time.

During and after the world war, his foreign colleagues had very little information about Wahl&#x27;s condition and whereabouts; only in the spring of 1946 was Armas Ramstedt able to restore contact with him. It is unclear why the hospital staff at Seewald enabled such correspondence; perhaps that they may have recognized his dedication to linguistics when being supportive to his communication with the outside world.

Wahl died on 9 March 1948. He was buried on 14 March 1948 at the Siselinna Cemetery in Tallinn. In 1996, his remains were moved to the Pajusi manor cemetery, the family cemetery of the family.

=== Background ===
Wahl&#x27;s efforts to create a new and ideal language for international communication began with a general interest in artificial languages in the Russian Empire in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He first became interested in the recently-created Volapük in 1887 being introduced to the language by his father&#x27;s colleague, Waldemar Rosenberger, in Saint Petersburg. He became an active advocate of Volapük, receiving the title &quot;Teacher of Volapük&quot; and started to compile a maritime lexicon in Volapük (although this project was never completed). In early 1888, he was introduced to Esperanto and switched to it.

Estonian linguist Paul Ariste has written that Wahl quickly became an advocate of Esperanto&#x27;s creator, ophthalmologist L. L. Zamenhof, and his work after becoming acquainted with Unua Libro, the first Esperanto textbook (published in 1887). He soon influenced the early grammar of Esperanto and its vocabulary. Wahl was also one of the founders of &quot;Espero&quot;, Russia&#x27;s first Esperanto society founded in Saint Petersburg in 1891, and became a correspondent for the magazine &quot;La Esperantisto&quot;. He translated Russian fiction into Esperanto and compiled an Esperanto-Spanish dictionary.

However, Wahl did not align himself definitively to Esperanto, beginning the search for a new artificial language:

According to Estonian Esperantist , Wahl moved away from Esperanto after proposals to reform the language (of which Wahl was heavily in favour, having proposed some himself) were rejected by most Esperantists in 1894. In Ojalo&#x27;s view, he also considered Esperanto to be an &quot;a priori&quot; language (original, unlike more naturalistic languages, such as Euroclones). He concluded that the ideal international language should be more naturalistic and understandable even to those who had not learnt it. Wahl also considered Esperanto too democratic, which threatened Western culture.

=== Creation and introduction ===
Wahl took the first steps to create a new language in the last years of the 19th century. In 1896 and 1897 he published two articles in the Hanover-based magazine &quot;Linguist&quot;, in which he presented his ideas. Around the same time, Waldemar Rosenberger, who was at the time president of the Volapük Academy, introduced academy members to a new language of his own creation, Idiom Neutral. From 1906 onwards, Rosenberger also published the magazine &quot;Progress&quot;, wherein Wahl made his own proposals for reforms to the language, which Rosenberger adopted a year later in 1907. Despite the reform, the Idiom Neutral did not gain popularity. Concurrently, he developed a new international auxiliary language, based on the Romance languages, called &quot;Auli&quot;, an acronym for &quot;Auxiliari Lingue International&quot; in that language (English: &quot;&quot;), which would later become the intermediate stage of Occidental. Wahl introduced &quot;Auli&quot; in 1909 in the journal &quot;Academia pro Interlingua – Discussiones&quot;. In 1911, he formulated the word formation rule (known as De Wahl&#x27;s rule) that would form the basis of Occidental.

Occidental&#x27;s symbol, depicting an encircled tilde, was introduced before 1934 and was selected from several variants for its simplicity and symbolism.
In 1916, Russian artificial language enthusiasts founded the &quot;Kosmoglot&quot; Association in Saint Petersburg. Edgar von Wahl was not one of its founders, but later joined, as did the Estonian linguist Jakob Linzbach. Wahl became a spokesman for the &quot;naturalistic school&quot; of the association; thus paving the way for the creation of Occidental. With the revolutionary events of 1917 and the departure of its members from Saint Petersburg, the association&#x27;s activities faded away, ending entirely in 1921, but picking up again in Tallinn in the same year. The association&#x27;s activities were revived by Wahl together with Linzbach, and the association&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Kosmoglott&quot;. Ties were maintained with the former members of the association, which operated in several European countries. Wahl was also the editor of the &quot;Kosmoglott&quot; magazine published by the association from 1922 to 1926. In its first issue, Wahl introduced the artificial language he created, Occidental. From 1923 to 1928, he also promoted the language in the serial &quot;Occidental, unic natural, vermen neutral e max facil e comprensibil lingue por International relations&quot;. Wahl published a book in 1925 titled &quot;Radicarium directiv del lingue International (Occidental)&quot; in &quot;8 languages&quot;.

=== Spread ===

The first issue of the magazine &quot;Kosmoglott&quot; contained a letter sent to the League of Nations on 5 September 1921, recommending the introduction of a perfect language which would be easily acquired, not necessarily the most common planned language, for the communication between peoples. In order to find a suitable language, it was recommended that a competition be held and that the candidates be evaluated by a committee of experts convened by the League of Nations. The proposal was not taken up for consideration in the League of Nations.

Despite this failure, the Occidental language attracted interlinguists; in particular enthusiasts of Ido (the Esperantists remained faithful to their language). According to Ariste, internal disputes amongst the Idists and a personal appeal by Wahl led many to promote the language. In tandem with the growth of the language&#x27;s popularity, the activity of &quot;Kosmoglott&quot; association diminished, and the December 1928 an event in commemoration of Waldemar Rosenberger, who had died 10 years earlier, took place being the last bigger event of the society.
However, during the 1920s, new Occidental societies emerged. In 1927, the International Cosmoglotta Association was founded, which a year later was renamed Occidental-Union. Starting in 1927, &quot;Kosmoglott&quot; began to be published in Vienna (instead of Tallinn) under the new name &quot;Cosmoglotta&quot;. In the last issue published in Tallinn, Wahl published, among other things, Koidula&#x27;s poem under the title &quot;Max car donation&quot; (&quot;Dearest Gift&quot;). The success of the new language brought international renown to Wahl. He spoke publicly in various European countries and communicated closely with linguists. In 1939, he was likely the only Estonian to be invited to the &quot;5th Linguistic Conference&quot; in Brussels. During these times he was in active discussions with the Danish linguist and author of another planned language Novial Otto Jespersen which culminated in their meeting and the publication of its results as a separate book. However, unlike Jespersen, Wahl was an amateur linguist. His linguistic activities never reached broader theoretical linguistic problems, but were limited to constructing his own artificial language and tackling related issues.

Although Occidental showed significant success in the late 1920s and in 1930s, it never achieved the popularity of Esperanto. Unlike Esperanto, which became a popular language among labour movements, Occidental speakers in the interwar period were predominantly Western European intellectuals. Later, near and after Wahl&#x27;s death, discussions started among Occidentalists about whether to change the name of the language. Ric Berger, a leading Occidentalist from Switzerland, cited reports from the Eastern Bloc that the name Occidental was a hindrance to promoting the language. Berger had also become fond of the language Interlingua that was nearing publication, and he began envisioning a possible fusion between the two languages. These two factors convinced Berger to begin advocating the new name &quot;Interlingue&quot; in February 1948. The change in name took effect in October of the following year, and the Occidental-Union became the Interlingue-Union, as it is today. The association has its own academy and the magazine &quot;Cosmoglotta&quot; continues to be published by the association.

== Personal life ==
=== Family ===
Edgar von Wahl married Maria von Hübbenet (the daughter of Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna&#x27;s personal physician), in Saint Petersburg in 1894. They had five children: Johann or Hans, Guido, Ellen, Anatol, and Lydia Maria. The marriage was dissolved in 1913, after which Johann, Guido and Lydia stayed with Edgar while Anatol stayed with his mother, who moved to Finland, and some time later Lydia Maria also went there. Wahl&#x27;s two eldest sons moved to Germany at the start of World War I, where they served in the army. Guido spent a short vacation in Tallinn during the German occupation of Estonia during World War I, but at the end of 1918 he disappeared. According to one source he died in a battle with the Bolshevik Red Army near Tukums, Latvia in 1919.

In 1914, Edgar von Wahl married Agnes Riesenkampff. Like her husband, Agnes was a teacher, teaching gymnastics in Tallinn. In 1917, their daughter Veronika was born. The fate of Agnes was unclear for a long time. In 1946 it was suggested that she disappeared during the forced migrations of June 1941, but now it is known that she was arrested and shot by the NKVD in 1941.

=== Sailing ===
In addition to linguistics, Wahl was a hobby sailor. In 1895, he became a member of the , and in the following years was an active member, joining its technical committee and being the secretary of the club. He produced a yearbook dedicated to the club&#x27;s 25th anniversary in 1913. In 1922, Wahl became an honorary member of the club. He owned several yachts over the years, one of which, a ketch called &quot;Auli&quot;, he is said to have designed himself.

<text>Wiwaxia is a genus of soft-bodied animals that were covered in carbonaceous scales and spines that protected it from predators. &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; fossils—mainly isolated scales, but sometimes complete, articulated fossils—are known from early Cambrian and middle Cambrian fossil deposits across the globe. The living animal would have measured up to when fully grown, although a range of juvenile specimens are known, the smallest being long.

&quot;Wiwaxia&quot; affinity has been a matter of debate: Researchers were long split between two possibilities. On the one hand, its rows of scales looked superficially similar to certain scale worms (annelids); conversely, its mouthparts and general morphology suggested a relationship to the shell-less molluscs. More recently, evidence for a molluscan affinity has been accumulating, based on new details of &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; mouthparts, scales, and growth history. The name derives from Wiwaxy Peak in British Columbia.

The proposed clade Halwaxiida contains &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; as well as several similar Cambrian animals.

== Description ==
This article concentrates on the species &quot;Wiwaxia corrugata&quot;, which is known from hundreds of complete specimens in the Burgess Shale; other species are known only from fragmentary material or limited sample sizes.

=== Body ===
&quot;Wiwaxia&quot; was bilaterally symmetrical; viewed from the top the body was elliptical with no distinct head or tail, and from the front or rear it was almost rectangular. It reached in length. Estimating their height is difficult because specimens were compressed after death; a typical specimen may have been high excluding the spines on their backs. The ratio of width to length does not appear to change as the animals grew.

&quot;Wiwaxia&quot; flat underside was soft and unarmored; most of the surface was occupied by a single slug-like foot. Little is known of the internal anatomy, although the gut apparently ran straight and all the way from the front to the rear. At the front end of the gut, about from the animal&#x27;s front in an average specimen about long, there was a feeding apparatus that consisted of two (or in rare large specimens three) rows of backward-pointing conical teeth. The feeding apparatus was tough enough to be frequently preserved, but unmineralized and fairly flexible.

=== Sclerites ===

The animal was covered in eight rows of small ribbed armor plates called sclerites; these lay flat against the body, overlapped so that the rear of one covered the front of the one behind, and formed five main regions—the top; the upper part of the sides; the lower part of the sides; the front; and the bottom. Most of the sclerites were shaped like oval leaves, but the ventro-lateral ones, nearest the sea-floor, were crescent-shaped, rather like flattened bananas, and formed a single row. Larger specimens (&gt;~15 mm) bear two rows of ribbed spines running from front to rear, one along each side of the top surface, and projecting out and slightly upward, with a slight upward curve near the tips. Although the spines in the middle of each row are usually the longest, up to long, a few specimens have rather short middle spines that represent part-grown replacements.

Each sclerite was rooted separately in the body; the roots of body sclerites are 40% of the external length or a little less, while the roots of the spines are a little over 25% of the external length; all were rooted in pockets in the skin, rather like the follicles of mammalian hair. The roots of the body sclerites were significantly narrower than the sclerites, but the spines had roots about as wide as their bases; both types of root were made of fairly soft tissue. They bore protrusive, presumably structural, ribs on their upper and (seemingly) lower surfaces. The sclerites and spines were not mineralized, but made of a tough organic (carbon-based) biopolymer. Butterfield (1990) examined some sclerites under both optical and scanning electron microscopes and concluded that they were not hollow, and that the bases split and spread to form the blades, a pattern that is also seen in monocot leaves. The sclerites bear an internal fabric of longitudinal chambers, which suggest that they were secreted from their bases in the manner of Lophotrochozoan sclerites.

As known from &quot;Marrella&quot; and &quot;Canadia&quot;, its sclerites may have been iridescent due to evidence of diffraction grating, although questioned in later study.

=== Ontogeny ===
&quot;Wiwaxia&quot; scleritome comprises eight rows of sclerites, arranged in bundles. Sclerites are periodically shed and replaced during growth, with the number of sclerites in a given bundle increasing as the animal ages to produce a thicker scleritome. Once specimens reach a certain size, spines are added to the scleritome; this size is ~15 mm in &quot;W. corrugata&quot; but substantially smaller in &quot;W. taijengensis&quot;. One juvenile specimen was originally interpreted as molting, but in fact represents a single, folded, individual.
== Ecology ==

The long dorsal spines may have been a defense against predators. &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; apparently moved by contractions of a slug-like foot on its underside. In one specimen a small brachiopod, &quot;Diraphora bellicostata&quot;, appears to be attached to one of the ventro-lateral sclerites. This suggests that adult &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; did not burrow or even plough much into the sea-floor as they moved. Two other specimens of &quot;Diraphora bellicostata&quot; have been found attached to dorsal sclerites. &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; appears to have been solitary rather than gregarious. The feeding apparatus may have acted as a rasp to scrape bacteria off the top of the microbial mat that covered the sea-floor, or as a rake to gather food particles from the sea-floor.

== Classification ==
During the Cambrian, most of the main groupings of animals recognised today were beginning to diverge. Consequently, many lineages (that would later become extinct) appear intermediate to two or more modern groups, or lack features common to all modern members of a group, and hence fall into the &quot;stem group&quot; of a modern taxon. Debate is ongoing as to whether &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; can be placed within a modern crown group and, if it cannot, in which group&#x27;s stem it falls. When Walcott first described &quot;Wiwaxia&quot;, he regarded it as a polychaete annelid worm, and its sclerites as similar to the elytra (&quot;scales&quot;) of annelids. More recently the debate has been intense, and proposed classifications include: a member of an extinct phylum distantly related to the molluscs; a crown-group polychaete; a stem-group annelid; a problematic bilaterian; a stem- or possibly primitive crown-group mollusc.

In 1985, Simon Conway Morris agreed that there were similarities to polychaetes, but considered that &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; sclerites were different in construction from annelids&#x27; elytra. He was more impressed by the similarities between &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; feeding apparatus and a molluscan radula, and assigned the animal to a new taxon Molluscata, which he proposed should also contain the molluscs and hyolithids. When he later described the first fairly complete specimens of &quot;Halkieria&quot;, he suggested that these were closely related to &quot;Wiwaxia&quot;.

Nick Butterfield, then a postgraduate paleontologist at Harvard inspired by Stephen Jay Gould&#x27;s lectures, agreed that the sclerites were not like elytra, which are relatively fleshy and soft. However, since the sclerites were solid, he concluded that &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; could not be a member of the &quot;Coeloscleritophora&quot;, a taxon that had been proposed in order to unite organisms with hollow sclerites, and could not be closely related to the halkieriids, which have hollow sclerites. Instead he thought that they were very similar in several ways to the chitinous bristles (setae) that project from the bodies of modern annelids and in some genera form leaf-like scales that cover the back like roof tiles—in composition, in detailed structure, in how they were attached to the body via &quot;follicles&quot; and in overall appearance. Some modern annelids also develop on each side rows of longer bristles, which both Walcott and Butterfield considered similar to &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; dorsal spines. including the halkieriids.
Butterfield also contended that &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; feeding apparatus, instead of being mounted in the middle of its &quot;head&quot;, was just as likely to be mounted in two parts on the sides of the &quot;head&quot;, an arrangement that is common in polychaetes. He went so far as to classify &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; as a member of a modern order, Phyllodocida, and pointed out that &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; lack of obvious segmentation is no barrier to this, as some modern polychaetes also show no segmentation except during development. He later noted that &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; lack some polychaete features which he would expect to be easily preserved in fossils, and therefore a stem-group annelid, in other words an evolutionary &quot;aunt&quot; of modern annelids.

Conway Morris and Peel (1995) largely accepted Butterfield&#x27;s arguments and treated &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; as an ancestor or &quot;aunt&quot; of the polychaetes, and said Butterfield had informed them that the microscopic structure of &quot;Wiwaxia&quot;s sclerites was identical to that of the bristles of two Burgess Shale polychaetes &quot;Burgessochaeta&quot; and &quot;Canadia&quot;. Conway Morris and Peel also wrote that one specimen of &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; showed traces of a small shell, possibly a vestige left over from an earlier stage in the animal&#x27;s evolution, and noted that one group of modern polychaetes also has what may be a vestigial shell. However, they maintained that &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; feeding apparatus was much more like a molluscan radula. They also argued that &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; was fairly closely related to and in fact descended from the halkieriids, as the sclerites are divided into similar groups, although those of halkieriids were much smaller and more numerous; they also said that in 1994 Butterfield had found &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; sclerites that were clearly hollow. They presented a large cladogram according to which:
*The earliest halkieriids were a &quot;sister&quot; group to the molluscs, in other words descendants of a fairly closely related common ancestor.
*The halkieriids which Conway Morris had found in Greenland&#x27;s Sirius Passet lagerstätte were a &quot;sister&quot; group to brachiopods, animals whose modern forms have bivalve shells, but differ from molluscs in having muscular stalks and a distinctive feeding apparatus, the lophophore.
*Another halkieriid genus, &quot;Thambetolepis&quot;, was a &quot;great aunt&quot; of annelids and &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; was an &quot;aunt&quot; of annelids.

Marine biologist Amélie H. Scheltema &quot;et al.&quot; (2003) argued that &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; feeding apparatus is very similar to the radulas of some modern shell-less aplacophoran molluscs, and that the sclerites of the two groups are very similar. They concluded that &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; was a member of a clade that includes molluscs. Scheltema has also highlighted similarities between &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; and the larvae of certain solenogaster molluscs, which bear iterated calcareous sclerites arranged into three symmetrical lateral zones.

Danish zoologist Danny Eibye-Jacobsen argued in 2004 that &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; lacks any characters that would firmly place it as a polychaete or annelid. Eibye-Jacobsen regarded bristles as a feature shared by molluscs, annelids and brachiopods. Hence even if &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; sclerites closely resembled bristles, which he doubted, this would not prove that &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; closest relative was the annelids. He also pointed out that the very different numbers of sclerites in the various zones of &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; body do not correspond to any reasonable pattern of segmentation; while Eibye-Jacobsen did not think that this alone would prevent classification of &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; as a polychaete, he thought it was a serious objection given the lack of other clearly polychaete features. In his opinion there were no strong grounds for classifying &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; as a proto-annelid or a proto-mollusc, although he thought the objections against classification as a proto-annelid were the stronger.

Butterfield returned to the debate in 2006, repeating the arguments he presented in 1990 for regarding &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; as an early polychaete and adding that, while bristles are a feature of several groups, they appear as a covering over the back only in polychaetes.

A 2012 study redescribing the mouthparts found a number of similarities with the molluscan radula, and overthrew some of the better arguments for an annelid affinity, seemingly demonstrating that &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; was indeed a mollusc.

== Occurrence ==
&quot;Wiwaxia&quot; was originally described by G. F. Matthew in 1899, from an isolated spine that had been found earlier in the Ogyopsis Shale, and classified as &quot;Orthotheca corrugata&quot;. Further specimens were found by American paleontologist Charles Doolittle Walcott in 1911 as a result of one of his field trips to the nearby Burgess Shale (Miaolingian, ) in the Canadian Rocky Mountains; he classified it as a member of the polychaete group of annelid worms in its own genus &quot;Wiwaxia corrugata&quot;, citing similarities to the Aphroditidae and Polynoidae.

In 1966 and 1967, a team led by Harry B. Whittington revisited the Burgess Shale and found so many fossils that it took years to analyze them all. Four hundred and sixty-four complete specimens of &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; are known from the Greater Phyllopod bed, where they comprise 0.88% of the community. Eventually in 1985 Simon Conway Morris, then a member of Whittington&#x27;s team, published a detailed description and concluded that &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; was not a polychaete. All the known specimens came from in and around the Burgess Shale until 1991, when fragmentary fossils were reported from Australia&#x27;s Georgina Basin. In 2004 additional finds which may represent two different species were reported from the same area.

Articulated specimens are known from Cambrian Stage 3 of Xiaoshiba, China; fragmentary specimens have also been found in the Chengjiang, Cambrian Series 2 deposits in Guizhou, China, and in China&#x27;s lowermost Miaolingian beds of the Kaili Formation, in the Middle Cambrian beds of the Tyrovice Member, Buchava Formation of the Czech Republic, in the Lower Cambrian Mount Cap formation (Mackenzie Mountains, Canada), in the Emu Bay Shale of Kangaroo Island, South Australia, upper Botomian Stage of the Lower Cambrian, and in the Middle Botomian Sinsk Biota of Siberia, Russia. Isolated sclerites are also common in the small carbonaceous fossil record. Taken together, these finds show that &quot;Wiwaxia&quot; had a truly cosmopolitan distribution, occurring at all palaeolatitudes and on most palaeocontinents. The Chinese material was originally considered to represent a separate species; like &quot;W. corrugata&quot;, it possessed spines and regions of sclerites (although it is only known from disarticulated remains), but the sclerites bear a higher density of ribs, and there are two distinct thicknesses of rib (i.e. larger and smaller). At a microscopic level, the sclerites do not differ from Burgess Shale or Mount Cap sclerites, but the Chinese material seems to have developed spines from an early age, distinguishing it from the &quot;W. corrugata&quot;. The knob-bearing sclerites from all three localities seem to belong to a different species, and a further species is represented in the Xiaoshiba deposits. What is surprising is the limited variety exhibited between species: all have a fundamentally equivalent scleritome, displaying a notable degree of morphological stasis for some 15 Ma.

Isolated spines are more common than sclerites in localities with a poor preservation potential, suggesting that the spines were more recalcitrant (or more commonly collected); however, in well-preserved sites such as the Phyllopod bed, spine and sclerite abundance is comparable, in disarticulated instances, to the proportions on complete fossils.

Younger spines of possible wiwaxiid origin have been observed from the Valongo Formation (Middle Ordovician: Dapingian-Darriwilian) of northern Portugal and have been reported, if not described, from the Fezouata Biota.

<doc id="1027434" wikidata="Q818733" url="?curid=1027434" title="Alfred J. Kwak">
<text>Alfred J. Kwak is a children&#x27;s animated comedy-drama television series based on a Dutch theatre show by Herman van Veen, produced by Telecable Benelux B.V. in co-production with VARA, ZDF, , TV Tokyo, and animated by Telescreen Japan, and first shown in 1989. It consists of 52 episodes. The series characters were designed by Harald Siepermann. There are also toys and a comic based on the animated series.

The series has been broadcast in many countries and has been dubbed and subtitled in Dutch, French, Japanese, Greek, English, Italian, Spanish, Hebrew, Arabic, Hungarian, Finnish, Serbian, Polish, German, Swedish, Danish, Icelandic, Chinese, Czech, Romanian, Korean and Norwegian.

In 1991, Herman van Veen won the Goldene Kamera award for the cartoon.

==Origins==
==Plot==
Alfred J. Kwak was born as the son of Johan Sebastian and Anna Kwak. Some time after his birth, Alfred loses his parents and his brothers and sisters after a car hits them as they&#x27;re moving their home during a heavy rainstorm. Alfred was saved due to his being distracted by a frog, which he broke away from his family to chase. Henk the mole, a good friend of the Kwak family, raises the little orphan duck. Alfred experiences a lot of adventures.

Unlike many other cartoons targeted for children, &quot;Alfred J. Kwak&quot; features exceptionally mature and often dark themes. Amongst others it deals with different social and political issues, such as abuse of power, but also raises important values such as friendship and solidarity.

The cartoon is also notable for the political themes on which it touches. In the cartoon, Alfred fights against a fascist dictator, takes in refugees fleeing from a country under apartheid (with white geese and black ducks), saves whales against hunters, and oversees the changeover of his country from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy with a democratically elected president. Such themes are far from typical in a children&#x27;s cartoon, and form a big part of &quot;Alfred J. Kwak&quot;&#x27;s appeal. Other episodes have satirised the Japanese love of golf, and criticised countries which have sharp north/south economic divides.

The cartoon is also unusual for the subtlety of its long-term narrative. In most children&#x27;s cartoons, the characters do not age. In &quot;Alfred J. Kwak&quot;, we see the progress of the main characters from very young children to adulthood as the series advances. This is particularly striking in the character of Dolf, who is initially a mere schoolboy, but who, as time passes, becomes a criminal and a dictator.

===Setting===
The time setting of the cartoon is somewhat surreal. On the whole the technology and dress of most characters seems appropriate to the late 20th century, and yet Alfred and Paljas/Boffin often travel in a spaceship with a technology far more advanced than that, while many characters such as the king&#x27;s staff, Scratchpaws the cat, and Dolf in his Napoleonic incarnation wear clothes more appropriate to previous ages. Other surreal elements to the cartoon include such strange characters as the evil genie of the bottle, living chess pieces from Alfred&#x27;s chess game, Pied Piper style Clown on the Moon, and aliens who appear like ducks except for their human-style feet, and a &quot;dream&quot; style wild West episode during which Dolf seems to become aware that he is a character in a cartoon.

==Characters==

===Main characters===

====Alfred====
Alfred Jodocus Kwak is a duck. As a baby he lived in a giant clog with his family. After his family was run over by a car, he was adopted by Henk and lives with him in Henk&#x27;s grandfathers house. Later Alfred moves in to a clog-shaped house, using his old cradle as his bed. He is very concerned with other people and values many virtues, like human rights and good manners. Friends, family and the environment, are also close to his heart and he in some episodes even risks his own safety when it comes to do the right thing. Although he has gone through a lot of sad things, his favourite song is &#x27;Ik ben vandaag zo vrolijk&#x27; (I&#x27;m so happy today). In the English version, his middle name is changed to &quot;Johnathan&quot;. In the Hebrew version, His name is &quot;Shealtiel&quot;. In the Icelandic version he is named Alfreð Önd.

====Dolf====
Dolf is Alfred&#x27;s archenemy and first appears in episode 4. In the first episode Dolf&#x27;s parents, a crow and a blackbird, can be seen making disparaging comments on the eggs of Alfred&#x27;s mother. Both are dressed in traditional German garments. The father wears lederhosen, a feathered hat and, in the Dutch original, speaks with a heavy German accent, while Dolf&#x27;s mother is seen in a dirndl outfit. In the German version, Dolf is called Kra, in the Finnish version, he is called Korppi.
Dolf gradually develops from a mere naughty schoolboy to a merciless dictator, an arms dealer, a reckless politician, and overall criminal. Though the show clearly portrays Dolf&#x27;s acts as inherently negative and wrong, it also provides the background on how Dolf became who he is. For example, as a child, Dolf is prone to blame others for problems in which he too played a role. Dolf mentions that his mother died very early and that his father neglects him due to alcoholism. Dolf can also be seen to express a sense of self hate and poor self image; as he is disgusted by the fact that he is only part crow, and paints his orange beak black to disguise his true identity. When Alfred accidentally finds out about this, he cannot understand why Dolf is so ashamed and urges him to drop the secret and tell others about it. Dolf however is petrified and convinced that his friends will make fun of him, and makes Alfred swear he will never tell anyone about it.
Episode 22 through 25 are essentially an allegory of the rise and fall of Fascism and Nazism, with Dolf himself, though wearing a Napoleonic uniform, as a clear caricature of Adolf Hitler. It begins with Dolf returning from abroad, in a train with Austrian markings, and meeting up with his friends. He then discusses the current political climate in Great Waterland, and expresses disgust of it. Dolf then decides to found a political party, the later &quot;National Crows Party&quot;, for which he goes to Alfred to lend money. He explains his ideas, but Alfred refuses and Dolf barges out of Alfred&#x27;s house in a fit of rage. Alfred and Henk express their fear of Dolf, but Henk reassures Alfred that Dolf will never gather enough money to fund his intended party. Not much later however, Dolf inherits a huge fortune. He founds his party, which through promising employment and change quickly becomes a major and powerful political movement. Dolf eventually stages a coup d&#x27;etat and takes over the country. Political opponents, including Alfred, are imprisoned on the charge of high treason. Alfred and his friends barely escape and flee abroad to the neighboring country of Great Reedland. Not much later the King of Great Waterland himself flees as well, and Dolf proclaims himself Emperor Dolf I. Alfred and the other political dissidents however devised a plan to dispose of Dolf and steal Dolf&#x27;s inheritances from the vaults of his palace. Without his money, Dolf&#x27;s power quickly dwindles and he is forced to flee.

Dolf eventually makes an appearance as an illegal arms dealer and general criminal in further episodes. In the 43rd and 44th episodes, the King has decided to abdicate and for the first time democratic elections are held. Dolf once again attempts to rule Great Waterland as one of the three official candidates. In order to get ahead of other two candidates (Ollie being the first candidate), he hires some foreigners to sabotage the dam, which protects the waterland from being flooded by the seawater. After the dam has broken, Dolf cunningly withdraws his entry because he wants to *help* people and cannot waste time on a campaign. Dolf then publicly funds the repairs of the dam, skyrocketing his popularity and prompting his reentry in the presidential race. He then, in an attempt to get rid of any compromising evidence, tries to kill Lispel, who saw the criminal act. Lispel manages to escape and, though heavily wounded, is able to tell Alfred the truth on the flood.

Dolf manages to escape and continues his life of crime. In the final two episodes, Dolf becomes the henchman of an oil magnate who is attempting to get his hands on the blueprints of an environmentally friendly fuel, invented by Professor Buffon. After a fight, in which Dolf attempts to kill Alfred by pushing his car off the road, Dolf is again captured and is sentenced to 26 years of imprisonment. Aided by a former member of his Crows Party, he can escape and takes Winnie, Alfred&#x27;s girlfriend, hostage. In the series&#x27; finale, after a manic hunt, Alfred finds Dolf, who tells him where Winnie is. After telling Alfred her whereabouts, Dolf attempts to escape, only to be caught by the police and put back into prison.

====Henk====
Henk is a mole and the adoptive father of Alfred. In the Israeli version, he is called Hafi, a diminutive for &quot;Hafarperet&quot; - the Hebrew word for &quot;mole&quot;.

====Winnie====
Winnie is a black duck and Alfred&#x27;s girlfriend, her name is a reference to Winnie Mandela. In the Dutch version, she speaks Afrikaans-accented Dutch; Afrikaans being a language closely related to Dutch and spoken in South Africa. Alfred meets her and her family, in episode 27, on a train leaving for Great Waterland after his holidays. Her family are refugees who escaped from their home country after it has been taken over by white geese. After Alfred helps her parents to sort out the problems in her country, she joins Alfred on many of his adventures and holidays. She works in the local university as a secretary (as first seen in episode 34) and lives with her brother Tom in a little house near the forest.

===Secondary characters===
* Professor Paljas is an interdisciplinary academic. He is a polar bear, and speaks with a German accent. In the UK, Hungarian, Serbian, and Israeli versions he is called Professor Buffon. He makes his first appearance in episode 18, in which he attempts to communicate with the whales in the South Pole using his new invention &quot;Jonus&quot;. He returns in episode 26, in which he asks Alfred to join him on his expedition to the Himalayas. He also travels (with Alfred of course), to Egypt to find the only medicine which can cure his ill colleague, and the jungle to investigate a volcano which keeps erupting. He cares a lot about the environment and develops a petrol for vehicles that doesn&#x27;t expose any carbon monoxide and prevents acid rain.
*Ollie is Alfred&#x27;s close school-friend, a stork who grows up to be a lawyer, and later, after the defeat of Dolf, the first democratically elected president of Great Waterland. In the Dutch version, Ollie is a girl during childhood, but a male when he is an adult, confirming his status as transgender. This change is never directly addressed in the series. In a Dutch interview from 2013 however, Van Veen stated that this gender change was intentional, since that also happens in the real world. In the Israeli version, is a female and is named Luli.
*Pikkie is another friend of Alfred&#x27;s from his schooldays. A magpie, Pikkie is prone to stealing shiny objects, a trait which often lands his friends in trouble. Pikkie is called Stibitzi (and portrayed as female) in the German version, Ruby in the Israeli version, Grabbie in the UK version, Hannu in Finnish version and Grabljivko in Serbian version. He makes his first appearance in episode 2, in which he attends Alfred&#x27;s first birthday party. He steals the king&#x27;s ruby during a visit in the king&#x27;s castle and Alfred gets blamed for it. He is often seen in the early episodes when Alfred was still at school. After episode 12 he isn&#x27;t seen or spoken of for 19 episodes. We are not told what he did or where he was during Dolf&#x27;s activism and other events. Alfred and Henk meet him again coincidentally on an oil rig, sporting a stubbly beard, where he worked as a diamond expert. In episode 49 he falls from the sky in front of Alfred&#x27;s house after trying to fly to the rainbow. He joins Alfred, Prof. Paljas and Henk on an expedition to the rainforest in which the legendary Pot of Gold is kept. His weakness for shining objects persuades him to steal it but Dolf takes it from him at the airport.
* Franz Ferdinand is a lion and the king of Great Waterland, the country in which Alfred lives. He is a well-meaning, yet lazy and incompetent monarch, with no interest in politics. He is named after the real historical figure Franz Ferdinand. He makes his first appearance in episode 2. In episode 20 Alfred wonders what kind of a king he is. He then is shown lying in his lemonade bath and enjoying life, when a servant comes in and tells him that the messenger from Great Sparrowland has arrived and wants to speak him. The king claims that he just got into the bath, but the servant reassures him that he&#x27;s been in it for over two hours. The king asks the servant to speak with the messenger for him but since his signature is needed he reluctantly gets out of the bath. In episode 21 the king goes bankrupt and is forced to take loan from Alfred, which he doesn&#x27;t pay back. After the rise of Dolf, the exiled king realises how careless and reluctant he has been, and begins to take interest in politics. After Dolf&#x27;s fall, in the planning of which Franz Ferdinand was involved, he becomes a just and beloved king. In episode 43 however, he decides to surrender all his executive power and remain only as a ceremonial head of state, with a democratically elected president as the actual head of government.
*Lispel is a sinister jellyfish and a spy working for the mayor of the city. As his name suggests, he talks with a lisp. He makes his first appearance in episode 7 as a contact to another agent. In episodes 14, 16 &amp; 19 he informs the mayor of Alfred&#x27;s plans of preventing him from making ships that catch all fish of the world. In episode 23, during Dolf&#x27;s activism Lispel informs Dolf where Alfred and his friends are hiding after they escaped imprisonment. In episode 27 he sees Alfred taking in the refugees and threatens to tell the authorities unless he gets three gold coins. Alfred gives him the money but doesn&#x27;t listen to Lispel&#x27;s information (Which he must tell him, because he got his money). After several attempts of getting Alfred to listen to him, Lispel does go to the police and betrays them. Lispel makes some minor appearances in later episodes, but in episode 44, before the presidential elections, he sees Dolf and some hired foreigners damaging the dam which causes a huge flood. Dolf pays for repairs and equipment to become more popular, but Lispel threatens to tell unless he gets his gold. Dolf refuses because he thinks that Lispel will keep returning for more gold. By the docks (Their meeting point), Dolf pulls out a revolver and shoots Lispel several times. Lispel falls into the sea. Later in the episode he stands, badly injured, in Alfred&#x27;s front garden and tells him everything. His last appearance is in episode 51 in which he informs the mayor of Prof. Paljas&#x27;s plans on making a petrol which doesn&#x27;t expose any gases or fumes. He receives his payment, leaves the mayor&#x27;s house and is never seen again. He is not present at Alfred&#x27;s birthday in the last episode.

===Setting===

====Great Waterland====
Great Waterland (&quot;Groot-Waterland&quot; in Dutch) is arguably the most important setting within the series. It is Alfred&#x27;s birthplace as well the home, or future home, of many of the show&#x27;s characters. It is, partly, a caricature of the Netherlands. The land consists of polders, the town Alfred lives in is built in a typical Dutch style, while he himself lives in a house made from a clog. For most of the series Great Waterland is an absolute monarchy, led by Franz Ferdinand, a lion. Near the conclusion of the show&#x27;s first season Dolf assumes command, and Waterland briefly becomes an authoritarian fascist state, before reverting to a monarchy and eventually becoming a constitutional monarchy with an elected president.

<doc id="1027435" wikidata="Q1540926" url="?curid=1027435" title="Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw">
<text>The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier () is a monument in Warsaw, Poland, dedicated to the unknown soldiers who have given their lives for Poland. It is one of many such national tombs of unknowns that were erected after World War I, and the most important such monument in Poland.

The monument, located at Piłsudski Square, is the only surviving part of the Saxon Palace that occupied the spot until World War II. Since 2 November 1925 the tomb houses the unidentified body of a young soldier who fell during the Defence of Lwów. Since then, earth from numerous battlefields where Polish soldiers have fought has been added to the urns housed in the surviving pillars of the Saxon Palace.

The Tomb is constantly lit by an eternal flame and assisted by a guard post provided by the three companies of the 1st Guards Battalion, Representative Regiment of the Polish Armed Forces. It is there that most official military commemorations take place in Poland and where foreign representatives lay wreaths when visiting Poland.

The changing of the guard takes place every full hour, 365 days a year.

==History==

In 1923, a group of unknown Varsovians placed, before Warsaw&#x27;s Saxon Palace and the adjacent Saxon Garden, a stone tablet commemorating all the unknown Polish soldiers who had fallen in World War I and the subsequent Polish-Soviet War. This initiative was taken up by several Warsaw newspapers and by General Władysław Sikorski. On April 4, 1925, the Polish Ministry of War selected a battlefield from which the ashes of an unknown soldier would be brought to Warsaw. Of some 40 battles, that for Lwów was chosen. In October 1925, at Lwów&#x27;s Cemetery of the Defenders of Lwów, three coffins were exhumed: those of an unknown sergeant, corporal, and private. The coffin that was to be transported to Warsaw was chosen by Jadwiga Zarugiewiczowa, mother of a soldier who had fallen at Zadwórze and whose body had never been found.

On November 2, 1925, the coffin was brought to Warsaw&#x27;s St. John&#x27;s Cathedral, where a Mass was held. Afterward eight recipients of the order of Virtuti Militari bore the coffin to its final resting place beneath the colonnade joining the two wings of the Saxon Palace. The coffin was buried along with 14 urns containing soil from as many battlegrounds, a Virtuti Militari medal, and a memorial tablet. Since then, except under German occupation during World War II, an honor guard has continuously been held before the Tomb.

==Architecture==
The Tomb was designed by the famous Polish sculptor, Stanisław Kazimierz Ostrowski. It was located within the arcade that linked the two symmetrical wings of the Saxon Palace, then the seat of the Polish Ministry of War. The central tablet was ringed by 5 eternal flames and 4 stone tablets bearing the names and dates of battles in which Polish soldiers had fought during World War I and the Polish–Soviet War (1919–21). Behind the Tomb were two steel gratings bearing emblems of Poland&#x27;s two highest Polish military decorations—the &quot;Virtuti Militari&quot; and Cross of Valor.

During the 1939 invasion of Poland, the building was slightly damaged by German aerial bombing, but it was quickly rebuilt and seized by the German authorities. After the Warsaw Uprising, in December 1944, the palace was completely demolished by the Wehrmacht. Only part of the central colonnade, sheltering the Tomb, was preserved. Although German sappers were ordered to demolish the entire palace they refused to demolish the section that housed the tomb and its memorial. The original damaged walls either side of the present building are still in evidence.

After the war, in late 1945, reconstruction began. Only a small part of the palace, containing the Tomb, was restored by Henryk Grunwald. On 8 May 1946 it was opened to the public. Soil from 24 additional battlegrounds was added to the urns, as well as more tablets with names of battles in which Poles had fought in the Spanish Civil War and World War II. However, the government of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic erased all trace of the Polish–Soviet War of 1920 as a goodwill gesture towards the Soviet Union, and only a few of the Polish Armed Forces&#x27; battles in the West were included. In the years following the end of communism in Poland in 1989, the names of Polish-Soviet War battles were restored, the names of Spanish Civil War battles were erased, and tablets containing the names of battles fought by the cursed soldiers were added.

In August 2022 ground works started on rebuilding the Saxon Palace, after the Polish Government announced a plan for reconstruction. It is expected to be completed by 2030.

<text>Herbert Knott Sorrell (April 18, 1897 – May 7, 1973) was an American labor leader and Hollywood union organizer. He headed the Conference of Studio Unions (CSU) in the late 1940s, and was the business manager of the Motion Picture Painters union, Local 644 until the 1950s.

==Early life==
At age twelve, he found employment in a sewer pipe factory in Oakland, California, and later in Oakland he worked with union leader Harry Bridges. At one point he tried boxing as a career. He moved to Los Angeles in 1925, became a scenery painter for the movie studios, and joined the local painters union. In April 1937, his union local was one of those unaffiliated with IATSE which formed the Federation of Motion Picture Crafts (FMPC). The same month, the FMPC went on strike against the major studios. In the picket line at Warner Brothers, Sorrell&#x27;s determination earned him the rank of &quot;picket captain&quot;, and the attention of Blayney F. Mathews, head of Warner Brothers&#x27; security, who had him arrested. He was never charged and was released several days later. This notoriety led to his subsequent position as the business representative for the painter&#x27;s union and as a result he became one of the major negotiators who settled the strike in June.

==Conference of Studio Unions==
In May 1941, Sorrell called for a strike against the Disney film studio. The strike was supported by the newly formed Screen Cartoonist&#x27;s Guild, and the cooperation resulted in the organization of the Conference of Studio Unions (CSU), which Sorrell proceeded to lead.

In 1945, Sorrell lead the CSU strike that led to Hollywood Black Friday. The strike originated from a dispute between two unions, CSU and IATSE, over which one of them had union authority over 77 set decorators. After an National Labor Relations Board vote and War Labor Board decision in favor of CSU, the studios refused to recognize CSU&#x27;s bargaining authority, and the strike began. After violence on Black Friday, the strike quickly settled. However, collusion between the IATSE leadership and the studios resulted in a lockout which developed into a strike in September 1946, which the CSU did not have the financial strength to endure. Sorrell was convicted of &quot;contempt of court&quot; and &quot;failure to disperse&quot; in connection with the 1945 strike but acquitted of all of the felony charges. which included &quot;inciting to riot&quot; and &quot;rioting.&quot;

==Communist ties==
In 1941 and again in 1946, Sorrell testified before the California Legislature&#x27;s Joint Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities (the Tenney Committee), but there was insufficient evidence that he was tied to the Communist Party. The CSU strike of 1945, which Sorrell had led, was actively opposed by the Communist Party USA. In 1947, Walt Disney testified before the House Committee on Un-American Activities that he &quot;believed at that time that Mr. Sorrell was a Communist because of all the things that I had heard and having seen his name appearing on a number of Commie front things.&quot; Sorrell was also deemed responsible for the rumor of Disney&#x27;s anti-Semitism, possibly as retaliation for Disney&#x27;s testimony to the committee on Un-American Activities.

In 1953, in an actor&#x27;s lawsuit, Sorrell testified that he was never a communist, but he accepted money from them, and &quot;felt free to spend communist money&quot;.

<doc id="1027441" wikidata="Q6127463" url="?curid=1027441" title="Jerk (cooking)">
<text>Jerk is a style of cooking native to Jamaica, in which meat is dry-rubbed or wet-marinated with a hot spice mixture called Jamaican jerk spice.

The technique of &quot;jerking&quot; (or cooking with &quot;jerk spice&quot;) originated from Jamaica&#x27;s indigenous peoples, the Arawak and Taíno tribes, and was adopted by the descendants of 17th-century Jamaican Maroons who intermingled with them.

The smoky taste of jerked meat is achieved by using various cooking methods, including modern wood-burning ovens. Chicken or pork is usually jerked, and the main ingredients of the spicy jerk marinade / sauce are allspice and scotch bonnet peppers, which are native to Jamaica. 

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;jerk&quot; is said to come from &quot;charqui&quot;, a Spanish term of Quechua origin for jerked or dried meat, which eventually became the word &quot;jerky&quot; in English.

The term &quot;jerk spice&quot; (also known as &quot;Jamaican jerk spice&quot;) refers to a spice rub. The word &quot;jerk&quot; refers to the spice rub, a wet marinade and mop sauce made from it, and to the particular cooking technique.

== History ==

According to evidence from historians, jerked meat was first cooked by the indigenous Taínos. During the invasion of Jamaica in 1655, the Spanish colonists freed their enslaved Africans who fled into the Jamaican countryside, intermingling with the remaining Taínos, learning and adapting aspects of their culture— thus, becoming some of the first Jamaican Maroons. It appears that these runaway slaves learned this practice from the Taínos.

The method of cooking in underground pits is speculated by some, to have been used in order to avoid creating smoke which would have given away their location— though it is common throughout the world, and is best known in Hawaii, in the form of kālua-style imu cooking, central to the luau, as well as, barbacoa in Mesoamerica. 

Historians believe that the Taínos developed the style of cooking and seasoning used across the region. The method of &quot;jerking&quot; meats on native pimento wood also came from the Taíno term &quot;“barabicu”&quot; or &quot;barbacoa&quot;, which means “framework of sticks”, applied to a range of wooden structures, including a raised wooden grill for roasting and smoking foods.
This Taíno technique is applied throughout the Americas, and many food historians agree that all forms of &quot;barbecue&quot; in the Americas are descendants of this cooking style.

While all racial groups hunted wild hogs in the Jamaican interior, and used the practice of &quot;jerking&quot; to cook them in the 17th century, by the end of the 18th century most groups had switched to imported pork products. Mainly the Maroons continued the practice of hunting wild hogs and &quot;jerking&quot; pork.
&quot;Jamaican jerk&quot; sauce primarily developed by these Maroons, added flavour to wild hogs which were seasoned with herbs and allspice, and then slow cooked over pimento wood. The use of scotch bonnet is largely responsible for the heat found in Caribbean jerks. Over time the basic recipe has been modified as various cultures added their influence. 

Jerk cooking and seasoning have followed the Caribbean diaspora all over the world, and forms of jerk can now be found at restaurants almost anywhere a significant population of Caribbean descent exists— such as the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, coastal Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua and San Andrés. As such, &quot;Jamaican jerk&quot; has developed a global following, most notably in American, Canadian and Western European cosmopolitan urban centres.
&quot;Poulet boucané&quot; (or &#x27;smoked chicken&#x27;), a dish found in French Caribbean countries such as Martinique and Guadeloupe, is quite similar to traditional &quot;Jamaican jerk&quot; chicken.

== Techniques ==
The cooking technique of &quot;jerking&quot; and the results it produces, have evolved over time— from using pit fires to grilling over coals in old metal barrel halves. Around the 1960s, Caribbean entrepreneurs seeking an easier, more portable method of &quot;jerking&quot;, began cutting oil barrels lengthwise, adding holes for ventilation and hinged lids to capture the smoke. These barrels are fired with charcoal, and have become widely used across the island. Other &quot;jerking&quot; methods include wood-burning ovens.

Street-side &quot;jerk stands&quot; or &quot;jerk centres&quot; are frequently found in Jamaica and the nearby Cayman Islands, as well as, other places that experienced waves of Jamaican migration— like San Andrés. Jerked meat, usually chicken or pork, can be purchased along with hard dough bread, bammy (a native cassava flatbread), Jamaican fried dumplings (known as &quot;Johnnycake&quot; or &quot;journey cakes&quot;), and festival, a variation of sweet flavoured fried dumplings, served as a side dish.

== Ingredients ==
Jerk seasoning principally consists of allspice and scotch bonnet peppers. Other ingredients may include cloves, cinnamon, scallions, nutmeg, thyme, garlic, brown sugar, ginger, soy sauce, vinegar, and salt.

== Uses ==
Jerk seasoning was originally used on chicken and pork, but in modern recipes it is used with other ingredients including fish, shrimp, lobster, conch, shellfish, beef, sausage, lamb, goat, tofu, and vegetables. In Jamaica, jerk is also used in the preparation of pizzas, patties and burgers. 

==Protection of &quot;Jamaica Jerk&quot;==
Due to the growing international popularity of &quot;Jamaican jerk&quot;, a number of unauthentic jerk products are being sold outside of Jamaica. Consequently, the Jamaican government trademarked Jamaica Jerk, as a geographical indication (GI), in September 2015— making Jamaica, the first country in the English-speaking Caribbean to register a GI.
The move is aimed at guarding against those who seek to capitalise on the Jamaican brand, and to protect &quot;Jamaican jerk&quot; internationally from misrepresentation and imitation.
The GI protects the quality, characteristics and reputation of &quot;Jamaican jerk&quot;, and prevents third parties from using the term for products that do not meet the standards set out in the GI&#x27;s code of practice.
