<text>A public-safety answering point (PSAP), sometimes called a public-safety access point, is a type of call center where the public&#x27;s telephone calls for first responders (such as police, fire department, or emergency medical services/ambulance) are received and handled. It takes calls from any landline, mobile phone line, or VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) line. It can also happen that when 112 is dialed in then a logic is implemented by mobile or network operators to route the call to the nearest police station. Such call centers exist in most countries to answer calls to an emergency telephone number. Trained telephone operators are also usually responsible for dispatching these emergency services. Most PSAPs are now capable of caller location for landline calls, and many can handle mobile phone locations as well (sometimes referred to as phase II location), where the mobile phone company has a handset to location system. Some can also use voice broadcasting where outgoing voice mail can be sent to many phone numbers at once, in order to alert people to a local emergency such as a chemical spill.

In Canada and the United States, the county or a large city usually handles this responsibility, and its PSAP is sometimes called a radio room. As a division of a U.S. state, counties are generally bound to provide this and other emergency services even within the municipalities, unless the municipality chooses to opt out and have its own system, sometimes along with a neighboring jurisdiction. If a city operates its own PSAP, but not its own particular emergency service (for example, city police but county fire), it may be necessary to relay the call to the PSAP that does handle that type of call. The U.S. requires caller location capability on the part of all phone companies, including mobile ones, but there is no federal law requiring PSAPs to be able to receive such information.
There are 5,748 primary and secondary PSAPs in the U.S. as of February 2021 Personnel working for PSAPs can become voting members of the National Emergency Number Association (NENA). Emergency dispatchers working in PSAPs can become certified with the National Academies of Emergency Dispatch (NAED), and a PSAP can become an IAED Accredited Center of Excellence.

Each PSAP has a &#x27;real&#x27; telephone number that is called when the emergency number (911) is dialed. The telecommunications operator is responsible for associating all landline numbers with the most applicable (often the nearest) PSAP, so that when emergency number is dialed, the call is automatically routed to the most suitable PSAP. PSAPs can be subject to changes including new contact information and changing coverage area. Commercial products exist that purport to keep pace with these changes and allow the telecommunications operator to associate numbers with the relevant PSAP based upon their physical address associated with that number.

In other countries, this is the responsibility of other types of local government, and the particular setup of the telephone network dictates how such calls are handled.

There is also now the ability to answer text messages at some PSAPs, which is useful in areas where weak signal strength due to distance from the nearest cell site causes fringe reception, resulting in blocked or dropped calls. Since SMS messages only require an instant to send, a brief peak in radio propagation (such as a sudden favourable shift in multipath phase alignment) is often enough to get a message sent. Text messages are also useful for the deaf or speech disabled, as it does not require a TTY device.

== NENA i3 Solution ==
The National Emergency Number Association (NENA) long-term solution for emergency calling, referred to as the i3 Solution, assumes end-to-end Internet Protocol (IP) signaling from the Voice over IP (VoIP) endpoint to an IP-enabled Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP), with callback and caller location information provided to the PSAP with the call. While the i3 Solution assumes end-to-end IP connectivity, and it is expected that an increasing number of PSAPs will evolve to support i3 functionality over time, legacy PSAPs must continue to be supported as originating networks and the Emergency Services infrastructure migrate toward IP.

=== Legacy PSAP Gateway ===
The Legacy PSAP Gateway is a functional element of the i3 Solution architecture that supports the interconnection of the i3 ESInet with legacy PSAPs. The Legacy PSAP Gateway is expected to provide interworking and other functionality necessary for emergency calls routed via an i3 Emergency Services IP Network (ESInet) to be delivered to and handled by legacy PSAPs without requiring changes to legacy PSAP Customer Premises Equipment (CPE). Calls routed via an i3 ESInet and delivered to a legacy PSAP must undergo signaling interworking (i.e., at the Legacy PSAP Gateway) to convert the incoming IP-based (i.e., Session Initiation Protocol [SIP]) signaling supported by the ESInet to the traditional Multi-Frequency (MF) or Enhanced Multi-Frequency (E-MF) signaling supported by the legacy PSAP. Functionality must also be applied by the Legacy PSAP Gateway to emergency call originations to allow the legacy PSAP to experience call delivery, Automatic Location Identification (ALI) data retrieval, and feature activation the same way as they do today.

The Legacy PSAP Gateway must also support an ALI interface over which it can receive and respond to ALI queries from legacy PSAPs. Interfaces to a Location Information Server (LIS) and a Legacy Network Gateway must also be supported by the Legacy PSAP Gateway so that it can perform a de-referencing operation if the SIP signaling from the ESInet includes a location-by-reference. In addition, the Legacy PSAP Gateway must support an interface to an Emergency Call Routing Function (ECRF) in the i3 ESInet to support certain emergency call transfer scenarios. The Legacy PSAP Gateway may also support interfaces to Call Information Databases (CIDBs) to support access to additional non-location data associated with the emergency call, if a reference to such data is provided in incoming SIP signaling.

Telcordia GR-3166, &quot;Legacy Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) Gateway Generic Requirements&quot;, addresses the external signaling interfaces that must be supported by the Legacy PSAP Gateway, including a SIP interface over which emergency calls will be delivered to it via the i3 ESInet, and traditional MF and/or E-MF interfaces to legacy PSAPs for call delivery.

<doc id="1015217" wikidata="Q1351561" url="?curid=1015217" title="Jun'ichi Kanemaru">
<text>is a Japanese voice actor and singer. He joined 81 Produce in 2003. He voiced Hayato Kazami in &quot;Future GPX Cyber Formula&quot;, Ryo Akiyama in &quot;Digimon Tamers&quot; and has been the voice of Sonic the Hedgehog in the eponymous series since 1998. He came in eighth in the Seiyū Grand Prix in 1994.

==Career==
While studying child psychology, Kanemaru worked part-time at the Far East Network in Yokota Air Base, and at a department store as a studio DJ in Shinjuku. He joined in the dubbing session for &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot;. He later took part in several of Fuji TV&#x27;s Saturday evening shows such as &quot;High School! Kimengumi&quot;, &quot;Tsuide ni Tonchinkan&quot;, and &quot;Meimon! Dai San Yakyūbu&quot;. At the time, he was employed by Beniya 25-Ji and Dojinsha Production. He got his first lead role in 1991&#x27;s &quot;Future GPX Cyber Formula&quot;, where he played Hayato Kazami. He found out about it the day before the recording, when he heard an answering machine on his trip, and rushed home to read the script on the day of the recording. When he appeared in &quot;Cyber Formula&quot;, he was also working as an English tutor, and one of his students&#x27; parents leaked information about him, causing a huge commotion in the adjacent shopping district as anime fans rushed to the place where he was teaching.

During the dubbing of an American television sitcom &quot;Growing Pains&quot;, a SEGA official who came to look for the role of Sonic heard Kanemaru&#x27;s performance in the waiting room and cast him for the role starting from &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;. This established a role for Sonic, who could freely switch between English and Japanese, and also led to Kanemaru&#x27;s role. His performance in the &quot;Sonic&quot; series also led to offers from Disney to record children&#x27;s programs. For the live-action film adaptation for the &quot;Sonic&quot; series, Kanemaru was replaced by Taishi Nakagawa. At the time the film was released, Kanemaru took to Twitter to express his thoughts and support the crew for the film.

In an interview with Animate Times in 2016, Kanemaru recalled that &quot;Cyber Formula&quot; helped him get used to singing, as the series had monthly album releases at the time. He was the first in the voice acting industry to be allowed to cover &quot;Ue o Muite Arukō&quot; and recorded it with an a cappella chorus. On his 1993 album &quot;Inspired Colors&quot;, he also wrote and composed the song &quot;12-Gatsu no Fairy Tale&quot;, as well as English covers of &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; and Kazumasa Oda&#x27;s &quot;Love Story wa Totsuzen ni&quot; under the title &quot;suddenly&quot; (using the lyrics from Rita Coolidge&#x27;s version). He has also tried his hand at standard jazz and has performed several live shows with several fellow voice actors, and his jazz numbers mixed with English and Japanese lyrics written himself are well received by all ages.

<text>Sonia Mercedes Gisela Valcárcel Álvarez (born 26 January 1963) is a Peruvian television hostess, actress, and businesswoman. She owns and manages the Amarige Beauty Salons &amp; Spas in Lima. She is the director of women&#x27;s magazines &quot;Gisela&quot; and &quot;Amarige&quot;. She also runs her own television production company called GV Productions (&quot;El Show de los sueños (Peru)&quot;, &quot;América Hoy&quot;, &quot;El Gran Show)&quot;.

==Early life==
Valcárcel was born on 26 January 1963. She is the daughter of Jorge Valcárcel and Teresa Álvarez. She studied at &quot;Institución Educativa Teresa González de Fanning&quot;.

Valcárcel was a minor when she became pregnant with her boyfriend Jorge Pozo. Once her daughter Ethel was born, Valcárcel started working as a secretary at a car company and was hired as an extra for theater performances.

== Career ==
A she was working as a part-time receptionist on Panamerican televisión, channel 5, she publicly kissed the Venezuelan singer Oscar de León live on Peruvian television, she instantly launched her career. She started as a comic actress and a dancer (&quot;vedette&quot;) in the programs &quot;Risas y Salsa&quot; and &quot;La gran Revista&quot;.

In 1987, Panamericana Televisión proposed conducting a Peruvian version of &quot;Hello Susana&quot;, which would be named &quot;Alo Gisela&quot;. Alvarez then became the queen of daytime television on Peruvian TV for several years during the late &#x27;80s and early &#x27;90s. Her guests have been famous Latin American stars such as Chayanne, Julio Iglesias, Luis Miguel, Guillermo Dávila, Ricardo Montaner, Shakira, María Antonieta de las Nieves, Isabel Pantoja, José Luis Rodríguez, Menudo, Ricky Martin, Thalía, Paulina Rubio, Rocío Dúrcal, and Paloma San Basilio. Her TV shows were always very popular due to her interaction with the audiences, including phone conversations on TV and offering advice to the audience, especially housewives. At the same time, she founded &quot;Amarige Salon &amp; Urban Spa&quot;, a beauty parlor.

Gisela Valcárcel simultaneously hosted Saturday nighttime television shows in the late nineties and early 2000, including a local version of &quot;Big Brother&quot; named &quot;La Casa de Gisela&quot;.

Her latest project is a local version of &quot;Bailando por un sueño&quot; in franchise with Mexican TV station Televisa. In 2008, she suspended the magazine production of &quot;Gisela&quot; to work on Los Reyes de la Pista (Perú). In February 2009, she unveiled a new TV project: &quot;El Show de los Sueños&quot;, in a franchise with Televisa. In 2010, she hosted &quot;El Gran Show&quot;. In 2012, she hosted &quot;Operación Triunfo&quot;, the Peruvian version of &quot;Star Academy&quot;. However, in August she decided to return to the dance reality show &quot;El Gran Show&quot;.

Her company Espíritu y GV Producciones produced the mini series &quot;Llauca&quot; which premiered in 2021.

== Controversy ==
She was involved in a political scandal when a video of her with José Francisco Carreño Crousillat and Vladimiro Montesinos was released. The footage shows that Montesinos informed Alvareaz of measures to be taken to prevent the distribution of a book (&quot;La Señito&quot; by Carlos Vidal) that reveals intimate aspects of her life. This was denounced as an offense against public administration. A lawsuit was not filed since the judge dismissed the complaint and acquitted the parties involved of all charges.

== Personal life ==
On 10 June 1995, she married the soccer player Roberto Martínez Vera-Tudela. After some years, the couple divorced.

During the political scandal, Valcarcel also began a personal spiritual search that took her to India, where she met some religious leaders, including Sathya Sai Baba, and in the U.S. Deepak Chopra.

In 2006, after six years of romance, she married the Peruvian architect Javier Carmona. The couple separated shortly after the marriage.

She had a relationship with Jorge Pozo, with whom she had a daughter, Ethel Pozo.

==Publications==
In 2005 her autobiography, &quot;My Name is Gisela&quot;, was published by Santillana Group. In it, she gives an account of her life from childhood, including her beginnings as a star and her coming to television as hostess of the program &quot;Aló Gisela&quot;.

<doc id="1015240" wikidata="Q395307" url="?curid=1015240" title="Rollback (data management)">
<text>In database technologies, a rollback is an operation which returns the database to some previous state. Rollbacks are important for database integrity, because they mean that the database can be restored to a clean copy even after erroneous operations are performed. They are crucial for recovering from database server crashes; by rolling back any transaction which was active at the time of the crash, the database is restored to a consistent state.

The rollback feature is usually implemented with a transaction log, but can also be implemented via multiversion concurrency control.

==Cascading rollback==
A cascading rollback occurs in database systems when a transaction (T1) causes a failure and a rollback must be performed. Other transactions dependent on T1&#x27;s actions must also be rollbacked due to T1&#x27;s failure, thus causing a cascading effect. That is, one transaction&#x27;s failure causes many to fail.

Practical database recovery techniques guarantee cascadeless rollback, therefore a cascading rollback is not a desirable result. Cascading rollback is scheduled by dba.

==SQL==
SQL refers to Structured Query Language, a kind of language used to access, update and manipulate database.
In SQL, codice_1 is a command that causes all data changes since the last codice_2 or codice_3 to be discarded by the relational database management systems (RDBMS), so that the state of the data is &quot;rolled back&quot; to the way it was before those changes were made.

A codice_1 statement will also release any existing savepoints that may be in use.

In most SQL dialects, codice_1s are connection specific. This means that if two connections are made to the same database, a codice_1 made in one connection will not affect any other connections. This is vital for proper concurrency.

==Usage outside databases==
Rollbacks are not exclusive to databases: any stateful distributed system may use rollback operations to maintain consistency. Examples of distributed systems that can support rollbacks include message queues and workflow management systems. More generally, any operation that resets a system to its previous state before another operation or series of operations can be viewed as a rollback.

<doc id="1015241" wikidata="Q2170729" url="?curid=1015241" title="Kenneth S. Deffeyes">
<text>Kenneth S. Deffeyes was a geologist who worked with M. King Hubbert, the creator of the Hubbert peak theory, at the Shell Oil Company research laboratory in Houston, Texas. He claimed Chickasaw ancestry.

Deffeyes made a lively personal impression. McPhee characterized him in &quot;Basin and Range&quot; (1981): &quot;Deffeyes is a big man with a tenured waistline. His hair flies behind him like Ludwig van Beethoven. He lectures in sneakers. His voice is syllabic, elocutionary, operatic. ... His surname rhymes with &#x27;the maze.&#x27;&quot;

==Biography==
Deffeyes earned a B.S. in petroleum geology from the Colorado School of Mines and a Ph.D. in geology from Princeton University, studying under F.B. van Houten.

Deffeyes Ph.D. dissertation research concerned volcanic ashfalls in Nevada that had been altered to zeolites. Not much was known about the potential uses of zeolites, so Deffeyes wrote a review paper on zeolites in sedimentary rocks. This resulted (according to both Deffeyes and John McPhee) in the founding of the natural zeolite industry. Zeolites have important uses in water purification, as catalysts in the petrochemical industry, and as molecular sieves.

He taught at Princeton from 1967 to 1998, when he transferred to professor emeritus status.

He was the author of &quot;Hubbert&#x27;s Peak&quot;, published in 2001. In 2005 he published the book &quot;Beyond Oil: The View from Hubbert&#x27;s Peak&quot;. On February 11, 2006 Deffeyes claimed that world oil production had peaked on December 16, 2005.

==In non-fiction==
In John McPhee&#x27;s 1981 book &quot;Basin and Range&quot;, about the origin of Basin and Range topography, Deffeyes teaches geology to McPhee and his readers by analyzing road cuts and the exposed geologic strata that resulted from the construction of Interstate highway 80. On one trip, Deffeyes picks up a piece of Triassic shale near Paterson, New Jersey to demonstrate a common geologic field test: he puts the shale in his mouth and chews it. &quot;If it&#x27;s gritty, it&#x27;s a silt bed, and if it&#x27;s creamy it&#x27;s a shale,&quot; Deffeyes said. McPhee tries it and reports that he wouldn&#x27;t &quot;have thought to put it in coffee.&quot;

==Quotes==
* &quot;Crude oil is much too valuable to be burned as a fuel.&quot;
* Of world peak oil production: &quot;There is nothing plausible that could postpone the peak until 2009. Get used to it.&quot;
* &quot;The economists all think that if you show up at the cashier&#x27;s cage with enough currency, God will put more oil in ground.&quot;

<text>S8 is a line on the Berlin S-Bahn. It operates from Wildau to Birkenwerder over:
*the Görlitz line, opened in 1866 and electrified in 1929, 
*the Ring line, completed in 1877 and electrified in 1926,
*the Outer ring, completed on 22 November 1952 and electrified for the S-Bahn in 1962,
*and a short section of the Prussian Northern line, opened on 10 July 1877 and electrified on 8 August 1925.

==Service history==
The S8 was created on 2 June 1991, as a slightly shorter replacement of the Lime Green route of the East Berlin S-Bahn between Bernau bei Berlin and Grünau (via the eastern part of the Ringbahn).

==In popular culture==
An S8 train to Zeuthen appears in the opening frames of Pet Shop Boys&#x27; music video for the single &quot;Leaving&quot; from the album &quot;Elysium&quot; (2012).

<doc id="1015245" wikidata="Q16919525" url="?curid=1015245" title="NTP binding site">
<text>An NTP binding site is a type of binding site found in nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) kinases, N can be adenosine or guanosine. A P-loop is one of the structural motifs common for nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) binding sites, it interacts with the bound nucleotide&#x27;s phosphoryl groups. For the binding site to be able to bind a nucleotide, the nucleotide must be complex bound to Mg2+ or Mn2+. Nucleotide binding will cause conformational changes in the protein because the P-loop will bend.

NTP binding sites play a role in poliovirus RNA replication. On the poliovirus RNA-dependent polymerase, also known as 3Dpol, there are two binding sites. Both binding sites contain lysine residues; however, only the lysine at position 61 is essential for RNA sequence elongation as part of the replication process. Additionally, a method known as computational alanine mutagenesis, has been used to find the key portions within the amino acid sequences that majorly characterize a particular NTP binding site; these regions within the sequence are conserved.

<doc id="1015253" wikidata="Q11262637" url="?curid=1015253" title="List of works for piano left-hand and orchestra">
<text>This is a list of concertos and concertante works for piano left-hand and orchestra.

The best known left-hand concerto is the Piano Concerto for the Left Hand in D by Maurice Ravel, which was written for Paul Wittgenstein between 1929 and 1930. Wittgenstein, who lost his right arm in World War I, commissioned a number of such works around that time, as did Otakar Hollmann. More recently, Gary Graffman has commissioned a number of left-hand concertos.

==List==

==Works for the right hand only==
Works for piano right-hand only also exist, but there are far fewer of them than for left-hand only.

Concertante works involving piano right-hand include:
* Henri Cliquet-Pleyel (1894–1963) – Concerto for Piano Right Hand and Orchestra
* Arthur Bliss – Concerto for Two Pianos (3 Hands) and Orchestra, Op. 17 (1968; originally for tenor, piano, strings and percussion; then arranged for 2 pianos and orchestra for Phyllis Sellick and Cyril Smith; then arranged by Bliss and Clifford Phillips for 2 pianos 3 hands and orchestra)
* Malcolm Arnold – Concerto for Two Pianos Three Hands and Orchestra (also known as &quot;Concerto for Phyllis and Cyril&quot;), 1969. One pianist plays with both hands, the other with the right hand only.
* Gordon Jacob – Concerto for Three Hands on One Piano, 1969 (written for Sellick and Smith).

<doc id="1015255" wikidata="Q956356" url="?curid=1015255" title="Nissan Elgrand">
<text>The is a minivan manufactured by Nissan Shatai for Nissan since 1997, available in three generations, with model codes E50 (1997–2002), E51 (2002–2010), and E52 (2010–present). The E50 Elgrand was also configured and produced as a light commercial vehicle from 1998 to 2017.

The Elgrand&#x27;s main competitors are the Toyota Alphard, the Toyota Vellfire, and the Honda Odyssey.


==First generation (E50; 1997)==
The first generation of the Nissan Elgrand was produced from May 1997 to May 2002, with commercial versions remaining in production until December 2017. Various engine combinations were available including the petrol VG33E, VQ35DE and diesel QD32ETi and ZD30DDTi. The E50 had a 4 speed automatic transmission and came in either 2- or 4-wheel drive. The Caravan Elgrand was exclusive to &quot;Nissan Store&quot;, while the Homy Elgrand was exclusive to Japanese &quot;Nissan Prince Store&quot; dealerships. The Elgrand assumed the Caravan Coach&#x27;s passenger carrying duties with a luxury enhancement. The top trim level equipment packages were installed with internet enabled satellite navigation called CarWings.

===Trim levels===
The E50 version of the Elgrand came in several trim levels including: V, VG, X, XL, Highway Star, Rider, and S Edition.

===Model variations===
;Isuzu Fargo Filly
From 1997 to 2002, the E50 Elgrand was rebadged and sold by Isuzu as the Fargo Filly in the Japanese market.

On April 4, 2013, two Fargo Filly vans were subjected to recalls due to issues regarding the durability of the battery cable&#x27;s plastic band, which causes it to touch the exhaust tube when it breaks to potentially cause a short circuit. On February 19, 2016, 15 Fargo Filly vans made between January 1999 and December 2001 were subjected to recalls due to engine issues that prevent the driver from starting it.

;Nissan Paramedic and Isuzu Super Medic II
In May 1998, the second generation Nissan Paramedic ambulance was introduced on the E50 Elgrand chassis. To facilitate ambulance use, the body of the E50 Paramedic from the B pillar rearward was carried over from the Paramedic II, a high-roof ambulance version of the E24 Caravan, to increase interior space in the rear of the ambulance. The E50 Paramedic was facelifted in 2006 and remained in production until December 2017, when it was replaced by a third generation based on the E26 NV350 Caravan.

The E50 Paramedic was also marketed by Isuzu as the Super Medic II until 2002.

On April 4, 2013, 12 Fargo Filly vans were subjected to recalls due to issues regarding the durability of the battery cable&#x27;s plastic band is not durable, which causes it to touch the exhaust tube when it breaks to potentially cause a short circuit. On February 19, 2016, 15 Super Medic II vans made between January 1999 and December 2001 were subjected to recalls due to engine issues that prevent the driver from starting it.

;Elgrand Jumbo Taxi
Between 2000 and 2011, a 10-passenger commercial van based on the E50 Paramedic was offered under the Elgrand Jumbo Taxi nameplate.

=== Gallery ===


==Second generation (E51; 2002)==

The second generation E51 Elgrand was launched in May 2002 and primarily competes with the Toyota Alphard and Honda Elysion. The Jumbo Taxi and Paramedic did not move to the new platform, instead remaining on the previous E50 chassis. The E51 Elgrand is quite different from its predecessor, now equipped with power sliding doors, turn signal repeaters built into the side mirrors, a rear roof spoiler, and 16- (XL) or 17-inch (HWS) aluminum alloy wheels. The new front fascia, with a chromed grille, gives the Elgrand a sportier look. The E51 was only available through Nissan dealerships in Japan, with limited exports to Hong Kong and Brunei. The E51 is a popular grey import vehicle in Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, and New Zealand.
The E51 Elgrand uses either the 2.5l or 3.5l V6 VQ-series engine combined with a five-speed automatic transmission with Tiptronic shift for better response. Additional transmission controls include Power and Snow settings, as well as a four-wheel drive option. It employs a multilink rear suspension with ventilated disc brakes all around.

Interior features include captain-style seats, an eight-speaker sound system with an optional nine-speaker system by Bose Corp., and a TV/DVD player with a screen. The Elgrand is also equipped with an eight-inch (203mm) LCD monitor in the dashboard for the Carwings Vehicle Information System (also known as VIS). Optional extras include heated front seats, power curtains and finer levels of interior trim, such as woodgrain trim panels and a woodgrain steering wheel. The interior seating arrangement can be configured for dining by adjusting the front captain-style seats facing the back, and folding the second row of seats flat onto the seat cushions.

Like most newer models produced by Nissan, the Elgrand comes with the &quot;Keyless-go&quot; feature for enhanced user convenience. Higher spec Elgrands like the Highway Star, Rider, X, and XL versions come with an internal GPS system dedicated for use in Japan. An optional GPS system for Hong Kong and Guangdong Province in China was available. The GPS system was not a satellite-based system, but a disc-operated CarWings system that played off a concealed DVD player via tracking the position of the vehicle via wheel sensors, against an inputted start and end position of a journey with high accuracy. CD Discs were only ever created for Japan and direct export countries.

But alongside this was the innovation of reversing camera with turning guidance lines, lane control and assisted braking. In 2008 this was upadted to a four-view camera technology that provided an aerial all-round view when reversing. Other innovations including voice-activated controls, BOSE Audio or 5.1 channel surround sound audio systems, auto voice-activated phone calls, and a satellite controlled clock.

Options included cruise control, a multi-deck CD-player and BOSE all round 9-peaker stereo, as well as a TV set in the rear with a 7&quot; LCD screen. There were also several windshield options available, ranging from a standard type through to a water repellent, laser-etched, tinted screen. The water repellent screens have a holographic sticker to identify this additional option.

The model specifications were V, VG, X, and X. Later releases added the Highway Star and Rider versions. The bottom specification model was the V, whereas the top specification vehicle was the XL, with full leather interior. The 2006 refresh saw the discontinuation of the VG model.

The Rider had two variations including an Autech Tuned Nismo version.

The design of the Forum would be later used on the R42H Nissan Quest, the North American counterpart of the succeeding E52 Elgrand.

The concept was unveiled at the 2008 North American International Auto Show.

==Third generation (E52; 2010)==
The third generation E52 Elgrand, which ditched the previous generations&#x27; rear-wheel drive layout, shares a platform with the North American fourth generation R42H Quest.

The first revision of the Elgrand E52 was released in Japan on 18 August 2010. It was manufactured from August 2010 to January 2014. Across this time period there were six trim levels available. All models were available in front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive configurations with a continuously variable transmission being the only transmission option. A 250 prefix to the trim level represented a 2.5 litre inline-4 engine with 170 hp (QR25DE) while a 350 prefix to the trim level represented a 3.5 litre V6 engine with 280 hp (VQ35DE). Some models were available in both engine options while others were only available with one.
=== Safety ===
Speaking of the 2014 Quest&#x27;s small overlap front crash test,  Insurance Institute for Highway Safety  executive vice president Dave Zuby described it was one of the worst crash tests we&#x27;ve ever seen. He speculated that a person experiencing this would be lucky to ever walk normally again.

Early facelifted Autech VIP 2 and VIP 3 models include 350 Highway Star (FWD/AWD).

The E52 Elgrand now faces serious competition with the third generation Toyota Alphard and sister model, the second generation Toyota Vellfire which launched on 26 January 2015. Both Alphard and Vellfire are hard traditional competitors of the Elgrand.

===2020 facelift===
The Elgrand received its second facelift on 12 October 2020.

== Hyper Tourer Concept ==
The Hyper Tourer Concept was showcased on 23 November 2023, which was reported to preview the next-generation Elgrand.

==International markets==
There is a strong grey import market emerging for Elgrands in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Russia and previously the Philippines. Growth in these markets is mainly driven by car enthusiasts, or an unfilled need for a seven- or eight- passenger vehicle in that market. In the Philippines, first generation models were converted to left-hand drive and sold before the ban of JDM vehicles.

In Hong Kong, E50 and E51 was imported in limited numbers, while the E52 is currently mass-imported. Both generations are sold officially by Nissan dealers.

In the United Kingdom, most Elgrands are imported for resale through specialist Japanese car import agents or dealerships. There is also a growing market in self-importing Elgrands by either purchasing directly through Japanese car auctions or online dealers.

In Australia, Elgrands are popular imports and are imported from Japanese import agents and special dealerships.

In Indonesia, the third-generation Elgrand was launched at the beginning of 2011. The Elgrand for that market is equipped with the 3.5L V6 petrol engine. The 2.5L 4-cylinder model was released in September 2012.

<text>The Kanva dynasty or Kanvavamsha was a ruling dynasty of Magadha, established after Vasudeva Kanva overthrew the preceding Shunga dynasty and ruled from 73 BCE to 28 BCE.

Although the Puranic literature indicates that the Kanvas ruled from the former capital of the Shungas in Pataliputra, Magadha in Eastern India, their coins are primarily found in and around the region of Vidisha in Central India, which had also been the capital of later Shunga rulers.

The Kanva dynasty was established by Vasudeva Kanva in 73 BCE. Vasudeva was initially a minister of the Shunga Emperor Devabhuti, who then assassinated the former emperor and usurped the throne. The Kanva ruler allowed the kings of the Shunga dynasty to continue to rule in obscurity in a corner of their former dominions. There were four Kanva rulers. According to the Puranas, their dynasty was brought to an end by the Satavahanas in 28 BCE.

==Origin==
The Kanva kings were Brahmins. They were descendants of the sage Saubhari. Vasudeva Kanva killed Devabhuti of the Shunga dynasty and established the rule of the Kanva dynasty.

==Rulers==
The first ruler of the Kanva dynasty was Vasudeva after whose Gotra the dynasty was named. He was succeeded by his son Bhumimitra. Coins bearing the legend Bhumimitra have been discovered from Panchala realm. Copper coins with the legend &quot;Kanvasya&quot; have also been found from Vidisha, as well as Kaushambi in the Vatsa realm. Bhumimitra ruled for fourteen years and was later succeeded by his son Narayana. Narayana ruled for twelve years. He was succeeded by his son Susharman who was the last king of the Kanva dynasty.

==Succession==
After the defeat at the hands of Satavahanas and the fall of the Kanva dynasty, the Magadha empire came to an end. The defeat of the Kanva dynasty by the Satavahana dynasty was a localised event in Central India and numismatic and epigraphic evidence suggests that Magadha later came under the hegemony of the Mitra dynasty of Kaushambi from the 1st century BCE until the 2nd century CE.

The Puranas suggest that the last king of the Kanva dynasty was killed by Balipuccha, who founded the Andhra dynasty, but there is a lack of numismatical and archaeological evidence to support this.

<doc id="1015267" wikidata="Q1575003" url="?curid=1015267" title="Harvester (forestry)">
<text>A harvester is a type of heavy forestry vehicle employed in cut-to-length logging operations for felling, delimbing and bucking trees. A forest harvester is typically employed together with a skidder that hauls the logs to a roadside landing, or a forwarder to pick up and haul away.
== History ==
Forest harvesters were mainly developed in Sweden and Finland and today do practically all of the commercial felling in these countries. The first fully mobile timber &quot;harvester&quot;, the PIKA model 75, was introduced in 1973 by Finnish systems engineer Sakari Pinomäki and his company PIKA Forest Machines. The first single grip harvester head was introduced in the early 1980s by Swedish company SP Maskiner. Their use has become widespread throughout the rest of Northern Europe, particularly in the harvesting of plantation forests.

Before modern harvesters were developed in Finland and Sweden, two inventors from Texas developed a crude tracked unit that sheared off trees at the base up to in diameter was developed in the US called The Mammoth Tree Shears. After shearing off the tree, the operator could use his controls to cause the tree to fall either to the right or left. Unlike a harvester, it did not delimb the tree after felling it.

== Uses ==
Harvesters are employed effectively in level to moderately steep terrain for clearcutting areas of forest. For very steep hills or for removing individual trees, ground crews working with chain saws are still preferred in some countries. In northern Europe small and manoeuvrable harvesters are used for thinning operations, manual felling is typically only used in extreme conditions, where tree size exceeds the capacity of the harvester head or by small woodlot owners.

The principle aimed for in mechanised logging is &quot;no feet on the forest floor&quot;, and the harvester and forwarder allow this to be achieved. Keeping workers inside the driving cab of the machine provides a safer and more comfortable working environment for industrial scale logging.

Harvesters are built on a robust all-terrain vehicle, either wheeled, tracked, or on a walking excavator. The vehicle may be articulated to provide tight turning capability around obstacles. A diesel engine provides power for both the vehicle and the harvesting mechanism through hydraulic drive. An extensible, articulated boom, similar to that on an excavator, reaches out from the vehicle to carry the harvester head. Some harvesters are adaptations of excavators with a new harvester head, while others are purpose-built vehicles.

&quot;Combi&quot; machines are available which combine the felling capability of a harvester with the load-carrying capability of a forwarder, allowing a single operator and machine to fell, process and transport trees. These novel type of vehicles are only competitive in operations with short distances to the landing.

== Felling head ==
A typical harvester head consists of (from bottom to top, with head in vertical position)
* a chain saw to cut the tree at its base, and cut it to length. The saw is hydraulically powered, rather than using the 2-stroke engine of a portable version. It has a stronger chain and a higher power output than any saw a person can carry.
* two or more curved delimbing knives which reach around the trunk to remove branches.
* two feed rollers to grasp the tree. The wheels pivot apart to allow the harvester head to grasp the tree and pivot together to hug the tree tightly. The wheels are driven in rotation to force the cut tree stem through the delimbing knives.
* diameter sensors to calculate the volume of timber harvested in conjunction with
* a measuring wheel which measures the length of the stem as it is fed through the head.

One operator in the vehicle&#x27;s cab can control all of these functions. A control computer can simplify mechanical movements and can keep records of the length and diameter of trees cut. Length is computed by either counting the rotations of the gripping wheels or, more commonly, using the measuring wheel. Diameter is computed from the pivot angle of the gripping wheels or delimbing knives when hugging the tree. Length measurement also can be used for automated cutting of the tree into predefined lengths. Computer software can predict the volume of each stem based on analysing stems harvested previously. This information when used in conjunction with price lists for each specific log specification enables the optimisation of log recovery from the stem.

Harvesters are routinely available for cutting trees up to in diameter, built on vehicles weighing up to , with a boom reaching up to radius. Larger, heavier vehicles do more damage to the forest floor, but a longer reach helps by allowing harvesting of more trees with fewer vehicle movements.

The approximate equivalent type of vehicle in full-tree logging systems are feller-bunchers.

<text>Bristol Harbour is the harbour in the city of Bristol, England. The harbour covers an area of . It is the former natural tidal river Avon through the city but was made into its current form in 1809 when the tide was prevented from going out permanently. A tidal by-pass was dug for 2 miles through the fields of Bedminster for the river, known as the &quot;River Avon New Cut&quot;, &quot;New Cut&quot;, or simply &quot;The Cut&quot;. It is often called the Floating Harbour as the water level remains constant and it is not affected by the state of the tide on the river in the Avon Gorge, The New Cut or the natural river southeast of Temple Meads to its source.

Netham Lock at the east end of the 1809 Feeder Canal is the upstream limit of the floating harbour. Beyond the lock is a junction: on one arm the navigable River Avon continues upstream to Bath, and on the other arm is the tidal natural River Avon. The first of the floating harbour, downstream from Netham Lock to Totterdown Basin, is an artificial canal known as the Feeder Canal, while the tidal River Avon follows its original route. Downstream of Totterdown Basin, the floating harbour occupies the former natural course of the River Avon, whilst the tidal River Avon flows through an artificial channel known as the New Cut. This separation of the floating harbour and the tidal River Avon allows boats in the harbour to remain floating at low tide, reduces currents and silting and prevents flooding.

Between Bristol Temple Meads railway station and Hotwells, the harbour and the River Avon run parallel at a distance of no more than apart. Downstream of Bristol Temple Meads railway station, the floating harbour meanders through Bristol city centre, Canon&#x27;s Marsh and Hotwells. At Hotwells, the floating harbour rejoins the tidal River Avon, via a series of locks, and flows into the Avon Gorge.

Bristol Harbour was the original Port of Bristol, but as ships and their cargo have increased in size, it has now largely been replaced by docks at Avonmouth and Portbury. These are located downstream at the mouth of the River Avon.

== Sections, quays and harbourside features ==
== History of Bristol docks ==

Bristol grew up on the banks of the Rivers Avon and Frome. Since the 13th century, the rivers have been modified for use as docks including the diversion of the River Frome in the 1240s into an artificial &quot;deep channel&quot; known as &quot;Saint Augustine&#x27;s Reach&quot;, which flowed into the River Avon. Saint Augustine&#x27;s Reach became the heart of Bristol&#x27;s docks with its quays and wharfs. The River Avon within the gorge, and the River Severn into which it flows, has tides which fluctuate about between high and low water. This means that the river is easily navigable at high tide but reduced to a muddy channel at low tide in which ships would often run aground. Ships had no option but to be stranded in the harbour for unloading, giving rise to the phrase &quot;&quot; to describe how ships and their secured cargo were capable of taking the strain of repeated strandings on the mud.

As early as 1420, vessels from Bristol were regularly travelling to Iceland and it is speculated that sailors from Bristol had made landfall in the Americas before Christopher Columbus or John Cabot. After Cabot arrived in Bristol, he proposed a scheme to the king, Henry VII, in which he proposed to reach Asia by sailing west across the north Atlantic. He estimated that this would be shorter and quicker than Columbus&#x27; southerly route. The merchants of Bristol, operating under the name of the Society of Merchant Venturers, agreed to support his scheme. They had sponsored probes into the north Atlantic from the early 1480s, looking for possible trading opportunities. In 1552 Edward VI granted a Royal Charter to the Merchant Venturers to manage the port.

By 1670, the city had 6,000 tons of shipping, of which half was used for importing tobacco. By the late 17th century and early 18th century, this shipping was also playing a significant role in the slave trade.

=== Construction of the floating harbour ===
In the 18th century, the docks in Liverpool grew larger and so increased competition with Bristol for the tobacco trade. Coastal trade was also important, with the area called &quot;Welsh Back&quot; concentrating on trows with cargoes from the slate industry in Wales, stone, timber and coal. The limitations of Bristol&#x27;s docks were causing problems to business, so in 1802 William Jessop proposed installing a dam and lock at Hotwells to create the harbour. The £530,000 scheme was approved by Parliament, and construction began in May 1804. The scheme included the construction of the Cumberland Basin, a large wide stretch of the harbour in Hotwells where the Quay walls and bollards have listed building status.
The tidal new cut was constructed from Netham to Hotwells, with another dam installed at this end of the harbour. The Feeder Canal between Temple Meads and Netham provided a link to the tidal river so that boats could continue upstream to Bath. However, the new scheme required a way to equalise the levels inside and outside the Dock for the passage of vessels to and from the Avon, and bridges to cross the water. Jessop built Cumberland Basin with two entrance locks from the tidal Avon, of widths , and a junction lock between the Basin and what became known as the Floating Harbour. This arrangement provided flexibility of operation with the Basin being used as a lock when there were large numbers of arrivals and sailings. The harbour was officially opened on 1 May 1809. The first vessel built in the Floating Harbour was .

Patterson&#x27;s yard within the harbour was used for the construction of many ships notably Brunel&#x27;s in 1838 and the in 1843. They were some of the largest ships to have been built at the time, and ironically hastened the decline of the city docks by proving the feasibility of large ships. The SS &quot;Great Britain&quot; was to be towed away from her builders, to have her 1,000 hp engines and interior fitted out on the River Thames, but her beam was too big to pass through the lock. Thus the SS &quot;Great Britain&quot; was moored in the Floating Harbour until December 1844, before proceeding into Cumberland Basin after coping stones and lock gate platforms were removed from the Junction Lock. At one time there were dozens of Bristol shipyards, the largest in the harbour being Hilhouse, who became Charles Hill &amp; Sons in 1845.

=== 19th century improvements ===

The harbour cost more than anticipated and high rates were levied to repay loans, reducing any benefit the new harbour had at drawing companies back from Liverpool. In 1848 the city council bought the docks company to force down the rates. They employed Isambard Kingdom Brunel to make improvements, including new lock gates, a dredger and sluice gates designed to reduce siltation.

By the middle of the nineteenth century there was a regular steam packet passenger service to Cork, Waterford, Dublin, Tenby, Carmarthen, Haverford West, Milford Haven, Swansea, Cardiff and Newport operated by the Bristol General Steam Navigation Company from Broad Quay in St Augustine&#x27;s Reach.

By 1867, ships were getting larger and the meanders in the river Avon prevented vessels over from reaching the harbour. A scheme to install a much larger lock at Avonmouth to make the entire river a floating harbour, and to straighten the sharper bends, was dropped after work began on the much cheaper docks at Avonmouth and Portishead. The present entrance lock was designed by Thomas Howard and opened in July 1873. This has a width of and is the only entrance lock now in use at the City Docks.

From 1893 until 1934 the Clifton Rocks Railway provided a funicular railway link, inside the cliff face, from the western end of the harbour, which is close to the locks, into Clifton.

==== Railways ====
The original Bristol Harbour Railway was a joint venture by the GWR and the Bristol and Exeter Railway, opened in 1872 between Temple Meads and the Floating Harbour. Its route included a tunnel under St Mary Redcliffe church and a steam-powered bascule bridge over the entrance locks at Bathurst Basin. In 1876 the railway was extended by to Wapping Wharf. In 1906, new branches from the south via the Ashton Avenue swing bridge were built to Canons Marsh on the north side of the Floating Harbour and to Wapping via a line alongside the New Cut. A Coal Concentration Depot owned by Western Fuels was established at Wapping Wharf just behind the Industrial Museum but this closed in 1987.

==== Underfall Yard ====
The docks maintenance facility was established on the land exposed by the damming of the river to construct the harbour and remains sited at this location to the present day. William Jessop had created a weir in the dam at Underfall to allow surplus water to flow back into the New Cut; this was known as the &#x27;Overfall&#x27;. By the 1830s, the Floating Harbour was suffering from severe silting. Isambard Kingdom Brunel was, however, able to devise a solution to this problem. In place of the Overfall he advised better use of three shallow sluices and one deep scouring sluice between the harbour and the New Cut, together with a dredging vessel. This drag boat would scrape the silt away from the quay walls. When the deep sluice opened at low tide, a powerful undertow sucked the silt into the river to be carried away on the next tide. The shallow sluices enabled adjustment of the dock water level according to weather conditions.

Several old buildings, which date from the 1880s, remain at Underfall Yard and have listed building status. The octagonal brick and terracotta chimney of the hydraulic engine house dates from 1888, and is grade II* listed, as is the hydraulic engine house itself. It is built of red brick with a slate roof and contains pumping machinery, installed in 1907 by Fullerton, Hodgart and Barclay of Paisley, which powers the dock&#x27;s hydraulic system of cranes, bridges and locks. The former pattern-maker&#x27;s shop and stores date from the same period and are grade II listed, as are the Patent slip and quay walls.

==== Warehouses ====

A large number of warehouses were built around the harbour for storage and trade. Many survive today and some are being converted into apartment blocks but many have been demolished as part of the regeneration of the area.

One which has survived is the A Bond Tobacco Warehouse, which was built in 1905 and was the first of the three brick built bonded warehouses in the Cumberland Basin, and is a grade II listed building.

B Bond Warehouse dates from 1908 and was the first in Britain to use Edmond Coignet&#x27;s reinforced concrete system. It is now used by Bristol City Council and houses Bristol Archives, the CREATE Centre and council offices.

Robinson&#x27;s Warehouse built in 1874 by William Bruce Gingell, and the Granary on Welsh Back are examples of the Bristol Byzantine style with coloured brick and Moorish arches.

The Arnolfini art gallery occupies Bush House, a 19th-century Grade II* listed tea warehouse, and the Watershed Media Centre occupies another disused warehouse.

=== 20th century improvements ===

In 1908, the Royal Edward Dock was built in Avonmouth and in 1972 the large deep water Royal Portbury Dock was constructed on the opposite side of the mouth of the Avon, making the Bristol City Docks in the floating harbour redundant as a freight dock. However, the city centre docks continued to be used for smaller trading ships until the early 1970s, despite suffering significant damage to its infrastructure during the Bristol Blitz.

In 1977 Charles Hill &amp; Sons, the last shipbuilder at the Albion Yard, closed after delivering the 1,541 tonne beer tanker &quot;Miranda Guinness&quot;. Part of the yard reopened in 1980 when Abels Shipbuilders began operating. It produce a steady stream of small ferries, survey vessels, tugs and other craft before going out of business in 2006.

Amey Roadstone (formerly T R Brown and Holms Sand &amp; Gravel) sand dredgers worked from Poole&#x27;s Wharf in Hotwells until 1991. Occasionally coastal trading vessels enter the Cumberland Basin to be loaded with large steel silos manufactured by Braby Ltd at their nearby Ashton Gate works.

The old Junction Lock swing bridge is powered by water pressure from the Underfall Yard hydraulic engine house at . The new Plimsoll Bridge, completed in 1965, has a more modern electro-hydraulic system using oil at a pressure of .

==== Regeneration of the harbourside ====
Since the 1980s, millions of pounds have been spent regenerating the harbourside.
In 1999, Pero&#x27;s Bridge was constructed, linking the @Bristol exhibition with Bristol tourist attractions. In 2000, the @Bristol centre opened on semi-derelict land at Canon&#x27;s Marsh and some of the existing Grade II listed buildings were refurbished and reused. It was funded with £44.3 million from the National Lottery, the Millennium Commission, South West of England Regional Development Agency, and a further £43.4 million from Bristol City Council and commercial partners, including Nestlé. Private investors are also constructing studio apartment buildings.

The regeneration of the Canon&#x27;s Marsh area is expected to cost £240 million. Crest Nicholson were the lead developers, constructing 450 new flats, homes and waterside offices. It is being carried out under the guidance of The Harbourside Sponsors’ Group, which is a partnership between the City Council, key stakeholders, developers, businesses, operators and funders.

The Cumberland Basin &amp; Baltic Wharf are used by a variety of small boats by Baltic Wharf Sailing Club and is surrounded by tourist attractions. The old hydraulic pumping station has been converted into a pub and is a Grade II listed building.

There are two (since 2016) active boat building companies in the harbour: Bristol Classic Boat Company and the Slipway Co-operative at the Underfall Yard.

=== The harbour today ===

The harbour is now a tourist attraction with museums, galleries, exhibitions, bars and nightclubs. Former workshops and warehouses have now largely been converted or replaced by cultural venues, such as the Arnolfini art gallery, Watershed media and arts centre, M Shed museum, Antlers Gallery and the We The Curious science exhibition centre, as well as a number of fashionable apartment buildings. The Bristol Harbour Railway, operated by M Shed, runs between the museum and the CREATE Centre on some weekends and bank holidays. Historic boats are permanently berthed in the harbour. These include Isambard Kingdom Brunel&#x27;s , which was the first iron-hulled and propeller-driven ocean liner; and a replica of the &quot;Matthew&quot;, in which John Cabot sailed to North America in 1497. The historic vessels of M Shed museum, which include the steam tug &quot;Mayflower&quot;, firefloat &quot;Pyronaut&quot; and motor tug &quot;John King&quot;, are periodically operated.

Bristol Ferry Boats and Number Seven Boat Trips operate ferry services along the harbour from near Temple Meads station to the Underfall Yard, serving landing stages in the city centre and close to most of the harbour-side attractions. A separate cross-harbour ferry carries pedestrians from the ferry landing at the &quot;Great Britain&quot; to the new harbour inlet opposite. Bristol Packet Boat Trips offer regular harbour tours with commentaries and river cruises on the &quot;Tower Belle&quot; up the River Avon to Conham, Hanham and Bath and downstream to Avonmouth.

In late July each year, the Bristol Harbour Festival is held, resulting in an influx of boats, including tall ships, Royal Navy vessels and lifeboats. There is a bylaw that prohibit swimming in the docks, with a fine of up to £1,000 for infringement.

== Events ==

Bristol Harbour hosts the Bristol Harbour Festival in July of each year, attended by tall ships and hundreds of ships and boats of all kinds. About 200,000 visitors view the boats, and watch live music, street performances and other entertainments.

In 1996, the harbour was the setting for the first International Festival of the Sea. A larger version of the annual harbour festivals, this was attended by many tall ships, including the &quot;Eye of the Wind&quot;, &quot;Pride of Baltimore&quot;, &quot;Rose&quot;, &quot;Kaskelot&quot; and &quot;Earl of Pembroke&quot;. The key theme was John Cabot&#x27;s pioneering voyage of discovery to the Americas and a replica of Cabot&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Matthew&quot;, was dedicated prior to its reenactment of Cabot&#x27;s voyage the following year. In 2009, the 200th anniversary of the Floating Harbour was commemorated with a series of celebratory events.

In June 2020, the statue of Bristol slave trader Edward Colston was pushed into the harbour by protestors, after being pulled down from its plinth, jumped upon and daubed in paint.

<doc id="1015270" wikidata="Q117967" url="?curid=1015270" title="Photius (Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus')">
<text>Metropolitan Photius of Kiev () (died July 2 or February 7, 1431), was the Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus&#x27; in the Patriachate of Constantinople of the Eastern Orthodox Church. He was of Greek descent.

== Early life ==
Photius was born in the town of Monemvasia (Despotate of Morea, Byzantine Empire), located on an island near the southeastern tip of the Peloponnese peninsula. He became a monk in his youth. From 1397 he served with Metropolitan Akakios of Monemvasia.

== Career ==
On 1 September 1408, Patriarch Matthew I of Constantinople consecrated him in Constantinople as Metropolitan of Kiev and All Rus&#x27;. He was given the right to rule the whole metropolis excluding the Metropolis of Halych. By that time, only two of the five dioceses remained in Halych. On 1 September 1409, Photius arrived in Kyiv, and by Easter (April 22, 1410) - in Moscow.

North-eastern Rus&#x27;, including the Metropolitan region, was devastated by the invasion of Khan Edigu in 1408, resulting in famine and pestilence. Photius found his metropolitan residence ravaged and that the ecclesiastic treasury was empty. Everything seemed to be in chaos and he didn&#x27;t know a single word of Russian. Photius made efforts to restore the church economy and the finances of the metropolis, turning to the Grand Duke of Moscow — Vasily I — for help. The metropolitan was concerned about the state of church discipline and morality. Numerous letters were written to him (mostly dated 1410-1420s).

In 1414, Vytautas, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, attempted to re-establish the Metropolis of Lithuania. He arranged for a synod of bishops to elect Gregory Tsamblak as the Metropolitan of Lithuania. The consecration took place without the consent of Patriarch Euthymius II of Constantinople who deposed and anathematized him and who confirmed the same in letters to Photius, Emperor Manuel II Palaeologos and Grand Prince Vasily I. After Gregory’s death in the winter of 1419–1420, Photius made peace with Vytautas. As a result, the entire metropolis, including Halych, was unified under Photius until his death in 1431.

== Veneration ==
He was canonized in 2009 by including his name in the Synaxis of all saints of Moscow.

=== Feast Day ===
* 27 May – commemoration of uncovering and translation his relics in 1472 by Philip I, tenable, until the new Dormition Cathedral in Moscow was built in 1479 (He was moved with: Theognostus, Cyprian, Jonah)
* 2 July – commemoration of his death anniversary, the placing of the Honorable Robe of the Most Holy Theotokos at Blachernae
* 16 September – commemoration with Saint Cyprian, this celebration was included in the Menologium on November 22, 2017 with the blessing of Patriarch Kirill of Moscow

=== Fixed Feast Day (Synaxes) ===

* 25 May – Synaxis of Saints of Volhynia (ROCOR and Greek Orthodox Church)
* 15 July – Synaxis of All Saints of Kiev (ROC)
* 5 October – Synaxis of the Hierarchs of Moscow (ROC). He was added with Theognostus, Cyprian, Gerontius and Joasaph on March 6, 2017 with the blessing of Patriarch Kirill of Moscow.
* 10 October – Synaxis of Saints of Volhynia (ROC)

=== Moveable Feast Day (Synaxes) ===

Троице сосуд явися честный/ твоим житием, святителю Фотие,/ всегда зряй Святую Троицу, Ейже предстоиши,// молися всегда непрестанно о всех нас.

Troitse sosud yavisya chestnyy/ tvoim zhitiem, svyatitelyu Fotie,/ vsegda zryay Svyatuyu Troitsu, Yeyzhe predstoishi,// molisya vsegda neprestanno o vsekh nas.

<doc id="1015271" wikidata="Q2715163" url="?curid=1015271" title="Chronicon Lethrense">
<text> (Danish: English: &quot;Chronicle of Lejre/Leire&quot;) is a small Danish medieval work from the late 12th century, written in Latin.

==Themes==
Unlike &quot;Chronicon Roskildense&quot;, which deals primarily with information presented as real historical facts after the introduction of Christianity in Denmark, is a recording of folklore about the old pre-Christian Danish kings and the adventure stories that were eventually associated with them. In that sense it is not much different from the first part of Sven Aggesen&#x27;s &quot;Brevis Historia Regum Dacie&quot; or Saxo Grammaticus&#x27; &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, though considerably smaller and of much lesser quality. It is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Lejre.&quot;

One of the noted aspects of is the writer&#x27;s deep hatred of all things German, which at times takes on epic proportions. This German hatred can also be traced, although to a lesser degree, in Aggesen&#x27;s &quot;Brevis Historia Regum Dacie&quot;, and to a much lesser degree in Saxo&#x27;s &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;. The second book of Saxo&#x27;s &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, starting at Halfdan Scylding, through the fourth book, the reign of Dan II, is based on the genealogy of the Chronicon, though substantial additional mythical material has been used.

The original version of is certainly a work of its own. Its stories are interesting and over time copies found its way to other places; there was a copy in the 13th-century Latin Annals of the Cathedral of Lund. Because of this, is often connected to &quot;Annales Lundenses&quot;, of which it is now a part, but it is unlikely the chronicle was originally included in this anthology.

==History==
The chronicle is believed to have been composed in the second half of the 12th century, probably around 1170, or according to more recent scholarship, in the early 1190s, and preceded the writing of the far more famous and verbose &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; by &quot;Saxo&quot;, with which it shares many traditions not found in other sources. The was one of Saxo&#x27;s many sources. 

The , as included in the &quot;Annales Lundenses&quot;, supplied material for several other chronicles, such as the conscise &quot;Annales Ryenses&quot; (around 1290), the &quot;Compendium Saxonum&quot; (1340s) and the &quot;Gesta Danorum på danskæ&quot; (round 1300, not to be confused with Saxo&#x27;s work of the same title).

Swedish translations from the 14th century, suggest that the original might have been more extensive than the texts that have been preserved.

==Authorship==
Although the author is unknown, there is some conjecture that he may have been a clerk tightly linked to the Roskilde Cathedral. This is based on the great interest the author has in the city of Roskilde, which he describes in vivid detail, chronicling how it got its name and promising immortality to the city through his writing.

<text>USS &quot;Corsair&quot; (SS-435), a &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the California rockfish, or a pirate or privateer, especially Turkish or Saracen.

Her keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 3 May 1946 sponsored by Mrs. O. M. Hustvedt, commissioned on 8 November 1946 and reported to the Atlantic Fleet.

Following a shakedown cruise in which she visited Havana, Panama, Trinidad, and Rio de Janeiro, &quot;Corsair&quot; was assigned to Submarine Squadron 8 and operated out of New London, Connecticut, on type training and provided services to ships of other types until June 1947 when she entered the Electric Boat Company yard for the installation of a new type of sound gear. On 31 July 1947 she sank the old minesweeper &quot;Chewink&quot; in a torpedo experiment.

From 15 November 1947 &quot;Corsair&quot; provided services to the Submarine School at New London, cruising to the Caribbean Sea several times, until April 1949 when she was assigned to Submarine Development Group 2. She sailed from New London 18 July with the rest of her group on a cruise which took them to Northern Ireland, Portsmouth in the United Kingdom, and Arctic waters. One of her group, , was lost 26 August from a battery explosion and fire. All but one of the Cochino&#x27;s crew and six from the Tusk, who were lost in an attempt to bring medical supplies to the stricken Cochino, were rescued by exhibiting brilliant seamanship in the midst of a violent Arctic storm. The group raced through the storm to land two of the crew at Saint John, New Brunswick, for emergency medical care. &quot;Corsair&quot; returned to New London on 15 September to continue local operations with the development group. Their duties included providing services to the sound laboratory at Portsmouth, and participating in large-scale submarine exercises, including another in northern waters from 27 October to 24 November 1952 during which they visited Reykjavík, Iceland.

&quot;Corsair&quot; was detached from the development group, in March 1954, and went into a &quot;reduced complement&quot; status. Continuing to operate out of New London, she provided services to the Submarine School; Commander, Destroyers, Atlantic; and Commander, Air, Atlantic. She also conducted reserve training cruises, participated in Caribbean exercises, and operated with the Fleet Training Group at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba. In the summer of 1959, she joined in Operation &quot;Inland Seas,&quot; passing through the St. Lawrence Seaway to join in ceremonies dedicating the new waterway and to visit Great Lakes ports. While on the Great Lakes cruise, the Corsair earned the rarest Navy certificate, the &quot;Grand Order of Muskies&quot;, which can only be earned by submariners who have submerged in all 5 Great Lakes. She returned to operations from New London. &quot;Corsair&quot; made one last cruise to the Med in 1962.

&quot;Corsair&quot; was decommissioned on 1 February 1963 and scrapped later that year. Her name plate is on display at the Freedom Park.

<doc id="1015276" wikidata="Q900925" url="?curid=1015276" title="Shoe size">
<text>A shoe size is an indication of the fitting size of a shoe for a person.

There are a number of different shoe-size systems used worldwide. While all shoe sizes use a number to indicate the length of the shoe, they differ in exactly what they measure, what unit of measurement they use, and where the size 0 (or 1) is positioned. Some systems also indicate the shoe width, sometimes also as a number, but in many cases by one or more letters. Some regions use different shoe-size systems for different types of shoes (e.g. men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s, children&#x27;s, sport, and safety shoes). This article sets out several complexities in the definition of shoe sizes. In practice, shoes are often tried on for both size and fit before they are purchased.

==Deriving the shoe size==
===Foot versus shoe and last===
The length of a person&#x27;s foot is commonly defined as the distance between two parallel lines that are perpendicular to the foot and in contact with the most prominent toe and the most prominent part of the heel. Foot length is measured with the subject standing barefoot and the weight of the body equally distributed between both feet.

The sizes of the left and right feet are often slightly different. In this case, both feet are measured, and purchasers of mass-produced shoes are advised to purchase a shoe size based on the larger foot, as most retailers do not sell pairs of shoes in non-matching sizes.

Each size of shoe is considered suitable for a small interval of foot lengths, typically limited by half-point of the shoe size system.

A shoe-size system can refer to three characteristic lengths:
* The median length of feet for which a shoe is suitable. For customers, this measure has the advantage of being directly related to their body measures. It applies equally to any type, form, or material of shoe. However, this measure is less popular with manufacturers, because it requires them to test carefully for each new shoe model, for which range of foot sizes it is recommendable. It puts on the manufacturer the burden of ensuring that the shoe will fit a foot of a given length.
* The length of the inner cavity of the shoe. This measure has the advantage that it can be measured easily on the finished product. However, it will vary with manufacturing tolerances and only gives the customer very crude information about the range of foot sizes for which the shoe is suitable.
* The length of the &quot;last&quot;, the foot-shaped template over which the shoe is manufactured. This measure is the easiest one for the manufacturer to use, because it identifies only the tool used to produce the shoe. It makes no promise about manufacturing tolerances or for what size of foot the shoe is actually suitable. It leaves all responsibility and risk of choosing the correct size with the customer. Further, the last can be measured in several different ways, resulting in different measurements. 

All these measures differ substantially from one another for the same shoe. For example, the inner cavity of a shoe must typically be 15 mm longer than the foot, and the shoe last would be 2 size points larger than the foot, but this varies between different types of shoes and the shoe size system used. The typical range lies between for the UK/US size system and for the European size system, but may extend to and .

===Length===
Sizing systems also differ in the units of measurement they use. This also results in different increments between shoe sizes, because usually only &quot;full&quot; or &quot;half&quot; sizes are made.

The following length units are commonly used today to define shoe-size systems:

* The Paris point equates to . Whole sizes are incremented by 1 Paris point; this corresponds to between half sizes. This unit is commonly used in Continental Europe, and Russia and former USSR countries.
* The barleycorn is an old English unit that equates to . This is the basis for current UK and North American shoe sizes. &quot;Today in America, the sizing generally adheres relatively closely to a formula of 3 times the length of the foot in inches (the barleycorn length), less a constant (22 for men and 21 for women). In the UK, shoe sizes follow a similar method of computation, except that the constant is 23, and it is the same for men and women&quot;.

* Metric measurements in millimetres (mm) or centimetres (cm), with intervals of 5 mm and 7.5 mm are used in the international Mondopoint system (USSR/Russia and East Asia).

Since the early 2000s, labels on sports shoes typically include sizes measured in all four systems: EU, UK, US, and Mondopoint.

===Zero point===
The sizing systems also place size 0 (or 1) at different locations:

* Size 0 as a foot&#x27;s length of 0. The shoe size is directly proportional to the length of the foot in the chosen unit of measurement. Sizes of children&#x27;s, men&#x27;s, and women&#x27;s shoes, as well as sizes of different types of shoes, can be compared directly. This is used with the Mondopoint system (USSR/Russia and East Asia).
* Size 0 as the length of the shoe&#x27;s inner cavity of 0. The shoe size is then directly proportional to the inner length of the shoe. This is used with systems that also take the measurement from the shoe. While sizes of children&#x27;s, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s shoes can be compared directly, this is not necessarily true for different types of shoes that require a different amount of &quot;wiggle room&quot; in the toe box. This is used with the Continental European system.
* Size 0 (or 1) can just be simply a shoe of a given length. Typically, this will be the shortest length deemed practical; but this can be different for children&#x27;s, teenagers&#x27;, men&#x27;s, and women&#x27;s shoes - making it difficult to compare sizes. In America, the baseline for women&#x27;s shoes is seven inches and for men&#x27;s it is 7 in.; in the UK, the baseline for both is 7 in.

===Width===
Some systems also include the width of a foot (or the girth of a shoe last), but do so in a variety of ways:
* Measured foot width in millimetres (mm) - this is done with the Mondopoint system. 
* Measured width as a letter (or combination of letters), which is taken from a table (indexed to length and width/girth) or just assigned on an ad-hoc basis. Examples are (each starting with the narrowest width):
** AAA, AA, A, B, C, D, E, EE, EEE is the typical North American system and follows the brannock device standards, per the system B is narrow, C is regular, D is medium, E is wide, EE is extra wide and so on. The unlettered D size is the norm for men and B for women.
** 4A, 3A, 2A, A, B, C, D, E, 2E, 3E, 4E, 5E, 6E (variant North American).
** C, D, E, F, G, H (common UK; &quot;medium&quot; is usually F but varies by manufacturer—makers Edward Green and Crockett &amp; Jones, among others, use E instead, but one maker&#x27;s E is not necessarily the same size as another&#x27;s).
** N (&quot;narrow&quot;), M (&quot;medium&quot;) or R (&quot;regular&quot;), W (&quot;wide&quot;), XW (extra wide).
** For children&#x27;s sizes in North America, typical letters used are M or B (medium), W or D (wide), EW or 2E (extra wide). 

The width for which these sizes are suitable can vary significantly between manufacturers. The A–E width indicators used by most American, Canadian, and some British shoe manufacturers are typically based on the width of the foot, and common step sizes are inch (4.8 mm).
=== Difficulties ===
There could be differences between various shoe size tables from shoemakers and shoe stores. They are usually due to the following factors:

* Different methods of measuring the shoes, different manufacturing processes, or different allowances even when the same system is used.
* An indication in centimetres or inches can mean the length of the foot or the length of the shoe&#x27;s inner cavity. 
* Differing amounts of wiggle room required for different sizes of shoes.
* For wide feet, a shoe several sizes larger (and actually too long) may be required and may also result in inconsistent size indications when different typical widths are attributed to specific shoe sizing systems.
* Some tables for children take future growth into account. The shoe size is then larger than what would correspond to the actual length of the foot.

Conversion tables available on the Web often contain obvious errors, not taking into account different zero points or wiggle room. 

Although shoe size systems are not fully standardised, the ISO/TC 137 had released a technical specification ISO/TS 19407:2015 for converting shoe sizes across various local sizing systems. Even though the problem of converting shoe sizes accurately has yet to be fully resolved, this standard serves as &quot;a good compromise solution&quot; for shoe-buyers.

==Common sizing systems==

===United Kingdom ===
Shoe size in the United Kingdom, Ireland, India, Pakistan and South Africa is based on the length of the last used to make the shoes, measured in barleycorns ( inch) starting from the smallest size deemed practical, which is called size zero. It is not formally standardised. The last is typically longer than the foot heel to toe length by to in or to 2 barleycorns, so to determine the shoe size based on actual foot length one must add 2 barleycorns.

A child&#x27;s size zero is equivalent to 4 inches (a hand = 12 barleycorns = 10.16 cm), and the sizes go up to size (measuring barleycorns, or ). Thus, the calculation for a children&#x27;s shoe size in the UK is:
equivalent to:

An adult size one is then the next size up (26 barleycorns, or ) and each size up continues the progression in barleycorns. The calculation for an adult shoe size in the UK is thus:
equivalent to:
Although this sizing standard is nominally for both men and women, some manufacturers use different numbering for women&#x27;s UK sizing.

In Australia and New Zealand, the UK system is followed for men and children&#x27;s footwear. Women&#x27;s footwear follows the US sizings.

In Mexico, shoes are sized either according to the foot length they are intended to fit, in cm, or alternatively to another variation of the barleycorn system, with sizes calculated approximately as:
equivalent to:

=== United States ===
In the United States and Canada, the traditional system is similar to the British system but there are different zero points for children&#x27;s, men&#x27;s, and women&#x27;s shoe sizes. The most common is the customary system where men&#x27;s shoes are one size longer than the UK equivalent, making a men&#x27;s 13 in the US the same size as a men&#x27;s 12 in the UK.

====Customary====
The customary system is offset by barleycorn, or , comparing to the UK sizes. The men&#x27;s range starts at size 1, with zero point corresponding to the children&#x27;s size 13 which equals barleycorns or . 

However, most US manufacturers are using greater offsets, such as and 1 barleycorns. Therefore in current practice, US men&#x27;s size 1 equals 25 barleycorns, or , so the calculation for a male shoe size in the United States is:
equivalent to:

In the &quot;standard&quot; or &quot;FIA&quot; (Footwear Industries of America) scale, women&#x27;s sizes are men&#x27;s sizes plus 1 (so a men&#x27;s is a women&#x27;s ):
equivalent to:

There is also the &quot;common&quot; scale, where women&#x27;s sizes are equal to men&#x27;s sizes plus .

Children&#x27;s shoes start from size zero, which is equivalent to inches ( barleycorns = 99.48 mm), and end at . Thus the formula for children&#x27;s sizes in the US is 
equivalent to:

Alternatively, a Mondopoint-based scale running from K4 to K13 and then 1 to 7 is in use. K4 to K9 are toddler sizes, K10 to K13 are pre-school and 1 to 7 are grade school sizes.

====Brannock Device====

The Brannock Device is a measuring instrument invented by Charles F. Brannock in 1925 found in many shoe stores. The recent formula used by the Brannock device assumes a foot length of 2 barleycorns less than the length of the last; thus, men&#x27;s size 1 is equivalent to a last&#x27;s length of and foot&#x27;s length of , and children&#x27;s size 1 is equivalent to last&#x27;s length and foot&#x27;s length.

The device also measures the length of the arch, or the distance between the heel and the ball (metatarsal head) of the foot. For this measurement, the device has a shorter scale at the instep of the foot with an indicator that slides into position. If this scale indicates a larger size, it is taken in place of the foot&#x27;s length to ensure proper fitting.

For children&#x27;s sizes, additional wiggle room is added to allow for growth.

The device also measures the width of the foot and assigns it designations of AAA, AA, A, B, C, D, E, EE, or EEE. The widths are  inches apart and differ by shoe length.

Some shoe stores and medical professionals use optical 3D surface scanners to precisely measure the length and width of both feet and recommend the appropriate shoe model and size.

===Continental Europe===
In the Continental European system, the shoe size is the length of the last, expressed in Paris points or , for both sexes and for adults and children alike. The last is typically longer than the foot heel to toe length by to , or 2 to Paris points, so to determine the shoe size based on actual foot length one must add 2 Paris points.

Because a Paris point is of a centimetre, a centimetre is Paris points, and the formula is as follows:
equivalent to:

The Continental European system is used in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and most other continental European countries. It is also used in Middle Eastern countries (such as Iran), Brazil—which uses the same method but subtracts 2 from the final result, in effect measuring foot size instead of last size—and, commonly, Hong Kong. The system is sometimes described as Stich size (from &quot;Pariser Stich&quot;, the German name for the Paris point), or &quot;&quot; size (from a German name of a micrometer for internal measurements).

=== Mondopoint ===

The Mondopoint shoe length system is widely used in the sports industry to size athletic shoes, ski boots, skates, and pointe ballet shoes; it was also adopted as the primary shoe sizing system in the Soviet Union, Russia, East Germany, China, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, and as an optional system in the United Kingdom, India, Mexico, and European countries. The Mondopoint system is also used by NATO and other military services.

The Mondopoint system was introduced in the 1970s by International Standard ISO 2816:1973 &quot;Fundamental characteristics of a system of shoe sizing to be known as Mondopoint&quot; and ISO 3355:1975 &quot;Shoe sizes – System of length grading (for use in the Mondopoint system)&quot;. ISO 9407:2019, &quot;Shoe sizes—Mondopoint system of sizing and marking&quot;, is the current version of the standard.

The Mondopoint system is based on average foot length and foot width for which the shoe is suitable, measured in millimetres. The length of the foot is measured as horizontal distance between the perpendiculars in contact with the end of the most prominent toe and the most prominent part of the heel. The width of the foot is measured as horizontal distance between vertical lines in contact with the first and fifth metatarsophalangeal joints. The perimeter of the foot is the length of the foot circumference, measured with a flexible tape at the same points as foot width. The origin of the grade is zero.

The labeling typically includes foot length, followed by an optional foot width: a shoe size of 280/110 indicates a foot length of and width of . Other customary markings, such as EU, UK and US sizes, may also be used.

Because Mondopoint takes the foot width into account, it allows for better fitting than most other systems. A given shoe size shall fit every foot with indicated average measurements, and those differing by no more than a half-step of the corresponding interval grid. Standard foot lengths are defined with interval steps of 5 mm for casual footwear and steps of 7.5 mm for specialty (protective) footwear. The standard is maintained by ISO Technical Committee 137 &quot;Footwear sizing designations and marking systems.&quot;

==== East Asia ====
In Japan, mainland China, Taiwan, and South Korea, the Mondopoint system is used as defined by national standard Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS) S 5037:1998 and its counterparts Guobiao (GB/T) 3293.1-1998, Chinese National Standard (CNS) 4800-S1093:2000 and Korean Standards Association (KS) M 6681:2007.

Foot length and girth (foot circumference) are taken into account. The foot length is indicated in centimetres; an increment of 5 mm is used.

The length is followed by designators for girth (A, B, C, D, E, EE, EEE, EEEE, F, G), which are specified in an indexed table as foot circumference in millimetres for each given foot length; foot width is also included as supplemental information. There are different tables for men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s, and children&#x27;s (less than 12 years of age) shoes. Not all designators are used for all genders and in all countries. For example, the largest girth for women in Taiwan is EEEE, whereas in Japan, it is F.

The foot length and width can also be indicated in millimetres, separated by a slash or a hyphen.

==== Soviet Union (Russia, Commonwealth of Independent States) ====
Historically the Soviet Union used the European (Paris point) system, but the Mondopoint metric system was introduced in the 1980s by GOST 24382-80 &quot;Sizes of Sport Shoes&quot; (based on ISO 2816:1973) and GOST 11373-88 &quot;Shoe Sizes&quot; (based on ISO 3355:1975), and lately by GOST R 58149-2018 (based on ISO 9407:1991)

Standard metric foot sizes can be converted to the nearest Paris point ( cm) sizes using approximate conversion tables; shoes are marked with both foot length in millimetres, as for pointe ballet shoe sizes, and last length in European Paris point sizes (although such converted &quot;Stichmaß&quot; sizes may come to 1 size smaller than comparable European-made adult footwear, and up to sizes smaller for children&#x27;s footwear, according to ISO 19407 shoe size definitions). Foot lengths are aligned to 5 mm intervals for sports and casual shoes, and 7.5 mm for protective/safety shoes. Optional foot width designations includes narrow, normal (medium or regular), and wide grades.

Infant sizes start at 16 (95 mm) and pre-school kids at 23 (140 mm); schoolchildren sizes span 32 (202.5 mm) to 40 (255 mm) for girls and 32 to 44 (285 mm) for boys. Adult sizes span 33 (210 mm) to 44 for women and 38 (245 mm) to 48 (310 mm) for men.


== ISO 19407 and shoe size conversion ==
ISO/TS 19407:2023 &quot;Footwear - Sizing - Conversion of sizing systems&quot; is a technical specification from the International Organization for Standardization. It contains basic description and conversion tables for major shoe sizing systems including Mondopoint with length steps of 5 mm and 7.5 mm, European Paris point system, and UK -inch system. The standard has also been adopted as Russian GOST R 57425-2017.

The standard is maintained by ISO/TC 137, which also developed ISO/TS 19408:2015 &quot;Footwear - Sizing - Vocabulary and terminology&quot;; in development are companion standards ISO/TS 19409 &quot;Footwear - Sizing - Measurement of last dimensions&quot; and ISO/TS 19410 &quot;Footwear - Sizing - Inshoe measurement&quot;. 

===Shoe sizing===
The adult shoe sizes are calculated from typical last length, which is converted from foot length in millimetres by adding an allowance of two shoe sizes:

formula_1

where &quot;L&quot; is foot length in millimetres.

Direct conversion between adult UK, Continental European and Mondopoint shoe size systems is derived as follows:

formula_2

Using these formulas, the standard derives shoe size tables for adults and children, based on actual foot length measurement (insole) in millimetres. Typical last length ranges are also included (13 to 25 mm over foot length for adults, 8% greater than foot length plus 6 mm for children).

Exact foot lengths may contain repeating decimals because the formulas include division by 3; in practice, approximate interval steps of 6.67 mm and 8.47 mm are used, and sizes are rounded to either the nearest half size or closest matching Mondopoint size.



=== Size marking ===
It is recommended to include size marking in each of the four sizing systems on the shoe label and on the package. The principal system used for manufacturing the shoe needs to be placed first and emphasized with a boldface.

The standard includes quick conversion tables for adult shoe size marking; they provide matching sizes for shoes marked in Mondopoint, European, and UK systems. Converted values are rounded to a larger shoe size to increase comfort.

<doc id="1015289" wikidata="Q1210031" url="?curid=1015289" title="Dickie Moore (ice hockey)">
<text>Richard Winston Moore (January 6, 1931 – December 19, 2015) was a Canadian professional hockey player, businessman and community philanthropist. He won the Art Ross Trophy twice as the National Hockey League&#x27;s leading scorer and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Moore spent most of his career with the Montreal Canadiens and came out of retirement twice to play briefly with the Toronto Maple Leafs and St. Louis Blues. In 2017 he was named one of the &#x27;100 Greatest NHL Players&#x27; in history.

==Career==
Moore played with the Montreal Jr. Royals from 1947 to 1950. He played on two Memorial Cup winning teams, one with the Montreal Royals in 1949 and the Montreal Junior Canadiens the following year. In the late 1940s Frank Selke Sr., the general manager of the Montreal Canadiens, called him Canada&#x27;s best junior. Moore made his NHL debut with the Canadiens in the middle of the 1951–52 season. 

Moore was known for his hard accurate shot and his stickhandling. He twice won the Art Ross Trophy as the league&#x27;s leading scorer. In 1958-59 he scored 41 goals and 55 assists for 96 points, breaking Gordie Howe&#x27;s record of 95 total points in a regular season. He often played on a line with Henri Richard and Maurice Richard.

Moore won the Stanley Cup with the Canadiens for the first time in 1953 and five more times in a row from 1956 to 1960.

In 1957–58 Moore suffered a broken wrist in a collision with Detroit defenceman Marcel Pronovost which threatened to cut short a scoring championship year. Journalist Red Fisher described what happened next: 

Moore, the competitor, wanted to win the Art Ross. He had his eye on the prize, but Moore, the team man, had other ideas. One night, when the Canadiens were travelling on the train, he asked for a meeting with coach Toe Blake and his linemates, Maurice and Henri Richard. At the time, Henri was Dickie&#x27;s closest pursuer in the scoring race. Dickie told them he could still play with his wrist in a cast, but for how long? And as long as he played with an injury that would sideline most players, how much could he contribute to the line? &quot;It’s not fair to Henri,&quot; Moore told Blake. &quot;It’s not fair not to allow him to win the scoring title.&quot; The meeting lasted no more than a few minutes. It ended abruptly when Maurice and Henri told Blake: &quot;There’s no damned way he’s going off the line.&quot; Moore remained on the line. He played with his wrist imprisoned in a cast for the second half of the season. He won the Art Ross with an NHL-leading 36 goals and 48 assists in a 70-game season. Henri finished four points behind. Moore won it again in 1958–59 with 41 goals and 55 assists.

He retired following the 1962–63 season, but came back a year later to play one season for the Toronto Maple Leafs. Three years later, in 1967-68, Moore came out of retirement once more to play 45 games for the St. Louis Blues. At 37 years of age, he scored 14 points in the playoffs as the Blues made it to the Stanley Cup finals in their first season.

In 1974, Moore was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. In 1998, he was ranked number 31 on &quot;The Hockey News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players.

==Later life==
Following his retirement from hockey, Moore operated a successful equipment and tools rental business for construction in Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto.

On November 12, 2005, the Canadiens retired the uniform number 12 in honour of both Moore and Yvan Cournoyer.

On August 27, 2006, Moore suffered neck, spine, and rib injuries when his car was hit by a truck in Montreal. He was trapped in the car for 45 minutes.

He died on December 19, 2015, in Montreal at the age of 84.

==Personal==
Moore had three children: Richard, Lianne and John. In 1973, Richard died at the age of 16 in a car accident. He had been attending Malcolm Campbell High School in Montreal. The Dickie Moore Memorial Awards are presented annually in memory of former Kentville Minor Hockey player Dickie Moore Jr.

<doc id="1015296" wikidata="Q3841719" url="?curid=1015296" title="MV Kalakala">
<text>Motor Vessel &quot;Kalakala&quot; (pronounced ) was a ferry that operated on Puget Sound from 1935 until her retirement in 1967.

MV &quot;Kalakala&quot; was notable for her unique streamlined superstructure, art deco styling, and luxurious amenities. The vessel was a popular attraction for locals and tourists, and was voted second only to the Space Needle in popularity among visitors to Seattle during the 1962 Seattle World&#x27;s Fair. The ship is known as the world&#x27;s first streamlined vessel for her unique art deco styling.

After retiring from passenger service in 1967, the ship was beached in Kodiak, Alaska, and converted to a shrimp cannery. In 1998, the ship was refloated and towed to Puget Sound with the owner hoping to restore the ship. During this time, the ship continued to deteriorate, with the Coast Guard declaring the ship a hazard to navigation in 2011. Unable to raise the funds required for restoration, the ship was scrapped in 2015.

== Service ==
===&quot;Peralta&quot;===
She was constructed for the Key System&#x27;s commuter ferry service on San Francisco Bay between Oakland and San Francisco and named Peralta in honor of one of the area&#x27;s early Spanish founding families. Launched in April 1926 she was of double ended design and was powered by a steam-turbo-electric power plant.

On February 17, 1928, while docking in Oakland, Peralta&#x27;s bow sank into the water, sending waves sweeping over the deck. Five passengers were killed. The main cause of the accident was found to be the failure in properly filling ballast tanks at the rear of the ship with water to counterbalance the weight of the passengers moving en masse to the bow to disembark.

On the evening of May 6, 1933, while moored at the Oakland ferry terminal an arson fire started in the adjacent train sheds at 11 pm and spread to the &quot;Peralta&quot; whose superstructure collapsed due to the intense heat and she was written off by her insurance company.

===Rebuilding===
The still intact hull of the &quot;Peralta&quot; caught the eye of Alexander Peabody, president of the Puget Sound Navigation Company (PSNC), also known by its marketing name, the &quot;Black Ball Line&quot;. He made an offer and on October 12, 1933, the vessel was sold to the PSNC, who had the hull towed by the tug Creole to Lake Washington Shipyards in Houghton, Washington (since annexed to Kirkland) to restore the vessel as a ferry.
Over the next two years she was rebuilt. The remains of the superstructure and machinery were removed, while the beam was reduced from 68 ft to 55 ft 8 inches.

Only a single diesel engine was installed as it was intended that she would operate as a single-ender operating between Seattle and Bremerton. As the route was long, speed was considered to be important, as well as the ability to carry both passengers and motor vehicles. 
After his wife suggested that the new design should be distinctive and modernistic, Peabody decided to incorporate streamlining in the new superstructure. Louis Proctor, an engineer for the Boeing Company, provided an early concept design. The setback of the wheelhouse mimicked the setback of a cockpit behind the nose of an airplane. The flying bridge had no functional purpose but was evocative of wings, fitting with the aircraft-themed design. She was also given a modernistic art-deco interior with a full-service galley, a ladies&#x27; lounge, and a men&#x27;s bar on the lower deck and showers for dockyard workers travelling home from the naval shipyard at Bremerton.

The new electro-welding, or arc-welding, process was used instead of rivet construction, lending a seamless appearance to fit with the streamlined design. Kalakala was the first vessel on which the new technique was used. The new bridge and wheelhouse were built entirely out of copper, from fear that the steel used in the rest of the vessel would interfere with the ship&#x27;s compass.

In November 1934, William O. Thorniley, publicist for PSNC and president of the Olympic Peninsula Travel Association, named the new ferry &quot;Kalakala&quot;, which means &quot;bird&quot; in the Pacific Northwest Native American trade language Chinook Jargon. Thorniley launched a national promotional campaign beginning with large billboard signs that simply said &quot;KALAKALA!&quot; Later, they said &quot;KALAKALA, Seattle, WA&quot; and featured a picture of the vessel as well.
The name established a tradition of all vessels in the ferry fleet of the Washington State Department of Transportation (which acquired ownership of the &quot;Kalakala&quot; in 1951) bearing indigenous names.

===Service===
After festivities, &quot;Kalakala&quot; entered service on July 4, 1935, becoming famous. In addition to ferry service, she was used for &quot;moonlight cruises&quot; with a live dance orchestra.

&quot;Kalakala&quot; saw heavy service during World War II transporting shipyard workers and Navy personnel between Seattle and Bremerton on an extended schedule. Vandalism and rowdiness brought deployment of the Shore Patrol and closure of the bar. That service led to the moniker, &quot;The Workhorse of Puget Sound.&quot;

The aircraft-inspired design of &quot;Kalakala&quot; sacrificed functionality. The setback of the wheelhouse made it impossible to see the bow of the vessel, leading to difficulties when docking. The streamlined wheelhouse&#x27;s small size and round windows also made all round visibility difficult. The car deck was narrowed for the sake of form, sacrificing lane width. That led to a 40% drop in the number of vehicles that could be carried as American cars became wider in the postwar years, with a corresponding drop in economic efficiency, while making it difficult for passengers to squeeze between cars on their way to embarking and disembarking from the ferry. With the coming of the more efficient Evergreen State class boats in the mid-1950s, &quot;Kalakala&quot; became obsolete. The enclosed bow design did, however, make her suitable for open water routes such as the Port Angeles - Victoria run, where she served from 1955 to 1959.

&quot;Kalakala&quot; had a heavy shaking vibration that ran throughout the vessel when in operation. This was probably due to poor alignment of the engine during the 1930s rebuild. When the propeller was replaced with a new 5-bladed version in 1956, the vibration was reduced by 40%. Although the PSNC wished &quot;Kalakala&quot; to be known as the &quot;Silver Swan&quot;, she soon attracted other, less complimentary nicknames, including &quot;Silver Slug&quot;, &quot;Silver Beetle&quot;, &quot;Galloping Ghost of the Pacific Coast&quot;, and, among Seattle&#x27;s Scandinavian community, &quot;Kackerlacka&quot;, which means &quot;cockroach&quot;.

In February 1946, &quot;Kalakala&quot; was issued Federal Communications Commission (FCC) license #001 when she was fitted with the first commercial radar system.
&quot;Kalakala&quot; was featured transportation for tours of the Bremerton shipyards during the Seattle World&#x27;s Fair in 1962.

== Retirement ==


In 1967, &quot;Kalakala&quot; retired from service and moved to the Washington State Ferries repair facility at Eagle Harbor. A year later she was sold to a seafood processing company and towed to Alaska to work as a crab cannery at Ouzinkie, Alaska. Later the &quot;Kalakala&quot; was beached in Kodiak in 1970 and used to process shrimp.

Peter Bevis discovered the rusting hulk on a fishing trip in 1984. &quot;Kalakala&quot; was still operating as a cannery, with her internal structure having been reworked to create a building with cement floors, drywall, and ceiling tiles. After complicated financial negotiations, the ship was refloated and towed back to Seattle in 1998. The vessel became a source of controversy for the remainder of her existence as her owners were unable to raise sufficient funds to refurbish the vessel or even to keep her moored on Seattle&#x27;s Lake Union.

The vessel was sold in 2004 to a private investor, who moved her to an anchorage in Neah Bay provided by the Makah people. Soon after arriving at Neah Bay &quot;Kalakala&quot; was evicted by the Makah, who also brought a lawsuit against the owners. The vessel was then relocated to Tacoma, Washington.

In February 2008, &quot;Kalakala&quot; owner Steve Rodrigues announced his intention to acquire additional vintage ferry vessels and to restore them and the &quot;Kalakala&quot; as either ferries powered by wind and solar technologies or as museums. &quot;Kalakala&quot; was scheduled for work on her hull and superstructure in dry dock in 2010, but this never happened. After six years in Tacoma, &quot;Kalakala&quot; began listing, and officials became concerned that the ferry might pose an environmental risk. The vessel&#x27;s owner was also pressured to take action after Washington State passed a law focusing on the removal of abandoned or neglected vessels. For these reasons, &quot;Kalakala&quot;″s owner put her up for sale for a nominal fee of one dollar, contingent on the purchaser committing to renovating &quot;Kalakala&quot;.

In December 2011, the Coast Guard declared the ship a hazard to navigation. Among other issues, the Coast Guard stated that her mooring arrangements were inadequate. The Coast Guard set a December 19 deadline for the owner to repair the hull of the ship and submit a plan to tow her away from her current mooring in Tacoma. This deadline was not met. The owner, Steve Rodrigues, appealed this order, claiming that an anonymous person had purchased the ship. The Coast Guard rejected the appeal as there was no evidence that any work had been done on the ship and no evidence of the supposed sale.

The Coast Guard described the ship as being in such fragile condition that it may not withstand being moved to other moorage and might have to be scrapped. In July 2012 Steve Rodrigues sued the state of Washington claiming that the state had failed in its &quot;duty&quot; to help preserve the ferry. Rodrigues&#x27; suit asked that the state be prevented from forcing &quot;Kalakala&quot; to be moved, confiscated, or sunk and sought to force the state to pay approximately $50 million for restoration of the ferry under a proposal Rodrigues previously submitted, which was rejected. In November 2012, Karl Anderson, owner of the Hylebos Waterway uplands where the boat was moored, took possession of the vessel in exchange for the $4,000 he claimed Rodrigues owed him in back rent.

== Dismantling == 

On January 4, 2015, owner Karl Anderson announced that the &quot;Kalakala&quot; would be dismantled for scrap metal.
On January 22, the &quot;Kalakala&quot; was towed to a Tacoma dry dock and scrapping began immediately. By the first week of February scrapping was completed with only a few pieces such as windows, pilot house, and the rudder saved and sold as souvenirs.

== Artistic projects ==
Several art projects arose from fascination with &quot;Kalakala&quot;, including a full-length album of solo cello compositions recorded on board the vessel in November 2003, called &quot;Songs from a Parallel Universe&quot;. There is an as-yet unreleased film about the &quot;Ghost Dance&quot; that was filmed on &quot;Kalakala&quot;. There was also a live concert featuring the Icelandic band &quot;múm&quot;, Serena Tideman and Eyvind Kang, on board the &quot;Kalakala&quot;. The watercolorist Robert Tandecki painted her among her later days. Artist Cory Ench painted a large mural of &quot;Kalakala&quot; in downtown Port Angeles in 1995.

In 2002, it was home to the Undergraduate Degree Shows for Cornish College of the Arts Design Department.

A temporary pirate radio station broadcasting from &quot;Kalakala&quot; is featured in the 2005 documentary film &quot;Pirate Radio USA&quot;.

The city of Kirkland bought some of the scrapped pieces of &quot;Kalakala&quot; and, , is considering using them in a public art project.Several pieces of the vessel were placed in the parking lot of Salty&#x27;s on Alki in West Seattle, including a wheelhouse that faces Elliott Bay and the Seattle skyline.

Pieces of the bridge and the auxilallary engine&#x27;s crankshaft are on display at the King Agriculture Museum in Centralia, Washington.

<doc id="1015298" wikidata="Q336414" url="?curid=1015298" title="Wayland Young, 2nd Baron Kennet">
<text>Wayland Hilton Young, 2nd Baron Kennet (2 August 1923 – 7 May 2009) was a British writer and politician, notably concerned with planning and conservation. As a Labour minister, he was responsible for setting up the Department of the Environment and the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution. Later he joined the SDP. He lost his seat in the Lords following the House of Lords Act 1999.

==Early life==
Young was the son of the multi-talented politician Hilton Young, 1st Baron Kennet, and the sculptor Kathleen Scott, née Bruce, widow of Captain Robert Falcon Scott of the Antarctic. One uncle was Geoffrey Winthrop Young, the mountaineer. His half-brother was the painter and conservationist Sir Peter Scott. After West Downs School, he spent one unhappy term at Winchester College before going on to Alpine College, Stowe School and finally as an Exhibitioner at Trinity College, Cambridge. During World War II, he served in the Royal Navy from 1942 to 1945, as an Ordinary Seaman and as Sublieutenant. He then went on to the Foreign Office serving between 1946 and 1947 and 1949–1951.

In between and after, Young was a journalist – &quot;Observer&quot; correspondent in Rome and North Africa, and weekly columnist on &quot;The Guardian&quot; (&quot;Sitting on a Column&quot;), and theatre critic for &quot;Tribune&quot;. He was a frequent contributor to &quot;Encounter&quot;, where his articles were widely noticed – among them &quot;Sitting on a Fortune&quot; (about prostitution) and a review showing up many errors of fact in Roland Huntford&#x27;s book on Scott and Amundsen, which denigrated the former (ignoring the scientific character of Scott&#x27;s expedition), and presented the event as merely a &quot;race&quot; that the latter &quot;won&quot;.

Young also wrote three novels, and several pamphlets for the Fabian Society on defence, disarmament, pollution, Europe and other topics, some with his wife, Elizabeth Young. Together they also wrote a book, &quot;Old London Churches&quot; (which identified the six churches designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor as works of real genius). Young also took part in the Campaign for the Abolition of Theatre Censorship as its Secretary. His energetic interest in disarmament did not lead him to join the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament – it worked for unilateral British nuclear disarmament: he believed that only general and comprehensive disarmament could be useful and effective.

==Political career==
Young succeeded to the title of Baron Kennet, and took his seat in the House of Lords in 1960 upon the death of his father. He started his political career in the Labour Party, having joined in opposition to the Suez conflict in 1956. He served as Parliamentary Secretary (Junior Minister) in the Ministry of Housing and Local Government (under Richard Crossman, then later Anthony Greenwood) where he worked, among much else, on planning and conservation, and on devising the soon-to-be-set up Department of the Environment (Secretary of State, Tony Crosland) He was responsible for setting up the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution. According to his 1972 publication &quot;Preservation&quot; he worked on setting up the &quot;Four Towns Report&quot; and played an important role in establishing the foundations of conservation policy through the Town and Country Planning Act 1968 and his 1970 Kennet Report.
After the fall of the [first] Wilson Government in 1970, he was appointed Honorary Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and became Chairman of the Council for the Protection of Rural England, of the Advisory Committee on Pollution of the Sea (ACOPS), and various other organisations. He served as Opposition Spokesman on Foreign Affairs in the House of Lords from 1971 to 1974. He was also a member of the European Parliament, of the Western European Union, and a NATO Parliamentarian.

Kennet joined the SDP, serving as Chief Whip of the party in the House of Lords between 1981 and 1983. While in that position, he introduced a bill for the Prohibition of Female Circumcision; it passed on 16 July 1985. Following the decision by the party&#x27;s membership to merge with the Liberal Party in 1988, Kennet was one of the minority who instead opted to remain with the &quot;continuing&quot; SDP faction, led by David Owen. He returned to the Labour Party in 1990, soon after the &quot;continuing&quot; SDP folded, before leaving in opposition to Tony Blair&#x27;s foreign policy. Under the terms of the House of Lords Act 1999, he lost his automatic right to a seat; he was unsuccessful in the election by the Labour hereditary peers of two of their number to continue to sit after the coming into force of the Act, finishing last in a field of six candidates.

In 2005, he sought to return to the House in the by-election among Liberal Democrat hereditary peers caused by the death of Earl Russell; he was unsuccessful, receiving no votes.

Until late in life he remained chairman of the Stonehenge Alliance, and an active member of the Avebury Society and Action for the River Kennet (ARK).

==Personal life==
Lord Kennet married Elizabeth Ann Adams in 1948. They had a son, William Aldus (Thoby) Young, and five daughters: Easter Russell, educationalist; the sculptor Emily Young; Mopsa English, educationalist; and the writers Louisa Young (aka children&#x27;s author Zizou Corder) and Zoe Young. Emily, described as an enigmatic and modish teenager in the 1960s, was the probable inspiration for the Pink Floyd song &quot;See Emily Play&quot;.

The family homes were in Bayswater and in Wiltshire, where in 1908 Young&#x27;s father had bought The Lacket, an 18th-century thatched cottage on the edge of the village of Lockeridge, near Marlborough.

==Works==
Young published on a wide range of mostly political topics, especially on the politics of Italy, on disarmament and arms control, on the churches of London often collaborating with his wife Elizabeth Young, and on various political scandals, notably the Profumo affair and the Montesi scandal. His 1964 work &quot;Eros Denied&quot; was a groundbreaking manifesto of the sexual revolution. Young&#x27;s 1972 publication &quot;Preservation&quot; is an important insight of present UK conservation and preservation laws and policies, through the conservation struggles of the late 19th century until the 1968 Planning Act.

<doc id="1015304" wikidata="Q927431" url="?curid=1015304" title="Lucha libre">
<text>Lucha libre (, meaning &quot;freestyle wrestling&quot; or literally translated as &quot;free fight&quot;) is the term for the style of professional wrestling originating in Mexico. Since its introduction to Mexico in the early 20th century, it has developed into a unique form of the genre, characterized by colorful masks, rapid sequences of holds and maneuvers, and &quot;high-flying&quot; maneuvers, some of which have been adopted in the United States, Japan, and elsewhere. The wearing of masks has developed special significance, and matches are sometimes contested in which the loser must permanently remove his mask, which is a wager with a high degree of weight attached. Tag team wrestling is especially prevalent in &quot;lucha libre&quot;, particularly matches with three-member teams, called &quot;trios&quot;.

Although in English the term specifically refers to the Mexican style of theatrical professional wrestling, in Spanish it can refer to other kinds of wrestling, including competitive freestyle wrestling (&quot;:es:lucha libre olímpica&quot;) and professional wrestling in general (&quot;:es:lucha libre profesional&quot;) in addition to Mexican professional wrestling in particular (&quot;:es:lucha libre mexicana&quot;). However, in Spain (as with other non-Anglophone European countries) professional wrestling is known as &quot;Catch&quot;.

&quot;Lucha libre&quot; wrestlers are known as &quot;luchadores&quot; (singular &quot;luchador&quot;) and often come from extended wrestling families who form their own stables. One such line integrated to the United States professional wrestling scene is &quot;Los Guerreros&quot;.

In 2018, Mexican &quot;lucha libre&quot; was declared an intangible cultural heritage of Mexico City by the head of the Government of Mexico City.

==Rules==
The rules of lucha libre are similar to American singles matches. Matches can be won by pinning the opponent to the mat for the count of three, making him submit, knocking him out of the ring for a predetermined count (generally twenty), or by disqualification. Using the ropes for leverage is illegal, and once a &quot;luchador&quot; is on the ropes, his opponent must release any holds and he will not be able to pin him.

Disqualifications occur when an opponent uses an illegal grab or move, such as the piledriver, which is an illegal move in wrestling and grounds for immediate disqualification, although some variants are legal in certain promotions; or when he hits his opponent in the groin (foul); when he uses outside interference; when he attacks the referee; or when he completely rips off his opponent&#x27;s mask. Most matches are two out of three falls, which had been abandoned for title matches in North America and Japan in the 1970s.

A unique rule in lucha libre applies during team matches (i.e., when a team&#x27;s legal wrestler touches the ground outside the ring, a teammate may enter the ring to take his place as a legal competitor). Since the legal wrestler can step on the floor willingly, it is not necessary to tag a teammate to enter the match. This often allows for much more frantic action to take place in the ring than would be possible under standard tag rules.

==History==

The antecedents of Mexican wrestling date back to 1863, during the French Intervention in Mexico, when Enrique Ugartechea, the first Mexican wrestler, developed and invented Mexican lucha libre from Greco-Roman wrestling.
In the early 20th century, professional wrestling was mostly a regional phenomenon in Mexico until Salvador Lutteroth founded the Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (&quot;Mexican Wrestling Enterprise&quot;) in 1933, giving the sport a national foothold for the first time.
The promotion flourished and quickly became the premier spot for wrestlers. As television surfaced as a viable entertainment medium during the 1950s, Lutteroth was then able to broadcast his wrestling across the nation, subsequently yielding a popularity explosion for the sport. Moreover, it was the emergence of television that allowed Lutteroth to promote lucha libre&#x27;s first breakout superstar into a national pop-culture phenomenon.

In 1942, lucha libre would be forever changed when a silver-masked wrestler, known simply as El Santo (&quot;The Saint&quot;), first stepped into the ring. He made his debut in Mexico City by winning an 8-man battle royal. The public fell in love with the mystique and secrecy of Santo&#x27;s personality, and he quickly became the most popular &quot;luchador&quot; in Mexico. His wrestling career spanned nearly five decades, during which he became a folk hero and a symbol of justice for the common man through his appearances in comic books and movies, while the sport received an unparalleled degree of mainstream attention.

Other legendary &quot;luchadores&quot; who helped popularize the sport include Gory Guerrero, who is credited with developing moves and holds which are now commonplace in professional wrestling; Blue Demon, a contemporary of Santo and possibly his greatest rival; and &quot;Mil Máscaras&quot; (Man of A Thousand Masks), who is credited with introducing the high flying moves of lucha libre to audiences around the world. He achieved international fame as one of the first high-flyers, something he was not considered in Mexico, where he fell under the mat-power category.

==Style of wrestling==

&quot;Luchadores&quot; are traditionally more agile and perform more aerial maneuvers than professional wrestlers in the United States, who more often rely on power and hard strikes to subdue their opponents. The difference in styles is due to the independent evolution of the sport in Mexico beginning in the 1930s and the fact that &quot;luchadores&quot; in the cruiserweight division (&quot;peso semicompleto&quot;) are often the most popular wrestlers in Mexican lucha libre. &quot;Luchadores&quot; execute characteristic high-flying attacks by using the wrestling ring&#x27;s ropes to catapult themselves towards their opponents, using intricate combinations in rapid-fire succession, and applying complex submission holds. Rings used in lucha libre generally lack the spring supports added to U.S. and Japanese rings; as a result, lucha libre does not emphasize the &quot;flat back&quot; bumping style of other professional wrestling styles. For this same reason, aerial maneuvers are almost always performed on opponents outside the ring, allowing the luchador to break his fall with an acrobatic tumble.
Lucha libre has several different weight classes, many catered to smaller agile fighters, who often make their debuts in their mid-teens. This system enables dynamic high-flying &quot;luchadores&quot; such as Rey Mysterio, Jr., Juventud Guerrera, Super Crazy and &quot;Místico&quot;, to develop years of experience by their mid-twenties. A number of prominent Japanese wrestlers also started their careers training in Mexican lucha libre before becoming stars in Japan. These include Gran Hamada, Satoru Sayama, Jushin Thunder Liger, and &quot;Último Dragón&quot;.

Lucha libre is also known for its tag team wrestling matches. The teams are often made up of three members, instead of two as is common in the United States. These three-man teams participate in what are called &quot; trios&quot; matches, for tag team championship belts. Of these three members, one member is designated the captain. A successful fall in a &quot;trios&quot; match can be achieved by either pinning the captain of the opposing team or by pinning both of the other members. A referee can also stop the match because of &quot;excessive punishment&quot;. He can then award the match to the aggressors. Falls often occur simultaneously, which adds to the extremely stylized nature of the action. In addition, a wrestler can opt to roll out of the ring in lieu of tagging a partner or simply be knocked out of the ring, at which point one of his partners may enter. As a result, the tag team formula and pacing which has developed in U.S. tag matches is different from lucha libre because the race to tag is not a priority. There are also two-man tag matches (&quot;parejas&quot;) and &quot;four on four&quot; matches (&quot;atomicos&quot;).

==Masks==

Masks (&quot;máscaras&quot;) have been used dating back to the beginnings of lucha libre in the early part of the 20th century, and have a historical significance to Mexico in general, dating to the days of the Aztecs. Early masks were very simple with basic colors to distinguish the wrestler. In modern lucha libre, masks are colorfully designed to evoke the images of animals, gods, ancient heroes and other archetypes, whose identity the &quot;luchador&quot; takes on during a performance. Virtually all wrestlers in Mexico will start their careers wearing masks, but over the span of their careers, a large number of them will be unmasked. Sometimes, a wrestler slated for retirement will be unmasked in his final bout or at the beginning of a final tour, signifying a loss of identity as that character. Sometimes, losing the mask signifies the end of a gimmick with the wrestler moving on to a new gimmick and mask. The mask is considered sacred to a degree, so much so that fully removing an opponent&#x27;s mask during a match is grounds for disqualification.

During their careers, masked &quot;luchadores&quot; will often be seen in public wearing their masks and keeping up the culture of lucha libre, while other masked wrestlers will interact with the public and press normally. However, they will still go to great lengths to conceal their true identities; in effect, the mask is synonymous with the &quot;luchador&quot;. El Santo continued wearing his mask after retirement, revealing his face only briefly in old age, and was eventually buried wearing his silver mask.

More recently, the masks &quot;luchadores&quot; wear have become iconic symbols of Mexican culture. Contemporary artists like Francisco Delgado and Xavier Garza incorporate wrestler masks in their paintings.

Although masks are a feature of lucha libre, it is a misconception that every Mexican wrestler uses one. There have been several maskless wrestlers who have been successful, particularly Tarzán López, Gory Guerrero, Perro Aguayo and Negro Casas. Formerly masked wrestlers who lost their masks, such as Satánico, Cien Caras, Cibernético and others, have had continued success despite losing their masks.

=== Luchas de Apuestas ===

With the importance placed on masks in lucha libre, losing the mask to an opponent is seen as the ultimate insult, and can at times seriously hurt the career of the unmasked wrestler. Putting one&#x27;s mask on the line against a hated opponent is a tradition in lucha libre as a means to settle a heated feud between two or more wrestlers. In these battles, called &quot;luchas de apuestas&quot; (&quot;matches with wagers&quot;), the wrestlers &quot;wager&quot; either their mask or their hair.

In a &quot;lucha de apuesta&quot; (betting match), wrestlers make a public bet on the outcome of the match. The most common forms are the mask-against-mask, hair-against-hair, or mask-against-hair matches. A wrestler who loses his or her mask has to remove the mask after the match. A wrestler who loses their hair is shaved immediately afterward. Usually the true identity of a masked wrestler is previously unknown, thus, it is customary for that person to reveal his real name, hometown and years as a professional upon unmasking.

Masked wrestlers appeared somewhere around 1920&#x27;s, as a resemblance of the covered roosters in cockfighting, people could bet for the known wrestler or go for the covered one, at the end of the match, the covered one could reveal itself and people could see which luchador was. Promoters soon discovered that mystery was very attractive for the audience, and opted to keep the secret or to sell that the masked wrestler will reveal itself only if he was defeated. These weren&#x27;t luchas de apuestas in the proper sense, since there weren’t any bets on the line among the luchadores, nor did any masked gimmicks exist at this point. These were generally covered wrestlers that usually revealed themselves at the end of the night or after few shows. However, luchadores increasingly became aware about the expectation their secret identity set for the audiences, and gradually chose to keep their identities secret for a while longer. They also began to adopt masked gimmicks to differentiate among the growing number of other wrestlers.

The first &quot;lucha de apuestas&quot; (i.e. two wrestlers with a bet on the line) was presented on July 14, 1940, at Arena México. The defending champion Murciélago (Velázquez) was so much lighter than his challenger (Octavio Gaona), he requested a further condition before he would sign the contract: Octavio Gaona would have to put his hair on the line. Octavio Gaona won the match and Murciélago unmasked, giving birth to the tradition.

==== Luchas de Apuestas variants ====
The following match types are variants of Luchas de Apuestas matches with different types of wagers.
* &quot;Máscara contra máscara&quot; (mask versus mask): In this match, two masked luchadores engage in a high-stakes confrontation where the wager involves their masks. The outcome dictates that the losing wrestler is ceremoniously unmasked by the winning opponent and must reveal his/her identity (usually the face and name of masked luchadores are keep in secret). The act of unmasking a wrestler often serves as a significant catalyst for the winner&#x27;s career advancement and have the opposite effect for the loser. The most notable example is the 1952 match in which El Santo gained the mask of Black Shadow. This match was so significant that it established lucha libre as a cultural phenomenon in Mexico. Another example occurred in 2000, when Villano III lost his mask to Atlantis, which some considered the best lucha libre match in history. Also noteworthy was the family feud between Ray Mendoza&#x27;s sons and Shadito Cruz&#x27;s sons, which lead to a 1988 triple mask bet between Villano I, Villano IV and Villano V against El Brazo, Brazo de Oro (wrestler) and Brazo de Plata; the Villanos won the masks of the Alvarado brothers.
* &quot;Máscara contra cabellera&quot; (mask versus hair): In this variant, a masked wrestler and an unmasked one compete. If the masked &quot;luchador&quot; wins, the unmasked &quot;luchador&quot; shaves his head as a sign of humiliation. If the unmasked &quot;luchador&quot; wins, he keeps his hair and the loser is unmasked. These matches are infrequent because masked wrestlers are usually reluctant to bet their masks against hair, as masks are a more appreciated trophy, unmasking often results in a decrease in popularity for the wrestler, and a masked wrestler usually loses his mask just once, while unmasked wrestlers can be shaved many times. The most common result of these matches is the masked wrestler winning the hair of the unmasked one, but there are notable exceptions. Perro Aguayo never adopted a masked gimmick and was very successful in wager matches, unmasking important wrestlers like Konnan, Máscara Año 2000 and Stuka (father). Aguayo&#x27;s hair was a trophy so coveted by legends that El Solitario, El Santo, and Villano III each successfully bet their masks to win it. Another important hair was from Cavernario Galindo, a legendary unmasked wrestler from the golden age of Mexican lucha libre who, like Aguayo, never wrestled masked. Though Galindo never won a mask, he was respected enough that the two most important wrestlers in Mexican history, El Santo and Blue Demon, risked their identities to win his hair.
* &quot;Cabellera contra cabellera&quot; (hair versus hair): In this match the loser has his head shaved. These matches are very common and do not command the interest and expectation of mask wagers. However, there are wrestlers who gained notice via these matches. Examples are El Satánico, Negro Casas, Perro Aguayo and Villano III. Noteworthy was the feud between El Dandy and El Satánico which lead to a long-run storyline of hair vs hair matches. A curious example is the match between Blue Panther and Negro Casas which ended with a tie and both heads were shaved. 
* &quot;Apuestas al revés&quot; (reverse bet): This is a controversial variant of wager matches, where two masked wrestlers bet their hair. The competitors either wear a modified version of their mask which shows their hair, or the loser must remove their mask enough to allow the hair to be shaved. This variation was frequent in late 1990s in the Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide shows. These matches are considered by many to be disrespectful to the audience since they allow masked wrestlers to avoid risking their identities, or are seen as a convenient way for a masked wrestler with a strong streak of wager matches to lose one without risking anything. The most notorious example of this was Super Muñeco, an extremely successful wrestler in mask versus mask matches (he is the second most successful winner of masks) who won more than 100 wager matches, but the only loss in his career was an &quot;apuestas al revés&quot; match against Halloween (wrestler). In another sub variant of apuestas al revés, neither the masks nor the hair of the wrestlers are on the line; rather, the &quot;luchadores&quot; bet the masks or the hair of others. 
* &quot;Título versus cabello, máscara o carrera&quot; (title versus hair, mask or career): In this match, if the title challenger loses, they are unmasked, shaved bald or retired. But if the champion loses, the challenger is crowned the new champion. Since for mexican luchadores wagers are much more valuable than championships (a wager bet is a high risk for the luchador, and doesn&#x27;t make sense to put a mask on the line to win a championship), there are no known examples in Lucha Libre, but some examples can be found in American wrestling. This occurred in WWE when Rey Mysterio, a masked &quot;luchador&quot;, bet his mask against the Intercontinental Champion Chris Jericho in a Title vs. Mask match at The Bash and retaining his mask and winning the title. A different result occurred on Raw in 2003, when Kane failed to defeat Triple H in a World Title vs. Mask match for the World Heavyweight Championship and was unmasked per the stipulation. A different result occurred on SmackDown in April 30, 2021 when Daniel Bryan failed to defeat Roman Reigns in a championship vs. career match for the WWE Universal Championship and became banished the SmackDown brand per the stipulation as this was Bryan’s last match in WWE.
* &quot;Máscara o cabellera contra efectivo&quot; (mask or hair versus cash): If the masked or haired &quot;luchador&quot; loses this match, his opponent wins the mask or hair. But if he wins, his opponent must pay a monetary amount. Very rare, since wagers are highly valuable in Lucha Libre, and since in wager matches there is a budget for the loser (in compensation, since very often losing a mask seriously damages the loser&#x27;s career: i.e.&quot;Winner takes less money, but he gets the win and can continue his career&quot;). So it&#x27;s atypical that winner gets more money after saving his/her mask. The most known example is the 1981 bout when Anibal defeated El Solitario and get paid $500,000 pesos of the time (El Solitario kept his mask). 
* &quot;Carrera contra carrera&quot; (career versus career): In this match, the loser must retire. Very uncommon. Since losing a mask usually hurts enough the loser&#x27;s career and may lead to retirement shortly after, very often luchadores who had been masked for decades lose their masks in their final wrestling years against younger talents who need a boost in their rising careers, thus there&#x27;s little need to bet career since losing a wager is enough justification to retire immediately or shortly after losing it (examples of luchadores retiring shortly after losing their mask are Gallo tapado, Fishman, Lizmark Jr. etc.). Few examples of career matches exist in lucha libre. The most notorious example occurred in the First Triplemania in 1993, when Dos Caras defeated Konnan (Carlos Santiago Espadas) in two rounds in a row in a career match. Espadas didn&#x27;t keep his word and returned to wrestling after a few months.
* &quot;Máscara o cabellera contra retiro&quot; (mask or hair versus retirement): If the masked or haired &quot;luchador&quot; loses this match, his opponent wins the mask or hair. If he wins, his opponent must retire. This is very uncommon for the reasons mentioned above, so few examples exist, like the 2022 match between Rey Milán (mask) vs Rey Pantera (hair and retirement) in which Pantera saved his career and won the mask of Rey Milan. 
*&quot;Apuesta por el nombre&quot; (bet for the name): This is a rare type of match in which two &quot;luchadores&quot; with the same or a similar name battle for the right to use the name or identity. This typically occurs when the original &quot;luchador&quot; leaves a wrestling company but the company retains the name and character (often at the protest of the &quot;luchador&quot;) and gives the gimmick to another &quot;luchador.&quot; If the original name owner returns to the company, they may claim to be the rightful owner of the character and adopt a similar name. If conditions allow, this can be solved in a &quot;lucha de apuesta&quot; where the winner is considered the rightful owner of the character. Sometimes, but not necessarily, it may also result in the loss of the loser&#x27;s mask. The most notorious examples of this type of match are the two bouts (with the first being controversial and thus annulled) in 2010 between Adolfo Tapia (aka L.A. Park, a wordplay for &quot;La Auténtica Park&quot;, i.e., &quot;The Authentic Park&quot;) and Jesús Alfonso Huerta (aka La Parka, La Parka II), in which Tapia (the original Parka) failed to recover the name, and Huerta retained the identity until his death in 2020. Another example is Mr. Niebla from (Efrén Tiburcio Márquez) who won a name and mask bet against Mr. Niebla from IWRG (Miguel Ángel Guzmán Velázquez).

==Weight classes==
Since lucha libre has its roots more in Latin American professional wrestling than North American professional wrestling, it retains some of the basics of the Latin American version such as more weight classes than professional wrestling in North America post World War II. Like &quot;old school&quot; European (especially British) wrestling, some Japanese wrestling and early 20th-century American wrestling, Lucha libre has a detailed weight class system patterned after boxing. Each weight class has an official upper limit, but examples of wrestlers who are technically too heavy to hold their title can be found. The following weight classes exist in lucha libre, as defined by the &quot;Comisión de Box y Lucha Libre Mexico D.F.&quot; (the Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission), the main regulatory body in Mexico:

==Other characteristics==
&quot;Luchadores&quot; are traditionally divided into two categories, &quot;rudos&quot; (lit. &quot;tough guys&quot;, who are &quot;bad guys&quot;, or &quot;heels&quot;), who bend or break the rules, and &quot;técnicos&quot; (the &quot;good guys&quot;, or &quot;faces&quot;, literally &quot;technicians&quot;), who play by the rules and their moves are much more complex and spectacular. &quot;Técnicos&quot; tend to have very formal combat styles, close to Greco-Roman wrestling and martial arts techniques, whereas &quot;rudos&quot; tend to be brawlers. &quot;Técnicos&quot; playing the &quot;good guy&quot; role, and &quot;rudos&quot; playing the &quot;bad guy&quot; role is very characteristic of Mexican lucha libre, which differs from U.S. professional wrestling, where many technical wrestlers play the role of heels (e.g., Kurt Angle), and many brawlers play as &quot;faces&quot; (e.g., Stone Cold Steve Austin &amp; The Rock). Although &quot;rudos&quot; often resort to using underhanded tactics, they are still expected to live up to a &quot;luchador&quot; code of honor. For instance, a &quot;luchador&quot; who has lost a wager match would prefer to endure the humiliation of being unmasked or having his head shaved rather than live with the shame that would come from not honoring his bet. &quot;Rudos&quot; have also been known to make the transition into &quot;técnicos&quot; after a career-defining moment, as was the case with Blue Demon, who decided to become a &quot;técnico&quot; after his wrestling partner, Black Shadow, was unmasked by the legendary Santo. Tag teams are sometimes composed of both &quot;rudos&quot; and &quot;técnicos&quot; in what are called &quot;parejas increibles&quot; (incredible pairings). &quot;Parejas increibles&quot; highlight the conflict between a &quot;luchador&quot;″s desire to win and his contempt for his partner.

A staple gimmick present in lucha libre since the 1950s is &quot;exótico&quot;, a character in drag. It is argued that the gimmick has recently attained a more flamboyant outlook.

&quot;Luchadores&quot;, like their foreign counterparts, seek to obtain a &quot;campeonato&quot; (championship) through winning key wrestling matches. Since many feuds and shows are built around &quot;luchas de apuestas&quot; (matches with wagers), title matches play a less prominent role in Mexico than in the U.S. Titles can be defended as few as one time per year.

The two biggest lucha libre promotions in Mexico are (CMLL), which was founded in 1933, and Lucha Libre AAA World Wide (AAA).

==Fans honoring wrestlers==

One characteristic practiced in Mexico is with fans honoring wrestlers by throwing money into the wrestling ring after witnessing a high-quality match. With this act fans honor the &quot;luchador&quot; in a symbolic way, thanking the &quot;luchador&quot; for a spectacular match demonstrating they are pleased with their performance, showing the match is worth their money and worth more than what they paid to witness such an event. This act of honoring the &quot;luchador&quot; is uncommon: months can pass without it happening, because fans are the toughest of critics, booing the &quot;luchador&quot; if they are not pleased with their performance. Booing may happen regardless of the perceived virtuousness of the &quot;luchador&#x27;s&quot; persona.

The &quot;luchador&quot;, after receiving such an act of honor, will pick up the money and save it as a symbolic trophy, putting it in a vase or a box, labeled with the date, to be treasured.

==Female professional wrestlers==
Female wrestlers or &quot;luchadoras&quot; also compete in Mexican &quot;lucha libre&quot;. The CMLL World Women&#x27;s Championship is the top title for CMLL&#x27;s women&#x27;s division, while the AAA Reina de Reinas Championship is a championship defended in an annual tournament by female wrestlers in AAA. AAA also recognizes a World Mixed Tag Team Championship, contested by tag teams composed of a &quot;luchador&quot; and &quot;luchadora&quot; respectively. In 2000, the all-female promotion company Lucha Libre Femenil (LLF) was founded.

==Mini-Estrellas==
&quot;Lucha Libre&quot; has a division called the &quot;Mini-Estrella&quot; or &quot;Minis&quot; division, which unlike North American midget wrestling, is not just for dwarfs but also for &quot;luchadores&quot; that are short. The maximum allowable height to participate in the Mini division was originally 5 feet, but in recent years wrestlers such as Pequeño Olímpico have worked the Minis division despite being tall. The Minis division was first popularized in the 1970s with wrestlers like Pequeño Luke and Arturito (a wrestler with an R2-D2 gimmick) becoming noticed for their high flying abilities. In the late 1980s/early 1990s CMLL created the first actual &quot;Minis&quot; division, the brainchild of then-CMLL booker Antonio Peña. CMLL created the CMLL World Mini-Estrella Championship in 1992, making it the oldest Minis championship still in existence today. Minis are often patterned after &quot;regular-sized&quot; wrestlers and are sometimes called &quot;mascotas&quot; (&quot;mascots&quot;) if they team with the regular-sized version.

==Luchadores in the United States==
In 1994, AAA promoted the &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot; pay-per-view in conjunction with the U.S. promotion company World Championship Wrestling (WCW). &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot; introduced U.S. audiences to many of the top &quot;luchadores&quot; in Mexico at the time.

In recent years, several luchadores have found success in the United States. Notable &quot;luchadores&quot; who achieved success in the U.S. are Eddie Guerrero, Chavo Guerrero, Rey Mysterio, Jr., Juventud Guerrera, L. A. Park, Super Crazy, Alberto Del Rio, Psicosis, Místico, Kalisto, Aero Star, Drago, Andrade El Idolo, Pentagon Jr., Fenix, El Hijo del Fantasma, Bandido, Flamita, Puma King, Rush, Soberano Jr., Dragon Lee, Guerrero Maya Jr. and Stuka Jr. 

CMLL lucha libre shows are broadcast weekly in the U.S. on the Spanish-language cable networks Galavisión and LA TV.

&quot;Lucha Underground&quot; is a television series produced by the United Artists Media Group which airs in English on the El Rey Network and in Spanish on UniMás. It features wrestlers from the American independent circuit and AAA. AAA also owns a percentage of Lucha Underground. The series, which is taped live in Boyle Heights, California, finished season 4 finale.

In 2012, the Arizona Diamondbacks Major League Baseball team started doing promotions involving lucha libre. A luchador mask in Diamondback colors was a popular giveaway at one game. In 2013 a Diamondbacks Luchador was made an official mascot, joining D. Baxter Bobcat. The first 20,000 fans at the July 27 game against the San Diego Padres were to receive a luchador mask.

==National variants==
In Spain, professional wrestling has commonly been called &quot;catch&quot; (from catch-as-catch-can wrestling) and &quot;pressing catch&quot;. In Peru, the term &quot;cachascán&quot; (from &quot;catch as can&quot;) is used and the wrestlers are called &quot;cachascanistas&quot;. In Bolivia, wrestling Cholitas – female wrestlers dressed up as indigenous Aymara – are popular and have inspired comic books.

==In mixed martial arts==
Some lucha libre wrestlers had careers in various mixed martial arts promotions, promoting lucha libre and wearing signature masks and attire. One of the most famous is Dos Caras Jr.

==In popular culture==
Lucha Libre has crossed over into popular culture, especially in Mexico, where it is the second most popular sport after soccer. Outside of Mexico, lucha libre has also crossed over into popular culture, especially in movies and television. Depictions of luchadors are often used as symbols of Mexico and Mexican culture in non-Spanish-speaking cultures.

===Movies and television===

The motion picture &quot;Nacho Libre&quot;, starring Jack Black as a priest-turned-luchador was inspired by the story of Father Sergio Gutiérrez Benítez, a real-life Catholic priest who wrestled as Fray Tormenta to make money for his church. The documentary feature &quot;Lucha Mexico&quot; (2016) captured the lives of some of Mexico&#x27;s well known wrestlers. The stars were Shocker, Blue Demon Jr., El Hijo del Perro Aguayo and Último Guerrero. Directed by Alex Hammond and Ian Markiewicz. Rob Zombie&#x27;s animated film &quot;The Haunted World of El Superbeasto&quot; stars a Mexican luchador named El Superbeasto. The Main Antagonist of the animated film Despicable Me 2, El Macho, sports a costume resembling that of a luchador, consistent with his theme of Mexican culture.

Television shows have also been inspired by lucha libre, especially animated series such as &quot;¡Mucha Lucha!&quot; Cartoon Network also produced an animated miniseries based on the luchador El Santo. The WB television series &quot;Angel&quot; episode entitled &quot;The Cautionary Tale of Numero Cinco&quot; told the story of a family of &quot;luchadores&quot; called &quot;Los Hermanos Números&quot; who also fought evil. Angel must help the remaining brother, Numero Cinco, defeat the Aztec warrior-demon that killed his four brothers. In the British TV show &quot;Justin Lee Collins: The Wrestler&quot;, Colins competes as the &quot;rudo&quot; &quot;El Glorioso&quot;, or The Glorious One, against the &quot;exótico&quot; Cassandro in The Roundhouse, London, ultimately losing and being unmasked. The book and television series &quot;The Strain&quot; by Guillermo del Toro and Chuck Hogan, features a retired luchador character called Angel de la Plata (The Silver Angel), played by Joaquin Cosio. In the storyline, Angel de la Plata (probably based on El Santo) was a major masked wrestling star in Mexico, appearing both in the ring and in a series of movies in which his character battled all manner of foes including vampires. A knee injury ended his career but he is called upon to use his fighting skills against a real-life vampire invasion of New York. The Fox Kids live-action series &quot;Los Luchadores&quot; (2001) starred a trio of masked wrestlers consisting of Lobo Fuerte, Maria Valentine, and Turbine who not only participate in wrestling tournaments but also fight to protect their home of Union City from numerous threats (both natural and supernatural).

===Video games===

Lucha libre is a recurring motif in nearly every game directed by Suda51, starting from his directorial debut Super Fire Pro Wrestling 3 Final Bout. Most prominently, the character Mask de Smith from killer7 is a playable lucha libre wrestler, featuring a mask and cape.

The popular video game franchise &quot;Pokémon&quot; introduced the Fighting/Flying-type Pokémon Hawlucha, which is a hawk-like humanoid creature with elements of a lucha libre wrestler.

The masked Luchador fighter and chef El Fuerte was introduced to the Street Fighter franchise in Street Fighter IV.

The fighting game and its follow-up, the King of Fighters series, featured the character Tizoc who was a Luchador that wore a mask resembling the head of a griffon; during the events of The King of Fighters XIV, he adopted the heel persona of The King of Dinosaurs, wearing now a dinosaur inspired mask.

The &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; franchise features a masked luchadora called La Mariposa.

The Tekken fighting game franchise features the characters known as King and Armor King, both of whom are Luchadors and have similar jaguar-style masks.

Guacamelee! and its sequel Guacamelee! 2 heavily feature Luchador masks, with the main protagonist, Juan Aguacate, being bestowed a mystical mask to help him get revenge on Carlos Calaca, an evil charro skeleton (in Guacamelee) and to help him fight Salvador, an evil Luchador, in Guacamelee! 2.

The 2005 platformer game &quot;Psychonauts&quot; features four Luchadores (Tiger, Dragon, Eagle, and Cobra) who act as miniboss-type enemies in the level &quot;Black Velvetopia.&quot; The player must defeat the Luchadores in order to access the arena that will let them fight the level&#x27;s main boss, El Odio.

Brawl Stars has a rare brawler called “El Primo”. He punches enemies two times and can jump on them with his super.

Tezca, a playable legend in Brawlhalla, is a masked luchador with jaguar-themed design and fighting style.

Kirby Fighters 2 has a wrestler copy ability introduced. It can do moves from fighter and suplex.

=== Internet culture ===

Strong Bad of the Homestar Runner universe began as a parody of lucha libre. His head is designed after a mask and his hands after boxing gloves.

===Lucha libre inspirations===
Nike has designed a line of lucha libre-inspired athletic shoes. Coca-Cola developed a Blue Demon Full Throttle energy drink named after the luchador Blue Demon, Jr. who is also the spokesperson for the drink in Mexico. Coca-Cola also introduced &quot;Gladiator&quot; in Mexico, an energy drink that sponsored CMLL events and that featured CMLL wrestlers such as Místico and Último Guerrero.

<text>Telegraphs in Negative/Mouths Trapped in Static is a double album by the Canadian musical collective, Set Fire to Flames. The album was recorded in the span of several months in late 2002, and was then published by both Alien8 Recordings and FatCat Records in 2003.

The album itself was recorded in a barn in rural Ontario, Canada. The recording atmosphere was decidedly informal—the sounds of the band members talking and moving around can be readily heard during the album&#x27;s quiet moments. Like their first album, &quot;Telegraphs in Negative/Mouths Trapped in Static&quot; was recorded &quot;in states of little or no sleep, in varying levels of intoxication, and in physical confinement.&quot;

The release utilizes many different instruments, including guitars, basses, strings, horns, glockenspiel, marimba, bass clarinet, cymbalon, hurdy-gurdy, music boxes, modified electronics, saw, and contact microphones.

<text>Ahmed Zaoui (; born 26 November 1961) is an Algerian refugee. He arrived in New Zealand on 4 December 2002 where he sought refugee status. Objections from the Security Intelligence Service were withdrawn in September 2007, allowing him to remain in New Zealand. He was granted New Zealand citizenship in 2014.

==Background==

===Before 1991===
Ahmed Zaoui was born as one of ten children in El Idrissia, in Djelfa Wilaya, Algeria, and was the son of a Sunni Muslim imam. His family moved to the town of Médéa when he was young, and after completing high school, he enrolled in Imam Muhammad Ibn Saud Islamic University, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia between the years of 1980 and 1985, gaining a Bachelor of Arts. He became engaged and married to an Algerian woman during this time. After returning, he took postgraduate studies at the University of Algiers and gained a position as an imam, and as an associate professor of theology at the University of Algiers.

===1991–2000: Algeria and Europe===
In 1991, Algeria held its first multiparty elections since independence. Ahmed Zaoui stood as a candidate for the Islamic Salvation Front (&quot;Front Islamique du Salut&quot; or FIS). However, the government cancelled 1991 elections after the first round results showed that the FIS would win, citing fears that the Islamist party would end democracy. When the government then banned the FIS and arrested thousands of its members, Islamist guerrillas rapidly emerged and began an armed campaign against the government and its supporters which became the Algerian Civil War.

In 1993, Zaoui fled to Europe. He was tried and convicted &quot;in absentia&quot; by the Algerian government and was convicted of &quot;establishing a terrorist organisation to destabilise state institutions and terrorise the population&quot; and for &quot;plotting against the state, criminal conspiracy, inciting armed rebellion and assassinations and destruction of property&quot; in May 1996, and February 1997, respectively. Both convictions carry sentences of life imprisonment. Disputing the reports from Interpol as incomplete, Zaoui claimed and the New Zealand Refugee Status Appeals Authority (RSAA) found that there were six life sentences against him, as well as two death sentences. Human rights groups have criticised the Algerian trials for contravening basic norms of justice.

In March 1994, Belgium charged him with being &quot;the instigator or the head of a criminal organisation&quot; and two charges of using false passports. He was acquitted at his first trial but was convicted on appeal and received a four-year suspended sentence.

While still under a Belgian home detention order which limited his movements to the street he lived on, he travelled illegally to Switzerland. The Swiss authorities refused his request for asylum due to his ongoing political activities, and made a deal with Burkina Faso to deport Zaoui and his family there, while still providing Zaoui with a 1500 Swiss franc monthly allowance.

===2000–2002: Travel to Asia then New Zealand===
Zaoui left Burkina Faso and travelled to Malaysia with his family in 2000. He engaged in political activity with the FIS in exile.

In 2001 France convicted him in absentia for &quot;participation in a criminal group with a view to preparing terrorist acts&quot;.

During his time in Malaysia, the head of the Algerian police services visited to observe Malaysian policing methods. Zaoui believed that this was a pretext, that the real reason was his presence in Malaysia, and that the Malaysian authorities were preparing to detain him. He decided to leave Malaysia, and on 2 December 2002 he arrived in New Zealand via Vietnam on a fake South African passport.

==Imprisonment in New Zealand==
En route to New Zealand, Zaoui attempted to destroy his fake South African passport, and upon arrival, applied for refugee status. Although his identity was initially secret, his name was illegally leaked to the media, and he became the subject of political debate and media scrutiny.

His initial application for refugee status to the Refugee Status Branch (RSB) of the New Zealand Immigration Service was declined. Although he was recognised as having a well founded fear of persecution, he was excluded as the RSB held there was reason to believe he had committed serious criminal or terrorist activities, primarily on evidence given by the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service and on his conviction in Belgium.

The SIS issued a security risk certificate in March 2003. Mr Zaoui then requested a review of the certificate. While not made public at the time, in February 2004 the High Court ordered the SIS to release the summary of its allegations to Zaoui&#x27;s lawyers, who then released it to the media. The summary excluded classified information which the SIS was not required to disclose. Zaoui&#x27;s lawyers issued a point-by-point response to the summary.

After his arrest, he was initially confined for ten months in the maximum security Paremoremo Prison where he was placed on a &quot;non-association regime&quot;. While Zaoui and his supporters have characterised this as being in solitary confinement; this was dismissed as a &quot;myth&quot; by the Department of Corrections. However, in October 2003 his case was reviewed, and citing the &quot;likely length of time before legal proceedings conclude&quot;, the Department of Corrections transferred him to the medium security Auckland Remand Prison where he was placed on a ‘normal association regime&quot;.

===Refugee status===

In August 2003 the Refugee Status Appeals Authority declared both his Belgian and French trials to be &quot;unsafe&quot; and granted Zaoui refugee status. Commenting on the information available to them in order to evaluate Zaoui&#x27;s claim, the RSAA stated that they &quot;...were surprised at how limited it was and the questionable nature of some of the contents&quot; and that &quot;...it does not provide evidence that he has committed, directed or participated in any act of violence or terrorism that would require his being excluded under Article 1F from the protection of the Refugee
Convention.&quot;

===Political attention and cause célèbre===

The case attracted considerable media and political attention. The New Zealand Government defended the treatment of Zaoui, and maintained they had information that he was a credible risk. In September 2004, Prime Minister Helen Clark&#x27;s office stated that Zaoui had links to al Qaeda, but Clark later withdrew the claim, saying that her &quot;office had probably gone too far in making the link&quot;. The New Zealand First Party attacked Mr Zaoui&#x27;s claim to asylum, while the Greens challenged the processes that saw him imprisoned and at risk of deportation.

On 20 October 2004, many of his supporters participated in a launch of a biographical book in the Beehive foyer in Wellington.

In October 2005 Zaoui published &quot;Migrant Birds&quot;, a book of 24 poems he wrote as a response to being imprisoned. The poems are in Arabic and English. A 25th poem, &quot;He will come back, the one I&#x27;m waiting for&quot;, was called the most important New Zealand poem of 2004 by Emma Neale, editor of &quot;Best New Zealand Poems 2004&quot;.

His case received attention from a number of celebrities and prominent New Zealanders. He was featured in the music video for Dave Dobbyn&#x27;s &quot;Welcome Home&quot;, and also appeared on stage with Dobbyn when the song was performed at the New Zealand Music Awards.

===Bail===
On 9 December 2004 the Supreme Court of New Zealand granted Zaoui bail. Despite Crown opposition, the Court allowed him to reside in the Dominican Priory in central Auckland. He was required to report to the police twice a week and spend each night in the priory between 10pm and 6am.

===Withdrawal of the security risk certificate===

On 13 September 2007, the head of the Security Intelligence Service, Dr Warren Tucker, withdrew the security risk certificate against Zaoui citing three main reasons:
#Mr Zaoui&#x27;s cooperation in providing information to the authorities.
#Additional classified information which showed that his associates were involved in terrorism, but not Zaoui himself.
#The length of time he has been in New Zealand, and the length of time which has passed from the offences he was convicted of.

The withdrawal of the security risk certificate means that the New Zealand Government has withdrawn its security objections to his refugee status, which was confirmed by the RSAA in August 2003. Zaoui was &quot;thrilled and delighted,&quot; and stated that he was &quot;...happy not just because my name has been cleared but because the whole system of security risk certificates can now be reviewed.&quot;

==Resolution, citizenship and arrest==
On 29 September 2005 a referendum was held in Algeria which resulted in the Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation, and gave amnesty to those jailed and convicted during the civil war, and critics have maintained that he is free to return safely. However, Zaoui has been granted refugee status in New Zealand, and is free to stay in the country.

Zaoui has a wife and four children who had been living illegally in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia since 2000 until they joined him in New Zealand on 26 October 2007.

A previous application for them to come to New Zealand was lodged in late 2006, but at that time, Immigration Minister David Cunliffe said it would not be appropriate while the status of Zaoui&#x27;s security risk certificate was being determined.

In 2009, Zaoui and his family moved to Palmerston North where he intended to study at Massey University. He initially worked part-time with the Manawatu Muslim Association. He opened a kebab stall called the Desert Rose in Palmerston North. In early 2012, Zaoui moved back to Auckland and started working at a food court on Karangahape Road. He was granted New Zealand citizenship in May 2014.

Since receiving New Zealand citizenship, Zaoui has returned to visit Algeria to participate in pro-democracy activism.

In 2023, Zaoui was arrested at gunpoint in Médéa after holding a political meeting at his house. Eight officers, accompanied by twelve vehicles, surrounded his home. After searching for weapons, he was placed under arrest. It was revealed on 24 October that Zaoui had been charged with subversion and had been moved to the in Koléa.

<doc id="1015316" wikidata="Q76940628" url="?curid=1015316" title="New York City Subway stations">
<text>The New York City Subway is a rapid transit system that serves four of the five boroughs of New York City, New York: the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens. Its operator is the New York City Transit Authority, which is itself controlled by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York. In 2015, an average of 5.65 million passengers used the system daily, making it the busiest rapid transit system in the United States and the 11th busiest in the world.

The present New York City Subway system is composed of three formerly separate systems that merged in 1940: the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT), the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT), and the Independent Subway System (IND). The privately held IRT, founded in 1902, constructed and operated the first underground railway line in New York City. The opening of the first line on October 27, 1904, is commonly cited as the opening of the modern New York City Subway, although some elevated lines of the IRT and BMT that were initially incorporated into the New York City Subway system but then demolished predate this. The oldest sections of elevated lines still in operation were built in 1885. The BMT, founded in 1923 and also privately held, was formed from the bankruptcy of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company. The IND was created by the City of New York in 1921 to be a municipally owned competitor of the two private companies. Unification in June 1940 by the New York City Board of Transportation brought the three systems under one operator. The New York City Transit Authority, created in 1953 to be a public benefit corporation that acquired the rapid transit and surface line (buses and streetcars) infrastructure of the Board of Transportation, remains the operator of the New York City Subway today.

The official count of stations is ; however, this tabulation classifies some transfer stations as two or more stations, which are called &quot;station complexes&quot; within the nomenclature of the New York City Subway. If station complexes are counted as one station each, the number of stations is . Thirty-two such station complexes exist. The reason for the higher count generally lies in the history of the New York City Subway: IRT, BMT and IND stations are usually counted separately, particularly if their lines are not parallel and are adjacent to or on another level to each other. Regardless of how stations are counted, the New York City Subway has the largest number of rapid transit stations in the world.

There are numerous New York City Subway stations that are closed, many of which stem from the demolition of elevated lines once operated by the IRT and the BMT that were made largely but not completely redundant to underground lines subsequently constructed.

The newest New York City Subway stations are part of the Second Avenue Subway, and are located on Second Avenue at 72nd, 86th and 96th streets. They opened on January 1, 2017.

Stations that share identical street names are disambiguated by the line name and/or the cross street each is associated with. For example, &quot;125th Street station&quot; can refer to four separate stations: 125th Street on the IND Eighth Avenue Line (), the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line (), the IRT Lenox Avenue Line (), and the IRT Lexington Avenue Line (). This situation occurs numerous times.

== Station facilities and amenities ==

Of the stations in the system, -2 are served 24 hours a day. Underground stations in the New York City Subway are typically accessed by staircases going down from street level. Many of these staircases are painted in a common shade of green, with slight or significant variations in design. Other stations have unique entrances reflective of their location or date of construction. Several station entrance stairs, for example, are integrated into adjacent buildings. Nearly all station entrances feature color-coded globe or square lamps signifying their status as an entrance (see below).

Out of all the stations on the New York City Subway,
* 275 are fully underground (59%) 
* 153 are elevated stations (32%)
* 29 are on an embankment (6%)
* 15 are open-cut stations (3%) 

This means that 61% of the stations are below the surface (59% being fully underground and about 2% with most of the station below the surface). 39% of stations are above the surface or overground.

=== Entrances ===

==== Turnstiles and entrance gates ====
The New York City Subway primarily employs two types of turnstiles: a waist-high turnstile, and a full-height turnstile known as a High Entry-Exit Turnstile (HEET). The waist-high turnstiles, the most prominent in the system, were installed beginning in 1993 along with the implementation of MetroCard, though they originally accepted tokens. They are manufactured in Tennessee by Cubic Corporation. Some of the waist-high turnstiles date to the late 20th century, when tokens were used to pay fares; as such, they still have token-return compartments. The waist-high turnstiles are vulnerable to a practice called &quot;back-cocking&quot;, in which people entering the system can partially rotate the turnstile as if they were exiting, then slip through the side of the turnstile without paying.

The newer HEETs resemble several older turnstiles of that design informally called &quot;iron maidens&quot;, and are prevalent at subway entrances without token booths to discourage fare evasion. Both turnstiles are stainless steel and are bidirectional, allowing passengers to enter with fare payment and to exit. A third older type of turnstile, the High Exit Turnstile (HET), is a black-painted unidirectional iron maiden and only turns in the exiting direction. Entrance is also available via Service Entry gates or AutoGates, which cater primarily to handicapped passengers or passengers with large items such as strollers and luggage. These gates double as pushbar Emergency Exits, though they are often used for regular exiting in crowded stations.

New turnstile designs were introduced in the 2020s. The MTA announced in 2021 that it would install wide-aisle fare gates for disabled passengers at five subway stations by mid-2022; the implementation of these fare gates was delayed by a year. Additionally, in an attempt to reduce fare evasion, the MTA exhibited several designs for half-height and full-height Plexiglas turnstiles in May 2023, which would replace the existing waist-high turnstiles. On December 4, 2023, the first wide aisle fare gates were installed at Sutphin Boulevard–Archer Avenue–JFK Airport station. Within two months, there was a slight increase in fare-paying riders at the station, although passengers were able to evade fares merely by leaning over the new turnstiles and activating the motion sensors. Following adjustments to the turnstiles, the MTA announced in May 2024 that the new turnstiles would be installed at fifteen stations by the end of that year, but the installation of the turnstiles was delayed. The MTA has also tested out other features to prevent fare evasion, including low metal fins on each arm of a turnstile, as well as high spiked panels between separate turnstiles.

==== Lamps ====
At most of the system&#x27;s entrances and exits, there is a lamppost or two bearing a colored spherical or cube-shaped lamp. These lights roughly indicate the station&#x27;s availability (i.e. how often it is accessible): green means always a full-time, 24/7 entrance and the presence of a 24 hour booth, typically located at the busiest entrance. Red means either a part-time booth or no booth, hence either exit-only or more and more often 24/7 entrance with MetroCard exclusively via HEETs. Older lamps are completely colored green or red. Newer ones, called &quot;half-moons&quot;, have only the top half colored, while the bottom half is milky white; this is to provide more light. The half-colored globes have the same meanings as the globes with full colors. There are also some square lamps.

The meaning of the lights is poorly understood by passengers and was originally more complicated. Green, yellow, and red lights were introduced in 1982 to indicate the entrance&#x27;s availability, mostly to prevent muggings by warning riders away from entrances that were closed at night. Originally, green signified an entrance located at a full-time station booth, which was open 24/7 and had regular waist-high turnstiles. Yellow signified a part-time booth, to which access to the platforms could be gained using High Entry-Exit Turnstiles (HEETs). Red signified an exit-only. This proved too complicated and yellow was dropped in the early 1990s. Red globes now indicate both part-time entrance or exit-only. A joke when the system was introduced was that &quot;green meant go in, red meant don&#x27;t. And yellow meant to take a cab.&quot; (NYC medallion taxis are yellow).

With the introduction of the MetroCard in 1994, the MTA converted many previous exit-only entrances to full-time entrances via HEETs. The introduction of half-colored globes further confused riders of the subway system, and as of a 2002 survey, the globe lamps are poorly understood.

=== Concourse ===

Many stations in the subway system have mezzanines. In underground stations, this typically consists of the first level below the street or the areas between the street and platform level. For open-cut, grade-level and elevated stations, prevalent in uptown Manhattan and the outer boroughs, the mezzanine area often consists of a station house at street level or above the street. Mezzanines allow for passengers to enter from multiple locations at an intersection and proceed to the correct platform without having to cross the street before entering. At busy intersections, they act as a pedestrian underpass or overpass.

They also allow for crossover between uptown and downtown trains on side platforms or a pair of island platforms, which is very useful when local tracks are closed for construction. Within the mezzanines are fare control areas, where passengers physically pay their fare to enter the subway system. In underground subway stations built close to ground level or under narrow streets, a characteristic of early IRT and BMT construction, the fare control area is at platform level with no mezzanine crossovers. Many elevated stations also have platform-level fare control with no common station house between directions of service.

Upon entering a station, passengers may use station booths, formerly known as token booths, or vending machines to buy their fare, which is stored in a MetroCard. Each station has at least one booth open 24/7, typically located at the busiest entrance. After swiping the card at a turnstile, customers enter the fare-controlled area of the station and continue to the platforms. Inside fare control are &quot;Off-Hours Waiting Areas&quot;, which consist of benches and are identified by a yellow sign.

For various reasons, including maintenance costs, decreases in ridership, along with crime and safety issues, many stations have fare control areas, mezzanine areas and entrances that have been closed. Many mezzanines that previously stretched the entire length of a station have been split or partitioned by fencing or permanent walls. These closed areas have been abandoned or converted into space for Transit Operations or the New York City Police Department.
=== Facilities and amenities ===

==== Air conditioning ====

In August 2006, the MTA announced that all future subway stations, which include 34th Street–Hudson Yards, South Ferry, and all Second Avenue Subway stations, will have platforms outfitted with air-cooling systems. The existing Grand Central–42nd Street station also has these cooling systems; however, for the most part, subway stations lack air-cooling systems due to their expense, and only a few stations have ceiling fans.

==== Artwork ====
Many stations are decorated with intricate ceramic tile work, some of it dating back to 1904 when the subway first opened. The subway tile artwork tradition continues in a Percent for Art program.

The MTA Arts &amp; Design program oversees art in the subway system. Permanent installations, such as sculpture, mosaics, and murals; photographs displayed in lightboxes encourage people to use mass transit. In addition, commissioned art displayed in stations and &quot;art cards&quot;, some displaying poetry, are in many of the trains themselves in unused advertisement fixture slots. Some of the art is by internationally known artists such as Elizabeth Murray&#x27;s &quot;Blooming&quot;, displayed at Lexington Avenue/59th Street station.

==== Accessibility ====
Since the majority of the system was built before 1990, the year the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) went into effect, many New York City Subway stations were not designed to be handicapped-accessible. Since then, elevators have been built in newly constructed stations to comply with the ADA. Most grade-level stations required little modification to meet ADA standards. The MTA identified &quot;key stations&quot;, high-traffic and/or geographically important stations, which must conform to the ADA when they are extensively renovated. , out of total stations in the system, are accessible; many of them have AutoGate access.

Five stations on the Staten Island Railway are accessible. There are 16 more non-ADA-accessible stations with cross-platform interchanges, as well as other same-platform transfers, available, though the MTA notes that the gaps between train cars and platforms at these stations may nonetheless exceed the maximums established by the ADA.

==== Entertainment ====

While a permit is not required for performances in the subway, certain codes of conduct are required. Any musician/entertainer may perform in subway mezzanines and platforms. On platforms, there may be no amplifications as this is part of MTA policies: 

Performers must not be within of a token booth or from an MTA office/tower, blocking access to an escalator, stairwell, or elevator, interfering with transit services or passenger movement; or in an area where construction is occurring. In addition, performance is prohibited during public service announcements and may be no louder than 85 dBA at away or 70 dBa at from a token booth. Performances are prohibited in subway cars.

Since 1987, MTA has sponsored the &quot;Music Under New York&quot; (MUNY) program in which street musicians enter a competitive contest to be assigned to the preferred high traffic locations. Each year, applications are reviewed and approximately 70 eligible performers are selected and contacted to participate in live auditions held for one day. At present, more than 100 soloists and groups participate in MUNY providing over 150 weekly performances at 25 locations throughout the transit system, for example Natalia Paruz, a musical saw player, plays at Union Square. 
==== Restrooms ====
Restrooms are rare in the subway system. In 2010, there were 133 open restrooms in 81 of the system&#x27;s 468 stations. Most station restrooms previously open to the public have been closed and converted to storage spaces or employee use. There are a few major stations that have operating restrooms, including on the concourses of 42nd Street–Port Authority Bus Terminal, Chambers Street, 57th Street–Seventh Avenue, Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue, and Lexington Avenue/59th Street. The majority of restrooms in the New York City Subway are found in express and transfer stations, at ADA-accessible stations, and at terminals, though not all of the aforementioned types of stations have restrooms. Newer subway stations have restrooms, including 34th Street–Hudson Yards on the IRT Flushing Line and three Second Avenue Subway stations.

In the 2010s, the MTA planned to &quot;overhaul&quot; and reopen previously-closed restrooms. All of the system&#x27;s restrooms were closed in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. These restrooms remained closed in 2022, despite a drastic increase in the number of &quot;soiled train&quot; incidents, where human waste was found on trains. The MTA reopened restrooms at eight stations in January 2023. At the time, there were restrooms in 69 of the system&#x27;s 472 stations, and there were 163 total restrooms across the system. , there were 58 open bathrooms throughout the system.

==== Retail ====
Some platforms have newspaper stands that sell various items including newspapers and food. The MTA has installed retail spaces within paid areas in selected stations, including the station concourses of the Times Square–Port Authority complex, the 59th Street–Columbus Circle station, and the 47th–50th Streets–Rockefeller Center station.

In the 1980s, the MTA operated around 350 retail spaces in the subway system. During the 21st century, the MTA continued to make efforts in attracting more diverse retailers and vendors to set up shop in the subway system. , there are 111 newsstands in the system, including 20 that are vacant. This includes three empty stands on the Second Avenue Subway that opened that year. Many of the system&#x27;s stores closed during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. By 2024, only a little over one-quarter of storefronts (54 of 195 storefronts) still had tenants.

====Lighting====
The subway system originally used incandescent lights; the first incandescent bulbs were installed in 1904 as part of the first subway line. As many as 50 types of incandescent lights were once used in the subway. To discourage the theft of the lighting fixtures, the New York City Subway system used lightbulbs with reversed threads, which could not be screwed into residential lamps. Over the years, all incandescent bulbs in stations have been replaced with fluorescent lights. In 2024, the MTA announced that, as a safety measure, it would install 150,000 LED lights across the subway system by 2026. To discourage people from jumping onto the tracks, there are blue lights at several subway stations.

=== Connections ===
Rapid transit and rail connections are available at designated stations to Amtrak, Long Island Rail Road, AirTrain JFK, Metro-North Railroad, New Jersey Transit and PATH. Connections to the Staten Island Ferry and privately operated ferries such as NYC Ferry, NY Waterway and New York Water Taxi, as well as intercity and commuter bus lines at the Port Authority Bus Terminal and George Washington Bridge Bus Terminal, are also available. Free MetroCard-only transfers to buses are available to MTA New York City Transit buses (including the bus rapid transit Select Bus Service), MTA Bus Company, NICE buses (Nassau County) and Bee-Line buses (Westchester County).

===Station management===
In 2018, New York City Transit president Andy Byford implemented a &quot;group station manager&quot; program, where 24 people would be hired to oversee up to twenty-five stations. This replaced a previous system where station managers could be responsible for up to 100 stations. Group station managers were generally responsible for coordinating repairs and operations, as well as providing customer service in each of the stations under their purview. These group station managers repaired over 62,000 issues by early 2020.

== Station platforms and configurations ==

Out of the system&#x27;s stations, 283 are underground, 149 are elevated, 20 are in open cuts, 7 are at-grade, and 13 are on embankments.

A typical subway station has waiting platforms ranging from long. Some IND platforms may be as long as long. Platforms of former commuter rail stations, such as those on the IND Rockaway Line, are even longer. Due to the large number of transit lines, one platform or set of platforms often serves more than one service, unlike other rapid transit systems including the Paris Metro, but like some lines on the London Underground. A passenger needs to look at the signs hung at the platform entrance steps and over each track to see which trains stop there and when, and at the arriving train to see which train it is.

Almost everywhere express trains run, they run on the inner one (of 3) or two (of 4) tracks. Local trains run on the outer two tracks. In a 3-track configuration, the center track can be used toward the center of the city in the morning and away from the center in the evening, though not every 3-track line has that express service.

There are several common platform configurations:
* On a 2-track line, a station may have one center island platform used for trains in both directions, or 2 side platforms, one for a train in each direction.
* For a 3-track or 4-track line, local stops will have side platforms. The middle one or two tracks will not stop at the station.
* For most 3- or 4-track express stops, there will be two island platforms, one for the local and express in one direction, and another for the local and express in the other direction. Each island platform provides a cross-platform interchange between the local and express services.

In a few cases, a 4-track station has an island platform for the center express tracks and two side platforms for the outside local tracks. This occurs only at three stations near major railway stations where the next station along the line is also an express station with the more common platform configuration. The purpose of splitting the platforms is to limit overcrowding by preventing cross-platform interchanges between local and express services. The oldest station to be built with this layout is the Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center station on the IRT Eastern Parkway Line (), where the connection is to the Atlantic Terminal of the Long Island Rail Road, with an adjacent express station at Nevins Street.

The layout also exists at 34th Street–Penn Station on both the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line () and IND Eighth Avenue Line (), with adjacent express stations at Times Square–42nd Street and 42nd Street–Port Authority Bus Terminal, where the connection is to Pennsylvania Station, one of the two major New York City railway stations. This does not occur with the connection to New York&#x27;s other major station, Grand Central Terminal, at Grand Central on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line (), which has no adjacent express station.

There is one notable 6-track local station, DeKalb Avenue on the BMT Fourth Avenue Line. Trains to or from the Manhattan Bridge either stop at the outer tracks of the island platforms () or pass through and bypass the station on the middle tracks (&quot;bypass express tracks&quot;) (). Trains to or from the Montague Street Tunnel () stop across the platform from the respective outer track.

=== Stations with two levels ===

Some stations have two levels. The levels separate the platforms of different services and/or directions. For example:

* the local trains on one level and the express trains on another level
* trains of two different lines on two different levels
* trains of two different directions on two different levels, with a cross-platform interchange on each level
* trains of different services on two different levels that are on the same line


== List of stations ==

In addition to the main list detailing ridership and daytime services, the complete list of stations is also split by borough. The second column displays the number of stations as counted by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The third column shows the number of stations when &quot;station complexes&quot; are considered to be one station each.

== Station complexes ==
The New York City Subway has several types of transfer stations, among them station complexes (i.e. sets of two or more stations connected with a passageway inside fare control) and stations serving two or more lines (considered to be one station each). The table below only lists the station complexes. For a more detailed list see the main article.

<doc id="1015320" wikidata="Q692200" url="?curid=1015320" title="Sublingual gland">
<text>The sublingual gland (&quot;glandula sublingualis&quot;) is a seromucous polystomatic exocrine gland. Located underneath the oral diaphragm (&quot;diaphragma oris&quot;), the sublingual gland is the smallest and most diffuse of the three major salivary glands of the oral cavity, with the other two being the submandibular and parotid. The sublingual gland provides approximately 3-5% of the total salivary volume.

==Structure==
They lie anterior and superior to the submandibular gland and inferior and lateral to the tongue, as well as beneath the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth. They are bound laterally by the bone of the mandible and inferolaterally by the mylohyoid muscle. The glands can be felt behind each mandibular canine. Placing one index finger within the mouth and the fingertips of the opposite hand outside it, the compressed gland is manually palpated between the inner and outer fingers.

The sublingual gland is constituted by 1 major duct and approximately 20 small excretory ducts, with the latter often being referred to as &quot;ducts of Rivinus&quot;. The largest of all, the sublingual duct (of Bartholin) joins the submandibular duct to drain through the sublingual caruncle. The sublingual caruncle is a small papilla near the midline of the floor of the mouth on each side of the lingual frenum. Most of the remaining small sublingual ducts (of Rivinus) open separate into the mouth on an elevated crest of mucous membrane, the plica sublingualis (aka &quot;sublingual fold&quot;), formed by the gland and located on either side of the frenulum linguae. 

===Microanatomy===
The sublingual gland consists mostly of mucous acini capped with serous demilunes and is therefore categorized as a mixed mucous gland with a mucous product predominating. Striated and intercalated ducts are also present.

===Blood supply===
The gland receives its blood supply from the sublingual and submental arteries. Lymph from the sublingual salivary gland drains into the submandibular lymph nodes.

===Nerve supply===
The chorda tympani nerve (from the facial nerve via the submandibular ganglion) is secretomotor and provides parasympathetic supply to the sublingual glands. The path of the nerve is as follows: junction between pons and medulla, through internal acoustic meatus and facial canal to chorda tympani, through middle ear cavity, out petrotympanic fissure to join the lingual nerve, travels with lingual nerve to synapse at the submandibular ganglion, then postganglionic fibers travels to the sublingual gland.

===Development===
The sublingual salivary glands appear in the eighth week of prenatal development, two weeks later than the other two major salivary glands. They develop from epithelial buds in the sulcus surrounding the sublingual folds on the floor of the mouth, lateral to the developing submandibular gland. These buds branch and form into cords that canalize to form the sublingual ducts associated with the gland. The rounded terminal ends of the cords form acini.

==Clinical significance==

Ranulas are the most common pathologic lesion associated with the sublingual glands.

<doc id="1015324" wikidata="Q244545" url="?curid=1015324" title="Zwickau prophets">
<text>The Zwickau prophets (, ) were three men of the Radical Reformation from Zwickau in the Electorate of Saxony in the Holy Roman Empire who were possibly involved in a disturbance in nearby Wittenberg and its evolving Reformation in early 1522.

The three men – Nikolaus Storch, Thomas Dreschel, and Markus Stübner – began their movement in Zwickau. Though these three names are favored in recent scholarship, others have been suggested. Lars Pederson Qualben used the name &quot;Marx&quot; for &quot;Dreschel&quot;, and Henry Clay Vedder replaced Dreschel with Marcus Thomä (William Roscoe Estep gave Stübner the middle name &quot;Thomas&quot;.).

The relationship of the Zwickau Prophets to the Anabaptist movement has been variously interpreted. They have been viewed as a precursory foundation of Anabaptism before the rise of the Swiss Brethren in 1525, as unrelated to the movement except for the influence on Thomas Müntzer and as being a dual foundation with the Swiss Brethren to form a composite movement of Anabaptism. Regardless of the exact relationship to Anabaptism, the Zwickau Prophets presented a radical alternative to Martin Luther and mainstream Protestantism as demonstrated in their involvement in disturbances in Wittenberg.

==Theology==
Perhaps the most distinctive feature of the Zwickau Prophets was their spiritualism, which was that direct revelations from the Holy Spirit, not Scripture, were their authority in theological matters. Another highly distinctive feature was their opposition to infant baptism, but the Zwickau Prophets do not seem to have departed from theory to have taken the turn to practicing adult baptism of believers that would mark Anabaptism.

The Zwickau Prophets also held to imminent apocalypticism, which led them to believe that the end of days would come soon. They also possibly sought a Believers&#x27; Church, which would be separate from the state churches of Protestantism and Catholicism.

The Zwickau prophets were influenced by the Waldensians and the Taborites.

==Wittenberg==
The trio, having been exiled from Zwickau, arrived in Wittenberg on December 27, 1521. The men and their ideas had gained favor among Andreas Karlstadt and others who sought greater reforms in the city. Despite their acceptance among some, the Prophets&#x27; presence may have caused an unrest in the city that Philipp Melanchthon was unable to settle. Melanchthon turned to Martin Luther, who was at that time being held in protective custody at the Wartburg Castle, and at the behest of the Wittenberg town council, Luther returned to his reforming activities in Wittenberg on March 6, 1522.

Luther soon preached eight sermons against those he would label &quot;Schwärmer&quot; (&quot;Fanatics&quot;) and the force of these sermons was enough to calm the growing radicalism in the city. The Prophets then reportedly confronted Luther in order to assert the authority of the Spirit-mediated message over Luther and his gospel. Luther claimed to have demanded that they authenticate their message with a miracle, a sign which the men refused to give. The Prophets then denounced Luther and left Wittenberg.

==Müntzer==
Thomas Müntzer held two posts as preacher in Zwickau in 1520/21 and had contact with the Zwickau Prophets. While Müntzer may have associated himself for a time with them and held similar views to them in several areas of doctrine, this is not the same as Müntzer being a part of their group. As Vedder explained it, Müntzer was &quot;with&quot; the Prophets, but not &quot;of&quot; them. Some historians, however, have asserted that instead of the Zwickau Prophets and Müntzer being parallel with a mutual influence, Müntzer used the Prophets for his revolutionary ends.

== New explanation==
While the above narrative of the events of Wittenberg in early 1522 and the association of the Zwickau Prophets with them had become the standard textbook explanation of the case, Olaf Kuhr has proposed a new explanation for understanding the occasion. Referencing primary sources such as correspondences, Kuhr concludes that Dreschel and Storch left Wittenberg before January 1 and Stübner by January 6. With the former pair in Wittenberg for no more than four days and the latter for no more than ten, Kuhr questioned how great of an impact the Prophets could have had and if they were the source of the Wittenberg disturbances. Their absence would explain Qualben&#x27;s observation (noting that is named by Kuhr as holding to the older historiography) that Luther made no personal references to the Prophets in the eight sermons preached upon his return.

Kuhr also challenged the older explanation on the confrontation that the Prophets had with Luther. Kuhr concluded that the Prophets did not come to Luther as a group but had each approached Luther at various times in the following year during separate visits to Wittenberg. Luther&#x27;s account of the encounters, though appearing singular may have been a conflation of separate meetings, each meeting being similar enough for Luther to describe as one.

<doc id="1015326" wikidata="Q200887" url="?curid=1015326" title="Born into Trouble as the Sparks Fly Upward">
<text>Born into Trouble as the Sparks Fly Upward is the second album by the Canadian band The Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra &amp; Tra-La-La Band. It was released by Constellation Records in October 2001.

The title is drawn from the Book of Job: &quot;Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upwards&quot; (5:7). It could also be taken from Jerome K. Jerome&#x27;s &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot;, where the same passage is paraphrased.

&quot;This Gentle Hearts Like Shot Bird&#x27;s Fallen&quot; was used in the climax to the David Gordon Green film &quot;Snow Angels&quot;.

The album finds the band expanding from three members to six, with a similarly expanded name.

<doc id="1015327" wikidata="Q2273357" url="?curid=1015327" title="Lift (drink)">
<text>Lift is a range of soft drinks produced by The Coca-Cola Company that has been available in Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Germany, Austria, Philippines and Eastern Europe since the 1970s. It is carbonated and flavored with fruit juice. In Australia and New Zealand, a standard bottle of Lift is lemon flavoured, whereas in Germany and other markets the default flavour is Apple.

Lift Apple and Lift Lemon were previously part of eight international soda flavors featured and available for tasting at Club Cool in Epcot.

==History==
=== Australia and New Zealand ===
Lift was introduced in Australia and New Zealand in the 1990s as a replacement for the &quot;Mello Yello&quot; brand. &quot;Mello Yello&quot; had replaced &quot;Leed Lemon Soda Squash&quot; in the early 1980s, which was a variant of the &quot;Leed Lemonade&quot; brand. The only flavour in the Lift range (besides limited time flavours) was Lemon. In 2015 it was rebranded as Fanta Lemon Lift and then back to the original Lift in 2016 with a flavour change, supposedly making the drink more sour.

Lift was discontinued in the Australian market in September 2022 and replaced by a new lemon flavour of Sprite with caffeine, known as Sprite Lemon+. This flavour was announced by Coca-Cola Europacific Partners on 13 September 2022, following months of rumours on social media. Rumours also spread around this time claiming that Lift would be discontinued across New Zealand. As a result, Coca-Cola released a statement saying that it would not be discontinued in New Zealand.
=== Germany ===
Lift was originally introduced in Germany in 1974 with lemon juice.

In Germany, Lift Apfelschorle consists of 55% apple juice and water without additional flavouring. Variations include Lift Apfel and Grapefruit, which contains apple and grapefruit juice.

<doc id="1015328" wikidata="Q4955640" url="?curid=1015328" title="Braid (band)">
<text>Braid is an American emo band from Champaign, Illinois, formed in 1993. 

Following several early line-up changes, the band eventually settled on Bob Nanna on guitar and vocals, Todd Bell on bass, Chris Broach on guitar and vocals, and Roy Ewing on drums until he was replaced in 1997 by new drummer Damon Atkinson. 

In 1998 the group released their third album, &quot;Frame &amp; Canvas&quot;, to critical acclaim and is considered a staple of the late 1990s emo movement. Despite &quot;Frame &amp; Canvas&quot;&#x27;s success, Braid disbanded in 1999. Nanna, Bell, and Atkinson formed the more melodic Hey Mercedes, while Broach would dedicate more time to The Firebird Band which was previously a side project.

The band reunited shortly from June to August 2004, before disbanding again. In 2011, Braid reunited permanently, playing their 600th show and releasing a new album, &quot;No Coast&quot;.

==History==
===Formation: 1993===
In fall 1993, Bob Nanna was playing drums in a Chicago band called Friction who toured locally and opened for prominent bands like Jawbreaker. As Friction prepared to record their first album, Nanna left for college at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and was soon looking for another band as a side project. Nanna met drummer Roy Ewing when he placed an ad in Maximumrocknroll, looking for someone to trade live concert tapes with. Ewing played with Nanna&#x27;s high school friend, guitarist Pete Havranek, and Nanna became their singer and guitarist, with Jay Ryan joining them on bass and Kate Reuss on lead vocals. Nanna suggested the name Braid. 

Shortly after forming, Ryan left the band for various reasons and was replaced by Todd Bell, who had played with Ewing in a band called Lowercase N. Braid played their first show December 10, 1993, in Danville, Illinois. Two months later, Reuss left the band after they played their second show. Braid decided not to replace her, leaving Nanna as the lead singer. Nanna&#x27;s main band, Friction, broke up in July 1994 after a short tour, turning Braid from a side project into his main focus. 

With Nanna wary about his singing, Braid started looking for a new singer. They met Chris Broach when he attended one of their shows and invited him to sing with the band. Around this time the rest of the band decided to fire Havranek, citing creative differences, so Broach was moved guitar and second vocals.

===First recordings and national tour: 1994–1997===
In September, Braid recorded three songs for their first release. The &quot;Rainsnowmatch&quot; 7-inch came out in December on Enclave Records. While Rainsnowmatch was being released, the band began recording their debut album. &quot;Frankie Welfare Boy Age 5&quot; was released in June 1995 on Divot Records. With a huge backlog of written material, Braid continued to write and record songs for various compilation appearances and 7-inch releases.

Starting in July 1995, Braid began their first national tour. They played traditional venues, such as bars and clubs, but also booked shows in the homes of fans and VFW halls. Whenever there was a break in touring, Braid booked recording sessions and began work on their second album. In July 1996, &quot;The Age of Octeen&#x27; was released on Mud Records. Also in 1996, the &quot;I&#x27;m Afraid of Everything&quot; 7-inch was released on the band&#x27;s own label, Grand Theft Autumn.

By 1997, touring schedules had begun to take their toll on Ewing, who in March decided to leave the band. With Ewing&#x27;s blessing, Damon Atkinson became the band&#x27;s drummer and joined them on their spring tour. That spring also saw Nanna graduate from college, allowing them to become a full-time band. Braid celebrated their new freedom by going on a headlining tour of Europe, with their friends The Get Up Kids opening. However, after the first night, the two bands decided to switch the playing order because of the popularity of The Get Up Kids in Europe. After the European tour, Braid returned to the North America for another tour of the U.S. and Canada.

===&quot;Frame and Canvas&quot;: 1998===
In late 1997, Braid recorded their third LP &quot;Frame &amp; Canvas&quot; at Inner Ear Studios with producer J. Robbins. The album was released by Polyvinyl Records in April 1998, receiving critical acclaim and brought Braid greater exposure, eventually being regarded as one of the most influential bands of the 1990s emo movement. With the release of &quot;Frame &amp; Canvas&quot;, they embarked on a tour of the East Coast with Compound Red, followed by a run along the West Coast with the Get Up Kids, a jaunt to Canada with Discount, and a European tour with Burning Airlines.

The band also played a number of dates with All and Less Than Jake. Jawbox bassist Kim Coletta became the band&#x27;s manager. 

===Final recordings and disbandment: 1998–1999===
Braid set off on an ill-fated tour of Japan and Hawaii in April 1999. Due to lower-than-expected turnout, the band failed to recoup their losses and had to spend the rest of their revenue from previous tours, causing rifts to form within the band. After returning to the United States, Atkinson, Bell, and Nanna set off to play Krazy Fest in Louisville, Kentucky, while Broach chose to make the drive separately. Broach was late for their set, and though Braid were allowed to play the following day, this caused more conflict amongst the band members.

Soon after, Braid began work on a demo for a potential new record, but tensions surfaced by the time they finished mixing the last song of the session. After a band meeting, Nanna, Broach, Bell, and Atkinson decided to call it quits.

Braid decided to hold four final concerts in August to say goodbye to their fans. They scheduled one show in Milwaukee, two in Chicago at The Metro, and the final concert was held in their home town of Champaign where Roy Ewing played a few songs with the band.

After their final show, Braid had several post-breakup releases in 2000. A recording of their final four shows called &quot;Killing a Camera&quot; was released on VHS. A live album, from the final sold-out show at The Metro called &quot;Lucky to Be Alive&quot; was also released. Polyvinyl released a double-disc collection of non-album tracks called &quot;Movie Music, Vol. 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;.

Following the disbandment, the members played in new musical projects. Shortly after Braid&#x27;s break up, Nanna, Bell, and Atkinson reunited to form the pop rock band Hey Mercedes with Mark Dawursk on guitar. In addition to this, Nanna started a solo project under the name The City on Film. Chris Broach worked with his brother Riley in The Firebird Band, previously a side-project, and in 2001 he would also play with L&#x27;Spaerow and start Lucid Records.

===First reunion: 2004===
In 2004, Hey Mercedes suffered problems with tour cancellations and Chris Broach was in between projects. In February 2004, Braid decided to reunite to coincide with the DVD release of &quot;Killing a Camera&quot; was reissued on DVD in May 2004. They went on a tour of the US in June and July, with Minus the Bear, Murder by Death, Recover, and Mock Orange. Following, they went by a short tour of Japan for the rest of August. After these tours were completed, Braid amicably disbanded again.

===Second reunion and &quot;No Coast&quot;: 2011–present===
On January 25, 2011 it was announced on Punknews.org that Braid were reuniting permanently to record a new 12-inch for Polyvinyl Records. On May 4, 2011, the band announced their first comeback show since 2004 at the Metro on August 27, 2011 and would also play at Pygmalion Music Festival on September 24, 2011, part of the Polyvinyl Records fifteenth anniversary celebration.

On June 10, 2011, the band released a song titled &quot;The Right Time&quot;, the first from their forthcoming EP, and gave the entire EP to people who pre-ordered on the Polyvinyl web store. The new EP titled &quot;Closer to Closed&quot;, their first release in 11 years, was released on August 16, 2011, to mixed reviews.

December 22, 2011 was Braid&#x27;s 600th show. The event, held at Turner Hall Ballroom in Milwaukee, was a Toys for Tots benefit show. Event-goers who brought a new, unwrapped toy would receive a commemorative poster. Braid shared the night with Smoking Popes and in addition to announcing further touring, a new release was announced.

On April 6, 2012, the band announced that they were going to play at the acclaimed Gainesville, Florida festival, The Fest. On August 10, 2012, Braid played at Union Transfer in Philadelphia, PA with polyvinyl label mate Owen. On November 3, 2012, Braid played two shows as a part of the 2012 Fun Fun Fun Fest in Austin, Texas.

On September 18, 2013, Braid announced that they had signed with Topshelf Records as well as the release of a new studio album in 2014. It was revealed on March 24, 2014 that the album was mastered and completed. The album, &quot;No Coast&quot;, was released on July 8, 2014 (their first LP in 16 years) to positive reviews.

Though they did not formally disband again, the band went inactive until February 2023 when they announced a 25th-anniversary remaster of &quot;Frame &amp; Canvas&quot; and an accompanying U.S. tour with the album being played in full, mostly taking place in September. On September 15th, 2023, Braid performed at Riot Fest, playing &quot;Frame and Canvas&quot; in its entirety.

== Musical style and influences ==
Braid&#x27;s music has been described as post-hardcore, post-punk, punk rock, emo, Midwest emo, and math rock. Braid have cited numerous bands as influences, including Gauge, Shudder to Think, Fugazi, Jawbreaker, Jawbox, Samiam, Hoover, and Indian Summer.

Braid are known for putting on a high-energy live show. Get Up Kids frontman Matt Pryor has described their performance style as &quot;[e]nergetic, but that’s underselling it. They come from a Fugazi school of punk performance. A lot of jumping, landing in weird places. A lot of disregard for the safety of your body.&quot;

<doc id="1015331" wikidata="Q665328" url="?curid=1015331" title="Bat bomb">
<text>Bat bombs were an experimental World War II weapon developed by the United States. The bomb consisted of a bomb-shaped casing with over a thousand compartments, each containing a hibernating Mexican free-tailed bat with a small, timed incendiary bomb attached. Dropped from a bomber at dawn, the casings would deploy a parachute in mid-flight and open to release the bats, which would then disperse and roost in eaves and attics in a . The incendiaries, which were set on timers, would then ignite and start fires in inaccessible places in the largely wood and paper constructions of the Japanese cities that were the weapon&#x27;s intended target. The United States Navy took control in August 1943, using the code name ProjectX-Ray.

==Conception==
The bat bomb was conceived by Lytle S. Adams (1881–1970), a dental surgeon from Irwin, Pennsylvania, who was an acquaintance of First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. The inspiration for Adams&#x27; suggestion was a trip he took to Carlsbad Caverns National Park, which is home to many bats. Adams wrote about his idea of incendiary bats in a letter to the White House in January 1942—little more than a month after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Adams was intrigued by the strength of bats and knew that they roosted before dawn. He also knew that most of the buildings in Tokyo were constructed of wood instead of concrete. He believed that if time-release incendiaries could be attached to bats, some kind of container holding them could be dropped over the city after dark and the bats would simply roost and burn Tokyo to the ground. The plan was subsequently approved by President Roosevelt on the advice of Donald Griffin.
In his letter, Adams stated that the bat was the &quot;lowest form of animal life&quot;, and that, until now, &quot;reasons for its creation have remained unexplained&quot;. He went on to espouse that bats were created &quot;by God to await this hour to play their part in the scheme of free human existence, and to frustrate any attempt of those who dare desecrate our way of life.&quot;
Of Adams, Roosevelt remarked, &quot;This man is not a nut. It sounds like a perfectly wild idea but is worth looking into.&quot;

==After government approval==

After Roosevelt gave the project his approval, it was relegated to the authority of the United States Army Air Force. Adams assembled the workers for the project, including the mammalogist Jack von Bloeker, actor Tim Holt, a former gangster, and a former hotel manager, among others. Von Bloeker, his assistant, Jack Couffer, and Ozro Wiswell, a scientist, self-described &quot;bat lovers&quot;, noted that it did not occur to them to question the &quot;morality or the ecological consequences of sacrificing a few million bats&quot;. For the duration of the project, many members enlisted in the Air Force, where Adams quickly promoted them to &quot;acting&quot; non-commissioned officers.

The team had to determine several variables to make the project feasible, including what kind of incendiaries could be attached to the bats, as well as the temperatures at which to store and transport them. The bats had to be kept in hibernation while they were shipped. To accomplish this, they were stuck in ice cube trays and cooled. They also had to decide what species of bat to use for the bombs. After testing several species, the Mexican free-tailed bat was selected. Adams had to ask for permission from the National Park Service to harvest large numbers of Mexican free-tailed bats from caves on government property. While the original plan was to arm the bats with white phosphorus, American chemist Louis Fieser joined the team and white phosphorus was replaced with his invention, napalm.

Tests were used to determine how much napalm an individual bat could carry, determining that a bat could carry a payload of . The napalm was stored in small cellulose containers dubbed &quot;H-2 units&quot;. After trying several attachment methods, they decided to attach the H-2 unit to the bats using an adhesive, gluing them to the front of the bats.

The bomb carrier was a sheet metal tube approximately in length. The inside of the tube was fitted with twenty-six circular trays, each of which was in diameter. In total, each bomb carrier could hold 1,040 bats. It was planned that the carrier would be deployed from an airplane, descending to an altitude of before deploying parachutes. The sides of the bomb carrier would then fall away, allowing the bats to disperse.

==Setbacks and transfer to US Navy==

A series of tests to answer various operational questions were conducted. In one incident, the Carlsbad Army Airfield Auxiliary Air Base () near Carlsbad, New Mexico, was set on fire on 15 May 1943, when armed bats were accidentally released. The bats roosted under a fuel tank and incinerated the test range.

Following this setback, the project was relegated to the Navy in August 1943, who renamed it &quot;Project X-Ray&quot;, and then passed it to the Marine Corps that December. The Marine Corps moved operations to the Marine Corps Air Station at El Centro, California. After several experiments and operational adjustments, the definitive test was carried out on the &quot;Japanese Village&quot;, a mockup of a Japanese city built by the Chemical Warfare Service at their Dugway Proving Ground test site in Utah.

Observers at this test witnessed optimistic accounts. The chief of incendiary testing at Dugway wrote:

The National Defense Research Committee observer stated: &quot;It was concluded that X-Ray is an effective weapon.&quot; The chief chemist&#x27;s report stated that, on a weight basis, X-Ray was more effective than the standard incendiary bombs in use at the time: &quot;Expressed in another way, the regular bombs would give probably 167 to 400 fires per bomb load where X-Ray would give 3,625 to 4,748 fires.&quot;

More tests were scheduled for mid-1944, but the program was canceled by Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King when he heard that it would likely not be combat ready until mid-1945. By that time, it was estimated that $2 million (equivalent to $ million in 2024) had been spent on the project. It is thought that development of the bat bomb was moving too slowly, and was overtaken in the race for a quick end to the war by the atomic bomb project. Adams maintained that the bat bombs would have been effective without the devastating effects of the atomic bomb: &quot;Think of thousands of fires breaking out simultaneously over a circle of in diameter for every bomb dropped. Japan could have been devastated, yet with small loss of (American) lives.&quot;

The infamous &quot;Invasion by Bats&quot; project was afterwards referred to by Stanley P. Lovell, director of research and development for Office of Strategic Services, whom General William J. Donovan ordered to review the idea, as &quot;Die Fledermaus Farce&quot;.

Lovell had also mentioned bats, during testing, were dropping to the ground like stones.

<text>Zita (27 April 1272), also known as Sitha or Citha, is an Italian saint, the patron saint of maids and domestic servants. She is often appealed to in order to help find lost keys. 

Zita entered domestic service at the age of 12, and served the same family for almost 50 years. Through her diligence and fidelity, she became a trusted and valued servant. She spent her days doing ordinary things extraordinarily well. Zita was known for her kindness and generosity to the poor.

== Life ==
Zita was born in Tuscany in Monte Sagrati, a village not far from Lucca. Her parents were Giovanni and Buonissima Lombardo. Her maternal uncle, Graziano, was a hermit who dwelt on a neighbouring mountain where he had built a church and a shelter for travellers. 

At the age of 12, Zita became a servant in the household of the Fatinellis, a well-to-do family of silk merchants. Signora Fatinelli allowed Zita to attend school for a year and then put her to be trained under an older maid. The other servants did not care for Zita. They interpreted her piety as posturing, her submissiveness as stupidity.

By her meek and humble self-restraint, Zita succeeded in overcoming the malice of her fellow-servants. She gave a third of her wages to her parents, kept a third, and gave the rest to the poor. The mistress of the house placed Zita in charge of the household almsgiving, and allowed her to visit the sick poor in their own homes and tend to their needs. A small room isolated from the rest of the house was put at Zita&#x27;s disposal. She would venture out in the evenings and invite poor homeless women to supper. The room, which had a bed, was offered as safe shelter for the night.

She always rose hours before the rest of the family and took care to hear Mass every morning before she began work. She attended to her tasks with diligence and fidelity, and studied when possible to anticipate what needed to be done. Signora Fatinelli&#x27;s dying wish was that Zita be placed in charge of the household. She continued to serve the family after the death of Guglielmo Fatinelli in 1260, when his son Pagano became the head of the family.

== Legends associated with the saint==

Zita is sometimes depicted in art carrying bread for the poor in her cloak. Jealous servants reported this to the master, who confronted her. Upon opening the cloak, however, it was found to be full of flowers. A similar tale is told of Elizabeth of Hungary. Zita gave away her own food during a famine, and then gave away food belonging to her master. When he remonstrated with her, the pantry was discovered to be fully stocked. 

There are various versions of the miracle of the loaves. On one morning, Zita left her chore of baking bread either to tend to someone in need (or was deep in prayer in her room). She returned to find loaves all ready set and prepared in the kneading-trough (or already baked). Neither the other servants nor the mistress knew who had prepared the bread, so it was commonly attributed to angels.

On another occasion, Zita was returning from distributing alms when she encountered a beggar. Having nothing left to give him, she accompanied him to the village well to draw him a cool drink. She let a copper jug down into the well, and in the act of holding it out to him, made the sign of the cross over the water, praying that this drink might be blessed to the poor wayfarer. As he made to drink, he found that the water had turned into wine.

== Death and veneration==

Zita died peacefully in the Fatinelli house on April 27, 1272, aged 60. It is said that a star appeared above the attic where she slept at the moment of her death. She had served and edified the family for 48 years, and had become practically venerated by the family. After 150 miracles had been attributed to Zita&#x27;s intercession and recognized by the church, she was canonized in 1696. Soon after Zita&#x27;s death a popular cult grew up around her, centering on the Basilica of San Frediano in Lucca.Each year on April 27, the people of Lucca bake bread and bring flowers to San Frediano in celebration of her feast day.
Zita was exhumed in 1580, and discovered to be incorrupt. The body is on display for public veneration in the Basilica di San Frediano in Lucca.

Guilds were established in St Zita&#x27;s honour to provide homes for servants who were temporarily out of work, to care for those aged or incurably ill, and to provide terms of long service. 

During the late medieval era, St Zita&#x27;s popular cult had grown throughout Europe. In England she was known as &quot;Sitha&quot;, and was popularly invoked by maidservants and housewives, particularly in event of having lost keys, or when crossing rivers or bridges. Images of St Zita exist in churches across southern England. However, despite the gaining popularity, especially amongst women at this time, the cult was not an official one.

Pope Leo X sanctioned a liturgical cult within the church in the early 16th century, which was confirmed upon her canonization in 1696 by Pope Innocent XII. In 1748, Pope Benedict XIV added her name to the Roman Martyrology.

In 2022, Zita was officially added to the Episcopal Church liturgical calendar with a feast day on 27 April.

== Patronage and legacy ==
Zita is the patron saint of domestic workers, housekeepers, waitresses, and household chores. Her feast day in the Roman Catholic Church is 27 April. From 1890 to 2000 St. Zita&#x27;s Home for Friendless Women in Manhattan provided food, clothing, shelter, and job training for destitute women.

<text>Kalinga is a historical region of India. It is generally defined as the eastern coastal region between the Ganges and the Godavari rivers, although its boundaries have fluctuated with the territory of its rulers. The core territory of Kalinga now encompasses all of Odisha and some part of northern Andhra Pradesh. At its widest extent, the Kalinga region also included parts of present-day Chhattisgarh, extending up to Amarkantak in the west. In the ancient period it extended until the bank of the Ganges river.

The Kalingas have been mentioned as a major tribe in the legendary text &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. In the 3rd century BCE, the region came under Mauryan control as a result of the Kalinga War. It was subsequently ruled by several regional dynasties whose rulers bore the title &quot;Kalingādhipati&quot; (&quot;Lord of Kalinga&quot;); these dynasties included Mahameghavahana, Vasishtha, Mathara, Pitrbhakta, Shailodbhava, Somavamshi, and Eastern Ganga. The medieval era rulers to rule over the Kalinga region were the Suryavamsa Gajapatis, Bhoi dynasty, Paralakhemundi Gangas and the zamindaris of Ganjam and Vizagapatam.

The Kalinga region is generally defined as the eastern coastal region between Ganges and the Godavari rivers. However, its exact boundaries have fluctuated at various times in the history. According to political scientist Sudama Misra, the Kalinga janapada originally comprised the area covered by the Puri and Ganjam districts. Confirming the existence till the river Ganga DK Ganguly used references from accounts of Pliny and the Mahabharata. He wrote &quot; Pliny has evidently made an unnecessary duplication. Unfortunately the identification of these tribes and their location are rendered difficult by the nature of the description which appears to be erroneous and confusing. Pliny was guided by his notion about the existence of more than one Kalinga settlement from which the Indian writers are also not completely free. But the above account of Pliny is important for it shows that Kalinga extended in the north-east up to the Ganges. That the territory of the Kalingas stretched onwards from the Ganges seems to be corroborated by the following passages of the Trithyatra section of the Vanaparvam.&quot; Scholars like RC Majumdar mentions Kalinga was from Mahanadi to Godavari. However the simple mention of Ganga as the northern boundary of Kalinga by Pliny as stated above and Mahabharata talking about Baitarani, a river which is north of Mahanadi and borders Odisha and Jharkhand at one point and falls into Bay of Bengal in Bhadrak district of Odisha, passing through Kalinga, nullifies this claim. It looks like Prof. Majumdar has focused Gupta period when Kalinga indeed had shrunk till Mahanadi in north. Some Jain chronicles while describing about Jain Tirthankara Pasvanath notes, when he came to Kalinga to preach Jainism, he took rest in a place in Balasore district of Odisha. Balasore is north of Baitarani river and borders Bengal. This also confirms Kalinga extending north of Baitarani River.

In the ancient Indian literature, the Kalinga region is associated with the Mahendragiri mountain located in the Ganjam district of Odisha, near its border with Andhra Pradesh.

At times, the southern border of Kalinga extended further up to the Krishna River. The Kalinga region encompass the whole of present-day Odisha: the north-eastern part of Odisha was included in the distinct Utkala region. Utkala gradually lost its identity, and came to be considered as a part of Kalinga. In the Adiparva of Mahabharata it is mentioned that Arjuna moved to Kalinga crossing Ganga. Interestingly, it distinguishes Kalinga from Mahendragiri. That means only north of Mahendragiri till Ganga river was considered Kalinga then. Arjuna was moving from north to south in the eastern part of India. Adiparva mentions he moved from Gaya and Ganga then came to Anga, Vanga and Kalinga. In the Gupta period Kalinga was subdivided into smaller countries. After the decline of Guptas, the Matharas were one of the kingdoms who claimed to rule over Kalinga by acquiring the title of &quot;Kalingādhipati&quot;. The Mathara territory stretched from &quot;Mahanadi&quot;, which is believed to be Badanadi or Bara river in Southern Ganjam(literally meaning &quot;big river&quot;, same as Mahanadi, Badanadi or Badanai was also locally called Mahanadi until 20th century) in the north to Godavari in south along the east coast, since all the inscriptions by them and the localities mentioned in them were within these two rivers. Like the Matharas, the Pitrbhaktas and subsequently the early Eastern Gangas continued to use the title of &quot;Kalingādhipati&quot; ruling over the same region. The Vigrahas of South Toshali whose territory comprised the region south of Mahanadi also claimed to rule over &quot;Kalinga-rashtra&quot; (&quot;Kalinga kingdom&quot;). The Vigrahas were ousted by Mudgalas of North Toshali or Utkala by 603-4 CE who themselves were invaded by Shashanka. The Shailodbhavas who emerged as &quot;Maha-Samanta&quot; of Shashanka declared themselves independent after 620 CE and acquired the title of &quot;Sakala-Kalingādhipati&quot; (&quot;Lord of whole of Kalinga&quot;). The Bhauma-Karas took over the Shailodbhava territory and made the Eastern-Gangas their feudatories,
and the Somavamshis under Janmejaya made inroads into the Bhauma-Kara kingdom up to coastal Odisha and acquired the title of &quot;Trikalingādhipati&quot; (&quot;Lord of the three Kalingas&quot;). The Gajapati Empire of Odisha in 15-16th century was known as Kalinga in some of the contemporary sources.

The eastern boundary of Kalinga was formed by the sea (the Bay of Bengal). Its western boundary is difficult to pinpoint, as it varied with the political power of its rulers. However, the Puranic literature suggests that Kalinga extended up to the Amarakantaka hills in the west.

Several ancient inscriptions mention the term &quot;Trikalinga&quot;, which has been interpreted in several ways. According to one theory, Trikalinga refers to the widest extent of Kalinga. However, the Eastern Chalukya records suggest that Kalinga and Trikalinga were two distinct regions, with Trikalinga denoting the hilly region to the west of Kalinga.

Some scholars have misinterpreted the text of Mahabharata and have said river Vaitarani was the northern border of Kalinga. However the text says river Vaitarani passes through Kalinga and Pandavas came to Kalinga after crossing Ganga. Therefore, this assumption is wrong. In the south it was bounded by the country of the Āndhras, although its southern border varied often and reached Elamanchili and Cheepurupalli in the Visakhapatnam district or even Piṣṭapura or Pithapuram to the north-east of the Godāvarī river, although it did not reach the river itself, which was in Āndhra territory. On the west, Kaliṅga had established its suzerainty over the tribes in inland hills so that its authority reached till the Amarakaṇṭaka range.

== History ==

=== Antiquity ===
The name of the region is derived from a tribe of the same name. According to the legendary text &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the progenitors of the Kalingas and of their neighbouring tribes were brothers. These neighbours included the Angas, the Vangas, the Pundras, and the Suhmas.

The Kalingas occupied the extensive territory stretching from river &quot;Baitarani&quot; in Odisha to the &quot;Varahanandi&quot; in the Visakhapatnam district. Its capital in the ancient times was the city of &quot;Dantakura&quot; or Dantapura (now &quot;Dantavaktra&quot; fort near Chicacole in the Srikakulam district, washed by the river &quot;Languliya&quot; or &quot;Langulini&quot;).

The kingdom of Kaliṅga was already existent at the time of the Brahmana texts, which mention its king Karaṇḍu as a contemporary of Nagnajit of Gāndhāra and of Bhīma of Vidarbha.

According to the , the king Sattabhu of Kaliṅga was a contemporary of Reṇu of Videha and Dhataraṭṭha or Dhṛtarāṣṭra of Kāsī.

Kaliṅga was mentioned by both Pāṇini and Baudhāyana, with the latter considering it as an part of Bharata Khanda.

=== Ancient Kalinga: Kalinga kingdom (c. 1100 – 261 BCE) ===

=== Pre-classical Kalinga ===

==== Annexation by Nanda Empire (c. 345 – 322 BCE) ====
Kalinga was believed to be briefly annexed by Nanda ruler Mahapadma Nanda between 345 to 340 BCE.

The Nanda empire appears to have stretched from present-day Punjab in the west to Odisha &quot;(Kalinga)&quot; in the east. Nandas control of Kalinga region is corroborated by the Hathigumpha inscription of the later king Kharavela (c. 2nd or 1st century BCE).

When Chandragupta Maurya rebelled against the Nandas, Kalingas broke away from the empire of Magadha in 322 BCE.

==== Hathigumpha Inscription of Kalinga ====
The Hathigumpha inscription suggests that a king named Nandaraja had excavated an aqueduct there in the past. Assuming that Nandaraja refers to a king of the Nanda dynasty, it appears that the Kalinga region was annexed by the Nandas at some point. It appears to have become independent again after the fall of the Nandas. It is described as &quot;Calingae&quot; in Megasthenes&#x27; &quot;Indica&quot; (3rd century BCE):

==== Kalinga War and annexation by Maurya Empire (c. 261 – 225 BCE) ====


Ashoka invaded Kalinga in 261 BCE and re-annexed into Magadha Empire.
After the final battle near the Dhauli hills, the capital Tosali fell to the Mauryas where the headquarters of the Mauryan province of Kalinga was also located.
Kalinga broke away from the Mauryan empire during the rule of Dasharatha in 224 BCE.

==== Mahameghavahana Empire (c. 224 BCE – 250 CE) ====


After the decline of the Mauryan Empire, the region came under the control of the Mahameghavahana family, whose king Kharavela described himself as the &quot;supreme Lord of Kalinga&quot;. Kharavela was the greatest ruler of empire who ruled during the second or first century BCE and the primary source for his reign is sourced from the rock-cut Hathigumpha inscription. The inscription describes yearly records of his reign and also credits him with public infrastructure projects, welfare activities, patronage of the arts, and many military victories and also patronising religions such as Jainism while the inscription also describes him as a devotee of all religions.

=== Post-classical Kalinga ===

==== Gupta Empire ====


Kalinga came under Gupta suzerainty in the 4th century CE. After the Gupta withdrawal, it was ruled by several minor dynasties, whose rulers bore the title &quot;Kalingadhipati&quot; (&quot;Lord of Kalinga&quot;). These included the Matharas, Pitrbhaktas, Vasishthas and Nalas. They were followed by the Shailodbhavas and the early Eastern Gangas.

==== Shailodbhava dynasty ====
In the 7th century, the Shailodbhavas ruled parts of eastern India and their core territory was known as Kongoda-mandala, and included parts of the present-day Ganjam, Khordha and Puri districts. King Madhavaraja II claimed the title &quot;Sakala-Kalingadhipati&quot; (&quot;the lord of the entire Kalinga&quot;). During the 8th–10th centuries, the Bhauma-Kara dynasty ruled the region, although they called their kingdom &quot;Tosala&quot; (derived from Tosali, the ancient capital of Kalinga).

====Somavamshi or Keshari dynasty====
The Somavamshis ruled parts of present-day Odisha in eastern India between the 9th and the 12th centuries with their capitals included Yayatinagara and Abhinava-Yayatinagara (modern Jajpur). They ruled the Dakshina Kosala region claiming the title &quot;Kosalendra&quot; (&quot;lord of Kosala&quot;), following which they conquered the Kalinga and the Utkala regions in present-day Odisha, succeeding the Bhauma-Karas. Thus they called themselves the lord of Kalinga, Kosala, and Utkala. They also introduced a new style of art and architecture in Odisha.

===Medieval Kalinga===

==== Eastern Ganga Dynasty ====
During the 11th–15th century, the Eastern Gangas became the dominant power in the region, and bore the title &quot;Kalingadhipati&quot;. After succeeding the Somavanshis, they assumed various titles viz. &quot;Trikalingadhipathi&quot; or &quot;Sakala Kalingadhipathi&quot; (Lord of three Kalinga or all three Kalingas namely Kalinga proper (South), Utkala (North), and Dakshina Kosala (West)). Their capital was originally located at Kalinganagara (modern Mukhalingam), and was later transferred to Kataka (modern Cuttack) during the reign of Anantavarman Chodaganga in the 12th century. He also built the famous Jagannath Temple at Puri.

Following repeated invasions from the northern regions, Narasimhadeva I, the son of Anangabhima Deva III, invaded southern Bengal in 13th cen., defeated its ruler, captured the capital (Gauda), and built the Sun Temple at Konark to commemorate his victory. Narasimhadeva I was also the first king to use the title of Gajapati or &quot;Lord of war elephants&quot; or &quot;King with an army of elephants&quot; among the Odishan kings in the 1246 CE inscription at the Kapilash Temple. With the death of Narasimha in 1264, the Eastern Gangas began to decline and were succeeded by the Suryavamsi Gajapatis in 1434.

====Gajapati Empire====
The last Eastern Ganga ruler Bhanudeva IV was dethroned by Kapilendra Deva in 1435. This event marked the foundation of the Gajapati Empire that ruled over the regions of Utkala (North Odisha) and Kalinga (South Odisha, North Andhra Pradesh). Prataparudra Deva was the last great king of the Suryavamsi Gajapatis.

====Bhoi Dynasty====

After the death of Prataprudra Deva in 1540 his sons Kalua Deva and Khakura Deva were made kings and later assassinated by their minister Govinda Vidyadhara laying the foundation of the Bhoi dynasty. They could only control the Odisha coast, the interior regions fell under the Garhjat Kings.

====Eastern Chalukya dynasty of Mukunda Deva====
Mukunda Deva who traced his descent from the Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi rebelled and killed the last two successors of the Bhoi dynasty and declared himself an independent ruler in 1559 on Northern Odisha coast over the Bhoi dynasty&#x27;s territories but Sulaiman Khan Karrani formed a kingdom in the region of Bengal which proved a potential threat to Mukunda Deva. The fall of the Gajapatis meant the weakening of the centralised authority in the region and the subsequent fragmentation and independence of the tributary and feudal states.

==Influence==
Kaundinya I, who became the co-founder of the Funan kingdom (centered in modern Cambodia) after he married the local Nāga princess Soma also has his origins from the ancient Kalinga region.

According to scholar R. C. Majumdar, the 8th century CE Shailendra dynasty of Java likely originated from Kalinga and the dynasty was also powerful in Cambodia and Champa(Annam) region. The Shailendras are considered to have been a thalassocracy and ruled vast swathes of maritime Southeast Asia and the dynasty appeared to be the ruling family of both the Mataram Kingdom of Central Java, for some period and the Srivijaya Kingdom in Sumatra.

Burma went by the name of Kalinga-rattha (likely observed in the old Indo-Chinese records for Pegu) and there is evidence of very early merchant settlements and Buddhist missions in the southern Mon regions and by the 2nd century CE, the rule of Kalinga migrants centered around Kale, the Arakan River valley and Pegu, around the Gulf of Martaban. The remains of a ship excavated at Tante, near Yangon is thought to have belonged to Kalingan traders. Place names and similarities in architecture also indicate close contacts across the Gulf of Bengal.

As per Maldivian history, the first kingdom Dheeva Maari was established before 3rd century BCE by Soorudasaruna-Adeettiya of the Solar dynasty, an exiled prince and son of King Brahmaadittiya of the Kalinga Kingdom and laid the foundation of the Adeetta dynasty.

In the Philippines according to Eric Casino, a king of Butuan was called Kiling; Casino posited that the king was not of Visayan origin but was rather of Indian origin, basing solely on the likelihood that the name Kiling was the same as the Malay term Keling (albeit this term is pronounced with a schwa) which refers to Indians.

Derived from Kalinga is the still current term Keling or Kling, used in parts of Southeast Asia to denote a person of the Indian subcontinent or Indian diaspora and at present having some derogatory and pejorative connotations, especially in Malaysia. The 16th-century Portuguese traveller Castanheda wrote of the Keling community in Melaka who lived in the northern part of the city of Malacca(Melaka). The merchants were known as Quelins (Kling, the people of Kalinga from India).

<text>Courtney Brown (born 1952) is an American political scientist and parapsychologist who is an associate professor in the political science department at Emory University. He is known for promoting the use of nonlinear mathematics in social scientific research, and as a proponent of remote viewing, a form of extrasensory perception. 

He is the founder of the Farsight Institute. Courtney Brown is also the CEO of Farsight Prime, a streaming service powered by Vimeo.

== Education ==
* Ph.D., Washington University, 1981
* M.A., San Francisco State University, 1977
* B.A., Rutgers University, 1974

==Applied mathematics==
Brown&#x27;s research in applied mathematics is mostly focused on social science applications of time-dependent models. He has published five peer-reviewed books and numerous articles on the subject of applied mathematics. Brown is also an advocate of the use of the R Programming Language, both for statistical as well as nonlinear modeling applications in the social sciences.

==Remote viewing==

Brown learned the basic Transcendental Meditation and an advanced technique called the TM-Sidhi program in 1991. He claims to have engaged in &quot;yogic flying&quot; (a mental-physical exercise involving hopping while cross-legged) at the Golden Dome of Pure Knowledge at Maharishi University of Management in Fairfield, Iowa in 1992.

Brown&#x27;s remote viewing findings have been dismissed by scientists, such as his colleague at Emory University Scott O. Lilienfeld, who has stated that Brown has refused to subject his ideas and his claimed psychic powers to independent scientific testing on what Lilienfeld describes as &quot;curious&quot; grounds.

Among a variety of controversial topics, Brown has claimed to apply remote viewing to the study of multiple realities, the nonlinearity of time, planetary phenomena, extraterrestrial life, UFOs, Atlantis, and even Jesus Christ. According to Michael Shermer &quot;The claims in Brown&#x27;s two books are nothing short of spectacularly weird. Through his numerous SRV sessions he says he has spoken with Jesus and Buddha (both, apparently, are advanced aliens), visited other inhabited planets, time traveled to Mars back when it was fully inhabited by intelligent ETs, and has even determined that aliens are living among us—one group in particular resides underground in New Mexico.&quot;

Martin Gardner wrote about Brown&#x27;s book &quot;Cosmic Voyage&quot; about his remote viewing findings of extraterrestrials, &quot;The only earlier book about UFOs I can think of that is nuttier than this one is George Adamski&#x27;s &#x27;Inside the Space Ships&#x27; (1955).&quot;

Robert Baker writing in the &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; came to the conclusion that Brown&#x27;s beliefs from remote viewing about alien civilizations is a case of self-deception.

In &quot;Remote Viewing: The Science and Theory of Nonphysical Perception&quot;, Courtney Brown&#x27;s work has garnered recognition from prominent scientists. Fred Alan Wolf, described it as foundational for academic studies in &quot;subjective physics&quot; and linked it to quantum theory, while Daryl J. Bem, praised the book for its exploration of remote viewing&#x27;s creative potential.

<text>Vitello (; ; – 1280/1314) was a Polish friar, theologian, natural philosopher and an important figure in the history of philosophy in Poland.

==Name==
Vitello&#x27;s name varies with some sources. In earlier publications he was quoted as Erazmus Ciolek Witelo, Erazm Ciołek, Vitellio and Vitulon. Today, he is usually referred to by his Latin name Vitello Thuringopolonis, often shortened to Vitello.

== Life ==
Vitello&#x27;s exact birth-name and birthplace are uncertain. He was most likely born around 1230 in Silesia, in the vicinity of Legnica. His mother came from a Polish knightly house, while his father was a German settler from Thuringia. He called himself, in Latin, &quot;Thuringorum et Polonorum filius&quot; — &quot;a son of Thuringians and Poles.&quot; He studied at Padua University about 1260, then went on to Viterbo. He became friends with William of Moerbeke, the translator of Aristotle from Greek language into Latin. Vitello&#x27;s major surviving work on optics, &quot;Perspectiva&quot;, completed in about 1270–78, was dedicated to William. In 1284 he described the reflection and refraction of light.

== &quot;Perspectiva&quot; ==

Vitello&#x27;s &quot;Perspectiva&quot; was largely based on the work of the polymath Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham; d. ca. 1041) and Robert Grosseteste, and he in turn influenced later scientists, in particular Johannes Kepler. Vitello&#x27;s treatise in optics was closely linked to the Latin version of Ibn al-Haytham&#x27;s Arabic opus: &quot;Kitab al-Manazir&quot; (&quot;The Book of Optics&quot;; &quot;De aspectibus&quot; or &quot;Perspectivae&quot;), and both were printed in the Friedrich Risner edition &quot;Opticae thesaurus&quot; (Basel, 1572).

Vitello&#x27;s &quot;Perspectiva&quot;, which rested on Ibn al-Haytham&#x27;s research in optics, influenced also the Renaissance theories of perspective. Lorenzo Ghiberti&#x27;s &quot;Commentario terzo&quot; (&quot;Third Commentary&quot;) was based on an Italian translation of Vitello&#x27;s Latin &quot;Perspectiva&quot;.

Vitello&#x27;s treatise also contains much material in psychology, outlining views that are close to modern notions on the association of ideas and on the subconscious.

&quot;Perspectiva&quot; also includes Platonic metaphysical discussions. Vitello argues that there are intellectual and corporeal bodies, connected by causality (corresponding to the Idealist doctrine of the universal and the actual), emanating from God in the form of Divine Light. Light itself is, for Vitello, the first of all sensible entities, and his views on light are similar to those held by Roger Bacon, though he is closer in this to Alhazen&#x27;s legacy.

== Other works ==
In &quot;Perspectiva&quot;, Vitello refers to other works that he had written. Most of these do not survive, but &quot;De natura daemonum&quot; and &quot;De primaria causa paenitentiae&quot; have been recovered.

== Legacy ==
The lunar crater &quot;Vitello&quot; is named after him.

<text>The Venetian Las Vegas is a luxury hotel and casino resort located on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada, United States. It is owned by Vici Properties and operated by Apollo Global Management. It was developed by businessman Sheldon Adelson through his company, Las Vegas Sands. The Venetian was built on the former site of the Sands Hotel and Casino, which was closed and demolished in 1996.

Construction on the Venetian began in April 1997, and the resort opened on May 4, 1999. Some amenities had yet to be finished, with construction continuing until the end of the year. Subcontractors later filed mechanic&#x27;s liens against the resort for unpaid work, leading to lengthy litigation. The Venetian also feuded with the Culinary Workers Union regarding Adelson&#x27;s decision to open the property as a non-union resort.

The Venetian was designed by Stubbins Associates and Wimberly Allison Tong &amp; Goo. The resort is themed after Venice and has replicas of numerous landmarks from the city, including a canal with gondola rides. The Venetian includes a casino and opened with 3,036 suites in a 35-story tower. A 12-story tower, the Venezia, was completed in 2003, bringing the room count to 4,049. The Palazzo, a sister property with its own hotel and casino, opened north of the Venetian in 2007. If considered as a single property, the Venetian-Palazzo complex ranks as the second-largest hotel in the world, with approximately 7,100 rooms.

The Venetian was built to accommodate convention-goers in particular, as Adelson felt that this demographic was underserved in Las Vegas. The resort includes its own meeting space, as well as the adjoining Venetian Expo. The property also includes the Grand Canal Shoppes, and was home to the Guggenheim Hermitage Museum from 2001 to 2008. The Venetian has several performance venues, which have hosted entertainment such as the Blue Man Group (2005–2012), &quot;&quot; (2006–2012), and Human Nature (2013–2020). A sphere-shaped venue and arena, known as simply Sphere, opened in September 2023.

By the end of 2020, Las Vegas Sands sought to focus on its Macau properties, which include The Venetian Macao. In February 2022, Apollo Global Management acquired the operations of the Venetian, Palazzo, and Venetian Expo for $2.25 billion, while Vici Properties purchased the land beneath the facilities for $4 billion. The Venetian and Palazzo approved labor contracts with the Culinary Workers Union in 2024, making them the last resort properties on the Strip to unionize.

==History==
===Background and construction===
The Venetian was built on land previously occupied by the Sands Hotel and Casino, which opened in 1952. Las Vegas Sands, a company founded by businessman Sheldon Adelson, purchased the Sands resort in 1989. Adelson eventually devised plans to replace the aging resort, which he felt was no longer competitive with newer properties. The Sands closed in June 1996, and was demolished five months later to make way for the Venetian.

Construction began on April 14, 1997, with a low-key groundbreaking ceremony. Lehrer McGovern Bovis served as the general contractor. Work began without the issuance of final permits, a strategy used by several previous resorts on the Strip. The Venetian&#x27;s foundation was poured two months after groundbreaking, followed by the construction of three stories. Further work could not begin until the approval of a traffic study. An extranet was used during construction to keep the project on schedule. It contained 4,500 items, including photos, illustrations, legal documents, and budgets. Project team members, based in various locations, could access the items via the extranet, increasing efficiency.

A key demographic would be convention-goers, whom Adelson considered underserved in Las Vegas. At the end of 1997, the project acquired $523 million in funding through the sale of bonds. The final cost was $1.5 billion. Financial analysts were skeptical about whether the resort would be finished, while gambling executives questioned Adelson&#x27;s decision to focus on business travelers and conventions. Up to that time, gambling had been the most significant revenue generator in Las Vegas. The Venetian was expected to employ more than 4,000 people, and it saw more than 100,000 applications.

Safety at the construction site was questioned after several incidents, including a worker death in January 1998, which occurred as the result of a fall. At the end of the year, another worker was crushed and killed by an 8,000-pound facade, which fell 32 stories while being lifted by a crane. In February 1999, a trio of workers had to be rescued from the hotel tower&#x27;s exterior after a cable for their scaffolding became tangled by high winds, stranding the workers 22 stories above ground. In March 1999, a natural gas leak occurred on-site after workers accidentally struck a line, closing one block of the Strip for two hours. The following day, an electrician died after falling more than 30 feet through an open hole, marking the third death since the start of construction. Bovis had previously been fined $9,300 for safety violations which included a lack of fall protection near holes.

===Opening===
The opening was initially scheduled for April 21, 1999. Adelson had wanted it to open a week earlier to accommodate convention-goers who were booked at the hotel. However, both opening dates were delayed due to ongoing construction work, as well as building inspections by the county. As a result, 900 convention guests had to be transferred to other hotels.

A soft opening was eventually scheduled for May 3, 1999. A private opening ceremony was held that morning and attended by thousands of VIP guests, including actress Sophia Loren and more than 500 journalists from around the world. County inspections delayed the public opening until 12:45 a.m. the following day. It was one of three new resorts to open on the Strip in 1999, along with Mandalay Bay and Paris Las Vegas.

Because construction was still ongoing, the resort opened without all of its amenities, including a retail mall and some restaurants. Much of the hotel tower was also unavailable initially, due to the inspection work. Because of this, many guests were sent to other resorts. Hotel inspections continued for several days after the opening, with only the first six floors and 320 rooms approved to operate. Construction continued after the opening, and concluded in December 1999. The resort did not receive a permanent certificate of occupancy until June 2001.

===Construction litigation===
Shortly after the opening, numerous subcontractors alleged that they were owed money for work performed on the Venetian. More than $230 million in mechanic&#x27;s liens were filed, including $145 million from Lehrer McGovern Bovis, which also filed a fraud lawsuit against the resort. The Venetian stated that it was not responsible for covering subcontractor costs, according to its contract with Bovis. The resort also said that, despite Adelson&#x27;s request, Bovis had failed to acquire mechanics-lien waivers when hiring subcontractors. According to Bovis, the Venetian had made more than 400 design changes during the final eight months of construction, while denying requests for construction extensions.

In July 1999, the resort filed a $50 million federal lawsuit against Bovis over the liens, as well as breach of contract. The resort claimed that its reputation had been damaged by the scattered opening of its amenities. Bovis filed its $145 million lien the following month. Both sides subsequently agreed to try resolving the dispute out of court. However, this did not pan out. A civil jury trial eventually began in August 2002, lasting 10 months. It was the longest-running civil jury trial and the largest construction lien case in Nevada history. The trial concluded in June 2003, when jurors found both the Venetian and Bovis in breach of contract. For incomplete and defective construction work, Bovis had to pay $2.3 million in damages to the resort, which was also ordered to pay $44.2 million to Bovis. Las Vegas Sands appealed the decision, and eventually reached an agreement with Bovis in 2005.

===Subsequent years===
By 2002, &quot;Condé Nast Traveler&quot; had named the Venetian as one of North America&#x27;s top 20 hotels. It had also received Four Diamond and Four Star ratings from American Automobile Association and Mobil Travel Guide respectively. As of 2004, the Venetian was among the most profitable resorts in Las Vegas, second to the Bellagio. A Chinese counterpart, The Venetian Macao, opened in Macau in 2007. That year, the Las Vegas location also added a sister property, The Palazzo. In 2020, readers of &quot;USA Today&quot; ranked the Venetian and Palazzo among the 10 best casinos in Las Vegas.

In 2004, the Venetian agreed to pay a $1 million penalty to settle a 12-count Gaming Control Board complaint. One of the complaints alleged the resort had held a drawing for a Mercedes-Benz that was rigged to be won by a high roller who had lost a large amount in the casino. The executives involved were fired.

On the morning of October 10, 2012, a man entered a closed gaming area and acquired $1.6 million in casino chips from a locked box that he broke open. He left the resort unnoticed, and the theft was not discovered until the following morning. He was arrested later in the month, with authorities recovering $396,000 in chips.

In 2013, Las Vegas Sands reached a non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice, following a two-year investigation into money laundering at the Venetian. Zhenli Ye Gon, a businessman and high-stakes gambler suspected of drug trafficking, had made numerous large deposits at the casino in 2006 and 2007. Las Vegas Sands acknowledged that it failed to take the matter seriously, and agreed to pay $47.4 million to the Department of Justice.

Like other casinos in Nevada, the Venetian closed indefinitely in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on the state. The following month, the resort announced plans to incorporate emergency medical personnel and automatic camera-based body temperature scans into its eventual reopening, which occurred on June 4, 2020.

By the end of 2020, Las Vegas Sands wanted to focus on its operations in Macau, as Asia was expected to recover from the pandemic&#x27;s impact at a faster rate. The company was in early discussions to sell the Venetian, the Palazzo, and the adjoining Sands Expo. Adelson died in January 2021, and Las Vegas Sands announced two months later that it would sell the three Las Vegas facilities for $6.25 billion. Through the deal, Vici Properties bought the land under the facilities for $4 billion, and Apollo Global Management acquired the operations for $2.25 billion as part of a triple net lease agreement with Vici. The sale was finalized in February 2022.

==Union history==
===Background===
Before the start of construction, Adelson indicated that the Venetian would be a non-union resort, unlike the Sands. This prompted criticism from the Culinary Workers Union, which represents the majority of Strip resort workers. The union wanted Adelson to rehire Sands workers without going through the application process. In March 1997, the union urged Clark County Commissioners to reject the Venetian project, citing traffic concerns if it should be built. Later that year, the union held protests in front of a Venetian preview center, which resulted in a restraining order that limited the level of noise allowed during the protests.

Resort executives said the property would offer a wages and benefits package matching or exceeding those offered by the union. Adelson outsourced key elements of the resort to third parties, including restaurant and retail operations. He said it would be up to employees to decide on unionization, stating that the Culinary&#x27;s actions were an &quot;attempt to intimidate employers like me into signing contracts for workers I haven&#x27;t hired yet, to stop me from trying to give my future employees a chance to choose whether they want union representation, and stop me from attracting like-minded, brand-name restaurateurs who want to give their employees that same freedom to choose&quot;. The union sought assurance that the Venetian would take a neutral stance during eventual union elections. Ultimately, the resort never unionized under Las Vegas Sands&#x27; ownership.

===1999 protests and aftermath===
A traffic study had determined that the public sidewalk in front of the future Venetian had to be removed, allowing for a widening of Las Vegas Boulevard. In an agreement with the county, the resort built a sidewalk on its own property with the condition that it be accessible by the public. More than 1,000 Culinary members picketed on the sidewalk in front of the resort on March 1, 1999, two months prior to its opening. Resort officials accused them of trespassing and warned of arrests, although the district attorney determined the sidewalks to be public property. Georgia congressman John Lewis spoke at the rally and also attempted to meet with Adelson, who turned down the offer because Lewis wanted to include union representatives. Although the protest had a permit to proceed, the Venetian contacted the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) to intervene, despite the latter stating that it would not do so. The Venetian used loudspeakers to warn union members against protesting in front of the resort, and one Venetian security guard performed a citizen&#x27;s arrest on a union member.

Several days after the protest, the resort filed a federal lawsuit against the union, the county, the district attorney, and the LVMPD. The resort stated that the protest took place on a private walkway separate from the sidewalk, and it sought a court order declaring the former as private property. The union responded: &quot;We&#x27;ve been through this before, and we&#x27;ll be through it again. We&#x27;ve battled this guy before, and we&#x27;ll battle him as long as it takes. We&#x27;re never going away. It&#x27;s a long way from over&quot;. A judge denied the Venetian&#x27;s request for a restraining order, and thousands of Culinary members protested at the resort&#x27;s grand opening. However, most tourists were reportedly unaware or uninterested in the union battle, proceeding to visit the property. The Venetian accused the union of trespassing and unlawful picketing, and filed suit to prevent such activity in the future. A district court ruled later in 1999 that the resort&#x27;s sidewalks constitute a public forum where individuals can exercise their First Amendment rights. The decision was appealed but upheld in 2001.

After the district court ruling, the union filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in regard to the sidewalk dispute. The agency eventually determined that the resort violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). The Venetian appealed, but eventually lost the case when it went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to hear it in 2008. However, a year later, the NLRB did withdraw its finding that the Venetian violated the NLRA when it contacted police.

===2020s: Apollo union neutrality===
After Apollo&#x27;s purchase was announced in 2021, the Culinary union questioned the company&#x27;s prior management of Caesars Entertainment, which included a workforce cut of more than 20,000 over a 10-year period. Upon taking ownership in 2022, Apollo expressed no opposition to unionization. In 2023, a card check neutrality agreement was reached between Apollo and the Culinary union, the Bartenders Union Local 165 and the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 501, and with Teamsters Local 986 for joint negotiations. Under the deal, employees would determine whether to unionize while Apollo management refrains from taking a position on the matter. On September 19, 2024, the Venetian and Palazzo approved a Culinary Workers Union labor contract, making them the last resort properties on the Strip to unionize. 

== Design ==

The Venetian is themed after Venice during the 1400s and 1500s, and it features numerous landmarks from the city. Initially, Adelson did not plan for the resort to have a theme. His second wife, Miriam, eventually suggested theming the resort after Venice, where they had honeymooned in 1991.

Two architectural firms worked on the project: Stubbins Associates, and Wimberly Allison Tong &amp; Goo. Many of the resort&#x27;s landmarks and statues were created by Treadway Industries. The design project included 250 artists and sculptors. For historical authenticity, the resort hired two Venice historians, while Treadway sent a team there to photograph the city. Venice mayor Massimo Cacciari was critical of the design, calling it a &quot;mega-galactic example of kitsch&quot; and comparing the resort with a &quot;street walker&quot;.
The exterior entrance along the Las Vegas Strip is modeled on the Doge&#x27;s Palace and includes a recreation of the Rialto Bridge. It also features a 315-foot-high replica of St Mark&#x27;s Campanile, topped by a statue depicting Gabriel. A revolving restaurant or lounge had been considered for the top of the tower, but it was deemed too small, measuring only 40 square feet. The Grand Canal Shoppes occupy an indoor plaza with a recreation of St. Mark&#x27;s Square and features a sky-painted ceiling. Another area of the resort features 21 faux Renaissance-era paintings that were framed and attached to the ceiling.

The Venetian includes a replica of Venice&#x27;s Grand Canal that goes through the resort&#x27;s interior and exterior. Gondolas travel throughout the canal, and visitors can ride on them for a fee. In 2013, the indoor canals were drained for a month-long renovation, the first since the resort opened. At the time, the gondolas attracted 500,000 riders per year.

==Features==
===Casino and hotel===

The Venetian includes a casino. Due to lack of demand, the resort&#x27;s poker room closed in 2000, with plans to expand the race and sports book. Amid a resurgence in poker popularity, the resort added a new $2.6 million poker room in 2006, featuring 39 tables. At , it was the third largest poker room on the Strip. The resort eventually replaced it with the larger Sands Poker Room, which debuted in 2012. It was the largest on the Strip, measuring . A new space of equal size, named The Poker Room, opened in 2024.

In 2001, the Venetian announced changes aimed at accommodating high rollers. This would include expansion of the baccarat pit, modifications to 18 suites, and the addition of semi-private gaming and dining areas. In 2005, the Venetian opened the Paiza Club, a high-rise private gaming area catering to Asian high rollers. Las Vegas Sands had opened the Sands Macao in China a year earlier, building up a new customer base in Asia.

In 2006, Nevada became the first state to approve mobile gambling, and the Venetian reached a deal with Cantor Gaming to provide such a service at the resort. The mobile gaming devices, developed and operated by Cantor, offered games such as blackjack and video poker. They were usable in public areas of the resort such as restaurants and the pool area. The Venetian introduced the devices in 2008, becoming the first Las Vegas resort to offer them. Cantor took over the Venetian&#x27;s sports book operations in 2011, and spent $30 million to renovate the facility, which measured . A high-limit slot salon opened in 2013, featuring 118 machines and butler service.
The Venetian opened with 3,036 suites. The original hotel tower is 35 stories and 480 feet in height. Plans were evaluated in 2000 for a second tower, to be built atop the resort&#x27;s 10-story parking garage. Construction eventually began in July 2002. The 12-story Venezia tower opened in June 2003 and added 1,013 rooms, for a total of 4,049.

The 50-story Palazzo, directly north of the Venetian, includes more than 3,000 rooms. When considered as a single property, the Venetian-Palazzo complex ranked as the world&#x27;s largest hotel, with approximately 7,100 rooms. It lost this title to the First World Hotel in 2015. The complex has a total of in gaming space.

In 2010, the Venetian and Palazzo partnered with InterContinental Hotels Group through a 10-year deal. The Venetian rooms were renovated in 2015. Two years later, the Venetian became the first Las Vegas resort to allow hotel bookings through Facebook Messenger.

===Clubs and lounges===
A nightclub, C2K, opened in late 1999 and was leased out to a third-party operator. The Venetian closed the club in August 2000, alleging rampant drug use and sexual activities. The closure came a month after a woman died at the club of an ecstasy overdose. It reopened two months later, under new management.

In its early years, the Venetian included a club known as the Venus Lounge. In 2005, Vivid Entertainment leased the space and opened it as Vivid, a nightclub. Vivid closed in 2006, and sat vacant until the 2009 opening of Smokin&#x27; Hot Aces, a rock and roll bar.

Tao, a popular nightclub and restaurant, opened in 2005. It covers , including for the nightclub. A dayclub, known as Tao Beach, opened in 2007. The five-acre Tao Beach covers the nightclub&#x27;s rooftop.

In 2012, the Venetian opened The Bourbon Room, a 1980s-themed lounge. It took over the former La Scena lounge and accompanied the resort&#x27;s new &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; show, which was performed in a separate venue. The show and lounge closed in early 2016. The Bourbon Room was replaced by the Dorsey, a cocktail bar opened later in 2016. It went on to become one of the most popular bars in Las Vegas. It is scheduled to close in June 2023, to be replaced by Juliet Cocktail Room.

===Restaurants===
The Venetian initially featured 15 restaurants, three of which were ready for the resort&#x27;s soft opening. Notable chefs at the resort included Emeril Lagasse, Joachim Splichal, Stephan Pyles, and Wolfgang Puck. In contrast to most Las Vegas resorts, the Venetian opened without a buffet, as Adelson sought an upper-class clientele: &quot;The people who want buffets are not consistent with the luxury and quality that we&#x27;ve put together here&quot;.

Tao Asian Bistro has consistently ranked as the highest-grossing independent restaurant in the U.S. since its 2005 opening, in part due to alcohol sales in its bar. The restaurant features Asian decor, including a giant Buddha statue. Another restaurant, Royal Star, also served Chinese food until its closure in 2006.

Bouchon, a French bistro by chef Thomas Keller, has operated since 2004. It is located in the Venezia tower and was designed by Adam Tihany. Yardbird Southern Table &amp; Bar opened its second location in 2015, at the Venetian. Chef Mario Batali had two restaurants at the Venetian, both of which closed in 2018, after sexual misconduct allegations were made against him. Estiatorio Milos, a Greek seafood restaurant, opened in 2021.

===Convention space===

The resort opened with the Venetian Congress Center, offering of meeting space, in addition to the adjoining Sands Expo behind the Venetian, which opened in 1990 as part of the earlier Sands resort. A expansion of the Congress Center and Sands Expo brought the resort&#x27;s total meeting space to . The expansion cost $45 million and was finished in 2003.

The Venetian helped popularize Las Vegas as a convention city, particularly thanks to its Sands Expo. Las Vegas Sands renamed it as the Venetian Expo in 2021, while in the process of selling the facility. The Venetian Congress Center was also renamed The Venetian Convention Center.

===Museums===

Two museums, affiliated with the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, opened at the Venetian on October 7, 2001. Both were designed by architect Rem Koolhaas.
* The Guggenheim Las Vegas operated in a building until January 2003, hosting only one exhibit up to that point: Guggenheim&#x27;s The Art of the Motorcycle. The facility and exhibition cost $37 million to develop, and averaged 666 daily visitors; it needed 3,000 to 4,000 to justify operating expenses. The low attendance was partly attributed to decreased tourism brought on by the September 11 attacks. Several new exhibits had been considered as replacements, but none came to fruition due to lack of funding. The Venetian announced in May 2003 that the Guggenheim Las Vegas space would become a new performance theater for the resort.
* The Guggenheim Hermitage Museum operated in partnership with the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. The facility measured and hosted 10 exhibitions before closing in May 2008.

===Other features===
Since 1999, the resort has included a Madame Tussaud&#x27;s wax museum, marking the first U.S. location. The resort also features the Grand Canal Shoppes, an shopping mall. In 2000, the Venetian became the first Strip resort to open a child-care center for its employees. The Venetian opened with five pools, and the 2003 Venezia addition included another pool deck and the resort&#x27;s first wedding chapel. Upon its opening, the resort also included the Canyon Ranch SpaClub. The spa was expanded during construction of the Palazzo, bringing it to . It is among the largest spa and fitness centers in Las Vegas.

==Entertainment venues==
===Showroom===
The Venetian&#x27;s C2K club served as the resort&#x27;s original performance venue, known as the Showroom during live entertainment. It was managed by H&amp;H; Entertainment, which leased the space from the resort and rented it out to performers. The venue struggled in its early years, and the Venetian had a strained relationship with H&amp;H;, disagreeing with the type of shows being put on. Performers – such as impressionist André-Philippe Gagnon, magician Melinda Saxe, and singer Robert Goulet – also had disagreements with H&amp;H;&#x27;s management style. In its early years, the Showroom had been host to several shows, though none garnered substantial success until the 2003 openings of &quot;Lord of the Dance&quot; and &quot;V: The Ultimate Variety Show&quot;.

===Voltaire===
&quot;Lord of the Dance&quot; and &quot;V&quot; both closed in 2004, making way for construction of a new theater with 1,760 seats. The Blue Man Group opened in the new space in 2005, and performed there until 2012. The Blue Man Group Theatre subsequently became the Rock of Ages Theatre, hosting the &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; musical from 2012 to 2016, with more than 1,000 performances during that time. The theater sat vacant for the next year, eventually hosting Steely Dan in 2017, under the new name of Opaline Theatre.

A circus-themed show by Base Entertainment, titled &quot;Revive&quot;, was being developed for the Opaline Theatre, but was canceled in 2018, stalling plans to renovate the venue. Base later used the theater as a rehearsal space for other, off-site shows. The venue otherwise remained vacant for years.

In 2023, the space was reopened as a club and venue known as Voltaire, with a reduced capacity of 1,000. The venue has held residencies for singers Kylie Minogue and Christina Aguilera, and also hosted &quot;Belle de Nuit&quot;, a Parisian-style cabaret. Dita von Teese began a residency featuring a theatrical adult revue in September 2024.
===Venetian Theatre===
In 2003, the Venetian announced that Guggenheim Las Vegas would be converted into a second performance venue. The new theater has seating for 1,815 people. It debuted with &quot;&quot;, a shortened, 95-minute version of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;. The theater cost $42 million to build, and the show&#x27;s production cost another $35 million. The show opened in 2006, and ran for six years, ending after nearly 2,700 performances. The former Phantom Theatre has since been renamed the Venetian Theatre.

At the end of 2012, country singers Tim McGraw and Faith Hill took over the theater space for a 10-weekend series of concerts. In 2013, they signed on for another 10-weekend set of shows. &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot;, a Ray Charles tribute show, ran during 2014, with Clint Holmes, Nnenna Freelon, and Take 6 as performers. Although scheduled for a six-week run, it closed two weeks early due to poor ticket sales. In 2015, after nearly five years, The Judds reunited for a series of shows at the Venetian. Rock singer-songwriter John Fogerty also had a concert residency in the theater during 2016, in a show incorporating smoke and pyrotechnics. The new wave band The B-52s are scheduled for residencies at the theater in 2023 and 2024.

===The Summit===
A third performance venue, the Gordie Brown Theatre, was added in October 2006, taking former ballroom space. The 742-seat venue was custom-built to host singer Gordie Brown, with a design by The Rockwell Group. In 2007, Wayne Brady also signed on to perform in the venue, which was renamed the Venetian Showroom.

Brown ended his run in 2008. An interactive game show, &quot;The Real Deal&quot;, ran in the Venetian Showroom later that year. The show involved certain audience members being selected to compete against professional poker players. It was produced by Merv Adelson, who was later accused by the resort of stopping production and thereby breaching contract. In 2009, actor Chazz Palminteri performed his one-man show, &quot;A Bronx Tale&quot;, in the showroom.

In 2013, pop musical group Human Nature began performing in the space, which was renamed the Sands Showroom. Human Nature ended its show in 2020, amid uncertainty regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2014, the resort debuted an all-female comedy series in the Sands Showroom. &quot;Puppets Up! Uncensored&quot;, an adult-oriented puppet show, opened in the showroom in July 2016. The short-lived show, created by Brian Henson and directed by Patrick Bristow, closed in September 2016.

In 2021, the Sands Showroom was renamed The Summit, and Derek Hough launched a dance show which continued into the following year. Lin-Manuel Miranda and his musical group Freestyle Love Supreme had a residency in the showroom from 2022 to 2023.

===Sphere===
A sphere-shaped music and entertainment arena, known as simply Sphere, opened in September 2023. It is located directly east of the Venetian. The arena&#x27;s interior is covered in LED screens which accompany live entertainment. The venue includes seating for 17,500 people.

== Early life and prewar service ==
Biryuzov was born in Skopin, in the Ryazan Governorate of the Russian Empire, in a working-class family of Russian ethnicity. He joined the Red Army in September 1922, studying at the 48th Rostov Infantry and Machine Gun and the 10th Vladikavkaz Courses in the North Caucasus Military District before transferring to the VTsIK Combined Military School in Moscow in October 1923. After graduating from the latter, Biryuzov returned to the North Caucasus Military District in September 1926 to command a platoon of the 65th Rifle Regiment of the 22nd Rifle Division. In the same year he became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. From December 1929 he served as commander of an airfield company of the 36th Aircraft Fleet in the district.

After completing studies at the Military Faculty of the Moscow Zootechnical Institute between June 1930 and February 1931, Biryuzov served with the 3rd Rifle Regiment of the Moscow Proletarian Rifle Division, rising from company commander to chief of staff of the training battalion to rifle battalion commander during his service with the regiment. Entering the Frunze Military Academy in June 1934, Biryuzov became chief of staff of the 30th Rifle Division following his graduation in October 1937. He was acting division commander until February 1938 and in April of that year became chief of the operations department Kharkov Military District staff. Biryuzov held this position until August 1939, when he became the commanding officer of the 132nd Rifle Division.

== World War II ==
Biryuzov commanded this unit for the next three years, a rarity among Soviet generals, especially during World War II–as Soviet generals rarely held command positions for longer than a few months at most. Biryuzov&#x27;s division was a part of Southwestern and Bryansk Fronts. Biryuzov was a fine division commander, often leading his division personally into battle. Within the first year of Operation Barbarossa (June 1941), Biryuzov had been wounded five times, two times rather severely. In April 1942, he was made the Chief of Staff of the 48th Army, which was a part of Bryansk Front. He commanded this unit until November 1942, when he was made the Chief of Staff of the 2nd Guards Army. He was in this position until April 1943, helping to lead this unit during Operation Saturn, when 2nd Guards Army helped crush the German 6th Army after the Germans had been surrounded during the Battle of Stalingrad.

In April 1943, he was made the Chief of Staff of the Southern Front, where he was a valuable aide to the Southern Front commander, Fyodor Tolbukhin. On October 20, 1943, Southern Front was renamed 4th Ukrainian Front. Biryuzov remained the Chief of Staff until May 1944 when he was transferred to 3rd Ukrainian Front, along with Tolbukhin. In October 1944, Biryuzov was transferred to command the 37th Army, which was a part of 3rd Ukrainian Front. He held this position through the end of the war, until May 1945. In these command positions, Biriuzov helped plan and carry out the expulsion of all German forces from Ukraine, and then helped plan and carry out the liberation of Bulgaria and Yugoslavia.

== Cold War ==
After these commands, Biryuzov was made the Head of the Soviet Military Mission in Bulgaria, a position he held until May 1946, when he became deputy commander-in-chief of the Ground Forces for combat training. Between June 1947 and April 1953, he commanded the Primorsky Military District, then became first deputy commander-in-chief of the Far Eastern Military District when the Primorsky Military District was merged into the latter. Two months later, Biryuzov was sent west to become commander-in-chief of the Central Group of Forces. He assumed a series of senior positions in the Soviet Air Defense Forces beginning in May 1954 when he became first deputy commander-in-chief of the forces. On March 11, 1955, Biryuzov was given the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union. Between April 1955 and April 1962, Biryuzov was the Commander in Chief of the Soviet Air Defense Forces. After nearly a year as Commander in Chief of the Strategic Missile Force, he was made the Chief of the General Staff in March 1963.

== Death ==
On October 19, 1964, Biryuzov and 32 others were killed when their Ilyushin Il-18 crashed against Mount Avala near Belgrade. The urn containing his ashes is buried in the Kremlin.

<text>The Chino Hills are a mountain range on the border of Orange, Los Angeles, and San Bernardino counties, California, with a small portion in Riverside County. Chino Hills State Park preserves open space and habitat in them.

==Geography==

The Chino Hills are separated from the Santa Ana Mountains to the south by the Santa Ana River (Santa Ana Canyon). On the northwest, Brea Canyon separates the Chino Hills from the Puente Hills. To the north of the Puente Hills and San Jose Creek lie the San Jose Hills. The only paved road crossing the Chino Hills is Carbon Canyon Road (State Route 142).

==Flora==
The Chino Hills are in the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion of the California Floristic Province. The California native plants here are in the chaparral and oak woodland plant communities, with remnant stands of native grasses of California.

==Chino Hills earthquake==

On July 29, 2008, a magnitude 5.4 earthquake was located southwest of Chino Hills that was felt throughout Southern California and felt as far east as the Las Vegas Valley and as far south as San Diego. It occurred at 11:42 am PDT and caused structural damage to buildings, including to St. Jude Centers for Rehabilitation and Wellness and to the Pomona City Hall. Water mains were ruptured in limited areas of Los Angeles, and superficial damage was done to the facades of businesses and other buildings. Many businesses, including Wal-Mart, reported damage to merchandise which was knocked to the floor and South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa suffered damage to a portion of the ceiling which was knocked to the chair of a restaurant.

There were reports of minor injuries but no fatalities.

==Fauna==
The cliff swallows of Mission San Juan Capistrano nest in Chino Hills. Thousands of the small birds, up from &#x27;wintering&#x27; in Argentina, have built their mud nests in the eaves of the Vellano Country Club, a community situated around a golf course in the hills.

<text>The is a double reed Japanese used as one of two main melodic instruments in music. It is one of the &quot;sacred&quot; instruments and is often heard at Shinto weddings in Japan. Its sound is often described as haunting.

The is derived from the Chinese &quot;guan&quot;, which was imported into Japan during the Tang dynasty. According to scholars, the emerged after the 12th century when the popularity of the Chinese melodies in Japan called waned.

== Description ==
Although a double reed instrument like the oboe, the has a cylindrical bore and thus its sound is similar to that of a clarinet. It is difficult to play due in part to the double reed configuration. It is made of a piece of bamboo that measures with a flat double reed inserted which makes a loud sound.

Pitch and ornamentation (most notably bending tones) are controlled largely with the embouchure. The instrument is particularly noted for the (&quot;salted plum seasoning&quot;), a kind of pitch-gliding technique.

The is the most widely used of all instruments in and it is used in all forms of music aside from poetry recitation. The is derived from the Chinese or , and is also related to the Korean . This is evident in the notations of the finger positioning, a tablature of signs derived from Chinese characters.

Notable Japanese musicians who play the include Hideki Togi and Hitomi Nakamura.

Non-Japanese musicians who have learned to play the include Alan Hovhaness, Richard Teitelbaum, Valerie Samson, Thomas Piercy and Joseph Celli.

<text>Monk station is a Montreal Metro station in the borough of Le Sud-Ouest in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and serves Green Line. The station is located in the Ville-Émard district.

==Art and architecture==
The station structure was designed by Blais &amp; Bélanger and features many works of art, including the large sculpture &quot;Pic et Pelle&quot; by artist Germain Bergeron. Monk also features many balconies that overlook the main station below, however they have been closed for the safety of the visually impaired.

Germain Bergeron considered many different ideas for the public art for this station. His first concept was to create a series of flying saucers that were suspended from the roof of the station, and were to move with the wind generated by passing trains. However, this was deemed too dangerous by authorities, and the idea was cancelled.

The current two giant statues of workers constructing the Metro were to have been accompanied by a third, representing a foreman, but this idea was judged superfluous and scrapped.

==Origin of the name==
The station is named for boulevard Monk, itself named to honour the Monk family. It is unsure which member is being honoured. It could be Sir James Monk (1745-1826), a prosecutor who served on Quebec&#x27;s vice admiralty court from 1778 to 1788 and subsequently became Montreal&#x27;s chief justice from 1793 to 1820. Alternatively, the boulevard and the station could be named for Frederick D. Monk, an attorney who along with Joseph-Ulric Émard purchased land belonging to the Davidson family in order to develop it, the area became Ville-Émard.

<doc id="1015379" wikidata="Q15267446" url="?curid=1015379" title="A&amp;W Root Beer">
<text>A&amp;W Root Beer is an American brand of root beer that was founded in 1919 by Roy W. Allen and primarily available in the United States and Canada. Allen partnered with Frank Wright in 1922, creating the A&amp;W brand and inspiring a chain of A&amp;W Restaurants founded that year. Originally, A&amp;W Root Beer sold for five cents ().

The rights to the A&amp;W brand (except in Canada) are owned by Keurig Dr Pepper, which in turn licenses the brand to the U.S.-based A&amp;W Restaurant chain. A&amp;W Root Beer products are distributed via various U.S. bottlers. A&amp;W Food Services of Canada, which is independent of both Keurig Dr Pepper and the U.S. restaurant chain, is responsible for the restaurants and marketing of root beer products in Canada, with retail products bottled and distributed by the Coca-Cola Company. The U.S. variant is also sold as an import drink in Southeast Asia and Italy (where A&amp;W has restaurants), as well as in Australia, Chile, and other countries.

== History ==
Roy W. Allen opened a roadside root beer stand in Lodi, California in 1919, using a formula that he had purchased from a pharmacist. He soon opened stands in Stockton, as well as five stands in nearby Sacramento - where &quot;tray boys&quot; pioneered drive-in curbside service. In 1920 Allen partnered with Frank Wright, birthing the A&amp;W brand name.

Allen bought Wright out, obtained a trademark, and began selling restaurant franchises - creating one of the first restaurant chains in the United States. Franchise owners could use the A&amp;W name and logo and purchased concentrated root beer syrup from Allen. There was no common menu, architecture, or set of procedures, and some chose to also sell food. By 1933 there were 170 A&amp;W franchises.

Franchises struggled with labor shortages and sugar rationing during World War II, but following the war GI loans helped, in part, the number of A&amp;W outlets to triple. The proliferation of the automobile and the mobility it offered resulted in more than 450 A&amp;W Root Beer stands operating by 1950. That year Allen retired and sold the business to Nebraskan Gene Hurtz, who formed the A&amp;W Root Beer Company. The first A&amp;W Root Beer outlet in Canada opened in 1956.

By 1960 the number of A&amp;W restaurants swelled to more than 2,000.

In 1963 the company was sold to the J. Hungerford Smith Company, which had produced Allen&#x27;s concentrate since 1921. That year the first overseas A&amp;W restaurant opened its doors in Guam. In 1966 Hungerford was sold to the United Fruit Company, which merged with AMK Corporation in 1970 to form the United Brands Company.

In 1971 United Brands formed a wholly owned subsidiary, A&amp;W Distributing Co., to retail its root beer. After test runs in Arizona and California the products were distributed nationally, including sugar-free, low-sodium, and caffeine-free versions. In 1974, A&amp;W introduced &quot;The Great Root Bear,&quot; a mascot that served as a goodwill ambassador for the brand.

In the late 1970s A&amp;W Restaurants was formed to manage restaurant franchising. It was bought in 1982 by A. Alfred Taubman.

The bear and its associated jingle became the basis of a long-running Canadian advertising campaign. The mascot was so successful that it was eventually adopted by the American A&amp;W chain as well.

In 1983, United Brands sold A&amp;W Root Beer to a group of investors. In 1986, Hicks &amp; Haas and management bought A&amp;W from the investor group.

In 1986 A&amp;W Cream Soda and A&amp;W Diet Cream Soda were introduced and distributed nationally, followed in 1987 by the reformulation of A&amp;W Sugar-Free as Diet A&amp;W. Also in 1986, A&amp;W acquired Squirt. The company went public in 1987 and also acquired Vernors. 

In October 1993 A&amp;W Beverages was folded into Cadbury Beverages. It spun off its U.S. beverages business as Dr Pepper Snapple Group in 2008.

In July 2017 A&amp;W Canada reformulated its root beer, dropping high fructose corn syrup and some flavors from the recipe, substituting cane sugar, sarsaparilla root, licorice, birch bark and anise. A&amp;W Canada launched the new formula by declaring Free Root Beer Day, serving free root beer at all locations on July 22, 2017.

In November 2020 Diet A&amp;W was rebranded as A&amp;W Zero Sugar.

== Brands ==
* A&amp;W Sugar-Free was introduced in 1974 and reformulated as Diet A&amp;W in 1987. In 2020, it was rebranded again under the name A&amp;W Zero Sugar.
* A&amp;W Cream Soda and A&amp;W Diet Cream Soda were introduced in 1986.
* A&amp;W Floats and Sunkist Floats were introduced in 2008.
* A&amp;W TEN, a low-calorie root beer, began appearing in American supermarkets in the spring of 2013.

== Promotions and contests ==
* Through eBay, A&amp;W and Jim Belushi offered a trip to Los Angeles with a VIP pass to the &quot;A&amp;W Ultimate All-American Cookout and Concert&quot; at the House of Blues.
* In celebration of its 100th anniversary, A&amp;W offered a free two-liter bottle of its root beer in exchange for taking the Family Fun Pledge, which asked participants to be &quot;technology-free for one hour every Friday night this summer.&quot;

== The Great Root Bear ==
The Great Root Bear, also called Rooty, became the mascot for A&amp;W Root Beer in 1973.

In a long-running television advertising campaign for the Canadian A&amp;W chain, his theme was a tuba-driven jingle entitled &quot;Ba-Dum, Ba-Dum&quot;. The jingle was released as a single by Attic Records in Canada. It was credited to &quot;Major Ursus&quot;, a play on the constellation name Ursa Major, which means &quot;great bear&quot;. The famous Canadian composer and B.C. Hall of Fame enshrinee Robert Buckley helped compose the song.

In late 2011, the new ownership of A&amp;W began using the mascot again, particularly in A&amp;W&#x27;s online presence.

== A&amp;W Restaurants ==

Shortly after Allen bought out Wright&#x27;s portion of the business he began franchising the product. His profits came from a small franchise fee and sales of concentrate. There was no standard food menu for franchises until 1978. By 1960 the company had 2,000 stores.

In 1989 A&amp;W made an agreement with Minnesota-based chain Carousel Snack Bars to convert that chain&#x27;s 200 locations (mostly kiosks in shopping malls) to &quot;A&amp;W Hot Dogs &amp; More&quot;. Some A&amp;W Hot Dogs &amp; More locations are in operation today.

Many A&amp;W locations that opened in the U.S. during the Yum! Brands ownership years (2002–2011) were co-branded with Yum!&#x27;s other chains—Long John Silver&#x27;s, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut or KFC.

As of December 2011 A&amp;W was under new ownership and its world headquarters was moved back to Lexington, Kentucky. Since then, in the United States and Southeast Asia, A&amp;W has been a franchisee-owned company.

<doc id="1015382" wikidata="Q218123" url="?curid=1015382" title="Plumeria">
<text>Plumeria (), also known as frangipani, is a genus of flowering plants in the subfamily Rauvolfioideae, of the family Apocynaceae. Most species are deciduous shrubs or small trees. The species are native to the Neotropical realm (in Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean, and as far south as Brazil and as far north as Florida in the United States), but are often grown as cosmopolitan ornamentals in tropical regions, especially in Hawaii, as well as hot desert climates in the Arabian Peninsula with proper irrigation.

== Names ==
The genus Plumeria is named in honour of 17th-century French botanist and Catholic monk Charles Plumier, who traveled to the New World documenting many plant and animal species. &quot;Plumeria&quot; is also used as a common name, especially in horticultural circles.

The name &quot;&quot; comes from a 16th-century marquis of the noble Frangipani family in Italy, who created a synthetic plumeria-like perfume. Common names for plants in the genus vary widely according to region, variety, and whim, but &quot;frangipani&quot; or variations on that theme are the most common.

In eastern India and Bangladesh, plumeria is traditionally considered as a variety of the &quot;champak&quot; flower, the &quot;golok chapa&quot;, meaning the &quot;champaka&quot; that resides in the heavenly home of Sri Krishna, a Hindu god at the highest realm of heaven. In Sri Lanka it is known as &quot;Araliya&quot; or &quot;Temple Flower&quot;. The flower, considered sacred, is also known by the names &quot;gulancha&quot; and &quot;kath golap.&quot;

== Description ==
Plumeria branches are succulent. The trunk and branches of the &quot;Plumeria&quot; species have a milky latex sap that, like many other Apocynaceae, contains poisonous compounds that irritate the eyes and skin.

=== Leaves ===

Plumeria trees are small or low shrubs. The leaves grow at tips of their branches. Various species and cultivar have various leaf shape and arrangements. The leaves of &quot;P. alba&quot; are narrow and corrugated, whereas leaves of &quot;P. pudica&quot; have an elongated shape and glossy, dark-green color. &quot;P. pudica&quot; is one of the everblooming types with nondeciduous, evergreen leaves. Another, semi-deciduous species that retains leaves and flowers in winter is &quot;P. obtusa&quot;; commonly known as &quot;Singapore plumeria&quot;.

=== Flowers ===

&quot;Plumeria&quot; trees flower from early summer to fall. Their blossoms grow in clusters on ends of the stems, they are made of tubular corolla with a length of that split sharply into five rounded and waxy petals that overlap each other. These flowers come in many colours including pink, red, white and yellow, orange, or pastel. They have separate anthers.

The flowers are highly fragrant, especially at night. Their scent is perceived to have floral elements of jasmine, citrus, gardenia, fruity aromatic notes of coconut, peach, vanilla, as well as lactonic, woody accords. However, they yield no nectar. Their scent tricks sphinx moths into pollinating them by transferring pollen from flower to flower in their fruitless search for nectar.

Insects or human pollination can help create new varieties of plumeria. Plumeria trees from cross-pollinated seeds may show characteristics of the mother tree or their flowers might just have a distinct appearance.

Its fruit separates into two follicles with winged seeds.

== Taxonomy ==
=== Species ===

== Propagation ==
Plumeria can be propagated by seed or vegetatively propagated by cutting stem tips in spring, allowing them to dry at their bases, then planting in well-drained soil. These are particularly susceptible to rot in moist soil. Applying rooting hormone to the clean fresh-cut end will enable callusing.
Plumeria cuttings can also be propagated by grafting to an already rooted system. The Plumeria Society of America lists 368 registered cultivars of &quot;Plumeria&quot; as of 2009.

== In culture ==

In Mesoamerica, plumerias have carried complex symbolic significance for over two millennia, with striking examples from the Maya and Aztec periods into the present. Among the Maya, plumerias have been associated with deities representing life and fertility, and the flowers also became strongly connected with female sexuality. Nahuatl-speaking people during the height of the Aztec Empire used plumerias to signify elite status, and planted plumeria trees in the gardens of nobles.

In the Philippines, where plumerias were introduced early in the 1560s from Mexico, plumerias are associated with graveyards, since the strong smell of the flowers were used to mask the &quot;smell of death&quot;. This association spread into neighboring regions in Ternate and into Malaysia and Indonesia. In these two countries, plumerias are still often associated with ghosts and cemeteries. Yangsze Choo in her novel &quot;The Night Tiger&quot; for example described it as is &quot;the graveyard flower of the Malays&quot;. Plumerias often are planted on burial grounds in all three nations. They are also common ornamental plants in houses, parks, parking lots, and other open-air establishments in the Philippines. Balinese Hindus use the flowers in their temple offerings. The plumeria&#x27;s fragrance is also associated with the &quot;Kuntilanak&quot;, an evil vampiric spirit of a dead mother in Malaysian-Indonesian folklores.

In several Pacific islands, where plumerias were introduced in the late 19th century, such as Tahiti, Fiji, Samoa, Hawaii, New Zealand, Tonga, and the Cook Islands, &quot;Plumeria&quot; species are used for making leis. In Hawaii, the flower is called melia. In modern Polynesian culture, the flower can be worn by women to indicate their relationship status—over the right ear if seeking a relationship, and over the left if taken.

&quot;Plumeria alba&quot; is the national flower of Laos, where it is known under the local name &quot;champa&quot; or &quot;dok champa&quot;. It is also used as the logo of Lao Airlines, the national airline of Laos.

In Bengali culture, most white flowers, and in particular, plumeria (Bengali, &quot;chômpa&quot; or &quot;chãpa&quot;), are associated with funerals and death.

Indian incenses scented with &quot;Plumeria rubra&quot; have &quot;champa&quot; in their names. For example, &quot;nag champa&quot; is an incense containing a fragrance combining plumeria and sandalwood. While plumeria is an ingredient in Indian &quot;champa&quot; incense, the extent of its use varies between family recipes. Most &quot;champa&quot; incenses also incorporate other tree resins, such as Halmaddi (&quot;Ailanthus triphysa&quot;) and benzoin resin, as well as other floral ingredients, including champaca (&quot;Magnolia champaca&quot;), geranium (&quot;Pelargonium graveolens&quot;), and vanilla (&quot;Vanilla planifolia&quot;) to produce a more intense, plumeria-like aroma.

In the Western Ghats of Karnataka, the bride and groom exchange garlands of cream-coloured plumeria during weddings. Red-colored flowers are not used in weddings in this region. Plumeria plants are found in most of the temples in these regions.

In Sri Lankan tradition, plumeria is associated with worship. One of the heavenly damsels in the frescoes of the fifth-century rock fortress Sigiriya holds a five-petalled flower in her right hand that is indistinguishable from plumeria.

In Eastern Africa, frangipani are sometimes referred to in Swahili love poems.

Some species of plumeria have been studied for their potential medicinal value.

== In Arts ==
The Plumeria (commonly known as Pomelia) inspired the composition Pomelie - Miniature for Two Guitars by Franco-Austrian composer Carlo Francesco Defranceschi, dedicated to Duo Imbesi Zangarà ( Carmelo Imbesi and Carmen Zangarà ). The recording of the piece was released in 2021 by the record label Classical Music 3.0, and the sheet music was published the same year by Rugginenti Classica.

<doc id="1015388" wikidata="Q1415536" url="?curid=1015388" title="Lokichogio">
<text>Lokichogio (also &quot;Lokichoggio&quot; or &quot;Lokichokio&quot;), is a town in the Turkana District in northwest Kenya (). It is often called Loki for short. The town lies on the A1 road, and is served by the Lokichogio Airport.

It is about 30 kilometers from the international border with South Sudan and hosts the UN offices (part of the Operation Lifeline Sudan program), around 49 NGOs, and a large orthopedic hospital run by the ICRC.

==History==
During the war (1983–2005) between what is now Southern Sudan to include Nuba Mountains, South Kordafan Province (technically now in Sudan), Loki was the singular re-supply logistics point for the SPLA. Many flights originated from Loki to re-supply SPLA units in Nuba Mountains under the leadership of Abdel Azziz. IO and NGO&#x27;s to include support from Uganda, Kenya, USA, Norway (Norwegian People&#x27;s Aid/NPA) and others were most prominent in supporting the SPLA/M . (Note: &quot;M&quot; or &quot;movement&quot; denotes the political representation of the Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army)

During the interim cease fire in early 2002 in Nuba Mountains, non-lethal logistical supplies were authorized by the government in Sudan at that time, termed the National Islamic Front (NIF) and now termed the National Congress Party (NCP). The only medical facility, as previously mentioned, was in Loki; anyone requiring medical attention had to be flown from Nuba Mountains, near Kauda to Loki.

In one case in early May 2002, a double stacked anti-tank mine(s) detonated just prior to the visit of Abdel Azziz killing two and wounding three other SPLA advisers. According to Randolph Hampton, an adviser on the ground in Nuba Mountains with the Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army/SPLA; one of the injured was Major Tutu, SPLA&#x27;s higher ranking officers. Major Tutu and two others were air evacuated after stripping the plane of seats; unfortunately, Major Tutu and one other died en route to Loki&#x27;s ICRC hospital due to lack of blood.

Today, Nuba Mountains remains aligned with Southern Sudan and Abdel Azziz is currently in Nuba Mountains, as late 2019 supporting the efforts to bring sustained peace and security to the nearly 1.5 million Nuba Mountains population.

==Geography==
Loki is the outermost Kenyan town on the border with South Sudan. Kenyans from the southern part of Loki, however, maintain that Lodwar is the last truly &quot;Kenyan&quot; town in the region, about 200 kilometers south. At the north end of Loki, beyond the noted dry river bed, the Kenya Defence Forces had set up a border checkpoint. This was initially considered the &quot;true&quot; border between Kenya and Sudan but was later moved in 2009 to a new checkpoint 2 km to Nadapal, the new checkpoint is manned by the Kenya Police officers, Border police unit and the Immigration department. The Sudanese checkpoint is 2 km away from this newly constructed checkpoint. The area known as &quot;no-man&#x27;s land&quot; is situated between these two checkpoints.

The Middle East Reformed Fellowship maintains a base here to administer diaconal aid to Sudan, a training centre for pastors and elders from Sudan, Kenya, and surrounding areas, and a broadcasting centre that prepares messages in the Dinka and Nuer languages.

==Demographics==
Local people are mainly nomads of the Turkana tribe and derive their livelihood by looking after indigenous cattle. Ninety kilometers south of Loki is Kakuma, one of the largest refugee camps in Kenya. Refugees from Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, the DRC, and several other surrounding countries can be found in Kakuma.

==Education==
Lokichogio Mixed Secondary School is in the community.

==In fiction==
The town has been mentioned several times in pieces of fiction dealing with UN and NGO aid activity there. It was featured in the John Le Carré book on which the 2005 film &quot;The Constant Gardener&quot; was based, and served as the setting for much of Philip Caputo&#x27;s novel, &quot;Acts of Faith&quot;.

<text>Hapgood is a play by Tom Stoppard, first produced in 1988. It is mainly about espionage, focusing on a British female spymaster (Hapgood) and her juggling of career and motherhood. The play also makes reference to quantum mechanics, including Niels Bohr&#x27;s &quot;The answer is the question interrogated&quot;; Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle; and the topological problem of the Seven Bridges of Königsberg. It is regarded as one of Stoppard’s weakest works.

==Productions==
In the original production in 1988, directed by Peter Wood, Felicity Kendal played Hapgood, Nigel Hawthorne played her friend and superior Blair and Roger Rees was their agent, the Soviet scientist Kerner. The production was a critical failure, and it was revised significantly in 1994 for the first New York production.

The play premiered in the US Off-Broadway at the Lincoln Center Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater on 11 November 1994 and closed on 26 March 1995. Directed by Jack O&#x27;Brien, the cast featured Josef Sommer (Blair), David Strathairn (Kerner) and Stockard Channing (Hapgood).
Jack O&#x27;Brien won the 1995 Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Director.

<text>Possible Worlds is a play written in 1990 by John Mighton. The author, Mighton, is a mathematician and philosopher. His plays tend to meld science, drama and math into one cohesive piece. It is part murder mystery, part science-fiction, and part mathematical philosophy and follows the multiple parallel lives of the main character George Barber. Mighton, a mathematician from University of Toronto&#x27;s Fields Institute, brought his considerable professional experience to bear on the writing of the play. 

At the play&#x27;s beginning, George is found dead, with his brain missing. Two detectives set out to uncover the truth behind his grisly death, and stumble upon several strange characters. This play may be classified as a sci-fi tragic drama The play itself does not have any music.

Possible Worlds won a Governor General&#x27;s Literary Award for Drama in 1992 alongside Short History of Night. 

A film adaptation of the same name was released in 2000. Directed by Robert Lepage and starring Tom McCamus and Tilda Swinton, it garnered wide critical acclaim, won two Genie Awards, and was nominated for a further four. The theatre book was published in 1997 by Playwrights Canada Press.

The play bears many conceptual similarities to Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Hapgood&quot;, a play about spies and secret agents that takes place primarily in the men&#x27;s changingroom of a municipal swimming baths.

==Plot synopsis==
The play begins with detectives Berkley and Williams at a crime scene where a man, identified as George Barber, has been murdered, the top of his head cut off and his brain stolen.

One of the detective is interviewing a neuroscientist (who we learn at the end of the play is named Pensfield) specializing on research of the nervous system. Pensfield has many brains in jars hooked up to life support and lights in his lab. He tells how a rat can only imagine so much and is limited by the structure of its brain. Creatures like humans that can anticipate possible futures and make contingency plans have an evolutionary advantage, according to him.

In what seems a flashback, George meets Joyce, a scientist, at a bar. This time he is luckier because she does not flat out reject his advances, rather invites George to call her. Joyce is doing research on how to improve intelligence and her specialization is in rat cortexes. Williams and Berkley are in their office with a rat brain from Pensfield&#x27;s lab. Williams tells Berkley about a course his wife wants him to take to increase intelligence and imagination.

George is back with Joyce, this time a stockbroker. He mismatches Joyce the stockbroker with Joyce the scientist about where they were born. George also tells Joyce about a dream with the slab and block men. In this dream, there is the Guide who is Pensfield. George and Joyce, now the scientist, are at her apartment filled with the same kind of stones that were in George&#x27;s dream. George convinces the workaholic Joyce to take time off from work and go to the beach with him.

Williams is listening to a tape from meditation teacher Jocelyn when Berkley interrupts him. They are visited by the caretaker of George&#x27;s Building. He tells them about seeing a UFO the night that George died and fears that “they” will kill him too. Later, they will find him frozen to death without a logical explanation.

Joyce is looking at a picture of the beach while telling George about a demonstration that was being held outside her lab in response to one of colleague&#x27;s work. Her college is keeping an ape&#x27;s brain alive. George is back with stockbroker Joyce who breaks up with him because she has been seeing someone else. Williams and Berkley talk about Louise, the rat brain. William feels bad for Louise and decides to take the brain back to the scientist because he is the only one who can “help” her.

George meets Joyce the scientist on a beach. She does not know George and she has a boyfriend. George tries to tell her that they were once married and lived together and it freaks her out. Joyce insists that he has her mixed up with someone else and tries to run from George. George attacks Joyce. He is then with a doctor who is Pensfield. George says when he&#x27;s dreaming, he sometimes thinks he is falling asleep.

Williams comes into the office and tells Berkley he has found the missing brains and Pensfield had them all along. He is arrested. Joyce Barber, George&#x27;s real life wife, is met by the detectives and told that her husband&#x27;s brain is alive and producing rudimentary consciousness in a very discontinuous “fluctuating dream state”.

George is again with Joyce on the beach. They see a blinking light in the ocean that goes out shortly afterwards before they can figure out what it was. The light is reminiscent of the light that came on with brain activity, suggesting the real Joyce agreed to terminate George consciousness.

== Style ==

Possible Worlds is a Post Modern Expressionist piece in that neither the relationship with the viewer or the subject is stable. The scenes are disjointed and it disrupts continuity which is what creates that unstable relationship with the viewer which can also put the play under the Style of Modernism. 

This play has many elements of many styles. At times it is mood driven and we are dealing with the hidden world inside George&#x27;s brain which would symbolism. But George is on a quest towards clarity and the setting is inside the main character&#x27;s mind, although most of the play we do not know that but nonetheless the play is mostly expressionistic. 

Possible worlds is also specifically post modern in that the setting varies and is somewhat unpredictable, the world are artificial and the meaning of the play comes with knowing the context.

The biggest Spectacle on stage in this play would be the image of the human and rat brain in glass containers hooked up to wires and lights.

==Language==

The language used in the play is modern but uses very little slang. During the scene with the block and slab men you hear throughout the scene the men saying “block” and “slab”. The Language that is used does not tend to have any elements of euphonic, but symbols tend to be fairly prevalent. 

Subtle hints in the script are what let us know what is really going on. Without certain lines like when George says, “I’m in a case.” He is not saying figuratively but it sees to be so, but he is literally in a case, his body in a casket and his brain in a jar at a science lab.

==Theme==

Possible Worlds addresses many controversial topics regarding today&#x27;s scientific advancements and the moral issues that relate to it. A main overriding theme is human emotions and how they are constructed and what they mean. This theme is there to be questioned not to be answered. 

Another main theme is that of the human consciousness and how the brain is able to construct it. This play is asking whether we should be allowed to figure out exactly how the brain works, essentially pitting every emotion thought and movement to a function in the brain, essentially turning all the mystery in to the light and making the brain seem like a machine. This is a controversial idea because to many people who study religion this could debunk their religious teachings. Religions tend to heavily rely on the idea of a spirit or a soul and if the brain were demystified then there would most likely be no room for a soul and this could lead to a large rebellion against the church. By keeping the brain human and not a machine it leaves room for a “miracle” or other unexplained happening which leaves room for religion. With the advancements in science we will most likely some day know exactly how the brain works but right now we are far from the answer but get closer all the time. The biggest road block is going to be with human testing because it is seen as immoral but without it the advancements in science may not happen. Whether that is to be allowed is a question up to the moral of the human populous as a whole.

== Plot analysis ==

Possible Worlds was written in such a way that it will be relevant to any era that is making advancements in neuroscience. 

This play opens up your mind to the possibilities of alternate dimensions, social constructs or worlds and then throws it to the ground in the end when all of it was a construct of the imagination. This play explores the human consciousness, morals and scientific advancement all in one, while adding a bit of romance. 

Possible Worlds is very discontinuous and hard to follow at times and the viewer must pay close attention to pick up the very subtle messages and themes.

==Character analysis==

George is the main character. He is in his 30s and in his “real life” is married to Joyce. George is a stock broker and is brilliant at math. He discovered at a young age about alternate lives that he could live when he was young doing a math problem, or so he says. In reality all of this is constructed inside George&#x27;s brain and never really takes place as far as we can tell. George is the Protagonist of the play although some of his actions throughout the play pose as blocks to what he wants. What he wants is to be loved by Joyce and be in a relationship with Joyce in every world that he encounters. George is also a semi-static character as far as the worlds go. George is always George while other characters appear in way that they would not in the real world. George stays the same through the play so that the viewer can connect with him and feel bad for him at the end. He is the only main “human” character because of how he does not really change from one world to the next.
 Joyce is George&#x27;s real life wife. In every world he pursues her. Sometimes he is successful and sometimes not. Joyce is a scientist on some worlds, a stock broker in others and in one entirely different construct she is Jocelyn, the teacher of a meditation type class focused at increasing intelligence through imagination. Joyce is one of the main antagonists of the play in most worlds. Especially in the world where she has a boyfriend because George can not reach his goal at all in the world. Joyce is also an agent of action because without her decisions George could not further pursue his goals or change his tactics to pursue new goals. 
 Berkley and Williams are detectives and they are in the real world. They are the voice of Justice and the morals in the world. They are pitted against the scientist and they tend to show that they feel bad for the brains being kept alive by Pensfield. They question Pensfield right to experiment on the brains while searching for the murderer of their case who turns out to be Pensfield. 
 Pensfield is the neuroscientist who is killing people and stealing their brains. In this plot line, which includes Berkley and Williams he is not only the antagonist but the bad guy. Pensfield shows up throughout the play as the Guide, the Scientist and the Doctor. Pensfield causes discomfort in the characters and the viewer and forces them to think about questions in morality, especially concerning science and man. The question that immediately jumps out is, is it ok to kill in the name of scientific advancement?
 The man is the caretaker of George&#x27;s building. He goes to the detectives with a story of seeing UFO lights the night that George was killed. They don&#x27;t believe him of course even when he says that “they” are going to kill him. Later the man shows up dead, frozen to death at room temperature which makes the detectives question what they are dealing with in these cases.

<text>Lucky Boys Confusion is an American rock band from the western suburbs of Chicago, Illinois, United States. Hailing from DuPage County, the band&#x27;s music is a mix of rock, punk, ska and hip hop. The band consists of vocalist Kaustubh &quot;Stubhy&quot; Pandav, guitarist/vocalist Adam Krier, bassist Jason Schultejann, and drummer Ryan Fergus. Guitarist and founding member Joe Sell (October 16, 1978 – May 15, 2012) was a member of the band until his death. Pandav and Krier write the majority of the band&#x27;s songs.

==History==
===Beginnings as an independent band===
Lucky Boys Confusion formed in 1997 shortly after the breakups of Pandav and Fergus&#x27;s band, Farmboy, and Krier and Sell&#x27;s band, Spinning Jenny. After recruiting Schultejann on bass, the group quickly released an EP, &quot;What Gets Me High&quot;. In late 1998 they released their name first full-length album, &quot;Growing Out of It&quot;, under their own label, Townstyle Records. The album contained the song &quot;Dumb Pop Song&quot;, which had gained airplay on Chicago alternative rock station Q101. In 2000, the band released &quot;The Soapbox Spectacle&quot;, featuring a new version of &quot;Fred Astaire&quot;, and five new songs. During this time, the band recorded a video for &quot;Dumb Pop Song&quot;.

===Elektra Records, mainstream success===
In 2000, the band signed a major-label deal with Elektra Records. They headed to California in the fall of that year to begin recording the album &quot;Throwing the Game&quot;, which was released on May 8, 2001. It featured new versions of songs from their first two releases and several new songs, including a cover of Jocelyn Enriquez&#x27;s &quot;Do You Miss Me?&quot;. The band also released a video for the song &quot;Bossman&quot; featuring Beenie Man. In 2008, &quot;Bossman&quot; was featured in a commercial for the gum Extra.

Their second effort for Elektra Records, &quot;Commitment&quot;, proved to be their most popular record. Michael Miguel Happoldt produced the album, which contained fifteen new songs that shifted from ska or hip hop influences to pop rock influences. The band recorded a video for &quot;Hey Driver&quot;, and the song was featured in the movies &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;, &quot;Without a Paddle&quot;, and &quot;New York Minute&quot;, and the video game &quot;MVP Baseball 2004&quot;.

===Hiatus===
In 2004, the band was dropped by Elektra Records. After mockingly referring to the company as &quot;Neglektra&quot;, the band members were happy to have a fresh start. In August 2005, the band independently released &quot;The Red Tape Outtakes (Demos And Heartbreaks)&quot;, a 12-song collection of unreleased tracks and outtakes.

The band released &quot;How to Get Out Alive&quot; on June 13, 2006. It contained four new songs and a cover of Dramarama&#x27;s &quot;Anything, Anything&quot;.

On September 20, 2006, the band announced via its Myspace page that they were going on hiatus and quelled rumors of a breakup in a message the following day that it was only a &quot;short break&quot; and that fans shouldn&#x27;t worry. At their final show before the hiatus in Iowa City, Iowa, the band assured concertgoers that their annual &#x27;Songs from a Scene&#x27; concerts would go on in December at the Metro in Chicago after they returned to a sense of &quot;normality&quot; over the next few months.

On December 29, 2006, at Songs from a Scene, the band released &quot;Live and Acoustic (Recorded at the Beat Kitchen)&quot;. It is the band&#x27;s first live album.

===Side projects===
In late 2006, Pandav, along with Chicago DJ&#x27;s JJ Flores and Steve Smooth, recorded an EP under the name Shock Stars. The album was released on March 6, 2007, in CD and digital formats. Shock Stars played their first live show at Double Door. Shock Stars broke up in 2009.

In May 2007, Krier, Schultejann, and drummer Chris Smith of 15 Minutes Late and Logan Square, formed a side project, American Taxi. Their first single, &quot;The Mistake&quot;, was released on Memorial Day 2007 on their Myspace page. American Taxi has since released an EP entitled &quot;Runaway Songs&quot;, containing &quot;The Mistake&quot; and five other tracks.

In April 2009, American Taxi was signed to Virgin Records and changed its name to AM Taxi to differentiate from bluegrass group Great American Taxi.

In June 2009, Pandav recorded vocals for local Chicago rappers Saurus and Bones on the song &quot;What&#x27;s It Gonna Take?&quot; from their debut album &quot;Mind Like Mine&quot;.

In the summer of 2010, Pandav formed a band, The Super Happy Fun Club, with Pat Gilroy, Jeremy Galanes, and Chris Mason of Close Enough, Onelife, and The Waiting Game, Brad Chagdes of 15 Minutes Late and Logan Square, and Phil Kosch of Treaty of Paris. Their first EP, &quot;Go Fun Yourself&quot;, was released June 2011.

===&quot;Closing Arguments&quot;===
In December 2008 at Songs from a Scene, Lucky Boys Confusion announced that they would be releasing a new album in 2009. The new album, &quot;Closing Arguments&quot;, contains old demos and rare songs as well as a new song, &quot;This Town Ain&#x27;t Big Enough for Both of Us&quot;. It was released without advance promotion to digital retailers. &quot;Closing Arguments&quot; was released physically on June 23, 2009.

===End of Songs from a Scene===
On December 26, 2009, Pandav announced that the Songs from a Scene would end with the 2010 performances.

===Death of Joe Sell===
Sell was found dead in Chicago on May 15, 2012, at 33.

===Current work===
The band plays shows in and around Chicago. In April 2016, Pandav, Krier, and Schultejann confirmed that a new album was in the works. The band&#x27;s Twitter confirmed in early December that the album would be released in the Spring of 2017, and on January 1, 2017, announced that the album would be named &quot;STORMCHASERS&quot;. On January 23, the band announced that Stormchasers would be released on April 11, 2017. Pandav sang backup vocals on a cover by Chicago rock band OUTDrejas of Dayman from It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, which was released on February 1, 2019.

<doc id="1015405" wikidata="Q7179796" url="?curid=1015405" title="Pfister (firm)">
<text>Pfister, called Price Pfister until 2010, is an American manufacturer of bathroom and lavatory faucets, shower systems, showerheads and accessories, kitchen faucets and other plumbing fixtures. Emil Price and William Pfister founded the company in 1910. Today, Pfister is owned by Assa Abloy.

==History==
Price Pfister was founded by Emil Price and William Pfister in Los Angeles in 1910, when the company introduced its first product, a garden faucet. Over the next decade, Price Pfister’s product line expanded to include other types of faucets, valves and hose nozzles for indoor sinks and bathtubs. Aside from producing plumbing fixtures, during World War I and World War II, Price Pfister produced military items such as aircraft fittings and hand grenade shells. 

In 1941, the firm was purchased by Isadore Familian. During the postwar housing boom in the late 1940s, Price Pfister began to specialize in residential products. The company became a household name after the widespread popularity of their Crown Jewel faucet line in 1950. From 1960-1970, Price Pfister accelerated in growth, starting with the construction of a manufacturing plant in Pacoima, California, which became the largest foundry West of the Mississippi. In 1969, Price Pfister was acquired by Norris Industries, Inc.

Price Pfister is still remembered for its tagline playing off the distinctive company name: &quot;Price Pfister, the Pfabulous Pfaucet with the Pfunny name&quot;. By 1987, Price Pfister had gained 14% of the U.S. faucet market. Two years later, Price Pfister was acquired by the Black and Decker Corporation. In 1994, Price Pfister became the first manufacturer to convert to ceramic cartridges, which enabled the industry’s first lifetime guarantee against leaks and drips.

===Pacoima plant closure===
In January 1996, Price Pfister agreed to a $2.4 million settlement in a California lawsuit against their manufacturing method which introduced amounts of lead into their faucets that were in excess of those legally allowed under California&#x27;s Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986. The state sued more than 20 faucet manufacturers, with lab tests showing that Price Pfister had the second-highest amount of lead in their faucets. They were forced to change their process from antiquated sand-casting to machining which is more expensive. Rival manufacturer Chicago Faucets still used sand-casting as well, but switched to using bismuth over lead as a sealing alloy, allowing them to keep jobs within the United States. Other rivals such as Delta had long since switched their U.S. plants to more advanced forms of manufacturing.

In 1996, Price Pfister shut down its foundry in the U.S. as they began moving jobs over into Mexico, laying off 300 of the 1200 U.S. jobs at their plant in Pacoima, California. To protest the layoffs and limited severance packages, ten of the workers went on hunger strikes, and on day ten of the strike one of them collapsed and required medical attention. The company blamed the cutbacks on state regulations that limited the amount of lead allowed in faucets. A local labor activist group leader stated that the company was &quot;using environmental issues as a scapegoat&quot; since rival companies had already managed to improve their manufacturing within the U.S. The Teamsters local negotiator claimed that the move was due in part to the cheaper cost of labor over in Mexico, stating that the wages at the plant were $17 an hour including benefits, while in Mexico the wages were $1 or less. The new president, Ron Cooper, stated that the remaining 900 jobs might soon be moved as well, since the Pacoima plant would be too large for their needs. Regardless of where they moved, the 450 factory workers would be laid off and a new staff would be hired.

In March 1997, Price Pfister moved more of its manufacturing operations from the Pacoima plant over to Mexicali, Mexico, laying off approximately 300 U.S. workers. Many of the former workers protested the layoffs outside the plant, and later called for a boycotting of Price Pfister while protesting a nearby Home Depot, a home improvement store that sold Price Pfister products.

The Pacoima plant closed down completely in 1997. In 2005, Lowe&#x27;s planned to build a home improvement store on the lot of the former plant. LA Weekly writer Steven Mikulan said that the move was ironic: the plant used to serve as a hub where U.S.-made Price Pfister products were shipped out from, and the place would instead now be selling those items received from elsewhere. The plant was once the city&#x27;s largest employer and left the area with severe amounts of pollution. After its closing a survey found that 28% of nearby residents had chronic respiratory problems.

===Spectrum Brands Holdings===
Joining Kwikset security hardware in 1999, Price Pfister and Kwikset formed the Black and Decker Hardware and Home Improvement Group, based in Lake Forest, California. Following the 2010 Stanley acquisition of Black and Decker, Price Pfister became part of the Stanley Black and Decker Hardware and Home Improvement Group. Following the merger, Price Pfister changed its name to simply Pfister.

On October 9, 2012, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Stanley Black &amp; Decker had agreed to sell its Hardware and Home Improvement Group, including Pfister, to Spectrum Brands Holdings. The acquisition was completed on December 17, 2012, for $1.4 billion.

===Sale to Assa Abloy===
In 2021, Spectrum Brands agreed to sell its Hardware and Home Improvement (HHI) division to Assa Abloy. The deal closed in June 2023.

==Products==
Pfister&#x27;s retail bath and kitchen fixtures are available in major hardware and home improvement stores and showrooms throughout North America. Pfister products&#x27; price range generally is somewhat lower than those of competitors such as Moen and Delta, but higher than those of private label brands such as The Home Depot&#x27;s Glacier Bay and Delta&#x27;s low-cost Peerless brand. Besides residential products, Pfister also manufactures a custom-designed fixture faucet line, PFISTER Custom Faucet Solutions, for the hospitality industry.

<doc id="1015412" wikidata="Q1422925" url="?curid=1015412" title="Battle of Val-ès-Dunes">
<text>The Battle of Val-ès-Dunes was fought in 1047 by the combined forces of the Norman duke William I and the French king Henry I against the forces of several rebel Norman barons, led by William&#x27;s cousin Guy of Brionne.

As a result of winning the battle, William was able to retain his title and maintain control over the western half of his duchy.

== Background ==
William had succeeded to his title in 1035, as the seven-year-old illegitimate son of the previous Duke, Robert I. Several of William&#x27;s kinsmen (including Guy of Burgundy, his cousin) believed themselves to have a better claim to the title, but William had the support of King Henry I and other influential nobles.

In 1046, some of William&#x27;s enemies decided to finally strike. After an ambush near Valognes on the Cotentin Peninsula failed, the rebel nobles—Guy of Burgundy, , Rannulf of the Bessin, Ralph Tesson of Thury, Grimoald of Plessis, and Hamon Dentatus (Haimo of Creully)—raised an army of about 25,000 men.

After escaping the ambush, William rode directly to King Henry&#x27;s court in Poissy, and reminded the king that a revolt against his faithful vassal was a revolt against himself. Wanting to protect his vassal and ally, King Henry raised an army of about 10,000 men to march on Normandy.

== Battle ==
In the summer of 1047, King Henry&#x27;s army joined Duke William&#x27;s (the conqueror) much smaller Norman army near Caen, in the heart of rebel territory. During the first part of the battle, Ralph Tesson realized on which side allegiance truly lay, and he and his men then changed sides and joined the royal army, attacking the rebels from the rear. The next day, the armies fought on the plain of Val-ès-Dunes, near the present-day town of Conteville.

The battle consisted mainly of a series of cavalry skirmishes. The rebel army outnumbered the royal army, but it lacked the latter&#x27;s coordination and leadership. Haimo of Creully (Haimon or Hamo Dentatus) unhorsed King Henry, but was killed before he could injure him. After losing several skirmishes, the rebel army broke apart, panicked, and fled to the west. The royal army pursued closely, slaughtering rebels by the thousands and driving the remnants of their army into the Orne River, near the Athis fort and Fleury-sur-Orne. An observer recorded that the bodies of the rebel knights who tried to cross the Orne were so numerous that bloated bodies blocked the mill of Barbillon as the river carried them downstream &quot;en masse&quot;.

The battle is traditionally said to have taken place on 10 August, but there is no decisive evidence for this date. The historian David Douglas argues for a date early in 1047 on the ground that the drowning of the fleeing army indicates that the Orne was flooded, which points to the winter or spring. However, David Bates dismisses this argument as the tidal nature of the Orne would account for the drownings. In his view, the battle almost certainly took place in the summer.

== Aftermath ==
While the royal army drove much of the rebel army to the west, Gui of Burgundy and his surviving forces escaped to his lands in the east and holed up in the strategic castle of Brionne. Despite an energetic siege, William was not able to force the castle into surrender until 1050, and, during that time, he was not able to assert his authority in the eastern third of his duchy, which lay beyond Brionne.

After the Battle of Val-ès-Dunes, there was still strong opposition to William among the Norman nobles, but they were forced to declare a &quot;Truce of God&quot; at Caen in October 1047. This truce, backed by the full endorsement of the Church, stated that private wars or vendettas were prohibited from Wednesday evening to Monday morning. The truce gave William special rights to defend his title and the public order; he did not, along with King Henry I, have to abide by the order. Even though William&#x27;s position was still weak, with Gui of Burgundy still holding out and William having to pardon many of the barons who had opposed him, it would be five years before he had to face another major revolt.

<doc id="1015419" wikidata="Q803863" url="?curid=1015419" title="Biographia Literaria">
<text>The Biographia Literaria is a critical autobiography by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, published in 1817 in two volumes. Its working title was &#x27;Autobiographia Literaria&#x27;. The formative influences on the work were William Wordsworth&#x27;s theory of poetry, the Kantian view of imagination as a shaping power (for which Coleridge later coined the neologism &quot;esemplastic&quot;), various post-Kantian writers including F. W. J. von Schelling, and the earlier influences of the empiricist school, including David Hartley and the Associationist psychology.

==Structure and tone==
The work is long and seemingly loosely structured, and although there are autobiographical elements, it is not a straightforward or linear autobiography. Its subtitle, &#x27;Biographical Sketches of My Literary Life and Opinions&#x27;, alludes to &quot;The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman&quot; by Laurence Sterne, suggesting that the formal qualities of the &quot;Biographia&quot; are intentional. The form is also meditative. As Kathleen Wheeler shows, the work is playful and acutely aware of the active role of the reader in reading.

==Critical reaction==

Critics have reacted strongly to the &quot;Biographia Literaria&quot;. Some early readers thought it demonstrated Coleridge&#x27;s opiate-driven decline into ill health, and soon after Coleridge&#x27;s death he was accused of plagiarising Schelling. By the early twentieth century, however, it had emerged as a major if puzzling work in criticism and theory, with George Saintsbury placing Coleridge next to Aristotle and Longinus in his influential &quot;History&quot; of 1902-04. Recent criticism has been divided between those who think that the &quot;Biographia&quot;″s philosophical pretensions were illusory, and those who take the philosophy seriously. While contemporary critics recognize the degree to which Coleridge borrowed from his sources (with passages lifted straight from Schelling), they also see in the work far more structure and planning than is apparent on first glance.

==Content==
The work was originally intended as a preface to a collected volume of Coleridge&#x27;s poems, explaining and justifying his own style and practice in poetry. The work grew to a literary autobiography, covering his education and studies, and his early literary adventures, an extended criticism of William Wordsworth&#x27;s theory of poetry as given in the Preface to the &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot; (a work on which Coleridge collaborated), and a statement of his philosophical views.

==Imagination==

The first volume is mainly concerned with the evolution of Coleridge&#x27;s philosophical views. At first an adherent of the associationist psychology of the philosopher David Hartley, he came to discard this mechanical system for the belief that the mind is not a passive but an active agent in the apprehension of reality. The author believed in the &quot;self-sufficing power of absolute Genius&quot; and distinguished between genius and talent as between &quot;an egg and an egg-shell&quot;. The first volume culminates in his gnomic definition of the imagination or &quot;esemplastic power&quot;, the faculty by which the soul perceives the spiritual unity of the universe, as distinguished from the fancy or merely associative function. Coleridge writes:

The famous definition of the imagination emerges from a discussion of Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling, amongst others. (Being fluent in German, Coleridge was one of the first major English literary figures to discuss Schelling&#x27;s ideas, in particular.) The primary imagination is that which we use in our everyday perception of things in the world.
* When Coleridge&#x27;s God creates nature, He makes nature a reflection of the formal qualities of the Son, the second person in the Trinity. The primary imagination (by which we perceive nature) is thus &#x27;a repetition in the finite mind of the eternal act of creation in the infinite I AM&#x27;.
* However, the later Coleridge took a darker view of nature and the human imagination, viewing both as fallen and referring to his definition in the &quot;Biographia&quot; as &#x27;unformed and immature&#x27;.

==Wordsworth and poetic diction==

The later chapters of the book deal with the nature of poetry and with the question of poetic diction raised by Wordsworth. While maintaining a general agreement with Wordsworth&#x27;s point of view, Coleridge elaborately refutes his principle that the language of poetry should be one taken with due exceptions from the mouths of men in real life, and that there can be no essential difference between the language of prose and of metrical composition. A critique on the qualities of Wordsworth&#x27;s poetry concludes the volume.

The book contains Coleridge&#x27;s celebrated and vexed distinction between &quot;imagination&quot; and &quot;fancy&quot;. Chapter XIV is the origin of the famous critical concept of the &quot;willing suspension of disbelief&quot; when reading poetic works.

==The missing transcendental deduction==

At the beginning of chapter 13, Coleridge attempts to bring his philosophical argument to a head with the following claim:

DESCARTES, speaking as a naturalist, and in imitation of Archimedes, said, give me matter and motion and I will construct you the universe... In the same sense the transcendental philosopher says; grant me a nature having two contrary forces, the one of which tends to expand infinitely, while the other strives to apprehend or find itself in this infinity, and I will cause the world of intelligences with the whole system of their representations to rise up before you. 

The two forces were derived from Schelling&#x27;s &quot;System of Transcendental Idealism&quot; of 1800. In that work, Schelling offers the first systematic use of dialectic (thesis, antithesis and synthesis), though it is not a term he uses.

Dialectic only works if the original term (the thesis) already contains its opposite within itself. Schelling derived this original duality by arguing that:

# knowledge requires a relation between subject and object, and
# if there is a relation between subject and object, they must have something in common: an original union.

We thus have an origin for all things known in this world, an origin which is both a unity and something characterised by division (into two forces which foreshadow the subject/object distinction). The division supplies the two forces Coleridge mentioned.

Coleridge had clearly hoped to modify Schelling&#x27;s argument (the transcendental deduction) so as to put it in a conservative, Trinitarian context. However, with half of the &quot;Biographia&quot; already printed, Coleridge realised that his proposed modifications were not going to work, a crisis he solved by inventing a &quot;letter from a friend&quot; advising him to skip the deduction and move straight to the conclusion. It was a brilliant rhetorical solution, but also a decision which laid him open to charges of philosophical dilettantism and plagiarism, subjects of much controversy. The underlying problem is that Schelling&#x27;s dialectic does not ever supply a final synthesis in which the two forces find equilibrium (a moment of true self-instantiation), which means that they cannot account for a Trinitarian God who is the origin of all things.

Reid and Perkins argue that in September 1818 Coleridge solved the technical problems he had earlier faced in the &quot;Biographia&quot;, and that he provides a firmer foundation for the Schelling&#x27;s two forces in the &quot;Opus Maximum&quot;, where he offered a critique of the form of logic underlying Schelling&#x27;s system. In the &quot;Opus Maximum&quot; the two forces are the ground of the finite or human realm, but the true origin of all things lies in the Trinity. For Coleridge, the Trinity is the form in which the divine will instantiates itself, in a way which avoids the infinite deferral of a final synthesis in Schelling argument, and which does not derive from Schelling&#x27;s two forces.

<doc id="1015421" wikidata="Q3303833" url="?curid=1015421" title="British Rail Class 170">
<text>The British Rail Class 170 &quot;Turbostar&quot; is a British diesel-hydraulic multiple unit passenger train designed and built by Adtranz, and later by Bombardier Transportation, at Derby Litchurch Lane Works. 

The Class 170 was derived from the British Rail Class 165 and 166 DMUs, known as the &quot;Networker Turbos&quot;, of the 1990s. The first units were introduced to service in 1999, shortly after the privatisation of British Rail; they have been commonly used to operate regional as well as long-distance services, and to a lesser extent suburban services. A total of 139 units were built, but some were later converted to and units. These trains are currently in use with CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway, Northern Trains and ScotRail.

==Design==

The Class 170 diesel multiple unit (DMU) is a development of the design used in the British Rail Class 165 and 166 DMUs known as the &quot;Networker Turbos&quot; and built by British Rail Engineering Limited and later ABB Transportation before that company became part of Bombardier.

Notable features shared are the aluminium alloy frame and Voith transmission as well as the general body shape (the cab ends are similar to those of the Class 168, but not Class 165/166), interior design and door fittings. The final drive is sourced from ZF instead of Gmeinder and the diesel-engine supplier is MTU.

The engine and transmission are located under the body. One bogie per coach is powered. All coaches in the set are powered when in use (there are no unpowered trailers). The units can work in multiple with trains in the 15X series, i.e. &quot;Sprinters&quot; and 14X &quot;Pacers&quot; (the latter empty only), and with other units of the same class. They are unable to operate in multiple with units in the 16X series due to different wiring arrangements.

Seating arrangements are of both 2+1 (first class) and 2+2 (standard class) formation, and give a seated passenger capacity of between ~100 and ~200 per three-car set (depending on the specifications of the operator). Two-car sets are also operated.

===Subclasses===
Class 170 units have been categorised into six (originally seven) sub-classes; the basic specifications remain the same (engine, length, transmission, etc.), the differences being the seating arrangements specified by the different operators. Because of the different interior fittings the sub-classes differ in weight from one another by a small amount, up to around 2tonnes.

All the sub-classes were built at Derby works either under Adtranz or Bombardier Transportation ownership. The change of ownership occurred in 2001, but early Bombardier units (such as the 2002 two-car 170/2 Phase 2 units) still display ADtranz branding, such as on the window glazing, due to use of backstocked parts.

==Current operations==

Most units are owned by Porterbrook, although units 170416–424 are owned by Eversholt Rail Group. They are leased to the train operating companies.

=== ScotRail ===

ScotRail was the largest operator of the Class 170, with a fleet which formerly comprised 59 three-car sets but has since been reduced to 30 sets. All units are allocated to Edinburgh Haymarket depot.

The first Class 170s in Scotland were 24 units built for ScotRail (National Express) between 1999 and 2001 (170401–170424), which had first-class accommodation for use on ScotRail Express services (i.e. the Edinburgh–Glasgow Queen Street shuttle) and Aberdeen/Inverness–Glasgow/Edinburgh services. A further ten similar units (170425–170434) were built in 20032004 to complete the conversion of ScotRail Express services from Class 158 to Class 170 operation. By the time the second batch entered service the franchise had passed to First ScotRail.

Two standard-class only units were provided for Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT) services from Glasgow Queen Street in 2001 (170470–170471), followed in 20042005 by seven more units for SPT (170472–170478) and 12 similar units for Edinburgh commuter services (170450–170461). In December 2008, six of the standard-class-only units (170450–170455) were fitted with first-class sections, and two more (170456 and 170457) were fitted with first class in December 2011.

A further four three-car sets (170393–170396) with first class accommodation and &#x27;mini-buffets&#x27;, were obtained from Hull Trains in 2005, bringing the First ScotRail Class 170 fleet up to a peak of 59 three-car sets. The former Hull Trains units were initially used on ScotRail Express services to Inverness, but by 2012 the buffets were out of use and all four units were converted to standard class only.

The nine units built for SPT services were delivered in SPT livery, whereas the rest of the fleet carried First ScotRail livery (170401–170424 having originally worn the National Express ScotRail &#x27;swoosh&#x27; livery). In September 2008, the Scottish Government&#x27;s agency Transport Scotland announced that all ScotRail trains (including from the Strathclyde Partnership for Transport) would eventually be repainted in a new blue livery with white Saltire markings on the carriage ends.

In April 2015, the ScotRail franchise passed from First to Abellio, and nine units owned by Eversholt went off-lease. Five of these units (170416–170420) remained in Scotland on short-term lease to Abellio ScotRail (albeit with ScotRail branding removed) until their transfer to East Midlands Railway in 2020, whilst the other four units (170421–170424) were converted into Class 171s for their new operator Southern.

As a result of the electrification of the Edinburgh to Glasgow Queen Street line in 2018 and the conversion of ScotRail Express services to Aberdeen and Inverness to HSTs in 20182019, the Class 170s are being displaced from ScotRail Express routes. Additionally, electrification of most of the Glasgow Queen Street (High Level) commuter lines and of the Edinburgh to Dunblane route will see Class 170s displaced from these services once the Class 385 EMU fleet is fully operational. Some of the surplus Class 170s will be cascaded to other ScotRail services replacing older Class 156 and 158 units, but 16 units were transferred to Arriva Rail North (170453–170461 and 170472–170478). The first four of these units moved to Northern in March 2018, followed by a further four in August 2018.

=== Northern Trains ===

Arriva Rail North began operating the Class 170 in 2018, with a total of 16 three-car units (170453-170461 and 170472-170478) received from Abellio ScotRail by January 2019. These can now be seen operating services between Sheffield and Scarborough via Hull and have diagrams around the Harrogate Loop, on which they share duties with Class 158 DMUs. The units are maintained at Neville Hill TMD and Botanic Gardens TMD as well as light maintenance at Sheffield.

On 1 March 2020, these units transferred to new operator Northern Trains.

=== East Midlands Railway ===

East Midlands Railway operates the largest fleet of 170s, currently consisting of 43 total two-car and three-car sets.

From 23 March 2020, East Midlands Railway received its first two Class 170 units in the form of three-car 170416 and 170417, when they moved from Abellio ScotRail. The former was seen in EMR livery on 30 April 2020.

Unit 170417, named &quot;The Key Worker&quot;, was the first unit to enter service, doing so on 2 November 2020 on the Robin Hood line, as part of EMR&#x27;s soft launch of the class.

Alongside units 170418–170420 (also from ScotRail), EMR planned to become the largest operator of the Class 170; a further 23 units arrived from West Midlands Trains as well as 12 from Transport for Wales Rail. The 170s have replaced units of classes 153 and 156.

In September 2022, three Class 171s, having been reformed to three-car formations and renumbered to 170422–170424, transferred from Southern to East Midlands Railway. They were then renumbered to 170/9s before entering service in order to emphasise the difference between them and the rest of the fleet as they had Dellner couplers rather than BSI couplers so they were not compatible with the rest of the fleet. They regained their identities as 170/4s when BSI were fitted in May 2023 and they can now work with the rest of the fleet instead of being on self contained diagrams.

=== CrossCountry ===

CrossCountry currently operates 29 Class 170 Turbostars (seven two-car and 22 three-car) on services between Cardiff Central and Nottingham, and between Birmingham, Leicester, and Stansted Airport. After being acquired in 2007, these units were refurbished in 2008 with the then three-car units repainted at Marcroft Engineering, Stoke-on-Trent, the then two-car units at EWS&#x27; Toton depot and the interiors done by Transys Projects, Clacton-on-Sea including the fitting of first-class seating to the Class 170/5s and 170/6s.

In 2021, the centre cars from the six formerly three-car ex-West Midlands Railway (WMR) 170s were transferred to CrossCountry and inserted into six of its formerly two-car units, turning them into three-car units while retaining the CrossCountry driving vehicles&#x27; first class, due to the ex-WMR driving vehicles being standard class-only (East Midlands Railway had leased the aforementioned ex-WMR units, but only required two-car units from that batch, therefore CrossCountry was able to utilise the surplus centre cars). This resulted in a reconfiguration of CrossCountry&#x27;s 29 170s from their previous 13 two-car and 16 three-car units, to their current seven two-car and 22 three-car units. The extra centre cars were re-liveried and internally refurbished to match the units they were inserted into.

==Former operations==
=== First TransPennine Express ===

From late 2006 to 2016, First TransPennine Express operated nine Class 170s, used on the Manchester Piccadilly to Hull route. Originally Class 185s were set to operate the route but a combination of weight-restriction problems on the Selby to Hull Line, chronic overcrowding on several of the company&#x27;s services and the government reducing the amount of money available to First TransPennine Express for new trains resulted in Class 170s coming into service.

First TransPennine Express received eight Turbostars from South West Trains, 170301–308 at the end of 2006 and the start of 2007, as well as 170399 from Central Trains in November 2007, which was renumbered 170309.

From September 2009, two Class 170s were used Sundays to Thursdays on the Cleethorpes–Manchester Airport service.

The units were maintained by Bombardier Crofton. The 170s have since been fully refurbished to include CCTV, power sockets throughout, replacement carpets and seat covers and the removal / declassification of one of the two first-class sections, providing more seats. The work was carried out by Transys at Clacton-on-Sea.

However, in March 2014 it was revealed that the nine Turbostars would move to Chiltern Railways. MP Stephen Hammond revealed on 12 March 2014 that all the Class 170/3s would remain with First TransPennine Express until the May 2015 timetable change, when Chiltern would take five of the 170s with the remaining four remaining with First TransPennine Express until the end of the franchise in March 2016 later changed to 8 July 2016. Upon delivery, the Class 170s were modified in Brush Traction to allow them to be used with Chiltern&#x27;s existing units, and were subsequently reclassified as Class 168/3s. Today, the unit numbers are 168321–168329.

However it was confirmed in November 2018 that TransPennine Express would be hiring one Class 170 per day from Northern to run services on the Manchester/Leeds and Huddersfield local services to allow more Class 185s to be used on other busier services until the new Nova Fleets arrive in 2019. This arrangement ended in May 2019 when Northern&#x27;s subleased Class 185 units returned to TPE.

=== Hull Trains ===

Hull Trains began its to Hull services in September 2000 using Turbostars, initially with four sets on short-term lease from Anglia Railways. In 2004, it received four of its own three-car Class 170/3 units, and returned the original units to Anglia.

In 2005, following its acquisition by FirstGroup, Hull Trains received four new Class 222/1 &quot;Pioneer&quot; units and transferred the Turbostars to its sister company First ScotRail.

=== Midland Mainline ===

Midland Mainline (MML) was the first operator to order Turbostars, the first being delivered in November 1998 and entering service in May 1999. The Class 170/1 units were built immediately after the Class 168/0 units were built for Chiltern Railways. MML ordered a fleet of 17 two-car Class 170 units, although the first ten were subsequently made up of three cars each instead. These were numbered 170101–117. The units were introduced on stopping services from London St Pancras to , and . They were also used on summer Saturday services from London to , which later became a year-round service with summer extension to . Class 170s were also used on direct services between London St Pancras and , these services ended upon the replacement of the Class 170s with new Class 222 &quot;Meridian&quot; units due to weight restrictions on the Derwent Valley line to Matlock.

In 2004, Midland Mainline introduced new Class 222 &quot;Meridian&quot; units, which started to replace the &quot;Turbostars&quot;. As a result, the fleet was transferred to sister company Central Trains. Ten units (170101–170110) are three-car units, and the remaining seven units (170111–170117) are two-car units. As with the three spot-hire units from Porterbrook, these 17 units had first-class accommodation, which was declassified.

=== Central Trains ===
Central Trains operated a fleet of 53 Class 170 units from various subclasses. In 1999, Central received its first batch of twenty-three two-car Class 170/5 and ten three-car Class 170/6 units. These were used to replace Class 156 units on various longer-distance services.

From late 2004, Central also took three Class 170/3 on lease from Porterbrook. Units 170397–8 are three-car units and 170399 is a two-car unit. All three of these units contained first-class accommodation, which was declassified (allowing standard-class use throughout the train), as first class travel was not provided on Central Trains services. The two three-car units&#x27; interiors were of Central Trains style, except the MML-style first class, and the two-car unit had a South West Trains interior. After the Central Trains franchise ended, the two three-car units (170397 and 170398) remained with the new operator, CrossCountry. The one two-car unit was returned to Porterbrook, which subsequently leased it to First TransPennine Express who renumbered the unit to 170309.

All Class 170 units in service with Central were used on a variety of services (mostly long-distance) including Birmingham–Stansted Airport, Nottingham–Cardiff and Birmingham–Leicester. Class 170 units have been replaced by Class 350 &quot;Desiro&quot; units on to services.

When Central Trains lost its franchise in 2007, 23 of Central Trains&#x27; units (17 two-coach and six three-coach) were transferred to London Midland, which took over the West Midlands franchise and continued to use Class 170s for services on the Chase Line, Birmingham to Hereford via Bromsgrove Line and Shrewsbury services. 29 out of the remaining 30 units (including the ex-Midland Mainline units and two out of the three spot hire units) were transferred to CrossCountry, which took over the Cardiff-Birmingham-Nottingham and Birmingham-Leicester-Stansted Airport services.

One of Central Trains&#x27; 170s (170399) went to First TransPennine Express and was subsequently renumbered 170309; East Midlands Trains did not receive any, despite taking over the previously Class-170-operated Liverpool-to-Norwich route. This route is now operated by refurbished units.

=== Greater Anglia ===

Anglia Railways ordered two batches of Turbostars. The first batch of eight three-car Class 170/2 units were built between 1999 and 2000 for London Liverpool Street to Ipswich, Norwich, Lowestoft and Bury St. Edmunds services. These supplemented the existing Class 86 locomotive-hauled trains from London to Norwich. Four of these units were later hired to Hull Trains from 2002–2004, before that company acquired its own Turbostars.

Other units, including the spot-hire set 170399, were used on Anglia&#x27;s short-lived Norwich to Basingstoke &#x27;London Crosslink&#x27; service. In 2002, Anglia introduced a new Cambridge to Norwich direct service, and acquired four two-car units dedicated to working these services.
In 2004, the Greater Anglia franchise was won by National Express subsidiary One, rebranded as National Express East Anglia in 2008, and passed onto Abellio Greater Anglia in 2012. Since then, two-car Turbostars have been used for the Cambridge to Norwich route, and also on new through services including Cambridge (via Ipswich), Bury St Edmunds (via Ipswich), Peterborough (via Ipswich) and Lowestoft (via Ipswich and East Suffolk Line or Ipswich and Norwich) - London Liverpool Street via Ipswich, although with a new timetable all Class 170 London services ended in December 2010, in favour of connecting branch line trains with GEML expresses.

The three-car trains used to include a buffet and larger first-class area, but because more seating was needed, the buffet area has been removed and the number of first-class seats reduced.

In late 2019, these units were displaced by Class 755s and transferred to Transport for Wales by February 2020.

=== South West Trains ===

South West Trains (SWT) acquired a fleet of eight two-car Class 170/3 units in 2000 (later to nine units supplemented by ex-Southern 170392), to supplement its existing Class 159 fleet. Units operated on London Waterloo to , to , Southampton local services, and occasionally on services to Exeter St Davids, though this was not a regular route for these units, as they do not feature end gangways, making it difficult to provide trolley services, and they lacked selective door opening for the short platforms at stations on the route west of Salisbury. All but one of these units were transferred to First TransPennine Express at the end of 2006, in exchange for some Class 158 Express Sprinters. Unit 170392 was transferred back to its original intended operator Southern and has since been reclassified and renumbered from 170392 to 171730.

===Govia Thameslink Railway===

Southern obtained six two-car Class 170/7 units, along with six four-car Class 171/8 units, in 2003 to replace its slam-door Class 205 and Class 207 units on services on the Marshlink Line and Oxted Line to Uckfield.

Southern later fitted these units with the Dellner type coupler used on its Class 171s, reclassifying its two-car units as Class 171/7, replacing the standard BSI coupler fitted to Class 170s. This was done to allow them to couple to Class 377s in an emergency.

Southern later acquired 170392 from South West Trains, which became its tenth four-car, 171730. This unit had already carried Southern livery, being ordered as an add-on to a Southern order to save costs, and was delivered accordingly in Southern livery as 170727. It was renumbered and reliveried at Ashford Chart Leacon Works before entering traffic.

At the end of the First ScotRail franchise in March 2015, 170416 to 170424 were returned to Eversholt Rail Group. The first five units then remained on hire to Abellio ScotRail via a sublease arrangement until March 2020, while 170421 to 170424 moved to Wolverton Works in April 2015. They were overhauled and converted to Class 171s intended for Southern. Following issues with the conversion and reliability issues, the remaining units were then handed back to Eversholt Rail Group where they were then re-leased to East Midlands Railway. Two became two-car 171/2s and two four-car Class 171/4s. All four were returned to Eversholt in 2022 and leased to East Midlands Railway. Having been reformed back into their original three-carriage formations, the first three were transferred in September 2022. They will be converted back to Class 170s and resume their original identities, while the fourth will remain on sublease to Govia Thameslink Railway.

=== West Midlands Railway/London Midland ===

West Midlands Trains (WMT) operated two-car Class 170 Turbostars for services on the Birmingham to Hereford via Bromsgrove Line, and Birmingham - Shrewsbury via Telford Central services. Twenty-three (17 two-carriage 170/5s and six three-carriage 170/6s) were inherited from WMT&#x27;s predecessor London Midland in 2017. WMT replaced all of its 170s with 26 new Class 196 &quot;Civity&quot; units. The entire fleet moved to East Midlands Railway, with the first moving in February 2021. The centre coach of WMT&#x27;s six Class 170/6s moved to CrossCountry in 2021 to enable it to strengthen some of its two-car sets. The final four units joined EMR in May 2023.

=== Transport for Wales ===

In September 2019 Transport for Wales received three Class 170/2s (one three-car unit and two two-car units) from Greater Anglia, with driver training following. In November 2019, three more units (two three-car and one two-car) transferred depots from Norwich Crown Point to Cardiff Canton, with a further four three-car units delivered in December 2019, the last three-car unit delivered in January 2020 and the last two-car unit delivered in February 2020. This meant that Transport for Wales Rail leased the entire 12-strong 170/2 subclass of eight three-car units and four two-car units.

These were the first Class 170s on the Wales &amp; Borders franchise and they were used on services between Cardiff / Bridgend and Ebbw Vale, and services between Maesteg and Cheltenham/Gloucester. On 12 December 2019, three-car unit 170202 worked TfW Rail&#x27;s first Class 170 passenger services (between Bridgend and Ebbw Vale Town via Cardiff Central) and the units started to enter service in multiple quantities on 16 December 2019 with 5 units (three three-car and two two-car) running in passenger service on that day. All units had entered service by April 2020 when three-car unit 170206 was the last to enter service.

These were originally due to stay with TfW for the duration of the franchise (albeit working different services once their brand new trains were in service), however following a revision of TfW&#x27;s long-term rolling stock strategy, it was later announced all were to transfer to East Midlands Railway. The two-car units transferred first, followed by the three-car units. 170208 was the last to leave on 29 January 2024.

==Fleet details==

<text>The Conference Center, in Salt Lake City, Utah, is the premier meeting hall for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Completed in 2000, the 21,000-seat Conference Center replaced the traditional use of the nearby Salt Lake Tabernacle, built in 1868, for the church&#x27;s biannual general conference and other major gatherings, devotionals, and events.

== Features ==

The Conference Center seats 21,200 people in its main auditorium. This includes the rostrum behind the pulpit facing the audience, which provides seating at general conference for general authorities and general officers of the church and the 360-voice Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square. The auditorium is large enough to hold a Boeing 747 in the space between the seats and the rear of the stage. All seats in the audience have an unobstructed view of the pulpit because the roof is held up by radial trusses. The balcony is supported by a series of 34 cantilevers. This construction method allows the balcony to sink under full capacity. Behind the podium is a 7,708-pipe and 130-rank Schoenstein pipe organ. Underground is a parking garage that can hold 1,400 cars. A modernist, three-story chandelier hangs in a skylight in the interior of the building. A waterfall descends from the spire. City Creek flows in a rough-hewn riverbed, complementing the Conference Center.

On the third floor of the Conference Center there are busts of current and past church presidents and photographs of church leaders; photographs of female church leaders were added in 2014.

Because the building sits near the base of Salt Lake City&#x27;s Capitol Hill, the roof is landscaped for attractiveness, an extension of the Gardens at Temple Square. About of grass and hundreds of trees have been planted on the roof. Twenty-one native grasses were employed to conserve water and showcase local foliage. The rooftop garden includes a central garden of rectangular planters of aspen and conifers with long runnels and basins of water. The landscaping is meant to echo the mountains and meadows of Utah.

=== Conference Center Theater ===

Attached to the main building on the northwest corner is the 900-seat Conference Center Theater that can be used as a dedicated theater or as an overflow room.

== Planning and construction ==
Plans &quot;for construction at some indefinite date of a 30,000-seat auditorium of the block north of Temple Square&quot; were first announced at the October 1951 General Conference by church president David O. McKay as part of his worldwide building effort. The designs were solicited by church architect Leland A. Gray in the early 1990s, in conjunction with Gordon B. Hinckley who then became church president in 1995. The LDS Church originally sought a 26,000-seat building no more than high in accord with zoning regulations for the church-owned block immediately north of Temple Square. 

Hinckley publicly announced the project in the April 1996 general conference. The final plans, completed in late 1996, featured 21,200 seats in the main hall, with 905 in the side theater. The design of the Conference Center was accomplished by Portland, Oregon-based Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Partnership. Auerbach &amp; Associates of San Francisco was responsible for theater design and architectural lighting. 

Contracting for the building was done by Jacobsen, Layton, and Okland—three Salt Lake City construction firms. The three companies submitted a joint bid in order to compete with national firms. The companies jointly operated under the name &quot;Legacy Constructors&quot; after winning the contract in late 1996.

Demolition of existing LDS Church properties on the site began May 1997. Deseret Gym—a YMCA-like gymnasium—and the Mormon Handicraft store had to be razed for the project.

Ground was broken July 24, 1997. This date coincided with the 150th anniversary of Mormon pioneers entering the Salt Lake Valley, an event celebrated in Utah as Pioneer Day.

=== Little Cottonwood Canyon controversy ===

Although the Conference Center is a modern steel truss and rebar-based design without need for masonry support, the LDS Church sought slabs of quartz monzonite, a form of granite, to clad all exterior walls. Specifically, the church wanted granite to match rock quarried more than a hundred years earlier to build the adjacent Salt Lake Temple. Therefore, the church requested a permit to quarry granite from Little Cottonwood Canyon southeast of Salt Lake City. The Salt Lake County Commission granted a two-year permit on condition that extraction not interfere with the ski season. Critics of the extraction argued that the quarry harmed the environment and burdened residents while endangering drivers through Little Cottonwood Canyon below.

Quarrying began May 28, 1998. The quarry location was further up the canyon from where stone was extracted for the Salt Lake Temple. Although court filings challenged the legality of extracting the granite (specifically attacking Salt Lake County&#x27;s authority to issue permit), the project was interrupted only by winter weather. The church finished quarrying by November 1999. Over of granite was extracted. The granite was quarried by Idaho Travertine (now Yellowstone Rock) and subsequently cut into slabs at their Idaho Falls Facility for use as the facade of the building. There was not enough granite extracted from the Little Cottonwood Canyon quarry for the entire project, so extra granite was brought in from the mid-west and used for the flooring.
=== Completion ===
The Salt Lake City Tornado hindered construction on August 11, 1999. Construction cranes toppled at the work site, and four injuries to crew were reported. 

Construction was complete enough for the building to be used for the 170th annual general conference on April 1 and 2, 2000. The pipe organ was not yet operational, so the Mormon Tabernacle Choir was accompanied by an electric organ amplified through the center&#x27;s speaker system. Hinckley remarked in his opening address that over 370,000 people had inquired about tickets for the center&#x27;s inaugural general conference. He also related that a black walnut tree that he had planted decades earlier in his backyard provided wood for the pulpit of the new center.

The Conference Center was completed later in the year and formally dedicated on October 8, during the 170th semiannual general conference. As part of the event, the dedicatory prayer was followed by a &quot;hosanna shout&quot;—a show of gratitude that dates to the early days of the Latter Day Saint movement. The shout involves participants waving white handkerchiefs while repeating &quot;Hosanna, hosanna, hosanna, to God and the Lamb&quot; three times. Though it had been used in public before, such as during the capstone ceremony for the Salt Lake Temple and at the church centennial celebration in 1930, before this public broadcast of the hosanna shout, some assumed it was exclusively related to temple dedications, which are not accessible to non-Latter-day Saints. The Conference Center dedication demonstrated that the hosanna shout, although considered sacred by the Latter-day Saints, is not necessarily used exclusively in temple-related settings.

=== Schoenstein Organ at the Conference Center ===
This organ is internationally significant, both because of its role in accompanying choirs in conferences, and also in that it is one of only a few organs in the world that has registers of pipes extending down into the 64&#x27; series, the 64&#x27; Contra Trombone and 64&#x27; Contra Gamba, which both extend 4 pipes down to GGGGG#, 13 semitones below the lowest note on a standard piano. The tallest pipe used to produce this note is approximately 40 feet (5 stories) tall. This organ also has many other unique features, including full-compass manual 32&#x27; reed and flute registers, double expression, and many heroic voices on high pressure. High pressures are used throughout the organ due to the monumental amount of sound needed to project out into an auditorium of this size.

<doc id="1015425" wikidata="Q977912" url="?curid=1015425" title="Stolper–Samuelson theorem">
<text>The Stolper–Samuelson theorem is a theorem in Heckscher–Ohlin trade theory. It describes the relationship between relative prices of output and relative factor returns—specifically, real wages and real returns to capital.

The theorem states that—under specific economic assumptions (constant returns to scale, perfect competition, equality of the number of factors to the number of products)—a rise in the relative price of a good will lead to a rise in the real return to that factor which is used most intensively in the production of the good, and conversely, to a fall in the real return to the other factor.

==History==
It was derived in 1941 from within the framework of the Heckscher–Ohlin model by Wolfgang Stolper and Paul Samuelson, but has subsequently been derived in less restricted models. As a term, it is applied to all cases where the effect is seen. Ronald W. Jones and José Scheinkman show that under very general conditions the factor returns change with output prices as predicted by the theorem. If considering the change in real returns under increased international trade a robust finding of the theorem is that returns to the scarce factor will go down, ceteris paribus. An additional robust corollary of the theorem is that a compensation to the scarce factor exists which will overcome this effect and make increased trade Pareto optimal.
The original Heckscher–Ohlin model was a two-factor model with a labor market specified by a single number. Therefore, the early versions of the theorem could make no predictions about the effect on the unskilled labor force in a high-income country under trade liberalization. However, more sophisticated models with multiple classes of worker productivity have been shown to produce the Stolper–Samuelson effect within each class of labor: Unskilled workers producing traded goods in a high-skill country will be worse off as international trade increases, because, relative to the world market in the good they produce, an unskilled first world production-line worker is a less abundant factor of production than capital.

The Stolper–Samuelson theorem is closely linked to the factor price equalization theorem, which states that, regardless of international factor mobility, factor prices will tend to equalize across countries that do not differ in technology.

==Derivation==
Considering a two-good economy that produces only wheat and cloth, with labor and land being the only factors of production, wheat a land-intensive industry and cloth a labor-intensive one, and assuming that the price of each product equals its marginal cost, the theorem can be derived.

The price of cloth should be:

: (1) formula_1

with &quot;P&quot;(&quot;C&quot;) standing for the price of cloth, &quot;r&quot; standing for rent paid to landowners, &quot;w&quot; for wage levels and &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; respectively standing for the amount of land and labor used, and do not change with the prices of goods.

Similarly, the price of wheat would be:

: (2) formula_2

with &quot;P&quot;(&quot;W&quot;) standing for the price of wheat, &quot;r&quot; and &quot;w&quot; for rent and wages, and &quot;c&quot; and &quot;d&quot; for the respective amount of land and labor used, and also considered to be constant.

If, then, cloth experiences a rise in its price, at least one of its factors must also become more expensive, for equation 1 to hold true, since the relative amounts of labor and land are not affected by changing prices. It can be assumed that it would be labor—the factor that is intensively used in the production of cloth—that would rise.

When wages rise, rent must fall, in order for equation 2 to hold true. But a fall in rent also affects equation 1. For it to still hold true, then, the rise in wages must be more than proportional to the rise in cloth prices.

A rise in the price of a product, then, will more than proportionally raise the return to the most intensively used factor, and decrease the return to the less intensively used factor.

==Criticism==
The validity of the Heckscher–Ohlin model has been questioned since the classical Leontief paradox. Indeed, Feenstra called the Heckscher–Ohlin model &quot;hopelessly inadequate as an explanation for historical and modern trade patterns&quot;. As for the Stolper–Samuelson theorem itself, Davis and Mishra recently stated, &quot;It is time to declare Stolper–Samuelson dead&quot;. They argue that the Stolper–Samuelson theorem is &quot;dead&quot; because following trade liberalization in some developing countries (particularly in Latin America), wage inequality rose, and, under the assumption that these countries are labor-abundant, the SS theorem predicts that wage inequality should have fallen. Aside from the declining trend in wage inequality in Latin America that has followed trade liberalization in the longer run (see Lopez-Calva and Lustig), an alternative view would be to recognize that technically the SS theorem predicts a relationship between output prices and relative wages.

Papers that compare output prices with changes in relative wages find moderate-to-strong support for the Stolper–Samuelson theorem for Chile, Mexico, and Brazil.

<text>A&amp;W Cream Soda is a cream soda carbonated soft drink introduced by A&amp;W Root Beer in 1986.

A&amp;W Cream Soda and A&amp;W Diet Cream Soda were introduced in 1986. A&amp;W Cream Soda is currently the top brand in cream sodas.

In 2017, the product was reformulated to be caffeine free.

==Marketing==

In 1991, A&amp;W had its most popular cream soda campaign. They produced a summer advertisement with Snoopy and Woodstock displayed on the entire can. Snoopy and Woodstock are characters from the Peanuts Gang comic strips written by Charles M. Schulz. Snoopy can be seen playing baseball, having a cookout, lifting weights, surfing, walking the beach, riding a bike, jumping hurdles, and listening to music. These cans were very popular among buyers. These images can be seen on regular A&amp;W cream soda as well as Diet A&amp;W cream soda cans.

Coca-Cola&#x27;s first polar bear print advertisement made its debut in France in 1922, and for the next 70 years, polar bears appeared sporadically in print advertising. A&amp;W, the leading root beer marketer, filmed their own commercial using polar bears in the summer of 1992. In that commercial, a real polar bear is seen in contrast to a mechanical polar bear that is ice-skating in a fancy skirt. The commercial used the polar bears to distinguish a difference between regular A&amp;W cream soda and sparkling A&amp;W cream soda. They use the real bear yawning to embody the regular cream soda, and they use the ice-skating polar bear to represent the sparkling cream soda. The polar bears are used as a marketing technique to appeal to a large audience. &quot;They are white, which is the color of innocence, even though in this case it&#x27;s 800 pounds of skin-ripping innocence,&quot; Mr. Gilbert said.

Also, in 1992 Pepsi-Cola International and A&amp;W Brands Inc. worked together over a signed agreement to increase the spread of A&amp;W&#x27;s bottled products in Asia. The company anticipated to sell $500 million of A &amp; W soft drinks in Asia within the span of ten years to make the company&#x27;s brands as prevalent as Pepsi, which was already distributed in Guam and Indonesia. In 1994, A&amp;W put $7 million into their marketing promotions. They partnered with the show &quot;Baywatch&quot; to produce greater sales for their product. Baywatch was ranked second among all of the popular TV shows, so they knew this was a great opportunity. In-show placement on four episodes of &quot;Baywatch&quot; appeared. The advertisement was shown as sponsors of a boogie board test during the episode. The winner of the boogie board contest on the television show would receive a year&#x27;s supply of A&amp;W.

A&amp;W cream soda also spent $1.5 million in ads commemorating &quot;a little sparkle in a vanilla world.&quot; A new A&amp;W campaign from New York, which featured regular people, kids to grandparents, all describing their satisfaction of A&amp;W. The campaign took a different direction from A&amp;W&#x27;s common and past humorous ads, using sepia-toned images. Their new tag-line introduced: “authentic.” 

In addition to making A&amp;W well known in different countries, using Snoopy, making new marketing campaigns with polar bears, and using the show &quot;Baywatch&quot;, A&amp;W cream soda has had a few commercials. Joe Isuzu appeared in cream soda commercials as well as William Sanderson and the Sumangala Band.

<text>Walter George Pitman (May 18, 1929 – June 12, 2018) was an educator and politician in Ontario, Canada.

==Background==
Born in Toronto, Ontario, he received a Bachelor of Arts in 1952 and a Master of Arts in 1954 from the University of Toronto. He died in 2018 at the age of 89.

==Politics==
His victory in a federal by-election held in Peterborough, Ontario on October 31, 1960, as a candidate for the New Party was a significant catalyst in the movement to refound the social democratic Cooperative Commonwealth Federation as the &quot;New Democratic Party&quot; (NDP).

Pitman was a high school teacher when he was nominated by Peterborough&#x27;s New Party Club to be their candidate in a 1960 by-election. The by-election was called at a time when the CCF, which had been almost wiped out in the 1958 federal election, was in the process of creating, with the Canadian Labour Congress, a new social democratic political party. The call for a yet unnamed &quot;new party&quot; led to the creation of New Party Clubs across the country. The by-election in Peterborough became a test for the arguments of New Party advocates that a political party with the support of organized labour would lead to breakthroughs for the left in Canada.

The CCF had never won an election in Peterborough. As a New Party candidate, however, Pitman won over 13,000 votes, beating his nearest opponent by nearly 3,000 votes. Pitman not only won a seat in the House of Commons of Canada but his electoral performance dwarfed the 1,800 votes the CCF had received in the riding in the 1957 and 1958 elections.

Pitman&#x27;s victory energized the New Party movement, and, in 1961, the CCF and CLC formed a new political entity, the New Democratic Party.

Despite Pitman&#x27;s new found political celebrity he narrowly lost his seat in the 1962 election by 564 votes. He was defeated again in the 1963 election by 804 votes.

In the 1967 Ontario provincial election, Pitman won the Peterborough seat for the Ontario New Democratic Party. As a Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP), Pitman unsuccessfully ran to replace Donald C. MacDonald as leader of the provincial NDP. He came in second to Stephen Lewis at the 1970 Ontario NDP leadership convention. He lost his seat in the 1971 provincial election.

==Later life==
Following his electoral defeat, Pitman returned to education as director of the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, and later president of Ryerson Polytechnical Institute in Toronto. Between his federal and provincial political careers, he was dean of arts and science at Trent University. Robert Gardner wrote of Pitman&#x27;s leadership years at Ryerson University, &quot;He was universally admired by his colleagues. His approach to education and administration was humane, inclusive, and generous. Many of us who worked closely with him attempted to emulate his remarkable example. That was his most enduring legacy.&quot;

Pitman is also a former president of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association.

In 1992, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. He was also awarded the Order of Ontario.

<doc id="1015437" wikidata="Q382338" url="?curid=1015437" title="Ueno Zoo Monorail">
<text>The was a long suspended railway operated by the Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation (Toei). It lies within the Ueno Zoo in Taitō, Tokyo, Japan. The monorail is similar to the Wuppertal Schwebebahn, but has rubber tires rather than steel wheels. Many of the parts manufactured for the monorail were off-the-shelf. The first monorail in the nation (and the first zoo monorail in the world), it had two stations, single track, and operated at 600 V DC. The line began operating on December 17, 1957, was suspended during 2001–2002, and has been suspended since October 31, 2019, with the operator citing the high costs of replacing the aging trains. It was officially closed on December 27, 2023. Being located inside the zoo, it only operated on days when the zoo was open, and between 9:40 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., with departures scheduled every seven minutes. The fare for the 90-second trip was 150 yen. 

==History==
The number of cars in Japan rose since the end of World War 2, which caused heavy traffic congestions around Tokyo. Trams and bus routes operated by Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation suffered from delays and loss of passengers caused by traffic congestions. The subway network in Tokyo was in construction from pre-war, and the Bureau of Transportation was also building their own subway line in 1958, but subways were expensive to build. Monorails were considered as the alternative to other transportation methods such as buses and subways, and Ueno Zoo was selected as the site for the monorail line. Monorails were in development at the time, and the Bureau of Transportation worked with Toshiba and Nippon Sharyo to develop a new method. The method was similar to the Wuppertal Schwebebahn, although it used rubber tires instead. This monorail was called &quot;Ueno-style.&quot;

Permit to operate the line was given on 22 June 1957 by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, and the line opened on December 27 of that year. However, the Bureau of Transportation planned to close the line in 1980 due to financial difficulties and aging of equipments. This plan was stopped in 1983 after a safety check due to requests for the line to be kept in operation.

On January 23, 2019, the Bureau of Transportation announced that the line will be suspended due to aging of the rolling stocks introduced in 2001. The line was suspended on November of that year. The Bureau of Transportation was initially willing to maintain the line, but decided to permanently close the line in 2023.

<doc id="1015441" wikidata="Q2618102" url="?curid=1015441" title="Angels Revenge">
<text>Angels Revenge, or Angels Brigade, is a 1979 American action comedy film. It was directed by Greydon Clark and distributed by Arista Films. It is also known as Angels&#x27; Brigade and Seven from Heaven.

The film has major roles for Peter Lawford and Jack Palance as the leaders of a drug cartel, and gives minor roles to character actors Jim Backus, Alan Hale, Jr., Pat Buttram and Arthur Godfrey (playing himself). Of the actresses who played the film&#x27;s seven female protagonists, however, the closest any had previously come to any degree of fame was Susan Kiger, who had been the &quot;Playboy&quot; Playmate of the Month for January 1977. Kiger played singer Michelle Wilson; her co-stars were Sylvia Anderson as stuntwoman Terry Grant, Lieu Chinh as martial arts instructor Keiko Umaro, Jacqueline Cole as high-school teacher April, Noela Velasco as model Maria, and Robin Greer as policewoman Elaine Brenner. Her younger sister Liza Greer plays high-school student Trish, who invites herself into the team. Jack Palance played chief antagonist Mike Farrell, assistant to Lawford&#x27;s kingpin character.

The film&#x27;s plot focuses on seven female vigilantes who decide to undermine the operation of a drug cartel. The &quot;revenge&quot; mentioned in the title reflects that one of the vigilantes is primarily motivated by her desire to avenge her hospitalized brother, a drug user.

==Plot==
The film focuses on seven women who decide to fight the local drug cartel after the brother of Michelle Wilson, a Las Vegas pop singer, is found severely beaten. When taken to the hospital, the young man is discovered to have been using illegal drugs. The singer meets with April, her brother&#x27;s teacher, and the two hatch a plan to destroy the local drug processing plant.

They recruit four more women with special skills and connections to help them achieve their audacious goal. As they plan their first strike, they discover high-schooler Trish spying on them. The student is relegated to phone duty but eventually worms her way into their escapades. The &quot;Angels&quot; not only destroy the processing plant but also manage to intercept one of the shipments. As a result, the women attract unwelcome attention from the local drug cartel.

==Critical response==
The film was poorly received by both critics and the general public, being seen as a cheap knockoff of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. The plot was seen as contrived. It also had a number of actors, primarily Lawford and Palance, whose popularity had fallen since the 1960s.

===&quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;===
Because of the poor response, the film faded into obscurity until 1995 when it was featured on the movie-mocking television series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;. It was edited to fit their timeslot; for example, Miller (Neville Brand) is listed in the opening credits, but only mentioned towards the end, never actually appearing on screen.

The episode featuring the film was the final episode broadcast on Comedy Central, when it aired as a rerun on December 30, 1996.

===RiffTrax===
In 2017, former &quot;MST3K&quot; writers and cast members Bridget Nelson and Mary Jo Pehl riffed the uncut film as a video-on-demand for RiffTrax.

<doc id="1015448" wikidata="Q4744641" url="?curid=1015448" title="American Overseas School of Rome">
<text>The American Overseas School of Rome&quot; (AOSR&quot;&#x27;) is a private international school in Rome, Italy, accredited by the United States–based Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. It has three divisions: Elementary School, Middle School and High School. It primarily caters to the international community in Rome, Italy. Students graduating receive the American high-school diploma or the International Baccalaureate. It has been an IB World School since April 1989. The Head of the School is Dr. Kristen DiMatteo along with Mr. Jerome Duggan as the secondary school principal and Ms. Joanne Mallary as the elementary school principal.

==History==

For the first half of its existence, the school was called the Overseas School of Rome. There was an OSR located at the Foro Mussolini (now the Foro Italico), near Ponte Milvio before 1947, but not the same school that was incorporated in that year. When news came that the Allied Forces were being moved to Trieste, five American and five British mothers (some from the original Foro Mussolini school) got together and decided to form a school which should be nondenominational and international, combining the best of the British and American systems. This group is responsible for the organization of the official corporation that became known as the American Overseas School of Rome.

The parents managed to get the British and American Ambassadors, as patrons of the school, to put pressure on the Torlonia family to rent the palazzo of Villa Torlonia on Via Nomentana as AOSR&#x27;s first campus. The school opened its doors to the public on October 16, 1947, with 60 students.

In 1952, the school moved to its current location on Via Cassia. Enrollment continued to rise steadily, reflecting the increased numbers of parents assigned to embassies, consulates, and the United Nations, or living in Rome as scholars, artists, journalists, and business professionals. The Board of Trustees built a new high school building in 1956, and in 1958 an auditorium and cafeteria were completed to replace the temporary structure that had been built.

That same year, the United States government gave a grant to the school. A new elementary school was constructed, additional high school classrooms were completed, and the gymnasium was installed.

In 1965, the elementary school extension was completed, as well as leveling of the field, and the school took on its present-day appearance. The Hillside Theater was added in the early 1970s. While enrollment peaked at over 800 students in the late 1960s and early 1970s, in recent years it has stabilized at around 600 students. The change to the current name of the American Overseas School of Rome was adopted in the late 1970s.

In June 2007, AOSR celebrated its 60th anniversary on the banks of the Tiber River.

==Curriculum==

The curriculum is that of U.S. general academic and international, college-preparatory public or private schools. The School has a strong Advanced Placement Program and also prepares students for the International Baccalaureate examinations. The School&#x27;s testing program includes the College Board&#x27;s PSAT, SAT/ACT, and Advanced Placement tests, as well as the full complement of IB tests. The instruction is in English. French, Spanish, and Italian are taught as foreign languages. There is no religious instruction. The School is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools and is the first school to be granted an International Credential from the Middle States Association.

==Elementary school==

The curriculum of the Elementary School follows the Reggio Emilia approach. Specialists teach art, physical education, music, theater, computer, English as a Second Language, reading, and Italian. Italian students are prepared for the Quinta elementary examination as long as it is required by the Italian Ministry of Education.

==Middle school==

AOSR Middle School focuses on the core subjects of language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies and enables students to develop skills for lifelong learning. A strong foreign language program requires students to study Italian and allows them to select French, as well. Italian students are prepared for the prima, seconda, and Terza media exams as long as they are required by the Italian Ministry of Education. All students are exposed to a variety of enrichment courses such as drama, art, computer, and music. Physical education is also an integral part of the curriculum. Student government, cultural trips, and after-school activities supplement academics in middle school.

==High school==

The High School is a college preparatory day offering one-year and semester courses. An 18-subject Advanced Placement Program and the International Baccalaureate Program are available, as well as a post-graduate (13th) year. Over the years, virtually all of the school&#x27;s graduates have attended universities in the United States, England, Canada, Italy, France, and throughout the world.

==Athletics==

AOSR offers a wide range of sports, including Football (Soccer), Basketball, Volleyball, Cross-country running, Tennis, Cheerleading, and Wrestling. Athletics function as an integral part of the total curriculum and life at AOSR. The school plays in the American Schools Italy League (ASIL). The ASIL is part of the DoDEA run by the US Department of Defense. The program has 4 divisions with the larger schools being in divisions 1 and 2 and the smaller ones in 3 and 4. AOSR is in division 2. Each sports season consists of a few months of competition and culminates at the European championships, usually held in Germany. Mr. Daniel Zacaroli is the Athletic Director and he oversees the school&#x27;s athletic membership in the Dodds Mediterranean league besides inspiring young athletes to engage in sports. The American Overseas School of Rome athletic teams are known as the &quot;Falcons.&quot; The school&#x27;s cross-town rivals are primarily Marymount International School of Rome and St. Stephen&#x27;s International School.

==Nationalities==

The American Overseas School of Rome is home to an international student body of around 600 students with approximately one-third from the United States, one-third from Italy, and the remaining third from 50 different countries.

==Organization==

The School is governed by a 12-member Board of Trustees, who are elected by the parents or guardians of children enrolled in the School. The School is recognized as a non-profit institution under Italian law and is incorporated in the State of Delaware as tax-exempt under Section 501(c) (3) of the US Internal Revenue Code.

==Associations and memberships==

The American Overseas School of Rome is a member of RISA (Rome International Schools Association), CIS (Council of International Schools) and ECIS.

The American University of Rome and American Overseas School of Rome (AOSR) signed a cooperation agreement on February 7, 2008. The schools work together to seek outside funding for school projects and share facilities, special programs, and opportunities for faculty development.

<text>Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is one among numerous growth factors that regulate cell growth and division. In particular, PDGF plays a significant role in blood vessel formation, the growth of blood vessels from already-existing blood vessel tissue, mitogenesis, i.e. proliferation, of mesenchymal cells such as fibroblasts, osteoblasts, tenocytes, vascular smooth muscle cells and mesenchymal stem cells as well as chemotaxis, the directed migration, of mesenchymal cells. Platelet-derived growth factor is a dimeric glycoprotein that can be composed of two A subunits (PDGF-AA), two B subunits (PDGF-BB), or one of each (PDGF-AB).

PDGF is a potent mitogen for cells of mesenchymal origin, including fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells and glial cells. In both mouse and human, the PDGF signalling network consists of five ligands, PDGF-AA through -DD (including -AB), and two receptors, PDGFRalpha and PDGFRbeta. All PDGFs function as secreted, disulphide-linked homodimers, but only PDGFA and B can form functional heterodimers.

Though PDGF is synthesized, stored (in the alpha granules of platelets), and released by platelets upon activation, it is also produced by other cells including smooth muscle cells, activated macrophages, and endothelial cells

Recombinant PDGF is used in medicine to help heal chronic ulcers, to heal ocular surface diseases and in orthopedic surgery and periodontics as an alternative to bone autograft to stimulate bone regeneration and repair.

== Types and classification ==

There are five different isoforms of PDGF that activate cellular response through two different receptors. Known ligands include: PDGF-AA (&quot;PDGFA&quot;), -BB (&quot;PDGFB&quot;), -CC (&quot;PDGFC&quot;), and -DD (&quot;PDGFD&quot;), and -AB (a &quot;PDGFA&quot; and &quot;PDGFB&quot; heterodimer&quot;)&quot;. The ligands interact with the two tyrosine kinase receptor monomers, PDGFRα (&quot;PDGFRA&quot;) and -Rβ (&quot;PDGFRB&quot;). The PDGF family also includes a few other members of the family, including the VEGF sub-family.

== Mechanisms ==

The receptor for PDGF, PDGFR is classified as a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), a type of cell surface receptor. Two types of PDGFRs have been identified: alpha-type and beta-type PDGFRs. The alpha type binds to PDGF-AA, PDGF-BB and PDGF-AB, whereas the beta type PDGFR binds with high affinity to PDGF-BB and PDGF-AB.
PDGF binds to the PDGFR ligand binding pocket located within the second and third immunoglobulin domains. Upon activation by PDGF, these receptors dimerise, and are &quot;switched on&quot; by auto-phosphorylation of several sites on their cytosolic domains, which serve to mediate binding of cofactors and subsequently activate signal transduction, for example, through the PI3K pathway or through reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated activation of the STAT3 pathway. Downstream effects of this include regulation of gene expression and the cell cycle.
The role of PI3K has been investigated by several laboratories. Accumulating data suggests that, while this molecule is, in general, part of growth signaling complex, it plays a more profound role in controlling cell migration.
The different ligand isoforms have variable affinities for the receptor isoforms, and the receptor isoforms may variably form hetero- or homo- dimers. This leads to specificity of downstream signaling. It has been shown that the sis oncogene is derived from the PDGF B-chain gene. PDGF-BB is the highest-affinity ligand for the PDGFR-beta; PDGFR-beta is a key marker of hepatic stellate cell activation in the process of fibrogenesis.

== Function ==
PDGFs are mitogenic during early developmental stages, driving the proliferation of undifferentiated mesenchyme and some progenitor populations. During later maturation stages, PDGF signalling has been implicated in tissue remodelling and cellular differentiation, and in inductive events involved in patterning and morphogenesis. In addition to driving mesenchymal proliferation, PDGFs have been shown to direct the migration, differentiation and function of a variety of specialised mesenchymal and migratory cell types, both during development and in the adult animal. Other growth factors in this family include vascular endothelial growth factors B and C (VEGF-B, VEGF-C) which are active in angiogenesis and endothelial cell growth, and placenta growth factor (PlGF) which is also active in angiogenesis.

PDGF plays a role in embryonic development, cell proliferation, cell migration, and angiogenesis. Over-expression of PDGF has been linked to several diseases such as atherosclerosis, fibrotic disorders and malignancies. Synthesis occurs due to external stimuli such as thrombin, low oxygen tension, or other cytokines and growth factors.

PDGF is a required element in cellular division for fibroblasts, a type of connective tissue cell that is especially prevalent in wound healing. In essence, the PDGFs allow a cell to skip the G1 checkpoints in order to divide. It has been shown that in monocytes-macrophages and fibroblasts, exogenously administered PDGF stimulates chemotaxis, proliferation, and gene expression and significantly augmented the influx of inflammatory cells and fibroblasts, accelerating extracellular matrix and collagen formation and thus reducing the time for the healing process to occur.

In terms of osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, comparing PDGF to epidermal growth factor (EGF), which is also implicated in stimulating cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation, MSCs were shown to have stronger osteogenic differentiation into bone-forming cells when stimulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) versus PDGF. However, comparing the signaling pathways between them reveals that the PI3K pathway is exclusively activated by PDGF, with EGF having no effect. Chemically inhibiting the PI3K pathway in PDGF-stimulated cells negates the differential effect between the two growth factors, and actually gives PDGF an edge in osteogenic differentiation. Wortmannin is a PI3K-specific inhibitor, and treatment of cells with Wortmannin in combination with PDGF resulted in enhanced osteoblast differentiation compared to just PDGF alone, as well as compared to EGF. These results indicate that the addition of Wortmannin can significantly increase the response of cells into an osteogenic lineage in the presence of PDGF, and thus might reduce the need for higher concentrations of PDGF or other growth factors, making PDGF a more viable growth factor for osteogenic differentiation than other, more expensive growth factors currently used in the field such as BMP2.

PDGF is also known to maintain proliferation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). It has also been shown that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) activates a signaling pathway that positively regulates the PDGF receptors in OPCs.

== History ==
PDGF was one of the first growth factors characterized, and has led to an understanding of the mechanism of many growth factor signaling pathways.The first engineered dominant negative protein was designed to inhibit PDGF 

==Medicine==
Recombinant PDGF is used to help heal chronic ulcers and in orthopedic surgery and periodontics to stimulate bone regeneration and repair. PDGF may be beneficial when used by itself or especially in combination with other growth factors to stimulate soft and hard tissue healing (Lynch et al. 1987, 1989, 1991, 1995).

== Research ==

Like many other growth factors that have been linked to disease, PDGF and its receptors have provided a market for receptor antagonists to treat disease. Such antagonists include (but are not limited to) specific antibodies that target the molecule of interest, which act only in a neutralizing manner.

The &quot;c-Sis&quot; oncogene is derived from PDGF.

Age related downregulation of the PDGF receptor on islet beta cells has been demonstrated to prevent islet beta cell proliferation in both animal and human cells and its re-expression triggered beta cell proliferation and corrected glucose regulation via insulin secretion.

A non-viral PDGF &quot;bio patch&quot; can regenerate missing or damaged bone by delivering DNA in a nano-sized particle directly into cells via genes. Repairing bone fractures, fixing craniofacial defects and improving dental implants are among potential uses. The patch employs a collagen platform seeded with particles containing the genes needed for producing bone. In experiments, new bone fully covered skull wounds in test animals and stimulated growth in human bone marrow stromal cells.

The addition of PDGF at specific time‐points has been shown to stabilise vasculature in collagen‐glycosaminoglycan scaffolds.

<text>The settlement of Steveston, founded in the 1880s, is a neighbourhood of Richmond in Metro Vancouver. On the southwest tip of Lulu Island, the village is a historic port and salmon canning centre at the mouth of the South Arm of the Fraser River. The early 1900s style architecture attracts both the film and tourism industries.

==History==


===Pre-Colonization===
For thousands of years the area that is today known as Steveston was home to the Halkomelem speaking peoples. Specifically, the area is said to be home to at least two Musqueam villages. One known as qʷeyaʔχʷ was located East of what is today known as Garry Point Park. This community was forced out of their homes due to pressure from the canneries who would replace their homes with fishing camps. The second village, qʷɬeyəm, is believed to have been located North of Moncton Street near Railway Avenue. In Richmond, &quot;recently, city council voted to rebuild the historic First Nations Bunkhouse in Britannia Heritage Shipyards--believed to be the only structure of its kind remaining along B.C.&#x27;s coast.&quot;

===Pioneers===
The village is named for Manoah Steves, who arrived with his family around 1877–1878 from Moncton, New Brunswick, via Chatham, Ontario. Born Manoah Steeves, a second cousin of William Steeves, he dropped the second &#x27;e&#x27; en route. The family was the first white settlers in the area. The townsite began in 1880 as a crown grant to William Herbert Steves, his son. During the following decade, over 100 individuals purchased land in this original section comprising a grid pattern of 237 small lots. Becoming Steveston in 1889, this area south of today&#x27;s Steveston Highway and west of No. 1 Rd. was the first subdivision in Richmond. In 1887, London&#x27;s Landing, at the foot of No. 2 Rd., was also laid out on a grid. New Westminster-Vancouver Island ferries called at Steveston from the early 1860s onward, becoming a Steveston-Vancouver Island run in the 1920s.

===Early commerce===
Salmon canning began on the river in 1871 with the first major cannery being the Phoenix, established in 1882 by Marshall English and Samuel Martin. By the 1890s there were 45 canneries, about half of which were at Steveston, giving rise to the alternate name of Salmonopolis. Each summer large numbers of Japanese, Chinese, First Nations, and European fishermen and cannery workers descended upon the village, joining a growing year-round settlement. At the port, sailing ships loaded canned salmon for export. The fishery also supported a significant boatbuilding industry.

Steveston Fire Department existed 1912–1917. Otherwise, the closest firehall was Marpole, half an hour to an hour away, depending upon road conditions. A 1908 fire in the eastern section caused over $35,000 in damages. The 1918 inferno, totalling over $0.5m in damages, destroyed three canneries (the Star, Steveston, and Lighthouse), three hotels (Star, Richmond, and London), and most of Brick Block. The Marpole firetruck broke down on the way. This devastating fire started in a dining/recreational area of the Star Cannery. In 1897, this same cannery suffered the first significant fire in Steveston, requiring extensive rebuilding.

Steveston&#x27;s aspirations to rival Vancouver as a port ended during World War I. Salmon runs peaking in 1913 was one of many factors. Canning activity slowly declined and finally ceased in the 1990s. The Gulf of Georgia Cannery, built in 1894 was at one time the largest plant in British Columbia. The cannery (1994) and Britannia Shipyard (1991) received National Historic Site designations.

The BCER Vancouver-Marpole-Steveston interurban tram operated 1905–1958. A new building houses the static tram car 1220.

Once a pioneer bank building, the Steveston Museum &amp; Visitor Centre also operates a post office.

===Steveston&#x27;s Japanese Canadians===
Japanese Canadians formed a large part of Steveston&#x27;s original population. Tomekichi Homma, who settled in Steveston in 1883, was one of the important early members of the Japanese community in the village. Homma Elementary School in Steveston was named in his honour. Around 1897, the Fraser River Japanese Fishermen’s Association Hospital in Steveston was established since the local hospital refused to admit and treat Japanese immigrant patients.

The Japanese Canadian internment during World War II was a serious blow to the community, although some of the internees returned when they were allowed and a sizable Japanese Canadian community still exists. For example, a Japanese judo and martial arts centre was developed in Steveston after the internment.

During World War II, the Department of Transport facility monitored German and Japanese (Kana code) submarine traffic. The facility closed in 1945.

In 1954, BC Packers manager Ken Fraser donated a lot to Steveston&#x27;s Japanese Canadian fishermen for the purposes of building a joint community centre (which eventually became the Steveston Community Centre); the terms of the agreement also stated that the Japanese Fishermen Benevolent Association be allowed to have a judo room at the centre.

In 1969, community discussion led to the development of a Japanese-style martial arts building for Steveston. The martial arts centre, now a Steveston landmark, is currently located adjacent to the Steveston Community Centre.

===Post-war development===
Along with Richmond, Steveston transformed from farmland to residential housing. Since the 1970s, the community, which remains an active fishing port, has enhanced its heritage character and waterfront to attract business and tourism.

Garry Point, at the southwest tip of the community (and Lulu Island), was named in 1827 to honour Nicholas Garry, former Deputy Governor of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. The company ships used this promontory as a navigational aid to safely enter the Fraser River. From the 1960s to the early 1990s, it was a federally-owned dump site for sand dredged from the river. Levelling the dunes created Steveston&#x27;s largest park, opened in 1989. The site of the Steveston Fisherman&#x27;s Memorial, the park was the major host location for the Vancouver-area festivities of the 2002 Tall Ships Challenge. Approximately 400,000 people came to see a fleet of restored sailing ships docked along the river. The financial loss incurred by the event prompted strong criticism from Richmond City Council. A maritime festival continues to be held annually.

In 1990, the Steveston Harbour Authority was established. In 1998, the 44-acre BC Packers cannery site was rezoned residential in exchange for keeping the waterfront portion publicly accessible. Years of controversy followed regarding the zoning of the foreshore buildings.

==Filming location==
Steveston is a popular location for filming both movies and television shows, which has included the following:

==Tourism==
Even with extensive redevelopment, Steveston maintains the character of a quaint, historic fishing village, with over 600 fishing boats––Canada&#x27;s largest fleet calling Steveston Harbour home. It boasts over 350 businesses and services to accommodate a growing population. On sunny days, locals and visitors crowd the waterfront boardwalks to enjoy the scenery, people and food.

Steveston is also known as &quot;The Gateway to the Orca,&quot; being a base for the whale watching industry. Shuttled by boat into the Gulf of Georgia, passengers observe orca (killer whales), seals, eagles and more.

==Steveston Salmon Festival==
On Canada Day, the community hosts the Steveston Salmon Festival, which has been held annually since 1946. This event includes a parade, and a huge barbecued salmon sale beside the Steveston Community Centre. Municipal, provincial and federal politicians often attend, usually as part of the parade and/or to hand out Canadian flags.

==Seafair==

Seafair is a neighbourhood and planning area in the city of Richmond, British Columbia. It is located directly north of Steveston, stretching from Williams Road to Blundell Road west of Railway Avenue. It is often loosely grouped in with Steveston due to loose definition of the neighbourhood&#x27;s borders. Its commercial centre is Seafair Plaza, which neighbours St. Anne&#x27;s Steveston Church.

<text>George Washington McCrary (August 29, 1835 – June 23, 1890) was a United States representative from Iowa, the 33rd United States Secretary of War and a United States circuit judge of the United States Circuit Courts for the Eighth Circuit.

==Education and career==

Born on August 29, 1835, near Evansville, Vanderburg County, Indiana, McCrary moved with his parents in 1836 to the Wisconsin Territory (Iowa Territory from July 4, 1838, State of Iowa from December 28, 1846) who settled in Van Buren County. He attended the public schools, taught in the country schools at age 18, read law at the law firm of future United States Supreme Court Justice Samuel Freeman Miller and was admitted to the bar in 1856. He entered private practice in Keokuk, Iowa from 1856 to 1857. He was a member of the Iowa House of Representatives in 1857, resuming private practice in Keokuk from 1858 to 1861. He was a member of the Iowa Senate from 1861 to 1865, again resuming private practice in Keokuk from 1862 to 1869.

==Congressional service==

In 1868, McCrary successfully sought a U.S. House seat from Iowa&#x27;s 1st congressional district to succeed Radical Republican James F. Wilson. He was elected as a Republican from the district to the United States House of Representatives of the 41st United States Congress and to the three succeeding Congresses, serving from March 4, 1869, to March 3, 1877. He was Chairman of the Committee on Elections for the 42nd United States Congress and Chairman of the Committee on Railways and Canals for the 43rd United States Congress. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1876.

===Congressional activity===

In McCrary&#x27;s first month in Congress, he received national attention for refusing to support an appropriation for a federal courthouse in Keokuk because the nation was in debt and he could not support such a courthouse in every district. He published &quot;A Treatise on the American Law of Elections&quot;, in 1875. In the 44th United States Congress, as a member of the United States House Committee on the Judiciary, he was the author of a farsighted (but unsuccessful) bill to reorganize the federal courts to enable reasonable and prompt judicial review. He helped create the Electoral Commission to resolve the outcome of the 1876 Presidential Election, and served on the committee that investigated the Crédit Mobilier scandal.

Maintaining his passion for law, McCrary established an expertise in contested elections and laws pertaining to elections. He published &quot;A Treatise on the American Law of Elections&quot; in 1875, which later underwent four editions.

During his House years, McCrary allied with the congressional &quot;Half-Breeds,&quot; the loosely organized and more moderate wing of the Republican Party (in comparison to the pro-spoils system Stalwarts) which emphasized industrial interests and protective tariffs in addition to supporting civil service reform.

==Secretary of War==

McCrary was the 33rd United States Secretary of War in the cabinet of President Rutherford B. Hayes from March 12, 1877, to December 11, 1879, when he resigned. As Secretary, McCrary withdrew federal troops from the remaining reconstruction governments in South Carolina and Louisiana, and used federal troops in the 1877 railway strike and in Mexican border disturbances. The greatest military conflicts during his watch occurred in the American West, in battles with certain Native American tribes in Colorado, New Mexico, and elsewhere.

===Memberships===

McCrary was elected as a 3rd Class (honorary) member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS). This was probably due to President Hayes&#x27; influence as a prominent member of MOLLUS. (Hayes would later serve as MOLLUS commander-in-chief.)

==Federal judicial service==

McCrary was nominated by President Rutherford B. Hayes on December 1, 1879, to a seat on the United States Circuit Courts for the Eighth Circuit vacated by Judge John Forrest Dillon. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on December 9, 1879, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on March 18, 1884, due to his resignation, which he attributed to his family&#x27;s financial need after his many years of public service.

==Later career and death==

Following his resignation from the federal bench, McCrary resumed private practice in Kansas City, Missouri from 1884 to 1890. He served as general counsel for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad Company in Kansas City, Missouri from 1884 to 1890. He died on June 23, 1890, in St. Joseph, Missouri, after suffering from a stomach tumor. He was interred in Oakland Cemetery in Keokuk.

<doc id="1015474" wikidata="Q2975310" url="?curid=1015474" title="Clan MacNeil">
<text>Clan MacNeil, also known in Scotland as Clan Niall, is a highland Scottish clan of Irish origin. According to their early genealogies and some sources they&#x27;re descended from Eógan mac Néill and Niall of the Nine Hostages. The clan is particularly associated with the Outer Hebridean island of Barra. The early history of Clan MacNeil is obscure. However, despite this the clan claims to descend from the legendary Irish King Niall of the Nine Hostages, who is counted as the 1st Clan Chief, the current Clan Chief being the 47th. The clan itself takes its name from a &quot;Niall&quot; who lived in the 13th or early 14th century and who belonged to the same dynastic family of Cowal and Knapdale as the ancestors of the Lamonts, MacEwens of Otter, Maclachlans, and the MacSweens. While the clan is centred in Barra in the Outer Hebrides, there is a branch of the clan in Argyll (McNeill/MacNeill) that some historians have speculated was more senior in line, or possibly even unrelated. However, according to Scots law, the current chief of Clan MacNeil is the chief of all MacNeil(l)s.

==History==

===Origins===

====MacNeils of Barra====

Despite the long held belief that the McNeil (MacNeil, McNeill, MacNeill) are descended from the legendary Irish king/prince - recent DNA tests have shown that they are actually descended from Vikings with often no Irish blood at all.

=====Traditional origin=====
The MacNeils of Barra claim descent from a prince of the Uí Néill dynasty, Ánrothán Ua Néill, son of Áed, son of Flaithbertach Ua Néill, King of Ailech and Cenél nEógain, who died in 1036. Anrothan emigrated to Scotland in the 11th century. Through him the MacNeils of Barra also naturally claim descent from the legendary Niall of the Nine Hostages. Anrothan is claimed as ancestor of several clans in the Argyll vicinity: Clan Lamont, Clan Maclachlan, Clan MacEwen of Otter, and also the Irish Sweeneys (MacSween). If the MacNeils are indeed connected to Anrothan, then they appear to have been a junior branch of the family and were certainly overshadowed in the 13th century by the MacSweens, Lamonts and descendants of Gilchrist.

An opposing theory, proposed by Nicholas Maclean Bristol, is that there is reason to believe that they descend from Neill Maclean who appears on Exchequer Rolls at a time when Tarbert Castle was being rebuilt by Robert the Bruce. In 1252 Neil Macneil, fifth of Barra was described as a prince at a Council of the Lord of the Isles. His son was Neil Og Macneil who is believed to have fought for Robert the Bruce at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. An alternate hypothesis is a descent from a Bute family in service to the Clan MacRuari and granted Barra by them after the conquest of Bute by Scotland.

=====History=====

The earliest contemporary record of the Macneils of Barra is only in 1427, when Giolla Adhamhnáin Mac Néill (typically anglicised as &quot;Gilleonan Macneil&quot;) received a charter of Barra and Boisdale, from the Lord of the Isles, following the forfeiture of the previous Lordships of Uist and Garmoran, earlier that year.

Gilleonan&#x27;s namesake, reckoned the twelfth chief, was one of the island lords who were tricked into meeting James V of Scotland at Portree, where they were promised safe conduct but instead were arrested and imprisoned. The MacNeil chief of Barra was not released until the king&#x27;s death in 1542, when the Regent Moray wanted to use the island chiefs to counterbalance the growing power of the Clan Campbell. His son was amongst the chiefs who supported the last Lord of the Isles in his alliance with Henry VIII of England in 1545. The treaty they signed with the English as overlords proclaimed the ancient enmity between the chiefs of the isles and the kingdom of Scotland.

In 1579 the Bishop of the Isles made a complaint of molestation against the MacNeil chief of Barra. His son, the next chief, was denounced as a rebel by the Privy Council so many times that he was described as a &quot;hereditary outlaw&quot; and was known as &quot;the Turbulent&quot; or &quot;Ruari the Tatar&quot;. He has also been described as the last of the Viking raiders as he often raided from his Kisimul Castle. The king eventually arranged for his loyal vassals to &quot;extirpate and root out&quot; the chief of Clan MacNeil, whose own nephews captured him and placed him in chains.

During the Scottish Civil War of the 17th century the chief of Clan MacNeil, Neil Og, was appointed as Colonel of the Horse by Charles II of England and fought at the Battle of Worcester in 1651. His grandson was Roderick Dhu &quot;the Black&quot; who received a Crown charter for all of the lands of Barra to be erected into a free barony. Roderick also led his clan at the Battle of Killiecrankie in 1689. He also supported the Jacobite rising of 1715 and as a result his two sons, Roderick and James, went into exile in France. Upon their father&#x27;s death they returned but for his Jacobite sympathies, Roderick was consigned to a prison ship, the &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;. He was then taken to London and not released until July 1747.

The clan prospered until the twenty-first chief, General Roderick Macneil, was forced to sell Barra in 1838.

====McNeills of Argyll (in Taynish, Gigha and Colonsay)====

The origins of the Argyll MacNeills is also obscure. In the late 15th century, one MacNeill is recorded as the keeper of Castle Sween. In the mid 16th century, a certain Torquil MacNeill was known as the &quot;chief and principal of the clan and surname of Maknelis&quot;. The 19th century scholar W.F. Skene considered Torquil to be the last of the hereditary MacNeill keepers of the castle. Skene believed that after Torquil&#x27;s demise, the hereditary office passed to the MacMillans. During the time of Torquil, there are records of separate clans on Barra and Gigha. Skene did not consider Torquil to be a member of either of these clans, since both clans had chiefs of their own. A recent hypothesis make Torquil, son of Niall, living in 1440, the eponym of the clan, thus totally unrelated to the Barra MacNeils. His Norse name suggests his kindred were remnants of the lordship of Somerled, along with the Clan McCorquodale and Clan MacIver.

The chief of the Gigha MacNeills at this time was Neill MacNeill, who was killed in about 1530. His only daughter inherited his lands and handed them over to her illegitimate brother, Neill. According to historian John Bannerman, while the lands of the chief passed to his daughter, the chiefship passed over to Torquil who was her second cousin. Bannerman considered it likely that when Torquil died, the chiefship passed to the illegitimate Neill.

In 1553, this Neill sold the island to James MacDonald of Islay. Neill died without issue, and the next in line to the chiefship was another Neil, who obtained the lands of Taynish. His descendant Hector MacNeill of Taynish purchased Gigha in 1590. With the power of the Campbells growing and spreading out into the Inner Hebrides, the influence of the McNeills of Gigha decreased. At about this time the MacNeils on more remote island of Barra, far removed of Campbell power, began to grow in prominence and for a long time since have been regarded as &quot;Chief of the Clan and Name&quot;. Descending from this branch were the MacNeils of Colonsay who obtained Colonsay in 1700 and owned it until 1904 when it was sold by the heirs of Major General Sir John Carstairs McNeill. According to Moncreiffe, there is reason to believe that historically this branch was superior to the current chiefs of the Clan MacNeil. There is even a school of thought that there is no relation at all between this branch of McNeills to that of Barra. However, according to a 1962 decree by the Lord Lyon, the chiefs of MacNeil of Barra are chiefs of the whole name of MacNeil by Scots law until such time as the MacNeils of Colonsay acquire a Chief of their own. The last Clan Chief of the Clan McNeill of Colonsay was Alexander Malcolm McNeill who was born in New Zealand in 1899 and Matriculated his Arms in 1972. He held the title until his death in 1988. His son John Duncan McNeill became Head of the Clan on his father&#x27;s death but did not apply to matriculate his own Arms. Duncan&#x27;s eldest daughter, Deborah Jane McNeill, has petitioned the Lord Lyon to become the next Clan Chief of the Clan McNeill of Colonsay.


===Modern Clan Macneil===

The 18th and 19th centuries saw severe hardship to Clan MacNeil clansfolk. During this era there was mass clearance from Barra to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. During the chiefship of Colonel Roderick (c.1755–1822) Barra suffered its first mass clearances. Ironically the chief described himself as a &quot;melieuratier&quot; (an &quot;improver&quot;). One mass exodus of Barra folk was led by Gilleonan, elder son of the chief. This consisted of 370 Catholic Barra folk (about 75 families in total) who emigrated in August to Pictou, Nova Scotia. In 1838, after going broke, Colonel Roderick&#x27;s son and heir, Lieutenant General Roderick MacNeil of Barra, sold Barra to Colonel Gordon of Cluny. When Roderick died in 1863 the chiefship passed to a cousin (descendant of Gilleonan) who had emigrated during the mass emigrations to Canada in 1802.

Robert Lister MacNeil was born in 1889. An American citizen and a trained architect, he succeeded the chiefship of Clan MacNeil in 1915. In 1937 he was able to purchase Barra and the ruinous Kisimul Castle largely using the money from his second wife. Immediately he began work restoring the castle, aided in part by funds from a British Government grant. By his death in 1970 he had completed the restoration of the castle, ancient seat of the chiefs of the clan. In 2001 the castle was leased to Historic Scotland for one thousand years at the rent of £1 per year and a bottle of Talisker whisky. In October 2004 the chief handed over 3,600 hectares, comprising almost all of his estate on Barra to Scottish Ministers. The current chief of Clan MacNeil is Roderick Wilson MacNeil of Barra, The MacNeil of Barra, Chief of Clan Niall and 26th of Barra, also Baron of Barra. The chief is a member of the Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs. The current chief, while a United States citizen, lives in Edinburgh, Scotland.

Regarding the ascent of the 45th chief (Robert Lister Macneil), &quot;The Arms of the Scottish Bishoprics&quot; (1917) states:
&quot;In 1914 Roderick Ambrose MacNeil, Chief of the MacNeils of Barra, died in the United States of America, being still a British citizen, leaving two sons. Paul Humphrey MacNeil, the elder son, in his father&#x27;s lifetime renounced his allegiance to the British Crown and became an American citizen; in consequence of this his father in 1913 nominated his second son, Robert Lister MacNeil, the petitioner, to succeed him as Chief of the Clan, and assigned to him the arms pertaining to the Chief. Robert Lister MacNeil therefore petitioned the Lyon King to grant him the arms recorded by General Roderick MacNeil in 1824, which were borne by his (the petitioner&#x27;s father), Roderick Ambrose MacNeil.&quot;

==Clan Symbols==

===Crest Badges===

Clan members who wish to show their allegiance to a particular clan and chief can wear a crest badge. Scottish crest badges usually contain the heraldic crest and heraldic motto of the chief of the clan. While clan members may wear the badge, the crest and motto within it are the heraldic property of the chief alone. A crest badge suitable for a clan member of Clan MacNeil contains the crest: &quot;on a chapeau gules furred ermine, a rock proper&quot;. The motto upon the badge is: &quot;buaidh no bas&quot;, which translates from Scottish Gaelic as &quot;to conquer or die&quot;, or &quot;victory or death&quot;).

Though not a &quot;clan&quot; in its own right, MacNeil(l)s who consider themselves of the Colonsay &quot;branch&quot; have used the following crest badge to distinguish themselves from the Barra &quot;branch&quot;. This crest badge contains the crest: &quot;an armoured dexter arm with dagger&quot;; and the motto: &quot;vincere aut mori&quot; (also written as &quot;vincere vel mori&quot;), which translates from Latin as &quot;conquer or die&quot;.

===Clan Badge===

Another symbol used by clan members is a &quot;clan badge&quot;, or sometimes called a &quot;plant badge&quot;. The original clan badges were merely plants worn in bonnets or hung from a pole or spear. Today, the clan badge attributed to Clan MacNeil is dryas. Trefoil has also been attributed to the clan, however this clan badge may actually be attributed to the McNeills of Gigha, a branch of Clan MacNeil. Trefoil has also been attributed to the Lamonts, another clan in Argyl. The Lamonts and MacNeils/McNeills both claim descent from the same O&#x27;Neill who settled in Scotland in the Middle Ages.

===Tartan===

There have been several tartans associated with the name &quot;MacNeil&quot; / &quot;MacNeill&quot;. However, in 1997 the chief of Clan MacNeil directed members of the clan that there were only &quot;two&quot; tartans that he recognised as &quot;clan tartans&quot;. These were: &quot;MacNeil of Barra&quot; and &quot;MacNeil of Colonsay&quot;. The &quot;MacNeil of Barra&quot; tartan has been the standard MacNeil of Barra tartan for over a century.

==Coat of arms==
In Scotland, all coats of arms belong to a single person. The coat of arms typically attributed to Clan MacNeil belongs solely to the current chief of the clan. A depiction of the coat of arms is painted in the Great Hall of Kisimul Castle in Castlebay, Barra, Scotland.

This coat of arms is divided into quarters:
* Upper Left: Lion Rampant (mimicking the Royal Standard of the King of Scotland)
* Upper Right: Castle in the water (symbolizing Kisimul Castle in Castlebay)
* Lower Left: 3-masted ship (Representing either the seafaring nature of the clan or the migration of the clan from the Ulster, Ireland to Barra, Scotland
* Lower Right: Red Hand of Ulster surrounded by nine shackles representing Niall of the Nine Hostages

Surrounding the Coat of Arms :
* Crest: a Rock (same as on the clan badge)
* Chapeau: Red velvet cap lined with ermine, symbolic of a Baron
* Helm: Height of the Helmet is determined by rank
* Mantle: Fabric surrounding the Arms
* Supporters: Two lions rampant
* Compartment: The base of the Arms, made of Dryas flowers (the clan badge)

==Distribution==

The topic of who is a MacNeil can be a complicated one. By convention, anyone descended from a member of Clan MacNeil can claim membership. Because of the history of slavery in the United States and the Caribbean, however, many African-Americans may bear a MacNeil surname. Because it was not uncommon for a female slave to bear her slave-master&#x27;s child, several African-American MacNeils may have legitimate descent from a MacNeil, however such descent can rarely be proven, and most African-American MacNeils remain uninvolved with clan activities and do not claim descent from the clan. Generally speaking, Caucasians with MacNeil surnames number between 40,000 and 80,000 worldwide.

<text>Falu red or Falun red ( ; , ) is a red iron oxide pigment obtained as a byproduct of the Falun copper mine. It is traditionally used as a pigment in applied to exterior wood surfaces in Sweden, Finland, and Norway.

&quot;Falu Rödfärg&quot; is a protected trademark, which may only be used for products containing red pigment sourced from the Falun Mine. &quot;Rödfärg&quot; (Swedish), &quot;rödmylla&quot; (Finland Swedish) or &quot;punamulta&quot; (Finnish) can refer to any flour paint containing either natural red ochre or industrial iron oxide pigments. 

== History ==

After centuries of copper mining in Falun, large piles of residual materials were deposited above ground near the mines.

By the 16th century, mineralization of the mine&#x27;s tailings and slag, added by smelters, began to produce a red-coloured sludge rich in copper, limonite, silicic acid, and zinc. When this sludge was heated for several hours and mixed with linseed oil and rye flour, it was found to create an excellent anti-weathering paint. In the 17th century, Falu red began to be applied to wooden buildings to mimic the red-brick façades commonly used by the upper classes.

In Sweden&#x27;s urban areas, wooden buildings were often painted with Falu red until the early 19th century, when authorities started opposing its use.

=== Resurgence ===

Falu red saw a resurgence in popularity in the Swedish countryside during the 19th century, when poorer farmers and crofters began to paint their houses. Falu red is still widely used in the countryside. The Finnish expression &quot;&quot; (&#x27;a red cottage and a potato patch&#x27;), referring to idyllic home and life, is a direct allusion to a country house painted in Falu red.

== Composition of flour paint ==
The paint consists of water, rye flour, linseed oil, silicates, iron oxides, copper compounds, and zinc. As Falu red ages the binder deteriorates, leaving the color granules loose, but restoration is easy since simply brushing the surface is sufficient before repainting.

The actual color may be different depending on the degree to which the oxide is burnt, ranging from almost black to a bright, light red. Different tones of red have been popular at different times.

<text>Medical Investigation is an American medical drama television series that began September 9, 2004, on NBC. It ran for 20 one-hour episodes before its cancellation on March 25, 2005. The series was co-produced by Paramount Network Television and NBC Universal Television Studio.

The series featured the cases of an elite team of medical experts of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) who investigate unusual public health crises, such as sudden outbreaks of serious and mysterious diseases. In actuality, medical investigative duties in the United States are normally the responsibility of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local health departments, while the NIH is primarily a disease-research and -theory organization.

==Cast==
* Neal McDonough plays Dr. Stephen Connor; the leader of the team whose medical career has separated him from his family. Connor was previously a captain in the US Army, and fought in the Gulf War.
* Kelli Williams plays Dr. Natalie Durant; an expert in pathology and epidemiology, who often questions Connor, although serving as the team&#x27;s second-in-command.
* Christopher Gorham plays Dr. Miles McCabe; the newest and youngest member of the team; frequently tries to prove his worth.
* Anna Belknap plays Eva Rossi; the team&#x27;s media liaison who prevents the team&#x27;s investigations from causing public panic.
* Troy Winbush plays Frank Powell; a highly skilled medical investigator who has been friends with Connor for sometime. Previously served in the US Navy.

==Rebroadcasts==
The USA Network began running reruns on January 6, 2005, in what is called a &quot;repurposed&quot; broadcast. It is, however, no different from the original broadcasts. High definition reruns of the show are being broadcast on the Universal HD channel. In January 2007 the series began airing on NBC Universal&#x27;s mystery and crime-themed cable channel, Sleuth.

<text>The Second Battle of Sabine Pass (September 8, 1863) was a failed Union Army attempt to invade the Confederate state of Texas during the American Civil War. The Union Navy supported the effort and lost three gunboats during the battle, two captured and one destroyed.

It has often been credited as the war&#x27;s most one-sided Confederate victory. Confederate President Jefferson Davis wrote in 1876 that he &quot;considered the [second] battle of Sabine pass the most remarkable in military history.&quot;

==Background==
France was openly sympathetic to the Confederate States of America early in the Civil War, but never matched its sympathy with diplomatic or military action. After Mexican forces were defeated by French forces in summer 1863, Mexican president Benito Juárez escaped the capital, and the French installed Austrian Maximilian as &quot;Emperor&quot;. With a de facto French government bordering Texas on the south across the Rio Grande, the Confederates hoped to establish a formal route between Texas and Mexico by way of which the Confederacy could obtain much-needed supplies.

United States President Abraham Lincoln was well aware of Confederate intentions and sent an expedition to establish a military presence in Texas and to discourage Maximilian from opening trade with the Confederacy. The military Federal force was commanded by Major General Nathaniel P. Banks, a political general with little discernible command ability. Banks&#x27;s original intent was to launch a combined Army–Navy campaign in northwest Louisiana. The Union plan was to send Union Navy warships from the Mississippi up the tributary Red River, which was navigable upstream as far as where the boundaries of the Confederate states of Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas came together. The Union had effected its Capture of New Orleans on May 1, 1862, and after the July 3, 1863 surrender of Confederate Vicksburg, the Union military had better control of both the east and west banks and of the mouth of the Mississippi. Unusually low water in the Red River at this time, however, prevented even relatively low-draft Union gunboats from operating effectively, and the anticipated overland Union invasion of Texas was further delayed.

Consequently, General Banks ordered his subordinate Major General William B. Franklin to coordinate with the U.S. Navy, to enter the Sabine River from the Gulf of Mexico and defeat the small Confederate detachment at &quot;Fort Sabine&quot; on the river&#x27;s west bank (Texas side) at Sabine Pass. about 2 miles (3.2 km) upstream of the river mouth. The key U.S. Navy target in the First Battle of Sabine Pass was the original earthworks thrown up on the Texas bank of the Sabine River about three miles (4.8 km) south of Sabine City, a tiny town with some wharfs on the east side of its main street.

The U.S. Army battle plan was that after the U.S. Navy gunboats silenced the guns of Fort Sabine, the wave of about 200 U.S. Army infantrymen, riding the deck of one of the main fleet&#x27;s reserve gunboats, would debark immediately below (east) of the fort and effect the fort&#x27;s surrender. The main fleet, less than five miles offshore and well beyond Confederate gunfire, contained as many as 20 vessels, which carried U.S. Army regulars—as many as 5,000 men, according to Official records. A small artillery was included. The company-size initial landing force was to then take Sabine City and secure the area for the main force. After the main force was landed and united with the initial assault company the intention was to march the few miles north to the railroad and cut the railroad between Houston and Beaumont. Once done, the Army force would march east, presumably destroying the rail line as it went, and attack Beaumont. This action would deny Sabine Pass and the natural shallow-water harbor Sabine Lake upstream from the Gulf about 6 miles (9.6 km) to blockade runners.

Considering the dominant size of the Union expeditionary force, taking control of Sabine Pass and environs was not expected to be a great challenge to the U.S. forces. To prevent intervention from Confederate forces in Louisiana that consisted of Brigadier General Thomas Green&#x27;s First Cavalry Brigade and Brigadier General Alfred Mouton’s infantry division, the Union division of Major General Francis J. Herron moved to Morganza as a diversion, which precipitated the Battle of Stirling&#x27;s Plantation.

Fort Sabine had been renamed &quot;Fort Griffin&quot; in honor of an earlier commander, Confederate Lt. Colonel W. H. Griffin, although this was not shown on Union maps since the First Battle of Sabine Pass in late September 1862. The Confederate detachment residing at the Sabine Pass fort was the Jeff Davis Guards (named for Confederate president Jefferson Davis), a company of mostly Irish-American men from the Houston and Galveston area, recently had merged into the First Texas Heavy Artillery. They were stationed at the hastily built earthworks a mile (1.6 km) upstream (north) on the southwest bank of the Pass. When the battle began with the Union gunboats&#x27; bombardment on September 8, 1863, at the fort were forty-six men; all but two or three were members of the Davis Guards. Under the immediate command of Lieutenant Richard W. Dowling, the Davis Guards had mounted their unit&#x27;s six old smoothbore cannon on the elevated platform of the small earthen fort. Although unimpressive to Union observers and scouts, the fort&#x27;s gun positions were high enough to afford a clear view to the horizon for many miles: the flat marshlands stretched northeastward into Louisiana, westward toward Houston, southwestward toward Galveston, northward toward Port Arthur and Beaumont, and southeastward into the Gulf of Mexico. The nearest observation point affording a view of Fort Griffin, other than from the mast &quot;top&quot; of a naval vessel seaward of the Pass, was the Sabine Pass lighthouse on the Louisiana (opposite) side of Sabine Pass at the mouth of the Sabine River.

==Battle==

On the afternoon of September 8, 1863, U.S. Navy Lieutenant Frederick Crocker (&quot;Acting Captain&quot;) was in command of the advance squadron composed of four gunboats. Crocker was a veteran officer of considerable recent experience in Union river-gunboat actions and blockade duty. His ship was the , a steam-powered side-wheeler. Besides &quot;Clifton&quot;, Crocker&#x27;s advance squadron included &quot;Granite City&quot;, &quot;Sachem&quot;, and &quot;Arizona&quot;, all former merchant ships. Less than three miles southeast downriver, well out of range of the Confederate fort&#x27;s cannons, were anchored seven U.S. Navy transports carrying most of the U.S. Army soldiers of the landing force. The &quot;U.S.S. Suffolk&quot;, hosting invasion force commander U.S. Army Major General Franklin and his staff, headed the seven-vessel squadron. Outside the principal Gulf shore sand bar, an additional two miles (3.2 km) downstream of this squadron, lay at anchor the remaining ships of the 22-vessel invasion fleet. The cited contemporary U.S. Army map shows the nominal positions of the bombardment fleet of four, the seven ships of the transport squadron, and the relative position farther out in the Gulf of the remaining vessels. The official reports of the battle generally reflect the map&#x27;s information. The total number of Union infantry assault troops in the landing force is given as 5,000 infantrymen, which included 500 listed as aboard the &quot;Granite City&quot;, those aboard the six troop transports in the seven-ship squadron headed by &quot;Suffolk&quot;, plus an artillery company somewhere among them. The first wave of 500 men aboard &quot;Granite City&quot; which steamed as close behind &quot;Clifton&quot; as possible but out of range of the fort&#x27;s guns, were to land in the open space adjacent to and downstream of the fort. This was a flat, often muddy area already cleared of brush by the Confederate garrison as a clear field of fire for the canister and grape of the fort&#x27;s artillery. The U.S. Army&#x27;s invasion plan, therefore, absolutely required that the Confederate guns be silenced before any troops were debarked. This engagement was to be the largest amphibious assault on enemy territory in the history of the U.S. military up to that date.

Leon Smith, who was at Beaumont, Texas, immediately ordered all Confederate troops in Beaumont, some eighty men, aboard the steamer &quot;Roebuck&quot; and sent them down the river to reinforce Fort Griffin. Smith and a Captain Good rode to the fort on horseback, reaching the fort some three hours before the steamer, arriving just as the Union gunboats and &quot;Sachem&quot; came within range, and assisted in the defense of the fort.

Dowling&#x27;s well practiced Irish-Texan artillerymen, whose chosen and officially approved unit name was &quot;Jefferson Davis Guards&quot;, had placed range-stakes in the two narrow and shallow (5-to-7 feet or 1.5-to-2.1 m) river channels. These were the &quot;Texas channel&quot; near the southwest shore and the &quot;Louisiana channel&quot; against the Louisiana shore. The white-painted stakes were for determining accurate range of the fort&#x27;s guns: six old smooth-bore cannon. Each &quot;Davis Guards&quot; gun crew during gunnery practice thereby worked to predetermine the approximate charge (amount of gunpowder) needed for each type projectile available for their specific gun (ball, canister, or grapeshot); and which specific guns, charges, and loads had the best potential to hit each range-stake.

Crocker&#x27;s squadron had no local river pilots, but only general knowledge of the river&#x27;s channels, and no assurance of locations of the constantly varying depths especially of large oyster-shell &quot;reefs&quot; or &quot;banks&quot; between the river&#x27;s two channels. Regarding this battle no mention is found in official U.S. Navy reports of whether Union sailors were making observations and taking depth soundings from the gunboats&#x27; now dangerous top decks, while the Confederate cannon shots pounded and shook their ships. The few maps to which they had access were old and outdated or could not account for recent changes in river-bottom conditions. On Captain Crocker&#x27;s signal the &quot;Sachem&quot;, followed by &quot;Arizona&quot;, advanced up the right channel (Louisiana side) as fast as they dared, firing their port-side guns at the fort. &quot;Clifton&quot; approached in the lead, ascending the Texas channel at full speed. &quot;Granite City&quot; hovered out of range behind &quot;Clifton&quot;, having orders not to risk debarking the 500 assault troops until the fort surrendered or its guns were silenced. As &quot;Sachem&quot; entered among the range-stakes, the Confederates opened fire. Then &quot;Clifton&quot; came into range, followed by &quot;Arizona&quot;. Despite their old smoothbore cannon, one of which had just become inoperable, after only a few rounds it was obvious the Confederate artillerymen&#x27;s months of training and target practice was an astounding success as their aim was deadly accurate.
The Confederates captured &quot;Clifton&quot; and &quot;Sachem&quot; with a total of 13 heavy cannon, including at least two new potent Parrott rifles, which were handed over to Leon Smith&#x27;s Texas Marine Department. The Union casualties amounted to two dozen killed and badly wounded, about 37 missing, and 315 Navy men captured. The combined Union Army and Navy invasion force withdrew and returned to New Orleans. The Confederates had no casualties.

==Aftermath==

In recognition of the victory, the Confederate Congress passed a resolution of special thanks to the officers and men of the Davis Guard. In addition, Houston residents raised funds to provide medals to the Guard; the Davis Guards Medals were made from silver Mexican pesos by smoothing off the coins, then hand-stamping and hand-engraving on one side, the battle name and date and on the other side the initials &quot;D G&quot; and a cross pattée. The medals were hung on green ribbons, and presented to the members of the Davis Guard. The official Confederate silver medals were presented in a public ceremony a year later.

The Battle of Sabine Pass was of moderate tactical or strategic significance to the Civil War. It was successful in ensuring that the anticipated overland Union invasion of Texas was delayed indefinitely. A Confederate supply line from Mexico to Texas had existed out of the Port of Bagdad, since the outbreak of the war but was held by the increasingly isolated Mexican Republicans. By the time Imperial French and Mexican forces captured Bagdad in 1864, a supply line to anywhere in the Confederacy east of the Mississippi was no longer feasible on account of the Union victory at Vicksburg in July 1863. The Confederacy was therefore forced to continue its reliance on blockade running to import valuable materials and resources.

Born in Florence, he was descended from a prominent banking family that had lived in Tuscany, specifically in Siena, until the latter half of the 19th century. His father was Amedeo and his elder brothers Ugo (born in 1890, lawyer) and Guido (born in 1891, engineer). Castelnuovo-Tedesco was first introduced to the piano by his mother, Noemi Senigaglia, and he composed his first pieces when he was just nine years old. After completing a degree in piano in 1914 under Edgardo Del Valle de Paz (1861–1920), well-known composer and pianist pupil of Beniamino Cesi, he began studying composition under renowned Italian composer Ildebrando Pizzetti, and received a diploma in composition in 1918. He soon came to the attention of composer and pianist Alfredo Casella, who included the young Castelnuovo-Tedesco&#x27;s work in his repertoire. Casella also ensured that Castelnuovo&#x27;s works would be included in the repertoires of the &quot;Società Italiana di Musica Moderna&quot; (later the &quot;Corporazione delle Nuove Musiche&quot;), granting him exposure throughout Europe as one of Italy&#x27;s up-and-coming young composers. Works by him were included in the first festival of the International Society of Contemporary Music, held in Salzburg, Austria, in 1922.

In 1926, Castelnuovo-Tedesco premiered his first opera &quot;La Mandragola&quot;, based on a play by Niccolò Machiavelli. It was the first of his many works inspired by great literature, and which included interpretations of works by Aeschylus, Virgil, John Keats, William Wordsworth, Walt Whitman, Miguel de Cervantes, Federico García Lorca, and especially William Shakespeare. Another major source of inspiration for him was his Jewish heritage, most notably the Bible and Jewish liturgy. His Violin Concerto No. 2 (1931), written at the request of Jascha Heifetz, was also an expression of his pride in his Jewish origins, or as he described it, the &quot;splendor of past days&quot;, in the face of rising anti-Semitism that was sweeping across much of Europe.

At the 1932 festival of the International Society of Contemporary Music, held in Venice, Castelnuovo-Tedesco first met the Spanish guitarist Andrés Segovia. The meeting inspired Castelnuovo-Tedesco to write for the guitar, beginning with his &quot;Variazioni attraverso i secoli (Variations à travers les siècles)&quot; (Variations through the ages), Op. 71 (1932), and later his Guitar Concerto No. 1 (1939). All in all, he wrote almost one hundred compositions for this instrument, which earned him a reputation as one of the foremost composers for the guitar in the twentieth century. Some of them were written and dedicated to Segovia, who was an enthusiast of his style (Segovia called him an &quot;incorruptible servant of artistic truth&quot;).

Even before the Italian government promulgated the Italian racial laws in late 1938, Castelnuovo-Tedesco was banned from the radio and performances of his work were cancelled. The new racial laws, however, convinced him that he should leave Italy. He wrote to Arturo Toscanini, the former musical director of La Scala, and violinist Jascha Heifetz, explaining his plight, and both responded with support. As an American citizen, Heifetz began paperwork to sponsor Castelnuovo-Tedesco as an immigrant in the United States. Castelnuovo-Tedesco left Italy in 1939, shortly before the outbreak of World War II, and settled in Larchmont, Westchester County, New York (state).

He wrote his Cello Concerto in G minor, Op. 72, for Gregor Piatigorsky. It was premiered with the dedicatee under Arturo Toscanini in New York in 1935. For Piatigorsky he also wrote a Toccata (1935), and a piece called &quot;Greeting Card&quot;, Op. 170/3, based on the spelling of Piatigorsky&#x27;s name.

Like many artists who fled fascism, Castelnuovo-Tedesco ended up in Hollywood, where, with the help of Jascha Heifetz, he landed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as a film composer. Over the next fifteen years, he worked on scores for some 200 films there and at the other major film studios. Rita Hayworth hired him to write the music for &quot;The Loves of Carmen&quot; (1948), produced by Hayworth for her Beckworth Productions and released by Columbia Pictures.

As a teacher, Castelnuovo-Tedesco had a significant influence on other major film composers, including Henry Mancini, Nelson Riddle, Herman Stein and André Previn. Jerry Goldsmith, Marty Paich and John Williams were all his pupils, as was Scott Bradley, who studied privately with him while both were on staff at MGM. He also maintained close contact with composer Robert Strassburg. His relationship to Hollywood was ambiguous: later in life he downplayed the influence that it had on his own work, but he also believed that it was an essentially American artform, much as opera was European.

In 1946 he became a U.S. citizen, but he remained very close to Italy, which he frequently visited. In 1958 he won the &quot;Concorso Campari&quot; with the opera &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, which was first performed in 1961 at the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino under the baton of Gianandrea Gavazzeni.

In 1962 he wrote &quot;Les Guitares bien tempérées&quot; (&quot;The Well-Tempered Guitars&quot;) for two guitars, a set of 24 preludes and fugues in all 24 major and minor keys, for the duo-guitarists Alexandre Lagoya and Ida Presti. This was inspired by &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; by Johann Sebastian Bach, a composer Castelnuovo-Tedesco revered.

In the United States, Castelnuovo-Tedesco also composed new operas and works based on American poetry, Jewish liturgy, and the Bible. He died in Beverly Hills, California, in 1968 at the age of 72. He is buried at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery.

The Library of Congress in Washington, DC, hosts the &quot;Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco Collection&quot;, a collection of the composer&#x27;s manuscripts donated by his family in 2000. The catalogue is accessible online.

His oldest son was the psychiatrist Pietro Castelnuovo-Tedesco. His younger son was the architect Lorenzo Castelnuovo-Tedesco of Los Angeles.

==Works==
Castelnuovo-Tedesco&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;A life in music: a book of memories&quot;, written shortly before his death, was published decades later:
* &quot;Una vita di musica: un libro di ricordi&quot; (in Italian), James Westby (ed.), with an introduction by Mila De Sanctis, Fiesole: Cadmo, 2005. 

Other writings by the composer have been catalogued.

In 2018 a collection of contemporary guitar music in homage to Castelnuovo-Tedesco was published, edited by Piero Bonaguri. It includes works by composers Filippo Ferruggiara, Daniele Mandonico, Marco Reghezza, Marco Simoni, Alessandro Spazzoli, and Paolo Ugoletti.

In 2018, a film was released about his life entitled The Maestro where he was portrayed by actor Xander Berkeley. The film was well received and won the Audience Award at the Tallgrass Film Festival the Jury Award at the Borrego Springs Film Festival in 2019, and the Youth Film Award at the Rhode Island International Film Festival in 2018. Xander Berkeley also received &quot;Best Actor&quot; awards at the 2017 Oaxaca Film Festival and the 2018 Albuquerque Film &amp; Music Experience.

<doc id="1015498" wikidata="Q1190782" url="?curid=1015498" title="Maithili Sharan Gupt">
<text>Maithili Sharan Gupt (3 August 1886 – 12 December 1964) was one of the most important modern Hindi poets. He is considered one among the pioneers of &quot;Khari Boli&quot; (plain dialect) poetry and wrote in Khari Boli dialect, at a time when most Hindi poets favoured the use of Braj Bhasha dialect. He was a recipient of the third highest (then second highest) Indian civilian honour of Padma Bhushan. For his book Bharat-Bharati (1912), widely quoted during India&#x27;s freedom struggle, he was given the title of Rashtra Kavi by Mahatma Gandhi.

== Early life ==
He was born in Chirgaon, Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh in the Kankane clan of the Gahoi vanya community in a family that was once a wealthy zamindar family, but the wealth was lost by the time he was born. His father was Seth Ramcharan Gupta and mother&#x27;s name was Kashibai. Both his father and his brother Shearamsharan Gupta were prominent poets. He disliked school as a child, so his father arranged for his education at their home. As a child, Gupt studied Sanskrit, English and Bengali. Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi was his mentor. He married in 1895.

== Literary works ==
Gupt entered the world of Hindi literature by writing poems in various magazines, including &quot;Saraswati&quot;. In 1909, his first major work, &quot;Rang mein Bhang&quot; was published by Indian Press. With &quot;Bharat Bharati&quot;, his nationalist poems became popular among Indians, who were struggling for independence. Most of his poems revolve around plots from Ramayana, Mahabharata, Buddhist stories and the lives of famous religious leaders. His famous work &quot;Saket&quot; revolves around Urmila, wife of Lakshmana, from Ramayana, while another of his works &quot;Yashodhara&quot; revolves around Yashodhara, the wife of Gautama Buddha.

प्राण न पागल हो तुम यों, पृथ्वी पर वह प्रेम कहाँ..

मोहमयी छलना भर है, भटको न अहो अब और यहाँ..

ऊपर को निरखो अब तो बस मिलता है चिरमेल वहाँ..

=== Creative style ===

His works are based along patriotic themes, among others poets such as Ramdhari Singh Dinkar and Makhanalal Chaturvedi. His poetry is characterized by non-rhyming couplets in Khadi Boli. Although the couplet structure is non rhyming, the prominent use of alliterations lends a rhythmic backdrop due to the rhythmic alterations between vowels and consonants. He was a religious man, and this can be seen in his works.

== Political career ==
After India got independence in 1947, he was also made an honorary member of the Rajya Sabha, where he used poetry to put his opinions before the other members. He remained a member of the Rajya Sabha till his death in 1964. He was awarded Padma Bhushan in 1954.

<text>Sumitranandan Pant (20 May 1900 – 28 December 1977) was an Indian poet. He was one of the most celebrated 20th century poets of the Hindi language and was known for romanticism in his poems which were inspired by nature, people and beauty within.

==Early life==
His father served as the manager of a local tea garden, and was also a landholder, so Pant was never in want financially growing up. He grew up in the same village and always cherished a love for the beauty and flavor of rural India, which is evident in all his major works.

Pant enrolled in Queens College in Banaras in 1918. There he began reading the works of Sarojini Naidu and Rabindranath Tagore, as well as English Romantic poets. These figures would all have a powerful influence on his writing. In 1919 he moved to Allahabad to study at Muir College. As an anti-British gesture he only attended for two years. He then focused more on poetry, publishing &quot;Pallav&quot; in 1926. This collection established him as a literary giant of the Hindi renaissance that had begun with Jaishankar Prasad. In the introduction to the book, Pant expressed dissatisfaction that Hindi speakers &quot;think in one language and express themselves in another.&quot; He felt that Braj was out of date and sought to help usher in a new national language.

Pant moved to Kalakankar in 1931. For nine years he lived a secluded life close to nature. Simultaneously he grew enamored with the works and thinking of Karl Marx and Mahatma Gandhi, dedicating several verses to them in the poetry he produced during this time. Pant returned to Almora in 1941 where he attended drama classes at the Uday Shankar Cultural Centre. He also read Sri Aurobindo&#x27;s &quot;The Life Divine&quot;, which heavily influenced him. Three years later he moved to Madras and then to Pondicherry, attending Aurobindo&#x27;s ashram. In 1946 he returned to Allahabad to resume his role among the country&#x27;s other leading writers.

==Literary career==
He is considered one of the major poets of the &quot;Chhayavaadi&quot; school of Hindi literature. Pant mostly wrote in Sanskritized Hindi. Pant authored twenty-eight published works including poetry, verse plays and essays.

Apart from &quot;Chhayavaadi&quot; poems, Pant also wrote progressive, socialist, humanist poems and
philosophical (influenced by Sri Aurobindo) poems. Pant eventually moved beyond this style. As the late scholar and translator of Pant, David Rubin, writes, &quot;In the early forties the new psychological and experimental &quot;schools&quot; were emerging. It was typical of both Nirala and Pant that they themselves anticipated these trends and, by the time the new approaches were in vogue, they had already moved on to newer areas of experimentation.&quot;

Mahapran Nirala once remarked: 

==Awards==
In 1960, Pant received the Sahitya Academy award, given by India&#x27;s Academy of Letters, for &quot;Kala Aur Budhdha Chand&quot;.

In 1968, Pant became the first Hindi poet to receive the Jnanpith Award, considered to be India&#x27;s highest accolade for literature. This was awarded to him for a collection of his most famous poems titled &quot;Chidambara&quot;.

The Indian Government honored him with Padma Bhushan in 1961.

Sumitra Nandan Pant composed the Kulgeet of the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee &quot; -Jayati Vidya Sansthan&quot;.

==Death==
Pant died on 28 December 1977, at Allahabad (Prayagraj), Uttar Pradesh, India. His childhood house in Kausani has been converted into a museum. This museum displays his daily use articles, drafts of his poems, letters, his awards,books,stories etc.

<text>Sachchidananda Hirananda Vatsyayan (7 March 1911 – 4 April 1987), popularly known by his pen name Agyeya (also transliterated Ajneya, meaning &#x27;the unknowable&#x27;), was an Indian writer, poet, novelist, literary critic, journalist, translator and revolutionary in Hindi language. He pioneered modern trends in Hindi poetry, as well as in fiction, criticism and journalism. He is regarded as the pioneer of the &quot;Prayogavaad&quot; (experimentalism) movement in modern Hindi literature.

Son of a renowned archaeologist Hiranand Sastri, Agyeya was born in Kasia, a small town near Kushinagar in Uttar Pradesh. He took active part in the Indian freedom struggle and spent several years in prison for his revolutionary activities against British colonial rule.

He edited the &quot;Saptak&quot; series which gave rise a new trends in Hindi poetry, known as &quot;Nayi Kavita&quot;. He edited several literary journals, and launched his own Hindi language weekly &quot;Dinaman&quot;, which set new standard and trends in Hindi journalism. Agyeya translated some of his own works, as well as works of some other Indian authors to English. He also translated some books of world literature into Hindi.

Agyeya was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award (1964), Jnanpith Award (1978) and the internationally reputed Golden Wreath Award for poetry.

==Early life and education==
Agyeya was born as Sachchidananda Vatsyayan in Punjabi Brahmin family on 7 March 1911 in an archaeological camp near Kasia, Kushinagar district of Uttar Pradesh, where his father, Hiranand Sastri, an archaeologist, was positioned for an excavation. His mother was Vyantidevi (d. 1924) who was not much educated. Hiranand Sastri and Vyantidevi had 10 children, of whom Agyeya was the fourth. Agyeya spent his early childhood in Lucknow (1911–1915). Due to his father&#x27;s professional appointment at various places, he had to shift to various places including Srinagar and Jammu (1915–1919), Patna (1920), Nalanda (1921) and the Ootacamund and Kotagiri (1921–1925). Due to this peripatetic lifestyle, Agyeya came into contact with different Indian languages and cultures. His father, and who was a scholar in Sanskrit, encouraged him to study Hindi and taught him some basic English. He was taught Sanskrit and Persian by Pandit and Maulavi in Jammu.
After passing his matriculation in 1925 from the University of Punjab, Agyeya moved to Madras, joined the Madras Christian College, and did Intermediate in Science in 1927, studying mathematics, physics and chemistry. In the same year, he joined the Forman Christian College in Lahore, where he studied Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and English, and received a Bachelor of Science in 1929, standing first in a class. Thereafter he enrolled for an M.A. in English, but dropped out, and joined the Hindustan Socialist Republican Army (HSRA), a revolutionary organisation, with a view to fight for Indian independence movement, and participated in rebellious activities against the British colonial government. In November 1930, he was arrested on account of his involvement in the attempt to help Bhagat Singh, a socialist revolutionary and leader of HSRA, to escape from jail in 1929. He was then sentenced on charge of sedition against British rule in India. He spent the next four years in jail in Lahore, Delhi and Amritsar. During these prison days, he started writing short stories, poems and the first draft of his novel &quot;&quot;.
He was associated with the Progressive Writers Association (PWA) and, in 1942, he organised the All India Anti-Fascist Convention. During World War II in 1942, he joined the Indian army and was sent to the Kohima Front as a combatant officer. He left the army in 1946. He stayed at Meerut (Uttar Pradesh) for sometime and remained active in local literary groups. During this period, he published several translations into English of other writers, and a collection of his own poems, &quot;Prison Days and Other Poems&quot;.

Agyeya married Santosh Malik in 1940. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1945. He married Kapila Vatsyayan (née Malik) on 7 July 1956. They separated in 1969. He died on 4 April 1987, aged 76, in New Delhi. He was cremated at Nigambodh Ghat.

==Career==
After his release from jail in 1934, Agyeya worked as a journalist in Calcutta, and from 1939 for All India Radio.

Agyeya edited &quot;Sainik&quot; from Agra (1936–1937), &quot;Vishal Bharat&quot; from Calcutta (1937–1939), &quot;Prateek&quot; (1947) and &quot;Naya Prateek&quot; (1973) respectively from Allahabad and New Delhi. In English. he edited &quot;Vak&quot; (1951). He served as an editor of Jayprakash Narayan&#x27;s &quot;Everyman&#x27;s Weekly&quot; (1973–1974) and editor-in-chief of Hindi daily &quot;Navbharat Times&quot; (1977–1980) of the Times of India Group.

He travelled to Japan in 1957–58, where he learned about Zen Buddhism which influenced him and his writing style. In 1961, he joined the University of California, Berkeley as a visiting lecturer in Indian Literature and Civilization, and remained there until June 1964.

In 1965, he returned to India and became Founder Editor of the newsweekly &quot;Dinaman&quot; of the Times of India Group. When the members of the Hungry generation or &quot;Bhookhi Peerhi&quot; movement were arrested and prosecuted for their anti-establishment writings, Agyeya through &quot;Dinmaan&quot; relentlessly supported the young literary group of Culcutta till they were exonerated. His dispatches on Bihar&#x27;s famous famine are considered milestones in pro-people reporting.

He remained in India till 1968, before embarking on a trip to Europe. In 1969 he returned to Berkeley as Regents Professor, and continued there until June 1970. In 1976, he had an 8-month stint at Heidelberg University, as a visiting professor. Later he joined University of Jodhpur, Rajasthan as Professor and Head of the Department of Comparative Literature.

== Works ==

He also started writing the first draft of his autobiographical novel &quot;Shekhar: Ek Jivani&quot;, followed by its second and third draft. His first collection of poems, &quot;Bhagnadutta&quot;, appeared in 1933. After his release from the jail, he published his first short story collection, &quot;Vipathga&quot;, in 1937, and in 1941, he published the first volume of &quot;Shekhar: Ek Jivani&quot;, followed by the second volume in 1944. Its third volume, though announced, was never published.

In 1943, he edited and published &quot;Tar Saptak&quot;, a collection of poems by seven young writers, whose poems were not published before. Considered the first anthology of modern Hindi poetry and a milestone in the history of Hindi literature, &quot;Tar Saptak&quot; gave rise to the &quot;Prayogvad&quot; (Experimentalism) in Hindi poetry, and established a new trends Hindi poetry, known as &quot;Nayi Kavita&quot; (New Poetry).

== Reception ==
Agyeya was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1964 for his collection of poems &quot;Angan Ke Par Dwar&quot;, and the Jnanpith Award in 1978 for &quot;Kitni Naavon Mein Kitni Baar&quot;. He was also awarded the Bharatbharati Award and the Golden Wreath Award for poetry in 1983.

Agyeya is considered to be one of the most influential Hindi writers of the 20th-century and is seen as the founder of ādhuniktā (modernism) in Hindi literature. He is considered &#x27;the most westernised&#x27; among the Hindi writers between the 1940s and the 1960s. He was often criticised for his excessive use of intellectualism and individualism in his writings.

The scholar Sushil Kumar Phull calls Agyeya an &#x27;intellectual giant&#x27; and &#x27;pundit of language&#x27; (master of language), and compares him with English poet Robert Browning for his obscure and condense language which he used in his poetry.

==Dramatic productions==
His verse play &quot;Uttar Priyadarshi&quot;, about the redemption of King Ashoka was first staged in 1966 at Triveni open-air theatre in Delhi in presence of the writer. Later it was adapted to Manipuri, by theatre director, Ratan Thiyam in 1996, and since been performed by his group, in various parts of the world.

<text>Ramdhari Singh (23 September 1908 – 24 April 1974), known by his pen name Dinkar, was an Indian Hindi language poet, essayist, freedom fighter, patriot and academic. He emerged as a poet of rebellion as a consequence of his nationalist poetry written in the days before Indian independence. His poetry exuded &quot;Veer Rasa&quot; (heroic sentiment), and he has been hailed as a &quot;Rashtrakavi&quot; (&#x27;national poet&#x27;) and &quot;Yuga-Chāraṇa&quot; (Charan of the Era) on account of his inspiring patriotic compositions. He was a regular poet of Hindi Kavi Sammelan and is hailed to be as popular and connected to poetry lovers for Hindi speakers as Pushkin for Russians.

One of the notable modern Hindi poets, Dinkar was born in Simaria village of Bengal Presidency, British India, now part of Begusarai district in Bihar state. The government had honoured him with the Padma Bhushan Award in the year 1959 and had also nominated him thrice to the Rajya Sabha . Similarly, his political thought was greatly shaped by both Mahatma Gandhi and Karl Marx. Dinkar gained popularity in the pre-independence period through his nationalist poetry.

Dinkar initially supported the revolutionary movement during the Indian independence struggle, but later became a Gandhian. However, he used to call himself a &quot;Bad Gandhian&quot; because he supported the feelings of indignation and revenge among the youth. In , he accepted that war is destructive but argued that it is necessary for the protection of freedom. He was close to prominent nationalists of the time such as Rajendra Prasad, Anugrah Narayan Sinha, Sri Krishna Sinha, Rambriksh Benipuri and Braj Kishore Prasad.

Dinkar was elected three times to the Rajya Sabha, and he was the member of this house from 3 April 1952 to 2 April 1964, and was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1959. He was also the Vice-Chancellor of Bhagalpur University (Bhagalpur, Bihar) in the early 1960s.

During The Emergency, Jayaprakash Narayan had attracted a gathering of one lakh () people at the Ramlila grounds and recited Dinkar&#x27;s famous poem: (&#x27;Vacate the throne, for the people are coming&#x27;).

==Biography==
Dinkar was born on 23 September 1908, in Simaria village, Bengal Presidency, British India, (now in Begusarai district in Bihar) in a Bhumihar family to Babu Ravi Singh and Manroop Devi. He was married in Tabhka village of Samastipur district in Bihar. As a student, his favourite subjects were history, politics and philosophy. At school and later in college, he studied Hindi, Sanskrit, Maithili, Bengali, Urdu and English literature. Dinkar was greatly influenced by Rabindranath Tagore, Keats and Milton and translated works of Rabindranath Tagore from Bengali to Hindi. The poetic persona of the poet Dinkar was shaped by the pressures and counter-pressures of life during the Indian freedom movement. A tall man, in height, with a shining white complexion, long high nose, large ears and broad forehead, he tended to have a noticeable appearance. He worked as a Hindi teacher at Langat Singh College, Muzaffarpur, Bihar from 1950-1952.

As a student, Dinkar had to battle day to day issues, some related to their family&#x27;s economic circumstances. When he was a student of Mokama High School, it was not possible for him to stay on until school closed at four p.m. as he had to leave the class after the lunch break to catch the steamer back home. He could not afford to be in the hostel which would have enabled him to attend all periods. How could a student who had no shoes on his feet manage the hostel fees? His poetry later showed the impact of poverty. This was the environment in which Dinkar grew up and became a nationalist poet of radical views. In 1920, Dinkar saw Mahatma Gandhi for the first time. About this time, he founded Manoranjan Library at Simariya. He also edited a handwritten pamphlet.

===Creative struggle ===
When Dinkar stepped into his adolescence, the Indian freedom movement had already begun under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi. In 1929, when after matriculation, he entered Patna College to study intermediate; this movement started becoming aggressive. In 1928, the Simon Commission, against which nationwide demonstrations were being held, arrived. Demonstrations were held in Patna too led by Maghfoor Ahmad Ajazi and Dinkar too signed the oath-paper. Thousands came to the rally at Gandhi Maidan in which Dinkar also participated. During the protest against Simon Commission, the police of the British government mercilessly lathi charged the Lion of Punjab, Lala Lajpat Rai, who succumbed to the injuries. The whole country was in turmoil. The youthful mind of Dinkar became increasingly radical due to these agitations. His emotional nature was charged with poetic energy.

Dinkar&#x27;s first poem was published in 1924 in a magazine called (&#x27;Brother of Students&#x27;), a monthly journal published from Jabalpur by noted littérateur Beohar Rajendra Simha together with Narsinghdas Agrawal. In 1928, the peasant&#x27;s satyagraha under the leadership of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel proved successful in Bardoli of Gujarat. He wrote ten poems based on this Satyagraha which was published in a book form under the title (&#x27;Message of Victory&#x27;). This composition is now available. Right in front of Patna College, the office of Yuvak functioned. To escape the wrath of the government, Dinkar&#x27;s poems were published under the pseudonym &quot;Amitabh&quot;. On 14 September 1928, a poem of his, on the martyrdom of Jatin Das, was published. Around this time he wrote two small works of poetry called and , but neither of them are traceable now. In 1930, he composed a poem called (&#x27;The Breach of Vow&#x27;), which was mentioned by Ramchandra Shukla in his history. So the journey of his poetic career should be deemed to have begun with . Before this his poems had become a frequent feature of the magazine , published from Patna and of , which was published from Kannauj.

Dinkar&#x27;s first collection of poems, , was published in November 1935. Banarsi Das Chaturvedi, the editor of , wrote that Hindi-speaking people should celebrate the publication of . Around this time, Chaturvediji went to Sevagram. He took with him a copy of . The copy was given to Mahatma Gandhi.

The famous historian Dr. Kashi Prasad Jaiswal is said to have loved him like a son. During the early days of Dinkar&#x27;s poetic career, Jaiswal helped him in every way. Jaiswal died on 4 August 1937, which was a great blow to the young poet. Much later, he wrote in , a magazine published from Hyderabad, &quot;It was a good thing that Jaiswalji was my first admirer. Now when I have savoured the love and encouragement of the Sun, Moon, Varun, Kuber, Indra, Brihaspati, Shachi and Brahmani, it is clear that none of them was like Jaiswalji. As I heard the news of his death, the world became a dark place for me. I did not know what to do.&quot; Jaiswalji was the first person to appreciate the historical sense in the poetry of Dinkar.

==Work==
His works are mostly of , or the &#x27;brave mode&#x27;, although is an exception to this. Some of his greatest works are &quot;Rashmirathi&quot; and &quot;Parashuram ki Prateeksha&quot;. He is hailed as the greatest Hindi poet of &#x27;Veer Rasa&#x27; since Bhushan.

Acharya (teacher) Hazari Prasad Dwivedi wrote that Dinkar was very popular among people whose mother-tongue was not Hindi and he was a symbol of love for one&#x27;s own mother-tongue. Harivansh Rai Bachchan wrote that for his proper respect, Dinkar should get four Bharatiya Jnanpith Awards – for poetry, prose, languages and for his service to Hindi. Rambriksh Benipuri wrote that Dinkar is giving voice to the revolutionary movement in the country. Namvar Singh wrote that he was really the sun of his age.

Hindi writer Rajendra Yadav, whose novel also carried a few lines of Dinkar&#x27;s poetry, has said of him, &quot;He was always very inspiring to read. His poetry was about reawakening. He often delved into Hindu mythology and referred to heroes of epics such as Karna.&quot; He was a poet of anti-imperialism and nationalism, says well-known Hindi writer Kashinath Singh.

He also wrote social and political satires aimed at socio-economic inequalities and exploitation of the underprivileged.

A progressive and humanist poet, he chose to approach history and reality directly and his verse combined oratorical vigour with a declamatory diction. The theme of revolves round love, passion, and the relationship of man and woman on a spiritual plane, distinct from their earthly relationship.

His is a narrative poem based on the of the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;. It was written at a time when the memories of the Second World War were fresh in the mind of the poet. Nine verses from this larger poem were excerpted to form the power-packed short poem Shakti aur Kshama, which would form part of NCERT&#x27;s Hindi syllabus for class VII. The poem contains one of the most quoted of Dinkar&#x27;s verses: क्षमा शोभती उस भुजंग को जिसके पास गरल हो, उसको क्या जो दंतहीन विषरहित, विनीत, सरल हो। 

 is another poem composed about events that led to the Kurukshetra War in the . His is a collection of poems reflecting the poet&#x27;s social concern transcending the boundaries of the nation.

His is considered among the best retellings of the life of Karna of the Hindu epic .

== Krishna Ki Chetavani ==
Krishna ki Chetavani is the most celebrated and cited poem from one of his famous books &#x27;Rashmirathi&#x27;

following is the poem with English translation

Varsho tak van mein ghoom ghoom

Badha vighno ko chum chum

Sah dhoop, ghav, paani, patthar

Pandav aaye kuch aur nikhar

(For years, wandering in the forest,

Facing obstacles with resilience,

Enduring sun, wounds, water, stones,

The Pandavas returned, more refined.)

Saubhagya na sab din sota hai

Dekhe aage kya hota hai

(Good luck doesn&#x27;t always last

Let us see what happens next)

Maitri ki rah dikhane ko

Sabko su-marg par laane ko

Duryodhan ko samjhane ko

Bhishan vidhwans bachane ko

Bhagwan Hastinapur aaye

Pandav ka sandesa laaye

(To show the path of friendship

to bring everyone on the path of righteousness

in order to convince Duryodhan

and to prevent massive destruction

The Lord came to Hastinapur

with a message from the Pandavas)

Ho nyay agar toh aadha do

Par ismein bhi yedhi badha ho

Toh de do kewal paanch graam

Rakho apni dharti tamaam

(If you are just, then give them half of the Kingdom

but if you have a problem with even that

then give them five villages at least

and keep the rest to yourselves)

Hum wahi khushi se khayenge

Parijan par asi na uthayenge

(We will be happy even with that much

and we will never take up arms against our relatives)

Duryodhan Waha bhi de na saka

Aashish samaj ki na le saka

Ulte Hari ko bandhne chala

Jo tha asadhya saadhne chala

(Duryodhan couldn&#x27;t even give them that

and hence he couldn&#x27;t even receive the blessings of society

Instead, he tried to chain Krishna

and in doing so tried to attempt the impossible)

Jab naash manuj par Chaata hai

Pehle vivek marr jata hai

(When the end draws near

the first thing a man loses is his wisdom)

Hari ne bhishan hunkar kiya

Apna swaroop vistaar kiya

Dag-mag dag-mag diggaj dole

Bhagwan kupit hokar bole

(Hari roared

and expanded his form

the mighty trembled

as the Lord, angered, spoke)

Zanjeer badha ab saadh muze

Ha ha Duryodhan bandh muze

(Bring out your chains

and yes Duryodhan, try to imprison me)

Ye dekh gagan mujhmein lay hai

Ye dekha pawan mujhmein lay hai

Mujhmein vileen jhankar sakal

Mujhmein lay hai sansaar sakal

(Look, the skies are within me

look, the wind is within me

Look closely, the entire universe is within me)

Amaratwa phoolta hai mujhmein

Sanhaar jhoolta hai mujhmein

(Immortality &amp; destruction both are within me)

Udayachal mere dipt bhaal

Bhumandal vaksha sthal vishaal

Bhuj paridhi bandh ko ghere hai

Mainak meru pag mere hai

(The dawn is my forehead

the solar system my chest

my arms have surrounded the Earth

the Mainak &amp; Meru are at my feet)

Deepte jo grah nakshatra nikhar

Sab hai mere mukh ke andar

(And my mouth holds all the luminous planets &amp; constellations)

Drugg ho toh drushya akhand dekh

Mujhmein saara brahmand dekh

Charachar jeev jag kshar - akshar

Nashwar manshya srujaati amar

(If you are capable then see the whole universe in me

the living, the non living, the eternal)

Shat-koti surya, shat-koti chandra

Shat-koti saritsar, shati-koti sindhu mandra

(Millions of suns, millions of moons

millions of rivers &amp; oceans)

Shat-koti Bramha, Vishnu, Mahesh

Shat-koti Jalpati, Jishnu, Dhanesh

Shant-koti Rudra, Shat-koti Kaal

Shat-koti danddhar lokpal

(Millions of Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh

millions of seas &amp; Jishnu &amp; Dhanesh

Millions of Rudra &amp; millions of Kaal

Millions of Kings)

Bhutal atal paatal dekh

Gat aur anagat kaal dekh

Ye dekh jagat ka aadi srujan

Ye dekh Mahabharata ka rann

(See the Earth &amp; see the hell

see the times past &amp; future

see the beginning of creation

see the war of Mahabharata)

Mrutako se pati huyi bhu hai

Pehchaan kaha ismein tu hai

(The land is covered with the dead,

now find where are you among them)

Ambar ka kuntal jaal dekh

Pad ke neeche paatal dekh

Mutthi mein teeno kaal dekh

Mera swaroop vikraal dekh

(See the heavens

and see the Paatal beneath my feet,

see in my fists the past, present &amp; future

see my terrifying appearance)

Sab janma mujhise paate hai

Fir laut mujhimein aate hai

(Everyone is born of me

And everyone eventually returns to me)

Jivha se kaadhti jwala saghan

Saaso se pata janma pawan

Par jaati meri drishti jidhar

Hasne lagti hai srishti udhar

(Look at my tongue emitting fire

my breath gives birth to the winds

where my eyes see

nature blooms there)

Main jab bhi mundta hoon lochan

Cha jaata charo or maran

(but when I close my eyes

death reigns)

Bandhne mujhe tu aaya hai

Zanjeer badi kya laya hai?

Yadi mujhe bandhna chahe mann

Pehle tu bandh anant gagan

(You have come to arrest me

Have you got a chain big enough?

because imprisoning me

is like trying to chain that limitless sky)

Shunya ko saadh na sakta hai

Wo muze bandh kab sakta hai

(When you cannot measure infinity

how can you imprison me?)

Hit vachan nahi tune maana

Maitri ka mulya na pehchana

Toh le ab main  bhi jata hoon

Antim sankalp sunata hoon

(You did not heed good advice

and did not value our friendship

so I will leave now

making this vow)

Yachana nahi ab rann hoga

Jeevan jay ya ki maran hoga

(There will be no more requests, there will a be war now,

victory will be the fate of life or death)

Takrayenge nakshatra nikhar

Barsegi bhu par vanhi prakhar

Fan sheshnaag ka dolega

Vikraal kaal muh kholega

(Constellations will clash

Fire will rain down on the earth

the Sheshnaag will bare its hood

and death will open its jaws)

Duryodhan rann aisa hoga

&quot;Fir kabhi nahi jaisa hoga&quot;

(Duryodhan a war like never before will take place)

Bhai par bhai tootenge

Vish-ban boond se chutenge

Saubhagya manuj ke phutenge

Vaayas shrugaal sukh lutenge

(Brothers will fight brothers

as arrows rain down

the good men will suffer

while the jackals &amp; hyenas will feast)

Aakhir tu bhushaayi hoga

Hinsa ka pardaayi hoga

(In the end you will be destroyed

and will be the cause of all violence)

Thi sabha sunn, sab log dare

Chup the ya the behosh pade

Keval do nar na aghate the

Dhritarashtra Vidur sukh paate the

(A deadly silence had descended on the court, everyone there was scared

some had fallen silent while some had fainted

Except for two who remained unaffected

Dhritarashtra &amp; Vidur were the fortunate ones)

Kar jod khade pramudit nirbhay

Dono pukarte the jay, jay

(With hands joined, fearless &amp; with love in their hearts

the kept chanting &#x27;jai jai&#x27;)
In his , he said that despite various cultures, languages and topography, India stands united, because &quot;however different we may be, our thoughts are one and the same&quot;. Dinkar made the understanding of historical perspectives much more direct by looking at the history of India&#x27;s culture in terms of four major encounters: the autochthons (indigenous people) ; between Vedic beliefs and the philosophy propounded by the Buddha, as well as by Mahavira; between Hinduism and Islam; and finally between European civilisation and the Indian way of life and learning. These encounters at different periods of history have imparted strength to India&#x27;s culture. The most striking feature of India&#x27;s civilizational history has been its marked tolerance and human approach with its potential to impart a message to the world.

History is not merely a compilation of facts. History is written from an ideological perspective. The poet Dinkar wrote in the context of values emerging from the freedom movement. The nationalist view of history, which was propounded in the field of history, is propounded by Dinkar in the field of culture. The values which developed in the context of the freedom movement determine the perspective of this book. Those values are anti-colonialism, secularism and the idea of integrated culture. This book has been written around these very values. Dinkar is the nationalist historian of Indian culture.

Divided into four vast chapters, in the first chapter, the form and development of the culture of India from pre-Vedic times to around the middle of the 20th century has been discussed. In the second chapter the Buddhist and Jain religions which grew as a revolt against ancient Hinduism have been analysed. In the third chapter, the influence of Islam on Hindu culture after its advent along with the influence of Islam on Hindu-Muslim relations, like – nature, language, art and culture has been studied. In this chapter a very authentic investigation into the mutual relation between the Bhakti movement and Islam has been presented. In this context, it has also been considered how the culture of India acquires an integrated form. In the fourth chapter, a comprehensive account of the colonialisation of education and the clash of Christianity with Hinduism, etc., since the arrival of Europeans in India has also been given. In this chapter, along with an inquiry into the Renaissance of the 19th century, the contributions of the leading leaders of the Renaissance have been comprehensively discussed. A leading characteristic of this chapter is also that a copious account of the Hindu Renaissance and with it of the Muslim Renaissance and its limitations have been presented.

Dinkar :

 The vast panoramic overview of Dinkar&#x27;s historiography of India&#x27;s composite culture verges on a kind of Darwinist evolutionism. The idea of India of Dinkar&#x27;s imagination is reminiscent of the American &#x27;melting pot&#x27; model of assimilative nationalism.

<text>Yashpal Singh (3 December 1903 – 26 December 1976) was a Hindi-language writer, political commentator, a socialist and an essayist. He wrote in a range of genres, including essays, novels and short stories, as well as a play, two travel books and an autobiography. He won the Hindi-language Sahitya Akademi Award for his novel &quot;Meri Teri Uski Baat&quot; in 1976 and was also a recipient of the Padma Bhushan.

== Early life and activism ==
Yashpal was born on 3 December 1903 in the village of Bhumpal, (present-day Hamirpur district) situated within the Kangra Hills in British India. His mother was poor and had sole responsibility for raising her two sons. He grew up in an era when the popularity of the Indian independence movement was steadily increasing and with a mother who was a keen supporter of Arya Samaj. He attended an Arya Samaj gurukul in Haridwar on a &quot;freeship&quot; basis, due to the family&#x27;s poverty. Such gurukuls were considered by the colonial administration to be &quot;hotbeds of sedition&quot; because they fostered pride in Hindu culture and Indian achievements, encouraging the notion that British rule was a &quot;temporary setback or punishment for having permitted laxity in the Aryan religion.&quot; Yashpal later said that during his schooldays he had daydreamed of a time when Indians would reverse the current situation to the point of ruling the British in England. He was bullied by his fellow pupils at the gurukul on account of his poverty, and he left the school when he suffered a prolonged attack of dysentery.

Reunited with his mother in Lahore, Yashpal attended middle school there before progressing to high school in Ferozepur Cantonment, where the family had subsequently moved. He found the urban environment and schooling to be more to his taste and he finished first in class in his matriculation exam.

Yashpal had been a follower of Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s Congress organisation from the age of 17, while still in high school. He toured villages to promote Gandhi&#x27;s message of non-cooperation among peasant people but they appeared disinterested and he realised that there was nothing in the Congress programme that addressed issues that affected them. It was after one such tour that he received his matriculation results, the success in which entitled him to a scholarship at a government college. He declined that award in favour of having to fund himself through studies at National College, Lahore, an institution that had been established by the Arya Samajist and Congress activist Lala Lajpat Rai with the aim of promoting social service and providing a quality education to Indians who did not want to be taught in British-administered colleges.

== Hindustan Socialist Republican Association ==
It was at National College that Yashpal met people such as Bhagat Singh and Sukhdev Thapar who were later to become the nucleus of the Punjabi armed revolution movement. Encouraged by the tutelage of Jaichandra Vidyalankar, a historian and associate of Ghadarites, this group of students read widely of political theory and past revolutionaries from Europe and India. The Hindustan Republican Association became known as the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) in 1928, with the change of name probably being largely due to the influence of Bhagat Singh, who was a prominent figure in it. Sharing Singh&#x27;s disillusionment with the impact of Gandhi&#x27;s non-cooperation strategy, Yashpal joined with it. His work for the HSRA was generally behind the scenes and he had a lower public profile than people who physically engaged in acts of revolution, such as Singh, Rajguru and Chandrashekar Azad. While continuing his activism, he was employed as a clerk by the Lakshmi Insurance Company, a role that he deeply disliked and described 

Yashpal became a fugitive in April 1929, hiding for a few weeks with a relative (Pandit Shyama) in the Kangra area (village Samhoon near Rail in Hamirpur) after a recently established HSRA bomb factory in Lahore was raided by police. Realizing that the HSRA cause could not be furthered unless its members were organised, he was back in Lahore before June. Bhagat Singh and Sukhdev Thapar had both been arrested and he did not have contact details for any members who were free. Sukhdev Thapar was able to give him details of another member after Yashpal visited him in prison, posing as a lawyer, but the information was voided soon after due to a police raid on the HSRA&#x27;s other bomb factory, in Saharanpur. Some of those arrested at both factories became informants.

Yashpal then held discussions with leaders of the Hindu Mahasabha. However, he differed from them ideologically. Their offer to pay the HSRA 50,000 rupees to assassinate Muhammad Ali Jinnah was the final straw: the organisation of which he was a member were not to be guns for hire.

The last significant armed act of the HSRA was the attempt on 23 December 1929 to blow up a train carrying the then viceroy, Lord Irwin. Yashpal detonated that bomb, which destroyed the dining car but only inconvenienced Irwin. With several of its leaders imprisoned, some of whom were subsequently executed, Chandrashekar Azad reorganised the HSRA in 1930. Yashpal was appointed to the central committee and became organiser in Punjab. It was around this time that he met his future wife, Prakashvati Kapur, through his HSRA work. That relationship caused much jealousy and also concern among other HSRA members: the 17-year-old Prakashvati was considered too young to be involved with the group, although already paying a subscription, and was perceived as being vulnerable. There were also concerns about his commitment to the cause, since people thought that the life of a revolutionary was not compatible with marriage and HSRA members had taken a vow of celibacy. The outcome was dramatic: Yashpal found out that some of his colleagues were plotting to kill him for being a double agent of the British under orders from Azad, and the HSRA was beset with internal divisions regarding those concerns and also accusations that Yashpal might turn informant, His information came from the would-be assassin, a member of the HSRA who was acting as an informer for the British authorities. In September 1930, despite his personal acceptance of Yashpal&#x27;s false integrity and honour, Azad felt it necessary to disband the fractured movement, distributing its weapons among the membership and telling them to go fight for the revolutionary cause on a decentralised, provincial basis rather than under direction from the committee.

While making various abortive attempts to visit Russia in order to investigate the outcomes of the revolution there, Yashpal continued to work with Azad until the latter died in February 1931 during a shoot-out with police in Allahabad. He tried then to reunite the HSRA and was eventually successful, being elected commander-in-chief in January 1932 and putting his name to a seditious handbill that was distributed. He was arrested by the British in Allahabad on 22 January 1932.
Defended by a member of the Nehru family, Shyam Kumari Nehru, Yashpal tried to claim the status of a political prisoner, which might improve the conditions of his confinement. He received a 14-year sentence of rigorous imprisonment, seven of those being on the charge of attempted murder in Cawnpore and a further seven for attempting to kill a police officer in a shoot-out that had occurred a day after his arrival in Allahabad. Nehru told him that the judge had originally intended these sentences to run concurrently but had changed his decision to consecutive during a delay in finalising the paperwork. The change could have been significant because a fourteen-year sentence was &quot;de facto&quot; equivalent to one of life imprisonment: government review and permission for release was required once the sentence was complete. As events turned out, and after facing further charges in May 1932, resulting from the deliberations of the Delhi Conspiracy Commission and later abandoned, Yashpal served six years before being among those released under an amnesty agreement for political prisoners that was brokered by the newly formed Congress government in the United Provinces. As far as Congress were concerned, there was no difference in status between people who had been imprisoned for non-cooperation (the &quot;satyagrahis&quot;) and those serving sentences for revolutionary activities. His release came on 2 March 1938, without any requirement for him to renounce his past activities.

Despite his own misgivings concerning his future prospects, given his criminal history and increasingly poor health while in jail, Prakashvati had determined to marry him and did so at her insistence. The ceremony took place at Bareilly Central Jail on 7 August 1936 and was the first marriage to be conducted in an Indian jail. It caused a furore, being considered an unwarranted humanisation of the strictures of imprisonment. Prison manuals were amended to prevent a recurrence.

== Writing ==
It was after Yashpal&#x27;s release from prison that he began to write, seeing literature as a vehicle for righting the wrongs that he perceived to exist in Indian society. Marxism became his preferred ideology; he saw the Communist Party of India as the successor to the HSRA, although he joined neither that nor any other political party. 

Yashpal had been banned from entering Punjab following his release from prison and so settled with his wife in Lucknow. His first work, &quot;Pinjre ki Uran (Flight from the Cage)&quot; (1939), was a notable success. He worked briefly for &quot;Karmayogi&quot;, a Hindi-language magazine, before establishing his own magazine, &quot;Viplav (Cataclysm)&quot;, which was published in Hindi and Urdu until its closure in 1941. The closure became necessary because the government, which considered &quot;Viplav&quot; to be seditious, demanded a 13,000 rupee security; the magazine was restarted after India gained independence in 1947. In 1941, he established a publishing house called &quot;Viplava Karyalaya&quot; and, in 1944, a printing press called Sathi Press.

Yashpal&#x27;s next books – &quot;Dada Kamred (Comrade, The Big Brother)&quot; (1941) and &quot;Deshdrohi (Traitor)&quot; (1943) – were both fictional works that had the Communist Party as a central theme. Other essays, novels, and short stories were published between that time and Indian independence, and these added to the impression that he was an agitator. That impression caused his arrest in 1949 and jailing by order of the Government of Uttar Pradesh, which was at that time arresting people with communist sympathies due to an illegal railway strike that had Communist Party support. A public outcry at his arrest ensued and the government had to back down in a humiliating manner, although they did succeed in banning him from Lucknow for a period of six months and thus caused the final closure of &quot;Viplav&quot;.

His autobiography, &quot;Sinhavalokan (A Lion&#x27;s Eye-View&quot; or &quot;A Backward Glance)&quot;, was published in three volumes between 1951–55 and is recognized for its detailed account of the armed struggle for independence in India as well as for information on his own early life. He was writing a fourth volume of this autobiography at the time of his death on 26 December 1976.

Yashpal was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1970.

== Literary criticism ==
Yogendra Malik notes that as a Marxist novelist, Yashpal formed a part of 

&quot;Meri Teri Uski Baat (My, Your and Her Story)&quot; (1974), a novel, won the Hindi-language Sahitya Akademi Award in 1976, shortly before his death. Writing on behalf of the same institution, Bhisham Sahni described Yashpal&#x27;s short stories as carrying on the tradition of Premchand, although focussed more on urban society than that of the rural and lower-middle class. Corinne Friend says that &quot;he has been characterised by many as the most gifted writer of Hindi literature since Prem Chand&quot;.

The two volumes of &quot;Jhutha Sach&quot; (1958 and 1960), Yashpal&#x27;s voluminous novel based on events surrounding the Partition of India, have been compared to Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot; by many writers and critics. Harish Trivedi, a professor of English, says that these comparisons were sufficiently numerous that &quot;with his eyesight failing, Yashpal arranged for someone to read Tolstoy&#x27;s great work to him — perhaps to figure out what the fuss was all about&quot;.

There are three themes that run throughout Yashpal&#x27;s writings, being those of gender equality, revolution and romance. While much of his work concerns contemporary or near-contemporary situations, he explored the distant past in novels such as &quot;Divya&quot; (1945), &quot;Amita&quot; (1954) and &quot;Apsara ka Shap&quot; (1965).

== Centenary celebrations ==
In 2003–2004, there were centenary celebrations of his birth and a commemorative postage stamp was issued by India Post on 3 December 2003.

<text>The Uruguayan Air Force (, abbreviated FAU) is the air service branch of the Armed Forces of Uruguay. Originally created as part of the National Army of Uruguay, the Air Force was established as a separate branch on December 4, 1953. It is the youngest and also the smallest branch of the Armed Forces of Uruguay. In 1977 it was determined that the mission of the Air Force is to conduct strategic and tactical aerospace operations on behalf of the national defense, exercising the sovereignty of the Uruguayan airspace and defending the independence, integrity, constitution and laws of the country. The Air Force must also conduct search and rescue missions and plan, propose, execute and supervise the necessary measures for the development of the aerospace potential, while providing any necessary and possible logistical support during the natural disasters that the country may suffer. Since 1985 this has been always carried out under the command of the President of Uruguay, and according to the Minister of National Defense.

==History==

=== Antecedents ===
Military aviation in Uruguay was born on 17 March 1913 when the Military Aviation School (&quot;Escuela Militar de Aviación&quot;) was formed. Like other Latin American countries, flight instruction was initially performed by a European instructor pilot. In Uruguay, this was made by the French instructor Marcel Paillette, who trained ten National Army officers who had been chosen to be the first Uruguayan military pilots. Among them were Captain Juan Manuel Boiso Lanza and Lieutenant Cesáreo L. Berisso. Berisso was one of the first graduates from that school, and on 22 June 1913, he carried out the first solo flight by a Uruguayan, flying from Los Cerrillos to Malvín in 1 hour 45 minutes. He then became the first director of the military aviation flight school and continued his military career until reaching the rank of General. He died on July 28, 1971, and became the namesake of Gen. Cesáreo L. Berisso Air Base in Carrasco, the headquarters of Air Brigade I. Boiso Lanza, however, was the first fatality of the Uruguayan military aviation. He died in a plane crash on 10 August 1918, when he was training in France, and later became the namesake of Cap. Juan Manuel Boiso Lanza Air Base, where the General Command of the Uruguayan Air Force is located in Montevideo. In his honor, August 10 was also made the military aviation martyrs day.

Along with two other young Army officers, Adhemar Saenz Lacueva and Esteban Cristi, the school that was formed was the only military aviation facility in Uruguay until 1935, and used several European aircraft types in fairly large numbers before American aircraft became the most predominant ones. During the twenties, and among them, were sixteen Avro 504K, thirteen Breguet 14, five Castaibert 913-IV and twenty-eight Nieuport 27. These pioneering years saw many air routes opened and an overall increase in the awareness of the aviation with military potential.

=== Aeronáutica Militar ===
In 1935 the Military Aeronautics (&quot;Aeronáutica Militar&quot;) was established and transformed the military aviation of Uruguay into a more professional weapon of the National Army. New units and airbases were created, and also new and more modern aircraft types were introduced into service. Among the aircraft used during this period were de Havilland DH.82 Tiger Moth and IMAM Ro.37. 

At the beginning of 1935, the Uruguayan Army suppressed an armed movement against Gabriel Terra government by members of different political factions. Military operations such as the Battle of Paso de Morlan and the bombardment of revolutionary positions with Tiger Moth aircraft meant the first combat use of military aviation in Uruguay. Then, during 1942 Curtiss SNC-1 Falcon and North American T-6 Texan training aircraft began their service in Uruguay, as did the Beechcraft AT-11 Kansan and Douglas C-47 Skytrain in 1947. Between 1949 and 1950 a total number of 39 aircraft were acquired, including 25 North American F-51D-20-NA Mustang, 11 North American B-25J-25-NC Mitchell and 3 Douglas C-47A Skytrain. With the help of the United States via the Military Assistance Program (MAP), these aircraft allowed the military aviation of Uruguay to grow not only in size but in training.

=== Creation of the Uruguayan Air Force ===

On December 4, 1950, with Law No. 12070, the Military Air Force (&quot;Fuerza Aérea Militar&quot;) was created as a separate branch of the Armed Forces. All the elements of infrastructure, material, aircraft, personnel and items belonging to the Military Aeronautics were transferred to the new Air Force, as it was established in the first article of the law. The second article of this law established the creation of the General Inspection of the Air Force (&quot;Inspección General de la Fuerza Aérea&quot;), which under the immediate authority of the Ministry of National Defense, became the direct command of the Military Air Force. 

=== Combat patrols during the Revolución Libertadora ===
On June 16, 1955, the Argentine Navy, supported by members of the Army and the Argentine Air Force rebelled against the Government of Juan Perón, in what is known as the Revolución Libertadora. Therefore, the Uruguayan Military Air Force had to change its operational routine according to orders issued by the Executive branch, in order to maintain air surveillance in the event of any violation of Uruguayan sovereignty by Argentine forces. That same day, F-51Ds and B-25Js were fully armed, and around 16:00 local time a first order was given for two F-51s to scramble to Colonia, and a B-25 to the north coast. On September 17, 1955, a section of two F-51 crewed by 1st Lt. Walter Samarello and Lt. 2nd Miguel Lagrotta, who were on a reconnaissance mission, sighted two Argentine warships. These ships appeared in a visual aid that had been delivered to all the pilots of the Aviation Group No. 2, which contained the profiles of the ships of the Argentine fleet. When sighted, the ships fired several bursts of anti-aircraft fire, and Lieutenant Samarello decided to shelter the section among the clouds. The Argentine crew, upon noticing the error and realizing that they were firing at Uruguayan planes, communicated over radio to an Air Force station in Cerrito de la Victoria, Montevideo, a request to not be flown over to avoid confusion, specially after one of these rebel ships had already been attacked by Argentine Air Force pilots loyal to Perón.

=== Jet age ===
In 1956 the Military Air Force was, for the first time, referred to as the Uruguayan Air Force, and thus it could be considered that from this point forward this name began being used. One of the first milestones of the Uruguayan Air Force was also in 1956, when as a result of the Army and later Air Force capability of sustaining a high level of flight training with its F-51D aircraft, flying over 4,000 hours in one year and through the help of the Military Assistance Program, the Aviation Group No. 2 (Fighters) (&quot;Grupo de Aviación N.° 2 (Caza)&quot;) received its first jet aircraft, four Lockheed T-33A-5-LO that arrived at the Carrasco International Airport on October 23, 1956, beginning the jet age in Uruguay. The flight training that the United States Air Force (USAF) pilots gave in these new jet aircraft was fundamental for the Air Force, and not only veteran but new pilots of the Aviation Group No. 2 were able to transition from flying piston aircraft to jet aircraft on its own, ruling that the Air Force was ready to receive its first single seat jet fighters, Lockheed F-80C-10-LO Shooting Star. These aircraft arrived in 1958 and replaced the North American F-51D-20-NA Mustang in their mission.

In 1959, at the initiative of Brigadier Conrado A. Saez, General Inspector of the Air Force at the time, the Uruguayan Military Air Transport (&quot;Transporte Aéreo Militar Uruguayo&quot;) was founded to complement the flag carrier First Uruguayan Air Navigation Lines (&quot;Primeras Líneas Uruguayas de Navegación Aérea&quot;) and provide passenger and cargo services to different cities in the interior of the country and also abroad. TAMU began operating Douglas C-47 Skytrain and would later use Fokker F27 Friendship, Fairchild-Hiller FH-227D, Embraer C-95 Bandeirante and CASA C-212 Aviocar of the Uruguayan Air Force. The service of the C-95 in Uruguay marked the first Embraer export in its entire history, when a total number of five of these brand new aircraft were purchased in 1975.

=== The Air Force and the Uruguayan dictatorship ===

Since the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s, the Air Force was involved in the fight against the guerrilla activity that was present in the country, focusing against the MLN-T (&quot;Movimiento de Liberación Nacional – Tupamaros&quot; or Tupamaros – National Liberation Movement), that later triggered a participation in the country&#x27;s politics.

On February 8, 1973, President Juan María Bordaberry tried to assert his authority over the Armed Forces by returning them to their normal duties and appointing a retired Army general, Antonio Francese, as the new Minister of National Defense. Initially, the Navy of Uruguay supported the appointment but the National Army and Uruguayan Air Force commanders rejected it outright. On February 9 and 10, the Army and Air Force issued public proclamations and demanded his dismissal and changes in the country&#x27;s political and economic system. Bordaberry then gave up to the pressure, and on February 12, at the Cap. Juan Manuel Boiso Lanza Air Base, Headquarters of the General Command of the Air Force, the National Security Council (&quot;Consejo de Seguridad Nacional&quot;) was created. The Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force was one of its permanent members, and the Armed Forces of Uruguay from now on were effectively in control of the country, with Bordaberry just participating in a self-coup.

During this period of time, the Uruguayan Air Force took control of the country&#x27;s airdromes, some aircraft that were seized from the subversion, appointed some of its general officers to led the flag carrier PLUNA and modernized its combat fleet with Cessna A-37B-CE Dragonfly and FMA IA-58A Pucará attack aircraft in 1976 and 1981. The cargo fleet was also renewed, with the purchase of five Embraer C-95 Bandeirante in 1975 and five CASA C-212 Aviocar in 1981. One brand new Gates Learjet 35A was also purchased in 1981, which was one of the only two military transport jet aircraft, being the last one a C-29 that was introduced in 2018, and sold in 2020.

In 1981 two brand new Bell 212 helicopters were also purchased.

The Uruguayan Air Force achieved another milestone, with the first landing of a Uruguayan aircraft in Antarctica, on January 28, 1984, with an Fairchild-Hiller FH-227D.

Since the end of the military government, the Air Force has returned to its normal tasks, and always acting under the command of the President and in agreement with the Minister of National Defense, without having entered the country&#x27;s politics again, whose participation, in addition, has been forbidden in almost all activities for the Armed Forces.

Between 1992 and 1999 a total number of 36 aircraft were acquired, including the first four-engined and biggest aircraft in Uruguayan Air Force history, three Lockheed C-130B Hercules to carry out long-range strategic missions and six Pilatus PC-7U Turbo Trainers for advanced training in 1992, replacing the aging fleet of Beechcraft T-34 Mentors that were in service since 1977. Two Beechcraft Baron 58 and ten Cessna U-206H Stationair were purchased in 1998, with Uruguay becoming the first operator of the H variant of the Cessna 206, using them for transport, training and surveillance. Two Eurocopter AS365N2 Dauphin for search and rescue and VIP transport missions were also purchased during 1998, followed by 13 Aermacchi T-260EU in 1999, a new basic trainer for the Military School of Aeronautics (&quot;Escuela Militar de Aeronáutica&quot;) in Pando, Canelones. On April 27, 1994, through Decree No. 177/994 of the Executive Power, a new structure was approved, and the Tactical Regiments and Aviation Groups disappeared to become Air Squadrons, leading to the actual organization of the Air Force.

== Present state of the Air Force ==
While the long-range strategic cargo fleet of Lockheed C-130B Hercules was replaced with two Lockheed KC-130H Hercules, that also became the first aerial refueling capable aircraft of the Uruguayan Air Force in 2020, from the 1990s onwards, various attempts have been made to renew the combat aircraft to no avail, with the T-33A being withdrawn from service in 1996 and the Air Squadron No. 2 (Fighters) suffering two fatal accidents on January 31, 2004 and August 12, 2016, with A-37B aircraft. The obsolescence of the aircraft with which the unit is currently equipped has left the Uruguayan Air Force out of step with the technological advances that aerial warfare was acquiring through the experiences of conflicts during the late 20th century and during the 21st century, which, however, has not prevented the squadron and the Air Force itself from successfully participating in joint exercises between various Air Forces in the region, such as CRUZEX in Brazil or SALITRE in Chile.

In May 2013 eighteen refurbished Sukhoi Su-30 MkI were offered by the Russian Federation and Sukhoi in remarkably favorable conditions that included credit facilities and an agreement branch for maintenance. These conditions were also offered for the Yak-130 Mitten. By December 2013 Uruguayan personnel had test flown this plane in Russia. According to Scramble a number of A-37B Dragonfly were purchased from the Ecuadorian Air Force in January 2014. Also, the Uruguayan and Swiss governments discussed a possible agreement for the purchase of ten Swiss Air Force Northrop F-5 plus engines, spare parts and training, but no actual progress was made.

The Uruguayan Air Force also used to show interest on the IA-58D Pucará Delta modernization program offered by Fábrica Argentina de Aviones, but more recently, among some of the possible aircraft that the Air Force was considering, there are the Hongdu JL-10 or the Alenia Aermacchi M-346 Master, but despite how necessary its renewal is, no purchases has been made.
