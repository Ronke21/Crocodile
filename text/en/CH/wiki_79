<text>The Guelph Platers were a junior ice hockey team based in Guelph, Ontario, Canada. The team played in the Ontario Hockey League, Ontario Junior Hockey League, and Southern Ontario Junior A Hockey League. They were originally known as the CMC&#x27;s until 1972, the Biltmore Mad Hatters until 1975, and then took on the name Platers. The Platers were promoted to the Ontario Hockey League in 1982 and moved to Owen Sound in 1989. The franchise played in the Guelph Memorial Gardens.

==History==
===Early years===
The CMC&#x27;s were founded as members of the Central Junior B Hockey League, now the Ontario Junior Hockey League, in 1968. In 1970, the CMC&#x27;s merged with and took the place of the Guelph Beef Kings of the Western Junior &quot;A&quot; Hockey League (formerly the Western Division of the Big 10). The league was reincorporated into the Ontario Hockey Association and changed its name to the Southern Ontario Junior A Hockey League for the 1970–71 season. CMC was an acronym for Central Mechanical Contractors.

===Southern Junior A===

After two years playing in the SOJHL, the CMC&#x27;s won the Junior &#x27;A&#x27; league title, in the 1971–72 season. In the Ontario Championship, they took on the Thunder Bay Vulcans of the now defunct Thunder Bay Junior Hockey League. The CMC&#x27;s were leading 3-games-to-2 (5-4, 5–4, 3–7, 0–7, 6-2) when they won the series by default after the Vulcans discontinued.

Moving onto the Eastern Canadian Final, the CMC&#x27;s faced Charlottetown from the Island Junior Hockey League. The result of the series was a four-game sweep (5-2, 6–3, 5–2, 5-2), in favour of Guelph.

Guelph travelled to the Centennial Cup versus the Red Deer Rustlers of the Alberta Junior Hockey League. The CMC&#x27;s swept the Rustlers (4-2, 3–2, 3–1, 3-0), taking the National title. The team was coached by Bill Taylor and starred Paul Fendley, Doug Risebrough, and John Van Boxmeer.

In 1972 the CMC&#x27;s changed their names to the Guelph Biltmore Mad Hatters. The Biltmores won the SOJHL championship again in 1975, then defeated the Smiths Falls Bears of the Central Junior A Hockey League in 6 games (8-3, 3–4, 7–2, 6–4, 3–6, 5-2) to reach the Centennial Cup finals a second time.

The Biltmores were defeated 4-games-to-2 (3-4, 2–3, 4–1, 5–2, 6–3, 6-5 OT) by the Spruce Grove Mets of the Alberta Junior Hockey League. The 1975 Biltmores were bolsterted on defence by late season pick-up Craig Hartsburg of Minnesota North Stars fame.

Following the season, the Biltmores were bought by the Holody family, the owners of a local electroplating company. The Holodys changed the team name to the Guelph Holody Platers.

In 1975, the Biltmores of the Southern Ontario Junior A Hockey League (SOJHL) were bought by Guelph, Ontario&#x27;s wealthy Holody family, the owners of a local electroplating company. The Holodys changed the team name to the Guelph Holody Platers. The team remained in the SOJHL for the next two years, finishing first both times.

===OHA Junior &#x27;A&#x27; years===
The SOJHL folded in 1977. Two of its four teams, Guelph and the Hamilton Mountain A&#x27;s, became part of the Ontario Hockey Association Junior &quot;A&quot; League. The Platers, featuring future Montreal Canadiens goaltender Brian Hayward, won the 1977–78 Manitoba Centennial Trophy as national Junior &#x27;A&#x27; champions. It was the second national title for the franchise, which had also won the Centennial Cup in 1972 as the CMC&#x27;s.

In 1978–79, the Platers became the first team to win the Dudley Hewitt Cup as provincial champions. In the 1980–81 season, the Platers reached the Tier II championship for southern Ontario, but were defeated by another future OHL team, the Belleville Bulls. The 1981–82 season proved to be the last season for the Platers in the OHA-A. As they won their second Dudley Hewitt Cup, they were announced as the latest expansion team of the Ontario Hockey League.
===OHL Major Junior years===
After being turned down as an OHL expansion team in 1981, Guelph was approved the next year for the 1982–83 season. Guelph&#x27;s first season in the OHL was dismal. The team set OHL records at the time for losing 63 of their 70 games, for most home and away losses, and most goals against in one season with 555. All of these records have since been surpassed by other teams in the Canadian Hockey League.

In 1986, the Guelph Platers caught the entire Canadian Hockey League off-guard. Led by coach Jacques Martin, the team reached the playoffs for the first time in franchise history by finishing second in the Emms Division (Western Conference). The Platers continued their hard work through the playoffs, winning the J. Ross Robertson Cup by defeating the Belleville Bulls 8 points to 4 in the final. Guelph travelled to the Memorial Cup that year, bringing home the national championship to complete their Cinderella season.

===Memorial Cup 1986===
The Memorial Cup championship of 1986 was hosted by the Western Hockey League, with games originally scheduled for New Westminster, British Columbia, but were switched to Portland, Oregon due to a hotel shortage caused by Expo &#x27;86. Their opponents would be the Portland Winter Hawks (hosts), Kamloops Blazers (WHL Champs) and the Hull Olympiques (QMJHL Champs.

Guelph finished first in the round-robin and took a bye to the finals, where they would play the Hull Olympiques of the QMJHL for the championship. The surprise season ended with two pairs of surprise goals 11 and 13 seconds apart respectively. The Platers won the game 5–2 to capture the Memorial Cup.
Fame was short-lived for the Platers however. The team suffered through more losing seasons with poor attendance. After the 1988–89 season, the Holodys moved the team to Owen Sound, Ontario, retaining the name &quot;Platers&quot;. Alec Campagnaro was given the Bill Long Award for distinguished service to the OHL in 1989.

Paul Fendley of Georgetown, Ontario was a member of the 1971-72 Guelph CMC&#x27;s who died as a result of an on ice accident at Guelph Memorial Gardens during Guelph&#x27;s Centennial Cup 1972 victory. The 19-year-old player died at Kitchener-Waterloo General Hospital on May 8, 1972, seventy-three hours after striking his head on the arena ice.

Fendley was checked by an opponent with 11 minutes to play in the game. He tried to catch his balance while still handling the puck and lost his helmet in the process, falling and striking the bare back of his head on the ice.

Fendley was the 1972 SOJHL Leading Scorer with 20 goals and 24 assists in 43 games. He also scored 14 goals and 18 assists in 26 playoff games before his accident. The game in which he was fatally injured was the final and clinching game of the Centennial Cup.

==Arena==
The Guelph Platers played at the Guelph Memorial Gardens located in downtown Guelph. The team and the arena played host to the OHL All-Star game in 1984. Demolition of the Gardens began in 2006.

==The Imperials==
The City of Guelph was unhappy with the fact that their Junior A team had been moved to Kitchener in 1963. Left with only the Guelph CMC&#x27;s at the OHA Junior B level, the City jumped at the 1968 offer of the newly-renegade Western Ontario Junior A Hockey League to give the city a new Junior A team. After a pair of losing seasons and a name change to the Beef Kings, the league was reincorporated into the OHA as a Tier II Junior A league and the franchise being bought out by the CMC&#x27;s. From that point on, the CMC&#x27;s took the Beef King&#x27;s place.

<text>Norman Fell (born Norman Noah Feld; March 24, 1924 – December 14, 1998) was an American actor of film and television, most famous for his role as landlord Mr. Roper on the sitcom &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; and its spin-off, &quot;The Ropers&quot;, and his film roles in &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot; (1960), &quot;The Graduate&quot; (1967), and &quot;Bullitt&quot; (1968). Early in his career, he was billed as Norman Feld.

==Early life==
Fell was born on March 24, 1924, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Samuel and Edna Feld. His father was an Austrian Jewish immigrant, and his maternal grandparents were Russian Jews. He attended Central High School of Philadelphia. He studied drama at Temple University after serving as a tail gunner on a B-25 Mitchell in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. He later honed his craft at The Actors Studio and the Black Hills Players.

==Career==
Aside from Fell&#x27;s best-known television work, he also played minor character roles in several films, including the original &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot; with the Rat Pack, &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot;, &quot;PT 109&quot; with Cliff Robertson as John F. Kennedy, Mike Nichols&#x27; &quot;The Graduate&quot;, &quot;Bullitt&quot; with Steve McQueen, and &quot;Catch-22&quot; (as Sergeant Towser). He appeared alongside Ronald Reagan in Reagan&#x27;s last film, &quot;The Killers&quot; with Lee Marvin and Clu Gulager, in which Reagan portrays a villain who slaps Angie Dickinson. In 1992, he starred as a hotel owner in a comedy film titled &quot;Hexed&quot;.

On TV, Fell portrayed Mike in &quot;Joe and Mabel&quot; (1955–1956), Howie Fletcher in &quot;The Tom Ewell Show&quot; (1960–1961), Meyer Meyer in &quot;87th Precinct&quot; (1961–1962), Charles Wilentz in &quot;Dan August&quot; (1970–1971), Nathan Davidson in &quot;Needles and Pins&quot; (1973), Bernie Solkin in &quot;Executive Suite&quot; (1976–1977), Richie&#x27;s father in &quot;Richie Brockelman, Private Eye&quot; (1978), and Ben Cooper in &quot;Teachers Only&quot; (1982–1983).

From 1977 to 1979, Fell portrayed the main characters&#x27; landlord Stanley Roper on the hit sitcom &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; (a role with some similarities to hard-edged, suspicious landlord Mr. McCleery in &quot;The Graduate&quot;, who was on the lookout for reasons to evict Benjamin Braddock, like Mr. Roper did with Jack Tripper). He continued the role as the co-lead with Audra Lindley playing his wife, Helen, on &quot;The Ropers&quot;, a spin-off which lasted two seasons, airing from 1979 to 1980.

Fell won a Golden Globe Award for Best TV Actor in a Supporting Role in 1979 for &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;. He was nominated for an Emmy Award for his dramatic performance as the boxing trainer of Tom Jordache (Nick Nolte) in the miniseries &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man&quot;. His final television appearance was a cameo as Mr. Roper on an episode of the sitcom &quot;Ellen&quot; in 1997.

==Personal life==
On May 21, 1950, Fell married Dolores Pikoos in Philadelphia. They divorced in 1954 and Fell married and divorced two subsequent times. He had two daughters, Tracy and Mara, with his second wife and adopted a son with his third wife, Karen Weingard.

<text>The Toronto Marlborough Athletic Club, commonly known as the Toronto Marlboros, was an ice hockey franchise in Toronto, Canada. Founded in 1903, it operated junior ice hockey and senior ice hockey teams in the Ontario Hockey Association and later the Ontario Hockey League. The Marlboros were a farm team to the Toronto Maple Leafs and one of the dominant junior teams in history, winning seven Memorial Cup championships. The senior team competed for the Stanley Cup in 1904, and won the Allan Cup in 1950. After decline from the late 1970s, the sale of the franchise, and a move away from Toronto, it became the Guelph Storm in 1991.

Their heritage has been perpetuated by the Toronto Marlboros Hockey Club, which operates several minor ice hockey teams in the Greater Toronto Hockey League; and by the Toronto Marlies of the American Hockey League.

==History==
The Toronto Marlborough Athletic Club was founded in Toronto, Ontario in 1903 by a group of Toronto sportsmen. It was named after the Duke of Marlborough. A hockey program was started in 1904. The team was commonly known as the Marlboros or Marlies and was also nicknamed the Dukes.

The senior ice hockey team played in the Ontario Hockey Association and won the J. Ross Robertson Cup in 1904, 1905, 1941, 1949 and 1950. 

The senior team competed for, but lost, the Stanley Cup in 1904 against the Ottawa Silver Seven. The club was thrust onto the national scene in 1927 when Conn Smythe bought the Toronto Marlboros to be the farm team for his other recently acquired National Hockey League team, the Toronto Maple Leafs. From 1927 to 1989 the Marlboros and Maple Leafs shared common ownership, first under the Smythe family and later under Harold Ballard. 

In 1933, Frank J. Selke testified in court that the Marlboros senior team had a proposed agreement to guarantee its finances by the Toronto Maple Leafs. The agreement went unsigned when OHA secretary W. A. Hewitt voiced opposition to the financial support of amateur teams by professional teams.

The Marlboros served as a farm team for the Maple Leafs for 40 years until direct NHL sponsorship of junior teams ended in 1967 when the NHL made the Entry Draft universal; however, the two clubs continued to remain affiliated under a common ownership until 1989. During this time the Marlboros sent over 180 players to the NHL, including six future Hockey Hall of Fame inductees. The two teams often played double headers on Saturdays, with the junior games in the afternoon and the NHL games in the evening.

The original Hot Stove Club was formed at Maple Leaf Gardens on May 28, 1937, for the purpose of raising funds to support the Marlborough Hockey Club. The Hot Stove Club was given a permanent bar &amp; lounge at Maple Leaf Gardens in 1963. From 1929 to 1975 the Marlboros won the national junior championship seven times.

Marlboro players from the Memorial Cups in the 1950s and 1960s jumped directly to the Maple Leafs, helping them win the Stanley Cup four times in the 1960s. Former NHL stars stayed in the organization to help coach in the junior ranks. Turk Broda and George Armstrong both coached the Marlboros to Memorial Cup victories.

Stafford Smythe organized the Metro Junior A League in 1961 as a rival league to the OHA, with the Marlboros as its charter member. After the league folded in 1963, the Toronto Neil McNeil Maroons were amalgamated into the Marlboros along with prospect players signed to the Toronto Maple Leafs, along with their coach Jim Gregory.

The Marlboros returned to prominence again in 1973, coached by former Toronto Maple Leafs captain George Armstrong. Armstrong&#x27;s team in 1973 lost only seven games all season, and two years later he coached the Marlboros to their seventh national title in 1975.

The team began to decline in the standings in the late 1970s which continued through the 1980s. Many people felt that Harold Ballard&#x27;s penny-pinching ways helped contribute to the demise of Canada&#x27;s most successful junior team. In October 1988, with the team losing hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, Maple Leaf Gardens Limited reached an agreement to sell the Toronto Marlboros for a reported $500,000, severing their ties with the Maple Leafs. The Leafs retained the rights to the Marlies name. The OHL team moved to Hamilton for the 1989-90 season, becoming the Dukes of Hamilton. They were not financially successful in Hamilton, though, and after only two seasons the Dukes became the Guelph Storm.

==Championships==
The Toronto Marlboros won the Memorial Cup seven times, more than any other team in the Cup&#x27;s history. The Marlies also won 10 OHA championships in 18 final appearances.

==Memorial Cups==

===1929 ===
The Marlboros reached their first Memorial Cup series in 1929 after being upset in 1928 by the Ottawa Gunners. In 1929 the Marlboros defeated the Ottawa Shamrocks in a two-game total goals series by 6–5. Ottawa won the first game 4–3, and Toronto won the second game 3–1.

Toronto played the Elmwood Millionaires from Winnipeg, Manitoba, in a best of three series starting on March 29 at the Arena Gardens (Mutual Street Arena) for the Memorial Cup. The Marlboros won the first game 4–2 in overtime. On March 31, Toronto won game 2 by an identical score of 4–2 for its first Memorial Cup.

===1955===
Turk Broda took over the coaching duties of the Marlboros midway through the 1954–55 season. In the playoffs the Marlboros defeated the reigning Memorial Cup champions St. Catharines Teepees, followed by the Quebec Remparts to win the Eastern Canadian championship.

After a long train ride to Regina, Saskatchewan, to Marlboros and the Regina Pats took part in the First Annual Memorial Cup Dinner. The idea of the banquet was one of Harold Ballard&#x27;s many long-lasting effects on the game. The next day the two teams would start a best of seven series for the Cup.

Regina won the first game 3–1. Toronto won the next two games scores of 5–2, and 3–2. Regina tied up game four at 2 goals each in the dying minutes of regulation to send the match to overtime. Billy Harris scored in overtime to give the Marlboros a 3 games to 1 lead. Game five was also tied after three periods. Toronto scored three unanswered goals, winning 8–5 in overtime, and their second Memorial Cup.

===1956===
Toronto defeated the Montreal Junior Canadiens in an 8-game series to return to the Memorial Cup and a rematch versus the Regina Pats.
The championship series started at Maple Leaf Gardens on April 27.

The teams tied the first game at 4 goals each. Toronto put together three consecutive victories by scores of 5–1, 4–2, and 6–1.
The Marlboros captured their second consecutive Memorial Cup in game five by a score of 7–4. The Oshawa Generals were the first team to accomplish the feat in 1938–39 and 1939–40.

1964&lt;br&gt;
Toronto defeated the defending OHA champions Niagara Falls Flyers and the Montreal Jr. Canadiens to win the J. Ross Robertson Cup. The Marlboros swept the NOHA champion North Bay Trappers to play the Quebec champion Notre-Dame-de-Grace Monarchs, who were coached by Scotty Bowman. Toronto prevailed to return to the Memorial Cup after an eight-year absence. Their opponent was the perennial Abbott Cup champion Edmonton Oil Kings.

The series opened at Maple Leaf Gardens with a 5–2 Toronto victory. The Marlboros won games two and three with scores of 3–2 and 5–2. Toronto finished the series sweep with a 7–2 win in game 4. Many of the players on the 1964 Marlboros team, including Ron Ellis, Mike Walton and Pete Stemkowski, helped the Maple Leafs capture the Stanley Cup in 1967.

===1967===
Toronto defeated the Montreal Jr. Canadiens and Hamilton Red Wings for the OHA title, then eliminated the Thetford Mines Canadiens to capture the eastern Canadian championships. The Marlboros played the Port Arthur Marrs in the Memorial Cup series hosted at the Fort William Gardens in what is now the city of Thunder Bay, Ontario.

The Marlboros won the first two games by scores of 6–3, and 8–4. Port Arthur won the third game 6–4 in a heavily penalized match, including a bench brawl with one second left in the game. Toronto won the last two games by scores of 6–0, and 6–3 capturing its 5th Memorial Cup. In 1966–67, the Maple Leafs also won the Stanley Cup, the last year the two clubs were national champions at the same time.

===1973===
The Marlboros of 1972–73 lost only seven games in the regular season. The team was ranked # 1 in Canada going into the playoffs. Toronto eliminated the St. Catharines Black Hawks and Ottawa 67&#x27;s before meeting the Peterborough Petes in the OHA finals.

The series versus the Petes went to a seventh game played at Maple Leaf Gardens in front of 16,485 spectators, a record at the time for junior hockey attendance. Toronto needed only a tie game to advance, and did so in dramatic fashion. Paulin Bordeleau scored on a penalty shot in the last minute to tie the game at 5 goals each.

After winning the OHA title, the Marlboros travelled to Memorial Cup hosted at the Montreal Forum where their opponents would be the Quebec Remparts and the Medicine Hat Tigers, who were led by future NHL star Lanny McDonald.

The Marlies beat Quebec 5–2 in the first game, and lost 3–2 to the Tigers in the second game. The Remparts then beat the Tigers 8–3 in game three. Since each team had won a game, Toronto and Quebec played each other in the finals based on goals for and against. The Marlboros scored a 9–1 victory for their 6th Memorial Cup.

===1975===
The 1975 playoff run for the Marlboros was complicated by Mark Napier and John Tonelli signing professional contracts before the season ended. Tonelli would sit out all the Marlboros games after his 18th birthday so he would not jeopardize playing for the Houston Aeros.

Toronto stumbled through the playoffs managing come-from-behind victories in series versus the 8th place Kingston Canadians and 5th place Sudbury Wolves. Both series went 8 games, and the Marlboros were a point away from being eliminated each time but stayed alive. The Marlboros then beat the Hamilton Fincups in the finals for their last OHA championship. Toronto would face the New Westminster Bruins, and the Sherbrooke Castors in the Memorial Cup series played at the Kitchener Memorial Auditorium Complex.

Toronto beat Sherbrooke 5–4 in overtime in game 1 after coming back from three goals down. The Bruins beat the Castors (Beavers in English) 7–5 in game two, defeated Toronto 6–2 in the third game to reach the finals. In a rematch versus the Castors in the semi-final, Toronto won 10–4 to reach the finals versus New Westminster.

The Marlboros continued their momentum in the finals winning 7–3, and capturing their seventh and final Memorial Cup championship. Coach Armstrong said it was all worth it, even after his team had tossed him into the hotel swimming pool during a victory party.

==Coaches==
One of the most famous Maple Leafs and Marlboros of all time, George Armstrong, coached the Marlboros to their final two Memorial Cup victories in 1972–73 and 1974–75.

Two Toronto Marlboros coaches have been awarded the Matt Leyden Trophy as the OHA Coach of the Year: George Armstrong 1972–73 in his first year, and Dave Chambers in 1979–80.

:&quot;Partial list of Toronto Marlboros coaches.&quot;

==Players==
Until the NHL instituted the Entry Draft in 1967, the Maple Leafs relied heavily on the Jr. A. Marlboros to produce NHL players. Many players were part of Maple Leafs Stanley Cup winning teams. In total, 202 OHA Junior Marlboros went on to play in the National Hockey League.

;Notes
==Uniforms and logos==

In 1903 club secretary Fred Waghorne wrote to the Duke of Marlborough in England for permission to use the storied name and crest. In choosing its logo the club took the Marlborough family crown and added the initials A.C. for Athletic Club.

The Toronto Marlboros used the same colour scheme as the NHL Toronto Maple Leafs from 1927 when the two clubs came under common ownership. The Marlborough crown was originally displayed by itself on the jersey chest. It was not until the late 1950s that the crown was set against the present day Maple Leaf.

==Arenas==
In the beginning both the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Marlboros practised and were headquartered out of the old Ravina Gardens in Toronto&#x27;s west end. Home games were played downtown at the Arena Gardens.

In 1931 Maple Leaf Gardens opened up for business and the Marlboros had a new home again. In 1964 the Marlboros won the Memorial Cup on home ice, the same year the Toronto Maple Leafs won the Stanley Cup on home ice.

The Marlboros occasionally also played games in the 1970s at the North York Centennial Centre and the Markham Centennial Centre when Maple Leaf Gardens was unavailable, usually due to scheduling conflicts at MLG with both the Toronto Maple Leafs and also the Toronto Toros of the WHA. They also played part of their home schedule in the 1976–77 season in Brantford, Ontario out of the Brantford Civic Centre.

==Perpetuations==
===Minor hockey===
The Toronto Marlboros Hockey Club operates several minor ice hockey teams in the Greater Toronto Hockey League (GTHL). This club operated independently to the former OHA Junior &#x27;A&#x27; team. After the Junior &#x27;A&#x27; team left for Hamilton, the then Maple Leafs owner Harold Ballard granted permission for the Minor Marlboros to retain the Marlborough name. Three years later in the fall of 1992 the Marlboros combined their fabled crest with the current NHL Maple Leafs&#x27; uniform.

NHL alumni of the GTHL Marlboros include, Sam Gagner, Ron Handy, Mike Hough, Peter Ing, Chris Kelly, Nathan LaFayette, Connor McDavid, Rick Nash, Mike Ricci, Jason Spezza, Brian Wilks, Wojtek Wolski and John Tavares.

===American Hockey League===
When Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment decided to relocate their American Hockey League minor league team, the St. John&#x27;s Maple Leafs to Toronto, they renamed the team the Toronto Marlies after the original Toronto Marlboros club.

<doc id="1034639" wikidata="Q3621342" url="?curid=1034639" title="Umpire (field hockey)">
<text>An umpire in [[field hockey]] is a person with the authority to make decisions on a hockey pitch in accordance with the rules of the game. Each match is controlled by two such umpires. In theory they are responsible for decisions taken on their respective half of the field, but practically they &quot;control&#x27; on either diagonal half of the field. In many higher-level events, a &quot;reserve umpire&quot; is appointed in addition to the two &quot;field umpires&quot; to act as a back-up in the event of injury or other issue preventing a field umpire from commencing or continuing a match. In World-Level competitions, a &quot;video umpire&quot; is also appointed in addition to the field and reserve umpires.

==Role and positioning==
The role of the umpires is to control the match, apply the rules of hockey, uphold a duty of care to the players (keeping the game safe), be the judges of fair play and keep the flow. Each umpire has the primary responsibility for decisions in one half of the field, and is the only one allowed to award a penalty corner, penalty stroke or goal in their half of the field or a free hit in their circle (see diagram). However, they may consult with their colleague before making these decisions. They must also ensure that the correct amount of time is allowed for the match and record the scoring of goals and issuing of penalty cards to players. Similarly to football referees, most decisions are signalled using a whistle (and the use of the whistle is specifically instructed in the Rules), and the use of various hand signals.

Originally their half of the field was taken to coincide with the two halves of the pitch as divided by the halfway line. Now the division is generally taken to run down the diagonal of the pitch, from top left to bottom right in the accompanying pitch diagram. For breaches of the rules bordering the umpires&#x27; &#x27;area of control&#x27;, jurisdiction is generally given to whichever umpire the play is coming towards. When play is in and around their shooting circle, the umpire will generally take up a position in the shooting circle, particularly if play has come from the further side of the pitch, and when play is more in the middle of the pitch will be closer to the right-hand sideline (facing the goal for which they are responsible). Positioning in the shooting circle is critical as correct decisions are necessary here to maintain the control of the match as well as the outcome. Exact positioning will be determined by the need to keep the ball in view, the desire to be reasonably close to the ball and the relative pace of the game. The preferred position of most umpires is behind and to the right of the play as the lead umpire, whilst the other umpire (the trailing umpire) is around 15 m behind at a 45-degree angle with the engaged umpire.

==History==
The early history of hockey officiating is quite similar to that of football refereeing: decisions could only be made on appeal by the players (compare with cricket where this is still the case for some decisions); and if no dedicated official was available the team captain could act as an umpire in addition to playing. Over time it has come to be desirable that the umpires should be neutral, although many matches are still played with one umpire from each club involved in the game.

==Uniform==
Umpires are required by the Rules to wear clothing of &quot;similar colours to one another, but different from those of both teams&quot;. 
In practice, umpires appointed by their Association, National body or the FIH wear black slacks (male) or a black skirt with knee-high black socks (female). In club competitions, particularly in colder climates, females often adopt the black pants instead of a skirt. Each competition has its own approved umpiring shirt, sometimes with various colour options and sometimes with different shirts for different competition divisions (for example, the premier league may have a different shirt to the remainder of the competition).

In February 2012, Grays International became the new supplier of official&#x27;s uniforms (including umpiring shirts) for FIH competitions, replacing TK. Grays manufacture three colours of umpire shirts for international matches - red, yellow and blue. Previous colours used by the FIH include cerise, turquoise and yellow (circa 2005) and fuchsia, turquoise and purple (circa 2000).

==Video umpires==
In FIH World-Level competitions, where facilities are available, a video umpire is appointed in addition to the field and reserve umpires. The scope of the video umpire&#x27;s role is restricted to making decisions as to whether or not a goal has been legally scored. To this end, the video umpire may assist in decisions to determine:
* whether the ball crossed the goal line (within the area bounded by the goal posts and crossbar);
* whether the ball was legally played or touched inside the circle by the stick of an attacker and did not travel outside the circle before passing completely over the goal-line and under the cross-bar;
* whether the ball travelled outside the circle before it entered the goal from a shot by an attacker during the taking of a penalty corner;
* whether a breach of the Rules has been observed within the attacking 23 metre area in the play leading to the awarding or disallowing of a goal. It is then for the Match Umpire to take any breach into account in reaching their decision.
Decisions may be referred to the video umpire upon the request of a player of either team, or directly by a field umpire. Each team is permitted one video umpire referral per match, which is retained if the referral is successful and forfeited if the referral is unsuccessful. There is no limit to the number of field umpire referrals in a match.

The show went into national syndication and was moved to Philadelphia in 1965. The program ran until 1981. It was distributed by Westinghouse Broadcasting, and for much of its run, originated from studios at two of the company&#x27;s TV stations in Cleveland and Philadelphia.

==History in Cleveland==
&quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; premiered on KYW-TV in Cleveland on December 11, 1961, and featured a mix of light banter with guests and musical performances, along with more serious interviews with prominent newsmakers. Local entertainment shows were popular in the early days of television. Joining Douglas as part of the everyday lineup was the Ellie Frankel Trio, a local jazz group. Instead of an opening comedic monologue (as was the case with &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, for example), Douglas, given his vocalist background, would begin each show by singing a popular song for the audience. Each week would have a different co-host who would appear every day with Douglas.

The inevitable growing pains of a new program were evident during the first week of shows, when the scheduled co-host, Irish singer Carmel Quinn, missed the first two shows due to a scheduling conflict in New York. In addition, faulty microphones on the inaugural broadcast were coupled with equally problematic chairs that caused a pair of guests to fall off stage.

Some moments of controversy developed in the opening months, including a guest&#x27;s satirical look at First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy&#x27;s televised tour of the White House that was criticized for bad taste, and a look at censorship that was to involve the reading of selections from books such as &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; and &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;. The show was postponed until a representative for banning such books could be found.

In February 1963, singer Barbra Streisand was the show&#x27;s co-host. During that week, she was performing in a local night club, and was asked by the club owner to promote her appearances on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; each day. The reason given was that Cleveland newspapers were in the midst of a lengthy labor strike, preventing any consistent advertising. Douglas later said that the station erased the videotapes of Streisand&#x27;s appearance, as most early television programs did, in order to re-use them for station editorials.

Just a few months later, Douglas had atheist Madalyn Murray as a guest, three days after the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled in her favor in the &quot;Abington School District v. Schempp&quot; case, which banned mandatory Bible reading in public schools.

In September 1963, &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; was syndicated to four other television stations owned by Westinghouse: KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh, WBZ-TV in Boston, WJZ-TV in Baltimore and KPIX in San Francisco. Less than one year later, the show had expanded to a total of 27 cities.

On November 22, 1963, Douglas was speaking with Federal Housing Administrator Robert C. Weaver, when station newscaster John Dancy interrupted the live broadcast by walking through the audience in order to give the first reports of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The show soon ended as NBC began its four-day coverage of the tragedy.

On July 23, 1964, comedian Henry Morgan made a brief appearance at the start of the show, but later walked out when Douglas was interviewing Dr. Sam Sheppard, who had been released from prison one week earlier.

==History in Philadelphia==
In 1965, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) reversed a 1956 station switch, in which NBC strong-armed Westinghouse to move to Cleveland, so it could have a station in the much larger Philadelphia market. With NBC forced to move back to Cleveland, Westinghouse regained control of what had been NBC-owned WRCV-TV in Philadelphia and transferred the KYW-TV callsign there. NBC, which took over the former KYW-TV, subsequently rechristened as WKYC-TV, tried to buy &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; to keep it in Cleveland. However, it was the only really big moneymaker for Westinghouse&#x27;s syndication unit at the time, so the show moved with KYW-TV to eastern Pennsylvania in August.

At first, &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; was broadcast from a 140-seat basement studio located in the WRCV/KYW building at 1619 Walnut Street (see photos on right). It continued to be aired live until the following year when Zsa Zsa Gabor called Morey Amsterdam a &quot;son of a bitch&quot; for interrupting her joke during the April 29, 1966, program. After that, the program aired on a one-day tape delay basis, allowing for the editing out of any objectionable material. Live broadcasts (with a seven-second delay) were attempted only on a few special occasions thereafter, such as when the Philadelphia Flyers won the Stanley Cup.

Future political consultant and Fox News Channel founder and CEO Roger Ailes served as a producer beginning in 1965, then as executive producer from 1967–68. It was while working on the show in 1967 that he met Richard Nixon, with whom he had an off-air discussion about television and politics. Nixon subsequently hired Ailes to work as a media consultant on his 1968 presidential campaign, thus launching Ailes&#x27;s career as a national political consultant and media strategist.

In July 1972, the show moved to a new studio in the newly constructed KYW-TV studios at 5th and Market streets in Center City Philadelphia. That studio (&quot;Studio A&quot;) was the first and only studio especially constructed for the program. While the overall new studio was larger, it accommodated only 120 seats. Ellie Frankel continued as musical director until 1967, when Joe Harnell, an accomplished musician, composer, and bandleader took over the position until 1973. Harnell was followed by Frank Hunter, and the show ended with Joe Massimino in that role.

During much of its time on the air, the show remained strong in ratings, consistently finishing among the most popular daytime television shows nearly every season. Douglas took the success lightly. He made a surprise visit in 1976 to the set of &quot;Match Game&quot;, a competing program that managed to score higher ratings than &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; during the mid-1970s. Douglas wanted to congratulate host Gene Rayburn on making his game show the #1 daytime TV program.

The show&#x27;s run spanned 21 years and more than 4,000 episodes. In 1978, production of the show moved to CBS Television City in Hollywood, where it remained until the end of the show&#x27;s run in 1981.

In the fall of 1980, Westinghouse dropped Douglas, deciding to give younger entertainer John Davidson the show. Douglas&#x27; show continued, with Syndicast taking over the program&#x27;s distribution. However, in an effort to boost falling ratings during the show&#x27;s final season, a third of the staff was fired and the program was revamped with a traveling roadshow format, re-titled &quot;The Mike Douglas Entertainment Hour&quot;. The format change did not help, and Douglas&#x27; show was canceled mid-year during the 1981–82 season. The final episode aired on November 30, 1981.

<text>Rosa glauca (syn. &quot;Rosa rubrifolia&quot;), the red-leaved rose or redleaf rose, is a species of rose native to the mountains of central and southern Europe, from the Spanish Pyrenees east to Bulgaria, and north to Germany and Poland. It is also found as an introduced species as far north as Scandinavia and Finland.

==Description==
&quot;Rosa glauca&quot; is a deciduous shrub of sparsely bristled and thorny cinnamon-coloured arching canes tall. The leaves are distinctive, a glaucous blue-green to coppery or purplish, and covered with a waxy bloom; they are 5–10 cm long and have 5–9 leaflets. The fragile, clear pink flowers are 2.5–4 cm in diameter, and are produced in clusters of two to five. The fruit is a dark red globose hip 10–15 mm in diameter.

==Cultivation and uses==
This rose was not widely grown in gardens until the end of the 19th century. The flower petals fall off easily in the spray from watering hoses, as well as from wind and rain. The species is naturalised in northern Europe north of its native range, particularly in Scandinavia.

This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

A hybrid with &quot;Rosa rugosa&quot; has been given the cultivar name &#x27;Carmenetta&#x27;.

<text>Spencer House is a historic town house at 27 St James&#x27;s Place in the St James&#x27;s area of Westminster, Greater London, England. The house is Grade I listed on the National Heritage List for England.

==Early history==
The house was commissioned in 1756 by John Spencer (who later became the first Earl Spencer), as he required a large townhouse in London to augment his position and status. The architect he chose was John Vardy, who had studied under William Kent. Vardy is responsible for the facades of the mansion that we see today.

In 1758, James &quot;Athenian&quot; Stuart, who had studied the arcadian values of Ancient Greek architecture, replaced Vardy as the architect of the project. As a direct result of this, Spencer House was to have authentic Greek details in the internal decoration, and thus it became one of the first examples in London of the neoclassical style, which was to sweep the country.

As the home of successive Earls and Countesses Spencer, the staterooms of the house became a theatre for the pageant that was London high society. Members of the Spencer family occupied the mansion continuously until 1895, when the house was let out. The Spencers returned for a brief time during the first quarter of the 20th century, after which the house was let at various times as either a club or offices. During the Blitz of the Second World War, it was stripped of its few remaining authentic treasures, specially made furniture, and fireplaces.

==Recent history==

Spencer House remains in the ownership of the Earls Spencer, the current freeholder being Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer, brother of Diana, Princess of Wales. However, since the Second World War, the house has been continuously let out. In 1948 it was leased to Christie&#x27;s auctioneers, in 1956 to the British Oxygen Company, and in 1963 to the Economist Intelligence Unit.

On 25 December 1986, RIT Capital Partners, the family company of Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild, secured a 96-year lease (with an additional 24-year option) with an annual rent of £85,000.

In a restoration, the state rooms and garden were returned to their original appearance. The lease of Spencer House was valued at £35 million in the 2017 annual report of RIT Capital Partners.

Together with Lancaster House, Bridgewater House, Dudley House and Apsley House, Spencer House is one of the last of the many aristocratic townhouses which once adorned central London.

<text>Membership of the Royal Colleges of Physicians of the United Kingdom (MRCP(UK)) is a postgraduate medical diploma in the United Kingdom (UK). The examinations are run by the Federation of the Medical Royal Colleges – the Royal College of Physicians of London, the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, and the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow. The three Royal Colleges of Physicians share this common three part assessment in general medicine which consists of two written parts and one clinical examination. Examinations are held throughout the UK and in overseas centres.

Holders of the MRCP(UK) can subscribe as &quot;collegiate members&quot; to any or all of the three UK Royal Colleges of Physicians. Thus the MRCP(UK) qualification has replaced the former MRCP(Lon), MRCP(E), and MRCP(G) qualifications. (Similarly, the MRCS is also now intercollegiate.)

There is a separate MRCPI qualification, run by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, based in Dublin in the Republic of Ireland.

==History==
The three Royal Colleges of Physicians have been holding membership examinations for many years. In the London College the Censors, helped by other examiners, had the duty to carry out the assessment of candidates and advise the College. The MRCP (London) examination began in 1859 with a numerical marking system devised in 1893. In the late 1960s the need to have a single recognized membership examination throughout the United Kingdom was recognized. Such an examination made it unnecessary for junior doctors to enter several membership examinations and removed the suggestion that the standards of the examination at the three Colleges were different.

==Aims and content==
The exam incorporates both examination of the candidate&#x27;s knowledge of basic medical sciences as well as testing the clinical skills required for the diagnosis and management of disease. Changes to the exam in recent years have put more emphasis on communication skills and professionalism. Obtaining the &quot;MRCP(UK)&quot; is a prerequisite to anyone wishing to go on to a specialist training post as a Physician in the United Kingdom. Various companies, including the Royal Colleges themselves, have developed preparatory courses that focus on the nature of the questions and the required background knowledge.

In partnership with the relevant specialist societies, the three UK Royal Colleges have set up the MRCP Specialist Examinations Unit responsible for the organization of new knowledge based assessments. The ultimate objective is to ensure that NHS consultants have demonstrated their acquisition of sufficient knowledge in their chosen specialty to practice safely and competently. This will bring the assessment of physicians in training in the UK into line with those training in North America, where most specialist trainees sit a specialist examination as a further test of excellence, usually after having acquired certification in Internal Medicine.

==Parts==
The MRCP exam has three parts: 
MRCP Part 1 (written paper);

<text>The Very Group Limited is a multi-brand online retailer and financial services provider in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Its head offices are based in the Speke area of the city of Liverpool, England. The brand was established in November 2005 as a result of the merger of the former Littlewoods and Shop Direct companies. The retailer was known as Littlewoods Shop Direct Group until a corporate rebranding to Shop Direct Group in May 2008. In 2013, the company rebranded to Shop Direct, dropping the &#x27;group&#x27; from its name. Shop Direct rebranded themselves to The Very Group in 2020.

A business group trading via several digital department stores, The Very Group traces its roots to a variety of mail order companies in northern England, the football pools and mail order business founded by John Moores, as well as the Manchester-based home shopping business of Great Universal Stores. These companies were purchased by Sir David and Frederick Barclay in 2003, and a major business restructuring took place leading to a merger of two companies that had &quot;been arch rivals for the best part of 100 years&quot;.

Since the merger of what had been struggling businesses in 2005, ongoing restructuring and modernisation of the company has resulted in Shop Direct emerging as one of the largest online retailers in the UK. Its traditional paper-based and phone-in orders system has been superseded by electronic commerce technology.

The group is now amongst the largest online retailers in the UK, with annual sales of £2.13bn for the year to June 2024, and EBITDA up 8.4% to £267m

The group&#x27;s brands are Very.co.uk, Littlewoods.com, Very Exclusive and Very Ireland (rebranded from &#x27;Littlewoods Ireland&#x27; in July 2022). The former Shop Direct brands are Additions Direct, Abound, Choice, Great Universal, Isme, K&amp;Co, Kays, Marshall Ward and Woolworths. In 2009, The Very Group acquired the brand name of the failed Woolworths Group and re-established it as an online-only operation; this closed in 2015 and the Woolworths UK brand was sold in July 2021 to Woolworth Deutschland.

==History==

===Origins===

The Very Group traces its roots to a variety of independent mail order and retail companies in northern England, particularly Littlewoods, the pools and mail order business founded by John Moores, as well as the Manchester-based home shopping business of Great Universal Stores. Other businesses from this time that became part of Shop Direct included K&amp;Co (formerly Kays Catalogues).

Founded by John Moores and his brother Cecil in 1923, Littlewoods was initially a football pools company, which used its network of pools agents and printing company (founded in 1928) to establish itself as a catalogue retailer from 1932 onwards.

In November 2002, the Moores family sold Littlewoods to the Barclay brothers for £750 million.

Littlewoods also owned the Index chain of stores.

The home shopping/catalogues business of Argos and Homebase owner, GUS plc, ARG Equation (which included Great Universal, Kays, Choice and Marshall Ward) was de-merged and bought by the Barclay brothers in 2003, where it became Shop Direct.

===Merger: Littlewoods Shop Direct Group===

It was announced in March 2005 that part of the Index chain of catalogue shops was to be sold to GUS plc (then owner of Argos) and the remainder was to be closed.

In July 2005, Associated British Foods purchased the 120-branch Littlewoods retail chain on behalf of its retail subsidiary Primark for £409 million. Some of the stores were converted into branches of Primark, and the remainder were sold on to other retailers. The Littlewoods name disappeared from the British high street in March 2006.

Following these disposals, and clearance from the Competition Commission, the Littlewoods home shopping business was formally merged with that of Shop Direct (the former GUS plc home shopping business) in October 2005, to form the United Kingdom&#x27;s largest home shopping business. The merger was in reality effected in early 2004 when work started on a business optimisation programme, consolidating various business functions.

Following the merger, Littlewoods Shop Direct Group moved its headquarters from Manchester city centre to Skyways House in Speke, south Liverpool.

The then newly appointed chief executive Mark Newton-Jones said the merger had &quot;been the biggest challenge of all – taking two companies that [had] been arch rivals for the best part of 100 years and bringing them together. Not just from an operational point of view, but also two different business cultures&quot;.

===Post-merger===
In May 2008, Littlewoods Shop Direct Group announced it would change its corporate brand name to Shop Direct Group, to reflect the multi-branded nature of the business. In July 2008, Shop Direct completed its purchase of the Empire Stores brand name and customer base from mail order competitor Redcats.

In May 2008, Home Delivery Network, previously Shop Direct Group&#x27;s logistics division, was separated from the group and subsequently renamed Yodel.

With the demise of the Woolworths Group in January 2009, Shop Direct purchased rights to children&#x27;s clothing brand Ladybird along with the Woolworths trade name from the administrators. The takeover of the Woolworths brand by Shop Direct was announced on 2 February 2009, and the new online retailer began trading on 25 June that year. In 2015, the Woolworths.co.uk brand was closed, and in July 2021, the Woolworths UK brand was sold to Woolworth Deutschland.

At the start of 2009, Shop Direct predicted growth in online sales, with a spokesperson saying: &quot;We anticipate that 70 per cent of our sales will be online by 2010/11 and, therefore, the future of our business is online-led.&quot; It was confirmed in late 2009 that it was on track to achieve 70% of its sales via the internet by 2011. By the end of the 2012/13 financial year, this figure had reached 78%.

In 2013, the company rebranded to Shop Direct, dropping the &#x27;group&#x27; from its name.

On 27 October 2017 Shop Direct successfully placed its debut bond.

In 2019, Shop Direct rebranded to The Very Group.

In February 2024, The Very Group took a loan of £125 million from The Carlyle Group and UAE-based International Media Investments in return for a degree of control of The Very Group. The group&#x27;s finances had been hurt by increasing interest rates, and the directors stated the loan should provide working capital until at least June 2025. In March 2024, The Very Group auditors, Deloitte, announced they had resigned after stating they struggled to access &quot;appropriate and relevant information in respect of certain financing arrangements between companies in the wider group&quot;. Very Group&#x27;s ownership is spread across many different companies, some unaudited, with an ultimate offshore owner.

Today, it operates a &#x27;hero&#x27; own brand fashion label, V by Very, alongside Ladybird for children. Alongside the core retail business, Shop Direct owns and operates a financial services business, formerly known as Everyday Financial Solutions, and now known as Shop Direct Financial Services.

In July 2022, the company announced the appointment of Lionel Desclée as its new group chief executive, replacing Henry Birch who held the position for over four years. 

==Locations==

The Very Group&#x27;s headquarters is Skyways House, a £31 million renovated aircraft hangar, situated in Speke, south Liverpool.

Order processing for The Very Group is primarily undertaken at the &#x27;Skygate&#x27; facility based in Kegworth, Derby with a smaller number of large items distributed from Bryn Lane, Wrexham. The old distribution centre at Shaw, Oldham comprised six former cotton mills Lily 1, Lily 2, Newby, Rutland, Ash and Dee. Subsequently, Rutland, Ash and Dee mills have been demolished and replaced with new purpose made buildings. It is one of Europe&#x27;s largest retail distribution centres. The Very Group processes returns at Raven Mill in Chadderton.

On 9 May 2006, the company announced the closure of three warehouses in Eccles, Wigan and Worcester. These closures have taken place, with all operations being transferred to their Shaw and Crompton site. Around 1,200 jobs were lost from the closures, but further jobs were created at the Shaw National Distribution Centre.

In 2016, The Very Group launched a training, conferencing and wellbeing facility for its Liverpool HQ staff, calling the building &quot;The Cube&quot;.

==Relocation of distribution business==

In Spring 2018, The Very Group announced that 2,000 jobs were at risk from redundancy as the company intends to close three distribution centres and move their distribution business to the East Midlands by 2020.

<doc id="1034674" wikidata="Q352653" url="?curid=1034674" title="Herrlee G. Creel">
<text>Herrlee Glessner Creel (January 19, 1905June 1, 1994) was an American Sinologist and philosopher who specialized in Chinese philosophy and history, and a professor of Chinese at the University of Chicago for nearly 40 years. A prolific author, on his retirement Creel was praised by his colleagues as an innovative pioneer on early Chinese civilization, and as one who could write for specialists and general public with cogency, lucidity, and grace. Creel was known for his early work on Confucius, the history of Chinese thought, and his unsurpassed study and translation of Shen Buhai.

==Early years==
Herrlee G. Creel was born on January 19, 1905, in Chicago, Illinois, taking up journalism after high school. He attended the University of Chicago as an undergraduate, studying in philosophy and the history of religion, graduating with a Ph.B. degree in 1926. He become interested in the teachings of Confucius after graduation, studying Chinese with a Chinese student. He continued on at Chicago as a graduate student studying Chinese philosophy, earning an AM in 1927, followed by a PhD in 1929 with a dissertation entitled &quot;Sinism: A Study of the Evolution of the Chinese World-view&quot;.

He began his postdoctoral career as an assistant professor of psychology at Lombard College from 1929 to 1930. He was awarded fellowships by the American Council of Learned Societies (1930–1933), the Harvard-Yenching Institute (1931–1935) and the Rockefeller Foundation (1936, 1945 –1946). With the support of Harvard-Yenching he visited China from 1932-1935 to study inscriptions with the Chinese scholar Liu Jie (1901-1977). In 1936 he accepted a post at the University of Chicago, where he was an instructor in Chinese history and language until he was appointed assistant professor of early Chinese literature and institutions in 1937.

Creel was one of the founders of the university&#x27;s Far Eastern studies program in the 1930s and had a major role in building its Far Eastern Library. He ordered some 5,000 books a year from dealers in China, then, in 1939, with support from the Rockefeller Foundation, he returned to China, then in the grips of the Second Sino-Japanese War, with the city of Beiping (Beijing) occupied by the Japanese Army. He bought more than 75,000 volumes for the library, especially those dealing with the pre-modern period.

Creel was promoted to the rank of associate professor in 1941 and full Professor in 1949. He served as a Lieutenant Colonel of military intelligence in the United States Army from 1943 to 1945 during the Second World War. He remained as a professor until 1964, when he became the Martin A. Ryerson Distinguished Service Professor of Chinese History until 1974.

==Societies and publishing ==
Creel was a member of the Committee on Chinese Studies of the American Council of Learned Societies, a member of its Committee on Far Eastern Studies, and the President of the American Oriental Society. He was also a member of the Association for Asian Studies as well as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

The most influential of Creel’s books include &quot;The Birth of China&quot; (1936), the first detailed account of the significance of the archaeological excavations at Anyang, which quickly attracted global interest; &quot;Studies in Early Chinese Culture&quot; (1937) which was an influential collection of monographic essays; &quot;Literary Chinese by the Inductive Method, vols. I–III&quot; (1938–52), a groundbreaking and controversial attempt to teach literary Chinese through carefully glossed excerpts of standard classical texts; &quot;Newspaper Chinese by the Inductive Method&quot; (1943), an effort to apply identical pedagogical techniques to the analysis of Chinese newspapers; &quot;Confucius, the Man and the Myth&quot; (1949), a critical analysis of the philosopher Confucius; &quot;Chinese Thought from Confucius to Mao Tse-tung&quot; (1953), a survey of Chinese thought; &quot;The Origins of Statecraft in China, Vol. 1: The Western Chou Empire&quot; (University of Chicago Press, 1970), a judicial account of the polity of the Western Zhou dynasty; &quot;What is Taoism? and Other Studies in Chinese Cultural History&quot; (University of Chicago Press, 1970) and &quot;Shen Pu-hai: A Chinese Political Philosophy of the Fourth Century B.C.&quot; (1974), a monograph on Shen Buhai, an early Chinese specialist in administrative technique.

==Style and legacy==
Creel was especially known for &quot;Confucius: The Man and the Myth&quot; (1949), which argued that Confucius had been misunderstood because legend had obscured the facts of his life and his ideas. Creel held that Confucius was a reformer and an individualist, as well as a democratic and revolutionary teacher.

From the start of his career in the 1930s, Creel was an outspoken proponent of the theory that Chinese characters are inherently ideographic in nature. He was opposed by sinologists Peter A. Boodberg and Paul Pelliot, who believed that phonetic principles played a large role in the early history of Chinese characters. The scholar John DeFrancis objected to Creel&#x27;s position, which he called &quot;the ideographic myth.&quot; Creel in the 1930s set out to correct the widespread idea that a phonological system of writing, such as an alphabet, which represents sounds, was superior to an ideographic one, such as Chinese. The debate has continued many decades later without either side being able to discredit the other.

Creel&#x27;s language textbooks were controversial because they introduced students to Chinese using classical texts, not the modern language.

Creel died at his home in Palos Park, Illinois, after a long illness, on June 1, 1994, at the age of 89.

<text>Joseph Cordiano (born October 30, 1957) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1985 to 2006 who represented the riding of Downsview. He served as a cabinet minister in the government of Dalton McGuinty.

==Background==
Cordiano was born in Toronto, Ontario, the son of Italian immigrants. He was educated at the University of Toronto and the University of Toledo in Ohio, graduating from the latter with a Master&#x27;s Degree in Business Administration. He was the owner and General Manager of Cash Rolls of Canada.

==Politics==
Cordiano was elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1985, defeating incumbent New Democrat Odoardo Di Santo by 221 votes in the Toronto riding of Downsview. He was re-elected by a greater margin in the redistributed riding of Lawrence in the provincial election of 1987. He served as Parliamentary Assistant to several ministers.

The Liberals were upset by the NDP in the provincial election of 1990 and Cordiano faced a difficult challenge from NDP candidate Shalom Schachter, winning by 11,786 votes to 10,179. He subsequently emerged as a prominent voice for the provincial Liberal Party within Toronto. The provincial election of 1995 saw Cordiano win his riding by a comfortable margin — the provincial swing was to the Progressive Conservative Party, but the PCs did not have enough support in Lawrence to seriously compete for the riding.

When Lyn McLeod resigned as Liberal leader in 1996, Cordiano announced his candidacy to succeed her. At first, many saw him as the leading challenger to frontrunner Gerard Kennedy, who was regarded as representing the left-wing of the party. Cordiano, in turn, was seen by many as representing the party&#x27;s establishment, while holding some right-wing leanings.

The leadership convention was held in November 1996. Cordiano finished second to Kennedy on the first ballot, but was unable to build upon his position in later counts. Dalton McGuinty tied him for second place on the third ballot, and overtook him on the fourth. Cordiano supported McGuinty on the fifth ballot, and was thereby largely responsible for McGuinty&#x27;s victory over Kennedy for the party&#x27;s leadership. Cordiano was subsequently named as Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and held this position until 1998. His replacement by Gerry Phillips as Deputy Leader angered some in the province&#x27;s Italian community.

Cordiano and Kennedy were again rivals in the provincial election of 1999, this time for the Liberal nomination in the redistributed riding of York South—Weston. Kennedy was convinced by the party leadership to run elsewhere, and Cordiano won an easy victory in the election which followed. The Progressive Conservatives were re-elected in the general election, however, and Cordiano remained on the opposition benches. In 2000, he was appointed opposition critic for financial institutions.

The Liberals won the provincial election of 2003, and Cordiano won another easy victory in York South—Weston. On October 23, 2003, Cordiano was named Minister for Economic Development and Trade.

Cordiano was the architect behind the Ontario Automotive Investment Strategy that saw the province leverage over $7 billion in new automotive investment into the province. Under his term as Minister, Ontario replaced Michigan as the largest auto-producing jurisdiction in North America. He was also responsible for the securing a new Toyota assembly plant in Woodstock, Ontario. This was Ontario&#x27;s first new assembly plant in over 20 years. Jurisdictions across the United States were in competition for this highly sought after investment that created 1,300 direct jobs and thousands more in related sectors.

Cordiano resigned from the cabinet and the legislature on September 18, 2006, citing a desire to spend more time with his family.

===Electoral record===

==Later life==
After leaving politics, Cordiano became President of Dominus Construction Group and Principal of Cityzen Development Group. He has remained engaged in public life as a board member of West Park Healthcentre. He currently sits as an advisory board member of the Mowat Centre at the University of Toronto. Cordiano is also a member of the Board of Advisors of MobileBits.

<doc id="1034693" wikidata="Q470334" url="?curid=1034693" title="Euclides da Cunha">
<text>Euclides da Cunha (, January 20, 1866 – August 15, 1909) was a Brazilian journalist, sociologist and engineer. His most important work is &quot;Os Sertões&quot; (&quot;Rebellion in the Backlands&quot;), a non-fictional account of the military expeditions promoted by the Brazilian government against the rebellious village of Canudos, known as the War of Canudos.

This book was a favorite of Robert Lowell, who ranked it above Tolstoy. Jorge Luis Borges also commented on it in his short story &quot;Three Versions of Judas&quot;. The book was translated into English by Samuel Putnam and published by the University of Chicago Press in 1944. It remains in print. He was heavily influenced by Naturalism and its Darwinian proponents. &quot;Os Sertões&quot; characterised the coast of Brazil as a chain of civilisations while the interior remained more primitive. He occupied the 7th chair of the Brazilian Academy of Letters from 1903 until his death in 1909.

He served as inspiration for the character of &quot;The Journalist&quot; in Mario Vargas Llosa&#x27;s &quot;The War of the End of the World&quot;.

==Timeline==

Euclides da Cunha was born January 20, 1866, in Cantagalo, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where he lived until he was three years old. His grandparents were of Portuguese origin. He attended in 1885 Escola Politécnica, and after he attended Escola Militar da Praia Vermelha, a military school in Rio, beginning in 1886. He was expelled from the military school in 1888, due to his participation in an act of protest during a visit of the Brazilian War Minister, , who was a member of the last Conservative cabinet of the Brazilian Empire. He was readmitted to the Escola Militar in 1889. He was admitted to the Brazilian War School (&quot;Escola de Guerra&quot;) in 1891 . He was discharged from the Army in 1896 in order to dedicate himself to studying civil engineering.

In 1897 he accompanied the Army in the Campanha de Canudos, against a rebellious group of peasants under the leadership of Antonio Conselheiro. Between 7 August and 1 October, he was in the Sertão (&quot;backland&quot;), as war correspondent for the &quot;O Estado de S. Paulo&quot; newspaper. In 1903 he was elected to the &quot;Academia Brasileira de Letras&quot; (Brazilian Academy of Letters) and the Instituto Histórico e Geográfico, the Historical and Geographic Institute In 1904, Da Cunha was employed on a joint Brazilian-Peruvian expedition to determine a border between the countries. This expedition travelled down the Purus River, which was heavily exploited by rubber tappers. During this time, Da Cunha produced his essay &quot;Os Caucheros&quot; which provides an architype for the &quot;cauchero&quot; or rubber tapper. According to historian Susanna B. Hecht, who wrote &quot;The Scramble for the Amazon and the Lost Paradise of Euclides Da Cunha&quot;, Carlos Scharff, a successful rubber baron on the Purus River, was &quot;the model for the Caucho King in Da Cunha&#x27;s essay Os Caucheiros&quot;. In 1909 Da Cunha was admitted as chairman and professor of Logic at the Colégio Pedro II, a public secondary school in Rio.

Euclides da Cunha married Ana Emília Ribeiro, daughter of major Sólon Ribeiro, in 1890. The couple had five children. Ana Emília had an affair with Dilermando de Assis, a young Army lieutenant. On August 15, 1909, finding about his wife&#x27;s affair, da Cunha went to Assis&#x27; house to kill him. He shot Assis and his brother Dinorah, failing to kill either. Assis shot da Cunha when Euclides had already left his house, and the writer was killed. According to Hecht&#x27;s account, there was doubt whether Dilermando murdered a fleeing man who had run out of bullets, or whether Euclides still was a threat to Dilermando (which would make the murder self-defense.) The jury decided for the latter scenario and acquitted Dilermando. Da Cunha was 43 years old.

<text>Melfort (2016 population 5,992) is a city in Saskatchewan, Canada, located approximately southeast of Prince Albert, northeast of Saskatoon and north of Regina.

Melfort became Saskatchewan&#x27;s 12th city in 1980. Melfort was formerly called the &quot;City of Northern Lights&quot; due to the frequency with which the aurora borealis appears. However, in 2016, Melfort became &quot;Play Melfort&quot; due to its vast recreation programs and facilities.

The city is bordered by the Rural Municipality of Star City No. 428 and the Rural Municipality of Flett&#x27;s Springs No. 429. It is also the administrative headquarters of the Peter Chapman First Nation band government.

<text>Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), formerly Theater High Altitude Area Defense, is an American anti-ballistic missile defense system designed to intercept and destroy short-, medium-, and intermediate-range ballistic missiles in their terminal phase (descent or reentry). The THAAD interceptor carries no warhead, instead relying on its kinetic energy of impact to destroy the incoming missile. THAAD was developed after the experience of Iraq&#x27;s Scud missile attacks during the Gulf War in 1991.

Originally a United States Army program, THAAD has come under the umbrella of the Missile Defense Agency. The Navy has a similar program, the sea-based Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System, which also has a land component (&quot;Aegis Ashore&quot;). THAAD was originally scheduled for deployment in 2012, but initial deployment took place in May 2008. THAAD has been deployed in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Israel, Romania, and South Korea.

On 17 January 2022, THAAD made its first operational interception of an incoming hostile medium-range ballistic missile in the UAE.

== Development ==
The THAAD missile defense concept was proposed in 1987, with a formal request for proposals submitted to industry in 1991. The THAAD program benefited from results of previous missile defense efforts like High Endoatmospheric Defense Interceptor (HEDI) and the Kinetic Kill Vehicle Integrated Technology Experiment (KITE). In September 1992, the US Army selected Lockheed, now Lockheed Martin, as the prime contractor for THAAD development. 

Prior to the development of a physical prototype, the Aero-Optical Effect (AOE) software code was developed to validate the intended operational profile of Lockheed&#x27;s proposed design. In April 1995, the first THAAD flight test occurred , with all flight tests in the demonstration-validation (DEM-VAL) program phase occurring at White Sands Missile Range. The first six intercept attempts missed the target (Flights 4–9). The first successful intercepts were conducted on 10 June 1999 and 2 August 1999, against Hera missiles.

The vulnerability and lethality analyses of THAAD have been conducted by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL). The vulnerability assessment for the THAAD featured an evaluation of the effects of major electromagnetic elements. This included EM interference, EM radiation operations, EM radiation hazards, EM pulse, electrostatic discharge, and lightning effects on components of the THAAD system.

The ARL assessments were designed to determine the THAAD system&#x27;s growth potential given its tactical design as well as provide survivability analysis against threats such as conventional weapons, chemical weapons, and electronic warfare countermeasures. The data collected from the analyses were used to develop trajectory models for targets and missile as well as target trajectories using infrared scene generation of infrared countermeasures (IRCMs).

The THAAD system is being designed, built, and integrated by Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control acting as prime contractor. Key subcontractors include Raytheon, Boeing, Aerojet Rocketdyne, Honeywell, BAE Systems, Oshkosh Defense, and MiltonCAT.

=== Engineering and manufacturing ===
In June 2000, Lockheed won the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract to turn the design into a mobile tactical army fire unit. In 2006, flight tests of this system resumed with missile characterization and full system tests at White Sands Missile Range, then moved to the Pacific Missile Range Facility. The Interceptor was led through development and initial production by Tory Bruno, who later became the CEO of United Launch Alliance.

=== THAAD-ER ===
Lockheed is pushing for funding for the development of an extended-range (ER) version of the THAAD, to counter maturing threats posed by hypersonic glide vehicles that adversaries may deploy, namely the Chinese WU-14, to penetrate the gap between low- and high-altitude missile defenses. The company performed static fire trials of a modified THAAD booster in 2006 and continued to fund the project until 2008. The current -diameter single-stage booster design would be expanded to a first stage for greater range with a second &quot;kick stage&quot;, to close the distance to the target and provide improved velocity at burnout and more lateral movement during an engagement. 

Although the kill vehicle would not need redesign, the ground-based launcher would have only five missiles instead of eight. As of 2020, THAAD-ER is only an industry concept, but Lockheed believes that the Missile Defense Agency will show interest because of the weapons under development by potential adversaries. If funding for the THAAD-ER begins in 2020, a system could be produced by 2024 to provide an interim capability against a rudimentary hypersonic threat. The Pentagon is researching whether other technologies like directed energy weapons and railguns are better solutions for missile defense. These are expected to become available in the mid to late 2020s.
== Production ==
Sometimes called Kinetic Kill technology, the THAAD missile destroys missiles by colliding with them, using hit-to-kill technology, like the MIM-104 Patriot PAC-3, although the PAC-3 also contains a small explosive warhead. This is unlike the Patriot PAC-2, which carried only an explosive warhead detonated using a proximity fuze. Although the actual figures are classified, THAAD missiles have an estimated range of 125 miles (200 km), and can reach an altitude of 93 miles (150 km). A THAAD battery consists of at least six launcher vehicles, each equipped with eight missiles, with two mobile tactical operations centers (TOCs) and the AN/TPY-2 ground-based radar (GBR). 

The U.S. Army plans to field at least six THAAD batteries, at a purchase cost of US$800 million per battery. In September 2018, the MDA planned to deliver 52 more interceptors to the Army. In June 2020 the Senate Armed Services Committee draft of the FY2021 DoD budget allocated funding for the eighth THAAD battery.

The THAAD missile is manufactured at a Lockheed Martin facility near Troy, Alabama. The facility performs final integration, assembly and testing of the THAAD missile. The THAAD Radar is an X-Band active electronically scanned array Radar developed and built by Raytheon at its Andover, Massachusetts Integrated Air Defense Facility. The THAAD radar and a variant developed as a forward sensor for ICBM missile defense, the Forward-Based X-Band – Transportable (FBX-T) radar, were assigned a common designator, AN/TPY-2, in late 2006/early 2007. The THAAD radar can interoperate with Aegis and Patriot systems, in a 3-layer antimissile defense.

=== First units equipped (FUE) ===
On 28 May 2008, the U.S. Army activated Alpha Battery, 4th Air Defense Artillery Regiment (A-4), 11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade at Fort Bliss, Texas. Battery A-4 is part of the 32nd Army Air &amp; Missile Defense Command. At the time, the battery had 24 THAAD interceptors, three THAAD launchers based on the M1120 HEMTT Load Handling System, a THAAD Fire Control and a THAAD radar. Full fielding began in 2009. In October 2009, the U.S. Army and the Missile Defense Agency activated the second Terminal High Altitude Area Defense Battery, Alpha Battery, 2nd Air Defense Artillery Regiment (A-2), at Fort Bliss.

In August 2012, Lockheed received a $150 million contract from the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) to produce THAAD Weapon System launchers and fire control and communications equipment for the U.S. Army. The contract included 12 launchers, two fire control and communications units, and support equipment. The contract provided six launchers for THAAD Battery 5 and an additional three launchers each to Batteries 1 and 2. These deliveries will bring all batteries to the standard six launcher configuration.

===General missile defense plans===
In May 2017, the Pentagon proposed spending $7.9 billion in its FY 2018 budget on missile defense, which includes THAAD interceptors and Patriot interceptors, along with $1.5 billion for Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) against intercontinental ballistic missiles.

==Deployments==
===Israel===
In 2012, the U.S. AN/TPY-2 early missile warning radar station on Mt. Keren in the Negev desert was the only active foreign military installation in Israel.

In March 2019, Bravo Battery, 2nd Air Defense Artillery Regiment (B-2 THAAD), 11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade was deployed at Nevatim Airbase during a joint US-Israeli drill, after which it moved to an undisclosed location in the Negev desert in southern Israel. The X-Band radar system, which is part of the THAAD system, has been deployed at Nevatim since 2008.

On 13 October 2024, President Biden directed Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to authorize the deployment of a THAAD battery to Israel to &quot;help bolster Israel&#x27;s air defenses following Iran&#x27;s unprecedented attacks against Israel on April 13 and again on October 1.&quot;

On 27 December 2024, a THAAD battery conducted a successful combat interception of a ballistic missile fired from Yemen.

===Romania===
In 2019, while the Aegis Ashore at NSF Deveselu was being upgraded, B Battery, 62nd Air Defense Artillery Regiment (B-62 THAAD), was emplaced in NSF Deveselu, Romania during the interim.

===South Korea===


In October 2013, the South Korean military asked the Pentagon to provide information on the THAAD system concerning prices and capabilities as part of efforts to strengthen defenses against North Korean ballistic missiles. However, South Korean Park Geun-hye administration decided it will develop its own indigenous long-range surface-to-air missile instead of buying the THAAD. South Korean Defense Ministry officials previously requested information on the THAAD, as well as other missile interceptors like the Israeli Arrow 3, with the intention of researching systems for domestic technology development rather than for purchase. Officials did however state that American deployment of the THAAD system would help in countering North Korean missile threats. In May 2014, the Pentagon revealed it was studying sites to base THAAD batteries in South Korea.

The deployment was opposed by China and Russia. In February 2016, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that having THAAD in South Korea would &quot;shatter the regional strategic balance&quot; and that the system exceeded South Korea&#x27;s need. In 2017, a Chinese military official said that the deployment had a negative influence on &quot;bilateral military ties and mutual trust&quot; with the United States. Western experts say that the range of THAAD&#x27;s radar and interceptors should not pose a threat to China, and the U.S. has had similar capabilities in Taiwan and Japan for years. 

Chinese officials believe that its location in South Korea would allow THAAD&#x27;s radar to detect Chinese missile launches from behind during their boost phase and differentiate between decoys and warheads, sharing information with the rest of the U.S.-led network. This would erode China&#x27;s nuclear deterrence, which has a much smaller stockpile compared to the United States and Russia. Missile tests in China usually pointed away from Korea, but that trajectory may also need to be reversed in order to minimize detection by THAAD. Chinese officials asked South Korea to downgrade the radar of the missile defence system, but no adjustments were made.

In July 2016, American and South Korean military officials announced the deployment of THAAD system in South Korea, following ballistic missile and nuclear tests by North Korea. Each THAAD unit consists of six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors, a fire control and communications unit, and an AN/TPY-2 radar. Seongju County in North Gyeongsang Province was chosen as a THAAD site, partly because it is out of range of North Korean rocket artillery along the DMZ. This sparked protests from Seongju County residents, who feared that radiation emitted by the AN/TPY-2 radar would impact their health, and damage the region&#x27;s famed oriental melon crop. On 30 September 2016, the U.S. and South Korea announced that THAAD would be relocated to the Lotte Skyhill Seongju Country Club, farther from the town&#x27;s main residential areas and higher in elevation, to alleviate concerns.

On 6 March 2017, two THAAD launcher trucks arrived by air transport at Osan Air Base South Korea, for a deployment. Earlier that day, North Korea had launched 4 missiles. A Reuters article stated that with the THAAD defense system, a North Korean missile barrage would still pose a threat to South Korea, while an article in the International Journal of Space Politics &amp; Policy said that South Korean forces already possess Patriot systems for point defense and Aegis destroyers capable of stopping ballistic missiles that may come from the north, in a three-layer antimissile defense for South Korea. On 16 March 2017, a THAAD radar arrived in South Korea. The THAAD system is kept at Osan Air Base until the site where the system is due to be deployed is prepared, with an expected ready date of June 2017. Osan Air Base has blast-hardened command posts with 3 levels of blast doors.

By 25 April 2017, six trailers carrying the THAAD radar, interceptor launchers, communications, and support equipment entered the Seongju site. On 30 April 2017, it was reported that South Korea would bear the cost of the land and facilities for THAAD, while the US will pay for operating it. On 2 May 2017, Moon Sang-gyun, with the South Korean Defense Ministry, and Col. Robert Manning III, a spokesman for the U.S. military, announced that the THAAD system in Seongju is operational and &quot;has the ability to intercept North Korean missiles and defend South Korea.&quot; 

It was reported that the system would not reach its full operational potential until later in 2017, when additional elements of the system were onsite. On 7 June 2017 President Moon Jae-in suspended further THAAD deployment pending a review, after discovering four additional launchers had entered South Korea without the defense ministry informing him. The 35th Air Defense Artillery Brigade (United States) has integrated THAAD into its layered defense on the Korean Peninsula, denoted Combined Task Force Defender, composed of both US and ROK personnel.

Even in the face of a North Korean ICBM test on 4 July 2017, which newly threatens Alaska, a Kodiak, Alaska-based THAAD interceptor test (FTT-18) against a simulated attack by an Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile had long been planned. FTT-18 was successfully completed by Battery A-2 THAAD (Battery A, 2nd Air Defense Artillery Regiment, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) of the 11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade (United States) on 11 July 2017. The soldiers used the procedures of an actual combat scenario and were not aware of the IRBM&#x27;s launch time.

Also in 2017 another Kodiak launch of a THAAD interceptor was scheduled in July, in preparation for a possible ICBM test by North Korea. On 28 July 2017 North Korea launched a test ICBM capable of reaching Los Angeles. In response, President Moon Jae-in called for deployment of the four remaining THAAD launchers which were put on hold when he came to power. 

Lee Jong-kul, of South Korean President Moon Jae-in&#x27;s Democratic Party of Korea stated &quot;The nuclear and missile capabilities of North Korea…have been upgraded to pose serious threats; the international cooperation system to keep the North in check has been nullified...&quot;, citing tensions over the U.S. deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system in South Korea. The Atlantic Council, in the June 2017 memorandum &quot;Eliminating the Growing Threat Posed by North Korean Nuclear Weapons&quot; to President Trump, recommended a checklist of actions, including the following declarations to North Korea.
* No use of WMDs, or it will result in a unified Korea under Seoul after the North&#x27;s assured destruction.
* No export of nuclear equipment or fissile material; it will be intercepted, and the US will respond.
* No missile or missile test aimed at ROK (South Korea), Japan, or the US; it can then be shot down or pre-empted.

On 30 July 2017, a Kodiak-sited THAAD interceptor shot down an MRBM which launched over the Pacific Ocean, the 15th successful test. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) director emphasized the data collection from the intercept, which enhances the modelling and scenario simulation capabilities of the MDA. John Schilling estimates the current accuracy of the North&#x27;s Hwasong-14 as poor at the mooted ranges which threaten US cities, which would require more testing to prove its accuracy.

In August 2017, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewed the anti-missile options that are available to counter a planned salvo of four Hwasong-12 missiles, were they to be launched in mid-August 2017 from the North, and aimed to land just outside the territorial waters of Guam, a distance of , flying at altitudes exceeding , in a flight of 1,065 seconds (18 minutes). These options for the missile defense of South Korea include &quot;sea-based, Patriots and THAAD&quot; according to General John E. Hyten, commander of U.S. Strategic Command.

On 2 September 2017, the North Korean news agency KCNA released a photograph of an elongated payload, intended to fit in the warhead of one of its missiles. On 3 September 2017 both Japan&#x27;s Foreign Ministry and the South Korean Joint Chiefs announced the detection of a magnitude 6.3 seismic event, centered near Punggye-ri, which is North Korea&#x27;s underground nuclear test site. Japan&#x27;s Foreign Ministry has concluded that the event was the North&#x27;s sixth nuclear test. 

Choe Sang-hun of the &quot;New York Times&quot; reports that the test was a major embarrassment for China&#x27;s Paramount leader Xi Jinping, who was hosting a BRICS summit (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) in Xiamen, China. Cheng Xiaohe, an expert on North Korea at China&#x27;s Renmin University, said the timing of the test appears to be deliberate. China&#x27;s Foreign Ministry urged the North to &quot;stop taking wrong actions&quot;, and agreed that further UN actions are needed to resolve the impending crisis. By creating a thermonuclear-capable payload for at least one of its missiles, the North has created a need for THAAD, which is capable of intercepting ICBM threats at the lower altitudes and ranges estimated for a Hwasong-14 ICBM subjected to the load of a heavier warhead needed to carry a thermonuclear weapon.

In October 2017, Battery D, 2nd Air Defense Artillery Regiment, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, reflagged with the 35th Air Defense Artillery Brigade in preparation for a permanent change of station to South Korea. In the interim before THAAD D-2&#x27;s permanent transfer to South Korea with their families, THAAD Battery A-4 will deploy to South Korea.

The South Korean decision to deploy THAAD to protect itself against North Korea caused backlash and retaliation measures from China.
On 30 October 2017, South Korea and China agreed to normalize relations, previously damaged due to the THAAD deployment.

===Turkey===
According to U.S. officials the AN/TPY-2 radar was deployed at Turkey&#x27;s Kürecik Air Force base. The radar was activated in January 2012.

===United Arab Emirates===
In December 2011, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) signed a deal to purchase the missile defense system. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) graduated its first two THAAD unit classes at Fort Bliss in 2015 and 2016. Its first live-fire exercises with Patriot missiles took place in 2014.

On 17 January 2022, THAAD made its first real-world intercept against an incoming Houthi ballistic missile in the UAE.

===United States===
====Hawaii====

In June 2009, the United States deployed a THAAD unit to Hawaii, along with the SBX sea-based radar, to defend against a possible North Korean launch targeting the archipelago.

====Guam====
In April 2013, the United States declared that Alpha Battery, 4th Air Defense Artillery Regiment (A-4), would be deployed to Guam to defend against a possible North Korean IRBM attack targeting the island. In March 2014, Alpha Battery, 2nd ADA RGT (A-2), did a change of responsibility with A-4 and took over the Defense of Guam Mission. After a successful 12-month deployment by A-4, Delta 2 (D-2) took its place for a 12-month deployment. In 2018-2019 Echo Battery, 3rd ADA Regiment (E-3) deployed to Guam.

====Wake Island====
In November 2015, a THAAD system was a key component of &quot;Campaign Fierce Sentry&quot; Flight Test Operational-02 Event 2 (FTO-02 E2), a complex $230 million missile defense system test event conducted at Wake Island and the surrounding ocean areas. The objective was to test the ability of the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense and THAAD Weapon Systems to defeat a raid of three near-simultaneous air and missile targets, consisting of one medium-range ballistic missile, one short-range ballistic missile and one cruise missile target. During the test, a THAAD system on Wake Island detected and destroyed a short-range target simulating a short-range ballistic missile that was launched by parachute ejected from a C-17 transport aircraft. At the same time, the THAAD system and the USS &quot;John Paul Jones&quot; guided missile destroyer both launched missiles to intercept a medium-range ballistic missile, launched by parachute from a second C-17.

===Future deployments: firm orders and possible plans===

====Europe and the Middle East====
By March 2016, Army Space and Missile Defense Command was considering THAAD deployments to Europe with EUCOM and the Middle East with CENTCOM.

====Japan====
In November 2015, Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said he would consider the U.S. deploying the THAAD in Japan to counter the threat of North Korean ballistic missiles. By October 2016, Japan was considering procuring either THAAD or Aegis Ashore to add a new missile defense layer. In May 2017 it was reported that Japan government officials now favor the Aegis Ashore system as it comes with a wider coverage area, which would mean fewer units needed to protect Japan, and it is also cheaper.

At the Center for a New American Security 2017 conference, citing publicly available sources and simulations of strikes against US bases in Asia, two Navy Fellows, Commanders Shugart and Gonzalez, USN noted that two more Patriot batteries, two more Aegis ships, and five more THAAD batteries would counter China&#x27;s published SRBM (short-range) and MRBM (medium-range) capabilities against Japan.

Russia has opposed the missile acquisitions and fears that the US will have access to the management of Aegis Ashore missile defense complexes after their deployment in Japan. &quot;We do not know of any cases anywhere in the world when the United States deployed its weapons and transferred control over them to the country in whose territory it all happened. I very much doubt that they will make an exception and in this case,&quot; concluded the Russian Foreign Minister.

In 2020, Japan suspended plans to acquire the Aegis Ashore system. The Japanese government said that they were concerned about environmental issues caused by the system dropping spent boosters. Local citizens of the areas chosen to place the system also protested the acquisition, saying that such placement would guarantee strikes on their homes during wartime. the Japanese government had not made it clear whether or not they would re-evaluate purchasing THAAD systems.

====Oman====
In May 2013, Oman announced a deal for the acquisition of the THAAD air defense system. However, a sale has not been announced.

====Saudi Arabia====
In October 2017, the US reached a deal to provide Saudi Arabia with THAAD, in a deal worth $15 billion. The deal included seven fire units, each with a Raytheon AN/TPY-2 radar, two mobile tactical stations (with two spares for a total of 16), and six launchers (with two spares for a total of 44), and 360 interceptor missiles.

====Taiwan====
In 2017, a Hong Kong–based media report claimed that THAAD could be deployed in Taiwan to intercept People&#x27;s Republic of China missiles. However, Taiwan&#x27;s Foreign Minister, David Lee, said he was unaware of any talks with the US about possible deployment. Local military experts said that it was neither necessary nor affordable for Taiwan to deploy THAAD because China is threatening Taiwan with short-range missiles, whereas THAAD is designed to shoot down medium and long-range missiles. 

In March 2017, the Minister of National Defense, Feng Shih-kuan, said that he was firmly opposed to the deployment of a THAAD system in Taiwan. Feng&#x27;s deputy minister, Cheng De-mei, during a Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee Q&amp;A session held in April 2017, said that Taiwan did not need a THAAD system in the short term because its US-made phased-array radar system at Hsinchu County’s Leshan base was on par with the THAAD system in terms of detection capability; this was described as being &quot;in slight contrast with Minister of National Defense Feng Shih-kuan&#x27;s last month.&quot; 

Freddy Lim urged the ministry during the same Q&amp;A session &quot;to procure whatever is necessary to ensure the nation’s defense capabilities, which could not be compromised due to China&#x27;s pressure.&quot; Taiwan&#x27;s existing early warning system, built by the manufacturer of the THAAD radar, can serve to counter China&#x27;s missile launches.

<doc id="1034699" wikidata="Q1937401" url="?curid=1034699" title="Constitutive equation">
<text>In physics and engineering, a constitutive equation or constitutive relation is a relation between two or more physical quantities (especially kinetic quantities as related to kinematic quantities) that is specific to a material or substance or field, and approximates its response to external stimuli, usually as applied fields or forces. They are combined with other equations governing physical laws to solve physical problems; for example in fluid mechanics the flow of a fluid in a pipe, in solid state physics the response of a crystal to an electric field, or in structural analysis, the connection between applied stresses or loads to strains or deformations.

Some constitutive equations are simply phenomenological; others are derived from first principles. A common approximate constitutive equation frequently is expressed as a simple proportionality using a parameter taken to be a property of the material, such as electrical conductivity or a spring constant. However, it is often necessary to account for the directional dependence of the material, and the scalar parameter is generalized to a tensor. Constitutive relations are also modified to account for the rate of response of materials and their non-linear behavior. See the article Linear response function.

==Mechanical properties of matter==

The first constitutive equation (constitutive law) was developed by Robert Hooke and is known as Hooke&#x27;s law. It deals with the case of linear elastic materials. Following this discovery, this type of equation, often called a &quot;stress-strain relation&quot; in this example, but also called a &quot;constitutive assumption&quot; or an &quot;equation of state&quot; was commonly used. Walter Noll advanced the use of constitutive equations, clarifying their classification and the role of invariance requirements, constraints, and definitions of terms
like &quot;material&quot;, &quot;isotropic&quot;, &quot;aeolotropic&quot;, etc. The class of &quot;constitutive relations&quot; of the form &quot;stress rate = f (velocity gradient, stress, density)&quot; was the subject of Walter Noll&#x27;s dissertation in 1954 under Clifford Truesdell. 

In modern condensed matter physics, the constitutive equation plays a major role. See Linear constitutive equations and Nonlinear correlation functions.

===Definitions===
===Deformation of solids===

====Friction====

Friction is a complicated phenomenon. Macroscopically, the friction force &quot;F&quot; at the interface of two materials can be modelled as proportional to the reaction force &quot;R&quot; at a point of contact between two interfaces through a dimensionless coefficient of friction &quot;μ&quot;f, which depends on the pair of materials:

:formula_1

This can be applied to static friction (friction preventing two stationary objects from slipping on their own), kinetic friction (friction between two objects scraping/sliding past each other), or rolling (frictional force which prevents slipping but causes a torque to exert on a round object).

====Stress and strain====

The stress-strain constitutive relation for linear materials is commonly known as Hooke&#x27;s law. In its simplest form, the law defines the spring constant (or elasticity constant) &quot;k&quot; in a scalar equation, stating the tensile/compressive force is proportional to the extended (or contracted) displacement &quot;x&quot;:

:formula_2

meaning the material responds linearly. Equivalently, in terms of the stress &quot;σ&quot;, Young&#x27;s modulus &quot;E&quot;, and strain &quot;ε&quot; (dimensionless):

:formula_3

In general, forces which deform solids can be normal to a surface of the material (normal forces), or tangential (shear forces), this can be described mathematically using the stress tensor:

:formula_4

where &quot;C&quot; is the elasticity tensor and &quot;S&quot; is the compliance tensor.

====Solid-state deformation====

Several classes of deformation in elastic materials are the following:
; Plastic: The applied force induces non-recoverable deformation in the material when the stress (or elastic strain) reaches a critical magnitude, called the yield point.
; Elastic: The material recovers its initial shape after deformation.
:; Viscoelastic: If the time-dependent resistive contributions are large, and cannot be neglected. Rubbers and plastics have this property, and certainly do not satisfy Hooke&#x27;s law. In fact, elastic hysteresis occurs.
:; Anelastic: If the material is close to elastic, but the applied force induces additional time-dependent resistive forces (i.e. depend on rate of change of extension/compression, in addition to the extension/compression). Metals and ceramics have this characteristic, but it is usually negligible, although not so much when heating due to friction occurs (such as vibrations or shear stresses in machines).
:; Hyperelastic: The applied force induces displacements in the material following a strain energy density function.

====Collisions====

The relative speed of separation &quot;v&quot;separation of an object A after a collision with another object B is related to the relative speed of approach &quot;v&quot;approach by the coefficient of restitution, defined by Newton&#x27;s experimental impact law:

:&lt;math&gt; e = \frac

<text>Humboldt is a city in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada. It is located 113 km east of Saskatoon at the junction of Highway 5 and Highway 20. The city is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Humboldt No. 370.

== History ==
Named after German explorer Alexander von Humboldt, Humboldt began as a telegraph station located on the Carlton Trail, a wagon route used in the early days of Western Canada as a route from Fort Garry (Winnipeg) to Fort Edmonton. The name &quot;Humboldt&quot; was approved in 1875 for a site in the North West Territories along the Canadian Pacific Telegraph Line at which a repair station was built (8 km south-west of the present city site). Built in 1878, the Humboldt Telegraph Station played an integral part in communications for the developing West.

With the Métis uprising led by Louis Riel taking place at Batoche just 100 km northwest, Humboldt became the only communication link between Prime Minister John A. Macdonald and his forces in the West, thus a site of strategic significance. General Frederick Middleton arrived in April 1885 with 950 soldiers, established a garrison at the station, and used it as his base for scouting operations. At that time, the Humboldt station was crucial, since the telegraph line further west was periodically cut – so Humboldt was the last secure link to the East.

On May 1, 1885, Humboldt became the site of a large supply depot under Maj. Lt.-Colonel G. T. Denison of the Governor Generals&#x27; Body Guard. A combined force of approximately 460 men built an elaborate series of entrenchments, converting the station into a fortified military encampment to protect the supplies. The troops left Humboldt in July 1885. The area was also the site of the first stagecoach robbery in Western Canada. Parts of the Carlton Trail in the form of wagon tracks/ruts still exist in the Humboldt area.

Humboldt in its beginnings was primarily German Catholic. It became the largest settlement in the Territorial Abbey of Saint Peter-Muenster also called St. Peter&#x27;s Colony established by Benedictine monks from St John&#x27;s Abbey in Collegeville, Minnesota. Immigration to the area from both the Northern Plains states of the US and Germany was promoted by the German American Land Company. Many immigrants from the German Empire settled in areas in and around Humboldt such as Muenster, Fulda, Pilger, St Gregor and Englefeld. Immigrants from the Russian Empire who were ethnic Germans settled in the area west of Humboldt and south of the hamlet of Carmel.

After being established as a community, Humboldt became an important location in Saskatchewan previously known as the &quot;Heart of the Sure Crop District&quot; for its reliable growing weather, which led the town to become a centre for farming equipment and supply businesses.

===Humboldt Broncos bus crash===

On April 6, 2018, the Humboldt Broncos junior hockey team was involved in a serious bus crash. The bus was carrying the team to a playoff game in Nipawin, Saskatchewan, when it collided with a tractor trailer loaded with peat moss at an intersection known as Armley Corner, near Nipawin. Sixteen of the 30 people on board the bus died — the driver, the general manager/head coach, the assistant coach, a radio commentator, a volunteer, the club&#x27;s female trainer, and 10 players between the ages of 16 and 21. Fourteen players were injured, several of them seriously. News of the crash received significant national and international media coverage, and numerous dignitaries and politicians sent their condolences to the team and city. Two days after the crash, a vigil was held at the Elgar Petersen Arena in Humboldt, which was attended by over 5,000 people and televised nationally. Attendees included Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the Premier of Saskatchewan, and popular Canadian sports personalities Don Cherry and Ron MacLean. Humboldt Mayor Rob Muench called the tragedy a &quot;truly dark moment&quot; for the city.

==Climate==
Humboldt experiences a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) featuring long, cold winters and brief, warm summers. The region falls into the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 3a. It is a great distance from any large bodies of water, and thus lacks any moderating influences on its climate. The latitudinal difference of Saskatchewan can typically explain a 6–8 °C difference mean in annual temperatures across the province.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Humboldt was on 19 July 1941. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 12 January 1916.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Humboldt had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.



==Economy==
About 95% of all goods produced in the province directly depend on its basic resources (grains, livestock, oil and gas, potash, uranium and timber) and their refined products.

Wheat, canola, flax, peas, rye, lentils, canary seed and barley are mainly grown in the area. Beef cattle production, pork production – as well as other livestock – are significant for the community. With many farmers in the area, agricultural-related businesses were formed. Some services offered are in trucking and financial management, finance, business services, wholesale trade, transportation, etc. Humboldt is in the heart of potash country with many people employed in the mines near the city. The manufacturing community represented in the &quot;Iron Triangle&quot; also employs a large number of people in the city and surrounding district.

==Attractions==

Humboldt has a number of heritage buildings listed on the Canadian Register of Historic Places. They include the Canadian National Railways (Canadian Northern Railway) Station (built in 1905), a Post Office (built in 1911–1912), the Humboldt Provincial Court House (built in 1914–1920). and the Humboldt Water Tower (built in 1914) has been renovated with a spiral staircase and a circular observation platform on top.

The Humboldt Post Office is a National Historic Site of Canada (built in 1911–1912). It houses the Humboldt and District Museum and Gallery. Across the street is the Humboldt and District Art Gallery in the old Merchant Bank Building.

Marysburg Assumption Church is located north of Humboldt.
Mount Carmel Shrine is located west and St. Peter&#x27;s Abbey and St. Peter&#x27;s Cathedral are east of the city in Muenster.

The Humboldt Murals located in the town centre depict historic scenes.

===Festivals===
*The Summer Sizzler is held in late-June of each year. The event features a midway, demolition derby, cabaret, slo-pitch tournament, tractor pull, Sizzler Strut Marathon and live on-stage entertainment. On the opening day, there is a parade through downtown and a pancake breakfast at Centennial Park.
*Canada Day celebrations occur every year on July 1 concluding with fireworks at the Uniplex.
*The Humboldt StreetFest is held in mid-August and is organized by the Humboldt Downtown Business Improvement District.

<text>Liverpool Philharmonic Hall is a concert hall in Hope Street, in Liverpool, England. It is the home of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Society and is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. It is not the original concert hall on the present site; its predecessor was destroyed by fire in 1933 and the present hall was opened in 1939.

==Original hall==

The Liverpool Philharmonic Society was founded in 1840 but initially did not have a permanent concert hall. In 1844 the Liverpool architect John Cunningham was appointed to prepare plans for a hall. The initial requirement was for a &quot;concert room&quot; holding an audience of 1,500 which would cost at least £4,000 (equivalent to £ in ). Later that year the requirement was increased to a &quot;new concert hall&quot; to accommodate an audience of 2,100 and an orchestra of 250, plus &quot;refreshment and retiring rooms&quot;. Subscribers were invited to both buy shares and to purchase seats along the sides of the hall. The foundation stone was laid in 1846 and plans were made for Mendelssohn to write a cantata to be played in his presence at the opening of the hall. Mendelssohn did not live long enough to write the work.

The hall cost £30,000 (equivalent to £ in ) and was opened on 27 August 1849 accompanied by a week long festival. A correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot; reported that it was &quot;one of the finest and best adapted to music that I ever entered&quot;. The correspondent described the interior:
According to &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, the hall was universally agreed to have superb acoustics. A new organ was installed in the hall in 1930 at a cost of £2,000 (equivalent to £ in ).

The concert hall continued to be the home of the society until a fire broke out during the evening of 5 July 1933. Despite over 100 firemen attending the fire, the hall and new organ were damaged beyond repair. Over 10,000 people stood in the streets around the hall to view the fire. There were no serious injuries – the hall had closed for the day – though two boys fell into the basement while watching the fire and a number of onlookers fainted or collapsed. The next day the chairman of the Philharmonic Society announced that the hall would certainly be rebuilt, saying that until then they would need to find a replacement hall in which to play. The hall contained a number of autograph books dating from 1848; these were contained in a fire-proof safe and thus kept safe along with autographed pictures and some instruments, though the music library was lost. The building was insured, and the insurers paid £84,000 (equivalent to £ in ) for the hall itself, £9,503 (equivalent to £ in ) for other assets, and £6,000 (equivalent to £ in ) for the loss of two years&#x27; rental. The exact cause of the fire was not known; only that it originated in the roof of the building. Demolition work on the building&#x27;s ruins began the next day.

==Present hall==

===History===

The building of a new hall was delayed by the demands of Liverpool Corporation, which announced that it would not support the building of a venue suitable only as a concert hall. The corporation demanded an auditorium equally suited to cinema and theatre use. Controversy ensued with vocal opposition to the corporation&#x27;s stance led by the doyen of British conductors, Sir Henry Wood. A compromise was reached and work began in June 1937.

Herbert J. Rowse was commissioned to design a new hall on the site of the previous hall. Rowse&#x27;s design was in Streamline Moderne style. It incorporated an organ built by the Liverpool firm of Rushworth and Dreaper with a console which can be lowered from the stage. The hall was officially opened on 19 June 1939, and inaugurated the next day with a concert conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham. &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; commented, &quot;The magnificent compliment Liverpool has paid to the cause of music in England almost takes one&#x27;s breath away ... a hall of great size, noble proportions, and up-to-date appointments ... ready to take its place among the most eminent homes of musical culture in this or any other country&quot;. The final cost of the hall was a little over £120,000 (equivalent to £ in ) and the architect was paid £6,869 (equivalent to £ in ). An extension was added to the rear of the hall which was completed in 1992, designed by Brock Carmichael Associates. A major refurbishment of the hall was carried out in 1995 at a cost of £10.3 million. This included the complete replacement of the fibrous plaster interior with concrete, carried out again by Brock Carmichael, working with the acoustic consultant firm Lawrence Kirkegaard Associates. A local violinist, John Frederick Clarke, who was part of the famed orchestra, and the other band members who died during the ship&#x27;s sinking in 1912 are all commemorated on a memorial plaque within Philharmonic Hall.

A further renovation, costing around £14 million, was completed in October 2015, primarily refurbishing the main concert hall and auditorium. The 2015 renovation also saw the introduction of a new performance space named the Music Room, which replaced the former Rodewald Suite as Liverpool Philharmonic&#x27;s secondary venue, with an increased capacity of between 180 and 250 people. The Music Room was formally opened to the public in a free open house event on 9 October 2015. 

===Architecture===
The hall is built with fawn-coloured facing bricks, and is mainly in three storeys. It has a symmetrical frontage with a canopied entrance flanked by semicircular stair turrets. Above the entrance are seven windows that are separated by piers surmounted by carved abstract motifs. Outside the hall and separated from it are two piers for the display of posters. The architectural historians Pollard and Pevsner and the author of the description in the &quot;National Heritage List for England&quot; agree that the design of the hall was influenced by the Dutch architect W. M. Dudok.

The windows above the canopy contain glass etched by Hector Whistler. Glass doors panels by Whistler, originally from the building, and depicting musical instruments in art deco style, were featured on the BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; in March 2015. Thirteen Pilkington glass panels had been purchased from a market in France by a Liverpool dealer, who expressed an interest in donating some to local museums. Inside the entrance to the hall is a copper memorial to the musicians of the by J. A. Hodel, and on the landings are gilded reliefs of Apollo by Edmund C. Thompson. The interior of the auditorium is &quot;sensuously curved&quot;. On the walls on each side are incised female figures in art deco style that represent &quot;musical moods&quot;, also by Thompson. On the back wall above the platform was a kinetic structure, called &quot;Adagio&quot;, designed by Marianne Forrest in 1995; however this was moved to the nearby Harold Cohen Library at the University of Liverpool in 2016.

The hall contains a 3-manual pipe organ built by Rushworth and Dreaper, with a console on a lifting platform to store the console beneath the stage when not in use, and a Walturdaw rising cinema screen which is often played up with a musical interlude by the Hall&#x27;s resident organist Dave Nicholas.

==Current use==
The hall stages over 250 events each year, of which more than 60 are concerts of classical music. The main hall has a capacity of 1,700 with smaller events taking place in the Music Room, Green Room and 1840 Room. The other shows include music of all genres (including international artists such as Sir Cliff Richard, Bryan Ferry, Brian Wilson, Kraftwerk and Gilbert O&#x27;Sullivan), comedians, and films shown on the Walturdaw screen. Tours of the hall are arranged, and the hall can he hired for corporate or private events, including weddings.

<text>Cantagalo (), formerly spelled Cantagallo, is a city located in the east-central area of Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. The population is 20,168 (2020 est.) in an area of 749 km2. Its elevation is .

==History==
Colonization of Cantagalo began in 1755, when Portuguese nobleman Manoel Henriques, Duke of Terso and a clandestine gold miner, left the state of Minas Gerais in search of unexplored riches. Henriques and his group erected a settlement on a small tributary of the Parahyba approximately northwest of Rio and began exploring along the local rivers. It was originally known as after the nearby Macacu River.

By 1784, the settlement had grown to accommodate approximately 200 houses. This growth caught the attention of the Portuguese rulers of Brazil, who had a monopoly over gold exploration in the colony. By order of the Viceroy Luiz de Vasconcelos e Souza, several expeditions were sent in search of Henriques and his group. The town&#x27;s current name (Portuguese for &quot;rooster crow&quot;) was inspired by the circumstances of his capture. A troop was about to return to their camp after a day of searching in vain around the woods, when a soldier heard the crowing of a rooster nearby and decided to further explore the area. One of Henriques&#x27;s men was found in a clearing in the woods and, in exchange for his release, revealed the whereabouts of the rest of the group. Henriques was deported to Africa in dishonour.

By 1786, the settlement&#x27;s name had been officially changed from Sertões de Macacu to Cantagalo. In 1814, Cantagalo was officially recognized by Emperor Pedro I as a municipality and in October 1857, was officially elevated to the category of city. By the mid-19th century, the area&#x27;s gold was played out and the settlement came to depend on agriculture. Corn, coffee, and sugarcane plantations covered several acres of highly fertile land.

Before the First World War, Cantagallo was considered a rich fruit- and coffee-producing district and was connected to Rio via a 100-mile-long eponymous railway.

Nowadays, the city&#x27;s economic activities still revolve around agriculture, with the exploration of granite and calcareous rock for the cement industry also playing a strong role. Some of the largest cement manufacturers in Brazil have facilities in Cantagalo.

==Notable residents==
Financial journalist Jose Carlos Rodrigues was the son of a coffee planter of Cantagallo, born here in 1844.
Writer Euclides da Cunha was born here on January 15, 1886; a city district is named Euclidelândia in his honour.

<doc id="1034709" wikidata="Q3784846" url="?curid=1034709" title="Earthsuit">
<text>Earthsuit was a New Orleans–based Christian rock band formed in 1995. The band consisted of guitarist Dave Rumsey, keyboardist/vocalist Paul Meany, bassist Roy Mitchell, drummer David &quot;Hutch&quot; Hutchison, and vocalist Adam LaClave. Earthsuit&#x27;s sound was primarily rock, but also incorporated elements of hip-hop, electronica, reggae, soul, and experimental music.

The group recorded several independent EPs and played primarily in their New Orleans area before becoming noticed by Sparrow Records at a concert in 1999. The ensuing record deal saw the band&#x27;s only commercial release, a critically acclaimed album entitled &quot;Kaleidoscope Superior&quot;, in 2000. Shortly after, the band left Sparrow and drifted out of the public eye. A final album, entitled &quot;The Rise of Modern Simulation&quot; was independently released before the group disbanded in 2003. Many of the band members continue to play together and collaborate in various bands, namely Mutemath and Club of the Sons.

==Biography==
Earthsuit began in 1995 as a collaboration between Adam LaClave and Paul Meany, who began composing music together after being introduced at a church in New Orleans. In an interview with Family Christian Stores, Meany explained that a sermon was the inspiration for the band&#x27;s name: &quot;...This man was preaching about how humans are really spirit beings encased in fleshly bodies. The term &quot;earth suit&quot; came up. At the time we liked it, and we took it.&quot; The two regularly performed at Café Joel, a small coffeehouse their church had started where Meany was music director. These performances helped cultivate their unique sound and introduced them to future band member David Rumsey.

In 1997 they released a self-titled EP, which is sometimes called the &quot;Headless Clown EP&quot; due to its album cover. The record featured an early version of &quot;One Time&quot; (of which they later made a music video) as well as portions of live performances where Earthsuit covered Roberta Flack&#x27;s &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot;, albeit with re-written lyrics. Rumsey helped produce the EP and played guitar; however, the official band lineup only comprised LaClave and Meany. Shortly after, Rumsey officially joined along with bassist Roy Mitchell, another Café Joel regular. The band played and ministered in their hometown and did not tour much. In 1998, the band recorded and released a second EP, entitled &quot;Noise for Your Eyes&quot;. The EP included a remix of &quot;One Time&quot; and early song demos, which were interspersed with short clips of live performances. Drummer David Hutchison joined the band after they met him through a friend. In 1999, Earthsuit performed two sets at the Cornerstone Festival, one in a label showcase and the other opening for P.O.D. on the main stage. This garnered the attention of several major Christian labels, and the band subsequently signed to Sparrow Records.

The band began working with Prince producer David Leonard on their debut record, which excited Meany: &quot;[Sparrow] loved what we were doing musically, and they wanted to find the producer who would capitalize on that.&quot; &quot;Kaleidoscope Superior&quot; was released on June 20, 2000, and elicited positive reviews from critics. It also received a Dove Award nomination and experienced some success on Christian radio stations. Christian rock peers Rebecca St. James and dc Talk members, Kevin Max and Michael Tait, expressed excitement over the record. The same year, Earthsuit embarked on a tour called Festival Con Dios with other Christian bands, such as the Elms, PAX 217, and Switchfoot. The following year saw the band embark on their &quot;Do You Feel The Distortion&quot; tour with Ill Harmonics and The Benjamin Gate.

Despite critical reception, &quot;Kaleidoscope Superior&quot; would remain the band&#x27;s only commercial release; they were soon dropped from Sparrow&#x27;s lineup due to &quot;creative differences and marketing conundrums&quot;. Earthsuit disappeared from the public eye and began posting on a website about a new independent album. In September 2001, Hutchison left the band so he could spend more time with his family. Rumors began circling that the band would break up. In 2003, Earthsuit revealed they were disbanding and released their last record, &quot;The Rise of Modern Simulation&quot;. The final collection featured six original studio songs and ten bonus tracks, including a live remix of &quot;Against the Grain&quot;, practice sessions of concert material, and covers of various songs. The album could only be purchased on the internet. Meany would later state &quot;most people didn&#x27;t care when [they] broke up&quot;.

Shortly after Earthsuit&#x27;s break up, Meany began working with drummer Darren King in a production team called &quot;The Digitals&quot;. The name later changed to &quot;Math&quot; while the group helped produce music for Christian music stalwart TobyMac. The band recruited guitarist Greg Hill and changed their name to Mutemath.
To accommodate new recordings, Meany and producer Tedd T started an independent label named Teleprompt Records. Their first release was an EP titled &quot;Reset&quot; in September 2004. Earthsuit alumnus Roy Mitchell joined the venture in 2005. Teleprompt later signed a distribution deal directly with Warner Bros. Records, allowing Mutemath to release a full-length self-titled album on September 26, 2006.
Adam LaClave formed two bands, Macrosick and Club of the Sons. Macrosick has released only an independent CD titled &quot;demodisk&quot;; the Hurricane Katrina disaster of 2005 forced the band members to go on hiatus. LaClave then turned his attention towards Club of the Sons with friend and bassist Jonathan Allen. They released an EP called &quot;The Roughs&quot; in spring 2007 and an album entitled &quot;Young Quanta&quot; on July 7, 2009.

== Musical style and influences ==
Earthsuit music was primarily rock, but also possessed strong hip-hop, electronica, reggae, soul, and experimental elements. Their sound had sometimes been compared to The Police, while Meany&#x27;s rapping had been likened to the Beastie Boys. Adam LaClave stated the differing musical tastes of the band helped cultivate their sound: &quot;Each one of us is really into a lot of different things ... it helps make our sound because you can hear all kinds of things&quot;. Live performances were characterized by sunglasses, futuristic costumes, and energetic showmanship. Many bands have influenced Earthsuit&#x27;s style; the group has performed covers of songs by Basement Jaxx, Black Sheep, Kraftwerk, and Talking Heads. They have also utilized samples by DJ Shadow and The Verve.

Adam LaClave and Paul Meany were the primary songwriters for Earthsuit. As Christians, the two wrote lyrics that often communicated a Christian message. For example, the song &quot;Said the Sun&quot; is an allegory about God telling Christians to be carriers of light. &quot;Whitehorse&quot; was written to present a different view of the return of Jesus, as LaClave stated in an interview, &quot;Most people, when they hear the term &quot;white horse,&quot; think of the analogy of Jesus coming back ... [We] wanted to bring a different meaning to it, because ... He comes to rescue us in our everyday life [too].&quot; The men&#x27;s lyrics also reflect experiences they have had. Meany once had a dream that inspired him to write &quot;Gummy Buffalo&quot;; he found himself in a candy store and squeezed a gummy buffalo whereupon he heard the melody for the song. Christianity Today has proposed the lyrics in &quot;Foreign&quot; may have been inspired by their departure from Sparrow Records. The lyrics read &quot;There&#x27;s no place in your world for me / I&#x27;ve been from sea to shining sea / And I can&#x27;t retain your policies, excuse me / If I&#x27;m just hanging around, I&#x27;m foreign.&quot;

<text>Theodore Hamm&#x27;s Brewing Company was an American brewing company established in 1865 in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Becoming the fifth largest brewery in the United States, Hamm&#x27;s expanded with additional breweries that were acquired in other cities, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Houston, and Baltimore.

==History==
The Theodore Hamm Brewing Company was established in 1865 when German immigrant Theodore Hamm (1825–1903) inherited the Excelsior Brewery from his friend and business associate, A. F. Keller, who had perished in California seeking his fortune in the gold fields. Unable to finance the venture himself, Keller had entered into a partnership with Hamm to secure funding. Upon Keller&#x27;s death, Hamm inherited the small brewery and flour mill in the east side wilderness of Saint Paul, Minnesota. Keller had constructed his brewery in 1860 over artesian wells in a section of the Phalen Creek valley in Saint Paul then known as Swede Hollow.

Hamm, a butcher by trade and local saloon owner, first hired Jacob Schmidt as a brewmaster. Schmidt remained with the company until the early 1880s, becoming a close family friend of the Hamms. Schmidt left the company after an argument over Louise Hamm&#x27;s disciplinary actions regarding Schmidt&#x27;s daughter, Marie. By 1884, Schmidt was a partner at the North Star Brewery not far from Hamm&#x27;s brewery. By 1899, he had established his own brewery on the site of the former Stalhmann Brewery site. In need of a new brewmaster, Hamm hired Christopher Figge, who started a tradition of three generations of Hamm&#x27;s brewmasters, with his son William and grandson William II eventually serving in the position. By the 1880s, the Theodore Hamm Brewing Company was reportedly the second largest in Minnesota.

During Prohibition, the company survived by producing soft drinks and other food products, enabling it to expand rapidly through acquisitions after the repeal of Prohibition in 1933. From 1933 until 1965, Hamm&#x27;s saw much success, becoming the fifth largest brewery in the nation by the 1950s; much of this can be attributed to William C. Figge Jr. taking over as president in 1951. Figge expanded the Hamm&#x27;s brand into a national entity with breweries in Saint Paul, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Baltimore, and Houston. The latter two were short-lived and closed soon after they opened. As the company celebrated its 100th anniversary, the family sold the brewery and left the brewing industry to focus on its real estate ventures.

==History of ownership==
In 1965, the company was acquired by Heublein. In 1973, Hamm&#x27;s was sold to a group of Hamm&#x27;s distributors which in turn sold it to the Olympia Brewing Company in 1975. In 1983, Pabst purchased Olympia—along with Hamm&#x27;s. It was at this time that the Saint Paul flagship brewery was traded to the Stroh Brewing Company; Stroh&#x27;s continued to operate the brewery until 1997. When it closed, the operation ended a 137-year brewing tradition on the site. Its buildings were shuttered, and subsequently vandalized, demolished, or left to decay. Miller Brewing acquired the brand from Pabst in 1999. Miller was later purchased by South African Breweries and the name was changed to SABMiller. Subsequently, SABMiller formed a joint venture combining their US and Puerto Rican assets with those of Molson Coors to form MillerCoors. In 2016, SABMiller sold its interests in MillerCoors to Molson Coors, who had been its partner in the joint venture, for around $12 billion. Molson Coors gained full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside of the US and Puerto Rico, and retained the rights to all of the brands that were in the MillerCoors portfolio for the US and Puerto Rico. Molson Coors now produces Hamm&#x27;s beers: Premium and Golden Draft.

==Breweries==

===Saint Paul===
The flagship brewery of the former Hamm&#x27;s empire was in Saint Paul. Brewing began on the site in 1860, when Andrew F. Keller established the Pittsburgh Excelsior Brewery. Keller, a friend of Theodore Hamm, planned for the two of them to travel to California for the &quot;second gold rush.&quot; Louise Hamm forbade her husband to leave her alone with three children in the wild frontier town of Saint Paul. Unbeknown to his wife, Hamm had staked all of his savings and mortgaged his beer garden to support Keller&#x27;s trip and property acquisition in California. As collateral, Keller gave the deed to his small brewery and flour mill, located on the east side of Saint Paul, to Hamm.

Upon Keller&#x27;s death in 1865, all of Hamm&#x27;s savings, homestead and stake were lost. Having lost his beer garden, Hamm moved his family into the brewery.

Through constant expansion and improvements, the brewery soon became the largest in the state. The most notable expansion was the state-of-the-art brew house, which was built in 1893. In 1897, the wash house and part of the bottling plant were built, both of which still stand. The brewery was in an almost constant state of expansion from 1933 until 1948. They added a new power house, bottling facilities, malt house, grain storage, stock houses, shipping docks, office space, garages, and more.

The brewery shut its doors in 1997 under the ownership of the Stroh Brewing Company. The property was sold to a real estate investor who in turn sold the southern half to the City of Saint Paul, including the original brew house. The city left these buildings to decay and crumble. The northern portion of the brewery today is mostly inhabited by various businesses, including a trapeze school. As of 2013, businesses have started to return to the historical southern portion of the brewery. The keg and wash house are currently home to Saint Paul Brewing. Stock House Number Three is home to Urban Organics, and the carpenter shop houses the 11 Wells Distillery. A sizable portion of the brewery remains abandoned, including the old brew house.

In December 2022, the City of Saint Paul announced it had tentatively selected JB Vang Partners, Inc. to redevelop the former Hamm&#x27;s Brewery Complex, the plans for which include affordable and market-rate housing, commercial space, a public plaza, and more.

===San Francisco===
In 1953, Hamm&#x27;s purchased its second brewery from the Rainier Brewing Company. Hamm&#x27;s opened its San Francisco brewery in 1954 at 1550 Bryant Street. Its 20-by-80 foot sign, was surmounted by a three-dimensional 13-foot beer-glass-shaped lighting sculpture on top, filling with &quot;beer&quot; and forming a &quot;head&quot;, all with lights. It appeared in the first Dirty Harry film and was a local landmark. The brewery closed in 1972. In the early 1980s, Suicide Club (secret society) used a jackhammer to &quot;take out the doors and open holes in the giant tanks and make living spaces&quot;, the beer vats were then first squatted and then rented out to punk rock bands. Known as &quot;The Vats&quot;, the brewery was a center of San Francisco punk rock culture with about 200 bands using individual vats as music studios. The building was renovated in the mid 1980s and converted into offices and showroom space.

===Los Angeles===
In 1957, Hamm&#x27;s purchased the former Acme Brewery on 49th street in Los Angeles, California. The brewery had been owned by the New York–based Rheingold Beer / Liebmann Breweries since 1954. The brewery was operated by Hamm&#x27;s until 1972.

===Baltimore===
In 1959, the Gunther Brewery of Baltimore, Maryland, was purchased. The decision to discontinue the Gunther brand turned much of the Baltimore population against Hamm&#x27;s. The brewery&#x27;s reputation was further tarnished by a frozen batch of beer that made its way to market. After a failed attempt to re-introduce the Gunther brand in 1963, the brewery was sold to the Schaefer Brewing Company of New York after only four years of operation.

===Houston===
A final attempt at expansion was made in 1963 with the purchase of the Gulf Brewing Company of Houston, Texas. The brewery had been founded in 1933 by Howard Hughes. This venture was more successful, but in 1967 the brewery suffered a fire. Heublein decided not to rebuild and sold off the property. The closing of the Houston brewery in 1967 marked the beginning of the end for Hamm&#x27;s bid to be a national brand. The breweries in San Francisco and Los Angeles were closed in the early 1970s.

==Products==

While Hamm&#x27;s is no longer an independent brewing company, it is still sold in select markets under the Hamm&#x27;s brand and label. The beer is brewed and sold by Molson Coors North America. Several Hamm&#x27;s beers have been produced by Molson Coors: Hamm&#x27;s Premium, the original pale lager; Hamm&#x27;s Golden Draft; and Hamm&#x27;s Special Light.

In August 2021, MolsonCoors announced it was discontinuing Hamm&#x27;s Special Light as part of a &quot;streamlining&quot; effort by the company.

==Advertising==
Hamm&#x27;s was well known for its advertising jingle and its mascot, the Hamm&#x27;s Beer bear.

===Jingle===
The original jingle, with lyrics by Nelle Richmond Eberhart and music by Charles Wakefield Cadman was derived from a 1909 art song entitled &quot;From The Land of Sky-Blue Water&quot;. It was first used on radio and later on television. It started with tom-tom drums, then a chorus intoned (partial lyrics):
&lt;poem&gt;
From the Land of Sky Blue Waters [(echo) Waters]
Comes the water best for brewing,
Hamm&#x27;s, the beer refreshing,
Hamm&#x27;s, the beer refreshing,
Hamm&#x27;s!&lt;/poem&gt;

Alternative wording on radio and TV adverts (circa 1950s):
&lt;poem&gt;
From, the Land of Sky Blue Waters – Hamm&#x27;s Beer,
From the land of pines, lofty balsams,
Comes the beer refreshing,
Hamm&#x27;s, the beer refreshing,
Hamm&#x27;s!&lt;/poem&gt;

===Hamm&#x27;s Bear===
The Hamm&#x27;s Beer bear (or the Hamm&#x27;s Bear) was a cartoon mascot used in television production and print advertisements for the beer. The animated character was the first of its kind in the beer industry. In a typical TV spot, the bear would dance around in a pastoral setting while the &quot;Land of Sky Blue Waters&quot; advertising jingle played in the background. In 1999, &quot;Advertising Age Magazine&quot; called the Hamm&#x27;s Bear the key element of one of the best ad campaigns in the last 100 years. A statue of the mascot was erected in a St. Paul, Minnesota in 2005.

====Creation====
&quot;Most agree that the character was born in 1952 at Freddie&#x27;s restaurant in Minneapolis at a meeting with Cleo Hovel, creative director for Campbell-Mithun, and Howard Swift, an animator who worked for the California TV production company Swift-Chaplin. Hovel usually gets the credit for drawing the bear on a napkin in response to the idea to add an animal character to the Sky Blue Waters campaign.&quot;

The Hamm&#x27;s ads were the first to use an animated character for a beer, although the perpetually mute character eventually only learned to speak one line: &quot;It bears repeating!&quot; The Hamm&#x27;s Bear was created by Patrick DesJarlait following an idea first sketched on a restaurant napkin in 1952. The resultant advertising campaign—launched in 1953—was produced by the Campbell Mithun Advertising Agency. The original idea for the mascot came from Cleo Hoval, an account representative with Campbell Mithun, who finally asked a business acquaintance, Ray Tollefson, to draw the bear after discarding other prior attempts by his own marketing co-workers. Cleo liked the bear that Ray drew. Tollefson eventually drew many scenes and humorous situations into which he could put the bear in the ongoing Hamm&#x27;s advertising campaign. He also created an in-house book for Campbell Mithun, &quot;How to Draw the Hamm&#x27;s Bear,&quot; since so many agency artists would have to be able to draw the Hamm&#x27;s Bear accurately. Larry LaBelle, Vice President, Director to Television Production at Campbell-Mithun, could draw the bear accurately and conceptualized many of the commercials. LaBelle also created and designed the &quot;Little Flame Girl&quot; for Minnegasco and Tollefson provided the finished art following LaBelle&#x27;s design and instructions. LaBelle also created the concept of &quot;Albert &amp; Stanley&quot; for Grain Belt Beer while the pair collaborated on the finished character designs.

====Use and public acceptance====
The Hamm&#x27;s Bear was featured on an endless array of signs, glassware, and promotional merchandise. Commercials featuring the klutzy cartoon bear with a bewildered but cheerful grin—often pictured in television ads tripping over canoes, logs, or its own feet—were considered an overwhelming success.

Although they were silly, the commercials were well written. The commercials were smarter and funnier than most non-advertising cartoons of the time. Each spot held genuine entertainment value for viewers (and had a miniature story-line containing a plot, some form of conflict, and usually a final resolution), guaranteeing TV audiences would pay attention. Also, the background use of actual imagery from Minnesota&#x27;s natural wilderness helped get across the product&#x27;s emphasis on natural and pure ingredients much more effectively than mere advertising copy could. The founder of Campbell Mithun, the ad agency that created the Hamm&#x27;s Bear, once said, &quot;We believe the legend of the Hamm&#x27;s bear, like that of Paul Bunyan, will grow greater and greater as time goes on.&quot;

Hamm&#x27;s went on to become one of the first companies to create a national pro-sports and college-sports branding campaign. According to Moira F. Harris&#x27; book, &quot;The Paws of Refreshment: The Story of Hamm&#x27;s Beer Advertising&quot;, Hamm&#x27;s claimed to be the biggest TV and sports radio beer sponsor in the country by 1964. The Hamm&#x27;s Bear ads were run in support not only of the Minnesota Twins and Vikings; but also of the Chicago Blackhawks, White Sox, Cubs and Bears; the Kansas City A&#x27;s; San Francisco Giants and 49ers; the Los Angeles Rams; Houston Oilers; Baltimore Orioles; Green Bay Packers; and Dallas Cowboys.

The Audit Research Bureau reported that nationwide, in 1965, the Hamm&#x27;s Bear mascot was the &quot;best liked&quot; advertisement. Considering that Hamm&#x27;s commercials only aired in 31 states, this is quite an accomplishment. The Hamm&#x27;s Bear mascot was the key element of the campaign which ranked 75th in the &quot;Best Ad Campaign of the 20th Century&quot; as named by &quot;Advertising Age Magazine&quot; in 1999. The character was so well known (and identified so closely with the state of Minnesota) that in 2000, the &quot;St. Paul Pioneer Press&quot; named the Hamm&#x27;s Bear as one of the &quot;150 Most Influential Minnesotans of the Past 150 Years&quot;.

By that time, however, the current parent company, Miller Brewing, had drastically reduced the bear&#x27;s use due to concerns it might be interpreted as an attempt to market beer to children (just as R.J. Reynolds Tobacco had recently been forced to discontinue its Joe Camel character for similar reasons).

===Legacy===
In 2002, to commemorate the bear&#x27;s 50th anniversary, a St. Paul–based group of Hamm&#x27;s memorabilia collectors, the Hamm&#x27;s Club, proposed erecting a six-foot granite statue of the bear near a waterfall named for William Hamm (a former company president), which is in Como Park. The statue was placed instead in the Seventh Street Mall in September 2005.

==In popular culture==
William Hamm Jr. was kidnapped in Saint Paul by the Barker-Karpis Gang in the 1930s. The subsequent investigation by the FBI employed the first attempt at raising latent fingerprints from paper ransom notes.

A portion of the Hamm&#x27;s Beer jingle was sung by The Three Stooges, Moe Howard, Larry Fine and Joe DeRita in the 1962 film, &quot;The Three Stooges in Orbit&quot;.

In the David Frizzell song &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Hire a Wino to Decorate Our Home&quot;, the wife mentions the Hamm&#x27;s Bear in the lyrics, referring to a Hamm&#x27;s Bear clock, used in many bars, i.e.: &quot;When the Hamm&#x27;s Bear says it&#x27;s closing time, you won&#x27;t have far to crawl&quot;.

In Episode 10/20 of M*A*S*H, &quot;Sons and Bowlers,&quot; B.J. Hunnicutt, engaged in a scam to trick a professional bowler into believing he has kidney problems that cause his urine to turn blue, hears the bowler screaming in the latrine and quotes from the Hamm&#x27;s jingle in an aside to Charles Emerson Winchester III, &quot;From the land of sky-blue waters ...&quot; . Actor Mike Farrell, who played B.J., appeared in a Hamm&#x27;s commercial where the bear showed him how to make the beer magically appear.

In gratitude for Edward H. Hamm Jr. financing the film &quot;God Bless America&quot;, filmmaker Bobcat Goldthwait got a tattoo of the Hamm&#x27;s Bear on his chest.

A Hamm&#x27;s delivery truck is clearly seen briefly in the 1967 film, &quot;The Graduate&quot; (at approximately 1:15:44).

In the 1974 film &quot;A Woman Under the Influence&quot;, the character played by Peter Falk shares a Hamm’s beer with his children in the back of a truck.

<text>The Royal Court Theatre is a theatre located at 1 Roe Street in Liverpool, England. The current Royal Court Theatre was opened on 17 October 1938, after fire destroyed its predecessor. It was rebuilt in Art Deco style and soon became Liverpool&#x27;s premier theatre. The interior of the building has a nautical theme, in line with Liverpool&#x27;s seafaring traditions. The design of the basement lounge was based on the Cunard liner &quot;Queen Mary&quot; until its conversion into the Studio space during renovations. There are three viewing levels within the main auditorium: the Stalls, the Grand Circle and the Balcony.

Although the Liverpool Blitz during the Second World War destroyed many of the buildings around it, the Royal Court itself remained intact. Throughout the war, many well-known artists performed here, including Ivor Novello, Margot Fonteyn, Margery Manners and John Gielgud. Richard Burton made his stage debut here and Judi Dench made her professional stage debut in September 1957. In the 1980s it became home to rock and pop concerts, hosting artists such as the Smiths, Slade, Kraftwerk, Tangerine Dream, Rage Against the Machine, R.E.M., Iron Maiden, David Bowie, Ozzy Osbourne, Roger Taylor, Brian May, U2, and George Michael. In 1990 the building was listed as Grade II, highlighting its major part of Liverpool&#x27;s heritage.

In 2005 Rawhide Comedy Club took ownership of the building. Following two years of stand-up comedy, with a break in 2006 to produce &quot;Brick Up The Mersey Tunnels&quot;, they began producing plays all year round in 2007. The theatre has produced more than 100 shows since 2007, including &quot;Council Depot Blues&quot;, &quot;The Royal&quot;, &quot;Mam! I&#x27;m &#x27;Ere&quot; and a sell out series of Christmas shows including &quot;Scouse Pacific&quot;, &quot;Little Scouse On The Prairie&quot;, &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide To Fazakerley&quot;, &quot;The Scouse Nativity&quot;, &quot;The Scouse Cinderella&quot; and &quot;The Scouse Snow White&quot;.

==History==

The site of the Royal Court Theatre was originally that of a water well constructed in the 12th century. A circus owner, John Cooke, bought the site in 1826 for his circuses, plays, operas and concerts, and it became known as &#x27;Cooke&#x27;s Royal Amphitheatre of Arts&#x27;. During this time Pablo Fanque, the black circus performer and proprietor immortalised in the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!&quot;, performed here as a part of William Batty&#x27;s circus. In 1881, the building was redesigned by Henry Sumner as a regular theatre and it was re-opened as the Royal Court.

In 1896 the theatre was taken over by Robert Arthur of Glasgow, who in 1897 put all his theatres into a limited company quoted on the Stock Exchanges, the Robert Arthur Theatres Ltd. In 1912, following Arthur&#x27;s bankruptcy, the shareholders appointed as chairman Michael Simons of the Theatre Royal, Glasgow, chairman and creator in 1895 of Howard &amp; Wyndham Ltd. The direction and programming of the theatre, embracing plays, musicals, revues, opera and pantomime, now passed to Howard &amp; Wyndham Ltd, chaired by Simons with its managing director Fred Wyndham, who would be followed in 1928 by A. Stewart Cruikshank after his King&#x27;s Theatre, Edinburgh had joined the Howard &amp; Wyndham group.

A fire destroyed the building in 1933. Five years after demolition, construction works began in March 1938 to ensure the theatre was rebuilt and reopened in October of the same year. The title deeds of the theatre changed to Howard &amp; Wyndham in 1941.

The current Royal Court Theatre was opened on 17 October 1938. It had been totally rebuilt in Art Deco style to the designs of architect James Bushell Hutchins; its splendor and grandeur made it Liverpool&#x27;s number one theatre. The interior of the building has a nautical theme, in line with Liverpool&#x27;s seafaring traditions. The design of the basement lounge is based on the Cunard liner &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, which had been launched on the Clyde two years before the 1938 reopening. There are three viewing levels within the main auditorium: the Stalls, the Grand Circle, and the Balcony.

Although the Liverpool Blitz during the Second World War destroyed many of the buildings around it, the Royal Court itself remained intact. Throughout the war, many well-known artists performed in the Royal Court, including Ivor Novello, Margot Fonteyn and John Gielgud. Richard Burton made his stage debut at the Royal Court in an Emlyn Williams production. The 22-year-old Judi Dench made her professional stage debut here in September 1957, playing Ophelia in an Old Vic production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;

In 1980, two former Liverpool taxi drivers took the Royal Court in a new direction, moving away from traditional plays and instead of transferring the focus to rock and pop concerts. Their first year ended promisingly and proved to be a successful strategy for the venue, which went on to play host to artists as internationally famous as Tangerine Dream, Rage Against the Machine, R.E.M., Iron Maiden, David Bowie, Ozzy Osbourne, Roger Taylor, Brian May, U2 and George Michael.

The music videos for &quot;Let It Go&quot;, &quot;High &#x27;n&#x27; Dry (Saturday Night)&quot;, and &quot;Bringin&#x27; On the Heartbreak&quot; by the British rock band Def Leppard were directed by Doug Smith and shot on 22 July 1981. The photo on the &quot;Let It Go&quot; single cover was taken from that shoot.

In 1983, rock group Slade performed their last live UK concert with the original lineup featuring Noddy Holder.

In 1990, the building was listed as Grade II, highlighting the fact that it is a major part of Liverpool&#x27;s heritage.

In 2005 Rawhide Comedy Club took ownership of the building. Following two years of stand-up comedy, with a break in 2006 to produce Brick Up The Mersey Tunnels, they began producing plays all year round in 2007.

==Present==

The stalls are now set out in a three-tier cabaret-style arrangement with tables and chairs and a bar at the rear of the stalls. The current capacity is 1,186 (Stalls 290 [cabaret,] Circle 403, Balcony 493). Audience members can dine before the show in the stalls seating.

Following two years of being the home to the Rawhide Comedy Club, the Royal Court made a move back to producing theatre in the summer of 2007 with the sell-out re-run of &quot;Brick Up the Mersey Tunnels&quot;.

Since then, the theatre has undergone extensive refurbishment which completed its third &#x27;Act&#x27; in January 2018.

In 2010 the theatre began their sell out Variety Lunch Club series which provides lunch, a cup of tea, a singer, and a comedian for £6. More than 1,200 people a month come to these Wednesday afternoon shows.

The theatre also offers free to access groups including a Community Choir and a Youth Theatre for young people aged 11 and up.

The theatre has produced shows such as Council Depot Blues, The Royal, Mam! I&#x27;m &#x27;Ere and best-selling Christmas show The Scouse Nativity.

Liverpool&#x27;s Royal Court became a National Portfolio Organisation and has been receiving Arts Council funding since April 2018. In 2018 it also launched Boisterous Theatre Company, Liverpool&#x27;s only company dedicated to promoting BAME talent.

The theatre has produced more than 100 shows since 2007, including Council Depot Blues, The Royal, Mam! I&#x27;m &#x27;Ere and a sell out series of Christmas shows including Scouse Pacific, Little Scouse On The Prairie, The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide To Fazakerley, The Scouse Nativity, The Scouse Cinderella, and The Scouse Snow White. For a full list of shows see below.

==Technical==
===Flying===

The counterweight fly system has recently been refurbished. There were originally in excess of 70 fly lines, however, this has been reduced to about half that number in order to increase the distance between bars.

The original brakes have now been removed. They screwed shut and could hinge open to completely release the rope.

===Lighting===
The lighting was controlled by a &#x27;Grandmaster&#x27; which was situated on a perch about 8 feet above the stage floor on Stage Right. This would have been operated by two people and was in operation until the 1980s. It was only disconnected from the power in June 2006.

The lighting is now controlled by a High End Systems Roadhog lighting desk and 3 Avolites Art 2000 48-way dimmers. It has an extensive lantern stock including ETC Source Four 750&#x27;s, Strand Cantata Fresnels and Martin Mac 500&#x27;s.

===Rigging===
FOH there is a 12 m A-type truss hung from 2 lodestar 1-ton motors. This is used for most of the FOH rigging. There are also truss booms either side of the stage, FOH.

=== Revolving Stage ===
The refurbishment saw the restoration of the original revolving stage, the biggest outside of London.

==Shows==
===Pantomime===
With no television and no cinema, Liverpool audiences of the late 19th century flocked to the theatre. Liverpool possessed no less than 26 theatres and 38 music halls. The main theatres towards the end of the century were the Prince Of Wales in Clayton Square (opened 1861) the Shakespeare Theatre off London Road (opened 1866) and the Royal Court Theatre.

The site of the Royal Court had been a theatre for many years. As Cookes Royal Amphitheatre of Arts, up to 4,000 people would gather to attend plays, operas, concerts and circus. In 1881 as ownership of the theatre changed, it was rebuilt and renamed The Royal Court Theatre. Along with the three other theatres it presented an annual pantomime.

The Victorian pantomime was not only the template for today&#x27;s show but very much a vehicle for music. The Poluski Brothers were among the stars who featured. Combining a mixture of music hall, comic opera and a large chunk of spectacle, the pantomime appealed to all levels of society. The first Royal Court pantomime, or &quot;annual&quot; as it was known, was Babes in the Wood. It is not clear whether this was a success or not, but no further pantomime was produced at the Court for fourteen years until 1895 with the presentation of Dick Whittington.

Three years later, Arthur Lawrence was appointed the theatre manager. Starting with Aladdin, it was Lawrence who put the Royal Court firmly in the centre of the panto map. The biggest music hall stars of the day would appear in the Court&#x27;s &quot;annual&quot;. George Robey, Harry Lauder, Little Hetty King as Aladdin Tich, the Three Sisters Levey, and the Poluski Brothers all helped to make the Royal Court&#x27;s pantomime among the most famous in Britain. With the ownership of the theatre passing to Howard &amp; Wyndhams Ltd at the turn of the century, the growth of pantomime blossomed.

Arthur Lawrence quoted in &quot;The Liverpudlian&quot;, November 1938:
In 1906, in Aladdin, I had Hetty King and [Happy Fanny Fields], together with Malcolm Scott and Harry Tate-some combination. I produced at the Court, in twenty-six years, twenty pantomimes. The 1906 panto was the biggest success. We averaged takings of just under £2,000 a week, and that in a theatre supposed to hold no more than about £275 at full capacity. Our pantomimes would run elsewhere for about five years, so Liverpool was thus a pantomime manufacturing centre. &#x27;Happy&#x27; Fanny Fields, They were all made here—scenery, dresses, jokes and music, and all. I may mention, also, that we had a stage unsurpassed for its equipment. Every kind of trap ever known on a stage was in being.

That pantomime Aladdin was repeated, with almost the same cast, at the Adelphi Theatre in London the following year. &quot;A chorus of over 100 Voices&quot; boasted the posters. A magazine was produced in Liverpool solely devoted to pantomimes.

[Fanny Fields] in Aladdin By the 1920s the death of Music Hall was underway, and the Royal Court panto mirrored its decline. Hetty King Gone were the stars with their own personal songs to be replaced by &quot;free&quot; songs that anyone could sing. The Royal Court panto ended, replaced each Christmas by musical comedy, or a visit by the D’Oyly Carte Opera Company.

Upon re-opening some years after its fire in 1938, its first Panto was Humpty Dumpty, starring Gene Gerrard, Bobbie Comber, the Tiller Girls, and a cast &quot;of Over 80&quot;. The consecutive run of pantomime was not to be, With another World War the Howard and Wyndham&#x27;s—Babes in the Wood spectacle of pantomime found itself replaced with the comedy The Eric Maschwitz revue, featuring a young Charles Hawtrey (of later Carry On Fame) performing female impersonations. The following year Vivien Leigh appeared in The Doctor&#x27;s Dilemma.

It was not until 1943, with the arrival of A. Stewart Cruickshank as managing director that pantomime returned, again starting with Babes In The Wood. By the 1960s television comedians and pop stars became the new stars of panto. In 1956, young heart throb Dickie Valentine took on the role of Aladdin. By the end of the fifties, facing stiff competition and dwindling audiences, the Royal Court Pantomime began a slow lingering death. In the Sixties occasional pantomimes (always Cinderella) were interspersed by Christmas shows by Ken Dodd, Dora Bryan, Frankie Vaughan, the Bachelors and the Black &amp; White Minstrels.

Howard &amp; Wyndham&#x27;s financial problems increased, and the Royal Court was offered to the City Council to purchase. They refused. An attempt to open the Court as a Bingo Hall in 1968 was abandoned after eight months. There was no Christmas show after Aladdin in 1975. An attempt to revive panto in 1981 with Snow White was not successful, and pantomimes were no longer performed at the Royal Court.

In 1997 the Neptune Theatre in Liverpool presented Aladdin at the Court. Following on their success at the Neptune the previous year with Sonia in Dick Whittington, they presented Aladdin starring Julie Goodyear as Mrs. Twankey, and Danny McCall as Aladdin. Since then the Royal Court pantomimes have been Cinderella (1998), Babes in the Wood (1999), Aladdin (2000) and Dick Whittington (2001).

Pantomime returned to the Royal Court in (2006) with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs starring Hollyoaks&#x27; Christina Bailey as Snow White.

<text>L.A. Story is a 1991 American satirical romantic comedy film written by and starring Steve Martin and directed by Mick Jackson. The plot follows a weatherman (Martin) trying to find love in Los Angeles. It was released on February 8, 1991, and received generally positive reviews from critics.

==Plot==
Harris K. Telemacher is a TV weatherman living in Los Angeles. He is in a dead-end relationship with his social-climbing girlfriend Trudi and feels his job requires him to be undignified and unintellectual, though he holds a Ph.D. in arts and humanities. He wants to find some meaning and magic in his life, having grown increasingly weary of what he sees as the rather shallow and superficial city of L.A., from overly pretentious coffee orders to bizarre shooting etiquette rules on the freeway. Furthermore, he spends his time roller-skating through art galleries with his friend Ariel, offering eccentric art reviews to acquaintances, remixing Shakespeare a lot, and otherwise seeking to escape his ordinary life.

At a luncheon with a group of friends, he meets Sara, a journalist from London, with whom he immediately becomes infatuated. Driving home that night, his car breaks down on the freeway. He notices that a freeway traffic condition sign seems to be displaying messages intended solely for him. It offers him cryptic advice on his love life throughout the movie.

He begins to fall for Sara, but she is conflicted because she has pledged to reconcile with her ex-husband, Roland. Feeling that a relationship with Sara is unlikely, Harris begins dating SanDeE*, a ditzy aspiring spokesmodel, whom he meets at a clothing store. After his first date with her, Harris discovers that Trudi has been cheating on him for three years with his agent. The discovery leads him to pursue his romantic interest in Sara. This is complicated by his new relationship with SanDeE* and by Sara&#x27;s feeling of obligation to Roland. By the conclusion, he has successfully wooed Sara, with some encouragement and advice from the sign.

==Cast==

* Steve Martin as Harris K. Telemacher
* Victoria Tennant as Sara McDowell
* Richard E. Grant as Roland Mackey
* Marilu Henner as Trudi
* Sarah Jessica Parker as SanDeE*
* Susan Forristal as Ariel
* Kevin Pollak as Frank Swan
* Sam McMurray as Morris Frost
* Patrick Stewart as Maitre d&#x27; at L&#x27;Idiot
* Iman as Cynthia

There are uncredited cameo appearances by Chevy Chase, Woody Harrelson, Paula Abdul, Martin Lawrence, Rick Moranis (this would be the fourth and final film in which Moranis appeared with Martin), and Terry Jones. John Lithgow and Scott Bakula filmed scenes—as a movie agent and Harris&#x27;s neighbor, respectively—that did not appear in the final cut (although references to Lithgow&#x27;s character remain in the freeway shootout and the &#x27;California Cuisine&#x27; lunch scenes). Martin and Tennant were real-life husband and wife at the time of the film&#x27;s production.

==Release==

===Box office===

&quot;L.A. Story&quot; was a box office success. The film earned $6.6 million during its opening weekend, and ended its theatrical run with a gross of $28 million.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 91% based on 44 reviews, with an average rating of 7.50/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;A romantic comedy that doubles as a love letter to the titular city, &quot;L.A. Story&quot; is Steve Martin at his silly, sweetly soulful best.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

In 2008, &quot;L.A. Story&quot; was voted by a group of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writers and editors as the 20th best film set in Los Angeles in the last 25years—with two criteria: &quot;The movie had to communicate some inherent truth about the L.A. experience, and only one film per director was allowed on the list&quot;.

<text>Sir Arthur Francis Grimble, (11 June 1888 – 13 December 1956) was a British Colonial Service administrator and writer.

==Biography==

Grimble was educated at Chigwell School and Magdalene College, Cambridge. He then went to France and Germany for postgraduate studies. After joining the Colonial Office in 1914 he became the very first cadet administrative officer in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands. From April 1919 he acted as the Resident Commissioner until Herbert Reginald McClure took up his appointment as Resident Commissioner. In 1925 Grimble succeeded McClure as Resident Commissioner. He learned the Gilbertese language, and became a specialist in the myths and oral traditions of the Kiribati people. He remained in the islands until 1933. He has been the source of many people&#x27;s impressions of the islands through his radio broadcast on BBC in the 1950s and his bestselling book &quot;A Pattern of Islands&quot;.

Grimble later served as Governor of the Seychelles (1936–1942) and as Governor of the Windward Islands (1942–1948). He was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) on 1 January 1930.

==Literary career==
After retiring and moving to Britain in 1948 Grimble became a writer and broadcaster. He wrote &quot;A Pattern of Islands&quot; (London, John Murray 1952, published in the United States as &quot;We Chose the Islands&quot;) and &quot;Return to the Islands&quot; (1957), both of which were bestsellers. &quot;Pacific Destiny&quot;, a film based on his experiences, was released in 1956. Grimble&#x27;s scholarly work on Gilbertese culture is covered in Henry Evans Maude&#x27;s book &quot;Tungaru Traditions: Writings on the Atoll Culture of the Gilbert Islands&quot; (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1989, ).

==Heraldic artist==
In 1931 Grimble designed the coat of arms of the British colony of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, which was granted in 1937. The design has been retained for the flag of Kiribati.

<text>Theodore Yue Tak Ts&#x27;o (; born 1968) is an American software engineer mainly known for his contributions to the Linux kernel, in particular his contributions to file systems. He is the secondary developer and maintainer of e2fsprogs, the userspace utilities for the ext2, ext3, and ext4 filesystems, and is a maintainer for the ext4 file system.

== Biography ==
Ts&#x27;o graduated from MIT with a degree in computer science in 1990, after which he worked in MIT&#x27;s Information Systems (IS) department until 1999. During this time he was project leader of the Kerberos team.

In 1994, Ts&#x27;o created the codice_1 Linux device node and the corresponding kernel driver, which was Linux&#x27;s (and Unix&#x27;s) first kernel interface that provided high-quality cryptographic random numbers to user programs. codice_2 works without access to a hardware random number generator, allowing user programs to depend upon its existence. Separate daemons such as codice_3 take random numbers from such hardware and make them accessible via codice_2. Since its creation, interface codice_2 is used in Linux, FreeBSD, macOS, and Solaris systems.

After MIT IS, Ts&#x27;o went to work for VA Linux Systems for two years. In late 2001 he joined IBM, where he worked on improvements in the Linux kernel&#x27;s performance and scalability. After working on a real-time kernel at IBM, Ts&#x27;o joined the Linux Foundation in late 2007 for a two-year fellowship. He initially served as Chief Platform Strategist, before becoming Chief Technology Officer in 2008. Ts&#x27;o also served as Treasurer for USENIX until 2008, and has chaired the annual Linux Kernel Developers Summit.

In 2010 Ts&#x27;o moved to Google, saying he would be working on &quot;kernel, file system, and storage stuff&quot;.

Ts&#x27;o is a Debian Developer, maintaining several packages, mostly filesystem-related ones, including e2fsprogs since March 2003. He was a member of the Security Area Directorate for the Internet Engineering Task Force, and was one of the chairs for the IPsec working group. He was one of the founding board members for the Free Standards Group.

In July 2023, Ts&#x27;o joined RESF&#x27;s Board of Directors, which encompasses the Rocky Linux project.

== Awards ==
Ts&#x27;o was awarded the Free Software Foundation&#x27;s 2006 Award for the Advancement of Free Software.

<text>Delivering Milo is a 2001 American fantasy comedy film written by David Hubbard and directed by Nick Castle. Anton Yelchin stars as Milo, while Bridget Fonda and Campbell Scott play his parents. Albert Finney stars as Elmore Dahl, a guardian angel sent to convince a soul that life on Earth is worth living.

==Plot==
Elizabeth and Kevin live in NYC in the loft above his glassblowing studio and are expecting their first child. Believing she has gone into labor, they hurry to the hospital. But, once there, the obstetrician tells her she was having Braxton Hicks contractions.

The reality is that in the world from which babies come, Milo is too scared to leave the comfortable place where he has lived. He looks about 11 years old in this place despite not being born yet. Since babies must be born in order, no other babies will be born until he changes his mind. The people in charge have no idea what to do as no baby has ever refused. An old man named Elmore volunteers to show Milo that life is worth it. Elmore is trapped in a sort of limbo until he is determined worthy of Heaven, though he would much rather be back on Earth as he finds limbo to be very boring.

Seeing a chance, Elmore bargains with the powers that be. He must get Milo to say he wants to be born in exchange for more time on Earth. To convince Milo to accompany him, he takes advantage of the boy&#x27;s love of cards games and tricks. They let the cards decide, and Elmore is triumphant.

Elizabeth calls her mom, updating her. She mentions she saw a man who looked like her father who&#x27;d abandoned them years ago.

Elmore and Milo exit thru a door which normally serves only as an entrance. Outside is the energetic and terrifying New York City. Elmore loves it, but Milo doesn&#x27;t want to be in this scary place.

Milo is introduced to a deli, ice cream and Central Park. He initially loves food which he has never needed before. However, once his natural bodily functions kick in and he needs the toilet, he is less convinced. A call from above suggests that Elmore try to inspire Milo&#x27;s soul, but a museum visit has the opposite effect.

As the day goes on, the big news story seen in the background is the lack of births globally. This is a reminder of how Milo&#x27;s doubt and refusal to be born has affected the world.

Cleaning up the studio after a pipe burst, Elizabeth finds a bag with Atlantic City paraphernalia that belonged to her father. She plays blackjack with her husband&#x27;s workmate, and doing well, she impulsively goes to Atlantic City. Almost simultaneously Elmore takes Milo there too, as he loved to gamble when he was alive.

Milo&#x27;s mind has not been changed and there is a deadline: at midnight, the door that the souls go through to be born will close, and no more babies will ever be born. In Atlantic City, Milo and Elizabeth meet. Milo realizes that Elizabeth is his mother, and decides he wants to be born. He also realizes that Elmore is the father who had abandoned Elizabeth and therefore his grandfather.
Elmore and Milo return to the door. Milo, however, is too weak to make it through the door on his own, as his time is nearly up. He begins to die since he will never be born. Elmore, feeling remorse for how he treated his family in life takes Milo back thru the door, giving up his chance to stay on Earth. Elmore accuses the people in charge of setting him up, as they knew Elmore would not be able to leave Milo to die. They don’t deny it, however, they remind him that he was given a choice. 
Milo is finally born and Elmore is finally ascends from limbo to heaven.

<doc id="1034730" wikidata="Q167869" url="?curid=1034730" title="Medium Extended Air Defense System">
<text>The Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS) is a ground-mobile air and missile defense system intended to replace the Patriot missile system through a NATO-managed development. The program is a development of the United States, Germany and Italy. 

MEADS is designed to address the shortcomings of fielded systems and to permit full interoperability between U.S. and allied forces. Germany chose MEADS to replace their MIM-104 Patriot systems in June 2015.

==Description==

MEADS provides ground-mobile air and missile defense with expanded coverage. The system provides enhanced force protection against a broad array of third-dimension threats. Improved interoperability, mobility, and full 360-degree defense capability against the evolving threat represent are key aspects. MEADS is the first air and missile defense (AMD) system that provides continuous on-the-move protection for maneuver forces. MEADS also provides area defense, homeland defense, and weighted asset protection.

MEADS incorporates the Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control hit-to-kill PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) missile in a system including 360-degree surveillance and fire control sensors, netted-distributed tactical operations centers, and lightweight launchers. A single MEADS battery is able to defend up to 8 times the area of a Patriot battery through use of advanced 360-degree sensors, near-vertical launch capability, and the longer-range PAC-3 MSE missile. The MEADS radars – using active phased arrays and digital beam forming – enable full use of the PAC-3 MSE missile&#x27;s extended range.

Truck-mounted MEADS elements drive or roll on and off C-130 and A400M transport aircraft so they are quickly deployed to a theater of operations. Because MEADS uses fewer system assets, it permits a substantial reduction in deployed personnel and equipment. MEADS reduces demand for airlift, so it can deploy to theater faster.

The minimum MEADS engagement capability requires only one launcher, one battle manager, and one fire control radar to provide 360-degree defense of troops or critical assets. As more system elements arrive, they automatically and seamlessly join the MEADS network and build out capability.

The prime contractor, MEADS International, is a multinational joint venture headquartered in Orlando, Florida. Its participating companies are MBDA Italia, MBDA Deutschland GmbH, and Lockheed Martin. The company initially won a competitive downselect to develop the MEADS system in 1999, but the program could not be started because the losing competitor filed two successive suits. In 2001, a $216 million Risk Reduction Effort contract was awarded to incorporate a new interceptor approach. In May 2005, MEADS International signed a definitized contract valued at $2 billion plus €1.4 billion for MEADS design and development. This development contract was completed in 2014. The U.S. funded 58 percent of the MEADS Design and Development program, with European partners Germany and Italy providing 25 percent and 17 percent respectively.

The German &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; completed an analysis of air defense alternatives in 2010 and strongly recommended MEADS as the basis for improving Germany&#x27;s missile defense shield and as Germany&#x27;s contribution to the European Phased Adaptive Approach. In February 2011, the U.S. Department of Defense announced that it intended to fulfill its commitment to complete the design and development effort, but that it would not procure the MEADS system for budgetary reasons. Lockheed Martin developed an interactive life cycle cost and capabilities application based on their Dynamic Comparative Analysis Methodology (DCAM) approach to more fully evaluate and communicate the performance and cost advantage of MEADS as compared to alternative systems. The DCAM application further reinforced the value of MEADS and is credited with helping ensure continued funding.

In October 2011, the National Armaments Directors of Germany, Italy, and the U.S. approved a contract amendment to fund two flight intercept tests, a launcher/missile characterization test, and a sensor characterization test conducted to complete the planned development scope.

In September 2013, MEADS received operating certification for Mode 5 interrogation in its Identification friend or foe (IFF) system. Mode 5 is more secure and provides positive line-of-sight identification of friendly platforms equipped with an IFF transponder to better protect allied forces.

In June 2015, MEADS was selected as the basis for the German &quot;Taktisches Luftverteidigungssystem&quot; (TLVS), a new generation of air and missile defense that requires flexible architecture based on strong networking capabilities. MEADS was a candidate for Poland&#x27;s &quot;Wisła&quot; medium range air defense system procurement, but was eliminated in June 2014 when competition was downselected to the US Patriot system and the French/Italian SAMP/T system. However, Lockheed Martin began renewed discussions with the Polish Ministry of Defense in February 2016 leading to a formal request for information in September 2016. MEADS remains a candidate for Poland&#x27;s Narew short range air defense system procurement.

==Major equipment items==
The MEADS air and missile defense system is composed of six major equipment items. The MEADS radars, battle manager, and launchers are designed for high reliability so that the system will be able to maintain sustained operations much longer than legacy systems, resulting in overall lower operation and support costs.

===Multifunction Fire Control Radar (MFCR)===
An X-band, solid-state, active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar using element-level transmit/receive modules developed in Germany. The MMIC is supplied by the Selex Sistemi Integrati foundry in Rome. The photonics foundry in Rome supplies lithium niobate () components for the radar. The MFCR radar provides precision tracking and wideband discrimination and classification capabilities. For extremely rapid deployments, the MEADS MFCR can provide both surveillance and fire control capabilities until a surveillance radar joins the network. The MFCR uses its main beam for uplink and downlink missile communications. An advanced Mode 5 identification friend-or-foe subsystem supports improved threat identification and typing.

===Surveillance Radar (SR)===
The UHF MEADS Surveillance Radar is a 360-degree active electronically steered array radar that provides extended range coverage. It provides threat detection capability against highly maneuverable low-signature threats, including short- and medium-range ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and other air-breathing threats.

=== Tactical Operations Center (TOC)===
The MEADS TOC provides battle management and C4I (command, control, computers, communications, and intelligence). It controls an advanced network-centric open architecture that allows any combination of sensors and launchers to be organized into a single air and missile defense battle element. The system is netted and distributed. Every MEADS battle manager, radar, and launcher is a wireless node on the network. By virtue of multiple communications paths, the network can be expanded or contracted as the situation dictates and precludes single point failure if one node becomes inoperable. It also has a plug-and-fight capability that allows MEADS launchers and radars to seamlessly enter and leave the network without shutting it down and interrupting ongoing operations. MEADS uses open, non-proprietary standardized interfaces to extend plug-and-fight to non-MEADS elements. This flexibility is new for ground-based AMD systems.

===Launcher and Reloader===
The lightweight MEADS launcher is easily transportable, tactically mobile, and capable of rapid reload. It carries up to eight PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) Missiles and achieves launch readiness in minimum time. A MEADS reloader is similar but lacks launcher electronic systems.

===Certified Missile Round ===
====PAC-3 MSE====

The PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) missile is the baseline interceptor for MEADS. The interceptor increases the system&#x27;s range and lethality over the baseline PAC-3 missile, which was selected as the primary missile for MEADS when the design and development program began in 2004. The MSE missile increases the engagement envelope and defended area by using more responsive control surfaces and a more powerful rocket motor.

==== IRIS-T SL ====
In Germany, the PAC-3 MSE missile is expected to be supplemented by IRIS-T SLM as secondary missile for ground-based medium range air defense. It is based on the IRIS-T air-to-air missile equipped with an enlarged rocket motor, datalink, and jettisonable drag-reducing nose cone.

==Plug-and-fight==
In the BMC4I TOC, plug-and-fight flexibility lets MEADS exchange data with non-MEADS sensors and shooters. The same capability lets MEADS move with ground forces and interoperate with allied forces. Through interoperability features designed into the system, MEADS will dramatically improve combat effectiveness and situational awareness, reducing the possibility of friendly fire incidents. MEADS system elements can seamlessly integrate into each nation&#x27;s, or NATO&#x27;s, combat architecture as required.

Units can be dispersed over a wide area. Command and control of launchers and missiles can be handed over to a neighboring battle management unit while the initial systems are moved, maintaining maneuver force protection. Plug-and-fight connectivity lets MEADS elements attach to and detach from the network at will, with no requirement to shut the system down.

The MEADS plug-and-fight capability enables command and control over other air and missile defense system elements through open, non-proprietary standardized interfaces. MEADS implements a unique ability to work with secondary missile systems if selected, and to evolve as other capabilities are developed.

==Integration and test history==
In July 2010, the MEADS BMC4I demonstrated its interoperability with the NATO Air Command and Control System (ACCS) during tests using the Active Layer Theatre Ballistic Missile Defense (ALTBMD) Integration Test Bed being developed by NATO. The test was an early maturity demonstration for the MEADS BMC4I capability.

In August 2010, the MEADS program completed an extensive series of Critical Design Review (CDR) events with a Summary CDR at MEADS International. Reviewers from Germany, Italy, the U.S., and the NATO Medium Extended Air Defense System Management Agency (NAMEADSMA) evaluated the MEADS design criteria in a comprehensive series of 47 reviews.

In December 2010, the first MEADS launcher and Tactical Operations Center were displayed in ceremonies in Germany and Italy before initiating system integration tests at Pratica di Mare Air Force Base in Italy.

In November 2011, it was announced that the MEADS Multifunction Fire Control Radar had been integrated with a MEADS TOC and launcher at Pratica di Mare Air Force Base. The objectives of the integration test series were to demonstrate that the MEADS TOC could control the MEADS MFCR in coordination with the MEADS Launcher as initial operational proof of the plug-and-fight capability. The MFCR demonstrated key functionalities including 360-degree target acquisition and track using both dedicated flights and other air traffic. Then, at White Sands Missile Range, MEADS demonstrated a first-ever over-the-shoulder launch of the PAC-3 MSE missile against a simulated target attacking from behind. It required a unique sideways maneuver, demonstrating a 360-degree capability. The missile executed a planned self-destruct sequence at the end of the mission after successfully engaging the simulated threat.

In November 2012 at White Sands Missile Range, MEADS detected, tracked, intercepted, and destroyed an air-breathing target in an intercept flight test. The test configuration included a networked MEADS Tactical Operations Center, lightweight launcher firing a PAC-3 MSE, and a 360-degree MEADS Multifunction Fire Control Radar, which tracked the MQM-107 target and guided the missile to a successful intercept.

Several progress milestones were demonstrated during 2013, culminating in a 360-degree dual-intercept test that went beyond initial contract objectives. In April, the MEADS Surveillance Radar acquired and tracked a small test aircraft and relayed its location to a MEADS TOC, which generated cue search commands. The MFCR, in full 360-degree rotating mode, searched the cued area, acquired the target, and established a dedicated track.

In June 2013, during six days of testing, MEADS demonstrated network interoperability with NATO systems during Joint Project Optic Windmill (JPOW) exercises. MEADS demonstrated battle management capability to transmit, receive, and process Link 16 messages and to conduct threat engagements.

In November 2013, MEADS intercepted and destroyed two simultaneous targets attacking from opposite directions during a stressing demonstration of its 360-degree AMD capabilities at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico. All elements of the MEADS system were tested, including the 360-degree MEADS Surveillance Radar, a networked MEADS battle manager, two lightweight launchers firing PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) Missiles and a 360-degree MEADS Multifunction Fire Control Radar (MFCR). The flight test achieved all criteria for success.

The first target, a QF-4 air-breathing target, approached from the south. Simultaneously a MGM-52 Lance missile, flying a tactical ballistic missile trajectory, attacked from the north. The Surveillance Radar acquired both targets and provided target cues to the MEADS battle manager, which generated cue commands for the MFCR. The MFCR tracked both targets successfully and guided missiles from launchers in the Italian and German configurations to successful intercepts.

At White Sands Missile Range, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman also demonstrated plug-and-fight connectivity between MEADS and the U.S. Army&#x27;s Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS). IBCS demonstrated ability to plug-and-fight a 360-degree MEADS Surveillance Radar and Multifunction Fire Control Radar.

In July 2014, MEADS completed a comprehensive system demonstration at Pratica di Mare Air Base, Italy. The tests, including operational demonstrations run by German and Italian military personnel, were designed to seamlessly add and subtract system elements under representative combat conditions, and to blend MEADS with other systems in a larger system architecture. All criteria for success were achieved.

During the test, plug-and-fight capability to rapidly attach and control an external Italian deployable air defense radar was demonstrated. Also demonstrated was engage-on-remote flexibility, which allows operators to target threats at greater distances despite being masked by terrain. Through reassigning workload, MEADS demonstrated ability to maintain defense capabilities if any system element is lost or fails.

Interoperability with German and Italian air defense assets was demonstrated through exchange of standardized NATO messages. Italian air-defense assets were integrated into a test bed at an Italian national facility, while the Surface to Air Missile Operations Centre and Patriot assets were integrated into a test bed at the German Air Force Air Defense Center in Fort Bliss, Texas. MEADS further demonstrated capability to perform engagement coordination with other systems, which fielded system are unable to do.

In September 2014, MEADS MFCRs completed a six-week performance test at Pratica di Mare Air Base, Italy, and MBDA Deutschland&#x27;s air defense center in Freinhausen. During the tests, the MEADS MFCR successfully demonstrated several advanced capabilities, many of which are critical for ground-mobile radar systems. Capabilities tested include tracking and canceling of jamming signals; searching, cueing and tracking in ground clutter; and successfully classifying target data using kinematic information.

On 9 June 2015, Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen announced that Germany had selected MEADS as the foundation for its Taktisches Luftverteidigungssystem (TLVS), which is planned to replace Germany&#x27;s Patriot systems. In January 2017, MEADS International presented an updated offer for Poland&#x27;s medium-range air defense (Wisła) program to Poland&#x27;s Ministry of National Defense.

<doc id="1034732" wikidata="Q314133" url="?curid=1034732" title="Anton Yelchin">
<text>Anton Viktorovich Yelchin (March 11, 1989 – June 19, 2016) was an American actor. Born in the Soviet Union to a Russian Jewish family, he immigrated to the United States with his parents at the age of six months. He began his career as a child actor, appearing as the lead of the mystery drama film &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; (2001) and a series regular on the Showtime comedy-drama &quot;Huff&quot; (2004–2006). His fame grew when he guest-starred in a 2004 episode of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;.

Yelchin landed higher-profile film roles in 2009, portraying Pavel Chekov in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; reboot and Kyle Reese in &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot;. He reprised his role as Chekov in the sequels &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot; (2013) and &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot; (2016).

Yelchin frequently worked on independent and lower-profile films, headlining the romantic drama &quot;Like Crazy&quot; (2011), the 2011 remake of &quot;Fright Night&quot;, the supernatural thriller &quot;Odd Thomas&quot; (2013), the romance &quot;5 to 7&quot; (2014), the horror comedy &quot;Burying the Ex&quot; (2014), the neo-noir &quot;The Driftless Area&quot; (2015), and the horror thriller &quot;Green Room&quot; (2015). As a voice actor, he voiced Clumsy Smurf in the live-action &quot;Smurfs&quot; films (2011–2013) and the lead role James Lake Jr. on the Netflix animated series &quot;&quot; (2016–2018). He maintained an active career until his accidental death in mid-2016 when he was fatally injured by his SUV at the age of 27.

==Early life and education ==
Yelchin was born on March 11, 1989, in Leningrad, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union. His parents, Irina Korina and Viktor Yelchin, were pair figure skaters who were stars of the Leningrad Ice Ballet for 15 years. He was Jewish, and his family was subjected to religious and political oppression in the Soviet Union. Yelchin said that his grandparents &quot;suffered in ways [he] can&#x27;t even begin to understand under Stalin&quot;. Nationally, Yelchin&#x27;s parents were the third-ranked pair team; they thus qualified for the 1972 Winter Olympics, but were not permitted to participate by the Soviet authorities. Yelchin said the reason was unclear: &quot;I don&#x27;t exactly know what that was – because they were Jewish or because the KGB didn&#x27;t want them to travel.&quot;

Yelchin&#x27;s family left for the United States in September 1989, when he was six months old, and were thereafter granted refugee status from the Department of State. His mother worked as a figure skating choreographer and his father as a figure skating coach, having been Sasha Cohen&#x27;s first trainer. Yelchin&#x27;s uncle is the children&#x27;s author and painter Eugene Yelchin. In an article published in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in December 1989, Yelchin&#x27;s mother stated, &quot;A woman came up, saw Anton, and said, &#x27;He&#x27;s beautiful. He will be actor.&#x27;&quot; Yelchin stated that he &quot;wasn&#x27;t very good&quot; at figure skating, his parents&#x27; profession.

Yelchin grew up in the San Fernando Valley. He attended the Sherman Oaks Center for Enriched Studies in Tarzana, California and enrolled at the University of Southern California in the fall of 2007 to study film.

Yelchin was born with cystic fibrosis, though the details of his medical condition were only revealed posthumously in 2017 by a foundation established in his name, the Anton Yelchin Foundation. The foundation aims to support children and young adults ages 7-27, who were engaged in the arts but also suffering from debilitating disease or disability.

==Career==
After his film debut in &quot;A Man Is Mostly Water&quot;, Yelchin&#x27;s early roles in both film and television include &quot;Delivering Milo&quot;, &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot;, &quot;Taken&quot;, and &quot;House of D&quot;. Yelchin played Bobby Garfield in &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; (2001), for which he received a Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a Feature Film: Leading Young Actor in 2002.
On Showtime&#x27;s television series &quot;Huff&quot;, Yelchin played Byrd Huffstodt, the 14-year-old son of the eponymous character (Hank Azaria). In 2004, he guest-starred in the Season Four episode of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; as Stewart, Cheryl David&#x27;s cousin and a self-described magician who knows a card trick. In 2006, he guest-starred in the &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; episode &quot;Tru Love&quot;, as a boy who falls in love with his teacher. He also appeared in the &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; episode &quot;Sex, Birth &amp; Death&quot; as Nathan Harris, a boy who has murderous urges toward prostitutes and approaches Dr. Spencer Reid to help him before he actually does kill.

In &quot;Alpha Dog&quot;, Yelchin played Zack Mazursky, a character based on real-life murder victim Nicholas Markowitz. &quot;USA Today&quot;″s review described Yelchin&#x27;s performance as &quot;heartbreakingly endearing&quot;. After the film&#x27;s premiere, Markowitz&#x27;s mother praised his portrayal of her son. Yelchin subsequently headlined &quot;Fierce People&quot;, which received a limited release on September 7, 2007. In 2008, he played the title role in &quot;Charlie Bartlett&quot;, a film about a wealthy teenager in a public high school. He also appeared alongside the Russian duo t.A.T.u. in the film &quot;You and I&quot; (which was filmed in Moscow during the summer of 2007).
Yelchin played supporting roles in two blockbuster films released in May 2009: &quot;Star Trek&quot;, in which he played teenage navigator Pavel Chekov, and &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot;, in which he played a young Kyle Reese.

In 2011, Yelchin played Charley Brewster in Craig Gillespie&#x27;s remake film &quot;Fright Night&quot;, starred in the romantic drama &quot;Like Crazy&quot;, and voiced Clumsy Smurf in the film adaptation of &quot;The Smurfs&quot;, as well as its 2013 sequel. He replaced Russell Tovey for the voice role of Albino Pirate in the American version of the animated film &quot;The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists!&quot; (also known as &quot;The Pirates! Band of Misfits&quot;) (2012).

Yelchin again played the role of Chekov in the 2013 film &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;. He played the lead in the thriller &quot;Odd Thomas&quot; (2013). Yelchin reprised his role as Chekov in &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot;, which was released in 2016. 

He completed filming several independent films that were released posthumously. He recorded the voice role of Jim Lake Jr. on Guillermo del Toro&#x27;s animated TV series &quot;&quot;. He was cast as one of the lead actors in a TV adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s book &quot;Mr. Mercedes&quot;, but died before filming began.

==Personal life==

Yelchin enjoyed playing guitar, and was a fan of acoustic blues music. He once played for a punk band called the Hammerheads. His music was used in the soundtrack of &quot;Love Antosha,&quot; a documentary released after his death. 

He was interested in photography. In January 2018, an exhibit of his photography titled &quot;Anton Yelchin: Provocative Beauty&quot; was displayed at New York City&#x27;s De Buck Gallery. Yelchin&#x27;s photography was critically acclaimed by various magazines around the world as exhibits continued.

Yelchin briefly dated his co-star Kristen Stewart when they were filming &quot;Fierce People&quot;; after his death, she described him as her &quot;first heartbreak&quot;.

===Death===
After Yelchin failed to arrive at a rehearsal on June 18, 2016, he was found dead by friends at around 1:10 a.m. that night. He was pinned between his Jeep Grand Cherokee and a brick pillar gate post outside his house in Studio City, Los Angeles. As Yelchin apparently got out of his car and went to check his locked gate for mail, the vehicle rolled back down his driveway, which was on a steep incline and trapped him against the pillar and a security fence. He was pronounced dead at the scene; the Los Angeles County Coroner&#x27;s office identified the cause of death as &quot;blunt traumatic asphyxia&quot; and stated that there were &quot;no obvious suspicious circumstances involved&quot;.

====Tributes====

Following Yelchin&#x27;s death, the producers of &quot;Star Trek&quot; stated that the role of Chekov would not be recast and that the character would be written out of any subsequent &quot;Star Trek&quot; films. &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot; was dedicated to Yelchin and Leonard Nimoy, who had also died since the previous film.

&quot;&quot;, &quot;We Don&#x27;t Belong Here&quot;, &quot;Rememory&quot;, &quot;Porto&quot;, &quot;Newness&quot;, &quot;Thoroughbreds&quot;, and the first two episodes of &quot;&quot; are dedicated to him, with the entirety of &quot;Trollhunters&quot; being dedicated to him upon its conclusion in May 2018. Yelchin was featured in the &quot;In Memoriam&quot; presentation during the 89th Academy Awards. Actors and other celebrities posted their condolences via social media.

In October 2017, a bronze statue of Yelchin was erected at his grave in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery. Celebrities present at the unveiling ceremony included Jennifer Lawrence, Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg, J. J. Abrams, Emile Hirsch, Demi Moore, Jon Voight, Drake Doremus, and Jeremy Saulnier.

Yelchin was memorialized in the video game &quot;Star Trek Online&quot;. He received a memorial plaque alongside several other late &quot;Star Trek&quot; actors, including Nimoy, James Doohan, and &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry. A Starfleet vessel named &quot;The &quot;Yelchin&quot;&quot; is mentioned twice in the &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; episode &quot;Unification III&quot; (S03E07) and again in the season four finale &quot;Coming Home&quot; (S04E13).

In January 2019, Viktor and Irina Yelchin premiered a documentary about their son—&quot;Love, Antosha—&quot;at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival.

====Lawsuit and recalls====
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA), the manufacturer of the Grand Cherokee, was aware of 2014 and 2015 models having a high rate of rollaway incidents due to a gearshift design that could make it difficult for the driver to determine whether the vehicle was in park or still in gear. FCA had already recalled all 2014–15 Grand Cherokees for this concern in April 2016, but the software patch to repair the vehicles did not reach dealers until the week of Yelchin&#x27;s death. Following his death, FCA accelerated the recall campaign and took steps to get the affected Jeeps repaired more quickly than originally planned.

In August 2016, Yelchin&#x27;s parents announced through their attorney that they were planning to file a wrongful death lawsuit against Fiat Chrysler. The dealership from which Yelchin purchased the vehicle stated that he was responsible for his own death because he had allegedly &quot;misused&quot; and &quot;modified&quot; the vehicle and asked to be removed from the lawsuit. In March 2018, it was announced that Yelchin&#x27;s family and Fiat Chrysler had confidentially settled out of court.

<text>Rosa rubiginosa (sweet briar, sweetbriar rose, sweet brier or eglantine; syn. &quot;R. eglanteria&quot;) is a species of rose native to Europe and western Asia.

==Description==
It is a dense deciduous shrub 2–3 meters high and across, with the stems bearing numerously hooked prickles. The foliage has a strong apple-like fragrance. The leaves are pinnately compound, 5–9  cm long, with 5–9 rounded to oval leaflets with a serrated margin, and numerous glandular hairs. The flowers are 1.8–3  cm in diameter, the five petals being pink with a white base, and the numerous stamens yellow; the flowers are produced in clusters of 2–7 together, from late spring to mid-summer. The fruit is a globose to oblong red hip 1–2 cm in diameter.

==Etymology==
Its name &quot;eglantine&quot; is from Middle English &quot;eglentyn&quot;, from Old French &quot;aiglantin&quot; (adj.), from &quot;aiglent&quot; &#x27;sweetbrier&#x27;, from Vulgar Latin *&quot;aculentus&quot; (with the ending of &quot;spinulentus&quot; &#x27;thorny, prickly&#x27;), from Latin &quot;aculeus&quot; &#x27;prickle&#x27;, from &quot;acus&quot; &#x27;needle&#x27;. &quot;Sweet&quot; refers to the sweet, apple fragrance of the leaves, while &quot;briar&quot; ~ &quot;brier&quot; refers to it being a thorny bush.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Rosa rubiginosa&quot; is native to most of Europe with the exception of the extreme north (above 61°N), where it inhabits pastures and thorny bushes from the montane to the subalpine floor, with a sunny, continental climate. It is somewhat rare, with isolated specimens near roads and pastures frequented by cattle. Its presence is doubtful in western Asia. In Southern Europe it lives in higher altitudes, usually . In Portugal it is classified as Critically Endangered and is restricted to the Serra da Estrela range.

==Cultivation and uses==
In addition to its pink flowers, it is valued for its scent and the hips that form after the flowers and persist well into the winter. Graham Thomas recommends that it should be planted on the south or west side of the garden so that the fragrance will be brought into the garden on warm, moist winds. A specimen without any scent, and blush to white flowers may be the closely related fieldbriar, &quot;Rosa agrestis&quot;.

The tea made from the hips of this rose is very popular in Europe and elsewhere, where it is considered a healthy way for people to get their daily dose of vitamin C and other nutrients. A cup of rosehip tea will provide the minimum daily adult requirement of vitamin C. During World War II the British relied on rose hips and hops as the sources for their vitamins A and C. It was a common British wartime expression to say that: &quot;We are getting by on our hips and hops.&quot;

In Tunisia, natural flower water is produced from its flowers.

In Chile and Argentina, where it is known in Spanish as &quot;Rosa Mosqueta&quot;, it is cultivated to produce marmalades and cosmetic products, and has escaped into the wild in and near the Andes.

==Invasive species==
* It has become an invasive species in most of Argentine Patagonia and in the south of Chile, particularly where the steppe meets the forest. Cattle spread the seed efficiently through their feces. Poor knowledge of how detrimental it is to the local economy and native species has led &quot;Rosa rubiginosa&quot; to become the threat that it is today. It is estimated that it causes several millions of dollars worth of damage each year.
*&quot;Rosa rubiginosa&quot; is an invasive species in southeast Australia.
*It is classified as a restricted plant in New Zealand and is banned from sale, propagation and distribution in the Auckland, Canterbury, and Southland regions. The New Zealand Department of Conservation classifies &quot;R. rubiginosa&quot; as an &quot;environmental weed&quot;. The plant is present in extensive areas of pasture and tussock grasslands in the Otago and Canterbury regions, where the seeds are spread by cattle, possums and birds that eat the hips. Growth from seed is aided by the reduction in competing pasture by rabbits.
*It is listed as a Category 1 Declared Weed in South Africa. These plants may no longer be planted or propagated, and all trade in their seeds, cuttings or other propagative material is prohibited.

<text>Heneage Finch, 3rd Earl of Winchilsea ( – 28 September 1689) was an English peer and diplomat who served as the English ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1660 to 1669.

==Early life==
Finch was the only surviving son of Thomas Finch, 2nd Earl of Winchilsea and the former Cecille Wentworth of Gosfield Hall, Essex.

His paternal grandparents were Sir Moyle Finch, 1st Baronet and Elizabeth Finch, &quot;suo jure&quot; 1st Countess of Winchilsea. His father inherited his grandfather&#x27;s baronetcy from his uncle, Sir Theophilus Finch, 2nd Baronet, who died without issue in 1619. His maternal grandparents were John Wentworth, High Sheriff of Essex and Cecily Unton. His first cousin was Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham.

He was educated at Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge.

==Career==
On his return from Ottoman territory in June 1668, King Charles II remarked to Finch, &quot;My Lord, you have not only built a town, but peopled it too&quot;. Winchilsea, in an obvious reference to Charles&#x27; own brood of natural children, replied that after all, he was the King&#x27;s representative.

Lord Finch was appointed by his friend George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle a Governor of Dover Castle, and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in July 1660. He was also Lord Lieutenant of Kent and afterwards ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, and served in this capacity between 1668 and 1672.

Samuel Pepys first referred to him as the Lord Winchilsea.

King Charles II had landed at Kent on his way to London to secure the throne on 25 May 1660. The King arrived in Dover with 20 ships and frigates, the Lord General and his lifeguard were accompanied by the Earl of Winchelsea to the cheer of the crowding locals gathered upon the beach to witness a salute fired from the guns of Dover Castle. The King created him Baron FitzHerbert, of Eastwell in the County of Kent, on 26 June 1660.

==Personal life==

Finch was married four times and was the father of at least sixteen children. His first marriage was on 21 May 1645 to the Hon. Diana Willoughby, the eldest daughter of Francis Willoughby, 5th Baron Willoughby of Parham and Elizabeth Cecil (a younger daughter and co-heiress of Edward Cecil, 1st Viscount Wimbledon). She died and was buried at Eastwell on 27 March 1648.

His second marriage was in to Lady Mary Seymour (1637–1673), the second daughter of William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset and Lady Frances Devereux eldest daughter of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex). Before her death in 1673, their children included:

* William Finch, &quot;styled&quot; Viscount Maidstone (–1672), who died at sea aboard the &quot;Royal Charles&quot; during the Battle of Solebay; he married Elizabeth Wyndham, a daughter of Thomas Wyndham, of Felbrigg Hall.
* Lady Frances Finch (d. 1712), who married Thomas Thynne, 1st Viscount Weymouth.
* Heneage Finch, 5th Earl of Winchilsea (1657–1726), who married Anne Kingsmill, the daughter of Sir William Kingsmill.
* Hon. Thomas Finch (b. 1658), who was born before the family went to the Ottoman Empire.
* Elizabeth

His third marriage was to Catherine Norcliffe on 10 April 1673. The daughter of Sir Thomas Norcliffe and Hon. Dorothy Fairfax (fifth daughter of Thomas Fairfax, 1st Viscount Fairfax), she was twice a widow from her marriages to Christopher Lister, of Thornton, York, and Sir John Wentworth, of Elmshall, York. She died in .

His final marriage was on 29 October 1681 to Elizabeth Ayres, only daughter and heiress of John Ayres of London. Before his death in 1689, they were the parents of:

* John Finch, 6th Earl of Winchilsea, who died unmarried and without issue.

Lord Winchilsea died on 28 September 1689. He was succeeded in his titles by his grandson Charles, as his eldest son William predeceased him.

===Descendants===
Through his daughter Frances, he was a grandfather of Henry Thynne (1675–1708), and Frances Thynne (who married Sir Robert Worsley, 4th Baronet).

<doc id="1034744" wikidata="Q2412267" url="?curid=1034744" title="Bobo Olson">
<text>Carl &quot;Bobo&quot; Olson (July 11, 1928 – January 16, 2002) was an American boxer. He was the World Middleweight champion between October 1953 and December 1955, the longest reign of any champion in that division during the 1950s.
His nickname was based on his younger sister&#x27;s mispronunciation of &quot;brother&quot;.

== Early years ==
Olson was born in Honolulu, Territory of Hawaii to a Portuguese mother and a Swedish father, hence his other nickname &quot;The Hawaiian Swede&quot;. Like many boxers, Olson decided to take up the sport after getting into fights on the streets. Olson received training from boxers who were stationed in Hawaii during World War II, and it was during this period that he picked up his two trademark tattoos.

Using a fake identity card Olson obtained a boxing license at the age of 16. His earliest fights were in his native Kalihi, Hawaii. He had won his first three contests, two by knockout, before his true age was discovered. During 1945, Olson ran off to San Francisco to continue his boxing career. By the time he was 18, he had amassed a record of 13 successive wins (10 by KO). Even at this stage his power and huge reserves of stamina were clear, as was his rather average skill.

==Professional career==
The first real test of Olson&#x27;s career came on March 20, 1950, Olson&#x27;s record at this point was 40 wins and 2 losses, against the Australian Dave Sands. Olson lost to a close points decision in Sydney. Seven months after this Olson had his first fight against Sugar Ray Robinson, for the lowly regarded Pennsylvania State World Middleweight Title. Olson, who was widely seen as a slow starter, failed to get into the fight, even though Robinson was not having one of his best fights. Olson managed to hold on for 11 rounds before being knocked out. Despite his great record it was clear that Olson was still too inexperienced to be fighting at that level.

A year after his loss to Robinson, Olson managed to get a rematch against Dave Sands. This fight was the first to be televised coast-to-coast in America. However, Sands once again proved too much for Olson, he again won by unanimous decision.

On March 13, 1952, Olson fought Robinson again, this time for the world middleweight title. Robinson, who had lost and regained the title against Randy Turpin in his previous two fights, was looking for an easy fight. However, Olson had improved significantly from their first encounter. Through ten rounds the fight was neck-and-neck, and only a dominant finish by Robinson over the last five rounds won him the decision. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that Robinson won the first six rounds easily, slowly stacking up points, but that Olson reduced the points margin in the seventh through tenth. Robinson won the fifteenth convincingly with hard rights and lefts. This would be the only time that Olson lasted the duration against Robinson.

Robinson retired for the first time in December 1952, vacating his middleweight crown. The top four contenders fought a tournament for the title. Olson defeated Paddy Young for the American title to gain the right to fight for the vacant world title, Turpin won the other eliminator against Charley Humez.

The title fight against Turpin took place on October 21, 1953, at Madison Square Garden. Turpin dominated the first four rounds, he almost scored a knockdown in the first round, before Olson got a grip on the fight. As the fight progressed Olson took the initiative, he scored knockdowns in the 10th and 11th rounds on the way to a unanimous decision. Following his success Olson was voted Ring magazine&#x27;s fighter of the year for 1953.

Olson won all seven of his fights in 1954 including defenses of his title against such big names as Kid Gavilan, Rocky Castellani, and Pierre Langlois.
In 1955 Olson, who was finding it increasingly difficult to make weight, stepped up to light heavyweight. His first major fight in this category was against former champion Joey Maxim. Olson won the fight easily on points after scoring knockdowns in both the 2nd and 9th rounds. On June 22 Olson challenged 41-year-old Archie Moore for the light heavyweight title, a fight that many believed Olson would easily win. However, Moore was too strong for Olson and won by knockout after only a minute had elapsed of the third round. After this fight Olson began his decline.

Following two walkover wins, Olson put his middleweight title on the line against Robinson, who was once again number 1 contender following his brief retirement, on December 9, 1955. It was Olson&#x27;s fourth and final defense of his title, but ended as a stunning comeback for Robinson. Olson, who entered the fight as a 3–1 favorite, was knocked out in the second round. The rematch, fought five months later at Wrigley Field, on May 18, 1956, ended similarly with Olson going down in the fourth. Robinson ended the bout with a hard left hook to the body and a right to the jaw. Olson had made the mistake of dropping his right hand after Robinson&#x27;s hard left, dropping his only defense in an instant. After this second defeat Olson announced his retirement.

==Late career==

After a year out of the game Olson returned as a heavyweight to fight Maxim again, a fight he won on points. Olson took another year out following a knockout defeat against Pat McMurtry. Whilst initially coming back as a journeyman, despite being only 30, Olson managed to reestablish himself as a contender. On November 27, 1964, he fought José Torres with the winner going on to fight the champion, Willie Pastrano. Olson was knocked out after 2 minutes of the first round. This defeat effectively ended his career, he would only fight again four more times, with his final fight being a defeat to Gene Fullmer&#x27;s younger brother, Don.

==Life after boxing==

Olson retired with a record of 97 wins (47 by KO), 16 losses, and 2 draws from his 115 professional fights. He went on to work with disaffected youngsters before working as a PR officer for the Elevator Operating Engineers Local Union in San Francisco. In 1987 he was a Union Elevator Operator in Lancaster, California, working on new construction at the Antelope Valley Medical Center.

In the 1990s he lived in Northern California for a time. In his later years Olson suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. To add quality of life to his later years he and much of his close family returned to Honolulu. He died on January 16, 2002, in Honolulu at Queens Medical Center at the age of 73.

He was inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame in 1958, and the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2000.

<text>Harold Gilleshammer (born April 8, 1942) is a Canadian judge and former politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Manitoba legislature from 1988 to 2003, and a Cabinet Minister in the government of Progressive Conservative Premier Gary Filmon from 1990 to 1999.

The son of Olaf Gilleshammer, he was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts in History, Political Science and English from the University of Manitoba and a Bachelor of Education from Brandon University. He subsequently worked as a teacher.

Gilleshammer was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1988, in the rural riding of Minnedosa in the province&#x27;s southwest. The seat has normally been safe for the Conservatives, although a rise in Liberal Party support in 1988 meant that Liberal candidate Terry Drebit was able to pose a credible challenge. Gilleshammer won the election, however, by 1,173 votes. The Progressive Conservatives formed a minority government after the election, although Gilleshammer was not initially appointed to cabinet.

Provincial support for the Liberal Party declined in 1990, and Gilleshammer defeated Drebit by over 2000 votes in that year&#x27;s provincial election, in a rematch between the two candidates. Shortly after the election, Gilleshammer was named Minister of Family Services. On September 10, 1993, he was promoted to Minister of Culture, Heritage and Citizenship, with responsibility for Multiculturalism, the Liquor Control Act and A.E. McKenzie Co. Ltd. Gilleshammer was easily re-elected in the 1995 general election, finishing over 2400 votes ahead of his nearest opponent.

Following a cabinet shuffle on January 6, 1997, Gilleshammer was named Minister of Labour, with responsibility for the Civil Service Act, the Civil Service Superannuation Act, the Civil Service Supplementary Severance Benefit Act, the Public Servants Insurance Act, and the Workers Compensation Act. Shortly after Gilleshammer&#x27;s appointment, the Manitoba Human Rights Commission ruled that the province who be required to provide health, dental and vision benefits to the partners of gay government workers.

Following a further cabinet shuffle on February 5, 1999, he was appointed to the high-ranking position of Minister of Finance, with responsibility for the Crown Corporations Public Review and Accountability Act. His pre-election budget offered increased spending in various fields, to be paid for by withdrawals on a government contingency fund (his critics referred to his as concealing a provincial deficit).

The Progressive Conservatives were defeated in the provincial election of 1999, although Gilleshammer was personally re-elected in Minnedosa, defeating New Democratic Party candidate Harvey Paterson by 903 votes. Following the election, he was named as the party&#x27;s Deputy Leader. Gilleshammer retired from the legislature in 2003.
In 2007, Gilleshammer was appointed as a Citizenship Judge by the Canadian Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Diane Finley.

<doc id="1034755" wikidata="Q486090" url="?curid=1034755" title="Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma">
<text>Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) refers to a group of non-Hodgkin lymphomas in which aberrant T cells proliferate uncontrollably. Considered as a single entity, ALCL is the most common type of peripheral lymphoma and represents ~10% of all peripheral lymphomas in children. The incidence of ALCL is estimated to be 0.25 cases per 100,000 people in the United States of America. There are four distinct types of anaplastic large-cell lymphomas that on microscopic examination share certain key histopathological features and tumor marker proteins. However, the four types have very different clinical presentations, gene abnormalities, prognoses, and/or treatments.

ALCL is defined based on microscopic histopathological examination of involved tissues which shows the presence of at least some ALCL-defining pleomorphic cells. These &quot;hallmark&quot; cells have abnormal kidney-shaped or horseshoe-shaped nuclei, prominent Golgi, and express the CD30 tumor marker protein on their surface membranes. In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) separated ALCL into four types: ALK-positive ALCL (also termed ALK+ ALCL), ALK-negative ALCL (ALK− ALCL), primary cutaneous ALCL (pcALCL), and breast implant-associated ALCL (BIA-ALCL). WHO defined BIA-ALCL as an ALCL type provisionally, i.e. subject to redefinition if future studies should support such a change.

ALK-positive and ALK-negative ALCL are aggressive systemic lymphomas. They are differentiated based on their expression of an abnormal ALK protein made by a somatic recombination in the &quot;ALK&quot; gene. ALK, i.e. anaplastic lymphoma kinase, is a protein product of the &quot;ALK&quot; gene located on chromosome 2. In ALK-positive ALCL, a portion of the &quot;ALK&quot; gene has merged with another site on the same or different chromosome to form a chimeric gene consisting of part of the new site and part of the &quot;ALK&quot; gene coding for ALK&#x27;s activity. This chimeric gene overproduces a fusion protein with excessive ALK activity. ALK is a tyrosine kinase that activities PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Ras-activated ERKs, Janus kinase-activated STAT proteins, and other cell signaling pathways as well as the expression of various genes by epigenetic mechanisms. Activations of these signaling pathways and genes may stimulate cell growth, proliferation, survival, and/or other behaviors that promote malignancy. ALK-negative ALCL, while not involving &quot;ALK&quot; translocations, has, in a variable percentage of cases, various translocations, rearrangements, and mutations that may contribute to its development.

pcALCL and BIA-ALCL are far less aggressive lymphomas that tend to be localized to one or a very few sites. pcALCL presents as a single or, less commonly, multifocal skin papules or tumors that typically are limited to the dermis without infiltrating to the subcutaneous tissues or spreading to other sites. Its neoplastic cells may contain some gene translocations including, in very rare cases, ones with the &quot;ALK&quot; gene that are similar to those in ALK-positive ALCL. BIA-ALCL is caused by and develops around a breast implant. It typically presents many years after the surgical implantation as a deformation, textural change, and/or pain emanating in the area around implanted breast. In most cases, the disease is localized to the involved breast. BPI-ALCL is associated with occasional mutations in one or two genes but has not been reported to be associated with products of gene translocations or rearrangements.

==ALK-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma==
===Signs and symptoms===
ALK-positive ALCL occurs mostly but not exclusively in children and young adults and is slightly more common in males. Most individuals present with stage III or IV (i.e. advanced) disease. They evidence systemic symptoms including B symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss in 75% of cases; lymph node enlargement (90%) including those in the mediastinum (36%); and lymphomatous lesions in the skin (26%), bone (14%), soft tissues (15%), lung (12%), and/or liver (8%). Tumor cells are found in the bone marrow in up to 40% of the cases when immunohistochemical analysis is performed. Involvement of the central nervous system or a leukemia-like circulation of malignant cells in the blood occurs only very rarely. Most patients, including up to 90% of young children and adolescents, have circulating autoantibodies directed against the ALK fusion protein expressed by their tumor cells.

===Diagnosis===
 ALK-positive ALCL is diagnosed by histological and immunological examinations of involved tissues, typically lymph nodes. These tissues have lymphoma-like infiltrates that have variable numbers of ALCL &quot;hallmark&quot; cells, i.e. cells with kidney- or horseshoe-shaped nuclei that strongly express CD30 as detected by immunohistochemistry and an ALK fusion protein as detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization. These cells are scattered throughout the infiltrates. WHO classifies these infiltrates into 5 patterns: a common pattern consisting of large variably shaped cells with large nuclei that typically contain multiple nucleoli (60–70% of cases); a small-cell pattern consisting of small to medium-sized neoplastic cells with clear cytoplasm and &quot;hallmark&quot; cells that are concentrated around small blood vessels (5–10% of cases); a lymphohistiocytic pattern consisting of small neoplastic cells along with abundant histiocytes (10% of cases); a Hodgkin&#x27;s-like pattern in which the architecture resembles the nodular sclerosis pattern of Hodgkin lymphoma (3% of cases); and a composite pattern consisting of two or more of the just described patterns (15% of cases). Detection of circulating autoantibody against ALK supports the diagnosis. Individuals with low levels of these autoantibodies are at an increase risk of relapsing after treatment.

===Gene and molecular abnormalities===
In 80–85% of cases, the ALK detected in ALK-positive ALCL is a NPM1-ALK fusion protein. It is made by a fusion of &quot;NPM1&quot; gene, which makes nucleophosmin 1, located on the long or &quot;q&quot; arm of chromosome 5 at position 35 (notated as 5q35) with the &quot;ALK&quot; gene located on the short or &quot;p&quot; arm of chromosome 2 at position 23 (notated as 2p23) to form a chimeric gene notated as (2;5)(p23;q35). In 13% of cases &quot;ALK&quot; fuses with the &quot;TPM3&quot; gene or in &lt;1% of cases for each of the following genes: &quot;TFG, ATIC, CLTC, TPM4, MSN, RNF213&quot; (also termed &quot;ALO17&quot;), &quot;MYH9&quot;, or &quot;TRAF1&quot;. All of these fusion proteins are considered to act like NPMI-ALK in possessing high ALK activity that promotes the development and progression ALK-positive ALCL by activating the cell signaling pathways cited in the Introduction. 15% Of individuals with ALK-positive ALCL also have point mutations in the &quot;NOTCH1&quot; gene. While most of these abnormalities are thought to be detrimental not all are. For example, &quot;DUSP22&quot; gene rearrangements are associated with favorable outcomes in ALK-positive (as well as ALK-negative) ALCL.

===Treatment and prognosis===
A recommended induction therapy for ALK-positive ALCL in individuals with lesions containing more than 10 percent CD30-positive cells consists of brentuximab vedotin (a drug consisting of an anti-CD30 antibody attached to a cell-killing agent, monomethyl auristatin E); two chemotherapy drugs, cyclophosphamide and the anthracycline doxorubicin; and the corticosteroid, prednisone. This regimen gave a progression-free survival rate of 48.2 months in one study and overall survival rates of 70–90% at five years in other studies. For &gt;60 year old and medically unfit individuals of any age, the standard CHOP regimen (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, prednisone, and the chemotherapeutic agent vincristine) is used. For younger, medically fit individuals, the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide is added to the CHOP regimen (CHOP plus etoposide is termed the &quot;CHOEP&quot; regimen). For patients with lesions that contain &lt;10% CD30-positive neoplastic cells, brentuximab vedotin, which targets these cells, is not used. Rather, patients are treated with an anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen. Patients &gt;60 years or less medically fit are given cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone while patients ≤60 years old are given CHOP plus etoposide or one of various other intensive chemotherapy regiments. The intensive chemotherapy regimens give 5 year overall survival rates of 70–93%. The role of radiation therapy for ALK-positive ALCL is unclear but has been used for patients who cannot tolerate or do not achieve complete responses to the drug regimens and to patients with organ-threatening or life-threatening tumorous infiltrates. The role of autologous or less preferably allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (transplantation using the individuals own bone marrow, i.e. autologous, or a donor&#x27;s, i.e. allogenic) after achieving a complete remission following induction therapy is also unclear. Individuals with relapsed or refractory disease are treated with brentuximab vedotin if they did not receive the drug previously or had not received it in the previous 6 months. A small study reported overall response rates, complete response rates, and disease-free survival rates at 24 months of 63%, 45%, and 54%, respectively, using this regimen. Those who attain a complete response on this drug and can tolerate it are than treated with bone marrow transplantation. Finally, patients who fail or relapse on these treatments are given salvage therapy regimens that have been used for relapsed or refractory aggressive B cell malignancies such as GDP (i.e. gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin), DHAP, and ICE.

Drugs that inhibit ALK activity such as crizotinib and alectinib have been successful in establishing complete and partial remissions in a limited number of patients with advanced, refractory ALK-positive ALCL. These and other drugs are undergoing clinical trials to determine there safety and effectiveness in treating ALK-positive ALCL. (Also see clinical trials that use ALK inhibitors in ALK-positive ALCL and clinical trials that use ALK inhibitors in ALK-positive cancers.)

==ALK-negative anaplastic large-cell lymphoma==
===Signs and symptoms===
Unlike ALK-positive ALCL, ALK-negative ALCL tends to occur in older adults (median age at diagnosis: 55–60 years) and presents primarily with lymph node involvement; only 20% of patients with ALK-ALCL present with extra-nodal disease in sites such as the skin, bone, and soft tissues. Nonetheless, most individuals (~67%) present with advanced stage grade III or IV disease in which neoplastic infiltrates occur in multiple lymph node locations and/or extra-nodal sites. ALK autoantibodies are not found in this type of ALCL. The prognosis of ALK-negative ALCL is often quoted as being worse than that for ALK-positive ALCL but this may reflect the older age and advanced stage at which ALK-negative disease presents: studies comparing age- and grade-matched ALK-positive to ALK-negative ALCL patients show little differences in prognoses.

===Diagnosis===
The histology of ALK-negative ALCL, similar to ALK-positive ALCL, consist of &quot;hallmark&quot; cells that strongly express CD30. Unlike ALK-positive ALCL, however, ALK-negative ALC does not fall into different morphological patterns. The histological of this disease may overlap with and be difficult to distinguish from other CD30-positive T-cell lymphomas or the nodular sclerosis form of Hodgkin lymphoma. Cases in which ALK-negative ALCL is not distinguishable from the latter lymphomas are best diagnosed as peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTL, NOS). The histology of ALK-negative ALCL may also overlap with tumors of non–T-cell lineage such as various carcinomas. The differential diagnoses of ambiguous cases may be helped by examining the tumor cells for the expression of certain marker proteins. For example, expression of CD56, MUC1 (also termed EMA for epithelial membrane antigen), and clusterin and strong uniform expression of CD30 support the diagnosis of ALK-negative ALCL over PTL, NOS, while variable CD30 expression and extensive expression of T-cell receptor proteins favor PTCL-NOS over ALK-negative ALCL. Detection of certain gene abnormalities (see next section) may also help distinguishing these diseases.

===Gene and molecular abnormalities===
ALK-negative ALCL tumor cells show products made by chimeric genes: &quot;DUSP22-IRF4&quot; (many of which are fused at particular site and termed &quot;DUSP22-FRA7H&quot;) in 30% of the cases; &quot;TP63-TBL1XR1&quot; in 8% of cases; and &quot;NFKB2-ROS1, NCOR2-ROS1, NFKB2-TYK2&quot;, or &quot;PABPC4-TYK2&quot; in rare cases. They also show mutations in the &quot;JAK1&quot; and/or &quot;STAT3&quot; genes in 18% of cases; the &quot;MSC&quot; gene in 15% of cases, and the &quot;NOTCH1&quot; gene in 15% of cases. About 24% of cases have a truncated &quot;ERBB4&quot; gene. &quot;DUSP22&quot; gene rearrangements have been associated with favorable outcomes in ALK-negative ALCL while &quot;TP63&quot; gene arrangements are often associated with a poorer prognosis in various cancers. ALK-negative ALCL cells overexpress overactive STAT3 in 47% of cases and JAK1 in many cases. Many of these gene abnormalities appear to contribute to the development of ALK-negative ALCL.

===Treatment and prognosis===
The various treatments of ALK-negative ALCL generally follow those used for ALK-positive ALCL. However ALK-negative individuals more often present at an advanced stage of disease that requires intensive therapy. The aggressive treatments outline in the section on ALK-positive ALCL are used with the exception that patients with more favorable clinical and tumor tissue indicators as defined by having an International Prognostic Index score above 2 (particularly those who are under the age of 66) who obtain a complete remission after initial therapy are recommended for follow-up bone marrow transplantation. The International T-Cell Project reported on the treatment of 220 patients with ALK-negative ALCL; 15 received only supportive care, 168 were treated with anthracycline-containing chemotherapeutic regimens, 31 with anthracycline plus etoposide–containing chemotherapeutic regimens, 6 with other regimens; 16 with high-dose chemotherapy plus autologous stem cell bone marrow transplantation, and 4 with radiotherapy alone. Of the 205 patients that had more that supportive therapy, the overall and complete response rates were 77% and 63%, respectively. After a median follow-up of 52 months, the median progression free and overall survival times were 41 months and 55 months, respectively; 3- and 5-year progression-free rates were 52% and 43%, respectively; and 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 60% and 49%, respectively. Chemotherapy treatments containing both anthracycline and etoposide were associated with superior overall survival rates (3- and 5-years of 76% and 69%, respectively) compared to chemotherapy treatment regiments containing an anthracycline but not etoposide (3- and 5-year overall survival rates of 56% and 44%, respectively). Progression-free survival rates with the latter two types of chemotherapy treatment regimens were not appreciably different.

==Primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma==
===Signs and symptoms===
pcALCL is the second most common lymphoma in the category of Cutaneous T cell lymphoma cutaneous T cell lymphomas that includes lymphomatoid papulosis, various borderline CD30-positive cutaneous T cell lymphomas, and mycosis fungoides. The median age at diagnosis for pcALC is 61 years. The disease has a male predominance and appears to be more common in Caucasian populations. Individuals with pcALCL typically present with reddish masses that initially appear in the skin or, much less frequently, the lymph nodes or various organs. These masses are nodules or tumors that are often ulcerated, greater than 2 cm in diameter, and localized to a single site. In 20% of cases, however, they occur in multiple sites. In about 10% cases followed for many years, pcALCL presenting as skin lesions progresses to extracutaneous sites, mainly to regional draining lymph nodes. Over these same long periods, however, the disease&#x27;s lesions partially regress in about 50% of cases but then relapse in about 40% of cases.

===Diagnosis===
pcALCL lesions exhibit large malignant T-cells or null cells (i.e. cells lacking many T-cell receptor proteins) with &quot;Hallmark&quot; cell features of anaplasia, pleomorphism, and kidney- and horse shaped-nuclei. These lesions are often limited to the dermis but can extend into the surrounding subcutaneous tissue and/or epidermis. Rarely, the lesions, termed pyrogenic variants, are rich in polymorphonuclear neutrophils. The neoplastic cells strongly express CD30 (100% of cases), CD2 (78%), CD4 (54–90% of cases), cytotoxicity marker proteins, and various other marker proteins that help distinguish it from other ALCL, cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, and cancers. While these cells typically are ALK-negative, they do express ALK-containing fusion proteins in rare cases. The latter cases have a relatively benign course compared to ALK-positive ALCL and are treated as variants of pcALCL rather than ALK-positive ALCL.

===Gene and molecular abnormalities===
Similar to ALK-negative ALCL, pcALCL have chromosomal rearrangements in their &quot;DUSP22&quot; (20–30% of cases) and &quot;TP63&quot; (5% of cases) genes and a mutation in the &quot;MSC&quot; (i.e. &quot;musculin&quot;) gene (6% of cases). Between 1993 and 2019, the Dutch registry had 6 (i.e. 2%) of 319 pcALCL cases that expressed ALK. Three of these cases were due to the &quot;NPM1-ALK&quot; chimeric gene that predominates in ALK-positive ALCL while the remaining three were due to &quot;TRAF1-ALK, ATIC-ALK,&quot; or &quot;TPM3&quot;-ALK chimeric genes. All 6 patients shared exactly the same breakpoint site in the ALK at exon 20 on the &quot;ALK&quot; gene.

===Treatment and prognosis===
Most pcALCL individuals present with isolated lesions that are effectively managed with radical surgical excision and/or radiation therapies; this approach is regarded as front-line therapy for localized disease. However, individuals with extensive disease and/or multiple tissue involvement respond poorly to front line treatment. These as well as individuals who relapse after front-line therapy need further treatment. In one study of 65 patients with pcALCL, 95% treated with surgical excision achieved complete remission but 41% of them relapsed within 22 months while 64% of patients treated with surgery plus radiotherapy developed recurrent disease within 55 months. In another study of 135 patients with this disease, 39% had relapses limited to the skin, 15% developed extracutaneous disease, and 9% ultimately died from pcALCL. Individuals with refractory, recurrent, and/or extensive disease have been treated more aggressively. In various studies, 10 of 13 such patients responded within 4 weeks to treatment with the chemotherapeutic agent, methotrexate; 10 of 16 patients obtained complete remissions of their skin lesions when treated with the anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody, brentuximab verdotin, and 48 of 53 patients treated with the aggressive chemotherapeutic CHOP regimen had complete responses. However, most of these patients developed recurrent disease within four months. As currently recommended, brentuximab vedotin is use initially to treat widespread systemic disease; a single chemotherapeutic drug rather than aggressive combination chemotherapy with CHOP or similar regimens is used to treat patients not responding to brentuximab verdotin; aggressive chemotherapy regimens are used to treat widespread nodal and/of visceral disease and disease which failed on other regiments; and, although there is little data supporting this, employ allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for patients with multiple relapses that have progressed on systemic therapy. Recurrences, regardless of treatment type, are common. pcALCL has an estimated five-year failure-free survival rate of 55 percent. Nonetheless, the disease has a 10-year overall survival rate of 90%. Typically leg involvement portends a worse prognosis: it has a five-year disease-specific survival rate of 76 percent compared with 96 percent for disease in other locations. Involvement of local nodes alone in patients with skin lesions does not seem to portend an adverse prognosis.

==Breast implant-associated anaplastic large-cell lymphoma==
===Signs and symptoms===
BIA-ALCL is a complication of silicon-filled and saline-filled breast implants which develops 9 years to 10 years (median times) after surgical implantation. First described in 1997, it is estimated that the prevalence of BIA-ACLC in individuals with implants that have a textured surface is 1 in 30,000, with the highest risk being associated with polyurethane-coated implants, while the risk of it is 70-fold lower in individuals who have a smooth surface implant or have no implant at all (i.e. in patients that have another type of ALCL). These relations strongly suggest that BIA-ACLC develops primarily if not exclusively in patients with textured implants. In all cases, however, many researchers suspect that BIA-ALCL is an under-recognized, misdiagnosed, and under-reported complication of breast implants. Two-thirds of individuals with BIA-ALCL present with swelling, discomfort, and/or (rarely) pain in the affected breast. This is due to the development of a tumor mass and/or swelling caused by an effusion (i.e. fluid) that accumulates between the breast implant surface and the fibrous capsule that has grown around it. The effusion fluid typically contains white blood cells, tumor cells, and high levels of protein. Besides or in addition to breast swelling, patients present with a breast mass in 30% present of cases, enlarged lymph nodes in the armpit or around the chest clavicle bones in 20% of cases, and/or in a small percentage of cases lesions in more distant tissues. Rarely, patients have presented with skin rash or itching on or around the involved breast. Using the Ann Arbor staging system, 83% of patients present with stage 1 localized disease while the remaining 10, 0, and 7% of patients present with what is normally regarded as more aggressive stage II, III, or IV diseases, respectively. Thus, about 17% of individuals present with a more aggressive disease that has spread from its original breast implant site to nearby lymph nodes, to areas outside of the capsule, or to more distal tissues.

===Diagnosis===
In most individuals with BIA-ALCL, the affected breast has a thickened capsule around the implant and effusion fluid between the capsule and implant. Neoplastic cells are located in and typically limited to the capsule and effusion. Histological examination of the capsules shows large anaplastic cells but cells with all the features of ALCL &quot;hallmark&quot; are often difficult to detect. In addition to these neoplastic cells, the capsule lesions contain, sometimes in a large excess that makes diagnosis difficult, a variety of non-malignant cells such as small lymphocytes, histiocytes, and granulocytes (the granulocytes are mostly eosinophils). The histology of palpable masses exhibit a different pathological picture: the tumor masses have multinodular areas that consist of necrosis or fibrous tissue interspaced with areas that consist of large neoplastic cells that have abundant cytoplasm and abnormally shaped nuclei within a fibrotic and chronic inflammatory cell background. Again, typical ALCL-defining &quot;hallmark&quot; cells may be difficult to find in these masses. The effusions show abundant, uniform-appearing, non-cohesive large cells with irregularly-shaped nuclei, prominent nucleoli and abundant cytoplasm. The histology and pathological features of diseased lymph nodes and tissues outside of the breast implant are indistinguishable from those seen in ALK-negative ALCL. The neoplastic cells in the capsules, effusions, and tissues strongly and uniformly express CD30, CD4 (75–84% of cases), EMA (48–90%), CD43 (86–95%), CD45 (44–74%), and in a far fewer percentage of cases various other marker proteins. These cells do not express ALK and often lack the characteristic surface marker proteins of T-cells. Identification of the status of these markers helps diagnose the disease.

===Gene and molecular abnormalities===
No chromosome translocations, chimeric genes, or fusion proteins have been described in BIA-ALCL although the neoplastic cells in the disease have been described to have gene copy number variations involving gains in gene copies on the p arm of chromosome 19 and losses of gene copies in the p arms of chromosome 10 and 1. The neoplastic cells in BIA-ALCL show mutations of the &quot;STAT3&quot; gene in 64% of cases and reports of mutations in &quot;JAK1, JAK3, DNMT3A&quot;, and &quot;TP53&quot; genes. The development of BIA-ALCL, it has often been suggested, may be at least in part a T-cell-induced, inflammation-driven cancer response to the implant.

===Treatment and prognosis===
The treatment regimens for BIA-ALCL recommended by 1) a multidisciplinary expert review panel, 2) the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and 3) the French National Cancer Institute (Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament [ANSM]) are very similar, commonly used, and summarized here. BIA-ALCL staging is done to identify patients with BIA-ALCL confined to the implant, capsule, and effusion from more disseminated disease. The staging preferably employs the TMN system designed to stage solid tumors. This is based on historical data suggesting that BIA-ALCL progresses locally like solid tumors rather than liquid tumors such as other lymphomas. BIA-ALCL patients have surgical removal of the implant, capsule, and associated masses. Patients with localized disease (e.g. TMN stage 1A to 2A) that is completely excised by removal of the implant, the entire capsule, and any masses (must leave negative resection margins) receive no further therapy. About 85% of all BIA-ALCL patients should qualify to receive this treatment regimen. Patients with unresectable chest wall invasion, regional lymph node involvement (i.e. TMN Stage 2B to 4), or residual disease after surgery receive an aggressive adjuvant chemotherapy regimen such as EPOCH, CHOP, or CHOP plus etoposide. Alternatively, the immunotherapeutic drug, brentuximab vedotin, may be used as initial therapy alone or in combination with a chemotherapy regimen to treat disseminated disease. While larger studies are needed, case reports suggest that brentuximab vedotin may be effective frontline monotherapy, either after surgical excision or as primary treatment for unresectable BIA-ALCL. Radiation therapy has been used in cases that have unresectable chest wall invasion (NMN stage IIE). Although the number of cases evaluated is low, 93% of patients without a mass and 72% with a mass achieved complete remission; median survival for disease having a discrete breast mass was 12 years but was beyond 12 years and not reached over the study period for patients not having a discrete breast mass.

<text>The Japanese word Sosai (Japanese:総裁, &quot;Sōsai&quot;) means roughly &quot;president&quot; or &quot;director-general&quot;. It is used in several ways:

==Political==
*Sosai, or president of the government, was only once the title of the imperial prime minister: from 1 January 1868 (before there was no cabinet, only chief advisers: &quot;Kampaku&quot; to the nominally reigning emperor and both &quot;Rōjū&quot; and &quot;Tairō&quot; to the de facto ruling &quot;shōgun&quot;) until 11 June 1868: Prince Arisugawa Taruhito (1835–1895); next the prime ministerial office is styled &quot;U Daijin&quot; &quot;Ministers to the Right&quot;, in 1871 shortened to &quot;Daijin&quot;.
*Sosai also was the title of Admiral Takeaki Enomoto (1836–1908), the elected president (27 January 1869 – 27 June 1869) of the short-lived rebellious Ezo Republic on the present Hokkaidō Island, vanquished by Imperial troops.
*Sosai, or President of Liberal Democratic Party, is the office of the head of the LDP.

==Others==
This office also exist in various sports, in particular budō, business and charitable organizations. The term is also used to translate the head of various foreign organizations.

The most famous of such people is Sōsai Ōyama Masutatsu, who earned this appellation by creating a karate style called Kyokushinkai and spreading karate in the western world.

Mas Oyama is an exceptional icon to be called &quot;Sosai&quot; because of his contributions especially in the world of Martial Arts and in the overall history of Japan.</text><links>

<text>Sir Bertram de Criol (Criel, Crioill, Cyroyl, or Kerrial; died 1256) was a senior and trusted Steward and diplomat to King Henry III. He served as Constable and Keeper of Dover Castle, Keeper of the Coast and of the Cinque Ports, Keeper of the receipts, expenses and wardships of the archbishopric of Canterbury, Constable of the Tower of London and Sheriff of Kent.

==Background and origins==
The historian Nicholas Vincent agrees with the Duchess of Cleveland in deriving the de Criol family from Criel-sur-Mer, Seine-Maritime, though Planché favoured Creil, Oise, and Dunlop offered Creully, Calvados. In Battle Abbey Roll lists the Duchesne recension has the name as &quot;Escriols&quot;, the Anglicized &quot;Kyriel&quot; appearing in the earlier Auchinleck manuscript. Criel-sur-Mer is likely, because Robert, younger son of Robert, Count of Eu (d. c 1092), obtained it from his father, whose possession of Criel is shown from a charter to the Abbey of St-Michel du Tréport; in the Domesday Survey, Robert de Cruell held Esseborne (Ashburnham), Sussex, from his kinsman the Count of Eu, governor of the Rape of Hastings, and from these the de Criols and the ancient Ashburnham family are both supposed to descend. &quot;Bartholomew&quot; de Criol witnessed the confirmation charter of Henry, Count of Eu to Battle Abbey before 1140.

Bertram, or Bertrand, de Criol was the eldest son of John de Criol and his wife Margery. John is known principally for a grant of the advowson of Sarre, in Thanet (to Leeds Priory, Kent) in 1194, title to which he had (perhaps by marriage) inherited from Elias de Crevecoeur, (son of that priory&#x27;s founder), who had previously made a similar grant in 1138, confirmed by his Crevecoeur descendants. He may be the same John de Crioile alias Crihuil who granted to Henry de Cornhill his land and tenement at Wyvermerse (Essex) in c. 1179–82 in the presence of Prince John, Ranulf de Glanville, Hubert Walter, Roger fitzReinfrid and others, a residual claim to which was released to Hugh de Neville after 1216.
Whether the identification of Cecilia, wife of Simon d&#x27;Avranches (Lord of Folkestone, died c. 1203) as a de Criol is correct, or whether she was the daughter of Simon son of Simon de Brixworth and Beatrice de Fraxineto, is undecided. Bertram de Crioll appears in the scutage for Poitiers in 1214. He has half a knight&#x27;s fee in Sarre, from the Archbishop, in 1210–1212. Bertram&#x27;s connection with &#x27;&quot;his manor of Sarre&quot; is indicated by a market granted by the king in 1219 and regranted in 1226, for which Bertram de Crioil was to pay a palfrey. &quot;The Salt Water swellith yet up at a Creeke a Myle and more towards a Place called Sarre,&quot; says John Leland, &quot;which was the comune Fery when Thanet was full iled.&quot;

==Castle politics==
In 1221 Bertram de Criol, together with Thomas de Blundeville, Osbert Giffard and others, witnessed a charter of Hubert de Burgh, Chief Justiciar of England. granting the church of Portslade, West Sussex, to St. Radegund&#x27;s Abbey at Bradsole near Dover. In that year Hubert married Margaret of Scotland, and (at King Henry&#x27;s coming of age) in April 1228 he was granted the castles of Dover, Canterbury, Rochester and Montgomery for life.

De Criol, a member of Hubert&#x27;s household, became acting constable for him at Dover, where he carried out works in 1229, he and Robert de Auberville, castellan of Hastings and Warden of the ports from Portsmouth to Sandwich, being favoured by a writ &quot;de intendendo&quot; addressed to the barons of the Cinque Ports. In 1228 the king appointed him, with Alan Puignant, keepers of the vacant archbishopric of Canterbury, to manage revenues, payments and estates. With Stephen de Segrave and Ralph and William Briton, and many of the bishops, he witnessed the grant and confirmation of Hubert&#x27;s gift of Tunstall, Kent, to the archbishop in 1229.

Shortly before the king&#x27;s departure on a military expedition to Poitou in the spring of 1230, in which de Burgh accompanied him, an order was issued that Margaret was to be admitted to any of his castles without hindrance, and to have freedom of residence, and access to the wine cellars, at her pleasure. However, in October de Criol, who had been ordered not to let anyone in, stoutly refused to admit her to Dover Castle. As a result, he was dismissed, and in November he was deprived of his wardships by the king&#x27;s orders, including an estate at Kettleburgh in Suffolk, held in bail for Guy de la Val, and the manor of Moulsford, Berkshire, held during an heir&#x27;s minority, which was disputed with John Marshall.

De Criol and the king were reconciled in February 1231, and he was rehabilitated under the stricture that he could not plead his cause against de Burgh before the king&#x27;s court. In ordering the return of Moulsford, the king owned that the disseisin had been &quot;at the king&#x27;s will&quot;, a seeming trespass upon those rights in Magna Carta upon which de Burgh himself had insisted. De Criol was appointed Sheriff of Kent in June 1232: Hubert&#x27;s fall from grace followed weeks later.
In September de Criol had custody of Dover Castle under new auspices. He was at once entrusted with wardship of the lands and heirs of Simon de Chelefeld, a Kentish justiciar, pending their settlement upon Eleanor, Countess of Pembroke in December. Similarly he held Tonbridge Castle for the king until the wardship of Richard de Clare in his minority was settled upon Richard de la Lade in June 1234. His presence is recorded among the principals at Canterbury on 2 April 1234 at the consecration of Edmund Rich as Archbishop.

De Criol was appointed to the custody of the Cinque Ports in May 1236, the year of the King&#x27;s marriage. Ordered to deliver Rochester Castle to John de Cobham he had to yield the November issues to Cobham for accounting, and, being appointed Sheriff of Kent, he was to find county funds for repair works there. During 1237 his London agent Robert Hurlizun mediated delivery of 20,000 quarrels to him at Dover, and later that year he had two of the king&#x27;s galleys refitted and housed at Winchelsea. Works continued at Dover in 1238. During the summer his men had custody of a Saracen at Canterbury Castle.

==Constable of the Tower, 1240-1242==

At Midsummer 1239 de Criol became Sheriff of Essex, answering jointly with Richard de Grey for the second half of the year. On the morrow of St Edmund (21 November) 1239 the king met with his council at Winchester, Stephen de Segrave, brother Geoffrey his Almoner, Bertram de Criol his Seneschal, Master Simon de Steyland, Geoffrey le Despencer and other loyal men, and decreed a reform to moneylending arrangements between the Jews and the Christians of London. In December the king instructed his Treasurer Hugh de Pateshull, Phillip de Assellis and his fellow Justices of the Jews, Peter Grimbald and the Mayor, to send away the present Keepers of the &quot;Archae&quot; (chests, or &quot;arks&quot;, in which details of transactions were kept) and their clerks. Instead they, together with the Constable of the Tower of London and two good men chosen by them, should elect two Christian men and two Jews of London to whom the keeping of the Archae should be committed, each to have his own key, and two sworn clerks. Detailed instructions were given for the management and custody of their chirographs, and other matters affecting Jewish residency and practise.

By the beginning of 1240 de Criol was Constable of the Tower of London, and he held the position until the middle of 1242, latterly with the assistance of Walter de Gray. 
Humphrey de Bohun succeeded him as Sheriff in Kent. In the vacancy following the departure of Edmund Rich, his keeping of the archbishopric was assisted by John Maunsell. The constabulary of the Tower had &quot;rights thereto pertaining to the Jews&quot;. Records of the tallage of 20,000 marks upon the Jews of 1241 include de Criol&#x27;s letter to Jeremiah de Caxton and William Hardel, as Justices of the Jews, concerning remittances to Mosses the son of Josce Crespin the chirographer.

As one of four keepers of the King&#x27;s Treasure he brought the jewels of Leo de Melcstret to the Wardrobe and delivered large sums to the Treasurer William de Haverhull. In London he was among the dignitaries invited to witness the conveyance by Odo, melter in the king&#x27;s Exchequer, of his rights to Edward son of Odo the goldsmith, as the grantor prepared to leave for the Holy Land. Late in 1241 he joined distinguished company to witness the king&#x27;s grant to the Count of Aumale, and in January 1241/42 (at Westminster) witnessed the King&#x27;s renewal of franchise to the city of Cork. De Criol was granted a fee in Everlond (Overland, in Elham, Kent, close to a royal park) which was forfeited by Master Simon de Steyland the king&#x27;s clerk: and this de Criol&#x27;s heir still retained in 1253.

==War with France, 1242==
In March 1242, in view of the king&#x27;s French expedition, de Criol was re-appointed Sheriff of Kent and Constable of the castles of Dover and Rochester, and in April was ordered to hold Dover and to surrender it to no-one but the king himself, or (if the king should die) then to Eleanor the queen, or to one of her Savoy uncles not in the fealty of the King of France. The extent of de Criol&#x27;s tenures of knight&#x27;s fees in Kent at this date, and their fee-lords, can be read in the &quot;Testa de Nevill&quot;. 

In April de Criol was to test all the crossbows or ballistas at Dover and in the Tower for reliability. The Cinque Port barons were made intendant to de Criol as Constable at Dover. Custody of the archbishopric was granted to him jointly with Jeremiah de Caxton, de Criol himself freely taking responsibility before king and council for rendering accounts. He and Chancellor Ralph Neville surveyed the coast and arranged with the barons (including New Romney) for the defence of their ports.

He was to build four swift barges for the king, and to receive two galleys at Winchelsea sent from Bristol. The Lord Mayor of London was to send him 120 crossbowmen, and liveries were sent. Ships, crews and all the crossbowmen they had were summoned to him at Dover, five each from the bailiffs of Dunwich and Great Yarmouth, and four from Ipswich, Orford and Blakeney. Richard fitzReginald and Fulco fitzWarin were to follow his orders on land and sea, and to be ready at Winchester on 22 August. De Criol was not to impede the merchants of Brabant or of the Count of Flanders, but to take whatever provisions he could from the assets of the French king and of Henry Puchepap of Rye. Ten Winchelsea ships and a galley were to be sent to the king at Portsmouth, and then twenty from the Cinque Ports for the soldiers. In August he took securities from the Viscount de Beaumont, going into Scotland, against the possibility of betrayal. He delivered £100 to the barons of Winchelsea for their maintenance in the war.

De Criol and his clerk Henry de Wengham took in the king&#x27;s share of booty brought from France to the Cinque Ports, Nicholas de Hadlo assisting, with authority over the port barons. He had to rectify many claims from Flanders and elsewhere for the return of wool and wine wrongly seized. He was to hear the complaints against men of Winchelsea at Shipwey, &quot;the place that was of auncient time honested with the Plees and assemblies of the Five Portes.&quot; He brought Henry Puchepap to trial for receiving goods plundered from Flemish merchants. Security in his ports, and transport to and from France, emissary or mercantile, was strictly under his view by royal warrant. In the following February the barons of Winchelsea and the Cinque Ports were, with de Criol&#x27;s counsel, &quot;to furnish all the galleys they can to grieve the king&#x27;s enemies by sea and land so long as the war lasts with France.&quot;

===Croxton Kerrial, 1242===

In May 1242 the King granted to de Criol and to his heirs the manor of Croxton (Croxton Kerrial, Leicestershire, named from this family) in part exchange for Kettleburgh (near Framlingham Castle), the formerly sequestrated manor. To this were added lands in the manor of Lechton, Sussex (probably Laughton), held by the king in bail from the Queen&#x27;s uncle Peter II, Count of Savoy, to be held in interim by Bertram for the service of a pair of white gloves. Croxton manor had formerly been a possession of Hubert de Burgh&#x27;s: the nearby Premonstratensian abbey of Croxton received repeated gifts from Henry, because the heart of his father King John was buried in the church of St John the Evangelist there. By 1246 Croxton manor had passed to Bertram&#x27;s kinsman Nicholas de Crioll, who was granted a market and fair. But the heirs of Hamo de Valoignes, whom de Criol had in charge, he delivered to William de Cantilupe, to whom their marriages were granted.

==Works and duties==
An adjustment to scutage for Bertram and his sons was extended to John and Simon de Criol and to Nicholas de Hadlou. He received orders in April 1243 to prevent the embarcation of the Master of the Knights Templar in England to answer the summons of the Grand Master to Jerusalem. Four silver bowls were sent for him to place before the shrine of St Thomas at Canterbury.

Preparations for the marriage of Richard, Earl of Cornwall to the queen&#x27;s sister Sanchia in November 1243 involved de Criol and Caxton in many duties. The hire of ships, boats and galleys, the wages of mariners and serjeants, etc., for the transport of Beatrice Countess of Provence, Sanchia, and their household, and the conveyance of wine from Sandwich to Dover and Canterbury were met from the Canterbury issues. A great sum was expended on candles for the Canterbury churches for the arrival of the Countess, and the keepers had the cost of her journey home. In December 1243 de Criol witnessed the covenant made between the King and Earl Richard. Payments were made for the carriage of many fowl and swans to the king&#x27;s kitchen at Westminster, and for the king&#x27;s huntsmen, over the next months.
Responsibility for Kentish works fell to the Sheriff during 1244, especially for a building to contain the king&#x27;s engines at Dover, for the repair or rebuilding of houses for the king&#x27;s galleys at Rye, and for the installation at Dover of the catapult, trebuchet and ram, but all under the supervision of de Criol as Constable. De Criol and Caxton saw to the repair of the gate buildings at Canterbury Castle. He was occupied with the king&#x27;s interdictions: during the spring of 1244 armed Scotsmen were to be sought out and arrested, and merchant ships in the ports were not permitted to sail. A year later, religious persons of any kind arriving were to be held and searched for letters, and not permitted to proceed without the king&#x27;s approval. In May 1246 he was to appoint custodians in every port to prevent English coin being taken out, and no ship, or anything from which a ship could be made, was to be sold to anyone in fealty to the King of France. He completed repairs to the walls at Rye and Winchelsea, and received contributions for his court at Shipway.
Meanwhile, the king sent gifts of bucks from the park at Elham, and Nicholas de Croill, royal groom (&quot;vadlettus&quot;), was sent hunting for them. Bertram received a goshawk from Hubert de Rewley, the king&#x27;s fine for a market at Cattawade, by Orwell Haven. Liveried chaplains were appointed for divine service at Dover Castle in 1246, and in 1247 three silver chalices, a censer, and quantities of orphrey, samite and other precious cloths for making chasubles and dalmatics for the Castle chapels, including the pre-conquest church of St Mary in Castro, were supplied to de Criol. The King was then engaged in his new works at Westminster Abbey, and was soon to proclaim the Relic of the Holy Blood. Dover Castle&#x27;s best hospitality, at the King&#x27;s expense, was required for Baldwin II, Emperor of Constantinople, on his journey home in April 1247, but the Constable was to pay his whole passage. In August he was to prepare a good ship at Sandwich equipped for horses and men to be the king&#x27;s messengers on a secret errand.

De Criol delivered the castles of Rochester and Canterbury to Nicholas de Ores, Sheriff of Kent, in November 1248. At Easter 1249 he, with two other knights, was sent to the Duchy of Gascony for four months on the king&#x27;s service, being required to deliver £1000 by weight to Simon de Montfort, its viceroy. Nicholas de Crioll was in Gascony with him for the same period. He made arrangements for the transport of Earl Richard &quot;and others of the king&#x27;s faithful men on his errand over seas&quot;, and for two voyages of John de Newburgh (the king&#x27;s chaplain) as king&#x27;s messenger, in the following year.

In February 1251 a delegate for the bailiwick of the Cinque Ports was required of him to join the sheriffs in their commission into money counterfeiting and false exchange. Great were the arrangements of August and September 1252, when the port barons were to make ready 60 ships to cross from Portsmouth in the first week of October. As the crisis in Gascony came to a head, de Criol witnessed the King&#x27;s mandate requiring support for a truce among that people, instructing them not to obey Simon de Montfort if he oppose it. After witnessing special privileges granted to William of Kilkenny, soon to be the king&#x27;s Chancellor, in the summer of 1253 he was to prevent any count, baron or magnate leaving for France without royal licence. On 2 October Queen Eleanor and Earl Richard sent orders requiring him to oversee in person the preparation at Winchelsea and Rye of two ships and crews, armed with crossbowmen, to carry the king and his treasure (&quot;thesaurus&quot;) to Gascony from Portsmouth 11 days later.

==Services and rewards==
Meanwhile, he was granted further wardship of the Bendenges estates, and rights to a market and annual fair at his manors of Monigeham and Shoueldon, Kent, and at his manor of Poppeshall (Buckland, Kent), with free warren there and in Cherry Hinton, Cambridgeshire (which he had acquired by exchange with Peter of Savoy) in September 1252. In June 1252 he witnessed the King&#x27;s Letters Patent of Incorporation to Faversham, and in August his confirmation charter to Bristol. He was made King&#x27;s Justice to receive William Pundelarche, an outlaw, into the king&#x27;s peace, and with his son Simon and kinsman Nicholas he witnessed the resultant grant to William de Valencia. He was not, however, to permit the Earl of Pembroke to make any embarcation. He was granted wardship and marriage of Helen and Isabel, daughters of Maud de Avranches, one of whom married his grandson.

Seizures of ships, imprisonments of men, manslaughter, and other claims of damages and injuries arose between the barons of Winchelsea and the men of Yarmouth, and he was called upon to summon the barons and bailiffs in February 1253. Meanwhile, the king deferred settlement of the long arrearages owed to Dover Castle by Robert de Nevill, but always looked to de Criol to ensure the regular delivery of his Gascon wines from Sandwich to Westminster. In June 1253, with the king&#x27;s councillors, he witnessed Henry&#x27;s charters of confirmation and free warren to Battle Abbey, and his &quot;inspeximus&quot; charter to the Weavers&#x27; Guild of London, and in July to the burgesses of Reading. As from Portsmouth, he issued a grant to the sons of Jocelin de Oye (sometime King&#x27;s Serjeant, and one of the keepers of the King&#x27;s Works) to be conferred by the Queen and Earl Richard.

De Criol himself received a grant of 640 marks a year for the keeping of Dover Castle, so long as he be its keeper, over and above the castle guard rents, the issues and tolls of the town of Dover already granted. He was therewith notified that, in case of the King&#x27;s death, the castle should not be given into the charge of Prince Edward during his minority without Queen Eleanor&#x27;s assent. In February 1255 there remained £406 8s 11d owing to him of his annual payment of £426. 13s 4d, for the keeping of Dover Castle for the Easter and Michaelmas terms of the previous year. In settlement he received 227 quarters of wheat, 425 quarters of barley, 75 quarters of oats, 125 tuns of wine and 500 lbs. of wax out of the castle&#x27;s munition stock, as appraised by the barons of the Exchequer. In March he was called to supervise the clearing and felling of old oaks and chestnuts for timber in Kent and the Weald, for sale on the king&#x27;s behalf.

Upon the arrival of Eleanor of Castile at Dover in 1255, Henry sent orders that she should at once celebrate the feast of St Edward (13 October) at Canterbury, which de Criol and three others were to provide and superintend. At this time his sons John and Simon de Criol were also in duty to Dover Castle. The king did not forget his gifts, and in July 1253, granting six bucks for de Criol and four hinds for his wife, he thoughtfully instructed the park keeper to give him advice and help in catching them. The family origin of Emma de Criol, Bertram&#x27;s wife, is undecided.

==A diplomatic mission, and death==
In January 1256, he was granted &quot;Power to John Mansell, Provost of Beverley, and Bertram de Crioyl to make, extend and confirm a truce between the king of France and his brothers and their adherents, and the king, Edward the king&#x27;s son, the king&#x27;s brothers and their adherents, from the feast of St. Rémy (13 January), when the truce made between the king of France and the king by Simon de Monte Forti, earl of Leicester and Peter de Sabaudia, for three years more after this date ends; with power to them to swear on the king&#x27;s soul that he will observe it.&quot;
Within six months, by June 1256, he had died. A Pardon was granted to his heirs and executors, &quot;in consideration of their having remitted to the king all his debts to the said Bertram, of all the said Bertram&#x27;s debts to the king; and also of all accounts and reckonings for all receipts and expenses and wardships of the archbishopric of Canterbury, the castle of Dover, and the county of Kent for the whole time that he had the keeping thereof, by the order of the king; and of all other wardships and bailiwicks which he held of the king from the time that he was in the king&#x27;s service until the time of his death: so that his executors may have free administration of his goods.&quot; And since John Maunsell, king&#x27;s clerk, was for some time attendant to the keeping of the archbishopric with the said Bertram, without whom he could not make due reckoning of the debts and issues for that period of time, the king released John of all reckonings and demands that might be made in that regard. A similar remission was made to Stephen de Bokland, de Criol&#x27;s clerk.

De Criol was a most important figure in King Henry&#x27;s rule, and appears to have held loyally to him throughout. The records of payments of his salary are numerous in the Rolls, often expressing that they must be paid immediately. His son or near kinsman Nicholas de Crioll was for a time Constable of Dover Castle during the early 1260s. The burial place may have been in Battle Abbey, or possibly in the Premonstratensian abbey of St Radegund at Bradsole, near Dover, an Order of which the de Aubervilles and de Criols were patrons. John Leland remarked, &quot;Certen of the Crealles were honorably biried at S. Radegund. Creaulles were greate benefactors to Houses of Religion in &quot;Est Kent&quot;, as appereth by their Armes in many Glase-Windois.&quot; De Criols bore &quot;Or two chevrons and a canton gules&quot;, rendered in a 13th-century source as &quot;Bertram de Criol, d&#x27;or ove deux chevrons et ung quartier de goules&quot;.

Matthew Paris provides an epitaph:&quot;Et circa dies illos obiit dominus Bertrammus de Criol, domini regis dapifer et Doveriae opidanus et custos fidelissimus.&quot;(And in those days died lord Bertram de Criol, steward of the lord king and most faithful citizen and keeper of Dover.)

==Family==
Bertram de Criol had two identified sons:

* Sir John de Criol, &quot;son and heir&quot;. John married in or before 1233 to Matilde de Eastwelle (died 1267), whose mother Margeria was living at the time of her death. In 1258 John received royal letters of protection for his intended journey to Santiago (in Galicia). Richard de Clare is said to have died at John&#x27;s manor of Ashenfield (Hesmeresfeld) at Waltham in 1262. Sir John died in 1264. They were the parents of 
** Sir Bertram de Criol, who did homage for his father&#x27;s lands in 1264, and was heir to his mother in 1267. He married Alianora, one of the four daughters and co-heirs of Hamo de Crevecoeur and Matilda (Maud) de Avranches. Sir Bertram died in 1295. Their children included
*** John de Criol (born c.1261), who was aged 34 in 1295: died without issue before 1302.
*** Bertram de Criol: died without issue in 1306.
*** Joan de Crioll, who married Sir Richard de Rokesley. They sold the manor of Aldbury in 1309.
* Sir Simon de Criol. Simon married Matilda, daughter and heir of William de Esseteford (of Ashford, Esturt and Packmanstone in Newchurch). In 1252 he was granted immunity from coroner, assize or jury service for life, but in 1258 he was one of four knights selected for Kent for the bringing of inquisitions into trespasses and damages. Matilda was living at her husband&#x27;s death in 1267.
** Simon and Matilda had eight sons, who in 1267 were aged 30, 24, 23, 20, 16, 14, 12 and 11. These sons had an inheritance partible by gavelkind.

In 1245/6 Sir John and Sir Simon were together jurors in the inquisition post mortem upon Thomas de Normanville, lord of Kennington, Kent, which constituted part of the barony of the &quot;constabularie&quot; of Dover.

* The relationship of Nicholas de Crioll (fl. 1240–1272) to Bertram is not specified. He is not mentioned in the 1243 scutage payment, where he would be expected. By 1246 Nicholas held the manor of Croxton Kerrial in Leicestershire granted to Bertram and his heirs by King Henry in 1242. Nicholas also became Constable of Dover Castle and Keeper of the Coast. He married Joan de Auberville, daughter of William de Auberville the younger, whose grandfather William the elder was married to Matilda (Maud), one of the three daughters of Ranulf de Glanville. Nicholas witnessed the De Clare and Puntdelarche charters in company with Simon de Criol, and obtained from the king a remission of £12 owing on the estate of John de Criol when John&#x27;s son Bertram inherited it in 1264. He remarried to Margery, believed to have been daughter of Simon de Cray, who survived until 1319 and remarried into the Clifford family. His son by Joan, 
** Nicholas de Crioll, married Margaret, daughter of Galfred Pecche.

<text>John Scott (9 January 1731 – 12 December 1783), known as Scott of Amwell, was an English landscape gardener and writer on social matters. He was also the first notable Quaker poet, although in modern times he is remembered for only one anti-militarist poem.

==Life==

John Scott was the son of a successful London draper who later retired to Amwell House in the Hertfordshire village of Great Amwell and worked from there as a maltster. The family were Quakers and John&#x27;s elder brother Samuel (1719–88) eventually settled in Hertford as a Quaker minister. Scott stayed at home and undertook the improvement of the grounds from 1760, modelling them on those of William Shenstone at the Leasowes, which he visited. Its principal feature was a grotto consisting of six subterranean rooms whose surfaces were covered in flints, shells and minerals,
:Where glossy pebbles pave the varied floors,
:And rough flint-walls are deck&#x27;d with shells and ores,
:And silvery pearls, spread o&#x27;er the roofs on high,
:Glimmer like faint stars in a twilight sky. 
His poem &quot;The Garden&quot; goes on to reject the formal style of garden for Shenstone’s ideal of a managed wilderness. On visiting it, the celebrated Samuel Johnson declared that &quot;none but a poet could have made such a garden.&quot; The grotto continued as a tourist attraction into Victorian times but, having then fallen out of use, was restored in 1991 as &quot;the most complete of the grotto-builder’s art&quot;.
Scott lacked a full or satisfactory education and had only come to a knowledge of poetry through friendship with a bricklayer autodidact, whose daughter Sarah Frogley he eventually married in 1767. She died in childbirth the following year and in 1770 he married Maria De Horne, by whom he had a daughter, also named Maria. In 1773 he published his social &quot;Observations on the present state of the parochial and vagrant poor&quot;, a criticism of the Poor Law which was approved, although its recommendations did not gain parliamentary support. He was also celebrated as an expert on the turnpike roads, on which he wrote in 1773 and expanded in 1778 under the title &quot;A Digest of the Highway and General Turnpike Laws&quot;. He was an active member of three Hertfordshire turnpike trusts and his book was later praised as by &quot;the ablest Turnpike Trustee of his time&quot; Another political pamphlet, &quot;The Constitution Defended&quot;, was a reply to Samuel Johnson’s &quot;False Alarm&quot; (1770).

Scott had been making occasional visits to London since 1760 and there made the acquaintance of John Hoole, who introduced him to Dr Johnson. Though they disagreed politically, Johnson remarked that &quot;he loved Mr Scott&quot; and meant to write his life, although death intervened before he could do so.
Scott himself died of a fever caught during a visit to London in 1783. After his death his &quot;Critical essays on several English poets&quot; was published in 1785, together with a life of him written by John Hoole. These had originated from Scott&#x27;s dissatisfaction with some of the essays in Johnson’s recent &quot;Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets&quot; and was meant to supply a corrective view.

==Poetry==
Scott’s preferred method of composing poetry was described by Hoole as taking place after the rest of the family were in bed, when &quot;it was frequently his custom to sit in a dark room, and when he had composed a number of lines, he would go into another room where a candle was burning, in order to commit them to paper.&quot;
His earliest published works outside of magazines were the “Four Elegies descriptive and moral” (1760). In the fashion of Gray&#x27;s Elegy, these record the passing of the seasons rather than an individual and were written in cross-rhymed quatrains. Such writing was not to the taste of Dr Johnson who, when Boswell urged that Scott was “a very middle-rate poet, who pleased many readers”, argued that only excellence was admirable. Afterwards it was not until 1776 that Scott published “Amwell, a descriptive poem” in blank verse that takes the almost Wordsworthian stance that the countryside with which he became acquainted “in early youth… gave rapture to my soul; and often still on life’s calm moments sheds serener joy.” It was after this poem that he became known as Scott of Amwell in the 18th century.
Later he published his “Moral Eclogues” (1778), followed soon after by his collected &quot;Poetical Works&quot; (1782), which was to be reprinted in 1786 and 1795 and later included in omnibus volumes in 1808 and 1822. The portrait prefixed to his works is not a correct likeness and caused Scott dissatisfaction. Among several other illustrations in the body of the book were two vignettes and two oval plates by the young William Blake.

Particular itemisation is one facet of Scott&#x27;s style, avoiding the generalised Augustan diction of earlier poets:
::There spread the wild rose, there the woodbine twin&#x27;d;
::There stood green fern, there o&#x27;er the grassy ground
::Sweet camomile and ale-hoof spread around;
::And centaury red, and yellow cinquefoil grew,
::And scarlet campion and cyanus blue;
::And tufted thyme, and marjoram&#x27;s purple bloom,
::And ruddy strawberries yielding rich perfume. 
There is a wide range of literary and geographical reference as well. Two poems respond to the work of Mark Akenside and there is a sonnet on Shenstone’s elegies. The “Mexican Prophecy” is set at the time of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire and in his “Oriental Eclogues” Scott follows the example of William Collins by writing three set in Arabia, India and China. The last of these deals with the historical poet Li Po.

He protested in his &quot;Letter to the Critical Reviewers&quot; that not all his poems were included in the &quot;Poetical Works.&quot; Twelve unpublished poems are among his papers at the Friends&#x27; Library or in other letters to friends. They include four long odes and four sonnets, numbered V-VIII, which he may have planned to include in a cooperative volume with Joseph Cockfield.

The poem by which Scott is most remembered now is “The Drum” (Ode 13), an anti-war poem beginning “I hate that drum’s discordant sound” which was widely reprinted after its publication. In England it was set as a vocal piece by Benjamin Frankel as part of his “8 Songs” (Op. 32, 1959), and later by Christopher Dowie. In the 21st century it has been set to music by the Quaker composer Ned Rorem as the opening piece in his song cycle &quot;Aftermath&quot; (2001), an immediate pacifist reaction to the vengeful spirit that followed the attacks of 9/11. There was also a later US setting for choir and snare drum by William F. Funk in 2004, and in Canada it was set by Robert Rival as the sixth in his cycle &quot;Red Moon and other songs of war&quot; (2007).

<text>Allerton High School is a coeducational secondary school and sixth form located in Alwoodley, Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. It is situated around 500 metres north of the A6120 Leeds Outer Ring Road, north of the Moor Allerton shopping centre and east of St Stephen&#x27;s church. The head teacher is Elaine Silson.

==History==
===Grammar school===
The school was opened in 1939 as a girls&#x27; grammar school by the City of Leeds Education Committee. The school had previously been located on Harrogate Road, near Stainbeck Lane, since 1901, and moved to Moor Allerton in 1939.

In the 1960s it had around 700 girls.

===Comprehensive===
In 1972, boys were included in the student body and the school became a 13–18 comprehensive. It later became an 11–18 comprehensive, and in 1992 underwent a physical expansion.

==Current buildings==
The school moved into new buildings on 1 September 2008, and there was a formal opening by Prime Minister Gordon Brown on 28 November 2008. Planning permission was granted on 30 July 2021 for the construction of four modular teaching blocks (eight classrooms vertically stacked in two pairs including associated stair pods) for temporary use over two years.

==Other information==
The school has a standard uniform, comprising a dark green V-necked top printed with the school logo, a white shirt, a green and white school tie, a dark green skirt (girls only) or black trousers (either sex), and black shoes (heels to be no higher than 5 cm) with black socks. A dark green or black headscarf may be worn.
The school is involved in the &quot;Excellence in Cities&quot; initiative. Its motto was formerly &quot;In Minimis Fidelis&quot; (Be faithful in little things) but is now &quot;Enabling Young People To Achieve Success&quot;. 
The new building includes a substantial multi-faith centre.

The school was used in 2010 for the filming of &quot;Married Single Other&quot;, making it one of a small number in Leeds to be used on television including Allerton Grange School and Foxwood School.

==Notable former pupils==
* Soul singer Corinne Bailey Rae attended in the 1990s and became head girl.
* Celebrity chef Marco Pierre White attended the school but left without any qualifications.
* Singer/Songwriter, author and radio personality Jason Feddy attended from 1979-1983.

===Girls&#x27; grammar school===
* Fanny Waterman, piano educator and concert pianist who founded the Leeds International Pianoforte Competition (educated at Chapel Allerton High School, the predecessor), and also later taught at the school on King Lane from 1943.
* Helen Williams, director of school Curriculum and pupil well-being at the Department for Education since 2006, married to David Forrester, director from 1995 to 2001 of further education and youth training at the DfEE.

<doc id="1034779" wikidata="Q1287667" url="?curid=1034779" title="The Man Trap">
<text>&quot;The Man Trap&quot; is the first broadcast episode of season one of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by George Clayton Johnson and directed by Marc Daniels, it featured design work by Wah Chang and first aired in the United States on September 8, 1966.

In the episode, the crew visit an outpost on planet M-113 to conduct routine medical exams on the residents using a Tricorder, only to be attacked by an alien that appears to change shape, and kills by extracting salt from the victim&#x27;s body.

This was the first &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode to air on television, although the sixth to be filmed; it was chosen as the first of the series to be broadcast by the studio due to the horror plot. &quot;The Man Trap&quot; placed first in the timeslot with a Nielsen rating of 25.2 for the first half-hour and 24.2 for the remainder. It aired two days earlier on Canadian network CTV.

== Plot ==
The USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; arrives at planet M-113 to provide supplies and medical exams for the only known inhabitants of the planet, Professor Robert Crater (Alfred Ryder) and his wife Nancy (Jeanne Bal), who operate an archaeological research station there. Captain Kirk, Chief Medical Officer Dr. Leonard McCoy, and Crewman Darnell (Michael Zaslow) transport to the surface as Kirk teases McCoy about his affection for Nancy ten years earlier. They arrive in the research station, and each of the three men sees Nancy differently: McCoy as she was when he first met her, Kirk as she should look accounting for her age, and Darnell as an attractive blonde woman whom he met on a pleasure planet. When Nancy goes out to fetch her husband, she beckons Darnell to follow her.

Professor Crater is reluctant to be examined, telling Kirk that they only require salt tablets. Before McCoy can complete the examination, they hear a scream from outside. They find Darnell dead, with red ring-like mottling on his face, a plant root in his mouth, and Nancy standing over him saying she was unable to stop Darnell from tasting the plant. On board &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Spock analyzes the plant. He confirms that it is poisonous, but that mottling is not a symptom. McCoy conducts a medical exam and, together with Spock, determines that all the salt was drained from Darnell&#x27;s body. In response, Kirk transports back down to the planet with McCoy and two crewmen, Green (Bruce Watson) and Sturgeon (John Arndt). Kirk tells Professor Crater that he and his wife should stay aboard the Enterprise until they find out what killed Darnell. Crater then runs off trying to find Nancy. Nancy kills both Sturgeon and Green; their faces show the same mottling as Darnell. Nancy assumes the form of Green, and meets Kirk and McCoy. They beam back up to the ship with Sturgeon&#x27;s body.

&quot;Green&quot; roams the corridors, stalking several crew members, killing one. It takes the form of McCoy after confirming that the real McCoy has taken a sedative to sleep. Meanwhile, Spock confirms that scans show only one person, Crater, on the planet; Kirk and Spock beam down to capture him. They find Green&#x27;s body before Crater tries to frighten them away with phaser fire. After they stun him with a phaser beam, the dazed Crater reveals that the real Nancy was killed by the creature – the last member of a long-dead civilization of shape-shifters who feed on salt – a year earlier. The creature continued to take on the appearance of Nancy out of affection for Crater, and he has been feeding it, comparing it to the &quot;now-extinct buffalo&quot;. Kirk informs &quot;Enterprise&quot; of the creature&#x27;s intrusion, as the landing party and Crater transport back to the ship.

Crater refuses to help them identify the creature, so Kirk orders the fake &quot;McCoy&quot; to administer truth serum. Kirk arrives in sickbay to find Crater dead and Spock injured; Spock&#x27;s Vulcan blood made him incompatible with the creature&#x27;s needs. Back in its &quot;Nancy&quot; form, the creature goes to McCoy&#x27;s quarters. Kirk arrives with salt tablets to lure the creature and a phaser if he provokes the creature into attacking. McCoy hesitates giving the creature the opportunity to feed on the salt tablets, boosting its energy then it attacks Kirk. Spock arrives and goes hand to hand against the creature, who retaliates, slapping him against the wall. The creature reverts to its natural appearance and starts to feed on Kirk as McCoy, stunned, stares in disbelief. Once Kirk screams, McCoy opens fire with his phaser. The creature changes back into the shape of &quot;Nancy&quot; to plead for its life. McCoy asks forgiveness, then fires again, killing it. As &quot;Enterprise&quot; leaves orbit, Kirk comments to Spock that he was thinking about the buffalo.

== Production ==

=== Writing ===
&quot;The Man Trap&quot; appeared in Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s original pitch for &quot;Star Trek&quot; as the title of a show with a different plot: the crew face several apparitions that are &quot;wish-fulfilment traps which become as real as flesh and blood&quot;; the traps increase in subtlety until the crew struggle to differentiate between apparition and reality. Lee Erwin, who had previously worked on &quot;The Lieutenant&quot; with Roddenberry, was commissioned to produce a treatment; an outline featuring a salt-devouring vampire was handed in on April 8, 1966. Meanwhile, George Clayton Johnson had been assigned a storyline, tentatively titled &quot;Chicago II&quot;, in which the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; visit a planet where the culture was that of 1920s mob-era Chicago, which later evolved into &quot;A Piece of the Action&quot;. Johnson was hired after story editor John D. F. Black recommended him to the producers. Johnson decided to use the 1953 science fiction novel &quot;The Syndic&quot; by Cyril M. Kornbluth as the basis for the story. Roddenberry felt that Johnson&#x27;s treatment did not match his vision for &quot;Star Trek&quot;, but did not want to lose him entirely, and asked him to write &quot;The Man Trap&quot;. Erwin was paid in full for his version, and given a separate &quot;kill fee&quot; because it would not be used.

Roddenberry wanted to see more action, so the creature&#x27;s ability to create apparitions was added to the script from the original pitch. Stan Robertson at NBC suggested to Roddenberry that they might wish to get medical advice over whether the draining of a chemical from a person would kill them instantly. To find out, Roddenberry asked Kellam de Forest Research, who said that, while it had never happened in reality, a quick death would be likely. Johnson suggested that the creature in &quot;The Man Trap&quot; could be the last of its species. He compared its situation to the reduction in numbers of American bison. Roddenberry found the idea intriguing.
Erwin was paid a further fee to terminate his contract, and Johnson wrote a first draft teleplay titled &quot;Damsel With a Dulcimer.&quot; While writing, Johnson consulted Black, who advised him to place the creature on the &quot;Enterprise&quot; quickly to increase the pace of the episode. This draft was delivered on May 23, but NBC felt that hallucinations were being overused; the same plot device had appeared in the pilot episode &quot;The Cage&quot;. Johnson wrote a further draft on May 31, which reduced the number of apparitions, and was well received by Robert H. Justman. Roddenberry and Justman made further tweaks; one was to restore the name &quot;The Man Trap&quot; from Erwin&#x27;s original treatment, another removed a scene which introduced McCoy&#x27;s apprehension when using the transporter. Johnson further edited the script, but complained about the change in name. After a second edit by Johnson, it was passed from Justman to story editor Black. While the former felt that the script still needed work, Black felt it was nearly ready. Following Black&#x27;s review, Roddenberry re-wrote the script between June 16 and 21. Johnson felt this re-write had &quot;downgrad[ed] the story.&quot;

Black later said that Roddenberry removed a large part of Johnson&#x27;s work, and that Johnson&#x27;s original work was better than Roddenberry&#x27;s edited version. Johnson was pleased with the final episode, although he was concerned that viewers might not understand &quot;Star Trek&quot; after watching &quot;The Man Trap&quot; owing to differences in characterization between this episode and the rest of the series. He admitted that he did not like Spock and was concerned that the character would not be understood after this episode. Roddenberry was pleased with Johnson&#x27;s work, and offered him further writing work on &quot;What Are Little Girls Made Of?&quot;, which had been written by Robert Bloch. Roddenberry only wanted Johnson to &quot;polish&quot; the script; Johnson, feeling he was unable to improve it without starting from scratch, turned down the offer, but expressed the desire to work on the show again. He later wrote a story outline titled &quot;Rock-A-Bye Baby, or Die!&quot; in which the &quot;Enterprise&quot; would have become a childlike sentient being who idolizes Kirk as its father. This was not commissioned, so &quot;The Man Trap&quot; was Johnson&#x27;s only work on the franchise.

===Guest appearances===
Jeanne Bal was cast as Nancy Crater, McCoy&#x27;s former love interest; the actress had previously guest-starred in &quot;Perry Mason&quot; and was one of the main performers in the sitcom &quot;Love and Marriage&quot;. Alfred Ryder was well known for his numerous appearances in similar genre series such as &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; and &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;. After his appearance as Robert Crater in &quot;The Man Trap&quot;, he appeared in the science fiction series &quot;The Invaders&quot;.

Actors playing two of the crewmen who died on screen later appeared in other episodes of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Michael Zaslow, seen in &quot;The Man Trap&quot; as Darnell, appeared in &quot;I, Mudd&quot;, and later had a long-running role in the soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot; as Roger Thorpe. John Arndt appeared in four further episodes of the original series.

===Direction and filming===
All previous episodes of &quot;Star Trek&quot; had overrun their filming schedules, and the producers were concerned that not enough time had been allotted to each production. Marc Daniels was recruited as director of &quot;The Man Trap&quot;; among his varied directing credits were episodes of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; for Desilu Productions. Pre-production began during the six scheduled filming days for &quot;The Enemy Within&quot;, but that episode ran long. Filming for &quot;The Man Trap&quot; commenced around 3:20 p.m. on June 22 and continued until 7:10 p.m. Several futuristic-looking salt shakers were sourced for scenes in &quot;The Man Trap&quot;, but due to concerns that they would not be recognized, they were instead used from &quot;The Man Trap&quot; onward as McCoy&#x27;s tools in sickbay.

The first full day of filming on June 23 was predominantly shot on the set representing the bridge of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Two small establishing shots were postponed until the filming of the next episode. The following day, corridor scenes were filmed, as was the climactic scene featuring the creature&#x27;s death. At that point, Daniels estimated that he was only a third of a day behind schedule. After a break for the weekend, production resumed on June 27 for scenes in the botany lab, the briefing room and sickbay. One of Grace Lee Whitney&#x27;s favorite sets to work on throughout the series was the lab, which was the sickbay redecorated, as she enjoyed working with George Takei. The animated plant in that scene was a hand puppet controlled from under the table, and Whitney later recalled that the operator could see right up her skirt throughout the shoot and would occasionally try to grope her using the puppet.

For the sickbay scenes when Spock bleeds, Daniels decided that Vulcans should have green blood. Roddenberry disliked the idea and unsuccessfully attempted to have it corrected in post-production. By the end of the fifth day of shooting, Daniels estimated that he was now only half an hour behind schedule. Days six and seven were spent on the sets used to show the surface of M-113; while the design of the planet did not match Johnson&#x27;s vision, he was pleased with it nonetheless. The ruins were constructed out of cardboard boxes covered in gunite (a spray-on, cement-like product) to give them a rocky appearance. Production wrapped on June 30, at 2:55 p.m. Bob Justman later referred to Daniels as the &quot;savior&quot; of the series for delivering &quot;The Man Trap&quot; on schedule, and when the director for &quot;The Naked Time&quot; dropped out, Daniels took over and shot the episode back to back with &quot;The Man Trap&quot; a quarter of a day faster than the schedule. By the end of the original series, Daniels had filmed more episodes than any other director.

During the production of &quot;The Man Trap&quot;, Daniels introduced a system in which actors unneeded on a shoot went to a &quot;cast table&quot; area to practice upcoming scenes rather than return to their dressing rooms. Producers felt that this both sped up the filming process and improved the quality of performances. The cast table system continued to be used throughout the production of the original series, even when Daniels was not directing.

In post-production, Justman recommended adding an opening narration. Roddenberry agreed and wrote new lines for a Captain&#x27;s log. Alexander Courage recorded the music for this episode on August 19, the same day as the &quot;Theme from &quot;Star Trek&quot;&quot;, using a 25-piece orchestra. While Roddenberry liked the theme, he hated the music created specifically for &quot;The Man Trap&quot;. The optical effects were created more quickly than usual; Howard A. Anderson, Jr. took two months, three times faster than for some episodes. The overall production costs for &quot;The Man Trap&quot; came in under-budget at $185,401.

=== The creature ===
The producers spent some time considering the creature&#x27;s appearance. Justman suggested to Gene Roddenberry that it could be some sort of &quot;terrifying, young lady&quot; with a similar appearance to the green skinned Orion slave girl seen in &quot;The Cage&quot;, but blue skinned and with orange hair. While Roddenberry thought that the idea was good, he already had an agreement with NBC that it would be an animal. Johnson envisaged the creature as a refugee with &quot;ashen skin&quot; wearing &quot;gunnysack clothing&quot;. Daniels had some apprehension about using a monster-of-the-week format, asking &quot;Do you go for cheap thrills or a more intelligent approach?&quot; He said that the crew decided to &quot;treat everything as if it were real&quot; in order to help the audience buy into it. It was Johnson who suggested the creature should be a shapeshifter, having used the idea in an episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; he wrote called &quot;The Four of Us Are Dying&quot;.

The creature was designed by Wah Chang. Dancer Sandra Gimpel wore the costume on-screen. Gimpel had previously appeared as a Talosian in &quot;The Cage&quot;. The head of the creature costume was sculpted in clay then covered in a plaster cast. Once the cast was removed, liquid latex was applied to create a flexible single-piece mask, which was then painted. Chang added a white wig and attached glass lenses to the mask for eyes. Once Gimpel was wearing the mask, cuts were made into its wrinkles to offer the actress some limited vision while wearing it. Gloves were modified by Chang to give the fingers the appearance of tentacles with suction cups. William Ware Theiss created the rest of the costume out of a fur bodysuit.

Johnson praised both Chang and Gimpel, saying that while the latter embodied the character, the design work meant that, in the final scene, it was as if the crew had to kill a &quot;helpless dog&quot;. After filming, the costume was kept in Justman&#x27;s office, becoming the first in an ever-growing number of alien costumes accumulated there. It reappeared on-screen in &quot;The Squire of Gothos&quot;. Although referred to officially as the &quot;M-113 creature&quot;, during production it was called the &quot;salt sucker&quot; and fans of the show have taken to referring to the alien as the &quot;salt vampire&quot;.

Don Lanning was part of the team working on the creature effects for the 2009 film &quot;Star Trek&quot;. He was the key sculptor for the production, and personally revamped some of the aliens from the original series, including the salt vampire seen in &quot;The Man Trap&quot;. He described the original design as &quot;hokey&quot;, and said that he tried to change it to &quot;something organic&quot;. The new version of the creature was unused in the film, which pleased Lanning. The creature did return in &quot;Star Trek Online&quot;, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game. Rather than a single salt vampire, the 20-player PvE mission &quot;Mine Trap&quot; saw a Romulan colony overrun with them. A salt vampire also makes an appearance in an episode of the animated series &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks.&quot; In December 2019, an animated version of the creature made a brief appearance in the opening scenes of the &quot;Star Trek: Short Treks&quot; episode &quot;Ephraim and Dot&quot;.

== Themes ==
In his book &quot;The Influence of Star Trek on Television, Film and Culture&quot;, Lincoln Geraghty wrote that episodes such as &quot;The Man Trap&quot; demonstrated a recurring theme within the series: the more barren the planet, the more likely that characters will be in danger. Other episodes which he said supported this view included &quot;The Cage&quot; and &quot;What Are Little Girls Made Of?&quot; Geraghty also pointed out that elsewhere in the original series, the predominant view was that alien predators such as the salt vampire were a lower life form which should be destroyed. He said that in &quot;The Man Trap&quot;, the alternative argument is presented: that such creatures should not be killed. However, Geraghty felt that the writers tried to prevent viewers from feeling sympathy for the creature by revealing its true appearance as it died. Paula M. Block and Terry J. Erdmann also discussed the killing of the creature in their book &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series 365&quot;, saying that it was &quot;the right thing to do&quot;, but suggested that the nature of the death would have troubled McCoy for some time after the event although this was not shown in the series.

A vampiric alien is a recurring idea in science fiction television series, such as the &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; episode &quot;Sand&quot;, the &quot;Babylon 5&quot; episode &quot;Soul Hunter&quot; and the television film &quot;Babylon 5: The River of Souls&quot;. The theme had already been used in written form, in Gustave Le Rouge&#x27;s 1908 French science fiction work &quot;Le Prisonnier de la Planète Mars&quot;.

Block and Erdmann also discussed another part of the episode where Spock is in charge on the bridge and Uhura begins to flirt with him, calling it a &quot;quintessential scene of the series&quot; due to the characters&#x27; sexual interest in each other. They suggested this may have been the inspiration for the Spock/Uhura relationship introduced in the 2009 reboot film &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Nichelle Nichols, who played Uhura, later said that she felt there were hints of an Uhura/Spock relationship in other episodes of the original series.

== Reception ==

=== Broadcast ===
A month prior to the premiere of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, Desilu held a screening for NBC executives to help decide which episode to broadcast first, and several stories were considered. Executives were concerned that &quot;Mudd&#x27;s Women&quot;, one potential choice, would have reviewers discussing &quot;space hookers&quot;; they felt another possibility, &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;, contained too much exposition, even though it was filmed as a second pilot. The final choice was between &quot;The Man Trap&quot; and &quot;The Naked Time&quot;. Justman felt that &quot;The Naked Time&quot; would make it easier for viewers to understand the characters, but later agreed with NBC&#x27;s decision to show &quot;The Man Trap&quot; first. In the book &quot;Inside Star Trek: The Real Story&quot;, he suggests that it was &quot;scarier and more exploitable than the others&quot;.

&quot;The Man Trap&quot; was the sixth episode produced. Although Roddenberry initially disagreed with NBC&#x27;s decision, he and production executive Herbert Franklin Solow came to believe it was the correct choice. Shatner also disagreed with the network, feeling that &quot;The Man Trap&quot; was the worst episode out of those available. The episode was the first episode of &quot;Star Trek&quot; broadcast in the United States, on NBC on September 8, 1966. &quot;The Man Trap&quot; formed part of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Sneak a Peek Week&quot;, in which the network showed the premiere episodes of several new shows in prime time slots, ahead of the rival channels ABC and CBS, who were still showing repeats from the previous season. Leading into &quot;Star Trek&quot; was the first episode of &quot;Tarzan&quot; showing Ron Ely, and leading out was Richard Mulligan&#x27;s &quot;The Hero&quot;.

&quot;The Man Trap&quot; placed first in its timeslot, with Nielsen ratings of 25.2 during the first half-hour; some 46.7 percent of all American televisions in use at the time were tuned in to the episode. In the same timeslot, &quot;The Tammy Grimes Show&quot; on ABC and &quot;My Three Sons&quot; on CBS received ratings of 14.1 and 9.4 respectively. During the second half of the episode, the rating for &quot;The Man Trap&quot; dropped to 24.2, with 42.2 percent of televisions tuned in. &quot;Bewitched&quot; on ABC increased that network&#x27;s rating to 15.8, and CBS&#x27;s Thursday night movie increased their rating to 10.7.

The following episodes saw a drop in ratings after &quot;The Man Trap&quot;. &quot;Charlie X&quot; was broadcast the following week; the studio did not want that episode to run second, but &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot; was the only other completed story. It placed second in the timeslot during the first half hour, with a rating of 19.1 and an overall share of 35.9 percent of viewers. It was beaten by &quot;My Three Sons&quot; on CBS with a rating of 19.2. During the second half hour, &quot;Star Trek&quot; was pushed into third with a rating of 12.3 by the Thursday night movie on CBS and the season premiere of &quot;Bewitched&quot;, which was also the first episode of that series broadcast in color. The following week, with &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;, the series returned to the top place with a 19.9 rating during the first half hour, and second in the second half hour to &quot;Bewitched&quot;. The Trendex rating report for the first few weeks of &quot;Star Trek&quot; saw it ranked in 33rd spot for the period with an average rating of 18.7.

==== Overseas broadcasts and re-releases ====
The episode was not the first to be broadcast in the United Kingdom, which instead premiered &quot;Star Trek&quot; on BBC One with &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot; on July 12, 1969. The episodes continued to be broadcast in a different order than they had appeared in the United States. &quot;The Man Trap&quot; was shown nearly three months later on October 4 as the 13th episode. This was during the period when the channel was still broadcasting only in black and white; it was not until &quot;Arena&quot; on November 15 that the series was shown in color. During subsequent repeats of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, the channel reverted to NBC&#x27;s schedule and showed &quot;The Man Trap&quot; as the first episode. Canadian network CTV aired episodes of the first season of &quot;Star Trek&quot; on Tuesday nights instead of Thursdays and so ran &quot;The Man Trap&quot; on September 6, 1966, two days before NBC. Airing American programs early was a common practice among Canadian broadcasters in order to avoid direct competition for viewers and advertisers with American border stations airing the same program at the same time. The practice became obsolete once simultaneous substitution of commercials was permitted.

A high-definition remastering of &quot;The Man Trap&quot;, which introduced new special effects and starship exteriors as well as enhanced music and audio, was shown for the first time in the United States on September 29, 2007, in broadcast syndication. The episode was made available to over 200 local stations across the United States with the rights to broadcast &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

=== Critical reception ===
In 1966, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said the episode was a &quot;winner&quot;, with a lot of suspense and science fiction gadgets. In an interview published in the 1988 book &quot;The Star Trek Interview Book&quot;, Johnson claimed that the response of critics to &quot;The Man Trap&quot;, and the initial episodes of &quot;Star Trek&quot; in general, was &quot;complete bewilderment&quot;. Stating that &quot;its special effects weren&#x27;t very special&quot;, Bob Shiels of the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; concluded &quot;We were told that the voyage of the Enterprise is programmed to last five years but there appears to be no reason for keeping Star Trek around that long&quot;. Shiels preferred the also debuting &quot;Love on a Rooftop&quot; which, unlike &quot;Star Trek&quot;, provided background so viewers understood &quot;what the show is supposed to be all about&quot;. In previewing the broadcast of &quot;The Man Trap&quot;, &quot;The Daily Reporter&quot; said that &quot;Star Trek&quot; had the &quot;usual far-fetched suppositions&quot; present in other science fiction works, but praise was given to the acting skills of Shatner and the plots of the initial episodes. The &quot;Edwardsville Intelligencer&quot; called the reveal of the creature in the episode &quot;the kicker of a great sci-fi plot&quot;. &quot;Daily Variety&quot; columnist Jack Hellman gave the episode an unfavorable review over its &quot;lack of meaningful cast leads&quot;, who &quot;move around with directorial precision with only violence to provide the excitement.&quot; The weekly edition of the magazine offered a similar opinion, stating that the &quot;Enterprise&quot; &quot;trudged along for a long hour with hardly any relief from violence, killing, ugly stuff and a distasteful monster&quot;.

Among more recent reviews, Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the episode an &quot;A−&quot; rating, describing it as &quot;done very well&quot; with a plot that is dark and ambiguous. Torrie Atkinson and Eugene Myers reviewed the episode in 2009 for &quot;Tor.com&quot;, saying that it suitably introduced the characters, although certain elements of the show were not yet in place. These included the lack of the death of a redshirted character, as the crewmen who died in &quot;The Man Trap&quot; did not wear red shirts, along with the lack of red and yellow alerts, instead referred to as general quarters three and four in this episode. The duo added that the episode demonstrated that the series was &quot;something special&quot;, and that it remained more culturally diverse than modern television. They gave it a rating of four out of six.

Ryan Britt, also writing for &quot;Tor.com&quot;, said that &quot;The Man Trap&quot; was not a good introduction to the series, but praised the screen time given to Rand, Uhura and Sulu. He added that the latter two were more interesting in this episode than they would be at any point until the start of the movie franchise. Britt said that &quot;The Man Trap&quot; was different than the rest of the series, and more akin to &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; owing to the background of the writer. In Hollywood.com&#x27;s ranking of all 79 episodes of &quot;The Original Series&quot;, Christian Blauvelt placed &quot;The Man Trap&quot; as 73rd, calling the creature &quot;incredibly pointless&quot;. It was also listed as one of the show&#x27;s &quot;cheesiest classic creatures&quot; by &quot;Wired&quot; magazine in 2007; however, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine listed it as the tenth best villain in the franchise.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; noted &quot;The Man Trap&quot; as an episode about a salt-eating shape-shifter, on the 50th anniversary of &quot;Star Trek&quot;&#x27;s first public broadcast in 2016.

In 2018, &quot;PopMatters&quot; ranked this the 7th best episode of the original series.

&quot;Star Trek&quot; news site &quot;Trek.Report&quot; gave the episode a ranking of 3 of 5, noting that actions of the crew were not affected by the &quot;Prime Directive&quot;, a later addition to the franchise&#x27;s canon.

In 2024 &quot;Hollywood.com&quot; ranked The Man Trap at number 73 out of the 79 original series episodes, calling the concept of creatures that leach off of the salt in human bodies pointless. 

== Home media release and other adaptations ==
The first adaptation of &quot;The Man Trap&quot; was as a re-working into a short story by author James Blish as part of the novelization &quot;Star Trek&quot;. This book contained seven short stories, each based on an episode of &quot;The Original Series&quot;, and was published in January 1967. The adaptation of &quot;The Man Trap&quot; appeared as the third story in the book, although it was named &quot;The Unreal McCoy&quot;. The first home media release of &quot;The Man Trap&quot; was on Compact Cassette from Startone Productions in 1982. A further release on LaserDisc took place in 1985, alongside &quot;Charlie X&quot;. Further releases of all episodes of the series were made on VHS and Betamax.

The episode was released on DVD paired with &quot;The Naked Time&quot; as part of the general release of the series in 1999. There were no other extras added to that series of releases, except the DVD containing &quot;Turnabout Intruder&quot;. &quot;The Man Trap&quot; was later released within a DVD box set of the first season in 2004; all three seasons of &quot;The Original Series&quot; were released as full-season box sets that year. The episode was included in the remastered season one release on DVD and Blu-ray in 2009.

<doc id="1034781" wikidata="Q4128384" url="?curid=1034781" title="Vulgarity">
<text>Vulgarity is the quality of being common, coarse, or unrefined. This judgement may refer to language, visual art, social class, or social climbers. John Bayley claims the term can never be self-referential, because to be aware of vulgarity is to display a degree of sophistication which thereby elevates the subject above the vulgar.

==Evolution of the term==
From the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries, &quot;vulgar&quot; simply described the common language or vernacular of a country. From the mid-seventeenth century onward, it began to take on a pejorative aspect: &quot;having a common and offensively mean character, coarsely commonplace; lacking in refinement or good taste; uncultured; ill bred&quot;. 

In the Victorian age, vulgarity broadly described many activities, such as wearing ostentatious clothing. In a George Eliot novel, one character could be vulgar for talking about money, a second because he criticizes the first for doing so, and a third for being fooled by the excessive refinement of the second. The effort to avoid vulgar phrasing could leave characters at a loss for words. In George Meredith&#x27;s &quot;Beauchamp&#x27;s Career&quot;, an heiress does not wish to make the commonplace statement that she is &quot;engaged&quot;, nor &quot;betrothed&quot;, &quot;affianced&quot;, or &quot;plighted&quot;. Though such words are not vulgarity in the vulgar sense, they nonetheless could stigmatize the user as a member of a socially inferior class. Even favored euphemisms such as &quot;toilet&quot; eventually become stigmatized like the words they replace (the so-called euphemism treadmill), and currently favored words serve as a sort of &quot;cultural capital&quot;.

== Language ==
Vulgarity, in the sense of vulgar speech, can refer to language which is offensive or obscene.

The word most associated with the verbal form of vulgarity is &quot;cursing.&quot; However, there are many subsections of vulgar words. American psychologist Timothy Jay classifies &quot;dirty words&quot; because it &quot;allows people interested in language to define the different types of reference or meaning that dirty words employ. One can see that what is considered taboo or obscene revolves around a few dimensions of human experience that there is a logic behind dirty word usage.&quot; One of the most commonly used vulgar terms in the English language is &quot;fuck&quot;.

<text>Ronald Mark Evans (born April 17, 1949 in Los Angeles, California) is an American Biologist, Professor and Head of the Salk’s Gene Expression Laboratory, and the March of Dimes Chair in Molecular and Developmental Biology at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator. Dr. Ronald M. Evans is known for his original discoveries of nuclear hormone receptors (NR), a special class of transcriptional factor, and the elucidation of their universal mechanism of action, a process that governs how lipophilic hormones and drugs regulate virtually every developmental and metabolic pathway in animals and humans. Nowadays, NRs are among the most widely investigated group of pharmaceutical targets in the world, already yielding benefits in drug discovery for cancer, muscular dystrophies, osteoporosis, type II diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases. His current research focuses on the function of nuclear hormone signaling and their function in metabolism and cancer.

He received his Bachelor of Science and PhD (1974) from UCLA, followed by a postdoctoral training at Rockefeller University with James E. Darnell. He became a faculty member at the Salk Institute in 1978 and adjunct professor in Biology, Biomedical Sciences, Neuroscience at UCSD (1985, 1989, 1995). He was named March of Dimes Chair in Molecular and Developmental Neurobiology at the Salk Institute in 1998.

His work on nuclear receptor was well recognized, thus he is a recipient of more than 40 nationally or internationally acclaimed awards and honors. In 2003 he was awarded the March of Dimes Prize in Developmental Biology. He received the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research (2004). He is also recipient of the Harvey Prize (2006), the Gairdner Foundation International Award (2006), the Albany Medical Center Prize (2007), the Wolf Prize in Medicine (2012) and the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize (2018). He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences since 1989, a member of American Society for Microbiology since 1993, a member of American Academy of Arts and Sciences since 1997, a member of the National Academy of Medicine since 2003, a member of European Molecular Biology Organization since 2006, a member of the American Philosophical Society since 2007, an elected fellow of the American Association for Cancer Research in 2014, named AAAS fellow in 2018 and a member of the National Academy of Inventors in 2018. Consistent with the broad impact of his work, he is listed by the Institute of Scientific Information as one of the most cited scientists of the past decade.

== Research ==
Members of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily of ligand-regulated transcription factors play important roles in reproduction, development, and physiology. In humans, genetic mutations in NRs are causes of rare diseases, while hormones and drugs that target NRs are in widespread therapeutic use. In 80s, Dr. Evans successfully cloned the first nuclear hormone receptor, the human glucocorticoid receptor. This action led to the finding of a superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors, all with similar molecular and genetic structures. Other of his pioneering studies include investigate hormones’ normal activities and their roles in disease, including a major discovery of nuclear hormone receptors, which respond to steroid hormones, vitamin A, vitamin D, thyroid hormones, and bile acids. By targeting genes these receptors help control sugar, salt, calcium, cholesterol, and fat metabolism. They are primary targets in breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers and leukemia treatment and have therapeutic roles in chronic inflammation, osteoporosis, and type 2 diabetes and asthma. His muscle metabolism studies led to the discovery of exercise mimetics, which promote the benefits of fitness without training and may help battle the obesity epidemic, diabetes, heart disease, and frailty.

<doc id="1034793" wikidata="Q319902" url="?curid=1034793" title="Isaac Abarbanel">
<text>Isaac ben Judah Abarbanel (;‎ 1437–1508), commonly referred to as Abarbanel (; also spelled Abravanel, Avravanel or Abrabanel), was a Portuguese Jewish statesman, philosopher, Bible commentator, and financier.

==Name==
Some debate exists over whether his last name should be pronounced &quot;Abarbanel&quot; or &quot;Abravanel&quot;. The traditional pronunciation is &quot;Abarbanel&quot;. Modern scholarly literature, since Graetz and Baer, has most commonly used &quot;Abravanel&quot;, but his own son Judah insisted on &quot;Abarbanel&quot;, and &quot;Sefer HaTishbi&quot; by Elijah Levita, who was a nearby contemporary, twice vowels the name as &quot;Abarbinel&quot; (אַבַּרְבִּינֵאל).

The name&#x27;s etymology is uncertain. Some say it comes from &quot;Ab Rabban El&quot;, meaning &quot;father of the rabbis of God&quot;, which seems to favor the pronunciation &quot;Abrabanel&quot;.

==Biography==

Abarbanel was born in Lisbon, Portugal, into one of the oldest and most distinguished Iberian Jewish families, his antecedents having escaped the massacre in Castile in 1391. A student of the rabbi of Lisbon, Joseph Chaim, he became well versed in rabbinic literature and in the learning of his time, devoting his early years to the study of Jewish philosophy. Abarbanel is quoted as saying that he counted Joseph ibn Shem-Tov as his mentor. At 20 years old, he wrote on the original form of the natural elements, on religious questions and prophecy. Together with his intellectual abilities, he exhibited a mastery of financial matters. This attracted the attention of King Afonso V of Portugal, who employed him as treasurer.

He used his high position and the great wealth he had inherited from his father to aid his co-religionists. When his patron Afonso captured the city of Arzila, in Morocco, the Jewish captives faced being sold as slaves. Abarbanel both contributed large sums to the ransom and personally arranged for collections throughout Portugal. He also wrote to his learned and wealthy friend, Vitale (Yehiel) Nissim da Pisa, on behalf of the captives.

After the death of Afonso, he was obliged to relinquish his office, having been accused by King John II of connivance with the Duke of Braganza, who had been executed on the charge of conspiracy. Abarbanel, warned in time, saved himself by a hasty flight to Castile in 1483. His large fortune was confiscated by royal decree.

At Toledo, his new home, he occupied himself at first with Biblical studies, and in the course of six months produced an extensive commentary on the books of Joshua, Judges, and Samuel. Shortly afterward, though, he entered the service of the house of Castile. Together with his friend, the influential &quot;converso&quot; Don Abraham Senior, of Segovia, he undertook to farm the revenues and to supply provisions for the royal army, contracts that he carried out to the entire satisfaction of Queen Isabella I of Castile.

During the Reconquista, Abarbanel advanced considerable sums of money to the king. When the Jews were ordered banished by the Catholic Monarchs of Spain with the Alhambra Decree, he did all in his power to induce the king to revoke the edict. He unsuccessfully offered the king 30,000 ducats (approximately £60,000 at the time). He left Spain with his fellow Jews and went to Naples, where, soon after, he entered the service of the king. For a short time, he lived in peace undisturbed, but when the city was taken by the French, bereft of all his possessions, he followed the young king, Alfonso, to Messina in 1495, before going to Corfu. In 1496, he settled in Monopoli, before finally landing in Venice in 1503, where his services were employed in negotiating a commercial treaty between Portugal and the Venetian republic.

Several times during the mid to late 15th century, he personally spent large amounts of his personal fortunes to bribe the Catholic monarchs to permit the Jews to remain in Spain. Abarbanel is claimed to have offered them 600,000 crowns for the revocation of the edict. Ferdinand is said to have hesitated, but was prevented from accepting the offer by Tomás de Torquemada, the Grand Inquisitor, who dashed into the royal presence, and throwing a crucifix down before the king and queen, asked whether, like Judas, they would betray their Lord for money. In the end, he managed only to get the date for the expulsion delayed by two days.

He died in Venice in 1508 and was buried in Padua next to its rabbi, Judah Minz. Owing to the destruction of the Jewish cemetery there during the Siege of Padua in 1509, his grave is now unknown. Bones from the cemetery were reburied in 1955, and there is a tradition that the remains of Abarbanel and Minz are among them. Claimed descendants of Abarbanel include Russian author Boris Pasternak and Brazilian media mogul and entertainer Silvio Santos.

==Works==

Abarbanel wrote many works during his lifetime which are often categorized into three groups—exegesis, philosophy, and apologetics. His philosophy dealt with the sciences and how the general field relates to the Jewish religion and traditions, and his apologetics defend, the idea of the Messiah in Judaism while criticizing the Christian version. Abarbanel&#x27;s exegetic writings were different from the usual biblical commentaries because he took social and political issues of the times into consideration. He believed that mere commentary was not enough, but that the actual lives of the Jewish people must be deliberated on, as well, when discussing such an important topic as the Bible. He also took the time to include an introduction concerning the character of each book on which he commented, as well as its date of composition, and the intention of the original author, to make the works more accessible to the average reader.

===Exegesis===

Abarbanel composed commentaries on the Torah and Nevi&#x27;im. These were published in three works: &quot;Perush&quot; (Commentary) on the Torah (Venice, 1579); &quot;Perush&quot; on the Earlier Prophets (Pesaro, 1511?); &quot;Perush&quot; on the Later Prophets (Pesaro, 1520?). He may also have composed a commentary on Song of Songs.

His commentaries are divided into chapters, each of which is preceded by a list of questions or difficulties that he sets out to explain over the course of the chapter. Not only did this make it easier for scholars to find the answers they were looking for, but these lists of difficulties aided the average student in studying Abarbanel&#x27;s work. In his commentary on the Torah, these questions have no fixed number, sometimes amounting to over 40, but in his commentary to the Prophets he limits himself to six. Abarbanel rarely forayed into the world of grammatical or philological investigation in the vein of Abraham ibn Ezra or David Kimhi before him, instead focusing on a content-based investigation of the Scripture at hand.

Occasionally, Abarbanel digresses from the subject under discussion, particularly in his commentary on the Torah. His style and presentations are prolix and often repetitive. Some of his interpretations derive from homilies delivered in the synagogue. He vehemently fought the extreme rationalism of philosophical interpretation, as well as interpretations based on philosophical allegory. At the same time, he himself had recourse, especially in his commentary on the Torah, to numerous interpretations based on philosophy.

His opposition to philosophical allegory must also be ascribed to the conditions of his time, the fear of undermining the unquestioning faith of the simple Jew, and the danger to Jewish survival in exile. This also explains Abarbanel&#x27;s faith in the Messianic concepts of Judaism, as well as his need to make his work accessible to all Jews instead of writing merely for the scholars of his time. Although his commentary often differed from kabbalistic interpretations, Abarbanel nonetheless believed that the Torah had a hidden meaning in addition to its overt significance, thus he interpreted passages in the Torah in various ways. His commentary to Deuteronomy 25:5 demonstrates both his knowledge and endorsement of kabbalists and kabbalistic understanding of Scripture. Side by side with philosophical concepts (entitled &quot;the analytical way&quot;, &quot;the scientific&quot;, or &quot;the method of wisdom&quot;) he gives &quot;the way of the Torah&quot;, i.e., the moral and religious tenets to be derived from the text.

He quoted extensively from the Midrash, but allowed himself to criticize his source, when in his view, it did not align with the literal meaning of the text. He explains, &quot;I shall not refrain from pointing to the weakness inherent in their statements where they are homiletical in nature and are not accepted by them as authoritative&quot; (Introduction to Joshua).

Overall, Abarbanel&#x27;s exegetical writings are notable for these distinctions:

# His comparison of the social structure of society in biblical times with that of the European society in his day (for example, in dealing with the institution of monarchy, I Samuel 8). He had wide recourse to historical interpretation, particularly in his commentaries to the Major and Minor Prophets and to the Book of Daniel, but in numerous instances his interpretations are anachronistic (for example, Judges 18).
# Preoccupation with Christian exegesis and exegetes. He generally disputed their christological interpretations, especially those of Jerome. But he did not hesitate to borrow from them when their interpretation seemed correct to him. &quot;Indeed I regard their words in this matter to be more acceptable than those of the rabbis to which I have referred&quot; (I Kings 8, reply to the sixth question).
# His introductions to the books of the prophets, which are much more comprehensive than those of his predecessors. In them, he deals with the content of the books, the division of the material, their authors, and the time of their compilation, and also drew comparisons between the method and style of the various prophets. His investigations are made in the spirit of medieval scholasticism. He may consequently be considered as a pioneer of the modern science of Bible propædeutics.

However, the major characteristic that separated Abarbanel from his predecessors was his unflagging commitment toward using the Scripture as a means of elucidating the status quo of his surrounding Jewish community; as a historical scholar, Abarbanel was able to contemporize the lessons of the historical eras described in the Scripture and apply them successfully in his explanations of modern Jewish living. Abarbanel, who had himself taken part in the politics of the great powers of the day, believed that mere consideration of the literary elements of Scripture was insufficient, and that the political and social life of the characters in the Tanakh must also be taken into account. Due to the overall excellence and exhaustiveness of Abarbanel&#x27;s exegetical literature, he was looked to as a beacon for later Christian scholarship, which often included the tasks of translating and condensing his works.

His exegetical writings are set against a richly conceived backdrop of the Jewish historical and sociocultural experience, and it is often implied that his exegesis was sculpted with the purpose of giving hope to the Jews of Spain that the arrival of the Messiah was imminent in their days. This idea distinguished him from many other philosophers of the age, who did not rely as heavily on Messianic concepts.

===Philosophy===

Abarbanel&#x27;s Jewish predecessors in the realm of philosophy did not receive the same tolerance at his hands as the Christians did. Men such as Isaac Albalag, Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera, Gersonides, Moses ben Joshua, and others, were denounced by Abarbanel as infidels and misleading guides for assuming a comparatively liberal standpoint in religiophilosophical questions. Abarbanel was essentially an opponent of philosophy, despite his authority on the subject, because his entire understanding of the Jewish religion was based on God&#x27;s revelation in Jewish history. Jewish exegesis had become philosophical and far removed from the underlying truth of the text, according to Abarbanel.

A characteristic instance of his vacillation is afforded by his most important religious work, the &quot;Rosh Amanah&quot; (&quot;The Pinnacle of Faith&quot;) (Amsterdam, 1505), whose title derives from Song of Songs 4:8. This work, devoted to the championship of the Maimonidean 13 articles of belief against the attacks of Hasdai Crescas and Joseph Albo, ends with the statement that Maimonides compiled these articles merely in accordance with the fashion of other nations, which set up axioms or fundamental principles for their science. However, he holds that Judaism has nothing in common with human science; that the teachings of the Torah are revelations from God, and therefore are all of equal value; that among them are neither principles nor corollaries from principles.

Abarbanel agrees with and supports some of Maimonides&#x27; ideas, but he assails Maimonides&#x27; conception that the prophetic visions were the creations of imagination. Abarbanel will not hear of this explanation, even for the &quot;bat kol&quot; of the Talmud, which, according to him, was an actual voice made audible by God—a miracle, in fact.

In like manner, Abarbanel exceeded all his predecessors in combating Maimonides&#x27; theory of the &quot;Heavenly Chariot&quot; in Ezekiel.

===Works of Hope===

Abarbanel felt deeply the hopelessness and despair, which possessed Spanish Jews in the years following their expulsion from Spain, and set himself, therefore, to champion and strengthen their Messianic belief. With this aim, he wrote these works:
# &quot;The Wellsprings of Salvation&quot; (, &quot;Maʿyānei haYəshuʿāh&quot;, 1496), which is a commentary on the Book of Daniel;
# &quot;The Salvation of His Anointed&quot; (, &quot;Yəshuʿot Meshiho&quot;, 1497), an interpretation of rabbinic literature about the Messiah
# &quot;Announcing Salvation&quot; (, 1498), a commentary on the messianic prophecies in the prophetical books

These three books are considered the separate parts of a larger work entitled &quot;Tower of Salvation&quot; (, &quot;Migdāl Yəshuʿot&quot;).

The first work is in the form of a commentary upon Daniel, in which he controverts both the Christian exposition of and the Jewish rationalistic approach to this book. Curiously enough, in opposition to the Talmud and all later rabbinical tradition, he counts Daniel among the prophets, coinciding therein—but therein only—with the current Christian interpretation. He is impelled to this by the fact that Daniel furnishes the foundation for his Messianic theory. The remainder of his commentary is devoted to an exhaustive and caustic criticism of the Christian exposition.

The second work is probably unique in being an exposition of the doctrine concerning the Messiah according to the traditional testimony of Talmud and Midrash. His third apologetic work contains a collection of Messianic passages of the Bible and their interpretations, in the course of which Abarbanel criticizes the Christian interpretation of these passages.

===Other works===
Other works by Abarbanel include:
* &quot;Passover Offering&quot; (&quot;Zevaḥ Pesaḥ&quot;)
* &quot;The Pinnacle of Faith&quot; (&quot;Rosh Amana&quot;) 
* &quot;Inheritance of the Fathers&quot; (&quot;Naḥalat Avot&quot;)
These three works were written in Naples after the Catholic Monarchs of Spain had expelled the Jews in the Alhambra Decree. They were first published together as an incunabulum in Constantinople on December 5, 1505 by the first printers in that city, David and Samuel ibn Naḥmias, who had fled in the same boat from Iberia to Naples. The Naḥmias brothers had worked in the Portuguese printing house of Eliezer Toledano ben Avraham ibn Alantansi, the Jewish printer of Híjar.
* &quot;The Crown of the Ancients&quot; (&quot;Ateret Zkenim&quot;)
* &quot;The Forms of the Elements&quot; (&quot;Tzurot Hayesodot&quot;)
* &quot;New Heavens&quot; (&quot;Shamayim Hadashim&quot;)
* &quot;Deeds of God&quot; (&quot;Mifalot Elohim&quot;)

==Assessment of his works==
===Race and slavery===
Ironically, according to David Brion Davis, a Yale historian who specializes in slavery, Abarbanel played a pivotal role in providing the conceptual basis for black slavery: &quot;[...] the great Jewish philosopher and statesman Isaac ben Abravanel, having seen many black slaves both in his native Portugal and in Spain, merged Aristotle&#x27;s theory of natural slaves with the belief that the biblical Noah had cursed and condemned to slavery both his son Ham and his young grandson Canaan. Abravanel concluded that the servitude of animalistic black Africans should be perpetual.&quot; Abarbanel&#x27;s view on slavery, however, stood in direct contradiction to that of Rashi, who, citing an earlier Talmudic source, wrote that the heathen were never included in the sanction of possessing slaves as the children of Israel were permitted to do, for the Scripture says : &quot;Of them &quot;you&quot; shall buy, etc.&quot;, meaning, &quot;Israel alone is permitted to buy from them [enslaved persons], but they are not permitted to buy [enslaved persons] from you, nor from one another.&quot;

Scholars including Jonathan Schorsch and David M. Goldenberg point out Abarbanel&#x27;s comments on the Book of Amos as indicative of very humanistic sentiments: &quot;[Abarbanel] responded with unconcealed anger to the comment of a tenth-century Karaite from Jerusalem, Yefet b. Ali, on the issue of Black [promiscuity]. Yefet had interpreted a biblical verse (Amos 9:7) to refer to Black women as being &#x27;promiscuous and therefore no one knows who his father is.&#x27; Abarbanel: &#x27;I don&#x27;t know who told Yefet this practice of promiscuity among Black women, which he mentions. But in the country of my birth [Portugal] I have seen many of these people and their women are loyal to their husbands unless they are prisoners and captive to their enemies. They are just like any other people.&#x27;&quot; Schorsch argues that concerning Abarbanel&#x27;s views about the connection between slavery and the curse of Ham, Abarbanel was influenced by the writings of his contemporaries and predecessors, including Christian and Muslim writers, as well as the culture around him, and was hardly considered unique in his views. Abarbanel&#x27;s commentary on Amos 9:7 and other writings, argues Schorsch, show the complexity of Abarbanel&#x27;s views of Blacks. &quot;Abarbanel&#x27;s conflicting passages regarding Blacks were written at different times and addressed different realms of discourse, the one abstract myth, the other actual living Blacks.&quot; Schorsch shows how contemporary travel books described Ethiopians as barbarians, stealing each other&#x27;s children to sell to Muslim foreigners. &quot;Hence, the many statements that Ethiopians engaged in relations... with their siblings or parents. In this view, families, a cultured product, would not have been known to primitives who lived like animals. Yet Abarbanel dismissed all these derogatory notions when defending the behavior of actual Blacks living in Portugal.&quot;

==Legacy==
The Synagogue Don Isaac Abravanel in Paris, France, was named in his memory.

<text>In the field of psychology, the subfield of oneirology (; ) is the scientific study of dreams. Research seeks correlations between dreaming and knowledge about the functions of the brain, as well as an understanding of how the brain works during dreaming as pertains to memory formation and mental disorders. The study of oneirology can be distinguished from dream interpretation in that the aim is to quantitatively study the process of dreams instead of analyzing the meaning behind them.

==History==
In the 19th century, two advocates of this discipline were the French sinologists Marquis d&#x27;Hervey de Saint Denys and Alfred Maury. The field gained momentum in 1952, when Nathaniel Kleitman and his student Eugene Aserinsky discovered regular cycles. A further experiment by Kleitman and William C. Dement, then another medical student, demonstrated the particular period of sleep during which electrical brain activity, as measured by an electroencephalograph (EEG), closely resembled that of waking, in which the eyes dart about actively. This kind of sleep became known as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and Kleitman and Dement&#x27;s experiment found a correlation of 0.80 between REM sleep and dreaming.

==Field of work==
Research into dreams includes exploration of the mechanisms of dreaming, the influences on dreaming, and disorders linked to dreaming. Work in oneirology overlaps with neurology and can vary from quantifying dreams to analyzing brain waves during dreaming, to studying the effects of drugs and neurotransmitters on sleeping or dreaming. Though debate continues about the purpose and origins of dreams, there could be great gains from studying dreams as a function of brain activity. For example, knowledge gained in this area could have implications for the treatment of certain mental illnesses.

==Mechanisms of dreaming==
Dreaming occurs mainly during REM sleep, and brain scans recording brain activity have witnessed heavy activity in the limbic system and the amygdala during this period. Though current research has reversed the myth that dreaming occurs only during REM sleep, it has also shown that the dreams reported in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and REM differ qualitatively and quantitatively, suggesting that the mechanisms that control each are different.

During REM sleep, researchers theorize that the brain goes through a process known as synaptic efficacy refreshment. This is observed as brain waves self-firing during sleep, in slow cycles at a rate of around 14 Hz, and is believed to serve the purpose of consolidating recent memories and reinforcing old memories. In this type of brain stimulation, the dreaming that occurs is a by-product of the process.

===Stages of sleep===
During normal sleep cycles, humans alternate between normal, NREM sleep and REM sleep. The brain waves characteristic of dreaming that are observed during REM sleep are the most commonly studied in dream research because most dreaming occurs during REM sleep.

===REM sleep===
In 1952, Eugene Aserinsky discovered REM sleep while working in the surgery of his PhD advisor. Aserinsky noticed that the sleepers&#x27; eyes fluttered beneath their closed eyelids, later using a polygraph machine to record their brain waves during these periods. In one session, he awakened a subject who was wailing and crying out during REM and confirmed his suspicion that dreaming was occurring. In 1953, Aserinsky and his advisor published the ground-breaking study in &quot;Science&quot;.

Accumulated observation shows that dreams are strongly associated with REM sleep, during which an electroencephalogram shows brain activity to be most like wakefulness. While REMS is associated with dreaming, not all REMS periods result in reported dreams, and not all dreams occur during REMS. Participant-nonremembered dreams during NREM are normally more mundane in comparison. During a typical lifespan, a human spends a total of about six years dreaming (which is about two hours each night). Most dreams last only 5 to 20 minutes. It is unknown where in the brain dreams originate, if there is a single origin for dreams, if multiple portions of the brain are involved, or what the purpose of dreaming is for the body or mind.

During REM sleep, the release of certain neurotransmitters is completely suppressed. As a result, motor neurons are not stimulated, a condition known as REM atonia. This prevents dreams from resulting in dangerous movements of the body.

Animals have complex dreams and are able to retain and recall long sequences of events while they are asleep. Studies show that various species of mammals and birds experience REM during sleep, and follow the same series of sleeping states as humans.

The discovery that dreams take place primarily during a distinctive electrophysiological state of sleep (REM), which can be identified by objective criteria, led to rebirth of interest in this phenomenon. When REM sleep episodes were timed for their duration and subjects awakened to make reports before major editing or forgetting could take place, it was determined that subjects accurately matched the length of time they judged the dream narrative to occupy with the length of REM sleep that preceded the awakening. This close correlation of REM sleep and dream experience was the basis of the first series of reports describing the nature of dreaming: that it is a regular nightly occurrence, rather than an occasional phenomenon, and that it is a high-frequency activity within each sleep period occurring at predictable intervals of approximately every 60–90 minutes in all humans throughout the life span.

REM sleep episodes and the dreams that accompany them lengthen progressively across the night, with the first episode the shortest, of approximately 10–12 minutes duration, and the second and third episodes increasing to 15–20 minutes. Dreams at the end of the night may last typically 15 minutes, although these may be experienced as several distinct stories due to momentary arousals interrupting sleep as the night ends.

Dream reports can normally be made 50% of the time when an awakening occurs prior to the end of the first REM period. This rate of retrieval is increased to about 99% when awakenings occur during the last REM period of the night. This increase in the ability to recall appears to be related to intensification across the night in the vividness of dream imagery, colors and emotions. The dream story itself in the last REM period is farthest from reality, containing more bizarre elements, and it is these properties, coupled with the increased likelihood of morning waking review to take place, that heighten the chance of recall of the last dream.

==Definition of a dream==
The definition of dream used in quantitative research is defined through four base components:
# a form of thinking that occurs under minimal brain direction, external stimuli are blocked, and the part of the brain that recognizes self shuts down
# a form of experience that we believed we experience through our senses
# something memorable
# have some interpretation of experience by self
In summary, a dream, as defined by G. William Domhoff and Adam Schneider, is &quot;a report of a memory of a cognitive experience that happens under the kinds of conditions that are most frequently produced in a state called &#x27;sleep.

===Authentic dreaming===
Authentic dreams are defined by their tendency to occur &quot;within the realm of experience&quot; and reflect actual memories or experiences the dreamer can relate to. Authentic dreams are believed to be the side effect of synaptic efficacy refreshment that occurs without errors. Research suggests that the brain stimulation that occurs during dreaming authentic dreams is significant in reinforcing neurological pathways, serving as a method for the mind to &quot;rehearse&quot; certain things during sleep.

===Illusory dreaming===
Illusory dreams are defined as dreams that contain impossible, incongruent, or bizarre content and are hypothesized to stem from memory circuits accumulating efficacy errors. In theory, old memories having undergone synaptic efficacy refreshment multiple times throughout one&#x27;s lifetime result in accumulating errors that manifest as illusory dreams when stimulated. Qualities of illusory dreaming have been linked to delusions observed in mental disorders. Illusory dreams are believed to most likely stem from older memories that experience this accumulation of errors in contrast to authentic dreams that stem from more recent experiences.

==Influences on dreaming==
One aspect of dreaming studied is the capability to externally influence the contents of dreams with various stimuli. One such successful connection was made to the olfactory system, influencing the emotions of dreams through a smell stimulus. Their research has shown that the introduction of a positive smelling stimulus (roses) induced positive dreams while negative smelling stimulus (rotten eggs) induced negative dreams.

===Memories and experience===

Though there is much debate within the field about the purpose of dreaming, a leading theory involves the consolidation of memories and experiences that occurs during REM sleep. The electric involuntary stimulus the brain undergoes during sleep is believed to be a basis for a majority of dreaming. Research suggests that dreams, especially during REM sleep, help consolidate memories by integrating new information with existing memories. This process may prioritize emotionally significant or unresolved experiences.

The link between memory, sleep, and dreams becomes more significant in studies analyzing memory consolidation during sleep. Research has shown that NREM sleep is responsible for the consolidation of facts and episodes in contrast to REM sleep that consolidates more emotionally related aspects of memory. The correlation between REM and emotional consolidation could be interpreted as the reason why dreams are of such an emotional nature and produce strong reactions from humans.

===Interpersonal attachment===
In addition to the conscious role people are aware of memory and experience playing in dreaming, unconscious effects such as health of relationships factor into the types of dreams the brain produces. Of the people analyzed, those suffering from &quot;insecure attachments&quot; were found to dream with more frequency and more vividly than those who were evaluated to have &quot;secure attachments&quot;.

===Drugs affecting dreaming===
Correlations between the usage of drugs and dreaming have been documented, particularly the use of drugs, such as sedatives, and the suppression of dreaming because of drugging effects on the cycles and stages of sleep while not allowing the user to reach REM. Drugs used for their stimulating properties (cocaine, methamphetamine, and ecstasy) have been shown to also decrease the restorative properties of REM sleep and its duration.

==Dreaming disorders==
Dreaming disorders are difficult to quantify due to the ambiguous nature of dreaming. However, dreaming disorders can be linked to psychological disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder expressed as nightmares. Research into dreaming also suggests similarity and links in illusory dreaming and delusions.

===Post-traumatic stress disorder===
Diagnostic symptoms include re-experiencing original trauma(s), by means of flashbacks or nightmares; avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma; and increased arousal, such as difficulty falling or staying asleep, anger, and hypervigilance.

Links to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and dreaming have been made in studying the flashbacks or nightmares the victims would suffer. Measurement of the brain waves exhibited by the subjects experiencing these episodes showed great similarity between those of dreaming. The drugs used to treat those suffering from these symptoms of flashbacks and nightmares would suppress not only these traumatic episodes but also any other sort of dreaming function.

===Schizophrenia===
The symptoms of schizophrenia involve abnormalities in the perception or expression of reality primarily focused on delusions and hallucinations.

The delusions experienced by those with schizophrenia have been likened to the experience of illusory dreams that have come to be interpreted by the subject as actual experiences. Additional research into medication to suppress symptoms of schizophrenia have also shown to influence the REM cycle of those taking the medication and as a result influence the patterns of sleep and dreaming in the subjects.

<doc id="1034796" wikidata="Q1102300" url="?curid=1034796" title="Clonorchiasis">
<text>Clonorchiasis is an infectious disease caused by the Chinese liver fluke (&quot;Clonorchis sinensis&quot;) and two related species.
Clonorchiasis is a known risk factor for the development of cholangiocarcinoma, a neoplasm of the biliary system.

Symptoms of opisthorchiasis caused by &quot;Opisthorchis viverrini&quot; and by &quot;O. felineus&quot; are indistinguishable from clonorchiasis caused by &quot;Clonorchis sinensis&quot;, leading some to argue that the disease by these three parasites should be referred to collectively as clonorchiasis.

==Signs and symptoms==
==Cause==

&quot;Clonorchis sinensis&quot; is a trematode (fluke) which is part of the phylum Platyhelminthes. The parasitic worm is as long as 10 to 25 mm and lives in the bile ducts of the liver. It is a hermaphroditic fluke that requires two intermediate hosts. The eggs of the worms are passed in fecal matter into a body of water and are then ingested by mollusks. The water snail is the first intermediate host, in which a miracidium (an embryonated egg discharged in stool) goes through its developmental stages (sporocyst, rediae and cercariae). Freshwater fish are a second intermediate host for the parasitic worm. They become infected when the larva (cercaria) of the worm leaves the snail and penetrates the flesh of the fish. Humans then become infected by eating infected fish that has been undercooked, smoked, pickled, or salted, and from there the cycle repeats.

Clonorchiasis is endemic in the Far East, especially in Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and Southern China. Clonorchiasis has been reported in areas to which it is not endemic (including the United States). In such cases, the infection follows the ingestion of undercooked or pickled freshwater fish imported from one of the endemic areas and containing metacercariae.

==Diagnosis==
Adult &quot;C. sinensis&quot; worms can inhabit the bile ducts of humans for 20–25 years without any clear clinical symptoms. This, in addition to the nonspecific symptoms infected persons may develop, can lead to missed diagnoses.

Patients are diagnosed when &quot;C. sinensis&quot; eggs are found in stools. The formalin-ether concentration technique (FECT) method of stool examination is most effective at diagnosing light cases of infection, while the Kato-Katz (KK) method is more suitable for the diagnosing of persons with clonorchiasis. Serological methods that use enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) can help differentiate the eggs of &quot;C. sinensis&quot; from other flukes.

== Prevention and control ==
The CDC recommends against eating raw, undercooked, or lightly salted, smoked, or pickled fish. The WHO recommends a combination of veterinary public health measures, education of food safety practices, and expanding access to anthelminthic drugs. The NHFPC of China has a recommendation similar to that of the WHO.

Health regulators including the FDA have established requirements on the freezing of fish intended for raw consumption. The European Union (EFSA) specifically require an extended time for fish suspected of containing &quot;Clonorchis&quot; or &quot;Opisthorchis&quot; compared to other parasites. According to WHO data, larvae of these two genera are killed by freezing at for 5 days.

The EFSA recommends a cooking time of 30 minutes at to kill the parasite.

==Treatment==
Praziquantel is the treatment of choice for clonorchiasis.

<text>Gastão Vidigal is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. The population is 4,860 (2020 est.) in an area of 181 km². The town was settled in the first part of the 20th century, at first under the name &quot;Brioso&quot;. The municipality was established in 1955 by separating it from Nhandeara, and at the same time it was renamed &quot;Gastão Vidigal&quot; after a banker who opened a branch of the Banco Mercantil de São Paulo in the town. The small town produces milk, corn, cotton, and coffee.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia de Telecomunicações do Estado de São Paulo until 1975, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<text>Henry Evans Maude, (1 October 1906 – 4 November 2006) was a British Colonial Service administrator, historian and anthropologist.

==Life and career==
Maude was born in Bankipore, India. Educated at Highgate School from 1921 to 1925, and Jesus College, Cambridge, Maude represented India at rifle-shooting in 1926.

He spent the years 1929–48 working as a civil servant and administrator in various Pacific Islands. Between 1940 and 1941, Maude was sent to the Pitcairn Islands by the Western Pacific High Commission, to modernise the government, and to establish a post office and issue stamps in order to generate revenue for the people of the island. During this time, Maude and his wife collected a great number of Polynesian archaeological items found on the Pitcairn Islands, later donated to the Auckland War Memorial Museum in New Zealand. The almost 1,500 item collection composes the largest known collection of cultural artefacts from the islands. Maude spent much time in the British colony of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, serving as land commissioner before WWII then, after the Japanese occupation of the Gilbert Islands, as Resident Commissioner from 1946 to 1949. From 1949 to 1955, he worked for the South Pacific Commission.

From 1957 to 1961, he was a Research Fellow at the Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies (RSPAS), which is part of the Australian National University in Canberra. He has published widely on aspects of Pacific Islands history, was a co-founder of the &quot;Journal of Pacific History&quot;, and played an important role in establishing the Pacific Manuscripts Bureau.

==Personal life==
He was the husband of Honor Courtney Maude (née King), a British-Australian authority on Oceanic string figures. She predeceased him, dying in 2001 in Canberra, aged 95.

==Death and legacy==
Maude died, aged 100, on 4 November 2006. The bulk of Maude&#x27;s personal papers are held at the Barr Smith Library at the University of Adelaide, where an extensive set of pages devoted to his life and work can be found. He published the work of Sir Arthur Grimble.

<text>Elwood Vernon Jensen (January 13, 1920 – December 16, 2012) was the Distinguished University Professor, George and Elizabeth Wile Chair in Cancer Research at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine&#x27;s Vontz Center for Molecular Studies. In 2004 he received the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research for his research on estrogen receptors. He is considered the father of the field of hormone action.

== Life ==
Jensen was born in Fargo, North Dakota, in the United States, received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Wittenberg University in 1940 and PhD in organic chemistry from the University of Chicago in 1944. From 1947 Jensen studied steroid hormones at Chicago, where he isolated estrogen receptors and discovered their importance in breast cancer.

Jensen worked closely with Nobel laureate Charles Huggins; he joined the research team at the Ben May Laboratory for Cancer (now the Ben May Department of Cancer Research) in 1951 and became director after Huggins retired. Jensen first described the estrogen receptor in 1958 and subsequently discovered the superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors along with a unifying mechanism that regulates embryonic development and diverse metabolic pathways.

At the University of Chicago, Professor Jensen was the Charles B. Huggins Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus in the Ben May Department for Cancer Research and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of Chicago.

He began work at the University of Cincinnati in 2002, and continued there until 2011.

He died aged 92 of pneumonia at Cincinnati in 2012.

<text>Leonardo Agostini (19 September 1593 – August 1676) was an Italian antiquary of the 17th century, born in Boccheggiano, near Grosseto.

==Life==

Agostino was employed for some time as &quot;antiquario&quot; to Cardinal Francesco Barberini to collect works of art for the recently constructed Palazzo Barberini. His letters to the Barberini family during their period of disgrace and exile (1646–50) have provided art historians with information on the archaeological activity of the time. Appointed superintendent of antiquities in the Papal States by Pope Alexander VII, he directed excavations in Rome at the Forum and at the thermae near the church of San Lorenzo in Panisperna, where he discovered the &quot;Barberini Hera&quot;.

In 1649 he issued a new edition of Filippo Paruta&#x27;s &quot;Sicilian Medals&quot;, with engravings of 400 additional specimens. In conjunction with Gian Pietro Bellori (1615–1696) he published &quot;Gemme antiche figurate&quot;, a work on antique engraved gems, in two volumes (Rome, 1657 and 1669); the first was devoted entirely to Cardinal Francesco&#x27;s collection, which Agostini had assembled for the papal nephew, and the second to cameos and other discoveries from the &quot;auguste ruine della gran Roma&quot; (the &quot;august ruins of great Rome&quot;). The work, which grouped the gems according to the themes represented, was translated into Latin by Jakob Gronovius in Amsterdam, 1685. 

Agostini was acquainted with all the Roman antiquarians of his day, including Bellori, Cassiano dal Pozzo and Andrea Sacchi; he preserved a volume of Annibale Carracci&#x27;s ephemeral caricature sketches.

<text>Franklin Paul Pitura (October 24, 1943 – February 16, 2019) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Manitoba legislature from 1995 to 2003, representing the rural riding of Morris for the Progressive Conservative Party. Between 1997 and 1999, he served as a Cabinet Minister in the government of Premier Gary Filmon.

The son of Frank Pitura and Doris Palahniuk, he was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and was educated at Sanford Collegiate and the University of Manitoba. He was a government employee from 1967 to 1977, and again from 1987 to 1995. Pitura also worked as a farmer from 1977 to 1991, and was a delegate of the &quot;Manitoba Pool Elevators&quot; organization at one stage. In 1967, he married Evelyn Diehl.

The riding of Morris is generally considered safe for the Progressive Conservatives, and Pitura was elected without difficulty in the provincial election of 1995, defeating his nearest opponent (Liberal Bill Roth) by over 3000 votes. Shortly after his election, Pitura announced his opposition to the Canadian Wheat Board&#x27;s monopoly status, and his support for dual marketing (though there was little he or the Filmon government could do to mandate such a change).

On January 6, 1997, Pitura was appointed acting Minister of Government Services, probably in reflection of his previous work as a government employee. In 1998, Pitura and federal Cabinet Minister Ron Duhamel announced the construction of a flood protection dike at Ste. Agathe, as a response to serious flooding the previous year.

Pitura was re-elected in Morris in the provincial election of 1999, although the Progressive Conservatives were defeated at the provincial level. After four years on the opposition benches, Pitura announced his retirement from politics shortly before the provincial election of 2003. Pitura died on February 16, 2019, aged 75.

<text>Szentendre is a riverside town in Pest County, Hungary, between the capital city Budapest and Pilis-Visegrád Mountains. The town is known for its museums (most notably the Hungarian Open Air Museum), galleries, and artists.

Due to its historic architecture along with easy accessibility via rail and river, it has become a destination for tourists staying in Budapest. There are many facilities, including souvenir shops and restaurants, catering to these visitors.

==Name==
The name of the town is ultimately based on the Medieval Latin form &#x27; (&quot;St. Andrew&quot;). Because of the diverse mix of nationalities to have once settled in Szentendre, the settlement has a variety of names according to language. The Hungarian name for the town is &#x27;; the Croatian name is &#x27;; the German name is &#x27;; in Serbian, the name is &#x27; (); the Slovak name is &#x27;. Its name (&quot;&quot;) first appeared in a student&#x27;s will in 1146, which was confirmed by King Géza II. The 12th-century city centre was situated around the still existing St. Andrew&#x27;s Church on the other side of the Bükkös Brook.

==History==

The area where Szentendre is today was uninhabited when the Magyars arrived. In the 9th century, Árpád&#x27;s companion, the sacral prince Kurszán, settled here. He renovated the Roman fortress that had fallen into ruin and reestablished a settlement on the remains of the Roman buildings.

Little is known about the history of Szentendre between the 9th and 10th centuries. Some sources suggest that there was a settlement called Apurig in this area. The word &quot;apor&quot; means &quot;brook&quot; and so presumably the settlement was located on a small river-way. Based on maps of military surveys, there were five brooks in the area: Dera, Bükkös, Öregvíz and Sztelin. It is unknown as to which brook the Apor can be identified with.

The city was largely depopulated in the Ottoman era. According to a 17th-century census, only one family and their service staff remained here at that time.

 After the Ottomans were expelled from the area, foreign settlers moved to the settlement. Today evidence of the town&#x27;s prosperity in this time can be seen in the baroque style of the houses, the Mediterranean atmosphere of the town&#x27;s architecture, its churches, the cobblestoned streets, and its narrow alleys. During the Great Turkish War, Serbs were invited to emigrate to Hungary to evade the Ottoman Empire. Because of this invitation, there was a mass emigration of Serbs in 1690 to the Szentendre region. These Serbs left enduring traces on the townscape and its culture. The buildings in the city center have tried to preserve this Serbian influence in their architecture, but these buildings do not in fact date to the 17th century. Based on maps from the end of the century, the city center actually boasted other buildings at that time.

There was also considerable Dalmatian immigration. The Dalmatian families settled on Donkey Mountain where Dalmát Street preserves their memory today. Even in the 1980s, this street was inhabited exclusively by descendants of the original Dalmatians. These descendants now live throughout the city.

Although the Ottomans had decimated the population of the region, starting in the 1690s, the population slowly began to increase and in 1872 it reached a level when the town-like character began to dominate again instead of the village-like character. The public administration as well as the business establishments made it possible to practice all the privileges entailing a city. Szentendre was granted city-status in 1872. In 1888 the railway between Szentendre and Budapest was opened.

The calm provincial life of the city has attracted artists since the beginning of the 20th century. The Szentendre colony of artists came into existence in 1929. The so-called Szentendre School is connected with it. Today, more than two hundred fine and applied artists, authors, poets, musicians and actors live in the city.

The city was a small town until the 1970s; its population hardly attained four thousand. The city at that time included only two parts: the downtown and Donkey Mountain, the latter of which became a living space at the beginning of the twentieth century. These two parts of the town are separated from all the rest of Szentendre&#x27;s areas by road 11.

Around the historical inner city some smaller settlements joined the town in the course of the centuries, some of which are present day Szentendre&#x27;s traditional town areas such as Izbég and Derecske. Szentendre also contains green-belt areas such as Pannóniatelep, Püspökmajor, Pismány, &quot;Szarvashegy&quot;. By the end of the 1970s, due to a large-scale inner-city merger, the populated zone of the town enlarged considerably. By the beginning of the 21st century these areas were completely populated and the earlier small town attained the population of 25,000 in 2010. This expansion of the city practically ended traditional fruit-growing and gardening in Szentendre.

The Hungarian Open Air Museum (Skanzen), founded in 1967, shows the village and urban societies&#x27; different layers, including the various groups&#x27; interior furnishings and lifestyles from the end of the 18th to the middle of the 20th centuries. This museum includes Europe&#x27;s longest museum railway line, which was built in 2009.

The museum is visited by tourists from both Hungary and abroad.

The Witcher (TV series) (Netflix, 2019) used the museum grounds to depict the village that was the original home of the character Yennefer; this location was also used in scenes with the lead character, Ciri, at a time when she was in an area with a windmill.

==Railway==
 Szentendre is linked to Budapest by Line 5 of the BHÉV railway, which opened in 1888. This electric railway line operates a frequent train service between Szentendre and Batthyány tér metro station in Budapest via Békásmegyer.

== Arts ==

Szentendre has been the home of generations of Hungarian artists since the early 20th century. Szentendre Artists&#x27; Colony worked in the northern part of the town.

There are many museums and contemporary galleries representing the rich traditions of the visual art.

<text>Diphyllobothrium is a genus of tapeworms which can cause diphyllobothriasis in humans through consumption of or undercooked fish. The principal species causing diphyllobothriasis is &quot;D. latum&quot;, known as the broad or fish tapeworm, or broad fish tapeworm. &quot;D. latum&quot; is a pseudophyllid cestode that infects fish and mammals. &quot;D. latum&quot; is native to Scandinavia, western Russia, and the Baltics, though it is now also present in North America, especially the Pacific Northwest. In Far East Russia, &quot;D. klebanovskii&quot;, having Pacific salmon as its second intermediate host, was identified.

Other members of the genus &quot;Diphyllobothrium&quot; include &quot;D. dendriticum&quot; (the salmon tapeworm), which has a much larger range (the whole northern hemisphere), &quot;D. pacificum&quot;, &quot;D. cordatum&quot;, &quot;D. ursi&quot;, &quot;D. lanceolatum&quot;, &quot;D. dalliae&quot;, and &quot;D. yonagoensis&quot;, all of which infect humans only infrequently. In Japan, the most common species in human infection is &quot;D. nihonkaiense&quot;, which was only identified as a separate species from &quot;D. latum&quot; in 1986. More recently, a molecular study found &quot;D. nihonkaiense&quot; and &quot;D. klebanovskii&quot; to be a single species.
==Morphology==
The adult worm is composed of three fairly distinct morphological segments: the scolex (head), the neck, and the lower body. Each side of the scolex has a slit-like groove, which is a bothrium for attachment to the intestine. The scolex attaches to the neck, or proliferative region. From the neck grow many proglottid segments which contain the reproductive organs of the worm. &quot;D. latum&quot; is the longest tapeworm in humans, averaging ten meters long. Unlike many other tapeworms, &quot;Diphyllobothrium&quot; eggs are typically unembryonated when passed in human feces.

In adults, proglottids are wider than they are long (hence the name &quot;broad tapeworm&quot;). As in all pseudophyllid cestodes, the genital pores open midventrally.

==Life cycle==


Adult tapeworms may infect humans, canids, felines, bears, pinnipeds, and mustelids, though the accuracy of the records for some of the nonhuman species is disputed. Immature eggs are passed in feces of the mammal host (the definitive host, where the worms reproduce). After ingestion by a suitable freshwater crustacean such as a copepod (the first intermediate host), the coracidia develop into procercoid larvae. Following ingestion of the copepod by a suitable second intermediate host, typically a minnow or other small freshwater fish, the procercoid larvae are released from the crustacean and migrate into the fish&#x27;s flesh where they develop into a plerocercoid larvae (sparganum). The plerocercoid larvae are the infective stage for the definitive host (including humans).

Because humans do not generally eat undercooked minnows and similar small freshwater fish, these do not represent an important source of infection. Nevertheless, these small second intermediate hosts can be eaten by larger predator species, for example trout, perch, walleye, and pike. In this case, the sparganum can migrate to the musculature of the larger predator fish and mammals can acquire the disease by eating these later intermediate infected host fish raw or undercooked. After ingestion of the infected fish, the plerocercoids develop into immature adults and then into mature adult tapeworms which will reside in the small intestine. The adults attach to the intestinal mucosa by means of the two bilateral grooves (bothria) of their scolices. The adults can reach more than 10 m (up to 30 ft) in length in some species such as &quot;D. latum,&quot; with more than 3,000 proglottids. One or several of the tape-like proglottid segments (hence the name tapeworm) regularly detach from the main body of the worm and release immature eggs in freshwater to start the cycle over again. Immature eggs are discharged from the proglottids (up to 1,000,000 eggs per day per worm) and are passed in the feces. The incubation period in humans, after which eggs begin to appear in the feces is typically 4–6 weeks, but can vary from as short as 2 weeks to as long as 2 years.

== Disease ==
Diphyllobothriasis is considered a parasitic, zoonotic infection. Humans have been parasitized by these tapeworms for thousands of years. &quot;D. latum&quot; causes a wide spectrum of disease and severity. The tapeworm induces changes in the concentration of several immunomodulators in the host. It can also cause structural changes in the GI tract as it modulates neuroendocrine responses and enhances secretion and gut motility. Damage may also come from the body&#x27;s immune response against the worm and its millions of eggs (around 1 million/day) mediated by mast cells, eosinophilic cell degranulations resulting to inflammatory cytokines. Diphyllobothriosis is considered as the most important fish-borne zoonosis with up to 20 million individuals infected.

&quot;D. latum&quot; causes B12 deficiency in humans leading to megaloblastic or pernicious anemia. The worm absorbs around 80% of dietary B12 and prolonged infection can also cause abdominal pain, mechanical obstruction, and symptoms of iron deficiency anemia. Patients with prolonged infection of D. latum should be offered B12 supplementation along with anti-parasitics such as niclosamide or praziquantel.

<text>Garðarr Svavarsson (Old Norse: ; Modern Icelandic: ; Modern Swedish: ) was a Swede who briefly resided in Iceland, according to the Sagas. He is said to be the second Scandinavian to reach the island of Iceland after Naddod. He and his family appear in the Icelandic Sagas with the principal source from Haukr Erlendsson&#x27;s edition of Landnámabók. 

==Biography==
Svavarsson is described as a Swedish Viking who owned land in Zealand (in modern Denmark). He was married to a woman from the Hebrides. During the 860s, he needed to claim his inheritance from his father-in-law. During a voyage to these isles, he sailed into a storm at Pentland Firth. This storm pushed his ship far to the north until he reached the eastern coast of Iceland. He circumnavigated the island, becoming the first known person to do so and thus establishing that the landmass was an island. He went ashore at Skjálfandi where he built himself a house and stayed for the winter. Since then, the place located in North Eastern Iceland has been called Húsavík.

Having returned, he praised the new land and called it after his own name &quot;Garðarshólmi&quot; (see names of Iceland). Nothing is known of his fate thereafter, but his son, Uni danski (Uni the Dane), later emigrated to Iceland. He made a feeble attempt to win it for the Norwegian king with himself as earl. He had discussed this with the king but when the local farmers knew his intent, they would help him in no way and soon he was killed. 

Uni danski had a son, Hróar Tungugoði, who inherited the entire estate. In the Sagas of Icelanders, Hróar quarreled with other men and was twice challenged to a hill battle and won both times. He killed his opponents but was eventually murdered but then avenged by his son. Hróar&#x27;s wife was Arngunnur, sister of Gunnar Hámundarson, who is one of the main characters in &quot;Njáls saga&quot;, the longest and generally considered the greatest of the Icelandic Sagas.

In 1418, Thomas FitzGerald, 5th Earl of Desmond was dispossessed of his lands and deprived of his earldom by his paternal uncle, James FitzGerald, 6th Earl of Desmond, after Thomas had concluded a marriage far below his station to Catherine MacCormac of Abbeyfeale; Catherine was the daughter of one of Thomas&#x27;s dependants, William MacCormac, known as &quot;the Monk of Feale.&quot; A marriage between a man of Norman blood and a woman of Gaelic ancestry violated the Statutes of Kilkenny.

==Town==

The main feature in Abbeyfeale&#x27;s Square is a statue of Father William Casey. Fr. Casey was the parish priest from 1883 to 1907 and helped the tenant farmers fight against their landlords. The local Gaelic football team is named in his honour (Fr. Caseys GAA Club). Recently the town celebrated the centenary of Fr. Casey&#x27;s influence by having a Fr. Casey-themed Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade.

The May Bank Holiday weekend sees the town host the &quot;Fleadh by the Feale&quot; traditional music festival. The 2009 festival was the thirteenth of these annual events. The International Bone Playing Competition is one of the highlights of the festival and is held on the Bank Holiday Monday evening on an open-air stage in the town square.

The town is known for its musical traditions, and traditional musicians such as Donal Murphy and Eibhlin Healy have lived in the town.

There was a cinema in the town, opened by the Tobin family in the 1940s designed in the classical tradition. Its demise came about with the advent of the multi-complex and it closed in the early 1990s. It is now a protected building and still stands today. The town had a dancehall, &quot;The Abbey Ballroom&quot;, also established by the Tobin family in the 1930/1940s. Many big bands of the time played there. With the opening of the dance/pubs, it closed in the 1980s.

The town previously had an abbey, located in the centre of the town square, but this has since all but disappeared, and the only identifiable remnants are those used in the construction of the Roman Catholic Church in 1847, on the site of the current boys&#x27; national school on Church street. Church street as it is now known was originally named Chapel street, as can be seen in old-period OS maps of the town. The Geraldine Portrinard Castle (or Purt Castle) is situated about 2.5 km northwest of the town, on the north bank of the Feale.

==Transport==
Abbeyfeale railway station opened on 20 December 1880, but was finally closed on 3 November 1975. The Great Southern Trail is a greenway rail trail that follows the route of the former Limerick-Tralee railway line between Abbeyfeale and Rathkeale.
Bus 
Abbeyfeale is served by Bus Éireann routes 13 (Tralee-Limerick) and Route 14 (Killarney-Limerick) and Dublin Coach from Tralee/Killarney to Dublin

==Education==
Schools include Coláiste Íde agus Iosef, a secondary school serving Limerick and surrounding counties. The boys&#x27; school is called St Mary&#x27;s and the girls&#x27; school is called Scoil Mháithair Dé.

==Sports==
Abbeyfeale has several sporting clubs, including Father Caseys Gaelic football club, Abbeyfeale United FC soccer club, and Abbyefeale RFC (rugby union).

<doc id="1034843" wikidata="Q7871396" url="?curid=1034843" title="USS Lynx (1814)">
<text>USS &quot;Lynx&quot;, a 6-gun Baltimore Clipper rigged schooner, was built for the United States Navy by James Owner of Georgetown, Washington, D.C., in 1814, intended for service in one of the two raiding squadrons being built as part of President James Madison&#x27;s administration’s plan to establish a more effective Navy, one capable not only of breaking the British naval blockade, but also of raising havoc with the British merchant marine.

==Service history==
Though the War of 1812 ended by the time the schooner was completed, the ship was still placed in service in early 1815 and on 3 July sailed from Boston with the nine-ship squadron of Commodore William Bainbridge, bound for the Mediterranean to deal with the acts of the Barbary pirates against American commerce.

Arriving off the North African coast by the beginning of August, &quot;Lynx&quot; found that a squadron under Commodore Stephen Decatur had already achieved satisfactory agreements to American treaty demands. The schooner remained in the Mediterranean, however, until late in the year as part of a show of force led by Commodore Bainbridge&#x27;s flagship , the Navy&#x27;s first ship of the line, to encourage the Barbary States to keep the peace treaties just concluded. Returning to the United States, the ship made a preliminary survey of the northeastern coast during 1817, Lt. George W. Stover in command, at times carrying Commodore William Bainbridge, now Commandant of the Charlestown, Massachusetts, Navy Yard, and Brigadier General Joseph Gardner Swift aboard during her voyage.

Following this duty, &quot;Lynx&quot; sailed for the Gulf of Mexico to operate along the southern U.S. coast and in the West Indies suppressing piracy, continuing on this service for the next two years. On 24 October 1819, while under command of Lt. John Ripley Madison, she captured two schooners and two boats in the Gulf of Mexico, filled with pirates and booty, and 11 days later, on 9 November found another pirate boat in Galveston Bay and took her. Remaining off the southern coast through the end of the year, the &quot;Lynx&quot; departed St. Mary&#x27;s, Georgia, on 11 January 1820, bound for Kingston, Jamaica, to continue her service suppressing pirates. She was never seen nor heard from again, and despite the searching of schooner , no trace of her or her 47-man crew was ever found.

<doc id="1034846" wikidata="Q352590" url="?curid=1034846" title="Adare">
<text>Adare (; ) is a village in County Limerick, Ireland, located southwest of the city of Limerick. Adare is designated as a heritage town by the Irish government. The village is in a townland and civil parish of the same name.

==History==
The River Maigue is tidal as far as Adare, with the settlement forming around the eastern bank of the Maigue overlooking the fording point from which the village gets its name. An annalistic reference is made in the medieval Annals of Inisfallen at AI982.4 &quot;The Tree of Mag Adar was broken by Leth Cuinn&quot;. Owing to the strategic importance of the river crossing the Desmond castle was built overlooking the site near Ardshanbally (derived from &quot;Ard an tSeanbhaile&quot; - &#x27;high ground of the old town&#x27;), and was first mentioned in 1226. Historically a market town, in the Middle Ages, Adare had three monasteries.

On 7 June 1996, Detective Garda Jerry McCabe was killed by members of the Provisional IRA, during the attempted robbery of a post office van in the town.

===Desmond Castle===

A castle or fortress is said to have first been built with an ancient ring-fort, by the O&#x27;Donovans, rulers of the region into the 12th century, and afterwards to have passed into the possession of the Kildare branch of the FitzGerald dynasty, who may be responsible for the majority of the remains of the present fortress (which occurred with Croom Castle, also on the Maigue). Desmond Castle, as it is popularly known (after the FitzGeralds of Desmond), stands on the north bank of the Maigue. An extensive renovation has been in progress on the castle since 1996 and supervised tours are offered in the summer months. This is one of a series of significant Desmond properties, which also include Desmond Hall and Castle in Newcastle West, another castle in Askeaton and Castle Matrix near Rathkeale, further west in County Limerick.

===Augustinian Priory===
Adare&#x27;s Augustinian Priory was founded in 1316 by John FitzThomas FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Kildare. The Priory was suppressed in the reign of Henry VIII. In 1807, the church of the Priory was given to the local Church of Ireland congregation as the parish church. In 1814, the refectory was roofed and converted into a schoolhouse. Between 1852 and 1854, a second restoration of the church was undertaken by Caroline, Countess of Dunraven.

===Franciscan Abbey===
The Franciscan friary, also known as the friary of St Michael the Archangel, was founded in 1464 by Thomas Fitz-Maurice, 7th Earl of Kildare and his wife Joan, and completed two years later. It is currently a ruin and is located inside the Adare Manor Golf Club.

===Trinitarian Abbey===
The Trinitarian Order established their only monastery in Ireland in Adare in 1230. It is believed that the Trinitarian monks who came to Adare may have come from Scotland. The Abbey was restored in 1811 by the first Earl of Dunraven as the Catholic Parish church.

===Adare Manor===
Adare Manor is a mansion located on lands on the banks of the River Maigue and the former seat of the Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl. The present building was built in the early 19th-century in a Tudor-revival style, while retaining part of an earlier structure. It is now the Adare Manor Hotel &amp; Golf Resort, a luxury resort hotel, reopened after an extensive restoration in October 2017.

===Architecture===
The main street combines typical Irish architecture with the English styled buildings and infrastructure purpose-built for the Dunraven estate as an estate village. Examples of the latter architectural forms include the thatched cottages near the entrance to Adare Manor. The later 20th century additions were designed by Detmar Blow.

==Economy==
Adare is a tourist destination and the local heritage centre, which gives insight into the history of the village, also hosts a number of craft shops. The village is a wedding and conference venue. Adare has two 18-hole golf courses - the Adare Golf Club, which incorporates a driving range and which was the site of the 2007 and 2008 Irish Open, the Adare Manor Golf Club and a pitch and putt course. Adare also has an equestrian centre, located in Clonshire.

===Schools===
There are four primary schools in Adare: St Joseph&#x27;s National School (Catholic, boys), Our Lady&#x27;s Abbey National School (Catholic, girls), St Nicholas&#x27; National School (Church of Ireland, mixed) and Shountrade National School (Catholic, mixed). The village&#x27;s secondary school, Adare CBS, closed in 1973.

===Transport===
The main Limerick-Tralee road, the N21 passes through the village, causing persistent heavy congestions. In late 2015 a corridor for the long-delayed bypass was chosen that realigns the N21 road north of the village as part of a new dual carriageway planned to link Foynes port to Limerick.

Adare is a stop on Bus Éireann&#x27;s Limerick-Tralee/Killarney bus service and Dublin Coach&#x27;s Dublin-Tralee/Killarney service. Both run hourly.

The disused &quot;Limerick-Foynes&quot; railway line passes 800 metres (half a mile) to the north-west of the village. Adare railway station, opened on 12 July 1856 by the Limerick &amp; Foynes Railway company, was closed to passengers on 4 February 1963 and to freight on 2 December 1974. The line to Foynes continued to carry freight traffic until it was mothballed in 2001 and has seen no trains since 7 May 2002 when the annual Irish Rail weed spray train visited the line. The line, designated an engineers siding, is still officially open for traffic.

==Sport==

The local Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) club, Adare GAA, was founded in 1929. The club&#x27;s senior hurling team has won the county championship in 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 and 2009. In football, the club won the Limerick Senior Football Championship title for the first time in 2017. The club retained the title in 2018.

The local association football (soccer) team is Adare United AFC. The club play at Deer Park Field, situated off the Blackabbey Road in the village. Founded in 1937, Adare United participates in the Limerick Desmond Schoolboys/Girls League at Under 8, U10, U12, U14 and U16 age groups and in the Limerick Desmond League at Junior (adult) and Youth level. The 2006/07 Season saw the club form its first ladies team, who compete in the Limerick Desmond Ladies League.

The Irish Open golf championship was staged at Adare in 2007 and 2008. There are two 18-hole golf courses in the village: The Adare Golf Club which is on the grounds of the Adare Manor Hotel, and the Adare Manor Golf Club, which is a separate entity.

In athletics, the village has hosted the annual Adare 10K, held every February, since 1994.

<text>Athea ( ; or &quot;Áth Té&quot;) is a village in west County Limerick, Ireland. Athea has a Roman Catholic church, and is the centre for the parish of Athea, which encompasses several nearby townlands.

==History==
The community was dependent on agriculture and a creamery was built near the River Galey which acted as the centrepoint for local trade. A primary school was built near the creamery to cope with the rising younger population. Over time, cottages and workshops lined the main road to create the village of Athea. New local roads were built to neighbouring Moyvane and off the main Listowel-Limerick and Glin-Abbeyfeale roads. The river was the primary water source as well as its use for drainage.

The Catholic population were forbidden to practise their faith under Penal Laws, and the first church wasn&#x27;t built in Athea until the early 19th century. Prior to this locals congregated each Sunday at a Mass rock to the east of the village.

==Geography==
===Topography===
Athea is situated on the river Galey and the crossroads of the R523 (Reens - Listowel) and R524 (Glin - Abbeyfeale) regional roads. It is a 3 km east of the Limerick/Kerry border in the hills of west Limerick. Its highest point is in the Parkanna townland where, at 220 m above sea level, surrounding towns and counties can be seen.

The river Galey is a tributary to the larger River Feale. The name is derived from the Irish language &quot;Abhainn na Gáile&quot;, River of the Gaille, a tribe who lived along its banks. There are two bridges across the river; the R523/R524 intersection bridge just east of the village and &quot;Barry&#x27;s Bridge&quot;, 2 km northwest of the village. Athea has suffered damage and disruption over several years, when the River Galley flooded in 2005, 2008, 2009 and 2015. Proposals and funding to address the issue had been muted for several years, and a civil engineering consultancy were appointed by Limerick County Council in October 2019 to &quot;assess, develop and design&quot; a flood relief scheme.

===Townlands===
The large parish of Athea is divided into 25 townlands:
* Athea Lower [Áth an tSléibhe Íochtair - the fort of the mountain]
* Athea Upper [Áth an tSléibhe Uachtar - the fort of the mountain]

* Clash South [An Chlais - the trench]
* Coole East [An Chúil - the corner]

* Keale South [An Caol - the narrow feature]
* Knockdown [Cnoc Donn - brown hill]
* Knockfinisk [Cnoc Finnisce - hill of bright water]
* Knocknagorna [Cnoc na gCoirneach - the hill of the clerics]

* Tooradoo [Na Tuara Dubha - the black animal enclosures]
* Tooreendonnell [Tuairín Dónaill - the small animal enclosure of Dónall]

===Electoral division===
Athea is situated in the constituency of Limerick West; the parish itself is subdivided into two electoral areas - the Newcastlewest electoral area (predominantly south of the river Galey) and the Rathkeale electoral area (north of the river) which are used mainly in local elections. At European level, Athea is in the constituency of Ireland South. At election times, the school is used as the polling station.

==Built heritage==
Colbert Street and Dalton Street are the main streets in the village. St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Church is located on Colbert Street and the village has two graveyards, Holy Cross on the outskirts of the village and The &quot;Old Graveyard&quot; in Templeathea just over a mile away.

===Con Colbert Memorial Hall===
Opened in January 1974 by Erskine Hamilton Childers, Con Colbert Memorial Hall is named after one of the executed leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising. The hall is used for meetings, sports events and other gatherings. Since its opening, it has been extended to incorporate a sports complex. The cost of this renovation neared €1 million and despite charity donations, government grants and other fundraising efforts, the community hall committee is still faced with a large (if decreasing) debt.

===John Paul II Footbridge===
Athea&#x27;s only pedestrian bridge was opened by Donal Murray, Bishop of Limerick, in 2005. The bridge is located next to the existing road bridge at the eastern end of the main street. It had been proposed for years for the local school pupils who were crossing the busy road bridge and was seen as a health and safety hazard sharing the bridge with cars. The bridge is 2m wide and 11m long. It was commissioned by Athea Community Council Ltd. who raised €260,000. The debt was reduced to €27,000 by the &quot;Lucky Numbers&quot; drawings, held Saturday nights.

===St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Church===
St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church is located on the main street and was built in 1832. It underwent renovations in 1862 and 1980s. The church spire can be seen from all approach roads to the village.

===Monuments===
The &quot;Goold Monument&quot;, located in Upper Athea commemorates James Goold, a landlord who, at the time of the Great Famine refused to evict tenants who couldn&#x27;t pay rent. Dated to 1863, the monument comprises a 4 m high Celtic cross which stands just off the road to Listowel.

The &quot;Olympic Statue&quot;, colloquially called &quot;the feet&quot; is a monument in The Square commemorating two Irish olympic medalists who were originally from Athea - Tim Ahearne and Dan Ahearne. Tim Ahearne won gold in the triple jump in the 1908 Olympics, while his younger brother Dan Ahearne is known for setting a world record in 1909. The sculpture depicts two golden feet with wings spread out.

==Culture ==
===Events===
Annually large events such as the Vintage Rally, TradFéile and Athea Motorcycle Road Races are held during summer months. The latter, the Athea Motorcycle Road Races, is a two-day event taking place on a Saturday and Sunday at the end of June. In 2007 the race attracted an estimated 18,000 visitors to the village according to Gardaí. Names such as Martin Finnegan and William Dunlop have taken part in the event in the past. A fun fair is usually brought to the village the week before the festival.

===Parklands===
The &quot;Giant&#x27;s Garden&quot; is a walk from the Memorial Hall to Holy Cross Cemetery in Templeathea. It is named after a legend that incorporates a giant carrying his deceased mother on his shoulders to be buried. The Giant&#x27;s Garden overlooks Athea Village as well as the hills and river southwest of the village.

===Media===
The &quot;Athea &amp; District News&quot; newsletter is published by local print company Cáirde Dúchais on a weekly basis. It features local columnists and current affairs. It also contains articles for the neighbouring towns and villages of Knockdown, Carrigkerry and Abbeyfeale.

The &quot;Weekly Observer&quot; newspaper which contains articles for towns over much of west Limerick has an &quot;Athea Notes&quot; column resulting in it being a household newspaper in Athea.

==Sport==

Athea GAA (&quot;Áth an tSléibhe CLG&quot;) is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club, and its team colours are maroon and white. The club is located in Templeathea, 1 km east of the village on the R523. Athea Credit Union are the primary sponsors of the club.

The Athea Blazers Basketball Club was formed in 2005 and has its base is at Con Colbert Memorial Hall. Fishing also takes place in the area.

91% of census respondents in Athea listed their religion as Roman Catholic, 7% other stated religions and approximately 2% no stated religion or no religion.

==Education==
The primary school - Athea National School (Athea NS) - was built in 1921. Prior to this, a small thatched schoolhouse was located centrally in the village (now no longer in use). Athea NS is located in Templeathea townland, just east of the village centre. When opened in 1921, it had a capacity of 100 students. A large extension to the school was officially opened in 2009. Today&#x27;s building houses five classrooms with toilet facilities in each room, a principal&#x27;s office, a secretary&#x27;s office, a library, a computer room and a preschool. The school is headed by the Athea National School Board of Management.

Ballingarry is one of 19 civil parishes in the barony of Slievardagh, and also an ecclesiastical parish in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly. Ballingarry village is situated near the Kilkenny border on route R691 in the Slieveardagh range. Historically, the area was associated with the coal mining industry.

==History==


Ballingarry is best known for the rebellion that broke out there on 29 July 1848 against British rule. The site of this uprising, the McCormack House, known also as the Warhouse (officially Famine Warhouse 1848) has since been designated as a national memorial and historical building by the State. It was here during the ill-fated rebellion that the national tricolour of green, white and orange was unfurled for the first time by the rebels, led by William Smith O&#x27;Brien, thus emulating the French rebels who also took to the streets with their tricolour for the first time earlier that year. Sub-Inspector Trant and 46 other local policemen took refuge from the rebels in a large two-story farmhouse, taking the five young children in the house as hostages. They barricaded themselves in, pointing their guns from the windows. The house was surrounded by the rebels and a stand-off ensued. Mrs. Margaret McCormack, the owner of the house and mother of the children, demanded to be let into her house, but the police refused and would not release the children. Mrs. McCormack found O&#x27;Brien reconnoitring the house from the out-buildings, and asked him what was to become of her children and her house.

O&#x27;Brien and Mrs. McCormack went up to the parlour window of the house to speak to the police. Through the window, O&#x27;Brien stated, &quot;We are all Irishmen—give up your guns and you are free to go.&quot; O&#x27;Brien shook hands with some of the police through the window. The initial report to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland stated that a constable fired the first shot at O&#x27;Brien, who was attempting to negotiate. General firing then ensued between the police and the rebels. O&#x27;Brien had to be dragged out of the line of fire by James Stephens and Terence Bellew MacManus, both of whom were wounded. As he tried to flee the district, William Smith O&#x27;Brien was arrested at Thurles railway station on 5 August. He and the other three leaders were found guilty of treason and were among the last people to be sentenced to &#x27;hanging, drawing and quartering&#x27;. At the insistence of Queen Victoria herself, who thought the sentencing too harsh for the crime committed, they were transported to Australia.

==Amenities==
On Ballingarry&#x27;s main street, there is a church, primary school and shops. The nearby collieries of Ballingarry are historically associated with anthracite mining in Ireland.

==Economy==
The area was the centre of an active coal-mining industry for nearly two hundred years. However, economic factors led to the demise of Ballingarry Coal Mines in the late 20th century. With the mining shafts now flooded and the associated infra-structure derelict or removed, there is little or no prospect of its revival.

==Sport==
Ballingarry GAA club is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club and has a pitch in the village.

<doc id="1034858" wikidata="Q352004" url="?curid=1034858" title="Vasile Alecsandri">
<text>Vasile Alecsandri (; 21 July 182122 August 1890) was a Romanian patriot, poet, dramatist, politician and diplomat. He was one of the key figures during the 1848 revolutions in Moldavia and Wallachia. He fought for the unification of the Romanian Principalities, writing &quot;Hora Unirii&quot; in 1856 and giving up his candidacy for the title of prince of Moldavia, in favor of Alexandru Ioan Cuza. He became the first minister of foreign affairs of Romania and was one of the founding members of the Romanian Academy. Alecsandri was a prolific writer, contributing to Romanian literature with poetry, prose, several plays, and collections of Romanian folklore, being considered, alongside Mihai Eminescu, which admired and was inspired by the writings of Alecsandri, as one of the most important Romanian writers in the second half of the 19th century.

==Early life==
===Origins and childhood===
Alecsandri was born in the Moldavian town of Bacău and he was of Greek origin. His parents were Vasile Alecsandri, a middle-ranking nobleman, from the noble Greek family of Alecsandri, and Elena Cozoni, a Romanianized Greek woman. They had seven children, of which three survived: one daughter, Catinca, and two sons, Iancu — a future army colonel – and Vasile.

The family prospered in the lucrative business of salt and cereals trade. In 1828, they purchased a large estate in Mircești, a village near Siret River. The young Vasile spent time there studying with a devout monk from Maramureș, Gherman Vida, and playing with Vasile Porojan, a Gypsy boy who became a dear friend. Both characters would later appear in his work.
===Adolescence and youth===
Between 1828 and 1834, he studied at the Victor Cuenim &quot;pensionnat&quot;, an elite boarding school for boys in Iași. He moved to Paris in 1834, where he dabbled in chemistry, medicine, and law, but soon abandoned all in favor of what he called his &quot;lifelong passion&quot;, literature. He penned his first literary essays in 1838 in French, which he had mastered to perfection during his stay in Paris. After a brief return home, he left for Western Europe again, visiting Italy, Spain, and southern France.

===Romantic interest===
A year later, Alecsandri attended a party celebrating the name day of Costache Negri, a family friend. He there fell in love with Negri&#x27;s sister. The 21-year-old and not long divorced Elena Negri responded enthusiastically to the 24-year-old youngster&#x27;s love declarations. Alecsandri began writing love poems until a sudden illness forced Elena to head abroad to Venice. He met her there, where they shared two torrid months.

They cruised to Austria, Germany, and to Alecsandri&#x27;s former romping grounds, France. Elena&#x27;s chest illness aggravated in Paris, and after a brief stint in Italy, they both boarded a French ship to return home 25 April 1847. Tragedy struck on the ship, when Elena died in her lover&#x27;s arms. Alecsandri channeled his mourning into a poem, &quot;Steluța&quot; (&quot;Little Star&quot;). Later, he dedicated his &quot;Lăcrimioare&quot; (&quot;Little Tears&quot;) collection of poems to her.

==Midlife==
===Political involvement===
In 1848, he became one of the leaders of the revolutionary movement based in Iași. He wrote a widely read poem urging the public to join the cause, &quot;Către Români&quot; (&quot;To Romanians&quot;), later renamed &quot;Deșteptarea României&quot; (&quot;Romania&#x27;s Awakening&quot;). Together with Mihail Kogălniceanu and Costache Negri, he wrote a manifesto of the revolutionary movement in Moldavia, &quot;Dorințele partidei naționale din Moldova&quot; (&quot;Wishes of the National Party of Moldavia&quot;).

However, as revolution failed, he fled Moldavia through Transylvania and Austria, moving on to Paris, where he continued to write political poems.

===Literary achievements===
After two years, he returned to a triumphant staging of his new comedy, &quot;Chirița în Iași&quot;. He toured the Moldavian countryside, collecting, reworking, and arranging a vast array of Romanian folklore, which he published in two installments, in 1852 and 1853. The poems included in these two enormously popular collections became the cornerstone of the emerging Romanian identity, especially the ballads &quot;Miorița&quot;, &quot;Toma Alimoș&quot;, &quot;Mânăstirea Argeșului&quot;, and &quot;Novac și Corbul.&quot; His volume of original poetry, &quot;Doine și Lăcrămioare&quot;, further cemented his reputation.

Broadly revered in Romanian cultural circles, he oversaw the establishment of &quot;România Literară&quot;, to which writers from both Moldavia and Wallachia contributed. He was one of the most vocal unionists, supporting the union the two Romanian provinces, Moldavia and Wallachia. In 1856, he published in Mihail Kogălniceanu&#x27;s newspaper, Steaua Dunării, the poem &quot;Hora Unirii&quot;, which became the anthem of the unification movement.

===New romantic interest===
The end of 1855 saw Alecsandri pursuing a new romantic interest, in spite of promises made to Elena Negri on her deathbed. At age 35, the now renowned poet and public figure fell in love with the young Paulina Lucasievici, the daughter of an innkeeper. The romance moved at a lightning pace: they moved in together to Alecsandri&#x27;s estate at Mircești and, in 1857, their daughter Maria was born.

===Political fulfilment===
Alecsandri found satisfaction in the advancement of those political causes he had long championed. The two Romanian provinces united and he was appointed minister of External Affairs by Alexandru Ioan Cuza. He toured the West, pleading to some of his friends and acquaintances in Paris to acknowledge the newly formed nation and support its emergence in the turbulent Balkan area.

==Retreat at Mircești==
The diplomatic tours tired him. In 1860, he settled in Mircești for what would be the rest of his life. He married Paulina more than a decade and a half later, in 1876.

Between 1862 and 1875, Alecsandri wrote 40 lyrical poems, including &quot;Miezul Iernii, &quot;Serile la Mircești, &quot;Iarna,&quot; &quot;La Gura Sobei&quot;, &quot;Oaspeții Primăverii&quot;, and &quot;Malul Siretului.&quot; He also dabbled in epic poems, collected in the volume &quot;Legende&quot;, and he dedicated a series of poems to the soldiers who participated in the Romanian War of Independence. He also wrote the lyrics of Ștefan Nosievici&#x27;s march &quot;Drum bun&quot;.

In 1879, his &quot;Despot-Vodă&quot; drama received the award of the Romanian Academy. He continued to be a prolific writer, finishing a fantastic comedy, &quot;Sânziana și Pepelea,&quot; (1881) and two dramas, &quot;Fântâna Blanduziei&quot; (1883) and &quot;Ovidiu&quot; (1884).

In 1881, he wrote Trăiască Regele (&quot;Long Live the King&quot;), which became the national anthem of the Kingdom of Romania from 1884 until the abolition of the monarchy in 1947.

Alecsandri was also a member of the Macedo-Romanian Cultural Society.

Long suffering from cancer, Alecsandri died in 1890 at his estate in Mircești.

==Politics==
Alecsandri had an important political career. He was one of the supporters of slave emancipation. He was antisemitic, although, according to some Romanian historians (including Neagu Djuvara), he had distant Jewish roots.
The appearance of the literary stereotype of the &quot;Polish Jew,&quot; or Ostjude, in Romanian literature was largely due to Vasile Alecsandri, the most important and most popular writer of the time. The Jew was depicted with sidecurls, and caftan, he used characteristic jargon and was portrayed as having &quot;typical&quot; personality traits — he was an unscrupulous cheat, a profit–hungry usurer, an exploiter and &quot;poisoner&quot; of the peasant.

<text>Bruff () is a town in east County Limerick, in the midwest of Ireland, located on the old Limerick–Cork road (R512). The town lies on the Morning Star river, with two bridges in the town itself. The horseshoe lake of Lough Gur is nearby. The town is in a townland and civil parish of the same name.

==Name==
The town&#x27;s official name in Irish is &quot;An Brú&quot;, historically written as &quot;Brugh&quot;. Older spellings in English, dating from 1200 onward, include Brun, Bruun, Bruin, Brugh, Browe, and Broff, Brown, Braun, Braff, Bruno, Bruneau, and An Bru’ because of its close association with the Anglo-Norman De Lacy family. The town&#x27;s name was also rendered in Irish as &quot;Brú an Léisigh&quot;; it is believed that a modern name for the town, &quot;Brú na nDéise&quot;, is a corruption of this name that was popularised from the early 1900s on.

==History==

Historical artefacts found around the area date back to the Stone Age, with various buildings up to the early Christian era still extant. In the sixteenth century, Bruff was granted to the Standish family, from whom it passed by inheritance to the Hartstonge Baronets, and ultimately to the Earl of Limerick.

The town was the site of heavy fighting in the Battle of Killmallock during the Irish Civil War. Near the Catholic Church, there is a large statue of Sean Wall, commander of the East Limerick Irish Republican Army and chairman of Limerick County Council until his death on 6May 1921 during the War of Independence.

The former seat of the O&#x27;Grady family, Kilballyowen, is near Bruff. Bruff is also the hometown of the American missionary and bishop John Joseph Hogan (1829–1913).

The US President John F. Kennedy was a descendant of the Fitzgeralds of Bruff. His daughter, Caroline Kennedy, visited the town in 2013.

==Sport==
The town has Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), Pitch &amp; Putt, hockey, soccer, and rugby union clubs. 

The rugby club, Bruff R.F.C., is the home club of John Hayes, the Ireland rugby union international. The GAA club, Bruff GAA, won the Limerick Intermediate Hurling Championship in 2014. Bruff is also home to Limerick F.C.&#x27;s Kirby O&#x27;Sullivan Sports, Social and Business Park.

==Development and economy==
Bruff town has been classified as a satellite town of Limerick City. Expansion plans for the town were laid out in the development plan published by Limerick County Council in 2012.

Ard Scoil Mhuire, the only secondary school in the town, has been closed down, its former campus is now home to the Kirby O&#x27;Sullivan Sports, Social and Business Park. There are several pubs, restaurants, shops (including a Eurospar and Centra), a pharmacy and a post office in the town.

==Tourism==
Bruff&#x27;s Cultural and Arts Society organises an Annual Summer Festival, an event held annually since its inception in 2006. It includes the Morning Star Rose Competition and the Morning Star Escort Competition (since 2008). The Sean Wall Committee organise a &quot;Bloomsday in Bruff&quot; festival every year on 16 June. A number of murals have been painted on the walls of buildings in the town.

Accommodation in the town is provided in what used to be the old AIB Bank, known as &quot;The Old Bank&quot;, which had also served as the Garda station in the town.

==People==

<doc id="1034865" wikidata="Q2670286" url="?curid=1034865" title="Croom, County Limerick">
<text>Croom () is a village in County Limerick, Ireland. It is located just off the N20 (which has bypassed the town since 2001) on the River Maigue. It is 8 km southeast of Adare on the N20. The village is in a townland and civil parish of the same name.

==History==

Cromadh (now Croom) was a village in the territory of the Uí Fidgenti, and one of the seats of the O’Donovans of the Ui Fidgheinte, which flourished from the late 4th century to the mid 12th century. A hermitage, Dísert Óengusa, was founded nearby by Óengus of Tallaght around the year AD 780. The townland is located on the River Maigue, which although now having a tidal flow only to Adare, in ancient years the river had a tidal flow past Croom, making it a transit route for the Viking ships traversing inland from the Shannon during the 9th and 10th centuries. Contacts arising along the Maigue River between Danish Vikings and the Uí Donnabháins provide an insight into the alliance between the two groups in the late 10th century.

John O’Donovan claimed in an appendix to the Annals of the Four Masters that Croom derived its name from Ancrom O&#x27;Donovan Crom Ua Donnabáin, who was slain in Innis Beale Antha Dos (now Broadford) in 1254, based on the similarity of Ancrom with Crom. However, that claim has been thoroughly discredited.

The earliest mention of Cromadh in the historical annals was in 1151, when &quot;A great predatory excursion was made by Ruaidhrí, son of Toirdhealbhach Ua Conchobhair, into Thomond; and he carried away many cows, and burned Cromadh&quot;. This event took place only three years after Turlogh O’Brien, King of Munster in 1148, and whom alternatively allied with and opposed Ruaidhrí Ua Conchobhair, defeated the Danes at the nearby fort of Rathmore. The burning of Croom in 1151 should be viewed in the larger context of leading powers continuing to punish and push the O’Donovans with their Danish alliances from their historical territory, which continued for another century as new Anglo Saxon powers arose from the Fitzgeralds, Butlers, Roches and whom competed with the O’Briens, O’Connors and MacCarthys for the Ui Fidgheinte (Ui Chairpre and Ui Chonaill) territories.

Ultimately, in the early 13th century, the lands surrounding Croom were given to the Fitzgeralds of Kildare. The Earls of Kildare continued to administer and build in the area of Croom through the end of the 16th century, and the competition for control of the Croom area was reduced to regional contests between the Earls of Desmond and the Earls of Kildare. Both houses associated their war cries with their territory: the war cry of the Geraldines of Kildare was Cromadh-abú (&#x27;Victory to Croom&#x27;), with various spellings Croom Abú. For comparison, the war-cry of the Desmond Geraldines was Seanaid-abú, associated with Shannid Castle, or Shannid Forever.

==Places of interest==

Croom is home to Croom Castle, rebuilt by the FitzGeralds and Fitzmaurices from an earlier O&#x27;Donovan fortress, which may or may not have first been destroyed. In any case, it was restored in the 19th century. In the 18th century, it was the meeting-place of the &quot;Maigue poets.&quot; West of Croom are the ruins of a 15th-century church (National Monument) and a round tower (12th century), the top part of which is missing.
To the east is Croom Hospital which began life in 1852 as a workhouse, and became a hospital in 1924. Along the river Maigue is a ruin mill along with a newer mill, built by Henry Lyons in 1788 and was operational until 1927.
In late 2014, a new Civic Centre was opened which includes a restaurant, library, public computers and function hall.

==Transport==
Croom railway station opened on 1 August 1862, closed for passenger traffic on 31 December 1934 and for goods traffic on 9 September 1963, finally closing altogether on 27 March 1967.

The town is bypassed by the N20 &quot;Croom Bypass&quot; (2001). Bus Eireann provides public transport between Croom, Limerick and Charleville.

==Sport==
The thoroughbred horse stud Islanmore Stud is on the south side of the village. The original 18th-century house was built for a younger brother of the Earl of Dunraven.

The local GAA club is Croom GAA. Croom United F.C. is a soccer club in the area.

==Education==
Croom has two schools, a primary school named &quot;St. Marys&quot; and a secondary school named &quot;Coláiste Chiaráin&quot;.

<doc id="1034869" wikidata="Q6598455" url="?curid=1034869" title="List of stewards of the Manor of Northstead">
<text>The office of Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead functions as a procedural device to allow a member of Parliament (MP) to resign from the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. As members of the House of Commons are forbidden from formally resigning, a legal fiction is used to circumvent this prohibition: appointment to an &quot;office of profit under The Crown&quot; disqualifies an individual from sitting as an MP. As such, several such positions are maintained to allow MPs to resign. Currently, the offices of Steward of the Manor of Northstead and Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds are used, and are specifically designated for this purpose under the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975; several other offices have also been used historically. The appointment is traditionally made by the chancellor of the Exchequer. The position was reworked in 1861 by William Ewart Gladstone, who was worried about the honour conferred by appointment to people such as Edwin James, who had fled to the United States over £100,000 in debt. As such, the letter by the chancellor was rewritten to omit any references to honour.

The office was first used in this way on 20 March 1844 to allow Sir George Henry Rose, MP for Christchurch, to resign his seat. Appointees to the offices of Steward of the Manor of Northstead and Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds are alternated so that two MPs can resign at once (as happened on 23 January 2017 when Tristram Hunt and Jamie Reed resigned). However, every new appointment revokes the previous one, so there is no difficulty in situations in which more than two resign, such as the 1985 walkout of Ulster Unionist MPs when several separate appointments were made on a single day. If a resigning MP wishes to contest the following by-election, as Douglas Carswell did in 2014, they need to resign the stewardship to avoid further disqualification.

The incumbent steward of the Manor of Northstead is Scott Benton, formerly the Independent (elected Conservative) MP for Blackpool South.

Some former MPs have held both offices of Steward of the Manor of Northstead and of the Chiltern Hundreds. These include:

* John William Logan
* Boris Johnson — when he resigned his seat of Henley in 2008

<text>Fethard (; ) is a small town in County Tipperary, Ireland. Dating to the Norman invasion of Ireland, the town&#x27;s walls were first laid-out in the 13th century, with some sections of these defensive fortifications surviving today.

Fethard is located east of Cashel on the &quot;Clashawley River&quot; where the R692, R689 and R706 regional roads intersect. It is a civil parish in the barony of Middle Third and in the ecclesiastical parish of &quot;Fethard and Killusty&quot; in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly. , the town&#x27;s population was 1,738.

== History ==

Fethard was founded in the early 13th century during the Norman invasion of Ireland. While the low hill, on which the town stands, may have been the location of a pre-Norman church, the first evidence of significant settlement dates from 1201, when a Norman lord, likely William de Braose, settled here.

Fethard was laid-out with a market area, a church and graveyard, and a regular pattern of streets. Its economy was supported by the area&#x27;s arable farmland. Fethard&#x27;s founding charter gave it the status of a &#x27;borough&#x27; and provided it with a constitution. Under this constitution, the town&#x27;s people (burgesses) had fixed annual rents, access to a court, and defined fines for certain offences.
The town and lands of Fethard passed out of William de Braose&#x27;s hands in 1208 following a dispute with King John. In 1215 Fethard was granted to the archbishops of Cashel, and it remained part of the archepiscopal estates until the 16th century. At the start of the 14th century, an Augustinian Friary was established outside the town.

Because of some lawlessness in the town&#x27;s hinterland (marked, for example, when the nearby woods of Thomas de St Aubin were cleared because some travelling merchants had been robbed or killed), defensive walls were built around Fethard and other towns in the area. The first reference to the walling of Fethard dates to 1292 when the king allowed levies to be applied (over seven years) on items sold in the town, with the collected funds allocated to &quot;the inclosing of their vill and the greater security of Ireland&quot;. Records of money still being collected (to fund wall building) date to the 14th century, with another grant issued for Fethard in 1375. This grant specified that stone walls were to be built, suggesting that the earlier town walls were made of earth and timber.
The town received a royal charter from Edward VI in 1552–3, allowing it a corporation in perpetuity, composed of one Sovereign, one Provost, Burgesses and inhabitants. The next royal charter was issued in 1608. A figure in the attainment of this second charter was Sir John Everard. John Everard, a lawyer and member of a local landed family, served the Butler clan and Earl of Ormond. His performances as a justice in the Earl&#x27;s liberty of Tipperary saw him appointed by Elizabeth I as Second Justice of the Court of King&#x27;s Bench (Ireland) in 1602. Although the Everards were Catholic, John Everard (by this time &quot;Sir&quot; John Everard) pledged allegiance to the Crown, and when he surrendered all his property to the Crown in 1607, it was immediately granted back to him. His good favour with the Crown was a factor in Fethard attaining a new charter in 1608.

In the new charter, the town was described as &quot;a place of strength surrounded with a fair strong wall&quot;, and under its terms, the town&#x27;s corporation was renewed and enlarged. The Fethard corporation was directed to build &quot;a Tholsel (common Hall) for assemblies&quot;; this led to the construction of some almshouses, which developed to become Fethard Town Hall.

During the 17th century, the town was subject to two significant threats. The first was by the army of Murrough O&#x27;Brien, 1st Earl of Inchiquin, and followed his Sacking of Cashel in 1647. When news of the massacre at Cashel reached Fethard, its citizens submitted to Inchiquin. Three years later, in 1650, Oliver Cromwell marched on Fethard on his way to besiege and take Kilkenny. In a letter, Cromwell described Fethard as &quot;having a very good wall with round and square bulwarks, after the old manner of fortification&quot;. Referring to the nearby Augustinian Friary, he wrote that he had stationed troops &quot;in an old abbey in the suburbs&quot;. As with Inchiquin, the citizens of Fethard also agreed to terms of surrender with Cromwell.

By the 18th century, some parts of the town were in a state of decay, with the corporation&#x27;s books for 1718 noting that 56 people had houses with dangerous chimneys. In the same period, the Everard family&#x27;s involvement with Fethard came to an end when the last Baronet, Sir Redmond Everard, 4th Baronet, who lived in France, sold his family&#x27;s properties in Fethard in 1725. The new landowner, Mr Barton (a wine merchant from Bordeaux), replaced the old Everard mansion with a new house, which in turn became a military barracks early in the 19th century.

During the 19th century, the remaining medieval fabric of the town was largely demolished, with all but one of the town&#x27;s gates removed. The west tower of the Augustinian Friary was removed in 1835.

Despite some demolition works, much of the town&#x27;s defensive walls remain, making it one of the &quot;best example[s] of a medieval walled town in Ireland&quot;. In some areas the remaining walls rise to a height of .

==Economy==
According to Tipperary County Council&#x27;s 2017 &quot;Settlement Plan for Fethard&quot;, the economy and employment within the town are &quot;linked deeply with the heritage of the Town, the surrounding agricultural hinterlands and the equine industry&quot;. Heritage tourism marketing for the area focuses on the town&#x27;s medieval defensive walls and the area&#x27;s association with horse-racing and breeding.

== Sport ==
The town is also known in the thoroughbred horse racing industry as the home of Coolmore Stud and of the stables of Michael &quot;Mouse&quot; Morris. McCarthy&#x27;s Hotel was the home of Dick McCarthy, a professional jockey of the early 20th century, who rode &quot;Savernake&quot; in the 1930 Grand National.

Fethard GAA Club plays at Fethard GAA Park, formerly known as the Barrack Field. The club holds 21 senior county Gaelic football titles, more than any other team in the county.

==Transport==
The Thurles-Clonmel bus route, operated by Bernard Kavanagh &amp; Sons/The Shamrock Bus Company, serves Fethard.

The nearest station is Clonmel railway station, approximately 13 kilometres away.

== Culture ==
The Fethard Medieval Festival takes place annually in June. A parade runs through the main street that culminates in Valley Park centred on the River Clashawley, next to the town&#x27;s medieval walls. Activities in the festival include amusements, workshops, craft demonstrations, archery, live music, and food stalls.

Fethard was used as a location for the 2011 film &quot;Stella Days&quot;, based on a book by Michael Doorley about life in Borrisokane during the 1950s.

<text>AIDS is a DOS computer virus which overwrites COM files.

==Description==
AIDS is the first virus known to exploit the MS-DOS &quot;corresponding file&quot; vulnerability. In MS-DOS, if the user enters in the command interpreter, in a directory where both and exist, then will always be executed. Thus, by creating infected COM files, AIDS code will always be executed before the intended EXE file.

When the AIDS virus activates, it displays the following screen (bracketed comments not in original):

In the message above, the word &quot;AIDS&quot; covers about half of the screen. The system is then halted, and must be powered down and rebooted to restart it.

The AIDS virus overwrites the first 13,952 bytes of an infected COM file. Overwritten files must be deleted and replaced with clean copies in order to remove the virus. It is not possible to recover the overwritten portion of the program.

== AIDS II ==
AIDS II is a companion computer virus, which infects COM files. First discovered in April 1990, it appears to be a more elegant revision of AIDS, which also employs the corresponding file technique to execute infected code.

Unlike generic file infectors, AIDS II is the second known virus to use the &quot;corresponding file technique&quot; of infection (after the original AIDS), and the first to use this technique in a way that does not modify the original target EXE file. AIDS II works by first finding an uninfected EXE file in the working directory and then creating a companion COM file with the viral code. The COM files will always be 8,064 bytes in length, with a timestamp corresponding to the time of infection. After creating the new COM file, the virus then plays a loud note, and displays the following message:
:
AIDS II then executes EXE file the user intended to execute without incident. Once that program is exited, control returns to the virus. The note is replayed, with a new message displayed:

Since the EXE file is unchanged, cyclic redundancy checks, such as those present in antivirus software, cannot detect this virus having infected a system. A way to remove AIDS II manually is to check for EXE files with an identically named COM file 8,064 bytes in length. Those COM files can be deleted.

According to Symantec, AIDS II may play a melody and display the following string:

<text>Hospital () is a village in east County Limerick, Ireland. It is also a civil parish in the ancient barony of Smallcounty. The village&#x27;s population was 674 in the 2022 census. The village itself is situated in the townland of Barrysfarm, one of 11 in the civil parish. It lies on the River Mahore, a tributary of the River Camogue.

==Name==

The village acquired its name from the crusading Knights Hospitaller who built the archaeologically significant Hospital Church here before 1215. This church has the remains of three tombs, dating from the 13th and 14th centuries.

An alternative explanation, from the biography of Sir Valentine Browne, Surveyor General of Ireland (who was awarded lands in the area by Queen Elizabeth I of England), is that the village formed part of the parish of Aney in ancient times, and derived its name from a hospital for Knights Templar, founded in 1226 by Geoffry de Marisco, then Lord Justice of Ireland.

==Transport==
The &quot;Old Cork Road&quot; from Limerick to Mitchelstown and Cork (also known today as the R513 road) passes through the village.

==Amenities==
The village&#x27;s secondary school was completed in 2000 and had around 1,000 students in 2018. There is also a primary school which was completed in the summer of 2004. Hospital is also home to one of Limerick&#x27;s &quot;Youthreach&quot; schools.

Hospital had six public houses in 2017, but this had reduced to four by July 2024.

The village shares a Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) club (Hospital-Herbertstown GAA) with the village of Herbertstown. Former Limerick GAA captain Damien Reale is a member of the club. 

Hospital association football team was founded in 1881 by Sir P.J. Butler. Formerly known as Hospital Crusaders, today it is called Kilfrush Crusaders. Other recreational bodies include the local tennis and handball clubs.

Hospital also has an active Family Resource Centre on Knockainey Road.

There is a stone circle nearby at Ballinamona.

The village celebrated the 800th anniversary of its foundation in 2015.

==Development==
In 2006, Limerick County Council published a local area development plan for Hospital which laid out plans and proposals for the future expansion of the village.

<doc id="1034884" wikidata="Q572436" url="?curid=1034884" title="Anthim the Iberian">
<text>Anthim the Iberian (, – &quot;Antimoz Iverieli&quot;; secular name: &quot;Andria&quot;; 1650 — September or October 1716) was a Georgian theologian, scholar, calligrapher, philosopher and one of the greatest ecclesiastic figures of Wallachia, led the printing press of the prince of Wallachia, and was Metropolitan of Bucharest in 1708–1715.

==Early life==

Anthim was born in the Kingdom of Kartli, a Georgian kingdom then known as Iberia in the west. Anthim was taken prisoner by Ottoman troops, and sold in the slave market at Constantinople. He was trained as an artisan, learning wood sculpting, painting, embroidery, and calligraphy. At some point he was ransomed by the Patriarch of Constantinople. He took orders in Istanbul, while living on the compounds of the Patriarchate. Patriarch Dositheos traveled to Iași, taking Anthim with him. A Greek printing office had been established there in 1682.

==In Wallachia==
In 1689 he was asked to settle in Wallachia by Prince Constantin Brâncoveanu, and in 1691 was given charge of the newly founded printing press in Bucharest. In 1693, he published the &quot;Gospels&quot; in Romanian. In 1695, being appointed father superior (egumen) of the Snagov Monastery, and established a printing office at the new location.

Anthim spoke and wrote Greek, Turkish, and Arabic. He soon acquired a thorough knowledge of Romanian, and was instrumental in helping to introduce that language into the local church as its official language. In 1702 he returned to Bucharest.

He became bishop of Râmnic in 1705, and in 1708 Metropolitan of Wallachia.

In 1709 Anthim was a founder of the first Georgian printing press in Tbilisi; he also trained Georgians in the art of printing, and cut the type with which under his pupil Mihai Iștvanovici printed the first Georgian &quot;Gospels&quot; (1710). He also printed a short catechism to assist his priests in giving catechetical instruction. In addition, Anthim published 25 other books in Romanian, as well as Church Slavonic, Greek, and Arabic (usually in bilingual volumes, such as the Greek-Arabic &quot;Missal&quot; of 1702); this meant that he was also the first in Wallachia to use Arabic fonts.

His homiletic work, the &quot;Didache&quot;, was a collection of sermons meant as a sharp critique of contemporary habits and morals; notably, beside Christian sources, Anthim made reference to classical philosophy. Alongside his literary output, the cleric was the builder of the &quot;All-Saints Monastery&quot; in Bucharest, now known as the Antim Monastery in his memory.

==Death==
Anthim&#x27;s overt opposition to Ottoman tutelage over Wallachia made him an adversary of the Phanariote regime. The new Prince Nicholas Mavrocordatos imprisoned him, and subsequently exiled him to Mount Sinai. Anthim was captured by the Ottomans while making the trip, and assassinated somewhere in modern-day Bulgaria (his body would have been discarded in the Maritsa or the Tundzha). It is alleged that his murder was ordered by Mavrocordatos himself.

==Canonisation==

In 1992 Anthim was canonised by the Romanian Orthodox Church having his saint day on September 27. In memory of 300 years of his death, Romanian Orthodox Church declared 2016 as Saint Anthim the Iverian year.

==Legacy==
In the modern day, Anthim represents a symbol of the relations between Georgia and Romania.

A rugby union trophy, the Antim Cup, contested between Romania and Georgia every year, is named after him.

<text>Killiney () is an affluent suburb in the southern coastal part of County Dublin, Ireland. It lies south of Dalkey, east and northeast of Ballybrack and Sallynoggin and north of Shankill. The place grew around the 11th century Killiney Church, and became a popular seaside resort in the 19th century. The area is notable for some famous residents, including two members of U2, and Enya. Killiney is in a civil parish of the same name, in the barony of Rathdown.

==Amenities==
The tiny village centre of Killiney contains a pub, the Druid&#x27;s Chair. To the north is a hotel, Fitzpatrick&#x27;s Castle Hotel since 1971, and beyond that a small shopping centre established in the 1970s, and nearer Ballybrack some further retail facilities. Between the hotel and the café are two churches, one Church of Ireland, and one a secondary Catholic church or chapel, open briefly weekly. A Le Chéile Schools Trust school, Holy Child Killiney, is located near the coast.

Killiney Hill Park was opened in 1887 as Victoria Hill, in honour of Queen Victoria&#x27;s 50 years on the British throne; its lands were once part of the estate of Killiney Castle, now Fitzpatrick&#x27;s Castle Hotel. The park has views of Dublin Bay, Killiney Bay, Bray Head and the mountain of Great Sugar Loaf (506 m), stretching from the Wicklow Mountains right across to Howth Head. The Park&#x27;s topography is steep, and its highest point, at the obelisk, is 170 metres above sea level. Near one entrance are tea rooms around a 19th-century tower.

Other attractions include Killiney Beach and other beach sections to its north, one with a coffee van, Killiney Golf Club, a Martello Tower, and the ruins of Cill Iníon Léinín, the church around which the original village was based. There is parking for the beaches in two locations, one near the DART station, and a public right-of-way runs from Vico Road across a dedicated bridge over the railway and down to a northern stretch of Killiney Strand and Vico Baths.

The coastal areas of Killiney are often compared to the Bay of Naples in Italy. This comparison is reflected in the names of surrounding roads, like Vico, Sorrento, Monte Alverno, San Elmo and Capri. On clear days, the Mourne Mountains of County Down can be seen. Since early 2010, a pod of bottlenose dolphins has been seen occasionally in Killiney Bay.

==History==
The village of Killiney takes its name from the site of the Nuns&#x27; Abbey. Leinin, a local chieftain, and his seven daughters, converted to Christianity, and together they went on to found a monastic community at what is now Marino Avenue West. The family are commemorated in the stained-glass windows of the Church of St Alphonsus and Columba in Ballybrack, just a couple of minutes&#x27; walk away. Although the establishment of the first church dates back to the sixth century, the current roofless ruin at its location dates from the 11th century; this tiny chapel marks the historical centre of Killiney village, and can still be viewed today.

For many centuries, the major part of the district, including Killiney Hill, was the property of the Talbot de Malahide family, some of the original followers from the 1170 Norman invasion. The obelisk on top of Killiney Hill records the famine of 1741 and the relief works made for the poor which include the obelisk and the many walls which cover the top of the hill. By the 19th century, the areas to the north and east of the village were owned by Robert Warren, who developed many of the Victorian residential roads. The Warrens also sold the land required to extend the Dublin and Kingstown Railway to Killiney and ultimately Bray.

Killiney beach was a popular seaside destination for Dubliners, and John Rocque&#x27;s 1757 map shows bath-houses near White Rock, on Killiney Beach. The coastline became even more popular once the railway opened, and the opening of Victoria Park in 1887 and of Vico Road in 1889 appear to have increased this popularity further. Victoria Castle (later renamed Ayesha Castle) was also built in honour of Queen Victoria, marking her accession to the throne. This is currently owned by County Donegal-born singer Enya who renamed it after Manderley, the stately house that featured in the 1938 Daphne du Maurier novel Rebecca.

Killiney remained a near-rural area from 1900 until the late 1940s, despite its proximity to Dublin city. From the early 1960s, the economy began to expand, causing Dublin&#x27;s outer suburbs to extend as far as Killiney.

===20th-century development===
In the first half of the twentieth century, the Electoral Division of North Killiney still consisted of a small village at its centre and a number of suburban roads lined with large houses. A few modest cottages were occupied by working-class locals and bohemian residents such as George Bernard Shaw, whose house, Torca Cottage, is close to the boundary with Dalkey.

South Killiney consisted of farmland, uncultivated hillside and woodland, a few large country houses (Ballinclea House, in particular, owned by the Talbot de Malahide family destroyed by fire in the early 1970s, and Rochestown House, near to the contemporary Killiney Shopping Centre), the convent of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Cluny, and Killiney Golf Club, a nine-hole course founded in 1903.

Killiney&#x27;s population grew substantially in the decades following the Emergency as the urbanisation of Ireland and the suburbanisation of Dublin progressed. The main divisions of the area locals might identify would be Killiney Hill Park (with the hotel and churches), Roche&#x27;s Hill (locally called Mullins&#x27; Hill), Killiney village itself, North Killiney (Cluny Grove, Killiney Road, Ballinclea), and the cluster of roads on the seaward slopes of Killiney Hill - Killiney Hill Road, Marina Road West, Victoria Road, Strathmore Road and Vico Road. Much of the area is developed with two-storey housing, at average densities of 10 to 30 houses per hectare. To the south of Killiney lies the suburban estates of Seafield Court and Bayview, which were constructed in the mid-1980s.

The population, as recorded by the Census of Ireland, peaked in 1996 at approximately 10,800 and has dropped by about 12% since then, as falling average family sizes have outpaced residential construction.

==Transport==

===Bus===
The area is served by the 59 bus route operated by Go-Ahead Ireland (previously Dublin Bus) which runs hourly from Killiney Village to Marine Road, Dún Laoghaire. The journey takes 25 minutes.

An Aircoach service starting at Fitzpatrick&#x27;s Castle Hotel links Killiney with Dublin Airport every hour, 24 hours a day.

===Rail===
Killiney railway station, served by the DART, is located on Station Road.

==Notable people==

Killiney is one of Dublin&#x27;s most exclusive residential areas. Its notable residents include U2 members Bono and the Edge. Former racing driver Eddie Irvine is also occasionally seen in Killiney. Actor Allen Leech was born in Killiney, as was radio presenter Paddy O&#x27;Byrne. Singer Enya lives in Manderley Castle in Killiney. Gardener Alice Lawrenson lived in Killiney in the 1800s.

The 1960s rock band Mellow Candle, originated in Killiney, was formed by students from the Holy Child Convent.

<doc id="1034887" wikidata="Q5165096" url="?curid=1034887" title="Content theory">
<text>Content theory is a subset of motivational theories that try to define what motivates people. Content theories of motivation often describe a system of needs that motivate peoples&#x27; actions. While process theories of motivation attempt to explain how and why our motivations affect our behaviors, content theories of motivation attempt to define what those motives or needs are. Content theory includes the work of David McClelland, Abraham Maslow and other psychologists.

==McGregor&#x27;s Theory X and Theory Y==
Douglas McGregor proposed two different motivational theories. Managers tend to believe one or the other and treat their employees accordingly. Theory X states that employees dislike and try to avoid work, so they must be coerced into doing it. Most workers do not want responsibilities, lack ambition, and value job security more than anything else.

McGregor personally held that the more optimistic theory, Y, was more valid. This theory holds that employees can view work as natural, are creative, can be self-motivated, and appreciate responsibility. This type of thinking is popular now, with people becoming more aware of the productivity of self-empowered work teams.

==ERG theory==
ERG Theory was introduced by Clayton Alderfer as an extension to the famous Maslow&#x27;s Hierarchy of Needs. In this theory, the existence or physiological needs are at the base. These include the needs for things such as food, drink, shelter, and safety. Next come the Relatedness Needs, the need to feel connected to other individuals or a group. These needs are fulfilled by establishing and maintaining relationships.

At the top of the hierarchy are Growth Needs, the needs for personal achievement and self-actualization. If a person is continuously frustrated in trying to satisfy growth needs, relatedness needs will re-emerge. This phenomenon is known as the frustration-regression process.

==Herzberg&#x27;s Motivation-Hygiene theory (Two-factor theory)==
Frederick Herzberg felt that job satisfaction and dissatisfaction do not exist on the same continuum, but on dual scales. In other words, certain things, which Herzberg called hygiene factors, could cause a person to become unhappy with their job. These things, including pay, job security, and physical work environment, could never bring about job satisfaction. Motivating factors, on the other hand, can increase job satisfaction. Giving employees things such as a sense of recognition, responsibility, or achievement can bring satisfaction about.

==Need theory==
David McClelland proposed a context for understanding the needs in people, which holds significance in understanding their motivations and behaviors. It is subdivided into three categories: the Need for Achievement, the Need for Affiliation, and the Need for Power.

The Need for Achievement refers to the notion of getting ahead and succeeding. The Need for Affiliation is the desire to be around people and be well received socially. It also includes the desire for being a member in a group and conformity. The Need for Power is the desire for control over others and over yourself. It confers the need to be able to exercise direction in the world surrounding you, and cause things to happen. Individuals who have high needs for achievement will tend to engage in competitive activities in order to fulfill this desire. Individuals who need to feel affiliated will tend to join clubs, groups and teams to satiate that want. Individuals who have the need for power will seek activities which likewise satisfy this need, such as, running for high positions in organizations and seeking opportunities to exercise that dominance.

This is not to say that one person cannot have needs spanning all three categories. A person may have the need for affiliation at the same time they have the need for power. While this may initially seem contradictory, there are instances where both needs can be fulfilled. Also, timing may connote different strengths of needs at different moments. So, while a person may strongly feel the need to affiliate during times of loneliness, they may at another time feel the strong need for power when instructed to organize an event. Needs may arise and change along with a change of context.

== Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs ==
Content theory of human motivation includes both Abraham Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs and Herzberg&#x27;s two-factor theory. Maslow&#x27;s theory is one of the most widely discussed theories of motivation. Abraham Maslow believed that man is inherently good and argued that individuals possess a constantly growing inner drive that has great potential. The needs hierarchy system is a commonly used scheme for classifying human motives.

The American motivation psychologist Abraham H. Maslow (1954) developed the hierarchy of needs consisting of five hierarchic classes. According to Maslow, people are motivated by unsatisfied needs. The needs, listed from basic (lowest-earliest) to most complex (highest-latest) are as follows:

*Physiology (hunger, thirst, sleep, etc.)
*Safety/Security/Shelter/Health
*Social/Love/Friendship
*Self-esteem/Recognition/Achievement
*Self actualization/achievement of full potential

The basic requirements build upon the first step in the pyramid: physiology. If there are deficits on this level, all behavior will be oriented to satisfy this deficit. Essentially, if you have not slept or eaten adequately, you won&#x27;t be interested in your self-esteem desires. Subsequently, we have the second level, which awakens a need for security. After securing those two levels, the motives shift to the social sphere, the third level. Psychological requirements comprise the fourth level, while the top of the hierarchy consists of self-realization and self-actualization.

Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs theory can be summarized as follows:

* Human beings have wants and desires which, when unsatisfied, may influence behavior.
* Differing levels of importance to human life are reflected in a hierarchical structure of needs.
* Needs at higher levels in the hierarchy are held in abeyance until lower-level needs are at least minimally satisfied.
* Needs at higher levels of the hierarchy are associated with individuality , humanness, and psychological health.

== Sex, Hedonism, and Evolution ==

One of the first influential figures to discuss the topic of hedonism was Socrates, and he did so around 470–399 BCE in ancient Greece. Hedonism, as Socrates described it, is the motivation wherein a person will behave in a manner that will maximize pleasure and minimize pain. The only instance in which a person will behave in a manner that results in more pain than pleasure is when the knowledge of the effects of the behavior is lacking. Sex is one of the pleasures people pursue.

Sex is on the first level of Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs. It is a necessary physiological need like air, warmth, or sleep, and if the body lacks it will not function optimally. Without the orgasm that comes with sex, a person will experience &quot;pain,&quot; and as hedonism would predict, a person will minimize this pain by pursuing sex. That being said, sex as a basic need is different from the need for sexual intimacy, which is located on the third level in Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy.

There are multiple theories for why sex is a strong motivation, and many fall under the theory of evolution. On an evolutionary level, the motivation for sex likely has to do with a species&#x27; ability to reproduce. Species that reproduce more, survive and pass on their genes. Therefore, species have a sexual desire that leads to sexual intercourse as a means to create more offspring. Without this innate motivation, a species may determine that attaining intercourse is too costly in terms of effort, energy, and danger.

In addition to sexual desire, the motivation for romantic love runs parallel in having an evolutionary function for the survival of a species. On an emotional level, romantic love satiates a psychological need for belonging. Therefore, this is another hedonistic pursuit of pleasure. From the evolutionary perspective, romantic love creates bonds with the parents of offspring. This bond will make it so that the parents will stay together and take care of and protect the offspring until it is independent. By rearing the child together, it increases the chances that the offspring will survive and pass on its genes themselves, therefore continuing the survival of the species. Without the romantic love bond, the male will pursue satiation of his sexual desire with as many mates as possible, leaving behind the female to rear the offspring by herself. Child-rearing with one parent is more difficult and provides less assurance of the offspring&#x27;s survival than with two parents. Romantic love therefore solves the commitment problem of parents needing to be together; individuals that are loyal and faithful to one another will have mutual survival benefits.

Additionally, under the umbrella of evolution, is Darwin&#x27;s term sexual selection. This refers to how the female selects the male for reproduction. The male is motivated to attain sex because of all the aforementioned reasons, but how he attains it can vary based on his qualities. For some females, they are motivated by the will to survive mostly, and will prefer a mate that can physically defend her, or financially provide for her (among humans). Some females are more attracted to charm, as it is an indicator of being a good loyal lover that will in turn make for a dependable child-rearing partner. Altogether, sex is a hedonistic pleasure-seeking behavior that satiates physical and psychological needs and is instinctively guided by principles of evolution.

== Self-determination theory ==

Since the early 1970s Deci and Ryan have developed and tested their self-determination theory (SDT). SDT identifies three innate needs that, if satisfied, allow optimal function and growth: competence, relatedness, and autonomy. These three psychological needs are suggested to be essential for psychological health &amp; well-being along with behavioral motivation. There are three essential elements to the theory:

* Humans are inherently proactive with their potential and at mastering their inner forces (such as drive and emotions).
* Humans have an inherent tendency towards growth, development, and integrated functioning.
* Optimal development and actions are inherent in humans but they do not happen automatically.

Within Self-Determination Theory, Deci &amp; Ryan distinguish between four different types of extrinsic motivation, differing in their levels of perceived autonomy:

*External regulation: This is the least autonomous of the four and is determined by external punishment or reward.
*Introjected regulation: This form of external motivation arises when the individuals have somewhat internalized regulations but do not fully accept them as their own. They may comply for self-esteem reasons or social acceptability - essentially internal reasons but externally driven.
*Identified regulation: This is more autonomously driven - when the individuals consciously perceive the actions as valuable.
*Integrated regulation: This is the most autonomous form of motivation and the action has been internalized and is aligned with the individual&#x27;s values, beliefs and is perceived as necessary for their wellbeing. However, this is still classified as extrinsic motivation as it is still driven by external processes and not by inherent enjoyment for the task itself.

== &quot;16 basic desires&quot; theory ==
Starting from studies involving more than 6,000 people, Reiss proposed that 16 basic desires guide nearly all human behavior. In this model the basic desires that motivate our actions and define our personalities are:

==Natural theories==
The natural system assumes that people have higher-order needs, which contrasts with the rational theory that suggests that people dislike work and only respond to rewards and punishment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lecture 10/1&quot;&gt;Dobbin, Frank. &quot;From Incentives to Teamwork: Rational and Natural Management Systems.&quot; Lecture. Harvard University. Cambridge, Massachusetts. 1 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; According to McGregor&#x27;s Theory Y, human behavior is based on satisfying a hierarchy of needs: physiological, safety, social, ego, and self-fulfillment.

Physiological needs are the lowest and the most important level. These fundamental requirements include food, rest, shelter, and exercise. After the physiological needs are satisfied, employees can focus on safety needs, which include &quot;protection against danger, threat and deprivation.&quot; However, if management makes arbitrary or biased employment decisions, then an employee&#x27;s safety needs are unfulfilled.

The next set of needs is social, which refers to the desire for acceptance, affiliation, reciprocal friendships, and love. As such, the natural system of management assumes that close-knit work teams are productive. Accordingly, if an employee&#x27;s social needs are unmet, then he will act disobediently.

There are two types of egoistic needs, the second-highest order of needs. The first type refers to one&#x27;s self-esteem, which encompasses self-confidence, independence, achievement, competence, and knowledge. The second type of needs deals with reputation, status, recognition, and respect from colleagues. Egoistic needs are much more difficult to satisfy.

The highest order of needs is for self-fulfillment, including recognition of one&#x27;s full potential, areas for self-improvement, and the opportunity for creativity. This differs from the rational system, which assumes that people prefer routine and security to creativity. Unlike the rational management system, which assumes that humans don&#x27;t care about these higher-order needs, the natural system is based on these needs as a means for motivation.

The author of the reductionist motivation model is Sigmund Freud. According to the model, physiological needs raise tension, thereby forcing an individual to seek an outlet by satisfying those needs 

===Self-management through teamwork===
To successfully manage and motivate employees, the natural system posits that being a part of a group is necessary. Because of structural changes in the social order, the workplace is more fluid and adaptive according to Mayo. As a result, individual employees have lost their sense of stability and security, which can be provided by being a member of a group. However, if teams continuously change within jobs, then employees feel anxious, empty, and irrational and become harder to work with. The innate desire for lasting human association and management &quot;is not related to single workers, but always to working groups.&quot; In groups, employees will self-manage and form relevant customs, duties, and traditions.

===Wage incentives===
Humans are motivated by additional factors besides wage incentives. Unlike the rational theory of motivation, people are not driven toward economic interests per the natural system. For instance, the straight piecework system pays employees based on each unit of their output. Based on studies such as the Bank Wiring Observation Room, using a piece rate incentive system does not lead to higher production. Employees actually set upper limits on each person&#x27;s daily output. These actions stand &quot;in direct opposition to the ideas underlying their system of financial incentive, which countenanced no upper limit to performance other than the physical capacity of the individual.&quot; Therefore, as opposed to the rational system that depends on economic rewards and punishments, the natural system of management assumes that humans are also motivated by non-economic factors.

===Autonomy: increased motivation for autonomous tasks===
Employees seek autonomy and responsibility in their work, contrary to assumptions of the rational theory of management. Because supervisors have direct authority over employees, they must ensure that the employee&#x27;s actions are in line with the standards of efficient conduct. This creates a sense of restriction on the employee and these constraints are viewed as &quot;annoying and seemingly functioned only as subordinating or differentiating mechanisms.&quot; Accordingly, the natural management system assumes that employees prefer autonomy and responsibility on the job and dislike arbitrary rules and overwhelming supervision. An individual&#x27;s motivation to complete a task is increased when the task is autonomous. When the motivation to complete a task comes from an &quot;external pressure&quot; that pressure then &quot;undermines&quot; the person&#x27;s motivation, and as a result decreases the person&#x27;s desire to complete the task.

==Rational motivations==
The idea that human beings are rational and that the human behavior is guided by reason is an old one. However, recent research (on satisfying for example) has significantly undermined the idea of homo economicus or of perfect rationality in favor of a more bounded rationality. The field of behavioral economics is particularly concerned with the limits of rationality in economic agents.

==Incentive theories: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation==
Motivation can be divided into two different theories known as &quot;intrinsic&quot; (internal or inherent in the activity itself) motivation and &quot;extrinsic&quot; (contingent on external rewards or punishment) motivation.

===Intrinsic motivation===
Intrinsic motivation has been studied since the early 1970s. Intrinsic motivation is a behavior that is driven by satisfying internal rewards. For example, an athlete may enjoy playing football for the experience, rather than for an award. It is an interest or enjoyment in the task itself, and exists within the individual rather than relying on external pressures or a desire for consideration. Deci (1971) explained that some activities provide their own inherent reward, meaning certain activities are not dependent on external rewards. The phenomenon of intrinsic motivation was first acknowledged within experimental studies of animal behavior. In these studies, it was evident that the organisms would engage in playful and curiosity-driven behaviors in the absence of reward. Intrinsic motivation is a natural motivational tendency and is a critical element in cognitive, social, and physical development. The two necessary elements for intrinsic motivation are self-determination and an increase in perceived competence. In short, the cause of the behavior must be internal, known as internal locus of causality, and the individual who engages in the behavior must perceive that the task increases their competence. According to various research reported by Deci&#x27;s published findings in 1971, and 1972, tangible rewards could actually undermine the intrinsic motivation of college students. However, these studies didn&#x27;t just affect college students, Kruglanski, Friedman, and Zeevi (1971) repeated this study and found that symbolic and material rewards can undermine not just high school students, but preschool students as well.

Students who are intrinsically motivated are more likely to engage in the task willingly as well as work to improve their skills, which will increase their capabilities. Students are likely to be intrinsically motivated if they...
* attribute their educational results to factors under their own control, also known as autonomy or locus of control
* believe they have the skills to be effective agents in reaching their desired goals, also known as self-efficacy beliefs
* are interested in mastering a topic, not just in achieving good grades
*don&#x27;t act from pressure, but from interest

An example of intrinsic motivation is when an employee becomes an IT professional because he or she wants to learn about how computer users interact with computer networks. The employee has the intrinsic motivation to gain more knowledge, and will continue to want to learn even in the face of failure. Art for art&#x27;s sake is an example of intrinsic motivation in the domain of art.

Traditionally, researchers thought of motivations to use computer systems to be primarily driven by extrinsic purposes; however, many modern systems have their use driven primarily by intrinsic motivations. Examples of such systems used primarily to fulfill users&#x27; intrinsic motivations, include on-line gaming, virtual worlds, online shopping, learning/education, online dating, digital music repositories, social networking, online pornography, gamified systems, and general gamification. Even traditional management information systems (e.g., ERP, CRM) are being &#x27;gamified&#x27; such that both extrinsic and intrinsic motivations must increasingly be considered. Deci&#x27;s findings didn&#x27;t come without controversy. Articles stretching over the span of 25 years from the perspective of behavioral theory argue that there isn&#x27;t enough evidence to explain intrinsic motivation and this theory would inhibit &quot;scientific progress.&quot; As stated above, we now can see technology such as various forms of computer systems are highly intrinsic.

Not only can intrinsic motivation be used in a personal setting, but it can also be implemented and utilized in a social environment. Instead of attaining mature desires, such as those presented above via the internet which can be attained on one&#x27;s own, intrinsic motivation can be used to assist extrinsic motivation to attain a goal. For example, Eli, a 4-year-old with autism, wants to achieve the goal of playing with a toy train. To get the toy, he must first communicate to his therapist that he wants it. His desire to play is strong enough to be considered intrinsic motivation because it is a natural feeling, and his desire to communicate with his therapist to get the train can be considered extrinsic motivation because the outside object is a reward (see incentive theory). Communicating with the therapist is the first, the slightly more challenging goal that stands in the way of achieving his larger goal of playing with the train. Achieving these goals in attainable pieces is also known as the goal-setting theory. The three elements of goal-setting (STD) are Specific, Time-bound, and Difficult. Specifically, goals should be set in the 90th percentile of difficulty.

Intrinsic motivation comes from one&#x27;s desire to achieve or attain a goal. Pursuing challenges and goals come easier and more enjoyable when one is intrinsically motivated to complete a certain objective because the individual is more interested in learning, rather than achieving the goal. Edward Deci and Richard Ryan&#x27;s theory of intrinsic motivation is essentially examining the conditions that &quot;elicit and sustain&quot; this phenomenon. Deci and Ryan coined the term &quot;cognitive evaluation theory&quot; which concentrates on the needs of competence and autonomy. The CET essentially states that social-contextual events like feedback and reinforcement can cause feelings of competence and therefore increase intrinsic motivation. However, feelings of competence will not increase intrinsic motivation if there is no sense of autonomy. In situations where choices, feelings, and opportunities are present, intrinsic motivation is increased because people feel a greater sense of autonomy. Offering people choices, responding to their feelings, and opportunities for self-direction have been reported to enhance intrinsic motivation via increased autonomy.

An advantage (relative to extrinsic motivation) is that intrinsic motivators can be long-lasting, self-sustaining, and satisfying. For this reason, efforts in education sometimes attempt to modify intrinsic motivation with the goal of promoting future student learning performance, creativity, and learning via long-term modifications in interests. Intrinsic motivation has been found to be hard to modify, and attempts to recruit existing intrinsic motivators require a non-trivially difficult individualized approach, identifying and making relevant the different motivators needed to motivate different students, possibly requiring additional skills and intrinsic motivation from the instructor. In a workplace situation, intrinsic motivation is likely to be rare and risks being falsely identified, as most workers will always be subject to extrinsic motivation such as the fear of unemployment, the need to gain a living and fear of rejection by coworkers in cases of poor performance.

===Extrinsic motivation===

Extrinsic motivation comes from influences outside of the individual. In extrinsic motivation, the harder question to answer is where do people get the motivation to carry out and continue to push with persistence. Usually, extrinsic motivation is used to attain outcomes that a person wouldn&#x27;t get from intrinsic motivation. Common extrinsic motivations are rewards (for example money or grades) for showing the desired behavior, and the threat of punishment following misbehavior. Competition is an extrinsic motivator because it encourages the performer to win and to beat others, not simply to enjoy the intrinsic rewards of the activity. A cheering crowd and the desire to win a trophy are also extrinsic incentives. For example, if an individual plays the sport tennis to receive an award, that would be extrinsic motivation. VS. if the individual plays because he or she enjoys the game, which would be intrinsic motivation.

The most simple distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic motivation is the type of reasons or goals that lead to an action. While intrinsic motivation refers to doing something because it is inherently interesting or enjoyable and satisfying, extrinsic motivation, refers to doing something because it leads to a separable outcome. Extrinsic motivation thus contrasts with intrinsic motivation, which is doing an activity simply for the enjoyment of the activity itself, instead of for its instrumental value.

Social psychological research has indicated that extrinsic rewards can lead to overjustification and a subsequent reduction in intrinsic motivation. In one study demonstrating this effect, children who expected to be (and were) rewarded with a ribbon and a gold star for drawing pictures spent less time playing with the drawing materials in subsequent observations than children who were assigned to an unexpected reward condition. This shows how if an individual expects an award they don&#x27;t care about the outcome. VS. if an individual doesn&#x27;t expect a reward they will care more about the task. However, another study showed that third graders who were rewarded with a book showed more reading behavior in the future, implying that some rewards do not undermine intrinsic motivation. While the provision of extrinsic rewards might reduce the desirability of an activity, the use of extrinsic constraints, such as the threat of punishment, against performing an activity has actually been found to increase one&#x27;s intrinsic interest in that activity. In one study, when children were given mild threats against playing with an attractive toy, it was found that the threat actually served to increase the child&#x27;s interest in the toy, which was previously undesirable to the child in the absence of threat.

Advantages of extrinsic motivators are that they easily promote motivation to work and persist to goal completion. Rewards are tangible and beneficial. A disadvantage for extrinsic motivators relative to internal is that work does not persist long once external rewards are removed. As the task is completed for the reward, the quality of work may need to be monitored, and it has been suggested that extrinsic motivators may diminish in value over time.

== Flow theory ==
Flow theory refers to desirable subjective state a person experiences when completely involved in some challenging activity that matches the individual&#x27;s skills.

Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi described Flow theory as &quot;A state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience is so enjoyable that people will continue to do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it.&quot;

The idea of flow theory was first conceptualized by Csikszentmihalyi. Flow in the context of motivation can be seen as an activity that is not too hard, frustrating or madding, or too easy boring and done too fast. If one has achieved perfect flow, then the activity has reached maximum potential.

Flow is a part of something called positive psychology of the psychology of happiness. Positive psychology looks into what makes a person happy. Flow can be considered as achieving happiness or at the very least positive feelings. A study that was published in the journal &quot;Emotion&quot; looked at flow experienced in college students playing Tetris. The students that were being evaluated on looks then told to wait and play Tetris. There were three categories; Easy, normal, and hard. The students that played Tetris on normal level experienced flow and were less stressed about the evaluation.

Csikszentmihalyi describes 8 characteristics of flow as - the complete concentration on the task, clarity of goals &amp; reward in mind and immediate feedback, transformation of time (speeding up/slowing down of time), the experience is intrinsically rewarding, effortlessness &amp; ease, a balance between challenge and skills, merged actions and awareness, loss of self-conscious rumination and a feeling of control over the task.

The activity no longer becomes something seen as a means to an end and it becomes something an individual wants to do. This can be seen as someone who likes to run for the sheer joy of running and not because they need to do it for exercise or because they want to brag about it. Peak flow can be different for each person. It could take an individual years to reach flow or only moments. If an individual becomes too good at an activity they can become bored. If the challenge becomes too hard then the individual could become discouraged and want to quit.

==Behaviorist theories==

While many theories on motivation have a mentalistic perspective, behaviorists focus only on the observable behavior and the theories founded on experimental evidence. In the view of behaviorism, motivation is understood as a question about what factors cause, prevent, or withhold various behaviors, while the question of, for instance, conscious motivation would be ignored. Where others would speculate about such things as values, drives, or needs, that may not be observed directly, behaviorists are interested in the observable variables that affect the type, intensity, frequency, and duration of the observable behavior. Through the basic research of such scientists as Pavlov, Watson and Skinner, several basic mechanisms that govern behavior have been identified. The most important of these are classical conditioning and operant conditioning.

===Classical and operant conditioning===

In classical (or respondent) conditioning, behavior is understood as responses triggered by certain environmental or physical stimuli. They can be &quot;unconditioned&quot;, such as in-born reflexes, or learned through the pairing of an unconditioned stimulus with a different stimulus, which then becomes a conditioned stimulus. In relation to motivation, classical conditioning might be seen as one explanation as to why an individual performs certain responses and behaviors in certain situations. For instance, a dentist might wonder why a patient does not seem motivated to show up for an appointment, with the explanation being that the patient has associated the dentist (conditioned stimulus) with the pain (unconditioned stimulus) that elicits a fear response (conditioned response), leading to the patient being reluctant to visit the dentist.

In operant conditioning, the type and frequency of behavior are determined mainly by its consequences. If a certain behavior, in the presence of a certain stimulus, is followed by a desirable consequence (a reinforcer), the emitted behavior will increase in frequency in the future, in the presence of the stimulus that preceded the behavior (or a similar one). Conversely, if the behavior is followed by something undesirable (a punisher), the behavior is less likely to occur in the presence of the stimulus. In a similar manner, the removal of a stimulus directly following the behavior might either increase or decrease the frequency of that behavior in the future (negative reinforcement or punishment). For instance, a student that gained praise and a good grade after turning in a paper, might seem more motivated in writing papers in the future (positive reinforcement); if the same student put in a lot of work on a task without getting any praise for it, he or she might seem less motivated to do school work in the future (negative punishment). If a student starts to cause trouble in the class gets punished with something he or she dislikes, such as detention (positive punishment), that behavior would decrease in the future. The student might seem more motivated to behave in class, presumably in order to avoid further detention (negative reinforcement).

The strength of reinforcement or punishment is dependent on schedule and timing. A reinforcer or punisher affects the future frequency of a behavior most strongly if it occurs within seconds of the behavior. A behavior that is reinforced intermittently, at unpredictable intervals, will be more robust and persistent, compared to the ones that are reinforced every time the behavior is performed. For example, if the misbehaving student in the above example was punished a week after the troublesome behavior, that might not affect future behavior.

In addition to these basic principles, environmental stimuli also affect behavior. Behavior is punished or reinforced in the context of whatever stimuli were present just before the behavior was performed, which means that a particular behavior might not be affected in every environmental context, or situation, after it is punished or reinforced in one specific context. A lack of praise for school-related behavior might, for instance, not decrease after-school sports-related behavior that is usually reinforced by praise.

The various mechanisms of operant conditioning may be used to understand the motivation for various behaviors by examining what happens just after the behavior (the consequence), in what context the behavior is performed or not performed (the antecedent), and under what circumstances (motivating operators).

====Incentive motivation====

Incentive theory is a specific theory of motivation, derived partly from behaviorist principles of reinforcement, which concerns an incentive or motive to do something. The most common incentive would be a compensation. Compensation can be tangible or intangible. It helps in motivating the employees in their corporate life, students in academics, and inspire them to do more and more to achieve profitability in every field. Studies show that if the person receives the reward immediately, the effect is greater, and decreases as delay lengthens. Repetitive action-reward combination can cause the action to become a habit

&quot;Reinforcers and reinforcement principles of behavior differ from the hypothetical construct of reward.&quot; A reinforcer is anything that follows an action, with the intention that the action will now occur more frequently. From this perspective, the concept of distinguishing between intrinsic and extrinsic forces is irrelevant.

Incentive theory in psychology treats motivation and behavior of the individual as they are influenced by beliefs, such as engaging in activities that are expected to be profitable. Incentive theory is promoted by behavioral psychologists, such as B.F. Skinner. Incentive theory is especially supported by Skinner in his philosophy of Radical behaviorism, meaning that a person&#x27;s actions always have social ramifications: and if actions are positively received, people are more likely to act in this manner, or if negatively received people are less likely to act in this manner.

Incentive theory distinguishes itself from other motivation theories, such as drive theory, in the direction of the motivation. In incentive theory, stimuli &quot;attract&quot; a person towards them, and push them towards the stimulus. In terms of behaviorism, incentive theory involves positive reinforcement: the reinforcing stimulus has been conditioned to make the person happier. As opposed to in drive theory, which involves negative reinforcement: a stimulus has been associated with the removal of the punishment—the lack of homeostasis in the body. For example, a person has come to know that if they eat when hungry, it will eliminate that negative feeling of hunger, or if they drink when thirsty, it will eliminate that negative feeling of thirst.

===Motivating operations===
Motivating operations, MOs, relate to the field of motivation in that they help improve understanding aspects of behavior that are not covered by operant conditioning. In operant conditioning, the function of the reinforcer is to influence &quot;future behavior&quot;. The presence of a stimulus believed to function as a reinforcer does not according to this terminology explain the current behavior of an organism – only previous instances of reinforcement of that behavior (in the same or similar situations) do. Through the behavior-altering effect of MOs, it is possible to affect the current behavior of an individual, giving another piece of the puzzle of motivation.

Motivating operations are factors that affect learned behavior in a certain context. MOs have two effects: a value-altering effect, which increases or decreases the efficiency of a reinforcer, and a behavior-altering effect, which modifies learned behavior that has previously been punished or reinforced by a particular stimulus.

When a motivating operation causes an increase in the effectiveness of a reinforcer or amplifies a learned behavior in some way (such as increasing frequency, intensity, duration, or speed of the behavior), it functions as an establishing operation, EO. A common example of this would be food deprivation, which functions as an EO in relation to food: the food-deprived organism will perform behaviors previously related to the acquisition of food more intensely, frequently, longer, or faster in the presence of food, and those behaviors would be especially strongly reinforced. For instance, a fast-food worker earning minimal wage, forced to work more than one job to make ends meet, would be highly motivated by a pay raise, because of the current deprivation of money (a conditioned establishing operation). The worker would work hard to try to achieve the raise, and getting the raise would function as an especially strong reinforcer of work behavior.

Conversely, a motivating operation that causes a decrease in the effectiveness of a reinforcer, or diminishes a learned behavior related to the reinforcer, functions as an abolishing operation, AO. Again using the example of food, satiation of food prior to the presentation of a food stimulus would produce a decrease on food-related behaviors, and diminish or completely abolish the reinforcing effect of acquiring and ingesting the food. Consider the board of a large investment bank, concerned with a too small profit margin, deciding to give the CEO a new incentive package in order to motivate him to increase firm profits. If the CEO already has a lot of money, the incentive package might not be a very good way to motivate him, because he would be satiated on the money. Getting even more money wouldn&#x27;t be a strong reinforcer for profit-increasing behavior, and wouldn&#x27;t elicit increased intensity, frequency, or duration of profit-increasing behavior.

===Motivation and psychotherapy===

Motivation lies at the core of many behaviorist approaches to psychological treatment. A person with autism-spectrum the disorder is seen as lacking motivation to perform socially relevant behaviors – social stimuli are not as reinforcing for people with autism compared to other people. Depression is understood as a lack of reinforcement (especially positive reinforcement) leading to the extinction of behavior in the depressed individual. A patient with specific phobia is not motivated to seek out the phobic stimulus because it acts as a punisher, and is over-motivated to avoid it (negative reinforcement). In accordance, therapies have been designed to address these problems, such as EIBI and CBT for major depression and specific phobia.

==Socio-cultural theory==

Sociocultural theory (also known as Social Motivation) emphasizes the impact of activity and actions mediated through social interaction, and within social contexts. Sociocultural theory represents a shift from traditional theories of motivation, which view the individual&#x27;s innate drives or mechanistic operand learning as primary determinants of motivation. Critical elements to socio-cultural theory applied to motivation include, but are not limited to, the role of social interactions and the contributions from culturally-based knowledge and practice. Sociocultural theory extends the social aspects of Cognitive Evaluation Theory, which espouses the important role of positive feedback from others during the action, but requires the individual as the internal locus of causality. Sociocultural theory predicts that motivation has an external locus of causality, and is socially distributed among the social group.

Motivation can develop through an individual&#x27;s involvement within their cultural group. Personal motivation often comes from activities a person believes to be central to the everyday occurrences in their community. An example of socio-cultural theory would be social settings where people work together to solve collective problems. Although individuals will have internalized goals, they will also develop internalized goals of others, as well as new interests and goals collectively with those that they feel socially connected to. Oftentimes, it is believed that all cultural groups are motivated in the same way. However, motivation can come from different child-rearing practices and cultural behaviors that greatly vary between cultural groups.

In some indigenous cultures, collaboration between children and adults in the community and household tasks is seen as very important A child from an indigenous community may spend a great deal of their time alongside family and community members doing different tasks and chores that benefit the community. After having seen the benefits of collaboration and work, and also have the opportunity to be included, the child will be intrinsically motivated to participate in similar tasks. In this example, because the adults in the community do not impose the tasks upon the children, the children therefore feel self-motivated and have a desire to participate and learn through the task. As a result of the community values that surround the child, their source of motivation may vary according to the different communities and their different values.

In more Westernized communities, segregation between adults and children participating in work-related tasks is a common practice. As a result of this, these adolescents demonstrate less internalized motivation to do things within their environment than their parents. However, when the motivation to participate in activities is a prominent belief within the family, the adolescents autonomy is significantly higher. This therefore demonstrates that when collaboration and non-segregative tasks are norms within a child&#x27;s upbringing, their internal motivation to participate in community tasks increases. When given opportunities to work collaboratively with adults on shared tasks during childhood, children will therefore become more intrinsically motivated through adulthood.

Social motivation is tied to one&#x27;s activity in a group. It cannot form from a single mind alone. For example, bowling alone is naught but the dull act of throwing a ball into pins, and so people are much less likely to smile during the activity alone, even upon getting a strike because their satisfaction or dissatisfaction does not need to be communicated, and so it is internalized. However, when with a group, people are more inclined to smile regardless of their results because it acts as a positive communication that is beneficial for pleasurable interaction and teamwork. Thus the act of bowling becomes a social activity as opposed to a dull action because it becomes an exercise in interaction, competition, team building and sportsmanship. It is because of this phenomenon that studies have shown that people are more intrigued in performing mundane activities so long as there is company because it provides the opportunity to interact in one way or another, be it for bonding, amusement, collaboration, or alternative perspectives. Examples of activities that one may not be motivated to do alone but could be done with others for the social benefit are things such as throwing and catching a baseball with a friend, making funny faces with children, building a treehouse, and performing a debate.

==Push and pull==

=== Push ===
Push motivations are those where people push themselves towards their goals or to achieve something, such as the desire for escape, rest &amp; relaxation, prestige, health &amp; fitness, adventure, and social interaction.

However, with push motivation, it&#x27;s also easy to get discouraged when there are obstacles present in the path of achievement. Push motivation acts as a willpower and people&#x27;s willpower is only as strong as the desire behind the willpower.

Additionally, a study has been conducted on social networking and its push and pull effects. One thing that is mentioned is &quot;Regret and dissatisfaction correspond to push factors because regret and dissatisfaction are the negative factors that compel users to leave their current service provider.&quot; So we now know that Push motivations can also be a negative force. In this case, that negative force is regret and dissatisfaction.

=== Pull ===
Pull motivation is the opposite of push. It is a type of motivation that is much stronger. &quot;Some of the factors are those that emerge as a result of the attractiveness of a destination as it is perceived by those with the propensity to travel. They include both tangible resources, such as beaches, recreation facilities, and cultural attractions, and traveler&#x27;s perceptions and expectation, such as novelty, benefit expectation, and marketing image.&quot; Pull motivation can be seen as the desire to achieve a goal so badly that it seems that the goal is pulling us toward it. That is why pull motivation is stronger than push motivation. It is easier to be drawn to something rather than to push yourself for something you desire. 
It can also be an alternative force when compared to negative force. From the same study as previously mentioned, &quot;Regret and dissatisfaction with an existing SNS service provider may trigger a heightened interest toward switching service providers, but such a motive will likely translate into reality in the presence of a good alternative. Therefore, alternative attractiveness can moderate the effects of regret and dissatisfaction with switching intention&quot; And so, pull motivation can be an attracting desire when negative influences come into the picture.

==Self-control==

The self-control aspect of motivation is increasingly considered to be a subset of emotional intelligence; it is suggested that although a person may be classed as highly intelligent (as measured by many traditional intelligence tests), they may remain unmotivated to pursue intellectual endeavors. Vroom&#x27;s &quot;expectancy theory&quot; provides an account of when people may decide to exert self-control in pursuit of a particular goal.

==Drives==

A drive or desire can be described as a deficiency or need that activates behavior that is aimed at a goal or an incentive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drive/Desire&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These drives are thought to originate within the individual and may not require external stimuli to encourage the behavior. Basic drives could be sparked by deficiencies such as hunger, which motivates a person to seek food whereas more subtle drives might be the desire for praise and approval, which motivates a person to behave in a manner pleasing to others.

Another basic drive is the sexual drive which just like food motivates us because it is essential to our survival. The desire for sex is wired deep into the brain of all human beings as glands secrete hormones that travel through the blood to the brain and stimulates the onset of sexual desire. The hormone involved in the initial onset of sexual desire is called Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). The hormonal basis of both men and women&#x27;s sex drives is testosterone. Men naturally have more testosterone than women do and so are more likely than women to think about sex. 

==Drive-reduction theory==
Drive theory grows out of the concept that people have certain biological drives, such as hunger and thirst. As time passes, the strength of the drive increases if it is not satisfied (in this case by eating). Upon satisfying a drive, the drive&#x27;s strength is reduced. Created by Clark Hull and further developed by Kenneth Spence, the theory became well known in the 1940s and 1950s. Many of the motivational theories that arose during the 1950s and 1960s were either based on Hull&#x27;s original theory or were focused on providing alternatives to the drive-reduction theory, including Abraham Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs, which emerged as an alternative to Hull&#x27;s approach.

Drive theory has some intuitive validity. For instance, when preparing food, the drive model appears to be compatible with sensations of rising hunger as the food is prepared, and, after the food has been consumed, a decrease in subjective hunger. There are several problems, however, that leave the validity of drive reduction open for debate.

==Cognitive dissonance theory==

As suggested by Leon Festinger, cognitive dissonance occurs when an individual experiences some degree of discomfort resulting from an inconsistency between two cognitions: their views on the world around them and their own personal feelings and actions. For example, a consumer may seek to reassure themselves regarding a purchase, feeling that another decision may have been preferable. Their feeling that another purchase would have been preferable is inconsistent with their action of purchasing the item. The difference between their feelings and beliefs causes dissonance, so they seek to reassure themselves.

While not a theory of motivation, per se, the theory of cognitive dissonance proposes that people have a motivational drive to reduce dissonance. The cognitive miser perspective makes people want to justify things in a simple way in order to reduce the effort they put into cognition. They do this by changing their attitudes, beliefs, or actions, rather than facing the inconsistencies, because dissonance is a mental strain. Dissonance is also reduced by justifying, blaming, and denying. It is one of the most influential and extensively studied theories in social psychology.

==Temporal motivation theory==

A recent approach in developing a broad, integrative theory of motivation is temporal motivation theory. Introduced in a 2006 &quot;Academy of Management Review&quot; article, it synthesizes into a single formulation, the primary aspects of several other major motivational theories, including Incentive Theory, Drive Theory, Need Theory, Self-Efficacy and Goal Setting. It simplifies the field of motivation and allows findings from one theory to be translated into the terms of another. Another journal article that helped to develop temporal motivation theory, &quot;The Nature of Procrastination&quot;, which received American Psychological Association&#x27;s George A. Miller award for outstanding contribution to general science.

::formula_1

where &quot;Motivation&quot; is the desire for a particular outcome, &quot;Expectancy&quot; or self-efficacy is the probability of success, &quot;Value&quot; is the reward associated with the outcome, &quot;Impulsiveness&quot; is the individual&#x27;s sensitivity to delay and &quot;Delay&quot; is the time to realization.

==Achievement motivation==

Achievement motivation is an integrative perspective based on the premise that performance motivation results from the way broad components of personality are directed towards performance. As a result, it includes a range of dimensions that are relevant to success at work but which are not conventionally regarded as being part of performance motivation. The emphasis on performance seeks to integrate formerly separate approaches as need for achievement with, for example, social motives like dominance. Personality is intimately tied to performance and achievement motivation, including such characteristics as tolerance for risk, fear of failure, and others.

Achievement motivation can be measured by The Achievement Motivation Inventory, which is based on this theory and assesses three factors (in 17 separated scales) relevant to vocational and professional success. This motivation has repeatedly been linked with adaptive motivational patterns, including working hard, a willingness to pick learning tasks with much difficulty, and attributing success to effort.

Achievement motivation was studied intensively by David C. McClelland, John W. Atkinson and their colleagues since the early 1950s. This type of motivation is a drive that is developed from an emotional state. One may feel the drive to achieve by striving for success and avoiding failure. In achievement motivation, one would hope that they excel in what they do and not think much about the failures or the negatives. Their research showed that business managers who were successful demonstrated a high need to achieve no matter the culture.

There are three major characteristics of people who have a great need to achieve according to McClelland&#x27;s research.
# They would prefer a work environment in which they are able to assume responsibility for solving problems.
# They would take a calculated risk and establish moderate, attainable goals.
# They want to hear continuous recognition, as well as feedback, in order for them to know how well they are doing.

==Cognitive theories==
Cognitive theories define motivation in terms of how people think about situations. Cognitive theories of motivation include goal-setting theory and expectancy theory.

===Goal-setting theory===

Goal-setting theory is based on the idea that individuals have a drive to reach a clearly defined end state. Often, this end state is a reward in itself. A goal&#x27;s efficiency is affected by three features: proximity, difficulty, and specificity. One common goal setting methodology incorporates the SMART criteria, in which goals are: specific, measurable, attainable/achievable, relevant, and time-bound. Time management is an important aspect, when regarding time as a contributing factor to goal achievement. Having too much time allows for distraction and procrastination, which also serves as a distraction to the subject by steering their attention away from the original goal. An ideal goal should present a situation where the time between the beginning of the effort and the end state is close. With an overly restricting time restraint, the subject could potentially feel overwhelmed, which could deter the subject from achieving the goal because the amount of time provided is not sufficient or rational. This explains why some children are more motivated to learn how to ride a bike than to master algebra. A goal should be moderate, not too hard, or too easy to complete.

Most people are not optimally motivated, as many want a challenge (which assumes some kind of insecurity of success). At the same time, people want to feel that there is a substantial probability that they will succeed. The goal should be objectively defined and understandable for the individual. Similarly to Maslow&#x27;s Hierarchy of Needs, a larger end goal is easier to achieve if the subject has smaller, more attainable yet still challenging goals to achieve first in order to advance over a period of time. A classic example of a poorly specified goal is trying to motivate oneself to run a marathon when s/he has not had proper training. A smaller, more attainable goal is to first motivate oneself to take the stairs instead of an elevator or to replace a stagnant activity, like watching television, with a mobile one, like spending time walking and eventually working up to a jog.

===Expectancy theory===

Expectancy theory was proposed by Victor H. Vroom in 1964. Expectancy theory explains the behavior process in which an individual selects a behavior option over another, and why/how this decision is made in relation to their goal.

There&#x27;s also an equation for this theory which goes as follows:
::formula_2 or
::formula_3
* M (Motivation) is the amount an individual will be motivated by the condition or environment they placed themselves in, which is based on the following. Hence the equation.
* E (Expectancy) is the person&#x27;s perception that effort will result in performance. In other words, it&#x27;s the person&#x27;s assessment of how well and what kind of effort will relate to better performance.
* I (Instrumentality) is the person&#x27;s perception that performance will be rewarded or punished.
* V (Valence) is the perceived amount of the reward or punishment that will result from the performance.&quot;

== Procrastination ==

Procrastination is the act to voluntarily postponing or delaying an intended course of action despite anticipating that you will be worse off because of that delay. While procrastination was once seen as a harmless habit, recent studies indicate otherwise. In a 1997 study conducted by Dianne Tice and William James Fellow Roy Baumeister at Case Western University, college students were given ratings on an established scale of procrastination and tracked their academic performance, stress, and health throughout the semester. While procrastinators experienced some initial benefit in the form of lower stress levels (presumably by putting off their work at first), they ultimately earned lower grades and reported higher levels of stress and illness.

Procrastination can be seen as a defense mechanism. Because it is less demanding to simply avoid a task instead of dealing with the possibility of failure, procrastinators choose the short-term gratification of delaying a task over the long-term uncertainty of undertaking it. Procrastination can also be a justification for when the user ultimately has no choice but to undertake a task and performs below their standard. For example, a term paper could be seen as a daunting task. If the user puts it off until the night before, they can justify their poor score by telling themselves that they would have done better with more time. This kind of justification is extremely harmful and only helps to perpetuate the cycle of procrastination.

Over the years, scientists have determined that not all procrastination is the same. The first type is chronic procrastinators whom exhibit a combination of qualities from the other, more specialized types of procrastinators. &quot;Arousal&quot; types are usually self-proclaimed &quot;pressure performers&quot; and relish the exhilaration of completing tasks close to the deadline. &quot;Avoider&quot; types procrastinate to avoid the outcome of whatever task they are pushing back - whether it be a potential failure or success. &quot;Avoider&quot; types are usually very self-conscious and care deeply about other people&#x27;s opinions. Lastly, &quot;Decisional&quot; procrastinators avoid making decisions in order to protect themselves from the responsibility that follows the outcome of events.
== Models of behavior change ==

Social-cognitive models of behavior change include the constructs of motivation and volition. Motivation is seen as a process that leads to the forming of behavioral intentions. Volition is seen as a process that leads from intention to actual behavior. In other words, motivation and volition refer to goal setting and goal pursuit, respectively. Both processes require self-regulatory efforts. Several self-regulatory constructs are needed to operate in orchestration to attain goals. An example of such a motivational and volitional construct is perceived self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is supposed to facilitate the forming of behavioral intentions, the development of action plans, and the initiation of action. It can support the translation of intentions into action.

John W. Atkinson, David Birch and their colleagues developed the theory of &quot;Dynamics of Action&quot; to mathematically model change in behavior as a consequence of the interaction of motivation and associated tendencies toward specific actions. The theory posits that change in behavior occurs when the tendency for a new, unexpressed behavior becomes dominant over the tendency currently motivating action. In the theory, the strength of tendencies rises and falls as a consequence of internal and external stimuli (sources of instigation), inhibitory factors, and consummatory in factors such as performing an action. In this theory, there are three causes responsible for behavior and change in behavior:
# Instigation (Ts) – increases tendency when an activity has an intrinsic ability to satisfy;
# Inhibition (Taf) – decreases tendency when there are obstacles to performing an activity; and
# Consummation – decreases a tendency as it is performed.

==Thematic apperception test==

Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) was developed by American psychologists Henry A. Murray and Christina D. Morgan at Harvard during the early 1930s. Their underlying goal was to test and discover the dynamics of personality such as internal conflict, dominant drives, and motives. Testing is derived from asking the individual to tell a story, given 31 pictures that they must choose ten to describe. To complete the assessment, each story created by the test subject must be carefully recorded and monitored to uncover underlying needs and patterns of reactions each subject perceives. After evaluation, two common methods of research, Defense Mechanisms Manual (DMM) and Social Cognition and Object Relations (SCOR), are used to score each test subject on different dimensions of the object and relational identification. From this, the underlying dynamics of each specific personality and specific motives and drives can be determined.

==Attribution theory==

Attribution theory describes individual&#x27;s motivation to formulate explanatory attributions (&quot;reasons&quot;) for events they experience, and how these beliefs affect their emotions and motivations. Attributions are predicted to alter behavior, for instance attributing failure on a test to a lack of study might generate emotions of shame and motivate harder study. Important researchers include Fritz Heider and Bernard Weiner. Weiner&#x27;s theory differentiates intrapersonal and interpersonal perspectives. Intrapersonal includes self-directed thoughts and emotions that are attributed to the self. The interpersonal perspective includes beliefs about the responsibility of others and emotions directed at other people, for instance attributing blame to another individual.

==Approach versus avoidance==

Approach motivation (i.e., incentive salience) can be defined as when a certain behavior or reaction to a situation/environment is rewarded or results in a positive or desirable outcome. In contrast, avoidance motivation (i.e., aversive salience) can be defined as when a certain behavior or reaction to a situation/environment is punished or results in a negative or undesirable outcome. Research suggests that, all else being equal, avoidance motivations tend to be more powerful than approach motivations. Because people expect losses to have more powerful emotional consequences than equal-size gains, they will take more risks to avoid a loss than to achieve a gain.

===Conditioned taste aversion===

Conditioned taste aversion is the only type of conditioning that only needs one exposure. It does not need to be the specific food or drinks that cause the taste. Conditioned taste aversion can also be attributed to extenuating circumstances. An example of this can be eating a rotten apple. Eating the apple and then immediately throwing up. Now it is hard to even be near an apple without feeling sick. Conditioned taste aversion can also come about by the mere associations of two stimuli. Eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, but also having the flu. Eating the sandwich makes one feel nauseous, so one throws up, now one cannot smell peanut butter without feeling queasy. Though eating the sandwich does not cause one to through up, they are still linked.

== Unconscious Motivation ==
In his book &quot;A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis&quot;, Sigmund Freud explained his theory on the conscious-unconscious distinction. To explain this relationship, he used a two-room metaphor. The smaller of the two rooms is filled with a person&#x27;s preconscious, which is the thoughts, emotions, and memories that are available to a person&#x27;s consciousness. This room also houses a person&#x27;s consciousness, which is the part of the preconscious that is the focus at that given time. Connected to the small room is a much larger room that houses a person&#x27;s unconscious. This part of the mind is unavailable to a person&#x27;s consciousness and consists of impulses and repressed thoughts. The door between these two rooms acts as the person&#x27;s mental censor. Its job is to keep anxiety-inducing thoughts and socially unacceptable behaviors or desires out of the preconscious. Freud describes the event of a thought or impulse being denied at the door as repression, one of the many defense mechanisms. This process is supposed to protect the individual from any embarrassment that could come from acting on these impulses or thoughts that exist in the unconscious.

In terms of motivation, Freud argues that unconscious instinctual impulses can still have great influence on behavior even though the person is not aware of the source. When these instincts serve as a motive, the person is only aware of the goal of the motive, and not its actual source. He divides these instincts into sexual instincts, death instincts, and ego or self-preservation instincts. Sexual instincts are those that motivate humans to stay alive and ensure the continuation of mankind. On the other hand, Freud also maintains that humans have an inherent drive for self-destruction, or the death instinct. Similar to the devil and angel that everyone has on their shoulder, the sexual instinct and death instinct are constantly battling each other to both be satisfied. The death instinct can be closely related to Freud&#x27;s other concept, the id, which is our need to experience pleasure immediately, regardless of the consequences. The last type of instinct that contributes to motivation is the ego or self-preservation instinct. This instinct is geared towards assuring that a person feels validated in whatever behavior or thought they have. The mental censor, or door between the unconscious and preconscious, helps satisfy this instinct. For example, one may be sexually attracted to a person, due to their sexual instinct, but the self-preservation instinct prevents them to act on this urge until that person finds that it is socially acceptable to do so. Quite similarly to his psychic theory that deals with the id, ego, and superego, Freud&#x27;s theory of instincts highlights the interdependence of these three instincts. All three instincts serve as checks and balances system to control what instincts are acted on and what behaviors are used to satisfy as many of them at once.

=== Priming ===

Priming is a phenomenon, often used as an experimental technique, whereby a specific stimulus sensitizes the subject to later presentation of a similar stimulus.

&quot;Priming refers to an increased sensitivity to certain stimuli, resulting from prior exposure to related visual or audio messages. When an individual is exposed to the word &quot;cancer,&quot; for example, and then offered the choice to smoke a cigarette, we expect that there is a greater probability that they will choose not to smoke as a result of the earlier exposure.&quot;

Priming can affect motivation, in the way that we can be motived to do things by an outside source.

Priming can be linked with the mere exposure theory. People tend to like things that they have been exposed to before. Mere exposer theory is used by advertising companies to get people to buy their products. An example of this is seeing a picture of the product on a signboard and then buying that product later. If an individual is in a room with two strangers they are more likely to gravitate towards the person that they occasionally pass on the street, than the person that they have never seen before. An example of the use of mere exposure theory can be seen in product placements in movies and TV shows. We see a product that is in our favorite movie, and hence we are more inclined to buy that product when we see it again.

Priming can fit into these categories; Semantic Priming, Visual Priming, Response Priming, Perceptual and Conceptual Priming, Positive and Negative Priming, Associative and Context Priming, and Olfactory Priming. Visual and Semantic priming is the most used in motivation. Most priming is linked with emotion, the stronger the emotion, the stronger the connection between memory and the stimuli.

Priming also has an effect on drug users. In this case, it can be defined as, the reinstatement or increase in drug craving by a small dose of the drug or by stimuli associated with the drug. If a former drug user is in a place where they formerly did drugs, then they are tempted to do that same thing again even if they have been clean for years.

=== Conscious Motivation ===
Freud relied heavily upon the theories of unconscious motivation as explained above, but Allport (a researcher in 1967) looked heavily into the powers of conscious motivation and the effect it can have upon goals set for an individual. This is not to say that unconscious motivation should be ignored with this theory, but instead, it focuses on the thought that if we are aware of our surroundings and our goals, we can then actively and consciously take steps towards them.

He also believed that there are three hierarchical tiers of personality traits that affect this motivation:

# Cardinal traits: Rare, but strongly determines a set behavior and can&#x27;t be changed
# Central traits: Present around certain people, but can be hidden
# Secondary traits: Present in all people, but strongly reliant on context- can be altered as needed and would be the focus of a conscious motivation effort.

== Mental Fatigue ==
Mental fatigue is being tired, exhausted, or not functioning effectively. Not wanting to proceed further with the current mental course of action is in contrast with physical fatigue, because in most cases no physical activity is done. This is best seen in the workplace or schools. A perfect example of mental fatigue is seen in college students just before finals approach. One will notice that students start eating more than they usually do and care less about interactions with friends and classmates. Mental fatigue arises when an individual becomes involved in a complex task but does no physical activity and is still worn out, the reason for this is because the brain uses about 20 percent of the human body&#x27;s metabolic heart rate. The brain consumes about 10.8 calories every hour. Meaning that a typical human adult brain runs on about twelve watts of electricity or a fifth of the power need to power a standard light bulb. These numbers represent an individual&#x27;s brain working on routine tasks, things that are not challenging. One study suggests that after engaging in a complex task, an individual tends to consume about two hundred more calories than if they had been resting or relaxing; however, this appeared to be due to stress, not higher caloric expenditure.

The symptoms of mental fatigue can range from low motivation and loss of concentration to the more severe symptoms of headaches, dizziness, and impaired decision making and judgment. Mental fatigue can affect an individual&#x27;s life by causing a lack of motivation, avoidance of friends and family members, and changes in one&#x27;s mood. To treat mental fatigue, one must figure out what is causing the fatigue. Once the cause of the stress has been identified the individual must determine what they can do about it. Most of the time mental fatigue can be fixed by a simple life change like being more organized or learning to say no. According to the study: Mental fatigue caused by prolonged cognitive load associated with sympathetic hyperactivity, &quot;there is evidence that decreased parasympathetic activity and increased relative sympathetic activity are associated with mental fatigue induced by a prolonged cognitive load in healthy adults.&quot; this means that though no physical activity was done, the sympathetic nervous system was triggered. An individual who is experiencing mental fatigue will not feel relaxed but feel the physical symptoms of stress.

== Learned Industriousness ==
Learned industriousness theory is the theory about an acquired ability to sustain the physical or mental effort. It can also be described as being persistent despite the building up subjective fatigue. This is the ability to push through to the end for a greater or bigger reward. The more significant or more rewarding the incentive, the more the individual is willing to do to get to the end of a task. This is one of the reasons that college students will go on to graduate school. The students may be worn out, but they are willing to go through more school for the reward of getting a higher paying job when they are out of school.

==Reversal Theory==

Reversal theory, first introduced by Dr. Michael Apter and Dr. Ken Smith in the 1970s, is a structural, phenomenological explanation of psychological states and their dynamic interplay. The theory contributes to an understanding of emotions and personality in which endogenous (cognitive) and exogenous (environmental) implications are considered. 

The theory proposes eight meta-motivational states arranged into four pairs that drive and respond to all human experience. When a state is interrupted or satiated, one &quot;reverses&quot; to the other state in the pair (domain). Unlike many theories related to personality, reversal theory proposes that human behavior is better understood by studying dynamic states than by the average of behavior over time trait theory. 

Another distinction of reversal theory is its direct contrast with the Hebbian version of the Yerkes–Dodson law of arousal, which can be found in many forms of psychotherapy. Optimal arousal theory proposes that the most comfortable or desirable arousal level is not too high or too low. Reversal theory proposes in its principle of bistability that any level of arousal or stimulation may be found either desirable or undesirable depending on the meta-motivational state one is in. 

Reversal theory has been academically supported and put to practical use in more than 30 fields (e.g., sports psychology, business, medical care, addiction, and stress) and in over 30 countries.

<text>Cill Chiaráin (anglicized as Kilkieran) is a coastal village in the Connemara area of County Galway in Ireland. The R340 passes through Cill Chiaráin.

Cill Chiaráin lies in a &quot;Gaeltacht&quot; region (Irish-speaking area), and &quot;Coláiste Sheosaimh&quot; hosts Irish language courses within the village.

==Name==
The village is named after Saint Ciarán, &quot;Cill Chiaráin&quot; translates to &quot;Ciarán&#x27;s church&quot; from Irish. It shares its name with a second Cill Chiaráin in County Kilkenny.

==History==
On St Ciarán&#x27;s feast day, there is a Pattern Day in honour of the saint held in the village. Organised by the local festival committee, Coiste Fhéile Chill Chiaráin, there is a Roman Catholic Mass performed at the well which St Ciarán blessed back in the 6th century.

Cill Chiaráin has a number of facilities and public buildings, including a health centre, a &quot;gastropub&quot; (&quot;Tigh Chadhain&quot;), local supermarket, a national school, community hall, church and fish factory.

The Arramara Teo seaweed factory is also nearby. The company was previously Irish owned, but has since been bought by a Canadian company.

The village also has a children&#x27;s playground and the Páirc Peile Chill Chiaráin (artificial pitch) which opened in 2015. The pitch is used by the local GAA team, Carna-Cashel, and the athletics club.
