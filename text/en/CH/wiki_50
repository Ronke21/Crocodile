<text>Aughinish (), also Aughnish, is a small island and townland in Oughtmama Parish of the Barony of Burren in north County Clare, Ireland. It is on the south shore of Galway Bay, northwest of Kinvarra. The island is approximately wide and from the northernmost tip to the southernmost point and has just over fifty inhabitants.

The island was originally connected to County Clare, but that connection was lost due to the tsunami generated by the massive 1755 Lisbon earthquake. The British built the existing causeway to County Galway to service their troops in the Martello Tower. To this day, land access to Aughinish, County Clare is still only through County Galway.

== Archaeology ==
A wealth of monuments of archaeological interest attests of life on Aughinish since pre-historic times:

Shell middens are located north-west and south of the island

A small cyst-like wedge tomb is located on the western side of the island, about 50 meters from its coastline

An early Christian church located on the south western shore of the island has been severely weathered. Only its northern wall subsists in its full length. It has been described as a pre-Romanesque church and was, as early as 2010, mentioned as one of a few Irish churches &quot; in need of urgent and sensitive intervention if they are not to collapse entirely&quot;.

A cillín (unconsecrated burial ground) is situated east of the church

Late medieval seaweed beds, a system used to farm seaweed, used as fertiliser and animal food, are located south of the causeway, and have been described as being &quot;the largest and best preserved of its kind&quot; &quot;of national importance and &quot;extremely vulnerable&quot;.

A Martello tower, located at the most northern point of Aughinish, is one of three Martello towers built on Galway Bay (the others being located in Finavarra and Rosaveal) in 1810, as advised by Major-general George Cathcart, to prevent the bay from being an easy landing point for a French invasion. Contrary to earlier Martello towers built in the Dublin area, these 3 towers are cam shaped.

== In literature ==
Writer and folklorist Lady Gregory whose summer house, Mount Vernon, is facing Aughinish, mentions the island in her book &quot;Visions and beliefs in the West of Ireland : &quot;At Aughinish, there were two couples came to the shore to be married&quot;.

<text>The Minnesota Housing Finance Agency (MHFA), or Minnesota Housing, is a state agency in Minnesota, United States, established to address the growing concerns of affordable housing, homelessness, and housing security in the state. Its primary mission is to provide affordable housing opportunities for Minnesotans who are low and moderate income earners. Created by the Minnesota Legislature, the agency works to stimulate the construction, rehabilitation, and sustainability of affordable homes and rental properties.

== History ==
The MHFA was established in 1971 in response to the increasing need for affordable housing solutions in Minnesota. The agency was set up with the intent to provide safe, decent, and affordable housing, especially for vulnerable populations like the elderly, disabled, and low-income families. It collaborates with local governments, developers, and non-profit organizations to achieve its mission.

Jennifer Ho is the director of MHFA.

== Functions and responsibilities ==
===Financing programs ===
MHFA offers a range of financing programs aimed at making homeownership and renting more accessible. This includes low-interest loans, mortgage assistance, and rent subsidies.

=== Grants and tax credits ===
The agency is responsible for distributing federal and state housing grants and tax credits to eligible parties. This incentivizes developers to create more affordable housing units.

=== Research ===
MHFA conducts research and data analysis to determine housing needs across Minnesota, helping policy-makers make informed decisions regarding housing policies.

=== Education and counseling ===
The agency provides education and counseling services to first-time homebuyers and renters to help them understand their rights and responsibilities.

== Operations ==
MHFA works through partnerships with local banks, mortgage lenders, and housing developers. It receives funding from both federal and state governments and allocates these funds through various programs aimed at increasing affordable housing.

== Impact and accomplishments ==
Since its establishment, MHFA has been instrumental in the construction and rehabilitation of thousands of housing units across Minnesota. It has also provided financing to numerous first-time homeowners, thereby aiding in the economic development of the state.

== Controversies and criticisms ==
While MHFA has been pivotal in increasing affordable housing options in Minnesota, it has also faced criticisms. Concerns have been raised about the adequate distribution of resources and whether the agency&#x27;s work reaches the most vulnerable populations effectively.

== Future directions ==
With the rising challenges of housing insecurity, the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency continues to evolve its strategies to meet the needs of a growing and diversifying population. Technological advances and policy reforms are expected to play a significant role in shaping the agency&#x27;s future endeavors.

<text>Tadeusz Andrzejewski (1923–1961) was a Polish archeologist and Egyptologist.

==Life==
Andrzejewski was born in Łódź. After leaving school, he joined the staff of the Warsaw National Museum in the 1940s, and was appointed to a post in University of Warsaw, 1951.

In 1951 Tadeusz became secretary of the Polish Archaeological Mission in Cairo and 1959 he assisted Kazimierz Michałowski at the excavations at Mirmeki, 1956, then spent four years at Tell Atrib, (1957–1961) in the Nile Delta.

During his last year there he made an independent survey of many of the archaeological sites of the Delta and prepared a report on them; during the reconstruction work carried out by the Polish Archeological Institute at the temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahari he was responsible for the epigraphic work.

The Egyptian Antiquities Service also appointed him to publish the tomb of Ramesses III, all the notes for this being almost completed at his death.

Andrzejewski also took part in the 1959 Polish expedition to Nubia and made the documentation survey of Faras. He published two books in French, 23 articles, a history of Ancient Egypt, a book on Egyptian poetry, a new commentary on Bolesław Prus&#x27; historical novel &quot;Pharaoh&quot;, &quot;Księga Umarłych piastunki Kai&quot;, and many others. Andrzejewski was extremely important in popularizing old Egyptian literature within Poland as well as the organization of the field of Egyptology in Poland.

<text>[[Aachen]] Flugzeugbau was a German aircraft manufacturer of the early 20th century, established around the time of World War I. With the end of the war, the prohibition on powered flight in Germany, the firm began to specialize in sailplane construction, and in 1921 became known as Aachener Segelflugzeugbau, producing designs by Wolfgang Klemperer. It was purchased by Junkers in 1923. In 1923 the K. F. glider-related light airplane (also a Klemperer design) was in production. In 1924 a two-seat low-wing monoplane was also flown.

<text>Ateliers Aéronautiques de Suresnes (AAS) was a French aircraft manufacturer that existed for a short while after World War II. Operating from the Farman Aviation Works factory near Paris, its most notable achievement was completing the two examples of the Heinkel He 274 left unfinished by the Germans.

Later in its history, AAS was combined with other French aeronautical firms into the government-sponsored SNCASO aerospace conglomerate.

<text>Pope Field is a U.S. military facility located northwest of the central business district of Fayetteville, in Spring Lake, Cumberland County, North Carolina, United States. Formerly known as Pope Air Force Base, the facility is now operated by the U.S. Air Force via a memorandum of agreement (MOA) and an interservices support agreement (ISSA) with the U.S. Army as part of Fort Bragg.

==History==
===Origins===
In 1918, Congress established Camp Bragg, an Army field artillery site named for the Confederate General Braxton Bragg. An aviation landing field was added a year later. The War Department officially established &quot;Pope Field&quot; in 1919, and it ranks as one of the oldest installations in the Air Force.

Pope AFB is named after First Lieutenant Harley Halbert Pope who was killed on 7 January 1919, when the Curtiss JN-4 Jenny he was flying crashed into the Cape Fear River. After five years, Camp Bragg became a permanent Army post renamed Fort Bragg, and as Fort Liberty from 2023 to 2025.

Original operations included photographing terrain for mapping, carrying the mail, and spotting for artillery and forest fires. Observation planes and observation balloons occupied Pope Field for the first eight years. In December 1927, Pope Field played a role in the development of tactics that would prove critically important in shortening World War II.

The 1930s saw the first major expansion of the facilities at Pope. In 1935, Pope Field hosted 535 aircraft in one day as the United States Army Air Corps practiced large scale operations along the East Coast. In 1940, paved runways replaced dirt open fields. Much of the parking ramp space remained unpaved until after World War II.

The tempo of activities at Pope quickened with the outbreak of World War II. During the 1940s, the base swelled as a troop carrier training site, and with the institution of paratrooper training at Fort Bragg, Pope began putting the &quot;Air&quot; in &quot;Airborne&quot;. Throughout the war, air and ground crews trained here with Army airborne units in preparation for airborne and aerial resupply missions.

Pope Field became Pope Air Force Base in 1947 and changed back to Pope Field in 2011.

Hangars 4 and 5 and the Pope Air Force Base Historic District were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.

===10th Tactical Reconnaissance Group===
After the war, Pope Field became Pope Air Force Base with the creation of the United States Air Force on 18 September 1947. The base served as the home of the 10th Tactical Reconnaissance Group, being activated at Pope on 3 December 1947 as the 10th Reconnaissance Group. It was redesignated as the 10th Tactical Reconnaissance Group in June 1948. At Pope, the 10th flew the P/F-51 Mustang, as well as its photo recon variant the F-6, later redesignated the RF-51. Operational squadrons were:
*1st Photographic Reconnaissance
*15th Photographic Reconnaissance

===4415th Air Base Group===
The 10th TRG was inactivated on 1 April 1949 and the host unit at Pope was the 4415th Air Base Group. The base primary mission dealt with training Forward Air Controllers for the Korean War This training was conducted by the following operational units:
* 502d Tactical Control Group (27 June 1949 – 27 August 1950)
* 507th Tactical Control Group (2 September 1950 – 1 July 1954)

Headquarters, Ninth Air Force, was located at Pope in August 1950. It was transferred to Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina, on 20 August 1954.

===464th Troop Carrier Wing===
On 21 September 1954, Ninth Air Force turned Pope over to the 464th Troop Carrier Wing, a Tactical Air Command unit, which transferred from Lawson Air Force Base, Georgia. Known operational squadrons of the 464th were:
* 776th Troop Carrier Squadron (transferred to Pacific Air Forces in December 1965)
* 777th Troop Carrier Squadron
* 778th Troop Carrier Squadron
* 779th Troop Carrier Squadron

The 464th (on 1 August 1966 all troop carrier units were redesignated as &quot;tactical airlift&quot;) provided airlift of troops and cargo, participated in joint airborne training with Army forces, and took part in tactical exercises in the United States and overseas. The wing provided aeromedical airlift and flew humanitarian missions as required. Until it was inactivated, the 464th usually had two or more squadrons deployed overseas at any one time, supporting military operations in Central America, Europe, the Middle East, the Far East, and Southeast Asia.

The 464th received the Mackay Trophy for the dramatic RED DRAGON/DRAGON ROUGE and BLACK DRAGON/DRAGON NOIR hostage rescue missions in the Congo in 1964. The wing led the deployment of 82nd Airborne forces to the Dominican Republic, April 1965-September 1966. Beginning in 1966, the 464th was responsible for training C-130E aircrew members for duty in troop carrier units in the United States and overseas.

During its time at Pope, a major period of facility expansion occurred. The main runway, the taxiways, and the ramp were all expanded to support the 464th&#x27;s Fairchild C-119 &quot;Flying Boxcar&quot;s operations. During the 1950s and 1960s, aircraft upgrade was the primary trend at the North Carolina installation. The Fairchild C-123 Provider started replacing the C-119 in 1958, and in 1963, the first C-130 Hercules arrived, appropriately named &quot;The North Carolina&quot;.

===317th Tactical Airlift Wing===

In August 1971, the 464th inactivated and the 317th Tactical Airlift Wing administratively moved to Pope AFB from Lockbourne AFB, Ohio. Known operational squadrons and tail codes of the 317th were:
* 39th Tactical Airlift Squadron (PB – blue tail stripe)
* 40th Tactical Airlift Squadron (PG/PB – green tail stripe)
* 41st Tactical Airlift Squadron (PR/PB – red tail stripe)

The 317th TAW flew the C-130E aircraft. After June 1972, the squadron tail codes were standardized with &quot;PB&quot;, representing (Pope/Bragg).

The drop zones, low-level routes, and dirt landing zones at Fort Bragg became familiar to many men bound for Southeast Asia. The training gained in operating in the North Carolina area immeasurably improved aircrew preparedness for combat duty. The wing was a pioneer in the use of adverse weather aerial delivery system (AWADS) equipment in active combat operations in Southeast Asia, and after the end of American involvement, trained European-based NATO aircrews in those same techniques.

During the Vietnam War, Pope was the destination for the bodies of servicemen killed in Southeast Asia. When identification was confirmed, the bodies were sent to their hometowns or the appropriate military cemeteries for burial.

On 1 December 1974 the Military Airlift Command took responsibility for tactical airlift and assumed command of Pope with all of its assigned units. Under MAC, the two-digit tail code designation of the 317th&#x27;s aircraft was removed.

On 1 January 1992 the 317th TAW was reassigned to Air Mobility Command and the wing was redesignated the 317th Operations Group as part of the new 23d Composite Wing (23d Wing) at Pope. On 1 June 1992 the 317th OG was inactivated. As part of the inactivation, its operational squadrons were dissolved as follows:
* 39th Airlift Squadron – Activated 1 October 1993 with the 7th Wing, Dyess AFB, Texas Replaced at Pope by the 2d Airlift Squadron assigned to the 23d Composite Wing (23d Wing)
* 40th Airlift Squadron – Activated 1 October 1993 with the 7th Wing, Dyess AFB, Texas
* 41st Airlift Squadron – Reassigned to the 23d Composite Wing (23d Wing)

===23rd Wing===
Lessons learned in the Gulf War in 1990–1991 led senior defense planners to conclude that the structure of the military establishment created numerous command and control problems. Senior planners reviewed numerous options before agreeing on the final conclusion – a merger of most strategic and tactical air resources and the transfer of the tactical airlift squadrons out of the Military Airlift Command due to their combat orientation. In addition, the number of Air Force wings was to be reduced by about one-third to reflect the financial constraints of the post Cold War environment.

These changes led to Pope Air Force Base being transferred to the new Air Combat Command upon its activation on 1 June 1992. Also, the 317th TAW was blended into the new 23rd Wing on 1 June 1992 when the 23rd Fighter Wing at England Air Force Base, Louisiana was transferred to Pope after England&#x27;s Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) 1991 closing.

In April 1992, A/OA-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft were transferred to the 75th Fighter Squadron from the 353d FS / 354th FW at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, South Carolina prior to the wing&#x27;s inactivation and the base&#x27;s closure in January 1993. In June 1993, Block 40 F-16C/Ds were transferred to the 74th Fighter Squadron from the 347th FW at Moody and 388th FW at Hill.

Operational squadrons of the 23rd Wing at Pope were:
* 317th Group
** 2d Airlift Squadron (C-130E) (1 June 1992 – 1 April 1997)
** 41st Airlift Squadron (C-130E) (16 July 1993 – 1 April 1997)
* 23rd Group
** 74th Tactical Fighter Squadron (15 June 1993 – 1 April 1997)(F-16C/D 15 June 1993 – 30 June 1996), (A/OA-10A 1 July 1996 – 1 April 1997) Ed Dooley was the first A-10 crew chief DCC for the 74th Fighter Squadron. 
** 75th Tactical Fighter Squadron (1 April 1992 – 1 April 1997) (A/OA-10A)

In December 1992, C-130s from the 2nd Airlift Squadron deployed to Mombasa, Kenya, to participate in Operation PROVIDE RELIEF. The aircraft and crews delivered tons of food and other relief supplies to small airstrips throughout Somalia. 23rd Wing Flying Tiger C-130s were also tasked to assist in other humanitarian relief efforts, to include Hurricane Andrew in Florida. They also airdropped relief supplies into Bosnia-Herzogovina and flew relief missions into Sarajevo for more than 28 months.

On 23 March 1994 two 23rd Wing aircraft, an F-16 and a C-130, collided in the base&#x27;s landing pattern. After the two crewmembers of the F-16 ejected from their damaged fighter, the unmanned aircraft crashed into an aircraft parking ramp and hit a C-141 transport aircraft parked on the ramp. The resulting fireball and flaming wreckage killed 24 United States Army paratroopers who were waiting nearby to load the transports and injured almost 100 more paratroopers in what is known as the Green Ramp disaster.

In May 1994, the deployed 41st Airlift Squadron led the evacuation, known as Operation Tiger Rescue, of U.S. personnel from Yemen.

In September 1994, 23rd Wing Flying Tiger C-130s participated in what was to be the largest combat personnel drop since World War II, Operation UPHOLD DEMOCRACY. They were to assist in dropping more than 3,000 paratroopers from the 82d Airborne Division onto Port au Prince Airport, Haiti. The invasion force was recalled at the last minute after word that the Haitian president had resigned upon hearing that the aircraft were on their way. The 75th Fighter Squadron&#x27;s A-10s were also involved in UPHOLD DEMOCRACY. The squadron deployed their aircraft to Shaw AFB, South Carolina, where they were scheduled to launch close air support operations for the invasion force before recovering in Puerto Rico.

The first operational deployment of a composite wing happened in October 1994, when Iraqi troops began massing near the Kuwaiti Border. Within 72 hours, 56 aircraft and 1,500 people deployed to the Persian Gulf region for Operation VIGILANT WARRIOR. Eventually, the 75th Fighter Squadron redeployed to Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base, Kuwait, becoming the first U.S. fixed-wing aircraft to be stationed in that country since the end of the Gulf War.

On 1 July 1996, the 74th Fighter Squadron&#x27;s F-16C/D Fighting Falcons were transferred to the 27FW / 524th FS at Cannon AFB New Mexico, and the squadron transitioned to A/OA-10 Thunderbolt IIs received from the 20FW / 55th FS at Shaw AFB South Carolina. This gave the 23rd Wing a 2nd A-10 squadron.

The 23rd Wing won its fifth Air Force Outstanding Unit Award for the period of 31 May 1995 through 31 March 1997.

===43d Airlift Wing===
On 1 April 1997, the 23rd Wing was inactivated and the C-130s and Pope Air Force Base were realigned to Air Mobility Command under the 43d Airlift Wing designation. The 43d Airlift Wing was designated as the host installation command.

On the same day, the 23rd Fighter Group was activated at Pope Air Force Base as a tenant unit aligned under the 4th Fighter Wing at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, NC remaining in Air Combat Command. The 74th Fighter Squadron, 75th Fighter Squadron, 23rd Operations Support Squadron, and the 23rd Maintenance Squadron remained part of the group. Several of these planes provided the missing-man formation at the conclusion of the National Anthem at Super Bowl XXXII at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego on 25 January 1998.

The 43d Airlift Wing performed en route operations support at Pope Field to include mission command &amp; control, aircrew management, aircraft maintenance, aircraft loading, aircraft fueling and supply. The wing provided strategic, en-route airlift support and Lockheed C-130 Hercules tactical airlift support to the Army&#x27;s XVIII Airborne Corps and 82nd Airborne Division. The wing traces its roots back to the 43rd Bombardment Group (Heavy), which was constituted 20 November 1940, and activated 15 January 1941, at Langley Field, VA. It operated primarily in the Southwest Pacific Theater as a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, and later a Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy-bomber unit assigned to Fifth Air Force. The 43rd Operations Group carries the lineage and history of its highly decorated World War II predecessor unit.

===440th Airlift Wing===
BRAC 2005 determined that the Air Force Reserve Command&#x27;s 440th Airlift Wing and its C-130 aircraft were to be moved from Mitchell Field, Wisconsin to Pope. The wing started operations at Pope in 2006 and completed the move by October 2007. The first unit assembly at the new location was 1 October 2007. BRAC also made the 440th Airlift Wing the first active associate unit in Air Force history. The Regular Air Force&#x27;s 2d Airlift Squadron and elements of the 43d Airlift Wing&#x27;s maintenance units, that were also based at Pope, were receiving operational direction from the 440th while flying and helping maintain the C-130H2 Hercules Air Force Reserve aircraft. At the start of 2010, the 440th Airlift Wing had 16 C-130H models supporting worldwide missions and providing training missions for the XVIII Airborne Corps and 82nd Airborne Division from Fort Bragg.

The 440th was a United States Air Force Reserve unit that performed airfield operations to include airfield management, weather forecasting, airfield tower control, airfield navigation and landing systems&#x27; maintenance. The 440 AW&#x27;s 95th Airlift Squadron shared the airlift mission with the 43d&#x27;s 2d Airlift Squadron. The 440th also had the 36th Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron assigned which shared the AE mission with the 43d Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron.

Despite opposition from North Carolina congressmen and senators, the 440th Airlift Wing was inactivated as an Air Force cost savings measure. An article in the 6 March 2014 issue of the &quot;Fayetteville Observer&quot; noted that the Air Force has proposed the wing&#x27;s inactivation and the retirement of its 12 C-130H aircraft. A follow-up article in the 11 March edition stated that state congressmen (Ellmers, Hudson, Price, and McIntyre) had spoken out against the proposed inactivation.

The last C-130 assigned to the 440th Airlift Wing departed on 29 June 2016, and the unit inactivated on 18 September 2016.

===Merger with Fort Bragg===
In the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Plan, the Department of Defense started its plan to realign Pope AFB, NC. The Commission called for moving the 23rd Fighter Group&#x27;s 36 A-10 Thunderbolt II (Warthogs) to Moody AFB, Georgia and the 43rd Airlift Wing&#x27;s 25 C-130E&#x27;s to Little Rock AFB, Arkansas; established a Medical Squadron; activated an Air Force Group to provide mission execution, planning, and management of efficient load-out of Fort Bragg assets; and transferred Real Property accountability to the Army. The 2005 BRAC Law directed that the mandates be completed no later than 15 September 2011.

The 23rd Fighter Group rejoined the 23rd Wing in a ceremony held on 18 August 2006 at Pope. On 19 December 2007, the last three of the A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft left for Moody AFB.

On 1 March 2011, Pope Air Force Base was absorbed into Fort Bragg, becoming Pope Field.

===Runway and airfield lighting system replacement===

In 2019, degradation of Pope Field&#x27;s runway and lighting system, many components of which were over 60 years old, became a major concern. From the fall of 2019 through spring of 2021, a major planning effort was undertaken to completely replace the runway and lighting system while continuing operations of units that rely on Pope Field at other locations. The runway was closed on 15 June 2021 to begin the $90 million construction. The project was completed ahead of schedule in approximately four months, opening on 14 October 2021 with the landing of a USAF C-17 Globemaster III crewed by elements of the 437th Airlift Wing (Joint Base Charleston, SC), and the 43d AMOG.

===Inactivation of the 43d Air Base Squadron===

On 8 July 2022, the 43d AMOG held a ceremony where it inactivated the 43d Air Base Squadron and activated both the 43d Force Support Squadron and the 43d Communications Squadron in its place.

==Role and operations==
The United States Army Fort Bragg Garrison is the host organization at Pope Field. The garrison provides airfield support, security, and protection to include emergency medical and fire response, aircraft security, and transient alert support. It also provides installation support and is responsible to execute the Inter-Service Support Agreement in providing support to United States Air Force (USAF) tenants to include services, facility maintenance, and morale, welfare and recreation support.

The United States Air Force 43d Airlift Group was activated at Pope on 1 March 2011, and later redesignated the 43d Air Mobility Operations Group (AMOG) in 2016. The unit performs en route operations support to include mission command and control, aircrew management, aircraft maintenance, aircraft loading, aircraft fueling and supply, air traffic control, and aircraft landing systems maintenance. Furthermore, the 43 AMOG coordinates and supports joint training exercises for Fort Bragg&#x27;s XVIII Airborne Corps and 82nd Airborne Division. Finally, the 43 AMOG is the lead Air Force unit responsible for rapid deployment coordination of the 82nd Airborne Division&#x27;s Immediate Response Force (IRF).

In addition, the USAF 18th Air Support Operations Group, 427th Special Operations Squadron, 21st Special Tactics Squadron, 24th Special Tactics Squadron, and Air Force Combat Control School operate from Pope Field.

<text>A lighter is a type of flat-bottomed barge used to transfer goods and passengers to and from moored ships. Lighters were traditionally unpowered and were moved and steered using long oars called &quot;sweeps&quot; and the motive power of water currents. They were operated by skilled workers called lightermen and were a characteristic sight in London&#x27;s docks until about the 1960s, when technological changes made this form of lightering largely redundant. Unpowered lighters continue to be moved by powered tugs, however, and lighters may also now themselves be powered. The term is also used in the Lighter Aboard Ship (LASH) system.

The name itself is of uncertain origin, but is believed to possibly derive from an old Dutch or German word, &quot;lichten&quot; (to lighten or unload). In Dutch and German, the words &quot;lichter&quot; or &quot;Leichter&quot; are still used for smaller ships that take over goods from larger ships.

Lighters, albeit powered ones, were proposed to be used in 2007 at Port Lincoln and Whyalla in South Australia to load Capesize ships which are too big for the shallower waters close to shore.

== Lighter tug ==
The lighter barge gave rise to the &quot;lighter tug&quot;, a small, manoeuvrable type of harbour tug. Lighter tugs—or simply &quot;lighters&quot;—are designed for towing lighter barges. As such, they are smaller than traditional harbour tugs and lack the power or equipment to handle large ships.

== Operations ==

=== Hong Kong ===
Hong Kong widely uses lighters in midstream operations where lighters transport cargo, mostly containers, between oceangoing vessels or to and from terminals. Lighters in Hong Kong are usually equipped with cranes of 40-60 tonnes capacity, and the largest ones can carry up to 300 TEU containers (empties). Lighters are usually not fitted with engines but are towed or pushed by tugboats. In 2007, midstream operators handled about 2 million TEUs and 5 million TEUs were transported as river trade cargo, which are heavily dependent on lighters.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the UK, some older lighters have been converted into houseboats (for living on the river). As they lack engine rooms and gearbox, shaft or propellers, this means maximum usage of the hull space into housespace. As they have no propulsion methods, they are towed from conversion sites to permanent or semi-permanent mooring sites. They have macerators to deal with toilet waste.

<text>18 is the sixth studio album by American electronica musician, songwriter, and producer Moby. It was released on May 13, 2002, by Mute Records in the UK and on May 14, 2002, by V2 Records in the US. After the unexpected commercial and critical success of his previous album, &quot;Play&quot; (1999), Moby started to write songs for a follow-up during its supporting tour. He started work on the album at its conclusion in December 2000, using fewer samples than before. Guest vocalists include Azure Ray, MC Lyte, Angie Stone, and Sinéad O&#x27;Connor.

Following its release, &quot;18&quot; went to number one in 12 countries, including the UK, and reached number 4 in the US. The album went on to sell over 4 million copies worldwide. &quot;18 B Sides + DVD&quot;, a collection of the album&#x27;s B-sides and live video footage, was released a year later.

==Background==
In December 2000, Moby finished his world tour in support of his previous studio album, &quot;Play&quot; (1999), which had lasted for 21 consecutive months. He wanted to start on a follow-up as soon as it was over, by which time he had already recorded ideas for some new songs. This process was under way in the spring of 2001, with Moby using a Power Macintosh G3 and G4 to write and record with Pro Tools. He felt no pressure in delivering an album that matched the commercial success of &quot;Play&quot;, but an &quot;artistic pressure&quot; to make a record that he and others could enjoy.

Prior to starting on &quot;18&quot;, Moby had friends in New York City, Los Angeles, and London search through local record shops for albums that contained strong vocals that he could use to sample from and write songs based on them, a technique he had used for &quot;Play&quot;. He received several hundred and from them, clipped vocal lines, often two or three words long, that caught his interest. From there, he played different chords on his piano that suited the part to build an outline for a song. He then stored the records in his cabinets. Moby composed the album in batches, transferring songs onto a CD and sending them to his management and the A&amp;R representative at V2 with labels such as &quot;Moby Ideas 2, August 2001&quot; or &quot;Moby Demos 3&quot;. After 10 months Moby had sent 35 discs comprising over 140 songs, which promoted ideas of making &quot;18&quot; a triple album, but his friends and management advised against it. There were arguments between Moby and V2 over the use of vocal samples on &quot;18&quot;, and V2 and Mute believed that a follow-up album that sounded like &quot;Play&quot; was going to attract criticism.

Moby named the album after the number of tracks that he put on it, and his fondness towards the idea of the title being easily translated and known as something different in other countries. He pointed out that there are some &quot;really esoteric reasons&quot; for the title, but did not mention them. On his website, Moby hinted that those who had visited Israel and are familiar with conspiracy theories regarding extraterrestrials may spot its significance. He said that &quot;Play&quot; and &quot;18&quot; were structured around the same motivation: &quot;The desire to make compassionate records that meet a need in someone else&#x27;s life.&quot;

By the time of the September 11 attacks in New York City, the album was almost recorded and finished. Following the incident, Moby made alterations to &quot;Sleep Alone&quot; as he found some of its lyrics &quot;too prescient&quot;; the line &quot;Pieces of fire touch your hair&quot; became &quot;Pieces of light&quot;. Moby had written &quot;Harbour&quot; in 1984, at nineteen years of age; Sinéad O&#x27;Connor was surprised upon learning this, as she initially thought the song related to pre- and post-September 11 events. O&#x27;Connor was too afraid to fly to New York City to record her vocals at the time, so she used a studio in London.

Prior to the album&#x27;s release, V2 Records avoided to send advance copies to soundtrack supervisors. As &quot;Play&quot; had gained momentum after it was licensed to television and film productions, the label did not rule out the possibility of licensing tracks from &quot;18&quot; but wanted to hold out from doing so until the official launch.

==Critical reception==

&quot;18&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100 based on 21 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.
Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album four stars out of five, writing that, &quot;Moby not only creates a shimmering, reflective mood from the outset, but [that] he sustains it throughout the 18 songs, as the album shifts from pop and soul songs to soaring instrumental stretches letting the sound deepen and change colors with each new track.&quot;

<text>Kazimierz Józef Marian Michałowski (14 December 1901, in Tarnopol – 1 January 1981, in Warsaw) was a Polish archaeologist and Egyptologist, art historian, member of the Polish Academy of Sciences, professor ordinarius of the University of Warsaw as well as the founder of the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology. He coined the term &quot;Nubiology&quot; to refer to the study of ancient Nubia.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and the beginning of scientific career ===
Kazimierz Michałowski graduated from a gymnasium in Tarnopol and then studied classical archaeology and art history at the Philosophy Department of the Jan Kazimierz University in Lwów; he also attended philosophy lectures by Professor Kazimierz Twardowski. He broadened his knowledge at universities in Berlin, Heidelberg, Paris, Rome and Athens. As a young scientist he took part in excavations managed by École Française d`Athènes in Delphi, Thasos and Delos. In 1926 he defended his doctoral thesis devoted to Niobids in Greek art, which he prepared at the University of Lwów under the scientific supervision of Edmund Bulanda and which was published a year later in French. In 1931 he won his habilitation based on a dissertation about Hellenistic and Roman portraits from Delos, published next year in Paris. Immediately after habilitation he was delegated to the University of Warsaw, where in 1931 he established a Department of Classical Archaeology, in 1953 transformed into Mediterranean Archaeology Department, which he headed until his retirement in 1972.

In 1936 on his initiative Polish archaeologists from the University of Warsaw started archaeological works in Edfu in Egypt.

=== World War II ===
During the war he was imprisoned in the German prisoner-of-war camp Oflag II-C Woldenburg, where he was sent as a reserve officer and a soldier of the September campaign. In the camp, Michałowski organised educational activities for prisoners, conducted seminars and gave lectures on Egyptology and archaeology. In 1978 he reported that no one who had studied Egyptology in the prisoner of war camp had taken it up post-war as a discipline.

=== Activity after World War II ===
After World War II Michałowski took active part in the reconstruction of Polish culture and science. Since 1939 he had been a deputy director of the National Museum in Warsaw, initially responsible for organisation of the Gallery of Ancient Art opened to the public in 1949, and next for the Faras Gallery, which was opened in 1972. He organised numerous exhibitions displaying historical objects obtained during excavations he headed. In 1945-1947 he was a Dean of the Department of Humanities of the University of Warsaw and later a pro-rector of this same university (1947 – 1948). We was a visiting professor in Alexandria (1957-1958) and Aberdeen (1971). In 1956 he established the Research Centre for Mediterranean Archaeology of the Polish Academy of Sciences, which he headed. In 1960 he organised an opening of the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology of the University of Warsaw with quarters in Cairo, which he headed until his death. He regarded the opening of this facility as his greatest achievement.

He was a member of several national and foreign academies, scientific associations and institutes: Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, British Academy, Deutsche Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin, Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities, Sächsische Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Leipzig; Presidium of the Committee of Ancient Culture Sciences of the Polish Academy of Sciences, Committee of Oriental Studies of the Polish Academy of Sciences, Archaeological Institute of America, Deutsches Archäologisches Institut, Institut d&#x27;Egypte, Polish Archaeological Association (chairperson 1953 – 1957 and honorary member), Society for Nubian Studies (chairperson since 1972), Association Internationale des Égyptologues (deputy chairperson of the Honorary Committee since 1976), Association Internationale d&#x27;Epigraphie Latine (sdeputy chairperson), Warsaw Scientific Society (secretary general 1949–1952), Association Internationale d&#x27;Archéologie Classique, Société Archéologique Grecque, Association of Art Historians; member of École Française d&#x27;Athènes. He chaired Comité International des Experts pour le Sauvetage des Temples d&#x27;Abou Simbel UNESCO (1961-1970), Comité International pour les Musées d&#x27;Archéologie et d&#x27;Histoire ICOM (1965-1971) He was an expert of UNESCO pour les Musées et Fouilles Archéologiques d&#x27;Algérie (1966) as well as a member of Comité des Experts de l&#x27;UNESCO pour Mohendjo-Daro (1969). He was awarded an Honoris Causa Doctorate at the universities of Strasbourg (1965), Cambridge (1971), Uppsala (1977).

=== Popularising activity ===
Kazimierz Michałowski was an active promoter of Mediterranean archaeology. He translated and published W.H. Boulton&#x27;s &quot;The Romance of Archaeology&quot; (1958) as well as publicising the results of excavation works in Edfu. He wrote for &quot;Stolica&quot;, touching on subjects pertaining to ancient artefacts in the holdings of the National Museum in Warsaw. He gave numerous lectures and conducted seminars devoted to antiquity, whose social effect consisted of an impressive increase of interest in this discipline. 5000 students attended his public lecture on the art of ancient Egypt in the National Museum in Warsaw in 1957.

=== Personal life ===
The grandfather of Kazimierz Michałowski was Emil Michałowski, a representative to the Diet of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria and a director of the Teacher&#x27;s University in Tarnopol as well as the mayor of this town. After World War II Michałowski married Krystyna Baniewicz, a daughter of Tadeusz Baniewicz, one of the founders of Podkowa Leśna. Krystyna Michałowska became engaged in her husband&#x27;s activity – in later years the Baniewicz&#x27;s villa in Podkowa Leśna was the seat of the Research Centre for Mediterranean Archeology Polish Academy of Science. Professor Michałowski&#x27;s grave is located in a nearby cemetery in Brwinów.

== Excavations ==
Professor Michałowski conducted excavations in Egypt since the 1930s, and from 1959 on behalf of the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archeology of the University of Warsaw, of which he was the founder and first director.

=== Edfu ===
According to Professor Michałowski &quot;not only in the view of the scientific world but also in a broader opinion of a civilised society, the current cultural level of a given country is judged based on whether it has its own excavations in Egypt&quot;. On his initiative in 1936 archaeological works were started in Edfu and lasted till 1939. The expedition was accompanied by archaeologists from the University of Warsaw and the French Institute for Eastern Archaeology. These were the first excavations with participation of Polish archaeologists in the Mediterranean area. The works were performed on the pharaohs’ necropolis as well as in the ancient city of the Greek-Roman and Byzantian period. The number and artistic quality of historical monuments obtained during the first campaign (1936) enabled the organisation of an exhibition in the Gallery of Ancient Art in the National Museum in Warsaw, which was opened already in June 1937.

=== Myrmekion ===
Polish archaeologists’ participation in the excavations in Edfu turned the interest of the world of science to the Polish scholars and provided an opportunity for commencement of further excavations abroad. Michałowski started collaboration with Soviet archaeologists in Crimea. In July 1956 a group of Polish archaeologists started exploration works in Myrmekion, an ancient Greek colony, which continued till 1958. The works were not performed jointly as in the case of the Polish-French expedition in Edfu. The researchers worked in two separate teams, exploring two sections. The Polish group was headed by Professor Michałowski while the Soviet one – by Professor W.F. Gajdukiewicz from the Leningrad State University. A wine press with complete equipment from the Hellenistic period was discovered as well as fragments of residential buildings. All moveable historical objects discovered by the Polish expedition were transferred to Warsaw upon the consent of the Soviet archaeological office.

=== Tell Atrib ===
Professor Michałowski wanted to continue the works in Egypt after World War II. He was able to resume the exploration of Edfu but the French were banned from excavating in Egypt. Professor Michałowski decided that since the French archaeologists had not returned to Edfu without their Polish colleagues during World War II, he would also not go back there without them. Tell Atrib – &quot;Athribis&quot;, a capital city of the 10th nome of the Lower Egypt, today known as Benha – became a new excavation site. The works were performed from 1957 to 1969. The remains of an ancient water supply system of the Roman city were discovered, as well as remains of sacred buildings of the Late Period, foundations of Ahmose temple, a deposit, furnaces for limestone and Roman baths.

=== Palmyra ===

On 4 May 1959 a group of Polish archaeologists headed by Professor Michałowski started excavation works in Palmyra. The works of Polish archaeologists focused on two sections. The first one was the so-called camp of Diocletian in the western part of the city, where the exploration covered the area between the Praetorian Gate and the Tetrapylon, on the square in front of the so-called Temple of the Standards and inside the temple itself. The city walls were also investigated and a fragment of the Praetorian Road was excavated. On the second section, in the so-called Valley of Tombs, i.e. Palmyrene necropolis, tombs of Zabda, Alaine and Julius Aurelius Hermes were discovered. The excavations enabled determination of the urban development of the city as well as the dating of the revealed buildings based on the epigraphic material they contained. A discovery of a treasure consisting of jewelry and 27 golden solidus coins dating back to the times of Phocas, Heraclius and Constans was a sensational success. So great was the value and significance of the discovered material that since 1966 an annual paper titled &quot;Studia Palmyreńskie&quot; has been published in Warsaw and is still published today. Polish archaeologists became experts in the exploration of ancient Palmyra.

=== Alexandria ===
Excavations on Kom el-Dikka in Alexandria began in 1960. Polish archaeologists comprised the first foreign mission which managed to obtain a permit for exploration of Alexandria. Groups of Italian, English and German scientists worked for the Greek-Roman Museum in Alexandria or they represented it. It is difficult to work on this area since in the 1740s Muhammad Ali mandated that a city be constructed here. The relics of the past remain hidden under a modern development. Monumental Roman baths with numerous swimming pools and cisterns as well as a Roman villa were discovered there. Polish archaeologists revealed also the first theatre to have been discovered in Egypt. This discovery was so sensational that Professor Michałowski received additional funds from the municipal authorities, enabling continuation of works. The ancient theatre was fully revealed and reconstructed. Today it is one of the greatest attractions in Alexandria and is used to stage performances. This is how an ancient building was successfully preserved in a contemporary development. Polish archaeologists explored also two Arabic necropolises on the area of Kom el-Dikka.

=== Deir el-Bahari ===
The works were started in 1961 on the request of the Egyptian minister of culture who was determined to reconstruct the temple of Queen Hatshepsut. In 1968 engineers from the State Studios for Conservation of Cultural Property joined archaeologists to perform construction-restoration works in this temple. When working on this commission Professor Michałowski discovered a previously unknown funerary temple of Thutmose III (already during the first campaign). In consequence most of exploration works were moved to this site. The temple was unique due to its location and layout which differed from other sacral buildings of the New Kingdom period. The works are continued to this day.

=== Faras ===

Faras, ancient &quot;Pachoras,&quot; was a capital city of the Northern Nubian kingdom. In 1961–1964 rescue excavations were performed there, headed by Professor Michałowski. The exploration was part of a larger project, named the Nubian Campaign, managed under the auspices of UNESCO, whose objective was to salvage historical artefacts from flooding by the Nile in connection to the Aswan High Dam development. Ruins of a medieval cathedral church of the bishops of Pachoras were discovered along with religious paintings dating back to the 7th – 13th century. A set of the so-called &quot;frescos from Faras&quot; (actually they are not frescos but paintings executed with tempera paint on dry plaster) comprising more than 150 paintings became one of the greatest and most interesting discoveries of the Nubian Campaign. 67 paintings and fragments of stone decoration from the cathedral as well as other churches and buildings in Faras, epitaphs of local bishops and chaplains and local, artisanal products including pottery are stored in the Faras Gallery in Honour of Professor Kazimierz Michałowski in the National Museum in Warsaw. Remaining historical objects discovered in Faras are contained within the holdings of the National Museum of Sudan in Khartoum.

=== Dongola ===
Professor Michałowski started excavations in Old Dongola in 1964. Since 1966 the works were headed by Stefan Jakobielski. Kings of the joined Nubian kingdoms resided in the Dongola from the 8th to the early 13th century. A central nave of the church with columns preserved &quot;in situ&quot; was discovered already in the first weeks of the works. Scientific writing refers to this discovery as the &quot;church of the columns&quot;. Grave inscriptions found in the church suggested it dated back to the 2nd half of the 8th century. Column capitals revealed in the sacral buildings are stylistically similar to those discovered in the Faras cathedral. Additionally, older foundations of a sacral building were discovered under the &quot;church of the columns&quot;. The second building based on the cruciform plan was also explored as well as a mosque which turned out to be erected on a former royal palace and not (as previously assumed) on a Christian temple. Polish archaeologists discovered also a baptistery. Since 1966 a Polish expedition was performing parallel prehistoric excavations in the vicinity the village of Gaddar.

=== Abu Simbel ===
Professor Michałowski did not excavate in Abu Simbel but along with a team of Polish archaeologists he took part in the salvaging of rock temples of Pharaoh Ramesses II, which were at risk of being flooded with the waters of Lake Nasser. The project involved also archaeologists from other countries such as Italy and France. One of the ideas for salvaging the temples was to move them to a place of safety. Another idea was the leave them in place. UNESCO established a special commission to deal with this issue. The commission consisted of the Director-General of UNESCO, the chairperson of the advisory board and three expert – archaeologists. Professor Michałowski was one of them. They supported a Swedish-Egyptian idea consisting in cutting the temples into large, 30-tonne blocks in order to reconstruct them in a new location. Professor Michałowski was appointed a chairperson of the 7-people international expert committee supervising the relocation of Pharaoh Ramesses II&#x27;s temples. The works lasted 10 years and were crowned with success.

=== Nea Paphos ===
In June 1965 a Polish archaeological expedition headed by Professor Michałowski started excavation works in Nea Paphos in Cyprus. New Paphos was founded at the end of the 4th century BC as a port intended for Greek pilgrims arriving to pay tribute to Aphrodite. Already the first days of works in the south-west part of Paphos led to a discovery of marble sculptures of Asclepius and Artemis worshipped in the city. Coins presenting Alexander the Great were discovered, which confirmed the city foundation date. City development of the Hellinistic period was revealed with well-preserved paintings in the so-called first Pompeian style as well as a proconsul&#x27;s palace with private baths. A mosaic presenting Theseus wrestling Minotaur in a labyrinth was discovered in this building. Ariadne and a woman symbolising Crete are watching the fight. This mosaic is regarded as the most beautiful decoration of this type in the Mediterranean area. Polish excavations proved that Nea Paphos was a political centre of the island. The works initiated by Professor Michałowski are continued by the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw in honour of Professor Kazimierz Michałowski.

== Distinctions, rewards and recognition ==
In 1947 Michałowski was awarded the Commander&#x27;s Cross and the Order of Polonia Restituta for his &quot;merits and contribution into the protection of the Polish cultural masterpieces&quot;. On 21 July 1977 he received the 1st Class Order of the Builders of People&#x27;s Poland. He was also a winner of the 1st and 2nd Degree State Award. In addition he also received the following distinctions: 1st Class Order of the Banner of Work, 5th Class Virtuti Military Cross (for the 1939 campaign), Gold Cross of Merit. He was also awarded in Egypt and Syria as well as in France (Officer&#x27;s Cross and Commander&#x27;s Cross of the National Order of the Legion of Honour), Italy (Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of the Crown of Italy), Greece (Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of the Phoenix), Belgium (Grand Officer&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Leopold).

His name was given to the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology of the University of Warsaw and the Faras Gallery in the National Museum in Warsaw. In 2001 Polish Post issued 200 thousand copies of a postcard dedicated to the 100th anniversary of Professor Michałowski&#x27;s birthday. The postcard presented a nave of the Faras Cathedral and the portrait of Professor Michałowski himself. The bust of Professor Michałowski is exhibited in the gardens of the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities in Cairo and numerous souvenirs related to Professor are stored in the holdings of the Museum of Warsaw University. The Professor&#x27;s name was also given to streets in Częstochowa, Malbork and Słupsk.

In 2015 Public Middle School in Podkowa Leśna was named after Professor Michałowski.

<text>Arethusa bulbosa, commonly called dragon&#x27;s mouth orchid, is the only species in the orchid genus Arethusa. The genus is named after a naiad of Greek mythology. This monotypic genus is abbreviated Aret in trade journals.

This terrestrial and rare orchid occurs in Eastern North America from Manitoba east to Newfoundland and St. Pierre &amp; Miquelon south to Virginia, with isolated populations in northern Saskatchewan and in the Carolinas. It occurs in bogs, swamps and other wet lowlands. It grows to a height of 15 cm. It forms a large, single, pink terminal flower, with a showy lip and white and yellow fringed crests.

<text>William John Watson (17 February 1865 – 9 March 1948) was a Scottish toponymist and was the first scholar to place the study of Scottish place names on a firm linguistic basis.

== Life ==

Watson was a native Gaelic-speaker, born in Milntown of New Tarbat (now known as Milton), Easter Ross. He was the son of Hugh Watson, a blacksmith. He received his initial education from his uncle, James Watson. William became well grounded in Gaelic studies and the Classics. He went to study at the University of Aberdeen and the University of Oxford.

Initially a school teacher in Glasgow, he was appointed Rector of the Royal Academy, Inverness in 1894 and he then obtained the prestigious post as Rector of the Royal High School, Edinburgh, in 1909. It was while teaching in Inverness that he began to contribute to the &quot;Transactions of the Gaelic Society of Inverness&quot; and the &quot;Celtic Review&quot;.

In Edinburgh he lived at 17 Merchiston Avenue.

In 1910 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Walter Biggar Blaikie, Sir William Leslie Mackenzie, John Horne and Ben Peach.

He took the chair of Celtic at the University of Edinburgh in 1914, despite holding no prior university position. He remained in this prestigious position until making way for his son James Carmichael Watson in 1935 (but retaining a role in the university until 1938).

William died on 9 March 1948, aged 83.

== Family ==
He married Ella Carmichael (1880–1928), daughter of Alexander Carmichael.

His son, James Carmichael Watson, was born in 1910. He was declared &quot;missing in action&quot; in 1942, when HMS &quot;Jaguar&quot; was sunk off the coast of Egypt. Presumed drowned, he is memorialised on the Plymouth Naval Memorial.

== Publications ==
He is known for his &quot;The Celtic Place-names of Scotland&quot; (1926), based on 30 years of work. Watson&#x27;s work, eight decades later, is still the primary scholarly reference guide on the subject. The book is based on extensive notes taken by Watson, which are unpublished and held by the University of Edinburgh. Watson&#x27;s great work was recently republished by &quot;Birlinn&quot; (2004).

<text>The Solovetsky Islands (), or Solovki (), are an archipelago located in the Onega Bay of the White Sea, Russia. As an administrative division, the islands are incorporated as Solovetsky District of Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia. Within the framework of municipal divisions, they are incorporated as Solovetskoye Rural Settlement within Primorsky Municipal District. The administrative center of both divisions is the settlement of Solovetsky, located on Bolshoy Solovetsky Island. Almost all of the population of the islands lives in Solovetsky. As of the 2010 Census, the district had a population of 861 inhabitants.

The Solovetsky Monastery (founded in 1436), in 1923 became the site of the first Gulag establishment, the Solovki prison camp.

==Geography==
The archipelago has a total area of and consists of six islands:
* Bolshoy Solovetsky Island, 
* Anzersky Island (Anzer), 
* Bolshaya Muksalma, 
* Malaya Muksalma 
* Bolshoy Zayatsky Island, 
* Maly Zayatsky, 

The islands separate the Onega Bay from the main volume of the White Sea. The closest mainland is the Onega Peninsula.

The shores of the islands are very indented. They are formed of granites and gneiss. The relief of the islands is hilly (the highest point is 107 m). Most of the Solovetsky Islands are covered with Scots Pine and Norway Spruce forests, which are partially swampy. There are numerous lakes, which were joined by monks so as to form a network of canals.

One interesting feature of these islands is stone labyrinths and other stone settings, especially the Stone labyrinths of Bolshoi Zayatsky Island. Such labyrinths were typical for Northern Europe, but most have perished and now Solovetsky Islands have some of the best remaining examples.

==Monastery==
Historically the islands have been the setting of the famous Russian Orthodox Solovetsky Monastery complex. It was founded in the second quarter of the 15th century by two monks from the Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery. By the end of the 16th century, the abbey had emerged as one of the wealthiest landowners and most influential religious centres in Russia.

The existing stronghold and its major churches were erected in stone during the early reign of Ivan the Terrible at the behest of St. Philip of Moscow. At the onset of the Schism of the Russian Church, the monks staunchly stuck to the faith of their fathers and expelled the tsar&#x27;s representatives from the Solovki, precipitating the eight-year-long siege of the islands by the forces of Tsar Alexis.

Throughout the imperial period of Russian history, the monastery was renowned as a strong fortress which repelled foreign attacks during the Livonian War (16th century), Time of Troubles (17th century), the Crimean War (19th century), and the Russian Civil War (20th century).

In 1974, the Solovetsky Islands were designated a historical and architectural museum and a natural reserve of the Soviet Union. In 1992, they were inscribed on the World Heritage List &quot;as an outstanding example of a monastic settlement in the inhospitable environment of northern Europe which admirably illustrates the faith, tenacity, and enterprise of later medieval religious communities&quot;. Today, the Solovki are seen as one of the major tourist magnets in the orbit of the Russian North.

==Labor camp==

After the October Revolution, the islands attained notoriety as the site of the first Soviet prison camp (gulag). The camp was inaugurated in 1921, while Vladimir Lenin was still at the helm of Soviet Russia. It was closed in 1939, on the eve of World War II. By the beginning of the war, there was a naval cadet training camp for the Soviet Northern Fleet.

==Transportation==
The islands are served by the Solovki Airport. There is regular air service to Arkhangelsk, as well as ferry lines (summertime only) to Arkhangelsk, Kem, and Belomorsk.

<text>Anne Lilia Berge Strand (born 21 November 1977), known professionally as Annie, is a Norwegian singer, songwriter, record producer and DJ. She began her recording career in 1999 with the underground hit single &quot;The Greatest Hit&quot; and gained international acclaim, particularly from music bloggers, for her debut album &quot;Anniemal&quot; (2004).

After completing secondary school, Annie started DJing in Bergen, where she met house producer and soon-to-be boyfriend Tore Kroknes. In 1999, Annie and Kroknes released the single &quot;The Greatest Hit&quot;, which sold out in two days and became popular in Norwegian and British nightclubs. Before Annie and Kroknes could release an album, Kroknes died from a congenital heart defect in 2001. Annie went on to sign a record deal with Britain&#x27;s 679 Recordings in 2003, releasing her debut album &quot;Anniemal&quot; in 2004, for which she received widespread critical acclaim and several Norwegian music awards. She released her second studio album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot;, on the Smalltown Supersound label in 2009. Annie lives in Berlin.

Annie has been described as &quot;a pop singer with credibility, an indie artist with one eye on the dancefloor&quot; and as &quot;the Norwegian Kylie&quot;. Annie describes her music as &quot;pop with strange edges&quot;.

== Early life ==
Annie was born in Trondheim, Norway, and was raised in the coastal town of Kristiansand. Annie&#x27;s father, a church organist, died of cancer when Annie was 7. After a series of moves, Annie and her mother, a teacher of English and religion, moved to Norway&#x27;s second largest city Bergen when Annie was 13. By this time, Annie sang in choirs.

At age 16, Annie and a group of friends formed Suitcase, an indie rock band. Suitcase only performed once, before a panel of judges for a music competition where they did not reach the finals. A few years after Suitcase&#x27;s inception, Annie left the band because &quot;the other members wanted to make trip hop.&quot;

Annie attended secondary school until around 1997, when she began to DJ around Bergen, getting acquainted with members of the Bergen music scene. During this time she met producer Mikal Tellé, owner of the Bergen-based Tellé record label, and Norwegian house producer Tore Andreas Kroknes, known professionally as DJ Erot.

== Music career ==

=== 1999–2002: &quot;Greatest Hit&quot; ===
Annie and Kroknes became romantically involved, and began to collaborate musically. Annie&#x27;s talent for writing melodies and vocals worked well with Kroknes&#x27;s production skills. Annie launched her solo singing career in 1999 with the single &quot;Greatest Hit&quot;. The song was recorded after Annie played Madonna&#x27;s song &quot;Everybody&quot; for Kroknes, who was experiencing a creative block at the time. Kroknes sampled the song, and Annie started to sing a melody to it. They recorded and released the song under the &quot;Tellé&quot; label. The song saw a limited release of 500 7-inch singles, which sold out in two days. &quot;Greatest Hit&quot; became an underground club hit in Norway and the United Kingdom, and Annie received offers for record contracts. Annie reflects that she and Kroknes had recorded the song &quot;for fun&quot;, but with the success of the single, Annie says, &quot;I realized that I could actually make a living out of this.&quot;

Annie and Kroknes made plans to release an album and began recording &quot;I Will Get On&quot; in 2000. However, Kroknes, who was born with a degenerative heart condition, fell ill near the end of 2000 and was hospitalized repeatedly. In April 2001, Kroknes died of complications from his heart condition at the age of 23. Annie told &quot;Clubbing Magazine&quot;:
&quot;After that, I was so depressed I just wasn&#x27;t able to do anything. I stayed at home, away from everyone, completely in my own world. I wanted to make the album with Tore—that was the plan. After he died I just didn&#x27;t think I had the heart. But then I thought, &#x27;Right, you&#x27;re really depressed now but you have to make this album. Tore would be quite pissed off if you just stopped doing anything.&#x27;&quot;
After a hiatus from music, Annie returned to DJing and songwriting in late 2001, running a club night called Pop Till You Drop at the Agora nightclub in Bergen with DJ friend Fröken Blytt. Among the music acts booked for Pop Till You Drop were Peaches, DJ Adam Mac, and Finnish DJ Timo Kaukolampi of . Annie later DJed at Kaukolampi&#x27;s own nightclub in Helsinki and lent her vocals to some Op:l Bastards tracks.

=== 2003–2005: &quot;Anniemal&quot; ===
Annie was signed to British label 679 Recordings in March 2003. Annie recorded the track &quot;Kiss Me&quot; with Kaukolampi, and was approached by Richard X to record vocals for the track &quot;Just Friends&quot; on &quot;Richard X Presents His X-Factor Vol. 1&quot;, released in August 2003. In return, he and Hannah Robinson co-wrote &quot;Chewing Gum&quot; and &quot;Me Plus One&quot; for Annie. Annie and Richard X continued to work together, releasing the single &quot;Chewing Gum&quot; in Annie&#x27;s name in September 2004. The track was named single of the week by &quot;NME&quot; soon after its release, and charted in the UK at number 25.

Later that year, Annie released her debut CD &quot;Anniemal&quot;, collaborating with Timo Kaukolampi, Richard X, and fellow Norwegians Röyksopp. The album featured &quot;The Greatest Hit&quot;, &quot;Chewing Gum&quot;, and the album&#x27;s second single &quot;Heartbeat&quot;. The song, produced by Röyksopp, was voted number one on &quot;Pitchfork&quot;&#x27;s Top 50 Singles of 2004 list, before the song was officially released. &quot;Chewing Gum&quot; held the number-eleven spot on that same list. &quot;Heartbeat&quot; was remixed by Canadian electronic duo MSTRKRFT in 2005.

In 2005, Annie won several awards for her work, including Best Pop Album and Best Newcomer at the Norwegian Alarm Awards. &quot;Chewing Gum&quot; had also been nominated for Song of the Year. In addition, Annie won the Best Newcomer award at the prestigious &quot;Spellemannprisen&quot;. Annie&#x27;s 5 February performance at the Alarm Awards was one of the first live performances of her solo career.

Annie toured around the world in 2005 to promote &quot;Anniemal&quot;, including a brief stint opening for Saint Etienne, to whom she had sent a demo tape while still in Suitcase in 1996. Annie performed at sold out club venues in the United States in 2005, and returned to the US later that year.

In 2005, Annie released a DJ mix album as part of !K7&#x27;s DJ-Kicks series. Around this time, she began a record label called &quot;Totally&quot;, with Timo Kaukolampi, and planned to release a 12-inch single with Datarock. She also provided vocals for the Teddybears track &quot;Yours to Keep&quot; as well as the Ercola track &quot;Follow Me&quot;, and re-recorded her songs &quot;Chewing Gum&quot; and &quot;Heartbeat&quot; in Simlish for &quot;The Sims 2: Nightlife&quot; Danish and Norwegian versions.

=== 2006–2010: &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot; ===
In January 2007, Annie signed an international deal with Island Records, owned by Universal Music Group. She had planned to release her second album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot;, in September 2008, preceded by the Richard X-produced single &quot;I Know UR Girlfriend Hates Me&quot;, after she finished touring on the Popjustice Wonky Pop Tour. In November 2008, Annie announced that due to internal problems within the label, she had decided to part ways with Island Records; in interviews following the eventual release of &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot;, Annie explained that her original A&amp;R agent at the label, Nick Gatfield, left to join EMI UK, and Annie left the label because her new agent was not enthusiastic about her work. Although this left her second album&#x27;s future uncertain, she retained legal control over the songs she recorded during her contracted period with the label. &quot;Verdens Gang&quot; suggested that the split with the label was precipitated by the poor chart performance of &quot;I Know UR Girlfriend Hates Me&quot;, which charted at number 54 in the UK. &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot; leaked in its original incarnation in 2008.

After her departure from Island Records, Annie released a new single, &quot;Anthonio&quot;, via producer Richard X&#x27;s Pleasure Masters label in May 2009. The song tells the story of a holiday affair between Annie and the title character; Annie described the song as &quot;the ultimate summer track&quot;.

In August 2009, Pitchfork announced that &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot; would be released via independent label Smalltown Supersound and Annie&#x27;s own label Totally Records. It came out in the UK on 19 October 2009 and in the US on 17 November. &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot; includes collaborations with former collaborators Richard X and Timo Kaukolampi, as well as British producers Xenomania and Paul Epworth. The album&#x27;s release was preceded by two digital singles: &quot;Songs Remind Me of You&quot;, a Richard X production, and &quot;My Love Is Better&quot;, which was produced by Xenomania and features guitar from Alex Kapranos of Franz Ferdinand. The latter initially featured backing vocals by British pop group Girls Aloud, but their record label intervened.

Annie co-wrote Mini Viva&#x27;s debut single &quot;Left My Heart in Tokyo&quot;, released in September 2009 and produced by Xenomania.

=== 2010–2020: &quot;The A&amp;R EP&quot; / &quot;Endless Vacation EP&quot; ===
In October 2010, Xenomania&#x27;s News Blog reported that Annie was back in the studio recording her follow-up to 2009&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot;. Annie started recording in August 2010 with Brian Higgins at Xenomania&#x27;s studios in Kent, England. During 2010, she also contributed vocals to the song &quot;Crazy for You&quot; by New York electro duo Designer Drugs (who remixed her track &quot;Anthonio&quot;) for their debut album &quot;Hardcore/Softcore&quot;, released in February 2011 and to &quot;Alien Summer&quot; by French producer The Toxic Avenger, for their album &quot;Angst&quot; released on 18 May 2011. By the second half of 2011, Annie began working on &quot;The Night Within Us!&quot;, an EP that was slated for an early 2012 release. The Skatebård-produced title track and soon-to-be single &quot;The Night Within&quot;, is the theme song for an homonymous short film by Hildegunn Waerness and part of an interdisciplinary project by Norwegian artist Bjarne Melgaard. The installation and set of paintings, exhibited on the Guido W. Baudach gallery in Berlin from 26 November 2011 to 25 February 2012, are based on the lyrics and theme of the song, which &quot;deal with love and loss&quot;, and capture &quot;the existential need for human tenderness, trust and partnership on one hand, and the painful realisation of lies, deceit and abandonment&quot;, all of which have been somewhat present on Melgaard&#x27;s work. A video has been done for the song, based almost entirely on the exhibition.

Annie released the single &quot;Tubestops and Lonely Hearts&quot; on 26 April 2013. The track is a &quot;song for the dance floor&quot;, and is &quot;inspired by the rave scene in Bergen&quot;.

&quot;The A&amp;R EP&quot; was released on 29 July 2013, and features the single &quot;Back Together&quot;.

On 7 February 2014, Annie released &quot;Russian Kiss&quot;, a song with Bjarne Melgaard and Richard X, which condemns Russia&#x27;s anti-gay laws.

On 20 and 21 August 2014, Annie was a guest member of the jury on &quot;Idol Norway&quot;.

On 16 October 2015, Annie released an EP entitled &quot;Endless Vacation&quot;.

=== 2020–present: &quot;Dark Hearts&quot; and &quot;Neon Nights&quot; ===
On 19 June 2020, Annie announced her third studio album and first new LP in 11 years, &quot;Dark Hearts&quot;. Describing the ambiance of the album, Annie said the LP is &quot;the soundtrack to a film that doesn&#x27;t exist.&quot; The first single from the album, &quot;American Cars&quot;, was released on the same day. &quot;Dark Hearts&quot;, produced by Stefan Storm of the Swedish synth-pop duo the Sound of Arrows, was self-released through Annie&#x27;s Anniemelody label on 16 October 2020. The second single from the album, &quot;The Bomb&quot;, was released on 17 July 2020.

In July 2021, Annie announced the release of the EP &quot;Neon Nights&quot; featuring the already released titled track and a cover of the Jesus and Mary Chain&#x27;s song &quot;Just Like Honey&quot;.

In 2023, Annie worked with Alan Braxe to release a joint single, “Never Coming Back&quot;, which was included on the 2023 reissue of his compilation album, The Upper Cuts. Braxe and Annie last collaborated on a 2005 remix of “Heartbeat” that appeared on the UK CD Single #1 and US CD maxi single, alongside other formats.

On 29 August 2024, Annie released her first trance-influenced single, &quot;The Sky is Blue&quot;. The B-side to the 12&quot; Picture Disc vinyl release includes the song in Annie&#x27;s native Norwegian &quot;Himmelen er Blå&quot; and &quot;The Sky is Blue (Extended Club Mix)&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Annie lives in Berlin, where she moved after being evicted from the apartment in Bergen she was living in because it was going to be turned into a hotel. She owned a cat named Joey, whom she named after both Joey Ramone and Joey McIntyre of New Kids on the Block. Joey died on 29 January 2010. Annie is an avid reader and follows global politics. She is friends with musician Peaches. Her musical influences include Madonna, Saint Etienne, the Pet Shop Boys, and Kate Bush. She has a green belt in karate.

<doc id="1024940" wikidata="Q236014" url="?curid=1024940" title="Cuba national football team">
<text>The Cuba national football team () represents Cuba in men&#x27;s international football, and is controlled by the Football Association of Cuba. Nicknamed Leones del Caribe (&quot;Lions of Caribbean&quot;), the team represents all three FIFA, Caribbean Football Union and Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF).

They were the first Caribbean team to get to the World Cup Quarter finals – they did so in 1938. There, in the round of 16, they defeated Romania in a replay, 2–1, after drawing against them 3–3. They were then eliminated in the quarter-finals by Sweden, 8–0. Cuba has not returned to the World Cup since.

Cuba finished second in the North American Nations Cup in 1947, which they hosted the tournament, second also in Caribbean Cup in 1996, 1999, and 2005, but won in 2012.

==History==

===Early history===
Cuba played its first international football match on 16 March 1930 at that year&#x27;s Central American and Caribbean Games. They beat Jamaica (then a British colony) 3–1 in Havana. Four days later, they beat Honduras 7–0. Cuba were managed by José Tapia, who remained in charge until after Cuba&#x27;s 1938 World Cup campaign.

Cuba&#x27;s first World Cup qualification campaign was for the 1934 World Cup in Italy. All of the CONCACAF entrants were placed in Group 11. The winner of a best-of-three tournament between the two weakest nations, Cuba and Haiti would produce a winner to play 1930 qualifiers Mexico in another round of best-of-three. The winner of that would play 1930 semi-finalists the United States of America for a place in the finals. All of the matches between Cuba and Haiti in the first round were staged at Parc Leconte in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on 28, 1 and 4 January–February 1934. Cuba won the first match 3–1 with Mario Lopez opening from a penalty and Hector Socorro scoring the second. The second match was a 1–1 draw with Lopez equalising in the 85th minute. In the final match, Cuba won 6–0 with two Lopez goals, one from Hector Socorro and one from his brother Francisco.

The second round against Mexico consisted of three matches at Parque Necaxa in Mexico City. Its first match, on 4 March 1934, saw Mexico go 3–0 up with a hat-trick by Dionisio Mejia, his goals scored in the 12th, 14th and 16th minutes. Mario Lopez scored twice for Cuba with one in each half, but Mexico won 3–2. A week later, Mejia scored another hat-trick as Mexico won 5–0, and seven days later, Mexico won 4–1 after Lopez opened the scoring in the 15th minute. Mexico did not qualify, their 4–2 play-off defeat to the United States was held in Rome during the finals, as the two teams had forgotten to stage it earlier.

===1938–2000===
The decision to stage the 1938 World Cup in France was poorly received in the Americas, who had hoped for it to return to South America after the 1934 World Cup in Italy. All nations in South America except Brazil withdrew, and all CONCACAF nations except Cuba, thus the two qualified by default.

The tournament was held as a straight knock-out tournament of 16 nations. Cuba were drawn to play their first-ever World Cup finals match against Romania (who were making their third finals appearance) at Stade du T.O.E.C. in Toulouse, on 5 June 1938. Silviu Bindea put Romania ahead after 35 minutes and Hector Socorro equalised nine minutes later. With three minutes remaining, Tomás Fernández gave Cuba the lead, but within a minute Iuliu Baratky forced extra time with a Romanian equaliser. Romania went 3–2 up in extra-time by Ștefan Dobay&#x27;s goal on 105 minutes, but Juan Tuñas equalised for Cuba with three minutes of extra-time remaining.

The replay was held at the same stadium, on 9 June. This was at the same time as Switzerland&#x27;s 4–2 replay win over Germany. Dobay put Romania 1–0 up at half-time with a 35th-minute goal, but in the second half Cuba equalised through Socorro in the 51st minute. Six minutes later, Carlos Oliviera scored the winning goal and it ended 2–1.
In the quarter-final, Cuba lost 8–0 to Sweden at Stade du Fort Carre in Antibes, on 12 June. Sweden&#x27;s Tore Keller and Gustav Wetterström each scored hat-tricks.

The NAFC Championship 1949 served as CONCACAF&#x27;s qualification group for the 1950 World Cup in Brazil. Cuba, the United States of America and Mexico played each other twice in a tournament held in Mexico City in September 1949. The top two would qualify. Cuba came third and did not qualify, their only point was gained from their second match, a 1–1 draw against the United States on 14 September. Cuba did not compete in World Cup qualification again until 1966, already under Castro&#x27;s regime. They returned to participation in qualification for 1978, but the 1982 qualifiers represented a significant breakthrough- Cuba reached the final round of qualifying, and were only two points short of reaching the 1982 World Cup. In recent years, Cuban football has seen an improvement in results.

===2000–present===
They reached the quarter-finals of the 2003 Gold Cup (where they were beaten by the United States) by defeating Canada 2–0 in the Group stage. During the 2006 World Cup qualifiers, Cuba faced Costa Rica and were only eliminated on away goals. They held Costa Rica to a draw in Havana 2–2 and later battled it out for a 1–1 draw in Costa Rica.

During the 2010 World Cup qualifiers, Cuba faced Antigua and Barbuda and the match ended in a 3–3 draw. Later in Pedro Marreo, Cuba won 4–1 to advance to the semi-final round of the CONCACAF World Cup qualifiers. Cuba was with the United States, Trinidad and Tobago and Guatemala. Cuba finished in the fourth place with only one victory against Guatemala 2–1 with a goal scored by Aliannis Urgellés.
They finished in third place in the 2010 Caribbean Cup to take a place in the 2011 Gold Cup. In 2012, Cuba won the Caribbean Cup for the first time.

For the 2014 World Cup, the Cuban team qualified directly to the Third round as one of the six highest ranked teams and were placed in Group C with Honduras, Panama, and Canada. Although the Cuban team had several close games, they ended their qualification process with one draw and five defeats (losing home and away to Canada and Honduras and drawing to Panama in Havana in their final game after losing in Panama City). Their only goal of the qualifying campaign came from Alberto Gomes against Panama in the final game of the group stage.

==Defection and economic migration by Cuban athletes==
As well as Cuban athletes in other sports, a number of football players have made the move to the United States in recent years. During the 2002 Gold Cup in Los Angeles, two Cuban players Rey Ángel Martínez and Alberto Delgado chose to remain in the United States. Striker Maykel Galindo did so during the 2005 Gold Cup. Two more, Osvaldo Alonso and Lester More did so during the 2007 Gold Cup.

In 2008, defections occurred during two separate tournaments held in the United States. In March, seven players from the U-23 national football, including Yeniel Bermúdez, Yordany Álvarez and Yendry Díaz defected during the 2008 CONCACAF Olympic Qualifying tournament while the team was based in Tampa, FL. In October, two days before the country&#x27;s World Cup Qualifier versus the US, Reynier Alcántara and Pedro Faife walked away from the team&#x27;s hotel near Washington, D.C.

During the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup, Yosniel Mesa defected while the team was in Charlotte, North Carolina. During the 2015 Gold Cup, forward Keiler García defected to the United States before the team&#x27;s first match against Mexico in Chicago. In September 2019, five players (Yordan Santa Cruz, Andy Baquero, David Urgelles, Orlendis Benítez and Alejandro Portal) defected to Canada during the 2019–20 CONCACAF Nations League before and after a match against Canada.

During the 2023 CONCACAF Gold Cup, four players (Roberney Caballero, Denilson Milanés, Neisser Sandó and Jassael Herrera) defected while the team was preparing to travel from Miami to Houston for their last two group stage matches. Another player, Sandy Sánchez, also defected after the last group stage game against Canada, with a member of the medical staff reportedly following suit.

<text>Ruslan Sultanovich Aushev (born 29 October 1954) is a Russian Ingush former politician. He was the President of Ingushetia from March 1993 to December 2001. He was reportedly the youngest officer in the Soviet Army to reach the rank of lieutenant general. He was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 7 May 1982 for his actions in Afghanistan. Aushev has emerged as Ingushetia&#x27;s most popular politician, having kept peace and stability during the First Chechen War.

== Early life ==
Aushev was born on 29 October 1954 to an Ingush family living in Kazakhstan, who were deported from the Russian SFSR in 1944. Very little is known about Aushev&#x27;s early life.

== Military service ==
Aushev entered the Soviet military in 1971 and graduated from the Ordzhonikidze Higher Combined-Arms Command School in 1975, after which he served in the North Caucasus Military District, where he rose to the position of chief of staff of a motorized rifle battalion before he was deployed to Afghanistan in 1980. There he commanded a motorized rifle battalion of the 180th Motorized Rifle Regiment as part of a limited contingent of Soviet troops in the country. After successfully leading his battalion through a dangerous engagement with rebels who tried to ambush them, he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin on 7 May 1982. After his first deployment to Afghanistan he attended the M. V. Frunze Military Academy which he graduated from 1985 before he returned to Afghanistan as a Major. On 16 October 1986 he suffered serious injuries in the Salang Pass, but eventually returned to service. From 1989 to 1991 he studied at the Military Academy of the General Staff and graduated with honors. He was promoted to the rank of Major General in 1991 and to the rank of Lieutenant General in 1997.

== Political career ==
Later he ascended to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, where he remained for two years while serving on the Military Affairs Committee. In November 1992 Aushev was appointed to lead the provisional administration in Ingushetia, a position he resigned two months later to run in the Ingushetian presidential elections. Being the sole candidate, he won the presidency on 28 February 1993 with 99.99% of the vote, and he was re-elected five years later.

During the First Chechen War as many as 200,000 refugees from Chechnya and neighboring North Ossetia strained Ingushetia&#x27;s already weak economy and on several occasions, Aushev protested incursions by Russian soldiers, and even threatened to sue the Russian Ministry of Defence for damages inflicted. President Aushev said that his people could not forget how the same Russian armored columns &quot;and the same Defense Minister&quot; (Pavel Grachev) assisted in the destruction of Ingush settlements and the expulsion of Ingush population during the 1992 ethnic conflict in North Ossetia.

He resigned in December 2001 and on 23 May 2002, Murat Zyazikov was elected president of Ingushetia under controversial circumstances. Since then the republic has become more violent.

Then Aushev was elected to the Federation Council of Russia, the upper house of the Russian Parliament in December 1993, a position he resigned from is April 2003. Aushev served as a negotiator on the second day of the Beslan school hostage crisis, convincing the hostage-takers to release 26 nursing women and their infants.

On 30 September 2008, Aushev commented, in his interview to Echo of Moscow radio station, on the increasingly tense situation in Ingushetia, accusing the current authorities of excessive use of force in the republic, leading to the radicalization of the society and threatening to plunge Ingushetia into civil war. The opposition news website Ingushetia.org reported that the Ingush president Murat Zyazikov ordered the republic&#x27;s television and radio broadcasting center to block Echo of Moscow&#x27;s signal for the duration of Aushev&#x27;s appearance.

== Personal life ==
Aushev is married to Aza Ausheva, and has two sons, Ali and Umar, and two daughters, Leila and Lema. Ruslan also had a brother who is unidentified (classified).

== Honours and awards ==
* Hero of the Soviet Union
*Order of Lenin

<doc id="1024947" wikidata="Q876518" url="?curid=1024947" title="J/psi meson">
<text>The  (J/psi) meson is a subatomic particle, a flavor-neutral meson consisting of a charm quark and a charm antiquark. Mesons formed by a bound state of a charm quark and a charm anti-quark are generally known as &quot;charmonium&quot; or psions. The is the most common form of charmonium, due to its spin of 1 and its low rest mass. The has a rest mass of , just above that of the (), and a mean lifetime of . This lifetime was about a thousand times longer than expected.

Its discovery was made independently by two research groups, one at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, headed by Burton Richter, and one at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, headed by Samuel Ting of MIT. They discovered that they had found the same particle, and both announced their discoveries on 11 November 1974. The importance of this discovery is highlighted by the fact that the subsequent, rapid changes in high-energy physics at the time have become collectively known as the &quot;November Revolution&quot;. Richter and Ting were awarded the 1976 Nobel Prize in Physics.

== Background to discovery ==
The background to the discovery of the was both theoretical and experimental. In the 1960s, the first quark models of elementary particle physics were proposed, which said that protons, neutrons, and all other baryons, and also all mesons, are made from fractionally charged particles, the &quot;quarks&quot;, originally with three types or &quot;flavors&quot;, called &quot;up&quot;, &quot;down&quot;, and &quot;strange&quot;. (Later the model was expanded to six quarks, adding the &quot;charm&quot;, &quot;top&quot; and &quot;bottom&quot; quarks.) Despite the ability of quark models to bring order to the &quot;elementary particle zoo&quot;, they were considered something like mathematical fiction at the time, a simple artifact of deeper physical reasons.

Starting in 1969, deep inelastic scattering experiments at SLAC revealed surprising experimental evidence for particles inside of protons. Whether these were quarks or something else was not known at first. Many experiments were needed to fully identify the properties of the sub-protonic components. To a first approximation, they indeed were a match for the previously described quarks.

On the theoretical front, gauge theories with broken symmetry became the first fully viable contenders for explaining the weak interaction after Gerardus &#x27;t Hooft discovered in 1971 how to calculate with them beyond tree level. The first experimental evidence for these electroweak unification theories was the discovery of the weak neutral current in 1973. Gauge theories with quarks became a viable contender for the strong interaction in 1973, when the concept of asymptotic freedom was identified.

However, a naive mixture of electroweak theory and the quark model led to calculations about known decay modes that contradicted observation: In particular, it predicted Z boson-mediated &quot;flavor-changing&quot; decays of a strange quark into a down quark, which were not observed. A 1970 idea of Sheldon Glashow, John Iliopoulos, and Luciano Maiani, known as the GIM mechanism, showed that the flavor-changing decays would be strongly suppressed if there were a fourth quark (now called the &quot;charm quark&quot;) that was a complementary counterpart to the strange quark. By summer 1974 this work had led to theoretical predictions of what a charm + anticharm meson would be like.

The group at Brookhaven, were the first to discern a peak at 3.1 GeV in plots of production rates and named the particle the ψ meson. Ting named it the &quot;J meson&quot; in his simultaneous discovery.

== Decay modes ==
Hadronic decay modes of are strongly suppressed because of the OZI rule. This effect strongly increases the lifetime of the particle and thereby gives it its very narrow decay width of just . Because of this strong suppression, electromagnetic decays begin to compete with hadronic decays. This is why the has a significant branching fraction to leptons.

The primary decay modes are:
== melting ==
In a hot QCD medium, when the temperature is raised well beyond the Hagedorn temperature, the and its excitations are expected to melt. This is one of the predicted signals of the formation of the quark–gluon plasma. Heavy-ion experiments at CERN&#x27;s Super Proton Synchrotron and at BNL&#x27;s Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider have studied this phenomenon without a conclusive outcome as of 2009. This is due to the requirement that the disappearance of mesons is evaluated with respect to the baseline provided by the total production of all charm quark-containing subatomic particles, and because it is widely expected that some are produced and/or destroyed at time of QGP hadronization. Thus, there is uncertainty in the prevailing conditions at the initial collisions.

In fact, instead of suppression, enhanced production of is expected in heavy ion experiments at LHC where the quark-combinant production mechanism should be dominant given the large abundance of charm quarks in the QGP. Aside of , charmed B mesons (), offer a signature that indicates that quarks move freely and bind at-will when combining to form hadrons.

== Name ==
Because of the nearly simultaneous discovery, the is the only particle to have a two-letter name. Richter named it &quot;SP&quot;, after the SPEAR accelerator used at SLAC; however, none of his coworkers liked that name. After consulting with Greek-born Leo Resvanis to see which Greek letters were still available, and rejecting &quot;iota&quot; because its name implies insignificance, Richter chose &quot;psi&quot;a name which, as Gerson Goldhaber pointed out, contains the original name &quot;SP&quot;, but in reverse order. Coincidentally, later spark chamber pictures often resembled the psi shape. Ting assigned the name &quot;J&quot; to it, saying that the more stable particles, such as the W and Z bosons had Roman names, as opposed to classical particles, which had Greek names. He also cited the symbol for electromagnetic current formula_1 which much of their previous work was concentrated on to be one of the reasons.

Much of the scientific community considered it unjust to give one of the two discoverers priority, so most subsequent publications have referred to the particle as the &quot;&quot;.

The first excited state of the was called the ψ′; it is now called the ψ(2S), indicating its quantum state. The next excited state was called the ψ″; it is now called ψ(3770), indicating mass in . Other vector charm–anticharm states are denoted similarly with ψ and the quantum state (if known) or the mass. The &quot;J&quot; is not used, since Richter&#x27;s group alone first found excited states.

The name &quot;charmonium&quot; is used for the and other charm–anticharm bound states. This is by analogy with positronium, which also consists of a particle and its antiparticle (an electron and positron in the case of positronium).

<text>James Bicknell Castle High School, more commonly James B. Castle High School or simply Castle High School, is a public high school located in Kāneohe CDP, City and County of Honolulu, Hawaii.

The school serves grades 9 through 12 and has an enrollment of around 1150 students. The school is part of the Windward Oahu Subdistrict of the Hawaii Department of Education.

==History==
In 1927, the Reverend Benjamin Parker School (originally called Kāneʻohe School) opened in Kāneʻohe, Oʻahu. It started as an elementary and intermediate school, grades 1-8.

Over the years, it expanded in size and grades taught; in 1937 it became an elementary and high school, grades 1-12. In 1940, Benjamin Parker School was a founding member of the Rural O‘ahu Interscholastic Association (ROIA – with Kahuku, Leilehua, Waialua and Waipahu.)

Parker began bursting at the seams … “Congestion and inadequate accommodations at Benjamin Parker School in Kaneohe, was disclosed Thursday in a letter to the Mayor and board of supervisors by Joseph T Ferreira, of the department of public instruction, who has asked for the installation of three Quonset huts to relieve the conditions.”

Castle High School was founded in 1951. Ground was broken in 1949 for a new windward school. On “January 2, 1951, Principal Clinton Kanahele and his 700 students of Benjamin Parker Elementary and High School made their move to the new Benjamin Parker Annex on Kāne‘ohe Bay Drive.”

“During the first year of operation, approximately 750-students enrolled in grades 7-12. A library, an office and four more classrooms were under construction.” (Star Bulletin)

“At the start of the 1951-1952 school year, the name changed to James B Castle High and Intermediate School. In June, 1952, 108-seniors made up the first graduating class of the James B Castle Intermediate and High School. (In 1965, Castle became a high school servicing grades 9-12. Grades 7-8 were then served at King Intermediate School.)

When Castle High and Intermediate started, the old Parker School reverted to an elementary school, serving grades K – 6.

Castle High School is on land donated by the Castle family and is named after Hawai‘i-born James Bicknell Castle, son of American Protestant Missionary Samuel Northrop Castle (also founder of Castle and Cooke.) 

==The Community==
James B. Castle High School is located in Kaneohe, on the Windward side of the island of Oahu. Established in 1951, it is considered a commuter community with 94.7 percent of the adult population working outside the area. Once considered rural, it is now a densely populated residential area (population of 50,000) with a mix of condominiums, single-family dwellings, acre estates, five small public housing complexes, commercial businesses, and some light industry. Based on the 2019 census report, the median family income was $108,761. 5.1% of the community is considered poor. There are eight elementary schools and one intermediate school that feed into Castle High School.

==The School==
James B. Castle High School is a comprehensive four-year public high school, grades 9-12, with a current enrollment of approx. 1201 students and 85 teaching faculty for the 2015-2016 school year including a senior class of 287 students. Currently, 42% of the school population qualify for the federally assisted free or reduced lunch program. 
Castle High started Smaller Learning Communities (SLC) in 2012 to provide a personalized learning environment of a small, focused learning community. Teachers and students integrate academic and occupation-related classes as a way to enhance real-world relevance and maintain high academic standards. All students will belong to one of the four SLCs of which approximately, 30% of our graduating seniors go on to a four-year college &amp; approx. 50% attend a community college. Additionally, 6% go to business or trade school, 2% enroll in a military service, and the remaining 12% find employment. The needs of exceptional students are supported by Special Education and 504 programming. 
Castle High was accredited in 2011 by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges for a period of 6 years, and adopted School-Community-Council in place of School/Community Based Management (SCBM).

In 1977 The Castle High Marching Band became the first high school in the United States to play the half-time show at the annual East–West Shrine Game.

The high school also has an internationally recognized performing arts program, Castle Performing Arts Center, or &quot;CPAC&quot; has produced multiple shows which have been the Hawaii premiere of those shows and participated in the 2009 Fringe Festival in Edinburgh, Scotland. The theatre is named after Ronald E. Bright, former director at Castle and founder of CPAC.

<text>The responsible fatherhood movement encourages fathers to be involved in their children&#x27;s lives and advocates for societal support of such involvement.

== In the United States ==

Along with changes in family formation in the latter part of the 20th century, the issue of healthy, responsible fatherhood also began to gain attention. In 1974, Dr. James A. Levine published &quot;Who Will Raise the Children? New Options for Fathers (and Mothers).&quot; In this report, &quot;Levine suggested that the long-term goal of equal opportunity for women in American society would never be achieved without serious and meaningful recognition of the significance, interest, and responsibility of fathers in children&#x27;s lives. Levine called for changes in major social institutions, changes in how families raise boys and girls, and changes in the mutual expectations of men and women as they form families.&quot;

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, a national responsible fatherhood movement began to take form in the United States. &quot;Within this &#x27;movement,&#x27; one may discern a range of groups with competing masculinities and contesting claims and grievances...[T]he Fatherhood Responsibility Movement seeks to overcome barriers of income, race and politics.&quot;

As the responsible fatherhood movement has matured, educational and social service programs have grown to meet the needs of fathers across the country. For example, in 1981, the Ford Foundation infused the first large-scale U.S. funding for responsible fatherhood programming through The Fatherhood Project, initially at Bank Street College of Education in New York and expanding across the nation at various other sites. In 1985, the National Urban League began its Male Responsibility Project, focusing on fatherhood among teen parents. By 1988 the U.S. federal Family Support Act included a provision that allowed states to use Welfare-to-Work funds, intended to help single mothers on welfare, to increase contact between noncustodial fathers and their children. In 1991, the nation&#x27;s first fathers&#x27; resource center was launched in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The number of services and supports for fathers continues to expand.

In the first years of the 21st century, there was a growing awareness about the importance of healthy father-child relationships. &quot;Among these benefits are higher levels of school performance and increases in healthy behaviors... For example, children raised with significant positive father involvement display greater empathy, higher self-esteem, increased curiosity, higher verbal skills, and higher scores of cognitive competence.&quot; Increasingly, the responsible fatherhood movement has defined itself by focusing on the development of healthy father-child relationships. A separate branch of the men&#x27;s movement has been that related to Fathers&#x27; rights movement. In contrast, the responsible fatherhood movement embraces healthy motherhood and seeks to encourage stronger supports for mothers and fathers to grow as healthy parents.

Responsible fatherhood in the United States is traditionally defined by financial provision, declaring legal paternity, and active participating in caregiving tasks Recent research suggests that low-income fathers may define responsible fatherhood with a different set of criteria that places more emphasis on time, play, and keeping an eye on the child&#x27;s well-being, similar to a Big Brother or a social worker.

==Notable events==
* won its first ten matches of the season, which was at that time the longest winning streak in its history. This record stood until 2009, when the Saints won 19 games in a row.
* A five-minute brawl broke out between rivals Hawthorn and Essendon in the round 11 match, after which one Bomber (Justin Murphy) and four Hawks players received suspensions totalling 16 matches, and a combined total of $70,700 of fines were handed out. 27 charges were brought before the AFL Tribunal, the most ever from a single game. The game is widely known as the &quot;Line in the Sand&quot; match, as the brawls were sparked in the third quarter after Hawthorn players were urged at a half-time address by club legend Dermott Brereton to metaphorically draw such a line; Brereton thought the young Hawks were being physically intimidated by the more experienced Bombers.
*In round 13, defeated the for the first time since the merged club was established in 1997. The win broke a 10-game winning streak for Brisbane against Geelong.
* After the round 13 win over the , coach Gary Ayres was told by the board of directors that his contract would not be renewed for the next season, but would be allowed to coach the rest of 2004. Ayres subsequently resigned on the same day, without shaking hands or a word with the media. He was replaced by Neil Craig at first on a temporary basis, but then got the job permanently for 2005 and onwards.
*During the round 19 match between and the , Sydney head trainer Wally Jackson suffered a fatal heart attack during the last quarter. Most of the Sydney players were upset and distracted as Jackson was given CPR on the interchange bench; and despite Sydney having led the Kangaroos by 40 points at three-quarter time, they faded to lose by six points.
* With its round 22 win over Adelaide, clinched its third consecutive minor premiership, a feat achieved by only two other clubs in the previous 50 seasons ( 1955–60; 1999–2001). This would later prove crucial in relation to home ground advantage at the preliminary final stage.
* Despite earning a home preliminary final by beating St Kilda two weeks earlier, the Brisbane Lions were forced to play Geelong in Melbourne at the MCG, due to an agreement between the AFL and the MCG to play at least one match per week at the ground in finals. This contractual stipulation was removed following renegotiation the following season.
* Essendon’s victory over Melbourne in the first week of the finals remains, as of the end of 2024, its most recent finals victory.

<text>CJRT-FM (91.1 MHz) is a Canadian public radio station and charitable arts organization in Toronto, Ontario, known as &quot;JAZZ.FM91&quot;. The studios are on Pardee Avenue in the Liberty Village neighbourhood of Toronto. The station describes itself as Canada&#x27;s only 24-hour all-jazz radio station, with evening and weekend specialty shows devoted to jazz-influenced R&amp;B, blues, big band and Latin jazz. It has a professional staff of on-air hosts, with more than 90 volunteers assisting. It is listener-supported and holds periodic on-air fundraisers, seeking donations to support the station.

CJRT-FM has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 40,000 watts. Its transmitter is atop the CN Tower. 

The station is simulcast on Bell Satellite TV channel 960, Rogers NextBox channel 933, and Shaw Direct channel 869.

JAZZ.FM91 is a registered charity that provides youth programs, workshops, internships and scholarships in partnership with educational institutions and other arts organizations.

==History==
===Origins===
In 1949, Ryerson Institute of Technology (now Toronto Metropolitan University) received CBC approval to operate an educational FM station in Toronto (88.3 MHz - 3,000 watts).

On April 6, 1964, the licensee name was changed to the board of governors of Ryerson Polytechnical Institute (as it was then known), and CJRT-FM became a professionally staffed radio service, with the broadcast schedule increased from 7am to midnight seven days a week. There was still some student training but that ended a few years later. Future Station Manager Cam Finley joined the station in December. It played classical, jazz, and folk music, with educational and public affairs programming, children&#x27;s shows, and comedy from the BBC.

===Independence===
In 1973, Ryerson announced its intention to surrender the broadcast licence of CJRT-FM due to financial restraints. By now the station had achieved somewhat of a profile and the story reached the press. After a large public outcry, a year later in 1974, Ontario Premier Bill Davis announced that the provincial legislature would pass legislation to create an independent corporation to run the station and buy the license. On November 29, CJRT-FM INC. was incorporated by Ontario Letters Patent and CJRT-FM was transferred from Ryerson Polytechnical Institute to the new non-profit corporation. The station received money from the Ontario government and from companies and listeners through fundraising. Cam Finley was appointed acting manager in 1973, general manager in 1974 and president and GM in 1979. John Valentyn launched a weekly blues program. Bud Riley joined CJRT as news and public affairs director.

In co-operation with Ryerson and York University&#x27;s Atkinson College, CJRT offered several on-air Open College courses from 1971 to 2003. In 2003, the service was transferred to Ryerson&#x27;s G. Raymond Chang School of Continuing Education, which offers distance education through the internet, print, and recorded media rather than on radio. In its last years, Open College broadcasts aired Sunday mornings from 6am to 8am.

Following Ryerson&#x27;s loss of ownership of CJRT in 1974, CKLN-FM was licensed as Ryerson&#x27;s campus radio station from 1983 to 2011 followed by CJTM since 2016.

In 1975, Glen Woodcock began hosting &quot;The Big Band Show&quot;, which was still running more than 45 years later.

=== New format ===
In January 2001, the station quietly switched to an all-jazz format and rebranded as &quot;JAZZ.FM91&quot;. In 2004 Ross Porter, whose weeknight jazz programs on CBC Radio had made him a national name, and who later helped CanWest launch COOL-TV and Cool.FM radio, was hired to replace Chuck Camroux in July, as president and CEO

Two years later, after nearly 14 years occupying Ryerson property at 150 Mutual Street, CJRT moved to its current street-front facilities at 4 Pardee Ave. in the Liberty Village neighbourhood of Toronto. By this point, the station had added several more on-air personalities including Terry McElligott, Ralph Benmergui, Heather Bambrick, Bill King, Jaymz Bee, Walter Venafro, Reiner Schwarz, Amanda Martinez, many remain with the station to this day.

===Leadership change===
Then-president and CEO Ross Porter stepped down as CEO in June of 2018, following an investigation into allegations of workplace misconduct and creating a toxic work environment. Charles Cutts, former president and CEO of the Corporation of Massey Hall and Roy Thomson Hall, was appointed interim CEO. 

A short time later, the station cut four hosts - Jaymz Bee, Mark Wigmore, Walter Venafro and David Basskin. David Wall, director of community outreach and education, and two other employees were also affected. There was also a shake up at the boardroom level. Chair Renah Persofsky was replaced by David McGown. In December of 2018 long time Midday host Terry McElligott resigned his position at the station.

The turmoil resulted in the departure of a number of on-air staff and a decline in donations to the station. At the end of 2018 a group of JAZZ.FM91 donors formed a group called “Save JAZZFM” and launched a campaign to hold an extraordinary meeting of the charity’s membership. Following an Ontario Court ruling granting access to the membership contact information to the Save JAZZFM under the leadership of Brian Hemming. A sufficient proportion of the membership signed a petition requiring the board of directors to call the extraordinary meeting to overturn the station&#x27;s board of directors. A general meeting of the membership held on February 15, 2019, succeeded in removing the board by a vote of 446 to 435, electing a new board composed of the dissident group. 

Lorie Russell, vice president and managing director of JAZZ.FM91 announced in September 2020 that she would be leaving the station in mid-December. Former JAZZ.FM Director of Sales and Marketing Dana Wigle returned to the station as general manager., Under new management, JAZZ.FM91 won several broadcasting awards and expanded its digital presence with the addition of podcasts, specialty channels and virtual concerts.

<text>Cergy () is a commune in the French department of Val-d&#x27;Oise, to the northwest of Paris. It is located from the centre of Paris, in the &quot;new town&quot; of Cergy-Pontoise, created in the 1960s, of which it is the central and most populated commune.

Although neighbouring Pontoise is the official &quot;préfecture&quot; (capital) of the Val-d&#x27;Oise &quot;département&quot;, the &quot;préfecture&quot; building and administration, as well as the department council (&quot;conseil général&quot;), are located inside the commune of Cergy, which is regarded as the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of Val-d&#x27;Oise. The &quot;sous-préfecture&quot; building and administration, on the other hand, are located inside the commune of Pontoise.

==Name==
The name Cergy comes from Medieval Latin &quot;Sergiacum&quot;, meaning &quot;estate of Sergius&quot;, a Gallo-Roman landowner.

==Administration==

Cergy is the chief town of two cantons: Cergy-1 and Cergy-2.

===Twin towns and sister cities===
* Columbia, Maryland, United States.
* Erkrath, Germany.
* Liaoyang, People&#x27;s Republic of China.
* Porto Novo, Benin.
* Tres Cantos, Spain
* West Lancashire, United Kingdom.

Cergy is also informally twinned with a village in Palestine and a village in Senegal.

==Demographics==
When Cergy was selected to become the center of a &quot;new town&quot;, it was only a village. The commune had only 2,895 inhabitants in 1968. It then started to develop very quickly, exceeding 10,000 inhabitants in the mid-1970s and then 20,000 in the early-1980s. It is in this decade that its growth was most spectacular, since the city exceeded 48,000 inhabitants in 1990. The increase continued since, but at a notably slower pace, to reach 54,500 at 2004 estimates. However, in December 2001, the commune lost a portion of its territory (net with a 1999 population of 62 persons) to the adjacent commune of Courdimanche. The official census figures have thus been revised downward from the 1999 official 54,781 to 54,719, and the land area from to 11.65 km2.

===Immigration===
==Port Cergy==

Port Cergy is a marina on the River Oise at pk 9. The site comprises both housing and recreational yachts as well as a boating school. The marina can hold 103 ships ranging 5 to 22m long and. The northern part of the site is reserved for restaurants and shops and have been built around a small bain.

==Ham==
Ham is a small village to the south of Cergy. The village used to be part of the Sergentery and then commune of Neuville-sur-Oise but has since been amalgamated in the commune of Cergy. On its territory is the outdoor leisure centre &#x27;Base de Loisirs de Cergy-Neuville&#x27;.

==Transport==

Cergy is served by three stations on Paris RER line A and on the Transilien Paris – Saint-Lazare suburban rail line: Cergy-Préfecture, Cergy-Saint-Christophe, and Cergy-le-Haut.
Cergy is served by direct buses from Charles de Gaulle Airport.

The bus company STIVO provides 17 lines of buses to travel within the agglomeration of Cergy.

==Education==
Secondary schools:
* Junior high schools (&quot;collèges&quot;): Gérard Philipe, La Justice, Les Explorateurs, Les Touleuses, Moulin à Vent
* Senior high schools/sixth-form colleges: Lycée polyvalent Galilée and Lycée polyvalent Jules Verne

Lycée Alfred Kastler de Cergy-Pontoise is in neighbouring Pontoise.

Tertiary education:
* Cergy-Pontoise University
* CY Tech, formerly EISTI (&quot;École internationale des sciences du traitement de l&#x27;information&quot;)
*ESSEC Business School (&quot;grande école&quot;)
*ENSEA École Nationale Supérieure de l&#x27;Électronique et de ses Applications
* ITIN, IT-Institute (École supérieure d&#x27;informatique, réseaux et systèmes d&#x27;information)
* Web site of Professional Bachelor’s degree in International Trade and International Tourism (Cergy-Pontoise University)

== Security ==
Known as being a violent city in the past, with a criminal rate of 137.62 incidents per 1000 inhabitants, Cergy-Pontoise has experienced a significant decrease of violence in the past years. Reaching, in the year of 2008, a rate of 9,87 criminal incidents per 1000 inhabitants, which is still a high criminal rate.

==In popular culture==

The town was used as a filming location for Henri Verneuil&#x27;s film I... comme Icare released in 1979, starring Yves Montand. The EDF-GDF tower designed by architect Renzo Moro is the building from which the shots were fired to assassinate president Marc Jarry.
The country that the movie depicts is not named, although the United States is perhaps suggested.
The filmmakers chose the modern and innovative architecture of the new city to avoid depicting any particular country.

The town was also the location of the 1987 film My Girlfriend&#x27;s Boyfriend directed by Eric Rohmer.

<text>The Haiti national football team (, Haitian Creole: &quot;Ekip foutbòl Ayiti&quot;) represents Haiti in international football. Haiti is administered by the Fédération Haïtienne de Football (FHF), the governing body for football in Haiti. They have been a member of FIFA since 1934, a member of CONCACAF since 1961 and a member of the Caribbean Football Union (CFU) since 1978. Haiti&#x27;s home ground is Stade Sylvio Cator in Port-au-Prince and the team&#x27;s manager is Gabriel Calderón Pellegrino.

Haiti has one of the longest football traditions in the region and were the second Caribbean team to make the World Cup, after qualifying from winning the 1973 CONCACAF Championship. It was their only appearance in 1974, where they were beaten in the opening group stage by its other three teams, who were all pre-tournament favorites; Italy, Poland, and Argentina.

In 2016, Haiti qualified for the 100th anniversary of the Copa América, by defeating Trinidad and Tobago.

==History==
===Early years===
Following the affiliation of the Haitian Football Federation with FIFA in 1933, Haiti was able to register for the qualifiers for the 1934 World Cup in Italy. &quot;Les Grenadiers&quot; led by coach Édouard Baker, played three games against Cuba, all at the Parc Leconte in Port-au-Prince, having lost twice (1–3, 0–6) and one resulting in a 1–1 draw.

Haiti would then reappear on the international scene almost twenty years later, since the Federation did not enter the national team for the World Cup qualifiers of the 1938 and 1950. For the 1954 edition held in Switzerland, the team under Frenchman Baron Paul found themselves in a qualification pool with the United States and Mexico. Haiti finished in last place, losing all of its matches, with a very heavy defeat conceded to Mexico 8–0. They would again withdraw from the qualifiers for the World Cup until 1970. Regionally, Haiti won in 1957 in their first participation in the CCCF Championship including a blowout victory against Cuba 6–1 and debuted in the 1959 Pan American Games. The selection is defeated heavily by the United States 7–2, and Brazil 9–1, and refused to resume play against Argentina after an arbitration decision. Victorious against Cuba 8–2, the team finished fourth in the competition. After a 1960 season without international meetings, Haiti led by Antoine Tassy, made its second appearance in CCCF Cup in 1961. Second in their group stage behind the host country, Costa Rica, the team finished last the final stage with three defeats in three games and twelve goals conceded to zero goals scored and finished fourth. The team suffered a crushing defeat in its last match to Costa Rica 8–0.

In 1961, Haiti joined the CONCACAF, born from the merger of the NAFC and the CCCF. In 1965, Haiti took part in the second edition of the CONCACAF Championship, after being eliminated in qualifying for the inaugural edition (1963 CONCACAF Championship). This continental meeting resulted in a last place finish, losing all five of its matches played; coach Antoine Tassy then resigns. However, he returned the following year again as the team&#x27;s head coach, and won the &quot;Coupe Duvalier&quot;. During the 1967 Qualifiers, Haiti finished first and was undefeated atop of its group, ahead of Trinidad and Tobago. On 16 January 1967, marked its first victory in a competitive match against the Trinidadians, beating them 4–2. However, Haiti in the final round consisting of six teams, finished in fifth place, defeating Nicaragua 2–1 to avoid last place.

As part of the qualifiers for the 1970 World Cup hosted by Mexico, Haiti are engaged in group 2, in the company of Guatemala and Trinidad and Tobago. Directed by Antoine Tassy, Haiti was relevant for the first time in qualifying for the World Cup on 23 November 1968, in Port of Spain against Trinidad and Tobago. Haiti will reach rank at the top of the pool with wins against Trinidad and Tobago 4–0 and Guatemala 2–0, one draw against Guatemala 1–1, and one defeat conceded at home against Trinidad and Tobago 2–4 which enabled them to qualify to the second round. They then eliminated the United States before heading to the final round against El Salvador. Haiti lost the opening match at home 1–2, but managed to rebound and win 3–0 in San Salvador before losing again on neutral ground in Kingston in Jamaica, 1–0 in overtime.

At the CONCACAF Championship in 1969, Haiti was disqualified from the final round, when it had qualified in the field by beating the United States (the qualifying round is coupled with the qualifications for the World Cup 1970). Instead, the Federation was unable to register its team for the final round on time to the CONCACAF and therefore could not participate in the final round.

===The Golden Age===

The 1970s could be considered a golden age for Haitian football. Its status in the region remained very strong, being considered the &quot;third&quot; strongest team in the CONCACAF after Mexico and arguably Costa Rica. With Antoine Tassy as coach for much of this period, Haiti emerged as one of the strongest teams in the CONCACAF zone, being pooled with other regionally strong football nations such as Mexico and Costa Rica. By 1965, players like Henri Francillon, Philippe Vorbe, Guy Renold Jean François and Guy Saint-Vil were already playing in the team and would be stalwarts of the side in the coming years.

The team reached the final round of the qualifiers for the 1970 World Cup, where they faced El Salvador. After losing the first leg 2–1 at home, the team pulled off a 3–0 win at El Salvador. With each team having one win, the rules of the day dictated a play-off on neutral ground which El Salvador won to secure a place in the 1970 World Cup.

In the 1974 World Cup qualifiers, Haiti once again reached the final round in a qualifying tournament completely played at home. This time, they topped the group and qualified for their first appearance at the 1974 World Cup. In West Germany, they drew a tough group consisting of Italy, Argentina and Poland. The first half of their debut game against Italy ended in a scoreless draw, but the team surprised the football world when star forward Emmanuel Sanon scored shortly after the break to give Haiti a 1–0 lead. Although the Italians eventually came back to win the game 3–1, Sanon&#x27;s goal ended goal keeper Dino Zoff&#x27;s record run of 1143 minutes without conceding a goal in international matches. The team went on to lose to Poland (0–7) and Argentina (1–4) to finish last in their group.

===Post 1970s===
Haiti would reach the final rounds of the 1978 and 1982 qualifiers, but failed to make the cut. The years since have seen Haiti&#x27;s footballing status decline markedly. In recent years, the political situation in the country has led to numerous defections from members of the football team. The team has rebuilt somewhat through the Haitian diaspora in Miami, Florida, and some Haitian home games have been played in Miami in recent years. Haiti as of recently has been rising once again as a footballing power in the CONCACAF. In a January 2010 earthquake at least 30 people with ties to Haitian football perished, including players, coaches, referees and administrative and medical representatives. Twenty others with ties to Haitian football were feared to be buried in the ruins.

===Post Earthquake===
In November 2011, Haiti was knocked out of the qualifiers for the 2014 World Cup by Antigua and Barbuda under the leadership of Brazilian coach Edson Tavares. In 2012, Tavares was replaced by Cuban coach Israel Blake Cantero who led the national team through the 2012 Caribbean Championship. Haiti finished third in the Caribbean Championship warranting a spot in the 2013 Gold Cup. The following year, Haiti would have a bad string of defeats against Chile, Bolivia, Oman and the Dominican Republic. In June 2013, Haiti bounced back from these shortcomings with a close 2–1 loss to reigning world champions Spain and an impressive 2–2 draw with footballing powerhouse Italy, with goals in both games scored by Wilde-Donald Guerrier, Olrish Saurel and Jean-Philippe Peguero respectively. The 2018 World Cup qualifiers had Haiti beating Grenada to reach the fourth round, where they fell off with only four points - one for a goalless draw with Panama, three for beating Jamaica in Kingston. In 2019, they made the farthest they ever had in the CONCACAF Gold Cup by going 3–0 in the group stages including a last-minute goal against Costa Rica and coming back from a 2–0 deficit against Canada in the Quarter-finals, winning the game 3–2. However, it all stopped after Mexico got away with a controversial foul which gave Mexico a penalty shot. They would lose the game 1–0.

===Colours===
The Haiti national team utilizes a two-colour system, composed of red and blue. The team&#x27;s two colours originate from the national flag of Haiti, known as the &quot;bicolore&quot;. Although, during the Duvalier administration in Haiti, the country undergone a color change to its flag, swapping out the blue for &quot;black&quot; and it reflected in its 1974 World Cup kit and federation crest.

Since the team&#x27;s inception, Haiti&#x27;s kit has undergone numerous color pattern variations. The home kit has traditionally been either all blue or a variation of predominately blue shirts, with red shorts and blue socks, while the away kit has traditionally been inversely worn that is either all red or a variation of predominately red shirts, with blue shorts and red socks. Haiti has occasionally had a third kit, which has traditionally been all white, which the current kit features, along with its all blue colours at home and all red colours away. Haiti also wears the crest of the Federation on its shirt and at times on its shorts as well.

Haiti has been provided kits by a number of manufacturers, some of which have been from a few local and lesser known suppliers. The first known kit manufacturer was Adidas for the 1974 World Cup. In 2013, a five-year contract was reached with Colombian manufacturer, Saeta for $1 million. After 8 years, the Haitian Federation and Saeta are terminating their agreement. The details of the end date of their contract and the reason for the termination has not yet been released to the general public.

<text>Tadeusz Samuel Smoleński (1884–1909) was a Polish Egyptologist.

After research work on the history of Poland he was sent to Egypt for his health in 1905. In Egypt he learnt Arabic but after visiting the Cairo Museum and seeing the monuments he decided to make Egyptology his career.

Smoleński applied to Gaston Maspero and obtained a post in the library of the French Institute and studied Egyptian. He was later able to devote himself entirely to study, his first Egyptological work being &quot;Etat actuel des recherches egyptologiques&quot; (1906). Smoleński directed an archaeological expedition to Sharuna near Oxyrhynchus in 1907, discovering a huge necropolis of various periods; (see his article on the tomb of a Sixth Dynasty prince in ASAE8).

He also excavated another necropolis at el-Gamhud; some artifacts are in the Kraków Museums. &quot;Les peuples maritimes du nord a l&#x27;epoque de Ramses II et de Merenptah&quot; was published after his death. Smoleński was the real pioneer of Polish Egyptology, and his early death cut short a career of great promise.

<text>Edward Neville da Costa Andrade FRS ( 27 December 1887 – 6 June 1971) was an English physicist, writer, and poet. He told &quot;The Literary Digest&quot; his name was pronounced &quot;as written, i.e., like &quot;air raid&quot;, with &quot;and&quot; substituted for &quot;air&quot;.&quot; In the scientific world Andrade is best known for work (with Ernest Rutherford) that first determined the wavelength of a type of gamma radiation, proving it was far higher in energies than X-rays known at the time. Also, a rheological model suggested by him and bearing his name is still widely employed in continuum mechanics and its geophysical applications. In popular culture he was best known for his appearances on The Brains Trust.

==Life==
Edward Neville Andrade was a Sephardi Jew, his family having arrived in London from Portugal during the Napoleonic era, and was a descendant of Moses da Costa Andrade (not Moses da Costa as is sometimes stated). da Costa Andrade was his 2nd great-grandfather, a feather merchant in London&#x27;s East End. The surname &quot;Andrade&quot; might nevertheless be of Portuguese origin (see notes on original pronunciation) born and raised in London he attended St. Dunstan&#x27;s College in Catford, which was noted as the first school to have a laboratory for teaching secondary school age pupils. From there he attended University College London under Prof F. T. Trouton where he gained a first-class honours degree in physics in 1907. After graduating he stayed on to pursue research, choosing to study the flow of solid metals under stress, a subject to which he returned several times over the sixty-year course of his research career

In 1910 Edward Neville studied for a doctorate on the electrical properties of flames under Prof Lenard at the University of Heidelberg and then had a brief but productive spell of research with Ernest Rutherford at Manchester in 1914. They carried out diffraction experiments to determine the wavelengths of gamma-rays from radium, and were the first to be able to quantitate these, thereby showing that they were shorter than the wavelengths of then-known X-ray radiation that was produced by &quot;Roentgen tubes&quot;. He joined the Royal Artillery during the First World War, and then became Professor of Physics at the Ordnance College in Woolwich in 1920.

==Career==
He was Quain Professor of Physics at University College, London from 1928 to 1950, and then Fullerian Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution for three years, until opposition to his attempts to reform the RI led to a vote of no confidence in him by members of the RI, following which he resigned. In 1943 Andrade was invited to deliver the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures on &quot;Vibrations and Waves&quot;, then in 1950 he developed the lectures further and presented the series on &quot;Waves and Vibrations&quot;.

Andrade was also a broadcaster, coming to fame during the War on BBC radio&#x27;s &quot;The Brains Trust&quot;.

<text>John C. Hocking (born 1960) is an American fantasy writer, the author of a Conan novel published by Tor Books and a number of short stories. One of his stories, &quot;The Face in the Sea&quot;, won the 2009 Harper&#x27;s Pen Award for Sword and Sorcery fiction.

==Writing career==
According to Hocking, he wrote his Conan novel &quot;Conan and the Emerald Lotus&quot; out of dissatisfaction with the Conan novels being published in the early 1990s, &quot;trying to put into the story all the things I thought were missing from Conan pastiche at that time.&quot; After taking three years to write it, he was proud enough of the result that he &quot;didn&#x27;t want to just drop it into a drawer ...[s]o I sent out a handful of letters, and L. Sprague de Camp responded ...that if I sent him my book he&#x27;d look it over. He liked it a lot and LOTUS was published.&quot; After its success he spent two years writing a second Conan novel, &quot;Conan and the Living Plague&quot;, under contract with Conan Properties, which was &quot;sufficiently pleased with the book that they wanted to use it to attract a new publisher for Conan and try to break into hardcover.&quot; Publication of it and a third Conan novel Hocking had started were canceled due to a change in ownership of Conan Properties.

Hocking has since published a number of fantasy stories, most forming a series featuring the original character Brand the Viking.

<text>Pontoise () is a commune north of Paris, France. It is located from the centre of Paris, in the &quot;new town&quot; of Cergy-Pontoise.

==Administration==
Pontoise is the official (capital) of the Val-d&#x27;Oise &quot;département&quot;, although in reality the &quot;préfecture&quot; building and administration, as well as the department council (&quot;conseil général&quot;), are located in the neighboring commune of Cergy, which is regarded as the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of Val-d&#x27;Oise.

The road still exists and is now part of the N14 from Paris to Rouen. It is also known to many people as the birthplace of the alchemist Nicholas Flamel.
With an over 2,000 year legacy, Pontoise still has vestiges of the past, such as medieval lanes, convents, churches and museums, and was awarded the &quot;City of Art and History Label&quot; in 2006.
The impressionist painter Camille Pissarro made it famous through many paintings which are present nowadays in the most famous art galleries in the world.

<text>Arthur Wells Gilmore, known as Art Gilmore (March 18, 1912 – September 25, 2010) was an American actor and announcer heard on radio and television programs, children&#x27;s records, movies, trailers, radio commercials, and documentary films. He also appeared in several television series and a few feature films.

==Biography==
Reared in Tacoma, Washington, Gilmore attended Washington State University in 1931, where he was a member of the Chi chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity and a member of the Alpha Omicron chapter of Theta Chi fraternity. In 1935, he was hired to work as an announcer for Seattle&#x27;s KOL Radio. In 1936, he became a staff announcer for the Warner Brothers&#x27; radio station KFWB in Hollywood and then moved to the CBS-owned station KNX as a news reader. During World War II, he served as a fighter-director U.S. Navy officer aboard an aircraft carrier in the Pacific Ocean.

Leaving the Navy, he decided to become a professional singer and returned to Hollywood. 
With a group of notable Hollywood radio stars, including Edgar Bergen, Ralph Edwards, Les Tremayne, and Jim Jordan, Gilmore founded Pacific Pioneer Broadcasters in 1966. At the time of his death, he was Chairman Emeritus of PPB. The organization presents the Art Gilmore Career Achievement Award four times each year to celebrities who have made notable contributions to the broadcasting and related industries. The organization was renamed Hollywood Media Professionals in 2019. &quot;Pacific Pioneer Broadcasters&quot; materials are at American Radio Archives.

==Radio==
Gilmore&#x27;s announcing voice became a part of many radio programs. Drawing his inspiration from the radio sports commentators of the 1930s, he became the announcer for &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Frank Race&quot;, &quot;Dr. Christian&quot;, &quot;Sears Radio Theater&quot;, &quot;Stars over Hollywood&quot;, &quot;The Golden Days of Radio&quot; and other radio shows. It was Gilmore who introduced Herbert W. Armstrong and Garner Ted Armstrong, reminding listeners to request free religious literature at the conclusion of &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot; on radio and television.

==Television==
With the advent of television, Gilmore heralded &quot;The George Gobel Show&quot;, &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot;, &quot;An Evening with Fred Astaire&quot; and many others. 

He narrated 156 episodes of &quot;Highway Patrol&quot; with Broderick Crawford, 39 segments of &quot;Mackenzie&#x27;s Raiders&quot; with Richard Carlson 41 episodes of &quot;Men of Annapolis&quot; and all 36 episodes of &quot;The New Breed. 

His television appearances included &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, &quot;Adam-12&quot;, &quot;Emergency!&quot;, &quot;Dragnet&quot; and &quot;The Waltons&quot;. He announced Ronald Reagan&#x27;s &quot;A Time for Choosing&quot; speech in 1964 supporting Barry Goldwater for U.S. President.

==Films==
Gilmore was heard in films as the voice of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the 1942 production of &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot;, and in &quot;The Gallant Hours&quot; (1960), where he was the narrator for Japanese sequences. His dramatic voice was also heard on countless film trailers beginning in the 1940s (he narrated the trailer for the 1946 film &quot;Gilda&quot;), and on documentary films throughout the 1950s and 1960s. (He appeared on camera at the beginning of the trailer for the 1948 thriller &quot;The Big Clock&quot;.) He narrated the &quot;Joe McDoakes&quot; series of short comedies which starred George O&#x27;Hanlon, notably &quot;So You Want to Be a Detective&quot; (1948), in which he participated (with the camera as his point of view). Gilmore also served as the president of American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) from 1961 until 1963.

==Recordings==
In addition to his radio-TV work, he provided the narration for many collections of recorded musical works and a large number of recordings for children. Gilmore was also active in reading textbooks for the blind and dyslexic for many years.

==Books==
Gilmore co-authored the book &quot;Television and Radio Announcing&quot;.

==Death==
He died of natural causes on September 25, 2010, aged 98. Gilmore was survived by his wife, Grace; daughters Marilyn and Barbara; two grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. His nephew, Robb Weller, said that his uncle was the reason he chose to work in broadcasting.

<text>Edgar Ricardo Arjona Morales (born 19 January 1964), known as Ricardo Arjona (), is a Guatemalan singer and songwriter. He is one of the most successful and best-selling Latin American artists of all time, with more than 20 million records sold. His music ranges from ballads to Latin pop, rock, pop rock, Cuban music, and more recently a cappella performances and a mixture of Tejano music and Norteño music, and Latin sounds. Arjona is noted for his lyrical style, and often addresses topics such as love, sexuality, violence, racism and immigration.

As of 2016, Arjona had released sixteen studio albums, one live album, nine compilation albums and forty-three singles. Four Arjona albums reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Latin Albums, and ten reached number one in Argentina. Four albums had charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Four singles had reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Songs chart and seven had done the same on Latin Pop Songs. His work earned him numerous awards and accolades, including one Grammy Award, one Latin Grammy Award, the Latin Heritage Award as well as awards from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers; a silver and golden torch and two silver seagulls from the 2010 Viña del Mar International Song Festival, two &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Music Awards, and a &quot;Latin Trajectory of the Year&quot; Award at the Orgullosamente Latino Awards of 2010.

==Early life==
Edgar Ricardo Arjona Morales was born on 19 January 1964, in Jocotenango, Guatemala, to parents Ricardo Arjona Moscoso and Mimi Morales de Arjona. He spent most of his childhood in Guatemala City, where he began his musical instruction. At age twelve, he participated in the contest &quot;Festival Infantil Juventud 74&quot; with &quot;Gracias al Mundo&quot;, a song composed by his father, finally winning the event. Although he initially enrolled in architecture and engineering at the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala (USAC), he graduated with a degree from the School of Communication Sciences.

==Sports career==

Arjona was a talented basketball player who played for &quot;Leones de Marte&quot; and &quot;TRIAS&quot;. He toured Central America as a member of the Guatemala national basketball team. Until 2005, he held the record for the most points scored (79) in a single game by a Guatemalan. He also taught at a primary school (called &quot;Santa Elena III&quot;), where he claimed to have spent six hours giving lessons and the rest of the day playing football. This earned him a visit from a Ministry of Education representative, who was sent to evaluate his pupils. The representative found that the students&#x27; education was actually above average. In 1988, he became the basketball coach of a boys&#x27; school (called &quot;Instituto Don Bosco&quot;).

== Music career ==

=== 1980s: Beginnings and early breakthrough ===
Arjona began his musical career at age 21, when he signed with the now defunct Guatemalan record label, Discos de Centroamérica, S.A., and distributed by PolyGram, and released his debut album &quot;Déjame Decir Que Te Amo&quot; in 1985. The label attempted to portray Arjona as a stereotypical Latin lover. The title track was released as a single, &quot;Déjame Decir Que Te Amo&quot;. This album failed to chart, but received moderate praise from critics, with Allmusic awarding it three stars out of five. Because of his negative experience recording the album and its commercial failure, he decided to abandon music to teach school. At age 24, Arjona reversed course and sought the opportunity to represent his country in the OTI Festival with the song &quot;Con Una Estrella En El Vientre&quot;. The sessions immediately following this decision produced the song &quot;S.O.S Rescátame&quot;. His second studio album, &quot;Jesús, Verbo No Sustantivo&quot; brought him commercial and critical success across Latin America and the U.S. and became a best-seller in many Central American territories.

=== 1990s: International breakthrough, &quot;Si El Norte Fuera El Sur&quot; and &quot;Sin Daños a Terceros&quot; ===
Arjona started the new decade as a regular in the Mexican telenovela (soap opera) &quot;Alcanzar una Estrella&quot; (English translation: Reaching a Star), which assisted him in becoming a known singer throughout Latin America. After joining Sony Music in 1990 he released &quot;Del Otro Lado del Sol&quot;, one of his least successful albums. That year, he started composing songs for other artists, such as Yuri&#x27;s &quot;Detrás de Mi Ventana&quot;, for her album &quot;Nueva era&quot; (1993). The song became a hit, reaching No.1 on the US Hot Latin Songs chart for three weeks in 1994. He later covered the song in his compilation album, &quot;Trópico&quot; (2009), alongside Melina León. &quot;Animal Nocturno&quot;, Arjona&#x27;s fourth studio album, was released in 1993. The album contained the hit singles &quot;Mujeres&quot; (No. 6 on Latin Songs) and &quot;Primera Vez&quot; (No. 6 on Latin Songs) and received thirteen platinum and one diamond certifications. &quot;Animal Nocturno&quot; sold 500,000 copies in 1994, and carried Arjona to fame along with his work on the Mexican telenovela &quot;Alcanzar Una Estrella&quot;, which allowed him to showcase his songwriting and singing skills.
He confirmed his reputation with the release of his fifth studio album, &quot;Historias&quot;. The album sold 2 million copies throughout Latin America and received twenty-seven platinum and two diamond certifications, including quadruple Platinum in Argentina. &quot;Historias&quot; reached No. 43 on Top Latin Albums and included the hit singles &quot;Te Conozco&quot; (No. 3 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Songs) and &quot;Señora De Las Cuatro Décadas&quot; (No. 7 on Latin Songs). The Allmusic review by Jason Birchmeier awarded the album 4.5 stars stating that &quot;If you were to pick only one Arjona album for your collection that wasn&#x27;t a greatest-hits compilation, this should be the one. &quot;Historias&quot; was a career-defining success for Arjona.&quot; His fourth and fifth studio albums were the best-selling of his career.

In 1996, he released his sixth studio album, &quot;Si El Norte Fuera El Sur&quot;. This was the first album in which Arjona ventured beyond the theme of love to explore nationalism and globalization, among other sociopolitical topics. Its four singles were &quot;Si El Norte Fuera El Sur&quot; (No. 9 on Latin Pop Songs), whose main theme is the relationship between the United States and Latin America, &quot;Tu Reputación&quot; (No. 18 on Latin Songs, No. 2 on Latin Pop Songs), &quot;Me Enseñaste&quot; (No. 18 on Latin Pop Songs), and &quot;Ella y Él&quot; (No. 24 on Latin Songs, No. 8 on Latin Pop Songs). Birchmeier awarded the album 4.5 stars stating &quot;All in all, it&#x27;s Arjona&#x27;s third classic album in a row, each distinct from its predecessor.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; named it the Rock Album of the Year in 1997. &quot;Si El Norte Fuera El Sur&quot; received multiple Platinum certifications in the United States and Argentina.

In 1998, he released his seventh studio album, &quot;Sin Daños a Terceros&quot;. Terry Jenkins from Allmusic, on his review of the album, awarded it 4 stars, writing that &quot;&quot;Sin Daños a Terceros&quot; continues Ricardo Arjona&#x27;s streak of accomplished, affecting albums that spotlights both his melodic skills and his sharp social consciousness.&quot; His fourth consecutive album to receive critical success, &quot;Sin Daños a Terceros&quot; also enjoyed commercial success, debuting at No. 6 on Top Latin Albums, the first to reach the top 10, and reaching No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Pop Albums chart. It contained the hit singles &quot;Dime Que No&quot; (No. 6 on Latin Songs, No. 3 on Latin Pop Songs), and &quot;Mentiroso&quot; (No. 22 on Latin Songs, No. 5 on Latin Pop Songs). The album received multiple Platinum certifications from the United States and Argentina. More than 700,000 copies were sold.

On 5 December 1998 and in front of a live audience of more than 100,000 people at the Hippodrome of Guatemala City, Arjona recorded his first live album, the 1999 release &quot;Vivo&quot;. The album was moderately successful, certified Gold in Mexico and Platinum in the United States and Argentina. It produced the hit &quot;Desnuda&quot;, which became his first No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Latin Songs chart. As of December 2005, &quot;Vivo&quot; had sold 243,000 copies in the United States, his best-selling album there as of that date.

=== 2000–2005: &quot;Galería Caribe&quot;, world tour, &quot;Santo Pecado&quot;, hiatus and &quot;Adentro&quot; ===
Arjona&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;Galería Caribe&quot; was preceded by the single &quot;Cuándo&quot;, which became a commercial success and reached No. 1 on both Top Latin Songs and Latin Pop Songs. The singer commented that the album consumed twelve months and that before starting, he &quot;had more friends.&quot; He also mentioned he had &quot;lived in love with Caribbean culture and music since my childhood.&quot; Birchmeier awarded the album 3 stars stating &quot;All in all, &quot;Galería Caribe&quot; is a curious entry in Arjona&#x27;s catalog that most fans can overlook without missing much.&quot; The album became his first to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at No. 136, while charting at No. 1 on Top Latin Albums and Latin Pop Albums. It was awarded Platinum certification in Mexico, Argentina and the US. Its three singles were &quot;Lo Poco Que Queda De Mi&quot;; &quot;Mesías&quot;, which reached No. 19 on Top Latin Songs and No. 11 on the Latin Pop Songs chart, and &quot;A Cara O Cruz&quot;, which reached No. 28 on Latin Pop Songs. To promote the album, which sold more than one million copies, Arjona embarked on his &quot;Galería Caribe Tour&quot;, which began in Mexico in 2000 and finished in 2001.


In &quot;Mesias&quot; Arjona talks about a character who appears &quot;in the form of a wealthy, well-armed magnate with [...] some sinister plan for the world.&quot; Some critics argued that it was a &quot;metaphorical attack&quot; on capitalism and imperialism, named as &quot;classic Arjona targets.&quot; The song became a subject of some controversy when fans and critics noted connections between its theme and the attacks of September 2001, months after the song&#x27;s release, which resulted in the FBI investigating Arjona. The singer later commented that &quot;Mesías&quot; had no relationship to the attacks, and that the lyrics were pure coincidence. He further stated the FBI had never spoken directly to him, but instead to somebody on his team.

On 19 November 2002, Arjona released his ninth studio album, &quot;Santo Pecado&quot;, preceded by singles &quot;El Problema&quot;, which reached No. 1 on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Latin Songs and Latin Pop Songs charts, and &quot;Minutos&quot;, which reached No. 5 on the Top Latin Songs and No. 3 on the Latin Pop Songs charts. &quot;Santo Pecado&quot; became a commercial success, selling more than 300,000 copies just in Mexico (double Platinum), 160,000 in Argentina (quadruple Platinum) and 200,000 in the United States (double Platinum). In 2003 Arjona released &quot;Lados B&quot;, his second compilation album, including songs that were &quot;not so commercial&quot;, and that he wanted to give a second chance at radio airplay. The album contained songs from all his past studio albums. Critical reception for the album was mixed. Birchmeier noted that it was &quot;a misleading entry point into Arjona&#x27;s catalog.&quot; Despite this, the album received a Gold certification in Mexico.

On 6 December 2005, Arjona released his tenth studio album, &quot;Adentro&quot;. This was Arjona&#x27;s first collaboration with Tommy Torres. In an interview, the singer commented that he first &quot;tested&quot; Torres by sending him the &quot;hookiest and darkest tracks&quot; on the album, &quot;Acompañame A Estar Solo&quot; and &quot;Iluso&quot;. Torres said that he &quot;went all out on the first demo, hiring a full band that included a string orchestra&quot;, which grabbed Arjona&#x27;s attention. The album was critically acclaimed, with Evan C. Gutiérrez from Allmusic giving it four stars out of five and commenting that &quot;Be it for the stripped, natural production value, the confident performance of Ricardo Arjona, or his relevant-as-ever lyricism, he&#x27;s got both his loyal fans and the execs at Norte smiling. While the instrumentation, performance, and overall sonic palette of this project are minimalist and unassuming, there is a depth and brilliance to them. The listener&#x27;s ear does not tire or want for more, humble as &quot;Adentro&quot; is.&quot; Arjona further commented that &quot;Adentro&quot; was &quot;a very representative and tremendously complete album,&quot; adding that &quot;having different producers made it rich in possibilities.&quot;

&quot;Adentro&quot; became Arjona&#x27;s second studio album to chart on the Billboard 200, reaching No. 126. It reached No. 3 on the Top Latin Albums and No. 2 on the Latin Pop Albums charts. Five singles were released from &quot;Adentro&quot;: the lead single, &quot;Acompañame A Estar Solo&quot; (No. 7 on Latin Songs, No. 1 on Latin Pop Songs), &quot;Pingüinos En La Cama&quot; featuring Spanish singer Chenoa (No. 44 on Latin Songs, No. 19 on Latin Pop Songs); &quot;Mojado&quot;, featuring American Tejano/Norteño band Intocable (No. 34 on Latin Songs, No. 30 on Latin Pop Songs), &quot;A Ti&quot; (No. 14 on Latin Songs, No. 3 on Latin Pop Songs), and &quot;De Vez En Mes&quot; (No. 49 on Latin Songs, No. 16 on Latin Pop Songs). The album sold more than a million copies worldwide.

=== 2006–2007: Adentro Tour and &quot;Quién Dijo Ayer&quot; ===
In 2006, Arjona started the first leg of his world tour, named the &quot;Adentro Tour&quot;. The tour resumed in 2007 for a second leg, in which he visited more countries. Approximately two million people attended the performances. The tour was officially closed on 14 September 2007 on the mainland city of Barquisimeto, Venezuela, during the International Fair, in front of more than 100,000 people. On 21 August 2007, Arjona released his fifth compilation album, &quot;Quién Dijo Ayer&quot;. The album is a two-disc set which contains, on the first disc, new versions of past hits, some of them including featured artists such as Marta Sánchez on &quot;Tarde (Sin Daños a Terceros)&quot; from &quot;Sin Daños a Terceros&quot;; Panteón Rococó on &quot;Si El Norte Fuera el Sur&quot;, from the album of the same name; Marc Anthony on &quot;Historia de Taxi&quot;, from &quot;Historias&quot;; Eros Ramazzotti on &quot;A Ti&quot;, from &quot;Adentro&quot;, and Sandro on &quot;Realmente No Estoy Tan Solo&quot;, from &quot;Historias&quot;, and which was the last song recorded by the singer, who died on 4 January 2010. Arjona&#x27;s manager told Argentinian newspaper &quot;Clarín&quot; that &quot;[the singer] had the idea of inviting Roberto [Sandro] for his album, he [Sandro] showed enthusiasm and manifested the same degree of appreciation to Arjona. It seemed to him that he [Arjona] was an artist who proclaims the same values he proclaimed.&quot; The second disc contained remastered versions of the hits on the first disc, but in their original versions. It was the second time Arjona collaborated with Torres.

The album became a critical and commercial success. Jason Birchmeier commented that &quot;while only a couple of the new versions depart stylistically from the originals, the contemporary productions breathe new life into these songs, which should be well known by longtime fans&quot;, and reaching double Platinum in Argentina and the United States, and Platinum in Mexico. The record was additionally certified Gold in Colombia, Chile and Venezuela. Two singles were released from the album. The first, &quot;Quién&quot;, a previously unreleased song produced by Torres, failed to reach the top 20 on Latin Songs, standing at No. 21, but reached No. 4 on the Latin Pop Songs chart. Arjona commented that &quot;&#x27;Quién&#x27; is a story with the hurry of the desperate, is the flashback of those who end up loving alone.&quot; &quot;Quiero&quot;, the second single, reached No.12 on the Latin Songs chart, and No.8 on the Latin Pop Songs chart.

=== 2008–2010: New label, &quot;Quinto Piso&quot;, world tour and &quot;Poquita Ropa&quot; ===
After spending the majority of his career with Sony, and Sony BMG, Arjona signed a long-term deal with Warner Music Latina in September 2008. Iñigo Zabala, chairman of Warner Music Latin America, said &quot;He&#x27;s an artist that fits perfectly with our company,&quot; and that &quot;We are a label that has a major catalog of songwriters and quality pop and rock from the likes of Maná, Alejandro Sanz, Laura Pausini, and now, Arjona.&quot; Arjona announced his eleventh studio album, &quot;5to Piso&quot;, on 18 November 2008. The album was preceded by the first single, &quot;Cómo Duele&quot; on September, which reached No. 2 on Top Latin Songs and No. 1 on Latin Pop Songs. He moved approximately 200,000 copies of the album in the first month at retail, and it went Platinum in Mexico, the United States, Spain, Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia, Guatemala, and several other countries. It debuted at No. 1 on Top Latin Albums, becoming his second chart-topper on that list, and sold more than one million copies worldwide. The album received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Latin Pop Album and a Latin Grammy Award nomination for Best Singer-Songwriter Album. The album received positive critical response. Birchmeier gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five, saying that &quot;More typical than exceptional for Arjona at this point in his career, &quot;5to Piso&quot; isn&#x27;t as grand an album as his past few... Yet it&#x27;s a great album all the same, particularly the opening run of songs that culminates with &#x27;Cómo Duele&#x27;, and it finds Arjona still at the top of his craft.&quot;

While Warner Music released his new studio album, Sony Music released a compilation album, &quot;Simplemente Lo Mejor&quot;. This led to speculation that the labels were in a fight to win Arjona&#x27;s fanbase and sales. &quot;Simplemente Lo Mejor&quot; contained hits from past albums, namely &quot;Sin Daños a Terceros&quot;, &quot;Si El Norte Fuera El Sur&quot;, among others. This compilation went Gold in Mexico, and Platinum in Argentina. &quot;Sin Ti... Sin Mi&quot; was released as &quot;5to Piso&quot;&#x27;s second single, and reached No. 4 on both Top Latin Songs and Latin Pop Songs charts. On 24 April 2009, Arjona started the Quinto Piso Tour. The tour included 123 shows in the United States, Spain, Argentina, Guatemala, Colombia, Venezuela and Mexico, among many other countries in Latin America, and ended on 18 June 2010.
The &quot;Quinto Piso Tour&quot; was one of the most successful tours made by a Latin artist, with more than one million attendees from 19 countries. He received in 2010 the &quot;Latin Tour of the Year&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Music Award for the tour. On 26 February 2010, he participated in the 2010 Viña del Mar International Song Festival as one of the top performers. His performance was followed by Colombian singer Fanny Lu. One hour after Lu&#x27;s performance, a 8.8 magnitude massive earthquake affected the south-central regions of Chile. On social networks, Arjona was jokingly blamed, with remarks such as &quot;earthquakes go where he goes&quot;, making reference also to the earthquake felt in Mexico after the singer arrived. After the tour, Arjona announced his twelfth studio album, &quot;Poquita Ropa&quot;, which was released on 24 August 2010. It was preceded by the genre-mixing track &quot;Puente&quot;, an ode to Havana, Cuba&#x27;s largest and capital city. The song failed to break in the upper tier of &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, and was reportedly prohibited in Cuba. The album became his third to debut or reach No. 1 on the Top Latin Albums chart. Within two weeks of release, the album received a Gold certification in Chile, United States, Colombia and Puerto Rico; and Platinum certification in Mexico and Argentina.

The album marked a change in Arjona&#x27;s sound, which he called a &quot;stripped-down version&quot; of his music. Birchmeier gave the album a somewhat positive review, saying that it was a &quot;stripped-down acoustic effort&quot; yet considered it &quot;impressive&quot;. Two more singles were released from &quot;Poquita Ropa&quot;, &quot;Vida&quot;, a song the singer dedicated to his recently deceased father; and &quot;Marta&quot;, an autobiographical song whose music video stars Edith González. Both, like the lead single, failed to gain much airplay in the U.S., and charted poorly.

=== 2011–2013: &quot;Independiente&quot;, Metamorfosis and world tour ===
Arjona released his thirteenth studio album, &quot;Independiente&quot;, on 4 October 2011. It became his fourth number-one on the Top Latin Albums chart the week ending 22 October 2011; and within a week went Gold in Chile, United States and Mexico; and Platinum in Venezuela and Argentina. &quot;Independiente&quot; was his first release as an independent artist, appearing on his Metamorfosis label, a company he created to refocus his career. The album was distributed by Warner. &quot;Billboard&quot; noted that although other groups have decided to go independent after working with major record labels, Arjona was by far the most important artist in Latin pop to do so. By the end of 2012, the album sold more than 500,000 copies in the United States and 4,000,000 copies worldwide.
&quot;El Amor&quot; was released in August 2011 as the lead single from &quot;Independiente&quot;; it managed to top both the US Latin Songs and Latin Pop Songs charts. It also became a hit in the rest of Latin America, reaching number one in several countries. &quot;Fuiste Tú&quot;, a collaboration with Guatemalan singer Gaby Moreno, followed as second single in February 2013; it reached number two on the Latin Songs chart, and topped the Latin Pop Songs chart. On May, Arjona released the music video for &quot;Mi Novia Se Me Está Poniendo Vieja.&quot; However, &quot;Te Quiero&quot; was released as third single in July 2012, and became the second song off the album to top the Latin Songs chart. This made &quot;Independiente&quot; Arjona&#x27;s first album to ever have two number-one hits on that chart. The song also topped the Latin Pop Songs chart, becoming the third song off the album to do so. &quot;Si Tu No Existieras&quot; was released in November 2012, and managed to peak at number 14 in Mexico.

To promote the album, Arjona embarked on the Metamorfosis World Tour. The show, his first since 2009&#x27;s Quinto Piso Tour, comprised five legs across North and Latin America. It ran from January 2012 until March 2013 and included 102 shows in 18 countries, with an estimated attendance of over one million people. The tour opened in Toluca, where he had started all of his concert tours, and grossed more than $13.4 million in the United States.

=== 2021: Blanco y Negro tour===

In September 2021, Arjona announced a 25-date North America tour, named Blanco y Negro. The tour, presented by Loud and Live, kicked off March 24, 2022 at the Kiva Auditorium in Albuquerque and concluded on June 11, 2022 at Coliseo de Puerto Rico in San Juan.

== Personal life ==
In 1988, during his time in Buenos Aires, Argentina, he met Puerto Rican Leslie Torres with whom he began a long-distance relationship as Arjona had decided to stay in Mexico for a few years. Leslie occasionally visited him, until 1992 when they got married in an impromptu ceremony in Las Vegas. Before arriving in Las Vegas he decided to try his luck in a casino playing blackjack and lost almost all the money he had with him. Upon arriving in Las Vegas after settling in a hotel, with the little money he had left he tried his luck again at gambling and made a fortune.

The year they married, Torres gave birth to their daughter, Adria, who currently works as an actress; two years later in 1994, their son Ricardo was born. After ten years of marriage, they announced their separation. Although they were legally separated as of 2005, for 3 years they fought for custody of their children during which she accused him of violence.

In 2010, began his current romantic relationship with Venezuelan model Deisy Arvelo, with whom he had his third child, Nicolás Arjona Arvelo. On September 27 of that same year his father Arjona Moscoso died at the age of 78. Three years later, on December 4, 2013, his mother Nohemí Morales died at the age of 71.

== Music and style ==

Arjona&#x27;s primary musical style is Latin pop. He usually sings without the help of featured or additional singers. His style varied over the years, as Arjona took risks to keep his music from becoming stale. In contrast to the ballad-laden &quot;Déjame Decir Que Te Amo&quot;, on the following two albums Arjona experimented with a range of pop/rock styles. &quot;Animal Nocturno&quot; intersperses energetic rock songs among heartfelt ballads, and the instrumentation is heavy on guitar, synthesizer, and drums. On &quot;Historias&quot;, each song is stylistically distinct and the instrumentation is varied. Around two dozen instruments were used on the album, including horns, piano and Hammond B-3, and strings. On &quot;Si El Norte Fuera El Sur&quot;, he crafted a relatively low-key effort characterized by intimate songs about love, culture, and politics. Most of the songs were written in 1995 while Arjona was touring and are performed acoustically with Caribbean touches. Besides a couple of rockers, the songs are fairly even in tone and tempo.

In &quot;Galería Caribe&quot;, Arjona explored Afro-Caribbean sounds, employing traditional rhythms such as guaracha, bachata, merengue, and salsa. On &quot;Santo Pecado&quot;, Arjona explored the use of symphonic sounds on his ballads, amidst a couple of rock songs stylistically similar to those on &quot;Sin Daños a Terceros&quot;. This album included the song &quot;La Nena (Bitácora de un Secuetro)&quot;, in which Arjona relates the story of a girl who is kidnapped by her uncle. Then, in 2005, Arjona adopted new sounds in &quot;Adentro&quot;. Gutierrez considered the instrumentation, performance, and overall sonic palette to be &quot;minimalist&quot; and &quot;unassuming&quot;. On this album, Arjona included more Latin sounds, Mexican and Tejano music on &quot;Mojado&quot;, a song about immigration; merengue and Colombian tones on &quot;Adiós Melancolía&quot;, and some on &quot;No Te Cambio Por Nada&quot;.

On 2007&#x27;s &quot;Quién Dijo Ayer&quot;, Arjona reworked past songs to fit a new style. For example, he gave &quot;Si El Norte Fuera El Sur&quot; a ska beat, and performed with the aid of Panteón Rococó. He transformed &quot;Historia de Taxi&quot; into a salsa song, with the help of American singer Marc Anthony and pianist Sergio George, who commented that &quot;It&#x27;s been interesting to work with two figures from different music worlds on the interest of making good music.&quot; He further stated that &quot;every time a reunion of this kind happens, it&#x27;s a reason to celebrate.&quot; Birchmeier commented, &quot;While only a couple of the new versions depart stylistically from the originals, the contemporary productions breathe new life into these songs.&quot; &quot;Realmente No Estoy Tan Solo&quot; was re-recorded with singer Sandro. This turned out to be the last song recorded by the latter, who died 4 January 2010. This album included three new songs. The lead single, &quot;Quién&quot; was written by Arjona and produced by himself and Torres. &quot;Quiero&quot; and &quot;Espantapájaros&quot; are the other two new songs on the album.
&quot;5to Piso&quot; is mainly driven by piano and strings. Exceptions are &quot;La Bailarina Vecina&quot;, crafted with pure orchestral arrangements; and &quot;Ni Tú Ni Yo&quot;, a Ranchera style song featuring Paquita la del Barrio. The album also includes a song called &quot;Que Nadie Vea&quot;, in which the artist sings about homosexuality. On &quot;5to Piso&quot;, Arjona commented that he tried to recoup the freshness of his first albums, saying that he &quot;tried to reconcile a little with the Ricardo Arjona from the first albums to let out some of that freshness that makes so good to the songs.&quot; &quot;Poquita Ropa&quot; offered a drastic change in which Arjona minimized the number of instruments. The result was a set of a cappella performances. Arjona commented about this album that &quot;music and women look better with little clothes.&quot; Production was handled by Arjona and Dan Warner, who also worked with Shakira, Celine Dion and Christina Aguilera. Birchmeier gave the album a somewhat positive review, saying that it was a &quot;stripped-down acoustic effort&quot;, considering it &quot;impressive&quot;. He also commented that &quot;Poquita Ropa&quot; &quot;finds Arjona at his most naked, backed by spare arrangements of acoustic guitar, piano, and Hammond B-3 along with occasional touches of strings, woodwinds, and chorus vocals.&quot;
&quot;Puente&quot;, the lead single, is the only notable exception. It lasts eight and a half minutes and is divided in three parts. The first is sung mainly with a piano. The second part is a ballad with Caribbean and Latin sounds, with some salsa and Cuban influences. The third mixes salsa and merengue, with Cuban influences. &quot;Puente&quot; resembles Arjona&#x27;s work on &quot;Galería Caribe&quot;. This album was the first since &quot;Adentro&quot;, that Arjona worked without Torres. In &quot;Independiente&quot;, Arjona returned to his trademark sound, which Torres helped craft. David Jeffries of Allmusic gave the album a somewhat positive review. He compared the production values and musical style of &quot;Independiente&quot; with those of past albums &quot;Animal Nocturno&quot; and &quot;Historias&quot;, stating, &quot;Returning fans will revel in this combination of freedom and growth, and appreciate the return of producer Tommy Torres, the man who has been behind the boards for quite a few of Arjona&#x27;s most popular releases&quot;, referring precisely to the absence of Torres in the production of &quot;Poquita Ropa&quot;.

<text>The Organization for the Reconstruction of the Communist Party of Greece (), mostly known by its acronym OAKKE, is a minor Greek political party known for its strong anti-Russian positions. The Secretary of the Central Committee of OAKKE is Ilias Zafiropoulos.

OAKKE was established in 1985 and is part of the Greek far-left, and it stems from the multiple splits of the Greek Maoist movement. It is best known for its pro-industrialisation views, as it considers industrial growth a prerequisite for the development of the working class, which is required for the socialist revolution.

Another political feature of OAKKE is its views regarding an alleged Russian conspiracy to corrupt the left and install its own world regime. They argue that Russian imperialism is today the main threat for all humanity, just like Adolf Hitler was in the 1930s and 1940s. OAKKE supports the independence of Chechnya from Russia and sees Russia as the organizer of the September 11, 2001 attacks.

== History ==

The Organization for the Reconstruction of the Communist Party of Greece (OAKKE) is a Greek political organization of Marxist - Leninist - Maoist ideology. It was founded on July 20, 1985, by former members of EKKE – MLKKE party (EKKE was the “Revolutionary Communist Movement of Greece” and MLKKE was the “Marxist – Leninist Communist Party of Greece”, both of Maoist orientation), who left the party in June of that year. In the formation of OAKKE took part namely the whole Party Organisation of Piraeus of EKKE – MLKKE, all the members of EKKE - MLKKE who, before the unification of the two parties in 1982 were members of EKKE except for two, and some other members and cadres of EKKE - MLKKE emanating from the pre-1982 MLKKE from the rest of the country.

The political strategy of OAKKE is the reconstruction of the old revolutionary Communist Party of Greece (KKE) of the period 1918-1956 (as the currently named KKE party is considered by OAKKE as a non-communist, social-fascist party), but under the new conditions and enriched with the experience the last 50 years and Maoism. The revolution in Greece, according to OAKKE, will be socialist in nature and anti-imperialist in form and will establish the political status of the dictatorship of the proletariat, while the broader front through which the proletariat would lead to broad democratic anti-fascist movement will be the Anti-Russian Democratic and Patriotic Front (ADIPAM). The basis of this analysis is the political line of the Third Communist International on the Antifascist Front and the Three Worlds Theory of the Chinese Communist Party in the 1970s. OAKKE places great emphasis in their writing to the defense of the political heritage of the Secretary of the KKE between 1931 - 1956 Nikos Zachariadis, whom he considers, in line with the contradictory information received by Russian authorities between 1973 and 1990, but mainly based on political analysis, murdered by the leaders of the CPSU. It is also the only organization in Greece nowadays, which maintains next to the forefront of its publications the five heads of Marx - Engels - Lenin - Stalin - Mao.

== Positions ==
=== Russian social imperialism ===
According to the positions of OAKKE, which describes itself as a proletarian revolutionary and anti-imperialist organization, it conducts a struggle mainly against “Russian social imperialism”, which is currently considered by it the biggest threat to world peace, as was the pre-war Nazi Germany, based, as said before, on the Maoist strategy of the three worlds. The Russian social imperialism, according to OAKKE, from 1991 on, enters a new phase because the perestroika and reform &quot;were the most profound attempts of social-fascist Russia to become autonomous from the USSR to try from that moment onwards to coil again around her a neo-tsarist empire from the ruins of the USSR. This is the era of the &quot;dead bug&quot; which ends today with the creation of Russian-Chinese war axis.

=== Neo-Nazi axis (Russia, China, and Iran) ===
Furthermore, according to the positions of the organization, there is an allied axis which consists of Russia - China - Iran, under the overall guidance of the first, which is, in its essence, neo-Nazi. Despite its opposition to the expansionist policy of the most chauvinistic aspects of the Israeli bourgeoisie and its support for the struggle of the Palestinian people and to gain this right to an independent state, OAKKE, unlike all the other organizations and parties in Greece with reference to the left, defends the armed fight Israel is waging against forces such as Hamas and Hezbollah, and believes these two organizations are Islamo-Nazi and hidden arms of the neo-Nazi axis.

So, OAKKE took -in the main- the side of Israel in the battle that the latter gave in the summer of 2006 against Hezbollah, as OAKKE believes that anti-Semitism, today expressed by the request for the destruction of the state of Israel and the theory of &quot;stateless Jewish capitalist&quot; and &quot;the Jewish conspiracy for world domination,&quot; will be one of the flags of the Axis in a possible global war waged against first and foremost the peoples of the world, but also against the rivals of Russia, China, and Iran, thus the western imperialists.

=== Productive sabotage ===
A key role in the analysis of the organization is played by the concept of &quot;productive sabotage.&quot; This is defined by OAKKE as the destruction of the productive capital in Greece, through either the breaking down and closure of existing production units, often with “left” arguments (ecological, supposedly anti-capitalist, archaeological, etc.) or by preventing the investments by the local and western bourgeoisie. This attributed – by OAKKE – to the relationship of the leaders of the KKE and SYN from 1956 on, and of the prime ministers Andreas Papandreou and Costas Simitis, Kostas Karamanlis and George Papandreou with Russian social-imperialism. According to OAKKE, Andreas Papandreou, the father of the current prime minister and founder of the governing PASOK party, was one of the best Russian agents of all time.

In the OAKKE analysis, the Russians and their allies or agents in Greece do this because Russia -as an imperialist country - is economically much weaker than western imperialism, and so, whatever productive capital cannot be controlled by it, must be damaged in order to economically and politically weaken a country, so as to subdue it. Direct or indirect relations with Russian social imperialism, based on the start of their business or other information from their business process, are attributed by OAKKE to large Greek businessmen, among them Sokratis Kokkalis, George Bobolas, Panos Germanos, Andreas Vgenopoulos etc.

=== Productivism ===
A frequent criticism made by other organizations who refer to Marxism towards OAKKE is the one of &quot;productivism,” a theory which gives priority to the development of productive forces and not to the change of the relations of production, which was characteristic of the Mensheviks in the Russian social democracy before the Revolution of 1917 and a point of friction with the Bolsheviks. OAKKE, beyond its founding declaration of 1985, in which it refers critically to this Menshevik productivist theory, most recently has answered that the fight that it gives and that it calls people to give is not mainly for the development of the productive forces, but in the opposite for the breaking of the productive relations of the country&#x27;s dependence from Russian social imperialism, ultimately from any imperialism as part of the revolutionary destruction of all capitalist relations of production and their replacement by revolutionary means with socialist relations, in the way for a world classless communist society.

=== Participation of Greece in the European Union ===
Finally, another difference with the other parties of the left is that OAKKE supports strategically (since November 1995 and its 2nd Conference) the participation of Greece in the EU, on the grounds that it is a union of bourgeois states made by consensus and not with violence, that in the main the internal relations are not based on imperialist imposition of the large state to the small one but on the bourgeois democratic consensus of the 27 States, and that through this process the European proletariat is objectively released to a certain degree by the nationalism and the chauvinism of the bourgeoisie of each country. Most importantly, since 1990 and its 1st Congress, OAKKE was supporting – in terms of tactics – the eve of Greece in the then EEC (as opposed to the founding position of OAKKE in 1985, which was a direct exit from the EEC) with the notion that United Europe constitutes a mound to the two superpowers, Russia and the US, especially to the Russians, who according to Mao Zedong, have as their first geo-strategic goal the military conquest of Western Europe.

In accordance to its position on the need to strengthen the political unification of Europe, left behind by economic integration, the organization was in favor of the Euro-constitution, unlike all the other organizations listed on the left.

=== Reconstruction of the world communist movement ===
On the question of reconstruction of the world communist movement, the OAKKE, condensing its position, notes that &quot;the new revolutionary workers parties will now have a big mandate from their members and followers: Not to become the major new rulers of society and their executives and their members not to become the new exploiters.

This means that even from now, even the smaller new workers&#x27; parties and the most industrious young revolutionary nuclei should be applied two or three basic principles: never “liberate” the masses against their will but to respect their own moods, never allow their members to convert their knowledge and their previous fight in authoritarianism, arrogance and material benefits but always to come under the criticism of the masses and to live like them, not to divide the workers to “ours” and “not ours” but to unite them by an open and honest policy, even against the current and not telling everyone what he wants to hear, and above all never put any specific class interests over the general class interests and national interests over global interests of the working class.

== Election results ==
Since 1989 OAKKE has participated in all national elections and European elections. In national elections in 1996 it collaborated with the “Rainbow”. In the 2004 elections, it received 5,090 votes (0.08%). In the parliamentary elections of 2007, it received 2,473 votes(0.03%). In the 2009 European elections, it received 2,808 votes (0.05).

Since 1985, OAKKE have participated in all national elections and EU-elections. The party says that fights &quot;against the red-brown political current&quot;, the political parties that support &quot;Russian imperialism&quot;. In the 2004 elections for the European Parliament, OAKKE took part obtaining 5,090 votes (0.08% of the total Greek vote). OAKKE in the 1996 elections formed an alliance with the Macedonian Slavs activist party, Rainbow.

=== Hellenic Parliament ===

=== European Parliament ===
== Organizations close to OAKKE ==
OAKKE publishes its own newspaper, &quot;Nea Anatoli&quot; (in Greek &quot;Νέα Ανατολή&quot;). Also the leading members Elias Zafiropoulos, Anna Stae and other personalities of the Greek left founded the Non Governmental Organization, Antinazi Initiative. The Trade Union wing of OAKKE, acting mainly in the ship repair zone in Perama, is ERGAS.

Antinazi Initiative, corresponds to the British antifascist &quot;Searchlight&quot;.

It publishes the monthly newspaper &quot;New Orient&quot;, and wall newspapers which are posted at key points in many cities across the country by its members and friends.

<text>Fort Koshkonong (Fort Cosconong) was a military fort located near the present-day city of Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin. Intended to control the confluence of the Bark and Rock rivers, it was used as a station for local militia units and the U.S. regulars in the region to scout the British Band, a group of Native Americans who fought against government units during the 1832 Black Hawk War. General Henry Atkinson was the commander of the fort during the war. Black Hawk was in the same general area, but evaded capture and started to flee towards the Wisconsin River. The original fort was abandoned by the Army following the conflict. Local settlers dismantled it for the wood as the town developed.

Today the fort&#x27;s original location along the Rock River is marked with a monument. The city built a replica of the fort during the Great Depression of the 1930s as a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project funded by the President Franklin D. Roosevelt administration. Its overall size is somewhat larger than the original fort, but provides a representation of how it looked during the Black Hawk War.

Fort Koshkonong shares its name with Lake Koshkonong, which is several miles downriver. Very shallow, the lake at the time of the fort&#x27;s activity was more of a marsh with the river flowing through it. It increased in size when the river was dammed and is one of the larger lakes in Wisconsin in acreage.

The Fort was located at . The replica is located about a mile and a half west in Rock River Park at .

<doc id="1025028" wikidata="Q4529" url="?curid=1025028" title="Veronica Mars">
<text>Veronica Mars is an American teen neo-noir mystery drama television series created by screenwriter Rob Thomas. The series is set in the fictional town of Neptune, California, and stars Kristen Bell as the eponymous character. The series premiered on September 22, 2004, during television network UPN&#x27;s final two years, and ended on May 22, 2007, after a season on UPN&#x27;s successor, The CW, airing for three seasons total. &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; was produced by Warner Bros. Television, Silver Pictures Television, Stu Segall Productions, and Rob Thomas Productions. Joel Silver and Thomas were executive producers for the entire run of the series, while Diane Ruggiero was promoted in the third season.

The character Veronica Mars is a student who progresses from high school to college while moonlighting as a private investigator under the tutelage of her detective father. In each episode, Veronica solves a different stand-alone case while working to solve a more complex mystery. The first two seasons of the series each had a season-long mystery arc, introduced in the first episode of the season and solved in the season finale. The third season took a different format, focusing on smaller mystery arcs that would last several episodes.

Thomas initially wrote &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; as a young adult novel, which featured a male protagonist; he changed this because he thought a noir piece told from a female point of view would be more interesting and original. Filming began in March 2004, and the series premiered in September to 2.49 million American viewers. The critically acclaimed first season&#x27;s run of 22 episodes garnered an average of 2.5 million viewers per episode in the United States. The series appeared on several fall television best lists and garnered awards and nominations. During the series&#x27; run, it was nominated for two Satellite Awards, four Saturn Awards, five Teen Choice Awards and was featured on AFI&#x27;s TV Programs of the Year for 2005.

The show was cancelled after its third season, and Thomas wrote a feature film script continuing the series. Warner Bros. opted not to fund the project at the time. On March 13, 2013, Bell and Thomas launched a fundraising campaign to produce the film through Kickstarter and attained the $2 million goal in less than 11 hours. They accumulated over $5.7 million on Kickstarter. The film was released on March 14, 2014. An eight-episode fourth season was released on July 19, 2019 on Hulu.

In November 2019, it was announced that there were no plans for Hulu to order a fifth season.

==Series overview==

===Season 1===
Season 1 revolves around Veronica Mars, a high school student and private investigator in the fictional Southern California seaside town of Neptune. As the daughter of well-respected County Sheriff Keith Mars, Veronica&#x27;s biggest life problem was getting dumped by her boyfriend, Duncan Kane, until the murder of her best friend, Lilly Kane. After Lilly&#x27;s murder, Veronica&#x27;s life falls apart. Keith mistakenly accuses Lilly&#x27;s father, popular software billionaire Jake Kane, of involvement. When Mr. Kane is proven to be innocent, he has Keith ousted as sheriff in a recall election; Keith is replaced by the corrupt Don Lamb. Veronica&#x27;s mother, Lianne, develops a drinking problem and leaves town, never to return. Veronica&#x27;s &quot;09er&quot; friends—wealthy students from the fictional 90909 ZIP Code—demand that she choose between them and her father; Veronica chooses her father. After losing the election for sheriff and being ostracized by the entire community, Keith opens a private investigation agency, Mars Investigations, where Veronica works part-time. Veronica helps her father solve cases and conducts her own investigations on behalf of schoolmates.

Veronica discovers evidence suggesting that Abel Koontz, the man imprisoned after confessing to Lilly&#x27;s murder, is innocent. Veronica explores the murder case. She also works on other investigations, seeks her estranged mother&#x27;s whereabouts, and copes with being raped during an 09er party after her drink was spiked. Veronica, no longer part of the school&#x27;s wealthy and elite &quot;in-crowd,&quot; makes some new friends: Wallace Fennel, Neptune High basketball star and new student; Eli &quot;Weevil&quot; Navarro, leader of the PCHers, a Latino biker gang; and Cindy &quot;Mac&quot; Mackenzie, Neptune High&#x27;s resident computer genius. Using her friends&#x27; resources and those provided by her father and his contacts, Veronica gains a reputation for sleuthing and finds her skills in increasingly high demand at her school and in the community. Things get more complicated when Veronica falls into a relationship with Lilly&#x27;s ex-boyfriend Logan Echolls, who for a time held Veronica partly responsible for Lilly&#x27;s death and went out of his way to harass her. It is eventually revealed that Lilly was killed by Aaron Echolls, Logan&#x27;s father.

===Season 2===

The second season begins with introducing two new cases: a bus accident that kills several of Veronica&#x27;s classmates and the death of PCH gang member Felix Toombs. A school bus carrying six Neptune High students and a teacher plunges off a cliff, killing all but one passenger. Veronica, who was supposed to be on the bus, makes it her mission to discover why the bus crashed and who is responsible. Logan picks a fight with Weevil and the PCHers and ends up accused of killing Felix (a charge he denies). Through the season, Weevil becomes convinced of Logan&#x27;s innocence, and they team up to find the real killer. This season shows Veronica&#x27;s life returning to much the way it had been before Lilly&#x27;s death: having broken up with Logan during the summer, she reunites with Duncan and is somewhat accepted by the 09ers. Her sleuthing sideline and tough persona keep her from fully assimilating into the wealthy crowd. 09ers Dick Casablancas and Cassidy &quot;Beaver&quot; Casablancas deal with a gold-digging stepmother, Kendall Casablancas, with whom they are left when their father flees the country while under investigation for real estate fraud. Wallace discovers that his biological father is alive and takes a romantic interest in Jackie Cook, the daughter of baseball legend Terrence Cook who is investigated for the bus accident. Veronica discovers that the town mayor, who years ago coached a little league baseball team, sexually molested several team members, including Cassidy. In the finale, it is discovered that Cassidy is responsible for the bus accident and Veronica&#x27;s rape, as well as a plane crash that kills the mayor (Veronica&#x27;s dad was supposed to be on the plane, so she thinks he is dead). Veronica confronts Cassidy on the roof of the Neptune Grand hotel, where he tries to kill her. Logan saves her, but Cassidy dies by suicide.

===Season 3===

Veronica, Logan, Wallace, Mac, and Dick are freshmen at Neptune&#x27;s Hearst College in the third season. Two new regular main characters are introduced: Stosh &quot;Piz&quot; Piznarski and Parker Lee, Wallace and Mac&#x27;s respective roommates. The first mystery is established when Parker becomes a victim of the Hearst serial rapist, a storyline carried over from the second season. Feeling guilty for not helping her and remembering her rape, Veronica works to catch the rapist. The next mystery, the murder of the College&#x27;s Dean, commences in the same episode that the rapist is caught. Keith begins an adulterous affair with a married client, Wallace struggles to balance academics and sports, Mac begins dating again after previous failed relationships, and Dick has a breakdown and appeals to Logan for help. The season chronicles Veronica and Logan&#x27;s failing attempts to maintain their relationship in the face of Veronica&#x27;s increasing mistrust.

===Season 4===

The fourth season opens in 2019, twelve years after the series finale and five following the film. Veronica is living with Logan in Neptune and still solving mysteries with Keith. A significant case arises when several Spring break locations are bombed, with suspects including a US Representative to a Mexican cartel.

==Cast and characters==


The first season had seven regular characters. Kristen Bell portrayed the title character Veronica Mars, a high school junior and skilled private detective. Teddy Dunn played Duncan Kane, Veronica&#x27;s ex-boyfriend and Lilly&#x27;s brother. Jason Dohring played Logan Echolls, the &quot;bad-boy&quot; 09er, the son of an A-list actor. Percy Daggs III portrayed Wallace Fennel, Veronica&#x27;s best friend and frequent partner in solving mysteries. Francis Capra portrayed Eli &quot;Weevil&quot; Navarro, the leader of the PCH Biker gang and Veronica&#x27;s friend. Enrico Colantoni played Veronica&#x27;s father Keith Mars, a private investigator and former Balboa County Sheriff. Sydney Tamiia Poitier played Mallory Dent, Veronica&#x27;s journalism teacher at Neptune High. Although she was given series regular billing, Poitier appeared in only four episodes, but was given credit for seven. Poitier&#x27;s removal from the series was rumored to be due to budget issues.

Thomas, who said he &quot;conceive[d] the show as a one-year mystery,&quot; decided that he needed to introduce and eliminate several characters to be able to create an &quot;equally fascinating mystery&quot; for the series&#x27; second season. Thomas felt that he could not bring back the Kanes and the Echolls and &quot;have them all involved in a new mystery&quot;; he needed &quot;new blood&quot;. The second season saw the introduction of Tessa Thompson as Jackie Cook, a romantic interest of Wallace and daughter of a famous baseball player. Previous recurring characters Dick Casablancas and Cassidy &quot;Beaver&quot; Casablancas were upgraded to series regulars. Dick, played by Ryan Hansen, was an 09er friend of Logan, a womanizer and former high-school bully turned frat boy. Kyle Gallner portrayed &quot;Beaver,&quot; Dick&#x27;s introverted younger brother. Dunn left the series midway through the season, although was credited as a main cast member throughout that season. Thomas explained that the Logan-Veronica-Duncan love triangle had run its course, and to keep the series fresh, there would need to be &quot;other guys in her life.&quot; He attributed Dunn&#x27;s removal to fan interest dominating the Logan-Veronica relationship, saying &quot;it became clear that one suitor won out&quot;.

The third season introduced two new series regulars, Parker Lee and Stosh &quot;Piz&quot; Piznarski. Julie Gonzalo portrayed Parker, Mac&#x27;s extroverted roommate and &quot;everything that Mac is not.&quot; Piz, played by Chris Lowell, was Wallace&#x27;s roommate and a music lover with his campus radio show. Piz was named after the director of the pilot, Mark Piznarski. The character gave Veronica another middle-class male friend. Thomas used the radio show as a narrative device to capture the mood of the university. Cindy &quot;Mac&quot; Mackenzie and Don Lamb, recurring characters in the first two seasons, were upgraded to series regulars. Mac, portrayed by Tina Majorino, was a computer expert befriended by Veronica. Lamb, portrayed by Michael Muhney, was the Balboa County Sheriff who won the office from Keith in the recall election.

==Production==

===Conception===
Rob Thomas originally wrote &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; as a young adult novel for publishing company Simon &amp; Schuster. Before his first television job on &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, Thomas sold two novel ideas. One of these was provisionally titled &quot;Untitled Rob Thomas Teen Detective Novel&quot;, which formed the series&#x27;s basis. The novel had many elements similar to &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, though the protagonist was male. Thomas&#x27;s father was a vice-principal at Westlake High School near Austin, Texas, and the main character attended a &quot;thinly disguised version&quot; of the school. As Thomas had begun writing for film and television, he did not resume his teen detective idea for several years. Writing a novel could take months for Thomas, whereas a television script only took several weeks. Knowing that television scripts paid more, Thomas wrote the teen detective project&#x27;s television version as a spec script before it became a novel. Since no studio or network had asked him to write it, and he would not get paid unless it sold, Thomas said that &quot;it was never a very pressing project for me.&quot; Tinkering with it from time to time, Thomas wrote project notes a year before writing the television script. Most of his original ideas made it into the script, but some changed drastically. Thomas wanted to use flashbacks, and he had to shorten the timeline so that the murder could happen in a recent time. Thomas changed the gender of the protagonist because he thought a noir piece told from a female point of view would be more interesting and unique.

===Casting===

Kristen Bell was chosen to play Veronica Mars from more than 500 women who auditioned for the role. Bell felt that it was &quot;just luck&quot; that Rob Thomas saw that &quot;I have some sass to me, and that&#x27;s exactly what he wanted.&quot; Bell thought that her cheerleader looks and an outsider&#x27;s attitude set her apart from the other women who auditioned.

Jason Dohring, who played Logan, originally auditioned for the role of Duncan. Teddy Dunn originally auditioned for Logan, but ended up portraying Duncan. Dohring felt that his audition for Duncan &quot;was a little dark&quot;, and he was told by the producers that it was &quot;not really right&quot;. The producers asked Dohring to read for the role of Logan. Dohring acted one scene from the pilot, in which he shattered the headlights of a car with a crowbar. During the final auditions, Dohring read twice with Bell and met with the studio and the network. When reading with Bell, Dohring acted the whole scene as if he had raped her and tried to give the character an evil and fun feel. At the time of Dohring&#x27;s audition for Logan, the character was only going to be a guest star in the pilot.

Percy Daggs III auditioned for Wallace Fennel&#x27;s role twice and took three tests with studio and network executives. During his first audition, Daggs read four scenes from the pilot. Just before his studio test, Daggs read with Bell and had &quot;a great conversation.&quot; He said that she &quot;made me feel comfortable about auditioning&quot; and was a big reason why he became more comfortable playing Wallace as the season went on.

Thomas described Amanda Seyfried, who portrayed the murdered Lilly Kane, as &quot;the biggest surprise of the year.&quot; When casting a series regular, he was able to see all the best actors in town, mainly because they all wanted to be a series regular. When casting Lilly Kane, who would only appear from time-to-time as &quot;the dead girl,&quot; Thomas did not receive the same level of actors. Thomas said that he had &quot;never had a more cut and dried audition&quot; than he did with Seyfried. He said that she was &quot;about 100 times better than anyone else that we saw; she was just spectacular&quot;. He continued by saying that she ended up being so good in the series that he used her three or four more times than he initially planned.

===Writing and format===
Episodes have a distinct structure: Veronica investigates a different &quot;case of the week&quot; while trying to solve a larger mystery that spans several episodes or a whole season. The first two seasons of &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; have a season-long mystery arc, which is introduced in the first episode of the season and solved in the finale. The third season takes on a different format, focusing on two smaller mystery arcs that last the course of nine and six episodes respectively. The final five episodes of the season feature stand-alone mysteries.

During the first season, Thomas was unsure if the series&#x27;s success was attributed to each episode&#x27;s &quot;case of the week&quot; or the overarching story. He realized that fans were cool with the &quot;case of the week&quot; but returned for the ongoing mystery. Thomas felt that Bell had been overworked in the first season, and the mystery involving Logan and Weevil in the second season was an attempt to give her some time off. He said that the mystery arcs of the second season had &quot;way too many suspects, way too many red herrings&quot; and that the third season needed a change.

The third season was initially planned to include three separate mysteries that would be introduced and resolved in a series of non-overlapping story arcs. Thomas realized by talking to CW Entertainment President Dawn Ostroff that viewers got too confused by his original format, and the new format would allow new viewers to start watching at any point in the season. Inspired by the improvised thriller &quot;Bubble&quot;, Thomas started laying &quot;subtle&quot; motives for the second mystery during the first one, so that fans would have &quot;a theory on whodunit&quot; when it occurred. The first mystery took place over the first nine episodes. Originally, the second mystery was to be seven episodes long, and the third mystery was to occur over the last six episodes of the season. This was changed when The CW ordered a 20 episode season instead of the usual 22 episodes. The second mystery arc was shortened from seven episodes to six, and the third mystery was first changed from a six-episode arc to a five-episode arc. After an eight-week hiatus for the series was announced, the final mystery was changed to five stand-alone episodes designed to be friendlier to new viewers. The final mystery was originally going to be &quot;unlike any of the others we&#x27;ve done before.&quot; Previously, &quot;nice characters&quot; like Wallace and Mac had always been absent from the big mystery because no one was going to believe them as a suspect. For the third mystery, Thomas had wanted to present a situation where Wallace and Mac could be fully involved, &quot;key players [with] really interesting stuff to do.&quot;

===Filming===
The original pilot was darker in tone than the one aired. Thomas intended to take the script to FX, HBO or Showtime, but gave UPN &quot;credit&quot; as they only wanted it a bit lighter to match their standards and practices. A lengthy debate considered whether Veronica could be a rape victim; UPN eventually agreed. In the aired pilot, Lilly was found by the pool in the same spot where she was murdered. However, Thomas stated that Lilly&#x27;s body was originally going to be found in the ocean, and he had a plan for events that led there. Thomas pitched the idea to UPN, but the network felt that it was &quot;too dark and creepy&quot; for Jake to dispose of his daughter&#x27;s body to protect his son, and the idea was changed.

Many of the series&#x27; scenes were filmed at Stu Segall Productions in San Diego, California. Producer Paul Kurta said that most of the Neptune scenes were filmed in Oceanside, California. Kurta liked that it was &quot;a seaside town that still feels like middle-class people live there [...] Most of the seaside towns feel resort driven.&quot; It was estimated that the series spent $44 million a year shooting each season in San Diego, comprising more than half of the revenue generated by film production there in 2006.

The Neptune High setting was also in Oceanside. The school, Oceanside High School, was paid $7,750 by Stu Segall Productions for the use of the campus and extras. The series&#x27; third season setting of Hearst College was mostly filmed on the campuses of San Diego State University, University of San Diego and the University of California, San Diego. Filming locations were chosen by the director and by production designer Alfred Sole. Sole reportedly &quot;really liked the look and feel of the school&quot;, and San Diego State University invited the series with &quot;open arms&quot;. Taping at the university led to financial and employment benefits for the university and its students. Alumni worked as crew members while students worked as actors; half of the third season extras were students from the university&#x27;s film department.

The fourth season was filmed in Hermosa Beach, California, primarily at the Sea Sprite Hotel.

===Music===
&quot;We Used to Be Friends&quot; by The Dandy Warhols was used as the series&#x27; theme song. Composer Josh Kramon was originally going to produce a noir version of a 1980s song for the theme. However, Rob Thomas was &quot;pretty much set on finding a song,&quot; and &quot;We Used to Be Friends&quot; was chosen right from the beginning. TV critic Samantha Holloway considered this theme to be one of &quot;the five most recognizable, sing-along-able, memorable and best theme songs.&quot; The theme song was remixed in a softer piano style with dark and vibrant electronic beats to reflect the more noir-influenced opening credits in the third season.

Kramon wrote the original background music to convey the film noir themes. For the pilot, Thomas wanted &quot;a really atmospheric, kind of modern noir type of vibe,&quot; and Kramon used sounds similar to that of Air and Zero 7. Kramon used &quot;traditional sounds&quot; for the series but also processed and filtered them. Among the instruments used were piano, vibraphone, and guitar. When using an acoustic piano, Kramon would use compression to not sound like a traditional piano. Live bass and percussion were also used, as Kramon did not like to program them. The main instrument used was the guitar, but Kramon felt that the piano was &quot;by far the most important instrument for working on TV shows, especially when you&#x27;re doing everything yourself.&quot;

A week before choosing the sounds for the episodes, the crew had a &quot;spotting session,&quot; where they would discuss with Thomas and the producers which type of music would be featured. Kramon did not decide the songs to be featured but composed and created the whole score. Since there was little orchestral music, and Kramon could play guitar, piano, bass, and drums, he played all parts without another musician. &quot;Veronica Mars: Original Television Soundtrack&quot;, a song compilation from the series&#x27; first and second seasons, was released by Nettwerk Records on September 27, 2005. Thomas revealed that the primary goal for the soundtrack was to &quot;get more publicity, which will in turn hopefully get more viewers for the show&quot;.

==Cancellation, film and revival==

===Cancellation===

In January 2007, Dawn Ostroff announced that while she was pleased with the gradual ratings improvement of &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, the series would be put on hiatus after the February sweeps to air a new reality series, &quot;Pussycat Dolls Present&quot;. When the hiatus ended, the series returned for the last five episodes of the season. At the 2007 CW Upfront, Ostroff announced that &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; was not part of the new primetime lineup and was &quot;not coming back&quot;. Thomas created a trailer that took place four years after the third-season finale, with the working title &quot;Veronica in the FBI&quot;, and released it on the third season DVD. When asked if the FBI concept could happen, Ostroff said that the series was probably completely gone &quot;in any form&quot;. Ostroff also said that Kristen Bell and Rob Thomas might collaborate on another project for the CW network. In June 2007, &quot;TV Guide&quot; writer Michael Ausiello confirmed that the cancellation of &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; was official.

===Potential film progress===
Thomas stated that he was interested in writing a feature film based on the series to provide closure to the storylines and character arcs. In September 2008, Michael Ausiello, writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, reported that Thomas had met with Bell to discuss the plot, which would likely involve Veronica solving crime in college rather than as an FBI agent. Thomas felt that the &quot;FBI scenario was more of a &#x27;What if...?&#x27;&quot;, aimed at getting a fourth season and that he &quot;would want to bring back our key players, and it would be tough to believe that the FBI stationed Veronica in Neptune.&quot; Ausiello later reported that Enrico Colantoni would be involved in the project. Colantoni said that he was fully aware of the talks taking place, adding, &quot;cult shows have translated well into the film arena. Nothing&#x27;s official, but they&#x27;re talking about it.&quot; In addition to the feature-film possibility, Thomas had a meeting with DC Comics to talk about a &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; comic book series.

In September 2008, Thomas told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; that &quot;I thought I had the idea broken, but I&#x27;ve hit a wall in the final act that I haven&#x27;t quite figured out.&quot; Thomas explained that he had been very busy writing for &quot;Cupid&quot; and &quot;Party Down&quot;, both of which he created. In January 2009, &quot;TV Guide&quot; reported that the film was Thomas&#x27; first priority after &quot;Cupid&quot;. Thomas noted that as well as writing the script, someone would need to pay for the film, but indicated that producer Joel Silver was ready to green-light the film. In June 2009, Bell said &quot;I don&#x27;t think it will ever happen, and here&#x27;s why: [Series creator] Rob Thomas and I had a powwow, and we were both 100 percent on board. We took our proposal to Warner Bros., and Joel Silver told us that there is no enthusiasm [there] to make a &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; movie, and that is, unfortunately, a roadblock we cannot compete with.&quot; At the 2010 TCA Winter Press Tour, Rob Thomas stated that the movie wouldn&#x27;t be happening, &quot;I would write it if anyone would finance it. If anyone&#x27;s interested in making that movie, I am available, Kristen&#x27;s [Bell] available. I would love to do it. I think the closest we came was Joel [Silver] pushing it at Warner Bros., and they didn&#x27;t bite. It has sort of gone away.&quot; In April 2010, Thomas insisted, &quot;it&#x27;s not dead. I continue to want to do it [...] We&#x27;re still looking into it.&quot; In June 2010, Silver was less optimistic about the film happening; &quot;we analyzed all these areas about it. I talked to the home video people because a movie like that would be driven by video. The [season DVDs] didn&#x27;t do that well... So they didn&#x27;t feel there was a need or an audience.&quot;

===Kickstarter project===

On March 13, 2013, Rob Thomas and Kristen Bell launched a Kickstarter fundraiser in an attempt to get the film made, with the help of fans to reach the goal of $2 million. The campaign offered various incentives to those who donated more than $10. Thomas and Bell stated that they approached Warner Bros. with the idea and they approved and will be distributing the finished title. Bell, Thomas, Enrico Colantoni, Ryan Hansen, and Jason Dohring appeared in a video promoting the campaign that was shot in February 2012. The goal was met within 10 hours of the start of the campaign. The project broke several Kickstarter records, becoming the site&#x27;s largest successful film project. The campaign ended on April 13, with 91,585 donors raising $5,702,153. Production began in June 2013, with a projected early 2014 release. In December 2013, Thomas announced that the release date would be March 14, 2014, a year and a day after the start of the Kickstarter project.

On April 5, Thomas had completed the first draft of the script. Several casting announcements were made through April to June, with confirmation of several returning cast members, including Jason Dohring (Logan Echolls), Enrico Colantoni (Keith Mars), Percy Daggs III (Wallace Fennel), Chris Lowell (Stosh &quot;Piz&quot; Piznarski), Francis Capra (Eli &quot;Weevil&quot; Navarro), Ryan Hansen (Dick Casablancas), and Tina Majorino (Cindy &quot;Mac&quot; Mackenzie), among several others.

The film had its world premiere at the South by Southwest film festival on March 8, 2014, and was released in theatres and through online platforms on March 14, 2014. The film grossed $3.5 million worldwide, and received positive reviews from critics, with a 79% approval rating on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews from 125 critics, with an average score of 6.7 out of 10.

===Revival series===

In September 2018, Hulu officially confirmed the revival of &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, and announced it would consist of eight episodes, and series creator Rob Thomas and Kristen Bell were confirmed to return. The plot revolves around a serial killer murdering spring breakers. Other returning cast members include Jason Dohring (Logan Echolls), Enrico Colantoni (Keith Mars), Percy Daggs III (Wallace Fennel), Francis Capra (Eli &quot;Weevil&quot; Navarro), Ryan Hansen (Dick Casablancas), and several others. New cast members include Dawnn Lewis, Patton Oswalt, Clifton Collins Jr., and J. K. Simmons. It was originally scheduled for release on July 26, 2019; however, Hulu released the season one week early on July 19 shortly after the series&#x27; appearance at San Diego Comic-Con.

== Other media ==

=== Novels ===
A series of novels, written by series creator Rob Thomas and Jennifer Graham, continue the story after the events of the &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; film and also feature Logan, Mac, Wallace, and Dick. The first novel, &quot;Veronica Mars: The Thousand Dollar Tan Line&quot;, was released by Random House on March 25, 2014, as a Vintage Books trade paperback (), an eBook (), and an unabridged audiobook read by Kristen Bell (). It featured the return of Veronica&#x27;s mother, Lianne Mars. The second novel, &quot;Veronica Mars: Mr. Kiss and Tell&quot;, also published by Vintage Books, was released on January 20, 2015. Thomas has said in interviews that the novels are canon, and would not be negated by a future film.

=== Web spin-off ===

In January 2014, it was announced that a digital spin-off of &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; was in development with creator Rob Thomas. The metafictional concept features Ryan Hansen portraying himself in an attempt to make a spin-off based on his character Dick Casablancas. On August 13, 2014, it was announced that the web series, titled &quot;Play It Again, Dick&quot;, would premiere on September 18, 2014 on The CW&#x27;s digital content website, CW Seed in 8-episode installments with a length of 8–10 minutes per installment. Other cast members returning include Kristen Bell, Jason Dohring, Enrico Colantoni, Percy Daggs III, Daran Norris, Francis Capra, Chris Lowell and Ken Marino, who portrayed their &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; characters as well as fictionalized versions of themselves.

==Reception==

===Ratings===
Below, &quot;rank&quot; refers to how well &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; rated compared to other television series which aired during primetime hours of the corresponding television season. The television season begins in September of any given year and ends during the May of the following year. &quot;Viewers&quot; refers to the average number of viewers for all original episodes broadcast during the television season in the series&#x27; regular timeslot. &quot;Rank&quot; is shown with the total number of series airing on the six/five major English-language networks in a given season. The &quot;season premiere&quot; is the date that the first episode of the season aired. Similarly, the &quot;season finale&quot; is the date that the final episode of the season aired.

===Critical reception===
Although not a ratings success, the series was a critical success from its first season. Robert Abele of &quot;LA Weekly&quot; said &quot;in this smart, engaging series about a former popular girl turned crime-solving high school outcast, the hard-boiled dialogue comes from its teen protagonist&#x27;s mouth in a way that stabs any potential cutesiness in the heart with an ice pick.&quot; In her review, Paige Wiser of the &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot; said that &quot;on &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, wholesome is out; gritty reality is in. The show never soft-pedals the timeless, fundamental truth that high school is hell.&quot; Joyce Millman of &quot;The Phoenix&quot; felt that the series was &quot;a character study masquerading as a high-school drama&quot;. Joy Press of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; saw the series as &quot;a sharp teen noir in the making. Tinged with class resentment and nostalgia for Veronica&#x27;s lost innocence, this series pulses with promise.&quot; Michael Abernethy of PopMatters said that &quot;intrigue, drama, and humor, &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; is also a lesson book for the disenfranchised. Few TV series aim so high; even fewer succeed so well.&quot; James Poniewozik of &quot;Time&quot; labeled it as one of the six best dramas on television. He praised Bell as &quot;a captivating star&quot;, and said that the series &quot;uses its pulp premise to dramatize a universal teen experience: that growing up means sleuthing out the mystery of who you really are.&quot; Kay McFadden of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; called the series an update to the &quot;classic California film noir&quot;. She felt that &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; was the best new series on UPN, and that the title character was potentially &quot;this season&#x27;s most interesting character creation&quot;. McFadden described the series as &quot;&quot;Alias&quot; in its attitude, Raymond Chandler in its writing and &quot;The O.C.&quot; in its class-consciousness.&quot; Stephanie Zacharek of &quot;Salon&quot; praised the first-season finale for being &quot;just the sort of satisfying capper you look for in a series that, week after week, keeps you asking questions.&quot;

&quot;Veronica Mars&quot; was also positively received by other writers. Joss Whedon, who made a guest appearance in the second-season episode &quot;Rat Saw God&quot;, said that it was the &quot;Best. Show. Ever. Seriously, I&#x27;ve never gotten more wrapped up in a show I wasn&#x27;t making, and maybe even more than those [...] These guys know what they&#x27;re doing on a level that intimidates me. It&#x27;s the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; of shows.&quot; Kevin Smith, who guest starred in the episode &quot;Driver Ed&quot;, said that &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; was &quot;hands-down, the best show on television right now, and proof that TV can be far better than cinema.&quot; Stephen King described the series as &quot;Nancy Drew meets Philip Marlowe, and the result is pure nitro. Why is &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; so good? It bears little resemblance to life as I know it, but I can&#x27;t take my eyes off the damn thing.&quot; Ed Brubaker called it &quot;the best mystery show ever made in America.&quot;

Despite being a critical success throughout its run, criticisms began to emerge in its third season. Keith McDuffee of TV Squad described the third season as &quot;disappointing,&quot; mainly because the episodes offered nothing new: &quot;most fans of &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; felt that season three was clearly its weakest.&quot; Eric Goldman of IGN said that the main issue was the shift in the overall tone, with a lighter feeling than the previous seasons. He felt that Logan had been most affected by the tone change, robbed of his darker aspects, and changed into an &quot;increasingly extraneous character.&quot; Goldman felt that despite the concerns over the final five episodes, the series ended with &quot;three very strong episodes, with lots of strong dialogue and Veronica proving again just how tough she can be, and what a strong character she is.&quot; Goldman concluded that although the third season &quot;was very choppy,&quot; it still had &quot;plenty of witty dialogue and a continually engaging performance by Kristen Bell as the title character.&quot; The &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; opined that &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; had taken a dive &quot;creatively&quot;, from &quot;the mopier version of its theme song to stalled storylines.&quot; The reviewer felt that &quot;the arcing mysteries had grown less convincing and compelling as time went on and were too drawn out.&quot; Fox News Channel&#x27;s Bridget Byrne pointed out that Veronica had &quot;gone from punky to—dare we say—preppy&quot; in the third season. Byrne further explained that &quot;with her quick, bright wit and sharp eye for life&#x27;s darker moments [Veronica] has left high school and is going to college, doffing her dark threads and spiked tresses for something a little more stylish.&quot;

The series, described as a &quot;critical darling&quot;, appeared on a number of fall television best lists. In 2005, the series was featured on AFI&#x27;s TV Programs of the Year, and on the lists of MSN TV, &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;People Weekly&quot; and the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot;. It was named the second best series by Ain&#x27;t It Cool News, fourth best returning series by &quot;Time&quot;, fifth best series by &quot;Newsday&quot;, PopMatters and &quot;San Jose Mercury-News&quot;, and sixth best by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; and &quot;USA Today&quot;. In 2006, the series was ranked number one on the lists of Ain&#x27;t It Cool News and the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, and was ranked number six by Metacritic. In 2007, the series ranked number 18 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s list of the &quot;Top Cult Shows Ever&quot;. In 2008, AOL TV ranked &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; the 10th Best School Show of All Time. The same year, British film magazine &quot;Empire&quot; ranked it number 48 in their list of the &quot;50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time&quot;. The magazine said that &quot;smart storylines and witty riffs on pop culture pepper the scripts, while Kristen Bell lent ballsy charm to the title role and ensured that every episode of the show&#x27;s three seasons was television gold. Its untimely cancellation was a slap in the face that still smarts to this day.&quot; &quot;Empire&quot; named &quot;Not Pictured&quot; the best episode of the series. In 2010, Kristin dos Santos of E! ranked &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; number 8 on her list, &quot;Top 20 TV Series of the Past 20 Years&quot;. The A.V. Club named it the 15th best TV series of the 2000s (decade).

In 2012, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; listed the show at #13 in the &quot;25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25 Years&quot;, with the comments, &quot;It&#x27;s not easy telling the story of a girl&#x27;s mission to solve her best friend&#x27;s murder – while also investigating her own rape – but creator Rob Thomas&#x27; tough assignment was made easier by putting the tirelessly smart and snarky Veronica Mars on the case. Her wry one-liners injected much-needed lightness into sometimes grim mysteries.&quot;

In 2020, Briana Kranich of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; as the top contender of &quot;The 10 Best TV Teen Heroines&quot;.

===Fandom===
&quot;Veronica Mars&quot; has attracted a loyal and dedicated fan base. A group of fans calling themselves the &quot;Cloud Watchers&quot; organized several campaigns to bring more viewers to the series to ensure its continuation. The group hired a plane to fly over the CW offices, carrying a banner reading &quot;Renew &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;.&quot; The group hired street teams in New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Chicago to distribute 30,000 fliers advertising the series&#x27; return after its midseason hiatus in the third season. The &quot;Cloud Watchers&quot; raised $50,000 in donations and through the sale of &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; clothing and tchotchkes. Upon the cancellation of the series, fans sent more than 10,000 Mars Bars to the CW, hoping that the network would reverse its decision and renew the series. Rob Thomas thanked the fans of the series for their efforts, saying, &quot;I love those people, and they have been so good to me, but it&#x27;s not going to happen.&quot; A feature film continuation was made possible in 2013 through a Kickstarter fund, in which 91,585 fans donated $5,702,153 to get the film made. Fans have also come to refer to themselves and be referred to as &quot;Marshmallows&quot; by media as well as the cast and crew of the series after a line delivered by Wallace (Percy Daggs III) in the pilot episode: &quot;You&#x27;re a marshmallow, Veronica Mars. A Twinkie.&quot; At the end of the same episode, Veronica in voiceover remarks &quot;Well, you know what they say: &#x27;Veronica Mars, she&#x27;s a marshmallow.&#x27;&quot; A reference to the term was also included in the fan-funded film.

<doc id="1025034" wikidata="Q48327414" url="?curid=1025034" title="Dakuten and handakuten">
<text>The , colloquially , is a diacritic most often used in the Japanese kana syllabaries to indicate that the consonant of a mora should be pronounced voiced, for instance, on sounds that have undergone rendaku (sequential voicing).

The , colloquially , is a diacritic used with kana for morae pronounced with or to indicate that they should instead be pronounced with .

==Glyphs==
The &quot;dakuten&quot; resembles a quotation mark, while the &quot;handakuten&quot; is a small circle, similar to a degree sign, both placed at the top right corner of a kana character:
* 
* 
* 

Both the &quot;dakuten&quot; and &quot;handakuten&quot; glyphs are drawn identically in hiragana and katakana scripts. The combining characters are rarely used in full-width Japanese characters, as Unicode and all common multibyte Japanese encodings provide precomposed glyphs for all possible &quot;dakuten&quot; and &quot;handakuten&quot; character combinations in the standard hiragana and katakana ranges. However, combining characters are required in half-width kana, which does not provide any precomposed characters in order to fit within a single byte.

The similarity between the &quot;dakuten&quot; and quotation marks (&quot;) is not a problem, as written Japanese uses corner brackets (「」).

==Phonetic shifts==
The following table summarizes the phonetic shifts indicated by the &quot;dakuten&quot; and &quot;handakuten&quot;. Literally, morae with &quot;dakuten&quot; are , while those without are . However, the &quot;handakuten&quot; (lit. &quot;half-muddy mark&quot;) does not follow this pattern.

(Yellow shading indicates non-standard use.)

Handakuten on &quot;ka&quot;, &quot;ki&quot;, &quot;ku&quot;, &quot;ke&quot;, &quot;ko&quot; (rendered as ) represent the sound of &quot;ng&quot; in &quot;singing&quot; (), which is an allophone of in many dialects of Japanese. They are not used in normal Japanese writing, but may be used by linguists and in dictionaries (or to represent characters in fiction who speak that way). This is called &quot;&quot; . Another rare application of &quot;handakuten&quot; is on the &quot;r&quot;-series, to mark them as explicitly &quot;l&quot;: , and so forth. This is only done in technical or pedantic contexts, as many Japanese speakers cannot tell the difference between &quot;r&quot; and &quot;l&quot;. Additionally, linguists sometimes use to represent in cases when speaker pronounces at the beginning of a word as a moraic nasal.

In katakana only, the &quot;dakuten&quot; may also be added to the character &quot;u&quot; and a small vowel character to create a sound, as in ヴァ &quot;va&quot;. However, a hiragana version of this character also exists, with somewhat sporadic compatibility across platforms (). As does not exist in Japanese, this usage applies only to some modern loanwords and remains relatively uncommon, and e.g. Venus is typically transliterated as (&quot;bīnasu&quot;) instead of (&quot;vīnasu&quot;). Japanese speakers, however, pronounce both the same, with or , an occasional allophone of intervocalic .

An even less common method is to add &quot;dakuten&quot; to the &quot;w&quot;-series, reviving the mostly obsolete characters for () and (). is represented by using /u/, as above; becomes despite its normally being silent. Precomposed characters exist for this method as well ( ), although most IMEs do not have a convenient way to enter them.

In Ainu texts, handakuten can be used with the katakana to make it a /t͡s/ sound, &quot;ce&quot; [t͡se] (which is interchangeable with ), and is used with small &quot;fu&quot; to represent a final &quot;p&quot;, . In addition, handakuten can be combined with either katakana or (&quot;tsu&quot; and &quot;to&quot;) to make a [tu̜] sound, or .

In Miyakoan, handakuten can be used with (normally [i]) to represent the vowel .

In informal writing, &quot;dakuten&quot; is occasionally used on vowels to indicate a shocked or strangled articulation; for example, on or . &quot;Dakuten&quot; can also be occasionally used with to indicate a guttural hum, growl, or similar sound.

===Kana iteration marks===
The &quot;dakuten&quot; can also be added to hiragana and katakana iteration marks, indicating that the previous kana is repeated with voicing:
Both signs are relatively rare, but can occasionally be found in personal names such as &quot;Misuzu&quot; () or brand names such as &quot;Isuzu&quot; (いすゞ). In these cases the pronunciation is identical to writing the kana out in full. A longer, multi-character iteration mark called the &quot;kunojiten&quot; (), only used in vertical writing, may also have a &quot;dakuten&quot; added ().

==Other communicative representations==
*Representations of Dakuten
*Representations of Handakuten
 Voiced morae and semi-voiced morae do not have independent names in radiotelephony and are signified by the unvoiced name followed by &quot;ni dakuten&quot; or &quot;ni handakuten&quot;.

* Full Braille representation
==Origin==
The &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot; pronunciation of the character (&quot;daku&quot; in &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot;) is &quot;nigori&quot;; hence the &quot;dakuten&quot; may also be called the nigori-ten. This character, meaning &quot;muddy&quot;, stems from historical Chinese phonology, where consonants were traditionally classified as &quot;fully clear&quot; (, voiceless unaspirated obstruent), &quot;partly clear&quot; (, voiceless aspirated obstruent), &quot;fully muddy&quot; (, voiced obstruent) and &quot;partly muddy&quot; (, voiced sonorant) (see Middle Chinese § Initials and ). Unlike in Chinese where &quot;clear&quot; and &quot;muddy&quot; were phonological, in Japanese, these terms are purely orthographic: a is simply a kana with a &quot;muddy mark&quot;, or a &quot;dakuten&quot;; a or is simply a kana with a &quot;half muddy mark&quot;, or a &quot;handakuten&quot;; a is any other kana without either of these marks. In fact, the &quot;partly clear/half muddy&quot; consonant in Japanese would be considered &quot;fully clear&quot; in Chinese, while &quot;clear&quot; Japanese consonants such as , , , and would be &quot;partly muddy&quot; in Chinese. Meiji-era descriptions of the Japanese &quot;sound&quot; system (either the actual phonology, or the orthography) in terms of &quot;clear&quot; and &quot;muddy&quot; always referenced the kana spelling and the two diacritics &quot;dakuten&quot; and &quot;handakuten&quot;.

The earliest attested use of &quot;muddy&quot; diacritics was from the late ninth century. One of such diacritics was a superscript version of the radical from the &quot;muddy&quot; character , as in (&quot;ba&quot; rather than &quot;pa&quot;). The modern &quot;dakuten&quot; appears to have come from Chinese tone diacritics. In some documents, one dot marked pitch on a &quot;clear sound,&quot; while two dots marked pitch on a &quot;muddy sound.&quot; Another source was the Siddhaṃ nasality diacritic anusvāra through Buddhist sources. In Japanese writing, it was adapted into a dot placed at the top-right corner of a character to denote the &quot;muddiness&quot; or nasality of consonants, as well as of the nasalized vowels and  adapted from the Chinese . The use of the anusvāra suggests prenasalization in early voiced consonants.

The &quot;handakuten&quot; is an innovation by Portuguese Jesuits, who first used it in the &quot;Rakuyōshū&quot;, to accurately transcribe the consonant and its lenited form , which had not been distinguished in domestic writing.

== History ==
The history of Khurja pottery goes back to around 14th century, when some retreating (wounded) soldiers and commanders from Timur&#x27;s army decided to remain. They had officially established Khurja as a town. These men were mainly from the imperial Kheshgi Dynasty of the Mughal Empire, descendants of the Kheshigs, who were senior officials throughout the Empire.

A number of these soldiers were potters and they brought this craft with them. Starting with red clay pottery they moved on to blue glaze and on red clay articles with a white engobe, painted floral designs with cupric oxide and applying a soft glaze containing glass and borax etc.

During World War II, ban was imposed on various metals for making household utensils and import of ceramic goods was drastically curtailed. To meet the demand of ceramic wares mainly for war hospitals, the Government of Uttar Pradesh established a ceramic unit. After the war, the factory was closed in 1946 due to lack of demand of its products. The factory was equipped with three small kilns, two chimneys and three ball mills. Instead of closing the factory completely the Government of Uttar Pradesh converted it into a Pottery Development Centre.

== Industry ==

The development activities of U.P. Small Industrial Corporation Ltd. resulted in setting up of UPSIC Potteries Ltd. in 1976–77. There was a widespread complaint about the efficiency of the UPSIC Potteries Ltd., primarily because of high costs. The Government of Uttar Pradesh set up a panel in Nov.1990 to examine the working of the corporation and to consider the proposal of the passing of the commercial activities back to the Pottery Development Centre (Local Office of Directorate of fisheries.)

Though an industrial region, Khurja lacks the infrastructure for good industry by European standards. Since there are often power cuts lasting around eight hours, all factories and most homes have private generators. The municipality water supply is insufficient or everybody&#x27;s need so many have water pumps to extract groundwater.

== Markets and fairs ==

Khurja is a small town, with shops open until 21:00 in the Bindawala Chowk and Tareenan. There are many small markets which are important for the residents. Some markets are: Anaj mandi, Bindawala Chawk, Sabzi Mandi (town&#x27;s biggest and main Vegetable Market), subhash road, Shaheed Dataram marg, Gandhi Road, Raniwala Chawk, Kabadi Bazar (timber and hardware market), Jewar Adda, Moodha-Kheda, Bajaja Bazar (town&#x27;s biggest textile market), Nayi Basti, Shaheed Dataram Chowk, Bus Adda (Bus Terminus) etc. The city has a cyber market called Sri Ram Complex, near NREC Degree College.

The weekly market called &quot;Budh Bazar&quot; or The Wednesday Market is popular, There is Sunday(Itwaar Bazar) market also on Navalty Road and the surrounding area is closed to traffic to become a pedestrian zone.

Khurja annually holds a town fair called Ramlila during the festive season of Diwali which goes through the whole festive season and each day of the festival there is theatrical portrayal of the religious stories by various drama groups along with the town&#x27;s biggest fair, the location of this fair is called the &quot;Panchvati&quot; which is mainly a group of agricultural farms which is transformed into the fair ground during the season. The second biggest annual fair of Khurja is held during the Hindu festival of Navratri after the establishment of a new temple &quot;Nav Durga Shakti Mandir&quot;.

== Heritage buildings ==

(Devi mandir)
Khurja has a beautiful countryside with old buildings and houses along the road. You can find houses more than 100 years old in many parts of the town which are considered as the heritage of the town but now are the victims of negligence. Some of the famous buildings are: &quot;Lala Mewaram ka Kamra&quot; (the room of Mr. Mewaram, is taken over by some residents), &quot;Seth Gangaram Bhawan&quot; (which now has been converted into a banquet hall), the building of J.A.S. Inter college is also said to be a piece of art and Diwan JI Ka Mandir Near by Padam Singh gate it is very old Temple like 100-150 year old.

== Khurja Super Thermal Power Project ==
Towards diversification of the company into other energy sectors, THDCIL has entered into a MoU on 31 December 2010 with Govt. of U.P and UPPCL for setting up 2 x 660 MW Super critical Thermal Power Project in Tehsil Khurja, District Bulandshahar, U.P. About 1,200 acres of land was acquired by UPSIDC earlier at Khurja for industrial use which shall be utilized for construction of the project. As per MOU, GoUP / UPPCL will assist in transfer of this land.

== Khurja Logistic Park ==

Khurja is a meeting point of eastern and western dedicated freight rail corridor. Arshiya International Ltd&#x27;s upcoming FTWZ (Free Trade and Warehousing Zone) in Khurja is strategically located connecting the Western and Eastern freight corridors with the manufacturing hub of India in the NCR. These special zones offer customized warehousing facilities to help add value or store, before organized shipment. As part of a fully integrated infrastructure, Arshiya plans to additionally invest in creating a dedicated Rail Terminal with the FTWZ in Khurja that would allow pan-India connections for its customers through its Rail Infrastructure service.

== Transport ==

Khurja being a significant town is linked by rail on the Delhi – Calcutta line and via the old GT Road to many major cities in India. There are two train stations, Khurja Junction which is on the main Delhi – Kolkata line and Khurja City which serves to district headquarter Bulandshahr &amp; Meerut.

Khurja can be reached by road or train. A drive from Delhi on a direct route has heavy traffic and takes about two and a half hours. Time can be saved by taking the expressway from Delhi to Noida, then the Dankaur station road to Sikandrabad, which is 37 km from Khurja.

Khurja has three bus terminals: Bus Adda; which is the main bus terminus, Jewar Adda; the second terminus and Pahansu Adda; the third terminus. The latter 2 terminals are named after their locations and the routes of buses which they provide. Apart from these Bus terminals, this town has two railways stations one of which is the Khurja Junction (the main station linking Khurja with the major routes of the country) and the other is called Khurja City(a station established for most of the local routes to take off the rail traffic from the main junction).

<text>Jabiru Aircraft Pty Ltd is an Australian aircraft manufacturer that produces a range of kit- and ready-built civil light aircraft in Bundaberg, Queensland. The company also designs and manufactures a range of light aircraft engines. Types past and present include microlights (Ultralight or ULM), including the &quot;Calypso&quot;, two-seat trainers and recreational aircraft (J120/J160/ J170/J230) and four-seat aircraft (J400/J430/J450).

The aircraft are built largely of composite materials and are conventional high-wing monoplanes with typically tricycle undercarriage. Taildragger versions were produced in the early days of Jabiru. The wings could be removed for ease of storage or transportation.

Use of modern composite techniques has resulted in a strong yet light structure. The aircraft are designed around the pilot and passengers, being spacious and comfortable for touring, yet with a small footprint and frontal profile. Controls include a centrally mounted control column, brake and trim lever.

There is also a Jabiru assembly facility in George, Western Cape, South Africa.

==History==



The company was formed in 1988 by Rodney Stiff and Phil Ainsworth to manufacture affordable light aircraft in kit and certified forms.

In October 1991, the first aircraft (Jabiru LSA 55/2k), was certified by the Australian Civil Aviation Authority.

Due to the original engine manufacturer, Italian American Motor Engineering ceasing production of the KFM 112M aero engines, the company started development of its own engines, and by 1995 the Jabiru 2200, a horizontally opposed four-cylinder air-cooled aviation engine, was available for delivery. Since then the six-cylinder Jabiru 3300 and eight-cylinder Jabiru 5100 have been added to the range.

Also in 1995, it was decided to offer the aircraft range as amateur-build or experimental self-build kits.

The microlight version of the Jabiru two-seater aircraft, the Jabiru UL, holds two world speed records for three-axis microlight aircraft. These were set over 50- and 100-kilometre predefined courses and certified by the FAI (Fédération Aéronautique Internationale).

==Engines==
Jabiru produces its own range of lightweight, four-stroke, horizontally opposed, air-cooled engines, specifically designed and engineered for use in aircraft. All engines are direct drive and are fitted with alternators, mufflers, and dual ignition systems as standard. Over 3,900 four-cylinder engines and over 2,900 of the six-cylinder engines have been produced.

=== Early Models ===

*Jabiru 1600; four-cylinder horizontally opposed engine
*Jabiru 5100; eight-cylinder horizontally opposed engine

=== Current Models ===

*Jabiru 2200; or four-cylinder horizontally opposed engine
*Jabiru 3300; six-cylinder horizontally opposed engine

In November 2014, the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) required passengers to sign an acknowledgement of risk before flying, and restricted IFR-equipped aircraft to day VFR flight within gliding distance of a safe place to land. In the following two years, CASA inspectors witnessed the tear-downs of failed Jabiru engines and also high-time engines that had not failed. In 2016, this resulted in exemptions to these restrictions for all aircraft that complied with the manufacturer&#x27;s engine maintenance manuals, service letters, bulletins, flight operation manuals and that had no unapproved modifications.

Both the manufacturer and Recreational Aviation Australia (RA-Aus) opposed the restrictions as unnecessary and unwarranted. RA-Aus reported that it was supplied with only a fraction of CASA&#x27;s source data – just a day before submissions closed – and that CASA seemed to have excluded all engine reliability data post-&quot;early 2014&quot;.

<text>Caroline Rémy de Guebhard (27 April 1855 – 24 April 1929) was a French journalist with anarchist, socialist, communist and feminist views, best known under the pen name Séverine. She has been called the first professional journalist in France.

Around 1880, Caroline Rémy became involved with Jules Vallès&#x27; socialist publication, &quot;Cri du Peuple&quot;. Vallès eventually gave her control over the newspaper due to his poor health. Becoming increasingly militant, she befriended journalist and feminist Marguerite Durand but, following a confrontation with the Marxist Jules Guesde, left the newspaper in 1888. She continued writing for other papers in which she promoted women&#x27;s emancipation and denounced social injustices, including the Dreyfus affair. In 1897, she began writing for Durand&#x27;s feminist daily newspaper &quot;La Fronde&quot;.

A staunch leftist, Rémy backed a number of anarchist causes, including the defense of Germaine Berton, and participated in the 1927 efforts to save Sacco and Vanzetti. She supported the Russian Revolution of 1917 and, in 1921, joined the French Communist Party, resigning a few years later in order to maintain her membership of the Human Rights League.

Bernard Lecache, a founding member of the Committee of Honor of International League Against Anti-Semitism (LICA), (now International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism (LICRA)), wrote her biography. Her portrait was painted by Pierre-Auguste Renoir in 1885 and now hangs in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC.
Caroline Rémy died in 1929 at her home in Pierrefonds, Oise department in the Picardy region of France. Some of her papers can be found in the Bibliothèque Marguerite Durand in Paris.

Shortly before her death, she took part in the campaign to support the candidacy of Dr. Albert Besson, who was elected councilor of the district Saint-Fargeau, general counselor of the Seine then deputy chairman of the Council of Paris and the general council of the Seine. In 1933, in her memory, he had the Paris council vote for the attribution of the name &quot;Séverine&quot; to the square created at his initiative Porte de Bagnolet (Paris 20).

She was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1920, 1922, 1924, 1927 and 1929 by Lucien Le Foyer.

<text>Far infrared (FIR) or long wave refers to a specific range within the infrared spectrum of electromagnetic radiation. It encompasses radiation with wavelengths ranging from 15 μm (micrometers) to 1 mm, which corresponds to a frequency range of approximately 20 THz to 300 GHz. This places far infrared radiation within the CIE IR-B and IR-C bands. The longer wavelengths of the FIR spectrum overlap with a range known as terahertz radiation. Different sources may use different boundaries to define the far infrared range. For instance, astronomers often define it as wavelengths between 25 μm and 350 μm. Infrared photons possess significantly lower energy than photons in the visible light spectrum, with tens to hundreds of times less energy.

==Applications==

===Astronomy===

Objects within a temperature range of approximately 5 K to 340 K emit radiation in the far infrared range as a result of black-body radiation, in accordance with Wien&#x27;s displacement law. This characteristic is utilized in the observation of interstellar gases, which are frequently associated with the formation of new stars.

The brightness observed in far infrared images of the center of the Milky Way galaxy arises from the high density of stars in that region, which heats the surrounding dust and induces radiation emission in the far infrared spectrum. Excluding the center of the Milky Way galaxy, the galaxy M82 is the most prominent far-infrared object in the sky, with its central region emitting amounts of far infrared light equivalent to the combined emissions of all the stars in the Milky Way. , the source responsible for heating the dust at the center of M82 remains unknown.

===Human body detection===

Certain human proximity sensors utilize passive infrared sensing within the far infrared wavelength range to detect the presence of stationary and/or moving human bodies.

=== Heating ===
Infrared heating (IR) is a method of heating an area through more efficient results than gas or electric convection heating. Studies show IR heats faster, more uniformly, and more efficiently than a traditional conventional system. Increasingly, IR heating is utilised as part of scheme designs to achieve spot, zonal and smart heating within occupation zones within a building. Though multiple applications of long wave or FIR heating exist, a common representation comprises radiant panel heaters. Radiant panel heaters typically contain a grid of resistance wire or ribbons which are sandwiched between a thin plate of electrical insulation on an emitting die and thermal insulation on the back side. Owing to their size and flexibility, infrared panel heaters can be fitted on walls and ceilings for added-space saving benefits. Electric FIR panel heaters are shown to have up to 98.5% efficiency from supply to production of heat with satisfactory thermal comfort, thermostatic control, and with low initial investment.

===Therapeutic modality===

Researchers have observed that among all forms of radiant heat, only far-infrared radiation transfers energy solely in the form of heat that can be sensed by the human body. They have found that this type of radiant heat can penetrate the skin up to a depth of approximately . In the field of biomedicine, experiments have been conducted using fabrics woven with FIR-emitting ceramics embedded in their fibers. These studies have indicated a potential delay in the onset of fatigue induced by muscle contractions in participants. The researchers have suggested that the emission of far-infrared radiation by these ceramics (referred to as cFIR) could facilitate cellular repair.

Certain heating pads have been marketed to provide &quot;far infrared&quot; therapy, which is claimed to offer deeper penetration. However, the infrared radiation emitted by an object is determined by its temperature. Therefore, all heating pads emit the same type of infrared radiation if they are at the same temperature. Higher temperatures will result in greater infrared radiation, but caution must be exercised to avoid burns.

<doc id="1025070" wikidata="Q3336921" url="?curid=1025070" title="National Ploughing Championships">
<text>The National Ploughing Championships () or NPC or the Ploughing, previously known as The National Ploughing Championships Machinery &amp; Livestock Exhibition, is an outdoor agricultural show in Ireland incorporating a ploughing contest. Held every September, it draws over 1,700 exhibitors and had 297,000 visitors in 2019.

==Competition classes==
There are distinct categories of horse drawn and tractor ploughing, as well as for the use of reversible ploughs.

Ancillary events such as pole climbing competitions have also taken place as part of the Championships.

==History==
The first Irish inter-county ploughing contest was held between County Wexford and County Kildare on 16 February 1931 in a 26-acre field at Coursetown in Athy in County Kildare. Since then, the National Ploughing Championships has expanded to over 800 acres with 1,700 exhibitors. It has been extended beyond displays relating to ploughing, farming and machinery and now includes a tented trade village, live entertainment and music, fashion shows, a craft village, cooking demonstrations, sheep dog trials, pony games and other activities.

In 2014, the event attracted what was then a record of 279,500 visitors, rising to 281,000 in 2015, 283,000 in 2016 and 291,500 in 2017.

===Foundation===
The original mission statement for the National Ploughing Association, the body which organises the event, was set out as bringing &quot;the message of good ploughing to all parts of the country and to provide a pleasant and friendly place to meet and do business&quot;.

One of the co-founders of the Association, JJ Bergin, became its first managing director. In 1952, he represented Ireland at the first meeting of the World Ploughing Organisation (WPO) and was appointed their vice president. The first world contest was hosted by Canada in 1953, and the second was in Killarney, County Kerry, Ireland in 1954. Ten countries competed in the 1954 event, which was the first ploughing competition in which women competed. The winner of this &#x27;Farmerette&#x27; class was known as &#x27;Queen of the Plough&#x27;. In 1955, the National Ploughing Championships expanded into a 2-day event. The association became a limited liability company and was incorporated on 2 March 1956.

JJ Bergin continued to manage NPA until his death in 1958. Upon his death, the NPA appointed hurler Seán O&#x27;Farrell as managing director, a role he held until his death in 1972. A national bread baking competition was introduced by NPA in co-operation with ESB in 1958 that continues to this day. In 1959, O&#x27;Farrell represented the NPA at the 7th World Ploughing Contest to Armoy, County Antrim, Northern Ireland. He later attended the 8th World Ploughing Contest in Tor Mancina, Rome, Italy in 1960, where he presented a block of Kilkenny Marble as Ireland&#x27;s contribution to Rome&#x27;s &#x27;Cairn of Peace&#x27;. During O&#x27;Farrell&#x27;s tenure in office, he representing Ireland at the 9th (1961) World Ploughing Contest, at Thiverval-Grignon in France. He was officially introduced to President of the French Republic, Charles De Gaulle. Also in 1961, the Ploughing Championships (at Killarney) were filmed for the first time by RTÉ. It was filmed on 8 and 9 November 1961 and broadcast in the first ever episode of the farming programme &#x27;On the Land&#x27;, on 1 January 1962. The film was notable in that it was broadcast the day after Teilifís Éireann first went on air.

In 1964, the NPA sent two competitors to Fuchsenbigl, near Vienna, Austria, where Ireland won their first World Title when Charlie Keegan, from County Wicklow, was the winner. Arriving home from the world contest in Vienna, the Wicklow man was welcomed home to Enniskerry, County Wicklow on an open top bus and met by bonfires along the roadside as they greeted NPA&#x27;s first World Ploughing Champion. The Irish Times reported how the tractor on which Charlie Keegan won World Ploughing Championships in 1964 had now been restored. It was a green Deutz D40L tractor that was restored to its original condition by his grandson.

At the National Championships 1964, a new Youth class was introduced for Youths 21–28. In 1965 Esso became an NPA sponsor and introduced the Esso Supreme Trophy which is still presented to the Senior Conventional Champion annually. In 1966, a new competition was introduced to cater for students from the agricultural colleges. In 1969, the Irish Countrywomen&#x27;s Association (ICA) were invited to give demonstrations in cookery and crafts. O&#x27;Farrell held the position of MD until his death in 1972. The Kilkenny People, in their September 1972 obituary, recorded that he was NPA Managing Director and a member of World Ploughing Organisation and that the graveside oration was delivered by Seán Ó Síocháin, General Secretary of GAA.

===Later years===
In 1973, Anna May McHugh was appointed NPA&#x27;s managing director. McHugh had previously served as secretary of the NPA. In September 2015, National Ploughing Association Managing Director Anna May McHugh was awarded the Officier de l&#x27;Ordre du Mérite Agricole by the French Ambassador to Ireland Mr Jean-Pierre Thébault. McHugh is the Irish board member to the Board of the World Ploughing Organisation, where her daughter, Anna Marie McHugh, is now general secretary.

In 1973, the year of McHugh&#x27;s appointment as managing director, the 20th World Ploughing Contest was held in County Wexford. It was a four-day contest that was attended by 100,000 people, and in which 25 countries took part. Further World Ploughing events have since been held in Ireland with 29th World Ploughing Contest in Wexford in 1981; the 43rd World Ploughing Contest at Oak Park, County Carlow in 1996 and the 53rd World Ploughing Contest at Tullow County Carlow in 2006. In 1994, Martin Kehoe from County Wexford won the first of his three World Champion titles – in 1994 from Outram, near Dunedin, New Zealand; in 1995 from Egerton, Njoro, Kenya and in 1999 from Pomacle, France. The only other Irish World Champion (apart from first winner, Charlie Keegan) was Eamonn Tracey, winning in Saint Jean D&#x27;Illac, France in 2014.

By 2014, the event had become one of the largest outdoor annual events in Europe. NPA records indicate that, in 1975, the number of national exhibitors was 100, the number of counties competing was 21 and the number of demonstrators was 18. By 1978, the championships returned to County Kilkenny - this time to the village where Anna May McHugh&#x27;s predecessor, Seán O&#x27;Farrell, was born, Knocktopher. Attendance figures grew steadily throughout the 1970s and 1980s until 1988, when the event was expanded to 3 days in order to cater for heavy traffic due to escalating attendances. According to NPA records, the Irish Countrywomen&#x27;s Association and Country Markets started giving cookery and craft demonstrations at the shows around this time. Other events added in the 1980s included a fashion show in 1981, shopping and business arcades in 1985 and the &#x27;Nissan Classic&#x27; in 1989.
Between 2000 and 2011, the Ploughing Championships had grown to 180,000 spectators, 320 competitors, 1,100 exhibitors, 14 shopping arcades and was by then generating €10m for the local Irish economy.

As of 2014/2015, the event&#x27;s costs were in the region of €3.5 million, and there were ploughing associations in every county in Ireland.

With an average of 180,000 spectators, the NPA attendance has grown from the 3,000 that attended in 1932 to over 280,000 in the 2010s. Some outlets have described the National Ploughing Championships as a &quot;flagship event in Irish agriculture&quot; and as &quot;the biggest outdoor exhibition and agricultural trade show in Europe&quot;. Despite the size of the events, the NPA remains a voluntary association.

The 2020 event was cancelled as part of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland. The 2021 event went ahead on a much scaled-back level, with the trade exhibition element and the world ploughing contest cancelled due to uncertainty over COVID-19 restrictions. 
The 2022 event returned as normal with a new attendance record of 115,500 on 21 September. In 2023, Macra na Feirme organised a successful world record attempt to throw the most wellies simultaneously.

<doc id="1025093" wikidata="Q657473" url="?curid=1025093" title="Archdemon">
<text>In some occult and similar writings, an archdemon (also spelled archdaemon), archdevil, or archfiend is a spiritual entity prominent in the infernal hierarchy as a leader of demons. Essentially, the archdemons are the evil opponents of the archangels.

==Christian traditions==
Archdemons are described as the leaders of demonic hosts, just as archangels lead choirs of angels. Based upon the writings of Saint Paul (Col. 1:16; Eph. 1:21) the angelic court had been constructed by Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite and comprised nine orders of angels with three orders each to three hierarchies.

The first hierarchy consists of seraphim, cherubim and thrones. The second hierarchy consists of dominations, virtues and powers. The third hierarchy consists of principalities, archangels and angels. This system of classifying angels has been accepted by the majority of Christian scholars. However, no similar consensus has been reached on the 
classification of demons. This is largely due to the fact that, historically, the definition of what an archdemon is and the names of those demons has varied greatly over time.

One common medieval classification associate the seven deadly sins with archdemons:
* Lucifer: Pride
* Mammon: Greed
* Asmodeus: Lust
* Leviathan: Envy
* Beelzebub: Gluttony
* Satan: Wrath
* Belphegor: Sloth

In the occult tradition, there is controversy regarding which demons should be classed as archdemons. During different ages, some demons were historically &quot;promoted&quot; to archdemons, others were completely forgotten, and new ones were created. In ancient Jewish lore, many of the pagan gods of neighboring cultures were identified as extremely pernicious demons in order to prevent Jews from worshiping them.

Therefore, the pagan deity Ba&#x27;al was reinterpreted as the archdemon Bael or Beelzebub, and the pagan deity Astarte was reinterpreted as the archdemon Astaroth. These two in particular were seen as some of the worst enemies of God. By the Middle Ages, these pagan deities were no longer worshiped, so their characterizations as archdemons were no longer important, but they still persisted anyway. New archdemons were invented over time, most of them revolving around Satan and the Antichrist.

==Islamic tradition==

According to Middle Eastern Folkmagic usually, seven kings of the jinn are assigned to each day of the week. Although they can do, unlike the spirits of heavens, both good and evil, they have responsibility given by God regarding the affairs of the earth. In some reports, they are rather infernal demons (&quot;ʻIfrīt&quot;) than explicitly jinn. A hadith from Wahb ibn Munabbih reports that the archetypes of the jinn are like air, differing from the regular jinn, they don&#x27;t need to eat, drink and they do not produce offspring. Since they do not move themselves, they send subordinate devils (&quot;shayāṭīn&quot;). They are mentioned in several Muslim treatises, such as the Book of Wonders. 

The Muslim occultist Ahmad al-Buni sets four of these kings named &quot;Mudhib&quot;, &quot;Maimun&quot;, &quot;Barqan&quot; and &quot;al-Ahmar&quot;, in opposition to the four archangels of Islam. They frequently appear inscribed in talismans. According to Muslim astrology, one needs to get permission of the king of the jinn for the corresponding day to perform a spell. When the jinn-king is summoned together with the name of the angel responsible for the day, it would be impossible for the jinn-king to deny an order of the sorcerer.

According to Mas&#x27;udi&#x27;s &quot;Annals of Time&quot;, four Afarit carry the throne of Iblis, analogue to the Hamlat al Arsh carrying the throne of God.

== Middle Eastern tales ==
In some Middle Eastern legends, an order of nineteen angels of hell exists, each commanding a host of devils. Among them is the Quranic guardian of hell-fire Maalik. Another Quranic member is the fallen angel Iblis, who is also their leader. However, most individual members are not based on the Quran, but integrated to Muslim understanding of sin. One member of the infernal council is responsible for distracting during prayer, one advocates illicit innovations in religious affairs, yet another one incites lust (etc.). These devils are not thought to fulfill the requests of a sorcerer, but serve as means of punishment in the hereafter or as adversaries of the prophet Solomon. According to the corresponding legend, both Solomon and the arch-devils struggle for their reign over the jinn and div.

==Zoroastrianism==
According to Zoroastrian dualism, the world is created by two opposing forces. The &quot;good&quot; deity Ahura Mazda created everything good, but for everything good created Ahriman created an evil opposite. These results in the existence of seven Archdemons, who in return command a countless numbers of demons. These archdemons stay in exact opposition to the Amesha Spenta.

==Demon Kings of the &quot;Ars Goetia&quot;==
&quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot;, an anonymous 17th century grimoire, lists 72 of the most powerful and prominent demons of Hell in its first part, the &quot;Ars Goetia&quot;. Satan himself is not mentioned among them considering his overall dominion of Hell as the &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot;. Below him, the &quot;Ars Goetia&quot; suggests, are the four kings of the cardinal directions who have power over the seventy-two, next the kings, and onward with other demons with lower monarchic titles. The four kings of the cardinal directions are the primary point of contention between different editions and translations, and occultist writers. The common composition of the kings is:

* King of the East: Amaymon
* King of the West: Corson
* King of the North: Ziminiar
* King of the South: Gaap
* King Bael
* King Paimon
* King Beleth
* King Purson
* King Asmodey
* King Viné 
* King Balam
* King Zagan
* King Belial

<text>Macedo do Mato is a civil parish in the municipality (&quot;concelho&quot;) of Bragança, in northern Portugal. The population in 2011 was 208, in an area of 15.54 km².

==History==
There are abundant archaeological vestiges in the parish. The oldest and populous fortification of the region, Cabeço da Terronha, dates from the Iron Age. Its settlement was assisted by the good natural conditions for defense and controlled a geo-strategic position in the region. Artifacts collected from the surface of the site included ceramic fragments.

A Roman funerary complex was located in Sanceriz, with the inscription: &quot;DOCIO SANIGII ANNO / RVM LX&quot;.

Arising between the Roman and prehistoric periods is the prehistoric rock art site at Fonte dos Engaranhados, situated on the southwest flank of the mountain that is now located the sanctuary of Senhora do Aviso. Included in the sites artifacts is a small schist stone with the small carvings of angular and semi-circles.

Sanceriz received a foral (&quot;charter&quot;), that was later renewed on 30 December 1284, from King Manuel of Portugal (sometime in the first quarter of the 15th century).

In the first half of the 19th century, during the Liberal Wars battles occurred between the Liberal and Absolutist. Miguelist forces were pursued until Coitada where, between Macedinho and Bagueixe, they were completely annihilated.

The municipality of Sanceriz was extinguished in 1836. From this point it was integrated into the municipality of Izeda, until 1855, where it was definitively annexed into the municipality of Bragança. Until this period Frieira was the town and seat of the municipal government.

==Geography==
The parish of Macedo do Mato is found in the extreme south of the municipality of Bragança. About from the parish seat, along the limit with the municipality of Macedo de Cavaleiros, is the left margin of the Ribeiro de Vale de Moinhos. Macedo includes several settlements, including Macedo, Frieira and Sanceriz.

<text>Zhytomyr ( ; see below for other names) is a city in the north of the western half of Ukraine. It is the administrative center of Zhytomyr Oblast (province), as well as the administrative center of the surrounding Zhytomyr urban hromada (commune) and Zhytomyr Raion (district). Moreover Zhytomyr consists of two urban districts: Bohunskyi District and Koroliovskyi District (named in honour of Sergey Korolyov). Zhytomyr occupies an area of . Its population is 

Zhytomyr is a major transport hub. The city lies on a historic route linking the city of Kyiv with the west through Brest. Today it links Warsaw with Kyiv, Minsk with Izmail, and several major cities of Ukraine. Zhytomyr was also the location of Ozerne airbase, a key Cold War strategic aircraft base southeast of the city.

Important economic activities of Zhytomyr include lumber milling, food processing, granite quarrying, metalworking, and the manufacture of musical instruments.

Zhytomyr Oblast is the main center of the Polish minority in Ukraine, and in the city itself there is a Latin Catholic cathedral and large Roman Catholic Polish cemetery, founded in 1800. It is regarded as the third biggest Polish cemetery outside Poland, after the Lychakivskiy Cemetery in Lviv and Rasos Cemetery in Vilnius.

== Names ==
The city of Zhytomyr is also historically known by different names in other languages – ; ; ; .

== History ==

Legend holds that Zhytomyr was established about 884 by Zhytomyr, prince of a Slavic tribe of Drevlians. This date, 884, is cut into a large stone of the ice age times, standing on the hill where Zhytomyr was founded. Zhytomyr was one of the prominent cities of Kievan Rus&#x27;. The first records of the town date from 1240, when it was sacked by the Mongol hordes of Batu Khan.

In 1320 Zhytomyr was captured by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and received Magdeburg rights in 1444. After the Union of Lublin (1569) the city was incorporated into the Crown of the Polish Kingdom and in 1667, following the Treaty of Andrusovo, it became the capital of the Kiev Voivodeship. In the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 it passed to Imperial Russia and became the capital of the Volhynian Governorate.

Following the Union of Lublin, Zhytomyr became an important center of local administration, seat of the starosta, and capital of Zhytomyr County. Here, sejmiks of Kiev Voivodeship took place. In 1572, the town had 142 buildings, a manor house of the starosta and a castle. Following the privilege of King Sigismund III Vasa, Zhytomyr had the right for two fairs a year.

During Khmelnytsky Uprising (1648) Zhytomyr was incorporated into Cossack Hetmanate state.

In 1667, Zhytomyr became capital of Kiev Voivodeship, and in 1724, a Jesuit school and monastery were opened here. By 1765, Zhytomyr had five churches, including 3 Roman Catholic and 2 Orthodox, and 285 houses.

In 1793 Zhytomyr was incorporated into the Russian Empire, and in 1804 was named capital of the Volhynian Governorate.

During a period of Ukrainian independence (1917-1920) in 1918, the city was the national capital of Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic for a few weeks. Ultimately, the Ukrainian fight for independence failed and Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic became occupied by Soviet Union. A new Soviet Ukraine state was formed under Soviet rule - Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. From 1920 Zhytomyr was a part of Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.

Due to one of Stalin&#x27;s 5-year plans, the city suffered from the man-made famine Holodomor of 1932-1933. In 2008, the National Museum of the Holodomor Genocide published the National Book of Memory of the Victims of the Holodomor of 1932–1933 in Ukraine. Zhytomyr region - Zhytomyr. The book has 1116 pages and consists of three sections. According to historical records, more than 8015 people died during Holodomor in 1932–1933.

During World War II Zhytomyr and the surrounding territory was, for two and a half years (first from 9 July 1941 to 12 November 1943, and again from 19 November 1943 to 31 December 1943) under Nazi German occupation and was Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s Ukrainian headquarters. The Nazi regime in what they called the &quot;Zhytomyr General District&quot; became what historian Wendy Lower describes asa laboratory for… Himmler&#x27;s resettlement activists… the elimination of the Jews and German colonization of the East—transformed the landscape and devastated the population to an extent that was not experienced in other parts of Nazi-occupied Europe besides Poland. [While]… [u]ltimately, the exigencies of the war effort and mounting partisan warfare behind the lines prevented Nazi leaders from fully developing and realizing their colonial aims in Ukraine… In addition to the immediate destruction of all Jewish communities, Himmler insisted that the Ukrainian civilian population be brought to a &#x27;minimum.&#x27;

During 1942-1949 Zhytomyr region was a territory of mild Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) activity (UPA North), who fought for Independence of Ukraine against Nazi Germany and Soviet Union.

After Soviet Union defeated Nazi Germany, Zhytomyr fell under Soviet rule and became a part of Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic again.

On 24 August 1991 Ukrainian parliament announced Declaration of Independence of Ukraine. From 1991, Zhytomyr has been part of the independent and sovereign Ukraine.

=== 2022 Russian invasion ===

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Zhytomyr and the surrounding area were subjected to several Russian air and missile strikes, such as the 2 March airstrike which damaged residential buildings, a thermal electricity plant, and two hospitals, killing at least two and injuring more than a dozen.

According to a survey conducted by the International Republican Institute in April–May 2023, 82% of the city&#x27;s population spoke Ukrainian at home, and 14% spoke Russian.

=== Roman Catholics ===
Zhytomyr had been a Latin Catholic bishopric since 1321, until The See was suppressed in 1789 in favor of the Diocese of Lutsk and Zytomierz, until that was split up again in 1925, when it was restored as the Roman Catholic Diocese of Zhytomyr; that was formally suppressed in 1998 to establish the Diocese of Kyïv–Žytomyr, but actually the city retains the episcopal see in its Cathedral of the Holy Wisdom, while Kyiv (although first in the title and the national capital) only has a co-cathedral.

The Zhytomyr cemetery was opened in 1800. At first, it served Polish nobility from Volhynia, such as the Czeczel and the Woronicz families. Later, other Catholics were buried here, including Germans, Ukrainians and Russians.

In 1840, the Chapel of St. Stanislaus was built (now in ruins), and the cemetery was divided into nine districts, named after different saints. In the Soviet Union, the complex was devastated, now it is under the process of renovation.

Among most famous people buried here are: 
* Bronislaw Matyjewicz-Maciejewicz, one of the first Polish air pilots
* Karol Niedzialkowski - bishop of Lutsk and Zhytomir in the late 19th century
* Apolinary Wnukowski - Roman Catholic archbishop and scholar
* Juliusz Zarębski - Polish composer
* parents of Ignacy Jan Paderewski
* the family of Stanisław Moniuszko

=== Jews in Zhytomyr ===
Zhytomyr apparently had few Jews at the time of the Khmelnytsky Uprising (1648), but by the time it became part of Russia in 1778, it had a large Jewish community, and was a center of the Hasidic movement. Jews formed nearly one-third of the 1861 population (13,299 of 40,564); thirty years later, they had somewhat outpaced the general growth of the city, with 24,062 Jews in a total population of 69,785. By 1891 there were three large synagogues and 46 smaller &quot;batei midrash&quot;. The proportion of Jews was much lower in the surrounding district of Zhytomyr than in the city itself; at the turn of the century (circa 1900) there were 22,636 Jews in a total population of 281,378.

In Imperial Russia, Zhytomyr held the same status as the official Jewish center of southern part of the Pale of Settlement as Vilnius held in the north. The printing of Hebrew books was permitted only in these two cities during the monopoly of Hebrew printing from 1845 to 1862, and both were chosen as the seats of the two rabbinical schools which were established by the government in 1848 in pursuance of its plans to force secular education on the Jews of Russia in accordance with the program of the Teutonized Russian Haskalah movement. The rabbinical school of Zhytomyr was considered the more Jewish, or rather the less Russianized, of the two (&quot;Ha-Meliẓ&quot;, 1868, No. 40, cited in &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;). Its first head master was Jacob Eichenbaum, who was succeeded by Hayyim Selig Slonimski in 1862. The latter remained at the head of the school until it was closed (together with the one at Vilnius) in 1873 because of its failure to provide rabbis with a secular education who would be acceptable to the Jewish communities. Suchastover, Gottlober, Lerner, and Zweifel were among the best-known teachers of the rabbinical school at Zhytomyr, while Abraham Goldfaden, Salomon Mandelkern, and Abraham Jacob Paperna were among the students who later became famous in the Jewish world.

The Jewish community of Zhytomyr suffered pogroms:
#On 7–8 May 1905, when the section of the city known as &quot;Podol&quot; was devastated, and 20 were killed within the city.
#On 7–10 January 1919, 15 young Jewish neighbors were killed when they came to defend, and the Christian student Nicholas Blinov, also attempting to defend, likewise died. Ten young Jews from nearby Chudnov were also killed while on their way to aid the Jews of Zhytomyr.
#Beginning on 22 March 1919, according to witnesses, the 317 deaths were fewer than might have been, due to both Christian sheltering efforts and the return of the Bolshevik troops within a few days.

The Jewish community of the region was largely destroyed in the Holocaust. In the four months beginning with Himmler&#x27;s 25 July 1942 orders, &quot;all of Ukraine&#x27;s shtetls and ghettos lay in ruins; around 3,000 Jewish men, women, and children were murdered by stationary and mobile SS-police units with local Ukrainian auxiliaries.&quot;

Today, the Zhytomyr Jewish community numbers about 5,000. The community is a part of the &quot;Union of Jewish Communities in Ukraine&quot; and the city and district&#x27;s rabbinate. Rabbi Shlomo Vilhelm, who came to the city as a Chabad emissary in 1994, serves as rabbi. Other Jewish institutions are also active in the city, including the Joint and its humanitarian branch &quot;Chesed&quot; and the Jewish Agency.

The community has an ancient synagogue in the city center which has a mikveh. Chabad operates in the city various educational institutions which have residence in a village next to the city.

== Culture ==
The city has 2 state theaters and a philharmonic, more than 10 museums, libraries and planetarium.

One of the world-famous museums of cosmonautics Serhiy Pavlovych Korolyov Museum of Cosmonautics is located in the city.

In 1858, the first stone theater in Ukraine was built (now it houses the regional state philharmonic). M. Kropyvnytskyi, M. Zankovetska, V. Komisarzhevska, I. Aldridge, P. Viardot performed here.

In 1966, a new theater building was built with a large auditorium for 943 seats and a small one for 70 seats, a lobby with an area of 550 m2, rehearsal halls, dressing rooms, offices, production shops.

Currently in the city work:

== Geography ==

Zhytomyr lies in a unique natural setting; all sides of the city are surrounded by ancient forests through which flow the Teteriv, Kamianka, Kroshenka and Putiatynka rivers. The Teteriv river generally forms the southern boundary of Zhytomyr, though there are also some small areas of Zhytomyr city territory below the southern bank of the river. The city is rich in parks and public squares.

Zhytomyr is set out on a mostly radial type of street net with the centre at the main public square of the city, named &quot;Sobornyi Maidan&quot; (which means &quot;Cathedral Square&quot;). A building containing courts and some other institutions is in the west of the square. Before 1991, this building contained Zhytomyr Oblast Committee of the Communist Party. Just behind the building (that is to the west of Sobornyi Square) is a small quiet park, bearing the name of &quot;Zamkova Gora&quot; (&quot;Castle Mountain&quot;) and containing a monument-type boulder with an inscription stating that this is a place where Zhytomyr was founded. This historical centre of Zhytomyr is in the south part of the city. The old part of Zhytomyr is on three rocky hills over the river Kamianka: Okhrimova, Zamkova, and Petrovska.

The old town is surrounded by new housing estates, the names of which are often borrowed from the former suburban villages or reflect the longstanding occupations common in these places. The main streets connecting Sobornyi Maidan with the outskirts of Zhytomyr are Kyivska Street or Kyiv Street (going to northeast, to the railway station and also to the main bus station of the city), Velyka Berdychivska Street (going to southeast), Lech Kaczyński Street (going southwest; its further continuation is Chudnivska Street going to beaches and a forest-type park near the river of Teteriv), and Peremohy Street (going north).

The best-known street in the central part of Zhytomyr is Mykhailivska (named after St. Michael&#x27;s Church at the northern end of the street). The street is about 500 metres to the east of Sobornyi Maidan and runs approximately from north to south, connecting some points at the above-mentioned Kyivska Street and Velyka Berdychivska. Mykhailivska Street is for pedestrian traffic: vehicles are forbidden, with the exception of some slow-moving ones. A puppet theatre is nestled in the middle of the street, while the building of the Zhytomyr City Council is at its southern end. Several small coffee houses and cafés have sprung up here recently, frequented by locals from all walks of life and of all ages. If one crosses Velyka Berdychivska Street from the southern end of Mykhailivska Street, then one finds oneself at Korolyov Square containing the building of the Zhytomyr Oblast Council. Crossing Kyivska Street from the northern end of Mykhailivska Street, one can continue to go along Pokrovska Street, another important long avenue of Zhytomyr (going north).

The best-known park of Zhytomyr is named after Yuri Gagarin, in the south of the city, at the left (northern) bank of the Teteriv River. It was formerly owned by the Baron de Chaudoir.

== Economy ==

Zhytomyr is an important economic center in the region. Enterprises in the city include glass, metal fabrication, electronic devices, screens, fabrics, furniture, shoes and others.
In addition, there is a large pharmaceutical factory in Zhytomyr. Since 1944, a confectionery factory (ALC &quot;ZhL&quot;) has operated in Zhytomyr; the enterprise is one of the leaders of the Ukrainian confectionery market.

The city is home to the Zhytomyr Armored Factory. The factory has been one of the main repair facilities in Ukraine since the start of the Russo-Ukrainian War, running on 3 shifts. In September 2014 it was announced that the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine had placed a ₴280 million order with the factory.

Zhytomyr has three bus stations connecting it with many other cities and villages in Ukraine and abroad.
Zhytomyr has fifteen bridges and junctions built over rivers and roads. There is a 30-kilometer ring road around Zhytomyr.

=== Public city transport ===
Common kinds of public transport shuttling within Zhytomyr are trolleybuses, buses, and minibuses. There are also electric trams, but on one route only. Earlier there were several tram routes in Zhytomyr, but all excepting one were canceled during a period of domination of the opinion that a tram is a bad kind of transport.
Trams began to shuttle in Zhytomyr in 1899. Thus Zhytomyr became the 5th city with electric trams within the territory of present-day Ukraine. Trolleybuses appear in Zhytomyr in 1962.
The total length of Zhytomyr city electric transport routes (trolleybuses and trams) is 275 km. Zhytomyr is the first city in Ukraine to implement e-ticket system in all municipal public transport.

<text>The Royal Guards () is the King of Sweden&#x27;s cavalry and infantry guards of honour of the Swedish Armed Forces, tasked with the protection of the Swedish royal family.

==History and ceremonies==
The Royal Guard is normally divided in two parts, the main guard stationed at the Stockholm Palace, and a smaller detachment at Drottningholm Palace. The Royal Guards units has continuously guarded the Swedish royal family in Stockholm since 1523.

The duty of forming a &quot;Royal Guard&quot; is rotated by all serving regular and reserve armed forces, including the Home Guard. However, these detachments only serve for about 5–7 days in each rotation, so most of the year the duty is carried out by the Life Guards regiment of Stockholm, consisting of four battalions, one light infantry, two security, and one guard battalion. Tracing its history through the Household Brigade and Svea Life Guards and Life Guard Dragoons back to the original Royal Guards, this is what constitutes the regiment&#x27;s claims to being one of the oldest military units and formations in continuous operation.

The Grenadier Company is the honor guard of the Swedish Army&#x27;s Life Guards for state ceremonies. Their uniform includes bearskin hats, and white baldrics (cross belts) that originally carried the fuses used to light grenades. The grenadiers bear the King&#x27;s own Life Company banner, which was presented to the unit in 1868 by Charles XV&#x27;s consort, Queen Louise.

Between April and August, the mounted squadrons in light blue full dress uniforms and silver pickelhaube helmets and the companies in dark blue full dress uniforms with black pickelhaube helmets, both of the Life Guards, can be seen in Stockholm street parades and around the Royal Palace. Accompanied by the mounted band, they depart from the K1 Cavalry barracks in Gärdet, and arrive at the Palace around noon (1 p.m. on Sundays and public holidays) for the changing of the guards ceremony. These events attracts large numbers of tourists each summer.

In the regular guard mounts, the regular royal guard contingent is composed of the personnel from the King&#x27;s Guards Battalion, Life Guards.

<text>Dust (Sooraya Qadir) is a superheroine appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character usually appears in X-Men-related comic books. Sooraya is a mutant with the ability to transform her body into a pliable cloud of dust.

==Publication history==
Sooraya Qadir, alias Dust, was created by writer Grant Morrison and artist Ethan Van Sciver for the comic book series &quot;New X-Men&quot; #133 (December 2002). Dust has since appeared in various &quot;X-Men&quot; related comic book series, miniseries, and storylines.

==Fictional character biography==

===Origin===
Sooraya Qadir is a Pashtun Muslim from Kandahar, Afghanistan, who possesses the mutant ability to transform into a sand-like substance. The character’s origin story depicts her getting kidnapped by slavers who attempt to remove her religious head covering, the niqab. This event triggers Sooraya&#x27;s mutant power for the first time, killing her attackers. Rescued by Wolverine and Fantomex, Sooraya enrolls at the Xavier Institute for Mutant Education and Leadership, a school dedicated to training mutants to control their powers and coexist with humanity.

====Storylines====
Sooraya Qadir&#x27;s experiences at the Xavier Institute are documented across various X-Men comic book series. Notably, she features prominently in the aftermath of a major event within the Marvel Universe that significantly reduces the mutant population. This event, known as &quot;Decimation,&quot; significantly impacts the dynamics at the Xavier Institute, forcing the school to restructure and leading to a reduced student body. Sooraya is among the 27 mutants who retain their powers after Decimation, placing her in a unique position within the institute.

====Early struggles and adaptation====
Following her enrollment, Sooraya initially struggles to adapt to life at the Xavier Institute. Cultural and religious differences create challenges, particularly with her outspoken roommate Noriko. Despite these obstacles, Sooraya demonstrates unwavering faith in her Islamic beliefs, choosing to wear her religious attire instead of the standard training uniform. Over time, Sooraya develops friendships with other students, including Icarus. However, her religious background occasionally leads to conflict with other characters, highlighting the complexities of integrating mutants from diverse backgrounds. Sooraya&#x27;s journey at the Xavier Institute is marked by various challenges that test her courage and resilience. Due to her religious beliefs, Sooraya becomes a target for anti-mutant factions within the Marvel Universe, leading to threats and capture. However, Sooraya consistently demonstrates her bravery, using her unique sand-based powers to battle enemies like William Stryker and the villain Belasco. Despite facing injuries and moments of self-doubt regarding leadership, Sooraya continues to overcome adversity, even confronting powerful mutants like a nanotech-controlled Sentinel and Predator X. Her resourcefulness and strategic use of her powers prove valuable in defeating formidable foes like the mutant Exodus.

====Return to Afghanistan and beyond====
Sooraya&#x27;s story extends beyond the walls of the Xavier Institute. In later storylines, she returns to her home country, taking a protective stance over a small town. However, she becomes entangled in a complex situation and is manipulated into joining a team led by a character impersonating Cyclops. This event leads to a life-threatening situation where parts of her body are temporarily transformed into glass. Sooraya demonstrates remarkable resilience, eventually recovering and rejoining the X-Men in San Francisco. Following a major schism within the X-Men, Sooraya initially sides with Wolverine&#x27;s team but ultimately chooses to remain with Cyclops&#x27; faction.

== Personality and relationships ==
Sooraya is depicted as a quiet and reserved individual, initially struggling to adapt to life at the Xavier Institute, particularly with her outspoken roommate Noriko. Despite these initial difficulties, Sooraya demonstrates unwavering faith in her religion, choosing to wear a hijab instead of the standard training uniform. Throughout her time at the institute, Sooraya develops friendships with other students like Icarus, though her religious beliefs occasionally create conflict with other characters.

==Appearance==
In line with Sooraya&#x27;s character as a traditional Muslim, she chooses to don a loose-fitting black dress, with a niqab covering her face. Sooraya explains to her mother that she dresses this way because of the modesty it affords her from men. Her mother is happy that she lives somewhere where she is able to make those choices

==Powers and abilities==
Dust is a transmorph, able to transform herself into an explosive cloud of sand-like silicon particles and maintain control of her sand form. She can reform her normal body at will or maintain an aerial based sand form in the shape of her human body. Her sandstorm form is resistant to most forms of injury. The form makes her hard to detect telepathically, according to Jean Grey and Professor X. She is also resistant to magic. She can use the form to attack, for instance, scouring the flesh from her enemies&#x27; bones like a sandstorm as well as enter people&#x27;s lungs and scouring them from the inside.

== Critical reception ==
Peter Eckhardt of &quot;CBR.com&quot; called Dust one of the &quot;favorite characters with connections to the 616 AAPI community,&quot; writing, &quot;Qadir&#x27;s Sunni Muslim faith is a critical part of her character. She&#x27;s depicted almost exclusively wearing traditional Muslim dress consisting of a niqab atop an abaya. Although her faith occasionally creates conflict with other characters, Qadir&#x27;s faith remains strong and makes her one of the most positive representations of Muslim women in speculative fiction.&quot; Marc Buxton of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; said, &quot;We have the devout Muslim warrior Dust, one of the bravest X-Men to join Xavier’s team in the 21st century. When a slave trader forcibly tried to remove her niqab, Sooraya Qadir manifested her power to turn her body into sand and flayed him alive. Dust remains one of X-Men’s bravest, using her unwavering faith and powers to help other young mutants. For Dust, her eyes tell the whole story, of faith and pain, of belief and bravery.&quot;

==Other versions==
Although Dust is a character in the main Marvel Universe continuity (also called &quot;Earth-616,&quot;), she has also been depicted in other fictional universes and alternate futures.

===House of M===
Sooraya appears as a member of the New Mutants in the &quot;House of M&quot; continuity. She appears to have formed a very close friendship with Jubilee and become Westernized, wearing revealing clothes and enjoying stereotypical &#x27;mall rat&#x27; activities. Like the rest of the Hellions and New Mutants, she travels to Japan to fight against Emperor Sunfire in order to close down Project Genesis.

===X-Men: The End===
In the alternate time line depicted in X-Men: The End, Sooraya remains at the institute as the caretaker of Cyclops and Emma Frost&#x27;s children. During the attack on the institute, Sooraya encounters Madelyne Pryor, asking if she is Jean Grey returning to the school. Madelyne lashes out and Sooraya defends herself, seemingly defeating Madelyne and escaping the institute before it explodes. It is later revealed that the &quot;Dust&quot; who escaped the encounter was really Madelyne, disguised in Sooraya&#x27;s abaya. Upon revealing her true identity, Cyclops states that he already knew it was her and that the real Sooraya died back at the school.

===Young X-Men &quot;End of Days&quot;===
In a dystopic future depicted in the final two issues of &quot;Young X-Men&quot;, Sooraya appears before the last remaining mutants on the once mutant safe-haven and independent state of &quot;Xaviera&quot;. She easily kills Wolverine and kills Graymalkin and Emma Frost. Before killing him, Sooraya explains to Anole that she is doing this because mutants are a &quot;plague&quot; upon the world and that she has become its cure, &quot;a storm that wipes clean the earth&quot;. She reaches a now decrepit Ink, who has a brief conversation with her regarding her revival in the past. They both discuss that his actions corrupted her, &quot;killing&quot; her soul and she reveals that she still harbors resentment over &quot;mutants&quot; allowing her to die in the first place. She states that she is sorry, as she knows his actions were good at heart, and kills him.

In this future depiction, Sooraya no longer observes Islamic hijab, wearing a tight outfit exposing her face and her cleavage. Her eyes glow red and she has combustive powers in addition to her original abilities.

<doc id="1025115" wikidata="Q472520" url="?curid=1025115" title="Hal B. Wallis">
<text>Harold B. Wallis (born Aaron Blum Wolowicz; October 19, 1898 – October 5, 1986) was an American film producer. He is best known for producing &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942), &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1938), and &quot;True Grit&quot; (1969), along with many other major films for Warner Bros. featuring such film stars as Humphrey Bogart, John Wayne, Bette Davis, and Errol Flynn. As a producer, he received 19 nominations for the Academy Award for Best Picture.

Later on, for a long period, he was connected with Paramount Pictures and oversaw films featuring Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis, Elvis Presley, and John Wayne.

==Life and career==
Aaron Blum Wolowicz was born September 14, 1898 in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Eva (née Ewa Blum) and Jacob Wolowicz/Wolovitz (Jankiel Wołowicz). He was the youngest of three children and had two older sisters: Minna Wolovitz (1893-1986), a Hollywood talent agent, and Juel Wolovitz (1895-1953). His parents were Ashkenazi Jews from the Suwałki region of Congress Poland, which was then part of the Russian Empire and is now Poland. The future producer and his sisters eventually changed their surname to Wallis.

His family moved in 1922 to Los Angeles, California, where he found work as part of the publicity department at Warner Bros. in 1923. Within a few years, Wallis became involved in the production end of the business and would eventually become head of production at Warner. In a career that spanned more than 50 years, he was involved with the production of more than 400 feature-length movies.

Among the more significant movies he produced were &quot;Casablanca&quot;, &quot;Dark Victory&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;, &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, &quot;Sergeant York&quot;, and &quot;Now, Voyager&quot;.

In March 1944, Wallis won the Academy Award for Best Picture at the 16th Academy Awards. During the ceremony, when the award was announced for &quot;Casablanca&quot;, Wallis got up to accept, but studio head Jack L. Warner rushed up to the stage &quot;with a broad, flashing smile and a look of great self-satisfaction,&quot; Wallis later recalled. &quot;I couldn&#x27;t believe it was happening. &quot;Casablanca&quot; had been my creation; Jack had absolutely nothing to do with it. As the audience gasped, I tried to get out of the row of seats and into the aisle, but the entire Warner family sat blocking me. I had no alternative but to sit down again, humiliated and furious ... Almost forty years later, I still haven&#x27;t recovered from the shock.&quot; This incident would lead Wallis to leave Warner Bros. the next month.

Wallis started to work as an independent producer, enjoying considerable success both commercially and critically. The first screenwriters he hired for his new enterprise were Ayn Rand and Lillian Hellman. Among his financial hits were the Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis comedies, and several of Elvis Presley&#x27;s movies.

He produced &quot;True Grit&quot;, for which John Wayne won the Academy Award for Best Actor of 1969, and its sequel.

After moving to Universal Pictures, he produced &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot; (starring Richard Burton and Canadian actress Geneviève Bujold) and &quot;Mary, Queen of Scots&quot; (starring Vanessa Redgrave and Glenda Jackson). He received 16 Academy Award producer nominations for Best Picture, winning for &quot;Casablanca&quot; in 1943.

For his consistently high quality of motion picture production, he was twice honored with the Academy Awards&#x27; Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award. He was also nominated for seven Golden Globe awards, twice winning awards for Best Picture. In 1975, he received the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement in motion pictures.

In 1980, he published his autobiography, &quot;Starmaker&quot;, co-written with Charles Higham.

In the 1930s, Wallis invested in residential real estate development in Sherman Oaks, California. He named Halbrent Avenue after himself and/or his son, using his nickname &quot;Hal&quot; and his son Harold&#x27;s middle name &quot;Brent&quot;. Most of its original homes still stand, and it is very close to Ventura and Sepulveda Boulevards and the Sherman Oaks Galleria used extensively in the 1982 movie &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;.

Wallis and his second wife, actress Martha Hyer, contributed funds towards the construction of The Hal and Martha Hyer Wallis Theatre, a black box theater, at Northwestern University.

===Relationships===
Wallis was married to actress Louise Fazenda from 1927 until her death in 1962. They had one son, Harold Brent, who became a psychiatrist. Several writers including actors and producers have stated that actress Lizabeth Scott was a mistress of Wallis while he was married to Fazenda. Wallis was married to actress Martha Hyer from 1966 until his death in 1986. Hyer wanted Wallis to include Scott and his other mistresses in his autobiography, but he did not. After his marriages, Wallis watched Scott&#x27;s films at home, night after night.

===Politics===
Wallis was a lifelong Republican, who supported Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 1952 US Presidential Election. He was also a member of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals.

==Death==
Wallis died on October 5, 1986 from complications of diabetes in Rancho Mirage, California, two weeks before his 88th birthday. News of his death was not released until after his private memorial service. U.S. President Ronald W. Reagan, who appeared in Wallis&#x27;s films &quot;Santa Fe Trail&quot; and &quot;This Is The Army,&quot; sent his condolences to the family. Wallis is interred at the Great Mausoleum at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

<text>MS &quot;Mega Regina&quot; is a cruiseferry owned by Corsica Ferries. She was formerly owned and operated by Viking Line as MS &quot;Mariella&quot;. She was built by the Wärtsilä Perno shipyard in Turku, Finland and delivered to SF Line in 1985. Her sister ship is the &quot;Olympia&quot; (now MS &quot;SPL Princess Anastasia&quot;). &quot;Mariella&quot; was the world&#x27;s largest cruiseferry from 1985 until 1989, when the accolade passed on to her Viking Line fleetmate MS &quot;Athena&quot;. &quot;Mariella&quot; was sold to Corsica Ferries in 2021 and renamed &quot;Mega Regina&quot;. The ship started traffic on the Mediterranean Sea in summer 2021.

==History==
When the &quot;Mariella&quot; was delivered in 1985, she was the first ship on Viking Line&#x27;s Helsinki–Stockholm service which was not owned by Rederi Ab Sally. She has remained on the same route ever since, except for a few brief times when she has been moved temporarily on to other Viking Line routes. This makes her the record holder for the longest continual service on the Helsinki–Stockholm route. At the time of her delivery, the &quot;Mariella&quot; was the largest ferry in the world in terms of gross tonnage, number of passengers and passenger berths.

In 1989, ahead of the delivery of the new MS &quot;Cinderella&quot;, SF Line considered moving &quot;Mariella&quot; on to a proposed express Helsinki–Norrköping service aimed at passengers travelling with their cars. The plan never materialised, and &quot;Mariella&quot; continued to serve on the same route even after the Cinderella was delivered and placed as the third ship on the route. Following the bankruptcy of Rederi AB Slite in 1993, SF Line was left as the sole operator of the Viking Line name, but this had no effect on &quot;Mariella&quot;&#x27;s traffic.

&quot;Mariella&quot; was the first ship to arrive at the scene of perished MS &quot;Estonia&quot; in September 1994. Fifteen survivors were picked up from the sea and another eleven were brought on board by helicopters, as &quot;Mariella&quot; was used as the main helicopter platform.

During the 1996 summer season a short cruise from Helsinki to Tallinn was added to &quot;Mariella&quot;&#x27;s schedule in place of the nine hours she normally spent in Helsinki. These &quot;picnic cruises&quot; proved to be unpopular and they were not continued the following summer. When the EU ended tax free sales on routes between member states in July 1999, Viking Line added a stop at Mariehamn, Åland to the Helsinki–Stockholm route. As Åland is not a part of the EU tax union, Viking Line could continue tax-free sales on its ships.

In September 2000 &quot;Mariella&quot; was refitted at Naantali with rear sponsons and a new fast rescue boat. Her interior was also brought up to date and for some time after the refit she sported the text &quot;Updated 06/10 2000&quot; on her hull. Another refit was carried out in September 2006 once again at Naantali.

In mid-2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Helsinki-Stockholm route was put on hold. The company released a statement in August, putting &quot;Mariella&quot; up for sale. There was no intention of actually selling her but stated that interesting bids could be accepted.

In May 2021, Viking Line announced that the ship had been sold to Corsica Ferries. &quot;Mariella&quot; was sold for a price of 19.6 million euros. Corsica Ferries started using the ship in late June 2021. Her new name is &quot;Mega Regina&quot;.

<text>The National Assembly (, or ; short form &quot;državni zbor&quot;) is the general representative body of Slovenia. According to the Constitution of Slovenia and the Constitutional Court of Slovenia, it is the major part of the distinctively incompletely bicameral Slovenian Parliament, the legislative branch of the Republic of Slovenia. It has 90 members, elected for a four-year term. 88 members are elected using the party-list proportional representation system and the remaining two, using the Borda count, by the Hungarian and Italian-speaking ethnic minorities, who have an absolute veto in matters concerning their ethnic groups.

As of May 2022, the 9th National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia is in session.

== Legislative procedure ==
A bill can be submitted to the National Assembly by:

* the Government
* an MP
* the National Council
* 5,000 voters

The legislative procedure begins when the Speaker passes a bill to the MPs.

There are three possible legislative procedures:

* regular legislative procedure
* abbreviated legislative procedure
* urgent legislative procedure

Bills are normally passed by a majority of the present MPs. If the Constitution demands a two-thirds majority (laws regulating electoral systems, referendums and constitutional laws which amend the Constitution), then at least 60 of the 90 MPs must vote for the bill for passage.

=== Regular legislative procedure ===

==== First reading ====
The first reading is completed with passing the bill to the MPs by the Speaker, unless ten MPs request a session of the assembly within 15 days to discuss reasons why bill was submitted.

If the session is held, the assembly must vote on the resolution if the bill is appropriate for a further procedure.

The Speaker determines a working body that will discuss the bill in the further procedure. Other bodies can also discuss the bill if there is such interest, however they cannot vote on it.

==== Second reading ====
During the second reading bill is first discussed by the working body that can amend the bill and make a report on the bill which is the basis for the plenary of assembly. Working body discusses and votes on each article of the bill. Assembly later votes and discusses only the articles that were amended during the session of the working body.

Assembly and working body can accept a resolution that the bill is not appropriate for a furder procedure if not such resolution was accepted during the first reading.

==== Third reading ====
In the third reading working body and assembly vote on the bill as a whole. If it is accepted the bill is sent to the President to sign it.

=== Shortened legislative procedure ===
During shortened legislative procedure there is no first reading and the second and third readings are held at the same session.

It can be applied for a bills that regulate minor matters, another law is abolished with the bill, if national laws have to be harmonised with Acquis communautaire or when bill regulates procedures before the Constitutional Court or Constitutional Court order changes of the laws.

=== Urgent legislative procedure ===
Bill can be passed under urgent procedure if it is important for the security or defence of the country, if it is addressing the consequences of natural disasters or it is proposed to prevent irreversible consequences for the country.

There is no first reading, the second and third readings are held at the same session, amendments to the bill can be given orally and timeline of the procedure is shorter.

=== Demand for new vote on the law ===
When the bill is passed, the National Council can demand that National Assembly vote again on the bill. A greater majority is needed to pass the bill in the new vote.

== Electoral system ==
The 90 members of the National Assembly are elected by two methods. 88 are elected by open list proportional representation in eight 11-seat constituencies and seats are allocated to the parties at the constituency level using the Droop quota. The elected Deputies are identified by ranking all of a party&#x27;s candidates in a constituency by the percentage of votes they received in their district. The seats that remain unallocated are allocated to the parties at the national level using the d&#x27;Hondt method with an electoral threshold of 4%. Although the country is divided into 88 electoral districts, deputies are not elected from all 88 districts. More than one deputy is elected in some districts, which results in some districts not having an elected deputy (for instance, 21 of 88 electoral districts did not have an elected deputy in the 2014 elections). Parties must have at least 35% of their lists from each gender, except in cases where there are only three candidates. For these lists, there must be at least one candidate of each gender.

Two additional deputies are elected by the Italian and Hungarian minorities. Voters rank all of the candidates on the ballot paper using numbers (1 being highest priority). A candidate is awarded the most points (equal to the number of candidates on the ballot paper) when a voter ranks them first. The candidate with most points wins.

<text>David Graham Phillips (October 31, 1867 – January 24, 1911) was an American novelist and journalist of the muckraker tradition.

==Early life==
Phillips was born in Madison, Indiana. After graduating from high school, Phillips entered Asbury College (now DePauw University) and later received a degree from Princeton University in 1887.

==Career==
After completing his education, Phillips worked as a newspaper reporter in Cincinnati, Ohio, before moving on to New York City where he was employed as a reporter for &quot;The Sun&quot; from 1890 to 1893, then columnist and editor with the &quot;New York World&quot; until 1902. In his spare time, he wrote a novel, &quot;The Great God Success&quot;, that was published in 1901. The royalty income enabled him to work as a freelance journalist while continuing to write fiction. Writing articles for various prominent magazines, he began to develop a reputation as a competent investigative journalist. Phillips&#x27; novels often commented on social issues of the day and frequently chronicled events based on his real-life journalistic experiences. He was considered a progressive and for exposing corruption in the Senate he was labelled a muckraker.

Phillips wrote an article in &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; in March 1906, called &quot;The Treason of the Senate,&quot; exposing campaign contributors being rewarded by certain members of the U. S. Senate. The story launched a scathing attack on Rhode Island senator Nelson W. Aldrich, and brought Phillips a great deal of national exposure. This and other similar articles helped lead to the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, initiating popular instead of state-legislature election of U. S. senators.

David Graham Phillips is known for producing one of the most important investigations exposing details of the corruption by big businesses of the Senate, in particular, by the Standard Oil Company. He was among a few other writers during that time that helped prompt President Theodore Roosevelt to use the term “Muckrakers”.

 The article inspired journalist Charles Edward Russell to insist to his boss William Randolph Hearst, who had just recently purchased the &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine, that he push his journalists to explore the Senate corruption as well. Philips was offered the position to explore more information about the corruption and bring it into the public’s eye. Philips’ brother Harrison and Gustavus Myers were hired as research assistants for Philips. Hearst commented to his readers about Philips starting a series that would reveal the Senate corruption so much, that most Senators would resign. This held true for some of the Senators, such as New York Senators Chauncey M. Depew and Thomas Collier Platt. Philips exposed Depew as receiving more than $50,000 from several companies. He also helped educate the public on how the senators were selected and that it was held in the hands of a few bosses in a tight circle, helping increase the corruption level. As a result of these articles, only four of the twenty-one senators that Philips wrote about were still in office. Philips also had some of the greatest success as a muckraker, because he helped change the U.S. Constitution, with the passage of the 17th Amendment, creating popular election for senators.

His talent for writing was not the only thing that helped him stand out in the newsroom. Philips was known to dress in a white suit with a large chrysanthemum in his lapel.

==Death==
Phillips&#x27; reputation cost him his life in January 1911, when he was shot outside the Princeton Club at Gramercy Park in New York City. The killer was a Harvard-educated musician named Fitzhugh Coyle Goldsborough, a violinist in the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra who came from a prominent Maryland family. Goldsborough believed that Phillips&#x27;s novel &quot;The Fashionable Adventures of Joshua Craig&quot; had cast literary aspersions on his family. Admitted to Bellevue Hospital, Phillips died a day later.

Following Phillips&#x27;s death, his sister Carolyn organized his final manuscript for posthumous publication as &quot;Susan Lenox: Her Fall and Rise&quot;. In 1931, that book would be made into an MGM motion picture of the same name and starring Greta Garbo and Clark Gable.

David Graham Phillips is interred in the Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York.

<text>Akrotiri and Dhekelia (), officially the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia (SBA), is a British Overseas Territory made of two non-contiguous areas on the island of Cyprus. The areas, which include British military bases and installations that were formerly part of the Crown colony of Cyprus, were retained by the British under the 1960 treaty of independence signed by the United Kingdom, Greece, Turkey and representatives from the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities. The territory serves as a station for signals intelligence and is thereby part of the United Kingdom&#x27;s surveillance-gathering work in the Mediterranean and the Middle East.

Akrotiri and Dekhelia area is an total of 254 km2, which makes it of one of the smallest British Overseas, European, and Middle-Eastern territory. Its population increases to 18,195 for 2020, thus, it is one of the least populated territories worldwide. The Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia borders United Kingdom and Cyprus, even if UK is in Northwestern Europe and Akrotiri and Dekhelia in Southeastern Europe, their border is a signifiant trading way. Basically used as military bases, Akrotiri and Dhekelia are inhabited, with some of its population being Cypriots. 
== History ==


The Sovereign Base Areas were created in 1960 by the London and Zürich Agreements, when Cyprus achieved independence from the British Empire, as recorded by the United Nations in 1960 as treaty 5476. The United Kingdom desired to retain sovereignty over these areas, as this guaranteed the use of UK military bases on Cyprus, including RAF Akrotiri, and a garrison of the British Army. The importance of the bases to the British is based on the strategic location of the island, at the eastern edge of the Mediterranean, close to the Suez Canal and the Middle East; the ability to use the RAF base as staging post for military aircraft; and for training.

In July and August 1961, there were a series of bomb attacks against the pipeline carrying fresh water to the Dhekelia Sovereign Base Area. The pipeline was breached by explosions twelve times.

In the early 1970s the United States built an over-the-horizon radar named Cobra Shoe, which could observe airplane operations and missile tests in southern Russia. This was operated by the RAF on behalf of the U.S. Air Force. This augmented an earlier British system built in the early 1960s named Project Sandra. The American use of the base was hidden from the Cypriot government due to sensitivities between governments.

In 1974, following a military coup by the Cypriot National Guard, Turkey invaded the north of Cyprus, leading to the establishment of the internationally unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. This did not affect the status of the bases. Greek Cypriots fleeing from the Turkish forces were permitted to travel through the Dhekelia Sovereign Base Area and were given humanitarian aid, with those from Achna setting up a new village (Dasaki Achnas or Achna Forest) which is still in the Dhekelia Sovereign Base Area. The Turkish advance halted when it reached the edge of the Dhekelia Sovereign Base Area to avoid military conflict with the United Kingdom. In the Akrotiri Sovereign Base Area a tented refugee camp was set up at &quot;Happy Valley&quot; (part of the Episkopi Cantonment) to house Turkish Cypriots fleeing from Limassol and the villages surrounding the Area, until in 1975 they were flown out of RAF Akrotiri via Turkey to northern Cyprus. Some Greek Cypriot refugees remain housed on land in the parts of Trachoni and Kolossi villages that fall within the Akrotiri Sovereign Base Area.

In 1974, the British government decided that British forces would be entirely withdrawn from Cyprus, because the sprawling bases had become undefendable in the light of increasing troop demands in Northern Ireland, and because of pressure on the defence budget. The American government strongly objected to any British withdrawal that would result in the United States losing access to GCHQ signals intelligence from Cyprus, since it had lost access to its many signals intelligence bases in Turkey due to its political dispute with Turkey following the invasion of Cyprus. The United States agreed to contribute to base costs, and the British cancelled the closure plan. American use of the base increased, such as Lockheed U-2 spy flights on Syria, though flights were generally at night &quot;to avoid local curiosity&quot;.

==Politics==
===Current status===
The territory comprises two base areas. One is Akrotiri ( ; ), or the Western Sovereign Base Area (WSBA), which includes two main bases at RAF Akrotiri and Episkopi Cantonment, plus all of Akrotiri village&#x27;s district (including Limassol Salt Lake) and parts of eleven other village districts. The other area is Dhekelia Cantonment ( ; ), or the Eastern Sovereign Base Area (ESBA), which includes a base at Ayios Nikolaos plus parts of twelve village districts.

As of 2024, based units include

;RAF Akrotiri and Episkopi: Cantonment: 
*No. 903 Expeditionary Air Wing RAF
*No. 84 Squadron RAF
*1st Battalion, Princess of Wales&#x27;s Royal Regiment
*Cyprus Operations Support Unit
*Cyprus Military Working Dog Troop
*Cyprus Joint Police Unit (CJPU)
;Dhekelia Cantonment:
*1st Battalion, The Rifles
*Joint Service Signal Unit (Cyprus)

Ayios Nikolaos Station, in the ESBA, is an ELINT (electronic intelligence) listening station of the UKUSA Agreement intelligence network. The UKUSA signals intelligence system is sometimes known as &quot;ECHELON&quot;.

=== Governance ===
The SBAs were retained in 1960 to keep military bases in areas under British sovereignty, along with the rights retained to use other sites in what became the territory of the Republic. That makes them different from the other remaining British Overseas Territories.

The basic philosophy of their administration was declared by the British government in Appendix O to the 1960 treaty with Cyprus, which provided that the British government intended:

*Not to develop the Sovereign Base Areas for other than military purposes.
*Not to set up and administer &quot;colonies&quot;.
*Not to create customs posts or other frontier barriers between the Sovereign Base Areas and the Republic.
*Not to set up or permit the establishment of civilian commercial or industrial enterprises except insofar as these are connected with military requirements, and not otherwise to impair the economic, commercial or industrial unity and life of the Island.
*Not to establish commercial or civilian seaports or airports.
*Not to allow new settlement of people in the Sovereign Base Areas other than for temporary purposes.
*Not to expropriate private property within the Sovereign Base Areas except for military purposes on payment of fair compensation.

Appendix O also provides that various ancient monuments in the SBAs (in particular the site and remains of Kourion, the Sanctuary of Apollo Hylates near Kourion, the Stadium of Curium and the Church and remains of the Holy Monastery of St Nicholas of the Cats) should be administered by the Republic of Cyprus. The Cypriot government issues licences for antiquity excavation in the SBAs subject to British consent, and any movable antiquities found in excavations or otherwise discovered become Cypriot state property.

According to the British Ministry of Defence:
The territory is administered by an Administrator, who is also the Commander of British Forces Cyprus, which is Air Vice-Marshal Peter J. M. Squires. The Administrator is officially appointed by the British monarch on the advice of the Ministry of Defence. The Administrator has all the executive and legislative authority of a governor of an overseas territory. A Chief Officer is appointed, and is responsible to the Administrator for the day-to-day running of the civil government, with subordinate Area Officers responsible for the civil administration of the two areas. No elections are held in the territory, although British citizens are normally entitled to vote in United Kingdom elections (as British Forces or overseas electors).

The areas have their own legal system, distinct from the United Kingdom and the Republic of Cyprus. This consists of the laws of the Colony of Cyprus as of August 1960, amended as necessary. The laws of Akrotiri and Dhekelia are closely aligned with, and in some cases identical to, the laws operating within the Republic of Cyprus. The Court of the Sovereign Base Areas is concerned with non-military offences committed by any person within Akrotiri and Dhekelia, and law and order is maintained by the Sovereign Base Areas Police, while offences involving British Forces Cyprus and military law are dealt with by the Cyprus Joint Police Unit. Fire and rescue services are provided by the Defence Fire and Risk Management Organisation through stations at Episkopi, Akrotiri, Dhekelia and Ayios Nikolayos. The Defence Medical Services provide emergency ambulance cover based from medical centres in the main bases. All emergency services are accessible from any telephone using the Europe-wide emergency number 112.

=== Reviews ===
In January 2010, a newspaper article appeared in the British press claiming that as a result of budgetary constraints arising from the Great Recession, the British Ministry of Defence drew up controversial plans to withdraw the United Kingdom&#x27;s 3,000 strong garrison and end the use of Cyprus as a staging point for ground forces. The Labour government, under whom the proposal appeared, was replaced by the Cameron–Clegg coalition whose defence review did not mention the issue.

On 15 December 2012 in a written statement to the House of Commons, the UK&#x27;s Secretary of State for Defence, Philip Hammond, revealed the findings of a report on the SBA military bases following the completion of a review of their operations by Lord Ashcroft:
===Dispute and controversies===
The Republic of Cyprus claims that the Sovereign Base Areas are a &quot;remnant of colonialism&quot;. On 30 June 2005 the House of Representatives of Cyprus unanimously adopted a resolution on the legal status of the base areas originally proposed by Vassos Lyssarides. The resolution refers to &quot;relevant UN decisions on the abolition of colonialism, as well as the fundamental principles of international law, which forbid the occupation of territory within the domain of any other country.&quot; It claims that &quot;the United Kingdom does not have substantial sovereignty over the British bases, but it has as much sovereignty as is necessary for military reasons and not for administrative, financial and / or any other reasons.&quot; The resolution urged the UK government &quot;to fulfil its financial obligations towards the Republic of Cyprus, which derive from the Treaty of Establishment.&quot; It also argued that the UK does not have territorial waters in the areas.

The UK government does not recognise Cypriot claims that the UK&#x27;s sovereignty in the areas is limited.

In July 2001, protests were held at the bases by local Cypriots, unhappy with British plans to construct radio masts at the bases as part of an upgrade of British military communication posts around the world. Locals claimed the masts would endanger local lives and cause cancer, as well as have a negative effect on wildlife in the area. The British and Cypriot governments jointly commissioned health research from the University of Bristol and the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Cyprus, and that research project reported in 2005 that there was no evidence of health problems being caused by electromagnetic fields from the antennas. The Sovereign Base Areas Administration has carried out assessments and surveys into the effects on wildlife, which have fed into an &quot;Akrotiri Peninsula Environmental Management Plan&quot;, published in September 2012.

In 2004, the UK offered to cede of farmland as part of the rejected Annan Plan for Cyprus.

On 29 August 2013, during the Syrian civil war, some Cypriot and British media sources speculated that long-range ballistic missiles, fired from Syria in retaliation for proposed British involvement in military intervention against the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad, could hit Cyprus, and could potentially deliver chemical weapons. In some Cypriot media it was stated that the proposed interdiction of the Syrian civil war, utilising Akrotiri and Dhekelia, could recklessly endanger the Cypriot populations near to those bases. Two days earlier, on 27 August 2013, Cypriot foreign minister Ioannis Kasoulides had moved to calm Cypriot concerns, saying that the British bases were unlikely to play a major part in any intervention.

A spike in the US Air Force arms delivery from US and NATO depots in Europe to Akrotiri was reported by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, and &quot;the illegal presence of thousands of American soldiers&quot; at the base have drawn criticism. During his 2024 visit to the base dispatching survailance planes to Gaza, the British prime minister Keir Starmer noted, &quot;We can’t necessarily tell the world what you’re doing here&quot; &quot;for reasons that are obvious to you, the whole world is relying on you&quot;. Surveillance planes continued being dispatched towards Gaza after the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began.

=== Border and travel documents ===

There is normally no passport check at the border from Akrotiri or Dhekelia to Cyprus. Perhaps to help reduce any tensions in the area, outside of the bases much of the territory is indistinguishable from that controlled by Cyprus and casual visitors may not realize that they have crossed an international border. In the exchange of notes establishing them the British government specifically stated that it would not &quot;...create customs posts or other frontier barriers between the Sovereign Base Areas and the Republic.&quot; More formal controls do exist at the Republic of Northern Cyprus boundary. 

Possession of a passport or an EU-compliant national identity card is generally needed in Cyprus. A passport is required to travel between Cyprus/SBAs and Northern Cyprus. Issues concerning the validity of car insurance and customs are specified by SBAs&#x27; administration.

===Brexit implications===
Under Article 2(1) of the Protocol, the SBAs are partially part of the European Union Customs Union in three domains: VAT, agriculture and fisheries. However, the SBAs are already outside the EU. Therefore, concerns have been raised about the future status of about 15,000 Cypriots (EU citizens) working in the SBA following the UK&#x27;s 2020 departure from the EU. Cyprus, Ireland and Spain are the only three EU states that conducted bilateral talks with the UK on the Brexit issue. The talks between the UK and the Republic of Cyprus started in October 2017.

The Brexit withdrawal agreement has a protocol on the SBAs, with provisions essentially maintaining their previous status.

== Geography ==

Akrotiri and Dhekelia cover 3% of the land area of Cyprus, a total of (split (48.5%) at Akrotiri and (51.5%) at Dhekelia). Akrotiri and Dhekelia have a border of and with Cyprus respectively. Akrotiri also has a longer coastline than Dhekelia. 60% of the land is privately owned as freeholds by Cypriot citizens; the other 40% is controlled by the Ministry of Defence as Crown leasehold land. In January 2014, an agreement between the Cypriot and UK governments was signed, ensuring that residents and property owners in the British Bases will enjoy equal rights for the development of property. In addition to Akrotiri and Dhekelia, the Treaty of Establishment also provided for the continued use by the British Ministry of Defence and the British Armed Forces of certain facilities within the Republic of Cyprus, known as &quot;Retained Sites&quot;.

Akrotiri is located in the south of the island, near the city of Limassol (or Lemesos). Dhekelia is in the southeast, near Larnaca. Both areas include military bases, as well as farmland and some residential land. Akrotiri is surrounded by territory controlled by the Republic of Cyprus, but Dhekelia also borders on the United Nations (UN) buffer zone and the area controlled by the Turkish forces.

Ayia Napa lies to the east of Dhekelia. The villages of Xylotympou and Ormideia, also in the Republic of Cyprus, are enclaves surrounded by Dhekelia. The Dhekelia Power Station, divided by a British road into two parts, also belongs to the Republic of Cyprus. The northern part is an enclave, like the two villages, whereas the southern part is located by the sea, and therefore not an enclave, though it has no territorial waters of its own.

Territorial waters of are claimed, and the right according to the laws of the UN to extend the claim of up to is reserved.

=== Wildlife and ecology ===

Cyprus is an important migration flyway for birds between Africa and Europe and millions of birds are killed yearly as they migrate over the island. To protect resident and migratory birds, BirdLife Cyprus and the RSPB survey areas of illegal trapping. More than 150 species of birds, over half of conservation concern, have been trapped in nets, or on limesticks, and it is estimated that organised crime gangs earn over 15 million Euros yearly. The dead birds are sold to provide the main ingredient for ambelopoulia — an illegal delicacy — in the Republic of Cyprus. The 2015 survey estimated a maximum of mist nets across both the Republic and the British Territories, and more than 5,300 limesticks removed, mainly in the Republic. It is estimated that over 2 million birds were killed in 2015 including over 800,000 on British Territories. Employing measures such as covert camera surveillance (including a drone), exclusion zones and impounding vehicles, trapping activity at Dhekelia fell by 77.5%. In 2016 an estimated 800,000 birds were killed at Dhekelia and in the following year trapping activity fell by 77.5% and bird deaths to an estimated 180,000.

The Episkopi Cliffs Important Bird Area lies mostly within the western base area, and covers much of the peninsula. It was identified as an IBA in 1989, and became recognised under the Ramsar Convention in 2003. 60% was designated as a Special Protection Area in 2010. Over 300 bird species have been recorded in this area. The wetlands, including the large salt lake, are an important habitat and bird hotspot. These wetlands are an important breeding spot for the ferruginous duck, which has nested there since 2005. Other species that nest in the wetlands include the black-winged stilt, the Kentish plover, the spur-winged lapwing, and the stone-curlew. Black francolins, Cyprus wheatears, Cyprus warblers, Eleonora&#x27;s falcons, peregrine falcons, griffon vultures, European shags, European rollers, blue rock thrushs, and wallcreepers breed elsewhere in the area, especially around the cliffs.

The beaches in the British Sovereign Base Areas (SBAs) are important nesting sites for the endangered green &quot;Chelonia mydas&quot; and loggerhead &quot;Caretta caretta&quot; turtles. The SBA Environment Department, assisted by a large volunteer effort, has monitored turtle nesting success on SBA beaches since 1990. Disturbance to nesting turtles is an issue in some areas due to activities such as camping, driving on beaches and illegal fishing. Sea turtles in Cyprus are protected as priority species under the Protection and Management of Nature and Wildlife Ordinance (implementing the provisions of the Habitats Directive), enacted in 2007.

In December 2015, five Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) were designated in the Cyprus Sovereign Base Areas. The five SACs designated are Akrotiri, Episkopi, Cape Pyla, Dhekelia and Agios Nikolaos. The designations were made under the Protection and Management of Nature and Wildlife Ordinance and will support the existing network (NATURA 2000) of SACs in Cyprus and across Europe.

== Demographics ==


When the areas were being established, the boundaries were deliberately drawn to avoid centres of population. Approximately 18,195 people live in the areas. About 11,000 native Cypriots work in the areas themselves, or on farmland within the boundaries of the areas. The British military and their families make up the rest of the population.

Persons related to the territory may in theory be eligible to claim the British Overseas Territories citizenship (BOTC status) through a personal connection to the areas (i.e., birth on the territory before 1983, or born after 1983 to a parent who was born on the territory before 1983). But unlike most other British Overseas Territories, there is no provision in the 2002 amendment of the British Nationality Act 1981 by which British citizenship (with the right of abode in the United Kingdom) can either be claimed through automatic entitlement or be applied for by means of registration, from or through a sole personal connection to the Base Areas (in comparison, the 2002 Act bestowed British citizenship on all other BOTCs). Hence, non-British and non-military personnel with a connection to the territory cannot live and work in the UK and must use their Cypriot passports to apply for visas to the UK.

Under the terms of the 1960 agreement with Cyprus establishing the Sovereign Base Areas, the United Kingdom is committed not to use the areas for civilian purposes. This was stated in 2002 as the primary reason for the exclusion of the areas from the scope of the British Overseas Territories Act 2002. , around 7,195 service personnel of British Forces Cyprus are based at Akrotiri and Dhekelia.

=== Education ===
Service Children&#x27;s Education oversees education for children of personnel and MoD employees. The Eastern Sovereign Base Area is served by Dhekelia Primary School and Ayios Nikolaos Primary School, which are feeders for King Richard School. The Western Sovereign Base Area is served by Episkopi Primary School and Akrotiri Primary School, which are feeders for St. John&#x27;s School.

== Economy ==
No economic statistics are gathered for Akrotiri and Dhekelia. The main economic activities are the provision of services to the military, as well as limited agriculture. When the territory under the effective control of the Republic of Cyprus switched currencies from the Cypriot pound to the euro on 1 January 2008, Akrotiri and Dhekelia followed suit making the Sovereign Base Areas the only territory under British sovereignty to officially use the euro.
=== Transport ===
Cypriot motorways pass through both areas. There is no public airport within the areas, but the RAF Akrotiri airbase is located there, which has a runway suitable for long-distance flights, but is not used for public flights.

=== Communications ===
The Base Areas form part of the Republic of Cyprus telephone numbering plan, using the international prefix +357. Landline numbers are in the same eight-digit format, with the last four digits being the line number. Numbers in Dhekelia begin with the digits 2474, while those in Akrotiri begin with the digits 2527.

Postal services are provided by the British Forces Post Office, with mail to Akrotiri being addressed to BFPO 57 and mail to Dhekelia and Ayios Nikolaos being addressed to BFPO 58. Cyprus Postal Services provides postal service for civilian homes and businesses within the Base Areas, then using Cypriot postal codes and &quot;Cyprus&quot; as country on letters from abroad.

The bases are issued different amateur radio call signs from the Republic of Cyprus. Amateur radio stations on the bases use the International Telecommunication Union prefix of &quot;ZC4&quot;, which is assigned to Great Britain. There are about 52 amateurs licensed in this manner. Amateur radio direction finding identified RAF Akrotiri as the location of the powerful but now defunct shortwave numbers station &quot;Lincolnshire Poacher&quot;. Several curtain antennas there have been identified as being used for these transmissions.

==Culture==

=== Media ===

BFBS Radio 1 and 2 are broadcast on FM and can be widely received across Cyprus. BFBS Television is now only available to viewers via satellite, having been confined to the SBAs or encrypted in 1997 for copyright reasons, before BFBS switched off its analogue transmitters in 2009. The British East Mediterranean Relay Station was situated locally.

===Sport===
Football clubs in the territory, such as Ethnikos Achna FC and APEA Akrotiri, compete in the Cypriot football league system. A separate league for British military teams, the Cyprus Forces Football League, is run by the Royal Air Force FA.

The Commander British Forces Cyprus Sporting Competition (CBF Cup), a multi-sport competition between teams representing bases and resident British infantry battalions, is held annually.

<doc id="1025150" wikidata="Q486239" url="?curid=1025150" title="Saw (film)">
<text>Saw is a 2004 American horror film directed by James Wan in his feature directorial debut, and written by Leigh Whannell, from a story by Wan and Whannell. It is the first installment in the &quot;Saw&quot; film series, and stars Whannell alongside Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, Monica Potter, Michael Emerson, and Ken Leung.

The film tells a nonlinear narrative revolving around the mystery of the Jigsaw Killer, who tests his victims&#x27; will to live by putting them through deadly &quot;games&quot; where they must inflict great physical pain upon themselves to survive. The frame story follows Jigsaw&#x27;s latest victims (Whannell and Elwes), who awaken in a large, dilapidated bathroom, with one being ordered to kill the other to save his own family.

The screenplay was written by Whannell, who co-created the story with Wan in their respective screenwriting debuts. The film was originally written in 2001, but after failed attempts to get the script produced in Wan and Whannell&#x27;s home country of Australia, they were urged to travel to Los Angeles. In order to help attract producers, they shot a low-budget short film of the same name from a scene out of the script. This proved successful in 2003 as producers were immediately attached and also formed a horror genre production label, Twisted Pictures. The film was given a small production budget and was shot in 18 days.

&quot;Saw&quot; was first screened at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2004. Due to positive audience reception, Lionsgate picked up the distribution rights for the film. Originally planned for a straight-to-video release, they decided to instead release the film in theaters in North America on October 29, 2004. The film received mixed reviews from critics. After topping the opening weekend box office, the film would go on to gross $104 million worldwide to become one of the most profitable horror films since &quot;Scream&quot; (1996). The success of &quot;Saw&quot; launched a media franchise, including several films, video games, theme park rides, and merchandising. The first sequel, titled &quot;Saw II&quot;, was released the following year in October 2005.

==Plot==

Adam, a photographer, awakens in a dilapidated bathtub with his ankle chained to a pipe. Across the room is oncologist Dr. Lawrence Gordon, and between them is the corpse of an apparent suicide victim holding a revolver and a microcassette recorder. Both men find a tape in their pockets, and Adam retrieves the recorder. Adam&#x27;s tape urges him to survive, while Gordon&#x27;s tape orders him to kill Adam by 6:00, or his wife, Alison, and daughter, Diana, will be murdered. After listening to the tapes, the duo uncovers a clue leading Adam to find a bag containing two hacksaws inside the toilet. Both men try to saw through their chains, but Adam&#x27;s saw breaks. Gordon realizes that the saws are intended for their feet, and identifies their captor as the Jigsaw Killer, a serial killer who tests his victims&#x27; will to survive through murderous contraptions known as &quot;games&quot;, whom Gordon knows about as he was once a suspect.

Five months prior, Gordon, after discussing the terminal brain cancer of patient John Kramer with his medical interns, was interrogated by detectives David Tapp and Steven Sing, who found his penlight at the scene of one of Jigsaw&#x27;s games. Gordon&#x27;s alibi cleared him, but he agreed to view the testimony of heroin addict Amanda Young, the only known survivor of one of Jigsaw&#x27;s traps. Tapp and Sing later found Jigsaw&#x27;s warehouse using the videotape from Amanda&#x27;s game. There, they detained Jigsaw and saved a man from a trap, but Jigsaw managed to escape after he critically injured Tapp; Sing was killed by a shotgun trap.

In the present, Alison and Diana are tied up and gagged in their apartment, as their captor watches Adam and Gordon through a hidden camera. The house is simultaneously watched by Tapp who, after being discharged from the police following Sing&#x27;s death, has become obsessed with the Jigsaw case, and remains convinced that Gordon is the killer. Meanwhile, Gordon finds a box containing two cigarettes, a lighter, and a one-way cellphone. Adam asks Gordon for the cigarette but Gordon discourages this. He recounts his abduction in a parking garage by a pig-masked figure. Adam recalls his own abduction when he returned home to find a puppet in his darkroom, where he stored photos of Gordon.

Held at gunpoint, Alison calls her husband and warns him not to trust Adam, who admits to Gordon that he was paid by Tapp to spy on him, and reveals his knowledge of Gordon&#x27;s affair with one of his medical students whom he had visited on the night of his abduction. Gordon deduces that the affair is the reason why he is being tested. Adam finds a photo of Alison and Diana&#x27;s captor, whom Gordon identifies as Zep Hindle, an orderly at his hospital.

Zep, seeing that Gordon has still not killed Adam, moves to murder Alison and Diana, but Alison frees herself and fights him. The struggle attracts Tapp&#x27;s attention, and he saves Alison and Diana before chasing Zep to the sewers, where he is shot in the chest after a brief fight. Gordon, only aware of the gunshots and screaming, is shocked but cannot reach his cell phone. In desperation, he saws off his foot and shoots Adam with the corpse&#x27;s revolver. Zep enters the bathroom to kill Gordon, but Adam, having survived the gunshot, bludgeons him to death with a toilet tank lid. Gordon crawls out of the bathroom to find help while Adam searches Zep&#x27;s body for a key. He finds another tape, which reveals that Zep was just another victim of Jigsaw, following rules to obtain the antidote for a slow-acting poison in his body.

The &quot;corpse&quot; lying in the room suddenly rises to its feet; it turns out to be John Kramer, who is the real Jigsaw Killer. John tells Adam that the key to his chain was in the bathtub; it went down the drain when Adam had first awoken and drained the water. Adam attempts to shoot John with Zep&#x27;s gun, but John electrically shocks him through his chain. John exits the bathroom before sealing the door, leaving Adam alone to die.

===Development and writing===

After finishing film school, Australian director James Wan and Australian writer Leigh Whannell wanted to write and fund a film. The inspiration that they needed came after watching the low-budget independent film &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;. Another film that inspired them to finance the film themselves was Darren Aronofsky&#x27;s &quot;Pi&quot;. The two thought the cheapest script to shoot would involve two actors in one room. Whannell said, &quot;So I actually think the restrictions we had on our bank accounts at the time, the fact that we wanted to keep the film contained, helped us come up with the ideas in the film.&quot; One idea was to have the entire film set with two actors stuck in an elevator and being shot in the point of view of security cameras.

Wan pitched the idea to Whannell of two men chained to opposite sides of a bathroom with a dead body in the middle of the floor and they are trying to figure out why and how they are there. By the end of the film, they realize the person lying on the floor is not dead and he is the reason they are locked in the room. Whannell initially did not give Wan the reaction he was looking for. He said, &quot;I&#x27;ll never forget that day. I remember hanging up the phone and started just going over it in my head, and without any sort of long period of pondering, I opened my diary that I had at the time and wrote the word &#x27;Saw&#x27;.&quot; Before writing the word &quot;Saw&quot; in a blood-red, dripping font, the two had not come up with a title. &quot;It was one of those moments that made me aware that some things just really are meant to be. Some things are just waiting there to be discovered&quot;, Whannell said.

The character of Jigsaw did not come until months later, when Whannell was working at a job he was unhappy with and began having migraines. Convinced it was a brain tumor, he went to a neurologist to have an MRI; and, while sitting nervously in the waiting room, he thought: &quot;What if you were given the news that you had a tumor and you were going to die soon? How would you react to that?&quot; He imagined the character Jigsaw having been given one or two years to live and combined that with the idea of Jigsaw putting others in a literal version of the situation but only giving them a few minutes to choose their fate. Wan did not intend to make a &quot;torture porn&quot; film, and the script only had one short segment of torture. He said the film &quot;played out like a mystery thriller&quot;. It was not until the sequels that the plot focused more on torture scenes.

===Funding and short film === 
Whannell and Wan initially had $30,000 to spend on the film, but as the script developed it was clear that more funds would be needed. The script was optioned by a producer in Sydney for a year but the deal eventually fell through. After other failed attempts to get the script produced in Australia from 2001 to 2002, literary agent Ken Greenblatt read the script and suggested they travel to Los Angeles, where their chances of finding an interested studio were greater. Wan and Whannell initially refused due to lack of traveling funds, but the pair&#x27;s agent, Stacey Testro, convinced them to go. In order to help studios take interest in the script, Whannell provided A$5,000 (US$5,000) to make a short film based on the script&#x27;s jaw trap scene, which they thought would prove most effective. Whannell played David, the man wearing the reverse bear trap. Working at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Whannell and Wan knew cameramen who were willing to provide technical assistance for the short.

Wan shot the short with a 16mm camera over two days and transferred the footage to DVDs to ship along with the script. Whannell wanted to play the lead character in the feature film. The short helped show that Wan and Whannell were a &quot;director-actor team&quot; rather than just wanting to sell the script. Wan said, &quot;Leigh and I just loved the project so much and we wanted a career in filmmaking so we stuck to our guns and said, &#x27;Look, guys, if you want this project, we&#x27;re coming on board — Leigh has to act in it and I have to direct it.&quot;

In early 2003, while in Los Angeles and before they met with producer Gregg Hoffman, Hoffman&#x27;s friend pulled him into his office and showed him the short. Hoffman said, &quot;About two or three minutes into it, my jaw hit the floor.&quot; He quickly showed the short and script to his partners Mark Burg and Oren Koules of Evolution Entertainment. They later formed Twisted Pictures as a horror genre production label. The producers read the screenplay that night and two days later offered Wan and Whannell creative control and 25% of the net profits. Even though Wan and Whannell received &quot;better offers&quot; from studios like DreamWorks and Gold Circle Films, they were not willing to chance Wan&#x27;s directing and Whannell acting in the lead role. In order to finance the film, Hoffman, Burg, and Koules put up a second mortgage on their Highland Avenue headquarters. &quot;Saw&quot; was given a production budget of between $1 million and $1.2 million.

===Casting===

Cary Elwes was sent the short film on DVD and immediately became interested in playing Dr. Lawrence Gordon in the film. He read the script in one sitting and was drawn in by the &quot;uniqueness and originality&quot; of the story. Koules was Elwes&#x27; manager at the time. To prepare for his role as an oncologist, he met with a doctor at UCLA&#x27;s Department of Neurosurgery. In August 2005, Elwes filed a lawsuit against his management firm and producers of &quot;Saw&quot;, Evolution Entertainment, alleging &quot;breach of contract and unjust enrichment&quot;. Elwes said that he was promised that he would receive a minimum of one percent of the producers&#x27; net profits from the film and did not. Elwes claims he only received $53,275 and a salary of $2,587.20. The case was later settled out of court and Elwes reprised his role five years later in &quot;Saw 3D&quot;.

Shawnee Smith, who is not a horror fan, initially refused the role of Amanda Young, describing the script as &quot;horrific&quot;. However, after watching the short, she agreed to the role, which was the part that Whannell portrayed in the short. Wan offhandly suggested Smith when his casting director asked who he wanted to play Amanda, as he had had a crush on Smith since his teenage years, and was surprised when his casting director secured her on the role. Danny Glover was cast as Detective David Tapp, who is in pursuit of the Jigsaw Killer. Glover stated in an interview, &quot;Something about that detective character at that particular point attracted me to it&quot;. Michael Emerson felt drawn to accept the role of Orderly Zep Hindle due to finding the film&#x27;s writing &quot;masterful&quot; and its twist ending &quot;jaw-dropping&quot;, deeming it the &quot;best ending of a piece of film writing [he] had ever seen&quot;.

On taking the role of Jigsaw, Tobin Bell said, &quot;I did &quot;Saw&quot; because I thought it was a fascinating location for a film to be made. These guys locked in a room, to me, was fresh. I did not anticipate the ending when I read the script, so I was quite caught by surprise and it was clear to me that if the filmmakers shot the scene well, the audience would be caught by surprise as well. The film was worth doing for that moment alone&quot;. Bell also stated that he wanted to take the opportunity to work with Glover, with whom he had never previously worked. Wan primarily cast Bell because of his voice. Mike Butters was originally offered the role of Jigsaw, but declined as he felt that that role did not have enough exciting scenes. Butters, a friend of one of the producers whom he used to play hockey with, ended up cast as Paul Leahy, the Jigsaw victim who perishes in a razor wire maze trap.

===Filming and post-production===
With a shooting budget of $700,000, &quot;Saw&quot; began principal photography on at Lacy Street Production Facility in Los Angeles for 18 days. The bathroom was the only set that had to be built. There were no chairs on the set. Other sets like the police station were shot in locations where other productions had built similar sets. The bathtub scene was filmed the first day of filming, and it was then that Whannell realized that they didn&#x27;t have money left in the budget to hire a stuntman to shoot the scene, forcing him to perform the scene himself. It took six days to shoot all the scenes in the bathroom, and these were filmed chronologically to avoid continuity jumps and help the actors stay in character. To film the scenes of the two protagonists, Wan made sure most of Dr. Gordon&#x27;s shots were very steady and controlled while Adam&#x27;s shots were shaky and handheld to match the characters&#x27; personalities. Instead of using a camera dolly or a tripod, cinematographer David A. Armstrong shot the entire film with the camera over his shoulder.

There was no time for Elwes and Whannell to rehearse their scenes together to not conflict with the schedules of Glover and Emerson, who were only available for a certain number of days. Glover completed his scenes in two days. Emerson found the shoot &quot;punishing&quot;, but a &quot;real adventure&quot; he was glad to survive. According to Elwes, his dialogue averaged 12 to 16 pages a day, which he considered a great challenge. Due to the tight shooting schedule, Wan could not afford to shoot more than a couple of takes per actor. &quot;It was a really tough struggle for me. Every day, it was me fighting to get the shots I did not get. I had high aspirations, but there&#x27;s only so much you can do. I wanted to make it in a very Hitchcockian style of filmmaking, but that style of filmmaking takes time to set up and so on&quot;, Wan said about the very short shooting schedule. He said the style instead ended up being &quot;more gritty and rough around the edges due to the lack of time and money that we had to shoot the movie with&quot; and it ultimately became the aesthetic of the film.

$400 were spent on reshoots Wan and Whannell did on their own. For the reshoots, Whannell served as a stand-in to Smith and Ken Leung in the scenes of Amanda searching for her key and of Steven Sing entering into Jigsaw&#x27;s lair. In post-production, Wan found he did not have enough shots or takes to work with as he was basically shooting rehearsals. Having a lot of missing gaps in the final product, he and editor Kevin Greutert created shots to mend together during editing, such as making a shot look like a surveillance camera feed and using still photographs. &quot;We did a lot of things to fill in gaps throughout the film. Whatever we cut to newspaper clippings and stuff like that, or we cut to surveillance cameras, or we cut to still photography within the film, which now people say, &#x27;Wow, that&#x27;s such a cool experimental style of filmmaking&#x27;, we really did that out of necessity to fill in gaps we did not get during the filming&quot;, he explained.

==Release==
Lionsgate picked up &quot;Saw&quot; worldwide distribution rights at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival days before the film premiered on . There it played to a packed theater for three midnight showings to a positive reaction. It was the closing film at the Toronto International Film Festival on . Lionsgate initially planned to release the film direct-to-video, but due to the positive reaction at Sundance, they chose to release it theatrically by Halloween. It was released on in the United Kingdom, in the United States and in Australia. The film was initially rated NC-17 (No One 17 and Under Admitted) by the Motion Picture Association of America for strong graphic violence, though after being re-edited, it was released with an R rating. Lionsgate held a blood drive for the Red Cross called &quot;Give Til It Hurts&quot; and collected 4,249 pints of blood.

The soundtrack was released on by Koch Records. Johnny Loftus of AllMusic gave it three out of five stars. He said that Clouser &quot;really nails it with his creaky, clammy score&quot; and that he &quot;understands that &quot;Saw&quot; horror only works with a heady amount of camp, and he draws from industrial music in the same way&quot;. He particularly liked, &quot;Cigarette&quot;; &quot;Hello, Adam&quot;; and &quot;F**k This S*!t&quot;, commenting that they &quot;blend chilling sounds with harsh percussion and deep-wound keyboard stabs&quot;.

===Critical response===
 Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Dennis Harvey of &quot;Variety&quot; gave the film a negative review after its Sundance premiere. He called it a &quot;crude concoction sewn together from the severed parts of prior horror/serial killer pics&quot;. He called the screenplay &quot;convoluted&quot;, criticizing the use of &quot;flashbacks within flashbacks&quot; and red herrings. He described the film as being &quot;too hyperbolic to be genuinely disturbing&quot;. Carla Meyer of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; gave the film a positive review, saying the film &quot;combined B-movie acting with a twisted mind-set and visual tricks designed to camouflage cheap effects&quot; and that it was &quot;terrifying at some moments and insinuatingly creepy at many others.&quot; She called the killing scenes &quot;amazingly evocative for such a low-budget movie&quot;.

&quot;Empire&quot; Kim Newman gave the film four out of five stars. He said &quot;Saw&quot; is styled like early David Fincher films and &quot;boasts an intricate structure — complex flashbacks-within-flashbacks explain how the characters have come to this crisis — and a satisfying mystery to go with its ghastly claustrophobia.&quot; He ended his review saying, &quot;As good an all-out, non-camp horror movie as we&#x27;ve had lately.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a B minus, calling it &quot;derivative and messy and too nonsensical for its own good.&quot; He described Jigsaw&#x27;s intent as &quot;to show you the serial killer lurking inside yourself&quot;. Gleiberman criticized Elwes&#x27; performance by saying, &quot;[Elwes] ought to be featured in a seminar on the perils of overacting. He compared the plot to &quot;Seven&quot; saying, &quot;In a blatant imitation of &quot;Seven&quot;, &quot;Saw&quot; features a lunatic sadist whose ghoulish crimes are meant, in each case, to mirror the sins of his victims. The twist here is that the psycho doesn&#x27;t do the killing.&quot; Daniel M. Kimmel of the &quot;Telegram &amp; Gazette&quot; called it &quot;one of the most loathsome films this critic has seen in more than 20 years on the job&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; Stephen Holden gave a mixed review, saying the film &quot;does a better-than-average job of conveying the panic and helplessness of men terrorized by a sadist in a degrading environment, but it is still not especially scary. What sets its demon apart from run-of-the-mill movie serial killers is his impulse to humiliate and torture his victims and justify it with some twisted morality.&quot; He said the film is &quot;seriously undermined by the half-baked, formulaic detective story in which the horror is framed.&quot; Carina Chocano of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; also gave the film a mixed review, saying, &quot;&quot;Saw&quot; is so full of twists it ends up getting snarled. For all of his flashy engineering and inventive torture scenarios, the Jigsaw Killer comes across as an amateur. Hannibal Lecter would have him for lunch.&quot; She said the film &quot;carelessly underscores its own shaky narrative at every turn with its mid-budget hokiness&quot;. She also noted that Elwes and Whannell had trouble keeping an American accent. Another mixed review came from Roger Ebert, who gave the film 2 out of 4 stars and lamented the gimmicks and plot contrivances but nonetheless described &quot;Saw&quot; as &quot;well made and acted, and does what it does about as well as it could be expected to&quot;.

Richard J. Leskosky of Champaign-Urbana&#x27;s &quot;The News-Gazette&quot; said, &quot;&quot;Saw&quot; wants to be taken as another &quot;Seven&quot;. Though it features perverse gross-out scenes and a villain with a superficially pedantic motive behind his crimes (his victims, if they survive, have learned to appreciate life more), it lacks the finesse and polish of the David Fincher film.&quot; When asked if the 1995 thriller film &quot;Seven&quot; was an inspiration to &quot;Saw&quot;, Whannell said, &quot;For me as the writer, definitely. I mean, &quot;Seven&quot; is just a very well constructed film, and if you&#x27;re writing a thriller, it can&#x27;t hurt to study it. In terms of the story though, James and I never really felt &quot;Seven&quot; was that close to our film. I guess if you stand back, you have two detectives chasing a psychopath, who uses vile methods to teach people lessons, and those points echo &quot;Seven&quot;. What we always liked about &quot;Saw&quot;, though, was that the story is told from the point of view of two of the psychopath&#x27;s victims, instead of the police chasing after him, as you so often see.&quot;

Bloody Disgusting, ranked the film tenth in its list of the Top 20 Horror Films of the decade, with the article calling &quot;Saw&quot; &quot;perhaps the most influential horror film of the decade&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; listed the film number 14 on their Top 100 list that defined the 2000s. The film was nominated for best horror film at the 31st Saturn Awards.

<text>Bernie Faloney (June 15, 1932 – June 14, 1999) was a professional football player in the Canadian Football League (primarily with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats) and an outstanding American college football player at the University of Maryland. Born in Carnegie, Pennsylvania, Faloney is a member of the Canadian Football Hall of Fame, Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame, the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame, the Western Pennsylvania Hall of Fame, and the University of Maryland Athletic Hall of Fame. Faloney&#x27;s jersey #10 was retired by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in 1999. In 2005, Faloney was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame. In 2006, Faloney was voted to the Honour Roll of the CFL&#x27;s Top 50 Players of the league&#x27;s modern era by Canadian sports network TSN.

==Early life and college career==
B.J. &quot;Bernie&quot; Faloney was born in Carnegie, Pennsylvania, where he played high school football before attending the University of Maryland, College Park. There, he played college football as a quarterback, helping the Terrapins make it to the Sugar Bowl in 1952. In his senior season of 1953, Faloney quarterbacked Maryland to be NCAA Division I-A national football champions and into the 1954 Orange Bowl. At season&#x27;s end, Faloney finished fourth in the balloting for the 1953 Heisman Trophy.

==Professional football career==
Faloney was drafted in the first round of the 1954 National Football League draft by the San Francisco 49ers. San Francisco offered Faloney $9000 to play defensive back and back-up quarterback. However Pop Ivy, coach of the University of Maryland&#x27;s Orange Bowl opponent, Oklahoma, was moving to the Edmonton Eskimos of the Western Interprovincial Football Union and offered Faloney a $12,500 contract to accompany him. At the time the Canadian dollar was worth 10 percent more than its American counterpart, so the choice to head north was easy, Faloney later recalled.

A scrambling quarterback, Faloney helped the Eskimos win the 1954 Grey Cup but then fulfilled his mandatory service in the United States armed forces, serving with the U.S. Air Force from 1955 to 1956. A free agent after his military service, Faloney signed with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in 1957 and became one of the major stars of the Canadian Football League, winning two Grey Cup championships with the Ti-Cats. Traded from Hamilton in 1965, he played for the Montreal Alouettes and the BC Lions before retiring in 1967.

Faloney was the Eastern Conference&#x27;s All-Star quarterback on five occasions, 1958, 1959, 1961, 1964 and 1965. In 1961, he won the CFL&#x27;s Most Outstanding Player Award. His career CFL stats include 1,493 pass completions of 2,876 attempts for 153 touchdowns and 24,264 yards. He is the first CFL quarterback to win a Grey Cup championship with both Eastern and Western Conference teams.

Bernie Faloney was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1974, the Western Pennsylvania Hall of Fame in 1983, the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame in 1985, the University of Maryland Athletic Hall of Fame in 1988, and Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 1999. In November 2006, Faloney was voted to the Honour Roll of the CFL&#x27;s top 50 players of the league&#x27;s modern era by Canadian sports network TSN.

==Later life and death==
In retirement, Faloney made his home in Hamilton, Ontario, where he became a part owner of a construction company. An avid horseman, he remained active in community and business affairs until being stricken with colorectal cancer.

Faloney was the first Tiger-Cat player to have his number retired by the club when the team announced his number retirement on June 8, 1999. He died six days later on June 14, 1999, in Hamilton, Ontario.

==Tribute==
Cannon Street in Hamilton, Ontario, in the Brian Timmis Stadium and Tim Hortons Field area is also known as &quot;Bernie Faloney Way.&quot;

<text>Paradinha is a former civil parish in the municipality (&quot;concelho&quot;) of Moimenta da Beira, Portugal. In 2013, the parish merged into the new parish Paradinha e Nagosa. The population in 2011 was 125, in an area of 5.72 km².

==History==
Paradinha, an ancient settlement emerged from the remnants of the castro of Moreiró.

Many notable noblemen passed through this area, including the Infante John (son of Peter I of Portugal and Inês de Castro). Still, it was the Morais Sarmento family that influenced the growth of the settlement. Settling in this corner the noble family established several rich estates and concentrated their activities in the region. This auspicious plutocracy helped to establish the first roadways in the area, inaugurated in 1882. In 1859, the central government decided to extinguish the parish of Paradinha and incorporate the lands into Moimenta da Beira. The Morais Sarmento clan protested this decision and forced the government to rethink the decision, allowing the civil parish to exist during the municipal reforms.

<text>Redonda is an uninhabited Caribbean island which is a dependency of Saint John, Antigua and Barbuda, in the Leeward Islands, West Indies. The island is about long, wide, and is high at its highest point.

It lies between the islands of Nevis and Montserrat, southwest of Antigua. Redonda is closer to Montserrat than to any other island; it is located northwest of Montserrat and southeast of Nevis.

Redonda is home to vast numbers of sea birds, and the island was an important source of guano before artificial fertilisers started to be mass-produced. Guano-mining operations started in the 1860s and ceased after the start of World War I. During the mining operations a few buildings and other installations were put in place on the island, and some physical remnants of that phase in its history are still visible.

&quot;Redonda&quot; is the feminine form of the Spanish language adjective meaning &quot;round&quot;. In 1493, on his second voyage to the New World, Christopher Columbus saw the island and named it &quot;Santa María la Redonda&quot; (the name in the Spanish language means &quot;Saint Mary the Round&quot;).

The island was annexed by the Antiguan Parish of Saint John on 26 March 1872.

==Description==

At a distance, Redonda appears as if it were one very large rock. It is the remnant of an ancient extinct volcano. The land rises from sea level mostly as sheer cliffs, especially on the leeward (west) side. At the top of the island there is a relatively flat but tilted area of grassland which slopes to the east. There is no source of fresh water other than rain.

Judging by the name he gave the island, to Columbus the island appeared to be rounded, at least in profile. In reality the island is long and narrow, and reaches a height of almost . The actual land area of the island is hard to estimate because of the extreme steepness of the slopes, but it is calculated to be somewhere between and .

Redonda is uninhabited. The difficult topography, the lack of a safe place to land a boat, and the absence of any freshwater source other than rainfall makes the island inhospitable to humans.

A herd of feral goats and thousands of rats were cleared from the island in 2017 as part of an island restoration programme.

==History==
In 1493, Christopher Columbus and his crew became the first known Europeans to see Redonda, on his second journey. He claimed it for the Crown of Castile, but did not land there. He named the island &quot;Santa María la Redonda&quot;, meaning Saint Mary the Round, reflecting the island&#x27;s apparent profile when viewed from the side.

As the island is a rock of just over a square kilometre, it did not represent any interest for the powers involved in the colonisation of the Americas and, for centuries, it was a refuge for pirates.

In the 1860s, the island became a British possession.

During the decades after the 1860s, the rich guano deposits of Redonda were mined for fertiliser, with an annual yield of up to 7,000 tons. Only during this time was the island inhabited by workers; the population was 120 in 1901. After the guano mining, aluminium phosphate for gunpowder production was discovered and mined. A cableway was constructed to transport material down to the loading pier on the coast.

In 1914, during the First World War, the mining operations ceased, and most workers left the island. Maintenance workers remained on the island until 1929, when a hurricane destroyed almost all the remaining facilities. The island has remained uninhabited since then. Two stone huts still stand from the time when the island was occupied. Although the closest island to Redonda is Montserrat, and the second closest is Nevis, in 1967 Redonda became a dependency of the more distant Antigua, now part of Antigua and Barbuda.

Scientists from the Montserrat Volcano Observatory visit the island in a helicopter periodically; they are using Redonda as an observation point from which to take measurements of the Soufrière Hills, an active volcano on Montserrat.

== Ecology and conservation ==
The island is a breeding colony for multiple species of seabirds. It has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports red-footed, brown and masked boobies, as well as magnificent frigatebirds.

Animals endemic to the island include the Redonda ground dragon, the Redonda anole and an unnamed species of dwarf gecko.

The island&#x27;s local ecology was severely affected by invasive species, particularly introduced goats and rats, for almost a century. Island restoration efforts were initiated in 2016, beginning with removing the island&#x27;s 60 goats and roughly 6,000 rats. The Redonda Restoration Programme involves the Environmental Awareness Group, Wildlife Management International and Fauna and Flora International. Several years after the goats were removed, some local plant life began to recover.

In September 2023, the Redonda Ecosystem Reserve was established, covering nearly of land and sea, making it the largest marine protected area in the region.

==Micronation==
Redonda is the setting for the myth of the &quot;Kingdom of Redonda&quot;. M. P. Shiel, an author of fantasy novels, claimed that in the year of his birth, 1865, his father Matthew Dowdy Shiell, from Montserrat, decided to celebrate his first male child by arranging for the boy to be crowned King of Redonda at the age of 15, in a ceremony purportedly carried out on the small island by a bishop.

Shiel first expressed the idea of the &quot;Kingdom of Redonda&quot; in a promotional leaflet for his books. Since then, the title has been &quot;passed down&quot;, and continues to the present day. For a period of time the &quot;Royal&quot; lineage of Redonda had a more or less solely literary theme, with the title being given to writers, such as John Gawsworth and Jon Wynne-Tyson. Wynne-Tyson (King Juan II), his successor the Spanish novelist Javier Marías (King Xavier), and rival contenders for the Redondan title, such as Gawsworth, William L. Gates and Bob Williamson, were featured in a BBC Radio 4 documentary, &quot;Redonda: The Island with Too Many Kings&quot;, which was broadcast in May 2007.

<text>John Brown (September 1, 1904 – November 14, 1974) was an American college football player and film actor billed as John Mack Brown at the height of his screen career. He acted and starred mainly in Western films.

==Early life==
Born and raised in Dothan, Alabama, Brown was the son of Ed and Mattie Brown, one of eight siblings. His parents were shopkeepers.

He was a star of the high school football team, earning a football scholarship to the University of Alabama. His little brother Tolbert &quot;Red&quot; Brown played with &quot;Mack&quot; in 1925.

===University of Alabama===
While at the University of Alabama, Brown became an initiated member of Kappa Sigma fraternity.

====Football====
Brown was a prominent halfback on his university&#x27;s Crimson Tide football team, coached by Wallace Wade. He earned the nickname &quot;The Dothan Antelope&quot; and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. Pop Warner called him &quot;one of the fastest football players I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot;
The 1924 team lost only to Centre. Brown starred in the defeat of Georgia Tech.

Brown helped the 1925 Alabama Crimson Tide football team to a national championship. In that year&#x27;s Rose Bowl, he earned Most Valuable Player honors after scoring two of his team&#x27;s three touchdowns in an upset win over the heavily favored Washington Huskies. The 1925 Crimson Tide was the first southern team to ever win a Rose Bowl. The game is commonly referred to as &quot;the game that changed the south.&quot; Brown was selected All-Southern.

====After college====
After he finished college, he sold insurance and later coached the freshman running backs on the University of Alabama&#x27;s football team.

==Film career==
=== Starting at the top ===
Brown&#x27;s good looks and powerful physique saw him portrayed on Wheaties cereal boxes and in 1927, brought an offer for motion picture screen tests that resulted in a long and successful career in Hollywood. That same year, he signed a five-year contract with Metro–Goldwyn–Mayer (MGM). He played silent film star Mary Pickford&#x27;s love interest in her first talkie, &quot;Coquette&quot; (1929), for which Pickford won an Oscar.
He appeared in minor roles until 1930 when he was cast as the star in a Western entitled &quot;Billy the Kid&quot; directed by King Vidor. An early widescreen film (along with Raoul Walsh&#x27;s &quot;The Big Trail&quot; starring John Wayne, produced the same year), the movie also stars Wallace Beery as Pat Garrett. Brown was billed over Beery, who would become MGM&#x27;s highest-paid actor within the next three years. Also in 1930, Brown played Joan Crawford&#x27;s love interest in &quot;Montana Moon&quot;. Brown went on to make several more top-flight movies under the name John Mack Brown, including &quot;The Secret Six&quot; (1931) with Wallace Beery, Jean Harlow, and Clark Gable, as well as the legendary Lost Generation celebration of alcohol, &quot;The Last Flight&quot; (1931), and was being groomed by MGM as a leading man until being abruptly replaced on &quot;Laughing Sinners&quot; in 1931, with all his scenes reshot, substituting rising star Clark Gable in his place. MGM and director Woody Van Dyke screen tested him for the lead role of &quot;Tarzan the Ape Man&quot; but Van Dyke did not feel he was tall enough.

=== Steep decline ===
Rechristened &quot;Johnny Mack Brown&quot; in the wake of this extremely serious career downturn, he made low-budget westerns for independent producers and he never regained his former status. Eventually he became one of the screen&#x27;s top B-movie cowboys, and became a popular star at Universal Pictures in 1937. After starring in four serials, in 1939 he launched a series of 29 B-westerns over the next four years, all co-starring Fuzzy Knight as his comic sidekick, and the last seven teaming him with Tex Ritter. This is considered the peak of his B-western career, thanks to the studio&#x27;s superior production values; noteworthy titles include &quot;Son of Roaring Dan&quot;, &quot;Raiders of San Joaquin&quot; and &quot;The Lone Star Trail&quot;, the latter featuring a young Robert Mitchum as the muscle heavy. A fan of Mexican music, Brown showcased the talents of guitarist Francisco Mayorga and The Guadalajara Trio in films like &quot;Boss of Bullion City&quot; and &quot;The Masked Rider&quot;. Brown also starred in a 1933 Mascot Pictures serial &quot;Fighting with Kit Carson&quot;, and four serials for Universal (&quot;Rustlers of Red Dog&quot;, &quot;Wild West Days&quot;, &quot;Flaming Frontiers&quot; and &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot;).
Brown moved to Monogram Pictures in 1943 to replace that studio&#x27;s cowboy star Buck Jones, who had died months before. Brown&#x27;s Monogram series was immediately successful and he starred in more than 60 westerns over the next 10 years, including a 20-movie series playing &quot;Nevada Jack McKenzie&quot; opposite Buck Jones&#x27;s (and earlier Wallace Beery&#x27;s) old sidekick Raymond Hatton, beginning with the 1943 film &quot;The Ghost Rider&quot;. Brown was also featured in two higher-budgeted dramas, &quot;Forever Yours&quot; and &quot;Flame of the West&quot;, both released by Monogram in 1945 and both billing the actor under his former &quot;A-picture&quot; name, John Mack Brown.

When Monogram abandoned its brand name in 1952 (in favor of its deluxe division, Allied Artists), Johnny Mack Brown retired from the screen. He returned more than 10 years later to appear in secondary roles in a few Western films. Altogether, Brown appeared in more than 160 movies between 1927 and 1966, as well as a smattering of television shows, in a career spanning almost 40 years.

==Personal life==
Brown was married to Cornelia &quot;Connie&quot; Foster from 1926 until his death in 1974, and they had four children.

==Recognition==
For his contributions to the film industry, Brown was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960 with a motion pictures star at 6101 Hollywood Boulevard. He received a posthumous Golden Boot Award in 2004 for his contributions to the Western entertainment genre. In 1969, Brown was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.

Brown&#x27;s hometown holds an annual Johnny Mack Brown Western Festival because “If anyone ever brought attention to Dothan, it was Johnny Mack Brown,” a city official said.

==In popular culture==
Brown is mentioned in the novel &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;. In a barracks scene, soldiers discuss Western films, and one asks, &quot;Remember Johnny Mack Brown?&quot;, resulting in a discussion.

From March 1950 to February 1959, Dell Comics published a &quot;Johnny Mack Brown&quot; series of comic books. He also was included in 21 issues of Dell&#x27;s &quot;Giant Series Western Roundup&quot; comics that began in June 1952.

In 1974, The Statler Brothers, performing as the fictitious Lester &quot;Roadhog&quot; Moran and the Cadillac Cowboys, released &quot;Alive at the Johnny Mack Brown High School&quot;, a comedy album set at an equally fictitious school named after Brown.

==Death==
Brown died in Woodland Hills, California, of heart failure at the age of 70. His cremated remains are interred in an outdoor Columbarium, in Glendale&#x27;s Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery.

<text>Riudoms () is a town in the &quot;comarca&quot; of Baix Camp, province of Tarragona, in Catalonia, Spain, located about five kilometres from the regional capital Reus.

The main product is the hazelnut, today in recession, and extra virgin olive oil.

==History== 
Riudoms was a Roman rural settlement (some archaeological remains and coins were discovered), that was depopulated when the Muslims dominated the region in the 8th century. Conquered by the Norman Robert d&#x27;Aguiló under the orders of the Catalan count, the lordship of Riudoms was granted to Arnau de Palomar on 24 January 1150. A castle was constructed and a town born at side.

This village is considered by some the birthplace of the architect Antoni Gaudí, designer of the Sagrada Família church in Barcelona and the most famous creator of the artistic movement known as Modernisme.

<text>MTV Drumscape (or &quot;Drumscape&quot;) is an arcade drum simulation made by Devecka Enterprises. First introduced in 1997, &quot;Drumscape&quot; resembles Karaoke for drums. Production of &quot;Drumscape&quot; stopped in 2001.

A number of celebrity drummers and musicians are pictured on the drumscape website either playing the game or posing with its creators.

==Gameplay==
The player sits in a booth before an array of electronic drum simulation pads. After selecting a song, the player hits the pads with a pair of drumsticks while a time meter counts down. The manufacturers recommend that arcade machines be set to a 2-minute and 15 second play-period costing $1. Unlike other music games, the player&#x27;s actions are not dictated by a set rhythm displayed onscreen, but rather the player plays as he sees fit. Additionally, &quot;Drumscape&quot; lacks a scoring system to indicate success or failure of a player. As the player drums, stage lights and crowd cheers are triggered to create a more realistic experience.

==Design==
&quot;Drumscape&quot; uses off the shelf components including a DTX drumset, amplifier, a standard computer (running the &quot;Drumscape&quot; menu software on its OS), a standard audio music player (such as CD system), and a standard VCR (not utilized in the final product). As claimed in its patent, it does not provide any cues for drumming.

==Reception==
&quot;Drumscape&quot; lacks a scoring system to indicate success or failure making it comparable to &quot;DDR DVD Game&quot;. For this reason, compared to drumming games like &quot;DrumMania&quot; it has seen comparatively lackluster success. While &quot;Drumscape&quot; claimed to be the only drum simulation game in North America (due to the U.S. patent, which extends into Canada), many arcades have imported &quot;DrumMania&quot; to much success. This put strong pressure on arcades insisting on treading the more legally safe path.

==Patents==
Devecka Enterprises has claimed that its patents cover not only drumming games but all music games (including but not limited to &quot;Guitar Freaks&quot;, &quot;Guitar Hero&quot;, &quot;Rock Band&quot;, and &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;), however because its concept is very basic and that prior non-patented MIDI drumsets have been used as training tools and as input, the patent&#x27;s validity has been called into question. Outside of the United States, Devecka&#x27;s patents have been successfully challenged due to these claims. Neither Devecka nor MTV, for example, have challenged Konami or other music game companies (such as Harmonix for its &quot;Rock Band&quot; series or Namco for its &quot;Taiko no Tatsujin&quot; drumming game).

Within the United States, Devecka Enterprises has attempted to bar the legal licensing of &quot;DrumMania&quot;, a competitive and similar product that is more in line with traditional arcade games due to its ability to assign a score for player performance. Devecka&#x27;s claim relies on its holding of the drum simulation game patent in the United States.

Devecka Enterprises president, John Devecka, is a consultant for Red Octane and Activision which now owns all of Devecka Enterprises&#x27; US and international patents and produces the Guitar Hero series.

<doc id="1025190" wikidata="Q1182783" url="?curid=1025190" title="Defeatism">
<text>Defeatism is the acceptance of defeat without struggle, often with negative connotations. It can be linked to pessimism in psychology, and may sometimes be used synonymously with fatalism or determinism.

==History==
The term &quot;defeatism&quot; is commonly used in politics as a descriptor for an ideological stance that considers cooperation with the opposition party. In the military context, in wartime, and especially on the front lines, &quot;defeatism&quot; is viewed as synonymous with treason.

Under military law, a soldier can be accused of being defeatist if the soldier refuses to fight by voicing doubt of the ideological validity of national policy; thus, existential questions such as &quot;Is the war already lost?&quot; and &quot;Is the fight worth the effort?&quot; are defeatism that connote advocacy of an alternative end to the war other than military victory.

===&quot;Defeatism&quot; in Nazi Germany===

Defeatism became a buzzword in Germany following its capitulation in 1918, particularly among the Nazi Party led by Adolf Hitler, who routinely blamed this loss on a &quot;defeatist mentality&quot;. After seizing power, his obsession with denouncing opponents for &quot;defeatism&quot; grew more acute as time went on, and was widely noted.

During World War II, Hitler unexpectedly dismissed many generals for defeatism. More prudent military commanders such as Field Marshal Albert Kesselring felt constrained to present the &quot;Führer&quot; a rosier account of the battlefront situation than was realistic, to avoid being labeled &quot;defeatist&quot;.

During the last year of war, the German Volksgerichtshof (&quot;people&#x27;s court&quot;) executed many people accused of defeatist talks or acts, and their names were announced weekly in a pink colored poster pasted on billboards around the country. In March 1945, as Red Army tanks were closing in on Berlin, Nazi officials worked feverishly to suppress &quot;cowardice and defeatism&quot; in their own ranks with summary death sentences.

== Revolutionary defeatism ==
Revolutionary defeatism is a related idea, made most prominent by Vladimir Lenin, that establishes that the proletariat cannot win or gain in a capitalist war. Instead, according to Lenin, the true enemy of the proletariat is the imperialist leaders who send their lower classes into battle. Workers would gain more from their own nations&#x27; defeats, he argued, if the war could be turned into civil war and then international revolution.

According to political scientist Baruch Knei-Paz, Leon Trotsky&#x27;s theory of &quot;permanent revolution&quot; was misrepresented by Stalin as defeatist and adventurist during the succession struggle; Knei-Paz writes that in fact Trotsky encouraged revolutions in Europe but did not propose &quot;reckless confrontations&quot; with the capitalist world.

<doc id="1025209" wikidata="Q7577080" url="?curid=1025209" title="Spiders (album)">
<text>Spiders is the debut album by English band Space, released on 16 September 1996. After signing to independent label Gut Records, the band recorded &quot;Spiders&quot; between 1995 and 1996 in Liverpool. The album combines a great wealth of styles and genres, including rock, hip hop, techno and funk. It was the result of the various musical tastes of the band members, with several songs containing several different styles within themselves. Many of the lyrics of the album, mostly written by vocalist Tommy Scott and inspired by films, are darkly humorous and largely story-driven, featuring numerous sadistic characters.

Upon release, the album peaked at #5 on the UK Albums Chart in September 1996, and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry in December 1996. &quot;Spiders&quot; peaked at #133 in Australia, #45 in New Zealand in May 1997, and #35 in Finland. &quot;Money&quot;, &quot;Kill Me&quot;, &quot;Neighbourhood&quot;, &quot;Female of the Species&quot;, &quot;Me and You Versus the World&quot; and &quot;Dark Clouds&quot; (the first two combined as a double A-side) were released as singles, though the former was re-recorded for the album. It sold an estimated 800,000 copies between 1996 and 1998. The album received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising its unique sound and lyrics, and has featured in polls of the best albums of all time.

==Background==
Space were formed in Liverpool in 1992 by vocalist and bass guitarist Tommy Scott, guitarist and co-vocalist Jamie Murphy and drummer Andy Parle and were initially inspired by The Kinks, Jimi Hendrix and The Who. Scott had been a familiar face on the Liverpool music circuit since the early 1980s; his first band, Hello Sunset, had been supported by an early line-up of The La&#x27;s. Scott and Murphy had previously performed together in The Substitutes before renaming the band Space. Although most of the band were in their mid-20s, Murphy was only 17, and turned up to the band&#x27;s first rehearsal session dressed in his school uniform. Space recorded their debut single, &quot;If It&#x27;s Real&quot;, to fulfill a publishing deal they had signed with BMG. It was released on 5 July 1993 as a 12&quot; single through Hug Records, set up by the band&#x27;s long-time manager and supporter Mark Cowley, with artwork designed by Carl Hunter of The Farm. However, the trio were unhappy with the results, feeling it sounded &#x27;generic&#x27; and too similar to other Liverpool bands at the time, and set out to find a new direction.

Whilst on tour, the band discovered the music of hip-hop group Cypress Hill, and quickly became attracted to their bass-driven grooves and use of sampling. Soon after, they decided to recruit Scott&#x27;s friend and former bandmember in Hello Sunset, Franny Griffiths, who at the time was living and working at a nightclub in Ibiza, in joining the band on keyboards and electronics, establishing the band&#x27;s trademark, multi-genre style. Although Griffiths was unimpressed by the demo tape that they had sent him, he agreed to join them on the condition that they start writing better material. According to Griffiths, he had to sell off his car in order to purchase his first sampler.

Successful indie label Gut Records (who previously had chart hits with Right Said Fred on their sub-label Tug) paid attention to the band and offered them a deal in January 1995. The label booked Space a session with producer and The KLF collaborator Nick Coler to record what was to be their first single &quot;Kill Me&quot;. The proposed B-side &quot;Money&quot;, which was recorded in their friend David &quot;Yorkie&quot; Palmer&#x27;s bedroom &quot;for the price of a £5 electricity card&quot; and mastered onto MiniDisc, proved the more popular choice by the label, so the two songs were released as the double A-side single &quot;Money / Kill Me&quot;, which was released in November that year through the sub-label Home. Although the single &quot;left the shops as quickly as it had entered.&quot;, it was received positively by the press and marked the start of the recording sessions for &quot;Spiders&quot;, with both songs reappearing on the album; however, &quot;Money&quot; was re-recorded.

==Recording==
The band recorded the entirety of &quot;Spiders&quot; in Parr Street Studios, Liverpool, between 1995 and 1996. Stephen Lironi produced the album, with the exception of &quot;Kill Me&quot; which was produced by Ian Richardson and Nick Coler, a song which was also mixed and engineered by Alan Douglas The other songs on the album were mixed by Jeremy Wheatley, who also engineered all the tracks except &quot;Neighbourhood&quot;, which was engineered by Andy Kowalski. Gerald Lynch performs as a guest percussionist on five of the album&#x27;s songs, with Tony Pierce providing trumpet on &quot;Dark Clouds&quot; and &quot;Charlie M&quot;. It was subsequently mixed in three London studios; Air Lyndhurst, Olympic Studios and Mayfair Studios.

Scott composed all of his songs for the album on bass guitar, namely a Framus 5/150 Star Bass and Vox Teardrop from the 1950s and 1960s. In 2018, Scott stated that he has a personal preference of using older instruments and equipment, saying &quot;I was against effects back then, to tell you the truth. I’m not into being retro for its own sake, but basically I just couldn’t be arsed pressing loads of pedals. My sound just needed to be dubby. I took all the treble right off the amps&quot;. An Ibanez fretless bass was used in the recording of &quot;Female of the Species&quot; to emulate a double bass, as according to Scott, &quot;it was the only way to get that sound. I was dead against it at first, because it seemed so naff and cheesy. At the time, only people who had their basses really high on their chests played those instruments&quot;.. &quot;Female of the Species&quot; was initially performed using a straight beat, until Griffiths came up with the idea to &quot;stick scratching samples and a hip-hop swing underneath the track&quot;. As such, in the studio&#x27;s basement, Parle, using only one microphone (&quot;the minimum of studio technology&quot;), &quot;merely bunged a load of delay on the resulting loop&quot;. David &quot;Yorkie&quot; Palmer sang backing vocals on &quot;Neighbourhood&quot;, although he had yet to officially join the band, though he assisted them in recording many of the album&#x27;s B-sides.

==Composition==
===Music===
&quot;Spiders&quot; was described by critics as disregarding genre, and displays influence from a large array of genres and styles, such as hip hop, &quot;brooding&quot; Eastern European folk music, funk, techno, indie dance and Hawaiian xylophone music. Parts of the album are said to echo British bands such as Squeeze, the Kinks, Madness and Buzzcocks as well as crooner Frank Sinatra and The Walker Brothers. According to &quot;Consumable Online&quot;, &quot;many of the tracks offer two or three completely distinct styles within four minutes of pop bliss.&quot; They described the album as &quot;why full albums were invented, instead of singles&quot; and said &quot;the only common thread&quot; between the tracks is their alternative pop sensibility. The magazine reckoned the closest comparison for &quot;Spiders&quot; would be the &quot;psychedelic dance beats of Shaun Ryder&#x27;s groups, Happy Mondays and Black Grape&quot;.

The album&#x27;s combining of rock and electronic elements has been described as &quot;a marriage in perfect harmony&quot; where &quot;the guitars don&#x27;t lead and the beats don&#x27;t overpower.&quot; The &quot;Daily Trojan&quot; described the balance as follows: &quot;The album smoothly flows from song to song with underlying guitars that accent the friendly techno beats provided by keyboard player Franny Griffiths. The effect is one that gives each song a distinct atmosphere while seldom giving away too much control to either techno or rock. Electronic blips are not overused and show up only to give songs more character.&quot; There are also found sound elements to the album; Parle explained: &quot;When we were in Hong Kong, we heard these children saying prayers, it was like a mad wailing sound. Straight away we got out a dictaphone and started taping it. If something&#x27;s going to make a track sound better we&#x27;ll use it. As long as it&#x27;s not contrived.&quot;

Although the band and the album have been considered Britpop, the band and several music critics have disavowed the connection to the genre; &quot;Consumable Online&quot; said the band &quot;bears relation to their Britpop neighbors only in their decidedly British accents and their country of origin&quot;. Similarly, &quot;Dotmusic&quot; said the band has &quot;never fitted into any of the post-Britpop guitar band moulds&quot;. Although the &quot;NME&quot; noted the band were seen as &quot;weirdly comic relief from Britpop and Noelrock,&quot; they also said they were &quot;as much, if not more, in keeping with a classic British pop lineage as any of those bands&quot;.&quot; One reviewer noted how the band were out &quot;to destroy retro-gazing Britpop from within&quot;.

===Lyrics===
The lyrics of the album are mostly written and sung by Scott, with five other songs written and sung by Murphy; the unusual lyrics have been described as &quot;blood-stained&quot; and &quot;writing madness&quot;. Scott said &quot;I get my ideas from Quentin Tarantino movies and Looney Tunes cartoons. We&#x27;ll never write ordinary love songs. We&#x27;re more likely to write &#x27;I met a girl and she&#x27;s in love with me so she poisoned my entire family&#x27;.&quot; Much of Scott&#x27;s childhood was spent watching violent American movies on television, which were an influence on the lyrics, but &quot;instead of just relying on the sadistic imagery,&quot; the band &quot;go for the full subversive effect by placing those images within the context of upbeat, chipper melodies&quot;. &quot;I see the songs I write as soundtracks for particular stories in my head,&quot; Scott said, &quot;Musically I like old stuff like Roy Orbison, and some new stuff like Tricky, but movies are the big thing for me. I&#x27;ve never really had heroes in music&quot;.

Scott commented that &quot;&#x27;tis one of life&#x27;s sweetest pleasures to see Space fans happily bop along whilst singing lines like &#x27;Kill me, kill me/Oh won&#x27;t you kill me,&#x27;&quot; adding that &quot;if the music sounded like some of the lyrics, I&#x27;d probably kill me-self. I like seeing your average grandmother or mum on the street singing along to &#x27;Mister Psycho&#x27; but not realizing she&#x27;s singing a song about a psychopath.&quot; Fearing some might misinterpret the lyrical intention, Scott affirmed &quot;it&#x27;s not done in a macho way. We&#x27;re not trying to be macho, saying that we&#x27;re tough. We&#x27;re not like that. I grew up on films, watching films, so that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s in me mind. All I&#x27;m doing is telling little stories.&quot; Griffiths explained, &quot;some of it&#x27;s like cartoon humour, where you get hit by that big mallet but still get up and walk away.&quot;

==Structure==
Opening song &quot;Neighbourhood&quot; is an &quot;exotically-flavoured show tune&quot; which features elements of &quot;spy theme music&quot; and a &quot;mish-mash of styles&quot;. The song&#x27;s lyrics concern of characters in the &quot;neighbourhood&quot; such as a &quot;local tranvestite&quot;, a serial killer vicar, &quot;the big butch queen&quot; and &quot;the folks who make a living off of crime - but are never there because they&#x27;re all doing time&quot;. &quot;Mister Psycho&quot; features &quot;bizarre faux-Spanish accents&quot;, whilst &quot;Female of the Species&quot; is an &quot;ode to a female lover who practices witchcraft&quot;. Andy Parle said &quot;I think we would all agree that females have more intelligence than males. And that&#x27;s what makes them more dangerous.&quot; The &quot;goofy number&quot; has been described as &quot;Burt Bacharach meets alternative lounge music&quot; which is &quot;sprinkled with some xylophones&quot; and contains a background of &quot;Mexican cha-chas&quot;. &quot;Money&quot; is an oom-pah-inspired track with a vocal delivery derived from Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;.

&quot;Me &amp; You Vs the World&quot;, with lyrics inspired by 1994 film &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot;, is said to emulate the &quot;early British pop of the 60&#x27;s in that same vein as the Kinks and Herman&#x27;s Hermits&quot;. Reviewer Todd Martens, who called it the &quot;most pop-infected tune on the album,&quot; described the song as a &quot;sweepingly cinematic coming-of-age tale about two star-crossed lovers turning to crime easily breaks free of conventional pop form without disrupting the song in the slightest. Scott lurches into a spoken-word verse when the narrator gets shot, and the music all but stops except for a hazy and slow pulsating techno throb. The guitars suddenly rise at just the right moment and turn the tune back into the catchy-as-heck pop melody that finishes with a couple happy to go to hell together.&quot;

&quot;Love Child of the Queen&quot;, a tongue-in-cheek guitar pop song, is the first of three consecutive tracks written and sung by Jamie Murphy. &quot;No-One Understands&quot; is a &quot;satirical lament&quot; according to Johnny Cigarettes of &quot;NME&quot;, which features &quot;overly mixed guitars&quot; which make the song &quot;maddeningly and engrossingly repetitive&quot;, whilst &quot;Voodoo Roller&quot; takes inspiration from the 1995 film &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;. &quot;Drop Dead&quot; is a funk rock track sung from the point of view of a celebrity stalker, whilst &quot;Dark Clouds&quot; is an ironic &quot;holiday siesta&quot; featuring a trumpet solo.&quot;

&quot;Major Pager&quot; concerns then-Prime Minister John Major &quot;selling E&#x27;s to the Russians&quot;, a lyric that made musical journalist Colin Larkin surprised that the band didn&#x27;t end up receiving litigation.&quot; &quot;Charlie M.&quot; is a &quot;Charles Manson fantasy&quot; which features &quot;Mickey Mouse screwing Minnie&quot;. The closing track, &quot;Growler&quot; is a techno instrumental composed and performed by Griffiths alone that uses a prominent voice sample of Cheech and Chong from the film &quot;Up in Smoke&quot;; writing of the track, &quot;Consumable Online&quot; said &quot;it doesn&#x27;t hit 160 beats a minute, but it could easily fit in at a rave. The album&#x27;s title track is a hidden track at the end of American editions of the album. The song concerns Scott&#x27;s girlfriend&#x27;s arachnophobia; Scott explained &quot;that song is about me girlfriend. Basically, I know that she&#x27;s terrified of spiders but if anyone, like say you come up and tried to hit me, she&#x27;d kill ya. She&#x27;s not frightened of anything in the world except spiders.&quot; Journalist Stuart Bernan explained &quot;that&#x27;s Tommy for ya, expressing his romantic side by playing on his girlfriend&#x27;s worst fear.&quot; &quot;Imprint&quot; magazine said the song offers &quot;some sound relationship advice which might not sit too well with any of Space&#x27;s male fans who value their testicles&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Spiders&quot; was released by Gut Records in the United Kingdom on 16 September 1996. In the United States, it was released by Gut and Universal Records on 14 January 1997. Scott chose to adorn the album artwork with numerous tarantulas, which also gives the album its title; he explained &quot;some people can&#x27;t even put the CD on the [player]. They have to get their friends to put on the CD for them. The reason we put it on the LP cover is simply just to test our fans, because we know there&#x27;s loads of people who are terrified by spiders, and if they really love us that much, they&#x27;ll still go out and buy it.&quot;

In the words of &quot;Dotmusic&quot;, &quot;Space&#x27;s idiosyncratic pop sensibility coupled with Gut&#x27;s marketing approach has proved to be a winning combination.&quot; The label was used to &quot;working with acts that don&#x27;t necessarily seek to conform&quot;, and, having started life as a plugging company, &quot;its reputation in this field has helped to harness Radio One support for the singles and secure TV appearances on shows such as Chris Evans&#x27; &quot;TFI Friday&quot;&quot;. Due to the small size of Gut, the entire label&#x27;s staff &quot;[pulled] out all stops&quot; for the album. Guy Holmes, managing director of Gut, was pleased with the album&#x27;s success; in late 1996 he stated &quot;it&#x27;s been brilliant, absolutely fantastic. It&#x27;s all about building a band properly without any hype and letting the records speak for themselves. With 120,000 albums sold, what more can you say?&quot;

In the United States, some pipped &quot;Spiders&quot; as a potential success in the advance of electronica, and especially rock bands that mixed electronica with rock instrumentation; in February 1997, the &quot;Daily Trojan&quot; commented that &quot;the electronic onslaught is underway, and if U2&#x27;s &quot;Pop&quot; successfully brings techno to mainstream rock audiences, Space deserves more than a cut of the crowd.&quot; The band were not expecting any American success, concerned that &quot;Spiders&quot; &quot;might sound too European&quot; due to &quot;its dance beats, fuzzy guitar, and singer Tommy Scott&#x27;s jaunty vocals&quot;. The album nonetheless found a small audience in the United States because of the band&#x27;s college radio following, with the band receiving heavy rotation on small American radio stations in early 1997, and &quot;Female of the Species&quot; being popular on MTV and college radio. The first 15,000 American copies came with a bonus disc featuring songs only released in the UK.

===Singles===
A year ahead of the album&#x27;s release, &quot;Money / Kill Me&quot; was released as a double A-side in November 1995, containing the original version of &quot;Money&quot;, but it did not chart and is considered by the band to be a &quot;test&quot; release and forerunner to the album&#x27;s official lead single, &quot;Neighbourhood&quot;, which was initially released on 25 March 1996 and only peaking at number 56 in the UK Singles Chart. Third single &quot;Female of the Species&quot;, released 27 May 1996, turned out to be the band&#x27;s breakthrough single, reaching number 14 in the UK charts and ultimately selling close to a million copies, despite originally being intended as a B-side. It was the band&#x27;s only entry on any music chart in the United States when it peaked at number 15 on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart in early 1997. In Australia, &quot;Female of the Species&quot; entered the ARIA top 100 singles chart on 11 May 1997, peaking at number 80 in June.

Released on 26 August 1996, &quot;Me and You Versus the World&quot; was the band&#x27;s first Top 10 hit in the UK, reaching number 9. &quot;Neighbourhood&quot; was then re-released on 21 October 1996, this time reaching number 11. In Australia, &quot;Neighbourhood&quot; entered the ARIA top 100 singles chart on 9 February 1997 at number 90. &quot;Neighbourhood&quot; peaked at number 22 in New Zealand in March 1997. &quot;Dark Clouds&quot; was the final single, released on 10 February 1997 and reaching number 14 in the UK charts.

The band insisted on recording original B-sides for the singles, &quot;a practice foreign to many commercially-focused American bands but popular with British groups&quot;. In an interview with &quot;The Tufts Daily&quot;, Parle said: &quot;When we release something, especially off the album, we know people are going to have that track from the album, and just putting that track out with a new mix of it, we think that&#x27;s a bit of cheating. So what we always do if we&#x27;re taking a track off the album, we go back in the studio and do two or three B-sides.&quot; Numerous unreleased songs, and remixes of songs from the album, were released as the double album &quot;Invasion of the Spiders&quot; on 3 November 1997.

==Reception==
A commercial success, spurred on by the success of it&#x27;s singles, &quot;Spiders&quot; reached number 5 on the UK Albums Chart and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry in December 1996 for sales of over 300,000 copies. A strong seller for a year after its release, it spent 54 weeks on the chart. The album also peaked at number 133 in Australia, number 45 in New Zealand in May 1997, and number 35 in Finland. The album was also successful in Asia. The band&#x27;s best-selling album, &quot;Spiders&quot; sold an estimated 800,000 copies between 1996 and 1998.

&quot;Spiders&quot; was also a critical success, with critics praising its unique sound and unusual lyrics. In the United Kingdom, the band received praise from popular music magazines, including &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;Select&quot;. The &quot;NME&quot; rated the album seven out of ten and said &quot;Space are worthy of a superlative that is all too rare in new British pop right now. No, not &#x27;novelty&#x27;. Just &#x27;unique&#x27;.&quot; The reviewer found it unusual for a Northwest band to employ &quot;wit, irony and humour&quot;.

The album was also well received by American critics. Todd Martens of the &quot;Daily Trojan&quot; said that &quot;almost every track on this album contains something worth admiring.&quot; Jonathan Dale of the &quot;UWO Gazette&quot; said that, &quot;regardless of what the interpretation is, Space creates original sounds that, despite the images surrounding it, will always remain witty, whimsical pop that everyone deserves to hear...despite certain phobias.&quot;

Later commentary on the album has also been positive. Alex Henderson of AllMusic, in a retrospective review, was largely favourable, calling it &quot;quirky and often highly clever&quot; and &quot;one of the most appealing alternative rock releases of 1996&quot;. He praised their &quot;enjoyably twisted sense of humour&quot; and said that, although &quot;the rockers can be overly self-indulgent,&quot; Space, &quot;like Frank Zappa and George Clinton, generally use their eccentricity advantageously&quot;. The album was highlighted as an &quot;Album Pick&quot; on the website. Writer Colin Larkin rated the album three stars out of five in his 2000 book &quot;The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music&quot;.

==Legacy==
The album has been features in critics&#x27; lists of the best albums of 1996 and in some cases of all time. At the end of 1996, &quot;Select&quot; ranked &quot;Spiders&quot; at number 23 in their list of the best albums of the year. The album also ranked 9th in &quot;NME&quot;&#x27;s readers poll of the 10 best albums of 1996. In 1997, the album ranked 77th in Virgin Megastores&#x27; &quot;Chart of the Century&quot; poll of the 100 greatest albums of all time. In 1998, the album ranked 551st in the updated version of the book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;, a list of the greatest albums of all time that was the result of over 200,000 votes cast by informed music lovers and ranked in order. In 2017, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked &quot;Spiders&quot; at number 41 in their list of &quot;The 50 Best Britpop Albums&quot;.

&quot;Female of the Species&quot; has also featured in critics&#x27; lists. &quot;Select&quot; named it the 6th best single of 1996. It also ranked at number 40 in &quot;NME&quot;&#x27;s list of the top 50 singles of 1996, and &quot;The Face&quot; ranked it at number 9 in their own list of 1996&#x27;s 50 greatest singles. &quot;Les Inrockuptibles&quot; also included in their list of 1996&#x27;s greatest singles, as did &quot;Iguana&quot;, who ranked it 39th in their top 50 list. It ranked number 75 in the Triple J poll of the best songs of 1997. In 2013, &quot;NME&quot; ranked it at number 84 in their list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Britpop Songs&quot;. The track was chosen by producer Christine Langan after she heard it on &quot;The Chart Show&quot;.

Having never been re-released, in 2014, &quot;NME&quot; included &quot;Spiders&quot; in its list of &quot;30 Glorious Britpop Albums That Deserve a Reissue Pronto,&quot; with one reviewer commenting: &quot;Just reel off those beauties – &#x27;Neighbourhood&#x27;, &#x27;Me and You vs the World&#x27;, &#x27;Female of the Species&#x27; – it&#x27;s imperative that a new generation of kids hears these songs. A group of rough and ready Scousers with deathless melodies to burn, Space could’ve been the new Beatles if anyone had thought to make that comparison.&quot; In 2016, a limited edition picture disc vinyl of the album was made available on Record Store Day, 20 years after its original release. For its 25th anniversary in 2021, the album was once again reissued on yellow-coloured vinyl. Mister Psycho and Growler, two combat robots that were introduced in the sixth series of &quot;Robot Wars&quot;, took their names after songs from the album.

===Touring and aftermath===
Space played several prolific festivals in this era, and numerous shows that were well received by British critics. A concert played by the band in Dublin in November 1996 was attended by Universal Records staff and their guests; it was integral in the label singing the band in the United States. After the minor success of &quot;Spiders&quot; and especially &quot;Female of the Species&quot; in the United States, Space toured the US in mid-1997. However, the tour was marked with numerous problems. The band were constantly under stress, and such was its extent that Griffiths developed an ulcer, Scott lost his voice and Murphy, &quot;still only 21, simply lost it completely and had a spell in psychiatric care being fed anti-depressants and milk,&quot; whilst Parle eventually left the band, being replaced by Leon Caffrey soon afterwards. After his cameo on &quot;Spiders&quot;, David &quot;Yorkie&quot; Palmer joined the band in late 1997 as a bassist, but the death of his mother, popular Liverpudlian singer Gladys Palmer, came as a devastation to the band.

Murphy&#x27;s personal problems led to him missing some of the band&#x27;s live shows and television appearances, with manager Mark Cowley often filling in during his absence. It was widely rumoured that he depressingly watched Space perform &quot;Dark Clouds&quot; on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on television, one of the performances he missed, although in fact he was preoccupied with other things and &quot;actually forgotten the single was even out&quot;. Scott was terrified that his singing voice was permanently lost, as the cause with originally unknown; he underwent cancer treatment to make sure, but found out his voice was lost due to stress, and he soon recovered. Murphy also soon recovered and rejoined the band in time for the recording of their second album, &quot;Tin Planet&quot;.

<doc id="1025213" wikidata="Q2864353" url="?curid=1025213" title="Ars Nova (Japanese band)">
<text>Ars Nova is a Japanese progressive rock band. The band members are Keiko Kumagai (keyboards), Shinko &quot;Panky&quot; Shibata (bass guitar), Hazime (drums) and Satoshi Handa (guitar).

Ars Nova&#x27;s music features a heavy use of keyboards — this was particularly true between 1998 and 2003 when the band had two keyboard players. Common sounds include the ubiquitous Hammond organ, as well as more recent digital sounds. Almost all of their music is instrumental.

The band&#x27;s musical influences are ELP, Goblin, PFM, Rick Wakeman, Balletto di Bronzo and classical music. Kumagai, the keyboard player, writes all of the band&#x27;s compositions. She has played on the Ayreon album &quot;Universal Migrator Part 2: Flight of the Migrator&quot; (2000). For much of its history (until Hazime and more recently Handa joined), the band was all-female, unusual in the world of progressive rock.

== Band history ==
Ars Nova was formed in 1983 by Kyoko Kanazawa (bass guitar), Keiko Tsubata (keyboards) and Yumiko Saito (drums). The band covered bands such as ELP and Trace. In 1986, Tsubata left the band. Keiko Kumagai replaced her and played two gigs with the band before leaving for personal reasons.

In 1991, the band was reformed with Keiko Kumagai on the keyboards. In 1992, the band released &quot;Fear and Anxiety&quot;. The following year, in 1993, Saito was replaced by Akiko Takahashi on the drums.

In 1994, their second album, &quot;Tränsi&quot;, was released. It allowed the band to be known outside Japan. In 1995, Ars Nova played a gig for the first time outside Japan, at the &quot;Prog Fest &#x27;95&quot; festival in Los Angeles, USA.

In 1996, their third album, &quot;The Goddess of Darkness&quot;, was released and in 1997 they played their first gigs in Europe. Kyoko Kanazawa left the band in October.

In 1998, the album, &quot;The Book of the Dead&quot;, was released with guest bass guitarist, Ken Ishita (ex-Deja Vu). A world tour began in October with Naomi Miura as a second keyboard player and bass guitar replacement.

&quot;Android Domina&quot; was released in 2001, with Mika Nakajima as a second keyboard player, followed in 2003 by &quot;Biogenesis Project&quot;, an album featuring numerous guest musicians, including Masuhiro Goto (Gerard, Ningen-Isu), who became the new drummer of the band, replacing Takahashi. Nakajima also left the band and was replaced by the bass guitarist Shinko Shibata. Satoshi Handa began playing as a guest for live gigs later in the year.

In 2005, drummer Goto left the band and was replaced by Hazime. Handa became a member of the band and played on the next studio album.

On 12 June 2022, the group announced on their website that a new album was in production. These are recordings already made in 1996 by the original trio (Kumagai, Kanazawa, Takahashi) and are complemented by current productions together with the two guest musicians Hitomi Iriyama (violin) and Zoltán Fábián (guitar). Other contributors are: Sayuri Aruga (vocals), Mika Nakajima (keyboard), Satoshi Handa (guitar), Hazime (drums), Akiko Takahashi (percussion). The new album is to be called &quot;Morgan 2021&quot;.

<text>The Antonov An-3 is a Soviet (later Ukrainian and Russian) civil multipurpose and agricultural aircraft. It is essentially a turboprop-powered development of the An-2, designed to upgrade or replace it. The basic transport version (An-3T) is supplemented by a cargo/passenger version (An-3TK), an agricultural version (An-3SH), a forest fire-fighting version (An-3P), as well as an ambulance version. It is designed to carry passengers and cargo, operating from paved or unpaved airfields, including snow covered surfaces up to deep (using a ski landing gear).

== Upgrading ==

The upgrading consisted of replacement of the piston engine with a TVD-20 turboprop engine, featuring a three-blade reversible pitch (type AV-17) propeller and a R-17 speed governor. The flight compartment was rearranged; a heating and ventilation system was installed as well as advanced electric and flight and navigation equipment; centralized warning system; a new fire extinguishing system; and an improvement of the external wide-spreading dispensing equipment for agricultural needs. The upgrades allowed the aircraft to be more reliable and to increase the cargo lifting capacity of the aircraft by 20%, as well as ensuring more comfortable conditions for the crew, including the lowering of the noise and vibration inside the cockpit. The rate of climb was increased by 1.9 times, and the take-off and landing performance of the aircraft was increased. The upgrading allowed the use of kerosene and lubricants commonly used for other aircraft instead of gasoline. The take-off weight and payload was also increased and the upgrade allowed the landing performance to use ground strips long. The upgrading was arranged at both the &quot;Polyot&quot; Production Association in Omsk, Russian Federation, and at Antonov ASTC, Kyiv, Ukraine.

The first example flew as early as May 13, 1980, but because of a lack of official interest in the project, work proceeded very slowly. Flight testing was not complete until 1991. It is one of the few turbine-powered biplane designs to date. The An-3T received its Type Certificate on 31 August 2000. Supplements to the Type Certificate included version with ski landing gear and an agricultural version.

== Variants ==

The project was revitalised in the late 1990s when it was taken over by Polyot State Aerospace Enterprise, and a marketing campaign began in earnest in 2000, although sales have been limited. It is available in four forms, the basic transport version (An-3T), the convertible cargo/passenger able to carry 12 passengers or of cargo (An-3TK)k the agricultural aircraft (An-3SH—&quot;Selsko-Khosiajstwenni&quot;) and the fire-fighting version (An-3P).

Another attempt to replace the An-2 on Soviet farms was made in the 1970s with the WSK-Mielec M-15 Belphegor, but it failed.

From 2007, the &quot;Polyot&quot; Production Association started to upgrade the first ten An-2s of the Russian Airborne Troops to An-3T-10 standard. The overall requirement is estimated at approximately 200 aircraft.

== Specifications (An-3T) ==



== Accidents and incidents ==

<doc id="1025220" wikidata="Q442250" url="?curid=1025220" title="Ruth Buzzi">
<text>Ruth Ann Buzzi ( ; born July 24, 1936) is a retired American actress and comedienne. She has appeared on stage, in films, and on television. She is best known for her performances on the comedy-variety show &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; from 1968 to 1973, for which she won a Golden Globe Award and received five Emmy nominations.

==Early life==
Buzzi was born at Westerly Hospital, Westerly, Rhode Island, the daughter of Rena Pauline and Angelo Peter Buzzi, a nationally recognized stone sculptor. Her father, who came from a Swiss family, immigrated from Arzo, Switzerland in 1923. She was raised in the village of Wequetequock in the town of Stonington, Connecticut, in a stone house overlooking the ocean at Wequetequock Cove, where her father owned Buzzi Memorials, a business that her older brother Harold operated until his retirement in 2013.

Buzzi attended Stonington High School, where she was head cheerleader. At 17, she enrolled at the Pasadena Playhouse College of Theatre Arts, from which she graduated with honors in June 1957.

==Career==

===Early successes===
Before graduation from college, Buzzi was already a working union actress performing in musical and comedy revues. Her first job in show business was at 19, traveling with singer Rudy Vallee in a live musical and comedy act during her summer break from college; it allowed her to graduate with an Actors&#x27; Equity Association union card. She moved to New York City after graduation and was hired immediately for a lead role in an off-Broadway musical revue, the first of 19 in which she performed around the East Coast. She worked alongside other young performers just beginning their careers at the time, including Barbra Streisand, Joan Rivers, Dom DeLuise, Bernadette Peters, and Carol Burnett. She performed in New York musical variety shows, and she made numerous television commercials, some of which won national awards including the Clio Award.

Her first national recognition on television came on &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot; in 1964, just after Carol Burnett was replaced by Dorothy Loudon on the series. She performed as &quot;Shakundala the Silent&quot;, a bumbling magician&#x27;s assistant to her comedy partner Dom DeLuise, who played &quot;Dominic the Great&quot;. Buzzi was a member of the regular repertory company on the CBS variety show &quot;The Entertainers&quot; (1964–65). In 1966–67, she appeared in &quot;Sweet Charity&quot; with Bob Fosse&#x27;s wife Gwen Verdon in the original cast. She had several small roles, including &quot;the Singing Fairy&quot;.

===On &quot;Laugh-In&quot; and related work===
In 1967, Buzzi appeared in all eight episodes of &quot;The Steve Allen Comedy Hour&quot;, a variety series starring Steve Allen. Her character parts in the Allen sketches led her to be cast for NBC&#x27;s new show &quot;Rowan and Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;. She was the only featured player to appear in every episode of &quot;Laugh-In&quot; including the pilot for the show and the &quot;Laugh-In&quot; television special. Among her recurring characters on &quot;Laugh-In&quot; were Flicker Farkle, youngest of the Farkle family; Busy-Buzzi, a Hedda Hopper-type Hollywood gossip columnist; Doris Swizzler, a cocktail-lounge habituée who always got smashed with husband Leonard (Dick Martin); and one of the Burbank Airlines Stewardesses, inconsiderate flight attendants.

Her most famous character was &quot;spinster&quot; Gladys Ormphby, clad in drab brown with her bun hairdo covered by a visible hairnet knotted in the middle of her forehead. Buzzi first used this look when she played Agnes Gooch in a school production of &quot;Auntie Mame&quot;. In most sketches, she used her purse as a weapon, with which she would flail away vigorously at anyone who incurred her wrath. She most often was the unwilling object of the advances of Arte Johnson&#x27;s &quot;dirty old man&quot; character Tyrone F. Horneigh. NBC collectively called these two characters &quot;The Nitwits&quot; when they went to animation in the mid-1970s as part of the series &quot;Baggy Pants and the Nitwits&quot;. Buzzi and Johnson both voiced their respective roles in the cartoon.

Buzzi was featured as Gladys in many of the Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts from the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, ranting about notable roastees including Muhammad Ali, Frank Sinatra, and Lucille Ball. In each case, Gladys pugnaciously attacked the honoree with her purse, and she would also hit Martin when he made disparaging remarks about her looks and her romantic prospects.

===Continued success on television===
Buzzi was featured as a semi-regular on the comedy &quot;That Girl&quot; as Marlo Thomas&#x27;s friend Margie &quot;Pete&quot; Peterson. She starred with Jim Nabors as the time-traveling androids Fi and Fum in &quot;The Lost Saucer&quot; produced by Sid and Marty Krofft which aired from September 11, 1975, until September 2, 1976 (16 episodes).

In 1979, she co-starred on the Canadian children&#x27;s comedy show &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television&quot; (also known as &quot;Whatever Turns You On&quot;).

Buzzi also guest-starred as Chloe, the wife of phone company worker Henry Beesmeyer (Marvin Kaplan) on &quot;Alice&quot; in 1981. She was also a guest star on &quot;Down to Earth&quot; in 1985. Dean Martin&#x27;s producer Greg Garrison hired her for his comedy specials starring Dom DeLuise. She recorded the single &quot;You Oughta Hear The Song&quot; in 1977 which reached number 90 on Billboard&#x27;s national Country Music chart; Buzzi joked in 2022 in hindsight: &quot;Here&#x27;s a medley of my hit song: I&#x27;d like to thank the millions and millions of you who didn&#x27;t buy a copy. I got to spend quality time at home in &#x27;78 instead of standing in front of all those aggravating audiences.&quot;

Buzzi was a guest star on many television series, including &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot;, &quot;The Flip Wilson Show&quot;, &quot;The Dean Martin Music and Comedy Hour&quot;, the Dean Martin Roasts, &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, &quot;Tony Orlando and Dawn&quot;, &quot;The Monkees&quot;, &quot;Emergency!&quot;, and variety series hosted by Leslie Uggams and by Glen Campbell. She also appeared occasionally on game shows and was a celebrity judge on &quot;The Gong Show&quot;. She appeared in Lucille Ball&#x27;s last comedy &quot;Life with Lucy&quot; as Mrs. Wilcox in the episode &quot;Lucy Makes a Hit with John Ritter&quot;. She appeared eight times on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; and has made more than 200 other television guest appearances.

Buzzi voiced the character Nose Marie in the Hanna-Barbera animated series &quot;Pound Puppies&quot; (1986). She also voiced Mama Bear in &quot;Berenstain Bears&quot; (1985) and performed hundreds of guest voices for many other cartoon series, including &quot;The Smurfs&quot;, &quot;The Angry Beavers&quot;, and Mo Willems&#x27; &quot;Sheep in the Big City&quot;.

She joined the cast of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in 1993 as shopkeeper, Ruthie, as part of the Around the Corner set expansion. Ruthie ran Finders Keepers, which sold items previously owned by fairy tale and nursery rhyme characters. After the set was removed in 1999 she continued to appear on the show in inserts, usually in costume as other characters. She also voiced Suzie Kabloozie and her pet cat, Feff in animated inserts that were shown on the show from 1994 to 2008. She reprised her role as Ruthie in &quot;Sesame Street Stays Up Late&quot;, &quot;Sesame Street&#x27;s All Star 25th Birthday: Stars and Street Forever&quot; and &quot;Elmopalooza&quot; as well as the direct-to-video production, The Best of Elmo and the feature film &quot;The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland&quot;.

Buzzi performed in numerous national television commercials, most notably for Clorox 2, Clairol, Ban roll-on deodorant, and Santa Anita Park, and she voiced Granny Goodwitch in television commercials for Sugar Crisp cereal. She originated the Goodwitch character in the animated TV series &quot;Linus the Lionhearted&quot; (1964–65).
Buzzi appeared in the &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic video &quot;Gump&quot; and similarly appeared in other music videos with the B-52&#x27;s and the Presidents of the United States of America. She appeared on &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;, &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, two episodes of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television&quot; in 1979 (as well as the entire run of the &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That On Television&quot;&#x27;s spinoff &quot;Whatever Turns You On&quot;), and numerous other television shows. She played the role of the eccentric Nurse Kravitz on NBC&#x27;s daytime soap opera &quot;Passions&quot;. In 2006 and 2007, she made guest appearances on the children&#x27;s TV series &quot;Come on Over&quot;.

Buzzi had a successful nightclub act across the United States, including at Las Vegas&#x27;s Sahara and at the MGM Grand hotels. She performed the act for one year. Her shows all sold out and she was reportedly offered an extended stay but declined.

She had featured roles in more than 20 films, including &quot;Chu Chu and the Philly Flash&quot;, &quot;Freaky Friday&quot;, &quot;The North Avenue Irregulars&quot;, &quot;The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again&quot;, &quot;The Villain&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland&quot;, and a number of westerns for the European market known as the Lucky Luke series in which she plays the mother of the Dalton Gang.

In 2021, she announced on her social media account that she officially retired from acting.

==Personal life and health==
Buzzi is a charter member of the Pasadena Playhouse Alumni Association. She paints as a hobby; she has never offered her oil paintings for sale to the public, but has donated original works to charity, where they have sold in excess of $6,000.

Buzzi supports numerous children&#x27;s charities, including Make a Wish Foundation, Special Olympics, the Thalians, St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital, and Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, and she is a children&#x27;s art summer camp sponsor through Dallas Museum of Biblical Art. She is active in fund raising for the Utopia Animal Rescue Ranch in Medina, Texas and other animal causes.

Buzzi lives with her husband, actor Kent Perkins, on a cattle and horse ranch near Stephenville, Texas. They are avid automobile collectors. Their collection focuses on post-war English vehicles, including Bentley, Rolls-Royce, and Jaguar, although it also includes several American convertibles and muscle cars. Some of her vehicles have been in television commercials and featured in parades, and her blue Bentley convertible was featured on the cover of &quot;Vogue&quot; with Jessica Simpson behind the wheel. Some of their cars have been donated or lent to the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles including a red, fuel-injected 1957 Chevrolet convertible that was exhibited from 1993 to 2011 as part of the display honoring the cars of Steve McQueen. Buzzi&#x27;s 1960 Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud drophead coupe convertible was on display for the &quot;Century of Elegance&quot; exhibit.

Buzzi has been named in numerous songs, including House of Pain&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m A Swing It&quot;, The Bled&#x27;s &quot;Ruth Buzzi Better Watch Her Back&quot;, and the Loretta Lynn/Conway Twitty duet &quot;You&#x27;re the Reason Our Kids Are Ugly&quot;.

In July 2022, it was reported that Buzzi had suffered a series of strokes and was improving.
