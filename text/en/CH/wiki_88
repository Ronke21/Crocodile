<text>Ship breaking (also known as ship recycling, ship demolition, ship scrapping, ship dismantling, or ship cracking) is a type of ship disposal involving the breaking up of ships either as a source of parts, which can be sold for re-use, or for the extraction of raw materials, chiefly scrap. Modern ships have a lifespan of 25 to 30 years before corrosion, metal fatigue and a lack of parts render them uneconomical to operate. Ship-breaking allows the materials from the ship, especially steel, to be recycled and made into new products. This lowers the demand for mined iron ore and reduces energy use in the steelmaking process. Fixtures and other equipment on board the vessels can also be reused. While ship-breaking is sustainable, there are concerns about its use by poorer countries without stringent environmental legislation. It is also labour-intensive, and considered one of the world&#x27;s most dangerous industries.

In 2012, roughly 1,250 ocean ships were broken down, and their average age was 26 years. In 2013, the world total of demolished ships amounted to 29,052,000 tonnes, 92% of which were demolished in Asia. As of January 2020, Alang Ship Breaking Yard in India has the largest global share at 30%, followed by Chittagong Ship Breaking Yard in Bangladesh and Gadani Ship Breaking Yard in Pakistan.

The largest sources of ships are China, Greece, and Germany, although there is greater variation in the sources of carriers versus their disposal. The ship-breaking yards of India, Bangladesh, China and Pakistan employ 225,000 workers as well as providing many indirect jobs. In Bangladesh, the recycled steel covers 20% of the country&#x27;s needs and in India it is almost 10%.

As an alternative to ship breaking, ships may be sunk to create artificial reefs after legally mandated removal of hazardous materials (though this does not recycle any materials), or sunk in deep ocean waters. Storage is a viable temporary option, whether on land or afloat, though most ships will eventually be scrapped; some will be sunk, or preserved as museums.

==History==
Wooden-hulled ships were simply set on fire or &quot;conveniently sunk&quot;. In Tudor times (1485–1603), ships were dismantled and the timber re-used. This procedure was no longer applicable with the advent of metal-hulled boats in the 19th century.

In 1880 Denny Brothers of Dumbarton used forgings made from scrap maritime steel in their shipbuilding. Many other nations began to purchase British ships for scrap by the late 19th century, including Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Japan. The Italian industry started in 1892, and the Japanese industry after the passing of an 1896 law to subsidise native shipbuilding.

After suffering damage or disaster, liner operators did not want the name of a broken ship to tarnish the brand of their passenger services. Many Victorian ships made their final voyages with the final letter of their name chipped off.

In the 1930s it became cheaper to &quot;beach&quot; a boat by running her ashore—as opposed to using a dry dock. The ship would have to weigh as little as possible and would run ashore at full speed. Dismantling operations required a rise of tide and close proximity to a steel-works. Electric shears, a wrecking ball and oxy-acetylene torches were used. The technique of the time closely resembles that used in developing countries . Thos. W. Ward Ltd., one of the largest breakers in the United Kingdom in the 1930s, would recondition and sell all furniture and machinery. Many historical artifacts were sold at public auctions: the Cunarder , sold as scrap for , received high bids for her fittings worldwide. However, any weapons and military information, even if obsolete, were carefully removed by Navy personnel before turning over the ship for scrapping.

In 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic crippled the cruise ship trade, cruise vessels began to appear more frequently in ship breaking facilities.

===Location trends ===
Until the late 20th century the majority of ship breaking activity took place in the port cities of industrialized countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States. those dismantlers that still remain in the United States work primarily on government-surplus vessels.

Starting in the mid-20th century, East Asian countries with lower labour costs began to dominate ship-breaking. As labour costs rose, centres of the ship-breaking industry moved—initially from countries such as Japan and Hong Kong, to Korea and Taiwan and then to China. For example, the southern port city of Kaohsiung in Taiwan operated as the world&#x27;s leading dismantling site in the late 1960s and 1970s, breaking up 220 ships totaling 1.6 million tons in 1972 alone; in 1977 Taiwan continued to dominate the industry with more than half the market share, followed by Spain and Pakistan. At the time, Bangladesh had no capacity at all. However, the sector is volatile and fluctuates wildly, and Taiwan processed just two ships 13 years later as wages across East Asia rose. For comparison, depending on their profession, shipbreakers in Kaohsiung earned from (day labourer) to (torch operator) per day in 1973.

In 1960, after a severe cyclone, the Greek ship &quot;M D Alpine&quot; was stranded on the shores of Sitakunda, Chittagong (then part of East Pakistan). It could not be re-floated and so remained there for several years. In 1965 the Chittagong Steel House bought the ship and had it scrapped. It took years to scrap the vessel, but the work gave birth to the industry in Bangladesh.
Until 1980 the Gadani Ship Breaking Yard of Pakistan was the largest ship breaking yard in the world.

Tightening environmental regulations resulted in increased hazardous waste disposal costs in industrialised countries in the 1980s, causing the export of retired ships to lower-income areas, chiefly in South Asia. This, in turn, created a far worse environmental problem, subsequently leading to the Basel Convention of 1989. In 2004 a Basel Convention decision officially classified old ships as &quot;toxic waste&quot;, preventing them from leaving a country without the permission of the importing state. This has led to a resurgence of recycling in environmentally compliant locations in developed countries, especially in former shipbuilding yards.

On 31 December 2005 the French Navy&#x27;s left Toulon to be dismantled at the Alang Ship Breaking Yard, India—despite protests over improper disposal capabilities and facilities for the toxic wastes. On 6 January 2006 the Supreme Court of India temporarily denied access to Alang, and the French &quot;Conseil d&#x27;État&quot; ordered &quot;Clemenceau&quot; to return to French waters. Able UK in Hartlepool received a new disassembly contract to use accepted practices in scrapping the ship. The dismantling started on 18 November 2009 and the break-up was completed by the end of 2010; the event was considered a turning point in the treatment of redundant vessels. Europe and the United States have had a resurgence in ship scrapping since the 1990s.

In 2009 the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association won a legal case prohibiting all substandard ship breaking. For 14 months the industry could not import ships and thousands of jobs were lost before the ban was annulled. That same year, the global recession and lower demand for goods led to an increase in the supply of ships for decommissioning. The rate of scrapping is inversely correlated to the freight price, which collapsed in 2009.

==Technique==
The decommissioning process is entirely different in developed countries than it is in third world countries. In both cases, ship-breakers bid for the ship, and the highest bidder wins the contract. The ship-breaker then acquires the vessel from the international broker who deals in outdated ships. The price paid is approximately $400 per tonne; regions with more lax environmental legislation typically can offer higher prices. For the industry in Bangladesh, 69% of revenue is spent on purchasing vessels; only 2% is labour costs. The ship is taken to the decommissioning location either under its own power or with the use of tugs.

=== Developing countries ===

In developing countries, chiefly the Indian subcontinent, ships are run ashore on gently sloping sand tidal beaches at high tide so that they can be accessed for disassembly. In the beaching method, no external source of energy is used to pull the ship, as opposed to the dry dock method of ship recycling where a ship is floated into the dry dock using a substantial amount of energy. However, maneuvering a large ship onto a beach at high speed takes skill and daring even for a specialist captain, and is not always successful. Next, the anchor is dropped to steady the ship and the engine is shut down. It takes 50 labourers about three months to break down a normal-sized cargo vessel of about 40,000 tonnes.

Before the decommissioning begins, various clearances and permissions are obtained from regulatory, pollution and customs authorities after a thorough inspection is conducted by them. The ship recycling process then begins with the draining of fuel, hydraulic fluid, coolant, lubricating oils and firefighting liquid which may be disposed of or sold to the trade. Any reusable fixtures are sold to the trade. Any kind of waste such as plastic, garbage, or oily sand is sent to waste treatment facilities, like the Common Hazardous Waste Treatment Storage Disposal Facility (CHW-TSDF) set up by the Gujarat Maritime Board in Alang. Any usable oil is sent to government authorized refineries where used oil is chemically treated. The next steps entail recovering unused and partially spent materials, disposal of bilge water, recovering and obtaining reusable materials, and safe disposal of bio-hazardous materials like asbestos and glass wool. Each of these materials are inspected and sent to regulated waste treatment facilities or to buyers for further use and processing.

In recycling yards in the Indian subcontinent, specifically in Alang, upgraded facilities such as 100% impervious floors with drainage systems, heavy-lift cranes, yard and vessel-specific training for workers, and the development and implementation of Ship Recycling Facility Plans and Ship Recycling Plans (as per IMO&#x27;s guidelines in Resolutions MEPC.210(63) and MEPC.196(62)) have been implemented.

=== Developed countries ===
In developed countries the dismantling process mirrors the technical guidelines for the environmentally sound management of the full and partial dismantling of ships, published by the Basel Convention in 2003. Recycling rates of 98% can be achieved in these facilities.

Prior to dismantling, an inventory of dangerous substances is compiled. All hazardous materials and liquids, such as bilge water, are removed before disassembly. Holes are bored for ventilation and all flammable vapours are extracted.

Vessels are initially taken to a dry dock or a pier, although a dry dock is considered more environmentally friendly because all spillage is contained and can easily be cleaned up. Floating is, however, cheaper than a dry dock. Stormwater discharge facilities will stop an overflow of toxic liquid into the waterways. The carrier is then secured to ensure its stability. Often the propeller is removed beforehand to allow the watercraft to be moved into shallower water.

Workers must completely strip the ship down to a bare hull, with objects cut free using saws, grinders, abrasive cutting wheels, hand-held shears, plasma, and gas torches. Anything of value, such as spare parts and electronic equipment is sold for re-use, although labour costs mean that low-value items are not economical to sell. The Basel Convention demands that all yards separate hazardous and non-hazardous waste and have appropriate storage units, and this must be done before the hull is cut up. Asbestos, found in the engine room, is isolated and stored in custom-made plastic wrapping prior to being placed in secure steel containers, which are then landfilled.

Many hazardous wastes can be recycled into new products. Examples include lead-acid batteries or electronic circuit boards. Another commonly used treatment is cement-based solidification and stabilization. Cement kilns are used because they can treat a range of hazardous wastes by improving physical characteristics and decreasing the toxicity and transmission of contaminants. Hazardous waste may also be &quot;destroyed&quot; by incinerating it at a high temperature; flammable wastes can sometimes be burned as energy sources. Some hazardous waste types may be eliminated using pyrolysis in a high-temperature electrical arc, in inert conditions to avoid combustion. This treatment method may be preferable to high-temperature incineration in some circumstances such as in the destruction of concentrated organic waste types, including PCBs, pesticides, and other persistent organic pollutants. Dangerous chemicals can also be permanently stored in landfills as long as leaching is prevented.

Valuable metals, such as copper or aluminum in electric cable, that are mixed with other materials may be recovered by the use of shredders and separators in the same fashion as e-waste recycling. The shredders cut the electronics into metallic and non-metallic pieces. Metals are extracted using magnetic separators, air flotation separator columns, shaker tables, or eddy currents. Plastic almost always contains regulated hazardous waste (e.g., asbestos, PCBs, hydrocarbons) and cannot be melted down.

Large objects, such as engine parts, are extracted and sold as they become accessible. The hull is cut into 300-tonne sections, starting with the upper deck and working slowly downwards. While oxy-acetylene gas torches are most commonly used, detonation charges can quickly remove large sections of the hull. These sections are transported to an electric arc furnace to be melted down into new ferrous products, though toxic paint must be stripped prior to heating.

===Historical techniques===
At Kaohsiung in the late 1960s and &#x27;70s, ships to be scrapped were tied up at berths in Dah Jen and Dah Lin Pu, at the southern end of Kaohsiung Harbor. There were a total of 24 breaking berths at Kaohsiung; each berth was rented by the scrapper from the Port Authority at a nominal rate of per square foot per month, and up to could be rented surrounding a berth at a time. A typical 5,000-ton ship could be broken up in 25 to 30 days.

The process began with &quot;cleaning&quot;, a process in which subcontractors would come on board the ship to strip it of loose and flammable items, which were often resold in second-hand shops. After that, the cutting crews would start to dismantle the hull, stern first; large sections were cut off the ship and moved via cranes and rigging taken from previously scrapped ships. Because the scrapping at Kaohsiung was done at the docks, scrap metal was placed on trucks waiting to transport it to Kaohsiung&#x27;s mills.

== Conventions and regulations ==

=== The Basel Convention ===
The Basel Convention on the Control of Trans-boundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal of 1989 was the first convention to environmentally govern the ship breaking industry. It has been ratified by 187 countries, including India and Bangladesh. It controls the international movement of hazardous wastes and for their environmentally sound management mainly through consent for the shipment between the authorities of the country exporting the hazardous wastes with the authorities of the importing country.

Though the Basel Convention has notably reduced illegal exports of hazardous wastes to countries that are unable to process and dispose of them in an environmentally sound manner, it has failed to define the minimum standards of recycling soundly. It also completely ignores important aspects such as workers&#x27; safety and falls short in overcoming bureaucratic barriers when it comes to communication between exporting and importing countries. Furthermore, the decision to scrap a ship is often made in international waters, where the convention has no jurisdiction.

The &quot;Ban Amendment&quot; to the Basel Convention was adopted in March 1994, prohibiting the export of hazardous wastes from OECD countries to non-OECD countries. The Amendment would enter into force 90 days after it has been ratified by at least three-quarters of the 87 countries that were Parties to the Convention at the time it was adopted. Croatia deposited the 66th ratification in September 2019, and the Ban Amendment entered into force 25 years after adoption on December 5, 2019. However, the European Union had already enacted the Ban Amendment unilaterally through the European Waste Shipment Regulation, which incorporated the Basel Convention and the Ban Amendment into European Union law in February 1993, the European Union replaced its previous regulation with the Waste Shipment Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 (the WSR), which also unilaterally implemented the Ban Amendment, prohibiting the export of hazardous wastes from European Union member states to any developing (i.e. non-OECD), countries and regulating their export to OECD countries through the Basel Convention&#x27;s prior informed consent mechanism.

When the European Commission attempted to apply the WSR to end-of-life ships, it encountered numerous obstacles and evasion. This is because, in enforcing the Ban Amendment, the European Waste WSR considers it illegal to recycle any ship that has started its last voyage from a European Union port in Bangladesh, China, India, or Pakistan, regardless of the flag the ship flies. These four non-OECD countries have consistently recycled around 95% of the world&#x27;s tonnage. In fact, according to a study conducted by the European Commission in 2011, at least 91% of ships covered by the WSR disobeyed or circumvented its requirements. The European Commission admitted publicly that enforcing its own Waste Shipment Regulation to recycle ships had not been successful. The commission, unable to wait for the HKC to take effect, began developing new legislation to regulate the recycling of European-flagged ships. This led the European Commission in 2012 to propose the development of a new European Regulation on Ship Recycling.

=== The Hong Kong Convention ===

To overcome the difficulties of the Basel Convention in terms of the inordinate time and effort required in gaining the consent of all countries involved in its due time, and to highlight regulations that this convention left out, its governing body requested the International Maritime Organisation for a newer convention in 2004. Thus, the Hong Kong Convention came into existence. In essence, the Convention aims to ensure that ships, when being recycled after reaching the end of their operational lives, do not pose any unnecessary risks to human health, safety and the environment. The convention covers regulations including:

# the design, construction, operation and preparation of ships to facilitate safe and environmentally sound recycling, without compromising the safety and operational efficiency of ships;
# the operation of ship recycling facilities in a safe and environmentally sound manner; and
# the establishment of an appropriate enforcement mechanism for ship recycling (certification/reporting requirements).

With much more sound standards of ship recycling, easier implementation and better supervision, the Hong Kong Convention was finally adopted in 2009. However, the convention will only come into universal force 24 months after the date on which the following conditions are met:

# ratification or accession by 15 States,
# the fleet of the States that have ratified or acceded to represent at least 40 percent of world merchant shipping by gross tonnage, and
# the combined maximum annual ship recycling volume of the States during the preceding 10 years to constitute not less than 3 percent of the gross tonnage of the combined merchant shipping of the same States.

As of 2 April 2023, 20 countries have acceded to the HKC, making up 30.16% of the world&#x27;s merchant shipping by gross tonnage, with a combined maximum annual ship recycling volume of the States at 2.6% of the gross tonnage of the combined merchant shipping of the same States. This leaves the second and third conditions yet to be fulfilled for the HKC to enter into force.

Nearly 96 of India&#x27;s 120 operational ship recycling yards have achieved Statements of Compliance (SoC) with the Hong Kong Convention by various IACS class societies—including ClassNK, IRClass, Lloyd&#x27;s Register and RINA. In addition, a yard in Chattogram, Bangladesh has also become the first one to achieve an SoC by ClassNK in January 2020, having first achieved a RINA SoC in 2017. Furthermore, to encourage the growth of India&#x27;s vital ship recycling sector, in November 2019, the Government of India acceded to the Hong Kong Convention for Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships and became the only South Asian country and major ship recycling destination so far to take such a step.

=== The EU Ship Recycling Regulation ===
The work on the EU&#x27;s Ship Recycling Regulation (SRR) was started in 2013, after the adoption of the requirements from the Hong Kong International Convention for the safe and environmentally sound recycling of ships (HKC). However, it differs from the HKC in the way yards are authorised and in its list of inventories of hazardous materials, or IHM The argument for developing a specified regulation for ship recycling in the European Union, was the fact that the EU noticed how many EU ships that ended up in unsustainable recycling facilities. Europeans own around 40% of the world fleet, around 15000 ships. Among these around 10000 fly an EU Member-State flag, but only 7% of the EU-flagged ships are dismantled in the EU territory, and the rest are mostly dismantled in South Asia.

After the financial crisis in the early 2010s many ship owners ended up with an unexpected overcapacity of ships, and was selling of their vessels. The phasing out of single hull oil tankers also provided a rush to change out ones fleet. The EU&#x27;s new &quot;FuelEU maritime initiative&quot; is also incentivising decarbonization of the maritime sector, which requires ships to sail on new renewables or less polluting fuels. This implies that the EU fleet already has and will undergo major changes and renewals in the coming years, thus leading to many ships being outdated or phased out, many being concerned for the end-of-life handling of these older ships.

The SRR aims to address the environmental and health hazards associated with ship dismantling by setting high standards for EU-flagged vessels at the end of their operational lives. One of the key components developed by the EU is the &quot;European List of Approved Ship Recycling Facilities&quot;, identifying the approved ports for all EU flagged ships to be recycled. For a ship recycling yard to be included in the list, the facilities must comply with strict environmental and worker safety standards, reducing toxic waste release and promoting safe dismantling practices. Member States report to the Commission on which facilities in their territory that comply to the requirements, and thereby get included on the list. Shipyards outside the EU can also be included on the European List but must apply to the Commission with proof of the yard’s standards.

To be included on the European List, ship recycling facilities must adhere to specific requirements set by the EU and aligned with the Hong Kong Convention and other international guidelines. Facilities need authorization, robust structural and operational standards, environmental safety protocols, and measures for monitoring health and safety risks to workers and nearby populations. This includes handling hazardous materials on impermeable surfaces, training workers and provide them with protective equipment, implementing emergency plans, and recording incidents. Operators must also submit recycling plans and completion reports, ensuring full compliance and minimizing environmental and health impacts during ship recycling activities. As of November 2024, it contains 45 shipyards. Because the list works as a guarantee for a yards safety and validity, shipyards can both be removed and added to the list if they cease to comply with the regulation.

Additionally, to the list of approved facilities, the SRR also mandates each ship to hold an Inventory of Hazardous Materials (IHM), listing hazardous substances used in each ship&#x27;s construction. &quot;Hazardous material&quot; refers to any material or substance which is liable to create hazards to human health and/or the environment. New installation of material such as asbestos and ozone-depleting substances are prohibited, and the occurrence of materials containing lead, mercury and radioactive substances, to name a few, are to be reported and restricted. This inventory, which must be maintained throughout the ship&#x27;s life, helps guide shipyards and recyclers on safe waste management and reduces accidental environmental contamination. The ships also report on the operationally generated waste, meaning wastewater and residues generated by the normal operation of ships. By EU standards, any EU ship going for dismantling, all new European ships, and third-country ships stopping in EU ports need to have an inventory of hazardous materials on board 

This list, as of 27 July 2023, contains 48 ship-recycling facilities, including 38 yards in Europe (EU, Norway and UK), 9 yards in Turkey and 1 yard in the USA. Several yards on the European List are also capable of recycling large vessels. The list excluded some of the most major ship recycling yards in India and Bangladesh, which have achieved SoCs with the HKC in various class societies. This exclusion has led to many ship owners changing the flag of their vessel before recycling or sell the ship to cash buyers, to evade the regulations. Excluded countries strive towards bringing the HKC into force as the universal regulation, arguing that it would be irrational if international shipping were regulated by multiple and competing standards.

==Dangers==
===Health risks===

Seventy percent of ships are simply run ashore in developing countries for disassembly, where (particularly in older vessels) potentially toxic materials such as asbestos, lead, polychlorinated biphenyls and heavy metals along with lax industrial safety standards pose a danger for the workers. Burns from explosions and fire, suffocation, mutilation from falling metal, cancer and disease from toxins are regular occurrences in the industry. Asbestos was used heavily in ship construction until it was finally banned in most of the developed world in the mid-1980s. Currently, the costs associated with removing asbestos, along with the potentially expensive insurance and health risks, have meant that ship breaking in most developed countries is no longer economically viable. Dangerous vapours and fumes from burning materials can be inhaled, and dusty asbestos-laden areas are commonplace.

Removing the metal for scrap can potentially cost more than the value of the scrap metal itself. In the developing world, however, shipyards can operate without the risk of personal injury lawsuits or workers&#x27; health claims, meaning many of these shipyards may operate with high health risks. Protective equipment is sometimes absent or inadequate. The sandy beaches cannot sufficiently support the heavy equipment, which is thus prone to collapse. Many are injured from explosions when flammable gas is not removed from fuel tanks. In Bangladesh, a local watchdog group claims that, on average, one worker dies per week and one is injured per day.

The problem is caused by negligence from national governments, shipyard operators and former ship owners disregarding the Basel Convention. According to the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights, workers who attempt to unionize are fired and then blacklisted. The employees have no formal contract or any rights, and sleep in over-crowded hostels. The authorities produce no comprehensive injury statistics, so the problem is underestimated. Child labour is also widespread: 20% of Bangladesh&#x27;s ship breaking workforce are below 15 years of age, mainly involved in cutting with gas torches.

There is, however, an active ship-breaker&#x27;s union in Mumbai, India (Mumbai Port Trust Dock and General Employees&#x27; Union) since 2003 with 15,000 members, which strikes to ensure fatality compensation. It has set up a sister branch in Alang, gaining paid holidays and safety equipment for workers since 2005. They hope to expand all along the South Asian coastline.

Even poor occupational safety record at Alang, the world&#x27;s largest ship recycling destination, underlines the risks of the ship breaking industry. Poor worker safety has led to a number of accidents and dozens of workers deaths at the Alang yards over the years. According the IndustriALL Global Union affiliate, Alang Sosiya Ship Recycling and General Workers&#x27; Association (ASSRGWA), between January 2009 and October 2012, at least 54 workers had died in work-related accidents at the Alang shipbreaking yards. Besides worker unions, such frequent accidents due to poor safety standards at Alang have also attracted EU scrutiny.

In Alang, safety awareness drives with hoardings, posters, films as well as training programmes for different categories of workers under the Safety Training and Labour Welfare Institute, safety evaluation by external teams, personal protective equipment (PPEs) including gloves, gumboot, goggles and masks are provided to workers to mitigate the hazards of their work. In addition to this, GMB has also included regular medical examinations of workers exposed to bio-hazardous materials, provision of medical facilities at the Red Cross Hospital in Alang, mobile medical vans and health awareness programmes.

Several United Nations committees are increasing their coverage of ship-breakers&#x27; human rights. In 2006, the International Maritime Organisation developed legally binding global legislation which concerns vessel design, vessel recycling and the enforcement of regulation thereof and a &#x27;Green Passport&#x27; scheme. Water-craft must have an inventory of hazardous material before they are scrapped, and the facilities must meet health &amp; safety requirements. The International Labour Organization created a voluntary set of guidelines for occupational safety in 2003. Nevertheless, Greenpeace found that even pre-existing mandatory regulation has had little noticeable effect for labourers, due to government corruption, yard owner secrecy and a lack of interest from countries who prioritise economic growth. There are also guards who look out for any reporters. To safeguard worker health, the report recommends that developed countries create a fund to support their families, certify carriers as &#x27;gas-free&#x27; (i.e. safe for cutting) and to remove toxic materials in appropriate facilities before export. To supplement the international treaties, organisations such as the NGO Shipbreaking Platform, the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights and ToxicsWatch Alliance are lobbying for improvements in the industry.

=== Environmental risks ===
In recent years, ship breaking has become an issue of environmental concern beyond the health of the yard workers. Many ship breaking yards operate in developing nations with lax or no environmental law, enabling large quantities of highly toxic materials to escape into the general environment and causing serious health problems among ship-breakers, the local population and wildlife. Environmental campaign groups such as Greenpeace have made the issue a high priority for their activities.

Along the Indian subcontinent, ecologically important mangrove forests, a valuable source of protection from tropical storms and monsoons, have been cut down to provide space for water-craft disassembly. In Bangladesh, for example, 40,000 mangrove trees were illegally chopped down in 2009. The World Bank has found that the country&#x27;s beaching locations are now at risk from sea level rise. Twenty-one fish and crustacean species have been wiped out in the country as a result of the industry as well. Lead, organotins such as tributyltin in anti-fouling paints, polychlorinated organic compounds, by-products of combustion such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, dioxins and furans are found in ships and pose a great danger to the environment.

The Basel Convention on the Control of Trans-boundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal of 1989 has been ratified by 166 countries, including India and Bangladesh, and in 2004, End of Life Ships were subjected to its regulations. It aims to stop the transportation of dangerous substances to less-developed countries and mandate the use of regulated facilities. Furthermore, the decision to scrap a ship is often made in international waters, where the convention has no jurisdiction.

The Hong Kong Convention is a compromise. It allows ships to be exported for recycling, as long as various stipulations are met: All water-craft must have an inventory and every shipyard needs to publish a recycling plan to protect the environment. The Hong Kong Convention was adopted in 2009 but with few countries signing the agreement.

However, nearly 96 of the 120 ship recycling yards in India have achieved Statements of Compliance (SoC) with the Hong Kong Convention by various IACS class societies—including ClassNK, IRClass, Lloyd&#x27;s Register and RINA. In addition, a yard in Chattogram, Bangladesh has also become the first one to achieve an SoC by ClassNK in January 2020, having first achieved a RINA SoC in 2017. Furthermore, to encourage the growth of India&#x27;s vital ship recycling sector, in November 2019 the Government of India acceded to the Hong Kong Convention for Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships and became the only South Asian country and major ship recycling destination so far to take such a positive step.

In March 2012 the European Commission proposed tougher regulations to ensure all parties take responsibility. Under these rules, if a vessel has a European flag, it must be disposed of in a shipyard on an EU &quot;green list&quot;. The facilities would have to show that they are compliant, and it would be regulated internationally in order to bypass corrupt local authorities. However, there is evidence of ship owners changing the flag to evade the regulations. China&#x27;s scrap industry has vehemently protested against the proposed European regulations. Although Chinese recycling businesses are less damaging than their South Asian counterparts, European and American ship-breakers comply with far more stringent legislation.

That being said, ship recycling yard owners have made investments into upgrading their recycling facilities and safety infrastructure in the recent past, including 100% impervious floors with drainage systems, setting up of hazardous waste processing facilities like the Common Hazardous Wastes Treatment, Storage and Disposal Facility (CHW-TSDF) in Alang, and adherence to various internationally recognised conventions. The ship recycling industry also produces about 4.5 million tons of re-rollable steel per year. That comes up to nearly 2% of total steel produced in India, coming from a process that does not exploit natural resources and thereby saves non-renewable natural resources and energy. Recycling of one ton of scrap saves 1.1 tons of iron ore, 0.6–0.7 tons of coking coal and around 0.2–0.3 tons of fluxes. Specific energy consumption for production of steel through BF-BOF (primary) and EAF&amp; IF (secondary routes) is 14 MJ/kg and 11.7 MJ/kg, respectively. Thus, it leads to savings in energy by 16–17%. It also reduces the water consumption and GHG emission by 40% and 58%, respectively.

==List of ship-breaking yards==
The following are some of the world&#x27;s largest ship breaking yards:

===Bangladesh===
* Chittagong Ship Breaking Yard at Chittagong

=== Belgium ===
* Galloo, Ghent, formerly Van Heyghen Recycling

===China===
* Changjiang Ship Breaking Yard, located in Jiangyin, China

===India===
As of January 2020, India has a 30% share of ship breaking. Once India passes the planned &quot;Recycling of Ships Act, 2019&quot; which ratifies the Hong Kong International Convention for the safe and environmentally sound recycling of ships, ships not coming for breaking to India from the treaty nations of USA, Europe and Japan could also begin arriving in India, with the potential to double its global share of ship breaking to 60%. If that happens, it would also double India&#x27;s annual ship breaking revenue to US$2.2 billion.

Intro
Definition
Chittagong ship breaking yard. Was worlds largest or a while
Advantage
Environmental- Reduction in Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Shipbreaking helps mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by recycling steel instead of producing it from raw materials. According to a study by the NGO Shipbreaking Platform, recycling one ton of steel saves approximately 1.5 tons of CO2 emissions compared to steel production from virgin materials.
Economy- 1.2 billion us dollars from shipbreaking in 2020
Job creation- Employs 200,000 directly and 50,000 indirectly
Disadvantages
Environment-Pollution of Coastal Waters: Shipbreaking operations release a significant amount of pollutants into coastal waters, including heavy metals, oils, and toxic chemicals. It&#x27;s estimated that around 120,000 metric tons of oil are released annually into the Bay of Bengal due to shipbreaking activities. Air Pollution: Burning of materials during shipbreaking emits hazardous pollutants into the air, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. This contributes to poor air quality in the surrounding areas. Studies have shown that shipbreaking activities in Bangladesh release approximately 800,000 tons of CO2 annually.
•Unsafe conditions- The Bangladesh Institute of Labour Studies reported that only 10% of shipbreaking yards have access to emergency medical facilities on-site. As well as 10% proper safety. Toxic substance, sharp objects, over strenuous activities.
Unfair- 12 hour days, 1-2. Shipbreaking laborers often find themselves denied breaks or sick leave, even in cases of on-the-job injuries, a clear violation of Bangladesh&#x27;s labor regulations. Additionally, they frequently receive wages well below the legal minimum for shipbreaking work. Lack of formal contracts further enables yard owners to obscure incidents of worker harm. When workers seek to unionize or raise concerns, they face dismissal and intimidation tactics.

Solutions

<text>Takin&#x27; It to the Streets is the sixth studio album by American rock band The Doobie Brothers. The album was released on March 19, 1976, by Warner Bros. Records. It was the first to feature Michael McDonald on lead vocals.

==Background==
By late 1974, touring was beginning to take its toll on the band, especially leader Tom Johnston. Things became worse during touring in support of &quot;Stampede&quot; when he was diagnosed with stomach ulcers. His condition worsened and several shows were cancelled. With Johnston forced to reduce his involvement with the band, the other members considered disbanding, but while in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, member Jeff Baxter suggested calling up friend and fellow Steely Dan graduate Michael McDonald, who at the time was between gigs and living in a garage apartment. McDonald was reluctant at first, feeling he was not what they wanted; according to him, &quot;...they were looking for someone who could play Hammond B-3 organ and a lot of keyboards, and I was just a songwriter/piano hacker. But more than anything, I think they were looking for a singer to fill Tommy&#x27;s shoes.&quot; He agreed to join them and met them at the Le Pavillon Hotel in New Orleans, where they moved into a warehouse to rehearse for the next two days. Expecting to be finished once touring was completed, McDonald was surprised when the band invited him to the studio to work on their next album.

==Recording==
With Johnston on the sidelines, the band was unsure how to proceed. They doubted being able to make an album without Johnston. &quot;I knew the record company was panicked about any change in the band,&quot; McDonald admitted. &quot;They were leery about getting a new guy. I was thrilled to have had the gig, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting all that much.&quot; With encouragement from producer Ted Templeman, the band began poring over the songs they had available. They knew they needed more, so McDonald brought in his own demos. Templeman told them, according to Patrick Simmons, &quot;You&#x27;ve got a real diamond in the rough here that you can make into something if you want to go ahead.&quot; They decided to record his songs knowing it would take them in a completely different direction. While Johnston was absent for most of the sessions, he contributed one song – &quot;Turn It Loose&quot; – as well as back-up vocals and duet vocals with Simmons on &quot;Wheels of Fortune&quot;. &quot;I hadn&#x27;t quit the band&quot;, he later stated. &quot;I just wasn&#x27;t physically able to do it. I needed to get off the road and get away from that whole scene for a while.&quot;. &quot;For Someone Special&quot; was written by bassist Tiran Porter for Johnston. Porter also sang lead on the track.

<text>Azzano San Paolo (Bergamasque: ) is a &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Bergamo, in Lombardy, northern Italy.

== History ==

The origins date back to Roman times and the place-name, according to many experts, comes from a landowner of that historical period named &quot;Attius&quot;.

The place was first mentioned in 875, referring to a certain &quot;Agemundi de Aciano&quot;. The area was ruled by the Lombards and after them the Holy Roman Empire. During the communal period, the village was affected by significant clashes between opposing factions of the Guelphs and Ghibellines. Because of its proximity to the city Bergamo, numerous fortifications for defensive purposes, such as towers and a castle, were built.

In 1083 Count Albert, son of Arduin Glaber, allowed the serfs to own homes, lands and any kind of good. This event, reported by official documents, anticipated by almost seven centuries the democratic achievements towards the slaves, occurred in Europe only since the 18th century.

Azzano was subsequently ruled by the Republic of Venice, the Cisalpine Republic and the Austrian Empire. In 1859 it was annexed into the Kingdom of Italy.

In 1896 it was founded here a convent of Dominican nuns coming from the monastery of Matris Domini in Bergamo, adapting an old country house and a textile mill previously owned by the counts Morlani.

Traditionally a small farming village on the outskirts of Bergamo, it maintained its agricultural vocation until the end of World War II. With the Italian industrialization process of the 1960s and 1970s, the hamlet&#x27;s economy diversified, the population tripling since then. The expansion process is still ongoing because the proximity to Bergamo makes it a suitable area new settlements.

<text>&quot;The Naked Time&quot; is the fourth episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by John D. F. Black and directed by Marc Daniels, it first aired on September 29, 1966.

In the episode, a strange, intoxicating infection, which lowers the crew&#x27;s inhibitions, spreads throughout the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. As the madness spreads, the entire ship is endangered.

This was the first episode in which the audience saw the Vulcan nerve pinch (the nerve pinch was actually filmed first in &quot;The Enemy Within&quot;, but the latter was broadcast a week after &quot;Naked Time&quot;).

The story has a sequel in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, the 1987 episode &quot;The Naked Now&quot;.

==Plot==
The USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; under the command of Captain Kirk arrives at the dying planet Psi 2000. Their mission is to observe and document the planet&#x27;s breakup, and to retrieve a research team stationed on the planet. Mr. Spock and Lt (junior grade) Joe Tormolen beam down and find the researchers&#x27; life support system shut down and the team frozen—one fully clothed in a shower, one seated at a control console as if nothing was wrong, and the attrative woman member strangled (pictured). Tormolen removes his environmental suit glove to scratch his nose and comes in contact with a strange red liquid. The landing party is beamed back to the ship and examined by Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy. McCoy finds no medical issues with them and allows them to return to duty.

While having lunch, Tormolen begins to act irrationally, expressing hostility towards other crew members, and threatening Lieutenants Sulu and Riley with a knife before turning it on himself. His wound is not life-threatening, but in sick bay he dies after a successful surgery, to McCoy&#x27;s bewilderment.

Both Sulu and Riley also begin to behave irrationally. Sulu runs about with a sword, like a swashbuckler from &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, while Riley revels in his Irish ancestry, locks himself in the engineering section, and proclaims himself captain of the &quot;Enterprise.&quot; Riley repeatedly sings a disjointed version of the old ballad &quot;I&#x27;ll Take You Home Again, Kathleen&quot;. Those whose skin they have touched also start showing erratic symptoms, and the infection quickly spreads through the crew. As they abandon their posts, the ship&#x27;s orbit destabilizes and it falls into the planet&#x27;s erratic gravity well. As the &quot;Enterprise&quot; enters the upper atmosphere, the hull begins to heat.

Chief Engineer Scott regains control of engineering from Riley, but Riley has shut down the engines. It will be impossible to restart them by normal procedures before the &quot;Enterprise&quot; burns up.

Spock becomes infected when Nurse Chapel takes his hands and confesses her love for him. Spock struggles to contain his emotions, and infects Captain James T. Kirk when he tries to help. McCoy studies blood samples from his patients and water from Psi 2000 and finds that the water from the planet possesses a previously undetected complex chain of molecules that affects humanoids like alcohol, depressing the centers of judgment and self-control, and is transmitted by touch. He develops a serum to reverse the effects, administering the initial doses to the command crew to allow them to bring the ship back under control.

Kirk orders Scott to make a full-power restart of the warp engines, a dangerous process that mixes matter and antimatter in a cold state to create a controlled implosion and drive the ship away from the planet. This is suggested by a theory postulating a relationship between time and antimatter, but it has never before been attempted. The restart is successful, propelling the &quot;Enterprise&quot; at impossible speed away from the planet into a space-time warp that sends the ship back 71 hours in time. Spock comments that they now know a way to travel back through time. Kirk&#x27;s response is &quot;We may risk it someday, Mr. Spock.&quot;

==Production==
&quot;The Naked Time&quot; was originally intended to be a two-part episode, with part one ending with a cliffhanger with the &quot;Enterprise&quot; going back in time. The ending was revised so it would become a standalone episode. What would have been part two eventually became another standalone episode, &quot;Tomorrow Is Yesterday&quot;.

When the script required Lieutenant Sulu to reveal that in his deepest self he sees himself as a swashbuckler, George Takei had to learn how to handle a fencing rapier in a hurry. When not needed on the set, he would practice fencing, frequently lunging at passing members of the film crew and sometimes pinking them. A delegation eventually called on Gene Roddenberry and threatened that the entire crew would quit if Sulu were ever given a sword again.

&quot;The Naked Time&quot; is the only episode of &quot;The Original Series&quot; in which the rank of Lieutenant (junior grade) was shown or referred to. The sleeve insignia of that rank is a single broken stripe, and Joseph Tormolen is the only member of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew ever to be shown wearing it.

&quot;The Naked Time&quot; is also the only episode of &quot;The Original Series&quot; in which all three principal female characters, Lt. Nyota Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), Yeoman Janice Rand (Grace Lee Whitney), and Nurse Christine Chapel (Majel Barrett), appear in the same episode.

==Notes==
The events of this episode are repeated in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;The Naked Now&quot;, where Riker references the incident as an in-universe historical event. Events are also mentioned in the &quot;TNG&quot; Season 6 episode &quot;Relics&quot;.

The 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; film makes a reference to the scene where Sulu acts like a swashbuckler, when Kirk asks Sulu what type of combat training he has and he replies &quot;fencing&quot;.

Footage from this episode appears in the 2014 film &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot;.

A reference to this episode is made in the &quot;Hollywood Knights!&quot; episode of &quot;Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?&quot; when guest star George Takei shows up bare-chested and wielding an epee.

==Releases==
In July 2011, the streaming service Netflix made all &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes available, which would include this episode.

==Reception==
George Takei has repeatedly mentioned in interviews that this is his favorite episode, and spends a chapter on it in his autobiography.

In 2012, &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; ranked this the third best episode of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

In 2013, &quot;Wired&quot; magazine ranked this episode one of the top ten most underrated episodes of &quot;The Original Series&quot; at that time.

In 2015, Syfy ranked this episode as one of the top ten essential &quot;Star Trek&quot; original series Spock episodes.

In 2016, SyFy listed Uhura&#x27;s rebuff of the maddened Sulu&#x27;s offer to &quot;protect&quot; her as the character&#x27;s tenth best moment in &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

IGN ranked &quot;The Naked Time&quot; the 8th best episode of &quot;The Original Series&quot; in 2016 and the 12th best episode of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; series in 2013.

In 2016, &quot;USA Today&quot; noted &quot;The Naked Time&quot; as an interesting episode of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

In 2018, &quot;PopMatters&quot; ranked this the 11th best episode of &quot;The Original Series&quot;.

In 2019, &quot;Nerdist&quot; included this episode on their &quot;Best of Spock&quot; binge-watching guide.

In 2021, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked it as the 15th best episode of the original Star Trek series to re-watch.

In 2024 &quot;Hollywood.com&quot; ranked The Naked Time at number 18 out of the 79 original series episodes.

<text>Richard Henry Tawney (30 November 1880 – 16 January 1962) was an English economic historian, social critic, ethical socialist, Christian socialist, and important proponent of adult education. &quot;The Oxford Companion to British History&quot; (1997) explained that Tawney made a &quot;significant impact&quot; in these &quot;interrelated roles&quot;. A. L. Rowse goes further by insisting that &quot;Tawney exercised the widest influence of any historian of his time, politically, socially and, above all, educationally&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Born on 30 November 1880 in Calcutta, British India (present-day Kolkata, India), Tawney was the son of the Sanskrit scholar Charles Henry Tawney. He was educated at Rugby School, arriving on the same day as William Temple, a future Archbishop of Canterbury; they remained friends for life. He read Greats at Balliol College, Oxford. The college&#x27;s &quot;strong ethic of social service&quot; combined with Tawney&#x27;s own &quot;deep and enduring Anglicanism&quot; helped shape his sense of social responsibility. After graduating from Oxford in 1903, he and his friend William Beveridge lived at Toynbee Hall, then the home of the recently formed Workers&#x27; Educational Association (WEA). The experience was to have a profound effect upon him. He realised that charity was insufficient and major structural change was required to bring about social justice for the poor.

==Christian socialism==
Whilst Tawney remained a regular churchgoer, his Christian faith remained a personal affair, and he rarely spoke publicly about the basis of his beliefs. In keeping with his social radicalism, Tawney came to regard the Church of England as a &quot;class institution, making respectful salaams to property and gentility, and with too little faith in its own creed to call a spade a spade in the vulgar manner of the New Testament&quot;.

For three years from January 1908, Tawney taught the first Workers&#x27; Educational Association tutorial classes at Longton, Stoke-on-Trent, and Rochdale, Lancashire. For a time, until he moved to Manchester after marrying Jeannette (William Beveridge&#x27;s sister and a Somerville graduate), Tawney was working as part-time economics lecturer at Glasgow University. To fulfil his teaching commitments to the WEA, he travelled first to Longton for the evening class every Friday, before travelling north to Rochdale for the Saturday afternoon class. Tawney clearly saw these classes as a two-way learning process. &quot;The friendly smitings of weavers, potters, miners and engineers, have taught me much about the problem of political and economic sciences which cannot easily be learned from books&quot;.

==World War I Service==
During the First World War, Tawney served as a Sergeant in the 22nd Manchester Regiment. He turned down a commission as an officer as a result of his political beliefs, preferring instead to serve in the ranks. He had initially opposed the war on political grounds. He decided, however, to enlist following reports of atrocities committed during the German Army&#x27;s invasion of Belgium. He served at the Battle of the Somme (1916), where he was wounded twice on the first day and had to lie in no man&#x27;s land for 30 hours until a medical officer evacuated him. He was transported to a French field hospital and later evacuated to Britain. The war led Tawney to grapple with the nature of original sin. &quot;The goodness we have reached is a house built on piles driven into black slime and always slipping down into it unless we are building night and day&quot;. It also heightened his sense of urgency for meaningful social, economic and political change. In 1918, he largely wrote &quot;Christianity and Industrial Problems&quot;, the fifth report (the other four were on more ecclesiastical matters) from a Church of England commission which included a number of bishops. Notable for its socialist flavour, the report &quot;set the tone for most Anglican post-war social thinking&quot;.

==Academic historian==
Tawney&#x27;s first important work as a historian was &quot;The Agrarian Problem in the Sixteenth Century&quot; (1912). He was a Fellow of Balliol College from 1918 to 1921. From 1917 to 1931, he was a lecturer at the London School of Economics. In 1926 he helped found the Economic History Society with Sir William Ashley, amongst others, and became the joint editor of its journal, &quot;The Economic History Review&quot;. From 1931 until retirement in 1949, he was a professor of economic history at the LSE and Professor Emeritus after 1949. He was an Honorary Doctor of the universities of Oxford, Manchester, Birmingham, Sheffield, London, Chicago, Melbourne, and Paris. He was an elected International member of the American Philosophical Society.

Tawney&#x27;s historical works reflected his ethical concerns and preoccupations in economic history. He was profoundly interested in the issue of the enclosure of land in the English countryside in the 16th and 17th centuries and in Max Weber&#x27;s thesis on the connection between the appearance of Protestantism and the rise of capitalism. His belief in the rise of the gentry in the century before the outbreak of the Civil War in England provoked the &#x27;Storm over the gentry&#x27; in which his methods were subjected to severe criticisms by Hugh Trevor-Roper and John Cooper.

&quot;Religion and the Rise of Capitalism&quot; (1926) was his classic work and made his reputation as an historian. It explored the relationship between Protestantism and economic development in the 16th and 17th centuries. Tawney &quot;bemoaned the division between commerce and social morality brought about by the Protestant Reformation, leading as it did to the subordination of Christian teaching to the pursuit of material wealth&quot;.

The Oxford historian Valerie Pearl once described Tawney as having appeared to those in his presence as having an &quot;aura of sanctity&quot;. He lent his name to the Tawney Society at Rugby School, the R. H. Tawney Economic History Society at the London School of Economics, the annual Tawney Memorial Lectures (Christian Socialist Movement), the R. H. Tawney Building at Keele University and the Tawney Tower Hall of Residence at Essex University.

===Social criticism===
Two of Tawney&#x27;s books stand out as his most influential social criticism: (1920), Richard Crossman&#x27;s &quot;socialist bible&quot;, and &quot;Equality&quot; (1931), &quot;his seminal work&quot;. The former, one of his most widely read books, criticised the selfish individualism of modern society. Capitalism, he insisted, encourages acquisitiveness and thereby corrupts everyone. In the latter book, Tawney argues for an egalitarian society.

Both works reflected Tawney&#x27;s Christian moral values, &quot;exercised a profound influence&quot; in Britain and abroad, and &quot;anticipated the Welfare state&quot;. As David Ormrod of the University of Kent stresses, &quot;intermittent opposition from the Churches to the new idolatry of wealth surfaced from time to time but no individual critics have arisen with a combination of political wisdom, historical insight and moral force to match that of R.H. Tawney, the prophet who denounced acquisitiveness&quot;.

===Christian socialist politics===
Historian Geoffrey Foote has highlighted Tawney&#x27;s &quot;political shifts&quot;: &quot;From an endorsement of a radical Guild socialism in 1921 through his authorship of the gradualist &quot;Labour &amp; the Nation&quot; in 1928, his savage attacks on gradualism in the 1930s to his endorsement of revisionism in the 1950s&quot;. Nevertheless, the same author also argues that &quot;Tawney&#x27;s importance lies in his ability to propose a malleable yet coherent socialist philosophy which transcends any particular political situation. In this sense, his mature political thought never really changed&quot;.

In 1906, Tawney joined the Fabian Society and was elected to its executive from 1921 to 1933. His fellow Fabian Beatrice Webb described him as a &quot;saint of socialism&quot; exercising influence without rancour. He joined the Independent Labour Party in 1909 and the Labour Party in 1918. He stood three times, all unsuccessfully, for election to a seat in the House of Commons: for Rochdale in 1918, for Tottenham South in 1922, and for Swindon in 1924. In 1935, Tawney refused the offer of a &quot;safe seat&quot;, believing that being an MP was now not the most effective contribution he could make to the Labour Party.

He participated in numerous government bodies concerned with industry and education. In 1919, he and Sidney Webb were among the trade union side representatives on the Royal Commission on the Coal Mining Industry, chaired by Sir John Sankey. Equal division of membership between union and employer representatives resulted in opposing recommendations on the future organisation of the industry. The union side recommended nationalisation largely due to Tawney and Webb.

His &quot;Secondary Education for All&quot; (1922) &quot;informed Labour policy for a generation&quot; and Tawney has been credited for the Party document, &quot;Labour &amp; the Nation&quot; (1928), which formed the basis of the 1931 general election manifesto. Geoffrey Foote has claimed that Tawney&#x27;s importance in the realm of political thought, and his contribution to the Labour Party, cannot be overestimated. His call for specific reforms in health and education were important in laying the basis of Labour&#x27;s plans for the welfare state, while his criticisms of acquisitive morality were an important intellectual and emotional basis for many future politicians who were committed to social reform. However, the reforms in the social services which were eventually to be put into effect by the 1945 Labour government took place within the confines of the acquisitive society condemned by Tawney. The social advances made by the Labour Party were not to be as permanent as many believed.
===Adult education advocacy===
Leveraging his base among intellectuals in the Labour Party, he spent years in making a lasting impact on democratising higher education. He promoted equality, through restructuring and curricular innovation. For more than forty years, from 1905 to 1948, Tawney served on the Workers&#x27; Educational Association executive, holding the offices of Vice-President (1920–28; 1944–48) and President (1928–44). He served on the Consultative Committee of the Board of Education (1912–31), the education Committee of the London County Council, and the University Grants Committee. He contributed to several government reports on education. His thinking was influential in the creation of the University College of North Staffordshire which opened in 1950 and received its University Charter in 1962 as the University of Keele. The new Teaching Block was renamed the Tawney Building in May 1960 in recognition of Tawney&#x27;s impact on the educational ideals and principles that inspired the &quot;Keele Experiment&quot;.

==Death and interment==

Tawney died in London on 16 January 1962. He is buried on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery. Richard Rees was his literary executor.

<text>Moishe Oysher () (March 8, 1906 – November 27, 1958) was an American cantor, recording artist, and film and Yiddish theatre actor. During the 1940s and 1950s he was one of the top Hazzans and his recordings continue to be appreciated due to his rich, powerful voice and creative arrangements.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Oysher was born in Lipcani, Bessarabia Governorate, Russian Empire on March 8, 1906. He was born to a Jewish family that traced six generations of . He told writer Khaver-Paver that his grandfather sang folk songs and workers&#x27; songs to his students when Moyshe was young, and the heartfelt tunes were &quot;in my blood,&quot; and that it was from his other grandfather &quot; and his father &quot; that he inherited his gift as a .

Oysher&#x27;s father departed for America when Moyshe was young, leaving him with his grandfather. He started acting in school and played a few roles in the poet Eliezer Steinberg&#x27;s &quot;Der Berditchever Rov&quot; (&quot;The Rebbe from Berdichev&quot;). He named Steinberg as a profound influence on his life.

In 1921, he traveled to Canada to join his father. On the way, his voice broke, so in Canada he worked at first as a dishwasher and later a launderer to support himself.

==Career==
Oysher was able to retrain his voice and began singing again in literary and dramatic clubs. He met actor Wolf Shumsky and traveled with him to Winnipeg, where he played Yiddish theater for three seasons. He was allowed into the Canadian Actors&#x27; Union in 1924 and played in the Montreal Yiddish theater under the direction of Isidore Hollander. He may have gone back and forth between Canada and the United States during this time. 

In 1928, he was on Yiddish radio in Philadelphia, where his parents had moved, and that same year he was engaged at the Hopkins Theater in Brooklyn. The manager of the Hopkins theatre, Louis Weiss, was married to the female lead, Florence Weiss; she ended up leaving Louis for Oysher. The pair left for Newark, New Jersey to work at the Lyric Theater. He married Florence Weiss in Newark in January 1929. In 1931, he was accepted into the New York Actors&#x27; Union and played in Anshel Schorr group, and lived in Philadelphia for a time. He then played with Boris Thomashevsky, then in 1932, he started his own company and traveled to Buenos Aires and across Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil.

Returning to the U.S., he worked on the radio and starred with his wife in the Harry Kalmanovitsh - Joseph Rumshinsky operetta (&quot;This is what&#x27;s called being loved)&quot;. Around the same time, with the encouragement of friends, he applied to conduct services as for the High Holidays at the First Roumanian-American Congregation, in Manhattan, New York, on the Lower East Side and caused a sensation, being perhaps the first singer to step from &quot; (stage) to &quot; (pulpit). He thereafter worked around the world in both arenas.

Some say that Oysher&#x27;s voice was like the &quot;roaring of the lion.&quot; In regard to his popularity, he was considered &quot;the darling of many Jews..&quot;[museumoffamilyhistory.com] He liked the jazz style, popular at that time, and he used similar rhythmic melodies in his prayers, respecting always the traditional Bessarabian &quot;doinas&quot; and &quot;&quot; moods of the prayers.

Oysher starred in three Yiddish films. In 1943 Oysher signed a contract with Fortune Gallo to perform several roles with the Chicago Opera Company and a fine career was foreseen, but after a heart attack he had to abandon the idea; he continued to work in radio and as a and recording artist until, after other heart attacks, on the advice of his doctors, he entered semi-retirement.

Oysher died in New Rochelle from undisclosed causes in 1958 aged 52, although his age was misreported as 51.

==Family==

Oysher was survived by his second wife Theodora (a pianist who had often accompanied him in concert), their daughter Shoshana (Rozanna), his sister Fraydele (a Yiddish theater actress and singer) and her husband Harold Sternberg, a chorister in the Metropolitan opera; their daughter is recording artist Marilyn Michaels. Rozanna married Armond Lebowitz and they had two sons, David and Brad.

Oysher died in 1958, aged 52, and is interred in Cedar Park Cemetery in Paramus, New Jersey.

== Filmography ==
*&quot;The Cantor&#x27;s Son&quot; (&quot;Dem Khazn&#x27;s Zindl&quot;) 1937, USA, B&amp;W, 90 min, Yiddish with English subtitles. 
Directed by Ilya Motyleff and Sidney Goldin. Other actors: Judith Abarbanel and Florence Weiss. Based on Moishe Oysher&#x27;s life. A very poor young immigrant lands a job as a custodian, where he is &quot;discovered&quot; and becomes famous immediately. However, his success seems meaningless as he yearns for home.

*&quot;The Singing Blacksmith&quot; (&quot;Yankl der Shmid&quot;; the Yiddish title literally means &quot;Yankel the Smith&quot;) 1938, USA, B&amp;W, 95 min, Yiddish with English subtitles. 
Directed by Edgar G. Ulmer. Also with Miriam Riselle and Florence Weiss.
This is a classic story of a blacksmith who is a womanizer and almost an alcoholic. One day, he meets a beautiful lady called Tamare and his life changes.

*&quot;Overture to Glory&quot; (&quot;Der Vilner Shtot Khazn&quot;; the Yiddish title literally means &quot;The Vilnius City Cantor&quot;) 1940, USA, B&amp;W, 85 min, Yiddish with English subtitles. 
Directed by Max Nosseck. Helen Beverly and Florence Weiss.
Oysher is the &quot;Vilner Balabesl&quot; - a cantor in Vilnius - with a renowned voice. Two men come from the Warsaw Opera to hear him sing &quot;Kol Nidre&quot; on Yom Kippur and are so impressed that they introduce him to European classical music and to reading sheet music; they convince him, against the wishes of much of his family (and especially his father-in-law) to become an opera singer in Warsaw.
He leaves his job as the Vilnius cantor, and seems at first to be on the path to fame and fortune as an opera star in Warsaw, when the news arrives that his son has died. Grief-stricken, he stumbles over the aria he is supposed to sing, starting instead into a lullaby he used to sing to his son. In disgrace, he also loses his voice; he tries to return to his life in Vilna; finally, his voice comes briefly back to him on Yom Kippur. He sings the first few lines of the &quot;Kol Nidre&quot;, then dies of a heart attack.

* In the 1944 movie &quot;Song of Russia&quot;, using the pseudonym Walter Lawrence, Moyshe Oysher sang &quot;Rusland iz ir nomen&quot; (&quot;Russia is Her Name&quot;), music by Jerome Kern.

<doc id="1037989" wikidata="Q180797" url="?curid=1037989" title="Anno II">
<text>Anno II ( – 4 December 1075) was Archbishop of Cologne from 1056 until his death. From 1063 to 1065 he acted as regent of the Holy Roman Empire for the minor Emperor Henry IV. Anno is venerated as a saint of the Catholic Church.

==Life==
He was born to the &quot;edelfrei&quot; Steusslingen family at Altsteußlingen (near Ehingen) in Swabia, and was educated in Bamberg, where he subsequently became head of the cathedral school. In 1046 he became chaplain to the Salian emperor Henry III, and accompanied him on his campaigns against King Andrew I of Hungary in 1051 and 1052. The emperor appointed him provost at the newly erected Cathedral of Goslar in 1054 and Archbishop of Cologne two years later. Due to his dominant position at the imperial court, Anno was able to influence other appointments. Anno&#x27;s nephew, Burchard, was made Bishop of Halberstadt in 1059, and in 1063, his brother, Werner, became Archbishop of Magdeburg.

According to contemporary sources, Anno led an ascetic life and was open to reform. Nevertheless, he was a fearsome adversary to anyone perceived as a threat to the interests of his archdiocese. His plans to seize the prosperous monastery in Malmedy, challenging the authority of the Imperial abbey of Stavelot-Malmedy, caused much controversy and ultimately failed. On the other hand, he founded the Benedictine abbey of Michaelsberg, modelled on the Italian Abbey of Fruttuaria, which soon evolved to a centre of the Cluniac Reforms in Germany.

After the death of Emperor Henry III in 1056, the archbishop took a prominent part in the government of the empire during the minority of the six-year-old heir to the throne, Henry IV. He was the leader of the party which in April 1062 seized the person of Henry in the Coup of Kaiserswerth, and deprived his mother, Empress Agnes, of power. Agnes, initially with the support of Pope Victor II, had stirred up several German princes against her rule by assigning extended fiefs to presumed supporters and by appointing her confidant Bishop Henry II of Augsburg regent. After he also had secured the Imperial regalia for himself, Anno for a short time was able to exercise the chief authority in the Empire, but he was soon obliged to share this with his fellow conspirators, Archbishop Adalbert of Bremen and Archbishop Siegfried of Mainz, retaining for himself the supervision of Henry&#x27;s education and the title of &quot;magister&quot;.

The office of archchancellor of the Imperial Kingdom of Italy was at this period regarded as an appanage of the Archbishopric of Cologne, and this was probably the reason why Anno had a considerable share in settling a papal dispute brewing since 1061: relying on an assessment by his nephew Bishop Burchard of Halberstadt, he declared Alexander II to be the rightful pope at a synod held at Mantua in May 1064, and took other steps to secure his recognition against Empress Agnes&#x27; candidate Antipope Honorius II. Returning to Germany, however, he found the chief power in the hands of Archbishop Adalbert of Bremen, and as he was disliked by the young emperor, Anno gradually lost ground at the imperial court though he regained some of his former influence when Adalbert fell from power in 1066. In the same year he was able to secure the succession of his nephew, Conrad of Pfullingen, as Archbishop of Trier. By 1072 he had become imperial administrator and thus the second most powerful man, acting as an arbitrator in the rising Saxon Rebellion.

In the course of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the City of Cologne attained great prosperity. Local crafts flourished; the spinners, weavers, and dyers, the woollen-drapers, goldsmiths, sword-cutlers, and armour-makers of Cologne were especially celebrated. No city north of the Alps was so rich in great churches, sanctuaries, relics, and religious communities. It was known as the &quot;German Rome,&quot;. With the growth of the municipal prosperity, the pride of the citizens and their desire for independence also increased, and caused them to feel more dissatisfied with the sovereignty of the archbishop. This resulted in bitter feuds between the bishops and the city, which lasted for two centuries with varying fortunes. The first uprising occurred under Anno II, at Easter of the year 1074. The citizens rose against the archbishop, but were defeated within three days, and severely punished. It was reported he had allied himself with William the Conqueror, King of England, against the emperor. Having cleared himself of this charge, Anno took no further part in public business and died in Siegburg Abbey on 4 December 1075, where he was buried.

==Veneration==

He was canonised in 1183 by Pope Lucius III. He was a founder or co-founder of monasteries (Michaelsberg, Grafschaft, St. Maria ad Gradus, St. George, Saalfeld and Affligem) and a builder of churches, advocated clerical celibacy and introduced a strict discipline in a number of monasteries. He was a man of great energy and ability, whose action in recognizing Alexander II was of the utmost consequence for Henry IV and for Germany. He is the patron of gout sufferers.

Anno was the subject of two important literary works, the Latin &quot;Vita Annonis Minor&quot;, and the Middle High German &quot;Annolied&quot;.

<text>Livin&#x27; on the Fault Line is the seventh studio album by the American rock band the Doobie Brothers. The album was released on August 19, 1977, by Warner Bros. Records. It is one of the few Doobie Brothers albums of the 1970s which did not produce a Top 40 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 (although &quot;You Belong to Me&quot; was a hit as recorded by co-author Carly Simon). Still, the album received modest critical acclaim. Tom Johnston (guitar, vocals) left the band early in the sessions. He is listed as part of the band (appearing in the inside group photo) but appears on little or none of the actual album: he wrote and sang five songs during the sessions for the album, but they were not included on the final release. The track &quot;Little Darling (I Need You)&quot; is a remake of the Marvin Gaye 1966 hit.

<text>MoonBase Commander is a strategy video game released in 2002 by Humongous Entertainment. In the game, the player controls a main hub, which can send out other hubs, attack enemy structures, create defensive buildings, and collect energy for further expansion; this is accomplished through launching buildings and/or weapons from a hub. Each building is connected to its parent hub by a cord, which cannot overlap with other cords. The game features both single-player and multiplayer formats. It won the &quot;Best of 2002: The Game No One Played&quot; award from &quot;IGN&quot;.

==Gameplay==
The game is turn-based, allowing the player to spend a limited number of energy points per turn. The player can spend these energy points by attacking their opponents and/or adding more buildings to their base. Most units are ground-based and are attached by a cord to the unit that created them. Cords cannot overlap or land in water. Regardless of whether a unit is ground-based, all units need to be launched from their originating unit, similar to many artillery games. The power of a shot is not preset, but determined by how long the player holds down on the launch button. The longer it is held down, the further the unit launches. Wind can also affect the accuracy of launching units. Game maps wrap around at the edges, meaning that no player is ever in a corner.

&quot;MoonBase Commander&quot; has four factions that can be played: NiceCo, DeWulf, System7, and Team Alpha. The factions are functionally identical with only cosmetic differences.

The Skirmish mode allows the player to fight up to three computer players of varying difficulty levels. The goal of a skirmish is to destroy all opposing players.

Challenge Mode consists of sixteen premade missions, four for each faction. Each challenge has different goals, enemies, and settings. The player earns a Gold, Silver, or Bronze medal upon completing a challenge, based mainly on how long it took them to complete it. The challenges progress linearly and when one challenge is complete, the next is unlocked. The credits are played when all the challenges have been completed.

===Multiplayer===
Although the game has built in LAN functionality, Internet play is only accessible through third-party software. Initially Internet play was only available through &quot;GameSpy&quot;, but the Moonbase Commander Console was created shortly after the release of the original game to overcome this limitation and eventually became the most common method for fans to play online. In 2013, the source code to the Moonbase Commander Console was released under the MIT License. There is another utility called MoonbaseIP that also bypasses the need for GameSpy along with MBCImport which allows for custom maps and export/import maps.

==Development==
&quot;MoonBase Commander&quot; was developed on the SCUMM engine, best known for its use in LucasArts adventure games.

==Re-release==
In early 2014, &quot;MoonBase Commander&quot; was re-released on Steam in its complete and unabridged form. It includes the full original gameplay, both single player campaigns and local (LAN) multi-player.

==Reception and legacy==

&quot;MoonBase Commander&quot; received mostly positive reviews on GameRankings and Metacritic. It was praised by Tycho of &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; at the 2002 E3. Despite this, sales of the game were low, such that when an intellectual property valuation for Atari Interactive was performed in 2006, &quot;Moonbase Commander&quot; was estimated to be worth somewhere between $0 and $100,000. The rights to the &quot;MoonBase Commander&quot; franchise were sold at auction to Rebellion Developments following Atari&#x27;s bankruptcy.

The editors of &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; presented &quot;MoonBase Commander&quot; with their 2002 &quot;Best Budget Game&quot; award. It won &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Game No One Played on PC&quot; award.

<text>Kaiserwald (Ķeizarmežs) was a Nazi concentration camp near the Riga suburb of Mežaparks in modern-day Latvia.

Kaiserwald was built in March 1943, during the period that the German army occupied Latvia. The first inmates of the camp were several hundred convicts from Germany.

Following the liquidation of the Riga, Liepāja and Daugavpils (Dvinsk) ghettos in June 1943, the remainder of the Jews of Latvia, along with most of the survivors of the liquidation of the Vilna Ghetto, were deported to Kaiserwald.

In early 1944, a number of smaller camps around Riga were brought under the jurisdiction of the Kaiserwald camp.

Following the occupation of Hungary by the Germans, Hungarian Jews were sent to Kaiserwald, as were a number of Jews from Łódź, in Poland. By March 1944, there were 11,878 inmates in the camp and its subsidiaries, 6,182 males and 5,696 females, of whom only 95 were gentiles.

==Use of the inmates==
Unlike Auschwitz or Treblinka, Kaiserwald was not an extermination camp, and the inmates were put to work by large German companies, notably Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft, which used a large number of female slaves from Kaiserwald in the production of electrical goods, such as batteries.

==Evacuation==
On 5 August 1944, as the Red Army advanced westwards and entered Latvia, the Germans began to evacuate the inmates of Kaiserwald to Stutthof concentration camp, in Poland. All Jews under 18 or over 30 were murdered along with anyone who had been convicted of any offense or anyone who it was thought would be unable to survive the trip from Latvia to Poland. The remaining inmates who did not die during the journey arrived at Stutthof in September 1944.

The Red Army took over the camp on 15 October 1944 and later used the camp to house Axis prisoners of war.

<text>Bassano Bresciano (Brescian: ) is a &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy. As of 2011 Bassano Bresciano had a population of 2,237.

== History ==

During the Roman era, Bassano Bresciano (lat. &quot;Bassianum&quot;) was crossed by the &quot;Via Brixiana&quot;, a Roman consular road which connected Cremona &quot;(lat&quot;. &quot;Cremona&quot;) to Brescia (&quot;lat. Brixia&quot;), from which Roman roads passed and then branched out towards the entire Cisalpine Gaul.

== Observatory ==

The private Bassano Bresciano Observatory or Astronomical Observatory of Bassano Bresciano () is an astronomical observatory located at an altitude of 58 metres above sea level within the territory of Bassano Bresciano. It has the IAU code &quot;565&quot;. The Florian main-belt asteroid 6460 Bassano, discovered by Ulisse Quadri at Bassano Bresciano in 1992, was named for the village and its observatory. Naming citation was published on 9 September 1995 ().

First astrometric measurements were published in the Minor Planet Circulars in 1983, then obtained with a 15-cm reflecting telescope. On 29 April 1989, the observatory was officially inaugurated, when a 42-cm Schmidt telescope was installed, which has since been the observatory&#x27;s principal instrument. The telescope is installed on an equatorial fork mount, uses a Starlight HX516 CCD camera, and is housed on the first floor of a 5-meter dome building. Today the observatory is fully automated and remote controlled. Discoveries at the observatory include the minor planets 6460 Bassano, 6793 Palazzolo, 6981 Chirman and 22370 Italocalvino. The focus of the observatory&#x27;s main research activity has now shifted from astrometry of minor planets and comets, to photometric observations of planets and variable stars. In 2011, it also joined the international gamma-ray burst coordinates network. The observatory is open to the public on the occasion of important astronomical events.

<doc id="1038016" wikidata="Q2564612" url="?curid=1038016" title="Minute by Minute">
<text>Minute by Minute is the eighth studio album by American rock band the Doobie Brothers, released on December 1, 1978, by Warner Bros. Records. It was their last album to include members John Hartman (until &quot;Cycles&quot;) and Jeff &quot;Skunk&quot; Baxter.

The album spent 87 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. In the spring of 1979 &quot;Minute by Minute&quot; was the best-selling album in the U.S. for five non-consecutive weeks. It was certified 3× Platinum by the RIAA.

The song &quot;What a Fool Believes&quot; hit No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in April 1979 and became the band&#x27;s biggest hit. The title track and &quot;Depending on You&quot; were also released as singles and reached the top 30.

&quot;Minute by Minute&quot; made the Doobie Brothers one of the big winners at the 22nd Grammy Awards. The album got the trophy for Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group and received a nomination for Album of the Year. The single &quot;What a Fool Believes&quot; earned them three Grammys, including Song and Record of the Year.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; concluded that, &quot;with all the firepower this band has—one of rock&#x27;s strongest rhythm sections, several writers and vocalists, an excellent lead guitarist and a remarkable lead singer—the Doobie Brothers shouldn&#x27;t be content merely to skirt greatness.&quot;

<doc id="1038021" wikidata="Q3098626" url="?curid=1038021" title="Gary Sheffield">
<text>Gary Antonian Sheffield (born November 18, 1968) is an American former professional baseball outfielder who played in Major League Baseball for eight teams from 1988 to 2009. In retirement, he is a sports agent.

For most of his career, Sheffield played right field, though he has also played left field, third base, shortstop, and a handful of games at first base. He played for the Milwaukee Brewers, San Diego Padres, Florida Marlins, Los Angeles Dodgers, Atlanta Braves, New York Yankees, Detroit Tigers, and the New York Mets. Sheffield was a first-round pick of the Brewers, who selected him sixth overall in the amateur draft after a standout prep career at Hillsborough High School in Tampa, Florida. He batted and threw right-handed. Sheffield hit his 500th home run on April 17, 2009. As of his last game, Sheffield ranked second among all active players in walks (1,475), third in runs (1,636), fourth in RBIs (1,676), fifth in hits (2,689) and home runs (509), and sixth in hit by pitches (135). He is the only player in history to record 100 RBIs in a season for five different teams. Sheffield&#x27;s batting swing was an exemplary mix of savage speed and pinpoint control. Despite his high home run total, Sheffield only topped 80 strikeouts twice in 22 seasons, while finishing his career among the all-time top 20 walks leaders. Because of his combination of skill, sportswriter Joe Posnanski wrote, &quot;I can&#x27;t imagine there has ever been a scarier hitter to face.&quot; His first manager Tom Trebelhorn said, &quot;Gary can turn on a 38-caliber bullet.”

He is the nephew of Dwight Gooden. After retirement, he started to work as an agent. His clients include former reliever Jason Grilli. Sheffield was mentioned in the Mitchell Report and implicated in the 2004 BALCO scandal with respect to the use of performance-enhancing drugs.

==Early life==
Sheffield was born in Tampa, Florida, and grew up in Belmont Heights, near the Ponce de Leon projects. He and his family lived with his uncle, Dwight Gooden, who would go on to become the ace pitcher for the New York Mets. They played baseball frequently and Sheffield learned how to hit a fastball from Gooden, who is only four years older than he is.

Sheffield was a good hitter in the Little Leagues. However, Sheffield had problems with his temper and attitude, which would continue in the Major Leagues. Once, when he was late to practice, his coach benched him and Sheffield picked up a bat and chased the coach all over the field, resulting in him being kicked off the team for a year. When Sheffield was eleven, he was selected to the Belmont Heights Little League All-Stars, which included future Chicago Cubs #1 pick Ty Griffin, future Major Leaguer Derek Bell, and other future Major League Baseball (MLB) players. The team made it to the finals of the 1980 Little League World Series but lost to Taiwan 4–3. He set a record for doubles that would be broken in 2012 by Bradley Smith.

===High school===

In 1983, Sheffield made the Hillsborough High School varsity baseball team. During his junior year, he bulked up to 175 pounds and was a pitcher and third baseman. During his senior year, his fastball reached the upper 80&#x27;s and he frequently showed home run power. As a batter, Sheffield hit .500 and 15 home runs, in only 62 official at-bats. At the end of the season he was named the Gatorade National Player of the Year.

==Professional baseball career==

===Minor leagues===
After high school, the Milwaukee Brewers drafted Sheffield with the sixth pick of the first round of the 1986 MLB draft. Sheffield later said that if he had not been drafted in the first round, he probably would have played college baseball for the Miami Hurricanes. After being drafted he was shipped to Helena of the Pioneer League, where he had a .365 batting average and 71 RBIs in 57 games. The only question was what position he would play. He was slotted at shortstop, but struggled at the position, committing many errors and wild throws. In 1987, he was assigned to Stockton of the Class-A California League, where his defense improved and he produced at the plate. His batting average went below .300, but he led the league in RBIs with 103, and at the end of the year he was voted the Brewers&#x27; best prospect. In his third season, he went from Double-A to the majors. In 134 games for the El Paso Diablos and Denver, he batted .327 with 28 homers and 118 RBIs.

===Milwaukee Brewers===

Sheffield was called up from the minors when rosters were expanded in September and made his major league debut on September 3, 1988. As a teenager, he got off to a fast start, with his first career hit being a home run off Mark Langston, though Sheffield finished the season with a .238 batting average and four home runs in 24 games. After a decline in play and several injuries, he found himself competing with Bill Spiers in a race for starting shortstop. After this, he was moved to third base and criticized the team, saying it was a black and white issue. At the end of the 1989 season, he batted .247 with five home runs and 32 RBIs. In 1990, he worked under Don Baylor, who had been hired as their hitting coach. He finished the season batting .294, with 10 home runs. While his playing improved, there were issues with Sheffield in the clubhouse, and went as far as accusing the organization of being racist after keeping him at third instead of playing him at shortstop where the white Spiers played. In his final season with the Brewers, he injured his wrist, thumb, and shoulder, playing in only 50 games.

===San Diego Padres===
After four seasons in Milwaukee, the Brewers traded Sheffield to the San Diego Padres for Ricky Bones, José Valentin, and Matt Mieske on March 26, 1992. Sheffield faced his uncle Dwight Gooden for the first time in a Major League game on May 12, 1992, getting a hit in three at-bats. In his first All-Star season, he contended for the Triple Crown for much of the year; while he missed out on the home run (33, two fewer than the leader, teammate Fred McGriff) and RBIs (100, nine fewer than leader Darren Daulton) titles, he won the National League batting title (the only one of the nine in Padre history not won by Tony Gwynn) with a .330 average. In 1993, he started the season by hitting 10 home runs and batting .295 and was traded in midseason to the Florida Marlins.

===Florida Marlins===
On June 24, 1993, he was traded, with Rich Rodriguez, to the Florida Marlins for Trevor Hoffman, José Martínez and Andrés Berumen. He finished the season hitting 10 home runs, batting .292 and knocking in 37 runs while with the Marlins, and was the starting third baseman for the NL in the All-Star Game. At the end of the season, the Marlins gave him a four-year deal that made him the highest-paid player at third base. During the 1994 season, the Marlins moved him from third base to right field. Sheffield hit 112 home runs with the Marlins from 1994 to 1998, including 42 in 1996, making the All-Star Game in 1996, and leading them to victory in the 1997 World Series against the Cleveland Indians. On July 13, 1997, Sheffield became the first player in Florida Marlins history to hit two home runs in one inning. He was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1998 because the Marlins allegedly could not afford a contract extension and because the Dodgers&#x27; parent company at the time, News Corporation, was looking to secure a television contract with the Marlins in exchange for trading popular Dodger Mike Piazza.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
On May 14, 1998, he was traded along with Manuel Barrios, Charles Johnson, Bobby Bonilla, and Jim Eisenreich to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Mike Piazza and Todd Zeile. Sheffield finished the season with the Dodgers batting .316 and hitting 16 homers while driving in 57 runs. In 3½ seasons with the Dodgers, he hit 129 home runs and drove in 367 runs. He made three All-Star games while playing with the Dodgers and had become one of the best outfielders in the game. But during the off-season, he began lobbying for a trade because he thought the Dodgers were spending their money stupidly and sliding in the wrong direction, and publicly criticized coaches and teammates.

===Atlanta Braves===
On January 15, 2002, Sheffield was traded to the Atlanta Braves for Brian Jordan, Odalis Pérez, and Andrew Brown. He spent two seasons with the Braves hitting 64 home runs and knocking in 216 RBIs including 132 in 2003. After two seasons with the Braves, he became a free agent for the first time in his long career on October 27, 2003.

===New York Yankees===
On December 19, 2003, after negotiations between Sheffield and George Steinbrenner, a contract was agreed upon with the New York Yankees worth $39 million over three years. This deal included $13.5 million in deferred money and a $13 million team option for 2007. He joined a lineup that included Derek Jeter, Jason Giambi and the newly acquired Alex Rodriguez. In his first season with the Yankees, Sheffield started slowly, but finished the season with 36 home runs, 121 RBIs, and a .290 batting average, helping him finish second in the MVP voting behind Vladimir Guerrero. On July 27 Sheffield hit his 400th career home run off of Micheal Nakamura of the Toronto Blue Jays in the top of the 9th inning.

In his second season with the Yankees, he continued to play well, hitting another 34 home runs and driving in 123 runs.

On April 14, 2005, a Red Sox fan leaned over the railing at Fenway Park and distracted Sheffield as he was going to field a ball hit by Jason Varitek. After Sheffield took a swing at him with his glove, he threw the ball back into the infield, and then got into a verbal altercation with him. Fan Interference was not called, resulting in a game tying RBI triple for Varitek. The fan, a long-time season ticket holder, was not ejected from Fenway Park, but he donated his remaining 2005 season tickets to charity in an effort to avoid any controversy for the remainder of the season. Sheffield was fined for the incident. Charges were dismissed against both the fan and Sheffield.

Sheffield started the 2006 season on pace for a .300 batting average and 30 homers, before he collided with Shea Hillenbrand of the Toronto Blue Jays on April 29, 2006. He tried to play despite the injury, but ultimately needed wrist surgery. Sheffield did not return until late September. He had lost his right field job to Bobby Abreu, whom the Yankees had acquired in a trade deadline transaction. This forced Sheffield to play first base for the first time in his MLB career. At the end of the 2006 season, the Yankees picked up Sheffield&#x27;s 2007 option and traded him to the Detroit Tigers.

During a July 2007 interview with HBO&#x27;s &quot;Real Sports&quot;, Sheffield said that Yankees manager Joe Torre treated black players differently from white players during his time there, citing himself, Kenny Lofton and Tony Womack as examples. Lofton later agreed with Sheffield&#x27;s comments about being treated differently, but disagreed that race was the motivating factor. After it was pointed out that Derek Jeter is biracial, Sheffield responded that he wasn&#x27;t &quot;all the way black.&quot;

===Detroit Tigers===

On November 10, 2006, the Yankees traded Sheffield to the Detroit Tigers for minor league pitchers Humberto Sánchez, Kevin Whelan, and Anthony Claggett. After the trade, Sheffield agreed to a two-year, $28 million extension. In his first season with the Tigers, he hit 25 home runs, with 75 RBIs, and a .265 batting average. Sheffield also hit his first triple since 2004 and stole 20 bases for the first time since 1990. He was also one of only six batters in the AL to have at least 20 home runs and 20 stolen bases, along with Alex Rodriguez, Grady Sizemore, Ian Kinsler, B.J. Upton and teammate at the time Curtis Granderson.

On September 8, in a game against Oakland, Sheffield hit the 250,000th regular season home run in Major League Baseball history according to Baseball-Reference.com. The home run was a grand slam off Gio González; Sheffield had hit baseball&#x27;s 249,999th home run against Gonzalez in his previous at-bat. Sheffield ended the 2008 season with 499 career home runs.

On September 19, 2008, Sheffield was hit by a pitch from Cleveland Indians pitcher Roberto Heredia Hernández and walked to first base. When Hernández threw to first base, he and Sheffield exchanged words and Sheffield charged the mound, attempting to tackle Hernández but being caught in a headlock and punched a few times on the top of his head by the young pitcher, leading to a bench-clearing brawl. Hernández and Sheffield were both ejected, along with Indians catcher Víctor Martínez and Tigers second baseman Plácido Polanco. On September 22, the commissioner&#x27;s office announced four suspensions resulting from the brawl: Hernández was suspended for six games, Sheffield received a four-game suspension, and Martinez and Indians infielder Asdrúbal Cabrera each received three-game suspensions. Sheffield made statements after the suspension that the involved players from the Indians would be &quot;penalized&quot; by him as well.

On March 31, 2009, Sheffield was released by the Tigers despite being owed $14M. The Tigers said in a statement that they wanted to have more versatility with the DH position.

===New York Mets===

On April 3, Sheffield agreed to a deal with the New York Mets for the season, and he finalized the deal the following day.

On April 17, Sheffield hit his 500th home run in a game against the Milwaukee Brewers, becoming the 25th player in MLB history to reach that milestone, the first player to achieve this as a pinch-hitter, and the first to do so in a Mets uniform. Sheffield would also become the third player in Major League history to hit home runs before age 20 and after age 40, joining Ty Cobb and Rusty Staub. Alex Rodriguez became the fourth player to do so in 2015. Sheffield sat out a game in August when the Mets declined to offer him a contract extension.

===Retirement===
Sheffield did not play in 2010. Though he initially suggested he wanted to sign with a team for the 2011 season, he announced his retirement at the beginning of 2011 spring training.

===National Baseball Hall of Fame consideration===
Sheffield first appeared on balloting for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2015, when he received 11.7% of the vote, well short of the 75% required for election, but above the 5% minimum required to remain on the ballot.
In 2024, his tenth and final appearance on the BBWAA ballot, he received 63.9%, falling short of the necessary threshold.

==Steroid allegations==
During a workout with Barry Bonds in 2001, a cream was applied to Sheffield&#x27;s knee by a trainer to help heal ripped stitches from a knee surgery. Sheffield states in his book, &quot;Inside Power&quot;, that he had no knowledge of the cream containing steroids, and had no reason to assume so at the time. He goes on to say in his book that the cream did nothing to strengthen his knee, and also states that a look at his numbers shows no improvement after the incident.

On December 13, 2007, Sheffield was named in the Mitchell Report as one of the players who had obtained and used steroids. Sheffield agreed to meet with the report&#x27;s investigators for an interview but, due to the unavailability of his attorney, no interview could be scheduled before the report was published.

In their book &quot;Game of Shadows&quot;, reporters Mark Fainaru-Wada and Lance Williams allege that Sheffield worked with and received steroids such as testosterone and human growth hormone from his and Barry Bonds&#x27;s personal trainer Greg Anderson. The book also details steroid calendars found in possession of Anderson outlining numerous steroid cycles Sheffield was to have undertaken after the 2001 season.

==Personal life==
In 1986, Sheffield was arrested alongside his uncle, Dwight Gooden, and fellow Tampa baseball player Vance Lovelace and charged with resisting arrest with violence and battery on a police officer. He pleaded no contest in January 1987 and was sentenced to two years probation.

In October 1987, while still on probation, Sheffield was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated and related offenses. Those charges were eventually consolidated into one reckless driving charge. His probation was extended for an additional 18 months.

On December 5, 1993, Sheffield was arrested after being clocked driving a Ferrari Testarossa on Interstate 4 in Florida and failing a breathalyzer test. In May 1994, he pleaded no contest to reckless driving and was sentenced again to nine months of probation and 40 hours of community service.

In October 1995, Sheffield was shot in his left shoulder after an attempted robbery when he stopped his car at a traffic light in Tampa.

Throughout his career, Sheffield was verbal about his need for sufficient financial compensation and respect, demanding better pay when he was with the Dodgers, and refusing to play in the inaugural World Baseball Classic, saying the regular &quot;season is when [he&#x27;s] getting paid.&quot;

Sheffield and his wife Deleon reside in Tampa, Florida. They have three sons Jaden Sheffield, Noah Sheffield, and Christian Sheffield. Sheffield has five other children from previous relationships. Deleon is a gospel recording artist and has sung the National Anthem at Yankee Stadium during a playoff game with Sheffield on the lineup. In February 2005, a man was arraigned in federal court on charges of extorting Sheffield by threatening to release a sex tape of Deleon with an ex-boyfriend. In January 2006, the man was sentenced to 27 months in prison.

Sheffield&#x27;s cousin, Derrick Pedro, played outfield in the Milwaukee Brewers organization. Sheffield&#x27;s cousin, Tim Carter, played professional football as a wide receiver.

In the June 2007 issue of &quot;GQ&quot; magazine, Sheffield (a Detroit Tiger at the time) was quoted saying that there are more Latin baseball players than African-American players because Latinos are easier to control. &quot;What I said is that you&#x27;re going to see more black faces, but there ain&#x27;t no English going to be coming out. ... (It&#x27;s about) being able to tell (Latin players) what to do — being able to control them... Where I&#x27;m from, you can&#x27;t control us.&quot; He continued &quot;They have more to lose than we do. You can send them back across the island. You can&#x27;t send us back. We&#x27;re already here.&quot;

The MPAA and other groups which lobby in favour of intellectual property (specifically copyright and trademark) regulations have labelled such decryption as &quot;signal theft&quot; and object to it, arguing that losing out on a potential chance to profit from a consumer&#x27;s subscription fees counts as a loss of actual profit.

== History ==
The concept of pay TV or pay television involves a broadcaster deliberately transmitting signals in a non-standard, scrambled or encrypted format in order to charge viewers a subscription fee for the use of a special decoder needed to receive the scrambled broadcast signal. 

Early pay TV broadcasts in countries such as the United States used standard over-the-air transmitters; many restrictions applied as anti-siphoning laws were enacted to prevent broadcasters of scrambled signals from engaging in activities to harm the development of standard free-to-air commercial broadcasting. Scrambled signals were limited to large communities which already had a certain minimum number of unencrypted broadcast stations, relegated to certain frequencies. Restrictions were placed on access of pay TV broadcasters to content such as recent feature films in order to give free TV broadcasters a chance to air these programs before they were siphoned away by pay channels.

Under these conditions, the pay TV concept was very slow to become commercially viable; most television and radio broadcasts remained in-the-clear and were funded by commercial advertising, individual and corporate donations to educational broadcasters, direct funding by governments or license fees charged to the owners of receiving apparatus (the BBC in the UK, for example).

Pay TV only began to become common after the widespread installation of cable television systems in the 1970s and 1980s; early premium channels were most often movie broadcasters such as the US-based Home Box Office and Cinemax, both currently owned by Warner Bros. Discovery. Signals were obtained for distribution by cable companies using C-band satellite dish antennae of up to ten feet in diameter; the first satellite signals were originally unencrypted as extremely few individual end-users could afford the large and expensive satellite receiving apparatus.

As satellite dishes became smaller and more affordable, most satellite signal providers adopted various forms of encryption in order to limit reception to certain groups (such as hotels, cable companies, or paid subscribers) or to specific political regions. Early encryption attempts such as Videocipher II were common targets for pirate decryption as dismayed viewers saw large amounts of formerly-unencrypted programming vanishing. Nowadays some free-to-air satellite content in the USA still remains, but many of the channels still in the clear are ethnic channels, local over-the-air TV stations, international broadcasters, religious programming, backfeeds of network programming destined to local TV stations or signals uplinked from mobile satellite trucks to provide live news and sports coverage.

Specialty channels and premium movie channels are most often encrypted; in most countries, broadcasts containing explicit pornography must be encrypted to prevent accidental viewing.

== Technical issues ==
Initial attempts to encrypt broadcast signals were based on analogue techniques of questionable security, the most common being one or a combination of techniques such as:
* Weakening or attenuating specific portions of the video signal, typically those required to maintain synchronization.
* Inverting video signals so that white becomes black (and vice versa).
* Adding an interfering signal at one specific frequency which could be simply filtered out at a suitably equipped receiver.
* Moving the audio portion of the signal to some other frequency or sending it in a non-standard format.

These systems were designed to provide decoders to cable operators at low cost; a serious tradeoff was made in security. Some analogue decoders were addressable so that cable companies could turn channels on or off remotely, but this only gave the cable companies control of their own descramblers — valuable if needed to deactivate a stolen cable company decoder but useless against hardware designed by signal pirates.

The first encryption methods used for big-dish satellite systems used a hybrid approach; analogue video and digital encrypted audio. This approach was somewhat more secure, but not completely free of problems due to piracy of video signals.

Digital TV services, by nature can more easily implement encryption technologies. When first introduced, digital DBS broadcasts were touted as being secure enough to put an end to piracy once and for all. Often these claims would be made in press releases.

The enthusiasm was short-lived. In theory the system was an ideal solution, but some corners had been cut in the initial implementations in the rush to launch the service. The first US DirecTV smart cards were based on the BSkyB VideoCrypt card known as the Sky 09 card. The Sky 09 card had been introduced in 1994 as a replacement for the compromised Sky 07 card. The former had been totally compromised in Europe at the time (1995). The countermeasure employed by NDS Group, the designers of the VideoCrypt system was to issue a new smartcard (known as the Sky 10 card) that included an ASIC in addition to the card&#x27;s microcontroller. This innovation made it harder for pirates to manufacture pirate VideoCrypt cards. Previously, the program in the Sky card&#x27;s microcontroller could be rewritten for other microcontrollers without too much difficulty. The addition of an ASIC took the battle between the system designers and pirates to another level and it bought BSkyB at least six months of almost piracy-free broadcasting before the pirate Sky 10 cards appeared on the market in 1996. Initial pirate Sky 10 cards had an implementation of this ASIC but once supplies ran out, pirates resorted to extracting the ASICs from deactivated Sky cards and reusing them.

The first US DirecTV &quot;F&quot; card did not contain an ASIC and it was quickly compromised. Pirate DirecTV cards based on microcontrollers that were often ironically more secure than that used in the official card became a major problem for DirecTV. Similar errors had been made by the developers of the UK&#x27;s terrestrial digital Xtraview Encryption System, which provided no encryption and relied on hiding channels from listings.

The DirecTV &quot;F&quot; card was replaced with the &quot;H&quot; card, which contained an ASIC to handle decryption. However, due to similarities between the &quot;H&quot; and other existing cards, it became apparent that while the signal could not be received without the card and its ASIC, the card itself was vulnerable to tampering by reprogramming it to add channel tiers or additional programming, which allowed them to be viewed without paying.

Two more card swaps would be necessary before DirecTV could reduce piracy by a significant amount; a number of other providers are also in the middle of swapping out all of their subscribers&#x27; smartcards due to compromised encryption methods or technology.

A number of vulnerabilities exist even with digital encryption:

* The same algorithm is used, potentially, for millions of subscribed receivers and or smartcards. The designers have the choice of using their own custom, secret algorithm or using a publicly tested one. The first approach is often referred to as security by obscurity. 
* With many digital TV encryption systems relying on smartcards for their security, any compromise of the smartcard would require a complete replacement of all smartcards being used. That could potentially involve the replacement of millions of smartcards. On a system with a low number of subscribers, the smartcards can be replaced periodically. However, as the number of subscribers grows, the cost of replacing the smartcards and the logistics of the replacement encourages the system users to try to get the longest use out of the smartcards before replacement. The chances of a fatal compromise on the smartcard increases as the time between replacement increases.
* Any compromise of the smartcard or algorithm will become public quickly. Computers and Internet can be used to make crucial design details publicly available. Internet sites may be located offshore in countries where local laws permit the information and software to be distributed openly; some of the more notorious software distributed to pirates ranges from NagraEdit (a program intended to edit the information stored on Swiss-designed Kudelski NagraVision 1 smartcards) to firmware which may be used to reprogram some free-to-air set-top boxes or desktop PCs equipped with Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) tuner cards to permit them to decode encrypted broadcasts.
* The secrecy of any algorithm is only as trustworthy as the people with access to the algorithm; if any of them were to divulge any of the design secrets, every card with the compromised algorithm may need to be replaced for security to be restored. In some cases, outside personnel (such as those employed by lawyers in the NDS vs. DirecTV intellectual property lawsuit over the P4 card design) may obtain access to key and very sensitive information, increasing the risk of the information being leaked for potential use by pirates.
* If less secure encryption is used due to processor limitations on the smartcards, the system is vulnerable to cryptographic attack using distributed processing. While most secure Internet and online banking transactions require 128-bit encryption, 56-bit codes are not uncommon in video encryption. A cryptographic attack against a 56-bit DES code would still be prohibitively time-consuming on a single processor. A distributed approach in which many users each run software to scan just a portion of the possible combinations, then upload results to one or more central points on a network such as the Internet, may provide information of value to pirates who wish to break security. Distributed processing attacks were used, successfully in some cases, against the D2-MAC/EuroCrypt system used in Europe during the 1990s.
* The resources available for reverse engineering increase significantly if a direct competitor with smartcard manufacturing knowledge were to attempt to maliciously compromise the system. Integrated circuits may be vulnerable to microprobing or analysis under an electron microscope once acid or chemical means have been used to expose the bare silicon circuitry. One lawsuit has already been launched by Canal+, dropped as the result of the one billion Euro deal to sell TelePiu (Italy), then continued by Echostar (USA). The suit alleged that competitor NDS Group had maliciously used reverse engineering to obtain the computer programs contained within various pay-TV smartcards (including SECA and Nagra cards) and allowed the results to be posted to Internet sites such as the notorious DR7.com.

On May 15, 2008, a jury in the Echostar vs NDS civil lawsuit (8:2003cv00950) awarded Echostar just over US$1,500 in damages; Echostar originally sought $1 billion in damages from NDS. However, a jury was not convinced of the allegations Echostar had made against NDS and awarded damages only for the factual claims that were proven and for which the jury believed an award should be given in accordance with the laws of the United States.

* The signals moving between the smartcard and the receiver can be intercepted and analyzed. They can also be vulnerable to an attack by which the incoming power and clock signals are disrupted for a short and carefully timed length of time (such as a millionth of a second) in order to cause the processor to skip an instruction. In many cases, off-the-shelf hardware with modified firmware designed to exploit this weakness was sold to pirates for use in tampering with cards for the US-based DirecTV system.
* In some cases, buffer overflow exploits have been used to gain access to otherwise locked cards in order to reprogram them.
* A scheme to monitor the exact instantaneous power consumption of smartcards as they make their computations also provides clues as to what type of computations are being performed.

In some cases, fraudulent cloning has been used to assign identical serial numbers to multiple receivers or cards; subscribe (or unsubscribe) one receiver and the same programming changes appear on all of the others. Various techniques have also been used to provide write protection for memory on the smartcards or receivers to make deactivation or sabotage of tampered cards by signal providers more difficult.

Systems based on removable smartcards do facilitate the implementation of renewable security, where compromised systems can be repaired by sending new and redesigned cards to legitimate subscribers, but they also make the task of replacing smartcards with tampered cards or inserting devices between card and receiver easier for pirates. In some European systems, the conditional-access module (CAM) which serves as a standardized interface between smartcard and DVB receiver has also been targeted for tampering or replaced by third-party hardware.

Improvements in hardware and system design can be used to significantly reduce the risks of any encryption system being compromised, but many systems once thought secure have been proven vulnerable to sufficiently sophisticated and malicious attackers.

Two-way communication has also been used by designers of proprietary digital cable TV equipment in order to make tampering more difficult or easier to detect. A system involving the use of a high-pass filter on the line to prevent two-way communication has been widely promoted by some businesses as a means of disabling communication of billing information for pay-per-view programming but this device is effectively worthless as a cable operator remains free to unsubscribe a digital set-top box if two-way communication has been lost. As a device intended to pass signals in one direction only, the line filters offer nothing that couldn&#x27;t be done (with the same results) by an inexpensive signal booster - a simple one-way RF amplifier widely available cheaply and readily for other purposes. Also, many such boxes will disallow access to pay-per-view content after a set number of programs are watched before the box can transmit this data to the headend, further reducing the usefulness of such a filter.

==Terminology and Definitions==
Some of the terminology used to describe various devices, programs and techniques dealing with Pay-TV piracy is named for the particular hacks. The &quot;Season&quot; interface for example is named after the Season7 hack on Sky TV which allowed a PC to emulate a legitimate Sky-TV smartcard. The Season7 referred to the seventh and final season of Star Trek: The Next Generation which was then showing on Sky One. The &quot;Phoenix&quot; hack was named after the mythical bird which can reanimate itself. The hack itself reactivated smartcards that had been switched off by the providers.

Some of the terminology used on Internet discussion sites to describe the various devices, programs and techniques used in dealing with video piracy is strange, non-standard, or specific to one system. The terms are often no different from the brand names used by legitimate products and serve the same function.

===ISO/IEC 7816 smartcard terminology===
* ATR is the answer-to-reset data from an ISO/IEC 7816-compliant smartcard. A card reader would provide power, clock and reset signals to a smartcard, along with a bidirectional serial data interface to permit communication. On reset, the card would send a standard block of serial data (nominally at 9600 bit/s) to identify the card type and indicate the desired bitrate for further communication. The frequency of clock to be supplied may vary from one system or card type to another as it appears not to have been specified in the ISO standard.
* A smart card reader is a device that allows a computer to communicate with a smartcard. Technically, these are simple devices consisting of a smartcard socket, some voltage level conversion circuitry and a crystal oscillator to supply the card with its clock signal. Early models were connected to the serial port on computers so the interface circuitry had to convert between the ISO/IEC 7816 card voltage levels and the RS-232 voltage levels used by the computer&#x27;s serial port. More recent models use a USB connection to the computer. The simplest of earlier devices was the &quot;Phoenix interface&quot;. More sophisticated readers are often used in systems where the personal computer itself is to be secured using smartcard systems.
* &quot;AVR&quot; and &quot;ATmega&quot; are trade names for a series of general-purpose 8-bit microcontroller chips manufactured by Atmel Corporation. The terms have been misused widely to refer to blank smartcards or various other hardware devices which were built around these processors. The widely available European &quot;funcard&quot; series of blank generic ISO/IEC 7816 smartcards were based upon the Atmel processor series; there was also a &quot;PIC card&quot; based on the Microchip Corporation PIC series of processors.
* Emulation refers to the use of a personal computer in place of a smartcard using an ISO/IEC 7816-compatible &quot;Season&quot; interface. The PC, as far as the decoder is concerned, becomes a legitimate smartcard due to the program running on it. The program responds like a legitimate smartcard. Sometimes, for development purposes, the PC is programmed to simulate the entire instruction set of the smartcard&#x27;s microcontroller to allow smartcard code to be developed more readily. As some encryption systems require an application-specific IC (ASIC) on the card to perform decryption, a pirate would also use a card which had been &quot;auxed&quot; (reprogrammed to pass received computer data directly to the application-specific decryption chip) in order to employ such an emulation system. Alternatively, pirates can sometimes emulate the functionality of the ASIC itself to gain access to the encrypted data.
* A looped smartcard is one where defective or malicious program code written to non-volatile memory causes the smartcard&#x27;s microcontroller to enter an endless loop on power-up or reset, rendering the card unusable. This is typically a countermeasure used by encryption system owners to permanently deactivate smartcards. In many cases, not even the ISO/IEC 7816 ATR message would be sent. &quot;Unloopers&quot; were smartcard repair stations intended to cause the card to skip one or more instructions by applying a &quot;glitch&quot; in some form to the power or clock signal in the hope of allowing the smartcard&#x27;s microcontroller to exit from the endless loop.
* &quot;Bootloaders&quot; were hardware which used a similar &quot;glitch&quot; to break a card out of an endless loop on power-up each time the card was used; these did not provide any smartcard reprogramming ability. These could permit DirecTV &quot;H&quot; cards (now no longer in use) to operate despite the permanent damage done by malicious code during the &quot;Black Sunday&quot; attack of 2001. These devices are currently believed to be obsolete.

===Receiver (IRD) and microprocessor terminology===
* DVB is an international standard for digital video broadcasting used by virtually all European broadcasters; some North American providers use incompatible proprietary standards such as DSS (DirecTV) or DigiCipher (Motorola) which predate the DVB standardisation effort. The packet size, tables and control information transmitted by proprietary systems require proprietary non-DVB receivers, even though the video itself nominally in some form will often still adhere to the MPEG-2 image compression standard defined by the Moving Picture Experts Group.
* An IRD is an integrated receiver-decoder, in other words a complete digital satellite TV or radio receiver; &quot;decoder&quot; in this context refers not to decryption but to the decompression and conversion of MPEG video into displayable format.
* FTA is often used to refer to receivers and equipment which contain no decryption hardware, built with the intention of being able to receive unencrypted free-to-air broadcasts; more properly FTA refers to the unencrypted broadcasts themselves.
* A CAM or conditional-access module is defined by the DVB standard as an interface between a standardised DVB Common Interface receiver and one or more proprietary smartcards for signal decryption. It is not the smartcard itself. The standard format of this module follows PCMCIA specifications; some receivers bypass the requirement for a separate module by providing embedded CAM functionality in the receiver to communicate with specific proprietary smartcards such as Nagravision, Conax, Irdeto, Viaccess, Betacrypt. In the North American market, most &quot;package receivers&quot; sold by signal providers provide embedded CAM operation; terminology is therefore often misused to misidentify the smartcard as a CAM.
* JTAG is a standard test interface defined by the Joint Test Action Group and supported on many late-model digital receivers for factory test purposes. Operating using a six-wire interface and a personal computer, the JTAG interface was originally intended to provide a means to test and debug embedded hardware and software. In the satellite TV world, JTAG is most often used to obtain read-write access to nonvolatile memory within a digital receiver; initially programs such as Wall and JKeys were used to read box keys from receivers with embedded CAMs but JTAG has since proven its legitimate worth to satellite TV fans as a repair tool to fix receivers where the firmware (in flash memory) has been corrupted.
* The &quot;Sombrero de Patel&quot; is another device used to obtain direct memory access to a receiver without physically removing memory chips from the board to place them in sockets or read them with a specialized device programmer. The device consists of a standard PLCC integrated circuit socket which has been turned upside-down in order to be placed directly over a microprocessor already permanently soldered to a printed circuit board in a receiver; the socket makes electrical contact with all pins of the microprocessor and is interfaced to one or more microcontrollers which use direct memory access to pause the receiver&#x27;s microprocessor and read or write directly to the memory. The term &quot;sombrero&quot; is used for this hack as the novel use of an inverted IC socket somewhat resembles a hat being placed upon the main processor.

== SmartCard piracy ==
Smart card piracy involves the unauthorised use of conditional-access smart cards, in order to gain, and potentially provide to others, unauthorised access to pay-TV or even private media broadcasts. Smart card piracy generally occurs after a breach of security in the smart card, exploited by computer hackers in order to gain complete access to the card&#x27;s encryption system.

Once access has been gained to the smart card&#x27;s encryption system, the hacker can perform changes to the card&#x27;s internal information, which in turn tricks the conditional-access system into believing that it has been allowed access, by the legitimate card provider, to other television channels using the same encryption system. In some cases, the channels do not even have to be from the same television provider, since many providers use similar encryption systems, or use cards which have the capacity to store information for decoding those channels also. The information on how to hack the card is normally held within small, underground groups, to which public access is not possible. Instead, the hacking groups may release their hack in several forms. One such way is simply to release the encryption algorithm and key. Another common release method is by releasing a computer program which can be used by the smart card user to reprogram their card. Once complete, the now illegally modified smart card is known as a &quot;MOSC&quot;. (Modified Original Smart Card). A third such method, more common in recent times, is to sell the information gained on the encryption to a third party, who will then release their own smart card, such as the K3 card. This third party, for legal reasons, will then use a fourth party to release encrypted files, which then allow the card to decode encrypted content.

Along with modifying original cards, it is possible to use the information provided by the smart card to create an encryption emulator. This, in turn, can be programmed into a cable or satellite receiver&#x27;s internal software, and offered for download on the internet as a firmware upgrade. This allows access to the encrypted channels by those who do not even own a smart card. In recent times, many underground forum websites dedicated to the hobby of satellite piracy and encryption emulated Free To Air (FTA) receivers have been set up, giving up-to-date information on satellite and cable piracy, including making available firmware downloads for receivers, and very detailed encryption system information available to the public.

Upon gaining the knowledge that their system has been compromised, the smart card providers often have several counter measure systems against unauthorised viewing, which can be put in place over the air, in most cases causing virtually no disruption to legitimate viewers. One such measure is CI revocation. The simplest form of counter measure is a key change. This simply halts viewing for those viewing without authorisation temporarily, since the new key can easily be accessed in the hacked card, and implemented. There are often other more complicated procedures which update a part of the smart card in order to make it inaccessible. These procedures can also, however, be hacked, once again allowing access. This leads to a game of &quot;cat and mouse&quot; between the smart card provider, and the hackers. This, after several stages of progression, can leave the smart card provider in a situation where they no longer have any further counter measures to implement. This leaves them in a situation where they must perform a card and encryption change with all legitimate viewers, in order to eliminate the viewing of the service without permission, at least for the foreseeable future.

Such has been the success of implementing new smart card systems, that another form of smart card piracy has grown in popularity. This method is called card sharing, which works by making available the smart card decoding information in real time to other users, via a computer network. Police monitoring of unsecured card sharing networks has led to prosecutions.

Virtually every common encryption system is publicly known to have been compromised. These include Viaccess, Nagravision, SECA Mediaguard and Conax. The MediaCipher system, owned by Motorola, along with Scientific Atlanta&#x27;s PowerKEY system, are the only digital TV encryption systems which have not publicly been compromised. This is largely thanks to there being no PC card conditional-access modules (CAMs) available for either encryption system.

Despite the unauthorised decryption of media being illegal in many countries, smart card piracy is a crime which is very rarely punished, due to it being virtually undetectable, particularly in the case of satellite viewing. Laws in many countries do not clearly specify whether the decryption of foreign media services is illegal or not. This has caused much confusion in places such as Europe, where the proximity of many countries, coupled with the large land mass covered by satellite beams, allows signal access to many different providers. These providers are reluctant to pursue criminal charges against many viewers as they live in different countries. There have, however, been several high-profile prosecution cases in the USA, where satellite dealers have been taken to court resulting in large fines or jail time.

== Internet key sharing ==

An Internet key sharing scheme consists of one smart card with a valid, paid subscription which is located on an Internet server. It generates a stream of real-time decryption keys which are broadcast over the Internet to remotely located satellite receivers. Limiting factors in the number of remotely located satellite receivers are the network latency and the period between the updated keys and the ability of the card client&#x27;s receiver to use the decrypted key stream.

Each receiver is configured in an identical manner, a clone receiving the same television signal from a satellite and, from the internet server, the same decryption keys to unlock that signal. As the server must have individually subscribed smart cards for each channel to be viewed, its continued operation tends to be costly and may require multiple subscriptions under different names and addresses. There is also a risk that as the number of card clients on the card sharing network grows, it will attract the attention of the satellite TV service provider and law enforcement agencies and the monitoring of IP addresses associated with this card sharing network may identify individual users and server operators who then become targets for legal action by the satellite TV service provider or by legal authorities.

Key sharing schemes are typically used where replacement of compromised smart card systems (such as the deprecation of Nagra 1/2 in favour of Nagra 3) has made other pirate decryption methods non-functional.

In February 2014, an episode of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Inside Out&quot; disclosed that the complete Sky TV package could be obtained from black-market sources for as little as £10 per month through Internet key sharing, Swansea and Cardiff were highlighted with significant activity in pubs using cracked boxes to show Premier League football.

== Political issues ==
In some countries such as Canada and many Caribbean nations (except for the Dominican Republic), the black market in satellite TV piracy is closely tied to the gray market activity of using direct broadcast satellite signals to watch broadcasts intended for one country in some other, adjacent country. Many smaller countries have no domestic DBS operations and therefore few or no legal restrictions on the use of decoders which capture foreign signals.

The refusal of most providers to knowingly issue subscriptions outside their home country leads to a situation where pirate decryption is perceived as being one of the few ways to obtain certain programming. If there is no domestic provider for a channel, a grey market (subscribed using another address) or black market (pirate) system is prerequisite to receive many specific ethnic, sport or premium movie services.

Pirate or grey-market reception also provides viewers a means to bypass local blackout restrictions on sporting events and to access hard-core pornography where some content is not otherwise available.

The grey market for US satellite receivers in Canada at one point was estimated to serve as many as several hundred thousand English-speaking Canadian households. Canadian authorities, acting under pressure from cable companies and domestic broadcasters, have made many attempts to prevent Canadians from subscribing to US direct-broadcast services such as AT&amp;T&#x27;s DirecTV and Echostar&#x27;s Dish Network.

While litigation has gone as far as the Supreme Court of Canada, no judicial ruling has yet been made on whether such restrictions violate the safeguards of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms which are intended to protect freedom of expression and prevent linguistic or ethnic discrimination. Domestic satellite and cable providers have adopted a strategy of judicial delay in which their legal counsel will file an endless series of otherwise-useless motions before the courts to ensure that the proponents of the grey-market systems run out of money before the &quot;Charter Challenge&quot; issue is decided.

According to K. William McKenzie, the Orillia Ontario lawyer who won the case in the Supreme Court of Canada, a consortium headed by David Fuss and supported by Dawn Branton and others later launched a constitutional challenge to defeat section 9(1)(c) of the Radiocommunication Act on the basis that it breached the guarantee of Freedom of Expression enshrined in section 2 (c) of the Canadian Charter of Rights.

The evidence compiled by Mr. McKenzie from his broadcasting clients in opposition to this challenge was so overwhelming that it was abandoned and the Court ordered that substantial costs be paid by the applicants.

In most cases, broadcast distributors will require a domestic billing address before issuing a subscription; post boxes and commercial mail receiving agencies are often used by grey-market subscribers to foreign providers to circumvent this restriction.

The situation in the US itself differs as it is complicated by the legal question of subscriber access to distant local TV stations. Satellite providers are severely limited in their ability to offer subscriptions to distant locals due to the risk of further lawsuits by local affiliates of the same network in the subscribers home designated market area. California stations have sued satellite providers who distributed New York signals nationally, as the distant stations would have an unfair advantage by broadcasting the same programming three hours earlier.

There is also a small &quot;reverse gray market&quot; for Canadian signals, transmitted with a footprint which sends full-strength DBS signals to many if not all of the contiguous 48 US states. This is desirable not only to receive Canadian-only content, but because some US-produced programs air in Canada in advance of their US broadcast. The question of signal substitution, by which Canadian cable and satellite providers substitute the signal of a local or domestic channel over a foreign or distant channel carrying the same program, is rendered more complex by the existence of a reverse grey market. Signal substitution had already been the cause of strong diplomatic protests by the United States, which considers the practice to constitute theft of advertising revenue.

The lack of domestic competition for premium movie channels in Canada is one factor encouraging grey-market reception; language is another key issue as most Spanish-language programming in North America is on the US system and most French-language programming is on the Canadian system. A larger selection of sports and ethnic programming is also available to grey-market subscribers.

It could be said that the 1000-channel universe is a &quot;reality&quot; in North America, but only for the signal pirates as many legal and geographic restrictions are placed on the ability to subscribe to many if not most of the physically available channels.

Other countries such as Nicaragua during Sandinista rule, Cuba, Iran (Islamic Republic of Iran) and Afghanistan during Taliban rule and Iraq during the Saddam Hussein regime, have attempted to prohibit their citizens from receiving any satellite broadcasts from foreign sources.

The situation in Europe differs somewhat, due to the much greater linguistic diversity in that region and due to the use of standardized DVB receivers capable of receiving multiple providers and free-to-air signals. North American providers normally lock their subscribers into &quot;package receivers&quot; unable to tune outside their one package; often the receivers are sold at artificially low prices and the subscription cost for programming is increased in order to favour new subscribers over existing ones. Providers are also notorious for using sales tactics such as bundling, in which to obtain one desired channel a subscriber must purchase a block of anywhere from several to more than a hundred other channels at substantial cost.

Many European companies such as British Sky Broadcasting prohibit subscriptions outside the UK and Ireland. But other satellite providers such as Sky Deutschland do sell yearly subscription cards legally to customers in other European countries without the need for an address or other personal information. The latter also applies to virtually all the Adult channel cards sold in Europe.

The Middle East emerged in the picture with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In July 2019, global football authorities of various competitions collectively condemned a pirate broadcasting channel of Saudi Arabia, BeoutQ. The right holders running Premier League, FIFA World Cup and UEFA Champions League called on the authorities of the Arab nation to halt the operations of its homegrown pirate TV and broadcasting service, which is involved in illegal streaming of matches internationally.

BeoutQ emerged in 2017, and since has been widely available across Saudi Arabia. However, the country denied that it is based in Riyadh, stating that the authorities are committed to fighting piracy. In February 2015, several sports bodies and broadcasters, including the U.S. National Basketball Association, U.S. Tennis Association and Sky demanded the United States to add Saudi Arabia its “Priority Watch List” over TV piracy. It was in April 2019, when Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) released a report placing Saudi Arabia on the Watch List.

==Counter-piracy techniques==
A number of strategies have been used by providers to control or prevent the widespread pirate decryption of their signals.

One approach has been to take legal action against dealers who sell equipment which may be of use to satellite pirates; in some cases the objective has been to obtain lists of clients in order to take or threaten to take costly legal action against end-users. Providers have created departments with names like the &quot;office of signal integrity&quot; or the &quot;end-users group&quot; to pursue alleged pirate viewers.

As some equipment (such as a computer interface to communicate with standard ISO/IEC 7816 smartcards) is useful for other purposes, this approach has drawn strong opposition from groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation. There have also been US counter-suits alleging that the legal tactics used by some DBS providers to demand large amounts of money from end-users may themselves appear unlawful or border on extortion.

Much of the equipment is perfectly lawful to own; in these cases, only the misuse of the equipment to pirate signals is prohibited. This makes provider attempts at legal harassment of would-be pirates awkward at best, a problem for providers which is growing due to the Internet distribution of third-party software to reprogram some otherwise legitimate free-to-air DVB receivers to decrypt pay TV broadcasts with no extra hardware.

US-based Internet sites containing information about the compromised encryption schemes have also been targeted by lawyers, often with the objective of costing the defendants enough in legal fees that they have to shut down or move their sites to offshore or foreign Internet hosts.

In some cases, the serial numbers of unsubscribed smartcards have been blacklisted by providers, causing receivers to display error messages. A &quot;hashing&quot; approach of writing arbitrary data to every available location on the card and requiring that this data be present as part of the decryption algorithm has also been tried as a way of leaving less available free space for third-party code supplied by pirates.

Another approach has been to load malicious code onto smartcards or receivers; these programs are intended to detect tampered cards and maliciously damage the cards or corrupt the contents of non-volatile memories within the receiver. This particular Trojan horse attack is often used as an ECM (electronic countermeasure) by providers, especially in North America where cards and receivers are sold by the providers themselves and are easy targets for insertion of backdoors in their computer firmware. The most famous ECM incident was the &quot;Black Sunday&quot; attack launched against tampered DirecTV &quot;H&quot; on January 21, 2001. It intended to destroy the cards by overwriting a non-erasable part of the cards internal memory in order to lock the processor into an endless loop.

The results of a provider resorting to the use of malicious code are usually temporary at best, as knowledge of how to repair most damage tends to be distributed rapidly by hobbyists through various Internet forums. There is also a potential legal question involved (which has yet to be addressed) as the equipment is normally the property not of the provider but of the end user. Providers will often print on the smartcard itself that the card is the property of the signal provider, but at least one legal precedent indicates that marking &quot;this is mine&quot; on a card, putting it in a box with a receiver and then selling it can legally mean &quot;this is not mine anymore&quot;. Malicious damage to receiver firmware puts providers on even shakier legal ground in the unlikely event that the matter were ever to be heard by the judiciary.

The only solution which has shown any degree of long-term success against tampered smartcards has been the use of digital renewable security; if the code has been broken and the contents of the smartcard&#x27;s programming widely posted across the Internet, replacing every smartcard in every subscriber&#x27;s receiver with one of different, uncompromised design will effectively put an end to a piracy problem. Providers tend to be slow to go this route due to cost (as many have millions of legitimate subscribers, each of which must be sent a new card) and due to concern that someone may eventually crack the code used in whatever new replacement card is used, causing the process to begin anew.

Premiere in Germany has replaced all of its smartcards with the Nagravision Aladin card; the US DirecTV system has replaced its three compromised card types (&quot;F&quot; had no encryption chip, &quot;H&quot; was vulnerable to being reprogrammed by pirates and &quot;HU&quot; were vulnerable to a &quot;glitch&quot; which could be used to make them skip an instruction). Both providers have been able to eliminate their problems with signal piracy by replacing the compromised smartcards after all other approaches had proved to provide at best limited results.

Dish Network and Bell Satellite TV had released new and more tamper-resistant smart cards over the years, known as the ROM2, ROM3, ROM10, ROM11 series. All these cards used the Nagravision 1 access system. Despite introducing newer and newer security measures, older cards were typically still able to decrypt the satellite signal after new cards were released (A lack of EEPROM space on the ROM2 cards eventually led to them being unable to receive updates necessary to view programming). In an effort to stop piracy, as by this point the Nagravision 1 system had been thoroughly reverse-engineered by resourceful hobbyists, an incompatible Nagravision 2 encryption system was introduced along with a smart card swap-out for existing customers. As more cards were swapped, channel groups were slowly converted to the new encryption system, starting with pay-per-view and HDTV channels, followed by the premium movie channels. This effort culminated in a complete shutdown of the Nagravision 1 datastream for all major channels in September 2005. Despite these efforts to secure their programming, a software hack was released in late August 2005, allowing for the decryption of the new Nagravision 2 channels with a DVB-S card and a PC. Just a few months later, early revisions of the Nagravision 2 cards had been themselves compromised. Broadcast programming currently uses a simulcrypt of Nagravision 2 and Nagravision 3, a first step toward a possible future shutdown of Nagravision 2 systems.

=== Litigation ===
Various groups have been targeted for lawsuits in connection with pirate decryption issues:
* In 2006, a decision in &quot;Snow v. DirecTV&quot; preserved the right of a private website owner to prohibit DirecTV from accessing an otherwise-public website run by plaintiff Michael Snow to serve anti-DirecTV activists.
* DirecTV (as the euphemistically-named &quot;End Users Group&quot;) had engaged in widespread litigation against its own subscribers on the pretext that users who owned both a smartcard programmer and a DirecTV subscription were presumed to be using the equipment to unlock extra channels on the system. A hundred thousand users were harassed with repeated and legally-questionable demands seeking thousands of dollars per user.
* In 2004&#x27;s &quot;DirecTV v. Treworgy&quot;, the Electronic Frontier Foundation helped establish that DirecTV cannot sue individuals for &quot;mere possession&quot; of smart-card technology, forcing the company to drop its &quot;guilt-by-purchase&quot; litigation strategy.
* &quot;NagraStar&quot; (a joint venture of Nagravision/Kudelski and DishNetwork/Echostar) has also targeted US end users with legal threats and demands for money.
* EchoStar, as parent of Dish Network, has sued manufacturers of FTA receivers, claiming that the manufacturers were aware of or complicit in the distribution of aftermarket software which unlocks channels transmitted with compromised encryption schemes. The company has also sued operators of websites which published information about the security issues.
* DirecTV has used the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the Federal Communications Act to target developers and distributors of software that allowed users to hack DirecTV&#x27;s older generation access cards. One 2006 settlement in US federal case &quot;DirecTV and NDS vs. Robert Lazarra&quot; ended in a one million dollar out-of-court settlement.
* In 2009, the US Ninth Circuit court ruled in &quot;DirecTV, Inc v. Hoa Huynh, Cody Oliver&quot; against DirecTV&#x27;s claim that inserting a smart card into preexisting television equipment constitutes &quot;assembling&quot; a pirate device. DirecTV cannot sue on this theory, dismissing DirecTV&#x27;s attempt to punish individuals twice for a single offense and upholding a lower court decision that 47 U.S.C., section 605(e)(4) does not apply to individuals owning interception devices solely for personal use. This decision protects legitimate security researchers.
* DirecTV sued its smartcard vendor NDS, accusing News Data Systems of “breach of contract, fraud, breach of warranty and misappropriation of trade secrets” for its role in designing the now compromised H- and HU- series cards.
* Canal+ and EchoStar have also sued NDS, alleging that the company reverse-engineered and leaked information about their providers&#x27; rival encryption schemes.
* Québécor-owned cable television operator Videotron sued Bell Satellite TV on the grounds that free signals from compromised satellite TV encryption unfairly cost the cable company paid subscribers. After multiple appeals and rulings against Bell, Québécor and TVA Group were ultimately awarded $141 million in 2015.

One of the most severe sentences handed out for satellite TV piracy in the United States was to a Canadian businessman, Martin Clement Mullen, widely known for over a decade in the satellite industry as &quot;Marty&quot; Mullen.

Mullen was sentenced to seven years in prison with no parole and ordered to pay DirecTV and smart card provider NDS Ltd. US$24 million in restitution. He pleaded guilty in a Tampa, Florida court in September 2003 after being arrested when he entered the United States using a British passport in the name &quot;Martin Paul Stewart&quot;.

Mr. Mullen had operated his satellite piracy business from Florida, the Cayman Islands and from his home in London, Ontario, Canada. Testimony in the Florida court showed that he had a network of over 100 sub-dealers working for him and that during one six-week period, he cleared US$4.4 million in cash from re-programming DirecTV smartcards that had been damaged in an electronic counter measure.

NDS Inc. Chief of Security John Norris pursued Mullen for a decade in three different countries. When Mullen originally fled the United States to Canada in the mid-1990s, Norris launched an investigation that saw an undercover operator (a former Canadian police officer named Don Best) become one of Mullen&#x27;s sub-dealers and his closest personal friend for over a year. In summer of 2003 when Mullen travelled under another identity to visit his operations in Florida, US federal authorities were waiting for him at the airport after being tipped off by Canadian investigators working for NDS Inc.

However, the NDS Group were accused (in several lawsuits) by Canal+ (dismissed as part of an otherwise-unrelated corporate takeover deal) and Echostar (now Dish Network) of hacking the Nagra encryption and releasing the information on the internet. The jury awarded EchoStar $45.69 actual damages (one month&#x27;s average subscription fee) in Claim 3.

Bell Satellite TV (as Bell ExpressVu) was sued by Vidéotron, a Québécor-owned rival which operates cable television systems in major Québec markets. Québécor also owns TVA, a broadcaster. Bell&#x27;s inferior security and failure to replace compromised smartcards in a timely fashion cost Vidéotron cable subscribers, as viewers could obtain the same content for free from satellite under the compromised Nagra1 system from 1999 to 2005; pirate decryption also deprived TVA&#x27;s French language news channel LCN of a monthly 48¢/subscriber fee. The Superior Court of Quebec awarded $339,000 and $262,000 in damages/interest to Vidéotron and TVA Group in 2012. Québec&#x27;s Appeal Court ruled these dollar amounts &quot;erroneus&quot; and increased them in 2015; despite an attempt to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, a final award of $141 million in damages and interest was upheld.

<text>Native Forests Action Council was an environmental organisation in New Zealand.

It was formed in 1975 from what was the Beech Forest Action Committee to advocate for the protection of native forests. In the mid-1980s, the group advocated for the core of North-west Nelson Forest Park to be protected as a national park due to extensive mining proposals threatening the area. This ultimately led to Kahurangi National Park to be formed in 1996.

For some time, Guy Salmon was the group&#x27;s director. The group changed its name to the Maruia Society in 1988. The Maruia Society then became the Ecologic Foundation, with Salmon as its director.

<doc id="1038031" wikidata="Q7842491" url="?curid=1038031" title="Félix Trinidad vs. Ricardo Mayorga">
<text>[[Félix Trinidad]] vs. [[Ricardo Mayorga]], billed as &quot;Back with a Vengeance&quot;, was a professional boxing match contested on October 2, 2004. It pitting together former world champions Felix Tito Trinidad and Ricardo Mayorga, under the promotion of Don King, at the Madison Square Garden in New York City, United States.

==Background==

The fight involved no world titles, but that did not prevent it from being a large boxing event: With Bernard Hopkins&#x27;s knockout of Oscar De La Hoya and Roy Jones Jr.&#x27;s knockout defeat weeks before, there were no more immediate big fights in the future, and both boxers had impressive knockout records.

The behind the scenes storylines involving this fight helped build up fan interest too: Mayorga, nicknamed &quot;El Matador&quot; (&quot;The Killer&quot;), had been active for the two previous years, settling for a no contest and a knockout win (in a rematch) against Andrew Lewis, then defeating Vernon Forrest twice before losing to Cory Spinks, all in world title fights. He had also won one fight at the Middleweight division. 

During the weigh-in the day before the fight, Mayorga, feeling taunted by Trinidad&#x27;s fans, responded by grabbing his genitals towards those fans. For the Trinidad fight, Mayorga dyed his hair red. Asked why he did that, he answered that he dyed his hair just because he felt like it.

Trinidad, for his part, had not been active for two years. He lost his motivation, according to him, after Hopkins refused to give him a rematch of their September 28, 2001 bout, in which Hopkins unified the WBA, WBC, and IBF titles by knocking Trinidad out in twelve rounds. After a win against Hacine Cherifi in four rounds in 2002, Trinidad retired. Trinidad reportedly reached a weight of 200 pounds (91 kg) during his retirement.

Because of those circumstances, many experts predicted that this fight would be like the fight between Joe Louis and Rocky Marciano or the one between Larry Holmes and Muhammad Ali: A former great who had been out of the ring for a considerable amount of time taking on an opponent who was, on the other hand, very good, but not to be considered as good as the retired champion ever was, therefore, many predicted Trinidad&#x27;s doom at the hands of a man like Mayorga, who had won a world title and proven himself against some of the best boxers available while Trinidad was away from boxing.

The fight was telecast on HBO&#x27;s Pay Per View, and commented by Jim Lampley, Larry Merchant and Roy Jones Jr. The fact it was held in New York guaranteed that many fans from both countries, especially Puerto Ricans, would come to cheer for their boxer.

==The fight==
Mayorga started the fight by almost falling Trinidad with a jab. A famous part of this round sees Mayorga drop his hands sticking his chin in the air daring the vicious puncher Trinidad to try his best. Trinidad threw three left hooks and Mayorga simply did a mocking dance to taunt Trinidad. In round two, Trinidad and Mayorga traded power punches evenly, with most experts agreeing that Trinidad landed with a little more power.

Mayorga struck in round three with a right to the chin, that caused Trinidad to reel back and touch his glove to the mat. Although this was ruled a knockdown, Trinidad recuperated quickly, and went back into trading with Mayorga. By the end of the round, Mayorga was wobbled again. It has been alleged that, at some point after falling, Trinidad told Mayorga something in Spanish that sounded like &quot;I&#x27;ve tasted your power now. Let&#x27;s see if you can take mine(power)!&quot;.

By round four, Mayorga began to spurt a cut. Trinidad started to move to take advantage of the cut. Nevertheless, the round featured many furious exchanges between the two rivals.

Round five was similar to round four. Both fighters stood in the center of the ring, trading power punches until the bell. This style set the pattern for the rest of the fight, but Mayorga was noticeably tiring after six rounds, and he had sustained two more injuries.

The end of the fight came in round eight. Trinidad, seizing an opportunity for a knockout, dropped Mayorga three times, forcing the referee to stop the bout, giving Trinidad the TKO win.

==Aftermath==
There was the possibility of a rematch between Trinidad and de la Hoya, who was defeated by Trinidad in 1999 via a controversial decision. A fight against Hopkins, based on the outcome of Hopkins-de la Hoya, was also very considered, just like a fight with Roy Jones Jr. Soon after the fight with Mayorga, though, Trinidad only fought Winky Wright in May 2005, losing in 12 rounds for only the second loss of his career. Eventually, Trinidad would fight Jones Jr. in January 2008, losing by unanimous 12-round decision.

As for Mayorga, he required hospitalization due to the injuries he sustained. Immediately after being released from the hospital (three days after the fight), he flew back to Nicaragua, where he would immediately begin a law process to determine whether he was guilty or not of rape. On October 5, he announced his retirement from boxing, although he later returned onto the ring to fight Michele Piccirillo and then Oscar De La Hoya.

The fight between Trinidad and Mayorga went on to be considered by some respected critics as a candidate for 2004&#x27;s &quot;fight of the year&quot; immediately after it was over.

Promoter Don King went on a tirade against HBO days after the fight, complaining that HBO had dedicated 6 months to promote the Hopkins-de la Hoya fight and only six days to promote the Trinidad-Mayorga showdown. HBO executives replied by saying that King was apparently too caught up with the political debates of 2004, and that HBO and King have enjoyed a mutual working relationship for many years.

==Undercard==
Confirmed bouts:
*The title was on the line for Mendoza only after Álvarez failed to make weight.

<text>Marcellin Joseph Benedict Champagnat, FMS (20 May 17896 June 1840) was a French Catholic religious born in Le Rosey, village of Marlhes, near St. Etienne (Loire), France. He was the founder of the Marist Brothers, a religious congregation of brothers in the Catholic Church devoted to Mary and dedicated to education. His feast day is 6 June, his death anniversary.

Champagnat was ordained as a priest on 22 July 1816 and was part of a group led by Jean-Claude Colin, who founded the Society of Mary, a separate religious congregation to the Marist Brothers teaching order Champagnat founded later. Champagnat was born in the year of the storming of the Bastille, the start of the French Revolution. The religious, political, economic, and social unrest of the times he lived influenced his priorities and life path.

==Seminary and ordination==
With money he earned from raising sheep, he went to the Minor Seminary at Verrières-en-Forez. He entered in October 1805. Older than many of his classmates, at the age of 17, he failed his first year and was sent home. He was readmitted, through the efforts of his mother, his parish priest, and the superior of the seminary.

Champagnat, who by this time had developed from being timid and shy into a gregarious young man, was known to frequent the local pubs. As a consequence, he was eventually regarded as a member of a group known as the “Happy Gang,” made up of seminarians who were a familiar sight in the taverns of the town during their free time.

At the beginning of his second year, Champagnat settled down to a more sober lifestyle. He continued to apply himself to his studies throughout his second year at the seminary. Two events, occurring during the summer following the second year, also helped to moderate his exuberant behaviour. The first was the sudden death on 2 September 1807 of his friend, Denis Duplay. The second was a serious conversation with Father Linossier, who supervised the seminary, about improving Champagnat&#x27;s general conduct. Champagnat left Verrières for St. Irenaeus, the major seminary near Lyons.

He then attended the major seminary at Saint Irenaeus in Lyon for his spiritual and theological formation as a priest. Among his companions were Jean-Marie Vianney and Jean-Claude Colin. He was no natural scholar but through hard work and the support of his mother and aunt he was finally ordained.

It was here that the idea for the Society of Mary was conceived and promoted by a group of seminarians, including Champagnat. He was ordained on 22 July 1816, at the age of twenty-seven, and the next day, travelled to the shrine of Our Lady of Fourviéres above Lyons with others interested in establishing a Society of Mary. The group of young men together dedicated themselves to Mary as &quot;The Society of Mary&quot;. From the start, he announced the Society should include teaching Brothers to work with children deprived of Christian education in remote rural areas because others were not going to them.

==Founding the Marist Brothers==
After his ordination, Champagnat was appointed pastor in La Valla, on the slopes of Mont Pilat. Champagnat was struck by the isolation in which people lived and the lack of education in the rural area. At the end of October 1816, after attending Jean-Baptist Montagne, a dying sixteen-year-old completely ignorant of basic Catholic teaching, Champagnat acted upon his conviction of the need for religious Brothers.

After witnessing the poor treatment of a student by a teacher on his first day at school, Champagnat&#x27;s thoughts on education had been shaken. He was motivated to establish a society that would care for indigent children and display &quot;great zeal for the poor&quot;. When he later instructed the Marists on how to educate their students, he ordered them, &quot;Keep loving them as long as they are with you, since this is the only way to work with any success at reforming them. Love them all equally—no outcasts, no favourites&quot;. He stated on another occasion, &quot;I cannot see a child without wanting to tell him how much God loves him&quot;.

On 2 January 1817, Champagnat encouraged two young men Jean-Marie Granjon and Jean-Baptiste Audras, to join him in forming the nucleus of the Marist Brothers. Others soon followed. La Valla thus became the birthplace of the Marist Brothers. In 1817 he started a small establishment for training teachers at La Valla, which became a centre for his young Brothers. In 1824, when the new French king, Charles X, transferred the oversight of elementary education to the Catholic Church, Champagnat won support to build a new and larger novitiate, which became the Notre Dame Hermitage, and the brothers began to spread more widely. 

In the early years of the new society, Champagnat personally supervised the training of the Brothers, visiting all of their schools and taking part in their teaching. By 1833, the novices of the Brothers were primarily men in their late teens and early twenties. They were required to be literate and numerate and received instruction in doctrine and the religious life as they trained to become teachers, living by a regular timetable of prayer, study, and manual work. Soon, the Brothers extended their services from the small country parishes in which they had begun their work to the larger towns.

In 1818 Champagnat opened the first Marist school whose timetable he designed in such a way to fit the farming needs of his parishioners (such as allowing children off school to help in the fields at planting and harvesting time). He set fees for the school at a level he knew most rural families could meet. In fact, if he knew the family was unable to afford anything, the tuition was free. Champagnat had a great devotion to the guardian angels, and directed that an image of a guardian angel be placed in every classroom.

Encouraged by the success of the school in La Valla, others were founded at Marlhes in 1819, in Saint-Sauveur-Street 1820, and in Bourg-Argental in 1822. But this success endangered the small congregation, which had little more than novices. In March 1822, eight applicants came from Haute-Loire, giving a new impetus to the institution, and allows the creation of new houses in Vanosc 1823, Saint-Symphorien-le-Chateau 1823, and Chavanay Charlieu 1824.

In 1837, Champagnat printed a Rule for his Brothers. In view of Champagnat&#x27;s declining health, however, in 1839 Jean-Claude Colin advised him to have the Brothers elect a successor. This took place with the election of Brother François Rivat as Director-General and Champagnat&#x27;s successor on 12 October 1839.

==Final years==

After a long-term illness, Champagnat died of cancer on 6 June 1840, aged 51, at Our Lady of the Hermitage in the Gier River valley about 30 kilometres from where he had commenced his work. He was buried on 8 June. He left this message in his Spiritual Testament of 18 May 1840: &quot;Let there be among you just one heart and one mind. Let it always be said of the Little Brothers of Mary as it was of the early Christians: See how they love one another!&quot; By that time there were 278 Brothers and 48 Marist schools in France, and the order was spreading to the South Pacific.

The nascent order called themselves Les Petits Frères de Marie or Little Brothers of Mary. The Marist Brothers Institute was formally approved in 1863 by Pope Pius IX, and were given the name . Members of the order are identified by the initials &quot;FMS&quot;.

==Veneration==
Champagnat&#x27;s cause was formally opened on 9 August 1896, granting him the title of Servant of God. Champagnat was declared Venerable on 11 July 1920 by Pope Benedict XV, beatified by Pope Pius XII on 29 May 1955, and canonised by Pope John Paul II on 18 April 1999.
His feast day is observed in the Catholic Church on 6 June.

==Legacy==
At his death, there were 280 Marist Brothers in the south of France. The number grew to 1500 Brothers in 1856. In 2000, there are about 5000 Marist Brothers and tens of thousands of lay people who undertake the work of spreading Marist education in 74 countries around the world.

Champagnat never wrote an extended exposition of his educational philosophy, but he believed that to teach children one must love them; secular subjects should be well taught as a means of attracting children to the schools, and they would learn the basic elements of their faith as well. Influenced by the French school of spirituality, Champagnat saw God at the centre of life and the Virgin Mary as a sure means of attracting people to God.

The endemic Italian columbine &quot;Aquilegia champagnatii&quot; is named in his honour.

<doc id="1038036" wikidata="Q1630805" url="?curid=1038036" title="Hotel (Hailey novel)">
<text>Hotel is a 1965 novel by Arthur Hailey. It is the story of an independent New Orleans hotel, the St. Gregory, and its management&#x27;s struggle to regain profitability and avoid being assimilated into the O&#x27;Keefe chain of hotels. The St. Gregory is supposedly based on the Roosevelt Hotel, although the old St. Charles Hotel is also cited as the basis for the novel.

==Plot==
Peter McDermott: The main character is Mr. Peter McDermott; the general manager with a past. He is a graduate in Hotel Management from Cornell University and subsequently got a job in a hotel. However, he had been involved with a lady at a time when he was supposed to be on duty. This gave Peter&#x27;s wife and the lady&#x27;s husband a reason to ask for a divorce. McDermott&#x27;s dalliance was not a big thing for the hotel, but the newspaper coverage was such that he was dismissed from his job and blacklisted. But Warren Trent, the head of the St. Gregory Hotel, ignoring the past and considering his skill, hired him. The novel is about McDermott&#x27;s attempts to deal with several crises in the hotel which involve a range of other characters.

The Hotel Finance Problem: The hotel&#x27;s unpayable and unrenewable mortgage is due on Friday, necessitating its sale. Curtis O&#x27;Keefe, who owns a large hotel chain, plans to buy the St. Gregory hotel, as the O&#x27;Keefe chain did not have a hotel in New Orleans. They had offered to pay the two million due on the mortgage and one million dollar and living accommodation to Warren Trent as well. However Warren did not want to lose the hotel which he had nurtured for so long. They decided upon a deadline of Friday afternoon to make a decision on the deal.
Warren Trent meanwhile decided to make a deal with the Journeyman&#x27;s Union who had long wanted to enter the hotel Industry but were not successful. This way Warren Trent could maintain the hotel&#x27;s independence and still have a say in its affairs. The Journeyman&#x27;s Union had decided to send two of its executives on Thursday to study the hotel books and then decide before the Friday afternoon deadline. Royall Edwards of the St. Gregory had been appointed by Warren Trent to work with the two officers all night, if required, so that they could complete the study. However, upset with the denial of entry of a Negro man to the hotel, which made headlines, the Journeyman&#x27;s Union broke the deal. Warren Trent had no option but to give in to Curtis O&#x27;Keefe. To his utmost surprise, a few minutes before Friday noon, the bank manager who had turned down refinancing of the hotel, came with an offer, that an individual, whose name could not be disclosed then, would be paying the mortgage and buying the major shares of the hotel. Warren Trent would be the chairman, though Warren knew that he would be just a figurehead, but as it was a better offer, so he accepted.

Christine and Albert Wells: Christine is Warren Trent&#x27;s secretary. Peter and Christine have a liking for each other. They share many things in common and feel they could be happy together. In the hotel, an elderly guest, Mr. Albert Wells, suffers a medical problem in his room. The hotel staff is alert and quickly moves him to another room. Christine took care of Albert Wells personally as he was the hotel guest.

Marsha Preyscott: In another incident a group of teen-aged boys create a major incident that is aggravated by the fact that they are the sons of the local banker, car dealer, and other town notables. They attempt to rape Miss Preyscott, the daughter of Mr. Preyscott, a department store magnate, who is currently in Rome. However, on hearing her screams, Aloysius Royce (a Negro and main help to Warren Trent, who treats him like a son) steps in and Marsha is able to escape. Peter handles the situation and asks for a written apology from each of the boys involved in it. In these letters, the villainous Bell Captain Herbie Chandler is named as the one who made the incident possible. Because of his collusion in this, Chandler is threatened with firing on the spot; however, McDermott plans to take it to Mr. Trent, because of Chandler&#x27;s years of employment. Chandler attempts to bribe the general manager, but fails, and is told to leave the office. In a cold rage, Chandler plots some kind of revenge against McDermott, and he steps onto elevator number 4.
Marsha falls in ‘love’ with Peter McDermott and proposes marriage. Peter finds it difficult to say no to her considering her affluence and beauty, but finally says no as he knows that he likes Christine. However he overcomes his sense of guilt when he learns from Anna (Marsha&#x27;s head maidservant) that she is always the same and will be OK in a short time - and that Anna was never married. However, Marsha, in framing a good background to convince Peter, had said that Anna had a very good life with her husband whom she had met only once before marriage, and it was not necessary to know a person for too long before to decide on marriage.

The Dentist Convention: The hotel business gains a minimum from room rent, the bulk of its profit coming from the food and the conventions held. A major convention of dentists was supposed to be held in the St. Gregory. Dr. Ingram, the president of the convention, has arrived and settled in his room. Then a Dr. Nicholas, a prominent Negro dentist and university lecturer, arrives at the counter, showing a confirmed reservation. However hotel policy does not allow Negroes. Dr. Ingram was quite disappointed at this and threatened to take the convention out of the hotel, causing a major loss. When Peter discussed it with Warren, he said that after a few discussions this would be forgotten, the convention would be held, and there was no need to worry. And after a few meetings the convention finally decided to stay, though Dr. Ingram resigned from his post.

Curtis O&#x27;Keefe and Dodo: Curtis O&#x27;Keefe, who owns a large hotel chain, plans to buy the St. Gregory. He is there with Dodo, his girlfriend. But Curtis wants to move on. He gets a movie role for Dodo and intends to go to New York to meet his new girlfriend. When Warren tells Curtis that he is not going to accept Curtis&#x27; offer to sell the hotel, Curtis is very disappointed and in a fit of anger he tells Dodo that he doesn&#x27;t want her any more. Dodo is upset, although somehow she already knows. She has to board her flight to Los Angeles and takes elevator number 4, as she is about to move out of the hotel.

Duke and Duchess of Croydon: In another instance, the Duke and Duchess of Croydon are hiding out in the hotel, as they are responsible for a gruesome hit-and-run accident which made the headlines. The Duke had gone to a night club, where the Duchess found her husband. On their way back the Duke hit a woman and her daughter, both of whom died. However, in the accident the headlight and the trim ring of the car were damaged. The Duke and Duchess arrived back at the hotel to try to find a way out, so that there would not be the slightest suggestion of them being involved in an accident. When the room-service waiter arrives in the presidential suite with dinner, the Duchess intentionally hits him so that her dress gets spoiled. The Duchess creates a big issue over this just to make her presence felt, so that it can be interpreted that she was in the hotel. But the chief house officer Ogilvie gets a hint of it and tries to blackmail the Duke and Duchess. They finally reach an agreement that Ogilvie would drive their Jaguar to Chicago and a total of twenty-five thousand dollars would be paid to him. By the time the police could identify the car with the broken headlight and trim pieces, Ogilvie would be out of New Orleans. His departure was scheduled to be at 1 am Thursday. Ogilvie gets a written note from the Duchess asking for permission to drive her car out of the garage in case the garage officer asks for it. The moment he is driving the car out of hotel, Peter enters the hotel and they make eye contact, though Peter does not think much of it at the time. However, recollecting all the events – a Jaguar belonging to the Duke and Duchess being driven by Ogilvie – the broken headlight of the Jaguar – the fuss created by the Duchess about the waiter – all establish a link towards the involvement of the Duke and Duchess. Peter inquires from the garage officer and is informed that Ogilvie had a written note from the Duchess and so was allowed to drive the car away, but somehow the note got misplaced. Peter informed police captain Yolles of the incident, but they could not prove it without any evidence. After working hard, the attendant responsible for garbage recycling manages to find the note. When the note is shown to the Duchess, she frowns. The Duke then decides to admit his crime, decides to leave, and steps into elevator number 4.

Keycase Milne: A hotel thief operating in the St. Gregory. He has managed to get keys of several rooms in the hotel by using tricks, asking for other room number keys from the reception desk, using girls to obtain keys for him, among many other ways. When he saw the Duke and Duchess in the hotel he thinks it would be excellent if he could get the key of their room. He manages to get the key from reception by trickery, gets a duplicate prepared, and steals fifteen thousand dollars and some jewelry from the Duchess&#x27;s room. After obtaining so much he decides to leave the hotel and boards elevator number 4.

Climax: The meeting to take over the hotel scheduled at 11:30 am Friday is in place. Mr. Dempster from New York arrives to reveal who his boss is, and it is Albert Wells, the hotel guest whom Christine had taken care of, not thinking of him as a rich man, who has bought the hotel. To Peter&#x27;s complete surprise, he is appointed the Executive Vice-President of the St. Gregory and would be running the hotel with Dempster as officiating president, the position Dempster had in all other hotels owned by Albert Wells. During the meeting Christine comes running and tells them that elevator number 4 has met with an accident and had a free fall, killing a worker.

Actually, several passengers were killed, including an elderly couple. Dodo, suffering from serious injuries, is rushed to a hospital. It is then that Curtis realizes how much he loves Dodo and gets the best neurosurgeons for her. She is soon out of danger. The Duke, on the other hand, was killed instantly. The Duchess, in shock upon hearing that, is expressionless. The policeman, Captain Yolles, now thinks the blame for the hit-and-run could be easily moved onto the Duke, as he is now dead, and the Duchess could save herself. Herbie Chandler, the bell captain, is permanently paralyzed and will never work again. Keycase escapes unharmed and runs away with all his money, vowing to go straight. Warren Trent is happy that he could retain his hotel as its chairman. Aloysius Royce leaves the hotel to study law, but not before he and McDermott have a drink together.

== Background ==
Hailey worked on the novel for two and a half years, finishing in June 1964. He says his wife Sheila was of great assistance with the research. The book clubs, essential for sales of Hailey&#x27;s book, originally rejected the novel. However, when the book was read in galleys three studios bid on the movie rights and it was sold to Warner Bros who wanted Hailey to write the screenplay. The book became a best seller, Hailey&#x27;s most successful to date.

== Structure of novel ==
The novel features multiple unfolding plot lines which take place over a period of five weekdays, Monday through Friday. Some days feature self-contained episodes exploring particular elements of the routine of a large hotel in detail. Meg Yetmein, the cleaning lady, &quot;gets hers back&quot; by smuggling out steaks under her clothing toward the end of her shift; Tom Earlshore, the fired bartender, does much the same by &quot;skimming&quot; liquor. Other brief episodes explain techniques used by prostitutes in entering and exiting the hotel undetected, and the various methods used by the hotel thief.

== Adaptations ==
The novel was adapted into a movie in 1967, and in 1983 Aaron Spelling turned it into a television series, airing for five years on ABC. In the TV series the St. Gregory Hotel was moved from New Orleans to San Francisco.

<text>The Ecologic Foundation is an environmental organisation in New Zealand.

The Society had its origins in the Beech Forest Action Committee and the Native Forest Action Council (NFAC). In 1989 the NFAC changed its name to the &quot;Maruia Society&quot;: &quot;Maruia&quot; means &quot;sheltered valley&quot; in the Māori language, and there is also a valley of that name in New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. In 1999, the society adopted an altered mission and took the name Ecologic Foundation.

Throughout most of its history, the executive director was Guy Salmon who has been present through all the group&#x27;s incarnations.

The Maruia Society lost a lot of members during the mid-late 1990s when it came out in support of sustainable milling of beech on the West Coast—in contrast to the mainstream environmental movement in New Zealand, which was advocating against active management of the forests with money being channelled back into the forests for pest control.

<text>Michael Heizer (born 1944) is an American land artist specializing in large-scale and site-specific sculptures. Working largely outside the confines of the traditional art spaces of galleries and museums, Heizer has redefined sculpture in terms of size, mass, gesture, and process. A pioneer of 20th-century land art or Earthworks movement, he is widely recognized for sculptures and environmental structures made with earth-moving equipment, which he began creating in the American West in 1967. He currently lives and works in Hiko, Nevada, and New York City.

==Work==
Heizer began his artistic career in New York in 1966 with a series of geometric canvases painted with PVA latex. The paintings that would follow, characterized by non-traditionally shaped canvases, demonstrate Heizer&#x27;s early exploration of positive and negative forms; such harmonies of presence and absence, matter and space, are essential to his art. In &quot;Trapezoid Painting&quot; (1966) and &quot;Track Painting&quot; (1967), he emphasizes the perimeters of raw canvases by painting them black, while the white interiors are perceived as negative spaces. These hard-edged &quot;displacement paintings&quot; parallel the immense geometries he achieves when moving earth. The slate grey contours of &quot;U Painting&quot; (1975), for example, anticipate the shapes of the depressions and angular mounds that appear in one of his latest projects &quot;City&quot;.

In the late 1960s, Heizer left New York City for the deserts of California and Nevada, where he began making his first &quot;negative&quot; sculptures. These works were created by removing earth to shape subterranean negative forms directly into desert floor. Completed in 1967, &quot;North, East, South, West&quot;, consisted of several geometrically shaped holes dug in the Sierra Nevada. The following year Heizer completed &quot;Nine Nevada Depressions&quot;, a series of large negative sculptures located primarily on dry lakes throughout the state, Jean Dry Lake, Black Rock Desert and Massacre Dry Lake, near Vya, Nevada among them. In 1969, Heizer made the series &quot;Primitive Dye Paintings&quot;, in which white lime powder and concentrated aniline dyes were spread over the dry desert landscape, covering large areas that, when viewed from the air, formed amorphous, organic shapes. The culmination of this critical early period was the creation of &quot;Double Negative&quot; in 1969, a project for which he displaced 240,000 tons of rock in the Nevada desert, cutting two enormous trenches—each one 50-feet-deep and 30-feet-wide and together spanning 1,500 feet—at the eastern edge of Mormon Mesa near Overton, Nevada.

Heizer has since continued his exploration of the dynamics between positive forms and negative space. His &quot;Adjacent, Against, Upon&quot; (1976) juxtaposes three large granite slabs in different relationships to cast concrete forms; the 30–50 ton granite slabs were quarried in the Cascade Mountain Range and transported by barge and train to Myrtle Edwards Park. For &quot;Displaced/Replaced Mass&quot; (1969/1977), later installed outside the Marina del Rey, California, home of Roy and Carol Doumani, he planted four granite boulders of different sizes from the High Sierra into lid-less concrete boxes in the earth so that the tops of the rocks are roughly level with the ground. For a 1982 work at the former IBM Building in New York, Heizer sheared off the top of a large rock and cut grooves into the surface before setting it on supports hidden within a stainless steel structure. Designed as a fountain, the boulder appears to float over running water. He called it &quot;Levitated Mass&quot;, a title he would use again in the future. Commissioned by the president of the Ottawa Silica Company, the &quot;Effigy Tumuli&quot; earthwork in Illinois is composed of five abstract animal earthworks reclaiming the site of an abandoned surface coal mine along the Illinois River; the shapes (1983–85)—a frog, a water strider, a catfish, a turtle, and a snake—reflect the environment of the site, which overlooks the river. In 1983, Heizer received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Fine Arts. 

In 2012, Heizer completed &quot;Levitated Mass&quot; (2012). On permanent installation at Los Angeles County Museum of Art, &quot;Levitated Mass&quot; is a massive white, diorite boulder (21.5 feet wide and 21.5 feet high) that sits atop a 456-foot-long sloped walkway, allowing viewers to experience the weight of the rock as they walk through the empty space below. It took eleven nights, from February 28 to March 10, 2012, to move the 340-ton rock from Jurupa Valley to the museum. The installation is situated in a field of polished concrete slices, set at a slight angle between the Resnick Pavilion and Sixth Street. Heizer opened the exhibit on June 24, 2012. A feature documentary, also named &quot;Levitated Mass&quot;, was directed and edited by the filmmaker Doug Pray. It details the making of the sculpture as it relates to Heizer&#x27;s career while portraying the boulder&#x27;s 105-mile journey through Los Angeles and the public&#x27;s reaction to its installation. Other recent public artworks by Michael Heizer include &quot;Tangential Circular Negative Line&quot; in Mauvoisin, Switzerland, commissioned by Fondation Air&amp;Art directed by Jean Maurice Varone, as well as &quot;Collapse&quot; (1967/2016) and &quot;Compression Line&quot; (1968/2016) at Glenstone, Potomac, Maryland.

In the early 1970s, Heizer began work on &quot;City&quot;, an enormous complex in the rural desert of Lincoln County, Nevada. His work on the project continues to this day, supported by the Dia Art Foundation through a grant from the Lannan Foundation. Limited public access to &quot;City&quot; began in 2022.

A campaign to have the Basin and Range area around &quot;City&quot; designated as a national monument to protect it from development took place, and a group of American museums, including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), the Museum of Modern Art, the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston and the Walker Art Center, have joined to draw public attention to a petition urging preservation of the area. In July 2015, President Barack Obama signed a proclamation (using his authority under the Antiquities Act of 1906) creating the Basin and Range National Monument on 704,000 acres in Lincoln and Nye counties, an area including Heizer&#x27;s &quot;City&quot;.

Heizer&#x27;s artworks are represented in museum collections and public spaces worldwide.

==Exhibitions==
In 1968, Heizer was included in &quot;Earth Works&quot;, the influential group show at Virginia Dwan&#x27;s gallery, and then in the Whitney Museum painting annual in 1969, where his contribution was a huge photograph of a dye painting in the desert. For his first one-person show, at the Galerie Heiner Friedrich, Munich in 1969, he removed 1,000 tons of earth in a conical shape to create &quot;Munich Depression&quot;. In 1977, he was included in &quot;documenta 6&quot;, Kassel. Major exhibitions of his work have been staged at institutions such as the Museum Folkwang, Essen (1979), the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (1984), and Fondazione Prada, Milan (1996). Recent gallery exhibitions have been held at Gagosian Gallery.

<text>Semir Zeki FMedSci FRS (born 8 November 1940) is a British and French neurobiologist who has specialised in studying the primate visual brain and more recently the neural correlates of affective states, such as the experience of love, desire and beauty that are generated by sensory inputs within the field of neuroesthetics. He was educated at University College London (UCL) where he was Henry Head Research Fellow of the Royal Society before being appointed Professor of Neurobiology. Since 2008 he has been Professor of Neuroesthetics at UCL.

==Early work==
Zeki&#x27;s early work was mainly anatomical in nature and consisted in charting visual areas in the primate (monkey) brain by studying their connections, leading him to define several visual areas lying anterior to the primary visual cortex (area V1) of the brain. This was followed by recording from single cells in these areas, which led him to the view (a) that there is a functional specialisation in the visual cortex, with different visual areas undertaking different visual tasks, such as the processing of colour, motion and form and (b) that the visual brain processes these different attributes in parallel.

==Time at University College London==
He later showed, using brain imaging techniques, that the same principles apply to the organisation of the human visual brain. In recent work he has shown that parallel processing appears to extend beyond the mere processing of visual signals to their grouping in parietal cortex. His work on colour vision was influenced by the work and methods of Edwin H. Land, whose techniques he employed in his physiological and brain imaging experiments, and which led him to the view that colour is constructed by the brain and that a specialised visual area, area V4, is critical to this process.

These findings raised the question of how the signals processed in these separate visual areas are integrated to give a unified picture of the visual world. In psychophysical experiments undertaken with colleagues, he showed that we perceive, and become aware of, different visual attributes at different times, with colour preceding motion by about 80 ms and form (orientation) by about 40 ms, leading to the view that there is a temporal asynchrony in vision which is the result of different processing speeds for different attributes. This in turn led him to suggest that visual consciousness is not unified; rather there are many visual micro-consciousness which are distributed in time and space, and that activity in each visual area can acquire a conscious correlate without the necessity of reporting to another cortical area, though acknowledging that there must be other enabling systems, possibly located in the reticular formation. Thus, functional specialisation manifests itself in the temporal sequence with which we see different attributes such as colour

More recently he has also studied the brain reaction to affective states generated by sensory inputs, such as the experience of love and hate. His studies of the experience of visual and musical beauty has led him to suggest that a specific part of the emotional brain, field A1 of the medial orbito-frontal cortex, is critical for such experiences.

==Public engagement==

He has lectured widely across the world, giving over 60 named lectures, including the Ferrier Lecture (Royal Society 1995); The Philip Bard Lecture (Johns Hopkins University, 1992); The Woodhull Lecture (Royal Institution, London, 1995); The Humphry Davy Lecture (Académie des Sciences, Paris, 1996); The Grass Foundation Forbes Lectures (Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, USA 1997; Carl Gustave Bernhard Lecture (Royal Swedish Academy of Science, Stockholm, 1996; and the Tizard Lecture (Westminster School, London, 2004) among others.

He has published three books, &quot;A Vision of the Brain&quot; (Blackwell, Oxford 1993 – translated into Japanese and Spanish), &quot;Inner Vision: an exploration of art and the brain&quot; (OUP, 1999); &quot;Splendors and Miseries of the Brain&quot; (Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford 2009) and co-authored &quot;La Quête de l&#x27;essentiel&quot;, Les Belles Lettres, Archimbaud, Paris, 1995 (with Balthus, Count Klossowski de Rola) and &quot;La bella e la bestia&quot;, 2011, Laterza, Italy (with Ludovica Lumer).

He held an exhibition of his own art work at the Pecci Museum of Contemporary Art in Milan in 2011 (&quot;Bianco su bianco: oltre Malevich&quot;).

==Posts, honours and awards==
He was Editor of the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society (B)&quot; from 1997 to 2004.

He has been a Trustee of Fight for Sight, a Guarantor of the neurological journal Brain, a member and then Chairman of the Wellcome Trust Vision Panel and a member of the National Science Council of France (1998–2002).

He has been a Visiting Fellow or Professor at St Andrews University; Ludwig-Maxilmilians University, Munich; Duke University, USA, University of California (Berkeley), among other institutions. He has conducted a number of public dialogues with writers, artists and art historians, including Dame Antonia Byatt, Balthus, Hans Belting, Peter Sellars, Michelangelo Pistoletto and Tetsuo Miyajima.

He is a Fellow of the Royal Society (1990), Member of the Academia Europaea (1991), Member of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts (Salzburg) (1993), Foreign Member of the American Philosophical Society (1998), Founding Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (1998), Fellow of University College London (2000) and Honorary Member of the Physiological Society (2013).

D.Sc. (honoris causa) from Aston University, University of Aberdeen, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and an MD (honoris causa) from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.

Prizes include The Golden Brain Award (1985), Prix Science pour l&#x27;art (1991), Rank Prize in Opto-Electronics (1992) (jointly with A. Movshon and T. Adelson), Zotterman Prize (1993); Koetser Foundation Prize (1997), Award in Electronic Imaging (2002); King Faisal International Prize in Biology (2004), Erasmus Medal (Academia Europaea, 2008), Aristotle Gold Medal (2011), Rome Prize (Atena Onlus) (2012) and the BMI-Kaloy Prize (Kaloy Foundation) 2015. He received the 38th TS Srinivasan Endowment Oration Award 2018, during the TS Srinivasa NIMHANS Conclave. The conclave coincides with the 11th International Congress of the International Neuropsychiatric Association.

==Scientific achievements==
Zeki&#x27;s scientific achievements include:
* Discovery of the many visual areas of the brain and their functional specialisation for different visual attributes such as colour, motion and form.
* Finding neurons in a part of the monkey visual system that would respond only when a particular colour, rather than a particular wavelength, was in their receptive fields. For example, he showed that a red-sensitive neuron would continue to respond to a red stimulus, even when it was illuminated mainly by green light. This was the first study relating colour perception to single cell physiology in the brain.
* Showing that processing sites in the visual brain are also perceptual sites.
* Showing that we see different attributes of visual input at different times.
* Charting the activity of the brain in time and showing that different visual areas have different activity time courses.
* Studying the neural correlates of subjective mental states, such as love and beauty, and more recently, hate.

<doc id="1038048" wikidata="Q2028293" url="?curid=1038048" title="Iterated logarithm">
<text>In computer science, the iterated logarithm of formula_1, written  formula_1 (usually read &quot;log star&quot;), is the number of times the logarithm function must be iteratively applied before the result is less than or equal to formula_3. The simplest formal definition is the result of this recurrence relation:

:formula_4

In computer science,  is often used to indicate the binary iterated logarithm, which iterates the binary logarithm (with base formula_5) instead of the natural logarithm (with base &quot;e&quot;). Mathematically, the iterated logarithm is well defined for any base greater than formula_6, not only for base formula_5 and base &quot;e&quot;. The &quot;super-logarithm&quot; function formula_8 is &quot;essentially equivalent&quot; to the base formula_9 iterated logarithm (although differing in minor details of rounding) and forms an inverse to the operation of tetration.

==Analysis of algorithms==
The iterated logarithm is useful in analysis of algorithms and computational complexity, appearing in the time and space complexity bounds of some algorithms such as:

* Finding the Delaunay triangulation of a set of points knowing the Euclidean minimum spanning tree: randomized O(&quot;n&quot;  &quot;n&quot;) time.
* Fürer&#x27;s algorithm for integer multiplication: O(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot; 2&quot;O&quot;( &quot;n&quot;)).
* Finding an approximate maximum (element at least as large as the median):  &quot;n&quot; − 1 ± 3 parallel operations.
* Richard Cole and Uzi Vishkin&#x27;s distributed algorithm for 3-coloring an &quot;n&quot;-cycle: &quot;O&quot;( &quot;n&quot;) synchronous communication rounds.

The iterated logarithm grows at an extremely slow rate, much slower than the logarithm itself, or repeats of it. This is because the tetration grows much faster than iterated exponential:

formula_10

the inverse grows much slower: formula_11.

For all values of &quot;n&quot; relevant to counting the running times of algorithms implemented in practice (i.e., &quot;n&quot; ≤ 265536, which is far more than the estimated number of atoms in the known universe), the iterated logarithm with base 2 has a value no more than 5.

Higher bases give smaller iterated logarithms.

==Other applications==
The iterated logarithm is closely related to the generalized logarithm function used in symmetric level-index arithmetic. The additive persistence of a number, the number of times someone must replace the number by the sum of its digits before reaching its digital root, is formula_12.

In computational complexity theory, Santhanam shows that the computational resources DTIME — computation time for a deterministic Turing machine — and NTIME — computation time for a non-deterministic Turing machine — are distinct up to formula_13

<text>In psychology, the Stroop effect is the delay in reaction time between neutral and incongruent stimuli.

The effect has been used to create a psychological test (the Stroop test) that is widely used in clinical practice and investigation.

A basic task that demonstrates this effect occurs when there is an incongruent mismatch between the word for a color (e.g., &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, or &quot;red&quot;) and the font color it is printed in (e.g., the word &quot;red&quot; printed in a blue font). Typically, when a person is asked to name the font color for each word in a series of words, they take longer and are more prone to errors when words for colors are printed in incongruous font colors (e.g., it generally takes longer to say &quot;blue&quot; in response to the word &quot;red&quot; in a blue font, than in response to a neutral word of the same length in a blue font, like &quot;kid&quot;).

The effect is named after John Ridley Stroop, who first published the effect in English in 1935. The effect had previously been published in Germany in 1929 by other authors. The original paper by Stroop has been one of the most cited papers in the history of experimental psychology, leading to more than 700 Stroop-related articles in literature.

== Original experiment ==


The effect was named after John Ridley Stroop, who published the effect in English in 1935 in an article in the &quot;Journal of Experimental Psychology&quot; entitled &quot;Studies of interference in serial verbal reactions&quot; that includes three different experiments. However, the effect was first published in 1929 in Germany by Erich Rudolf Jaensch, and its roots can be followed back to works of James McKeen Cattell and Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt in the nineteenth century.

In his experiments, Stroop administered several variations of the same test for which three different kinds of stimuli were created: Names of colors appeared in black ink; Names of colors in a different ink than the color named; and Squares of a given color.

In the first experiment, words and conflict-words were used. The task required the participants to read the written color names of the words independently of the color of the ink (for example, they would have to read &quot;purple&quot; no matter what the color of the font). In experiment 2, stimulus conflict-words and color patches were used, and participants were required to say the ink-color of the letters independently of the written word with the second kind of stimulus and also name the color of the patches. If the word &quot;purple&quot; was written in red font, they would have to say &quot;red&quot;, rather than &quot;purple&quot;. When the squares were shown, the participant spoke the name of the color. Stroop, in the third experiment, tested his participants at different stages of practice at the tasks and stimuli used in the first and second experiments, examining learning effects.

Unlike researchers now using the test for psychological evaluation, Stroop used only the three basic scores, rather than more complex derivative scoring procedures. Stroop noted that participants took significantly longer to complete the color reading in the second task than they had taken to name the colors of the squares in Experiment 2. This delay had not appeared in the first experiment. Such interference were explained by the automation of reading, where the mind automatically determines the semantic meaning of the word (it reads the word &quot;red&quot; and thinks of the color &quot;red&quot;), and then must intentionally check itself and identify instead the color of the word (the ink is a color other than red), a process that is not automated.

== Experimental findings ==
Stimuli in Stroop paradigms can be divided into three groups: neutral, congruent and incongruent. Neutral stimuli are those stimuli in which only the text (similarly to stimuli 1 of Stroop&#x27;s experiment), or color (similarly to stimuli 3 of Stroop&#x27;s experiment) are displayed. Congruent stimuli are those in which the ink color and the word refer to the same color (for example the word &quot;pink&quot; written in pink). Incongruent stimuli are those in which ink color and word differ. Three experimental findings are recurrently found in Stroop experiments. A first finding is &quot;semantic interference&quot;, which states that naming the ink color of neutral stimuli (e.g. when the ink color and word do not interfere with each other) is faster than in incongruent conditions. It is called semantic interference since it is usually accepted that the relationship in meaning between ink color and word is at the root of the interference. The second finding, &quot;semantic facilitation&quot;, explains the finding that naming the ink of congruent stimuli is faster (e.g. when the ink color and the word match) than when neutral stimuli are present (e.g. stimulus 3; when only a colored square is shown). The third finding is that both semantic interference and facilitation disappear when the task consists of reading the word instead of naming the ink color. It has been sometimes called &quot;Stroop asynchrony&quot;, and has been explained by a reduced automatization when naming colors compared to reading words.

In the study of interference theory, the most commonly used procedure has been similar to Stroop&#x27;s second experiment, in which subjects were tested on naming colors of incompatible words and of control patches. The first experiment in Stroop&#x27;s study (reading words in black versus incongruent colors) has been discussed less. In both cases, the interference score is expressed as the difference between the times needed to read each of the two types of cards. Instead of naming stimuli, subjects have also been asked to sort stimuli into categories. Different characteristics of the stimulus such as ink colors or direction of words have also been systematically varied. None of all these modifications eliminates the effect of interference.

== Neuroanatomy ==

Brain imaging techniques including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) have shown that there are two main areas in the brain that are involved in the processing of the Stroop task. They are the anterior cingulate cortex, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. More specifically, while both are activated when resolving conflicts and catching errors, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex assists in memory and other executive functions, while the anterior cingulate cortex is used to select an appropriate response and allocate attentional resources.

The posterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex creates the appropriate rules for the brain to accomplish the current goal. For the Stroop effect, this involves activating the areas of the brain involved in color perception, but not those involved in word encoding. It counteracts biases and irrelevant information, for instance, the fact that the semantic perception of the word is more striking than the color in which it is printed. Next, the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex selects the representation that will fulfill the goal. The relevant information must be separated from irrelevant information in the task; thus, the focus is placed on the ink color and not the word.
Furthermore, research has suggested that left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation during a Stroop task is related to an individual&#x27;s’ expectation regarding the conflicting nature of the upcoming trial, and not so much on the conflict itself. Conversely, the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex aims to reduce the attentional conflict and is activated after the conflict is over.

Moreover, the posterior dorsal anterior cingulate cortex is responsible for what decision is made (i.e. whether someone will say the written word or the ink color). Following the response, the anterior dorsal anterior cingulate cortex is involved in response evaluation—deciding whether the answer is correct or incorrect. Activity in this region increases when the probability of an error is higher.

== Theories ==
There are several theories used to explain the Stroop effect, which are commonly known as &quot;race models&quot;. This is based on the underlying notion that both relevant and irrelevant information are processed in parallel, but that they &quot;race&quot; to enter the single central processor during response selection. They are:

=== Processing speed ===
This theory, also called Relative Speed of Processing Theory, suggests there is a lag in the brain&#x27;s ability to recognize the color of the word since the brain reads words faster than it recognizes colors. This is based on the idea that word processing is significantly faster than color processing. In a condition where there is a conflict regarding words and colors (e.g., Stroop test), if the task is to report the color, the word information arrives at the decision-making stage before the color information which presents processing confusion. Conversely, if the task is to report the word, because color information lags after word information, a decision can be made ahead of the conflicting information.

=== Selective attention ===
The Selective Attention Theory suggests that color recognition, as opposed to reading a word, requires more attention. The brain needs to use more attention to recognize a color than to encode a word, so it takes a little longer. The responses lend much to the interference noted in the Stroop task. This may be a result of either an allocation of attention to the responses or to a greater inhibition of distractors that are not appropriate responses.

=== Automaticity ===

This theory is the most common theory of the Stroop effect. It suggests that since recognizing colors is not an &quot;automatic process&quot; there is hesitancy to respond, whereas, in contrast, the brain automatically understands the meanings of words as a result of habitual reading. This idea is based on the premise that automatic reading does not need controlled attention, but still uses enough attentional resources to reduce the amount of attention accessible for color information processing. Stirling (1979) introduced the concept of response automaticity. He demonstrated that changing the responses from colored words to letters that were not part of the colored words increased reaction time while reducing Stroop interference.

=== Parallel distributed processing ===
This theory suggests that as the brain analyzes information, different and specific pathways are developed for different tasks. Some pathways, such as reading, are stronger than others, therefore, it is the strength of the pathway and not the speed of the pathway that is important. In addition, automaticity is a function of the strength of each pathway, hence, when two pathways are activated simultaneously in the Stroop effect, interference occurs between the stronger (word reading) path and the weaker (color naming) path, more specifically when the pathway that leads to the response is the weaker pathway.

==Cognitive development==
In the neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development, several variations of the Stroop task have been used to study the relations between speed of processing and executive functions with working memory and cognitive development in various domains. This research shows that reaction time to Stroop tasks decreases systematically from early childhood through early adulthood. These changes suggest that speed of processing increases with age and that cognitive control becomes increasingly efficient. Moreover, this research strongly suggests that changes in these processes with age are very closely associated with development in working memory and various aspects of thought.
The stroop task also shows the ability to control behavior. If asked to state the color of the ink rather than the word, the participant must overcome the initial and stronger stimuli to read the word. These inhibitions show the ability for the brain to regulate behavior.

== Uses ==
The Stroop effect has been widely used in psychology. Among the most important uses is the creation of validated psychological tests based on the Stroop effect permit to measure a person&#x27;s selective attention capacity and skills, as well as their processing speed ability. It is also used in conjunction with other neuropsychological assessments to examine a person&#x27;s executive processing abilities, and can help in the diagnosis and characterization of different psychiatric and neurological disorders.

Researchers also use the Stroop effect during brain imaging studies to investigate regions of the brain that are involved in planning, decision-making, and managing real-world interference (e.g., texting and driving).

=== Stroop test ===

The Stroop effect has been used to investigate a person&#x27;s psychological capacities; since its discovery during the twentieth century, it has become a popular neuropsychological test.

There are different test variants commonly used in clinical settings, with differences between them in the number of subtasks, type and number of stimuli, times for the task, or scoring procedures. All versions have at least two numbers of subtasks. In the first trial, the written color name differs from the color ink it is printed in, and the participant must say the written word. In the second trial, the participant must name the ink color instead. However, there can be up to four different subtasks, adding in some cases stimuli consisting of groups of letters &quot;X&quot; or dots printed in a given color with the participant having to say the color of the ink; or names of colors printed in black ink that have to be read. The number of stimuli varies between fewer than twenty items to more than 150, being closely related to the scoring system used. While in some test variants the score is the number of items from a subtask read in a given time, in others it is the time that it took to complete each of the trials. The number of errors and different derived punctuations are also taken into account in some versions.

This test is considered to measure selective attention, cognitive flexibility and processing speed, and it is used as a tool in the evaluation of executive functions. An increased interference effect is found in disorders such as brain damage, dementias and other neurodegenerative diseases, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or a variety of mental disorders such as schizophrenia, addictions, and depression.
Ergonomists could even show a relationship between the ergonomic characteristics of the educational furniture and the number of cognitive errors based on Stroop test. They found that an error percentage reduction using separated chair and desk against arm table student chair.

== Variations ==
The Stroop test has additionally been modified to include other sensory modalities and variables, to study the effect of bilingualism, or to investigate the effect of emotions on interference.

=== Warped words ===
For example, the warped words Stroop effect produces the same findings similar to the original Stroop effect. Much like the Stroop task, the printed word&#x27;s color is different from the ink color of the word; however, the words are printed in such a way that it is more difficult to read (typically curved-shaped). The idea here is the way the words are printed slows down both the brain&#x27;s reaction and processing time, making it harder to complete the task.

=== Emotional ===

The emotional Stroop effect serves as an information processing approach to emotions. In an emotional Stroop task, an individual is given negative emotional words like &quot;grief&quot;, &quot;violence&quot;, and &quot;pain&quot; mixed in with more neutral words like &quot;clock&quot;, &quot;door&quot;, and &quot;shoe&quot;. Just like in the original Stroop task, the words are colored and the individual is supposed to name the color. Research has revealed that individuals that are depressed are more likely to say the color of a negative word slower than the color of a neutral word. While both the emotional Stroop and the classic Stroop involve the need to suppress irrelevant or distracting information, there are differences between the two. The emotional Stroop effect emphasizes the conflict between the emotional relevance to the individual and the word; whereas, the classic Stroop effect examines the conflict between the incongruent color and word. The emotional Stroop effect has been used in psychology to test implicit biases such as racial bias via an implicit-association test. A notable study of this is Project Implicit from Harvard University which administered a test associating negative or positive emotions with pictures of race and measured the reaction time to determine racial preference.

=== Spatial ===
The spatial Stroop effect demonstrates interference between the stimulus location with the location in the stimuli. In one version of the spatial Stroop task, an up or down-pointing arrow appears randomly above or below a central point. Despite being asked to discriminate the direction of the arrow while ignoring its location, individuals typically make faster and more accurate responses to congruent stimuli (i.e., a down-pointing arrow located below the fixation sign) than to incongruent ones (i.e., an up-pointing arrow located below the fixation sign). A similar effect, the Simon effect, uses non-spatial stimuli.

=== Numerical ===
The Numerical Stroop effect demonstrates the close relationship between numerical values and physical sizes. Digits symbolize numerical values but they also have physical sizes. A digit can be presented as big or small (e.g., 5 vs. 5), irrespective of its numerical value. Comparing digits in incongruent trials (e.g., 3 5) is slower than comparing digits in congruent trials (e.g., 5 3) and the difference in reaction time is termed the numerical Stroop effect. The effect of irrelevant numerical values on physical comparisons (similar to the effect of irrelevant color words on responding to colors) suggests that numerical values are processed automatically (i.e., even when they are irrelevant to the task).

=== Reverse ===
Another variant of the classic Stroop effect is the reverse Stroop effect. It occurs during a pointing task. In a reverse Stroop task, individuals are shown a page with a black square with an incongruent colored word in the middle—for instance, the word &quot;red&quot; written in the color green (red)—with four smaller colored squares in the corners. One square would be colored green, one square would be red, and the two remaining squares would be other colors. Studies show that if the individual is asked to point to the color square of the written color (in this case, red) they would present a delay. Thus, incongruently-colored words significantly interfere with pointing to the appropriate square. However, some research has shown there is very little interference from incongruent color words when the objective is to match the color of the word.

== In popular culture ==
The &quot;Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!&quot; software program, produced by Ryūta Kawashima for the Nintendo DS portable video game system, contains an automated Stroop test administrator module translated into game form.

&quot;MythBusters&quot; used the Stroop effect test to see if males and females are cognitively impaired by having an attractive person of the opposite sex in the room. The &quot;myth&quot; (that is, hypothesis) was disproved. A &quot;Nova&quot; episode used the Stroop Effect to illustrate the subtle changes of the mental flexibility of Mount Everest climbers in relation to altitude.

2024 horror video game The Outlast Trials features a &quot;Stroop Test&quot; minigame in which players compete against one another.

<text>Neuroesthetics (or neuroaesthetics) is a recent sub-discipline of applied aesthetics. Empirical aesthetics takes a scientific approach to the study of aesthetic experience of art, music, or any object that can give rise to aesthetic judgments. Neuroesthetics is a term coined by Semir Zeki in 1999 and received its formal definition in 2002 as the scientific study of the neural bases for the contemplation and creation of a work of art. Anthropologists and evolutionary biologists alike have accumulated evidence suggesting that human interest in, and creation of, art evolved as an evolutionarily necessary mechanism for survival across cultures and throughout history. Neuroesthetics uses neuroscience to explain and understand the aesthetic experiences at the neurological level. The topic attracts scholars from many disciplines including neuroscientists, art historians, artists, art therapists and psychologists.

== Overview ==
Neuroaesthetics is a field of experimental science that aims to combine (neuro-)psychological research with aesthetics by investigating the &quot;perception, production, and response to art, as well as interactions with objects and scenes that evoke an intense feeling, often of pleasure.&quot; The recently developed field seeks among other things the neural correlates of aesthetic judgment and creativity, and how these help humans communicate and connect. It is argued that visual aesthetics, namely the capacity of assigning different degrees of beauty to certain forms, colors, or movements, is a human trait acquired after the divergence of human and other ape lineages, rendering the experience of beauty a defining characteristic of humankind.

One core question for the field is whether art or aesthetic preferences are guided by a set of scientific laws or principles. Additionally, the evolutionary rationale for the formation and characteristics of these principles are sought. It is believed that identification of the brain circuitry involved in aesthetic judgments (e.g., by using through the use of brain imaging) can help pinpoint the origin of these responses. Many scholars, including neuroscientists, remain skeptical of the reductive approach adopted by neuroaesthetics.

The subfield of Computational Neuroaesthetics has aimed to utilize machine learning algorithms in conjunction with neuroimaging data to predict what humans would find most aesthetically pleasing. This field was pioneered by Fechner and Birkhoff in 1933; however it was years later that technology caught up enough to test, and prove, their hypotheses that aesthetics could be measured in a mathematical way Real world applications of these models include recommending products via online advertisement. However, modeling serves the broader purpose of building scientific understanding and understanding the mechanisms guiding decision making and other cognitive processes by simulating the involved neural architecture.

== Approaches of study ==
Researchers who have been prominent in the field combine principles from perceptual psychology, evolutionary biology, neurological deficits, and functional brain anatomy in order to address the evolutionary meaning of beauty that may be the essence of art. Involvement from both the rewards center of the brain and the Default Mode Network, once believed to only play a part in daydreaming, have been implicated in why humans derive pleasure from viewing and creating art. It is felt that neuroscience is a very promising path for the search for the quantified evaluation of art. With the aim of discovering general rules about aesthetics, one approach is the observation of subjects viewing art and the exploration of the mechanics of vision. It is proposed that pleasing sensations are derived from the repeated activation of neurons due to primitive visual stimuli such as horizontal and vertical lines. In addition to the generation of theories to explain this, such as Ramachandran&#x27;s set of laws, it is important to use neuroscience to determine and understand the neurological mechanisms involved.

Neuroaesthetics approaches can be either descriptive or experimental. Descriptive neuroaesthetics refers to the practice of mapping properties of the brain onto aesthetic experiences. For example, if color is important to the experience of Fauvist art, then it is likely that areas of the brain that process color will be engaged when looking at such art. The claims of descriptive neuroaesthetics are regarded as hypothesis-generating and are typically qualitative in nature. Experimental neuroaesthetics, like any experimental science, produces data that are quantitative and vetted statistically. Experimental neuroaesthetics tests hypotheses, predicts results, and invites replication or falsification. The typical experimental methods used are those of cognitive neuroscience: fMRI, ERP, TMS, TDCS, and neuropsychology. Critics of neuroaesthetics typically target descriptive and not experimental neuroaesthetics.

The link between specific brain areas and artistic activity is of great importance to the field of neuroesthetics. This can be applied both to the ability to create and interpret art. A common approach to uncover the neural mechanisms is through the study of individuals, specifically artists, with neural disorders such as savant syndrome or some form of traumatic injury. The analysis of art created by these patients provides valuable insights to the brain areas responsible for capturing the essence of art.

The aesthetic enjoyment of individuals can be investigated using brain imaging experiments. When subjects are confronted with images of a particular level of aesthetics, the specific brain areas that are activated can be identified. It is argued that the sense of beauty and aesthetic judgment presupposes a change in the activation of the brain&#x27;s reward system.

In 2004, Helmut Leder has developed a broad research program on the psychology of aesthetics and the arts. This program was introduced as a cognitive model of the appreciation of art in a paper published in the &quot;British Journal of Psychology&quot;. This model has served to frame many studies on the cognitive foundations of art, neuroaesthetics, product design, and web design, among other fields.

A crucial aspect of research lies in whether aesthetic judgment can be thought of as a bottom-up process driven by neural primitives or as a top-down process with high level cognition. Neurologists have had success researching primitives. However, there is a need to define higher level abstract philosophical concepts objectively with neural correlates. A phenomenon called embodied cognition allows art viewers to mentally place themselves inside the artwork, and feel not only as if they were there but feel how the creator of the art may have felt [1a]. Embodied cognition is a theory that suggests sensory experiences, motor actions, and the environment play significant roles in shaping how we think, reason, and understand the world; our material world is just that, not a projection created by the mind. It is suggested that aesthetic experience is a function of the interaction between top-down, intentional orientation of attention and the bottom-up perceptual facilitation of image construction. In other words, because untrained persons automatically apply the object-identification habit to viewing artworks, top-down control to reduce this habit may be necessary to engage aesthetic perception. This suggests that artists would show different levels of activation than non-artists.

Aesthetic responses to different types of art and techniques has recently been explored. Cubism is the most radical departure from Western forms of art, with the proposed purpose of forcing the viewer to discover less unstable elements of the object to be represented. It eliminates interferences such as lighting and perspective angle to capture objects as they really are. This may be compared to how the brain maintains an object&#x27;s identity despite varying conditions. Modern, representational, and impressionistic art has also been studied for the purpose of explaining visual processing systems. Yet aesthetic judgments exists in all domains, not just art.

== Subcategories ==

=== Neuroarchitecture ===
It has been proven that architecture surrounding us has the ability to impact our emotions. A study done by Trujillo and colleagues measured stress levels of participants in 20 different waiting rooms showed that the architecture of a waiting room could impact individuals stress response to be either lower or higher. Research such as this can serve the argument that compositions of aesthetics such as architecture have a direct link to our neurophysiology. Evidence for this has been shown in testing different mechanisms in response to different environment, Joel Martínez-Soto and colleagues showed that exposure to restorative environments, such as structures with natural component led to activation of the middle frontal gyrus, middle and inferior temporal gyrus, insula, inferior parietal lobe, and cuneus linking these reactions to increased relaxation. Moreover, a study measuring stress response showed that the waiting room with a window versus without a window triggered less of a stress response, measured by physiological reactions of this stress state consisted of both heightened and prolonged spikes in salivary cortisol. it&#x27;s unknown what exact components of architecture create more calm or stress responses in participants, or via which mechanisms they may be interacting with the nervous system to either elicit calm or stress responses, however this research serves to show how aspects we already widely accept to be restorative and calming, such as windows, natural light or vegetation can impact us on a neurophysiological level. Research on how this varies from individual to individual along with personal style is where future research is headed in this field.

== Frameworks ==
=== Aesthetic triad ===
Aesthetic experiences are an emergent property of interactions among a triad of neural systems that involve sensory-motor, emotion-valuation, and meaning-knowledge circuitry. Understanding that much of the research done on neuroaesthetics utilizes the aesthetic triad. The aesthetic triad are the components of the neural system utilized in an aesthetic experience and in research method, these components include sensory-motor, knowledge meaning and emotional valuation. The sensory- motor aspect is our automatic response to the recognition of objects and our engagement with said objects through our natural embodied reactions, while knowledge meaning establishes the understanding that our experience depends on the context and content present within the experience as shown in studies on neuroaesthetics, lastly the emotional valuation of these experiences is the component of our emotional response of either anger, fear, elation, or awe in these settings. Exploring the different subtopics of neuroaesthetics and the research being done aligns with this aesthetic triad.

The visual brain segregates visual elements like luminance, color, and motion, as well as higher order objects like faces, bodies, and landscapes. Aesthetic encounters engage these sensory systems. For example, gazing at Van Gogh&#x27;s dynamic paintings evokes a subjective sense of movement and activates visual motion areas V5/MT+. Portraits activate the face area in the fusiform gyrus (FFA) and landscape paintings activate the place area in the parahippocampal gyrus (PPA). Beyond classifying visual elements, these sensory areas may also be involved in evaluating them. Beautiful faces activate the fusiform face and adjacent areas. The question of how much and what kind of valuation takes place in sensory cortices is an area of active inquiry.

Looking at paintings that depict actions also engages parts of people&#x27;s motor systems. This engagement taps into the extended mirror neuron system. Mirror neurons, first discovered in monkeys, are neurons that respond to both the execution and perception of actions. A similar system exists in humans. This system resonates when people infer the intent of artistic gestures or observe the consequences of actions such as in Lucio Fontana&#x27;s cut canvases. This subtle motor engagement may represent an embodied element of our empathetic responses to visual art.

The pleasure that people derive from looking at beautiful objects automatically engages general reward circuitry. For example, attractive faces activate the FFA and parts of the ventral striatum even when people are not thinking explicitly about the attractiveness of these faces. The orbito- and medial-frontal cortex, the ventral striatum, anterior cingulate and insula respond to beautiful visual images and the medial orbitofrontal cortex and adjacent cingulate cortex respond to different sources of pleasures including music and even architectural spaces.

Kirk and colleagues investigated the effects of expectations on neural responses. People rated abstract &quot;art-like&quot; images as more attractive if labeled as being from a museum than labeled as generated by a computer. This preference was accompanied by greater neural activity in the medial orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Thinking an image was a museum piece also produced activity in the entorhinal cortex, suggesting that people&#x27;s expectations draw on memories that enhance (or probably also diminish) visual pleasure. Similarly, Lacey and colleagues found that people&#x27;s ventral striatum and parts of the orbitofrontal cortex were more responsive to the &quot;art status&quot; than to the actual content of visual images. Huang and colleagues found that people have different neural responses when told that they are looking at an authentic or copied Rembrandt portrait. Authentic portraits evoked orbitofrontal activity, whereas copies evoked neural responses in the frontopolar cortex and the right precuneus.

Alternatively, according to the Neo-Kantian approach, &quot;aesthetic pleasure arises from the fitting of predictive representations to sensory experiences&quot;. When our predictive representations align well with our sensory experiences, it results in a sense of aesthetic pleasure. This alignment might involve things like finding coherence, harmony, or resonance between what we expected and what we actually perceive.The implication of these studies is that context and knowledge beyond the sensory qualities of visual images demonstrably affects people&#x27;s neural activity in aesthetic experiences.

=== Semir Zeki&#x27;s laws of the visual brain ===
Semir Zeki, professor of neuroesthetics at the University College of London, views art as an example of the variability of the brain. Thus a neurological approach to the source of this variability may explain particular subjective experiences as well as the ranges of abilities to create and experience art. Zeki theorizes that artists unconsciously use techniques to create visual art to study the brain. Zeki suggests that

&quot;...the artist is in a sense, a neuroscientist, exploring the potentials and capacities of the brain, though with different tools. How such creations can arouse aesthetic experiences can only be fully understood in neural terms. Such an understanding is now well within our reach.&quot;He proposes two supreme laws of the visual brain:

====Constancy====
Despite the changes that occur when processing visual stimuli (distance, viewing angle, illumination, etc.), the brain has the unique ability to retain knowledge of constant and essential properties of an object and discard irrelevant dynamic properties. This applies not only to the ability to, for example, always see a banana as the color yellow but also the recognition of faces at varying angles.

Comparatively, a work of art captures the essence of an object. The creation of art itself may be modeled off of this primitive neural function. The process of painting for example involves distilling an object down to represent it as it really is, which differs from the way the eyes see it. Zeki also tried to represent the Platonic Ideal and the Hegelian Concept through the statement: forms do not have an existence without a brain and the ability for stored memory, referring to how artists such as Monet could paint without knowing what the objects are in order to capture their true form.

====Abstraction====
This process refers to the hierarchical coordination where a general representation can be applied to many particulars, allowing the brain to efficiently process visual stimuli. The ability to abstract may have evolved as a necessity due to the limitations of memory. In a way, art externalizes the functions of abstraction in the brain. The process of abstraction is unknown to cognitive neurobiology. However, Zeki proposes an interesting question of whether there is a significant difference in the pattern of brain activity when viewing abstract art as opposed to representational art.

=== Ramachandran&#x27;s eight laws of artistic experience ===
Vilayanur S. Ramachandran and his fellow researchers including William Hirstein, developed a highly speculative theory of human artistic experience and the neural mechanisms that mediate it. These &quot;laws&quot; combine to develop underlying high order concepts of the human artistic experience. Although not all encompassing as there are undoubtedly many other principles of artistic experience, the theorists claim that they provide a framework for understanding aspects of visual art, style and design. Although testing of these principles quantitatively may provide future evidence for specific areas of the brain responsible for one kind of aesthetic appeal, the theory faces substantial philosophical and historical objections.

====Peak shift principle====

This psychological phenomenon is typically known for its application in animal discrimination learning. In the peak shift effect, animals sometimes respond more strongly to exaggerated versions of the training stimuli. For instance, a rat is trained to discriminate a square from a rectangle by being rewarded for recognizing the rectangle. The rat will respond more frequently to the object for which it is being rewarded to the point that a rat will respond to a rectangle that is longer and more narrow with a higher frequency than the original with which it was trained. This is called a supernormal stimulus. The fact that the rat is responding more to a &quot;super&quot; rectangle implies that it is learning a rule.

This effect can be applied to human pattern recognition and aesthetic preference. Some artists attempt to capture the very essence of something in order to evoke a direct emotional response. In other words, they try to make a &quot;super&quot; rectangle to get the viewer to have an enhanced response. To capture the essence of something, an artist amplifies the differences of that object, or what makes it unique, to highlight the essential features and reduce redundant information. This process mimics what the visual areas of the brain have evolved to do and more powerfully activates the same neural mechanisms that were originally activated by the original object.

Some artists deliberately exaggerate creative components such as shading, highlights, and illumination to an extent that would never occur in a real image to produce a caricature. These artists may be unconsciously producing heightened activity in the specific areas of the brain in a manner that is not obvious to the conscious mind. A significant portion of the experience of art is not self-consciously reflected upon by audiences, so it is not clear whether the peak-shift thesis has any special explanatory power in understanding the creation and reception of art.

====Isolation====
Isolating a single visual cue helps the organism allocate attention to the output of a single module, thereby allowing it to more effectively enjoy the peak shift along the dimensions represented in that module. In other words, there is a need to isolate the desired visual form before that aspect is amplified. This is why an outline drawing or sketch is sometimes more effective as art than an original color photograph. For example, a cartoonist may exaggerate certain facial features which are unique to the character and remove other forms which it shares such as skin tones. This efficiency prevents non-unique features from detracting from the image. This is why one can predict that an outline drawing would be more aesthetically pleasing than a color photograph.

The viewer&#x27;s attention is drawn towards this single area allowing one&#x27;s attention to be focused on this source of information. Enhancements introduced by the artist more carefully noted resulting in the amplification of limbic system activation and reinforcement.

====Grouping====
Perceptual grouping to delineate a figure from the background may be enjoyable. The source of the pleasure may have come about because of the evolutionary necessity to give organisms an incentive to uncover objects, such as predators, from noisy environments. For example, when viewing ink blots, the visual system segments the scene to defeat camouflage and link a subset of splotches together. This may be accomplished most effectively if limbic reinforcement is fed back to early vision at every stage of visual processing leading up to the discovery of the object. The key idea is that due to the limited attentional resources, constant feedback facilitates processing of features at earlier stages due to the discovery of a clue which produces limbic activation to draw one&#x27;s attention to important features. Though not spontaneous, this reinforcement is the source of the pleasant sensation. The discovery of the object itself results in a pleasant &#x27;aha&#x27; revelation causing the organism to hold onto the image.

An artist can make use of this phenomenon by teasing the system. This allows for temporary binding to be communicated by a signal to the limbic system for reinforcement which is a source of the aesthetic experience.

====Contrast====
Extracting contrast involves eliminating redundant information and focusing attention. Cells in the retina, the lateral geniculate body or relay station in the brain, and in the visual cortex respond predominantly to step changes in luminance rather than homogeneous surface colors. Smooth gradients are much harder for the visual system to detect rather than segmented divisions of shades resulting in easily detectable edges. Contrasts due to the formation of edges may be pleasing to the eye. The importance of the visual neuron&#x27;s varying responses to the orientation and presence of edges has previously been proven by David H. Hubel and Torsten Wiesel. This may hold evolutionary significance since regions of contrast are information rich requiring reinforcement and the allocation of attention. In contrast to the principle of grouping, contrasting features are typically in close proximity eliminating the need to link distant, but similar features.

====Perceptual problem solving====
Tied to the detection of contrast and grouping is the concept that discovery of an object after a struggle is more pleasing than one which is instantaneously obvious. The mechanism ensures that the struggle is reinforcing so that the viewer continues to look until the discovery. From a survival point of view, this may be important for the continued search for predators. Ramachandran suggests for the same reason that a model whose hips and breasts are about to be revealed is more provocative than one who is already completely naked. A meaning that is implied is more alluring than one that is explicit.

====Generic viewpoint====
The visual system dislikes interpretations which rely on a unique vantage point. Rather it accepts the visual interpretation for which there is an infinite set of viewpoints that could produce the class of retinal images. For example, in a landscape image, it will interpret an object in the foreground as obscuring an object in the background, rather than assuming that the background figure has a piece missing.

In theory, if an artist is trying to please the eye, they should avoid such coincidences. However, in certain applications, the violation of this principle can also produce a pleasing effect.

====Visual metaphors====
Ramachandran defines a metaphor as a mental tunnel between two concepts that appear grossly dissimilar on the surface, but instead share a deeper connection. Similar to the effects of perceptual problem solving, grasping an analogy is rewarding. It enables the viewer to highlight crucial aspects that the two objects share. Although it is uncertain whether the reason for this mechanism is for effective communication or purely cognitive, the discovery of similarities between superficially dissimilar events leads to activation of the limbic system to create a rewarding process.

Support for this view is highlighted by the symptoms of Capgras delusion, where sufferers experience reduced facial recognition due to impairments in the connections from the inferotemporal cortex to the amygdala, which is responsible for emotions. The result is that a person no longer experiences the warm fuzzy feeling when presented with a familiar face. A person&#x27;s &quot;glow&quot; is lost through what is suggested as due to the lack of limbic activation.

====Symmetry====
The aesthetic appeal of symmetry is easily understandable. Biologically it is important during the detection of a predator, location of prey, and the choosing of a mate as all of these tend to display symmetry in nature. It complements other principles relating to the discovering of information rich objects. Additionally, evolutionary biologists suggest that the predisposition towards symmetry is because biologically, asymmetry is associated with infection and disease, which can lead to poor mate selection. However, departures from symmetry in visual art are also widely considered beautiful, suggesting that while symmetry may explain the judgment that a particular individual&#x27;s face is beautiful, it cannot explain the judgment that a work of art is beautiful.

== Areas of the brain linked to the processing of visual aesthetics ==
Aesthetic perception relies heavily on the processing by the visual centers in the brain such as the V1 cortex. Signals from V1 are distributed to various specialized areas of the brain. There is no single area where all specialized visual circuitry connect, reducing the chances of determining a single neural center responsible for aesthetics, rather a neural network is more likely. Therefore, the visual brain consists of several parallel multistage processing systems, each specialized in a given task such as color or motion. Functional specializations of the visual brain are already known.

Physiological phenomenon can explain several aspects of art appreciation. Different extrastriate areas of the visual cortex may have evolved to extract correlations of different visual features. The discovery and linking of various visual stimuli is facilitated and reinforced by direct connections from these areas to limbic structures. Additionally, art may be most appealing if it produces heightened activity in a single dimension rather than redundant activation of multiple modules, restricted by the allocation of attentional resources. In experimentation to determine specific areas, many researchers allow the viewer to decide the aesthetic appeal prior to the use of imaging techniques to account for the varying perceptions of beauty. When individuals contemplate the aesthetic appeal, different neural processes are engaged than when pragmatically viewing an image. However, processes of object identification and aesthetic judgment are involved simultaneously in the overall perception of aesthetics.

===Prefrontal cortex===

The prefrontal cortex is previously known for its roles in the perception of colored objects, decision making, and memory. Recent studies have also linked it to the conscious aesthetic experience because it is activated during aesthetic tasks such as determining the appeal of a visual stimuli. This may be because a judgment is needed, requiring visiospatial memory. In a study performed by Zeki and Kawabata, it was found that the medial orbito-frontal cortex (mOFC) is involved in the judgment of whether a painting is beautiful or not. There is high activation in this region when a person views paintings which they consider beautiful. Other evidence shows that this same area is active during the experience of beauty derived from different sources, including musical beauty and moral beauty, and even mathematical beauty. Experience of the sublime, as opposed to the beautiful, results in a different pattern of brain activity; moreover, where it comes to judgment, although aesthetic and perceptual judgments leads t activity in the same brain areas, the pattern of activity is also different between the two, one of the most marked differences being the involvement of mOFC in aesthetic, but not in perceptual, judgments. Surprisingly, when a person views a painting which they consider ugly, no separate structures are activated. Therefore, it is proposed that changes in the intensity of activation in the orbito-frontal cortex correlate with the determination of beauty (higher activation) or ugliness (lower activation).

Conversely, activity in the motor cortex showed the opposite pattern. Additionally, the medial OFC has been found to respond aesthetics in terms of the context of which it is presented, such as text or other descriptions about the artwork. The current evidence linking the OFC to attributed hedonistic values across gustatory, olfactory, and visual modalities, suggests that the OFC is a common center for the assessment of a stimulus&#x27;s value. The perception of aesthetics for these areas must be due to the activation of the brain&#x27;s reward system with a certain intensity.
Additionally, the prefrontal dorsalateral cortex (PDC) is selectively activated only by stimuli considered beautiful whereas prefrontal activity as a whole is activated during the judgment of both pleasing and unpleasing stimuli. The prefrontal cortex may be generally activated for directing the attention of the cognitive and perceptual mechanisms towards aesthetic perception in viewers untrained in visual arts. In other words, related directly to a person viewing art from an aesthetic perception due to the top-down control of their cognition. The lateral prefrontal cortex is shown to be linked to higher order self-referential procession and the evaluation of internally generated information. The left lateral PFC, Brodmann area 10, may be involved in maintaining attention on the execution of internally generated goals associated with approaching art from an aesthetic orientation.

Broca&#x27;s Area, also in the Prefrontal cortex is impaired in many individuals with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Dysfunction in this area leads to deficits in speech production; in this case the inability to verbally process a traumatic event(s). The process of making art allows those affected to &quot;access pre-language areas of the brain&quot; by creating their own symbolic imagery and connecting with others through this. Directing attention towards aesthetics may have evolutionary significance.

===Additional areas===
Emotions play a large role in aesthetic processing. Experiments designed specifically to force the subjects to view the artwork subjectively (by inquiring of its aesthetic appeal) rather than simply with the visual systems, revealed a higher activation in the brain&#x27;s emotional circuitry. Results from these experiments revealed high activation in the bilateral insula which can be attributed to the emotional experience of viewing art. This correlates with other known emotional roles of the insula. However, the correlation between the insula&#x27;s varying states of activation and positive or negative emotions in this context is unknown. The emotional view of art can be contrasted with perception related to object recognition when pragmatically viewing art. The right fusiform gyrus has been revealed to show activation to visual stimuli such as faces and representational art. The neuroaesthetics of facial recognition hold particular importance, as being drawn to faces likely increased sociability, allowing tribal environments to grow, resulting in greater protection and more availability of mates. This is likely involved in genetic fitness of offspring and child-rearing as well.

This holds importance in the field because as Ramachandran also speculated, object recognition and the search for meaning can evoke a pleasant emotional response. The motor cortex was also shown to be involved in aesthetic perception. However, it displayed opposite trends of activation from the OFC. It may be a common correlate for the perception of emotionally charged stimuli despite its previously known roles. Several other areas of the brain were shown to be slightly activated during certain studies such as the anterior cingulate cortex, previously known for its involvement in the feeling of romance, and the left parietal cortex, whose purpose may be to direct spatial attention.

Different artistic styles may also be processed differently by the brain. In a study between filtered forms of abstract and representation art, the bilateral occipital gyri, left cingulate sulcus, and bilateral fusiform gyrus showed increased activation with increased preference when viewing art. However, activation in the bilateral occipital gyri may be caused by the large processing requirements placed on the visual system when viewing high levels of visual detail in artwork such as representational paintings. Several areas of the brain have been shown to respond particularly to forms representational art perhaps due to the brain&#x27;s ability to make object associations and other functions relating to attention and memory. This form of stimuli leads to increased activation in the left frontal lobe and bilaterally in the parietal and limbic lobes. Also, the left superior parietal lobule, Brodmann&#x27;s area 7, has been shown to play a role in active image construction during the viewing of art specifically containing indeterminate forms such as soft edge paintings. Bottom up processes such as edge detection and the exploration of visual stimuli are engaged during this type of aesthetic perception. These roles are consistent with previously known parietal lobe responsibilities in spatial cognition and visual imagery.

== Criticism ==
There are several objections to researchers&#x27; attempts to reduce aesthetic experience to a set of physical or neurological laws. It is questionable whether the theories can capture the evocativeness or originality of individual works of art. Experiments performed may not account for these theories directly. Also, current experimentation measures a person&#x27;s verbal response to how they feel about art which is often selectively filtered. Ramachandran suggests the use of galvanic skin response to quantify the judgment associated viewing aesthetics. Overall, it can be argued that there is lack of proportion between the narrow approach to art taken by researchers versus the grand claims they make for their theories.

Additional research carries the assumption that our emotions are engaged when viewing or interacting with something related to aesthetics such as architecture, fashion or art however, the argument has been made by Alexis Makin, a researcher on visual neuroscience, that we can not yet encapsulate the neuroscience and psychological experience that occurs when having an aesthetic experience. Thus insinuating that we can not attribute our experience of aesthetics to that of something on the neurophysiological level. In negation to this, Skov and his colleagues make the argument that he emotional response elicited and the perceptual cues engaged in aesthetic experiences is enough evidence to ascertain the existence of empirical aesthetics. The majority of studies on neuroaesthetics have measured neural responses to traditional and Western art styles. One journal suggested rerunning these experiments using &quot;traditional Chinese painting, Tang poetry, Chinese courtyard landscapes&quot;. Limiting the scope of cultural stimuli creates bias in results because factors such as familiarity may affect participant responses.

== Future directions and related fields ==
Since 2005 the notion of bridging brain science and the visual arts has blossomed into a field of increasing international interest. In his 2008 book, &quot;Neuroarthistory: from Aristotle and Pliny to Baxandall and Zeki&quot;, Professor John Onians of the University of East Anglia considers himself to be at the forefront of the field of neural scientific biased art historical research, although such a &quot;history&quot; is much shorter than Onians would have us believe. Many historical figures he deals with as precursors for neuroarthistory (Karl Marx, for example) have very little to do with modern neuroscience as it is understood today. Contemporary artists like Mark Stephen Smith (William Campbell Gallery, US), Guillaume Bottazzi and others have developed extensive bodies of work mapping the convergence of brain science and painting. Smith&#x27;s work explores fundamental visual analogies between neural function and self-expression in abstract art. The past decade has also seen a corresponding growth in the aesthetics of music studied from neuroscientific approaches. Psychological and social approaches to art help provide other theories of experience.

Art and music therapy are two proposed clinical applications for neuroaesthetics. Individuals with a variety of conditions including, but not limited to, Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), and Neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinsons, have shown symptom improvement after many types of art therapy and art exposure.

The advancements of biotechnology over time should allow neurophysiological responses to be recorded outside of the laboratory setting[4a]. Future directions should measure these responses while participants take part in immersive exhibits, especially those involving immersive multimedia exhibits such as TeamLab Planets TOKYO https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeamLab_(art_collective)

<text>Martin Gardiner Bernal (; 10 March 1937 – 9 June 2013)
was a British scholar of modern Chinese political history. He was a Professor of Government and Near Eastern Studies at Cornell University. He is best known for his work &quot;Black Athena&quot;, a pseudoarchaeological, controversial work which argues that the culture, language, and political structure of Ancient Greece contained substantial influences from Egypt and Syria-Palestine.

==Early life and education==
Bernal was born and grew up in Hampstead, London, the son of the physicist John Desmond Bernal and artists&#x27; patron Margaret Gardiner. He was educated at Dartington Hall School and then at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he was awarded a degree in 1961 with first-class Honours in the Oriental Studies Tripos. At that time he specialised in the language and history of China, and spent some time at the Peking University. He carried on as a graduate student at Cambridge, and with the assistance of the Harkness Commonwealth Fellowship also at University of California, Berkeley and Harvard University, finishing his PhD in Cambridge in 1965 with thesis titled &quot;Chinese Socialism to 1913&quot; when he was elected a fellow at King&#x27;s.

==Career==
In 1972 Bernal moved to Cornell University in New York, United States. There he resided in the Telluride House as a faculty fellow, and became a full professor in 1988. He taught there for the rest of his career, retiring in 2001.

Initially he taught Government Studies at Cornell, and continued his research on modern Chinese history. Under the impact of the Vietnam War he had also developed an interest in Vietnamese history and culture, and learned the Vietnamese language.

From about 1975, however, Bernal underwent a radical shift in his interests. In his own words:
The scattered Jewish components of my ancestry would have given nightmares to assessors trying to apply the Nuremberg Laws, and although pleased to have these fractions, I had not previously given much thought to them or to Jewish culture. It was at this stage that I became intrigued—in a Romantic way—in this part of my &#x27;roots&#x27;. I started looking into ancient Jewish history and— being on the periphery myself—into the relationship between the Israelites and the surrounding peoples, particularly the Canaanites and the Phoenicians. I had always known that the latter spoke Semitic languages, but it came as quite a shock to learn that Hebrew and Phoenician were mutually intelligible and that serious linguists treated both as a &quot;dialect&quot; of a single Canaanite language.During this time, I was beginning to study Hebrew and I found what seemed to me a number of striking similarities between it and Greek ...

Bernal came to the conclusion that ancient Greek accounts of Egyptian influence on their civilisation should be taken seriously. He had been interested in ancient Egypt since childhood, in part inspired by his grandfather Sir Alan Gardiner. Bernal&#x27;s new direction was strengthened by his discovery of the work of Cyrus Gordon and Michael Astour. In due course he wrote &quot;Black Athena&quot;.

Bernal also wrote the book &quot;Cadmean Letters&quot;, devoted to the origins of the Greek alphabet. He devoted his next twenty years to writing the next two volumes of &quot;Black Athena&quot;, with the second volume devoted to archaeological and documentary evidence, and the third to linguistic evidence. He also spent considerable time defending his work.

He became Professor Emeritus upon his retirement in 2001.

==Personal life==
In 1961, Bernal married Judy Pace (later known as Judith Dunn). Together, they had one daughter and twin sons. They later divorced. His second wife, Leslie Miller-Bernal, and his five children survived him.

<text>The 3Xtrim Aircraft Factory, or Zakłady Lotnicze 3Xtrim Sp.z o.o.in Polish, was an aircraft manufacturer located in the city of Bielsko-Biała, in southern Poland.

The company was established by former SZD sailplane engineer Adam Kurbiel in 1996 under the name &quot;Wytwórnia i Naprawa Konstrukcji Lekkich - A. Kurbiel&quot;. The company hired many of the out-of-work aerospace workers who had been employed at the sailplane manufacturer. The company name was changed to Zakłady Lotnicze 3Xtrim Sp.z o.o. in November 1999. The company seems to have gone out of business in 2014.

3Xtrim concentrated on the design and production of the 3X55 and 3X47 ultralight aircraft, which first flew in prototype form in 1996.

The company name 3Xtrim was intended to be a double entendre, referring to the aircraft designs being &quot;triple trimmed&quot; (or more exactly &quot;triple-tested&quot;) during the design, prototype and production stages and also that the aircraft are designed for &quot;extreme conditions&quot;. In English the company name is pronounced &quot;Three-Extreme&quot;.

<doc id="1038057" wikidata="Q7379620" url="?curid=1038057" title="Runanga, New Zealand">
<text>Runanga is a small town on the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand. It is located eight kilometres to the northeast of Greymouth, to the north of the Grey River. Barrytown is further north. and the Rapahoe Branch railway run through the town. Runanga was formerly a railway junction, with the steep Rewanui Branch diverging from the Rapahoe line until closure in 1985.

The town&#x27;s origins can be traced back to European colonisation in the late 19th century, when large numbers of settlers came to work the local coal fields. The town&#x27;s name is Māori for &quot;meeting place&quot;. Coal mining is still the main employer of the town.

==History==
During the period 1853 to 1876, the area which became the township of Runanga was administrated as part of the Nelson Province.

Unlike many towns and settlements on the West Coast which grew up around gold mining, Runanga was established as a centre to support the local coal mining industry. In 1902 the Seddon Government established its own coal mines, proclaiming the whole area on the north side of the Grey River as a State Coal Reserve. The Point Elizabeth No. 1 mine began producing coal from 17 March 1904. In 1903 a sawmill opened and timber houses began to replace the tents which had formed housing until then. The Borough of Runanga came into effect in 1912 with an area of 1,210 acres and a population of about 1,500.

==Demographics==
Runanga statistical area, which includes Dunollie and Rapahoe, covers . It had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.

Runanga had a population of 1,185 at the 2018 New Zealand census, a decrease of 63 people (−5.0%) since the 2013 census, and a decrease of 48 people (−3.9%) since the 2006 census. There were 519 households, comprising 621 males and 567 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.1 males per female. The median age was 45.2 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 201 people (17.0%) aged under 15 years, 204 (17.2%) aged 15 to 29, 564 (47.6%) aged 30 to 64, and 213 (18.0%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 92.9% European/Pākehā, 11.9% Māori, 0.8% Pasifika, 1.8% Asian, and 1.3% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 6.3, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 59.5% had no religion, 26.3% were Christian, 0.5% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.3% were Muslim, 0.3% were Buddhist and 2.3% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 45 (4.6%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 342 (34.8%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $24,400, compared with $31,800 nationally. 75 people (7.6%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 423 (43.0%) people were employed full-time, 162 (16.5%) were part-time, and 54 (5.5%) were unemployed.

==Community==

As with most other towns, Runanga had its fair share of clubs and societies. One such organisation that no longer exists in Runanga, and which few may remember, is the Runanga Lodge No 74 of the Royal Antedilluvian Order of Buffaloe&#x27;s. This Lodge was opened on May 13, 1939, by the Provincial Grand Primo Bro. James Insull K.O.M. The founders of the lodge were Bro. C Ingram C.P. and Bro. T Durkin C.P.

The Foundation members were R McMillan, H Fisher, J Musgrove, J O&#x27;Connel, W.T. Foster, F Crange, R McTaggart, Owen O&#x27;Connell, G.W. Timlin, A.W. Fisher, W Amor, J Stephens, D Butler, S H Werner, J O&#x27;Neil and R Scott.

In April 1943, The Lodge held their first meeting in their own Hall. They had been meeting in rented accommodation up until then.

== Miners&#x27; Hall ==

The Runanga Miners&#x27; Hall is registered by Heritage New Zealand as a Category I structure, with registration number 9613. It is significant because of its place in the history of the union movement in New Zealand and because it is one of the few remaining examples of a miners&#x27; hall. A $1.1 million project to strengthen the Miner&#x27;s Hall was announced in 2020.

== Coal Creek Waterfall ==

The Coal Creek waterfall is accessed via the Coal Creek walking track which starts in Runanga. The track is a gentle 3.6 kilometres return and travels along Coal Creek through beech trees and other podocarps. The waterfalls are the width of the river and seven metres high.

==Notable people==

<doc id="1038061" wikidata="Q4935658" url="?curid=1038061" title="Bobby Van">
<text>Robert Jack Stein (December 6, 1928 – July 31, 1980), known by his legalized stage name Bobby Van, was a musical actor and dancer, best known for his career on Broadway, in films and television from the 1950s through the 1970s. He was also a game show host and panelist.

==Early life==
Van was born to Jewish vaudeville parents in The Bronx, New York City, and grew up , witnessing many memorable Depression-era acts. Originally, Van took &quot;King&quot; as his stage name (after his father&#x27;s stage name, from the trio &quot;Gordon, Reed and King&quot;). He finally opted for &quot;Van&quot;, after seeing a Van Johnson poster hanging in his sister&#x27;s bedroom. In a 1976 interview, Van said he had legalized his name change from &#x27;Stein&#x27;.

==Career==
Van began his career as a musician, playing trumpet. When his band played a venue in the Catskills, Van was asked to fill in as a song and dance man for another act. His act drew rave reviews and gave Van a thrill performing live as a solo act. He went on to appear in several Broadway musicals.

In the early 1950s, Van received a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and made several films there, including the title role in &quot;The Affairs of Dobie Gillis&quot; in 1953 and roles in the musicals &quot;Because You&#x27;re Mine&quot; and &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot;. In 2010, reviewer Hal Erickson noted that &quot;Van will always be remembered as the ecstatic young fellow who made like a human pogo stick during an expansive production number in &quot;Small Town Girl&quot; (1953).&quot;

In the 1960s, Van did comedy work with Mickey Rooney in films and television. He appeared in three episodes of Rooney&#x27;s &quot;Mickey&quot; sitcom on ABC in the role of a freeloading brother-in-law. He also did some choreography, as had his father years earlier.

Van frequently appeared with his second wife, Elaine Joyce, on 1970s game shows such as &quot;Tattletales&quot; and &quot;Match Game&quot;. Van also hosted the game shows &quot;Showoffs&quot;,&quot; The Fun Factory&quot;, and &quot;Make Me Laugh&quot;.

Van starred in the 1971 Broadway revival of &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot;, for which he was nominated for a Tony Award. In 1973 he appeared in the musical remake of &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;, the last occasion on which he took his traditional song-and-dance persona to the big screen. His novelty dance number from &quot;Small Town Girl&quot; (1953) was featured in &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment, Part II&quot; (1976). In 1978, he played swindler Warren Custer in the episode &quot;The Two-Million-Dollar Stowaway&quot; of the NBC crime drama series &quot;The Eddie Capra Mysteries&quot;. In 1979, he appeared in the original &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; episode &quot;Greetings from Earth&quot; as the robot Hector, working alongside veteran song and dance man Ray Bolger (Vector). Van also hosted a syndicated revival of the game show &quot;Make Me Laugh&quot; during the 1979–80 season.

In June 1977, Van appeared in the musical &quot;Anything Goes&quot; as Billy Crocker at the Kenley Players in Dayton, Ohio.

In August 1979, Van appeared in the musical &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; as Young Joe with the San Jose Civic Light Opera in San Jose, California. His co-star was Van Johnson. Bobby Van and wife Elaine Joyce appeared in &quot;Love Boat&quot; S2 E16 &quot;Gopher&#x27;s Opportunity&quot;, as Phil and Melody Livingston, hoteliers who want to hire Gopher. The episode aired originally on January 20, 1979.

==Personal life==
A Democrat, Van supported Adlai Stevenson during the 1952 presidential election.

Van married starlet Diane Garrett in September 1952, though the marriage was kept secret until January 1953.

Van and Garrett attempted to have children for several years and, after losing a baby in 1956, they adopted a son in 1961 named Peter, nine months after taking him in as a five-day-old baby.

In 1959, both Van and Garrett were injured when their car was rear-ended, and sued the other driver, seeking $107,000. Garrett said she was unable to move for three weeks after the accident; both she and Van claimed back injury. Van was awarded $1,500 and Garrett was awarded $5,000. Judy Garland, who was a passenger in the Vans&#x27; vehicle, testified in court for them.

The couple separated in January 1964 and a divorce was final on September 27, 1966, despite rumors of an early reconsideration and a reconciliation in July 1964. Van had returned to town as his son was undergoing emergency hip surgery, not to reconcile. In November 1964, Walter Winchell wrote in his column that Van &quot;(recently divorced after a dozen years) hopes to persuade actress Emmaline Henry to be his new spouse.&quot;

Van married Broadway actress Elaine Joyce in 1968. Their marriage reportedly ran a difficult course – an announcement was made on October 30, 1967, that they had wed, but they had not. In November, a blurb in a Hollywood column said that Van said he and Joyce planned to marry on December 2, 1967, but her brother, Frank Pinchot, had chosen that date to get married, so they would choose another date. In February 1968, it was announced they would marry in Los Angeles on March 21. Van and Joyce were finally married in Las Vegas on May 1, 1968. One week later, Van filed for an annulment citing &quot;fraud&quot; and non-consummation, and that the actress &quot;told him she wanted to have children but this was only to induce him into marriage&quot;. An article states that Bobby said that Elaine felt &quot;so unhappy and insecure, it&#x27;s the only thing to do.&quot; A preliminary divorce was filed in 1968 for Elaine Joyce and Bobby Van; Joyce is listed as Elaine J Pinchot, year of birth 1945. The divorce was never finalized, and the couple remained married until Van&#x27;s death in 1980. Their daughter, Taylor, was born in 1976.

==Illness and death==
In February 1980, Van began to get headaches that continued for two weeks. On going to the hospital, an angiogram was done and his doctors were not optimistic, finding the pressure in his head was due to a malignant brain tumor. Van chose to hide his illness and continued to work as long as possible, including as host of that year&#x27;s Mrs. America Pageant. He later lost control of his left side and was in a wheelchair. After a nearly six-month battle with cancer, Van died in Los Angeles on July 31, 1980. He is interred at Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery, a Jewish cemetery in Los Angeles. In a December 1981 interview, Joyce said, &quot;Bobby and I would have been married forever. There was no question about it&quot;.

The Vans&#x27; daughter Taylor attended Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles, where she met future husband Evan Meyer. They were married in October 2003, at which time she was employed as a television executive assistant for Paramount Pictures.

<doc id="1038065" wikidata="Q5383901" url="?curid=1038065" title="Epping railway station, Sydney">
<text>Epping railway station is a heritage-listed railway station in Epping, in the northern region of Sydney. It is served by Sydney Trains&#x27; T9 Northern Line, NSW TrainLink&#x27;s Central Coast &amp; Newcastle Line, and Sydney Metro&#x27;s North West &amp; Bankstown Line services.

==History==
The station opened as Field of Mars on 17 September 1886. It was renamed Carlingford on 5 April 1887, and again to Epping on 7 October 1899 when it moved to its current site.

After much campaigning from locals, a wooden overhead booking office was constructed along with an additional island platform in 1928, The centre track was originally a terminating road, and was served by platforms on each side. This was intended as part of John Bradfield&#x27;s proposed Epping to St Leonards line. A new booking office on the footbridge was added in 1967 after the 1928 wooden structure was destroyed by fire.

In the mid 1980s, the concourse was extended with more shade provided over platforms as well as the addition of two clock towers.

In 1979, the centre terminating track was converted to a bi-directional main line with the platform face on the eastern side fenced off. As part of the 2000s upgrading works, the fencing was switched to the opposite platform.

The station received lifts in the 1990s in order to make the station wheelchair accessible.

Upgrade works began in 2004 to prepare the station for the Epping to Chatswood rail link. Works included a new concourse and pedestrian overpass, wider platforms, an underground transfer concourse and the addition of two underground platforms (5 &amp; 6) for the new line. The new aerial concourse was constructed to the north of the 1967 concourse, which was demolished. The above ground upgrades were completed on 14 April 2007, while the underground concourse and platforms were opened on 23 February 2009 in conjunction with the new line.

To the north of the station, an additional track was laid as part of the Northern Sydney Freight Corridor project opening in June 2016. The new track opened on 14 June 2016.

In September 2018, the Epping to Chatswood rail link (ECRL), the underground concourse and platforms 5 &amp; 6 were closed and upgraded to metro standards, including fitting the underground platforms with platform screen doors, as part of the Sydney Metro Northwest project. As a result, the Northern line reverted to operating from Hornsby to Central via Strathfield, and was later designated its own route T9 in April 2019. On 26 May 2019, the underground concourse and platforms reopened and serviced the new Metro North West Line, operating between Chatswood and Tallawong. The tunnels from the ECRL to the surface was kept, however the track for the Up line was lifted. The track for the down line was kept in case access to the Sydney Metro tunnels was required by maintenance vehicles. However, this access has never been used, with the points clipped and several stop blocks (a piece of wood bolted across the rails) and buffer stops in the way.

===Signal box===
Epping signal box opened on 31 October 1928 and operated the interlocking at Epping until its closure on 12 November 2006. The original miniature lever frame was replaced by an NX panel circa 1980. Control of the area was transferred to Strathfield signal box, and then to the new Homebush Control Centre in October 2008. The signal box remained derelict and unused until its demolition in 2010. In 2019, control of the area was passed to the Rail Operations Centre in Alexandria.

==Services==
Epping station is served by bus routes operated by Busways and CDC NSW, and one NightRide route.

<doc id="1038072" wikidata="Q1204264" url="?curid=1038072" title="Hijiki">
<text>(&quot;Sargassum fusiforme&quot;, syn. &quot;Hizikia fusiformis&quot;), sometimes called hiziki, is a brown sea vegetable that grows wild on the rocky coastlines of East Asia.

Hijiki has been a part of the Japanese culinary sphere and diet for centuries. Hijiki has been sold in United Kingdom natural products stores for 30 years and its culinary uses have been adopted in North America.

Recent studies have shown that hijiki contains potentially toxic quantities of inorganic arsenic, and the food safety agencies of several countries (excluding Japan), including Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, have advised against its consumption.

==In the West==
In 1867 the word &quot;hijiki&quot; first appeared in an English-language publication: &quot;A Japanese and English Dictionary&quot; by James C. Hepburn.

Starting in the 1960s, the word &quot;hijiki&quot; started to be used widely in the United States, and the product (imported in dried form from Japan) became widely available at natural food stores and Asian-American grocery stores, due to the influence of the macrobiotic movement, and in the 1970s with the growing number of Japanese restaurants.

==Appearance and preparation==
Hijiki is green to brown in colour when found in the wild. Fishermen and professional divers harvest the hijiki with a sickle at low tide during the spring tide from May to March. After collection, the seaweed is boiled and dried before being sold as dried hijiki. Once processed, dried hijiki turns black. To prepare dried hijiki for cooking, it is first soaked in water then cooked with ingredients like soy sauce and sugar to make a dish that goes by the same name.

In Japan, hijiki is normally eaten with other foods such as vegetables or fish. It may be added to foods that have been steamed, boiled, marinated in soy sauce or fish sauce, cooked in oil, or added to soup, stir fries or quiches. Hijiki may be mixed with rice, but not used as a wrap, to prepare sushi. Konjac is typically prepared with hijiki mixed in to give the dish known by the same name its characteristic grey color and texture.

In Korea, the seaweed is called &quot;tot&quot; () and eaten as &quot;namul&quot; (seasoned vegetable side dish) or cooked with &quot;bap&quot; (rice).

==Arsenic health risk==
Several government food safety agencies advise consumers to avoid consumption of hijiki seaweed. Testing showed that it contains significantly higher concentrations of inorganic arsenic than other types of seaweed, and these results have been independently verified. Government food safety agencies that advise against consumption include the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), the Food Standards Agency (FSA) of the United Kingdom, and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).

The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan responded with a report pointing out that while the consumption of more than 4.7 g hijiki seaweed per day could result in an intake of inorganic arsenic that exceeds the tolerable daily intake for this substance, the average daily consumption for Japanese people is estimated at 0.9 g. Several of the reports from other food safety agencies acknowledged that occasional hijiki consumption was unlikely to cause significant health risks but advised against all consumption regardless.

Although no known illnesses have been associated with consuming hijiki seaweed to date, inorganic arsenic has been identified as carcinogenic to humans. Exposure to inorganic arsenic has been linked with gastrointestinal effects, anemia, and liver damage. People who follow a macrobiotic diet that often includes large amounts of seaweed may be at greater risk.

<doc id="1038073" wikidata="Q3849604" url="?curid=1038073" title="Conference House">
<text>Conference House (also known as Billop House) is a stone house in the Tottenville neighborhood of Staten Island in New York City. Built by Captain Christopher Billopp some time before 1680, it is located in Conference House Park near Ward&#x27;s Point, the southernmost tip of New York state, which became known as &quot;Billop&#x27;s Point&quot; in the 18th century.

The Staten Island Peace Conference, an unsuccessful attempt to find a swift negotiated end to the American Revolutionary War, was hosted there by his heir and grandson, Colonel Christopher Billop, on September 11, 1776. The house, a National and New York City Landmark, is located at Conference House Park overlooking Raritan Bay. The house is also located within the Ward&#x27;s Point Conservation Area, separately added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

==Construction==
Captain Christopher Billopp, after years of distinguished service in the Royal Navy, came to America in 1674. He was granted a land patent on 932 acres (3.7 km2) on the southernmost tip of Staten Island. Archaeological evidence, including shell middens and digs conducted by The American Museum of Natural History in 1895, have shown that the Raritan band of the Lenape camped in the area and used the location as a burial ground. Known as Burial Ridge, it is the largest pre-European site in New York City.

Legend holds that sovereignty of Staten Island was determined by Capt. Billopp&#x27;s skill in circling it in one day, earning it for New York rather than to New Jersey. This has since been disproven and is in fact a myth. 

In 1677, the fortunes of colonial service took Capt. Billopp to New Castle on the Delaware River, where he commanded the local garrison. Upon appointment of Thomas Dongan as governor of the colony of New York, he returned to Staten Island and became active in the local government. He was further rewarded by another patent, expanding his Staten Island property to 1,600 acres (6.4 km2).

It is difficult to ascertain exactly when his manor house was built, but one surviving map shows that a building existed on the site of the Conference House before 1680. The house was passed down to his great grandson Christopher Billop, who was commissioned a colonel and led Loyalist forces against the Colonials in the American Revolution.

== American Revolution ==
=== Peace conference ===
On September 11, 1776, British loyalist Colonel Christopher Billop, commander of a Tory regiment in the conflict, hosted an informal diplomatic conference aimed at finding an early end to the nascent American Revolution. Lord Howe, commander in chief of British forces in America, arranged to meet with representatives of the Continental Congress in what is known today as the Staten Island Peace Conference. Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and Edward Rutledge rowed over from patriot-held Perth Amboy, New Jersey. The meeting lasted for three hours and ended with the Americans politely declining the diplomatically handcuffed Howe&#x27;s offer, leading to another seven years of conflict.

=== Billop&#x27;s Point ===
Conference House is situated on the southernmost point of New York State, at what was originally known as &quot;Billop&#x27;s Point&quot;, today&#x27;s Ward&#x27;s Point. It was from this site, where the mouth of Arthur Kill juts out into Raritan Bay, that a raid on October 25, 1779, known as &quot;Simcoe&#x27;s Raid&quot;, was conducted upon patriot-held New Jersey by John Graves Simcoe, leader of the Tory unit the Queen&#x27;s Rangers. In &quot;A History Of The Operations Of A Partisan Corps Called The Queen&#x27;s Rangers&quot;, which he wrote after the war, he mentions:

&quot;The batteaux, and boats, which were appointed to be at Billop&#x27;s-point, so as to pass the whole over by twelve o&#x27;clock at night, did not arrive till three o&#x27;clock in the morning.&quot;

Billop&#x27;s point is mentioned in the journal of Major André:

Oct. 25 &quot;The Regiments at Amboy received Orders to strike their tents and send them with their baggage to the water&#x27;s side. Those at Staten Island had orders to leave theirs standing, and repair by 8 o&#x27;clock in the evening to Billop&#x27;s Point.&quot;

===Confiscation===
After the cessation of hostilities and British withdrawal from the former colonies the house was confiscated by the state of New York with no recompense to the Billop family. However, many who suffered confiscation, particularly those who were regarded as most notorious by the rebels, later received some form of compensation from the British government.

== Conservation ==
After the revolution, most of the Billops went to Canada. One hundred years after the conference the house was used as a hotel, and a rat poison factory, before subsequently being abandoned and vandalized. In 1901 Assemblyman Van Name of Richmond County, New York, introduced a bill to acquire the house and mark it for historic preservation. However, the house was not immediately recognized for preservation.

The city finally acquired the house in 1926, at which point it was in danger of being razed. Conference House Park was created the same year. A nonprofit organization, the Conference House Association, was formed; in 1929, the Municipal Assembly of the City of New York placed the house under the association&#x27;s aegis. The association subsequently restored the house in a series of small projects, which included building a new roof as well as stairs from the first floor to the basement, painting the facade, and restoring the old well. The second floor was then restored, and a floor in the attic was created. The project was completed in 1937, and the house was dedicated on May 15, 1937. The house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1966.

<doc id="1038077" wikidata="Q468052" url="?curid=1038077" title="Amerika (miniseries)">
<text>Amerika is an American television miniseries that was broadcast in 1987 on ABC. The miniseries inspired a novelization entitled &quot;Amerika: The Triumph of the American Spirit&quot;. &quot;Amerika&quot; starred Kris Kristofferson, Mariel Hemingway, Sam Neill, Robert Urich, Christine Lahti, and a 17-year-old Lara Flynn Boyle in her first major role. &quot;Amerika&quot; was about life in the United States after a bloodless takeover engineered by the Soviet Union. Not wanting to depict the actual takeover, ABC Entertainment president, Brandon Stoddard, set the miniseries ten years after the event, focusing on the demoralized U.S. people a decade after the Soviet conquest. The intent, he later explained, was to explore the U.S. spirit under such conditions, not to portray the conflict of the Soviet coup.

Described in promotional materials as &quot;the most ambitious American miniseries ever created&quot;, &quot;Amerika&quot; aired for hours (including commercials) over seven nights (beginning February 15, 1987), and reportedly cost $40 million to produce. The miniseries was filmed in Ontario, Canada, in the Golden Horseshoe and southwestern Ontario cities of Toronto, London, and Hamilton, as well as various locations in Nebraska – most notably the small town of Tecumseh, which served as &quot;Milford&quot;, the fictional setting for most of the series. Donald Wrye was the executive producer, director, and writer of &quot;Amerika&quot;, while composer Basil Poledouris scored the miniseries, ultimately recording (with the Hollywood Symphony Orchestra) eight hours of music – the equivalent of four feature films.

==Genesis==
&quot;Amerika&quot; has an indirect connection to another notable ABC program, the 1983 television film &quot;The Day After&quot;, which some critics felt was too pacifist for portraying the doctrine of nuclear deterrence as pointless. Stoddard cited a column in the &quot;Los Angeles Herald-Examiner&quot; by Nixon speechwriter (and later, television personality) Ben Stein that appeared a few weeks before &quot;The Day After&quot; aired. Stein wrote, in part:

Stoddard acknowledged that Stein&#x27;s remarks provided the inspiration for the series. Stein received a quitclaim fee for the idea and otherwise was not involved in the production of &quot;Amerika&quot;. Originally envisioned as a four-hour made-for-TV movie entitled &quot;Topeka, Kansas, U.S.S.R.&quot;, the project soon was expanded into a miniseries.

== Plot ==


=== Major characters ===
The storyline of &quot;Amerika&quot; primarily follows three political leaders:
*Devin Milford (played by Kris Kristofferson): a maverick politician before the Soviet occupation who ran for president in 1988 (in the novel, 1992), after the Soviet takeover began. Milford was placed in a prison camp for daring to speak the truth about the Soviet conquest; at the beginning of the miniseries, Devin is declared &quot;rehabilitated&quot; and released back into society into the custody of his father, who lives in the Nebraska county run by Peter Bradford.
*Colonel Andrei Denisov of the KGB (played by Sam Neill): the Soviet administrator for the American Central Administrative Area. He is romantically involved with actress Kimberly Ballard (played by Mariel Hemingway). Andrei&#x27;s superior and mentor is General Petya Samanov (played by Armin Mueller-Stahl), the Soviet military leader who has been in charge of Soviet occupation of the United States for the past ten years.
*Peter Bradford (played by Robert Urich): a county administrator in Nebraska who cooperates with the Soviets to create a better life for his community. He attracts the attention of the Soviet leadership because, while cooperative, he is independent and respected by his constituents. At the series&#x27; climax, the Soviets carve a new country called &quot;Heartland&quot; out of the Midwest, with Bradford as its &quot;governor-general&quot;.

Major female characters, in addition to Ballard, include Peter Bradford&#x27;s wife, Amanda (played by Cindy Pickett), Devin Milford&#x27;s ex-wife, Marion (played by Wendy Hughes), and most notably, Devin&#x27;s sister Alethea (played by Christine Lahti), who at the outset is prostituting herself to the local occupation leader. &quot;Alethea is the center&quot;. noted Donald Wrye. &quot;She is a metaphor for America – not just phonically – and it is she who discovers her moral core through(out) the course of the series.&quot; Lara Flynn Boyle played Bradford&#x27;s teenage daughter, Jackie.

The human drama of these characters intersects with the political intrigue of the Soviet plans for the breakup of the United States. Bradford, the pragmatist, clashes with Milford, the idealist; Bradford&#x27;s wife is Milford&#x27;s ex-girlfriend, who finds she still has feelings for Milford upon his release from the prison camp; Denisov appoints Milford&#x27;s ex-wife, a powerful magistrate (and General Samanov&#x27;s mistress), to serve as Bradford&#x27;s deputy and assistant in Heartland; and Kimberly&#x27;s renewed sense of U.S. pride ultimately affects her relationship with Denisov.

=== Backstory ===
Towards the end of the 1980s, as the decline of the Soviet Union puts it in danger of losing the Cold War, the Soviet leadership makes a desperate gamble to rearrange the global balance of power. Four large thermonuclear weapons are detonated in the ionosphere over the United States. The resulting electromagnetic pulse (or EMP) destroys the nation&#x27;s communications and computer systems, cripples the U.S. electrical grid, and affects any equipment that relies on computer technology, such as most late-model automobiles. With its ICBMs inoperative—and the National Command Authority unable to contact U.S. military forces abroad or their foreign allies in western Europe to launch a counterattack—the U.S. is forced to accept Soviet terms for surrender: unilateral disarmament, the end of the dollar as a reserve currency, and integration into the Soviet military/economic bloc. The United States quickly falls under Soviet military occupation under the command of Russian General Petya Samanov, with the President and Congress becoming mere figureheads for their Soviet overseers. Communications between the administrative areas have been cut off, and the damage to the electrical grid caused by the EMP attack has never been fully repaired.

The above events are implied in the miniseries, although never directly explained. The description is taken from the novelization of the miniseries, &quot;Amerika: The Triumph of the American Spirit&quot; by Brauna E. Pouns and Donald Wrye (Pocket Books, 1987), based on Wrye&#x27;s screenplay.

=== Geopolitical situation ===
In 1997, a decade after its defeat, the contiguous United States is occupied by a United Nations peacekeeping force, the United Nations Special Service Unit (UNSSU), composed primarily of Eastern Bloc forces. The UNSSU garrison in Milford is under a command of an officer from East Germany, Major Helmut Gurtman (played by Reiner Schöne). UNSSU troops periodically engage in destructive combined arms training exercises which are deliberately intimidating to the local population.

Those Americans who engage in dissent are stripped of their privileges and sent to exile camps, where they are anathema to the Soviets and their fellow citizens. Association and communication with the exiles is forbidden, although some risk their own remaining freedoms by offering humanitarian aid. Production quotas have been imposed, and foodstuffs rationed, with the surplus being shipped to the Soviet Union.

Against this background, Bradford ascends to the leadership as governor-general of Heartland. He acts the part of a collaborator, hoping to reform the Soviet occupation from within with ideals of the old United States. Milford is released from the prison camp, hoping to be reunited with his children and fight to end the occupation and restore the United States. Denisov hopes to &quot;salvage as much as possible&quot; of the old U.S., while realizing that the U.S. essentially must cease to exist as a nation in order to appease the Soviet Union&#x27;s leadership.

=== Climax and resolution ===
The Soviet leaders of the occupation are faced with the dual problem of keeping the U.S. pacified and convincing the Politburo that their fears of a revitalized U.S. are unfounded because the country can no longer pose a threat. The Politburo is not convinced, and considers exploding nuclear weapons on the American capital of Washington, D.C. and also over several unnamed U.S. cities as a warning to the subjugated Americans and to the world. Samanov and Andrei Denisov, both of whom want Soviet control of the United States to be relatively humane, are horrified by this idea.

At great personal risk, Petya Samanov convinces the Soviet leadership in the Kremlin in Moscow to accept an agreeable compromise plan. The United States will be divided into &quot;satellite states&quot; such as Heartland; the Politboro accepts the plan on the condition that the members of both the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate will be summarily executed, without the possibility of a trial taking place in Washington similar to the Nuremberg trials that took place decades earlier long before the Soviet occupation of the former United States at the end of World War II. Either by a court of law or by a Soviet military tribunal being appointed by the Central Committee in Moscow making a strenuous journey to travel to the former U.S. capital city to preside over such a trial. It is mostly due to their fears that Congress has been galvanizing the American people to rise against their Soviet overlords. Under strict instructions to Samanov by Moscow, the planned operation will only be carried out if the United States Congress refuses to agree to dissolve the nation&#x27;s government, disperse, and go home in peace. If they comply, the lives of both chambers of Congress will be spared. 

After the vice president, the speaker of the House of Representatives and both members of the House and Senate of Congress gather in the House of Representatives chamber, Samanov arrives at the United States Capitol Building with his senior Soviet ranking officers, Soviet military aides, and members of his military staff, along with members of the KGB who secretly surround and enter the building. He then addresses the assembled Congress and asks them to disband their legislative body in a peacefully and orderly manner, dissolve the United States government, and relinquish their power and authority to the Soviet occupied administrative areas; the members angrily refuse to do so with and through united resistance. After seeing their true colors, Samanov becomes angry and agitated by their refusal and he abruptly walks out of the House of Representatives chamber. Shortly afterwards, the House of Representatives chamber’s doors are locked and, with no way of escape for the legislators, his men from the KGB begin firing into the entire crowd of legislators within the gallery. All members of both chambers of Congress are killed in the attack, along with the speaker of the House of Representatives, the vice president, and presumably the president pro tempore of the United States Senate. Fearing the symbolic artwork in the rotunda will inspire future Americans to rise up and take up arms in the future against the Soviet occupation of the former United States, Samanov’s men are also instructed by him and his superiors in Moscow to destroy the paintings, the sculptures, and other works of art of American history and culture in the rotunda of the Capitol Building. They do so by dumping sulphuric acid, gasoline, and inflammable liquid substances all over it. The whole inside of the rotunda is set ablaze, with eventually the whole building being engulfed by the fire and the ceiling and top of the rotunda was destroyed by the Soviet military made explosives. After the act is carried out, Samanov surveys the damage and all of the dead bodies of all the members of Congress. He then sits in the House of Representatives chamber that was spared by the fire and commits suicide. Hours later, all that is left of the Capitol Building is ash and charred ruins. What happened to the President of the United States, all of the nine justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the others in the presidential line of succession remains unknown. 

In the final episode of the miniseries, Heartland has seceded from the United States, with other regions to follow within the next few weeks. Instead, Heartland soldiers and local militia attack the local UNSSU compound. There is talk of a &quot;Second American Revolution&quot; that could undermine the Soviet Union&#x27;s plans to break up the United States and end the Soviet occupation of America itself. The miniseries ends on a downbeat note, Devin Milford is shown about to make a nationwide speech telling Americans to revolt against the Soviet occupation, however, Milford is shot to death. It is unclear if he managed to make a nationwide broadcast calling on Americans to resist the breakup of the United States, but based on the ending, it appears that the United States of America will cease to exist forever as a nation and will be broken up into several independent countries within North America. At least for now. With the suspicion from Denisov himself the hope of a Second American Revolutionary War that could restore American independence and drive the Soviets along with their military, air, and naval forces from the shores of the former United States in the future now lies in the hands of a fourteen old boy. Devin Milford’s eldest son William Milford, when one day he comes of age.

=== The Divided States of America ===
In this fictional timeline, the U.S. Congress divided the United States into multiple Soviet occupied &quot;administrative areas&quot; in 1988, one year after the communist takeover. These areas are intended to become polities modeled on the Soviet republics, joined together in a new North American Union. A map shown on screen reveals these administrative areas to be:

*California Special District: California, Nevada
*Western Semi-Autonomous: Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Utah, Wyoming
*Northwest: Oregon, Washington
*Southwest: Arizona, New Mexico
*North Central: Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
*Central: Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska (this is Peter Bradford&#x27;s administrative area, and the territory which eventually becomes Heartland, with Omaha, Nebraska, as its capital)
*South Central: Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas
*Southern: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi
*Mid-Atlantic: Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia
*Appalachia: Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia
*Ameritech: Indiana, the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania (presumably named after the phone company that serviced these areas)
*Northeastern: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont

In addition to these areas, Washington, D.C. comprises its own National Administrative District, South Florida is described by a character as the &quot;Space Zone&quot;, and there is a passing reference to three &quot;International Cities&quot;, one of which is San Francisco. Michigan is separated into two administrative regions, with the Lower Peninsula belonging to Ameritech, and the Upper Peninsula belonging to the North Central region. Alaska is described as never having been pacified, requiring continued engagement by Soviet troops, and there are pockets of armed resistance in the Rocky Mountains and in West Virginia. There is no mention of what has happened to Hawaii, or to U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico, Guam, and American Samoa (even though Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands may have presumably been taken over by the &quot;Greater Cuba&quot;, led by Fidel Castro).

The Rust Belt (presumably &quot;Ameritech&quot;) faces its own special problems. Most of its advanced factory equipment was removed at the start of the occupation and taken to the Soviet Union. The region suffers 50% unemployment as a result, and its residents are not permitted to leave, except to volunteer for factory work in the Soviet Union, from which no one has yet returned.

Travel and communications between the various zones is heavily restricted, part of the &quot;divide and conquer&quot; plan of the Soviet occupation.

=== Communist occupation elsewhere ===
Both the novel and miniseries imply that the Soviet Union has conquered other countries after the U.S. coup (it can be surmised, for example, that the EMP which disabled U.S. technology also would have crippled Canada and Mexico, a minor character says that he and his wife fled East Germany for the United States and remarked that &quot;the promised land [had] become worse than what [they] left&quot;, and Denisov says at one point that &quot;we control most of the world&quot;).

In this new world, Fidel Castro heads what is now called &quot;Greater Cuba&quot;, embracing most of the Caribbean and Latin America, and Taiwan has been absorbed into China. North Korea has conquered South Korea and Korea is united under communist rule. A politician named &quot;Mbele&quot; heads the &quot;Socialist Republic of Southern Africa&quot; which also includes South Africa, &quot;Barghout&quot; is the leader of &quot;Iraqistan&quot; which includes present-day Israel (and Palestine) and all of the Arab world in both the Middle East and North Africa. Eastern Europe is in a state of unrest, echoing the turmoil in the former United States. The Soviet leader mentions being stationed in England before being posted in America, implying that Western Europe is also under Soviet control, much like America.

=== National symbols ===
The flag of the occupation is the pale blue United Nations flag, with crossed U.S. and Soviet flags superimposed on the sides. The U.S. flag is shown without its stars, and this flag is displayed during the &quot;Lincoln Week&quot; ceremonies. The standard U.S. flag is outlawed, although one scene shows a group of war veterans marching with the old U.S. flag upside down, this being a distress signal. The U.S. national anthem, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, also is outlawed, but this does not stop a group of citizens from singing it (haltingly at first) after the &quot;Lincoln Week&quot; parade.

Abraham Lincoln is included with Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin in propaganda. One of the signature scenes in the film is a twenty-minute, dialogue-free depiction of the celebration of &quot;Lincoln Week&quot; (a holiday replacing the Fourth of July), with both Lincoln and Lenin displayed on red banners that were most likely intended to be striking and startling to television audiences of the time.

A new pledge of allegiance is given by &quot;rehabilitated&quot; political prisoners upon release from the U.S. gulags. While the prisoners are told that they are free to refuse to make this pledge, the circumstances under which it is administered suggest otherwise. The pledge states:

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Amerika&quot; received mixed reviews; the series created controversy with some. Certain critics and viewers felt it was too long and unrealistic, others argued that it would be damaging to Soviet-American relations, and a spokesperson for the United Nations objected to it being portrayed as an occupying force under Soviet control. Some conservatives felt that Soviet brutality was greatly underplayed; conversely, a number of liberals dismissed the entire miniseries as right-wing paranoia. At various points, the program was scrapped, delayed, and rewritten. Prior to the show&#x27;s airing, several left-wing magazines, including &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;The Progressive&quot;, &quot;Tikkun&quot; and &quot;Mother Jones&quot; carried articles strongly criticizing &quot;Amerika&quot;. The American Friends Service Committee also protested against &quot;Amerika&quot;. Journalist Christopher Hitchens, when encouraged by a caller on a February 1987 C-SPAN talk show to view the series, commented &quot;I bet you you don&#x27;t get through to the end of it. It&#x27;s a boring idiotic piece of nonsensical propaganda. No one will see it all... It&#x27;s tripe. It will be a terrific anticlimax. People are going to spend a lot of time not watching it and not talking about it.&quot; The automaker Chrysler dropped ads which were scheduled to air during the program.

For its part, the Soviet Union threatened to shut down the ABC News Moscow bureau, although this threat was not carried out and indeed seemed to strengthen ABC&#x27;s resolve regarding the miniseries. &quot;We&#x27;re going to run that program come rain, blood, or horse manure&quot;, said ABC President John B. Sias, after the yet-to-be-aired &quot;Amerika&quot; had generated more controversy and viewer response than any other ABC program in history, including &quot;The Day After&quot;. The Discovery Channel countered by running 66 hours of Soviet-produced television, some of it live, including news, music videos, and films.

&quot;Amerika&quot; was preceded by an ABC special addressing the considerable controversy prior to its airing (&quot;The Storm Over Amerika&quot;), and was followed by an &quot;ABC News Viewpoint&quot; panel discussion moderated by Ted Koppel, with Brandon Stoddard, Donald Wrye, and others addressing the issues along with questions and comments from a live studio audience in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

After seeing the first episode and reading the shooting script, Tom Engelhardt stated that &quot;Amerika&quot; had &quot;a plot line that makes suspension of disbelief into an act of grace.&quot; In its summary of the 1986–87 US television season, &quot;TV Guide&quot; called the miniseries &quot;arguably the most boring miniseries in a decade&quot;, adding that &quot;ABC&#x27;s &quot;Amerika&quot; tried to hold America hostage for seven tedious nights (and a stupefyingly dull hours) by conjuring up a fuzzy vision of a Communist occupation of the U.S.&quot;

=== Social criticism and commentary ===
Although it aired only two years before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, &quot;Amerika&quot; implied that American apathy and an unwillingness to defend freedom on the part of many citizens made the Soviet takeover rather easy. This depiction was objected to by those who saw it as needlessly provoking &quot;overt jingoism,&quot; while labeling the miniseries as &quot;a fourteen-hour public apology to the White House from ABC executives for provoking public concern with &quot;The Day After&quot;.&quot;

The miniseries&#x27; depiction of the takeover of the USA by a communist authority mirrored occurrences in Nicaragua, helping to spur organizations such as the Freedom Federation into launching its own media campaignalong with William F. Buckley of the &quot;National Review&quot; and the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;which used the film &quot;as a pretext to persuade the public that the United States needed to continue its support of right-wing governments in Central America by aiding the Contras.&quot;

=== Ratings ===
The first two nights of &quot;Amerika&quot; garnered big ratings, but audience numbers dropped thereafter, and the overall miniseries averaged a 19 rating and a 29 share of American television households, compared to a 46 rating/62 share for &quot;The Day After&quot;. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t as big a hit as its supporters had hoped&quot;, said Ted Koppel, &quot;but it wasn&#x27;t a disaster, either.&quot; &quot;Amerika&quot; was the second-highest rated miniseries of the 1986–87 U.S. television season.

Although a 35 share reportedly had been promised to advertisers, Stoddard was happy with the performance of &quot;Amerika&quot;, claiming that all or part of the miniseries had been watched by 100 million people – a ratings bonanza for ABC, then in third place among the three major networks.

== Availability ==
&quot;Amerika&quot; has not been shown on U.S. television since its original telecast on ABC. A VHS box set of the miniseries was released by Anchor Bay Entertainment in 1995, but no official DVD release is available. Portions of the soundtrack by Basil Poledouris were released on CD by Prometheus Records in 2004 (in a limited edition of 3,000 copies). The novelization is widely available from used-book sellers and online auction sites. The miniseries itself can be found pirated on YouTube.

==Parodies==
In February 1987, the miniseries was parodied on the NBC show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as &quot;Amerida&quot;, in which a debt-ridden United States is mortgaged to Canada and subsequently repossessed. It posited Wayne Gretzky as the prime minister of Amerida. The U.S. protagonist (played by Canadian actor Phil Hartman) longs for a country &quot;where you don&#x27;t have money that&#x27;s all the colours of the rainbow&quot; and &quot;you don&#x27;t have to punt on third down.&quot; To calm him down, his wife makes the offer of a beer: &quot;How about a Labatt&#x27;s, eh?&quot; The flag of Amerida was the U.S. flag with the stars replaced by a white maple leaf.

The satirical Canadian radio program &quot;Double Exposure&quot; parodied the series in a sketch called &quot;Kanada with a K&quot;, in which &quot;Joe Klark with a K&quot; rescues the nation from &quot;Comrade Ed&quot;.

<doc id="1038082" wikidata="Q3037476" url="?curid=1038082" title="Double Negative (artwork)">
<text>Double Negative is a piece of land art located in the Moapa Valley on Mormon Mesa (or Virgin River Mesa) near Overton, Nevada. &quot;Double Negative&quot; was created in 1969 by artist Michael Heizer, and consists of a trench dug into the earth.

==Description==
The work consists of a long trench in the earth, 30 feet (9 m) wide, deep, and 1500 feet (457 m) long, created by the displacement of 244,000 tons of rock, mostly rhyolite and sandstone. Two trenches straddle either side of a natural canyon (into which the excavated material was dumped). The &quot;negative&quot; in the title thus refers in part to both the natural and man-made negative space that constitutes the work. The work essentially consists of what is not there, what has been displaced.

Double Negative can be reached by following Mormon Mesa Road north-eastward from Overton to the top of the mesa, continuing across it for 2.7 miles, turning left at the opposite edge onto a smaller path that extends along the rim of the mesa, and then following the path north for 1.3 miles.

==History==
In 1969 the art dealer Virginia Dwan funded the purchase of the 60-acre site for &quot;Double Negative&quot; and, in turn, the artist transferred the property deeds to Dwan. In 1971 Heizer prevented the Dwan Gallery from selling the work. Dwan then donated &quot;Double Negative&quot; to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MoCA) in 1984, with Heizer’s blessing, to coincide with “In Context: Michael Heizer, Geometric Extraction”. Among the terms of the agreement with the museum is the fact that, according to the artist&#x27;s wishes, MoCA will undertake no conservation of the piece as Heizer indicated that nature should eventually reclaim the land through weather and erosion. Since then, Heizer has expressed a contrasting wish to restore the piece, perhaps in opposition to Robert Smithson&#x27;s support for the principle of entropy.

For the solo exhibition &quot;In Context: Michael Heizer, Geometric Extraction&quot;, MoCA was able to include a photographic panorama of Heizer’s work. For the large-scale, historical survey of land art “Ends of the Earth” at MoCA in 2012, Heizer did not want any representation of Double Negative to be included in the exhibition. A good aerial photograph appears in the catalogue, but Heizer reportedly worried that documentation in a museum gallery would misrepresent a sculpture that he felt could be known only through physical experience.

In 2021, plans for a solar development project near &quot;Double Negative&quot; were rejected due to resident protests against the project&#x27;s effect on the artwork. The work is currently owned by MoCA and is accessible by four-wheel drive vehicle or motorcycle.

<text>Barthélemy Louis Joseph Schérer (18 December 1747 – 19 August 1804), born in Delle, near Belfort, became a French general during the French Revolutionary Wars and on three occasions led armies in battle.

==Early career==
Schérer served in the Austrian army long before the Revolution, but defected to France in 1775. In 1780 Schérer became a major in an artillery regiment stationed in Strasbourg. He entered Dutch service in 1785 as a major in the &quot;Légion de Maillebois&quot;. In 1790 he was released from Dutch service with the rank of lieutenant colonel.

==French Revolution==
He returned to France in 1791 and in 1792 was made a captain in the 82nd Infantry Regiment, serving as aide-de-camp to General Jean de Prez de Crassier at the Battle of Valmy. In 1793 he served as a senior aide-de-camp to general Alexandre de Beauharnais on the Rhine. In 1794, Schérer was promoted to the rank of &quot;général de division&quot; and commanded a division in the Army of the Sambre and Meuse, serving with distinction at the Battle of Aldenhoven. On 3 May he married Marie Françoise Henriette Caroline Müller in a civil ceremony at Delle in the Franche-Comté. On 3 November 1794 he was named commander of the Army of Italy before his transfer to command the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees on 3 March 1795. On 14 June a 35,000-strong Spanish army defeated Schérer&#x27;s 25,000 men in battle at Bàscara in Catalonia province in Spain.

On 31 August 1795 he was again sent to Italy to replace François Kellerman (the older) as commander-in-chief of the Army of Italy. As commander of the Army of Italy, Schérer won the Battle of Loano (22–24 November 1795) against an Austrian army but failed to exploit his advantage due to his own caution and winter weather. He was relieved of the command of this army on 23 February 1796 and replaced by Napoleon Bonaparte. Schérer was then unemployed for a number of months until being named Inspector-General of Cavalry, first of the Army of the Interior and then of the Army of the Rhine and the Moselle.

==War of the Second Coalition==
Schérer served as French Minister of War from 22 July 1797 to 21 February 1799. When the War of the Second Coalition broke out, Schérer was given command of the Army of Italy once again. He won an initial clash at Pastrengo on 26 March. But he proved unable to stop the Russo-Austrian advance. He was defeated by Austrian General Pál Kray at the Battle of Magnano on 5 April. &quot;Schérer went into this battle without forming a reserve and was thus unable to react to crisis or opportunities effectively.&quot; Forced to retire behind the river Mincio, he then loses the important fortress of Brescia; he gave up command to Jean Moreau, prior to being defeated by the new coalition commander, Suvorov, in the Lecco engagement, which preceded the Battle of Cassano. Because of Schérer&#x27;s responsibility for the loss of Italian possessions, he was forced to appear before a committee of inquiry. After securing an acquittal, he retired to private life on his estate at Chauny in Picardy, where he died in 1804.

<text>James Esdras Faust (July 31, 1920 – August 10, 2007) was an American religious leader, lawyer, and politician. Faust was Second Counselor in the First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1995 until his death, an LDS Church apostle for 29 years, and a general authority of the church for 35 years.

==Early life==
Faust was born to George A. Faust and Amy Finlinson in Delta, Utah. As a child, he lived in this area. His family moved to the southern part of the Salt Lake Valley before he reached high school age. He attended Granite High School in Salt Lake City, where he won awards for track and a letter for football. He later attended the University of Utah, where he ran the 440-yard and mile relay. His college education was delayed twice. First, when he served as a missionary for the LDS Church in southern Brazil from 1939 to 1942. Then later when he served during World War II in the United States Army Air Corps where he was a First Lieutenant at the time of decommissioning.

On April 21, 1943, Faust married Ruth Wright, whom he had met at Granite High School. The wedding took place during a short leave during his military service, and they were sealed in the Salt Lake Temple.

==Career==
Faust graduated from the University of Utah in 1948 with a B.A. and Juris Doctor. After graduation, he worked in a law firm in Salt Lake City. 

In 1962, he was elected president of the Utah Bar Association, where he served for one year. The same association awarded him its Distinguished Lawyer Emeritus Award in 1996. During the 1960s, he was named to the Utah Legislative Study Committee and later to the Utah Constitutional Revision Commission.

Faust served in the House of Representatives for the 28th Utah State Legislature (1949) as a Democrat for Utah&#x27;s eighth district. He also served as chairman of the Utah State Democratic Party and helped manage a campaign for Senator Frank Moss. In 1996, Faust was awarded with the Minuteman Award by the Utah National Guard.

Faust was appointed by U.S. President John F. Kennedy to the Lawyer&#x27;s Committee for Civil Rights. He was also an advisor to the &quot;American Bar Journal&quot;.

In 1997, by legislative decree, Faust was made an honorary citizen of São Paulo, Brazil and received a national Brazilian citizenship award. &quot;James Esdras Faust Street&quot; in Campinas, Brazil was named in his honor by the city mayor in 2007.

==Church service==
In 1949, at the age of 28, Faust became a bishop in the LDS Church. He later served on a stake high council, as stake president, and a regional representative.

Faust was called as an Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on October 6, 1972 and served in that capacity until October 1, 1976. At that time, the position was eliminated and he entered the First Quorum of the Seventy. In 1975, he presided over the Brazil area of the church. During his tenure, the São Paulo Brazil Temple was announced.

Before the 1978 revelation reversing the priesthood ban for men of African descent, Faust was head of the church&#x27;s International Mission, with jurisdiction for Africa. Spencer W. Kimball privately consulted with Faust several times leading up to the change in policy.

Faust was accepted by common consent as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on September 30, 1978, and ordained an apostle on October 1, filling the vacancy created by the death of Delbert L. Stapley. Faust continued as president of the International Mission after his call as an apostle. In early 1979, Faust became the first LDS apostle to travel to Nigeria. He and his wife traveled with missionaries Rendell M. and Rachel Mabey and Edwin Q. and Janath R. Cannon to meet with LDS Church members in Aboh, not far from Enugu, and give them guidance in the formation of the church. During this visit, Faust baptized five Nigerian men in the same spot where Anthony Obinna and 18 others had been baptized near the end of 1978.

He served in the Quorum of the Twelve until being set apart as Second Counselor in the First Presidency to church president Gordon B. Hinckley on March 12, 1995. He remained in that position until his death on August 10, 2007. Faust, together with Hinckley and First Counselor Thomas S. Monson, constituted the longest continuous serving First Presidency in the history of the LDS Church.

==Family and death==
Faust and his wife, Ruth, raised five children: James Hamilton Faust, Janna R. Coombs, Marcus G. Faust, Lisa A. Smith, and Robert P. Faust. At the time of his death, they had 25 grandchildren and 28 great-grandchildren. He died on August 10, 2007, at his home in Salt Lake City, Utah, of causes incident to age. Following a funeral service in the Salt Lake Tabernacle, he was buried in the Holladay Memorial Park in Holladay, Utah. Ruth Wright Faust died February 10, 2008, at the age of 86.

<text>George Quayle Cannon (January 11, 1827 – April 12, 1901) was an early member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and served in the First Presidency under four successive presidents of the church: Brigham Young, John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, and Lorenzo Snow. He was the church&#x27;s chief political strategist, and was dubbed &quot;the Mormon premier&quot; and &quot;the Mormon Richelieu&quot; by the press. He was also a five-time Utah territorial delegate to the U.S. Congress.

==Early life==
Cannon was born in Liverpool, England, to George Cannon and Ann Quayle, the eldest of six children. His mother and father were from Peel on the Isle of Man. His father&#x27;s sister, Leonora Cannon, had married future Latter Day Saint apostle John Taylor and was baptized in 1836. News reached the elder George Cannon and four years later, when Taylor came to Liverpool, the entire Cannon family was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints; George Q. Cannon was 13 years old at the time. Cannon&#x27;s siblings were Mary Alice Cannon (Lambert), Ann Cannon (Woodbury), Angus M. Cannon, David H. Cannon, and Leonora Cannon (Gardner). In 1842, the Cannon family set sail for the United States to join with the church in Nauvoo, Illinois. On the voyage over the Atlantic Ocean, Cannon&#x27;s mother died. The motherless family arrived safely in Nauvoo in the spring of 1843. George Sr. married Mary Edwards in 1844 and had another daughter, Elizabeth Cannon (Piggott).

In Nauvoo, Cannon&#x27;s father sent him to live with his uncle and aunt, John and Leonora Taylor. Cannon worked in the printing office of the &quot;Times and Seasons&quot; and the &quot;Nauvoo Neighbor&quot; for Taylor, who was an editor of both periodicals. In June 1844, Taylor accompanied Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith, and Willard Richards and others to Carthage Jail. There, Joseph and Hyrum were killed, and Taylor sustained serious bullet wounds. Cannon tended the printing affairs while Taylor recovered. This training would serve him well in later life. Cannon&#x27;s father died in 1845.

In 1846, Taylor traveled to England to organize the affairs of the church after Smith&#x27;s death. Meanwhile, Cannon accompanied Taylor&#x27;s wife and family as they moved to Winter Quarters, Nebraska. When Taylor returned, Cannon traveled with the entire Taylor family to the Salt Lake Valley, arriving in October 1847.

==Church service==
In 1849, Cannon was asked by church president Brigham Young to serve as a missionary for the church in California. This assignment involved working the mines and attempting to preach the gospel to gold miners. After doing this for several months Cannon and several other mining missionaries were asked to head to the Kingdom of Hawaii, where he served for four years.

Initially the missionaries in Hawaii focused on teaching European and Euro-Americans in the islands. Cannon was the first missionary to focus on teaching natives on the island of Maui. While in the islands, Cannon taught and baptized many Native Hawaiians. He also organized multiple branches of the church and on occasions met with government ministers of the Kingdom of Hawaii to get the church recognition. One of the most notable was Jonatana Napela, who assisted Cannon in translating the Book of Mormon into Hawaiian. Joseph F. Smith, a future church president, would follow Cannon and serve in Hawaii one year later. Cannon eventually was made district president over multiple branches in Maui. By October 1852 there were slightly over 900 members of the LDS Church in Hawaii with most on the island of Maui.

Returning to Utah Territory, Cannon married Elizabeth Hoagland (daughter of Abraham Hoagland and his wife.) He was almost immediately called to assist apostle Parley P. Pratt in publishing a newspaper in California. Meeting Pratt in California, Cannon was told that he would remain behind and became president of the church&#x27;s Oregon and California Mission; he held this position from 1856 to 1858. During this period of time, Cannon published the Hawaiian translation of the Book of Mormon. In February 1856, he started the &quot;Western Standard&quot;, a weekly publication based in San Francisco.

Returning to Utah in 1857 to assist in the Utah War, Cannon was commissioned a Lieutenant General in the Nauvoo Legion. During this time, Cannon served as printer of the &quot;Deseret News&quot; while it was publishing in exile in Fillmore, Utah. After the Utah War, he was called as president of the church&#x27;s Eastern States Mission.

===Apostle===
The murder of Parley P. Pratt in 1857 created a vacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. That vacancy was not filled until Brigham Young called Cannon to the apostleship three years later. Cannon was ordained to the priesthood office of apostle on August 26, 1860, at age 33. Upon his joining the Quorum of the Twelve, Cannon was called to preside over the church&#x27;s European Mission.

Cannon&#x27;s mission in Europe ended when he was recalled by Young in 1862 to work in Washington, D.C., to assist in the church&#x27;s promotion of Utah Territory&#x27;s bid for statehood. At the adjournment of the 1862 congressional session, Cannon again left for Europe to preside over the mission. In this capacity, Cannon was the editor of the &quot;Millennial Star&quot; and, for a short time, the church&#x27;s Welsh-language periodical, &quot;Udgorn Seion&quot;.

From 1867 to 1874, Cannon was the managing editor of the &quot;Deseret News&quot;. It was under his direction that the newspaper was first published on a daily basis.

In 1866, Cannon began publication of a magazine for youth and young adult Latter-day Saints called &quot;The Juvenile Instructor&quot;. He owned and published this magazine until his death; in 1901 his family sold the magazine to the LDS Church&#x27;s Sunday School organization. The periodical was the official organ of the Sunday School until 1930, when it was replaced with &quot;The Instructor&quot;. Cannon also served as the first general superintendent of the church&#x27;s Sunday School from 1867 until his death.

===First Presidency===

On April 8, 1873, Cannon became a member of the church&#x27;s First Presidency when he was called as the first counselor by Brigham Young. Cannon went on to serve as counselor to three more presidents of the church: he was First Counselor to John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, and Lorenzo Snow.

Although Cannon was the second-most senior apostle of the church after the death of Woodruff, Cannon did not become President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, as would be the practice in the LDS Church today. Rather, because Cannon was a member of the First Presidency, the church simply appointed the next senior apostle of the church—Brigham Young Jr.—to be the quorum president. (Under today&#x27;s practices, Cannon would have been appointed the president of the quorum and Young would have been appointed acting president.)

==Political life and plural marriage==
Cannon was elected to be the non-voting delegate for Utah Territory in the United States Congress in 1872. He remained a congressional delegate until 1882, when his seat was declared vacant by the enactment of the Edmunds Act, which terminated many political and civil rights for Utah&#x27;s Mormon polygamists.

=== Dispute in the 47th Congress ===
By 1880, Cannon had served four terms in Congress as Utah territorial delegate.

The newly appointed anti-Mormon territorial governor, Eli Houston Murray, openly supported the Liberal Party, which generally opposed church candidates. The 1880 territory-wide election for a congressional delegate brought the Liberal Party unexpectedly close to sending a representative to Washington, DC. The Liberal candidate, Allen G. Campbell, with 1357 votes, lost resoundingly to Cannon, who had 18,567 votes. However, before Governor Murray certified the election, a protest on behalf of Campbell was filed. The protest listed a dozen claims, chiefly that Cannon, born in England, was not a naturalized citizen but an alien. The protest also claimed that Cannon&#x27;s participation in polygamy was incompatible with federal law and a delegate&#x27;s oath of office. Murray agreed and issued certification to Campbell, in spite of his poor showing.

Cannon, in Washington at the time, argued that only Congress could decide on a member&#x27;s qualifications. He furthermore received a certificate from sympathetic territorial election officials that stated he had received the most votes. That document convinced the House of Representatives clerk to enter Cannon&#x27;s name on the roll and so Cannon began drawing the delegate&#x27;s salary.

Both Murray and Campbell traveled to Washington to dispute the seat. Each side battled over the position for over a year, even after the assassination of President James Garfield. On February 25, 1882, the House of Representatives finally rejected both candidates. The House refused Cannon his seat on the basis of his involvement in polygamy. In the end, the House seated John T. Caine as the Delegate during the 47th Congress. Caine went on to serve for several years.

The issue brought unfavorable national attention to Utah, which contributed to the Edmunds Act being signed into law on March 23, 1882. The act reinforced the 1862 Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act by declaring polygamy a felony and also revoked polygamists&#x27; right to vote, made them ineligible for jury service, and prohibited them from holding political office.

=== Plural marriage ===

Cannon practiced plural marriage and was married to six women. Cannon frequently spoke in justification of the practice.

When the Supreme Court upheld the ban on plural marriage in the 1879 &quot;Reynolds v. United States&quot; decision, Cannon stated: 

Eventually, Cannon went &quot;underground&quot; with others in the church leadership as a fugitive from the federal authorities. In September 1888, Cannon surrendered himself and pleaded guilty at trial to charges of unlawful cohabitation under the Edmunds Act. As a result, Cannon served nearly six months in Utah&#x27;s federal penitentiary.

In the string of events preceding the announcement of Wilford Woodruff in September, 1890 that the church would not sanction additional polygamist marriages, Cannon&#x27;s son Frank shuttled communications relating to polygamy between the US Congress and his father.

Cannon was pardoned in 1894 by U.S. President Grover Cleveland.

==Death and descendants==
Cannon died on April 12, 1901, in Monterey, California, at 74 years of age. Had he lived a few months longer, he would have become the President of the LDS Church: Lorenzo Snow died on October 10 of that year. Cannon was buried in the Salt Lake City Cemetery.

Cannon fathered 33 children, some of whom are Abraham H. Cannon, John Q. Cannon, and Sylvester Q. Cannon, who all became general authorities of the LDS Church; Frank J. Cannon, Utah&#x27;s first U.S. Senator; and Lewis T. Cannon and Georgius Y. Cannon, prominent architects in Utah. Some of Cannon&#x27;s prominent descendants include Howard Cannon, U.S. Senator from Nevada from 1959 to 1983 and Chris Cannon, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1997 to 2009. Another descendant, George I. Cannon, became a general authority of the church.

At BYU football games, the BYU ROTC celebrates touchdowns with cannon named &quot;George Q&quot; to honor him.

<doc id="1038144" wikidata="Q13671" url="?curid=1038144" title="Tropical wave">
<text>A tropical wave (also called easterly wave, tropical easterly wave, and African easterly wave), in and around the Atlantic Ocean, is a type of atmospheric trough, an elongated area of relatively low air pressure, oriented north to south, which moves from east to west across the tropics, causing areas of cloudiness and thunderstorms. Tropical waves form in the easterly flow along the equatorial side of the subtropical ridge or belt of high air pressure which lies north and south of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Tropical waves are generally carried westward by the prevailing easterly winds along the tropics and subtropics near the equator. They can lead to the formation of tropical cyclones in the north Atlantic and northeastern Pacific basins. A tropical wave study is aided by Hovmöller diagrams, a graph of meteorological data.

West-moving waves can also form from the tail end of frontal zones in the subtropics and tropics, and may be referred to as easterly waves, but the waves are not properly called tropical waves. They are a form of inverted trough that shares many characteristics of a tropical wave.

==Characteristics==
A tropical wave normally follows an area of sinking, intensely dry air, blowing from the northeast. After the passage of the trough line, the wind veers southeast, the humidity abruptly rises, and the atmosphere destabilizes. This yields widespread showers and thunderstorms, sometimes severe. As the wave moves westward, the showers gradually diminish.

An exception to the association of convection can occur in the Atlantic. Sometimes, a surge of dry air called the Saharan Air Layer (SAL) follows a tropical wave, leaving cloudless skies, as convection is capped by the dry layer inversion. Additionally, any dust in the SAL reflects sunlight, cooling the air below it.

==Atlantic==

Tropical waves in the Atlantic basin develop from low-pressure disturbances, which develop as far east as Sudan in east Africa, and drift across the continent into the Atlantic Ocean. These are generated or enhanced by the African Easterly Jet. The clockwise circulation of the large transoceanic high-pressure cell or anticyclone centered near the Azores islands (known as the Azores High) impels easterly waves away from the coastal areas of Africa towards North America.

Tropical waves are the origin of approximately 60% of Atlantic tropical cyclones and of approximately 85% of intense Atlantic hurricanes (Category 3 and greater).

Tropical cyclones can sometimes degenerate back into a tropical wave. This normally occurs if upper-level wind shear is too strong. The storm can redevelop if the upper-level shear abates.

If a tropical wave is moving quickly, or is organized enough, it can have winds of a strength in excess of tropical storm force, but it is not considered a tropical storm unless it has a closed low-level circulation. An example of this was Hurricane Claudette in 2003, where the original wave had winds of before developing a closed low-level circulation.

==East Pacific==
It has been suggested that some eastern Pacific Ocean tropical cyclones are formed out of tropical easterly waves that originate in North Africa as well. After developing into a tropical cyclone, some of those systems can then reach the Central Pacific Ocean, such as Hurricane Lane in 2018. During the summer months, tropical waves can extend northward as far as the desert of the southwestern United States, producing spells of intensified shower activity embedded within the prevailing monsoon regime.

== Screaming eagle waves ==
A screaming eagle is a tropical wave with a convective pattern that loosely resembles the head of an eagle. This phenomenon is caused by shearing from either westerly winds aloft or strong easterly winds at the surface. These systems are typically located within 25 degrees latitude of the equator. Rain showers and surface winds gusting to are associated with these waves. They move across the ocean at a rate of . Strong thunderstorm activity can be associated with the features when located east of a tropical upper tropospheric trough. The term was first publicly seen in an Air Force satellite interpretation handbook written by Hank Brandli in 1976. In 1969, Brandli discovered that a storm of this type threatened the original splashdown site for Apollo 11.

<doc id="1038151" wikidata="Q6865833" url="?curid=1038151" title="Minister for Finance (Australia)">
<text>The Minister for Finance is a member of the Cabinet of Australia who is responsible for monitoring government expenditure and financial management. The current minister is Senator Katy Gallagher who has held the position since May 2022.

In the Government of Australia, the minister supplements the role of the Treasurer, being responsible for areas such as government expenditure, financial management, and the operations of government. The minister administers the portfolio through the Department of Finance.

The Finance Minister is in effect the deputy Treasurer (not to be confused with the Assistant Treasurer), as the Finance Minister acts as the Treasurer in the Treasurer&#x27;s absence. Unlike the Treasurer, who by convention has been a member of the House of Representatives, the Finance Minister may come from either House of Parliament.

==List of ministers==

The portfolio was first created in 1977 by Malcolm Fraser&#x27;s Liberal Party of Australia government as Minister for Finance. It was subsequently renamed Minister for Finance and Administration by John Howard&#x27;s government in 1997, and as Minister for Finance and Deregulation by Kevin Rudd&#x27;s government in 2007, then returning to Minister for Finance under Tony Abbott in 2013. It took on its current name under Scott Morrison in 2018; the Second Morrison Ministry removed Public Service from the portfolio in May 2019. The following individuals have been appointed as Minister for Finance or any precedent titles:

Notwithstanding Philip Lynch, John Howard and Wayne Swan who were Treasurers whilst serving as Finance Minister, two Finance Ministers who were from the House of Representatives, John Dawkins and Ralph Willis, then served as Treasurer.
In addition John Fahey (served 1996-2001) had previously served as Treasurer of New South Wales when he was also Premier of that state and current minister Katy Gallagher had previously served as Treasurer of the Australian Capital Territory including when she was also the territory Chief Minister.

: Morrison was appointed as Minister for Finance by the Governor-General on Morrison&#x27;s advice in March 2020, with both Morrison and Cormann holding the position of Minister for Finance until October 2020, and then Morrison and Birmingham until May 2022. However, the appointment of Morrison was not made public until August 2022.

==Former ministerial portfolios==

<doc id="1038153" wikidata="Q3112204" url="?curid=1038153" title="Ned Kelly (1970 film)">
<text>Ned Kelly is a 1970 British-Australian biographical bushranger film. It was the seventh feature film version of the story of 19th-century Australian bushranger Ned Kelly, and is notable for being the first Kelly film to be shot in colour.

The film was directed by Tony Richardson, and starred Mick Jagger in the title role. Scottish-born actor Mark McManus played the part of Kelly&#x27;s friend Joe Byrne. It was a British production, but was filmed entirely in Australia, shot mostly around Braidwood in southern New South Wales, with a largely Australian supporting cast.

==Plot==
Ned Kelly is forced by police persecution to become a bushranger. He robs several banks and is eventually captured after the Siege of Glenrowan. He is hanged in Melbourne.

==Cast==

==Production==
===Development===
====Karel Reisz and Albert Finney====
In the early 1960s, Karel Reisz and Albert Finney announced plans to make a film about Ned Kelly from a screenplay by David Storey. Finney and Reisz flew to Australia in October 1962 and spent ten weeks picking locations and doing research.

In January 1963, it was reported the film would star Finney and Angela Lansbury. The movie was meant to be Finney&#x27;s next project after &quot;Tom Jones&quot; (1963) and filming was to start in March 1963.

The British arm of Columbia Pictures agreed to put up the entire budget. However, British labour union regulations required a mostly British crew, and the cost of putting them up in Australia put the budget beyond what Columbia were willing to pay. (&quot;Tom Jones&quot; had yet to be released.) Finney and Reisz went on to make &quot;Night Must Fall&quot; (1964) instead.

Following this, Finney was still meant to make the film. However, he and Reisz eventually dropped out.

====Tony Richardson and Mick Jagger====
The project passed on to &quot;Tom Jones&quot; director Tony Richardson, who wrote the script in collaboration with Ian Jones, a Melbourne writer and producer of TV drama and expert on Ned Kelly. According to Kevin Brownlow, Ian McKellen was originally set to play the lead but the producers went for Mick Jagger.

&quot;I am taking this film very seriously&quot;, said Jagger at the time. &quot;Kelly won&#x27;t look anything like me. You wait and you&#x27;ll see what I look like. I want to concentrate on being a character actor.&quot;

During pre-production other filmmakers, including Tim Burstall, Gary Shead and Dino de Laurentiis, announced their own Ned Kelly projects.

===Casting===
The making of the film was dogged by problems; even before production began, Actors&#x27; Equity and some of Kelly&#x27;s descendants protested strongly about the casting of Jagger in the lead role, and about the film&#x27;s proposed shooting location in country New South Wales, rather than in Victoria, where the Kellys had lived.

Jagger&#x27;s girlfriend of the time, Marianne Faithfull, had come to Australia to play the lead female role (Ned&#x27;s sister, Maggie), but their relationship was breaking up, and she took an overdose of sleeping tablets soon after arrival in Sydney. She was hospitalised in a coma, but recovered and was sent home. She was replaced by a then-unknown Australian actress, Diane Craig, then studying at NIDA.

===Filming===
Shooting began on 12 July 1969 and took ten weeks. During production, Jagger was slightly injured by a backfiring pistol, the cast and crew were dogged by illness, a number of costumes were destroyed by fire, and Jagger&#x27;s co-star, Mark McManus, narrowly escaped serious injury when a horse-drawn cart in which he was riding overturned during filming.

Unlike most film versions, this is the first Ned Kelly film to feature the writing of &quot;The Cameron Letter&quot;, one of Kelly&#x27;s lesser-known and rarely published letters that was written to Donald Cameron, a member of the Parliament of Victoria. The letter was Kelly&#x27;s first attempt to gain public sympathy. However, Kelly&#x27;s well-known letter, The Jerilderie Letter, is omitted from the film.

==Release==
===Reception===
The film was poorly received at its opening, and is still regarded as one of Richardson&#x27;s least successful efforts. It was effectively disowned by Richardson and Jagger, neither of whom attended the London premiere. As late as 1980 Jagger claimed he had never seen the film. Gerry Fisher&#x27;s cinematography, however, has been praised for its craftsmanship – repoussoir, shadow, reflection and understated lighting – giving the film a melancholy feel.

Arthur Krim of United Artists later did an assessment of the film as part of an evaluation of the company&#x27;s inventory:
When we programmed this picture we thought Mick Jagger would be a big personality with the younger audience. Unfortunately, his other film &quot;Performance&quot; came out just before &quot;Ned Kelly&quot; and failed. We have every belief that &quot;Ned Kelly&quot; will not do well either. In addition, Tony Richardson, the filmmaker handled the material in a very slow-paced manner and we have not been able to persuade him to make the cuts necessary to improve the film. This is again a case of programming a film in a time of much greater optimism about the size of the so-called youth orientated – particularly starring one of the new folk heroes.

A.H. Weiler of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said,

&quot;Filmink&quot; argued &quot;Jagger was known as a wild child rock star but in the film played Ned Kelly as this languid… uh… I’m not sure what Jagger played Kelly as, to be honest, but it was not the same guy who sang &#x27;Sympathy for the Devil&#x27;.&quot;

===Box office===
&quot;Ned Kelly&quot; grossed $808,000 at the box office in Australia, which is equivalent to $7,716,400 in 2009 dollars.

===Home media===
==Legacy==
Ian Jones later wrote and produced (with his wife Bronwyn Binns) a mini-series on Kelly, &quot;The Last Outlaw&quot;, which aired on the Seven Network in 1980. Australian actor John Jarratt starred as Kelly.

The actual body armour costume worn by Jagger is on display at the Queanbeyan City Library, New South Wales, and the initials &quot;MJ&quot; are scratched on the inside. The head-piece, like its original, was stolen.

==Soundtrack==

The &quot;Ned Kelly&quot; soundtrack features music composed by Shel Silverstein and performed by Kris Kristofferson and Waylon Jennings and produced by Ron Haffkine, with one solo track sung by Jagger and one sung by Tom Ghent.

<doc id="1038157" wikidata="Q1753335" url="?curid=1038157" title="Rasgueado">
<text>Rasgueado (also called Golpeado, Rageo (spelled so or Rajeo), Rasgueo or Rasgeo in Andalusian dialect and flamenco jargon, or even occasionally Rasqueado) is a guitar finger strumming technique commonly associated with flamenco guitar music. It is also used in classical and other fingerstyle guitar picking techniques. The rasgueado is executed using the fingers of the strumming hand in rhythmically precise, and often rapid, strumming patterns. The important characteristic of this strumming style is the fingernail (outer) side of the finger tips (as opposed to their fleshy inner side) is also used, and in such case, in reverse of the way it is done when the fleshy side of the finger tips is used, namely downward (index, middle, ring and little finger) and upward (thumb).

==History==

Prior to the 19th century, the terms &quot;battuto&quot; (from the Italian) and &quot;golpeado&quot; were sometimes used to describe the technique. Although originating in the classical tradition, the technique is most often associated with flamenco guitar.

Its use in classical music is limited today, but examples of pieces employing rasgueado are &quot;Asturias&quot; (composed for piano by Isaac Albéniz but often played in arrangement for guitar), Manuel de Falla&#x27;s &quot;The Miller&#x27;s Dance&quot; (a farruca from &quot;The Three-Cornered Hat&quot;). It is also heard in the Rodrigo Concierto de Aranjuez. Modern applications of the rasgueado technique can be seen in Luciano Berio&#x27;s &quot;Sequenza XI&quot; and Tristan Murail&#x27;s solo guitar piece Tellur. This technique is used in the arrangements of Pepe Romero, Paco de Lucía and other representatives of the style of &quot;new flamenco&quot;.

==Technique==

In contrast to ordinary strumming, which is usually done either with a plectrum, or with several fingers as a unit, rasgueado generally uses only one digit (finger, thumb, etc.) for each strum; this means that multiple strums can be done more quickly than usual by using multiple digits in quick succession. Furthermore the outer (fingernail) side of the finger tips that is also used and, as a result, in that case, the strumming direction is reversed from the usual one, so it&#x27;s a downstroke for the four fingers and an upstroke for the thumb.
Flamenco guitarists often build up their fingernails using layers of silk and superglue to protect the nail from breaking. There is some loss of tonal quality with this practice, but without it, rasgueado is likely to break most fingernails after a time.
The wooden table of the guitar is protected from the reinforced nails by a plastic plate called a &quot;golpeador&quot; which is stuck to the front beneath the soundhole.

There are several types of rasgueado, but the two main divisions are those that employ the forearm and thumb in conjunction and those that incorporate only the fingers. Of course, both approaches can be combined to allow for the use of all digits on the hand. 

==Application==

Application of the technique is generally required to achieve the rapid strumming and complex rhythms used in flamenco music.

<doc id="1038167" wikidata="Q4119396" url="?curid=1038167" title="Vile (text editor)">
<text>vile is a text editor that combines aspects of the Emacs and vi editors. These editors are traditionally located on opposing sides of the editor wars, as users of either tend to have strong sentiments against the editor they do not use. vile attempts to reconcile these positions.

&quot;vile&quot; is an acronym which stands for &quot;VI Like Emacs&quot;.
vile 9.6 is featured in Chapter 18 of the O&#x27;Reilly book &quot;Learning the vi and Vim Editors&quot;.
An older version (vile 8.0) was presented in Chapter 12 of the O&#x27;Reilly book &quot;Learning the vi Editor&quot;.

The program is also known as xvile for the X Window System, and as winvile for Microsoft Windows.

vile was created and originally maintained by Paul Fox. In 1996, maintenance was taken over by Thomas Dickey, who had provided many major contributions to the codebase over the preceding years.

==Learning to use vile==
Historically, vile&#x27;s documentation has focused on differences from vi. This is in contrast to the other common vi-clones (elvis, nvi and vim), which have combined their respective extensions with the original vi documentation.

vile&#x27;s documentation is three parts:
* The online help file (type )
* Specialized topics such as the macro language (text files)
* Built-in documentation.
** Tables of commands and other data
** Dynamic windows showing register contents, mode-settings, etc.

vile is built from a combination of hand-crafted code and tables processed by a special-purpose program. The predefined information from the tables can be rendered in various ways, including showing the available commands, providing name-completion, etc. In other flavors of &quot;vi&quot;, the analogous tables are not distinct from the hand-crafted code.

In other &quot;vi&quot; flavors, the information shown is static, requiring interaction from the user to make it update. In vile, however, this information is dynamic—it updates these special windows as changes are made to the features they render, e.g., the list of all buffers in memory, the mode-settings corresponding to the buffer which has focus, etc.

While many of vile&#x27;s features are now found in other vi-compatible editors, some of the most powerful were implemented before widespread adoption in the others.
For example, multiple windows were early features in vile (and xvi) from the start. The same applies to reading from pipes, complex fences. Some of this is brought out in the O&#x27;Reilly book, though no careful study has been made of the way in which features are adopted and adapted across the &quot;vi&quot; and &quot;emacs&quot; variants.

==Features==

===Command completion===
vile supports command completion for several elements of a command: the command name, filename, directory name, and mode values.

===Major modes===
Both vi and emacs have modes, which are settings which affect the behavior of the program. vile extends the vi modes such as &quot;list&quot;, &quot;number&quot;, etc., by providing three levels of mode: &quot;global&quot;, &quot;buffer&quot; and &quot;window&quot;. The &quot;buffer&quot; modes are associated with the buffer contents, e.g., line-terminators, read-only attributes. All of those modes are predefined. vile can be customized by defining &quot;majormodes&quot;, which combine specific settings of the &quot;buffer&quot; modes with an association to the file type. These &quot;majormodes&quot; have as well special modes such as the association with a specific &quot;syntax filter&quot;.

===Syntax highlighting===
vile performs syntax highlighting by running a &quot;syntax filter&quot; program which parses the buffer contents. Initially this was a separate program. However, to improve performance and avoid display problems, these syntax filters usually are compiled into the editor. Most of the syntax filters are implemented with lex (preferably flex), with the remainder in C to address irregular grammars such as Perl and Ruby. All of the syntax filters follow the same design:
* Read from an external file the color- and video-attribute information into a chained hash table,
* Parse the file according to the lexical rules,
* Find the corresponding color- and video-attribute information for each lexical element, and
* Write a marked-up copy of the file which is read by vile (via a pipe if the syntax filters are external programs, or via a function call if they are internal).

vile paints the markup information on top of the buffer contents using in regions delimited by line and column numbers. The markup is not attached to the underlying buffer contents. To update the markup as the buffer is changed requires reanalysis. This is done automatically when the user pauses.

==History==
vile has been under continuous development since 1990.

<doc id="1038174" wikidata="Q1777472" url="?curid=1038174" title="Report on Manufactures">
<text>In United States history, the Report on the Subject of Manufactures, generally referred to by its shortened title Report on Manufactures, is the third of four major reports, and &quot;magnum opus&quot;, of American Founding Father and first U.S. Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton. It was presented to the Congress on December 5, 1791. In the report, Hamilton argued for industrial policy to support modern manufacturing technologies in the United States.

It laid forth economic principles rooted in both the mercantilist system of Elizabeth I&#x27;s England and the practices of Jean-Baptiste Colbert of France. The main ideas of the Report would later be incorporated into the &quot;American System&quot; program by US Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky and his Whig Party. Abraham Lincoln, who called himself a &quot;Henry Clay tariff Whig&quot; during his early years, would later make the principles cornerstones, together with his opposition to the institution and the expansion of slavery, of the fledgling Republican Party.

Hamilton&#x27;s ideas would form the basis for the American School of economics.

==Economic plan==
Hamilton reasoned that to secure American independence, the United States needed to have a sound policy of encouraging the growth of manufacturing and ensure its future as a permanent feature of the economic system of the nation. He argued these could be achieved by bounties or subsidies to industry, regulation of trade with moderate tariffs (which were intended not to discourage imports but to raise revenue to support American manufacturing by subsidies), and other government encouragement. These policies would not only promote the growth of manufacturing but also provide diversified employment opportunities and promote immigration to the young United States. They would also expand the applications of technology and science for all quarters of the economy, including agriculture. In his report, Hamilton advocated rewarding those bringing &quot;improvements and secrets of extraordinary value&quot; to the United States. That contributed to making the United States a haven for industrial spies.

===Tariffs===

Hamilton reasoned that tariffs issued in moderation would raise revenue to fund the nation. The tariff could also be used to encourage domestic or national manufacturing and growth of the economy by applying the funds raised in part towards subsidies, then called bounties, to manufacturers. Hamilton sought to use the tariff for the following:

* Protect domestic infant industries until they could achieve economies of scale and be able to compete with more established firms abroad.
* Raise revenue to pay the expenses of government.
* Raise revenue to directly support manufacturing through bounties (subsidies).

===Industrial subsidies===
Hamilton reasoned that bounties (subsidies) to industry, which would rely on funds raised by moderate tariffs, would be the best means of growing manufacturing without decreasing the supply or increasing the prices of goods. Such encouragement by direct support would make American enterprise competitive and independent along with the nation as a whole. In part subsidies would be used for the following:

* Encourage the nation&#x27;s spirit of enterprise, innovation, and invention.
* Support internal improvements, including roads and canals to increase and to encourage domestic commerce.
* Grow the infant nation to a manufacturing power that would be independent of control by foreign powers by relying on their goods for domestic, especially defense supplies.

==Adoption by Congress==
Though Congress refused to accept Hamilton&#x27;s proposals in 1791 because of opposition from Madison and his supporters, much of Hamilton&#x27;s third report would later be adopted by the US Congress despite continued opposition to the support of industry by subsidies. Both sides agreed that manufacturing independence was desirable and necessary but disagreed on how to obtain it. The Jeffersonian Democratic-Republican Party&#x27;s main objection to subsidy was their fear that subsidy would lead to corruption and favoritism of certain sections of the new nation over others: the north over the agrarian south. That divide would return again and again in issues of economic policy until the outbreak of the American Civil War.

It is often thought that Hamilton&#x27;s report was completely ignored, but &quot;Hamilton worked to ensure that Congress enacted virtually every tariff recommendation in the report within five months of its delivery.&quot;

Hamilton&#x27;s revenue-based trade policy, with its more moderate tariffs, meant that by 1794, manufacturers had switched their support from the Federalists to the Democratic-Republicans, who favored higher, more protectionist tariffs.

==Opposition==
Leading opponents of Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s economic plan included Thomas Jefferson (until later years) and James Madison, who were opposed to the use of subsidy to industry, along with most of their fledgling Democratic-Republican Party. Instead of bounties they reasoned in favor of high tariffs and restrictions on imports to increase manufacturing, which was favored by the manufacturers themselves, who desired protection of their home market. Although the Jeffersonian stance originally favored an &quot;agrarian&quot; economy of farmers, it changed over time to encompass many of Hamilton&#x27;s original ideas: Also, &quot;the Madison administration helped give rise to the first truly protectionist tariff in U.S. history.&quot;

<doc id="1038181" wikidata="Q2482954" url="?curid=1038181" title="Orson Pratt">
<text>Orson Pratt Sr. (September 19, 1811 – October 3, 1881) was an American religious leader and mathematician who was an original member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints). After the succession crisis Pratt continued in the Quorum of the Twelve of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and was a leading Mormon theologian and writer until his death.

==Church membership and service==
Pratt was born in Hartford, New York, the son of Jared Pratt and Charity Dickenson. He was the younger brother of Parley P. Pratt, who introduced him to the LDS Church and baptized him on Orson&#x27;s nineteenth birthday, September 19, 1830, in Canaan, New York.

Pratt was ordained an Elder several months later, on December 1, 1830, by Joseph Smith and immediately set out for Colesville, New York, his first mission. This was the first of a number of short missions in which Pratt visited New York, Ohio, Missouri, and the Eastern States. On February 2, 1832, he was ordained a High Priest by Sidney Rigdon, then he continued his missions, preaching in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Massachusetts.

Pratt was a member of the original Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, called in 1835 under the direction of Joseph Smith. He was ordained to this position on April 26, 1835. He served as a member of the mission of the Twelve Apostles to the British Isles between 1839 and 1841. He contributed to the mission by preaching in Scotland, and producing an early missionary tract, &quot;An Interesting Account of Several Remarkable Visions and the Late Discovery of Ancient American Records.&quot; This tract contains the earliest known public printing of an account of Smith&#x27;s First Vision and also contains material similar to that later published as the 1842 Articles of Faith.

On his return to America in 1841, Pratt found the church membership in contention over several issues. Rumors and gossip were rife in Nauvoo, Illinois, and Pratt found the religious principle of plural marriage difficult to accept. He rebelled against Joseph Smith when a report by disaffected Mormon John C. Bennett accused Smith of proposing marriage to Pratt&#x27;s wife, Sarah Pratt, which Smith denied. Sarah also claimed that Smith had proposed, and Pratt believed his wife. After days of Smith and the other members of the Twelve remonstrating with Pratt, they decided that he would not yield, and thus Pratt was excommunicated on August 20, 1842. Bennett claimed that Joseph approached Sarah while Orson was on a mission and solicited her to be one of his &quot;spiritual wives.&quot; To counteract these allegations, Joseph Smith compiled a pamphlet of affidavits, certificates, and letters which proved his innocence and Bennett&#x27;s guilt concerning sexual misconduct. This included affidavits produced by non-Mormon Sheriff Jacob B. Backenstoes and Sarah&#x27;s erstwhile landlords, Stephen Goddard and Zeruiah Goddard. Pratt reconciled with Smith a few months after their falling out and requested rebaptism. Pratt was reinstated in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on January 20, 1843.

===Conflict with Brigham Young===
After the death of Joseph Smith, Pratt was among the apostles that supported the leadership of Brigham Young, who determined to move his followers from Nauvoo to the Salt Lake Valley, where the LDS Church became established. Not only did Pratt support Young’s leadership after Smith’s death, but he was also instrumental in gaining the support of the general body of the church.

As an apostle under Young&#x27;s leadership, Pratt tended to disagree with him on a variety of topics but found little support from the other apostles. Young expressed an appreciation for Pratt&#x27;s ability to preach but added regrettably that Pratt preached &quot;false doctrine&quot; more often than not. A few examples of conflicts with Young include opposition by Pratt to reestablishing a First Presidency in 1847, the legalization of slavery in Utah Territory in 1852, and Young&#x27;s Adam-God teachings. Young also opposed Pratt&#x27;s teachings that the One God of the Bible was a matrix of attributes shared by many individuals who had achieved exaltation to godhood.

Brigham Young attempted to minimize Pratt&#x27;s influence. He did so by sending him away on numerous missions. Further, Pratt&#x27;s brief period of excommunication from the church had long-term consequences. When dealing with seniority in the council after the death of Joseph Smith, Young ruled that if a council member had been disciplined and removed from the council, his seniority was based on the date of readmission. By this ruling, both apostle Orson Hyde and Pratt were moved down in seniority in June 1875. This ensured that neither would become president of the LDS Church. Even with these conflicts, Brigham Young refused to try Pratt for his fellowship in the Church, an indication of how Young was willing to tolerate differences of opinion on theological issues. After Young&#x27;s death, Pratt&#x27;s interpretations and opinions held more influence over the other apostles and later church leaders.

===Missionary service===

After settling in the Salt Lake Valley with the Mormon pioneers, Pratt was called to return to Europe as a mission administrator between 1848 and 1851, during which time he also served as editor of the &quot;Millennial Star&quot;. In 1850, as mission president of the British Mission, Pratt told his missionaries his strategy for spreading the gospel in an article titled, &quot;How to Warn the Whole British Nation in One Year!&quot; Although this goal was not achieved, by the end of the year there were twice as many LDS Church members residing in Britain as in the United States. As a mission president, Pratt was admired by the missionaries for the many logical and well-written pamphlets he wrote and published while he was there and the way he communicated with British intellectuals to discuss theology.

While presiding over this mission, Pratt received a pamphlet from Lorenzo Snow entitled &quot;The voice of Joseph&quot; that Snow wanted translated into French to advance his missionary efforts in northern Italy. Pratt managed to make contacts with people in Paris who were willing to do this translation.

In 1865, Pratt was one of the first Mormon missionaries to work in Austria. Traveling with William W. Ritter, he was there for nine months, but did not baptize anyone. The missionaries were eventually expelled by the Austrian government.

==Migration west==

When news reached Pratt that the LDS Church was moving westward, he said, &quot;We do not want one saint to be left in the United States.&quot; He helped lead the Saints &quot;out of Babylon.&quot; Pratt was a member of Young&#x27;s initial pioneer company, the &quot;Vanguard Company&quot;, that crossed the plains to select a western site for Mormon colonization. His journals of this trip are an important Mormon history resource. As the group made their way from Illinois to Utah, Pratt acted as the company&#x27;s scientific observer. He made regular readings with the company&#x27;s scientific instruments, took notes on geological formations and mineral resources, and recorded information on plants and animals. He described snow on Laramie Peak on June 7, and noted that rock found on June 10, &quot;would make excellent grindstones, being of fine grit sandstone.&quot;

As a mathematician, Pratt assisted company scribe William Clayton in the design and invention of a version of the modern odometer. Intended to compute the distance traveled per day, the design consisted of a set of wooden cog wheels attached to the hub of a wagon wheel, with the mechanism &quot;counting&quot; the revolutions of the wheel. The apparatus, called the &quot;roadometer&quot;, was built by carpenter Appleton Milo Harmon, and was first used on the morning of May 12, 1847.

With Erastus Snow, Pratt entered the Salt Lake Valley on July 21, 1847, three days ahead of the main body of the Vanguard company. Several days later, he preached the first sermon in the Salt Lake Valley and formally dedicated the valley to the Lord.

==Family and polygamy==

Some sources agree that Pratt married seven women and was the father of forty-five children, though other sources, including his first wife Sarah, claim that he married ten women.
At age 57 Orson Pratt married his tenth wife, sixteen-year-old Margaret Graham.

Pratt and all of his wives and children struggled with poverty, likely because Brigham Young constantly sent Pratt on missions. Still, Pratt was able to support himself and his family by writing and publishing pamphlets on Mormon theology. Some of his wives also earned money by selling hats, fabrics, and other goods.

On August 29, 1852, Orson Pratt delivered a sermon that taught the principle of polygamy, discussing the blessings of raising many children up in the LDS Church. This was the first time the practice was discussed openly in the church. In June 1870, Pratt participated in a debate against John P. Newman on whether or not the Bible supported polygamy. He defended the practice in his writings for &quot;The Seer&quot; and throughout his ministry, gaining the title &quot;the apostle of polygamy.&quot;

===1842 polygamy scandal and relationship with Sarah Pratt===
In 1886, Pratt&#x27;s wife Sarah Pratt claimed in an interview that, while in Nauvoo, Illinois, that Joseph Smith was attracted to her and intended to make her &quot;one of his &quot;spiritual wives&quot;&quot; while Pratt was in England on missionary service. To Smith&#x27;s proposal, Sarah replied that she would never break her marriage covenant with Orson and that she did not believe in Smith&#x27;s revelation regarding plural marriage. She issued an ultimatum to Smith: &quot;Joseph, if you ever attempt any thing of the kind with me again, I will tell Mr. Pratt on his return home.&quot;

After Pratt returned from England, Sarah later claimed another incident occurred between her and Smith at her home. Sarah Pratt&#x27;s neighbor, Mary Ettie V. Smith, reported that &quot;Sarah ordered the Prophet out of the house, and the Prophet used obscene language to her,&quot; claiming that he had found John C. Bennett in bed with her. According to Bennett, another incident where Joseph Smith tried to kiss Sarah caused her to tell her husband about the whole incident. Pratt was torn between believing his wife or Smith; he wrote, &quot;My sorrows are greater than I can bear!&quot; Pratt then took Sarah&#x27;s side and confronted Smith, who denied Sarah&#x27;s allegation and responded that she was John C. Bennett&#x27;s lover. The resulting estrangement between Smith and Pratt, who stood by Sarah in preference to the denials of Smith, led to Smith warning Pratt that &quot;if [Pratt] did believe his wife and follow her suggestions he would go to hell&quot;.

In the local and Mormon press, Sarah Pratt was accused of having had an adulterous relationship, not with Smith, but with John C. Bennett, and several affidavits were printed in local and pro-Mormon Nauvoo publications, including the leading councils of the church and from others such as Jacob B. Backenstos, a relative of the sheriff of Hancock County, though many of these allegations are believed to be falsified. Orson Pratt attempted to commit suicide in 1842. At the time, apostle Wilford Woodruff stated that &quot;Dr. John Cook Bennett was the ruin of Orson Pratt.&quot;

A public meeting was held where a resolution supporting Smith&#x27;s character was proposed; Pratt stated that he was unable to support the resolution, to which Smith replied, &quot;Have you personally a knowledge of any immoral act in me toward the female sex, or in any other way?&quot; Pratt answered no, but he became estranged from the church and Smith. Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, and George A. Smith spent several days trying to get Pratt to believe Smith, but Pratt continued to side with his wife. Finally, the three apostles excommunicated Pratt from the church. Sarah was not excommunicated at this time. Both Orson and Sarah were rebaptized by Joseph Smith when they returned to the church in 1843. Orson did not ever consider himself truly excommunicated, and neither, by one interpretation, did Smith.

Bennett claimed that Pratt and his wife were planning to leave Nauvoo and help him &quot;expose Mormonism,&quot; but Pratt published a statement in the October 1, 1842 &quot;Nauvoo Wasp&quot; to deny this claim. Pratt soon returned to the church and denounced Bennett. Van Wagoner cites a letter written by Pratt&#x27;s brother Parley P. Pratt which said that Orson was a part of the church and that Bennett&#x27;s book, &quot;The History of the Saints&quot; (1842), was written solely to get vengeance on those who had excommunicated him and barely worth mentioning. Pratt wrote a postscript to his brother&#x27;s letter: &quot;J.C. Bennett has published lies concerning myself &amp; family &amp; the people with which I am connected&quot;.

Smith and Pratt directly discussed Pratt&#x27;s wife, with Smith stating to him, &quot;She lied about me: I never made the offer which she said I did,&quot; after which Joseph suggested he divorce Sarah and start a new family. Pratt did not divorce Sarah at that time, though one source does report that Orson came to believe that Sarah had lied about Smith&#x27;s proposal. This event would impact the couple for the rest of their lives; they eventually did divorce, though decades later. Sarah secretly encouraged her children not to believe in Mormon teachings. She and her son, Orson Pratt Jr., eventually apostatized from the church.

==Writer, historian and philosopher==
While in Illinois, Pratt acted as an instructor of mathematics at the University of Nauvoo.

In Utah, Pratt&#x27;s strong skills in analysis and writing led Young to assign him to produce sermons and pamphlets dealing with religious topics. Pratt wrote sixteen pamphlets in defense of LDS Church doctrines, drawing on the works of Joseph Smith and his brother Parley P. Pratt. These include &quot;Divine Authority, or the Question, Was Joseph Smith Sent of God?&quot; in 1848 and &quot;Divine Authenticity of the Book of Mormon&quot; in 1850 and 1851. His pamphlet &quot;An Interesting Account of Several Remarkable Visions&quot; was the first published account of the First Vision and included a list of beliefs that is similar to Smith&#x27;s 1842 &quot;Articles of Faith&quot;. In &quot;Absurdities of Immaterialism&quot;, Pratt defended the Mormon doctrine of materiality, with reference to science, philosophy, and theology. As part of his system of Mormon theology, Pratt embraced the philosophical doctrine of hylozoism.

Although these materials were primarily used in the mission field, Pratt was also a church spokesman on the topic of plural marriage. At a special conference in Salt Lake City in August 1852, Pratt publicly preached a sermon announcing the doctrine of plural marriage. He later published an essay in defense of the practice in 12 monthly installments in the church periodical &quot;The Seer&quot;, which provides the most complete defense of the Mormon doctrine during this period. Pratt himself is considered one of the most influential early apologists for the LDS Church.

Pratt&#x27;s views were not always without controversy. In 1865, a majority of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the LDS Church officially condemned some of Pratt&#x27;s doctrinal writings, including some of his articles from &quot;The Seer&quot;. They considered it to be misleading and questionable in relation to the actual doctrine of the Church. Though his many controversial beliefs have been rejected by Brigham Young and other Church leaders, Pratt&#x27;s writings have nevertheless influenced many modern Mormon beliefs, including their concept of God and the doctrine of the gathering of Israel.

In 1869, Pratt transliterated a portion of the Book of Mormon into the Deseret Alphabet.

Pratt acted as Church Historian and Recorder from 1874 until his death. He edited many church periodicals and helped divide editions of the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants into verses and provided footnoted cross references. He served seven terms as Speaker of the House in the Utah legislature.

===Science publications and lectures===
Pratt was known as an accomplished mathematician and had a strong interest in astronomy. The disciplines combined with others to form in his mind a philosophy of what might be called &#x27;early&#x27; Mormon cosmology. He offered science-based lectures on these topics to early Mormon audiences in Utah and published two related books. &quot;New and Easy Method of Solution of the Cubic and Biquadratic Equations&quot; was published in 1866, and &quot;Key to the Universe&quot; was published in 1879. The former is claimed to have been used as a textbook in England, Germany, and France, as Pratt was known as a talented mathematician even outside of Mormon circles.

In October 1851, Orson Pratt taught mathematics in the &#x27;Parent School&#x27; of the University of Deseret. The Thirteenth Ward School House was used for a classroom. On December 15, 1851, he commenced a series of lectures on astronomy and its religious implications, in the Council House. These educational efforts technically were part of an adult educational program.

==Death==

At age 70, Pratt died of complications from diabetes in Salt Lake City. He was buried in the Salt Lake City Cemetery. He continued to be a leading Mormon theologian and writer until his death. When he died, he was the last member of the LDS Church&#x27;s Quorum of the Twelve who had been an original member of the 1835 Quorum.

<text>Fonovisa Records is an American Spanish language record label founded in 1984 by Guillermo Santiso as a subsidiary of Televisa. Its former name before being acquired by Televisa in 1984 was Profono Internacional, which was founded in 1978. Fonovisa mainly produces Mexican style music. It is well known for its signing with artists such as Los Tigres Del Norte, Los Bukis,  Los Temerarios, Enrique Iglesias, Lucero and Thalía.

In late 2002, Fonovisa was acquired from Televisa by the Univision Music Group. Fonovisa was owned by the Univision Music Group until May 2008 when it was bought by Universal Music Group. It is now part of Universal Music Latin Entertainment. Fonovisa headquarters are now in the Capitol Records Building, in Hollywood, California.

==Lawsuits==
On January 25, 1996, Fonovisa was allowed to proceed with its copyright infringement lawsuit against Cherry Auction (which is known for operating the Cherry Avenue Auction in Fresno, CA) for allowing vendors to sell unlicensed records.

Fonovisa itself, however, became the subject of controversy in 1999 when the record label admitted to paying radio stations millions of dollars in payola to play songs from Fonovisa artists. Santiso was also charged with tax evasion during the process.

<text>Of the 45 men who have served as president of the United States, 31 had prior military service, and 14 had none. Their service ranks range from private in a state militia to general of the army.

==History==

Though the president of the United States is commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces, prior military service is not a prerequisite for holding the office.

===Civil War-veteran presidents===
After the American Civil War, public perception of an individual&#x27;s appropriateness for the presidency was influenced by their combat history. After a spate of such veteran-presidents, that influence diminished before disappearing entirely.

===World War II-veteran presidents===
So great was the influence of World War II on US politics, Dwight D. Eisenhower won the 1952 presidential election without any political experience. This halo effect of the war benefited the successful political campaigns of John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Lyndon B. Johnson, Ronald Reagan, and Jimmy Carter. However, after the 1988 presidential election, the shine had dulled on military-veteran politicians, and through 2012, &quot;the candidate with the better military record &quot;lost&quot;.&quot; , George H. W. Bush was the most recent president to have served in combat (as an aircraft carrier-based bomber pilot in World War II).

===Wars without presidents===
====Vietnam War====

The 48-year tenure of veteran presidents after World War II was a result of that conflict&#x27;s &quot;pervasive effect […] on American society.&quot; In the late 1970s and 1980s, almost 60 percent of the United States Congress had served in World War II or the Korean War, and it was expected that a Vietnam veteran would eventually accede to the presidency. Yet, in the chronology of &quot;major conflicts&quot; involving the United States, the Vietnam War is the first to not produce a veteran president, an event that veteran and author Matt Gallagher called &quot;no small feat for a country spawned in armed revolution.&quot; By 2017, a &quot;bamboo ceiling&quot; was described as holding down and preventing those who served in Vietnam from becoming president.

Barack Obama&#x27;s 2006 book &quot;The Audacity of Hope&quot; argues that baby boomers never left behind the anti-military psychodrama of the 1960s, and that played out in national politics. During Bill Clinton&#x27;s 1992 presidential campaign, James Carville succeeded in releasing Clinton&#x27;s 1969 letter that &quot;outlined his opposition to the [Vietnam] war and his decision to try his chances with the draft.&quot; The positive effects of this release proved the diminished cachet of military service in presidential politics.  Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 campaign further cemented this; Trump was elected that November despite bragging about evading the draft, slandering Senator John McCain and other prisoners of war, and publicly feuding with Gold Star parents Khizr and Ghazala Khan. Of this, Gallagher said, &quot;What&#x27;d once been sacred territory in American politics is now anything but.&quot;

In 2015, journalist James Fallows described the contemporary American&#x27;s attitude toward their military as &quot;we love the troops, but we’d rather not think about them&quot;. That same year, Ken Harbaugh (veteran and chief operating officer of Team Rubicon) claimed to speak on behalf of veterans when expressing his dismay, and argued that all voters should be concerned, that the 2016 United States presidential election had no likely candidates with military experience. In 2018, Gallagher noted that when given the opportunity to elect Vietnam veterans (Al Gore, McCain, and John Kerry), the US electorate did not do so. He called this emblematic of the public&#x27;s &quot;vague sense of gratitude for service members&quot; that eschews interest or understanding: Thank you for your service,&#x27; but spare the details, please.&quot;

====Global War on Terror====
With the all-volunteer United States Armed Forces of 2018 comprising 0.5 percent of the US populace, and &quot;the inherent politicization of the wars [current and future politicians] fought in&quot;, Gallagher doubted the viability of future veteran-presidents; &quot;If a Global War on Terror veteran does someday lead the White House, it’ll be in spite of their time in uniform, not assisted by it.&quot;

==Politics==
===Asset===
George Washington, William Henry Harrison, and Ulysses S. Grant were all career soldiers whose presidential aspirations benefited from their popularity as successful wartime general officers. Áine Cain of Military.com called veteran presidents &quot;fitting&quot;, given their responsibility at the head of the military&#x27;s command hierarchy.

===Detriment===
Military service has also been a political millstone for individuals seeking the presidency.

George W. Bush&#x27;s service with the Air National Guard was a point of political contention in his 2000 and 2004 campaigns. Kerry&#x27;s tours in Vietnam were similarly questioned. McCain&#x27;s 2000 and 2008 presidential campaigns saw the retired captain&#x27;s service used against him. Donald Trump&#x27;s five deferments from conscription during the Vietnam War dogged his first presidential campaign. Joe Biden received criticism during his 2020 presidential campaign for his five student draft deferments.

Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Donald Trump all received criticism for deploying the armed forces in combat while having not served in that capacity themselves.

==Policy==

As noted in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, presidents&#x27; military histories influence their policy-making in office.

<text>Combat is a multidirectional shooter developed and published by Atari, Inc. as a launch title for the 1977 Atari Video Computer System (later called the Atari 2600). Two players, controlling either tanks, biplanes, or jets, fire missiles at each other for two minutes and sixteen seconds. Points are scored by hitting the opponent, and the player with more points when the time runs out wins. Variations on the gameplay introduce elements such as invisible vehicles, missiles that ricochet off of walls, and different playing fields.

Based on Atari&#x27;s 1974 arcade video game &quot;Tank&quot;, &quot;Combat&quot; was initially developed by Steve Mayer and Ron Milner. Joe Decuir tested it on the in-development Atari VCS hardware. Larry Wagner completed the game and added the two plane variations.

By the early 1980s, Combat&#x27;s the graphics and gameplay were seen as being out-of-date. A sequel titled &quot;Combat Two&quot; was planned for the Atari 2600, but never completed. A prototype of the sequel was later released in various formats. Retrospective reception by publications such as &quot;Classic Gamer Magazine&quot; and AllGame have praised the game, while &quot;PCMag&quot; and &quot;Flux&quot; considered it to be one of the best Atari 2600 games and one of the greatest video games of all time.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Combat&quot; uses two four-directional joysticks, one for each player. The game has several modes of gameplay: &quot;Tank&quot;, &quot;Biplane&quot; and &quot;Jet&quot; and with variations of the above models. The tank and jet modes are viewed from a top-down perspective while biplane games are side view. In all forms of the game, pushing the button fires a missile. Hitting the other player with a missile scores a point. The player with the most points at the end of a two minutes and sixteen second round wins. Variations of the gameplay in Tank mode include adding obstacles to maneuver around, having the missiles rebound off of walls (referred to as Tank-Pong) and a mode where the tanks are invisible except when they are firing a missile or are hit by one. In the other two modes, Jet and Biplane, there are no obstacles, and both aircraft continuously move forward. These levels have options for obscuring clouds that the planes can hide behind. The original 1977 Atari VCS has six switches in front, including left and right difficulty switches and a game select switch. The difficulty switches change the range of fire of the missiles and in the plane-based games also changes the speed of flight. 

In his article &quot;Combat in Context&quot;, Nick Montfort stated it was difficult to place the game genre to &quot;Combat&quot; as assigning one to it would be considered anachronistic. AllGame would later categorize it as a shooter game.

==Development==
&quot;Combat&quot; was programmed while the hardware of the Atari Video Computer System was still under development. Steve Mayer was developing the game by late 1975. The original version was a tank game made on the early prototype Atari 2600 hardware engineered by Mayer and Ron Milner from Cyan Engineering, a consulting firm that Atari purchased in 1975. The VCS hardware was designed to be capable of playing Atari&#x27;s popular arcade games &quot;Pong&quot; (1972) &quot;Pong Doubles&quot; (1973), &quot;Quadrapong&quot; (1974), &quot;Gran Trak 10&quot; (1974), &quot;Tank&quot; (1974), and &quot;Jet Fighter&quot; (1975). &quot;Combat&quot; was based on the &quot;Tank&quot;.

&quot;Combat&quot; was made to fit into a two kilobyte cartridge&#x27;s ROM. In his academic journal article &quot;Combat in Context&quot;, Nick Monfrot stated that the game was coded in assembly language by Joe Decuir, who was working on the final VCS hardware with Jay Miner. Decuir has deferred much of the credit on the game, stating that &quot;Ron Milner and Steve Mayer conceived of what became &quot;Combat&quot;, I was an implementer [...] I worked on it mostly as a test case for the hardware&quot;. After Decuir completed his work on the game, the code was finished by Larry Wagner, the head of Atari&#x27;s new VCS programming team. Wagner refined the tank games and added both the aircraft modes. Decuir later proclaimed that Wagner &quot;made the &quot;Combat&quot; display engine a lot more fun.&quot;

==Release==

&quot;Combat&quot; was bundled with most Atari 2600 consoles from 1977 to 1982. The only systems not bundled with the game were those marketed by Sears under its Tele-Games label, which were sold with &quot;Air-Sea Battle&quot; (1977) under the title &quot;Target Fun&quot; as the pack-in game. The Sears release of &quot;Combat&quot; was known as &quot;Tank Plus&quot;.

According to &quot;Weekly Television Digest&quot; from October 17, 1977, the Atari VCS was shipped to all major market areas by August 1977. The system became known as the Atari 2600 only after the release of the Atari 5200 in 1982. The cover art of &quot;Combat&quot; was drawn by Cliff Spohn. Spohn commented he was not happy with the cover, noting that as the graphic was cut up into four areas that the jet trail is cut and it &quot;always really bothered [him].&quot;

&quot;Combat&quot; was re-released in various compilation formats, such as the &quot;Atari 80 in One&quot; for Windows in 2003 and the &quot;Atari Anthology&quot; for PlayStation 2 and Xbox in 2004. It was also released on portable devices as part of &quot;Atari Classics Evolved&quot; (2007) for the PlayStation Portable and &quot;Atari Greatest Hits&quot; (2011) for iOS. In 2010, it was made available as part of Microsoft&#x27;s Game Room for the Xbox 360.

==Reception==
From contemporary reviews, &quot;Video&quot; compared the Atari VCS&#x27;s launch titles, and gave tank pong the highest rating of the variations on &quot;Combat&quot; with a seven-and-one-half rating for Tank-Pong and Invisible Tank Pong, six-and-one-half for invisible tank game, and six for all the other variations. In comparison, &quot;Blackjack&quot; and &quot;Video Olympics&quot; received a ten and eight-and-one-half rating each, while &quot;Basic Math&quot;, &quot;Surround&quot;, &quot;Street Racer&quot;, and &quot;Star Ship&quot; all received lower ratings. By 1982, the game was receiving negative reception. Walter Lowe, Jr. ranked the game with a one-and-a-half star rating in &quot;Playboy&#x27;s Guide to Rating Video Games&quot; while Ken Uston in &quot;Buying and Beating the Home Video Games&quot; declared &quot;It&#x27;s not fair to be too critical because, after all, this cartridge is nearly five years old; an in this age of rapid computer technology, that makes it almost an antique.&quot; Craig Kubey&#x27;s &quot;The Winners&#x27; Book of Video Games&quot; simply described it as &quot;adequate&quot; with both Lowe, Jr. and Kubey both only finding the saving grace that it came included with the console. In the British publication &quot;TV Gamer&quot; from August 1983, Sonya Bradford found the controls took time to get used to and that the game &quot;becomes a bit monotonous, which is not helped by the poor graphics.&quot;

From retrospective reviews, Brett Alan Weiss of the online video game database AllGame gave the game a four-and-a-half-star rating out of five, declaring that the simple graphics and sound fail to give a true impression of the game, noting its high replay value and &quot;highly entertaining cat-and-mouse action.&quot; In the first issue of &quot;Classic Gamer Magazine&quot; (1999) D.B. Caufield declared &quot;Combat&quot; as &quot;still an outstanding two-player game&quot;, finding that what it lacked in graphics it made up for in gameplay.

In 1995, &quot;Flux&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Combat&quot; #48 on their list of &quot;Top 100 Video Games&quot;. The article stated that despite what the publication described as poor-quality graphics, the gameplay made &quot;Combat&quot; earn its position on the list. In 2012, &quot;PCMag&quot; included &quot;Combat&quot; in their &quot;The Greatest Atari Games of All Time&quot; list, with writer Eric Griffith noted the dated graphics by 2012 standards, while finding that the game felt &quot;pretty magical in the 70s.&quot;

==Legacy==

A sequel to &quot;Combat&quot; went into development for the Atari 2600 and was to be titled &quot;Combat Two&quot;. It was announced by Atari in 1982. The game would have included landscape elements such as water, forests and bridges as well as a level editor. The game was officially announced but was never officially released for the system. An incomplete prototype of the game surfaced in 1999 by former &quot;Atari Age&quot; magazine editor Steve Morgenstern. 

Physical copies of the game were made for sale in limited quantity at the 2001 Classic Gaming Expo. The prototype was released as part of the &quot;Atari Flashback 2&quot; dedicated console in 2005. &quot;Combat Two&quot; was included as part of the &quot;Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration&quot; (2022) compilation for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Steam, and Xbox One.

<doc id="1038199" wikidata="Q1144878" url="?curid=1038199" title="Volcae">
<text>The Volcae () were a Gallic tribal confederation constituted before the raid of combined Gauls that invaded Macedonia c. 270 BC and fought the assembled Greeks at the Battle of Thermopylae in 279 BC. Tribes known by the name Volcae were found simultaneously in southern Gaul, Moravia, the Ebro valley of the Iberian Peninsula, and Galatia in Anatolia. The Volcae appear to have been part of the late La Tène material culture, and a Celtic identity has been attributed to the Volcae, based on mentions in Greek and Latin sources as well as onomastic evidence. Driven by highly mobile groups operating outside the tribal system and comprising diverse elements, the Volcae were one of the new ethnic entities formed during the Celtic military expansion at the beginning of the 3rd century BC. Collecting in the famous excursion into the Balkans, ostensibly, from the Greek point of view, to raid Delphi, a branch of the Volcae split from the main group on the way into the Balkans and joined two other tribes, the Tolistobogii and the Trocmi, to settle in central Anatolia and establish a new identity as the Galatians.

The Tectosagii were a group of the Volcae who moved through Macedonia into Anatolia c. 277 BC. Strabo says the Tectosagii came originally from the region near modern Toulouse, in France.

==Name==
They are mentioned as &quot;Volcis&quot; and &quot;Volcarum&quot; by Caesar (mid-1st c. BC), as &quot;Ou̓ólkai&quot; (Οὐόλκαι) by Strabo (early 1st c. AD) and Ptolemy (2nd c. AD), and as &quot;Volce&quot; on the &quot;Tabula Peutingeriana&quot; (4–5th c. AD).

Most modern Celtologists regard the tribal name &quot;Uolcae&quot; ( &quot;Uolcos&quot;) as stemming from a Gaulish noun &quot;uolcos&quot;, &quot;uolca&quot; (&#x27;hawk, falcon&#x27;), which can be compared with the Welsh &quot;gwalch&quot; (&#x27;hawk, rascal&#x27; &gt; &#x27;fighter&#x27;). In particular, the Gaulish personal name &quot;Catu-uolcos&quot; has an exact parallel in the Welsh &quot;cadwalch&quot; (&#x27;hero, champion, warrior&#x27;), itself from an earlier Old Brittonic *&quot;katu-wealkos&quot; (&#x27;battle-hawk&#x27;). The Gaulish stem &quot;uolc&quot;- can also be found in the personal names &quot;Uolcius&quot;, &quot;Uolcenius&quot;, &quot;Uolcenia&quot;, &quot;Uolcinius&quot;, &quot;Uolcacius&quot;, &quot;Uolciani&quot;, and &quot;Uolcanus&quot;. The Old English &quot;wealc&quot;- (&#x27;hawk&#x27;), which has no known cognate in other Germanic languages, was most likely borrowed from Old Brittonic &quot;*wealkos&quot;. The etymology of those forms remains obscure. Xavier Delamarre has proposed to derive Gaulish &quot;uolcos –&quot; alongside Latin &quot;falcō&quot; (&#x27;falcon&#x27;) and &quot;falx&quot;, &quot;falcis&quot; (&#x27;hook, sickle&#x27;) – from a stem *&quot;ǵhwol-k&quot;-, itself based on the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root *&quot;ǵʷhel-&quot; (&#x27;bend, curve&#x27;). In this view, the animal may have been named after the shape of his beak, just like the Ancient Greek &quot;harpē&quot; designates both a sickle and a bird of prey.

Alternatively, the name &quot;Uolcae&quot; has been derived by some scholars from the PIE name of the wolf, *&quot;wḷkʷos&quot;. According to Ranko Matasović, however, this is unlikely since the Gaulish form would have preserved the o-grade *&quot;wolkʷo&quot;-; he argues that descendants of Proto-Celtic *&quot;ulkʷos&quot; (&#x27;bad, evil&#x27; &lt; *&quot;wḷkʷos&quot; &#x27;wolf&#x27;) rather include Lepontic &quot;Ulkos&quot; and Old Irish &quot;olc&quot; (&#x27;bad, evil&#x27;). Delamarre finds it doubtful since *&quot;wḷkʷos&quot; would have given **&quot;flech&quot; (rather than &quot;olc&quot;) in Old Irish and **&quot;ulipos&quot; in Gaulish (after the P-Celtic sound shift). John T. Koch derives Old Irish &quot;olc&quot; from a Proto-Celtic form *&quot;elko&quot;- ~ *&quot;olko&quot;-, which may be compared with Old Norse &quot;illr&quot; (from Proto-Germanic *&quot;elhja&quot;- &lt; Pre-Germanic *&quot;elkyo&quot;-; cf. the Finnish loanword &quot;elkiä&quot; &#x27;mean, malicious&#x27;); he proposes that reflexes of PIE *&quot;wḷkʷos&quot; (&#x27;wolf&#x27;) include Old Irish &quot;foilc&quot; (from a 9th-century poem) and Old Welsh &quot;gueilc[h]&quot; (from the poem &quot;Y Gododdin&quot;).

After Volcae Tectosages settled in the Hercynian forest (Central Europe), neighbouring Germanic tribes designated them by the name *&quot;walhaz&quot;, a loanword from Gaulish &quot;uolcos&quot; that came to refer more generally to Celtic and Romance speakers in medieval Germanic languages (e.g. &quot;Welsh&quot;, &quot;Waals&quot;, &quot;Vlachs&quot;).

Julius Caesar was convinced that the Volcae had originally been settled east of the Rhine, for he mentioned the Volcae Tectosages as a Gaulish tribe which still remained in western Germany in his day (&quot;Gallic War&quot; 6.24):

Caesar related a tradition associating the Celtic tribe of the Volcae to the vast Hercynian Forest, although they were possibly located in the eastern range of the České Středohoří; yet, Volcae of his time were settled in Moravia, east of the Boii. Their apparent movement may indicate that the Volcae were newcomers to the region. Caesar&#x27;s remark about the wealth of this region may have referred not only to agriculture but also to the mineral deposits there, while the renown attributed to the Volcae &quot;in peace and in war&quot; resulted from their metallurgical skills and the quality of their weapons, both attracting the attention of their northern neighbors. Together with the Boii in the upper basin of the Elbe river to the west and the Cotini in Slovakia to the east, this area of Celtic settlement in &quot;oppida&quot; led to the exploitation of natural resources on a grand scale and the concentration of skilled craftsmen under the patronage of strong and wealthy chieftains. This culture flourished from the mid second to the mid-1st century BCE, until it buckled under the combined pressure of the Germanic peoples from the North and the Dacians from the East.

Allowance must be made for Julius Caesar&#x27;s usual equation of primitive poverty with admirable hardihood and military prowess and his connection of luxurious imports and the proximity of &quot;civilization&quot;, meaning his own, with softness and decadence. In fact, long-established trading connections furnished Gaulish elites with Baltic amber and Greek and Etruscan wares.

Caesar took it as a given that the Celts in the Hercynian Forest were emigrant settlers from Gaul who had &quot;seized&quot; the land, but modern archeology identifies the region as part of the La Tène homeland. As Henry Howarth noted a century ago, &quot;The Tectosages reported by Caesar as still being around the Hercynian forest were in fact living in the old homes of their race, whence a portion of them set out on their great expedition against Greece, and eventually settled in Galatia, in Asia Minor, where one of the tribes was called Tectosages.&quot;

==Volcae of Gaul==
===Volcae Arecomici===
The Volcae Arecomici ( of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; ii), according to Strabo, dwelt on the western side of the lower Rhône, with their metropolis at Narbo (Narbonne): &quot;Narbo is spoken of as the naval-station of these people alone, though it would be fairer to add &#x27;and of the rest of Celtica&#x27;, so greatly has it surpassed the others in the number of people who use it as a trade-centre.&quot; They were not alone in occupying their territory, with its capital at Nemausus (Nîmes).

The Volcae Arecomici of their own accord surrendered to the Roman Republic in 121 BC. They occupied the district between the Garonne (&quot;Garumna&quot;), the Cévennes (&quot;Cebenna mons&quot;), and the Rhône. This area covered most of the western part of the Roman province of Gallia Narbonensis. They held their assemblies in the sacred wood of Nemausus, the site of modern Nîmes.

In Gaul they were divided into two tribes in widely separated regions, the Arecomici on the east, living among the Ligures, and the Tectosages (whose territory included that of the Tolosates) on the west, living among the Aquitani; the territories were separated by the Hérault (&quot;Arauris&quot;) or a line between the Hérault and the Orb (&quot;Orbis&quot;).

===Volcae Tectosages===
West of the Arecomici the Volcae Tectosages (whose territory included that of the Tolosates) lived among the Aquitani; the territories were separated by the Hérault (&quot;Arauris&quot;) or a line between the Hérault River and the Orb (&quot;Orbis&quot;). Strabo says the Volcae Tectosages came originally from the region near modern Toulouse and were part of the Volcae.

The territory of the Volcae Tectosages (Οὐόλκαι Τεκτόσαγες of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; ii) in Gaul lay outside the Roman Republic, to the southwest of the Volcae Arecomici. From the 3rd century BC, the capital city of the Volcae Tectosages was &quot;Tolosa&quot; (Toulouse). When the Cimbri and Teutones invaded Gaul, the Tectosages allied themselves with them, and their town Tolosa was sacked in retribution by Quintus Servilius Caepio in 106 BC. Tolosa was incorporated into the Roman Republic as part of the province of Gallia Aquitania with the conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar in 52 BC. The Roman conquest of Tolosa ended the cultural identity of the Volcae Tectosages.

According to Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot;, their inland towns were Illiberis, Ruscino, Tolosa colonia, Cessero, Carcaso, Baetirae, and Narbo colonia.

The Volcae Tectosages were among the successful raiders of the Delphi expedition and were said to have transported their booty to Tolosa. A significant part of these raiders however did not return and crossed the Bosporus instead. As a result, Tectosages was also the name of one of the three great communities of Gauls who invaded and settled in Anatolia in the country called after them &quot;Galatia&quot;.

Venceslas Kruta suggests that their movement into this region was probably motivated by a Carthaginian recruiting post situated close by, a main attraction of the region for Celtic mercenaries eager for more campaigning. Indeed, after crossing the Pyrenees in 218 BC, Hannibal in travelling through southern Gaul was greeted by warlike tribes: the Volcae, the Arverni, the Allobroges, and the Gaesatae of the Rhône Valley, who rose to prominence around the middle of the 3rd century BC. From around that time, this part of Gaul underwent a process of stabilization buttressed by the formation of new and powerful tribal confederations as well as the development of new-style settlements, such as Tolosa and Nemausus (Nîmes), resembling the urban centers of the Mediterranean world.

In 107, the Volcae, allies of the Tigurini, a branch of the Helvetii who belonged to a coalition that formed around the Cimbri and the Teutons, defeated a Roman army at Tolosa. In 106–5, Q. Servilius Caepio was sent with an army to put down the revolt, and as a result, Tolosa was sacked, and thereafter the town and its territory were absorbed into Gallia Narbonensis, thereby establishing firm control over the western Gallic trade corridor along the Carcassonne Gap and the Garonne.
The Volcae were highly influential in Moravia, and together with the Boii and the Cotini and other Danubian tribes, they controlled a highly active network of trade routes connected to the Mediterranean and the German lands.

<text>Marina Mniszech or Mnishek (, ; , ; – 24 December 1614) was a Polish noblewoman who was the tsaritsa of all Russia in May 1606 during the Time of Troubles as the wife of False Dmitry I. Following the death of her husband, she later married another imposter to the throne, False Dmitry II. A devout Catholic, she hoped to convert Russia&#x27;s population to Catholicism.

==Life==
Marina Mniszech was a daughter of Jadwiga Tarło and Polish Voivode-Governor of Sandomierz Jerzy Mniszech, who was one of the organizers of the Dimitriads, which were instigated by the appearance of a man who claimed to be Ivan the Terrible&#x27;s son. Marina Mniszech&#x27;s marriage to False Dmitriy I provided an opportunity for the Polish magnates to control their protégé. Mniszech met False Dmitry I around 1604 or 1605, at the court of one of the Commonwealth magnates, and was betrothed to him. In return for her hand Dmitri promised her Pskov and Novgorod, and her father Smolensk and Severia. After the death of Boris Godunov, Dmitri captured Moscow in June 1605. In November he sent a diplomatic mission to Poland, asking for Marina&#x27;s hand and proposing a military alliance to defeat the Ottoman Empire.

===Tsaritsa===

The first wedding ceremony, performed in November 1605 by the Bishop of Kraków, Cardinal Bernard Maciejowski was held &quot;per procura&quot; in Kraków, at the Montelupi complex (&quot;Pod Jaszczurami&quot; and &quot;Firlejowska&quot;) and was attended by the Polish king Sigismund III Vasa himself, as well as hundreds of high-ranking szlachta members and foreign guests. Dmitri was represented by Muscovite envoy Afanasy Vlasiev. Afterwards, Marina went with her father and a retinue of approximately 4,000 to Moscow. At the beginning of May 1606, Marina entered Moscow in a triumphant parade, and on 8 May was crowned in Ascension Cathedral when Patriarch Ignatius confirmed their marriage and put the Rurikid crown on her head. It is unknown whether Marina converted from Catholicism to Orthodoxy. She wore a Polish wedding dress, and Dmitri wore the armor of a Polish hussar.

However, Marina did not reign long. On the morning of 17 May 1606, about two weeks after the coronation, conspirators opposed to Dmitri and his policy of close cooperation with Poland stormed the Kremlin. Dmitri tried to flee through a window but broke his leg in the fall. One of the plotters shot him dead on the spot. At first the body was put on display, then cremated and the ashes were shot from a cannon towards Poland. Dmitri&#x27;s reign had lasted a mere ten months. Vasili Shuisky, whom Dmitri earlier pardoned for conspiring against him, took his place as Tsar. This coup d&#x27;état caused thousands of deaths, including many from the Polish entourage. Marina and her father Jerzy Mniszech were imprisoned. However, the story of the False Dmitri was just beginning.

===Later life===
After the death of False Dmitry I, Marina Mniszech was spared her life – after she had rejected her royal title – and sent back to Poland in July 1608. However, her father Jerzy Mniszech didn&#x27;t give up on his plan to become father-in-law of the Tsar. Exiled to Yaroslavl, he searched for a way to regain his favours. With his help, Marina turned up in Tushino, where she would secretly marry another impostor False Dmitry II, after supposedly recognizing him as her husband. Polish hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski wrote in his memoirs that the only two things False Dmitris I and II had in common was that &quot;they were both human and usurpers&quot;. False Dmitry II was killed in December 1610.

Marina Mniszech then found herself a protector in the person of ataman Ivan Zarutsky, who would try to support the nomination of her son Ivan (born in January 1611) for the Russian throne. His henchmen called Marina Mniszech&#x27;s son &quot;Ivan Dmitriyevich&quot; (literally &quot;Ivan, son of Dmitri&quot;), however, Patriarch Hermogenes would later dub him an &quot;offspring of the rebel/criminal&quot; (&quot;voryonok&quot;; at the time, the word &quot;vor&quot; which now means thief, meant &quot;political criminal&quot;). In the summer of 1613, after having lost their supporters, Mniszech and Zarutsky fled to Astrakhan but with the election of Michael Romanov as tsar, the citizens of Astrakhan wanted the pretender and his family gone from their city. In 1614, an uprising of townspeople was aimed solely at capturing the family and they fled into the steppes. Near the Yaik River in May 1614, after failing to gather support for a Cossack uprising, they were captured by the Cossacks and handed over to the new Tsar the following month.

Ivan Zarutsky and Mniszech&#x27;s little son were executed in 1614. Marina Mniszech died in prison in Kolomna Kremlin fortress, soon afterwards. According to some sources she was found strangled.

==In popular culture==

Marina Mniszech appears as a character in Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s blank verse drama &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; and Modest Mussorgsky&#x27;s opera of the same name. Although both depict Marina&#x27;s impending marriage to False Dmitriy I, the depictions of the future Tsaritsa are quite different. Pushkin wrote, &quot;A tragedy without love attracted my imagination. But apart from love entering a great deal into the character of my adventurer, I made Dmitri fall in love with Marina to make the strange character of the latter stand out better. It is barely outlined in Karamzin. But certainly, she was an odd and pretty woman. She had only one passion and that was ambition, but with such a degree of energy, or fury, that it is difficult to imagine it. Look how having sampled royalty, drunk on a dream, she prostitutes herself to one adventurer after another -- shares now the disgusting bed of a Jew, now the tent of a Cossack, always ready to give herself to whoever can show her a faint hope of a throne which no longer exists. Look at her brave war, poverty, shame, at the same time negotiating with the King of Poland like one crowned head to another, and then end her most stormy and most extraordinary existence so miserably. I have only one scene for her, but I will return to her if God lets me live long enough. She upsets me like a violent emotion. She is horribly Polish, as Mme. Lubomirska&#x27;s cousin said.&quot; 
In Mussorgsky&#x27;s opera, however, Marina Mniszech&#x27;s ambitious manipulation of her future husband is shown to be instigated by a Jesuit priest Ercole Rangoni, who eventually threatens her with hellfire unless she seduces the pretender. Then Rangoni informs False Dmitry about Marina coming to the garden and secretly being in love with him [with False Dmitry]. The pretender confesses his feelings but the proud Marina rejects the love of a &quot;daring vagabond&quot;, and promises to share his feelings only after he becomes a tsar to make her a tsaritsa of all Russia.

== In folklore ==
When Marina&#x27;s three-year-old son, Tsarevich Ivan Dmitriyevich, was publicly hanged, Marina – according to the Russian ambassador to the Polish royal court – “died of longing for her own fate”. According to other sources, she either was hanged or was drowned. 

A popular legend in Russian folklore has it that Mnishek, a powerful witch known as &quot;Marinka the Witch&quot;, put a curse on the Romanov dynasty because of the execution of her son by the new Tsar Mikhail and his father, Patriarch Filaret of Moscow. The boy&#x27;s body had been left hanging near the Serpukhov Gate for months. Marina said: &quot;Damn you! In the Ipatiev&#x27;s [Monastery] you started, in the Ipatiev&#x27;s [House] you will end! You began with the death of a tsarevich, you will end with the death of a tsarevich!&quot; Thus, according to the legend, the barbaric murder of Tsar Nicholas II and his family, including his thirteen-year-old son, Alexei, was Marinka the Witch&#x27;s revenge for the barbaric public execution of her tsarevich-son.

<doc id="1038227" wikidata="Q3630967" url="?curid=1038227" title="Forearc">
<text>A forearc is a region in a subduction zone between an oceanic trench and the associated volcanic arc. Forearc regions are present along convergent margins and eponymously form &#x27;in front of&#x27; the volcanic arcs that are characteristic of convergent plate margins. A back-arc region is the companion region behind the volcanic arc.

Many forearcs have an accretionary wedge which may form a topographic ridge known as an outer arc ridge that parallels the volcanic arc. A forearc basin between the accretionary wedge and the volcanic arc can accumulate thick deposits of sediment, sometimes referred to as an outer arc trough. Due to collisional stresses as one tectonic plate subducts under another, forearc regions are sources for powerful earthquakes.

==Formation==
During subduction, an oceanic plate is thrust below another tectonic plate, which can be oceanic or continental. Water and other volatiles in the subducting plate cause flux melting in the upper mantle, creating magma that rises and penetrates the overriding plate, forming a volcanic arc. The weight of the subducting slab flexes the overriding plate and creates an oceanic trench. This area between the trench and the arc is called the forearc region, with the area behind the arc and away from the trench known as the back-arc region.

The mantle region between the overriding plate and the subducting slab experiences corner flow near the back-arc driven by the down dip motion of the subducting slab. At the same time, the temperature of the mantle wedge closer to the trench is dominated by the denser and colder subducting slab, resulting in a cold, stagnant portion of the mantle wedge.

Initial theories proposed that the oceanic trenches and magmatic arcs were the primary suppliers of the accretionary sedimentation wedges in the forearc regions. More recent discovery suggests that some of the accreted material in the forearc region is from a mantle source along with trench turbidites derived from continental material. This theory holds due to evidence of pelagic sediments and continental crust being subducted in processes known as sediment subduction and subduction erosion respectively.

Over geological time there is constant recycling of the forearc deposits due to erosion, deformation and sedimentary subduction. The material in the forearc region (accretionary prism, forearc basin and trench) cycles downwards from the subduction of the subducting plate and back upwards from the high pressure flow of water saturated rocks from deep within the collision zone. This generates a mixture of igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks to form what is called a Mélange. In general, there is an increase in metamorphic grade from trench to arc where highest grade (blueschist to eclogite) is structurally uplifted (in the prisms) compared to the younger deposits (basins). Forearc regions are also where ophiolites are emplaced should obduction occur, but such deposits are not continuous and can often be removed by erosion.

As tectonic plates converge, the closing of an ocean will result in the convergence of two landmasses, each of which is either an island arc or continental margin. When these two bodies collide, the result is orogenesis, at which time the underthrusting oceanic crust slows down. In early stages of arc-continent collision, there is uplift and erosion of the accretionary prism and forearc basin. In the later stages of collision, the forearc region may be sutured, rotated and shortened which can form syn-collisional folds and thrust belts.

==Structure==
At the surface, the forearc region can include a forearc basin(s), outer-arc high, accretionary prism and the trench itself. The forearc subduction interface can include a seismogenic zone, where megathrust earthquakes can occur, a decoupled zone, and a viscously coupled zone.

The accretionary prism is located at the slope of the trench break where there is significantly decreased slope angle. Between the break and the magmatic arc, a sedimentary basin filled with erosive material from the volcanic arc and substrate can accumulate into a forearc basin which overlays the oldest thrust slices in the wedge of the forearc region.

In general, the forearc topography (specifically in the trench region) is trying to achieve an equilibrium between buoyancy and tectonic forces caused by subduction. Upward motion of the forearc is related to buoyancy forces and the downward motion is associated with the tectonic forcing which causes the oceanic lithosphere to descend. The relationship between surface slope and subduction thrust also plays a huge role in the variation of forearc structure and deformation. A subduction wedge can be classified as either stable with little deformation or unstable with pervasive internal deformation (see section on Models). Some common deformation in forearc sediments are synsedimentary deformation and olistostromes, such as that seen in the Magnitogorsk forearc region.

==Models==

There are two models which characterize a forearc basin formation and deformation and are dependent on sediment deposition and subsidence (see figure). The first model represents a forearc basin formed with little to no sediment supply. Conversely, the second model represents a basin with a healthy sediment supply. Basin depth depends on the supply of oceanic plate sediments, continentally derived clastic material and orthogonal convergence rates. The accretionary flux (sediment supply in and out) also determines the rate at which the sedimentation wedges grow within the forearc.

The age of the oceanic crust along with the convergent velocity controls the coupling across the converging interface of the continental and oceanic crust. The strength of this coupling controls the deformation associated with the event and can be seen in the forearc region deformation signatures.

==Seismicity==

The intense interaction between the overriding and underthrusting plates in the forearc regions have shown to evolve strong coupling mechanisms which result in megathrust earthquakes such as the Tohoku-oki earthquake which occurred off the Pacific coast of Northeast Japan (Tian and Liu. 2013). These mega thrust earthquakes may be correlated with low values of heat flow generally associated with forearc regions. Geothermal data shows a heat flow of ~30–40 mW/m2, which indicates cold, strong mantle.

==Examples==
One good example is the Mariana forearc, where scientists have done extensive research. In this setting there is an erosive margin and forearc slope which consists of 2 km high and 30 km diameter serpentine- mud volcanoes. The erosive properties of these volcanoes are consistent with the metamorphic grades (blueschists) expected for this region in the forearc. There is evidence from geothermal data and models which show the slab-mantle interface, levels of friction and the cool oceanic lithosphere at the trench. Other examples are:
* Central Andean Forearc
* Banda Forearc
* Savu-Wetar Forearc
* Luzon arc-forearc
* Tohoku Forearc
* Between Western Cordillera and Peru-Chile Trench

<doc id="1038228" wikidata="Q3283873" url="?curid=1038228" title="Farewell Tour (album)">
<text>Farewell Tour is the first live album by American rock band The Doobie Brothers, released in 1983. It documents the group&#x27;s 1982 Farewell Tour and is a double album set.

By the early 1980s, the Doobie Brothers had evolved from the guitar-boogie sound under original band frontman Tom Johnston to a soulful keyboard-driven AOR sound under Michael McDonald. Despite the many personnel changes in the group, Patrick Simmons remained from the original incarnation of the group.

In 1982, Simmons decided to retire from the group after years of constant touring and recording. When the band decided to break up in light of his impending departure, Simmons encouraged the group to make one last tour during the summer of 1982 as a way of thanking the group&#x27;s loyal fanbase. This tour became known as the &quot;Farewell Tour.&quot;

The front cover shows drummer Keith Knudsen cutting the strings on John McFee&#x27;s guitar as a symbolic gesture. The last two songs on the album were recorded at the final concert of the tour in Berkeley, California, on September 11, 1982, with vocals by original lead vocalist and guitarist Tom Johnston. For a long time the album was available on CD only in Japan, but ultimately it was re-released on CD by Rhino/WEA on August 26, 2008. The reissue deleted approximately 1 minutes of onstage talk from Patrick Simmons between &#x27;Jesus&#x27; and &#x27;Minute by Minute&#x27;, including mentioning that the band were going to &quot;light up a &#x27;doobie&#x27;&quot; during intermission, suggesting the audience do the same.

==Track listing==

*&quot;Can&#x27;t Let It Get Away&quot; and &quot;Olana&quot; are songs that the band had recorded in the studio but not released on albums. The studio version of &quot;Can&#x27;t Let It Get Away&quot; was released only in Japan in 1981, while the studio version of &quot;Olana&quot; remained unreleased until it appeared on &quot;Long Train Runnin&#x27;: 1970-2000&quot;.

<doc id="1038242" wikidata="Q6647878" url="?curid=1038242" title="Lithia, Florida">
<text>Lithia is an unincorporated community in Hillsborough County, Florida, United States. It is a suburb of Tampa. The ZIP codes are 33547, 33596, and the area code is 813. It is part of the census-designated place (CDP) of Fish Hawk. Lithia is home to the Alafia River Corridor and Chito Branch Reserve.

==Description==
Lithia is a small unincorporated community and home to Lithia Springs Regional Park, Alderman&#x27;s Ford Regional Park, and the C.W. Bill Young Reservoir. The elevation ranges from less than above sea level at Lithia Springs to south of the post office.

The community has a rich history in agriculture, saw mills, and phosphate mining. In the late 1990s, Newland Communities purchased to develop Fishhawk Ranch. Fishhawk Trails was developed by another company, and more public works and retail stores are currently in development.

==History==
Prior to the advent of white settlers in 1846, Lithia had been variously inhabited by Native American tribes, such as the Tocobaga, Muskogan (Creek), Tomokan, Caloosa, some of whom were mentioned by the Spanish in the 1600s, and later the Seminole. Settlers from Georgia arrived in 1847. In 1848, James Alderman created a ford on the Alafia River at the site of present-day Alderman&#x27;s Ford Park. By the time of the Civil War, Alderman&#x27;s cattle ranching operation ran to around 30,000 head of cattle. Around 1900, lithium was discovered in the waters of a spring (now known as Lithia Spring Major), which resulted in the naming of the community to &quot;Lithia&quot;.

On February 21, 2017, United Parcel Service tested a vehicle-launched drone delivery in Lithia.

Lithia is the closest community to the coordinates listed as the launch site by Jules Verne in his 1865 novel &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;.

==Geography==
Lithia is located at (27.85, -82.19); or about ESE of Tampa.

==Education==
Public schools:
*Barrington Middle School (6–8)
*Bevis Elementary (K-5)
*FishHawk Creek Elementary (K-5)
*Lithia Springs Elementary (K-5)
*Newsome High School (9–12)
*Pinecrest Elementary (K-5)
*Randall Middle School (6–8)
*Stowers Elementary (K-5)

Private schools:
*Foundation Christian Academy (Churches of Christ, K-12)
*St Stephen&#x27;s Catholic School (Catholic, K-8)

==Economy==
Lithia is headquarters for The Mosaic Company&#x27;s international phosphate division. While most of the community consists of commuters to jobs at MacDill Air Force Base and elsewhere, there is still a large agricultural component with strawberry growers, citrus, tropical fish, blueberries and other crops. Lithia has also become a shooting destination, with one public and several private shooting ranges, as well as a sporting clays range.

<text>Marvin Jeremy Ashton (May 6, 1915 – February 25, 1994) was a Utah politician and a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1971 until his death in 1994.

==Early Life==
Ashton was born to Marvin O. Ashton and Rachel Grace Jeremy in Salt Lake City, Utah. His father was a local LDS leader and later became a church general authority. Ashton worked in the lumber business as a youth. He graduated from the University of Utah. He worked as managing director of LDS Social Services. Ashton served as a member of the Utah State Senate from 1957 to 1961 as a Republican. He was also president of Deseret Book and involved in other business ventures including a lumber company.

==LDS Church service==
Ashton served a mission in Great Britain from 1937 to 1939 during which time he edited the &quot;Millennial Star&quot;. His mission president was Hugh B. Brown. From 1958 to 1969, Ashton was an assistant to the general superintendent of the church&#x27;s Young Men&#x27;s Mutual Improvement Association. He served as an assistant to superintendents Joseph T. Bentley and G. Carlos Smith.

He was named managing director of the then-newly formed Church Social Services Department in September 1969. A month later he was named an Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.

Ashton was ordained an apostle on December 2, 1971, after the death of Richard L. Evans. Among his assignments, he was president of the Polynesian Cultural Center and a member of the board of trustees of Brigham Young University–Hawaii.

Ashton died on February 25, 1994, and at the time of his death was serving as chairman of the church&#x27;s Leadership Training Committee and was also a member of both the Correlation Executive and the General Welfare Services committees. The vacancy created in the Quorum of the Twelve was filled by Robert D. Hales.

==Personal life==
Ashton married Norma Berntson in the Salt Lake Temple on August 22, 1940, and they were the parents of four children. They won the mixed doubles championship in the all-church tennis tournament in 1954. Ashton was involved with the Boy Scouts of America most of his life and earned Eagle Scout as an adult in 1963. As an adult he was a recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award, the Silver Beaver Award, and the Silver Antelope Award.

<text>The Examiner is the daily newspaper of the city of Launceston and north-eastern Tasmania, Australia.

== Overview ==
&quot;The Examiner&quot; was first published on 12 March 1842, founded by James Aikenhead. The Reverend John West was instrumental in establishing the newspaper and was the first editorial writer. At first it was a weekly publication (Saturdays). The Examiner expanded to Wednesdays six months later. In 1853, the paper was changed to tri-weekly (Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays), and first began daily publication on 10 April 1866. This frequency lasted until 16 February the following year. Tri-weekly publication then resumed and continued until 21 December 1877 when the daily paper returned.

== Associated publications == 
&quot;The Weekly Courier&quot; was published in Launceston by the company from 1901 to 1935. Another weekly paper (evening) &quot;The Saturday Evening Express&quot; was published between 1924 and 1984 when it transformed into &quot;The Sunday Examiner&quot; a title which continues to this day.

== Ownership ==
Once owned by ENT Limited, &quot;The Examiner&quot; was owned by the Rural Press group and is now part of Australian Community Media.

The current editor is Craig Thomson.

==Readership==
For the 12 months ending September 2008, Roy Morgan Research reports a Saturday readership of 100,000 and a Monday-Friday readership of 84,000.

<doc id="1038257" wikidata="Q1196465" url="?curid=1038257" title="Cauchy–Euler equation">
<text>In mathematics, an Euler–Cauchy equation, or Cauchy–Euler equation, or simply Euler&#x27;s equation, is a linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation with variable coefficients. It is sometimes referred to as an &quot;equidimensional&quot; equation. Because of its particularly simple equidimensional structure, the differential equation can be solved explicitly.

==The equation==
Let be the &quot;n&quot;th derivative of the unknown function . Then a Cauchy–Euler equation of order &quot;n&quot; has the form
formula_1

The substitution formula_2 (that is, formula_3; for formula_4, in which one might replace all instances of formula_5 by formula_6, extending the solution&#x27;s domain to formula_7) can be used to reduce this equation to a linear differential equation with constant coefficients. Alternatively, the trial solution formula_8 can be used to solve the equation directly, yielding the basic solutions.

===Second order – solving through trial solution===

The most common Cauchy–Euler equation is the second-order equation, which appears in a number of physics and engineering applications, such as when solving Laplace&#x27;s equation in polar coordinates. The second order Cauchy–Euler equation is

formula_9

We assume a trial solution formula_10

Differentiating gives formula_11 and formula_12

Substituting into the original equation leads to requiring that
formula_13

Rearranging and factoring gives the indicial equation
formula_14

We then solve for &quot;m&quot;. There are three cases of interest:

* Case 1 of two distinct roots, and ;
* Case 2 of one real repeated root, ;
* Case 3 of complex roots, .

In case 1, the solution is formula_15

In case 2, the solution is formula_16

To get to this solution, the method of reduction of order must be applied, after having found one solution .

In case 3, the solution is 
formula_17
formula_18
formula_19

For formula_20.

This form of the solution is derived by setting and using Euler&#x27;s formula.

===Second order – solution through change of variables===
formula_21

We operate the variable substitution defined by

formula_22
formula_23

Differentiating gives
formula_24
formula_25

Substituting formula_26 the differential equation becomes
formula_27

This equation in formula_26 is solved via its characteristic polynomial
formula_29

Now let formula_30 and formula_31 denote the two roots of this polynomial. We analyze the case in which there are distinct roots and the case in which there is a repeated root:

If the roots are distinct, the general solution is formula_32 where the exponentials may be complex.

If the roots are equal, the general solution is formula_33

In both cases, the solution formula_34 can be found by setting formula_35.

Hence, in the first case, formula_36 and in the second case, formula_37

===Second order - solution using differential operators===

Observe that we can write the second-order Cauchy-Euler equation in terms of a linear differential operator formula_38 as formula_39 where formula_40 and formula_41 is the identity operator.

We express the above operator as a polynomial in formula_42, rather than formula_43. By the product rule, formula_44 So, formula_45

We can then use the quadratic formula to factor this operator into linear terms. More specifically, let formula_46 denote the (possibly equal) values of formula_47 Then, formula_48

It can be seen that these factors commute, that is formula_49. Hence, if formula_50, the solution to formula_51 is a linear combination of the solutions to each of formula_52 and formula_53, which can be solved by separation of variables.

Indeed, with formula_54, we have formula_55. So, formula_56 Thus, the general solution is formula_57.

If formula_58, then we instead need to consider the solution of formula_59. Let formula_60, so that we can write formula_61 As before, the solution of formula_62 is of the form formula_63. So, we are left to solve formula_64 We then rewrite the equation as formula_65 which one can recognize as being amenable to solution via an integrating factor.

Choose formula_66 as our integrating factor. Multiplying our equation through by formula_67 and recognizing the left-hand side as the derivative of a product, we then obtain formula_68

===Example===
Given
formula_69
we substitute the simple solution :
formula_70

For to be a solution, either , which gives the trivial solution, or the coefficient of is zero. Solving the quadratic equation, we get . The general solution is therefore

: formula_71

==Difference equation analogue==
There is a difference equation analogue to the Cauchy–Euler equation. For a fixed , define the sequence as
formula_72

Applying the difference operator to formula_73, we find that
formula_74

If we do this times, we find that
formula_75

where the superscript denotes applying the difference operator times. Comparing this to the fact that the -th derivative of equals
formula_76
suggests that we can solve the &quot;N&quot;-th order difference equation
formula_77
in a similar manner to the differential equation case. Indeed, substituting the trial solution
formula_78
brings us to the same situation as the differential equation case,
formula_79

One may now proceed as in the differential equation case, since the general solution of an -th order linear difference equation is also the linear combination of linearly independent solutions. Applying reduction of order in case of a multiple root will yield expressions involving a discrete version of ,
formula_80

(Compare with: formula_81)

In cases where fractions become involved, one may use formula_82 instead (or simply use it in all cases), which coincides with the definition before for integer .

<doc id="1038260" wikidata="Q5198195" url="?curid=1038260" title="Cycles (The Doobie Brothers album)">
<text>Cycles is the tenth studio album by American rock band The Doobie Brothers. The album was released on May 17, 1989, by Capitol Records.

It marked the band&#x27;s reunion after breaking up in 1982. Instead of the later configurations with Michael McDonald at the helm, the band reverted to their 1972-4 lineup although Bobby LaKind who had played percussion with later configurations also rejoined. Tom Johnston, John Hartman and Michael Hossack returned to the lineup for the first time since 1977, 1979 and 1974 respectively.

The album was largely co-written with producers and sidesmen. Bobby LaKind collaborated with former Doobie members John McFee and Keith Knudsen on &quot;Time is Here and Gone&quot; and Michael McDonald on &quot;Tonight I&#x27;m Coming Through (The Border)&quot;. Two cover versions were included in the form of the Four Tops&#x27; &quot;One Chain (Don&#x27;t Make No Prison)&quot; and The Isley Brothers&#x27; &quot;Need a Little Taste of Love.&quot;

The title of the album was taken from an unused song written by Tiran Porter. Porter later recorded the song for his 1995 solo album &quot;Playing To An Empty House&quot;.

Lead track &quot;The Doctor&quot; was released as a single and stormed to No. 9 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock Chart. After this album, Bobby Lakind retired from the band because of terminal colorectal cancer, which claimed his life in 1992.

The album was reissued in 2002 by One Way Records with two bonus tracks. The first was &quot;Anything for Love&quot;, written by Bobby LaKind with Eddie Schwartz and Zeke Zirngiebel, which originally appeared on a CD single of &quot;The Doctor&quot;. The second was an extended remix of &quot;Need A Little Taste of Love,&quot; which had appeared on a CD single of &quot;One Chain&quot;.

<text>Sugar Bear is the advertising cartoon mascot of Post Super Sugar Crisp (later Golden Crisp) cereal.

==History==
Sugar Bear originally appeared in the 1940s as the mascot of Sugar Crisp (later known as Golden Crisp), a cereal produced by General Foods Corporation under the Post brand. The original bear was designed by Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Irwin, a graphic designer for Post Cereal and voiced, in animated commercials, for 40 years by Gerry Matthews in emulation of a Bing Crosby or Dean Martin persona – a shallow-eyed, easy going character who crooned his cereal&#x27;s praises to the tune of &quot;Joshua Fit the Battle of Jericho&quot;.

He was made a character in the 1964 Saturday morning cartoon &quot;Linus the Lionhearted&quot;. Most of the characters in the series, sponsored by General Foods, were mascots for Post cereal products (permitted at that time, later banned by the American Federal Trade Commission (FTC)).

Sugar Bear normally wore a blue turtleneck sweater with his name on the front, and in the 1980s a bite of Super Sugar Crisp would turn him into the muscular &quot;Super Bear&quot; (this alter ego was used to fight monsters who would steal the cereal). Several commercials in the mid 1980s had him using mere casual gestures to outsmart the aggressive tendencies of other animals. Examples include 1987 spots featuring Sugar Bear riding an elephant into a jungle of feisty tigers, playing matador to a raging bull, and sparring with irate sharks of the ocean.

His consistent nemesis was an elderly woman called Granny Goodwitch, with whom he engaged in elaborate contests, often involving trickery, magic, and high technology to decide who got a box of the cereal. In the end, Granny Goodwitch was never angry with Sugar Bear. Other nemeses included Blob, whose breakfast included pickles and soda; and Sugar Fox, who always tried and failed to keep Sugar Bear from getting his box of Super Sugar Crisp.

The Sugar Bear character was popular enough to have occasional premium toys. A yo-yo and padlock were produced in the 1960s, and even in 1993, a Christmas ornament saw him dressed as Santa Claus. Miniature talking plush dolls were also released in the early 1990s. Most recently, a Wacky Wobbler was released by Funko Inc.

Presently, Sugar Bear is being illustrated for the box covers by commercial illustrator Seymour Schachter.

==Musical group==
In 1971, producer Jimmy Bowen, singers Kim Carnes and Mike Settle, songwriter Baker Knight and others created a bubblegum pop studio group named the Sugar Bears. A cardboard cut-out record was produced and printed on the back of thousands of Super Sugar Crisp cereal boxes. The illustrated record identified four members: Sugar Bear, Honey Bear, Shoobee Bear, and Doobee Bear. Five different versions of the record were printed, each with one of five songs shown on the label. A commercial album, &quot;Presenting the Sugar Bears&quot;, and three singles were released by Big Tree Records with one song, &quot;You Are the One&quot;, reaching No. 51 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.

<text>The Gerber Baby is the trademark logo of the Gerber Products Company, an American purveyor of baby food and baby products. Drawn by artist Dorothy Hope Smith, the Gerber Baby was modeled after Ann Turner Cook (1926–2022).
==History==

Fremont Canning Company, owned and operated by Dan Gerber, was looking for a baby face for its new baby food campaign, which was to start in the later part of 1928. To find a baby face that it believed would best represent the new baby food, the Fremont Canning Company conducted a contest in the summer of 1928. Many drawings and paintings were submitted. Some were elaborate baby portraits in oil paint, while others were simple sketches.

Dorothy Hope Smith of Westport, Connecticut, an artist specialising in children&#x27;s drawings, submitted an unfinished charcoal drawing, that was closer to a simple sketch than a professional drawing. Smith told the judges that, if the sketch were selected as the winner, she would finish it professionally. The drawing won but, to her surprise, the judges wanted no changes to it.

In 1928, the “Gerber Baby” symbol was introduced to help identify the new product. It was first used in a baby food advertisement in the magazine &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;. Within sixty days, Gerber Strained Foods, using the “Gerber Baby” symbol, had gained national recognition, being distributed to various places throughout the United States. It became internationally recognized.

The campaign encouraged mothers of newborns to participate directly in a coupon redemption program. The introductory offer gave each consumer six cans of the canning company&#x27;s soup and strained vegetables for a dollar in exchange for the name of a favorite grocer.

The idea was to stress the nutritional value of Gerber&#x27;s baby foods and the time and money saving advantages over buying by prescription. The sketch was so popular that it became the Fremont Canning Company&#x27;s official trademark in 1931. The Gerber Baby has since appeared on all Gerber packaging and in every Gerber advertisement. The Fremont Canning Company changed its name to Gerber Products Company in 1941.

The model for Smith&#x27;s original sketch, Ann Turner Cook (1926–2022) grew up to be a mystery novelist and English teacher. Although she avoided publicity for many years, Cook more recently granted interviews to several Florida newspapers. In the beginning of 2011, the company was in the process of looking for the next Gerber Baby. It eventually chose a toddler named Mercy Townsend.

Earlier, one poll conducted in the United States showed that many people thought that the Gerber Baby became someone famous, such as Humphrey Bogart, Elizabeth Taylor, or Ernest Borgnine. The trademark of the Gerber Baby has been shown by the United States public to be associated with the highest consumer loyalty, according to one survey in 1998.

Of note, in the beginning of February 2018, Gerber selected a baby affected by Down Syndrome for its advertising campaign, and received praise and appreciation from many sources. In 2020, for the first time, Gerber chose an adopted baby as the face of their campaign. In 2022, Gerber chose a baby born with a limb difference, and matched the $25,000 cash prize with a donation to March of Dimes.

<text>Planetary engineering is the development and application of technology for the purpose of influencing the environment of a planet. Planetary engineering encompasses a variety of methods such as terraforming, , and geoengineering.

Widely discussed in the scientific community, terraforming refers to the alteration of other planets to create a habitable environment for terrestrial life. Seeding refers to the introduction of life from Earth to habitable planets. Geoengineering refers to the engineering of a planet&#x27;s climate, and has already been applied on Earth. Each of these methods are composed of varying approaches and possess differing levels of feasibility and ethical concern.

==Terraforming==

Terraforming is the process of modifying the atmosphere, temperature, surface topography or ecology of a planet, moon, or other body in order to replicate the environment of Earth.

=== Technologies ===
A common object of discussion on potential terraforming is the planet Mars. To terraform Mars, humans would need to create a new atmosphere, due to the planet&#x27;s high carbon dioxide concentration and low atmospheric pressure. This would be possible by introducing more greenhouse gases to below &quot;freezing point from indigenous materials&quot;. To terraform Venus, carbon dioxide would need to be converted to graphite since Venus receives twice as much sunlight as Earth. This process is only possible if the greenhouse effect is removed with the use of &quot;high-altitude absorbing fine particles&quot; or a sun shield, creating a more habitable Venus.

NASA has defined categories of habitability systems and technologies for terraforming to be feasible. These topics include creating power-efficient systems for preserving and packaging  food for crews, preparing and cooking foods, dispensing water, and developing facilities for rest, trash and recycling, and areas for crew hygiene and rest.

=== Feasibility ===
A variety of planetary engineering challenges stand in the way of terraforming efforts. The atmospheric terraforming of Mars, for example, would require &quot;significant quantities of gas&quot; to be added to the Martian atmosphere. This gas has been thought to be stored in solid and liquid form within Mars&#x27; polar ice caps and underground reservoirs. It is unlikely, however, that enough for sufficient atmospheric change is present within Mars&#x27; polar deposits, and liquid could only be present at warmer temperatures &quot;deep within the crust&quot;. Furthermore, sublimating the entire volume of Mars&#x27; polar caps would increase its current atmospheric pressure to 15 millibar, where an increase to around 1000 millibar would be required for habitability. For reference, Earth&#x27;s average sea-level pressure is 1013.25 mbar.

First formally proposed by astrophysicist Carl Sagan, the terraforming of Venus has since been discussed through methods such as organic molecule-induced carbon conversion, sun reflection, increasing planetary spin, and various chemical means. Due to the high presence of sulfuric acid and solar wind on Venus, which are harmful to organic environments, organic methods of carbon conversion have been found unfeasible. Other methods, such as solar shading, hydrogen bombardment, and magnesium-calcium bombardment are theoretically sound but would require large-scale resources and space technologies not yet available to humans.

=== Ethical considerations ===
While successful terraforming would allow life to prosper on other planets, philosophers have debated whether this practice is morally sound. Certain ethics experts suggest that planets like Mars hold an intrinsic value independent of their utility to humanity and should therefore be free from human interference. Also, some argue that through the steps that are necessary to make Mars habitable - such as fusion reactors, space-based solar-powered lasers, or spreading a thin layer of soot on Mars&#x27; polar ice caps - would deteriorate the current aesthetic value that Mars possesses. This calls into question humanity&#x27;s intrinsic ethical and moral values, as it raises the question of whether humanity is willing to eradicate the current ecosystem of another planet for their benefit. Through this ethical framework, terraforming attempts on these planets could be seen to threaten their intrinsically valuable environments, rendering these efforts unethical.

==Seeding==
=== Environmental considerations ===
Mars is the primary subject of discussion for seeding. Locations for seeding are chosen based on atmospheric temperature, air pressure, existence of harmful radiation, and availability of natural resources, such as water and other compounds essential to terrestrial life.

=== Developing microorganisms for seeding ===
Natural or engineered microorganisms must be created or discovered that can withstand the harsh environments of Mars. The first organisms used must be able to survive exposure to ionizing radiation and the high concentration of present in the Martian atmosphere. Later organisms such as multicellular plants must be able to withstand the freezing temperatures, withstand high levels, and produce significant amounts of .

Microorganisms provide significant advantages over non-biological mechanisms. They are self-replicating, negating the needs to either transport or manufacture large machinery to the surface of Mars. They can also perform complicated chemical reactions with little maintenance to realize planet-scale terraforming.

== Climate engineering ==
Climate engineering is a form of planetary engineering which involves the process of deliberate and large-scale alteration of the Earth&#x27;s climate system to combat climate change. Examples of geoengineering are carbon dioxide removal (CDR), which removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and solar radiation modification (SRM) to reflect solar energy to space. Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) has multiple practices, the simplest being reforestation, to more complex processes such as direct air capture. The latter is rather difficult to deploy on an industrial scale, for high costs and substantial energy usage would be some aspects to address.

Examples of SRM include stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) and marine cloud brightening (MCB). When a volcano erupts, small particles known as aerosols proliferate throughout the atmosphere, reflecting the sun&#x27;s energy back into space. This results in a cooling effect, and humanity could conceivably inject these aerosols into the stratosphere, spurring large-scale cooling.
One proposal for MCB involves spraying a vapor into low-laying sea clouds, creating more cloud condensation nuclei. This would in theory result in the cloud becoming whiter, and reflecting light more efficiently.

<doc id="1038279" wikidata="Q7972740" url="?curid=1038279" title="Wassailing">
<text>The tradition of wassailing (also spelled wasselling) falls into two distinct categories: the house-visiting wassail and the orchard-visiting wassail. The house-visiting wassail, which traditionally occurs on the twelfth day of Christmastide known as Twelfth Night or Epiphany Eve (January 5), is the practice of people going door-to-door, singing and offering a drink from the wassail bowl in exchange for gifts; this practice still exists, but has largely been displaced by carol singing. The orchard-visiting wassail refers to the custom of visiting orchards in cider-producing regions of England and singing to the trees to promote a good harvest for the coming year. Notable traditional wassailing songs include &quot;Here We Come a-Wassailing&quot;, &quot;Gloucestershire Wassail&quot;, and &quot;Gower Wassail&quot;.

==Etymology==
According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the word &quot;wassail&quot; originated as a borrowing from the Old Norse salutation &quot;ves heill,&quot; corresponding to Old English &quot;hál wes þú&quot; or &quot;wes hál&quot;; literally meaning &#x27;be in good health&#x27; or &#x27;be fortunate&#x27;. It was initially used in the sense of &#x27;hail&#x27; or &#x27;farewell&#x27;. Later it developed into the first part of a drinking formula &quot;wassail...drinkhail&quot;. By 1300, the sense had extended to the drink itself, especially to the spiced ale used in Twelfth-night and Christmas Eve celebrations, and by 1598 it was being applied to the custom of drinking healths on those nights.

== Wassailing during Christmastide ==
Traditionally, the wassail is celebrated on the twelfth day of Christmastide, known as Twelfth Night or Epiphany Eve, being the day prior to the Epiphany. In the liturgical kalendars of Western Christianity, including those of the Lutheran, Anglican and Roman Catholic denominations, Twelfth Night falls on January 5. Some people still wassail on &quot;Old Twelvey Night&quot;, 17 January, as it would have been before the introduction of the Gregorian Calendar in 1752. 

In the Middle Ages, the wassail was a reciprocal exchange between the feudal lords and their peasants as a form of recipient-initiated charitable giving, to be distinguished from begging. This point is made in the song &quot;Here We Come A-wassailing&quot;, when the wassailers inform the lord of the house that

The lord of the manor would give food and drink to the peasants in exchange for their blessing and goodwill, i.e.

This would be given in the form of the song being sung. Wassailing is the background practice against which an English carol such as &quot;We Wish You a Merry Christmas&quot; can be made sense of. The carol lies in the English tradition where wealthy people of the community gave Christmas treats to the carol singers on Christmas Eve such as &#x27;figgy puddings&#x27;. In Dartmoor today, the Ashburton and Moorland Mission Community gathers in the barn at Newcombe Farm to sing Wassailing songs and pray for God’s blessing on the New Year.

Although wassailing is often described in innocuous and sometimes nostalgic terms—still practised in some parts of Scotland and Northern England on New Years Day as &quot;first-footing&quot;—the practice in England has not always been considered so innocent. Similar traditions have also been traced to Greece and the country of Georgia. Wassailing was associated with rowdy bands of young men who would enter the homes of wealthy neighbours and demand free food and drink (in a manner similar to the modern children&#x27;s Halloween practice of trick-or-treating). If the householder refused, he was usually cursed, and occasionally his house was vandalized. The example of the exchange is seen in their demand for &quot;figgy pudding&quot; and &quot;good cheer&quot;, i.e., the wassail beverage, without which the wassailers in the song will not leave; &quot;We won&#x27;t go until we get some, so bring some out here&quot;. Such complaints were also common in the early days of the United States, where the practice (and its negative connotations) had taken root by the early 1800s; it led to efforts from the American merchant class to promote a more sanitized Christmas.

== The Orchard-visiting Wassail ==

In the cider-producing West of England (primarily the counties of Devon, Somerset, Dorset, Gloucestershire and Herefordshire) wassailing also refers to drinking (and singing) the health of trees in the hopes that they might better thrive. Wassailing is also a traditional event in Jersey, Channel Islands where cider (cidre) made up the bulk of the economy before the 20th century. The format is much the same as that in England but with terms and songs often in Jèrriais.

17th-century English lyric poet Robert Herrick writes in his poem &quot;The Wassail&quot;: 


The purpose of wassailing is to awake the cider apple trees and to scare away evil spirits to ensure a good harvest of fruit in autumn. The ceremonies of each wassail vary from village to village but they generally all have the same core elements. While wassailing, a hymn is usually recited, such as:

This incantation is followed by noise-making from the assembled crowd until the gunsmen give a final volley through the branches. The crowd then moves onto the next orchard. In the context of Christian observance, wassailing involves pronouncing a blessing on a tree so that it will bear fruit, often through the singing of a hymn.

As the largest cider producing region of the country, the West Country hosts historic wassails annually, such as Whimple in Devon and Carhampton in Somerset, both on 17 January, or old Twelfth Night. Many new, commercial or &quot;revival&quot; wassails have also been introduced throughout the West Country, such as those in Stoke Gabriel and Sandford, Devon. Clevedon in North Somerset holds an annual wassailing event at the Clevedon Community Orchard, combining the traditional elements of the festival with the entertainment and music of the Bristol Morris Men.

Nineteenth-century wassailers of Somerset would sing the following lyrics after drinking the cider until they were &quot;merry and gay&quot;:

A folktale from Somerset reflecting this custom tells of the Apple Tree Man, the spirit of the oldest apple tree in an orchard, and in whom the fertility of the orchard is thought to reside. In the tale a man offers his last mug of mulled cider to the trees in his orchard and is rewarded by the Apple Tree Man who reveals to him the location of buried gold.

== Wassail bowls ==

Wassail bowls, generally in the shape of goblets, have been preserved. The Worshipful Company of Grocers made a very elaborate one in the seventeenth century, decorated with silver. It is so large that it must have passed around as a &quot;loving cup&quot; so that many members of the guild could drink from it.

In the English Christmas carol &quot;Gloucestershire Wassail&quot;, the singers tell that their &quot;bowl is made of the white maple tree, with a wassailing bowl we&#x27;ll drink to thee&quot;. As white maple does not grow natively in Europe, the lyric may be a reference to sycamore maple or field maple, both of which do, and both of which have white-looking wood. This is reinforced by an 1890s written account from a man describing the wassailing bowl of his friend from Gloucestershire:
Alternatively however, many formal publications from the 1800s list the lyric simply as saying &quot;maplin tree&quot;, without mentioning &quot;white&quot;. Additionally, the lyric appears to have varied significantly depending on location and other factors, calling into question how literal the term was and/or how varied the construction of wassail bowls was. For example, a 1913 publication by Ralph Vaughan Williams, who had recorded the lyric in 1909 by a wassailer in Herefordshire, recorded it as &quot;green maple&quot;. Another version from Brockweir listed the bowl as being made from mulberry.

<text>Climate engineering (or geoengineering, climate intervention) is the intentional large-scale alteration of the planetary environment to counteract anthropogenic climate change. The term has been used as an umbrella term for carbon dioxide removal, weather as a weapon, reduction of pole ice and solar radiation modification when applied at a planetary scale. However, these two processes have very different characteristics, and are now often discussed separately. Carbon dioxide removal techniques remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and are part of climate change mitigation. Solar radiation modification is the reflection of some sunlight (solar radiation) back to space to cool the earth. Some publications include passive radiative cooling as a climate engineering technology. The media tends to also use &quot;climate engineering&quot; for other technologies such as glacier stabilization, ocean liming, and iron fertilization of oceans. The latter would modify carbon sequestration processes that take place in oceans.

Some types of climate engineering are highly controversial due to the large uncertainties around effectiveness, side effects and unforeseen consequences. Interventions at large scale run a greater risk of unintended disruptions of natural systems, resulting in a dilemma that such disruptions might be more damaging than the climate damage that they offset. However, the risks of such interventions must be seen in the context of the trajectory of climate change without them. 

== Terminology ==
Climate engineering (or geoengineering) has been used as an umbrella term for both carbon dioxide removal and solar radiation management, when applied at a planetary scale. However, these two methods have very different geophysical characteristics, which is why the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change no longer uses this term. This decision was communicated in around 2018, see for example the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C. 

According to climate economist Gernot Wagner the term &quot;geoengineering&quot; is &quot;largely an artefact and a result of the term&#x27;s frequent use in popular discourse&quot; and &quot;so vague and all-encompassing as to have lost much meaning&quot;.

== Technologies ==

=== Carbon dioxide removal ===
=== Solar radiation modification ===

=== Passive daytime radiative cooling ===
Enhancing the solar reflectance and thermal emissivity of Earth in the atmospheric window through passive daytime radiative cooling has been proposed as an alternative or &quot;third approach&quot; to climate engineering that is &quot;less intrusive&quot; and more predictable or reversible than stratospheric aerosol injection.

=== Ocean geoengineering ===
Ocean geoengineering involves modifying the ocean to reduce the impacts of rising temperature. One approach is to add material such as lime or iron to the ocean to increase its ability to support marine life and/or sequester . In 2021 the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) requested $2.5 billion funds for research in the following decade, specifically including field tests.

Another idea is to reduce sea level rise by installing underwater &quot;curtains&quot; to protect Antarctic glaciers from warming waters, or by drilling holes in ice to pump out water and heat.

==== Ocean liming ====

Enriching seawater with calcium hydroxide (lime) has been reported to lower ocean acidity, which reduces pressure on marine life such as oysters and absorbs . The added lime raised the water&#x27;s pH, capturing in the form of calcium bicarbonate or as carbonate deposited in mollusk shells. Lime is produced in volume for the cement industry. This was assessed in 2022 in an experiment in Apalachicola, Florida in an attempt to halt declining oyster populations. pH levels increased modestly, as was reduced by 70 ppm.

A 2014 experiment added sodium hydroxide (lye) to part of Australia&#x27;s Great Barrier Reef. It raised pH levels to nearly preindustrial levels.

However, producing alkaline materials typically releases large amounts of , partially offsetting the sequestration. Alkaline additives become diluted and dispersed in one month, without durable effects, such that if necessary, the program could be ended without leaving long-term effects.

==== Ocean sulfur cycle enhancement ====
Enhancing the natural marine sulfur cycle by fertilizing a small portion with iron—typically considered to be a greenhouse gas remediation method—may also increase the reflection of sunlight. Such fertilization, especially in the Southern Ocean, would enhance dimethyl sulfide production and consequently cloud reflectivity. This could potentially be used as regional SRM, to slow Antarctic ice from melting. Such techniques also tend to sequester carbon, but the enhancement of cloud albedo also appears to be a likely effect.

==== Iron fertilization ====
==== Submarine forest ====
Another 2022 experiment attempted to sequester carbon using giant kelp planted off the Namibian coast. Whilst this approach has been called &quot;ocean geoengineering&quot; by the researchers it is just another form of carbon dioxide removal via sequestration. Another term that is used to describe this process is &quot;blue carbon management&quot; and also &quot;marine geoengineering&quot;.

=== Glacier stabilization ===

==Problems and risks==

Interventions at large scale run a greater risk of unintended disruptions of natural systems, alongside a greater potential for reducing the risks of warming. This raises a question of whether climate interventions might be more or less damaging than the climate damage that they offset.

Matthew Watson, of the University of Bristol, led a £5m research study into the potential adverse effects of climate engineering and said in 2014, &quot;We are sleepwalking to a disaster with climate change. Cutting emissions is undoubtedly the thing we should be focusing on but it seems to be failing. Although geoengineering is terrifying to many people, and I include myself in this, [its feasibility and safety] are questions that have to be answered&quot;. University of Oxford Professor Steve Rayner is also worried about the adverse effects of climate engineering, especially the potential for people to be too positive about the effects and stop trying to slow the actual problem of climate change. Though, he says there is a potential reason to doing climate engineering: &quot;People decry doing [climate engineering] as a band aid, but band aids are useful when you are healing&quot;.

Climate engineering may reduce the urgency of reducing carbon emissions, a form of moral hazard. Also, some approaches would have only temporary effects, which implies rapid rebound if they are not sustained. The Union of Concerned Scientists points to the concern that the use of climate engineering technology might become an excuse not to address the root causes of climate change. However, several public opinion surveys and focus groups reported either a desire to increase emission cuts in the presence of climate engineering, or no effect. Other modelling work suggests that the prospect of climate engineering may in fact increase the likelihood of emissions reduction.

Climate engineering also raises moral questions about the relationship between humans and their environment, and under what conditions humans have the right to deliberately change the climate. Some religious traditions express views on the relationship between humans and their surroundings that either encourage or discourage explicit actions to affect climate, depending on the objective. For example, using climate engineering to stabilize temperatures may be seen as an example of stewardship and therefore encouraged. Conversely, climate engineering may be discouraged if is perceived as human overconfidence and hubris.

== Governance issues ==

Governance issues relating to carbon dioxide removal are distinct from those surrounding CE. The key governance problem for carbon dioxide removal (as with emissions reductions) is making sure actors do enough of it (minimizing &quot;free riders&quot;), whereas the key governance issue for CE is making sure actors do not do it too much (managing &quot;free drivers&quot;).

No universally agreed framework for the regulation of CE activity or research has been established. Scholars at the Oxford Martin School at Oxford University proposed a set of principles to guide climate engineering research and use. The short version is:
* Regulate as a public good.
* Public participation in decision-making
* Disclose research and open publication of results
* Independent assessment of impacts
* Governance before deployment

These principles were endorsed by the House of Commons of the United Kingdom Science and Technology Select Committee on &quot;The Regulation of Geoengineering&quot;.

The Asilomar International Conference on Climate Intervention Technologies was convened to identify and develop risk reduction guidelines for climate intervention experimentation.

The Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity made three decisions on what they termed &quot;climate-related geo-engineering.&quot; A decision in 2010 called on countries to refrain from &quot;climate-related geo-engineering activities that may affect biodiversity&quot; until they are governed, are scientifically justified, and associated risks have been considered. Some critics describe this as a &quot;de facto moratorium,&quot; but the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity calls it a “non-binding normative framework.” Legal scholars Scott and Reynolds separately reject this characterization. The 2016 decision called for &quot;more transdisciplinary research and sharing of knowledge among appropriate institutions is needed in order to better understand the impacts.&quot;

== Society and culture ==

=== Public perception ===
A large 2018 study used an online survey to investigate public perceptions of six climate engineering methods in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. Public awareness of climate engineering was low; less than a fifth of respondents reported prior knowledge. Perceptions of the six climate engineering methods proposed (three from the carbon dioxide removal group and three from the solar radiation modification group) were largely negative and frequently associated with attributes like &#x27;risky&#x27;, &#x27;artificial&#x27; and &#x27;unknown effects&#x27;. Carbon dioxide removal methods were preferred over solar radiation modification. Public perceptions were remarkably stable with only minor differences between the different countries in the surveys.

Some environmental organizations (such as Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace) have been reluctant to endorse or oppose solar radiation modification, but are often more supportive of nature-based carbon dioxide removal projects, such as afforestation and peatland restoration.

==Research and projects ==

Several organizations have investigated climate engineering with a view to evaluating its potential, including the US Congress, the US National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the Royal Society, the UK Parliament, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 

In 2009, the Royal Society in the UK reviewed a wide range of proposed climate engineering methods and evaluated them in terms of effectiveness, affordability, timeliness, and safety (assigning qualitative estimates in each assessment). The key recommendations reports were that &quot;Parties to the UNFCCC should make increased efforts towards mitigating and adapting to climate change, and in particular to agreeing to global emissions reductions&quot;, and that &quot;[nothing] now known about geoengineering options gives any reason to diminish these efforts&quot;. Nonetheless, the report also recommended that &quot;research and development of climate engineering options should be undertaken to investigate whether low-risk methods can be made available if it becomes necessary to reduce the rate of warming this century&quot;.

In 2009, a review examined the scientific plausibility of proposed methods rather than the practical considerations such as engineering feasibility or economic cost. The authors found that &quot;[air] capture and storage shows the greatest potential, combined with afforestation, reforestation and bio-char production&quot;, and noted that &quot;other suggestions that have received considerable media attention, in particular, &quot;ocean pipes&quot; appear to be ineffective&quot;. They concluded that &quot;[climate] geoengineering is best considered as a potential complement to the mitigation of emissions, rather than as an alternative to it&quot;.

The IMechE report examined a small subset of proposed methods (air capture, urban albedo and algal-based capture techniques), and its main conclusions in 2011 were that climate engineering should be researched and trialed at the small scale alongside a wider decarbonization of the economy.

In 2015, the US National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine concluded a 21-month project to study the potential impacts, benefits, and costs of climate engineering. The differences between these two classes of climate engineering &quot;led the committee to evaluate the two types of approaches separately in companion reports, a distinction it hopes carries over to future scientific and policy discussions.&quot; The resulting study titled &quot;Climate Intervention&quot; was released in February 2015 and consists of two volumes: &quot;Reflecting Sunlight to Cool Earth&quot; and &quot;Carbon Dioxide Removal and Reliable Sequestration&quot;. 

In June 2023 the US government released a report that recommended conducting research on stratospheric aerosol injection and marine cloud brightening.

As of 2024 the Coastal Atmospheric Aerosol Research and Engagement (CAARE) project was launching sea salt into the marine sky in an effort to increase cloud &quot;brightness&quot; (reflective capacity). The sea salt is launched from the USS Hornet Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum (based on the project&#x27;s regulatory filings).

<doc id="1038306" wikidata="Q4975598" url="?curid=1038306" title="Brotherhood (The Doobie Brothers album)">
<text>Brotherhood is the eleventh studio album by American rock band The Doobie Brothers. The album was released on April 15, 1991, by Capitol Records. It was their second and final album for Capitol. It also marked the final appearances on a Doobie Brothers album by bassist Tiran Porter and original drummer John Hartman.

Four of the ten tracks were written entirely by outside musicians, though two of these, songwriter Jerry Lynn Williams and Jim Peterik of Survivor, also collaborated with Tom Johnston and Patrick Simmons on some of their compositions.

The album contained no major hit singles, but &quot;Dangerous&quot;, Simmons&#x27; anthem to his passion for Harley-Davidson motorcycles, peaked at #2 on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and is still performed live by the band. Johnston&#x27;s &quot;Rollin&#x27; On&quot; charted at #12 on the same listing.

==Aftermath==
The album was a critical and commercial failure, stalling at #82. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, the band was dropped by Capitol. There was also a shift in personnel as Tiran Porter left to pursue a brief solo career, frustrated that his own compositions were deemed unsuitable for the band, while John Hartman quit music altogether. Two other former members, drummer Keith Knudsen and guitarist John McFee, were recruited, but for the next nine years, the band concentrated entirely on live work, frustrated by the lack of support they had received from Capitol. The Doobie Brothers would not release another studio album until &quot;Sibling Rivalry&quot; in 2000, a period of time that was three years longer than the gap between the Doobies&#x27; &quot;Farewell Tour&quot; album and &quot;Cycles&quot;, their reunion album with Tom Johnston.

<doc id="1038309" wikidata="Q7572807" url="?curid=1038309" title="SpaghettiOs">
<text>SpaghettiOs is an American brand of canned ring-shaped pasta in tomato sauce. It is marketed for children as &quot;less messy&quot; than regular spaghetti. More than 150 million cans of SpaghettiOs are sold each year. They are sold in tomato sauce and with additions including meatballs, pieces of processed meat resembling hot dog slices, beef-filled ravioli, and calcium-fortified spaghetti.

While SpaghettiOs is a trade name, the equivalent prepared dish made by various manufacturers is available in many countries as &#x27;spaghetti hoops&#x27;, &#x27;spaghetti loops&#x27;, or &#x27;spaghetti rings&#x27;.

== History ==
Canned spaghetti—short lengths in tomato sauce—was available long before rings were introduced. Ring-shaped canned pasta was introduced in 1965 by the Campbell Soup Company under the Franco-American brand, by marketing manager Donald Goerke, nicknamed &quot;the Daddy-O of SpaghettiOs&quot;, as a pasta dish that could be eaten without mess. Other shapes considered included cowboys, Indians, astronauts, stars, and sports-themed shapes. Goerke created over 100 products during his 35 years with Campbell, including the Chunky line of soups. SpaghettiOs were introduced nationally without test marketing and with television advertising using the tag line &quot;the neat round spaghetti you can eat with a spoon&quot; and the jingle &quot;Uh-Oh! SpaghettiOs&quot; (these six notes are based on the earlier &quot;Franco-American&quot; jingle) sung by Jimmie Rodgers (loosely based on his 1950s song &quot;Oh-Oh, I&#x27;m Falling in Love Again&quot;). Other companies rapidly produced their own spaghetti hoops.

Campbell&#x27;s launched &quot;Spicy Original SpaghettiOs featuring Frank&#x27;s RedHot&quot; in 2023, designed to appeal to millennials, calling it a &quot;hot, more mature twist on a classic offering that our adult consumers grew up enjoying&quot; according to one company executive. Public reaction to the product was mostly negative. One reviewer found the product mild, but ill-suited for younger children, also noting how red it was, compared to the original product.

==Nutrition==
Ingredients of SpaghettiOs Original are: water, tomato puree (water, tomato paste), enriched pasta (wheat flour, niacin, ferrous sulfate, thiamine mononitrate, riboflavin, folic acid), high-fructose corn syrup, contains less than 2% of: salt, enzyme modified cheddar cheese (cheddar cheese [cultured milk, salt, enzymes, calcium chloride], water, disodium phosphate, enzymes), vegetable oil (corn, canola, and/or soybean), enzyme modified butter, skim milk, beta carotene for color, citric acid, paprika extract, flavoring. Potential allergens: wheat and milk.

== Issues ==
===Recall===
In June 2010, Campbell recalled 15 million lbs (6.8 million kg) of SpaghettiOs with Meatballs (all that had been produced since December 2008 minus the large fraction that had already been consumed) due to the malfunction of a cooker at one of the company&#x27;s Texas plants. No reports of illnesses associated with the product and no customer complaints were recorded at the time of the recall.

===Controversial Pearl Harbor tweet===
On December 7, 2013, the 72nd anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, SpaghettiOs&#x27; Twitter account posted a picture of a smiling cartoon SpaghettiO holding the U.S. flag and captioned, &quot;Take a moment to remember #PearlHarbor with us.&quot; The posting was met with criticism by users, who found the tweet to be disrespectful to those who were affected by the attack. The post also quickly spawned parodies, as other users such as comedian Patton Oswalt edited the cartoon SpaghettiO into photos of other national tragedies such as the assassination of John F. Kennedy, 9/11, the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; disaster, the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; explosion, and the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;. SpaghettiOs quickly removed the tweet in question and apologized for any offense it may have caused.

Actress and comedian Natasha Leggero faced criticism for remarks regarding the tweet during NBC&#x27;s &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve with Carson Daly&quot; later that month, where she quipped that &quot;it sucks that the only survivors of Pearl Harbor are being mocked by the only food they can still chew.&quot; In response, Leggero remarked that &quot;the amazing courage of American veterans and specifically those who survived Pearl Harbor is [not] in any way diminished by a comedian making a joke about dentures on television&quot;.

<doc id="1038310" wikidata="Q4985830" url="?curid=1038310" title="Buffalo River (New York)">
<text>The Buffalo River drains a watershed in Western New York state, emptying into the eastern end of Lake Erie at the City of Buffalo. The river has three tributaries: Cayuga Creek, Buffalo Creek, and Cazenovia Creek.

The Buffalo River has been important to the development of western New York, including as the terminus for the Erie Canal beginning in 1825, and later as an industrial area with uses including grain elevators, steel mills and chemical production. When shipping began to bypass the Erie Canal in the 1950s, and later heavy industry declined, the transportation and industrial uses of the river were greatly reduced. Many adjacent factories and grain mills were abandoned. The river and adjacent sites have been the focus of efforts over several decades to improve water quality and restore habitat, most recently in 2011 with the commencement of the Buffalo River Restoration Project.

==Geography==
The Buffalo River flows eastward from the point of confluence, passing through residential and heavily industrialized parts of the city. The river includes a federal navigation channel maintained by the United States Army Corps of Engineers at a depth of below lake level (along with an additional of the City Ship Canal). Because of this designation, bridges in the navigable part of the river are required to allow for passage of high vessels, and many of them are drawbridges. The very low hydraulic gradient of the river, along with the dredging, gives the river an estuarine-like character. Much of the shoreline is hardened by riprap, bulkhead Towns of Arcade, Java, and Sheldon, before flowing into Erie County. The creek flows through Elma and West Seneca, before its confluence with Cayuga Creek in West Seneca.

Cayuga Creek is the northernmost tributary in the watershed. This creek begins in primarily farmland/wooded areas and passes through several residential communities, including Cheektowaga, Lancaster, and Depew, before its confluence with Buffalo Creek.

The East Branch of Cazenovia Creek begins in Sardinia, and the West Branch begins in Concord. The land adjacent to these two branches is primarily agricultural and wooded areas, with the exception of several small residential communities. The two branches meet near East Aurora, after which Cazenovia Creek flows through the towns of Aurora, Elma, and West Seneca, and the city of Buffalo until its confluence with the Buffalo River.

== History ==
The Buffalo Creek area is believed to have been held by the Neutral Nation prior to the 1650s, when the Seneca nation and its Iroquois allies conquered the territory during the Beaver Wars. In the spring of 1780, the British established an Indian village on Buffalo Creek for the mostly Seneca people who had been forced off their lands after fighting for the British during the Sullivan Expedition of 1779. They had fled to Fort Niagara for refuge with the British. After the war, the Buffalo Creek area was developed further as a Seneca settlement.

On July 8, 1788, Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham met with Indians of the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy (including Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca) at Buffalo Creek to execute a deed or treaty for rights to their lands in New York State east of the Genesee River (see Phelps and Gorham Purchase). In 1838, the Treaty of Buffalo Creek dealt with the disposition of the remaining land in New York held by the nations of the Iroquois Confederation. The federal government released a total of about 5 million acres for sale.

In 1825, the Buffalo River was the western terminus for the Erie Canal, constructed through the Mohawk River valley in New York state. Entry to the river from the Canal was gained via the mouth of a small tributary, Little Buffalo Creek, which was excavated and stabilized to form the Commercial Slip leading from the Erie Canal. The Buffalo River formed the southwest boundary of the rough pentagon that enclosed the &quot;Five Points&quot; or &quot;Canal Street&quot; district, bounded on the northeast by the Erie Canal. When the Canal was completed in 1825, New York Governor Dewitt Clinton&#x27;s vessel was towed from the Canal through the Commercial Slip and Buffalo River to Lake Erie. There in a celebration ceremony, he poured Atlantic Ocean water into the Lake, and collected lake water to place in the ocean after his return trip to New York City.

===Origin of the name===
It is believed that the city of Buffalo was named after Buffalo Creek. There are several unsourced theories for the origin of the creek&#x27;s name. Early French and Moravian explorers reported the abundance of buffalo (or American bison) on the south shore of Lake Erie, but their presence on the banks of Buffalo Creek is still a matter of debate. The origin of the name of the creek is still uncertain. Neither the Seneca name (&quot;Te-osah-wa&quot;, &quot;Place of the Basswoods&quot;) or the French name (&quot;River of Horses&quot;) survived, so the current name likely dates to the British occupation, which began with the capture of Fort Niagara in 1759. The British engineer John Montresor mentions the name Buffalo Creek four times in his journal of 1764, indicating that the name was in common use at that time. Numerous other Buffalo Creeks are feature names in the United States, many in eastern states. Scholars believe it is likely most were named after the animal, as was done with numerous Beaver Creeks, Otter Creeks, etc.

== Contamination and remediation ==
The Buffalo River and to a lesser degree its tributaries have been the site of heavy industry, although this has declined in recent decades. This, along with large combined sewer overflows along the river, has resulted in highly contaminated sediments and impaired water quality. In 1987, most of the Buffalo River along with the City Ship Canal was listed as one of 43 Great Lakes Areas of Concern in The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement between the United States and Canada. For over 60 years Stanley Spisiak, known as Mr. Buffalo River, fought for the cleanup of the Buffalo River In 2011, the Buffalo River Restoration Project commenced, which includes major dredging to remove contaminated sediment, habitat restoration, and site access projects. According to a statement by the Army Corps of Engineers in the spring of 2012, the project will result in the Buffalo River being removed from the list of Areas of Concern in three to five years.

The Buffalo office of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation established the Buffalo River Urban Canoe Trail and published a guide in the 1990s describing the bridges, factories and other points of interest along the river. In 2011, Buffalo River Fest Park was opened along the river, including docks, a boardwalk, and a band stand.

<doc id="1038312" wikidata="Q3706503" url="?curid=1038312" title="Urogenital diaphragm">
<text>Older texts have asserted the existence of a urogenital diaphragm, also called the triangular ligament, which was described as a layer of the pelvis that separates the deep perineal sac from the upper pelvis, lying between the inferior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm (perineal membrane) and superior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm.

While this term is used to refer to a layer of the pelvis that separates the deep perineal sac from the upper pelvis, such a discrete border of the sac probably does not exist.

While it has no official entry in Terminologia Anatomica, the term is still used occasionally to describe the muscular components of the deep perineal pouch. The urethra and the vagina, though part of the pouch, are usually said to be passing through the urogenital diaphragm, rather than part of the diaphragm itself.

Some researchers still assert that such a diaphragm exists, and the term is still used in the literature.

The urethral diaphragm is an anatomic landmark used in radiologic and urologic classification of urethral injury. Specifically, when a retrograde urethrogram demonstrates extension of contrast from the proximal bulbous urethra into the perineum, there is an increase of grading of the injury from a Type 2 to a Type 3 classification.

The term &quot;urogenital diaphragm&quot; is often confused with the pelvic diaphragm (pelvic floor), which is a true diaphragm supporting many of the pelvic organs.

<doc id="1038316" wikidata="Q5741129" url="?curid=1038316" title="Robert Fraser (art dealer)">
<text>Robert Fraser (13 August 1937 – 27 January 1986), sometimes known as &quot;Groovy Bob&quot;, was a London art dealer. He was a figure in the London cultural scene of the mid-to-late 1960s, and was close to members of the Beatles (particularly Paul McCartney) and the Rolling Stones. In February 2015, the exhibition &quot;A Strong Sweet Smell of Incense: A Portrait of Robert Fraser&quot;, curated by Brian Clarke, was presented by Pace Gallery at the Royal Academy of Arts in London.

==Early life and education==
Robert Fraser was born on 13 August 1937, the son of banker Sir Lionel Fraser, who had started as a newspaper delivery boy. Lionel Fraser&#x27;s father was butler to Harry Gordon Selfridge, the founder of the Selfridges department store chain.

Fraser was educated at Eton College, and spent several years in Africa in the 1950s as an officer in the King&#x27;s African Rifles.

==Career==
After a period spent working in galleries in the United States he returned to England, and with the help of his father (a wealthy financier who had also been a trustee of the Tate Gallery) established the Robert Fraser Gallery at 69 Duke Street (near Grosvenor Square), London, in 1962. The gallery interior was designed by Cedric Price.

The Robert Fraser Gallery became a focal point for modern art in Britain, and through his exhibitions he helped to launch and promote the work of many important new British and American artists including Peter Blake, Clive Barker, Bridget Riley, Jann Haworth, Richard Hamilton, Gilbert and George, Eduardo Paolozzi, Andy Warhol, Harold Cohen, Jim Dine and Ed Ruscha. Fraser also sold work by René Magritte, Jean Dubuffet, Balthus and Hans Bellmer.

=== &quot;Swinging Sixties&quot; ===
In 1966, the Robert Fraser Gallery was prosecuted for staging an exhibition of works by Jim Dine that was described as indecent (but not obscene). The works were removed from the gallery by the Metropolitan Police, and Fraser was charged under a 19th-century vagrancy law that applied to street beggars. He was fined 20 guineas and legal costs.

Fraser became a trendsetter during the Sixties; Paul McCartney has described him as &quot;one of the most influential people of the London Sixties scene&quot;. His London flat and his gallery were the foci of a &quot;jet-set&quot; salon of top pop stars, artists, writers and other celebrities, including members of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, photographer Michael Cooper, designer Christopher Gibbs, Marianne Faithfull, Dennis Hopper (who introduced Fraser to satirist Terry Southern), William Burroughs and Kenneth Anger. Because of this, he was given the nickname &quot;Groovy Bob&quot; by Terry Southern. His flat at 23 Mount Street, on the third floor above Scott&#x27;s restaurant, was described by Barry Miles as one of the &quot;coolest sixties pads in London&quot;.

Fraser art-directed the cover for the Beatles&#x27; 1967 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; – he dissuaded the group from using the original design, a psychedelic artwork created by the design collective The Fool, instead suggesting the pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, who created the famous collage cover design for which they each won a Grammy Award.

It was through Fraser that Richard Hamilton was selected to design the poster for the &quot;White Album&quot;. His gallery also hosted &quot;You Are Here&quot;, Lennon&#x27;s own foray into avant garde art during 1968.

He was a close friend of the Rolling Stones and was present at the infamous 1967 party at Keith Richards&#x27; country house, Redlands, which was raided by police, leading to the subsequent arrests and trials of Mick Jagger, Richards, and Fraser on drug possession charges. The event is commemorated by the 1968 Richard Hamilton artwork &quot;Swingeing London 67&quot;, a collage of contemporary press clippings about the case, and the portrait of Jagger and Fraser handcuffed together also entitled &quot;Swingeing London&quot;.

Fraser always insisted that neither Jagger nor Richards actually had any drugs with them, and that everything found by the police actually belonged to him. During the raid he persuaded the officers that his 20 heroin pills were actually for an upset stomach and offered them only one for testing. Although Jagger and Richards were acquitted on appeal, Fraser pleaded guilty to charges of possession of heroin, and was sentenced to six months in prison. After his release Fraser&#x27;s interest in the gallery declined as his heroin addiction grew worse, and he closed the business in 1969.

Fraser moved down the street to a large 8-room apartment on the 2nd floor of 120 Mount Street; the previous occupant was writer and theatre critic Kenneth Tynan. Keith Richards from the Rolling Stones was living with Fraser at the time, and it was here, sitting by the window in the lounge room, that Richards had the inspiration for the song Gimme Shelter &quot;I had been sitting by the window of my friend Robert Fraser&#x27;s apartment on Mount Street in London with an acoustic guitar when suddenly the sky went completely black and an incredible monsoon came down. It was just people running about looking for shelter – that was the germ of the idea. We went further into it until it became, you know, rape and murder are &#x27;just a shot away&#x27;.&quot;

=== 1970s and 1980s, and death ===
Fraser left the UK and spent several years in India during the 1970s. He returned to London in the early 1980s and opened a second gallery in 1983, with a show of paintings by the stained glass and architectural artist Brian Clarke, but by this time he was suffering from chronic drug and alcohol problems and the gallery never replicated the success of its predecessor, although Fraser was again influential in promoting the work of Clarke, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring.

It soon transpired that Fraser was also suffering from AIDS. He was one of the first &#x27;celebrity&#x27; victims of the disease in the UK.

In 1985, he sold his Cork Street gallery to Victoria Miro, who subsequently created the successful Victoria Miro Gallery. Fraser seemed disillusioned, and told her at the time &quot;You&#x27;ll never make a contemporary art gallery work in this country.&quot;

He was cared for by the Terence Higgins Trust during his final illness and died in January 1986. He died at his mother&#x27;s flat in London.

<doc id="1038337" wikidata="Q7832502" url="?curid=1038337" title="Traffic grooming">
<text>Traffic grooming is the process of grouping many small telecommunications flows into larger units, which can be processed as single entities. For example, in a network using both time-division multiplexing (TDM) and wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), two flows which are destined for a common node can be placed on the same wavelength, allowing them to be dropped by a single optical add-drop multiplexer. Often the objective of grooming is minimizing the cost of the network. The cost of line terminating equipment (LTE) (also called add/drop multiplexers or ADMs) is the most dominant component in an optical WDM network&#x27;s cost. Thus grooming typically involves minimizing the usage of ADMs.

This is similar to the use of virtual channels and virtual paths in ATM networks.

Effective grooming requires consideration of the topology of the network and the different routes in use. This is especially useful when dealing with mesh networks.

==Grooming Algorithms==

The traffic grooming problem has proven to be computationally intractable in the general case. Hence heuristic solutions are typically used.

== Electrical-Layer Grooming ==
Grooms electrical signals at a granularity of ODUk(k =1, 2(e), 3, 4, or flex).

* Services are transmitted to tributary boards and groomed to line boards through the cross-connect board, encapsulated and mapped to OTU signals on the line boards, and then transmitted to the WDM side.
* Through electrical-layer grooming, services of different granularity are groomed and encapsulated into one wavelength and output to the WDM side. This enables multiple services to share the bandwidth, greatly improving bandwidth utilization.

== Optical-Layer Grooming ==
Grooms optical signals at a granularity of wavelength (λ) by flexibly selecting transmission paths.
* After receiving OTU optical signals, the ROADM board creates optical cross-connection paths internally and outputs the signals to specified egresses. Each egress corresponds to a specific path
* Operation personnel can remotely control the transmission paths of optical signals by creating and adjusting cross-connection paths on the NMS
* Optical-layer grooming used together with the ASON technology can implement automatic fault detection and line adjustment to ensure normal transmission of services.

<doc id="1038340" wikidata="Q459832" url="?curid=1038340" title="Ambrotype">
<text>The ambrotype, also known as a collodion positive in the UK, is a positive photograph on glass made by a variant of the wet plate collodion process. Following the invention of daguerreotypes, cheaper than the French invention, ambrotypes came to replace them. Like a print on paper, it is viewed by reflected light. Like the daguerreotype or the prints produced by a Polaroid camera, each is a unique original that could only be duplicated by using a camera to copy it.

The ambrotype was introduced in the 1850s. During the 1860s it was superseded by the tintype, a similar photograph on thin black-lacquered iron, hard to distinguish from an ambrotype if under glass.

The term &quot;ambrotype&quot; comes from &quot;ambrotos&quot;, &quot;immortal&quot;, and &quot;typos&quot;, &quot;impression&quot;.

== Process ==

One side of a clean glass plate was coated with a thin layer of iodized collodion, then dipped in a silver nitrate solution. The plate was exposed in the camera while still wet. Exposure times varied from five to sixty seconds or more depending on the brightness of the lighting and the speed of the camera lens. The plate was then developed and fixed. The resulting negative, when viewed by reflected light against a black background, appears to be a positive image: the clear areas look black, and the exposed, opaque areas appear relatively light. This effect was integrated by backing the plate with black velvet; by taking the picture on a plate made of dark reddish-colored glass (the result was called a ruby ambrotype); or by coating one side of the plate with black varnish. Either the emulsion side or the bare side could be coated: if the bare side was blackened, the thickness of the glass added a sense of depth to the image. In either case, another plate of glass was put over the fragile emulsion side to protect it, and the whole was mounted in a metal frame and kept in a protective case. In some instances the protective glass was cemented directly to the emulsion, generally with a balsam resin. This protected the image well but tended to darken it. Ambrotypes were sometimes hand-tinted; untinted ambrotypes are monochrome, gray or tan in their lightest areas.

== History ==
The ambrotype was based on the wet plate collodion process invented by Frederick Scott Archer. Ambrotypes were deliberately underexposed negatives made by that process and optimized for viewing as positives instead. In the US, ambrotypes first came into use in the early 1850s. In 1854, James Ambrose Cutting of Boston took out several patents relating to the process. Although Cutting, the patent holder, had named the process after himself, it appears the term, &quot;ambrotype&quot; itself may have been first coined in the gallery of Marcus Aurelius Root, a well-known daguerreotypist, as documented in his 1864 book &quot;The Camera and the Pencil&quot; as follows:

&quot;After considerable improvements, this process was first introduced, in 1854, into various Daguerrean establishments, in the Eastern and Western States, by Cutting &amp; Rehn. In June of this year, Cutting procured patents for the process, though Langdell had already worked it from the printed formulas.

&quot;The process has since been introduced, as a legitimate business, into the leading establishments of our country. The positive branch of it; i.e. a solar impression upon one glass-plate, which is covered by a second hermetically sealed thereto, is entitled the &quot;Ambrotype,&quot; (or the &quot;imperishable picture&quot;), a name devised in my gallery.

Root also states (pp. 373): &quot;Isaac Rehn, formerly a successful daguerreotypist, in company with Cutting, of Boston, perfected and introduced through the United States the &quot;Ambrotype,&quot; or the positive on glass.&quot; What isn&#x27;t mentioned in the referenced book is the particular year in which the term &quot;ambrotype&quot; was first used.

Ambrotypes were much less expensive to produce than daguerreotypes, the medium that predominated when they were introduced, and did not have the bright mirror-like metallic surface that could make daguerreotypes troublesome to view and which some people disliked. An ambrotype, however, appeared dull and drab when compared with the brilliance of a well-made and properly viewed daguerreotype.

By the late 1850s, the ambrotype was overtaking the daguerreotype in popularity. In 1858, the New York City Police Department, inspired by the pioneering Criminal Investigation Department in Glasgow, Scotland, used ambrotypes to establish a &quot;rogues&#x27; gallery&quot;, consisting of portraits of wanted criminals and arrested villains. By the mid-1860s, the ambrotype itself was being replaced by the tintype, a similar image on a sturdy black-lacquered thin iron sheet, as well as by photographic albumen paper prints made from glass plate collodion negatives.

<text>Paul Gavin Adams (born 1948) is a politician and former rally driving champion from New Zealand.

==Early years==
Adams was originally a carpenter and joiner, but later established a business manufacturing outdoor playground equipment. Later, he became a professional rally driver, and won three prestigious New Zealand championships. He also owned a Kia Motors and Suzuki dealerships in Auckland.

==Member of Parliament==

Adams is a member of Pentecostal City Impact Church, and as a result, became involved in Christian politics in New Zealand. After first being a member of the Christian Heritage Party, he joined the religious-based Future New Zealand party. Future New Zealand later merged with United New Zealand to form the modern United Future New Zealand group, which Adams remained a member of until 2005. In the 2002 election, Adams was ranked ninth on the United Future party list. Thanks to the unexpectedly strong performance of United Future, the party gained enough votes for eight seats, leaving Adams just outside Parliament. Later, Kelly Chal, a higher-ranked candidate, was forced to withdraw because she did not have New Zealand citizenship, which she had not realised was necessary. Adams, as the next candidate on the list, entered Parliament in her place.

Adams was one of the more conservative members of Parliament. After he was elected, it was reported that he had made a written submission on the 1993 Human Rights Bill saying that people with AIDS should not be allowed to &quot;run loose&quot;. He also spoke out about subjects like abortion, and fasted for 21 days to oppose the civil unions legislation, which was passed regardless.

==Independent==
On 15 August 2005 Adams left United Future to stand as an independent in the East Coast Bays Electorate. He gained 5809 votes after a short five-week campaign, which placed him third overall. He was subsequently involved with a proposed new party to be established by his former colleague Gordon Copeland and Destiny New Zealand. However, these negotiations collapsed, but Adams then became the Deputy Leader of The Family Party.

Adams stood as a candidate for The Family Party in the East Coast Bays electorate in the 2008 election. He polled third, behind National candidate Murray McCully and Labour candidate Vivienne Goldsmith. As The Family Party failed to win any other electorate or list seats, Adams did not re-enter Parliament.

Adams stood at the 2023 election for the NewZeal party at number 2 on the party list. Adams also contested the East Coast Bays electorate, coming fourth place with 890 votes. Overall, NewZeal only won 0.56 percent (16,126 votes), below the five percent threshold needed to enter Parliament.

<doc id="1038356" wikidata="Q1255350" url="?curid=1038356" title="Darryl McDaniels">
<text>Darryl Matthews McDaniels (born May 31, 1964), also commonly known by his stage name DMC (or D.M.C.), is an American rapper, actor and record producer. He is a founding member of the hip hop group Run-DMC, and is considered one of the pioneers of hip hop culture.

==Early life==
McDaniels grew up in the New York City neighborhood of Hollis, Queens. He was born to an unwed mother who surrendered him to the New York Foundling home. He was a ward of the Foundling, in foster care, until placed with the McDaniels when he was one month old and eventually adopted by them. They raised him as a Catholic, and he attended St. Pascal Baylon Elementary School. He later attended Rice High School in Harlem, Manhattan, New York City. He subsequently attended St. John&#x27;s University in Queens, New York City.

McDaniels listened to rock music and folk music in his youth; he first became interested in hip hop music in the 1970s after listening to recordings of Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. In 1978, McDaniels taught himself to DJ in the basement of his parents&#x27; home, using turntables and a mixer that he bought with his older brother, Alford, after having a comic book sale in their neighborhood. During this period he adopted the stage name Grandmaster Get High.

==Career==
Later that year, McDaniels sold his DJ equipment, after his friend Joseph &quot;Run&quot; Simmons acquired his own turntables and mixer. After Jam Master Jay – who had a reputation as the best young DJ in Hollis – joined the group, Run encouraged McDaniels to rap rather than DJ. Gradually, McDaniels came to prefer rapping to mixing records, and adopted the nickname of &quot;Easy D&quot;. In 1981, he dropped the &quot;Easy D&quot; moniker in favor of &quot;DMcD&quot;, the way he signed his work in school, and then to the shorter &quot;D.M.C.&quot; This new nickname alternately stood for &quot;Devastating Mic Control&quot; or &quot;Darryl Mac&quot;, his nickname since childhood as referenced in the lyrics of the song &quot;King of Rock&quot;.

In 1984, the trio released their self-titled debut album. Their third album &quot;Raising Hell&quot;, went to No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 1 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, making Run-D.M.C. the most popular hip-hop group at the time. During this time, McDaniels became a heavy drinker. He was known to drink up to eight 40-ounce bottles of malt liquor a day and was arrested twice for public intoxication and driving while intoxicated. In 1987 Run-D.M.C. wrote &quot;Christmas in Hollis&quot; for &quot;A Very Special Christmas&quot;. The music video for &quot;Christmas in Hollis&quot; was shot in Hollis, Queens. Run-D.M.C. filmed the video during their 1987 tour. DMC&#x27;s mother made a guest appearance in the video.

In 1997, McDaniels began to develop a deep depression. He became extremely unhappy with the routine of touring and performing, and with being away from his wife and newborn son. He began to rely heavily on prescription drugs and alcohol to ease the pain. While on tour, McDaniels noticed his voice was giving out. He was later diagnosed with spasmodic dysphonia, a vocal disorder which causes involuntary spasms of the larynx muscles. He believes it was caused by the aggressive way in which he performs his lyrics compounded with the years of heavy drinking.
Meanwhile, McDaniels began to have creative differences with his bandmates in Run-D.M.C., which by then, was past its prime as a commercially successful hip-hop group. A longtime fan of artists such as The Beatles, Bob Dylan, and Harry Chapin, McDaniels wanted to move towards a slower, softer sound which suited his now troubled voice. Run wanted to continue with the aggressive, hard rock-edged, sound that the group was known for. These disagreements caused McDaniels to sit out most of the recording of &quot;Crown Royal&quot; (2001). He appeared on only three songs.

Feeling depressed and suicidal, McDaniels heard Sarah McLachlan&#x27;s song &quot;Angel&quot; (1997) on the radio. The song touched McDaniels so deeply that it inspired him to reassess his life and career. He credits McLachlan and her album &quot;Surfacing&quot; (on which &quot;Angel&quot; appeared) with saving his life. With a new outlook on life, McDaniels decided to write his autobiography. While researching his early years, his mother, Bannah, revealed a secret: Darryl had been placed for adoption when he was three months old. According to Bannah, his birth mother was a woman of Dominican descent named Bernada Lovelace. He also learned that he was born in Harlem, Manhattan, not Hollis, Queens, as he had always believed. The news inspired him to search for his birth mother. He began working with the VH1 network on a documentary chronicling his quest. His autobiography, &quot;King of Rock: Respect, Responsibility, and My Life with Run-DMC&quot;, was released in January 2001.

In February 2006, VH1 premiered the documentary, &quot;DMC: My Adoption Journey&quot;. The program ends with McDaniels reuniting with his birth mother, who turned out to be named Berncenia and despite previous beliefs, was not, in fact, of Dominican descent. He thanked her for her choice because, had he not been placed for adoption, Run-D.M.C. would have never existed. In March 2006, McDaniels released his solo album, &quot;Checks Thugs and Rock N Roll&quot;. Produced and Music Directed by Romeo Antonio. The first single, &quot;Just Like Me&quot;, features an interpolation of Harry Chapin&#x27;s &quot;Cat&#x27;s in the Cradle&quot; (1974) performed by McDaniels&#x27; musical savior, Sarah McLachlan. During a recording session, McLachlan revealed to McDaniels that she, too, had been adopted.

McDaniels testified before the New Jersey State Legislature in support of legislation to restore adopted adults&#x27; access to their original birth certificates. The legislation McDaniels supported was signed by Governor Chris Christie and became effective on January 1, 2017. As a New York-born adoptee, however, McDaniels did not have access to his own original birth record; he hired a private investigator to help find his birth family in New York.

McDaniels is featured in the video game &quot;Guitar Hero: Aerosmith&quot; (2008) singing Run-D.M.C.&#x27;s singles &quot;King of Rock&quot; and &quot;Walk This Way&quot;. He is also an unlockable guitarist in the game.

In 2009, McDaniels performed in &quot;The People Speak&quot;, a documentary feature film that uses dramatic and musical performances of the letters, diaries, and speeches of everyday Americans, based on historian Howard Zinn&#x27;s nonfiction book &quot;A People&#x27;s History of the United States&quot; (1980).

McDaniels&#x27; second solo album, the more rock oriented &quot;The Origins Of Block Music&quot;, was due out in mid-2010 but was delayed. In December 2010, McDaniels appeared with Talib Kweli, Mix Master Mike, and Ahmet Zappa on a cover of Frank Zappa&#x27;s &quot;Willie the Pimp&quot; for &quot;The Frank Zappa AAAFNRAAAA Birthday Bundle 2010&quot;.

In 2011, McDaniels joined forces with producer Wade Martin to open the record label IME Records.
In 2014, McDaniels ventured into the comics industry with his own publishing imprint, Darryl Makes Comics. McDaniels explains his lifelong love of the medium thus:

Darryl Makes Comics&#x27; first book is &quot;DMC&quot;, a 90-page anthology graphic novel set in 1985 that features McDaniels as a superhero who confronts both criminals and other superheroes whose recklessness threatens innocent lives. The comic&#x27;s version of DMC wears McDaniels&#x27; signature Adidas sneakers, fedora and rope chain, along with an elongated turtleneck that masks his face. The book is written by McDaniels and Damion Scott, and edited by Darryl Makes Comics&#x27; Editor-in-Chief, Edgardo Miranda-Rodriguez and Senior Editor Rigo &quot;Riggs&quot; Morales. Each chapter in the anthology is illustrated by a different artist, because, as McDaniels explained, &quot;If DMC was really running around and bumped into four different people, they&#x27;d have four different descriptions of what he was like. We wanted each artist&#x27;s work to relate to each character&#x27;s view of DMC. If you saw him, you might say, &quot;He came out of a spaceship and had all these things flying around him!&quot; But then another dude is like, &quot;No! He had a sword and shield!&quot; We thought, if so many people saw something different in DMC, we&#x27;d have to have different artwork to represent their opinions on him or their interpretation on him.&quot; In addition, graffiti writers such as MARE 139 were hired to give the shots of 1985 New York City graffiti a sense of authenticity. The book features an introduction by Greg Pak, a cover by Sal Buscema and Bob Wiacek and interior pinups by Carlos Pacheco, Chris Burnham, ChrisCross, Dexter Vines, and Shelby Robertson, some of which are homages to iconic comics covers that influenced the creative staff as children. &quot;DMC&quot; debuted at the New York Comic Con October 9–12, and was subsequently released in comics shops October 29. The book received a four out of five stars rating by Tony Guerrero of Comic Vine, who lauded the charm and authenticity of the art.

As of January 2015, McDaniels was working with the band Generation Kill on a project, &quot;DMC Generation Kill&quot;, to be produced by former Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Ron &quot;Bumblefoot&quot; Thal.

On the December 17, 2016 Christmas episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, DMC made a cameo appearance during a parody of Run DMC&#x27;s &quot;Christmas in Hollis.&quot; During the sketch, he was portrayed by musical guest Chance the Rapper.

On February 17, 2016, heavy metal band Solus Deus released their EP titled &quot;The Plague&quot;. The song titled &quot;Anacrime&quot; features DMC on guest vocals.

Starting in 2017 and continuing on an ongoing basis, DMC has joined the rock cover supergroup Royal Machines as a guest at their occasional concerts. Joining a revolving cast of celebrities in each lineup, including Dave Navarro, Billy Morrison, Sebastian Bach, Macy Gray, Fred Durst, DMC has performed covers of songs such as &quot;Walk This Way&quot;, &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot;, and &quot;Black Betty&quot; with the band.

On September 15, 2017, Italian rapper Caparezza released his studio album, &quot;Prisoner 709&quot;, which includes the track &quot;Forever Jung&quot; that features DMC on guest vocals. American rapper DeLiverance&#x27;s 2018 single &quot;Slave To The Rhythm&quot; also features DMC on guest vocals.

On August 13, 2018, DMC performed an encore with O.A.R., playing &quot;Walk This Way&quot;.

In February 2021, McDaniels released a song and animated video, &quot;Let&#x27;s All Get the Vaccine,&quot; to encourage the COVID-19 vaccination.

In January 2022, McDaniels released his picture book, &quot;Darryl&#x27;s Dream&quot;, published by Random House.

In January 2024, McDaniels released a cookie brand DMC Cookies. In June 2024, a music video for Fantastic Cat&#x27;s &quot;So Glad You Made It&quot; features McDaniels acting in the role of a music producer.

==Charity work==

The Felix Organization

In 2006, McDaniels and Sheila Jaffe, a fellow adoptee and Emmy award-winning casting director, co-founded The Felix Organization.

Since its inception, The Felix Organization has served more than 10,000 children in the foster care system. Its flagship program, Camp Felix, is an annual sleepaway summer camp in Putnam Valley, New York. Additionally, The Felix Organization sponsors two teen camps on the East Coast. Camp Felix West is for Los Angeles-based youth in foster care.

Other charity work

In September 2006, McDaniels received the Congressional Angels in Adoption award for his work with children in foster care and promotion of adoption. He sits on the Board of Directors of Children&#x27;s Rights, a national watchdog organization that reforms failing child welfare systems.

==Personal life==
McDaniels has been a resident of Wayne, New Jersey. 

McDaniels has openly discussed his history of alcoholism and drug abuse. He has been very frank about his battles with depression, including an appearance on &quot;Live From the Barrage&quot;, speaking at length about it. He also has written pieces in &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; and &quot;BlackDoctor&quot;, where he talked about his memoir, &quot;Ten Ways Not to Commit Suicide&quot; (Amistad, 2017).

<doc id="1038358" wikidata="Q7507230" url="?curid=1038358" title="Sibling Rivalry (The Doobie Brothers album)">
<text>Sibling Rivalry is the twelfth studio album by American rock band The Doobie Brothers. The album was released on October 3, 2000, by Pyramid Records and Rhino Entertainment.

The album was the band&#x27;s first studio recording since &quot;Brotherhood&quot;, in 1991. It was also the only Doobie Brothers studio album to feature a lead vocal by multi-instrumentalist John McFee and full lead vocals by drummer Keith Knudsen, both of whom had rejoined the group in 1993 after an eleven-year absence.

The group photograph in the inner booklet featured touring sidesmen Guy Allison (keyboards, backing vocals), Marc Russo (saxophone) and Skylark (bass, backing vocals). Allison and Russo also featured on the album, the former co-writing three tracks while occasional touring bassist John Cowan also featured and contributed the song &quot;Can&#x27;t Stand to Lose&quot; written with Poco&#x27;s Rusty Young.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; wrote that the band were &quot;struggling vainly to put their formula to work again ... [Michael] McDonald wisely stayed far away.&quot; The &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; deemed the album &quot;vintage soft rock, but not an entirely painful experience.&quot;

<text>Joseph Ward Simmons (born November 14, 1964), better known by the stage name Run, Rev. Run or DJ Run, is an American rapper, producer, DJ, actor and television personality. Simmons is one of the founding members of the influential hip hop group Run-DMC. He is also a practicing minister, known as Reverend Run.

He found new popularity in 2005 with his family&#x27;s MTV reality show &quot;Run&#x27;s House&quot;.

==Early life==
Simmons was born November 14, 1964, in Hollis, Queens, New York. He is the younger brother of artist Danny Simmons and Russell Simmons, the co-founder of Def Jam records.

==Career==
Before Run–D.M.C., Simmons was the lead vocalist in the hip-hop group named &quot;The Force&quot;. He founded Run-D.M.C. as a lead vocalist along with friend Darryl &quot;D.M.C.&quot; McDaniels and the late DJ Jason &quot;Jam-Master Jay&quot; Mizell.

Run began using the stage name of &quot;Rev. Run&quot; after he was ordained as a Pentecostal minister by E. Bernard Jordan, Simmons&#x27;s spiritual mentor. Jordan also named him &quot;Protege of the Year Award&quot; in 2004. The same day, symbolic of his &quot;Prosperity Ministry&quot;, there was a &quot;Rolls-Royce parade outside the Plaza Hotel in New York City, &quot;featuring Jordan&#x27;s Phantom Rolls-Royce. The new $325,000 Phantom had been a gift from Reverend Run as a &quot;thank you&quot; for Jordan&#x27;s mentoring support.

His first work as Rev. Run was a feature in the single &quot;Song 4 Lovers&quot; by UK pop band Liberty X in September 2005. The music video for that song was directed by Bill Schacht for Aestheticom and reached broadcast airplay chart positions of No. 2 Box UK and No. 4 MTV UK with heavy rotation on 5 other music channels in the UK. &quot;Song 4 Lovers&quot; also reached No. 5 on the Official Charts Company&#x27;s UK Top 40 Singles Chart, becoming the band&#x27;s seventh top ten hit.

It was followed by his first solo album, &quot;Distortion&quot;. The first single from the album, &quot;Mind on the Road&quot;, is featured in the EA Sports&#x27;s &quot;Madden NFL 06&quot; video game. &quot;Mind on the Road&quot; uses samples from the song &quot;I Love Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, in the tradition of Run–D.M.C.&#x27;s 1980s hits which use samples like Aerosmith&#x27;s hit &quot;Walk This Way&quot;.

In 2002, he appeared on a special &quot;Rap Stars&quot; edition of &quot;The Weakest Link,&quot; and was the third one voted off.

Rev Run appeared on the MTV series &quot;Run&#x27;s House&quot;, a reality show revolving around his everyday life with his family, from 2005 to 2009.

In 2007, he appeared with his son Diggy Simmons on &quot;My Super Sweet 16&quot; while attending a 16th birthday party for Diddy&#x27;s son, Quincy. Diddy is also the producer of &quot;Run&#x27;s House&quot;.

In 2008, Simmons and his wife Justine teamed up with Kool-Aid and a non-profit organization called KaBOOM! to help build playgrounds in underserved communities. With Kool-Aid, they are helping to build twenty four playgrounds over the course of 2008 and hope to raise awareness for the need for safe play spaces.

On August 5, 2008, Gotham Press published Simmons&#x27; book, &quot;Take Back Your Family: A Challenge to America&#x27;s Parents&quot;, co-authored by his wife, Justine Simmons, and Chris Morrow.

On September 8, 2007, Rev Run was honored as a BMI Icon at the annual BMI Urban Awards.

The weekend of September 17 and 18 of 2011, Rev Run made a special guest appearance at Bay Area Fellowship with Pastor Bil Cornelius in Corpus Christi, Texas Bay Area Fellowship Church.

In October 2011, Rev Run was a special guest of Fellowship Church based out of Grapevine, Texas.

Simmons has also created three other cable series, two premiered in 2014; &quot;Rev Run&#x27;s Renovation&quot; which runs on both the DIY Network and HGTV, and &quot;Rev Run&#x27;s Sunday Suppers&quot; for Cooking Channel, the other Rev Runs Around the World premiered on the Travel Channel in 2016.

==Personal life==
Simmons married Valerie Vaughn in 1983. They have three children: Vanessa Simmons, Angela Simmons, and Joseph &quot;JoJo&quot; Ward Simmons, Jr.

He married Justine Jones on June 25, 1994. With her, he had three more children: Daniel &quot;Diggy&quot; Simmons III, Russell &quot;Russy&quot; Simmons II, and Victoria Anne Simmons. Victoria was four pounds, five ounces when she was delivered via caesarean section. She died shortly after being born on September 26, 2006, due to omphalocele, a birth defect that caused her organs to grow outside her body. The Simmons&#x27; allowed MTV camera crews of &quot;Run&#x27;s House&quot; to document baby Victoria&#x27;s death, telling &quot;People&quot; that &quot;God, in my mind, gave us something to go through in front of America, so we documented it on-camera – not so much to show you sadness, but to show you how we, as ministers, would handle this tragedy. [The kids] found out on-camera. Diggy was waiting to see, &#x27;How&#x27;s Mommy?&#x27; And the first words we said were, &#x27;The baby didn&#x27;t make it.&#x27;&quot; Soon they adopted a baby girl, Miley Justine Simmons.

The Simmons family lives in Saddle River, New Jersey in a six-bedroom colonial-style home that was listed for sale in 2007 for $5.5 million.

In 2017, Simmons said he was adopting vegetarianism because God advised him to.
