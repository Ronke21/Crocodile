<text>Hayley Cropper (also Hayley Patterson) is a fictional character from the British ITV soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, played by Julie Hesmondhalgh. The character first appeared in the episode first broadcast on 26 January 1998. Hayley was the first transgender character in a British soap opera and was the first permanent transgender character in the world of serialised drama. She was married to Roy Cropper (David Neilson). After nearly ten years on the show, Hesmondhalgh decided to take another break for a year in order to spend more time with her family. She left on 22 October 2007 and returned on 17 November 2008. 

Hesmondhalgh won numerous awards for her portrayal of Hayley, but announced her departure from the show on 11 January 2013. Her final scenes were filmed on 18 November 2013 and aired on 22 January 2014. In the episode, Hayley takes her own life, after living with terminal pancreatic cancer. Hesmondhalgh has insisted that it was a &quot;right to die&quot; storyline not &#x27;an assisted suicide&#x27; storyline. Hayley&#x27;s funeral aired on 31 January 2014.

Hesmondhalgh&#x27;s portrayal of Hayley, and her on-screen chemistry with fellow actor David Neilson, encouraged the writers to allow the character to evolve from a brief love interest for Roy to a popular long-term character. Hayley would go on to spend 16 years on &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, always seeing the good in people and nurturing Fiz Brown (Jennie McAlpine) and Becky McDonald (Katherine Kelly) from troubled young women to kind, caring, individuals. In her later years, Hayley formed an unlikely, yet notably close, friendship with Carla Connor (Alison King) and although it was obvious the pair were from completely different walks of life, they came to respect and care for each other.

==Character creation==
=== Casting ===
Initially, it was intended that Hayley would only appear for two months, it was thought that this would help increase ratings as well as show a new side to Roy Cropper (David Neilson). Actor Julie Hesmondhalgh first came to the attention of the casting director while dressed in drag in a production of &#x27;Much Ado About Nothing&#x27;. Hesmondhalgh only knew she was auditioning to play a &quot;fun&quot; character, so arrived &quot;all Bet Lynch, in my leopard skin and red lippy&quot;. When she learned Hayley would be transgender, she was nervous, but &quot;then it dawned on me that this was actually my &#x27;dream job&#x27; and I desperately wanted it.&quot; The character of Hayley Cropper is around four years older than Hesmondhalgh.

===Personality and identity===
&quot;What&#x27;s on TV&quot; describes the character as quiet, and kind-hearted. For a short period of time, after the actor took a one-year break from the show, the producers decided to change her ways. After a brief period of resettlement, she resumed her more familiar temperament of being generally supportive and friendly to the other characters.

==Development==

===Relationships===
Hayley&#x27;s only romantic relationship is with Roy. The characters were first friends and they started a relationship, until Hayley revealed her past history. Roy initially rejected her, but missed their friendship and three months later, followed her to Amsterdam where she was living on a houseboat, recuperating from her surgery. He persuaded her that they should work on their relationship, and as a result, she returned to Weatherfield where she became a machinist in Mike Baldwin&#x27;s (Johnny Briggs) lingerie factory, &quot;Underworld&quot;.

Roy later proposed to Hayley at a fancy-dress disco on St. Valentine&#x27;s Day 1999. At that time, they could not legally marry, since Hayley was still seen as a male in the eyes of the law. Eventually, they found a female vicar who would help them, and they were united in a blessing ceremony held in &quot;Roy&#x27;s Rolls&quot; on 23 April 1999. As a wedding present to Roy, Hayley officially changed her name by deed poll to Hayley Anne Cropper.

Since the passing of the Gender Recognition Act 2004 in UK law, it has been possible for transgender people to change their birth certificates and marry legally. In 2010, following a discussion of the ramifications of their not being legally married, Roy and Hayley decided to make it official. It was revealed that Hayley had applied for, and received, her new birth certificate, and so, after some disagreements about the cost and motives for marriage, the plans were made for the wedding. The couple finally married on 30 August 2010 at a stately home in Cheshire, and almost everyone but the bride arrived by steam train.

Their relationship was tested by various storylines including Tracy Barlow&#x27;s (Kate Ford) deceit, Hayley&#x27;s secret son and Hayley&#x27;s absence from the street. Briefly, upon her return, there was a difficult situation where she had developed a crush on one of her co-workers in Africa (further reading below). They eventually worked out their differences.

=== Pancreatic cancer and suicide ===
On 11 January 2013, it was announced that Hesmondhalgh would leave &quot;Coronation Street&quot; at the end of her contract. The actress recorded her final scenes on 18 November 2013, being screened on 20 January 2014, and the producers came up with a dramatic exit storyline for her character. Hesmondhalgh revealed that she wanted to pursue new projects, saying &quot;I&#x27;ve had the most wonderful and happy time in the life changing 15/16 years I&#x27;ve been in Corrie, and I owe so much to the show and the special team that make it happen. The decision to hang up Hayley&#x27;s red anorak was a tough one, but doing the play at the Royal Exchange last year made me realise that there&#x27;s life in the old dog yet (!) and that there are other things I want to try.&quot; Hayley&#x27;s exit storyline saw her diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer. On 20 January 2014, Hayley died in Roy&#x27;s arms after drinking a lethal cocktail. The episode attracted 9.7 million viewers – the show&#x27;s highest figure in almost a year.

==Storylines==
Hayley Patterson is a shy shop supervisor at Firman&#x27;s Freezers. Her friend and colleague Alma Baldwin (Amanda Barrie) introduced her to Roy Cropper (David Neilson) and they became friends — until Hayley told him that she was transgender and used to be called Harold. Roy cannot cope and initially rejects her but realises that their friendship is more important than Hayley&#x27;s secret. After affirming their mutual attraction, Hayley goes to Amsterdam for private gender reassignment surgery. When she returns to Weatherfield, she starts work at Underworld. Hayley chooses not to disclose her transgender status, but she is forcibly outed when Alma&#x27;s husband and factory boss Mike discovers a Tax Office error, showing her deadname. Mike fires her as a result. Although the factory staff and Street residents initially taunt her, she eventually gets her job back and most Street residents gradually accept her.

In 2001, Roy and Hayley decide to become foster parents. Their first child is teenager Fiz Brown (Jennie McAlpine), who returns to care after falsely claiming that Roy hit her. Fiz returns later that year and becomes good friends with Roy and Hayley. The couple then foster a young boy, Wayne Hayes (Gary Damer), but go on the run with him, wanting to protect him from his abusive stepfather. They are arrested for kidnap and Hayley is held on remand for objecting to her bail conditions but is released when Wayne&#x27;s mother makes a statement about her marriage. This prevents Roy and Hayley fostering, or working with, any more young people.

In 2003, while Hayley is away, nursing her sick aunt, scheming Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) bets Bev Unwin (Susie Blake) that she can bed the man supposedly least likely to be unfaithful — Roy. Tracy drugs Roy at Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) and Shelley Unwin&#x27;s (Sally Lindsay) wedding reception and claims to have slept with him. Roy is desperate to keep this from Hayley but breaks down and admits everything. When confronting Tracy, the Croppers are stunned when Tracy tells them that she is pregnant with Roy&#x27;s baby and plans to have a termination if the Croppers do not want to adopt it. Roy and Hayley see an opportunity to raise a child and pay Tracy £25,000. The Croppers&#x27; relationship becomes increasingly strained, including a suicide attempt by Roy, but they pull through. Roy gets suspicious when Tracy goes on holiday for 3 weeks and realizing how easy it would be for Tracy to disappear with the cash and the baby, Roy insists she marry him (giving him parental responsibility of the baby) or the deal is off. She agrees and they marry. After the baby is born, Tracy admits to Peter that Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) is the father (they had a one-night stand shortly before she spent the night with Roy). The baby&#x27;s true paternity is revealed at Steve&#x27;s wedding to Karen (Suranne Jones), when Tracy demands that baby Patience be returned to her and the Croppers, heartbroken, do so and Tracy repays the cash to Roy and Hayley. Steve and Karen marry, despite Tracy&#x27;s bombshell, and Karen gets her revenge by gatecrashing the christening. Patience Cropper is renamed Amy Barlow and the Croppers are her godparents.

Following the death of her aunt Monica in September 2007, Hayley discovers that she has a son, Christian Gatley (Andrew Turner). She hires a private investigator to track him down and introduces herself as his aunt. Roy confronts Hayley when he sees money has been withdrawn from their joint bank account and she tells Roy everything. Disapproving of lies, Roy insists Hayley tell Christian the truth about how they are related and Hayley does but Christian does not react well and storms off. When Hayley finds him later, Christian is still angry and punches her when she refuses to leave him alone. On her return to the café, she makes it clear that she blames Roy and this causes problems. They decide to go camping in a bid to mend their issues. Following this, in October 2007, Hayley leaves the Street to go on volunteer work in Mozambique for a year.

Hayley returns in November 2008; it is clear that she is not entirely happy, appearing evasive and she tells Roy that she wants to return to her charity work, as she has fallen for Olaf, the project team leader. When catching up with Tilly, another volunteer, she learns Olaf is not the man she thought he was and decides to stay with Roy. She decides not to return to &quot;Underworld&quot; and wants to become a social worker but her police record (for the abduction of Wayne in 2001), rules her ineligible to work with children. She works in the café and then becomes supervisor at the factory in 2009.

In May 2010, Hayley and Roy argue when she suggests that they have a lavish wedding, now that the law has changed and their union can now be officially recognised. Roy agrees but he is more concerned with inheritance law, upsetting Hayley, so she moves in with friend Anna Windass (Debbie Rush). On 1 June 2010, Robbie Sloan (James Fleet) tricks Hayley to go to the factory, telling her that Carla Connor (Alison King) has had an accident, when in reality, Robbie has tied Carla to a chair and duct taped her mouth shut. Once there, Hayley sees Carla bound and gagged but Robbie pulls out a gun on her before she can escape, and ties her to a chair too. Killer Tony Gordon (Gray O&#x27;Brien) arrives, takes the gag off Carla&#x27;s mouth and threatens them, revealing that Hayley is there as revenge against Roy, who convinced Tony to confess his crimes to the police, and says he will kill her and Carla. After Maria Connor (Samia Ghadie) accidentally interrupts and raises the alarm, Roy rushes to &quot;Underworld&quot; but can not help her, while Carla pleads with Tony to let Hayley go – Tony eventually relents and throws Hayley out. She is taken care of by paramedics and she and Roy tell one another they love each other before watching the factory blow up, after Tony sets fire to the building, killing himself but Carla manages to untie herself and escapes.

Later that week, Roy proposes to Hayley and she accepts. Mary Taylor (Patti Clare) intervenes in the wedding preparations and, after weeks of muscling in, Hayley and Roy tell her they do not want her to be a part of the wedding, despite Hayley wearing her vintage wedding dress. On 30 August 2010, the train carriage that Hayley and bridesmaids Fiz and Becky (Katherine Kelly) decouples from the steam train that is transporting the groom and wedding guests to the venue, due to Mary&#x27;s meddling. However, they do get to the venue on time and Hayley marries Roy. In June 2011, Roy&#x27;s mother Sylvia Goodwin (Stephanie Cole) – who moved in with the Croppers&#x27; earlier in the year – is suspicious when, after expressing a longing for grandchildren, she finds out Hayley cannot have children. After rummaging through her things, she finds a prescription for some hormone tablets and assumes Hayley is menopausal until Tracy tells her that Hayley used to be a man. Sylvia is initially outraged but, as of July 2011, appears to be coming round and accepts Hayley for who she is.

Hayley is heartbroken when Becky decides to leave Weatherfield in January 2012 but gets a call a few months later, telling her that she is engaged to her new boyfriend. Later in the year, Roy and Hayley visit Palm Springs, California to visit Sylvia and her companion Milton Fanshaw (Robert Vaughn). Roy returns without Hayley, who is caring for Sylvia as she isn&#x27;t well. Hayley returns later that year and supports Roy when they discover that his father died in May 2013. Strange happenings begin occurring in the café and Roy thinks Beth Tinker (Lisa George) and her family are responsible. Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride) finds Roy sleepwalking on the Red Rec and returns him to Hayley and Sylvia. They watch the CCTV footage and it proves that Roy is behind all of the rearranged furniture. Hayley decides that Roy should see a doctor and tells him she will have the same tests done, which Roy finds comfort in. Hayley is called back to the Medical Centre the following week and the doctor tells Hayley that she has abnormal liver function and needs an ultrasound scan for further investigation. Hayley confides in Sylvia on the day of her scan but swears her to secrecy. The doctor tells Hayley that there is a blockage in her bile duct and Hayley tells Sylvia that she may have cancer and breaks down in her arms. The following week, Carla insists on going with Hayley for a CT scan where Hayley is diagnosed with stage-two pancreatic cancer. She is told she needs an operation and chemotherapy to get rid of the cancer. Later, Hayley breaks down at work and Carla comforts her. Hayley realises that she has to tell Roy so goes home and tells Roy and Sylvia. When Sylvia leaves Roy and Hayley alone, Roy holds Hayley&#x27;s hand and starts pestering Hayley to drink herbal tea, so she confides in Carla again. Hayley goes for the operation to unblock her bile duct, accompanied by Roy. Hayley does well and is invited to Audrey Roberts&#x27; (Sue Nicholls) birthday party at the Bistro. Hayley and Sylvia go but Hayley is devastated when Roy tells everyone that she has pancreatic cancer. Upset, Hayley runs home and is followed by Sylvia. Later, Roy tells her that he wishes that he could halve her pain and Hayley tells him that she could die and the pair embrace passionately. When Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) and her half-sister Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley), argue at the factory, Leanne pushes Eva into Hayley, so Carla throws Leanne out. Hayley gets fed up with people being sympathetic so she and Roy go on holiday before her operation to remove her tumour. Carla gives Hayley some time off and Mary lends them her motor home. Hayley and Roy return a couple of weeks later and learn that Sylvia has gone to live with her sister, Roy&#x27;s aunt Jean.

Roy organises a romantic dinner for their third wedding anniversary but Hayley is upset as she completely forgot. Roy then assures Hayley that he is not angry, and she confides in Carla before going to the hospital, preparing for her operation. Roy and Hayley are told that the operation – if successful – should last six hours. Hayley goes down to theatre at 13:05 and gives Roy her wedding ring to look after. Roy is devastated when the consultant tells Roy and Hayley that her cancer is terminal. He says she could live up to about six months to a year. Devastated but philosophical, Hayley begins to make a of everything that she wants to do before she dies, one of which is teaching Roy how to drive. Hayley has a nightmare about being &quot;Harold&quot; again, making her regret the way things ended with her son, Christian. She decides to tell Fiz about Christian, confusing Roy but he comes round to the idea of Hayley contacting Christian, so she leaves a message on his mobile. While waiting for him to call back, she focuses on throwing a birthday party for Roy in The Rovers. She goes with Roy to his driving lesson, which was a disaster. Hayley gets a message from Christian, wanting to meet in a café in Bury. Roy goes with Hayley but Christian sends her a text, saying that he cannot go through with it. Roy and Hayley take Fiz&#x27;s daughter, Hope, and Tyrone Dobbs&#x27; (Alan Halsall) baby girl Ruby to the park, Christian arrives and asks Anna where Hayley is. He decides to call her but she left her phone behind. Christian decides to wait and they talk but Hayley decides to take Roy and Christian to The Rovers, where Christian reveals that he is married and has two children, Sam and Maisie. Hayley says she would love to meet them but Christian wants to wait until they are 16 years of age, upsetting Hayley. Christian repeatedly makes inappropriate remarks unintentionally so Roy shouts at him, before taking Hayley home. Hayley insists that they attend a cancer support group, where they meet Jane Rayner (Heather Bleasdale) and her husband Jeff (Jim Millea). Hayley is inspired by Jane&#x27;s strength and confidence, despite dying from pancreatic cancer, but Roy tells Hayley that he found her highly inappropriate and inconsiderate. Hayley is delighted to learn that Roy has booked a day off so they can go to Blackpool. They have a wonderful time but their joy is cut short when they are told that Jane has been rushed to a hospice.

The couple visit and Hayley is shocked to see how dazed Jane is after taking morphine. Hayley and Roy then sit down as talk about Hayley&#x27;s final days, where she tells Roy that she intends to end her own life when the cancer spreads. This causes an argument and Hayley moves in with Fiz and Tyrone. The following day, Hayley collapses and Fiz calls an ambulance to take Hayley to hospital. Roy and Fiz go too. At the hospital, the consultant explains that Hayley has an infection and needs to stay overnight. While Hayley is recovering, Roy accidentally tells Anna about her suicide wish. When she comes home, she is stunned to find Roy, Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies) and Gary Windass (Mikey North) re-decorating their bedroom. Hayley secretly does not like the new wallpaper but keeps quiet so she does not upset Roy. Hayley insists on visiting Jane in the hospice and Jeff reveals that Jane has died. Hayley is devastated and furious with Roy. The pair argue again about the way Hayley wants to die. A few days later, Roy and Hayley attend Jane&#x27;s funeral and meet her young sons, Zac and Henry. Hayley tries to comfort Henry as he is not coping. After the funeral, Roy tells Hayley that he thinks he can accept her suicide plot. Hayley is delighted but Roy tells Anna that he lied and feels he has betrayed her. Roy decides not to tell Hayley his true feelings and they listen to music together after a stressful day. Hayley later breaks down in Roy&#x27;s arms, saying that she does not want to die and does not want to leave him. Hayley is delighted when asked by Carla to make her wedding dress. The dress is a success and Roy and Hayley attend Carla and Peter&#x27;s wedding. While there, Christian returns to the street and winds Fiz up about Hayley so she tells him that Hayley has cancer in an angry outburst. On getting home, Hayley is stunned to see Christian and tells him that she is too tired but will see him another time. The following day, Christian visits again and Hayley is astonished when Christian says she can see the children. Hayley is thrilled but Christian demands Hayley give him money in return as he is in a lot of debt. Christian brings Sam and Maisie to the café and Maisie is intrigued by Roy&#x27;s train collection, while Hayley and Christian talk upstairs. Hayley is shocked when Christian turns violent and starts pushing her for the money. She subsequently writes him a cheque. Maisie, however, tells her that she hopes she gets better soon and that she would love to come again. Fiz takes Hayley and Roy to The Rovers and Hayley tells them that she gave Christian the money. In December, Roy and Hayley go to a hospital appointment where she tells the nurse that her pain is getting worse and she is prescribed with stronger painkillers.

Hayley and Roy enjoy their last Christmas together. They buy each other gifts and want to be alone, but the day is interrupted by visits from friends and neighbours. Hayley enjoys their company, but after Fiz and Tyrone arrive with their young children, Hayley finds herself falling asleep. After a nap, Hayley is determined to go to The Rovers for a Christmas drink, but Roy wants her to take it easy. Later that week, Roy and Hayley go to a hospital appointment following her scan and learn that the cancer is a lot more aggressive than anticipated, meaning Hayley only has weeks left to live. Hayley takes her frustration out on the Christmas tree, wrecking Hope&#x27;s decoration. The following day, Hayley tells Roy to let a few people know that she only has weeks left but does not want visitors. Roy breaks the news to Anna, Fiz, Tyrone, Peter, Carla, Rita Tanner (Barbara Knox) and Dennis Tanner (Philip Lowrie). Carla is determined to visit Hayley and she is glad that Carla came. She confides in her, telling her that she is frightened of dying. When Carla returns home, she breaks down after seeing Hayley in such a state. In her final week, Tyrone takes Hayley to the salon for a makeover although Roy wanted her to stay at home and rest. On 20 January 2014, she tells Roy she wants to die that day and whilst Roy is in The Kabin, Hayley irons his best shirt for her funeral. Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) notices that Roy is even more unhappy than usual, and asks if he is alright, but he claims to be fine. Roy arrives back at the café and is confronted by Gloria Price (Sue Johnston) with &quot;customer feedback&quot;. Hayley begins to write letters for Tyrone and Fiz&#x27;s children, but stops when she realises Hope and Ruby will not remember her, as they are too young. Roy tries one last time to stop Hayley but she is adamant. Roy makes sure that she is comfortable and selects a piece of music that they both like. Hayley tells Roy that he must not touch the glass containing the lethal cocktail. Prepared to drink the cocktail, Hayley is interrupted by Tyrone who is looking for Ruby&#x27;s toy. Roy plays &quot;The Lark Ascending&quot; by Vaughan Williams, and sits on the bed with Hayley. After one last moment together, she drinks the cocktail. Worried something is not right, Anna closes the café and sits downstairs and Carla knocks on the door, demanding to see Hayley. Anna lets her in and tries to stop Carla knocking on the flat door, but she does. There is no answer, so Anna eventually unlocks the door with her spare key and they enter the flat together. Calling out, Anna and Carla go to the bedroom and, to their shock, find a deceased Hayley on the bed, with Roy&#x27;s arm around her. Hayley is later cremated following a humanist funeral.

== Reception ==

For her portrayal of Hayley, Hesmondhalgh was nominated in the category of &quot;Most Popular Actress&quot; at the 1999 National Television Awards. The appearance of a transgender woman in a mainstream soap opera attracted initial opposition from some members of the public, as expressed in calls to the Granada duty office, and letters written to magazines and newspapers. A minority of people expressed their concern at having such &quot;bizarreness&quot; brought into their homes on a prime-time show. Transgender groups were also largely unhappy with the storyline, and found Hayley&#x27;s original character traits, as written, clichéd and ill-informed. Press for Change, the transgender campaign and information group, were particularly concerned with the direction of the storyline, but after the first two months a trans advisor connected to Press for Change, Annie Wallace, was regularly consulted for eighteen months by scriptwriters and the actor, and trans groups appeared happier with the stories and scripts that resulted from this liaison. In an interview with Hesmondhalgh in August 2015, it was revealed that in tribute to Wallace, the writers gave Hayley&#x27;s middle name as Anne, and gave her the same birthday, as well as a mutual love for rock music, especially Queen. Wallace is now an actress in her own right, and appears as the character Sally St. Claire in the Channel 4 soap opera, &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;.

Transgender campaigners were initially upset that a cisgender woman had been chosen for the part but later praised Hesmondhalgh&#x27;s dedication and sensitivity. Hayley was, for many viewers, the first transgender woman whose story they had seen unfold on TV. Hesmondhalgh has become an outspoken activist for trans rights, including becoming the first Friend of campaign group Trans Media Watch and as Hayley, she has heralded a new level of acceptance among people across the country. The official LGBT History Month website includes Hayley as one of the important famous LGBT people in their history, even though she is a fictional character.

In 2008, &quot;All About Soap&quot; included Hayley&#x27;s transgender plot in their list of &quot;top ten taboo&quot; storylines of all time. Their writer described it as one of the &quot;taboos which have bravely been broken by soaps.&quot;

On 22 January 2014, Hesmondhalgh won &quot;Best Serial Drama Performance&quot; at the National Television Awards. Also in 2014, Hesmondhalgh was nominated for the &quot;Best Actress&quot; award at The British Soap Awards. As well as being nominated for the &quot;Best Actress&quot; award, Hesmondhalgh&#x27;s final appearance, entitled &quot;Hayley&#x27;s Death&quot;, was nominated for the &quot;Best Single Episode&quot; award, as well. Hesmondhalgh won both of these awards. Hesmondhalgh also won &quot;Best On-screen partnership&quot; and &quot;Best Storyline&quot; – both alongside David Neilson – at the ceremony.

=== Political impact ===
&quot;Coronation Street&quot; handling of transgender issues, the uncertainty of whether her partner would accept her gender identity and the inability of transgender people to adopt children or marry, has been praised by transgender groups. An Early Day Motion was also tabled in Parliament by Lynne Jones, MP, praising the story team and researchers, and Julie Hesmondhalgh for her portrayal.

Following the screening of the &quot;wedding&quot; in 1999, the Labour Government announced that a Parliamentary Working Group was being created to assess how the United Kingdom could grant trans people the legal rights for which they had fought for decades. The result of this was the tabling, in 2004, of the Gender Recognition Act, granting trans people full legal status in their acquired sex. It has been said that the character of Hayley deserves partial credit for bringing the issues faced by trans people to public attention in a sympathetic manner, rather than the sensationalist coverage that had previously existed. It is also alleged that the resultant public support for this fictional character went in favour of the Bill.

<doc id="1020073" wikidata="Q654228" url="?curid=1020073" title="Material Girl">
<text>&quot;Material Girl&quot; is a song recorded by American singer Madonna for her second studio album, &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; (1984). It was released on January 23, 1985, by the Sire label as the second single from &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;. It also appears slightly remixed on the 1990 greatest hits compilation, &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot;, in its original form on the 2009 greatest hits compilation, &quot;Celebration&quot; and &quot;Finally Enough Love: 50 Number Ones&quot; (2022). The song was written by Peter Brown and Robert Rans, and produced by Nile Rodgers. Madonna said the concept of the song was indicative of her life at that time, and she liked it because she felt it was provocative.

&quot;Material Girl&quot; consists of synthesizer arrangements with a robotic-sounding voice chant repeating the hook, &quot;living in a material world&quot;. The lyrics identify with materialism, with Madonna asking for a rich and affluent life, and only wanting to date men who can offer her this. Contemporary critics have frequently identified &quot;Material Girl&quot; along with &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; as the songs that established Madonna as an icon. &quot;Material Girl&quot; was a commercial success, reaching the top-five in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Ireland, Japan and United Kingdom. It reached the number two position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the United States, becoming her third top-five single there.

The single&#x27;s release was accompanied by a music video directed by Mary Lambert. The video pays homage to Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s performance of the song &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot; in the 1953 film &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot;, with the mimicked scenes interspersed with scenes of a Hollywood director trying to win the heart of an actress, played by Madonna herself. Discovering that, contrary to her song, the young woman is not impressed by money and expensive gifts, he pretends to be penniless and succeeds in taking her out on a date. Madonna has performed the song in five of her world tours; most of her performances of the song on tour are mimicries of the song&#x27;s music video.

&quot;Material Girl&quot; has been covered by a number of artists, including Britney Spears and Hilary and Haylie Duff. It also became a viral hit on TikTok. Madonna has often remarked that she regrets recording &quot;Material Girl&quot; as its title became a nickname for her in the mainstream media. The song has been labeled an empowering influence for women, and was the subject of debates.

==Background==
&quot;Material Girl&quot; was written by Peter Brown and Robert Rans, while Nile Rodgers produced the track. In 1986, Madonna told &quot;Company&quot; magazine, that although she did not write or create the song, the lyrical meaning and concept did apply to her situation at that point of time. She elaborated, &quot;I&#x27;m very career-oriented. You are attracted to people who are ambitious that way, too, like in the song &#x27;Material Girl&#x27;. You are attracted to men who have material things because that&#x27;s what pays the rents and buys you furs. That&#x27;s the security. That lasts longer than emotions.&quot; During a 2009 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Madonna was asked by interviewer Austin Scaggs, regarding her first feelings, after listening to the demos of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; and &quot;Material Girl&quot;. Madonna responded by saying, &quot;I liked them both because they were ironic and provocative at the same time but also unlike me. I am not a materialistic person, and I certainly wasn&#x27;t a virgin, and, by the way, how can you be &quot;like a virgin&quot;? I liked the play on words, I thought they were clever. They&#x27;re so geeky, they&#x27;re cool.&quot;

==Composition==

&quot;Material Girl&quot; consists of synth arrangements, with a strong backbeat supporting it. A robotic-sounding male voice, sung by Frank Simms, repeats the hook &quot;Living in a material world&quot;. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, the song is set in the time signature of common time, with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is set in the key of C major, with Madonna&#x27;s voice spanning from the tonal nodes of C4 to C5. The song has a basic chord progression of F–G–Em–Am-F-G-C in the chorus, while the verses are based on the C mixolydian mode, giving a hip, swing-like mood. With its post-disco style, the beat of the song is reminiscent of the Jacksons&#x27; &quot;Can You Feel It&quot;, which appeared on their 1980 album &quot;Triumph&quot;.

The lyrics explain that Madonna is a &quot;material girl&quot; who will not accept men who cannot provide her with luxuries.

==Critical reception==
Following the song&#x27;s release on November 30, 1984, as the second single from &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, &quot;Material Girl&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics. Author Rikky Rooksby, in his book &quot;The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna&quot;, compared the song with those of Cyndi Lauper because of Madonna&#x27;s shrill voice in the song. He added that the song was a &quot;pungent satire on the Reagan/Thatcher young-guns-go-for-it era. Which just goes to show that pop music and irony don&#x27;t mix.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic said that &quot;Material Girl&quot; was one of the songs that made Madonna an icon, the other being &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; from the same album, both remaining as a definitive statement. He added that both tunes overshadow the rest of the record, &quot;because they are a perfect match of theme and sound.&quot; Debby Miller from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, felt that the song portrayed Madonna as a more practical girl than previous female singers. Dave Karger from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, while reviewing the album in 1995, felt that the song came off a bit repetitious and immature when compared to the present context. Jim Farber from the same publication felt that the song provided then critics a way to criticize Madonna&#x27;s work. Sal Cinquemani of&quot; Slant Magazine&quot; commented that Madonna had &quot;defined a generation with hits like &#x27;Material Girl&#x27;.&quot; Alfred Soto from &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; compared the song with &quot;Everything She Wants&quot; by Wham!. Michael Paoletta from &quot;Billboard&quot; commented that the song sustained a &quot;fevered dance-rock momentum.&quot; Nancy Erlick from &quot;Billboard&quot; said that &quot;singer and team conquer once more with their irresistible assembly of new and used pop hooks.&quot; &quot;Cashbox&quot; said that the song is &quot;a playful follow-up to &#x27;Like A Virgin which &quot;still emphasizes a danceable backbeat, but...has a sense of humor and Madonna doesn&#x27;t sound quite as squeaky as on past cuts.&quot; In 2003, Madonna fans were asked to vote for their Top 20 Madonna singles of all time for a special issue of &quot;Q magazine&quot; dedicated to Madonna. &quot;Material Girl&quot; was allocated the 15th spot on the list.

==Chart performance==
The song debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 during the week of February 9, 1985, at position 43, when &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; was descending out of the top ten. The single climbed the Hot 100 quickly, jumping 13 spots to number five the week of March 9, 1985, and eventually spent two weeks at number two, held off by REO Speedwagon&#x27;s &quot;Can&#x27;t Fight This Feeling&quot; and Phil Collins&#x27; &quot;One More Night&quot;. The week when the song slipped to position three, her upcoming single &quot;Crazy for You&quot; reached number four, giving Madonna two simultaneous top-five hits. &quot;Material Girl&quot; reached the top of the Hot Dance Club Songs but was less successful on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, failing to enter the top 40 and peaking at number 49. It was placed at number 58 on the year-end chart for 1985, with Madonna becoming the top pop artist for the year. In Canada, the song debuted on the &quot;RPM&quot; Singles Chart at number 76, on the issue dated February 16, 1985. After five weeks, it reached a peak position of four on the chart and was present on the chart for a total of 21 weeks. It was ranked at number 46 on the &quot;RPM&quot; Year-End chart for 1985.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;Material Girl&quot; debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number 24 on March 2, 1985, and reached a peak position of number three. It was present for a total of ten weeks on the chart. In August 2023, The song was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry, for sales and streams exceeding 600,000 units. According to the Official Charts Company, the song has sold 405,000 copies there. Across Europe, the song reached the top-ten in Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Netherlands, Spain and the Eurochart Hot 100 Singles, while reaching the top 40 of Germany, Italy and Switzerland.

In Australia, the single debuted at number 25 on 17 March 1985 and peaked at number four three weeks later. It also reached the Top 5 in New Zealand and Japan.

==Music video==

The music video was inspired by Madonna&#x27;s admiration of Marilyn Monroe and mimicked the latter&#x27;s performance of the song &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot; from the 1953 film &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot;. The video was developed to simultaneously be an exegesis and a critique of the lyrics and Madonna herself. It was the first time Madonna was able to showcase her acting ability to the public, combining the dance routines of &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot; with the storyline of a man who impresses Madonna with daisies, rather than diamonds. In a 1987 interview with &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, Madonna said:

Well, my favorite scene in all of Monroe&#x27;s movies is when she does that dance sequence for &#x27;Diamonds Are a Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&#x27;. And when it came time to do the video for the song [Material Girl], I said, I can just redo that whole scene and it will be perfect. [...] Marilyn was made into something not human in a way, and I can relate to that. Her sexuality was something everyone was obsessed with and that I can relate to. And there were certain things about her vulnerability that I&#x27;m curious about and attracted to.
The music video was shot January 10 and 11, 1985, at Ren-Mar Studios in Hollywood, California, and was directed by Mary Lambert; Lambert had previously directed the videos for &quot;Borderline&quot; and &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;. It was produced by Simon Fields with principal photography by Peter Sinclair, editing by Glenn Morgan and choreography by Kenny Ortega. Much of the jewelry is from the collection of Connie Parente, a popular Hollywood jewelry collector.

The video featured actor Keith Carradine as Madonna&#x27;s wealthy love interest. According to Carradine, Madonna had asked for him to appear in the video. Actor Robert Wuhl appeared in the video&#x27;s opening sequence as George, an employee of Carradine&#x27;s character. It was on the set of the video that Madonna met actor Sean Penn, whom she began a relationship with and married eight months later.

The video opens with two men (Carradine) watching a rush in the screening rooms of a Hollywood studio. On the screen, an actress played by Madonna sings and dances to &quot;Material Girl&quot;, dressed like Monroe from &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;. One of the men, played by Carradine, is a director or a producer and is immensely rich. He falls in love with the actress and wants to express his passion for her. He tells his employee, played by Wuhl: &quot;She&#x27;s [Madonna] fantastic. She could become a star.&quot; The employee answered: &quot;She could be. She could be great. She could be a major star.&quot; The former then concludes by saying: &quot;She &quot;is&quot; a star, George.&quot; Madonna is in a pink strapless gown and has her hair in blond locks ala Monroe. The background is a reconstruction of the Monroe video, complete with staircase, chandeliers and a number of tuxedo clad chorus boys. Madonna dances and sings the song, while she is showered with cash, expensive jewelry, furs and is carried by the men over the stairs. At one time, she eludes herself from the men, by dismissing them with her fan. As the producer tries to impress Madonna, he comes to learn she is not impressed by material items, rather preferring simple romance. He pretends to be penniless, and brings her hand-cut flowers while paying a poor man a large amount to borrow (or possibly buy) his dirty truck to take her on a date. His plan seems to work, because the final scene shows him and Madonna kissing in an intimate position.

It was in the video of &quot;Material Girl&quot; that Madonna began to accept and utilize herself being compared to Monroe. However, she established a safe distance from those comparisons and developed inside the same pastiche. Details like the usage of different gloves or different fans in the video brought forth the connections between these women, but Madonna alluded to herself in subtle ways. The fan in Monroe&#x27;s hand for the original video was an iconography of the Sudarshana Chakra (wheel) held by the Indian idol Vishnu. Scholar Georges-Claude Guilbert, who wrote &quot;Madonna as postmodern myth: how one star&#x27;s self-construction rewrites sex&quot;, said that the fan symbolized fiery desire aroused by Monroe as well as ritual sacrifice, eerily foreshadowing her untimely death in 1962. Madonna&#x27;s fan, which appeared at the end of the video, signified that Madonna – while paying her tribute to Monroe – was signaling that she had no intention of being a victim like her, and that she was on the path of becoming a feminist post-modern myth. Author Nicholas Cook commented that the video promoted Madonna&#x27;s identity as the song suggested, with the purpose of shifting &quot;Madonna&#x27;s image from that of a disco-bimbo to authentic star.&quot; Lisa A. Lewis, author of &quot;Gender, Politics and MTV&quot; said that with the video, Madonna achieved the rare distinction of being accepted as a literature medium by the music authors. &quot;Material Girl&quot; was nominated for best female video at the 1985 MTV Video Music Awards, but lost to Tina Turner&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot;. The video was ranked at position 54 on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Videos. On YouTube, the video became her ninth video to surpass 100 million views.

==Live performances==

&quot;Material Girl&quot; was performed by Madonna on five of her world tours. She ended the Virgin Tour (1985) with a self-parodying performance of the song. She wore a white tube top and a tight white skirt and carried a bunch of notes in her left hand. At the end of the performance she asked the audience &quot;Do you really think I&#x27;m a material girl?...I&#x27;m not...Take it [Throwing fake money]... I don&#x27;t need money... I need love.&quot; As she began to strip off more clothes, she was apprehended and marched offstage by an extra posing as her father. In Detroit, her father Tony himself did the honors. The performance was included in the VHS release &quot;Madonna Live: The Virgin Tour&quot;.

In the Who&#x27;s That Girl World Tour of 1987, Madonna performed it as a medley with &quot;Dress You Up&quot; and &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;. She wore an elaborate costume, inspired by Dame Edna Everage. It consisted of a hat strewn with fake fruits, flowers and feathers, jeweled batwing spectacles with heavy, black frames, a ruffled skirt, a bodice covered with objects like watches and dolls and fishnets. Author Carol Clrek stated that the dress was more &quot;ludicrous for Madonna, than humorous.&quot; Two different performances of the song on this tour can be found on the videos: &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl: Live in Japan&quot;, filmed in Tokyo, Japan, on June 22, 1987, and &quot;Ciao Italia: Live from Italy&quot;, filmed in Turin, Italy, on September 4, 1987.

For the Blond Ambition World Tour in 1990, Madonna and her supporting dancers Niki Haris and Donna De Lory were dressed as old women in fluffy dressing gowns with dollar signs and curling pins in their hair. Singing the song with a strong mid-western accent, they got up and revealed a frivolish pink dress underneath their gown, in which they danced around. On some dates Madonna replaced the words &quot;experience has made me rich&quot; with &quot;experience has made me a bitch&quot;. After singing, she produced dollar bills out of her corsage and threw them up in the air for the audience to catch. Two different performances were taped and released on video, &quot;Blond Ambition: Japan Tour 90&quot;, taped in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and &quot;Blond Ambition World Tour Live&quot;, taped in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990. During the Re-Invention World Tour of 2004, a general setlist was decided where the show rehearsals would start with &quot;I&#x27;m So Stupid&quot; from &quot;American Life&quot;, &quot;Dress You Up&quot; and &quot;Material Girl&quot;. But &quot;Dress You Up&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m So Stupid&quot; were later dropped from the show. Hence &quot;Material Girl&quot; was transferred as the closing song of the military segment of the show, and was re-arranged as an electric guitar version. Madonna wore military themed clothes and sang the song while standing in front of a microphone and playing an electric guitar. The backdrops displayed mathematical equations along with DNA helixes rushing through the screens.

Minimal elements of the song were included in the live performance of &quot;Girl Gone Wild&quot; on the MDNA Tour (2012). &quot;Material Girl&quot; was included in the final section of the Rebel Heart Tour (2015–16). For this section, Madonna worked with designer Jeremy Scott for party inspired costumes. She wanted a &quot;Harlem-flapper-meets-Paris-in-the-Twenties&quot; look, and Scott came up with the final dress adorned with thousands of Swarovski crystals. Following the jazz rendition of 2000 single &quot;Music&quot;, Madonna&#x27;s started performing &quot;Material Girl&quot;, in a similar theme like the music video. Towards the end, Madonna changed the choreography, and made her dancers who posed as suitors fall down the stairs instead. The performance ended with Madonna walking down the catwalk in a bridal veil and carrying a white bouquet, which she eventually throws into the crowd. Utsing the stage as both stairs as well as video backdrop, the stairs rose up and down during the song. A recording of the performance at the March 19–20, 2016 shows in Sydney&#x27;s Allphones Arena was released in Madonna&#x27;s fifth live album, &quot;Rebel Heart Tour&quot;.

In June 2022, to accompany the remix album release &quot;Finally Enough Love: 50 Number Ones&quot;, Madonna performed at Pride at the Women of the World Party in New York City. In the event, she premiered &quot;Material Gworrllllllll!&quot;, a mashup of &quot;Material Girl&quot; with Saucy Santana&#x27;s hip hop song of the same name. The song was released the following month.

==Legacy==

After the song&#x27;s release, the phrase &quot;material girl&quot; became another nickname for Madonna. She has since remarked that if she had known she would constantly be referred to by the &quot;Material Girl&quot; moniker, she probably would not have recorded the song. Reflecting on the song, Madonna said:

Guilbert commented that &quot;material girl&quot; designated a certain type of liberated women, thus deviating from its original coinage which meant a girl who is tangible and accessible. Cook said that the meaning and impact of &quot;material girl&quot; was no longer circumscribed by the video, rather by its lyrics. Its influence was seen later among such diverse groups such as female versus male, gay versus straight, and academic versus teenage.

In 1993, a conference was held at the University of California, Santa Barbara, with the subject as &quot;Madonna: Feminist Icon or Material Girl?&quot;. The conference pondered on the duality of Madonna as both of them and deduced that the question of Madonna&#x27;s feminism is not easy to decide. Some of the feminists left the conference, citing that they had not been able to make up their minds. As New Age spirituality became popular in the U.S. in the late 1990s, Madonna embarked on a spiritual quest of her own, and journals like &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Advocate&quot; described her as &quot;the Ethereal Girl&quot; and &quot;Spiritual Girl&quot; respectively.

<text>Götavirke (&quot;Geatish Dyke&quot;) are the remains of two parallel defensive walls going from north to south between the villages of Västra Husby () and Hylinge () in Söderköping Municipality, Östergötland, Sweden. The walls cover the distance between the lakes Asplången () and Lillsjön (). North of Asplången there are remains of several ancient hill forts that may have been part of the defensive line. South of Lake Lillsjön, the terrain is so hard to pass that it hardly needed any defences.

The walls seem to be constructed to protect the Geatish heartland around today&#x27;s Linköping from attacks from the Baltic Sea. Archaeological excavations have shown that the walls were constructed ca. 800. Defence constructions were also built along the 20-kilometre narrow inlet Slätbaken that stretches from the Baltic Sea to Götavirke, and even pass it during the Viking Age when the water level was 1.5 metres higher. The measures that Geats had taken to protect the route have no match in Viking Age Sweden.

The wall supported a wooden pale, and behind it are traces of a military road, which makes it similar to the Danevirke protecting the contemporary town of Hedeby. No Viking Age towns are however known in the vicinity of Götavirke.

<doc id="1020080" wikidata="Q4015014" url="?curid=1020080" title="Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets">
<text>Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets (1779–81), alternatively known by the shorter title Lives of the Poets, is a work by Samuel Johnson comprising short biographies and critical appraisals of 52 poets, most of whom lived during the eighteenth century. These were arranged, approximately, by date of death.

From the close of the 18th century, expanded editions and updates of Johnson&#x27;s work began to appear.

==Background==
Johnson began writing individual biographical pieces in 1740, the first being devoted to Jean-Philippe Baratier, Robert Blake, and Francis Drake. In 1744 he wrote his first extended literary biography, the &quot;Life of Mr Richard Savage&quot;, in honour of a friend who had died the year before.

Various accounts are given of how Johnson came to write his &quot;Lives of the Poets&quot; during an episode of anti-Scottish sentiment in England. As related in the preface to the 1891 edition of the Lives, Scottish publishers had started to produce editions of the collected works of various English poets and sell them in London, which was considered an invasion of copyright precedent. Then in 1777 the publisher John Bell proposed to bring out a 109-volume set of &quot;The Poets of Great Britain complete from Chaucer to Churchill&quot;, printed in Edinburgh at the rate of a volume a week. In order to compete with this project, Johnson was asked by a deputation of London publishers and booksellers, led by Thomas Davies, William Strahan and Thomas Cadell, to provide short biographies for a standard edition of poets in whom they had an interest. Johnson named a price of 200 guineas, an amount significantly lower than what he could have demanded. Soon afterwards, advertisements began to appear announcing “The English Poets, with a preface biographical and critical, to each author…elegantly printed in small pocket volumes, on a fine writing paper, ornamented with the heads of the respective authors, engraved by the most eminent artists”.

Johnson was slow to put pen to paper, although on 3 May 1777 he wrote to Boswell that he was busy preparing &quot;little Lives and little Prefaces, to a little edition of the English Poets&quot;. When asked later by Boswell whether he would do this for &quot;any dunce’s works, if they should ask him,&quot; Johnson replied, &quot;Yes, sir; and &quot;say&quot; he was a dunce.&quot; However, while so engaged, he made a few suggestions of his own for inclusion, including the poems of John Pomfret, Thomas Yalden, Isaac Watts, Richard Blackmore’s &quot;The Creation&quot; and James Thomson’s &quot;The Seasons&quot;. But as the work progressed, many of the prefaces grew in length, further holding up progress. The format of these now included a narrative of the poet’s life, a summary of his character and a critical assessment of his main poems. Eventually the decision was taken in 1779 to issue 56 volumes of poets alone, for which the sheets were already printed, together with separate volumes of prefaces as and when Johnson completed them. At first the prefaces were only made available to subscribers to the full set of poets, but in March 1781 the collected prefaces were offered separately as a six-volume work under the present title.

==The Lives and their shortcomings==

With some rare exceptions, almost all the prefaces were specially written for the series. The extended Life of Richard Savage of 1744 was incorporated with very few changes; an article on the Earl of Roscommon, previously published in &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; for May 1748, was worked over to conform to Johnson’s overall plan. An earlier “Dissertation on Pope’s Epitaphs” from 1756 was added to the end of the life of Alexander Pope and the character of William Collins had already appeared in &quot;The Poetical Calendar&quot; (1763). The life of Edward Young was written by Sir Herbert Croft at Johnson&#x27;s request, since that baronet had known him well. There are also lengthy quotations from other authors, as for example the “Prefatory Discourse” to the work of John Philips written by his friend Edmund Smith.

Even though the choice of authors was limited to those who were dead, some among the most recently deceased were not included, notably Charles Churchill (of whom Johnson disapproved) and Oliver Goldsmith, but this may have been due to copyright issues in both cases. Women poets were comprehensively omitted and that fact too was to draw criticism. Indeed, it has been conjectured that the 1785 new edition of George Colman and Bonnell Thornton’s 2-volume &quot;Poems by Eminent Ladies&quot; (originally published in 1755) may have been meant as a conscious supplement to the all-male series.

Not all the details in the book have proved trustworthy, and many critical judgements were considered prejudiced and unequal, even at the time of publication. The &quot;Concise Oxford Companion to English Literature&quot; instances as examples &quot;its strictures on Milton&#x27;s Lycidas, Gray&#x27;s Odes, and its evident prejudice against Swift&quot;, as well as the hostile characterisation of the Metaphysical style in the life of Abraham Cowley. Nor can Johnson&#x27;s prejudices be palliated by the observation in &quot;The Cambridge History of English and American Literature&quot; that &quot;he was much more interested in the man than in that part of him which is the author ...He claimed for it no exclusive privileges, nor held that the poet was a man apart to be measured by standards inapplicable to other men.&quot;

==Editorial responses==
Although the quality of Johnson&#x27;s writing has guaranteed the survival of his last considerable undertaking, its critical limitations generated published responses almost immediately. One of Johnson&#x27;s own friends, John Scott, so differed in opinion with some of his judgments that he wrote essays of his own on individual works by John Denham, John Dyer, Milton, Pope, Collins, Goldsmith and Thomson which were published in 1785 under the title &quot;Critical Essays on Some of the Poems of Several English Poets&quot;. When dealing with Goldsmith&#x27;s &quot;The Deserted Village&quot; he takes particular issue with the principles of inclusion in the collection of poets with which Johnson was associated: &quot;The Temple of Fame, lately erected under the title of &quot;The Works of the English Poets&quot;, affords a striking instance of caprice in the matter of admission to literary honours&quot;, he charged. To Scott the choice of poets seemed lacking in either method or &quot;rational impartial criticism&quot; (p. 247).

In the same year appeared the new edition of &quot;Poems by the Most Eminent Ladies of Great Britain and Ireland…with considerable alterations, additions and improvements&quot;. It has been conjectured, as mentioned above, that a reissue of the work thirty years after its first publication was a response to the omission of any female poets from the recent collection. The 1785 editor does not say as much in the &quot;Advertisement&quot; and it is only by a comparison of the contents lists of the two that it becomes apparent that the new edition gives a less comprehensive choice of works in order to include more authors. Breadth of coverage in the 1785 edition demonstrates the variety of women poets rather than, as in the 1755 edition, the variety of writing by individual authors.

Between 1821 and 1824 Henry Francis Cary published several essays in &quot;The London Magazine&quot;, collected and posthumously published in 1846 under the title &quot;Lives of English poets, from Johnson to Kirke White, designed as a continuation of Johnson&#x27;s Lives&quot;. These were unaccompanied by the works of the seventeen poets covered, apart from excerpts quoted in discussing their writing. The essays follow Johnson&#x27;s tripartite exposition of biographical detail, character study and descriptive survey of the poetry, and begin with Johnson himself, at ninety pages in length by far the longest essay in the book. There his prose works as well as his poetry are discussed; in fact more pages are devoted to the &quot;Lives of the Poets&quot; than to Johnson&#x27;s own performance as a poet. Oliver Goldsmith appears midway through the book and is given only twenty-four pages, less than those awarded William Mason and Erasmus Darwin, who precede and follow him. Where it is pertinent, Johnson&#x27;s critical opinions are quoted (although not always approved), and in Goldsmith&#x27;s case Johnsonian anecdotes are introduced.

==A body of the standard English poets==
Robert Anderson prefaced his &quot;A complete edition of the poets of Great Britain&quot; (1795) with the statement that &quot;When a new collection of English poetry is offered to the public, it will doubtless be inquired what are the deficiencies of preceding collections.&quot; To answer the question he went on to survey such anthologies over two centuries, noting in what ways they fell short of the completeness that he proposed. The ‘Johnson edition’ had failed in extensiveness by starting the English canon only in the second half of the 17th century. When it was augmented with the work of fourteen more poets in 1790, it still failed in inclusiveness, even over its allotted time-span; in addition, the biographical details of the added poets were skimped. What Anderson now proposed was a more ambitious set of poets, extending from Chaucer and covering the Tudor and early Stuart poets previously omitted, although in the event he was unable to include all that he wished. The selection also included more Scottish poets (though excluding dialect poetry) and two volumes of translations from the Classical writers. The accompanying biographies of the poets were written by Anderson himself.

From the point of view of comprehensive coverage, Alexander Chalmers advanced little beyond his predecessor in his &quot;The Works of the English Poets, from Chaucer to Cowper&quot; (1810). The main difference is that for those poets who appeared in the &#x27;Johnson edition&#x27;, Johnson&#x27;s lives are retained. At this date it is conceded in the preface that, &quot;after all the objections that have been offered, [they] must ever be the foundation of English poetical biography.&quot; By including them also there is an implied continuity between the volumes to which Johnson contributed and Chalmers&#x27; &quot;work professing to be a Body of the Standard English Poets&quot;.

==Later critical interpretations==
Matthew Arnold, in his &quot;Six Chief Lives from Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Poets&quot;&quot; (1878), considered the Lives of Milton, Dryden, Pope, Addison, Swift, and Gray as &quot;points which stand as so many natural centres, and by returning to which we can always find our way again&quot; and also as a model for Arnold&#x27;s &quot;ideal of liberal education&quot;, representing &quot;a crucial century and a half in English literature&quot;. For Arnold the whole work, focusing on these six, formed a &quot;compendious story of a whole important age in English literature, told by a great man, and in a performance which is itself a piece of English literature of the first class&quot;.

In mentioning this reading of Johnson&#x27;s Lives at the start of his own article in &quot;The Cambridge Companion to Samuel Johnson&quot;, Greg Clingham describes the topics covered there as &quot;like a list of most of the important issues in literary history during the years 1600–1781&quot; as well as something like a social, philosophical and political history of that era. But Philip Smallwood, commenting on the Lives in &quot;The Oxford Handbook of British Poetry, 1660-1800&quot;, nuances this by pointing out that Johnson did not set out to produce a literary history. His main preoccupation is with how literary work is in a state of flux and advanced by individuals writing within a historical context. Consideration of their lives is therefore justified as it helps the reader in a different time to appreciate the significance of the works described.

<text>The year 1965 saw a number of significant events in radio broadcasting.

==Events==
*19 April: WINS (AM) in New York switches from Top 40 to all-news, with the slogan &quot;You give us 22 minutes, we&#x27;ll give you the world.&quot;
*19 June: After a multi-year courtroom battle which involved accusations of extortion, the FCC reversed a 1956 station ownership trade between Westinghouse Broadcasting and NBC. Westinghouse reclaimed their original Philadelphia stations, while NBC was ordered to take over their former owned-and-operated stations in Cleveland. The KYW call letters originally went from Philadelphia to Cleveland in 1956, and back to Philadelphia with the reversal, with NBC renaming the Cleveland stations WKYC AM/FM/TV.
*18 August: Marlene Dietrich appears in &quot;The Child&quot; for BBC radio.
*21 September: KYW (AM), shortly after relocating back to Philadelphia, institutes an all-news format patterned after WINS (AM).
*11 October: The Dutch popular-music channel Hilversum 3 (now 3FM) begins broadcasting.
*12 December: New owner Westchester Broadcasting changes the call letters of WDOK (AM) in Cleveland to WIXY, installing a Top 40 format (today known as WCCR). Their FM sister station retains the WDOK calls and beautiful music format.

===Unknown Dates===
*KOFM signed on air in Oklahoma City with a Beautiful Music format.

==Debuts==
*16 May: Cross Country Checkup debuts on CBC Radio
*4 October: Long-running lunchtime news and current affairs programme &quot;The World at One&quot; begins on the BBC Home Service (now BBC Radio 4).

==Deaths==
*20 January: Alan Freed, 47, American disc jockey.
*27 April: Edward R. Murrow, 57, American news broadcaster.
*22 May: Christopher Stone, 82, pioneering English disc jockey.

<text>Vingåker () is a locality and the seat of Vingåker Municipality, Södermanland County, Sweden with 4,282 inhabitants in 2010. It is located by road from the nearest larger city Örebro and north-west of county seat Nyköping.

It was partly built in the English garden of Säfstaholm, a large estate which until 1855 was home to philanthropist and art collector Gustaf Trolle-Bonde. The estate is nowadays owned by the municipality and contains an art museum with yearly exhibitions during the summer.

The town&#x27;s expansion began in 1862 when a railway station was opened along the western main line (&quot;Västra Stambanan&quot;, which runs from Stockholm to Gothenburg). The station remained in operation until 1971, but reopened in 2003.

The town is the birthplace of Gunnar Helén, former chairman of the Liberal Party, and former Swedish Prime Minister Göran Persson.

A transit center for refugees from Norway during World War II was located in the manor of Kjesäter, now a public high school.

<doc id="1020099" wikidata="Q106909" url="?curid=1020099" title="Strängnäs">
<text>Strängnäs is a locality and the seat of Strängnäs Municipality, Södermanland County, Sweden with 15,363 inhabitants in 2020. It is located by Lake Mälaren and is the episcopal see of the Diocese of Strängnäs, one of the thirteen dioceses of the Church of Sweden. Prominently located on a hilltop, Strängnäs Cathedral, built between 1291 and 1340, is an important landmark.

== Etymology ==
The city&#x27;s name is first encountered in 1120, in reference to the Diocese. The name Strängnäs is derived from the fact that the city is located near a strait and on several hills, especially on two major ones, the &quot;Mill Hill&quot; and the &quot;Cathedral Hill&quot;. In Old Norse &quot;strengr&quot; indicates a &quot;narrow channel of water&quot; and &quot;nes&quot; refers to an &quot;isthmus&quot;, &quot;narrow peninsula&quot;, or &quot; headland&quot;, a very common toponymic in Scandinavia.

== History ==
A monastery was established around 1250, and the cathedral inaugurated in 1291, with the town subsequently evolving around these two institutions.

The oldest known city charter was granted in 1336 by King Magnus Eriksson. Strängnäs became a city of importance in the Södermanland province, as the location of the governing thing and also of an annual market. King Gustav Vasa was elected king in Strängnäs in 1523, and delivered his first speech from a position adjacent to the cathedral.

In the 15th and 16th centuries Strängnäs had an important place in the history of Sweden, particularly through the Reformation era. Strängnäs was the native city of prominent reformer Laurentius Andreae and the home city of both Andreae and Olaus Petri.

It became a regional centre of education and scholarship, and in 1626 the Thomas Gymnasium was established by King Gustavus Adolphus, and is today Sweden&#x27;s second oldest operating gymnasium.

The urban and economic development of Strängnäs seems to have slowed after the Reformation, only flourishing temporarily with the arrival of energetic bishops. The city was slow to engage with the 19th century industrial development and investment found in other areas. A significant fire in 1871 led to large-scale reconstruction of the city, from which time its current appearance stems.

The city was accidentally bombed by the Soviet Union during World War II, causing minor damage.

In 1962 a runestone known as Strängnäs stone was discovered during the demolition of an old stove in a house at Klostergatan 4. The stone is a piece of jotnian sandstone inscribed with runes written in Proto-Norse, in Elder Futhark alphabet.

== Contemporary life ==
Many of the inhabitants of Strängnäs commute to Stockholm, Södertälje and Eskilstuna. European route E20 passes the city, and there is a mainline railway station operated by the Swedish national railway company, with direct services to and from the capital Stockholm.

Tourism is a significant element of the city&#x27;s economy, with the brick gothic cathedral (with celebrated statues, artworks, and historical archives) attracting many visitors, as well as the attraction of natural features, particularly the lake.

The extreme metal band Merciless was formed in Strängnäs.

<text>Oxelösund is a locality and the seat of Oxelösund Municipality in Södermanland County, Sweden with 11,488 inhabitants in 2018. It is located less than south from the city centre of its larger neighbour, Nyköping, with the two urban areas forming a wider agglomeration of nearly 50,000 people.

== History ==

The harbour at Oxelösund has been used for at least 500 years. In the 19th century, an increased extraction from the mining district of Central Sweden (e.g. &quot;Bergslagen&quot;), made Oxelösund a harbour of transport. A local railroad company was established in 1873 and bought virtually the entire peninsula, which then belonged to the estates of the Stjärnholm Castle.

An iron works was constructed in 1913, and the community Oxelösund expanded, with the harbour, railway and iron works being its cornerstones.

In 1950, the city was sufficiently developed to get the title of a city and was one of the last towns to receive city status in Sweden. Since 1971, the status is obsolete, but Oxelösund is the seat of a municipality with the same territory that is one of the smallest in the country.

In November 2011, Oxelösund hosted the Nordic Under-21 Championships in underwater rugby.

Femöre battery is located near the area.

== Companies ==
*SSAB, Swedish steel.

== Climate ==
Oxelösund has a hybrid between a maritime and humid continental climate, with moderated patterns which stem from its position at the head of a peninsula, with the weather station facing the open sea. In much of the urban area and up the peninsula the climate is somewhat more prone to swings, something intensifying farther north as in Nyköping.

<text>Nyköping () is a locality and the seat of Nyköping Municipality, Södermanland County, Sweden, with 32,759 inhabitants as of 2017. The city is also the capital of Södermanland County.

Including Arnö, the locality on the southern shore of the bay just a couple of kilometres from the city centre, Nyköping would have above 36,000 inhabitants. Commonly, Arnö is referred to as a part of the city proper. It forms a wider conurbation with the neighbouring minor municipality and town of Oxelösund south of its outskirts. The municipality is much larger, although sparsely populated outside of the urban area.

Nyköping directly translates to &quot;Newmarket&quot; in English. The prefix is translated as &quot;new&quot; and is an old Swedish word for a market place, commonly used as a suffix for cities in the south central region of the country (see Köping). is the name that appears on coins in 1230 and in historical records from the 13th century. &quot;Aros&quot; is the name of the town found in the archaeological records from before 1230, indicating a new era and a new name sometime around 1230. The city is located near the open Baltic Sea on the Stadsfjärden inlet, and is regarded as a coastal location. Rivers Nyköpingsån and Kilaån reach the Baltic Sea through the southern end of downtown. The former river splits the town down the middle into an eastern and western part. The river Svärtaån empties into the sea by the locality Sjösa, east of the town. There are multiple other inlets in the municipality, which has an extensive shoreline.

Typical of the region, the landscape is influenced by post-glacial rebound after the latest ice age. For thousands of years, the land of downtown Nyköping was an archipelago where the hills in town today formed many islands, while the flatter parts of the town were the seafloor. With four peaks above , the highest point within town limits is at Ekensberg in the northeastern fringes.

Nyköping is also the home of Stockholm Skavsta Airport, which is located less than from the city centre. Nyköping is part of the wider area of the Mälaren Valley, located around south of inner Stockholm and east of Norrköping, the nearest larger city. The municipal border between Nyköping and Norrköping marks the point where the historical lands Götaland and Svealand converge on the east coast.

It retains an oceanic/continental climate hybrid, causing warm summers and winters around the freezing point with variable snow cover.

== History ==
The area bears traces of settlers since around 2000 BC. In the early medieval age, around 1000 AD, Nyköping was a capital of one of the many Swedish petty kingdoms. In the 13th century, construction on the Nyköping Fortress begun; the following century it became the strongest fortress in the country. The coat of arms probably depicts the fortress, or one of its towers.

In 1317, the Nyköping Banquet took place, a renowned episode in Sweden&#x27;s history, when King Birger of Sweden captured his two brothers as revenge for earlier sufferings and had them imprisoned without food until they starved to death (See &quot;Nyköpings gästabud&quot;).

The earliest known charter dates from 1444, making it one of the now defunct Cities in Sweden. In the 16th century, Nyköping became the seat of Duke Charles, who later became Charles IX of Sweden. With the status of a Royal residential seat, Nyköping was at its peak of development.

In 1665 large parts of the city including the fortress were damaged in a fire. The same thing happened again in 1719 when Russian troops invaded the city. It was then rebuilt with its current street plan.

Nyköping was industrialized relatively early compared to the rest of Sweden. In the early 19th century, textile industry was established, and the population soon rose as Nyköping&#x27;s industry grew. In 1879, C.A. Wedholms mejerikärlsfabrik was founded, starting to produce milk churns. Wedholms still has activity in Nyköping and is a milk cooling tank manufacturer.
=== 20th century ===

Nyköping was the town where Nordiska Kompaniet had its furniture factory. The business created a spin-off named ANA, which licence-built American and English cars, as Plymouth, De Soto, Hillman and Sunbeam. The company was later purchased by Saab Automobile and led to SAAB becoming the largest employer in the town during the 1980s, as well as the relocation of the headquarters to Spelhagen. But when GM bought SAAB from Investor AB, the headquarters was moved back to Trollhättan and about two thousand lost their jobs.

=== Military history ===
Nyköping has been a stronghold for the reconnaissance squadrons of the Swedish Air Force. Between 1941 and 1980, the nearby Stockholm Skavsta Airport hosted the Södermanland Wing (F 11), which had three squadrons with reconnaissance aircraft. It was the only dedicated reconnaissance wing in the Swedish Air Force. The city has also hosted the flying school of the Swedish Army which was located at Brandholmen between 1963 and 1985.

== Geography ==

=== Position ===
Nyköping lies about south-west of the capital Stockholm along the Baltic Sea. It is roughly north-east of Norrköping, both cities being accessible by highway-divided motorway. It is also about south of Eskilstuna; the largest settlement of the county. The northern areas of the city is on exactly the same parallel of 58° 46&#x27; N as Canadian &quot;polar bear capital of the world&quot; Churchill, demonstrating how warm the climate is in comparison in spite of its northerly latitude. The southern edge of the municipality also straddles the same parallel as the northernmost point of mainland Scotland at Thurso – that has a much more narrower range of temperature. The southern edge of the municipality is the southernmost point of Svealand, the middle of Sweden&#x27;s traditional three crown lands that once formed the country. The city is located at a few miles more southerly latitude than the country&#x27;s northernmost west coast town of Strömstad. The line of 17°E goes through Nyköping, thus the city is eight minutes ahead in solar time of the GMT +1 line that Sweden follows for its time zone.

=== Living environment ===
Nyköping is the exodus of a small river named Nyköpingsån (Nyköping River), which runs through the city centre, dividing the city into a natural eastern and western part. Due to the narrowness of the river, there are a full seven crossings available for automobile traffic, one of them being for the E4. For pedestrians and bikers, an additional seven bridges are available, and in addition to that there is also one bridge for train traffic. All automobile bridges except E4 also carry pedestrian sidewalks, which means transport is seldom made longer than the actual distance. There is also a small pedestrian bridge in an unpopulated nature reserve called &quot;Hållet&quot; that is very close to the E4 route.

The small river Kilaån separates Nyköping and Arnö, with that river being even narrower. Also separating Nyköping and Arnö is the so-called &quot;Stadsfjärden&quot; (the City bay), which is a bay stretching around the Arnö peninsula down to the neighboring municipality of Oxelösund. Stadsfjärden is primarily used for tourist shipping and canoeing, with an internationally renowned canoeing stadium being situated along the northern shore. The port is much smaller than Oxelösund&#x27;s and is primarily used for civil traffic, as opposed to cargo shipments and ferry traffic which is dominated by nearby ports of Oxelösund and Nynäshamn. This is due to the port being some 15 kilometres from open sea as opposed to Oxelösund&#x27;s position on the edge of the peninsula. Even though Nyköping is a relatively flat city there are some hills in the northern parts of the town, barely reaching 50 metres altitude. The city centre is essentially just above sea level and does not rise above 20 metres altitude, although it contains hills surrounding it.

=== Populated areas of Nyköping ===
* &quot;Brandholmen&quot;
* &quot;Brandkärr&quot;
* &quot;Bryngelstorp&quot;
* &quot;Ekensberg&quot;
* &quot;Fågelbo&quot;

* &quot;Öster&quot; (the East)
* &quot;Östra bergen&quot; (the Eastern Mountains)

The area of &quot;Gumsbacken&quot; only carries a large shopping mall centre but is part of the city proper.

=== Connected areas ===

The rural localities of Sjösa, Bergshammar, Svalsta and Enstaberga located within are connected to the city centre by cycle tracks with permanent lighting. In addition there is a nature and coastal area called &quot;Tjuvholmen&quot; east of the city centre that is part of the locality with many holiday homes. Tjuvholmen lacks an asphalted access road and is in general seen as a rural area in spite of its proximity to the city centre. East of Arnö on the southern shore there are similar areas such as &quot;Örstig&quot;, which is connected by asphalt road and cycle tracks to Arnö and Nyköping. Other nearby rural areas on the southern shore include holiday home areas such as &quot;Linudden&quot; and &quot;Örstigsnäs&quot;, as well as the coastal camping place of &quot;Strandstugeviken&quot;. There is also lighted cycling tracks all the way south roughly to the neighbouring city Oxelösund, making pedestrian and biking transport to nearby areas effective and avoids potentially dangerous contacts with motor vehicles.

== Elections ==

Nyköping is the seat of Nyköping Municipality and this table just records how the urban area (including Arnö) has voted, contrasting with the rural electoral wards.

=== Riksdag ===
== Transportation ==
=== Buses ===
Nyköping&#x27;s intercity and city bus-links are operated by Nobina Sverige. The city bus network consists of seven lines:
Map of city bus lines

Coaches to Stockholm and Gothenburg are operated by Flixbus.

=== Rail ===

The city is located on a branch line to the Södra stambanan. Scheduled railway connections on the line is provided by SJ AB. These are mostly operated by Rc-hauled trainsets. SJ does currently not operate any X 2000 services to Nyköping.

The planned new high-speed rail Ostlänken going from Stockholm to Linköping will have two stops in the city, one at the new planned train station and one at Skavsta Airport. The railway will later be connected with the planned high-speed rail Götalandsbanan going from Linköping to Gothenburg, which will make it possible to go from Stockholm to Gothenburg in two hours. It is planned to be finished between 2033 and 2035.

=== Air ===
Stockholm-Skavsta Airport offers intra-European routes on Ryanair and Wizz Air. The airport is located about 10 kilometers outside of the city and is connected with bus from the city center.

== Climate ==
Nyköping has, along with the rest of Mälardalen, a relatively mild humid continental climate (Dfb). In recent decades, the climate has more resembled a four-season oceanic climate. Winter averages around the freezing point during daytime with only the cold nights causing winter conditions in many winters. Summer average highs are between and depending on month and weather patterns. However, both summers and winters have been significantly warmer and colder, respectively, than the averages. Temperatures over are occasional but not overly common, with temperatures above unknown in recent decades. Winters are normally tempered by the Gulf Stream influence from the west and the Baltic Sea to the east, but when cold air breaks through cold temperatures can occur, sometimes for a prolonged time. As typical of southern Sweden there is a slight seasonal lag, meaning that the warmest period is often occurring during the second half of summer.

The seaside effect due to southerlies frequently travelling over water often prevents heat waves from impacting Nyköping, resulting in lower diurnals with very mild nights, while Norrköping to its west often is hot during the day and cools down at night.

The inland areas of the municipality are very much similar to the coastal areas, but the weather station at Skavsta shows lower summer mean temperatures than Oxelösund, indicating that the inner city wider urban area nearer the water has milder nights year round. Both stations are within a meteorological relevant range from the city centre.

After many years without any weather station, the SMHI set up a precipitation reader in Nyköping in 2020. The nearest temperature station is seaside at Femöre in Oxelösund, about south by air. Nyköping is slightly warmer during the day than Oxelösund during summer and shoulder seasons, while being somewhat colder during winter days and nights year round. 

== Sports ==
Nyköping has two major sport clubs:

* Nyköpings Boll- och Idrottsällskap is the local Division 2 football club; they play their home matches at the Rosvalla Nyköping Eventcenter.
* Nyköpings Hockey is the local ice hockey club; its home rink is PEAB Arena.

Other clubs are football club Harg, the football and handball teams of IFK Nyköping and also includes Onyx in floorball.

The city is yet to have a team in the major football or hockey leagues of Sweden, with stints in the second tiers being the greatest achievements for both main sides.

== Sights ==
Nyköping includes the cinema Biostaden which houses Sweden&#x27;s largest cinema screen. The cinema was newly built from the ground in 2012. It is located in Högbrunn.

Nyköpings Stadsbibliotek (Nyköping City Library) is located in the city center, which offers various book clubs and activities for children. There is free Internet access and wifi for visitors. It has books of all genres, for all ages, and in many languages.

<text>Katrineholm ( ) is a locality and the seat of Katrineholm Municipality, Södermanland County, Sweden with 24,271 inhabitants in 2018. It is located in the inland of Södermanland and is the third largest urban area in the county after Eskilstuna and county seat Nyköping.

==History==

===Early history===
The name Katrineholm comes from a ducal residence with this name, after Catherina Gyllenhorn who lived there. The settlement started growing when it became a railway junction connecting the railways Stockholm - Gothenburg), and Stockholm - Malmö. In 1917 it had a population of 6,000 and in 1971 became the seat of Katrineholm Municipality.

===Today===
Katrineholm used to have a strong industrial sector, with several multinational corporations such as Ericsson and Scania contributing to its economy, but in the 1990s some of these companies reduced their workforce in Katrineholm. Today, many residents work elsewhere, particularly in Stockholm, as the train connection between Katrineholm and other major cities is fast and comfortable.

During the 1970s and 1980s the town bandy team was one of the best in the Swedish national league, winning the league 1969, 1970 and 1972. The Federation of International Bandy has an office in Katrineholm.

The 1985 movie &quot;On the loose&quot;, featuring the Hard Rock band Europe has its history set in Katrineholm.

<text>Trosa is a locality and the seat of Trosa Municipality, Södermanland County, Sweden with 5,027 inhabitants in 2010 (town) and 11,417 in 2010 (municipality). The town is colloquially nicknamed &quot;Världens ände&quot; (&quot;The world&#x27;s end&quot;, specifically the rear end, as &quot;Trosa&quot; is coincidentally also Swedish for &quot;panty&quot;).

The municipality of Trosa consists of the three towns Trosa, Västerljung and Vagnhärad. Despite its small size, Trosa states its place in Sweden. It is the second fastest growing town in Sweden (2,9%/year 2008) and is ranked as having the 3rd best business climate in Sweden (2011).

== History ==

Trosa was known as a town in the 14th century. In the 15th century it was an important site for trade, and received its city privileges in 1454 by King Charles VIII of Sweden (a.k.a. &quot;Karl Knutsson Bonde&quot;). Due to post-glacial rebound, the city center was moved in the early 17th century, to its present location by the estuary of the Trosa River. The city gained its valour at the new location from King Karl IX, 19 April 1610.

The city was burnt down and plundered by Russians in 1719 during the Russian Pillage of 1719-1721 and was repeatedly attacked during the Great Northern War, but the local church and poor-house was spared at every occasion. Both these buildings are now on display in the center of Trosa and serves as a memory from those hard times.

The economic base of the city was as earlier merchantmen and fishery. When the baltic fishery during the 1870s diminished in economic terms, the city opted for tourism as a business for the small coastal city.

== Present ==

Today Trosa is one of the top four wealthiest communities in Sweden (32% of the population earns more than 1,5 million SEK a year). Many famous people have summerhouses in or close to Trosa, for example the well-known chef, hunter and actor Per Morberg as well as Tommy Körberg, the Swedish royal family, Mikael Persbrandt, ABBAs Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus. The founder of Camfil Farr, Gösta Larsson, lived in Trosa all of his life and at the moment the Larsson-Markman family runs the company.

The general number of people living in Trosa goes up by 131% during the summer months of June–August because of the high ratio of summer residences. Trosa brings in a large number of tourists each year and the Board of Tourism in Södermanland estimates that a little less than 250,000 people from all over the world pass through the town each year.
About 733,650 days AD, Trosa celebrated 146,000 days as a town at its present location under the motto &quot;Future since 1610&quot;.

The metalcore band Adept (band) is from the town.

== Education ==
Within Trosa locality there are four elementary schools (grades 1–6), two junior high schools (grades 7–9). Right now there are no plans to build or house a high school or university/college within the municipality.

<text>Eskilstuna () is a city and the seat of Eskilstuna Municipality, Södermanland County, Sweden. The city of Eskilstuna had 69,948 inhabitants in 2020, with a total population of 107,806 inhabitants in Eskilstuna municipality 2023. Eskilstuna has a large Sweden Finn population. The town is located on the River Eskilstunaån, which connects Lake Hjälmaren and Lake Mälaren.

== History ==

Eskilstuna&#x27;s history dates back to medieval times when English monk Saint Eskil made &quot;Tuna&quot; his base and diocese of the South coast of Lake Mälaren. Saint Eskil was stoned to death by the pagan vikings of neighbouring town Strängnäs, east of Eskilstuna, when he tried to convert them to Christianity. Saint Eskil was buried in his monastery church in Tuna. 

The monastery of Saint Eskil was completely destroyed by Swedish king Gustav Vasa during the Protestant Reformation and was replaced with the royal castle of Eskilstuna House.

Later the pagan city of Strängnäs was Christianised and was given the privilege of becoming diocese of South Lake Mälaren, and &quot;Eskil&quot; was combined with &quot;Tuna&quot;, although the town of Eskilstuna did not receive municipal privileges due to its proximity to the medieval city of Torshälla. The city&#x27;s first city privileges were granted in 1659, and its boundaries included Tunafors and the newly founded town of &quot;Karl Gustavs Stad&quot; (&quot;City of Karl Gustav&quot;), located on the west side of the river.

Karl Gustavs Stad was built around the iron forges of master smith Reinhold Rademacher, encouraged by King Karl X Gustav. The first products of the forges were small arms and artillery. It was a free town from 1771, where manufacturers and craftsmen were allowed to establish tax-free workshops and factories. The town was merged with the rest of Eskilstuna in 1879.

The city grew enormously during the Industrial Revolution and became one of the most important industrial cities of Sweden, earning the nickname &quot;Stålstaden&quot; (&quot;The City of Steel&quot;). Aside from firearms, the city also produced superior carpentry and wood carving chisels, cutlery, scissors, keys, machine tools and precision instruments. As a tribute to the steel industry, the figure of a steel worker is included in the city&#x27;s coat of arms. Eskilstuna is sometimes called &quot;The Sheffield of Sweden&quot;. Both cities at their peak were home to numerous steel production companies.

== Economy ==
Eskilstuna remains an important industrial city with internationally known companies such as Volvo Wheel loaders, main site for the heavy construction equipment division of Volvo, Assa (locks, keys), and Stainless steel manufacturer Outokumpu, Thin Strip Nyby in Torshälla.

Mälardalen University (&quot;Mälardalens högskola&quot;), founded in cooperation with the neighboring city of Västerås, has a campus in the city. The city also has a combined zoo and amusement park - Parken Zoo.

The hospital, Mälarsjukhuset is one of the largest in the region, employing around 3000 people.

Starting in 2012 the town has been pivoting towards a green economy, including biogas-powered public transit and cogeneration plants, seven-colored recycling bins (compared to the standard Swedish five), and a recycling center with an attached second-hand mall.

==Climate==

Eskilstuna has a climate transitioning between continental and maritime with vast seasonal differences for a Southern Swedish climate. Unlike the coastal part of the Sörmlandic region, Eskilstuna has higher diurnal temperature variation and stronger waves of either heat or cold. With regards to daytime maximum and minimum temperatures, the weather station has been operated since 1961 with a total of three breaks of 2-3 years apiece in between 1984 and 2008.

== Demography ==

As of December 31, 2019, Eskilstuna Municipality has a population of 106,859 people, making it the 15th largest municipality in Sweden.

<text>Flen () is a locality and the seat of Flen Municipality, Södermanland County, Sweden with 6,229 inhabitants in 2010.

Flen evolved as a railway junction and got the title of a city in 1949. Since 1971 it is the seat of the much larger Flen Municipality.

Other things which made Flen famous is &quot;Violen från Flen&quot;, a song written by Ulf Peder Olrog in the 1940s. The town also plays an important role in &quot;Du ringde från Flen&quot;, a 1992 dansband song by Grönwalls. The town is also mentioned in the Kent song &quot;Flen/Paris&quot; on the 2005 EP &quot;The hjärta &amp; smärta EP&quot; and &quot;Ensam lång väg hem&quot; on the 2010 album &quot;En plats i solen&quot;. The famous Equestrians Carl Green and Sigurd Svensson was born here.

Flen is known as the &#x27;city of ice cream&#x27; because it is the location of GB Glace, the biggest ice cream company in Sweden.

Flen is also famous for having the world&#x27;s northernmost vineyard, in Blacksta.

<doc id="1020107" wikidata="Q7897290" url="?curid=1020107" title="Unpledged elector">
<text>In United States presidential elections, an unpledged elector is a person nominated to stand as an elector but who has not pledged to support any particular presidential or vice presidential candidate, and is free to vote for any candidate when elected a member of the Electoral College. Presidential elections are indirect, with voters in each state choosing electors on Election Day in November, and these electors choosing the president and vice president of the United States in December. Electors in practice have since the 19th century almost always agreed in advance to vote for a particular candidate — that is, they are said to have been &quot;pledged&quot; to that candidate. In several elections in the 20th century, however, competitive campaigns were mounted by candidates who made no pledge to any presidential nominee before the election. These anomalies largely arose from fissures within the Democratic Party over the issues of civil rights and segregation. No serious general election campaign has been mounted to elect unpledged electors in any state since 1964.

An unpledged elector is distinct from a faithless elector who pledges their vote for a particular candidate before the election but ultimately votes for someone else or fails to vote at all.

==Constitutional background==
When the United States Constitution was written, the Founding Fathers intended the Electoral College to be a truly deliberative body whose members would choose a president (and vice president, after 1800) based on their own preferences. They also left the method for selecting the electors for each state to the discretion of that state&#x27;s legislature. Other than the implied expectation that the electors vote for candidates who are constitutionally qualified to serve as president and vice president, the Constitution otherwise places no restriction on the behavior of the electors, and assumes that each is an independent agent.

The system worked without much controversy for the first two presidential elections in which George Washington was the unanimous choice for president and electors&#x27; opinions diverged only on the choice for vice president, which was widely seen to be an unimportant post. Washington was not a member of any political party, and had hoped they would not form. Nevertheless, &quot;Federalist&quot; and &quot;Anti-Federalist&quot; factions quickly coalesced in the United States Congress.

Once Washington announced his intention to retire after his second presidential term, U.S. politics very quickly became dominated by strong political party organizations. Even without this particular development, the reality was that electors had only one constitutional duty – electing the president and vice president, while at the same time seeking no other federal office since federal officials are constitutionally barred from serving as electors. In several states, legislatures chose electors. Among the states that selected electors by popular vote, different electoral systems were in place. Some effectively held a statewide vote for all electors – essentially the system most similar to that used in 48 of 50 states today although at this time an electoral mechanism that could effectively compel voters to vote for any particular &quot;slate&quot; of presidential electors had not yet been contemplated. Some states elected two electors in a statewide vote and one in each congressional district (essentially, the system used today in Maine and Nebraska) and a few states experimented with selecting presidential electors in special districts distinct from its congressional districts. More broadly, the franchise (that is, the qualifications that determined who among the adult male population was allowed to vote for state and federal legislators and, where applicable, for presidential electors) varied widely from state to state. However, no matter who was allowed to vote for electors and no matter how they were selected, the only meaningful question any prospective elector had to answer was for whom they would vote for president (and, from 1804 onward, for vice president) and the only real issues of importance to those selecting electors, beyond deciding who they wanted to become president and vice president, was perhaps whether the person or people they selected to represent them in the Electoral College could be trusted to keep their word. Thus, it rapidly became increasingly unrealistic for anyone to be elected to the Electoral College without making a trustworthy &quot;pledge&quot; to vote for particular candidates on behalf of those electing them.

By the 1830s, most states chose their electors by popular vote. While voting for individual electors was still the norm at this point, by this time the electors who appeared on ballots were nominated by the state chapters of national parties with the understanding that they would cast their votes for their party&#x27;s candidate if elected. Also by this time, political parties had successfully lobbied most states to allow voters to cast one vote for every elector that state had apportioned to it. The main rationale of this system was to greatly simplify the distribution of presidential ballots. Prior to the introduction of the secret ballot, political parties were responsible for printing and distributing their own ballots, thus, allowing voters to cast as many votes as the state had electors meant a party could print a standardized ballot containing the same slate of the party&#x27;s presidential electors for each state. Also, whether an intended consequence or not, this system resulted in most states having a &quot;de facto&quot; (but not &quot;de jure&quot;) winner-take-all method of allocating presidential electors.

Eventually, this arrangement became such a given in presidential elections that when the time came for the states to take over the printing and distribution of ballots (a development necessitated by the introduction of the secret ballot in the 1880s) most states did not bother to list the names of the electors on ballots, instead listing the candidates to whom those electors were pledged. In doing so, they also ensured that the winner-take-all method of selecting presidential electors that had become so firmly entrenched in the U.S. presidential electoral system by that point would become established by law in most states. There were some exceptions, however, such as Alabama, described below.

==Unpledged electors in the 20th century==

=== Background ===
After the American Civil War and Reconstruction, the Democratic Party gained an almost unbreakable dominance in the Southern United States, and the Republicans, associated with Abraham Lincoln and the Union cause, were correspondingly unelectable there. The nationwide Democratic party became increasingly liberal in the early 20th century, a shift that accelerated with the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt. By contrast, the leaders of the Democratic Party in the South, although somewhat supportive of certain parts of the New Deal and other liberal Democratic economic policies, were in many other aspects conservative. In particular, they were vehemently protective of segregation and strongly opposed to civil rights for African Americans.

In several mid-20th-century elections, unpledged Democratic electors appeared on the ballots in several Southern states; in some cases they ran in opposition to electors pledged to the nationwide Democratic candidate, and in others they were the only Democratic electors that appeared on the ballot. The goal was to have electors who could act as kingmakers in a close election, extracting concessions that would favor conservative Southern Democrats in exchange for their votes.

The first modern slates of unpledged electors were fielded in the 1944 election as a protest against certain aspects of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal and support for desegregation.

In Texas, a splinter group of Democrats known as the Texas Regulars fielded a slate of electors not pledged to any candidate; similar slates were on the ballot in South Carolina and Mississippi. While they won or placed second in several counties, none of the groups met much success.

====1956====
In 1956, unpledged slates were on the ballot in Alabama (20,150 votes, 4.1% of the vote), Louisiana (44,520 votes, 7.2% of the vote and they won four parishes), Mississippi (42,266 votes, 17.3% of the vote and they won seven counties) and South Carolina (88,509 votes, 29.5% of the vote and 21 counties).

====1960====
The 1960 election was the only election that saw unpledged electors actually elected to the electoral college.

In that year, a slate of eight unpledged electors in Mississippi won a plurality of the vote there (116,248 votes, or 39% of the total).

Louisiana&#x27;s popular vote went to a slate of electors pledged to Kennedy and Johnson, but a slate of unpledged electors on the ballot there won 169,572 votes (21% of the vote).

In Georgia, the state legislature, although allowing for a separate group of unpledged electors according to state law, requested the people give a non-binding straw vote to determine whether Kennedy should have pledged electors on the ballot or whether his electors should be free to choose to act as unpledged electors. The voters overwhelmingly supported the &quot;Pledge Free&quot; Electors, but after it was clear they ultimately wouldn’t affect the Electoral College’s decision all Georgia electors voted for Kennedy, despite concerns they would abandon their pledges and become faithless electors.

In Alabama, the vote was not for the presidential candidates but for individual electors, with each of the 11 electors having their own separate elections. As a result of Alabama&#x27;s Democratic primaries, five of the eleven nominated Democratic electors were pledged to Democratic nominees John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson and six were unpledged. Although all eleven Democratic electors were elected, the unusual situation has led to ambiguity about the correct method to calculate popular votes for Kennedy and the unpledged electors. The common practice is to give Kennedy the votes for his most-voted pledged elector and to give unpledged electors their popular votes by subtracting the votes for the most-voted unpledged elector by the votes for the most-voted Kennedy-pledged elector; the unusual calculation for the unpledged electors is done so that the total votes align with the estimated total number of people who voted in Alabama&#x27;s presidential contest (although the exact number is uncertain because voters are allowed to abstain from voting for all 11 electors&#x27; elections). However, the electoral split between Kennedy and the Unpledged Electors has been used to argue for a lesser-used method of splitting the vote of the highest-voted Democratic elector proportionally between Kennedy and the Unpledged; some have used said vote split to argue that Kennedy had lost the popular vote to Nixon, both in the Alabama popular vote and resultantly the national popular vote. Even disregarding proportionally splitting the vote of the highest-voted Democratic elector, simply summing Kennedy and Nixon&#x27;s total votes from their multiple electors and evenly splitting them among the 11 electors&#x27; races would give Nixon a national popular vote victory of 34,108,157 to 34,076,629. Such calculation would temporarily be used in the &quot;Congressional Quarterly&quot; before the change to the current vote-counting method.

When the electoral college cast its vote, all fourteen unpledged electors cast their votes for conservative Democrat Harry F. Byrd for president and Strom Thurmond for vice president after trying to influence other Southern states into unpledging their electors to join them. They were joined by Henry D. Irwin from Oklahoma, a faithless Republican elector who objected to Republican nominee Richard M. Nixon. Irwin cast his vice presidential vote for Barry Goldwater. Irwin had attempted to broker a coalition between the unpledged electors and other Republican electors, but to no avail: Kennedy and Johnson won a clear majority of the electoral vote.

====1964====
The last slate of unpledged electors to date was filed in Alabama in the 1964 election. The slate was supported by Democratic Alabama Governor George C. Wallace while the national Democratic nominees, Lyndon B. Johnson and Hubert H. Humphrey, did not appear on Alabama ballots. The electors won 30.6 percent of the vote, but the state was ultimately won by Republican nominees Barry Goldwater and William E. Miller.

=== Aftermath ===
The Republican ticket&#x27;s victory in Alabama and four other Southern states (the only states Goldwater carried besides his home state of Arizona) heralded a trend that would put an end to the practice of nominating unpledged electors.

As a strategy, it had been largely ineffective, and southern conservatives, many of whom were still reluctant to vote Republican, began urging Governor Wallace to run for the White House in 1968 under the auspices of a traditional third-party presidential campaign. Once Wallace announced his intention to run for president, the rationale for running slates of formally unpledged electors disappeared. Nevertheless, Wallace sought commitments from his &quot;pledged&quot; electors in the states he was most likely to win that they would not necessarily vote for him but rather as he directed, thus allowing the Alabama Governor to act as a power broker in case of an election with no clear winner in the weeks between the general election and the Electoral College vote. Wallace ultimately carried four Southern states under the American Independent Party banner, in addition to his home state of Alabama in which he ran as the official nominee of the state&#x27;s Democratic Party. While a shift of a few thousand votes in a handful of key states would have resulted in no candidate winning a clear majority of the electoral vote, Republican Richard Nixon ultimately won a clear majority of the electoral vote. Unable to influence the result, Wallace&#x27;s 45 electors voted as pledged - he ultimately finished with 46 electoral votes due to the support of a North Carolinian faithless elector.

Following Nixon&#x27;s triumph in 1968, former Southern Democratic supporters began voting Republican in large numbers. By 1972, Wallace was seeking the national Democratic nomination on a more moderate platform in a presidential campaign that was ultimately cut short after he was seriously wounded by a would-be assassin. Nixon would sweep the South in his landslide victory that year. By the time the Democrats regained the White House following the 1976 election, it was under the candidacy of Jimmy Carter, a Southerner who in contrast to most of his predecessors was firmly opposed to segregation. Carter nevertheless managed to almost sweep the South, with Virginia being the only former Confederate state to not vote for him. Many other Southern Democrats, including Wallace himself, would soon follow Carter&#x27;s lead.

The 1976 presidential was the last such contest in which the Democratic nominee carried a majority of Southern states. Today, the practice of nominating unpledged electors combined with Wallace&#x27;s third-party presidential campaign can be seen as a transitional phase between the Democrats&#x27; traditional hold on the South and the modern political environment where the region is a Republican stronghold and where state Democratic parties, while still more conservative in some respects compared to other regions, tend to be to the left of the Republicans as in the rest of the country and tend to be more supported in predominantly African-American locales.

<text>Amitai Etzioni (; Hebrew: אמיתי עציוני; né Werner Falk; 4 January 1929 – 31 May 2023) was an Israeli-American sociologist, best known for his work on socioeconomics and communitarianism. He founded the Communitarian Network, a non-profit, non-partisan organization dedicated to supporting the moral, social, and political foundations of society. He established the network to disseminate the movement&#x27;s ideas. His writings argue for a carefully crafted balance between individual rights and social responsibilities, and between autonomy and order, in social structure. In 2001, he was named among the top 100 American intellectuals, as measured by academic citations, in Richard Posner&#x27;s book, &quot;Public Intellectuals: A Study of Decline&quot;. 

Etzioni was the Director of the Institute for Communitarian Policy Studies at The George Washington University, where he also served as a professor of International Affairs.

==Early life and education==
Amitai Etzioni was born Werner Falk in Cologne, Germany in 1929 to a Jewish family. In January 1933, Etzioni was only four years old when the car he was riding in made a sharp turn and, in response, he grabbed a handle that opened the door. Etzioni was pulled back into the car at the last moment by his father, but, as noted in his memoir, &quot;My Brother&#x27;s Keeper&quot;, this memory foreshadowed the upcoming doom that would overtake his homeland during the Nazi rule.

Later in 1933, Etzioni and his grandparents were walking through the forest next to Frankfurt when they came upon a forest fire. Suddenly, Hitler Youth ventured into the forest, riding in two trucks. Etzioni&#x27;s grandparents reacted by grabbing Amitai and rushing down the hill without explaining what happened in this close encounter with the Nazis, which fed into his sense of fear and foreboding.

By the time he turned five, both of his parents had escaped to London, which left Etzioni in the care of his grandparents. Etzioni was smuggled out of Germany soon afterwards, arriving at a train station in Italy with a non-Jewish relative, who soon reunited Etzioni with his parents. Etzioni was stuck with his parents in Athens, Greece for a year, unable to enter Palestine since his family was awarded a bachelor permit instead of a family permit. When the paperwork was finally resolved, Etzioni found himself learning Hebrew in Haifa, Mandatory Palestine in the winter of 1937.

At this time, he began to go by the first name &quot;Amitai&quot; instead of Werner, since the principal of Etzioni&#x27;s new school strongly encouraged Etzioni to introduce himself by a Hebrew name. He was given the name Amitai based on the Hebrew word for truth (&quot;emet&quot;) and the name of Jonah&#x27;s father in the Tanach (&quot;Amittai&quot;). Etzioni moved with his family to a small village, Herzliya Gimmel, which served as a base for an emerging community called Kfar Shmaryahu. When Etzioni was eight, he moved to the new village, where his family was assigned to a small, boxlike new house and a small farming lot. In the spring of 1941, Etzioni&#x27;s father left to join the Jewish Brigade, which was a Jewish unit formed within the British army. Etzioni, at the age of thirteen, was struggling at school, which then caused his mother to send him to a boarding school in Ben Shemen.

In the spring of 1946, at the age of seventeen, Etzioni dropped out of high school to join the Palmach, the elite commando force of the Haganah, the underground army of the Jewish community of Palestine, and was sent to Tel Yosef for military training. When the Palmach learned that the British police had captured a list of the Palmach members, they were issued new, fake ID cards and had to choose new last names. Amitai Falk chose &quot;Etzioni&quot;, a pen name he had used when he started writing in Ben Shemen at age 15.

During Etzioni&#x27;s time in the Palmach, it carried out a campaign of blowing up bridges and police stations to drive out the British, who were blocking Jews escaping post-Holocaust Europe from immigrating to Palestine and standing in the way of the establishment of a Jewish state. In contrast to the Irgun, the Palmach largely sought to affect British and global public opinion rather than cause casualties. Etzioni describes his early life and decision to join the Palmach in the video &quot;The Making of a Peacenik&quot;. Etzioni&#x27;s Palmach unit participated in the defense of Jerusalem, which was under siege by the Arab Legion. His unit sneaked through Arab lines to fight to defend Jerusalem and to open a corridor to Tel Aviv, participating in the Battles of Latrun and the establishment of the Burma Road.

Following the war, Etzioni spent a year studying at an institute established by Martin Buber. In 1951, he enrolled in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he completed both BA (1954) and MA (1956) degrees in sociology. In 1957, he went to the United States to study at the University of California, Berkeley, and was a research assistant to Seymour Martin Lipset. He received his PhD in sociology in 1958, completing the degree in the record time of 18 months.

==Work==
Etzioni authored over 30 books. About half are academic, the most important of which is &quot;The Active Society&quot;, and half written for the public, especially &quot;The Spirit of Community&quot;. His early academic work focused on organizational theory, resulting in the often-cited &quot;A Comparative Analysis of Complex Organizations&quot;, published in 1961.

The book was well received in academic circles. A book review in &quot;Political Science Quarterly&quot; by Peter Fricke called it &quot;a principal text for students of organizations.&quot; The book established Etzioni&#x27;s academic credentials and led to many studies, which Etzioni reviewed and included in a revised edition of the same title, published in 1975. He expressed the same basic ideas in a much shorter book, Modern Organizations, which was translated into a large number of languages.

Much of Etzioni&#x27;s best-known work is about communitarianism. According to Etzioni, communitarianism is centered on the communal definition of good. It thus stresses the role of community in social and political life and institutions. It rose in response to libertarianism and some forms of contemporary liberalism, both of which are centered on liberty and individual rights. Etzioni contrasts his version of what he calls &quot;liberal communitarianism&quot; with that championed by some East Asian public intellectuals, who extolled social obligations and accorded much less weight to liberty and individual rights.

Liberal communitarianism, as developed by Etzioni, formulated criteria for developing public policies that enable societies to deal with conflicts between the common good and individual rights. These include: (1) no major change in governing public policies and norms is justified unless society encounters serious challenges, (2) limitations on rights can be considered only if there are significant gains to the common good, and (3) adverse side effects that result from policy changes must be treated by introducing strong measures of accountability and oversight. Etzioni worked this out in two of his books, &quot;The Limits of Privacy&quot; (1999) and &quot;The New Normal&quot; (2015). Etzioni stresses that preferences are, to a significant extent, socially constructed and hence reflect the values of the communities people are members of. Therefore, one should not treat preferences as unadulterated expressions of individual freedom and should allow for public education to improve these preferences when they turn asocial and surely when they turn anti-social in dogmatic liberal societies.

His main communitarian books are &quot;The New Golden Rule&quot; (1996), &quot;The New Normal&quot; (2015), &quot;Law and Society in a Populist Age&quot; (2018), and &quot;How Patriotic is the Patriot Act&quot; (2005). His communitarian treatment of privacy is spelled out in &quot;The Limits of Privacy&quot; (1999) and &quot;Privacy in a Cyber Age&quot; (2015).

Etzioni&#x27;s contributions to socioeconomics are found in &quot;The Moral Dimension&quot; (1988) and &quot;Happiness is the Wrong Metric&quot; (2018). His main argument is that, in neoclassical economics (the governing form of economics), predictions are poor, the theory about human nature is wrong-headed, and the normative implications are negative. He holds that, rather than assuming that people are seeking to maximize their own utility, one should assume that people are conflicted between (1) their commitments to moral values and the common good and (2) their self-interest. He hence characterized people as &quot;moral wrestlers.&quot; He showed that people act mainly as members of social groups, rather than as free-standing agents. Typically, the main issue is not that the government interferes unduly in the market, but that concentrations of economic power in the private sector unduly affect the government and social life.

Etzioni considers &quot;The Active Society&quot; his most important work. The book was published in 1968. It starts by discussing philosophical questions about the extent to which people have free will and the extent to which human fate is predetermined, beyond our understanding and control. It dives into theories related to steering mechanisms that put people in control of inanimate systems, like factory machines, and then demonstrates that democratic processes must be involved in expanding this type of theory to societies and affecting history. Democracy is crucial, because people must participate in creating the signals to which they will respond.

Later, the book describes the four key parts of a social steering system: decision-making strategies, consensus-building, knowledge, and power. The last part of the book examines human needs and seeks to determine whether they can be altered or whether they remain static. If it is the latter (that human needs are constant), Etzioni looks for ways to guarantee that we restructure society to meet these fixed needs, instead of getting roped into a restructuring scheme that satisfies the needs that society is willing and able to meet, without regard for whether those are the needs that truly need to be met. &quot;The Active Society&quot; received positive feedback from reviewers, with one reviewer writing that:I consider this to be one of the most important books in its field in the last twenty years. Apart from its substantive contribution to the strategy of societal activation, it offers a whole focus of immensely valuable perspectives for detailed empirical investigation in the future.

Betty Friedan wrote that &quot;The Active Society&quot; provided a &quot;philosophical grounding&quot; to her work as a leader of the women&#x27;s movement. His last book, &quot;Reclaiming Patriotism&quot;, was published by University of Virginia Press in 2019.

Etzioni was active in the peace movement, the campaign against nuclear weapons, and the protests against the war in Vietnam. This led to two popular books, &quot;The Hard Way to Peace&quot; (1962) and &quot;Winning without War&quot; (1964), and, in later years, to &quot;From Empire to Community&quot;, &quot;Security First&quot;, &quot;Hot Spots&quot;, and &quot;Foreign Policy: Thinking Outside the Box&quot;. He spelled out ways to make China a partner in world order in &quot;Avoiding War with China&quot; (2017). His main argument in these books is that the world needs a global community and worldwide forms of governance; however, because people are strongly invested in nations, the world is not ready to transition to a global community. Hence, transnational arrangements must continue to be based on national representations. He shows that democracy must be largely homegrown and cannot be introduced by foreign powers through the use of force.

Etzioni has published many scores of academic articles, including law reviews, many of which can be found on SSRN, as well as hundreds of popular articles in the press and online. His papers are deposited with the Library of Congress.

The following books review Etzioni&#x27;s work: &quot;Communitarian Foreign Policy: Amitai Etzioni&#x27;s Vision&quot;, by Nikolas K. Gvosdev; &quot;The Active Society Revisited&quot;, edited by Wilson Carey McWilliams; &quot;Amitai Etzioni zur Einführung&quot;, written by Walter Reese-Schafer; and &quot;Etzioni&#x27;s Critical Functionalism Communitarian Origins and Principles&quot;, by David Sciulli. See also a short documentary by Kevin Hudson, &quot;The Making of a Peacenik.&quot;

In 2019, Etzioni celebrated his 90th birthday at Arena Stage, where he launched, curated, and moderated a series of civil dialogues, bringing together public intellectuals with differing points of view on various topics. The videos of these dialogues, as well as many of Etzioni&#x27;s appearances on television, can be found on YouTube.

===Criticism===
In Simon Prideaux&#x27;s &quot;From Organisational Theory to the New Communitarium of Amitai Etzioni&quot;, he argues that Etzioni&#x27;s communitarian methods are archaic, and based upon earlier functionalist definitions of organizations. This is because his methodology fails to address any possible contradictions within the socioeconomic foundations of society. Prideaux states that Etzioni&#x27;s vision of a communitarian society is &quot;heavily predicated upon what he sees as having gone wrong with present-day social relations&quot;(Prideaux 70). Also, Etzioni&#x27;s communitarian analysis uses a methodology which existed before the development of an organizational theory. According to Prideaux, Etzioni has taken the methodological influence of structural-functionalism beyond the realms of its organizational branch and fabricated it into a solution to solve the problems of modern society. Etzioni&#x27;s arguments on the creation of a new communitarian society are restricted to the strengths and weaknesses he witnesses in the American society in which he has lived since the 1950s. This bias &quot;neglects and denies the importance of differences within communities and among communities in different countries.&quot;

Elizabeth Frazer, in &quot;The Problems of Communitarian Politics: Unity and Conflict&quot;, argues that Etzioni&#x27;s concept of the &quot;nature of community&quot; is vague and elusive, in regards to the idea that the community is involved with every stage of government policies. She also mentions Etzioni&#x27;s thought that the community has a moral standing equal to that of the individual when she firmly believes it is just the opposite. Warren Breed&#x27;s &quot;The Self-Guiding Society&quot; provides a critical overview of &quot;The Active Society&quot;. David Sciulli&#x27;s &quot;Etzioni&#x27;s Critical Functionalism: Communitarian Origins and Principles&quot; evaluates Etzioni&#x27;s &quot;functionalism&quot;.

Etzioni was criticized in 2016 for publishing an article titled &quot;Should Israel Flatten Beirut to Destroy Hezbollah&#x27;s Missiles?&quot; Lebanese journalist and human rights researcher Kareen Chehayeb called it &quot;ludicrous&quot; that a prominent American professor &quot;can just calmly say the solution is to flatten this entire city of 1 million people.&quot;

==Personal life==
After graduating with his PhD, Etzioni then remained in the United States to pursue a career as an academic and public intellectual. He became an American citizen in 1963, shortly after he was elected to the board of Americans for Democratic Action. Etzioni met a fellow student named Hava Horowitz while studying sociology in Israel. They married in 1953. Etzioni and Hava relocated to the United States in 1957. They had two sons together: Ethan (born 1958) and Oren (born 1964). In 1964, Hava and Etzioni divorced and she returned to Israel. In his autobiography, Etzioni wrote that the divorce was one of his &quot;gravest personal failures. We should have found a way.&quot;

In 1966, Etzioni married Mexican scholar Minerva Morales. They had three sons: Michael, David, and Benjamin. Morales was raised Catholic, but converted to Judaism, Etzioni&#x27;s religion. On 20 December 1985, Minerva was killed in a car crash. Etzioni wrote of his considerable grief over her death and that of his son Michael, who died of a heart attack in 2006, leaving behind a pregnant wife and a son. In 1992, Etzioni married Patricia Kellogg.

Etzioni provided a personal account of his work and life in a memoir called &quot;My Brother&#x27;s Keeper&quot;. He augmented this account with an essay about losing his public voice called &quot;My Kingdom for a Wave.&quot; He revealed his early childhood experiences to be the source of his feelings against war and aggression in a short video, called &quot;The Making of a Peacenik.&quot;

Etzioni lived at the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C., where he died on 31 May 2023, at the age of 94.

<doc id="1020129" wikidata="Q6106944" url="?curid=1020129" title="J. Richardson Dilworth">
<text>Joseph Richardson Dilworth (June 9, 1916 – December 29, 1997) was a leading businessman, best known for being a senior financial adviser for the Rockefeller family. He also served as a director at many other companies and financial institutions including Chrysler Corporation, Macy&#x27;s, the Squibb Corporation. He was a member of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.

==Early life and career==

Dilworth was born on June 9, 1916, in Hewlett hamlet in Long Island, New York. His parents were Edith Logan Dilworth and investment banker Dewees Wood Dilworth. His uncle was politician Richardson Dilworth.

He attended the Buckley School in Manhattan and St. Mark&#x27;s School in Southborough, Massachusetts. Dilworth graduated from Yale University in 1938, where he was a member of Skull and Bones, and the Yale Law school in 1942. 

Dilworth served in the United States Navy during World War II. He was a partner of the investment bank Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co. from 1952 to 1958.

==Rockefeller Financial Advisor==

Dilworth is best known for being the leading manager of Room 5600, known now as Rockefeller Family &amp; Associates, the family office of the Rockefeller family, situated on the 54-56th floors of the GE Building, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, in Rockefeller Center.

Beginning in 1956, he headed the family office and was the senior financial adviser to the family and its investments and philanthropic institutions for 23 years, retiring in 1981. During this time he also sat on the board of directors of the family-associated Chase Manhattan Bank and was a personal friend of its chairman, David Rockefeller.

In 1974 he came into public prominence when he appeared before the United States Congress during the confirmation hearings for Nelson Rockefeller&#x27;s nomination by Gerald Ford for the vice-presidency; during his presentation to Congressmen he outlined the overall wealth of Nelson&#x27;s family.

In his service for the six-generation dynastic clan, Dilworth served up until 1982 as the chair of the company that previously owned Rockefeller Center, &quot;Rockefeller Center Inc.&quot; (RCI), which is now the Rockefeller Group. He also sat on the boards of many other corporations, some of which were directly associated with the family.

While Dilworth worked for a famed employer - the Rockefellers - he also had at least one notable employee working for him. In 1963 to 1964, will still associated with Dilworth, William Thaddeus Coleman Jr. served as Assistant Counsel to that 36th U.S. President&#x27;s Commission most commonly referred to as the Warren Commission.

== Death ==
On Monday, December 29, 1997, J. Richardson Dilworth died at the age of 81 at the Princeton Hospital in Princeton, New Jersey, the community where he lived during retirement. 

He was survived by his wife, Elizabeth McKay Cushing, and three children. He was preceded in death by his daughter Melissa Dilworth Gold (1944–1991), who was formerly married to novelist Herbert Gold and lawyer Robert L. Anderson. She was in a relationship with promoter Bill Graham at the time of their accidental deaths in 1991. His grandson, Ari Gold, is an independent filmmaker.

<doc id="1020158" wikidata="Q2702466" url="?curid=1020158" title="Philemon Dickinson">
<text>Philemon Dickinson (April 5, 1739February 4, 1809) was an American lawyer and politician from Trenton, New Jersey. As a brigadier general of the New Jersey militia, he was one of the most effective militia officers of the American Revolutionary War. He was also a Continental Congressman from Delaware and a United States Senator from New Jersey.

==Background==
Philemon Dickinson was born at &quot;Crosiadore,&quot; near Trappe, Maryland on April 5, 1739, a younger brother of Founding Father John Dickinson. When he was one, his family moved to Delaware. He was educated by a private tutor until he went to the University of Pennsylvania, from where he graduated in 1759. He then studied law, and was admitted to the bar, but never practiced. In 1767, Dickinson moved to Trenton to an estate called &quot;The Hermitage&quot;. On July 14, 1767, he married his first cousin, Mary Cadwalader (1746–1781). They had two children; Samuel (1770–1837) and Mary (1768–1822).

==Military service==
Dickinson served as an officer during the American Revolutionary War, rising to the rank of Major General in the New Jersey Militia.

At the beginning of the Revolutionary War in 1775 he was commissioned a colonel of the Hunterdon County militia. In 1776 he was elected as a delegate to New Jersey&#x27;s Revolutionary provincial congress. In January 1777 Dickinson led 400 of his militia in a raid on a British foraging party near Somerset Court House, New Jersey, capturing about forty wagons of supplies and several prisoners. In June 1777 he was appointed major general in command of all New Jersey militia, a post he held throughout the rest of the war.

In November 1777 Dickinson led 1,400 men in a raid on Staten Island. While the attack was expected by Loyalist General Skinner and repulsed, Dickinson&#x27;s party killed five and took 24 prisoners. Dickinson took several New Jersey Volunteers prisoner, including Lieutenant Jacob Van Buskirk, Lieutenant Edward Earle and Surgeon John Hammell.

Dickinson&#x27;s militia took part in the Battle of Monmouth in 1778, helping obstruct the retreat of the British to New York. When his cousin John Cadwalader dueled General Thomas Conway on July 4, 1778, Dickinson was Cadwalader&#x27;s second.

==Post Revolution Public Service==
In 1782 and 1783, he represented Delaware at the Continental Congress. In 1783-84 he was elected to the New Jersey Legislative Council from Hunterdon County where he served as Vice-President of Council both years. He was a member of the commission that selected the site for the national capital in Washington, D.C., in 1784. When William Paterson resigned from the United States Senate, Dickinson was chosen by New Jersey to finish Paterson&#x27;s term. He served in the senate from November 13, 1790, to March 3, 1793.

==Death==
After his service in Congress, he returned to look after his estates until he died on February 4, 1809, at his home, and was buried at Friends Burying Ground in Trenton.

<doc id="1020173" wikidata="Q337761" url="?curid=1020173" title="Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset">
<text>Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset (24 January 164329 January 1706) was an English politician, courtier and poet.

==Early life==
Sackville was born on 24 January 1643, son of Richard Sackville, 5th Earl of Dorset (1622–1677). His mother was the former Lady Frances Cranfield, sister and heiress of the 3rd Earl of Middlesex, to whose estates he succeeded in 1674, being created Baron Cranfield, of Cranfield in the County of Middlesex, and Earl of Middlesex in 1675. He succeeded to his father&#x27;s estates and title in August 1677. He was educated privately, and spent some time abroad with a private tutor, returning to England shortly before the Restoration.

==Career==
During King Charles II&#x27;s first Parliament, Sackville sat for East Grinstead in Sussex. He had no taste for politics, however, but won a reputation at Whitehall as a courtier and a wit.

Although an unscrupulous rake, something in Sackville&#x27;s character made his follies less obnoxious to the citizens than those of the other rakes, for he was never altogether unpopular, and Rochester is said to have told Charles II that &quot;he did not know how it was, my Lord Dorset might do anything, yet was never to blame&quot;. In 1665 he volunteered to serve under the Duke of York in the Second Anglo-Dutch War. His famous song, &quot;To All You Ladies Now at Land&quot;, was written, according to Prior, on the night before the victory gained over foggy Opdam off Harwich (3 June 1665). Samuel Johnson, with the remark that seldom any splendid story is wholly true, said that the Earl of Orrery had told him it was only retouched on that occasion.

In 1667, Pepys lamented that Sackville had lured Nell Gwyn away from the theatre, and that with Sedley the two kept merry house at Epsom. Next year the king was paying court to Gwyn, and her Charles the Second, as she called him (Charles Hart, a former lover, being her Charles the First), was sent on a &quot;sleeveless errand&quot; into France to be out of the way. In 1678 he narrowly escaped death at the hands of the deranged Earl of Pembroke, with whom he was engaged in a lawsuit.

His gaiety and wit secured the continued favour of Charles II, but did not especially recommend him to James II, who could not, moreover, forgive Dorset&#x27;s lampoons on his mistress, Catherine Sedley, Countess of Dorchester. On James&#x27;s accession, therefore, he retired from court. Sackville concurred in the invitation to William of Orange, who made him a Privy Counsellor, Lord Chamberlain (1689), and Knight of the Garter (1692). During William&#x27;s absences between 1695 and 1698, Sackville was one of the Lords Justices of the Realm. In 1699 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society

He was a generous patron of men of letters. When John Dryden was dismissed from the laureateship, he made him an equivalent pension from his own purse. Matthew Prior, in dedicating his &quot;Poems on Several Occasions&quot; (1709) to Dorset&#x27;s son, affirms that his opinion was consulted by Edmund Waller; that the Duke of Buckingham deferred the publication of his &quot;Rehearsal&quot; until he was assured that Dorset would not rehearse upon him again; and that Samuel Butler and William Wycherley both owed their first recognition to him. Prior&#x27;s praise of Dorset is no doubt extravagant, but when his youthful follies were over he appears to have developed sterling qualities, and although the poems he has left are very few, none of them are devoid of merit. Dryden&#x27;s &quot;Essay on Satire&quot; and the dedication of the &quot;Essay of Dramatick Poesie&quot; are addressed to him. Walpole (&quot;Catalogue of Noble Authors&quot;, iv.) says that he had as much wit as his first master, or his contemporaries Buckingham and Rochester, without the royal want of feeling, the duke&#x27;s want of principles or the earl&#x27;s want of thought; and Congreve reported of him when he was dying that he slabbered more wit than other people had in their best health.

==Merry Gang==
Sackville was part of the &quot;Merry Gang&quot; (as Andrew Marvell described them). The &quot;Merry Gang&quot; flourished for about 15 years after 1665 and included John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester Henry Jermyn; John Sheffield, Earl of Mulgrave; Henry Killigrew; Sir Charles Sedley; the playwrights William Wycherley and George Etherege; and George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham. The Merry Gang were advocates of libertinism. Members of the gang asserted the right to behave as they pleased and their antics were intended to draw the attention and amusement of the king. Rochester claimed his aim was to halt &quot;the strange decay of manly parts since the days of dear Harry the Second ()&quot;. The gang engaged in acts that were violent, outraged public decency and often included violence against women.

Sackville&#x27;s behavior was as profligate and depraved as his notorious friends Sir Charles Sedley and Lord Rochester. In 1662, Sackville and his brother Edward, with three other gentlemen, were indicted for the robbery and murder of a tanner named Hoppy. The defence was that they were in pursuit of thieves, and mistook Hoppy for a highwayman. They appear to have been acquitted, for when, in 1663, Sedley was tried for a gross breach of public decency in Covent Garden, Sackville, who had been one of the offenders, was (according to Samuel Pepys) asked by the Lord Chief Justice &quot;whether he had so soon forgot his deliverance at that time, and that it would have more become him to have been at his prayers begging God&#x27;s forgiveness than now running into such courses again.&quot;

In June 1675 &quot;John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester in a frolick after a rant did ... beat downe the dyill (i.e. sundial) which stood in the middle of the Privie Garding, which was esteemed the rarest in Europ&quot;. John Aubrey learned what Rochester said on this occasion when he came in from his &quot;revells&quot; with Sackville, and Fleetwood Sheppard to see the object: What ... doest thou stand here to fuck time?&#x27; Dash they fell to worke&quot;. It has been speculated that the comment refers not to the dial itself, which was not phallic in appearance, but a painting of the King next to the dial that featured his phallic sceptre.

==Marriages==
Sackville was three times married; he married his first wife Mary Bagot, widow of Charles Berkeley, Earl of Falmouth and daughter of Hervey Bagot and Dorothy Arden, in June 1674. He married his second wife, Mary Compton, daughter of James Compton, 3rd Earl of Northampton and Hon. Mary Noel, on 7 March 1685; they had two children together, Lionel Cranfield Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset and Mary Sackville (1689–1705). He fathered two illegitimate daughters, one named Mary Sackville (died 26 June 1714), and the other with actress Alice Lee, named Anne Lee Sackville (1667–1738). He died at Bath in 1706.

==Works==
The fourth act of &quot;Pompey the Great&quot;, a tragedy translated out of French by certain persons of honour, is by Dorset. The satires for which Pope classed him with the masters in that kind seem to have been short lampoons, with the exception of &quot;A faithful catalogue of our most eminent ninnies&quot; (reprinted in &quot;Bibliotheca Curiosa&quot;, ed. Goldsmid, 1885). &quot;The Works of the Earls of Rochester, Roscommon and Dorset, the Dukes of Devonshire, Buckinghamshire, &amp;c., with Memoirs of their Lives&quot; (1731) is catalogued (No. 20841) by H. G. Bohn in 1841. His poems are included in Anderson&#x27;s and other collections of British poets.

==Portrayal in film==
Sackville is portrayed by Johnny Vegas as the invariable companion of fellow author and wit George Etherege (Tom Hollander) in the 2004 film &quot;The Libertine&quot;, an adaptation of Stephen Jeffreys&#x27; play of the same name, which depicts the Earl of Rochester and the orbit of the &quot;Merry Gang&quot;.

Both Rose Creek and Rose Canyon are named for San Diego pioneer Louis Rose, who had a ranch in the canyon in the 1850s. 

The Rose Creek watershed comprises approximately 36 square miles. On both sides of the creek in San Clemente Canyon there is a 467-acre city natural park called Marion Bear Park. The wetland where the creek historically entered Mission Bay is known as the Kendall Frost Marsh and is studied and managed by the University of California, San Diego. However, Rose Creek was diverted and channelized in the first half of the 20th century and now enters Mission Bay through an artificial channel further east. 

The Rose Creek Watershed Alliance was created in 2005 to create a plan to improve the watershed. The plan was accepted by the City of San Diego in 2008. A volunteer group called the Friends of Rose Creek conducts periodic cleanups. The city has applied for a permit to clear vegetation from the lower creek channel in an effort to prevent flooding.

<text>Jonathan Elmer (November 29, 1745September 3, 1817) was an American politician, of the Pro-Administration (Federalist) Party.

==Early life==
Jonathan Elmer was born in Cedarville, New Jersey, in 1745. He was the son of Reverend Daniel Elmer and Abigail (Lawrence) Elmer. He was privately tutored until 1765, when he began attendance in the first class of medical students at the University of Pennsylvania. He received the degree of bachelor of medicine in 1768, and 1771 he received his doctor of medicine degree, the first awarded by an American university.

==Early career==
Elmer practiced medicine in Bridgeton and became active in government and politics. From 1772 to 1775, he served as sheriff of Cumberland County. During the American Revolutionary War he was a militia officer and attained the rank of captain as commander of a company. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1774.

==Later career==
Elmer was a delegate to the Continental Congress three times: 1777 to 1778, 1781 to 1783, and 1787 to 1788. In 1780 and 1784 he represented Cumberland County in the New Jersey Legislative Council. The College of New Jersey (now known as Princeton University) made Elmer a trustee in 1782. He served in that position until 1795. The New Jersey Legislature appointed Elmer to the United States Senate for the term of March 4, 1789 to March 3, 1791. He was later a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1792, and unsuccessfully attempted to return to the U.S. Senate twice in 1798.

His health declined after that, and Elmer died in 1817, and he was interred in Old Broad Street Presbyterian Church Cemetery in Bridgeton.

==Family==
In 1769, Elmer married Mary Seeley, the daughter of Colonel Ephraim Seeley of Bridgeton. They were the parents of eight children.

Elmer&#x27;s younger brother, Ebenezer Elmer, and Ebenezer&#x27;s son Lucius Elmer were members of the United States House of Representatives.

<doc id="1020215" wikidata="Q3235662" url="?curid=1020215" title="Namanga">
<text>Namanga is a town divided by the Tanzania-Kenya border. It is in Longido District, Tanzania and Kajiado County, Kenya. It is around 110 kilometers from Arusha, Tanzania. Namanga&#x27;s economy has been heavily dependent on tourism since 2004 as tourists visiting the nearby Amboseli National Park passed through the town from Nairobi (183 kilometers to the north). The town is surrounded by hills on both sides. Mount Kilimanjaro can be viewed from Namanga town which makes it a scenic place by tourists who lodge in Namanga on their way to either Tanzania or Amboseli. The nearby Ol Doinyo Orok mountain, also known as Namanga Hills is located northwest of Namanga town. Namanga&#x27;s latitude is S 2°32&#x27;39.8&quot; and longitude E 36°47&#x27;20.2&quot;. The town has an urban population of approximately 10,000 while the rural population is approximately 5,500.

==Economic development==

The economy of Namanga has been on the rise as it ceased to depend only on tourism. The town is currently dependent both on tourism and on import and export from both Kenya and Tanzania. With the opening of the East African Community borders, the town will benefit from market of both countries which according to the statistical bureau of Kenya will trigger a population growth of the town to an approximate of 30,000. With the recent investment by the financial institutions and the completion of the great north road, the town has grown economical especially in its infrastructure. This development has increased transport activities from the area as it triggered more importation of commodities from Tanzania to Kenya as it is assumed to be cheaper.

==Population diversity==
Namanga is a cosmopolitan town. Its population includes several tribes from all part of the country. Its main population is from the Maasai community who occupy most of the parts in Namanga. The Kikuyu communities are second in majority. This was catalyzed by the intermarriage between the Maasai and the Kikuyu. The rest of the population is occupied by other ethnicity groups which include the Kamba, the Cushites who are Somalis, Borana and many other more communities.

<doc id="1020222" wikidata="Q5142532" url="?curid=1020222" title="Coldheart Canyon">
<text>Coldheart Canyon is a novel by Clive Barker, published in 2001 by HarperCollins. The paperback edition was published by HarperTorch on November 5, 2002 (). The story centers on Todd Pickett, a failing movie star, and Tammy Lauper, Todd&#x27;s obsessive fan.

==Synopsis==
The story begins in Romania during the 1920s, where poverty and disease run rampant. American talent agent Willem Zeffer and the Romanian-born actress he represents, Katya Lupi, have travelled there in order to visit Katya&#x27;s relatives. Zeffer visits an old medieval castle which has been turned into a monastery and decides to buy a unique work of art, a series of sculpted and painted tiles depicting, in a grotesque and obscene manner, the local legend of a Count who was cursed to haunt the nearby wilderness for all eternity.

The second part of the story begins in the year 2000, when failing movie star Todd Pickett decides to undergo plastic surgery to make himself look younger as prelude to his professional comeback. Something goes wrong during the surgery, and Todd, now disfigured, is forced to go into hiding during his recovery. His agent selects Katya Lupi&#x27;s former home, an abandoned house in Coldheart Canyon, a secluded area outside Hollywood, where Todd soon discovers that Katya and her &quot;subjects&quot; still hold court.

==Reception==
&quot;Coldheart Canyon&quot; received favorable reviews. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; called it &quot;one of the most accomplished, and most notable, novels of the year&quot;. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; said, &quot;If you can tolerate Barker at his most fantastical and effusive, you won’t want to miss Coldheart Canyon.&quot;

&quot;Booklist&quot; also reviewed the novel.

In 2002, the audiobook won the Audie Award for Solo Narration - Male.

<doc id="1020223" wikidata="Q2704219" url="?curid=1020223" title="Evan Dando">
<text>Evan Griffith Dando (born March 4, 1967) is an American musician and the frontman of the rock band the Lemonheads. He has also embarked on a solo career and collaborated on songs with various artists. In December 2015, Dando was inducted into the Boston Music Awards Hall of Fame.

== Early life and education ==
Dando was born in Essex, Massachusetts, on Boston&#x27;s North Shore, to Susan, a former fashion model, and Jeffrey, who worked as a real estate attorney. At the age of nine, his family moved from Essex to Boston; his parents divorced two years later. In his teens Dando attended Commonwealth School in Boston. In the fall of 1986 he enrolled at Skidmore College but dropped out after getting &quot;four Fs and a D.&quot;

== Career ==

=== The Lemonheads ===
While at Commonwealth, Dando met Ben Deily and Jesse Peretz, and in 1986 they formed the Whelps before changing their name to Lemonheads, like that of the candy manufactured by Ferrara Pan. The Lemonheads debuted at the Meltdown House in Cambridge on July 18, 1986, followed by a show at The Rat on August 19. The band recorded an EP, &quot;Laughing All the Way to the Cleaners&quot;, which got the attention of Taang! Records, a local label. The Lemonheads&#x27; first three albums, &quot;Hate Your Friends&quot;, &quot;Creator&quot;, and &quot;Lick&quot;, were all released on Taang!

Following the third album, Dando left the group briefly after some tension with Deily, and joined Juliana Hatfield&#x27;s band Blake Babies. However, he returned as a drummer when The Lemonheads&#x27; cover of Suzanne Vega&#x27;s song &quot;Luka&quot; became successful, and the group had an opportunity to tour Europe. Deily, however, quit the band shortly before the tour, and Dando replaced him as the guitarist and lead vocalist. Dando brought in David Ryan on drums, and the group signed with Atlantic Records, releasing the album &quot;Lovey&quot; in 1990.

Dando spent some time in Australia to write songs with friends Nic Dalton and Tom Morgan, who later started the band Sneeze. Some of his songs formed the basis for The Lemonheads&#x27; fifth album, &quot;It&#x27;s a Shame About Ray&quot;. In 1992, The Lemonheads recorded a punk-inflected cover of Simon and Garfunkel&#x27;s hit &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; to help promote the VHS release of &quot;The Graduate&quot; for the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary. The song reached number 19 on the UK Singles Chart in December 1992, and was included in the album&#x27;s re-release as a bonus track. Dando initially disliked the song&#x27;s inclusion on the album, feeling like he was tricked by his label, who asked him to record it. After seeing the track being played in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot;, however, his opinions towards the track changed. Dando&#x27;s face appeared on several magazine covers, and &quot;People&quot; listed him among the &quot;50 Most Beautiful People&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Q&quot; magazine, he admitted he smoked crack cocaine and regretted it. In late 1993, the group released the album &quot;Come on Feel the Lemonheads&quot;, which featured singles &quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot;, &quot;Big Gay Heart&quot;, and &quot;Into Your Arms&quot;. During the group&#x27;s touring in 1994, Dando befriended Oasis and appeared at some of their live shows. He also made a cameo appearance at the end of the 1994 film &quot;Reality Bites&quot;.

Dando re-formed The Lemonheads with former member John Strohm on guitar, Bill Gibson, former bassist of Australian band The Eastern Dark, and Patrick Murphy, a former member of Dinosaur Jr., on drums. The group released the album &quot;Car Button Cloth&quot; in 1996. In 1997 the band went on tour and played its final gig at the Reading Festival, after which the band went on hiatus.

In 2005, Dando put together a new lineup for The Lemonheads which included Karl Alvarez and Bill Stevenson, formerly of the Descendents. In April 2006, they signed with Vagrant Records, and released a self-titled album in September. Dando also had a lineup which included bassist Vess Ruhtenberg and drummer Devon Ashley of the Pieces where they toured the UK, Europe and the United States. In late 2007, Alvarez and Stevenson toured with Dando for the first time live on the US tour. In 2008, he toured with Ruhtenberg and Ashley to promote the re-release of a deluxe version of &quot;It&#x27;s a Shame About Ray&quot;, and then toured with Ruhtenberg and drummer P. David Hazel of Beta Male for a European Tour. On April 23, 2008, at the inaugural &quot;NME&quot; US Awards ceremony held at the El Rey in Los Angeles, Dando received a Classic Album award for &quot;It&#x27;s A Shame About Ray&quot;, although &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reported that he threw the award in the garbage offstage, and then returned to perform &quot;Ray&quot; and &quot;My Drug Buddy&quot;.

In 2009 the Lemonheads released &quot;Varshons&quot;, a collection of 11 covers, including tracks originally recorded by Gram Parsons, Wire, GG Allin, Christina Aguilera; the album featured vocal performances by actress Liv Tyler and model Kate Moss. For many of the tours since 2010, The Lemonheads have included the entire &quot;It&#x27;s a Shame About Ray&quot; album on the setlist.

=== Solo career and collaborations ===

Dando worked with Australian musicians Nic Dalton and Tom Morgan, both of whom have been involved with The Lemonheads. In Sydney, he joined Dalton, Morgan, and a number of Half A Cow artists on a self-titled album by the band Sneeze and the album &quot;Coastal&quot; by Godstar. Dando participated in the Australian band the Givegoods, which featured Paul Dempsey of Something for Kate.

Dando has worked regularly with Juliana Hatfield where he appeared on several Blake Babies songs and she in turn played with The Lemonheads. In Blake Babies, Dando wrote on tracks and provided supporting music and vocals on the &quot;Slow Learner&quot; album, released in 1989. He also collaborated on Hatfield&#x27;s album &quot;Hey Babe&quot;, released in 1994. In 1999, he recorded a duet with Hatfield for the 1999 album, &quot;Return of the Grievous Angel: A Tribute to Gram Parsons&quot;. The two sang Gram Parsons&#x27; &quot;$1000 Wedding&quot;. Their long-time relationship inspired a line in the Barenaked Ladies&#x27; song &quot;Jane&quot;: &quot;No promises as vague as heaven. No Juliana next to my Evan&quot;. In late 2000, Dando sang with the Blake Babies and played some acoustic shows with them. In 2011, Dando and Hatfield paired up again for a series of live performances.

In 1995, he had a small role in James Mangold&#x27;s indie film &quot;Heavy&quot;, and contributed two cover songs to the soundtrack.

During an acoustic world tour in early 2001, Dando garnered renewed interest in his back catalog. With touring musicians Ben Lee and Ben Kweller, he performed a mix of Lemonheads songs and solo songs. His performance at the Brattle Theatre in Cambridge on October 18, 2000, was recorded and officially released in the fall of 2001 as &quot;Live at the Brattle Theatre&quot;; the album was packaged with an additional disc, an EP titled &quot;Griffith Sunset&quot; that featured covers of country songs.

In February 2003 Dando released his first solo album, &quot;Baby I&#x27;m Bored&quot;, which reached the top 40 of the UK Albums chart.

In 2004, Dando performed as the lead vocalist for the band MC5 on a 41-show tour. He has collaborated with The Dandy Warhols and soundtrack composer Craig Armstrong. At the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&#x27; Don&#x27;t Look Back festival, Dando played several live dates, including a full performance of the &quot;It&#x27;s A Shame About Ray&quot; album.

In 2015, Dando played solo shows in the United States and Europe.

== Personal life ==
While taking a break from making music with/as the Lemonheads, Dando met English model and musician Elizabeth Moses in 1998; they married two years later. Moses contributed photography to Dando&#x27;s albums &quot;Live at the Brattle Theatre&quot; and &quot;Baby I&#x27;m Bored&quot; as well as the Lemonheads&#x27; 2006 eponymous album and its 2009 follow-up, &quot;Varshons&quot;, on which her backing vocals can be heard on the song &quot;Fragile.&quot; Moses and Dando separated in 2010. On February 13, 2019, Dando appeared on an episode of &quot;The Goldbergs&quot; called &quot;My Valentine Boy&quot;. In the episode he played guitar with The Dropouts, a band starring Adam Goldberg&#x27;s fictional older sister.

Dando moved to Brazil in 2023 with his girlfriend, Brazilian videomaker Antonia Teixeira, daughter of the Brazilian folk legend Renato Teixeira. They got married on December 30, 2024.

<text>Hallsberg () is a bimunicipal locality and the seat of Hallsberg Municipality, Örebro County, Sweden with 7,122 inhabitants in 2010. It is also partly located in Kumla Municipality.

==Overview==
This settlement grew up around a railway junction, and is these days primarily known as a place where you have to change trains. The railway station is oversized for the town&#x27;s own needs. Hallsberg was declared a &quot;municipalsamhälle&quot; (a type of borough within its municipality) in 1883 and got the title of a market town (köping) in 1908. Since 1971 it is instead the seat of the enlarged Hallsberg Municipality.

Hallsberg is famous for its huge classification yard and for the large train station. The reason for this is that railways (from practically all cardinal directions) to and from Stockholm, Gothenburg, Mjölby, Örebro and Karlstad join here. Among the more important is the Västra stambanan (&quot;western main line&quot;). As the railways were built, Hallsberg grew up around it.

A sight in the Hallsberg is the Bergööska House, built in the 1880s. It was drawn by the architect Ferdinand Boberg, and contains wall-paintings by Carl Larsson, depicting the Bergöö family and other well-known people of Hallsberg.

The main industries are Volvo, Ahlsell, and enterprises related to the railway industry, like the freight operator Hector Rail. Sports equipment manufacturer Kosa is also situated here.

Hallsberg has three twin towns.

Sven Wingquist, co-founder of SKF in 1907, was born in Hallsberg on December 10, 1876.

<text>Askersund is a locality and the seat of Askersund Municipality, Örebro County, Sweden with a population census of 3,887 inhabitants in 2010.

== Geography ==

Askersund is a popular tourist destination with swimming and nature experiences. The city centre is still marked by its wooden buildings and their two churches. Sophia Magdalena was designed by Olof tempelman and Askersund country Church by Jean de la Vallée and Erik Dahlberg. The city is located on the edge of the forest of Tiveden at Lake Alsen forming North of Lake Vättern and along the lake, just outside the city is Husabergsudde with bathing and camping. From the city, it has views of Lake Vättern and Tivedsskogen. On the other side of the water is Prince Gustaf&#x27;s Castle, Stjernsund.

==History==
The town Askersund traces its origin from the 14th century. In 1643, it was significant enough to receive its charter as one of the cities in Sweden. Despite its small size, Askersund is for historical reasons normally still referred to as a &quot;city&quot;, although Statistics Sweden nowadays defines a city as a locality with more than 10,000 inhabitants.

In the 19th century, Askersund was planned to be the site of one of the two supply fortresses for Karlsborg Fortress, located on an island in Lake Vättern, now belonging to Karlsborg Municipality. In 1813, Askersunds flickskola, the second institution to give females higher education in Sweden, was founded in Askersund.

<doc id="1020252" wikidata="Q331714" url="?curid=1020252" title="A. Willis Robertson">
<text>Absalom Willis Robertson (May 27, 1887 – November 1, 1971) was an American politician from Virginia who served in public office for over 50 years. A member of the Democratic Party and lukewarm ally of the Byrd Organization led by fellow U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd, Robertson represented Virginia in the U.S. House of Representatives (1933–1946) and the U.S. Senate (1946–1966), and had earlier served in the Virginia General Assembly. A member of the conservative coalition during his congressional career, Robertson was a vocal opponent of civil rights. Robertson was also the father of televangelist and political commentator Pat Robertson.

==Early life and education==
Robertson was born in Martinsburg, West Virginia, the son of Franklin Pierce Robertson and Josephine Ragland (née Willis), just two weeks before fellow Virginia Senator Harry F. Byrd was born in the same community. He graduated from the University of Richmond in 1907.

==Early political and legal career==

Robertson established a private law practice following graduation, and soon embarked on a political career. He was elected to the Virginia State Senate as a Democrat in 1915 to represent Bedford and Rockbridge counties and Buena Vista, Virginia, in Senate district 22, replacing W. T. Paxton, who had replaced J. Randolph Tucker in 1913. Robertson served from 1916 to 1922, when he resigned and was replaced by Samuel S. Lambeth Jr. in the February 1923 special session but Robert J. Noell won the election to succeed him later that year. During World War I, Robertson enlisted and served in the United States Army, but was assigned stateside so he could continue that part-time elective office.

Robertson served as Commonwealth Attorney for Rockbridge County, Virginia (an elective office per the Virginia constitution, which prohibited such officials from also serving as legislators or judges during their terms) from 1922 to 1928.

==Federal political career==
In 1932, Robertson was elected from Virginia&#x27;s 7th congressional district to the U.S. House of Representatives, and was reelected six times. In 1946, he won a special election for the right to complete the final two years of Senator Carter Glass&#x27;s term and took office on the day after the election. He won the seat in his own right in 1948 and was reelected two more times without serious opposition.

Among his legislation is the Pittman–Robertson Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act which creates the formula for federal sharing of ammunition tax revenues with states to establish wildlife areas. The program is still in effect and remains a primary financing source for wildlife areas.

Robertson was a typical member of the Byrd Organization, though differed at times and eventually became independent from the machine. He was chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs from 1959 to 1966. In 1956, Robertson was one of the 19 senators who signed the Southern Manifesto against the U.S. Supreme Court decision of &quot;Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka&quot; (1954), which mandated schools&#x27; desegregation.

When President Lyndon B. Johnson sent his wife, Lady Bird Johnson, on a train trip through the South to encourage support for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Robertson was one of four Southern Senators who refused to meet with her on the whistle-stop trip.

In retaliation, President Johnson personally recruited Virginia State Senator William B. Spong Jr., a considerably more liberal Democrat, to run against Robertson in the 1966 Democratic primary. Even some Byrd Democrats had moved away from resistance to integration as espoused by Robertson and the Organization&#x27;s patriarch, Harry F. Byrd. Meanwhile, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 had added black and lower-income voters. Spong defeated Robertson in the primary in one of the biggest upsets in Virginia political history. The Byrd Organization&#x27;s long dominance of Virginia state politics had begun to end.

===Opposition to civil rights===
====March 10, 1956, &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot;====
Asked to comment &quot;on his region&#x27;s state of mind and any specific American attitudes he feels are necessary to avoid violence and bring healing in a deteriorating situation following the Supreme Court school desegregation order,&quot; Robertson stated:

Virginia recognizes the correctness of the 1850 decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Court and in the 155 subsequent decisions of State and Federal courts holding that the equal rights provision of a constitution could be properly satisfied by public schools for the white and colored races which are separate but equal.

During the last 10 years notable progress has been made in the Southern States in meeting that equality requirement. But that progress will be nullified by a program of rapid, enforced desegregation. In fact, public education for both races in some Southern States would be destroyed.

The worst feature of the current desegregation effort, however, is the resulting bitterness and racial animosities in areas where harmony heretofore prevailed. Southerners believe that the cherished constitutional right of every citizen to select his personal associates is being violated.

====Monday, July 9, 1956, &quot;Congressional Record&quot;====
I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Congressional Record the weekly newsletter of my distinguished successor in the Seventh Congressional District of Virginia, Representative Burr P Harrison, in which he discussed the so-called civil rights bill now under consideration by the House. Representative Harrison&#x27;s analysis is lucid and accurate, and I fully endorse the position he has taken in opposition to it.

Harrison had stated:

Even a casual reading of this bill, sponsored by the President, reveals it as one of the most drastic measures ever to receive consideration by the Congress.

It would set up a Federal Commission with a staff of snoopers who could roam the length and breadth of the United States, armed with subpoenas, looking for civil-rights incidents. One of the objectives of this Commission would be to advance the idea of complete racial integration in private business.

==Death==
In 1971, Robertson died in Lexington, Virginia and was buried in Stonewall Jackson Memorial Cemetery, later renamed Oak Grove Cemetery.

His papers are held at the Swem Library at the College of William and Mary.

<text>Theodore Foster (April 29, 1752January 13, 1828) was an American lawyer and politician from Rhode Island. He was a member of the Federalist Party and later the National Republican Party. He served as one of the first two United States senators from Rhode Island and, following John Langdon, served as dean of the Senate.

==Early life==

Foster was born in Brookfield, Massachusetts in 1752. He engaged in classical studies at the college in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (now known as Brown University), graduating in 1770. He then studied law and lived with fellow student Solomon Drowne. He was admitted to the bar association in 1771 and remained in Rhode Island to practice law, beginning his law practice in Providence. He was town clerk in Providence from 1775 to 1787. He earned his master&#x27;s degree from Dartmouth College in 1786.

Foster was a protege of Brown University&#x27;s first chancellor, Chief Justice of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations and revolutionary patriot Stephen Hopkins. Foster married the sister of the future governor of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations Arthur Fenner.

==American Revolution==
Foster played a role in the Gaspee Affair of 1772, along with John Brown and others, which helped catalyze events leading to up to the American Revolutionary War. Foster distinguished himself as a staunch supporter of General George Washington and the Federalist cause.

==Later life==
Until 1790 Foster held various positions in the government of Rhode Island. He was then elected to the United States Senate, beginning his service on June 12, 1790. Rhode Island&#x27;s state legislature re-elected him in 1791 and 1797, and he served until March 3, 1803, when he retired from public life to engage in writing and historical research. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1820. Foster became a passionate collector of numerous documents relating to colonial Providence. He helped found the Rhode Island Historical Society in 1822. Foster&#x27;s heirs sold his extensive collection of historical documents to the Society in 1833. Many of these documents are unpublished.

During the latter period, Foster also served as a trustee of Brown University. Foster returned to public life to serve in the Rhode Island state legislature from 1812 to 1816. He lived in the town of Foster, Rhode Island, which was named after him. When Solomon Drowne moved back to Rhode Island he lived on a farm (Mt. Hygeia) next to Foster&#x27;s.

Foster died on January 13, 1828, and is interred in Swan Point Cemetery in Providence.

==Family life==
Foster&#x27;s father was Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Justice Jedediah Foster, who graduated from Harvard University in 1744.

Foster was the elder brother of Senator Dwight Foster of Massachusetts, and the great uncle of Massachusetts Attorney General and Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Justice Dwight Foster.

<doc id="1020256" wikidata="Q6355120" url="?curid=1020256" title="Kam Fong Chun">
<text>Kam Fong Chun (born Kam Tong Chun; May 27, 1918 – October 18, 2002) was an American police officer and actor, best known for his role as Chin Ho Kelly, a police detective on the CBS television network series &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;.

==Life==
Kam Fong Chun was born in the Kalihi neighborhood of Honolulu, Hawaii. A 1938 graduate of President William McKinley High School, he worked at Pearl Harbor shipyard in his 20s as a boiler maker and was a witness to the attack by the Japanese on December 7, 1941. After the death of his first wife and two eldest children in 1944, he applied for a job as a police officer at the Honolulu Police Department. He served there for 16 years. After his retirement from the police force, he worked as a disc jockey and sold real estate in addition to doing community theater.

Chun&#x27;s life was filled with tragedies. His father had an affair, which led to his parents&#x27; divorce and the splitting of the family. The two eldest children went with their father and the younger five, including seven-year-old Chun, lived with their mother. The affair also led to Chun&#x27;s father being forced out of the family business by his paternal grandfather, which left the family in poverty. Chun watched a brother burn to death as he was painting the family home and someone lit a match. On June 8, 1944, Chun lost his family in a freak air disaster that devastated their home in Honolulu. Two B-25 bombers collided over the Chun residence, killing wife Esther, four-year-old daughter Marilyn and two-year-old son Donald.

Chun later married Gladys Lindo in 1949. They had two sons, Dennis and Dickson, and daughters, Brenda and Valerie.

===Stage name===
Chun&#x27;s stage name came from a misunderstanding of his first name by his first teacher, who taught him to write Kam Fong Chun instead of his birth name, Kam Tong Chun. Due to confusion as he got older, he later legalized his name to the former. CBS asked him to shorten his name to Kam Fong when he was hired for &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;.

===Proposed 1997 &quot;Five-O&quot; revival===
Talk had centered around a remake or a feature film version of the show for years. In 1997, CBS and Stephen J. Cannell (&quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, &quot;Baretta&quot;, &quot;The Commish&quot;) collaborated on a pilot for a possible new &quot;Five-O&quot; series. The pilot would introduce some of the new cast and feature former regulars from the original series, including Fong. According to &quot;Five-O&quot; fan and author of a book on the show, Karen Rhodes, Fong was asked to reprise his role and appear in the pilot. Neither Fong nor any of the other regulars told Cannell that Chin Ho had been killed off at the end of the tenth season. This was only discovered after all of Fong&#x27;s scenes had been shot, and to excise him from the project would have caused delays and overruns in cost. Hoping that CBS executives would not remember the one episode out of hundreds, Cannell screened the pilot.

His son Dennis Chun had a recurring role in the 2010 reboot as HPD Sgt. Duke Lukela. Beginning with the 8th season he was promoted to a series regular.

===Death===
Kam Fong Chun died from lung cancer on October 18, 2002, at the age of 84.

<doc id="1020261" wikidata="Q1569970" url="?curid=1020261" title="Waltari">
<text>Waltari is a Finnish band from Helsinki known for combining numerous styles, from different metal subgenres such as progressive metal, alternative metal and extreme metal to non-metal styles such as hip hop, pop, industrial, techno, punk and hard rock.

Most of the band&#x27;s music is written by Kärtsy Hatakka. Finnish metal musicians who started their international career in Waltari include Kreator&#x27;s Sami Yli-Sirniö, Roope Latvala of Children of Bodom, and Janne Parviainen of Ensiferum.

== History ==

Waltari was formed in 1986 in Helsinki by Kärtsy Hatakka (vocals and bass), Jariot Lehtinen (guitars) and Sale Suomalainen (drums). Sami Yli-Sirniö joined as second guitarist in 1989, a year after the release of their first EP, &quot;Mut Hei&quot; (&quot;But hey!&quot;).

Their first album, &quot;Monk-Punk&quot;, was released in 1991. As the title suggests, this album was mostly punk. Their next album &quot;Torcha!&quot; (1992) was the album on which Waltari started blending various musical styles.

After releasing a compilation of early work under the title &quot;Pala Leipää&quot; (&quot;A Piece of Bread&quot;) (1993), the band went on to release &quot;So Fine!&quot; (1994), an album similar to &quot;Torcha!&quot;. Their next album, &quot;Big Bang&quot; (1995) mixes techno with heavy metal.

In 1995, Roope Latvala joined the band, replacing Sami Yli-Sirniö. At this time, Hatakka was working with conductor Riku Niemi on a project combining heavy metal with classical music. This project eventually became known as &quot;Yeah! Yeah! Die! Die! Death Metal Symphony in Deep C&quot;. The show was performed in 1995, and the album was released in 1996.

In 1997, the band released &quot;Space Avenue&quot;, a more progressive work containing more electronic drums, as well as a collaboration with Apocalyptica. In 1998, to celebrate their ten-year anniversary, the band released a compilation titled &quot;Decade&quot;.

In 1999, Kärtsy Hatakka and Waltari were working on yet another metal/classical collaboration, and this gave rise to the stage show &quot;Evangelicum&quot; (Evankeliumi). This production differed from &quot;Yeah! Yeah! Die! Die!&quot; in that it contained music, ballet and a light show. It also featured a new opera singer. The guest vocalist was Tarja Turunen, who was the lead vocalist of the still young band Nightwish. The choreographer was Jorma Uotinen. This show was released in 1999 on DVD. A musical album version of &quot;Evankeliumi&quot; was not released.

Waltari&#x27;s next album, &quot;Radium Round&quot; (1999), featured a strong pop influence. After &quot;Radium Round&quot;, the band passed out of the public eye, working on less mainstream releases such as the metal / &quot;yoik&quot; crossover &quot;Channel Nordica&quot; (2000) and the punk EP &quot;Back to Persepolis&quot; (2001). However, these releases were very hard to obtain, and for a while Waltari only survived through its live shows. In 2001, the band&#x27;s old guitarist Sami Yli-Sirniö returned, and Roope Latvala left the band.

<doc id="1020263" wikidata="Q1669666" url="?curid=1020263" title="Public transport in Frankfurt am Main">
<text>The public transport system in Frankfurt is part of the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund (abbreviated: RMV) transport network and consists of several carriers who all use the same fare system. Therefore, one ticket is valid for a journey which may include several modes of transit run by different operators. 
The fares are paid in advance of travel at a ticket vending machine or at the driver on board a bus. There are no turnstiles or other controlling barriers; instead, a proof-of-payment system is used. Plainclothes fare inspectors are employed and carry out random checks to ensure passengers have paid. If found to be travelling without a ticket, then they are required to pay a fine.

==S-Bahn==

The Rhine-Main S-Bahn is a suburban rail system serving the Rhein-Main Region, of which Frankfurt itself is the central city. The service caters the large number of commuters who travel to and from the suburbs each day. All but one of the lines run together through the City Tunnel under the city centre, and then go their separate ways at either end. In the suburban sections they are generally double-tracked or share mainline tracks with other regional, long distance passenger and cargo trains.

The trains can be up to long and have a maximum speed of . Electricity supply is provided by overhead wires at the standard German railroad voltage of 15 kV AC.

The normal service interval on each of the lines is 15 or 30 min, but on the shared central sections a train runs approximately every 2 minutes during rush hour and the S8/S9 runs 24/7.

== Trams ==

There are 10 tram lines, with trams usually running every 10 min. Many sections are served by two lines, combining to give a 5-minute frequency during rush-hour.

The construction of the underground network since the 1960s has resulted in the trams losing some of their importance to the city&#x27;s transport infrastructure. Despite this, two new sections have been constructed in recent years. It is now appreciated that trams are more attractive to the travelling public than buses and cheaper to build than underground railways. Therefore, neighbourhoods with medium transit usage are either currently served by tram routes or will be in future.

== Underground ==
The U-Bahn is a Stadtbahn system with nine lines, running on three main routes.

*The U1, U2, U3 and U8 run from Frankfurt South railway station to the north of the city on a common route. They then split and serve Nordweststadt (U1) the town of Bad Homburg (U2), Oberursel (U3) and Riedberg (U8).
*The U4 and U5 share a common tunnel through the city centre from Frankfurt Central railway station to Konstablerwache. U4 runs from Bockenheimer Warte via Messe Frankfurt and the city centre to Bornheim (Frankfurt am Main) and Enkheim. U5 runs from Frankfurt Central railway station to Preungesheim.
*The U6 and U7 also share a common tunnel through the city centre. U6 runs from Heerstraße in the west to Frankfurt East railway station. U7 runs from Hausen in the north-west, to Bergen-Enkheim in the east.
*The U9 is the only line not to run through the city centre. It connects Ginnheim and Nieder-Eschbach in the north of Frankfurt on tracks also used by the U1, U8 and U2. 

In the city centre sections the U-Bahn tracks are underground, but they run on reserved track at ground level in the suburbs.
The minimum service interval is 2.5 minutes, although the usual pattern is that each line runs with a 7.5- to 10-minute frequency which combines to approx 3–5 minutes on the city centre sections served by more than one line.

The trains can be as long as and have a maximum speed of . Cars are equipped with indicators and rear view mirrors and are powered from overhead wires.

== Bus ==

Buses play a minor role in Frankfurt transit since all major routes are served by rail based modes of transportation. There are, however, several cross-town bus routes, especially in the north. Buses are also used as feeder services for the underground lines.

===Franchises===
There are currently proposals for a shake-up of the way bus services are run. Instead of being operated by Frankfurt Transit Company, the routes could be split into different franchises which any European bus operator may tender to run. The organisation offering the cheapest proposal would then be given a contract to run that route for several years.

== Regional trains ==
Regional trains connect Frankfurt with towns and villages up to a distance of away. Most regional trains stop at more than one station in Frankfurt and they also can be used for journeys within the city. Categories for local trains in Germany are &quot;Regionalbahn&quot; (RB) and &quot;Regional-Express&quot; (RE).

== Ferry ==

There is only one ferry line in Frankfurt, crossing the river Main between the districts of Höchst and Schwanheim. It runs between &quot;Frankfurt-Höchst Batterie&quot; and &quot;Frankfurt-Schwanheim Höchster Weg&quot;.

==Organisational structure==
*The fare structure and distribution between the operators is organised by the &quot;Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund&quot;.
*The S-Bahn is run by Deutsche Bahn, the national German railroad operator.
*Light rail and trams are run by the city owned Frankfurt Transit Company (&quot;Verkehrsgesellschaft Frankfurt&quot;) (abbreviated: VGF).
*Buses are run by &quot;Verkehrsgesellschaft Frankfurt&quot;, &quot;In Der City Bus&quot;, &quot;MainMobil Frankfurt&quot;, &quot;Alpina&quot; and &quot;Regionalverkehr Kurhessen&quot;.
== Connections to long distance transport ==

* Long distance trains stop at Frankfurt Central station, Frankfurt South station and Frankfurt Airport long-distance station.
* Long distance busses stop at &quot;Fernbusbahnhof Frankfurt am Main&quot; (long distance bus terminal) as well as a bus station at &quot;Airport Terminal 2&quot;
* Frankfurt Airport can be reached by S-Bahn lines S8 and S9 (at Frankfurt Airport regional station) as well as bus line 58 (Frankfurt-Höchst station - Airport Terminal 2)

<doc id="1020264" wikidata="Q765488" url="?curid=1020264" title="Wing, Rutland">
<text>Wing is a village and civil parish in the East Midlands county of Rutland, England. The population was 315 at the 2001 census and 314 at that of 2011. It features a fine church and a labyrinth made of turf. Rutland Water reservoir is nearby.

==Heritage==
The village name, first found as &quot;Wenge&quot; in the 12th century, probably derives from the Old Norse &quot;vengi&quot;, meaning field.

Seventeenth-century houses in Wing were built of stone quarried at nearby Barnack and Clipsham. Many are roofed with Collyweston stone slate.

The Church of St Peter and St Paul, Wing was much rebuilt in 1875, when the spire was removed. Some parts date from Norman times, including the south arcade of about 1150, the slightly later north arcade, and the north doorway.

===Maze===
Cut into the turf beside Glaston Road is a circular &quot;turf maze&quot; roughly in diameter (actually a labyrinth) It is thought to date back to medieval times, based on the fact that its design is similar to the pavement maze in Chartres cathedral and those at other medieval sites.

==Amenities==

The remaining public house is the &quot;King&#x27;s Arms&quot;. The name of the &quot;Cuckoo Inn&quot;, closed in 2004, alluded to a legend that the people of Wing once tried to keep spring in the village forever by erecting a fence around a cuckoo to stop it from leaving. Naturally, it flew over the fence and away. As a result, people from the village were known as &quot;Wing Fools&quot;. This is actually a widespread story, the best-known version probably appearing among the adventures the Wise Men of Gotham. There is a village hall.

Wing Hall has a camping and caravan site with a shop and café.

A plant outside Wing treats water extracted from Rutland Water reservoir a few miles to the north. Proposals by Anglian Water to raise the volume of water extracted were opposed by the RSPB, fearing that water-level changes would damage adjacent wildfowl habitats.

Medical, legal and other services can be found in Oakham (6 miles, 10 km).

===Transport===
Wing has one or two daily weekday buses with Oakham. Hourly daytime buses six days a week between Melton Mowbray, Oakham and Corby pass through Manton 1.3 miles (2 km) away. The nearest railway station is at Oakham (6 miles, 10 km), but Corby (11.5 miles, 18.5 km) has hourly services seven days a week to London St Pancras, changing at Kettering (a little over an hour).

Also nearby (1.5 miles, 2.4 km) is the main A6003 road between Kettering and Oakham via Uppingham.

<text>Årjäng is a locality and the seat of Årjäng Municipality, Värmland County, Sweden with 3,228 inhabitants in 2010. It is located around from the Norway-Sweden border and on the road between Karlstad and Oslo. In 1540 Årjäng was spelled &quot;Argenge&quot;. This word has an Old Swedish genitive case of &quot;å&quot;, meaning river, which refers to the Silbodal river. The morpheme &quot;genge&quot; refers to a crossing over the river.

==History==
===Antiquity===
Ancient findings show that Årjäng Municipality has been inhabited for a very long time. Ceramics, burnt animal bones and flint objects have been found nearby, dating back to 3500-3000 B.C.

===Medieval===
In the 11th century the domains regarding what is now part of Årjäng Municipality was called Nordmarken. The belief of natural beings like giants, trolls, scrubbers and elves was rooted in the inhabitants of this time period. Around the 12th century Christianity slowly took hold among the people, and churches were soon built.

==Climate==
The border region surrounding Årjäng has a borderline oceanic/continental climate in recent decades, although in previous decades such as the 1961-1990 it was even cold enough to be classified as mild subarctic. The nearest weather station is in Blomskog, located within the woods at a similar altitude somewhat farther south.

==Tourist attractions==
Årjängstrollet located downtown was created by artist Erik Hermansson, the creation of the troll was inspired by Thore Skogman&#x27;s fairytale about trolls in Årjäng.

A &quot;sculpture walk&quot; can be experienced from Årjäng central to Kyrkerud art school; a walk for experience and recreation.

Horse trot racing is an established sport in Årjäng, it is the highlight every year to hold the race &quot;V75&quot; at &quot;Årjängstravet&quot;.

Säffle&#x27;s main growth as a town took place after the building of a canal in 1837 which allowed boats to safely bypass a section of turbulent water and rapids in the Byälven river.

<text>Kristinehamn is a locality and the seat of Kristinehamn Municipality, Värmland County, Sweden, with 24,053 inhabitants in 2022.

== Geography ==
Kristinehamn is situated by the shores of lake Vänern where the small rivers &quot;Varnan&quot; and &quot;Löt&quot; drain into the lake. It has a harbour and is a railroad and road transportation center. Nearby towns include Karlskoga and Karlstad and are located exactly in the middle of Oslo, Stockholm and Gothenburg with 250 km to each of them.

== History ==
The location has had a resident population for centuries, at least since the Stone Age. The town was then built alongside the bridge over river Varnan. Its name was &quot;Broo&quot; (or Bro) until 1642, and &quot;Bro&quot; literally means &quot;Bridge&quot; in Swedish.

Kristinehamn got a royal charter for the first time in 1582 but lost it in 1584, and regained it in 1642, and changed its name in honour of the monarch Queen Christina of Sweden. It thus qualifies as one of Sweden&#x27;s historical cities. Its city arms were designated with a &quot;bojort&quot;, which is a Dutch ship in use in the 17th century.

== Sites of interest ==
*By the shores of lake Vänern stands this 15 meter high Pablo Picasso statue at since 1965. The statue was designed by Picasso, but built and inaugurated without him visiting the construction site. Picasso never visited Kristinehamn. Its 15 meters make it the second tallest Picasso Sculpture in the world, after the Chicago sculpture that is 15.2 meters tall.
*The oldest runestone in the county of Värmland, the Järsberg Runestone with origin back to 500 AC, is located about 1 km outside the town of Järsberg. The latest interpretation of the runes was made by Sven B. F. Jansson (1906-1987). Quotation: &quot;My name is &quot;Ljuv&quot;. My name is &quot;Ravn&quot;. Me &quot;Eril&quot; am making the runes&quot;. A pearl from the same period of time has been found in the area.
* Kristinehamn Church (&quot;Kristinehamns kyrka&quot;) was designed by professor Carl Georg Brunius (1793–1869) and was first opened in 1858. The church also has a museum in the sanctuary gallery that is worth a visit because of its unique architecture.

==Sports==
The following sports clubs are located in Kristinehamn:

* IFK Ölme

==Notable people==
* Bror Beckman (1866–1929), composer and principal of the Royal College of Music, Stockholm. &amp; Treasurer of the Swedish Academy of Music

<text>Hagfors is a locality and the seat of Hagfors Municipality, Värmland County, Sweden with 10,125 inhabitants in 2010.

Its history is traced to 1873, when it was decided to build two blast furnaces at the location.

The town of Hagfors used to play host to the Swedish Rally, a car rally, every February, which provided a significant annual economic windfall for the region.

Hagfors was one of the last places in Sweden to receive the formal title of a city, when it was detached from &quot;Norra Råda&quot; in 1950. The designated coat of arms was a tribute to the furnaces. At that time the town had 6,501 inhabitants. Today it is the seat of the much larger Hagfors Municipality, but is not an administrative entity of its own.

==Climate==
The Hagfors area has a subarctic climate due to the area&#x27;s cool nights. The official weather station is located in Gustavsfors, a rural locality to the north at a similar altitude. The climate type is very unusual for subarctic climate since summer days are warm in combination with winter average highs being just below freezing with lows only being around . Cold extremes are frequent for such a southerly area, with an all-time low of being unique for a Swedish area just north of 60 degrees latitude. It being a subarctic climate is a result of the low September night temperatures. Given that Gustavsfors is located somewhat north and Hagfors being a little bit more urban, it is quite possible that the locality just reaches the continental threshold that would require September mean temperatures. In terms of the official reference period of 1961-1990 however, the area is firmly subarctic.

==Transportation==
Hagfors airport is located at the town&#x27;s border. There are flights with Amapola Flyg to Stockholm Arlanda and Torsby airports.

==Sport and recreation==
Valsarna are a motorcycle speedway club from Tallhult, who compete in the Swedish Speedway Team Championship. Their home track is at the Tallhult Motorstadion which is located to the North of Hagfors on the road to Geijersholm. They are twice league champions of Sweden.

== Notable people ==

*Sebastian Eriksson (born 1993), rallycross driver
*Stefan Erkgärds (born 1985), professional ice hockey player

*Monica Zetterlund (1937 - 2005), renowned jazz vocalist

<text>Filipstad is a locality and the seat of Filipstad Municipality, Värmland County, Sweden, with 10,644 inhabitants in 2019.

Filipstad was granted city privileges in 1611 by Charles IX of Sweden, who named it after his son Duke Carl Philip (1601–1622; younger brother of Gustavus Adolphus).

After a major fire destroyed forest and town in 1694, Filipstad lost its privileges, as it was believed the remaining forest would not be sustainable if the town were to be rebuilt. In 1835 the rights were regranted. The local government acts of 1862 made the very privileges obsolete, but the title &quot;stad&quot; (&quot;city&quot;) remained in use until the municipal reform of 1971. Since then Filipstad is the seat of the larger Filipstad Municipality. Filipstad is, despite its small population, for historical reasons, normally still referred to as a &quot;city&quot;. Statistics Sweden, however, only counts localities with more than 10,000 inhabitants as cities.

At Filipstad, there is Klockarhöjdenmasten, a 330 metres tall guyed mast used for FM/TV-broadcasting.

Wasabröd, the largest crisp bread manufacturer in the world, has one of its two factories in Filipstad, the other being in Celle, Germany.

<text>Arvika is a locality and the seat of Arvika Municipality, Värmland County, Sweden with 14,244 inhabitants in 2010.

==Geography==
The town of Arvika is situated at Kyrkviken, a bay of Glafsfjorden, Sweden&#x27;s only inland fjord, a remnant of the time following the last ice age (once a fjord of the Ancylus Lake). The town is located approximately 380 km west of Stockholm, 250 km north of Gothenburg, 150 km east of Oslo, and 50 km from the Norwegian border.

The area is hilly with the tallest hill &quot;Storkasberget&quot; close to the town centre.

Arvika and its surroundings have excellent water infrastructure. In fact, Arvika has the innermost harbour in the whole of Sweden. Through a system of canals, lake Vänern can be reached, and from there the Göta Canal allows further passage to Gothenburg and Sweden&#x27;s west coast.

==History==

Ten kilometers west of the city, in &quot;Bergs Klätt&quot;, there are remnants of a younger Stone Age and Nordic Bronze Age settlements in the form of graves.

The town was a village until 1811 when it was given town privileges by royal charter under the name &quot;Oscarsstad&quot; in order to improve the economy of the area. This attempt was unsuccessful, and the town privileges were repealed in 1821 and the town was instead given the status of köping (township) and renamed Arvika. The town privileges were reinstated at the founding centennial in 1911, and the name Arvika remained. The city status is now obsolete, but Arvika is since 1971 the seat of the larger Arvika municipality.

The church Mikaelikyrkan is from 1647, and the church in the centre, Trefaldighetskyrkan, is from the same year as the town, 1911.

Arvika has several heavy industrial production facilities which employ the majority of the population, among these Thermia, Volvo Construction Equipment (Wheel loaders), Arvika Gjuteri (nodular and grey iron foundry) and Coffee Queen, a coffee machine factory.

==Culture==
Arvika is known for the turn of the century (around 1900) artist commune &quot;Rackstad&quot; just outside the city. Here, several famous Swedish artists lived and worked, the most well-known probably being Christian Eriksson and Gustaf Fjæstad and his wife Maja Fjæstad. Other talents that lived in Rackstad include Björn Ahlgrensson and Fritz Lindström. Arvika is also home of NHL player Jacob De La Rose, drafted by the Montreal Canadiens in 2012.

The Arvika Festival (since 1992) was the biggest annual event in the area, with several international bands visiting the town during three days in July every summer. In recent years such bands as Einstürzende Neubauten, Hot Chip, Robyn, The Knife, Ministry, New Order, Kraftwerk and Franz Ferdinand have performed here. The 2009 festival was headlined by Depeche Mode, Nine Inch Nails, Röyksopp and Korn and was the biggest edition of the festival ever.

One of the six university colleges of music in Sweden, Ingesund College of Music, a department of Karlstad University, is situated in Arvika.

==International relations==
===Twin towns — Sister cities===
Arvika has three twin cities:
==Climate==
Arvika has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) that borders being subarctic (&quot;Dfc&quot;) using the official reference period 1961-1990. It has partial maritime influence, but retains its classification due to cool nights throughout the year courtesy of its inland position with less maritime influence than the Värmland capital of Karlstad on Lake Vänern. The highest recorded temperature since the weather station&#x27;s inception in 1945 is on August 7, 1975, and the lowest is from February 9, 1966.

<text>Sybil (or Sibbell)Ludington (April 5, 1761 – February 26, 1839) was an American woman who made an alleged ride during the American Revolutionary War, though modern accounts dispute this. On April 26, 1777, at age 16, Ludington, the daughter of a Colonel Henry Ludington, was claimed to have made an all-night horseback ride to rally American militiamen in neighboring towns after British forces raided and burnt Danbury, Connecticut.

Accounts of Ludington&#x27;s ride are based on a brief mention in 1907 memoirs about her father, published privately by his grandchildren. A 2015 report in &quot;The New England Quarterly&quot; says there is little evidence backing the story, and whether the ride occurred has been questioned since at least 1956.

Relatively unknown through the 1870s, Ludington&#x27;s story gained recognition around the time of World War II, after New York State was convinced to place historic roadmarkers in locations she was speculated to have visited on her ride. The myth grew thereafter, from memorial statues honoring her, to books being written about her, culminating with being honored on a United States Bicentennial postage stamp that was released on March 25, 1975, which depicts her on a horse.

==Early life, family and death==

Ludington was born on April 5, 1761, in Fredericksburg, New York. She was the first of 12 children of Abigail and Henry Ludington, a gristmill owner. According to his relatives, Sybil&#x27;s father had fought in the French and Indian War, and volunteered to head the local militia during the Revolutionary War.

At the age of 23, in 1784 Ludington married Edmond Ogden. They had a son named Henry in 1786. In 1792, the family settled in Catskill, and Ogden died in 1799. In 1811 Ludington moved to Unadilla, New York.

Ludington lived in Unadilla until her death on February 26, 1839, at the age of 77. She was buried near her father in the Patterson Presbyterian Cemetery in Patterson, New York. Her tombstone shows a different spelling of her first name.

==Ludington&#x27;s ride==

Accounts that did not emerge until the 20th century, about her alleged 18th century ride, recognize Ludington as a heroine of the American Revolutionary War.

=== Historical accounts ===

Accounts originating in the 20th century, from the Ludington family, say Sybil played an important role after the British raid on Danbury, Connecticut.

According to the story printed 140 years after the alleged feat, on April 26, 1777, then 16-year-old Sybil Ludington rode from her hometown in Fredericksburg, New York (near Danbury, Connecticut) through Putnam County, New York, to rally approximately 400 militiamen under the command of her father, Colonel Henry Ludington, after British forces raided Danbury, where the Continental Army had a supply depot. American troops from New York and Connecticut rallied to engage the British the next day in the Battle of Ridgefield, forcing them to retreat.

A brief mention of Ludington&#x27;s ride was published by his grandchildren in 1907 as part of Ludington&#x27;s father&#x27;s memoirs. Modern accounts say Ludington was congratulated for her heroism by General George Washington; more recent scholarship has raised doubt that the ride even took place.

=== Research history ===

A 2022 &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine article written by Abigail Tucker states that the earliest known record of the 1777 account of Ludington&#x27;s ride came in 1854 from Sybil&#x27;s nephew, Charles H. Ludington, who sought to have his aunt recognized as a hero. Ludington was included in an 1880 book about the New York City area by local historian Martha Lamb. A brief later reference appeared in the 1907 memoirs written by Willis Fletcher Johnson about Sybil&#x27;s father and published privately by his grandchildren.

Tucker states that letters written by Ludington herself do not mention the ride. Accounts vary as to whether she rode bareback or sidesaddle, what the name of the horse was, and how her name was spelled (Sybil, Cybal, Sibyl, Sebil, Sybille, or Sibbell).

In 1838, Ludington asked for a pension based on her husband, Ogden, having fought in the Revolutionary War, but she could not prove that she was married to him. According to Paula Hunt, writing in &quot;The New England Quarterly&quot; journal, &quot;None of the sworn affidavits attesting to Henry Ogden’s military service and the legitimacy of Sybil&#x27;s marriage mentioned her ride, nor did she attempt to claim it as justification for a pension.&quot;

Lamb stated that her account relied on sources including letters, sermons, genealogical compilations, wills, and court records to document details. She cites no sources, nor provides documentation of the ride. Hunt suggests the account may have been told to Lamb by Ludington&#x27;s descendants.

Owing partly to a lack of contemporary accounts, Hunt raises questions about the events. She writes that neither of the original publications about the ride &quot;had offered any information about Sybil&#x27;s course&quot;, and the purported route was devised speculatively by the project managers who later installed historic markers, a &quot;relatively inexpensive but increasingly popular means for states and localities to promote tourism&quot;. The installation of the historic roadside markers beginning in 1934 – although based on speculative locations according to Hunt – led to publications that propelled Sybil to the status of a heroine by 1937, and the publication of a 1940 poem about her brought the story to a national audience. Doubts about the story had been raised as early as 1956; contrasting it to the Betsy Ross story, Hunt cites Henry Noble McCracken&#x27;s, &quot;Old Dutchess Forever! The Story of an American County&quot; and two New York news articles from 1995, writing that:In Sybil&#x27;s case, the state-sanctified historical roadside markers, statue, and postage stamp celebrating her ride, and the many books and newspaper and magazine articles that retold her story, had created an aura of authority that effectively dispelled any intermittent bouts of skepticism.

Hunt has provided a history of how the Ludington story has been portrayed in the media and literature, and in efforts to promote tourism. Pollak wrote in 1975 in the &quot;New York Times&quot; that &quot;Many children&#x27;s books treat the account as historical fact&quot;, although the Putnam County Historian indicated there was &quot;no solid evidence that Sybil actually made the ride&quot;. Hunt states that many popular details were fiction, such as the horse named Star, the stick she held, and the distance of 40 miles. Hunt states that the two accounts of Ludington&#x27;s ride were not mentioned in any other significant history produced in the same era, and that even as stories of heroic women of the colonial era proliferated by the 1870s, the only published accounts of Ludington were Lamb&#x27;s and Johnson&#x27;s. She writes:
Sybil&#x27;s ride embraces the mythical meanings and values expressed in the country&#x27;s founding. As an individual, she represents Americans&#x27; persistent need to find and create heroes who embody prevalent attitudes and beliefs.

Contemporaneous sources suggest that the Americans, including the residents of Danbury, were already aware of the approaching British forces, as noted in &quot;The New-York Gazette&quot; and the &quot;Weekly Mercury&quot;, May 19, 1777, which stated: On Saturday, the 26th of April, express came to Danbury from Brigadier General Silliman, advising that a large body of enemy had landed the day before at sun set, at Compo, a point of land between Fairfield and Norwalk, and were marching toward Danbury. Measures were immediately taken.

In 1996, the national Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) said that the evidence was not strong enough to support their criteria for a war heroine, and added a note to an exhibition saying of the ride, &quot;It&#x27;s a great story, but there is no way to know whether or not it is true.&quot; The DAR chapter near her historic home says that her exploit was documented, and it continues to honor her.

Hunt concludes, &quot;The story of the lone, teenage girl riding for freedom, it seems, is simply too good not to be believed.&quot;

==Legacy and honors==

In 1934, New York State began to install a number of historic markers along Ludington&#x27;s purported route.

A commemorative sculpture by Anna Hyatt Huntington was erected at Lake Gleneida near Carmel, New York, in 1961. Smaller versions of the statue are at the Daughters of the American Revolution headquarters in Washington, D.C., the public library in Danbury, Connecticut, and at Brookgreen Gardens, Murrells Inlet, South Carolina.

In 1975, Ludington was honored with a postage stamp in the &quot;Contributors to the Cause&quot; United States Bicentennial series. The National Rifle Association of America instituted the Sybil Ludington Women&#x27;s Freedom Award in 1995.

Composer Ludmila Ulehla wrote the 1993 chamber opera &quot;Sybil of the American Revolution&quot; based on the story of Ludington&#x27;s ride. In 2014, Ludington was featured on the American Heroes Channel documentary &quot;American Revolution: Patriots Rising&quot;. The movie &quot;Sybil Ludington: The Female Paul Revere&quot; was produced in 2010.

<text>Mezzoforte is an instrumental jazz-funk fusion band from Iceland, formed in 1977.

They signed a record deal with Icelandic label Steinar. Their biggest hit single was &quot;Garden Party&quot; (1983), taken from their fourth album (second international release) &quot;Surprise Surprise&quot;. It peaked at number 17 in the UK Singles Chart. The solo that takes place two minutes into &quot;Garden Party&quot;, was created and played on the flugelhorn by English trumpeter, Stephen Dawson. &quot;Garden Party&quot; was later covered by Herb Alpert, at a slower speed than the original, apparently as he had learned the track from the single played at the wrong speed. Another single, &quot;Rockall&quot; spent one week at number 75 in the same listing in June that year, and was used as a signature tune by several European radio chart shows.

The band was named after the traditional musical term &quot;mezzo forte&quot;, an instruction to play literally &quot;moderately loud&quot;.

<doc id="1020318" wikidata="Q335556" url="?curid=1020318" title="John Browne, Baron Browne of Madingley">
<text>Edmund John Phillip Browne, Baron Browne of Madingley (born 20 February 1948), is a British businessman.

He is best known for his role as the chief executive of the energy company BP between 1995 and 2007. This period has been described as the company&#x27;s &quot;golden period of expansion and diversification&quot;. Browne was lauded during this period as he engineered mergers with rival Amoco and ARCO, and gained access to Russian oil reserves with the creation of TNK-BP. Nicknamed the &quot;Sun King&quot; for his management style, he was also praised for transforming the oil and gas industry&#x27;s approach to climate change, and for creating a renewable and alternative energy business within BP. He resigned from BP in May 2007 in controversial circumstances surrounding his personal life and sexuality.

He is a former president of the Royal Academy of Engineering (2006 to July 2011), and has served on the boards of Goldman Sachs, Intel and Daimler Benz. Since 2001, he has been a crossbench member of the House of Lords. Lord Browne of Madingley is a former partner at Riverstone Holdings, where he was co-head of the world&#x27;s largest renewable energy private equity fund. He received his undergraduate education at the University of Cambridge and later attended Stanford University.

==Early life and education==
Browne was born on 20 February 1948 in Hamburg, Germany. His father was a British Army officer who later worked for Anglo-Persian Oil (renamed the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC) in 1935), which later became British Petroleum. His mother, Paula, was a Hungarian Jewish Auschwitz survivor. Many members of Browne&#x27;s Jewish maternal family, including his grandparents, were murdered at the Birkenau concentration camp during The Holocaust.

Browne was educated at The King&#x27;s School (now called King&#x27;s Ely) and St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he earned a First Class BA degree in physics. In addition to his degree in physics from the University of Cambridge, he holds an MS degree in business from Stanford University, California.

==Career at BP==
At the suggestion of his father, Browne joined BP as an apprentice in 1966 while still at university. He remained with the corporation throughout his career.

Between 1969 and 1983, he held a variety of exploration and production posts in Anchorage, Alaska, New York, San Francisco, London and Canada. In 1984 he became group treasurer and chief executive of BP Finance International. In April 1986, he took up the position of executive vice president and chief financial officer of Standard Oil of Ohio in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1987, following the BP/Standard merger, in addition to his position as executive vice president and chief financial officer of BP America, he was appointed chief executive officer of Standard Oil Production Company. In 1989, he became managing director and chief executive officer of BP Exploration based in London. In September 1991, he joined BP&#x27;s board as a managing director.

He was appointed group chief executive on 10 June 1995 after the British government sold its last remaining stake in the company. Following the merger of BP and Amoco, he became group chief executive of the combined group on 31 December 1998 and served until 1 May 2007. He was one of the most highly paid executives in the UK, with a remuneration package of approximately £5.7 million in 2004.

From 1997, Browne sought to re-brand BP. The company linked itself in its corporate communications with green issues by the overt link of its BP initials with the phrase &quot;Beyond Petroleum&quot;. Browne stated that the right to self-determination was crucial for people everywhere, and that he saw his company&#x27;s mission as to find ways to meet current needs without excessive harm to the environment, while developing future, more sustainable sources of energy. He promised that BP would reduce its own CO2 emissions by 10% by 2010, a target which was achieved nine years ahead of schedule.

An investigation of the fatal explosion at BP&#x27;s Texas City, Texas, plant on 23 March 2005 that killed 15 workers and injured more than 170 others, resulted in fines and awards being given out for breaches in its health and safety regime.

===Resignation===
It was announced on 25 July 2006 that Browne would stand down as chief executive of BP in December 2008. There had been press speculation that he had wished to continue beyond this date, but he made it clear that he did not wish to do so. On 6 January 2007, Browne won his first interim injunction against the publication of allegations by his former partner, Jeff Chevalier. Browne later disclosed being &quot;terrified&quot; that his sexuality would be revealed publicly. A week later it was announced that his retirement date had been brought forward to July 2007 and that Tony Hayward would succeed him. In April 2007, after a court case lasting over four weeks, Browne appealed to the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords, who ruled that he could not prevent Associated Newspapers from printing allegations about his romantic life and alleged misuse of company funds. Lord Browne resigned from BP on 1 May 2007, and resigned as a non-executive director of Goldman Sachs on 10 May 2007.

At the time he faced allegations that he had supported his partner, Canadian Jeff Chevalier, throughout their four-year relationship, and when Chevalier moved back to Toronto at the end of the relationship, that Browne paid for 12 months of a lease on an apartment. Browne says he felt under pressure to resign due to UK newspaper &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot;″s revelations about his personal life and relationship with Chevalier. As part of a statement made at the time of his resignation, he commented: &quot;In my 41 years with BP, I have kept my private life separate from my business life. I have always regarded my sexuality as a personal matter, to be kept private. It is a matter of deep disappointment that a newspaper group has now decided that allegations about my personal life should be made public.&quot;

A court accepted that Browne had lied over how he met Chevalier. In a deposition to the court, Browne said the pair had met in a London park; Browne&#x27;s associates later acknowledged that he had actually met Chevalier via a website called &quot;Suited and Booted&quot;. However, Mr Justice Eady, the presiding judge in the case, said he decided not to refer the matter to the Attorney General, seeing disclosure in the judgement of Lord Browne&#x27;s behaviour as &quot;probably sufficient punishment&quot;, and adding Browne&#x27;s &quot;willingness to tell a deliberate lie to the court, persisted in for about two weeks, ... is relevant in assessing his own credibility and the overall merits. So too is his willingness casually to &#x27;trash&#x27; the reputation of Mr Chevalier and to discredit him in the eyes of the court&quot;.

BP chairman, Peter Sutherland, characterised claims that company assets and resources had been abused as &quot;unfounded or insubstantive&quot;.

== Chairman of Cuadrilla ==
Browne worked as Chairman of Cuadrilla Resources in the early 2010s. He was also a managing partner at Riverstone Holdings, the venture capital firm behind Cuadrilla.

Browne left Cuadrilla in 2015 to become executive chairman of L1 Energy, &quot;an oil and gas firm backed by Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman.

In 2019, Browne said that &quot;fracking in the UK doesn’t make much sense. I think it was a test to see if it worked. We probably don’t need to do it.&quot;

==Elevation to a peerage and current activities==

He was president of the Royal Academy of Engineering from 2006 to 2011. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2006. In 1998, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II and in 2001 named by the House of Lords Appointments Commission as one of the &quot;people&#x27;s peers&quot; taking the title Baron Browne of Madingley, of Cambridge in the County of Cambridgeshire, and becoming a crossbencher in the House of Lords. In 2000, he was the recipient of the FIRST Responsible Capitalism Award. He was appointed a trustee of the Tate Gallery on 1 August 2007 and chair of the trustees in January 2009. In November 2009, it was announced that he would chair an independent review into university tuition fees which reported in October 2010. In June 2010, he was appointed as the Government&#x27;s lead non-executive director, charged with recruiting business leaders to reformed departmental boards.

In October 2010, it was announced that he had been appointed chairman of the advisory board at Stanhope Capital as the asset manager gears up for international expansion. The former chief executive of BP will help advise on attracting investment from charities and endowment trusts, which at present make up a small number of the Stanhope&#x27;s total clients.

He is chairman of the international advisory board of the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford, and chairman of the trustees of the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering. He is chairman of the Francis Crick Institute, chairman of the Donmar Warehouse Theatre, and since September 2017 has served as chairman of the Courtauld Institute of Art, following the end of his tenure at Tate. He is also a trustee of the Holocaust Educational Trust.

Browne sits on the board of directors of IHS Markit and SparkCognition, and is a member of the advisory boards of Edelman, Schillings, and the big data technology companies Afiniti, Kayrros and Windward. Between 2015 and 2020, he served as non-executive chairman of Huawei UK.

He is the founder and chairman of the John Browne Charitable Trust, which &quot;supports projects that will make a tangible difference to the lives of people with great potential, particularly those from under-represented backgrounds.&quot; Over the past 20 years, the trust has distributed more than £2 million.

Browne joined General Atlantic as a senior advisor in 2021 and is co-founder and Chairman of BeyondNetZero, a climate growth equity venture with General Atlantic, targeting investments in companies providing solutions to climate change.

From 2015 to 2021, Browne was appointed executive chairman of L1 Energy, an energy investment vehicle co-owned by Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman. In December 2017, it was reported that Browne had led negotiations to create a new joint venture between L1 Energy and BASF, merging their respective oil and gas businesses to create Wintershall Dea, where Browne now chairs the supervisory board.

Browne was the UK Government lead non-executive director until January 2015. His remit was to work with Secretaries of State to appoint non-executives to the board of each government department. In April 2021, Browne was appointed co-Chairman of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Council on Science and Technology.

==Publications==

Lord Browne of Madingley published his memoirs &quot;Beyond Business&quot; in February 2010. &quot;Seven Elements that Changed the World&quot;, an examination of the role of seven scientific elements in history, was published in April 2013. On 17 June 2014 he published &quot;The Glass Closet: Why Coming Out Is Good Business&quot;, a book discussing the risks and rewards of coming out in business and advocating for a top-down corporate policy of LGBT inclusiveness. Lord Browne of Madingley is said to be the first openly gay CEO of any Fortune 500 company.

# &quot;Beyond Business&quot; (February 2010)
# &quot;Seven Elements that Have Changed the World&quot; (April 2013)
# &quot;The Glass Closet: Why Coming Out Is Good Business&quot; (May 2014)
# &quot;Connect: How companies succeed by engaging radically with society&quot; (September 2015)
# &quot;Make, Think, Imagine: Engineering the Future of Civilisation&quot; (May 2019)

In 2015, he was co-author of the report that launched the Global Apollo Programme, which calls for developed nations to commit to spending 0.02% of their GDP for 10 years, to fund co-ordinated research to make carbon-free baseload electricity less costly than electricity from coal by the year 2025.

==The Browne Review==

On 12 October 2010, the report of the inquiry headed by Lord Browne of Madingley was published under the title &quot;Securing a Sustainable Future for Higher Education&quot;. The main recommendation of the report was that the current cap of £3,290 on university tuition fees should be lifted thereby allowing such institutions to determine their own fee structure.

==Cuts and safety record controversy==
Browne is described by journalist and author Tom Bower as responsible for a &quot;ruthless&quot; programme of cost-cutting at BP that compromised safety, and thus the man most responsible for a string of major accidents including the Texas City refinery explosion (2005) and the Deepwater Horizon explosion (2010). Browne has rejected Bower&#x27;s &quot;unsubstantiated&quot; and &quot;wholly inaccurate&quot; account.

According to &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper, &quot;Browne&#x27;s reputation was tarnished by a string of accidents in the US which hastened his retirement&quot;, and Browne declined to appear in an hour-long BBC2 documentary on the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in which Tony Hayward was extensively interviewed, broadcast in November 2010.

<doc id="1020325" wikidata="Q471060" url="?curid=1020325" title="William Grayson">
<text>William Grayson (1742 – March 12, 1790) was a planter, lawyer and statesman from Virginia. After leading a Virginia regiment in the Continental Army, Grayson served in the Virginia House of Delegates before becoming one of the first two U.S. Senators from Virginia, as well as a leader of the Anti-Federalist faction. Grayson became the first member of the United States Congress to die while holding office.

==Early and family life==
Grayson was born in 1742 to Benjamin and Susannah (Monroe) Grayson at Belle Aire Plantation. in what is now Woodbridge, Virginia. His father had emigrated from Scotland to the confluence of the Potomac River and Quantico Creek which became Dumfries, Virginia. Benjamin Grayson Sr. became a successful merchant and planter, as well as militia officer and (by 1731) one of the justices of the peace (who jointly governed the vast county of that day, in addition to their judicial duties). Their mother, twice-widowed, had been born to an important family upriver in Westmoreland County and had children by her previous marriages to Charles Tyler and William Linton (also a Scottish-born merchant). One of her nephews, James Monroe, would later serve in the Continental Army, succeed this man as U.S. Senator from Virginia and became President of the United States. Susanna Grayson bore three sons (Spence, Benjamin Jr. and William) and a daughter (also Susanna) in this marriage before she died in 1752, when this boy was ten. His father remarried, to another widow, Sarah Ball Ewell, who also had children by prior marriage, but none in this marriage before her husband died in 1757.

William was sixteen when his father died, so his eldest brother (Benjamin Grayson Jr.) became his legal guardian until he reached 21 years. Benjamin Grayson Jr. and Spence Grayson, being the elder brothers, inherited their father&#x27;s business and plantations approximating 2,800 acres in Prince William County, by a will drafted in 1753 which was admitted to probate in 1758 but no longer exists. However, William was well-provided for from the personal estate (which required a 10,000 bond), especially compared to his future commander, George Washington (whose far smaller inheritance caused him to earn a living by surveying beginning as a teenager). One of the Grayson plantations included a house on a hill above Dumfries that became known as &quot;Grayson&#x27;s Hill&quot; and later &quot;Battery Hill&quot; (for a Confederate battery during the American Civil War). The other, Belle Aire (often confused with a plantation about five miles inland with the same pronunciation but the name Bel Air which was owned and operated by the Ewell family) was between the Occoquan River and Neabsco Creek near the ferry (later bridge) conducting the King&#x27;s Highway across the Occoquan River and which became Woodbridge, Virginia. It had been the property of William Linton a previous husband of this man&#x27;s mother, Susan, who married Benjamin Grayson by 1732.&lt;br&gt;
William Grayson received his first schooling locally under Charles Tyler, and later became known for familiarity with Latin and Greek as well as English history. His guardian allowed his education in Philadelphia at the University of Pennsylvania, and (after graduating) William Grayson sailed to England. Although some family sources claim he studied law for two and a half years, and received his degree from the University of Oxford, neither university nor Inns of Court documentation exists to support that tradition, so he was likely apprenticed to British merchant bankers like William Lee. When his brother and guardian Benjamin faced financial troubles in 1762 (so that he mortgaged his entire estate to his brother Spence), William returned home and as his need for a guardian ended, found that his spending abroad had also diminished the capital he had inherited.
Grayson married Eleanor Smallwood, a sister of Maryland Governor William Smallwood, who survived him. They had four sons (Frederick, George, Robert and Alfred) and a daughter (Hebe).

==Return to the Virginia colony==
About three years after returning to Virginia (probably at the conclusion of a clerkship with a local lawyer), Grayson began practicing law in Prince William County and three nearby counties. The county seat was at Dumfries, Virginia, a port town (now the oldest in the state) not far from Grayson&#x27;s home as well as Belle Aire Plantation, which his brother Spence Monroe Grayson (1737–1798) inherited in 1757. On the other side of the Occoquan River lay Fairfax County, Virginia, which had split from Prince William County when Grayson was a boy. The wealthiest planter families (who could hire lawyers to protect their interests) owned land in both counties, and often held positions on church vestries, responsible for social welfare activities, including caring for orphans and the poor. Thus Grayson was familiar with local leaders, especially George Mason and George Washington, who served on the vestry of Pohick Church. Furthermore, after his brother Spence Grayson was ordained an Anglican priest in England in 1771, he served as rector of Cameron and Dettingen parishes in Prince William County, so both brothers socialized with Rev. Scott of Pohick Church both vestries.

==American revolutionary==

Grayson became involved in the political prelude to the Revolution in Virginia. He was on various Committees of Correspondence and military preparedness, as did nearby planters, including Richard Henry Lee with whom he would serve as the inaugural U.S. Senators from Virginia.
In June 1776 he became an assistant secretary to George Washington, and was promoted as an aide-de-camp to Washington in August, which came with the rank of lieutenant colonel. In January 1777, William Grayson recruited a regiment for the Continental Army known as Grayson&#x27;s Additional Continental Regiment, and served as its colonel (and Spence as its fighting chaplain). The Regiment was attached to General Charles Scott&#x27;s Brigade and saw frequent action in late 1777 in the Philadelphia Campaign, notably in the delaying skirmishes in Northern New Jersey, the Battle of Brandywine and the Defense of Philadelphia. In the winter of 1777-78, he led his troops to Valley Forge, where they suffered privations, and emerged in the spring with considerably fewer men fit for service. On June 28, 1778, Grayson was central to the Battle of Monmouth. In Scott&#x27;s absence, Colonel Grayson took temporary command of the brigade, which was in the vanguard of an assault as part of Charles Lee&#x27;s Advance Guard. Grayson and the brigade were in the center of the battle in 100 degree heat, and held a far superior force to a stalemate, when Lee took personal command of all of his forces, while Grayson himself returned to Washington&#x27;s field command. General Lee badly misunderstood intelligence he was receiving, and the line broke into a disorganized retreat. Subsequently, Lee was court-marshalled by Washington, and Grayson, as one of the key officers at Monmouth, had to testify at the proceedings. In 1778, William Grayson served on a commission dealing with war prisoners. In 1779, he resigned his military commission to serve on the Congressional Board of War.

==Post-War career==

In 1781 Grayson returned to Dumfries and his legal practice. Like many Continental Army officers, he was an original member of the Society of the Cincinnati. He was also elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1780.

Like his brothers, Grayson owned slaves. In the 1787 Virginia tax census, by which time his eldest brother Benjamin Jr. had died, William Grayson owned eight enslaved adults in Prince William County, as well as four enslaved teenagers, two horses and eighteen cattle, compared to Rev. Spence Grayson, who owned fourteen enslaved adults, 21 enslaved teenagers, ten horses and 17 cattle.
Grayson&#x27;s political career began in 1784, when he won election as one of Prince William County&#x27;s two delegates (part time) in the Virginia House of Delegates. He replaced Arthur Lee and the following year would be replaced by the same man, who was then removed from office as disqualified by his federal office. Grayson had not stood for re-election because he was a delegate to the Confederation Congress from 1785 to 1787. While in that office, he helped to pass the Northwest Ordinance, including a provision that forbade slavery in the Northwest Territory.

As an Anti-Federalist, he joined George Mason, James Monroe, and Patrick Henry in opposing ratification of the proposed new United States Constitution at the Virginia Ratification Convention in 1788. In that Convention, Grayson argued that the proposed constitution was neither fish nor fowl—neither strong enough for a national government nor decentralized enough for a federal one — and thus eventually would either degenerate into a despotism or result in the dissolution of the Union.

Grayson experienced the inflation caused by Virginia and other states issuing paper fiat currency during the Revolutionary War. He later wrote to James Madison that:

==United States Senate==

Although the Anti-Federalists lost the battle in opposition of the new Constitution, Patrick Henry, Virginia&#x27;s leading Anti-Federalist, rewarded Grayson by arranging his election to the first United States Senate. Grayson served from March 4, 1789, until his death on March 12, 1790. He and Richard Henry Lee were the only members of the first Senate who had opposed ratification, and so they were unhappy when the Bill of Rights omitted any provisions making serious corrections to the division of powers between the central government and the states. Grayson continued to believe that the Philadelphia Convention had struck precisely the wrong balance.

==Death and legacy==
Grayson and his family had moved to Frederick County, Virginia (where his widow ultimately died), but he died at the home of his brother Rev. Spence Grayson on March 12, 1790. He hand wrote a will shortly before his death which appointed executors and charged them to make &quot;all my slaves born since Independance [sic] of America Free&quot;, which will was admitted to probate in Frederick County, despite some difficulties with the court clerk, on December 7, 1790. He was the first member of the United States Congress to die in office.

Rev. Spence Grayson survived another eight years, and both are interred in the Grayson family vault, with the current address (pathway and historical marker) at 2338 W. Longview Drive, Woodbridge. However, the house long out of family hands was used as a field hospital during the Civil War and the vault tomb dynamited. The estate of Richard Stonnell (who had owned the property and died in 1857) was finally settled though special chancery commissioner Eppa Hunton Jr. in 1887, with S.B. Stonnell receiving a deed and erecting a frame house atop the remaining foundation. The tomb&#x27;s restoration was opposed by the property owner in 1975, but the Daughters of the American Revolution restored it in 1981 and further restoration occurred in 2005, and 2014, despite the remainder of the property being in private hands.

A grandson, William Grayson Carter, became a Kentucky state senator; another grandson was Confederate General John Breckinridge Grayson.

Spence Grayson&#x27;s son John Robinson Grayson (born in 1779 at Belle Aire), was captured near the Occoquan River from the brig &quot;Polly&quot;, operated by Lund Washington. Impressed into the British Navy, upon his release in 1800, John Grayson became a captain in the United States Navy. During the War of 1812, Capt. Grayson commanded a squadron of gunboats off Georgia, where he settled. The original Belle Aire house, as well as mortuary vault, were destroyed during the American Civil War. The mortuary vault was rebuilt, encased in concrete and buried by the Daughters of the American Revolution in the early 20th century. Grayson County, Kentucky, the city of Grayson, Kentucky, and Grayson County, Virginia, were all named for the senator. in 1976, Prince William County erected a gazebo in Merchant Park beside the Weems-Botts Museum to honor William Grayson, and Virginia also erected a highway marker on Route 1 to commemorate him.

<text>Salem Poor (c. 1747–1802) was an enslaved African-American man who purchased his freedom in 1769, became a soldier in 1775. He was involved in the American Revolutionary War, particularly in the Battle of Bunker Hill.

==Early life==
Salem Poor was born in 1747 into slavery on a farm in Andover in the Province of Massachusetts Bay. The farm was owned by John Poor and Rebecca Poor and his son John Poor Jr. His first name may be derived from the Arabic word &quot;salaam&quot;, meaning &quot;peace&quot;. Other sources explain that his name may have been derived from his place of birth. He bought his freedom on July 10, 1769, from John Poor Jr. for £27, a year&#x27;s salary for an average working man at the time.  This would be equivalent to about $5,600 in 2019 dollars.

==Military career==
In May 1775, Poor enlisted in the militia when he was about 28 years old. He served under Captain Benjamin Ames in Colonel James Frye&#x27;s regiment. Colonel Frye&#x27;s command consisted of Lieutenant-Colonel James Bricket, Major Thomas Poor, Adjutant Daniel Hardy, and Surgeon Thomas Kittredge. His regiment, with two others, totaled 850 soldiers. They marched from Cambridge to Charlestown, Massachusetts, where the officers decided to fortify Breed&#x27;s Hill.  At Breed&#x27;s Hill, the regiments built a fort on the top of the hill using pick axes and shovels. The men worked quickly and quietly to ensure the British army occupying Boston did not know they were there.

Salem Poor was one of three dozen African Americans who fought on Bunker Hill. As many as 5000 soldiers, both free and enslaved African Americans fought for the Patriots. Meanwhile, about twenty to thirty thousand black soldiers fought for Britain. The British had an army twice the size of the Americans. They would assault Breed&#x27;s Hill on June 17, 1775. The Americans would push the British back in two assaults but would run out of ammunition and retreat during the third assault.

Poor is remembered for his actions during the Battle of Bunker Hill on June 17, 1775, where he was credited with mortally wounding British Lieutenant Colonel James Abercrombie, as he jumped onto the redoubt and yelled, &quot;Surrender, you rebels.&quot; While Abercrombie suffered multiple wounds in the battle, he managed to compose reports in the two days following the incident. Fellow officers who visited and spoke with him noted that the fatal shot that ultimately killed him came from friendly fire behind his position. John Pitcairn&#x27;s army had previously fired on the patriots at Lexington and Concord. John Trumbull would create his famous series of paintings, &quot;The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker&#x27;s Hill, June 17, 1775&quot;, depicting the death of American rebel General Joseph Warren and British Lieutenant Colonel James Abercrombie.

Poor&#x27;s valor and gallantry at the Battle of Bunker Hill prompted 14 officers, including Colonel William Prescott and Colonel Jonathan Brewer, to cite him for heroism and petition the General Court of Massachusetts with the following statement:

 The Reward due to so great and Distinguished a Character. The Subscribers beg leave to Report to your Honorable. House (Which We do in justice to the Character of so Brave a man) that under Our Own observation, we declare that A Negro Man Called Salem Poor of Col. Frye&#x27;s Regiment, Capt. Ames. Company in the late Battle of Charleston, behaved like an Experienced Officer, as Well as an Excellent Soldier. to Set forth Particulars of his Conduct would be Tedious, We Would Only beg leave to say in the Person of this Negro Centers a Brave &amp; gallant Soldier.

There is no evidence that Poor received a reward.

On July 10, 1775, George Washington ended the recruitment of African Americans. On November 12, he issued orders prohibiting all black men from serving in the Continental Army. Despite the ban on recruitment, those who had already been serving for some time were allowed to stay until this point. On hearing of this, Lord Dunmore, who at the time was Governor of Virginia, offered freedom to all enslaved people willing to serve with the British. Washington, sensing the disaster that would almost surely result, immediately changed his position, at once ordering all recruiters to enlist any black men who wanted to fight.

He is known to have retreated to the winter camp at Valley Forge and fought in the Battle of White Plains, Battle of Saratoga and Battle of Monmouth. He also served at Fort George.  Salem Poor served in New York in 1776 under General Benedict Arnold. He would eventually re-enlist for three years and spend his time in Saratoga. In 1777–1778, he was at Valley Forge and fought in the Battle of White Plains. Poor immediately re-enlisted in the militia and fought with the Patriot forces until March 20, 1780, when he was discharged in Providence, Rhode Island.

==Personal life==
In August 1771, Poor married Nancy Parker, &quot;a part Indian servant in the family of Capt. James Parker&quot;, according to papers in the Charlotte Helen Abbot Collection of the Andover Historical Society. Lois Kerschen, in the &quot;Encyclopedia of African American History&quot;, lists her as a &quot;free African American&quot;. They had a son, Jonas, who was baptized on September 29, 1776. In 1780, he married his second wife, Mary Twing, a free African American. The couple moved to Providence but were ordered to leave that city, presumably because they could not support themselves. In 1785, he placed an advertisement in the &quot;Boston Gazette&quot; to disown Mary&#x27;s debts and &quot;forewarn all Persons from trusting MARY, the Wife of the Subscriber&quot;.

Poor then married Sarah Stevens, a white woman, in 1787, and 1793 he spent several weeks in the Boston Almshouse. He was briefly jailed for &quot;breach of peace&quot; in 1799, married for the fourth and final time in 1801, and died in 1802. Details of his life after the Revolutionary War were not widely known until research by genealogist David Lambert, a descendant of Poor&#x27;s former enslavers; an article about this research appeared in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; in 2007. He was interred at Copp&#x27;s Hill Burying Ground near Boston, Massachusetts.

==Honors==
The petition sent by Col. Prescott and the other 13 officers suggested the Continental Congress offer Poor &quot;The Reward due to so great and Distinguish a Character.&quot; This memorial was dated at Cambridge on December 5, 1775. While the battle is thought to have been fought on Bunker Hill, it was fought on Breed&#x27;s Hill. A monument commemorates the battle on Breed&#x27;s Hill when General Warren fell on June 17, 1775. Daniel Webster gave two speeches at the 1843 ceremony, later known as the Bunker Hill Orations, commemorating soldiers like Salem Poor who fought in the battle. The monument&#x27;s cornerstone was laid by Lafayette in 1825.
In 1876, in a speech at the time of the United States&#x27; centennial celebration, George Washington Williams commemorated Poor and other African-American soldiers who fought at Bunker Hill. For the 1976 United States Bicentennial, Poor was honored in 1975 with a stamp in the &quot;Contributors to the Cause&quot; series. Poor Street in Andover was named after him.

<doc id="1020333" wikidata="Q2484636" url="?curid=1020333" title="Jovanka Broz">
<text>Jovanka Broz (; ; 7 December 1924 – 20 October 2013) was the First Lady of Yugoslavia as the wife of Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito. She was a lieutenant colonel in the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army.

She was married to Tito from 1952 until his death in 1980. Following her husband&#x27;s death, all of her property was seized and she moved to a state-owned villa, where she reportedly lived under virtual house arrest.

==Early life==
Jovanka Budisavljević was born on 7 December 1924, to an ethnic Serb family of Milica () and Milan &quot;Mićo&quot; Budisavljević in Pećane near Udbina, in the historical Krbava and Lika regions of Croatia, at the time part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. In April 1941, when World War II started in Yugoslavia, the Budisavljević family was forced to flee the violently anti-Serb Ustaše regime of the Independent State of Croatia, which targeted one third of the &quot;prečani&quot; Serbs for forced conversion to Catholicism, another third for expulsion and the final third for extermination. The family&#x27;s house was eventually burned down by the Ustaše troops. She joined the Yugoslav Partisans shortly thereafter, at the age of 17.

==Life with and around Tito==
Former JNA General Marjan Kranjc says Jovanka was assigned to the Marshal as early as 1945 as part of the personnel that checked his food and overall cleanliness for the purpose of preventing disease. After the death of Tito&#x27;s great love , whose grave is in the Royal Compound in Dedinje, in 1946, Jovanka became his personal secretary according to Kranjc. &quot;In this way she became a part of the inner most security ring around Tito and had to sign a secret cooperation agreement with the State Security Service (SDB), which was the law&quot; - says Kranjc.

===Initial relationship===
Milovan Đilas, one of the communist revolutionary movement&#x27;s leading members and ideologues, and a subsequent dissident, provides more details about Jovanka during this period in &quot;Druženje s Titom&quot; (&quot;Friendship with Tito&quot;). According to him, the relationship with Tito was extremely difficult for her:
She never appeared outside of Tito&#x27;s company. We&#x27;d see her many times as she was keeping a vigil for hours in a hallway&quot; [&quot;while we&#x27;re holding a late-night meeting inside&quot;]&quot;, to make sure she is available if Tito needs anything as he&#x27;s going to sleep. Because of that, the wrath and the lack of trust she was receiving from other servants was almost inevitable.&quot; [&quot;According to what was on offer&quot;]&quot; the motives for her closeness to Tito could&#x27;ve been explained in endless ways, none of which would show her character in a good light: career climbing, cajolery, malicious female extravagance, exploitation of Tito&#x27;s lonesomeness...

As far as she was concerned, Tito was a war and communist party deity for whom everyone was supposed to sacrifice everything they had. She was a woman deep in the process of comprehending Tito as a man, while also increasingly and devotedly falling in love with him. She was resigned to burn out or fade away, unknown and unrecognized if need be, next to the divine man about whom she dreamt and to whom she could only belong now that he has chosen her.

===Marriage===
The exact date of their marriage is also subject to debate. The secret wedding ceremony happened either during 1951 or in April 1952; however, the location of the ceremony is also not clear. Some sources say it took place in the Dunavka villa in Ilok while others list Belgrade&#x27;s municipality of Čukarica as the location.

===Deterioration===

Many believed her to be a victim of the ambitions of various politicians who managed to manipulate the ageing Marshal into turning against his wife. Ivo Eterović, a writer and photographer with unprecedented decades-long access to Yugoslavia&#x27;s ruling couple, stated &quot;the main culprits for the Tito-Jovanka split are that pig Stane Dolanc and General Nikola Ljubičić&quot;. In 1975, Tito left their common home, and she did not see him from 1977 to 1980 when he died. After Marshal Tito&#x27;s death she lived in seclusion in Dedinje, a Belgrade suburb, under house arrest.
The house was in a very bad condition; nobody cared to repair anything. The roof was leaking, she did not have her pension or her documents (ID and passport and health insurance card). She lived without heating for eight years. She got her ID and passport in 2009. They took her car, so she was not able to go to her husband&#x27;s grave when she wanted. The government had to be notified if she left the house. She had practically no human rights for 30 years.

===Death===

Broz was hospitalized on 23 August 2013, and died from a heart attack in a Belgrade hospital on 20 October 2013, aged 88. She was buried in the House of Flowers mausoleum near her husband&#x27;s grave.

===Memoirs ===
The book titled &quot;My Life, My Truth&quot; was released three weeks before she died.

== Honours ==
* : Dame Grand Cross of the National Order of Merit (8 May 1956).
* : Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown (22 October 1970).
* Iran : Commemorative Medal of the 2500th Anniversary of the founding of the Persian Empire (14 October 1971).
* Nepalese Royal Family: Member First Class of the Most Illustrious Order of the Three Divine Powers (2 February 1974).

== References in popular culture ==
In the British television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, the fictional character of Tegan Jovanka, one of the companions of the 
Fourth and Fifth Doctors, and one of the longest running companions of the Doctor, got the name as a combination of Tegan, named by one of the producers&#x27; niece, and Jovanka, after Jovanka Broz.

<doc id="1020336" wikidata="Q7896045" url="?curid=1020336" title="University of Ottawa Heart Institute">
<text>The University of Ottawa Heart Institute (UOHI) &quot;(French: Institut de cardiologie de l&#x27;Université d&#x27;Ottawa (ICUO))&quot; is Canada&#x27;s largest cardiovascular health centre. It is located in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It began as a department in The Ottawa Hospital, and since has evolved into a complete cardiac centre, encompassing prevention, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, research, and education.

UOHI cares for more than 60,000 cardiac patients each year, and patient satisfaction is among the highest in Ontario, averaging 87 percent. The Heart Institute is affiliated with the Ottawa Hospital and the University of Ottawa, specifically the Faculty of Medicine.

The institute also provides training to more than 100 physicians annually and runs an extensive cardiovascular research program, with 65 research faculty and research funding of approximately $65 million a year.

==History==
UOHI was founded in 1976 by Dr. Wilbert Keon, with financial support from the Ontario Ministry of Education. Keon worked with numerous partners, including all of the hospitals in the region, the University of Ottawa, and the Ottawa Hospital Regional District Planning council, to ensure the vision of a world-renowned institute would unfold as planned. The first phase of the Heart Institute—the Cardiac Unit, as it was then known—officially opened on May 11, 1976.

UOHI is the sole, independent provider of specialized cardiovascular care for 14 hospitals within the Ottawa region, home to over 1 million people (9 percent of the population of Ontario), and serves more than 40 referral hospitals throughout the province.

In 2004, UOHI recruited Dr. Robert Roberts from Baylor College of Medicine to serve as President and Chief Executive Officer. Roberts, an internationally recognized investigator in the field of molecular genetics, was brought in to place a greater emphasis on research within the institute. Shortly afterwards, UOHI established the Ruddy Canadian Cardiovascular Genetics Centre, the first such centre in Canada and one of only a handful worldwide dedicated to cardiovascular genetics.

In April 2014, former Heart Institute Chief of Cardiac Surgery Dr. Thierry Mesana took over as the third President and CEO of UOHI.

In April 2024, former Heart Institute Deputy Director General Dr. Rob Beanlands became the fourth President and CEO of UOHI.

The institute has been responsible for numerous ‘firsts’, including:
* First use of point of care genetic testing in clinical medicine as part of the RAPID GENE study.
* Ontario&#x27;s first angioplasty
* The first use in Canada, and 11th in the world, of the Jarvik 7 artificial heart as a bridge to transplant
* A heart transplant on the youngest recipient in Canada (an 11-day-old infant)
* Canada&#x27;s first cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) centre
* Discovery of a genetic mutation that causes one of the most common forms of heart disease—atrial fibrillation
* Identification of the first single-nucleotide polymorphism that increases susceptibility to heart disease regardless of other established risk factors
* A one-of-a-kind Canadian home tele-health monitoring program that cuts hospital readmission by 54 percent for heart failure patients
* A first multi-faceted Women&#x27;s Heart Health Centre that will focus its programs on prevention and management services for women at risk of and diagnosed with cardiovascular disease.

==Clinical specialties==
UOHI maintains a clinical staff of over 700, including physicians, nurses, technicians, and other health professionals. In addition to standard care, approximately 100 clinical trials are underway at the institute at any time.

===Cardiac anesthesiology===
More than 1,900 open-heart procedures at UOHI each year require anesthesia, including coronary artery bypass, valve replacement, heart transplant, pulmonary thromboendarterectomy, mechanical circulatory assist devices and others. Clinical anesthesia is also provided for a growing number and variety of pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, percutaneous aortic valve, and arrhythmia procedures.

===Cardiac imaging===
UOHI is a national centre for cardiac imaging. The institute employs all standard imaging modalities and evaluates experimental techniques and applications. UOHI also has the rare capability to develop and produce novel, short-lived nuclear tracers on site. The on-site cyclotron lets the institute produce many of its own medical isotopes, particularly for PET imaging. UOHI’s Nuclear Cardiology Program is the largest such clinical program in Canada.

===Cardiac surgery===
UOHI&#x27;s cardiac surgeons perform more than 1,900 open-heart procedures annually, and the institute is known for its reconstructive heart-valve surgery program. Dr. Pierre Voisine is the Chief of Cardiac Surgery. It has among the lowest mortality rates and largest patient volumes in North America, especially for high-risk patients. Surgical specialties include:
* Heart valve repair
* Percutaneous aortic valve replacement
* Multi-vessel small thoracotomy
* Heart transplantation
* Mechanical assist devices
* Thoracoscopic surgical ablation
* Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy

The Heart Institute is the provincial centre for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy.

===Cardiac Prevention and Rehabilitation===
The Cardiac Prevention and Rehabilitation program focuses its efforts in five areas: cardiac rehabilitation, prevention and wellness (for patient and public education), the Champlain Cardiovascular Disease Prevention Network, the Ottawa Model for Smoking Cessation (implemented in more than 200 medical institutions across Canada), and behavioral and risk modification research.

===Cardiology===
Approximately 60,000 patients a year visit UOHI’s cardiology clinics for testing and treatment of heart disorders. The Cardiology program operates a number of specialized clinics that address various conditions and risk factors for heart disease.

The institute&#x27;s cardiologists conduct more than 12,000 non-surgical interventions annually.

The ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) Protocol, developed at UOHI, specifies that paramedic in Ottawa identify patients with a STEMI heart attack and transport them directly to the Institute. The program has cut mortality rates from heart attack in Ottawa by half.

===Clinical services===
UOHI’s division of nursing manages or supports programs and units within the Heart Institute, including the cardiac catheterization and electrophysiology labs, the cardiac operating rooms, the cardiac surgery intensive care unit and the intensive cardiac care unit.

<text>Frederick Trubee Davison (February 7, 1896 – November 14, 1974) was an American World War I aviator, assistant United States Secretary of War, director of personnel for the Central Intelligence Agency, and president of the American Museum of Natural History.

==Biography==
He was born on February 7, 1896, to Henry Pomeroy Davison. He graduated from Groton School and then attended Yale University as part of the class of 1918.

He was a member of Yale&#x27;s secret Skull and Bones society.

===War years===
Davison was the founder of the First Yale Unit, which is considered to be the first naval air reserve unit. He founded the unit in 1916 in response to the war that was raging in Europe. Davison and a handful of other students from Yale feared that the United States would soon be dragged into the war effort and would find itself poorly prepared, especially in aviation. Davison told his mother that the government was &quot;asleep at the switch&quot;. After consulting with John Hays Hammond Jr. and Henry Woodhouse, Davison decided to pull together a group of twelve from amongst Yale&#x27;s undergraduates to form a unit of flyboys that would possibly operate along the Atlantic Coast. Hammond and Admiral Peary of the American navy had worked out plans to develop a type of coast guard along the eastern shores that would operate from the air. They wanted to set up a series of seaplane stations which would each have a specific piece of territory to patrol. Davison took to this idea immediately and formed the unit. In the First Yale Unit with him were Robert A. Lovett, John Vorys, John Villiers Farwell III, Albert Ditman, Wellesley Laud Brown, Artemus L. Gates, Erl Clinton Barker Gould, Allan Wallace Ames, C. D. Wiman, Albert Dillon Sturtevant, and H. P. Davison Jr. Davison and his friends began their aviation training privately with the help of pilot David Hugh McCulloch in the summer of 1916 while staying at the Davison&#x27;s house at Peacock Point. in Locust Valley on Long Island.

Davison also relied on the financial aid provided by his father, Henry P. Davison, and his friends in the form of flying boats and equipment for the unit. Over the next year, Trubee Davison would fight tirelessly to have the unit officially recognized by the U.S. Navy making trips to Washington to speak to the Secretary of the Navy, Josephus Daniels. Turned down again and again, Davison didn&#x27;t lose hope but instead became more persistent in his efforts to have the unit trained under military conditions and to have all of the members earn their navy wings so that they would be prepared to serve America at a moment&#x27;s notice. A short while after returning to the Yale campus, Davison learned that Lieutenant John H. Towers, a legendary pilot and the third ever to earn navy wings, was in New York. Davison went to speak with him and Towers was sympathetic to their cause and asked him to write a letter to Daniels telling him about their meeting. When he didn&#x27;t hear a response, Davison again contacted Towers and then went to Washington to meet with him. It was during this meeting that he gained the approval of the U.S. Navy to have the unit become part of the Naval Reserve and train in Palm Beach. Within five days Davison was off to Palm Beach along with the rest of the First Yale Unit to continue training as naval pilots.

On July 28, 1917, Davison was set to take his flying test in order to obtain his navy wings. Having fainted only a short while before the test, Davison was not sure about whether or not he should fly but decided he felt well enough. During the flight, he lost control of his seaplane in a panic attack and spiralled into the sea, the impact of which split the plane in two. Davison was admitted to St. Luke&#x27;s hospital where he was diagnosed with a broken back and injured spinal cord. He would spend six weeks there. Davison never saw combat but was active in unit activities throughout the war and was awarded the Navy Cross for his services.

===After the war===

After the war, Davison went back to Yale and, while rooming with fellow unit member &quot;Di&quot; (Artemus) Gates, finished his undergraduate program graduating in 1919. In 1920, he married Dorothy Peabody, the daughter of the headmaster at Groton School where he had attended before attending Yale. After his father died Trubee and Dorothy built a house on the Davison estate, Peacock Point, in order to keep his mother company.

Davison proceeded to attend Columbia University Law School where he earned a Law Degree and then went on to work with White and Case, Manhattan lawyers.

Every year, Davison held a reunion for the First Yale Unit in New York City in the summer and sometimes other naval aviators would attend as well original members.

He was on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine for August 24, 1925.

In 1951, he became a trustee of Yale and the first personnel director of the newly formed CIA.

===Political life===
Davison was elected to the New York State Legislature after the war where he gained a reputation as being one of the hardest-working members. In 1925, he became head of the unofficial &quot;Crime Commission&quot;, sponsored by Judge Elbert H. Gary.

He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Nassau Co., 2nd D.) in 1922, 1923, 1924, 1925 and 1926. He was Assistant Secretary of War for Air from July 1926 to March 1933. In the New York state election, 1932, he ran for Lieutenant Governor of New York with William J. Donovan, but they were defeated in a landslide by Democrats Herbert H. Lehman and M. William Bray. Davison was an alternate delegate to the 1940 Republican National Convention.

He died on November 14, 1974, in Locust Valley, New York.

<text>Västerås ( , , ) is a city in central Sweden on the shore of Lake Mälaren in the province of Västmanland, west of Stockholm. The city had a population of 127,799 at the end of 2019, out of the municipal total of 158,653, over 100,000 more than the next largest of the 17 localities included in the Västerås Municipality.
Västerås is the seat of Västerås Municipality, which is the capital of Västmanland County and an episcopal see.

== History==
Västerås is one of the oldest cities in Sweden and Northern Europe. The area has been populated since the Nordic Viking Age, before 1000 CE. Anundshög, Sweden&#x27;s largest burial mound, is located just outside the City of Västerås. It was built about 500 CE and is over wide and is almost high. In the beginning of the 11th century, Västerås was the second largest city in Sweden; by the 12th century, it had become the seat of the bishop.

The name &quot;Västerås&quot; originates from &quot;Västra Aros&quot; (), first recorded as &quot;Westraarus&quot; in the mid-13th century. In older sources, the city was often called simply &quot;Aros&quot; , but &quot;Västra&quot; was added to distinguish it from &quot;Östra Aros&quot;—the former name of Uppsala. The name reflects its location at the mouth of the Svartån River in Lake Mälaren.

In the ensuing centuries, a cathedral and a monastery were built; the Gothic cathedral, rebuilt by Birger Jarl on an earlier site, and consecrated in 1271, was restored in the 19th century. The first City Arms date from the end of the 13th century. A castle commands the town from an eminence; it was captured by King Gustav I and rebuilt by him, and Eric XIV was confined there from 1573 to 1575. Gustav also called together the riksdag in Västerås. During the riksdag assembly, the decision was made to convert Sweden into a Protestant state and to remove the power of the Catholic Church.
&quot;Rudbeckianska gymnasiet&quot;, the oldest gymnasium (secondary school) in Sweden, was built in Västerås by Johannes Rudbeckius in 1623.
In the 18th and 19th centuries, the growing of cucumber became popular, and Västerås received the nickname &quot;Gurkstaden&quot; (the Cucumber City), which it still retains today.

== Today ==

Västerås is predominantly known as an industrial city, but also a retailing and logistics city. The city wants to distinguish itself as &quot;Västerås – Mälarstaden&quot;, meaning &quot;Västerås—the city by Lake Mälaren&quot;, in order to attract tourists and new inhabitants, as well as students to the local University, Mälardalen University (approximately 16,000 enrolled students in Västerås and in the nearby Eskilstuna). To this effect, the city has started using a designed logo as branding in some official contexts, partially replacing the coat of arms, as well as rebuilding several old harbor areas to make them more attractive to live in. Västerås has the largest lakeside commercial and recreational port in Scandinavia on Lake Mälaren. The lake has many islands, and there are tourist boats that go out to them daily in the summer.
The city also has a skyscraper colloquially nicknamed &quot;Skrapan&quot; () which has Sweden&#x27;s highest-located cocktail bar, called Sky Bar, on the 24th floor of the building. Until 2017, Västerås hosted Power Big Meet, an annual event for owners and enthusiasts of classic American cars. The event moved to Lidköping in 2017, with arrangers citing having outgrown the available facilities in Västerås. Long-time Power Big Meet collaborator Klas Brink instead arranged the competing Västerås Summer Meet at the same location as Power Big Meet had been arranged for years.

==Climate==
According to the Köppen climate classification, Västerås experiences a humid continental climate bordering, according to the original isotherm, an oceanic climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;/&quot;Cfb&quot;) with cold winters and warm summers.
Summers tend to be quite unpredictable with sunny spells but with a risk of sudden showers. The sunniest weather usually occurs when high-pressure systems are blocking the low-pressure systems that usually move in from the Atlantic Ocean. Daytime temperatures in July mostly hover around , but may sometimes exceed and occasionally even .
Winters are usually cold with a snow cover that lasts for several months. Some winters can be mild with longer spells without snow on the ground. The weather differs a lot whether the air masses are coming from the Atlantic Ocean or from the Eurasian continent. In the first case, temperatures over might be expected. In the second case, the temperature may not rise above in the middle of the day. Lake Mälaren is usually frozen from December until the end of March.

The highest official temperature reading of was recorded on 9 July 1966. The lowest temperature of was recorded on 24 January 1875. 

The Åkesta observatory stands 4km to the north of the town, in Åkesta.

=== Industry ===

In 1891, the Turbine House, a small hydroelectric dam was built on Svartån, in central Västerås. This early electrification encouraged ASEA, a large electricity equipment manufacturer, to concentrate its operations in Västerås, shifting focus away from Arboga. After the 1988 merger with the power systems company Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie, ASEA became ABB Group. As a result, Västerås is home to its ABB AB Swedish subsidiary headquarters. ABB in Västerås maintains production, e.g. robots and drive systems for industry, high-voltage direct current transmission and power grids.

A number of business units have been spun out of ABB. Principal among them is Hitachi Energy (Hitachi).
Since the Westinghouse takeover of ABB&#x27;s nuclear business it is owned by Westinghouse Electric Company. It is situated mainly in Finnslätten, an industrial area in the northern part of Västerås. Westinghouse Sweden produces nuclear fuel and offers nuclear services for Boiling Water Reactors and Pressurized water reactors. , Westinghouse Sweden had more than 1000 employees. The plant has provided fuel for Ukraine since 2005. On 11 April 2014, after the Russian annexation of Crimea, the contract with Energoatom for the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant was extended through 2020.

Mälarenergi AB is a city-owned district heating and electric power provider for Västerås and surrounding area. Mälarenergi owns and operates a number of plants of which the biggest one is the heat and power plant in Västerås. It is Sweden&#x27;s largest combined heat and power plant, and the latest unit (number 6) uses waste as fuel.
Other major industries include Bombardier Transportation, which is active in railway business with production of propulsion systems for trains with worldwide customers, GE Power Sweden, Enics, Quintus Technologies AB (high pressure metal working and material densification equipment for the manufacturing industry) and Northvolt AB which designs, develops and manufactures lithium-ion battery cells and complete battery systems for electric vehicles, heavy transport, mining, and energy industries, as well as portable devices.

=== Retailing and trade ===
One of the historical reasons that made Västerås a city is its trading-friendly location by the river Svartån and lake Mälaren. The city remains one of the main logistical centers in Sweden due to its central location in the densely populated region Mälardalen and favourable infrastructure connections with railways, waterways and highways. Amongst others, ICA AB has one of its main distribution centres located in Västerås.
Västerås is the birthplace of multinational clothing retailer H&amp;M. Their first store was opened in the town centre in 1947.
Erikslund Shopping Center, on the outskirts of Västerås, was Sweden&#x27;s biggest mall until Mall of Scandinavia opened in 2015, and the retail park is the third biggest in sales after Kungens Kurva and Barkarby.

<text>Surahammar ( ) is a locality and the seat of Surahammar Municipality in Västmanland County, Sweden, with 6,179 inhabitants in 2010.

== History ==
During the reign of Gustav Vasa, there was a hammer in Surahammar. However, it is not known when the operation started, but it must have been before the year 1561. In 1637, a hammer with two hearths was erected by Axel Oxenstierna on the site where the current mill is located. In 1866, railway wheels and axles began to be manufactured and have been an important part of production ever since.

Towards the end of the 19th century, the sale of railway material declined. The mill&#x27;s subsidiary Vagnfabriks-Aktiebolaget in Södertälge (Vabis) was therefore looking for new products to sell. The newly hired engineer Gustaf Erikson was sent on a study trip to Europe and back in Surahammar he built Sweden&#x27;s first internal combustion engine car, which was his own construction with a kerosene engine. Vabi&#x27;s first car hit the market in 1901.

== Culture and sights ==
Hembygdsgården contains historic buildings with objects, serving all year round at events.

The stone house is used for art exhibitions and is also the start and finish of the 2.5 km &quot;historical walk&quot; with information boards with unique historical images.

The Golden Wheel MC Museum contains, in addition to motorcycles and bicycles, a drivable replica of Sweden&#x27;s first car, Gustaf Eriksson&#x27;s carriage from 1897. The museum building has unique murals. Surahammar&#x27;s mills museum shows the production chain from pig iron to railway wheels.

<doc id="1020347" wikidata="Q930262" url="?curid=1020347" title="Sala, Sweden">
<text>Sala is a locality and the seat of Sala Municipality in Västmanland County, Sweden. As of 2010, it has a population of 12,289.

Sala is the home of several famous places and people, but it is most known for its silver mine, which today is a popular tourist attraction.

The Sagån River flows south through the locality, en route to Mälaren.

==Silver mine==
The small town is best known for the historic Sala Silver Mine (Sala &quot;silvergruva&quot;), which is located about southwest of the town. It dates back to at least Medieval times, and was in operation until 1908. In 1624, the town of Sala was moved to its current location close to the mine, receiving its royal charter from King Gustavus Adolphus.

The silver was important for Sweden&#x27;s economy and the base for coin production. A total of 400 tonnes of silver was extracted, and 40,000 tonnes of lead; with at most 3-5 tonnes of silver during a year.

The mine eventually reached a depth of , and a total heading length of .

==Amenities==
The main streets, in terms of retail outlets, are Drottninggatan (which begins at &quot;stora torget&quot; — the town square — and runs west to Ekebygatan) and Bergsmansgatan (which begins at &quot;stora torget&quot; and runs east to Kålgårdsgatan).

The spa town of Sätra brunn, about from Sala, is another important place for the town.

===Måns Ols Utvärdshus===
Måns Ols Utvärdshus is a restaurant on the southeastern shore of Långforsen, a reservoir to the northwest of Sala&#x27;s centre. The location was originally a dust keeper&#x27;s home, and its first resident was Måns Olsson, who worked at the silver mine between 1709 and 1748. The building&#x27;s purpose evolved, and from around 1791 it began serving food and drink. Starting in the summer seasons from the late 19th century, the venue played host to carnivals, performances and competitions. The current building was erected in the 1960s. The Skanevall family took over the business in 2002.

==Transportation==
Sala&#x27;s bus and train station is located on Stationsplan, a short semi-circular road off Väsbygatan. About 35 trains from Stockholm Central Station (either directly or indirectly) arrive at the station each day, with around 40 making the return trip. The three high-speed SJ Snabbtåg trips take about one hour and twenty minutes. Journeys on SJ InterCity trains take a similar amount of time and run seven times a day. The slower SJ Regionaltåg trains take just over two hours but make around 20 trips from the capital. There is one SJ Tåg i Bergslagen, which departs Stockholm at 22:14 and is direct to Sala.

The SJ trains that pass through terminate at either Stockholm, Linköping, Falun, Mora (once per day), Uppsala or Västerås.

Sala&#x27;s airfield, &quot;Salanda flygfält&quot;, is located just east of highway 56, between Norrkivsta and Kumlaby. It is the home of Salaorten Flying Club (&quot;Salaorten Flygklubb&quot;), which flies Ultralight UL-B aircraft of type Atec Zephyr.

==Climate==
Sala has a humid continental climate influenced by both its inland position but also frequent maritime winds reaching the town, moderating winter averages compared to what would be expected for an inland location on its latitude.

==Sport==
Sala&#x27;s football club, Sala FF, play in Division 3 Södra Norrland in Sweden&#x27;s fifth tier. They were founded in December 1972, when IF Norden and IFK Sala merged. Their former home was Silvervallen, but they now play at the sports fields on Sportfältsgatan.

The first floorball club in the world, Sala IBK, was founded in Sala 1979.

==Notable people==
The impressionist painter Ivan Aguéli was born in Sala in 1869. There is a small museum and a park dedicated to his memory in the centre of the town. Sala is also the domicile of the former Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs and former Deputy Prime Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallén. She held several ministerial posts in the Social Democratic government in the 1980s and 1990s and has, despite her career in politics, remained in Sala and is still active in local life.

Ice hockey player Erik Ersberg was born here. British horror and thriller writer Steven Savile lives in Sala.

==International relations==
Sala is twinned with:

<text>Köping is a locality and the seat of Köping Municipality in Västmanland County, Sweden. It had 17,743 inhabitants in 2010. It is known for the television series &quot;I en annan del av Köping&quot;.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Köping&quot; means merchant place. It was mentioned for the first time in the 13th century. It was probably given such a name as it did not yet have a charter. The central location of Köping deems it appropriate for merchancy for people from different parts of the country.

== History ==

People have lived on the site for a long time, which is evident not least from the Viking-age boat burial ground at Norsa. An old trading post has been located near Köping. It is first mentioned in a document from the year 1257, when a bishops&#x27; meeting was held on the site. Köping, with central and southern Sweden was сhristianised in the 11th century. A church built around 1300, the Köping Church, still remains from the early days. Köping has been known as a city since 1349 when its city seal was invoked in a letter.

At Köping was the bailiff&#x27;s stronghold Köpingshus, mentioned for the first time in 1375 and destroyed by Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson&#x27;s revolt in 1434. Köping got its charter on January 19, 1474. Köpingshus was rebuilt in the 1580s during Johan III&#x27;s reign. Charles IX continued the work but later the work ceased and the bail had to lapse. In the 1660s, only ruins remained. Remains remained until the railway was built. Even in the 15th century, the name Laglösa kiöping still appears, which probably means that the trading post had no privileges. 

The city&#x27;s oldest church is probably a church dedicated to St. Olof, which was located after the current Mullgatan. The church appears to have been in poor condition in the early 15th century and then fell into disrepair and was demolished in the 1440s. After the current Köping church was ravaged by fire in 1437, it was given a size sufficient after the rebuilding to suffice for both the county and city parish. 

In 1641, Queen Kristina Prästgärdet was donated east of the river to plots, and gradually the &quot;new city&quot; grew here with its own square, Hökartorget or Lilla torget. In the 17th century Köping municipality produced large amounts of iron that was transported to other countries.

In the 19th century Köping established itself as an industrial city, with a large mechanical workshop and a prosperous harbor. A fire in 1889 destroyed large parts of Köping, whereafter it was rebuilt using stone material under supervision of architect Theodor Dahl.

In the 20th century all kinds of companies have established themselves in Köping. Volvo built a large industry there in the 1920s; the arguably most known bed manufacturer in Sweden, Hästens, in 1924; and a number of gold groceries between 1940 — 1960.

<text>Hallstahammar () is a locality and the seat of Hallstahammar Municipality in Västmanland County, Sweden with 10,478 inhabitants in 2010.

==Overview==
The King Gustaf Vasa built Strömsholm Castle along the lake about 1558. Its current appearance goes back to the 1680s. Today it hosts an interesting museum. The town is situated by the small river Kolbäcksån. Along that river many industries were established, and in 1628 the first smithy was built. In 1795 the Strömsholm Canal was inaugurated which enhanced goods transports. The town became a centre for transportation and commerce. In the 1930s it was shaped as a typical Swedish industrial town with close ties to the engineering industry. From the 1970s on, however, that industry has gradually lost its strong significance.

The Swedish soap opera Vänner och Fiender, which aired between 1996 and 2000, was recorded in the studio known as Hollyhammar.

The local bus traffic in Hallstahammar is free of charge, one of very few Swedish experiments with that type of service.

==Economy==
Steel production company Ovako has a production site in Hallstahammar.

<text>Joseph Stanton Jr. (July 19, 1739December 15, 1821) was a military officer, a United States senator of the Anti-Federalist faction and a United States Representative of the Democratic-Republican party.

==Early life==

Stanton was born in Charlestown in the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations in 1739. During the French and Indian War he served in the expedition against Quebec 1759. In June 1762 he was elected captain of the Artillery Company of Westerly, Charlestown and Hopkinton, an independent company of the Rhode Island Militia which still exists as the 169th Military Police Company. He represented Charlestown in the Rhode Island General Assembly from 1768 to 1774 and again in 1776.

==Military service==
During the American Revolutionary War, Stanton was commissioned as the lieutenant colonel of the 1st Kings County Regiment of the Rhode Island Militia in July 1776. He then served as the colonel of a regiment of state troops, raised for 15 months service, from December 12, 1776, until his resignation on November 10, 1777. (The regiment was part of a brigade of two infantry and one artillery regiments which was formed to deter an invasion of the mainland portion of Rhode Island by the British forces occupying Newport.) 

In May 1779 he was appointed at the colonel of the 1st Kings County Regiment of the militia and was subsequently appointed a brigadier general in command of the Kings County Brigade of militia in October of the same year. In May 1788 he was promoted to major general in command of the entire Rhode Island Militia. He held this position until his resignation in October 1790.

==Political career==

He was a delegate to the Rhode Island Constitutional Convention in 1790, which ratified the United States Constitution and enabled Rhode Island to be the last of the 13 colonies to join the Union.

He was elected by the General Assembly to serve as one of the first two U.S. Senators from Rhode Island, and served from June 12, 1790, to March 3, 1793, as a member of the Anti-Administration Party (i.e. opposed to President George Washington). He was later elected to the United States House of Representatives, where he served from March 4, 1801, to March 3, 1807, as a member of the Jeffersonian Democrat-Republican Party.

Stanton died in Lebanon, Connecticut, in 1821 at the age of 82, and was buried in the Stanton family cemetery in Charlestown.

==Legacy==
There is a monument to Senator Stanton on US Route 1 in Charlestown, Rhode Island, in front of his birthplace, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The General Stanton Inn in Charlestown is named after him.

<doc id="1020367" wikidata="Q7250792" url="?curid=1020367" title="Prospect Park, Minneapolis">
<text>Prospect Park is a historic neighborhood within the University community of the U.S. city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. The area is bounded by the Mississippi River to the south, the City of Saint Paul, Minnesota to the east, the Burlington Northern railroad yard to the north, and the Stadium Village commercial district of the University of Minnesota to the west. The neighborhood is composed of several districts which include the East River Road area. The 1913 Prospect Park Water Tower is a landmark and neighborhood icon.

An urban village once served by streetcar, Prospect Park is now a combination of multiple districts and uses. People live in single-family homes on Tower Hill, as well as apartment housing in the western districts. Estate homes of the early to mid 20th century line East River Road. University Avenue houses a mix of retail and restaurant businesses from the Stadium Village area.

The entire core of the neighborhood was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015 as the Prospect Park Residential Historic District for its significance in the theme of social history. It was nominated for its cohesive community spirit, developed—despite the neighborhood&#x27;s hilly terrain and diverse housing stock—through such innovations as Minneapolis&#x27;s first community association.

==History==
In 1874 real estate tycoon Louis F. Menage began plotting new subdivisions along Minneapolis&#x27;s southern boundaries. Menage petitioned the City Council to accept his Prospect Park plats in 1884. Construction lasted into the 1910s as topography and geographic isolation made building difficult. Houses were designed in the popular architectural styles of the period, especially the Queen Anne and the Colonial Revival styles. The Minneapolis Board of Education constructed the Sidney Pratt Elementary School in 1898.

Thomas Lowry&#x27;s interurban commuter train served the neighborhood with its stop at Malcolm Avenue until eventually the intercity line between Saint Paul and Minneapolis along University Avenue was opened. The Franklin Avenue Bridge also eventually carried a line.

1909 Racial Conflict

“Race War Started in Prospect Park.” Minneapolis Star Tribune, October 22, 1909. In 1908, a black couple, Madison and Amy Woods Jackson moved into their new brick home in Minneapolis’s Prospect Park neighborhood. They had three young daughters: Marvel, Helen and Zelma.

At the advice of his friend and fellow Pullman Porter Madison Jackson, William H. Simpson had decided to establish a home in the same middle-class neighborhood. Both Jackson and Simpson were African American. Neighbors grumbled when Jackson had moved his family into the all white neighborhood.

On October 21, 1909, a crowd of over one hundred residents marched to the Jackson residence, where Simpson was staying to oversee the construction of his new house. There, they delivered an unequivocal message to Simpson: Members of his race were not welcome in Prospect Park.

==Tower Hill==
Tower Hill (established 1906), which is the site of the Prospect Park Water Tower, is often cited as the city&#x27;s highest point and a placard denotes the highest elevation at , but a spot at in or near Deming Heights Park in Northeast Minneapolis is corroborated by Google Earth as the highest ground. The Tower, designed by Frederick William Cappelen, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The top of the water tower is accessible once a year to the public so long as they have the cone of ice cream in their hand upon entry.

== SEMI District ==
The SouthEast Industrial Area (SEMI) in the north contains light manufacturing, rail yards and remnant grain silos. Many plans for redeveloping the land have been created, including proposals from the nearby University of Minnesota. Starting in the early 2000s, Wall Companies purchased land in the surrounding SEMI District with plans of creating a technology and research campus, with the goal of attracting businesses that wanted proximity to the University of Minnesota. After failing to bring this idea to fruition, a different proposal to create a food hall out of the neighboring Harris Machinery Building, taking advantage of the nearby Green Line and U of M Transitway was implemented. The food hall, named Malcom Yards, was opened to the public in August 2021.

A prominent structure in the SEMI is the ADM-Delmer #4 grain elevator locally known for its United Crushers graffiti on its side. It was originally constructed as a part of the ADM-Delmer facility, named after its owner the Archer-Daniels-Miller company, which started construction in 1925 and ended in 1931. The site was made up of 4 grain elevators. After its abandonment, elevators #2 and #3 where demolished. During the early 2000&#x27;s, the local graffiti crew United Crushers tagged the southern wall of the elevator.

==Demographics==
The neighborhood is demographically diverse. Tower Hill extending south to the river contains families and retired empty-nesters. The Glendale Housing project southeast of 27th Avenue SE and University Avenue SE contains 700 families with the average household income slightly above $9,000 and 32% of residents living at or below the poverty level. On the former industrial areas of the west and north are newer student housing apartment buildings for both undergraduate and graduate students.

===Race===
* White 52.4%
* Black 11.0%
* American Indian and Alaska Native 0.3%
* Asian 27.0%
* Other 0.4%
* Two or more 4.6%

===Ethnicity===
* Not hispanic or Latino 96.6%
* Hispanic or Latino 4.4%

==Government==
Prospect Park is entirely within Minneapolis&#x27;s Ward 2, currently represented by Robin Wonsley on the Minneapolis City Council. The neighborhood association, PPERRIA, founded in 1901, is the oldest neighborhood association in the city of Minneapolis.

==Arts and culture==
The neighborhood has an annual &quot;Ice Cream Social,&quot; a get-together for the neighborhood with food, music and other entertainment. It is the one time of year when the interior of the Prospect Park Water Tower is opened to the public, allowing for a panoramic view of Minneapolis from the top.

Near the south end of the neighborhood on Bedford Street is the Malcolm Willey House, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and named after a University administrator. The historic significance of the house played a large part in preventing its destruction when Interstate 94 was built in the 1950s. The current goal of the neighborhood is to establish an &quot;urban-village&quot; feel — that is, a somewhat self-contained feel in the context of a larger city. Prospect Park also has a few surviving houses from the 19th century.

The neighborhood is home to two community centers, Pratt Elementary School and Luxton Park.

<doc id="1020378" wikidata="Q7943500" url="?curid=1020378" title="Vulcan statue">
<text>The &quot;Vulcan&quot; statue is the largest cast iron statue in the world, and is the city symbol of Birmingham, Alabama, United States, reflecting its roots in the iron and steel industry. The tall statue depicts the Roman god Vulcan, god of the fire and forge, with ironworking equipment. It was created as Birmingham&#x27;s entry for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (1904 World&#x27;s Fair) in St. Louis, Missouri. While it is the world&#x27;s largest made of iron, it is also among the nation&#x27;s tallest statues of any kind.

==History==

===Construction===
Commissioned by the Commercial Club of Birmingham, Italian-born sculptor Giuseppe Moretti began designing the monumental figure in 1903, using a tall model to study the form. He next sculpted a clay master model in an unfinished church in Passaic, New Jersey, and this was then divided into sections and transported by railroad to the Birmingham Steel and Iron Company for the preparation of casting molds for the iron.

Moretti received an artist&#x27;s fee of $6,000, which would be about $ in dollars. The Commercial Club of Birmingham held art shows, concerts, baseball games, and many more activities to raise the estimated $15,000 ($ in dollars) it would cost to build and transport the statue. It is also noted that pot metal statuettes of &quot;Vulcan&quot; were sold at both the St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair and in Birmingham, Alabama for two dollars apiece to help in the accumulated costs it took to create the statue.

The &quot;Vulcan&quot; statue consists of 29 cast-iron components with connecting flanges that are bolted together internally. The heaviest section is his whole head, which weighs . Iron forgemen designed and executed the connection details for the statue, which originally had no internal framework and was self-supporting. The grey iron castings were made in Birmingham entirely from locally produced iron.

The completed weight of the god Vulcan&#x27;s figure alone is . When Vulcan&#x27;s anvil, block, hammer, and spearpoint are added, the statue weighs a total of and it stands on a pedestal. The statue has a chest circumference of and a waist circumference of .

===1904 World&#x27;s Fair===
The statue was shipped to St. Louis as Birmingham&#x27;s entry into the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair. Vulcan dramatically demonstrated the mineral riches and manufacturing capabilities of the Birmingham area while on display in the Louisiana Purchase Exposition&#x27;s &quot;Palace of Mines and Metallurgy&quot;. It was awarded a &quot;Grand Prize&quot;.

When the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair ended, the &quot;Vulcan&quot; statue was dismantled and returned to its home city of Birmingham, only to be left in pieces alongside the railroad tracks due to unpaid freight bills.

===Alabama State Fairgrounds===
The &quot;Vulcan&quot; statue was eventually re-erected at the Alabama State Fairgrounds, but the statue&#x27;s arms were installed incorrectly, and the god was without his spear, which had been lost on the way from St. Louis.

With nothing to hold in its hands, &quot;Vulcan&quot; soon became an advertising figure. Over the years, &quot;Vulcan&quot; held an ice cream cone, a Coca-Cola bottle, and even Heinz pickles. In the late 1920s, the statue was disassembled for inspection. During this time, children would often play around the disassembled statue. It was painted a flesh color and was reassembled in the early 1930s.

===Atop Red Mountain===
It was not until 1936 that the statue found a suitable home, thanks to the Works Progress Administration, which partially funded a new park in the city at the top of Red Mountain. A pedestal was built of local sandstone, and &quot;Vulcan&quot; was hoisted into place. A new spear was fabricated to be held high in his right hand while his left hand held a hammer at his side. &quot;Vulcan&quot; was repainted in an aluminum like finish. The statue&#x27;s naked buttocks have been a source of humor for many years. A novelty song, &quot;Moon Over Homewood,&quot; refers to the fact that the statue &quot;moons&quot; the neighboring suburb of Homewood, Alabama.

A nine-day festival commenced on May 7, 1939 to dedicate Vulcan Park. Evelyn Tully was crowned the Vulcan Queen. Guests of honor included the foundrymen who originally cast &quot;Vulcan&quot;. A crowd of 5,000 was present for the opening night of the festival.

In 1938 a challenge was sent out to hundreds of engineers and architects throughout the Southeast to design the base and park area. There were hundreds of submissions but a little known draftsman by the name of Carl Franklin Edins from Birmingham, Alabama was unanimously declared the winner.

To take full advantage of &quot;Vulcan&quot;″s position overlooking Birmingham, the city&#x27;s Junior Chamber of Commerce in 1946 made the statue into a symbol for road safety. His spear was replaced by a neon torch that glowed green, except during the 24 hours following a fatal traffic accident, when it glowed red. The spear was restored after the 1999–2004 restoration.

In 1949, &quot;Vulcan&quot; got new neighbors, when two television stations, WAFM-TV (now WVTM) and WBRC located their studios and towers on Red Mountain.

===Centennial facelift===

To celebrate Birmingham&#x27;s centennial, the area around the statue was given a $1 million facelift in 1971. The original tower was clad in Alabama marble with an elevator and observation deck added. A covered walkway also connected a gift shop and snack bar. &quot;Vulcan&quot; was repainted a rust red a few years later. &quot;Vulcan&quot; was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 6, 1976.

Unfortunately, the statue itself had, when originally placed atop the pedestal, been filled up to the chest with concrete and had begun to deteriorate seriously due to different expansion and contraction rates of concrete versus cast iron. By 1990, an engineering study found that the statue was in danger of collapse.

===1999–2004 restoration===
&quot;Vulcan&quot; was removed during October and November 1999 in preparations for a $14 million renovation process that saw the park and pedestal restored to its original 1938 appearance. The statue sat in Vulcan Park&#x27;s parking lot until the fall of 2001, when it was shipped to Robinson Iron to be repaired. The statue itself was thoroughly inspected and repaired, with some parts, including the lost spear point, re-cast. The new and restored pieces were thoroughly coated with a durable paint system, including a light-gray finish coat dubbed &quot;Vulcan Gray&quot; by the specifier.

Meanwhile, in 2002, the 1971 park additions were demolished, and scaffolding went up around &quot;Vulcan&quot;″s tower. Workmen cleaned and repaired the original tower. &quot;Vulcan&quot;″s head and right arm went on display at the Birmingham Museum of Art while the tower was prepared.

&quot;Vulcan&quot; was re-erected on a steel armature atop his tower during June 2003, restored to its original appearance as intended by Moretti, reoriented to the east. Television stations WVTM and WBRC both provided live webcams of the reinstallation.

Shortly after the statue was reinstalled, the scaffolding came down, and a new observation deck, providing panoramic views of the area, was installed. The museum at the base was rebuilt and a new elevator was installed, but oriented so it would not be easily seen from downtown Birmingham. The original waterfalls were not rebuilt, though the stone walkways leading from the parking lot directly to &quot;Vulcan&quot;″s tower were restored. The statue and park were officially reopened in 2004, celebrating Vulcan&#x27;s 100th birthday. In 2004, Vulcan Park welcomed more than 100,000 visitors who took in the statue&#x27;s views of downtown Birmingham.

The restoration project received a National Preservation Honor Award from the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 2006.

==Vulcan Park and Museum==
Vulcan Park and Museum (VPM) features views of Birmingham, an interactive history museum that examines &quot;Vulcan&quot; and Birmingham&#x27;s story, and a 10-acre (4 ha) urban green space. In May 2007, Vulcan Park and Museum was designated an official Birmingham Information Center by the Greater Birmingham Convention and Visitors Bureau and offers information on transportation services, restaurants, events and other cultural offerings in Birmingham.

Vulcan Park and Museum is operated by Vulcan Park Foundation, a non-profit organization with a mission to preserve and promote Vulcan as the symbol for the Birmingham region, to advance knowledge and understanding of Birmingham&#x27;s history and culture, and to encourage exploration of the region.

<doc id="1020381" wikidata="Q7668196" url="?curid=1020381" title="T. Coleman Andrews">
<text>Thomas Coleman Andrews (February 19, 1899 – October 15, 1983) was an American accountant, state and federal government official, and the States&#x27; Rights Party candidate for President of the United States in 1956.

==Early and family life==
Andrews was born in Richmond, Virginia, to Cheatham William Andrews (a driver who rose to overseer of a livery stable) and his wife (Dora Lee Pittman), although the family also traced its descent from Elizabethan cleric Lancelot Andrewes. He had an older brother, Edgar L. Andrews (1897-1950) and a younger brother, Ramon Washington Andrews (1903–1974). Thomas Coleman Andrews married Rae Wilson Reams (1900–1989), and they had two sons: Thomas Coleman Andrews Jr. and Wilson Pittman Andrews (1929–2012; he would become a U.S. Coast Guard officer and entrepreneur).

==Career==
After graduating from John Marshall High School in Richmond in 1916, Andrews worked as an office boy at Armour meat packing company in Richmond. He then studied accounting privately, worked with a public accounting firm, F.W. Lafrentz &amp; Company, and was certified as a CPA in 1921. Andrews formed his own public accounting firm in 1922. He went on leave from his firm in 1931 to become the auditor of public accounts for the Commonwealth of Virginia, a position he held until 1933. He then became the accounting member of the Public Utilities Rate Study Commission of Virginia. He also took leave in 1938 to serve as controller and director of finance for his home city, Richmond.

During World War II, as his sons enlisted in the Air Corps and Coast Guard, Andrews served in the office of the Under-Secretary of War as a fiscal director, and in 1942 was assigned to the staff of the Contract Renegotiation Division in the Office of the Undersecretary of the Navy. He joined the United States Marine Corps in 1943, which lent him to the State Department, and so he worked as an accountant in North Africa and then was a staff officer in the Fourth Marine Aircraft Wing, achieving the rank of major before his retirement.

Andrews then joined the U.S. General Accounting Office and became the first director of its Corporation Audits Division, then returned to private practice in Richmond in 1947. In addition to continuing to work with T. Coleman Andrews &amp; Company (founded in 1922), he founded Bowles, Andrews &amp; Towne (actuaries and pension fund consultants) in 1948) and Andrews and Howell (management engineering consultants) in 1952. He was active in the AICPA, serving as its treasurer (1926–1927), vice president (1948–49), and president (1950–51), and was also a member of its council and executive committees, including the GABF, and received its gold medal award in 1947. He was AICPA&#x27;s representative to the Second International Congress of Accountants in 1926 and chairman of the Accounting and Auditing Study Group of the Hoover Commission in 1948 and then was chairman of the Virginia Citizens Committee for the Hoover Report.

He accepted an appointment as Commissioner of Internal Revenue in 1953, becoming the first CPA to hold that office. He left the position in 1955, stating his opposition to the income tax. Andrews ran for president as the States&#x27; Rights Party candidate in the election of 1956; his running mate was former Congressman Thomas H. Werdel. Andrews won 107,929 votes (0.17% of the vote), running strongest in the state of Virginia (6.16% of the vote), winning Fayette County, Tennessee and Prince Edward County, Virginia.

While running for office, Andrews was a trustee and visiting lecturer of the University of Virginia&#x27;s Graduate School of Business Administration (1955–56). In 1965, Andrews retired from his accounting businesses and worked with his sons in organizing a variety of service enterprise firms.

His son Thomas Coleman Andrews Jr. would become a prominent political organizer and segregationist who thrice won election to the Virginia House of Delegates in the 1960s and supported Alabama Governor George C. Wallace for president in 1968.

==Death, honors and legacy==
Andrews survived his wife by more than a decade before he died in Richmond. During his lifetime, Andrews received honorary legal degrees from the University of Michigan in 1955 and from Grove City College in 1963. He also received an honorary Doctor of Commercial Science from Pace College in 1954 and an honorary Doctor of Science degree from the University of Richmond, as well as the Department of the Treasury&#x27;s Alexander Hamilton Award (1955).

<text>John Walker (February 13, 1744December 2, 1809) was a public official from Virginia.

==Biography==
Walker was born in Virginia, the son of Dr. Thomas Walker. He received private education before attending the College of William and Mary, which he graduated from in 1764. He was a neighbor and classmate at William and Mary of Thomas Jefferson and they remained close friends until the elections of 1804-1805. In 1768, he was elected to the American Society. In 1772, he replaced his father as a representative of the House of Burgesses. He was in the Continental Army, serving in 1777 as an aide-de-camp to General George Washington, holding the rank of colonel. In 1780, he was elected as a delegate to the Continental Congress. He then studied law. When William Grayson died in 1790, Walker was appointed to the United States Senate to serve from March 31 to November 9 of that year, when a successor was elected by the Virginia General Assembly. Thomas Jefferson’s attempted seduction of his wife, which almost led to a duel, and was fodder for the Federalist Press, is discussed in Dumas Malone’s Jefferson the Virginian (Boston, Little Brown and Company, 1948 Appendix III pp 447-451).

Walker owned slaves. He died in 1809.

<doc id="1020389" wikidata="Q1909219" url="?curid=1020389" title="Matt Hasselbeck">
<text>Matthew Michael Hasselbeck (born September 25, 1975) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 18 seasons, primarily with the Seattle Seahawks. He played college football for the Boston College Eagles and was selected in the sixth round of the 1998 NFL draft by the Green Bay Packers. After a season on the practice squad and two seasons backing up Brett Favre, he was traded to the Seattle Seahawks in 2001, where he spent the majority of his career. Hasselbeck led Seattle to six playoff appearances, including the franchise&#x27;s first Super Bowl appearance during the 2005 season. He was selected to three Pro Bowls in his career. Hasselbeck also played for the Tennessee Titans and Indianapolis Colts. He is a former analyst for ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Sunday NFL Countdown&quot; and &quot;Monday Night Countdown.&quot;

==Early life==
Hasselbeck is the son of Mary Beth &quot;Betsy&quot; (Rueve) and Don Hasselbeck, a former New England Patriots tight end. Matt and his younger brothers Tim and Nathanael grew up in Norfolk, Massachusetts, and attended Xaverian Brothers High School in Westwood. He was selected as an honorable mention All-American by &quot;USA Today&quot; as a high school senior.

==College career==
Hasselbeck attended Boston College near his family&#x27;s hometown. He played for the Boston College Eagles football team from 1994 through 1997, including two years with his younger brother Tim. Hasselbeck finished his college career as the starting quarterback (a position his brother Tim would later hold with the Eagles). He graduated with a degree in marketing.

===College career statistics===
==Professional career==

===Green Bay Packers===
Hasselbeck was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the sixth round (187th overall) of the 1998 NFL draft. He joined the team&#x27;s practice squad in 1998 and was the backup for starting quarterback Brett Favre for the 1999 and 2000 NFL seasons.

===Seattle Seahawks===
Hasselbeck joined former Packers head coach Mike Holmgren and the Seattle Seahawks on March 2, 2001. The Packers traded him, along with their first draft pick (17th overall), to the Seahawks for their first (10th overall) and third-round draft picks (72nd overall).

In his early years in Seattle, he battled for playing time with Trent Dilfer. However, after a strong finish in 2002, Hasselbeck entered 2003 as the unquestioned starter. Hasselbeck started all 16 games, leading Seattle to a 10–6 record for the first time since 1988 and a Wild Card berth. He also was selected to the Pro Bowl. The 2003 NFC Wild Card Game against the Green Bay Packers went into overtime where, at the overtime coin toss, Hasselbeck famously said &quot;we want the ball and we&#x27;re going to score!&quot; During the second overtime possession for the Seahawks, Hasselbeck threw an interception to Packers defensive back Al Harris which was returned 52 yards down the sideline for a touchdown. It gave Green Bay a 33–27 overtime victory.

In 2004, Hasselbeck won the 2004 NFL Quarterback Challenge. He also led Seattle to their first NFC West title since conference realignment in 2002.

In 2005, Hasselbeck had one of his most productive career performances, earning the highest passer rating in the NFC, and leading the Seahawks to the playoffs for the third consecutive year while clinching the NFC&#x27;s top seed. He led the Seahawks to Super Bowl XL, in which they lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers, and was the starting quarterback for the NFC in the 2006 Pro Bowl.

Hasselbeck led the Seahawks to a 4–1 record to start the 2006 season before being seriously injured on Week 7. Minnesota Vikings linebacker E. J. Henderson rolled into Hasselbeck&#x27;s right leg. The result was a second degree MCL sprain, causing Hasselbeck to miss four games. Hasselbeck contended that Henderson could have avoided injuring him. Upon returning he subsequently broke fingers on his non-throwing hand, but continued to lead his team to a 9–7 record and the divisional round of the post-season. The fourth-seeded Seahawks defeated the Dallas Cowboys 21–20 in the wild card round in Seattle, then lost to the top-seeded Chicago Bears in overtime, 27–24.

In 2007, Hasselbeck led his team to its fourth consecutive division title and fifth consecutive playoff appearance. He had 3,966 passing yards, 28 touchdowns (both career highs), 62.6% completion percentage, and a 91.4 passer rating. He threw for 229 yards in a 35–14 NFC wild card victory over the Washington Redskins. The third-seeded Seahawks lost in the divisional round to the NFC&#x27;s No. 2 seed Green Bay Packers, losing 42–20 in the snow at Lambeau Field despite an early 14–0 lead.

Hasselbeck set career highs in yards, attempts, and touchdown passes in the 2007 season and was elected to his third Pro Bowl.

In 2008, Hasselbeck suffered from a back injury that affected a nerve in his lower back, creating a weakness in his leg that brought on a knee injury. Hasselbeck twisted his back awkwardly in the preseason opener on August 8 at Minnesota and missed the rest of the preseason. His bulging disk was diagnosed and treated with injections and he opened the regular season as the starter, but he hurt his knee after a hit early in the Seahawks&#x27; loss to the New York Giants on October 5. He also received a helmet-to-helmet hit against the Arizona Cardinals. These injuries caused Hasselbeck to miss most of the 2008 NFL season.

In the 2009 season opener, things did not start out well for Hasselbeck, who threw two interceptions in the first quarter. After that Hasselbeck dominated the rest of the way, completing 25 of 36 passes for 279 yards and three touchdowns in their 28–0 win over the St. Louis Rams. During Week 2 of the season, Hasselbeck fractured his rib against the San Francisco 49ers and missed the next two games against the Chicago Bears (Week 3) and the Indianapolis Colts (Week 4). During Week 5, playing the Jacksonville Jaguars, Hasselbeck threw four touchdown passes in the Seahawks&#x27; second shutout of the season, beating Jacksonville 41–0. In Week 6, Hasselbeck played his career-worst, losing to the Arizona Cardinals 27–3.

During the final week of the season, Hasselbeck won the Seahawks&#x27; &quot;Steve Largent Award.&quot;

In 2010, the season started off strong for Hasselbeck, leading his team to a 4–2 record and victories over the Chicago Bears and San Diego Chargers. But the degree of Hasselbeck&#x27;s health would prove to be inconsistent, with injuries leading him to sit out two games during the season, and leading the Seahawks to lose seven of their last ten. Nevertheless, Seattle would make the playoffs with their fifth NFC West division championship.

Seattle became the first team with a losing record to host a playoff game, taking on the defending Super Bowl XLIV champion New Orleans Saints during wild card weekend. Despite being 11 point underdogs, Hasselbeck had one of the most memorable and clutch performances of his career. He threw for 272 yards, four touchdowns (a franchise postseason record) with one interception coming from a tipped ball, and a 113.03 passer rating, leading the Seahawks to victory over the Saints. However, Seattle would go on to lose 35–24 in the divisional playoffs against the Chicago Bears. Hasselbeck still played well, however, with over 250 yards passing and three touchdowns.

====Playoff career====
Hasselbeck&#x27;s 11 postseason starts as a quarterback rank 16th all-time in NFL history, leading the Seahawks to five postseasons in a row under Mike Holmgren at one point.

In 2003, his first playoff appearance, Hasselbeck pronounced, &quot;we want the ball and we&#x27;re going to score&quot; at the coin flip of overtime with the Green Bay Packers. Hasselbeck was intercepted by Al Harris in overtime, who returned the pass for a game-winning touchdown. After that season, Hasselbeck would go on to lead Seattle to six playoff appearances in eight years.

In 2005, Hasselbeck led the Seahawks to Super Bowl XL, where they lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers in a game remembered for its poor officiating. The NFL Network called it one of the 10 most controversial games in NFL history. Head referee Bill Leavy later apologized to Hasselbeck at a Seahawks offseason practice in 2010, publicly saying he would &quot;go to his grave for kicking several calls in the fourth quarter that affected the outcome of the game.&quot;

In 2006, Hasselbeck rallied the Seahawks in the fourth quarter and threw the game-winning touchdown at Qwest Field to beat the Dallas Cowboys 21–20, but that occurred before Tony Romo&#x27;s infamous dropped snap.

In 2010, Hasselbeck led the Seahawks to a surprising playoff upset when he beat the New Orleans Saints, who were the defending Super Bowl XLIV champions and 11-point favorites. Although the game would be remembered for Marshawn Lynch&#x27;s Beast Quake run, Hasselbeck was an integral part in the win with 272 yards and four touchdowns. The game was called &quot;Hasselbeck&#x27;s finest hour&quot; by ESPN, and turned out to be his final game at Qwest Field in Seattle leading Seattle to a 41–36 upset of the New Orleans Saints.

====Departure from Seattle====
Hasselbeck&#x27;s departure from the Seahawks was largely a surprise, given his status with the Seattle fan base. At the conclusion of the 2010 season Pete Carroll announced re-signing Hasselbeck was the Seahawks &quot;number one offseason priority&quot;, with Hasselbeck emphasizing his desire to retire in Seattle. However, the two sides had trouble reaching an agreement as Hasselbeck reportedly turned down a one-year offer before the NFL lockout began, asking for two years. When Hasselbeck was rumored to be &quot;Plan A&quot; for the Tennessee Titans and rumors surfaced the Seahawks were pursuing Tarvaris Jackson instead of Hasselbeck, Seattle fans began a web and social media campaign at the end of the NFL lockout in 2011 to &quot;Bring Back Matt&quot;, with a website www.bringbackmatt.com. Pete Carroll and general manager John Schneider called Hasselbeck after the lockout to let them know they were &quot;moving on.&quot; Hasselbeck described the call as &quot;worse than breaking up with an old girlfriend.&quot; The Seahawks took out a full-page ad in &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; the following day to salute Hasselbeck and his family for their work.

===Tennessee Titans===
On July 29, 2011, Hasselbeck signed a three-year, $21 million deal to play for the Tennessee Titans. He was recruited by Mike Reinfeldt, the former vice president of football administration for the Seahawks and current executive vice president and the chief operating officer for the Titans, who was part of the team for four of Hasselbeck&#x27;s five NFC West division championships and Super Bowl appearance. Hasselbeck was targeted by the Titans, who were looking for a veteran quarterback to help lead the team to wins while also mentoring first-round draft pick Jake Locker. The Titans finished 2011 with a 9–7 record, narrowly missing out on the final playoff berth due to losing to the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 9.

Hasselbeck&#x27;s first action in the 2012 season came in Week 1 against the New England Patriots after Locker left early in the game with a shoulder injury. Hasselbeck started the next four weeks while Locker healed, finishing 2–2 in those starts; his victories were at home against Pittsburgh (the first Titans win over Pittsburgh since 2008) and at Buffalo, winning on a last-minute touchdown to Nate Washington. The Titans went 6–10 on the season.

On March 18, 2013, Hasselbeck was released by the Titans.

===Indianapolis Colts===
On March 19, 2013, the Indianapolis Colts signed Hasselbeck to a two-year deal worth up to $7.25 million. He beat Chandler Harnish to win the backup job for the 2013 season. Backing up Andrew Luck, Hasselbeck saw little playing time during his first two years but mentored the budding star. In 2013, Hasselbeck attempted only 12 passes, completing seven for 130 yards and one interception. The following season, Hasselbeck appeared in only four games but led two touchdown drives, one during a blowout loss against the Dallas Cowboys and another during garbage time in the season finale against division rival (and former team) the Tennessee Titans.

====2015 season====

On February 26, 2015, Hasselbeck signed a one-year contract to remain with the Colts.

Hasselbeck made his first start with the Colts on October 4, 2015, filling in for the injured Luck. He led the Colts to an overtime win, defeating the Jacksonville Jaguars, 16–13. After a short week that included Hasselbeck being ill from a bacterial infection and having virtually no practice time, he was once again called upon to play for Luck. He became only the second 40-year-old NFL quarterback to win back-to-back games, when he engineered a 27–20 win over the Houston Texans on October 8, 2015. Over those two starts, he completed 48 of 76 passes for three touchdowns and no turnovers, compiling a 2–0 record as starter.

On November 22, 2015, Hasselbeck started his third game for the Colts, as Luck suffered a kidney injury that would ultimately take him out for the remainder of the season. He passed for 213 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions in a come-from-behind win over the Atlanta Falcons. The win kept Indianapolis in the lead of the AFC South division and improved them to a 5–5 record. The following week, the Colts took on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who were on a four-game winning streak. Hasselbeck led the team to a 25–12 win, passing for 315 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions, which led to a passer rating of 100.8. Hasselbeck led the Colts to a 6–5 record with a 4–0 record as starter at the age of 40, and was the first quarterback in NFL history to do so. However, injuries began to take their toll on the aging quarterback, and Hasselbeck&#x27;s play would begin to deteriorate as the Colts lost three straight games. Hasselbeck won the final start of his career, an 18–12 win over the Miami Dolphins, thanks in large part to Frank Gore&#x27;s two rushing touchdowns. He and backup Charlie Whitehurst were unable to play the season finale due to injury; to take their place the Colts signed Josh Freeman and Ryan Lindley, who subsequently split time in a 30–24 win over the Titans. Overall, Hasselbeck was responsible for five of the Colts&#x27; eight wins over the season, despite only starting eight games.

===Retirement===
On February 28, 2016, it was reported that Hasselbeck would not return to the Colts. On March 9, 2016, Hasselbeck announced his retirement from professional football, and that he would join his brother Tim and become an analyst for ESPN, replacing Mike Ditka on &quot;Sunday NFL Countdown&quot;. Hasselbeck signed a one-day contract with the Seattle Seahawks to officially retire as part of their organization.

Hasselbeck was laid off with other ESPN analysts on July 30, 2023.`

<doc id="1020390" wikidata="Q242918" url="?curid=1020390" title="Lady Mary Grey">
<text>Lady Mary Keyes (née Grey; 20 April 1545 – 20 April 1578) was the youngest daughter of Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, and Frances Brandon, and through her mother had a claim on the crown of England.

==Early life==
Mary Grey, born about 20 April 1545, was the third and youngest daughter of Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, and Lady Frances Brandon, daughter of Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, and Mary Tudor, the younger of the two daughters of King Henry VII and Elizabeth of York. Mary had two sisters, Lady Jane Grey and Lady Katherine Grey.

==Throne claims==
As great-grandchildren of Henry VII, Mary and her sisters were potential heirs to the crown. When King Edward VI died on 6 July 1553, he left a will (approved by John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland) naming Mary&#x27;s eldest sister, Jane, recently married to Northumberland&#x27;s son Guildford Dudley, to succeed to the throne. Some weeks before, on 25 May 1553, Mary Grey, still a young child, had been betrothed to her distant cousin Arthur Grey, 14th Baron Grey de Wilton, whose father was an ally of Northumberland. The attempt to secure a Protestant succession failed, and although King Edward was briefly succeeded by Jane Grey, the Privy Council of England changed sides and proclaimed his half sister, Mary. Northumberland was executed on 22 August 1553. Queen Mary spared Jane&#x27;s life and the lives of Jane&#x27;s husband and father, but after the suppression of the Wyatt rebellion in early 1554, all three were executed, Jane and her husband on 12 February 1554, and Jane&#x27;s father shortly thereafter, on 23 February. After Queen Mary&#x27;s accession Mary Grey&#x27;s betrothal to Arthur Grey was dissolved.

On 1 March 1555, Mary&#x27;s mother, Frances Brandon, took a second husband, Adrian Stokes. When Frances died on November 20, 1559, she left a life estate in most of her property to Stokes, while Mary received only a small inheritance yielding a modest income of £20 a year. However, Queen Elizabeth, who had acceded to the throne in November 1558, appointed Mary Grey as one of her Maids of Honour and granted her a pension of £80.

Since Queen Elizabeth was childless, the two surviving Grey sisters were next in the line of succession under King Henry VIII&#x27;s will, and were not permitted to marry without the Queen&#x27;s permission. In December 1560, however, Katherine Grey secretly married Edward Seymour, the eldest son of the Protector Somerset, incurring the Queen&#x27;s unrelenting displeasure. As the ceremony had been performed by a priest who was never subsequently identified, and the only witness was Seymour&#x27;s sister, Lady Jane Seymour, who died shortly after the marriage, the Queen was able to treat the marriage as though it had never taken place, and on 12 March 1563, she obtained a declaration that the marriage was invalid and that Edward Seymour, Viscount Beauchamp, Katherine&#x27;s eldest son by Seymour, was illegitimate. Both Katherine and her husband were confined to the Tower, and they were later held under house arrest.

==Marriage==
Despite the disastrous consequences of her sister Katherine&#x27;s secret marriage, Mary also married without the Queen&#x27;s permission. On 16 July 1565, while the Queen was absent attending the marriage of her kinsman, Sir Henry Knollys (d. 21 December 1582), and Margaret Cave, the daughter of Sir Ambrose Cave, Mary secretly married the Queen&#x27;s sergeant porter, Thomas Keyes, son of Richard Keyes, esquire, of East Greenwich, Kent, by Agnes Saunders, the daughter of Henry Saunders of Ewell, Surrey. Having learned from her sister&#x27;s experience, Mary took the precaution of having three of her cousins attend as witnesses, her childhood friend, Mary Willoughby, now the wife of Sir Matthew Arundell, and two of the daughters of Lady Stafford. The marriage was an unsuitable one for many reasons. Keyes was from a minor gentry family in Kent, was more than twice Mary&#x27;s age, and was a widower with six or seven children. Moreover, Mary was described by the Spanish ambassador as &#x27;little, crook-backed and very ugly&#x27;, while Keyes stood 6 feet 8 inches tall. Sir William Cecil wrote to Sir Thomas Smith that &#x27;The Sergeant Porter, being the biggest gentleman of this court, has married secretly the Lady Mary Grey, the least of all the court ... The offence is very great&#x27;.

==House arrest==
Mary and her husband never saw each other again. The Queen confined Mary to house arrest with William Hawtrey (d. 1597) at Chequers in Buckinghamshire, where she remained for two years, while Keyes was committed to the Fleet. In August 1567, Mary, still under house arrest, was sent to live with her step-grandmother Katherine, Duchess of Suffolk, whom Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, had married after the death of Mary&#x27;s grandmother Mary Tudor. The Duchess wrote to Cecil expressing shock at the few pitiful household effects with which Mary arrived at her house in the Minories. Mary remained in the Duchess&#x27;s household for almost two years, and is said to have been close to the Duchess&#x27;s two children, Peregrine and Susan Bertie.

On 27 January 1568, at the age of twenty-seven, after suffering years of imprisonment, house arrest, and separation from her husband and two young sons, Katherine Grey died at Cockfield Hall, the house of Sir Owen Hopton in Yoxford, Suffolk. According to De Lisle, it is possible that she had starved herself to death. With Katherine Grey&#x27;s death, Mary was brought to relative prominence as the next heir to Elizabeth under the will of Henry VIII; since Katherine Grey&#x27;s two sons had been declared illegitimate, even the Queen had to take seriously Mary&#x27;s claim to the English throne. In June 1569, Mary was therefore sent to live with Sir Thomas Gresham at his house in Bishopsgate and later at his country house at Osterley. Her stay with the Greshams was an unhappy one, however, as Sir Thomas was now half blind and in constant physical pain, and his wife, Anne, bitterly resented Mary&#x27;s presence in the household.

==Later life==
After enduring years in the Fleet, Mary&#x27;s husband Thomas Keyes was released in 1569, and permitted to return to Kent. However, his health had been broken by the conditions of his imprisonment, and he died shortly before 3 September 1571. Mary begged Elizabeth for permission to bring up her husband&#x27;s orphaned children from his first marriage, but her request was denied, and it was not until May 1572, after Mary had been under strict house arrest for seven years, that the Queen relented sufficiently to allow her to live where she pleased. However, for the time being, Mary had no friends to take her in, and insufficient income to live independently. She continued to reside as an unwelcome guest with the Greshams until Sir Thomas suggested that she be sent to live at Beaumanor in Leicestershire with her late mother&#x27;s second husband, Adrian Stokes, who had recently married Anne Carew, the widow of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton. In 1573 Mary left the Gresham household for good, &#x27;with all her books and rubbish&#x27;, as Sir Thomas put it.

Mary did not stay long at Beaumanor. By February 1573, she was established in a house of her own in London in St Botolph&#x27;s Without Aldgate, and by the end of 1577, she had been rehabilitated to the extent that she was appointed one of the Queen&#x27;s Maids of Honour.

==Death==
In April 1578, while plague was raging in London, Mary became ill and drew up her will. She left her mother&#x27;s jewels to her step-grandmother, the Duchess of Suffolk, gifts of plate to Lady Arundell and to Adrian Stokes&#x27;s wife, and money to her godchild, Mary Merrick, a granddaughter of her late husband, Thomas Keyes. She died three days later on 20 April 1578, her 33rd birthday. The Queen granted her an imposing funeral in Westminster Abbey, with the Duchess of Suffolk&#x27;s daughter Susan Bertie, now Countess of Kent, as chief mourner. She was buried in her mother&#x27;s tomb in the Abbey, where her grave is still unmarked.

In spite of the intrigues involving her sisters, it does not appear that Mary Grey ever made a serious claim to the throne. After her death, according to the terms of Henry VIII&#x27;s will, the chief claimant became Margaret Stanley, Countess of Derby, the only surviving child of Eleanor Brandon, second daughter of Henry VIII&#x27;s younger sister, Mary Tudor.

== Cultural depictions ==
Mary is the main character of Philippa Gregory&#x27;s &quot;The Last Tudor&quot; (2016), the final instalment in &quot;The Plantagenet and Tudor Novels&quot;.

Leanda de Lisle&#x27;s biography &quot;The Sisters Who Would Be Queen: Mary, Katherine, and Lady Jane Grey; A Tudor Tragedy&quot; was published in 2009 and was a NY Times bestseller.

<text>Paine Wingate (May 14, 1739March 7, 1838) was an American preacher, farmer, and statesman from Stratham, New Hampshire. He served New Hampshire in the Continental Congress and both the United States Senate and House of Representatives.

==Early life, education, ministry, and farming==

Wingate was born the sixth of twelve children, in Amesbury, Province of Massachusetts Bay, in 1739. His father (also Paine) was a minister there. He graduated from Harvard College in 1759.

Wingate was ordained a minister of the Congregational Church in 1763. He became a pastor in Hampton Falls, New Hampshire. In 1776, Wingate gave up his ministry and moved to Stratham, where he took up farming.

==Political career==

Wingate was elected to several terms in the New Hampshire House of Representatives, and was a delegate to their state constitutional convention in 1781.

In 1788, he served as a delegate to the Continental Congress. Despite his own background as a preacher, Wingate successfully proposed that the salaries for the two chaplains of the Continental Congress be cut by 25% probably due at least partly to the Confederation&#x27;s untenable financial problems. Wingate was a strong advocate for ratification of the United States Constitution, writing as follows in March 1788:

[T]hose who are well-wishers to their country, and best know the situation we are in, are most sensible of the necessity of its adoption, and great pains are taken to obtain the end.

New Hampshire appointed him to the first United States Senate, in which he served from 4 March 1789 until 3 March 1793. He was then elected to the United States House of Representatives, where he served from 4 March 1793 to 3 March 1795.

Between 1789 and 1794, the U.S. Senate&#x27;s deliberations were conducted in secret, which Wingate supported: &quot;How would all the little domestic transactions of even the best regulated family appear if exposed to the world; and may not this apply to a larger body?&quot; He believed that secrecy promoted respect for the Senate: &quot;to be a little more out of view would conduce to its respectability in the opinion of the country.&quot;

While in the Senate, Wingate served on the committee that drafted the Judiciary Act of 1789, which set up the federal court system. He was disappointed that the bill &quot;will not extend to a tenth part of the causes which might by the Constitution have come into the federal court&quot;. The remaining nine-tenths of cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States were left for the state courts to decide. Wingate voted against the bill, but it passed.

==Judicial career, retirement, and longevity==

After his national service, Wingate succeeded Daniel Newcomb as an associate justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court, serving from 1798 to 1808. Once he made up his mind, a change of mind was unlikely. According to Theophilus Parsons, &quot;it was of great importance, that your Judge Wingate should form a correct opinion before he pronounces it—for after that, law, reason, and authority will be unavailing.&quot;

With the death of James Madison in 1836, Wingate drew some attention for surviving so long. 
Before he died at age 98 in 1838, Wingate was one of two surviving delegates to the Continental Congress (along with John Armstrong Jr.), and the last surviving member of the first United States Congress. For several years he had been the oldest graduate of Harvard. Wingate&#x27;s wife, Eunice, was the sister of United States Secretary of State Timothy Pickering, and she died in 1843, having passed the century mark. The Wingates are buried in the Stratham Cemetery.

<text>Playas is a census-designated place (CDP) in Hidalgo County, New Mexico, United States. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 74.

==History==
It is a former company town, named after a nearby former settlement along the Southern Pacific Railroad. It was developed by the Phelps Dodge Corporation in the 1970s for employees of its then-new Hidalgo Copper Smelter, located south of the development. Over 270 rental homes, six apartment buildings, a post office, grocery/dry goods store (Phelps Dodge Mercantile), medical clinic with heliport, a bowling alley (&quot;Copper Pins&quot;), grill, a rodeo arena, horse stables, a fitness center, a shooting range, an airstrip and a swimming pool were built for the community, which even has its own ZIP Code (88009). At its peak, the town had about 1,100 residents and included two churches built on land leased from the mining company.

The smelter, which included state of the art environmental controls, a power plant and sulfuric acid plants, was closed by the company as part of a move towards new processing technologies for processing copper concentrates. Declining copper prices accelerated the closure in 1999; all of its residents were required to leave within a year, though a skeleton crew of about a dozen employees remained in the area. Before completion of razing the plant and reclamation of the site, the smelter, about north of the border with Mexico, was nicknamed &quot;La Estrella del Norte&quot; by illegal migrants using its lights as a beacon for crossing into the country.

Four years later, New Mexico Tech agreed to purchase the town and the surrounding for $5 million, using Department of Homeland Security funds secured by Senator Pete Domenici. The town is now a training and research facility (the Playas Training and Research Center, operated by New Mexico Tech&#x27;s EMRTC) for the university&#x27;s first responders, counter-terrorism, and Air Force programs, supported by tens of millions of dollars in federal funds.

==Geography==
Playas is located in eastern Hidalgo County and is bordered to the east by Grant County. It is at the south terminus of New Mexico State Road 113 south of New Mexico State Road 9, east-southeast of Animas, west of Hachita and south of Lordsburg, the Hidalgo County seat. It sits at the northwestern base of the Little Hatchet Mountains, on the east side of the Playas Valley.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Playas CDP has an area of , all land.

<text>Amboseli National Park, formerly Maasai Amboseli Game Reserve, is a national park in Loitoktok District in Kajiado County, Kenya. It is in size at the core of an ecosystem that spreads across the Kenya-Tanzania border. It harbours 400 species of birds including water birds like pelicans, kingfishers, crakes, hamerkop and 47 raptor species. The local people are mainly Maasai.

The park protects two of the five main swamps and includes a dried-up Pleistocene lake and semiarid vegetation.

==History==

In 1883, Jeremy Thompson was the first European to penetrate the feared Maasai region known as &quot;Empusel&quot; (meaning &#x27;salty, dusty place&#x27; in Maa). He, too, was astonished by the fantastic array of wildlife and the contrast between the arid areas of the dry lake bed and the oasis of the swamps, a contrast that persists today.

Amboseli was set aside as the Southern Reserve for the Maasai in 1906 but returned to local control as a game reserve in 1948. Gazetted a national park in 1974 to protect the core of this unique ecosystem, it was declared a UNESCO site in 1991. The park earned $3.5 m (€2.9 m) in 2005. On 29 September 2005, Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki declared that control of the park should pass from the Kenya Wildlife Service to the Olkejuado County Council and the Maasai tribe. Some observers saw this as a political favour in advance of a vote on a new Kenyan constitution; legal challenges are currently in court. The degazetting would divert park admission fees directly to the county council with shared benefits to the Maasai immediately surrounding the park.

==Wildlife==
Amboseli National Park was home to Echo, the most researched elephant in the world, and the subject of many books and documentaries, followed for almost four decades by American conservationist Cynthia Moss. Echo died in 2009 when she was about 60 years old.

Amboseli National Park is home to African bush elephant, Cape buffalo, impala, lion, cheetah, spotted hyena, Masai giraffe, Grant&#x27;s zebra, and blue wildebeest. A host of large and small birds occur too.

<text>Banco Real was a Brazilian bank, owned by Spain&#x27;s Banco Santander. ABN AMRO had owned the bank but in October 2007, a consortium led by Royal Bank of Scotland that also included Banco Santander and Belgium&#x27;s Fortis, acquired ABN AMRO and proceeded to dismember it. Banco Santander acquired Banco Real from the consortium, together with some other ABN AMRO operations in Italy, particularly Banca Antonveneta. Banco Santander already owned Banco Santander Brazil, which incorporated Banco do Estado de São Paulo (Banespa). Combining its existing operations with Banco Real will make Banco Santander Brazil the third largest private bank in the country, after Banco Bradesco and Itaú.

Santander has named the CEO of Banco Real to be the head of the combined group in Brazil, with the charge to unify the operations; Santander transferred the CEO of Banco Santander Brazil to Madrid, and then to New York. He is now CEO of Santander&#x27;s US subsidiary, Sovereign Bank.

== History ==

Banco Real traces its ancestry back to Banco da Lavoura de Minas Gerais, which was founded in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais in 1925. On 1 March 1971, Banco da Lavoura moved its head office from Belo Horizonte to São Paulo and the bank assumed its current name, Banco Real S.A. In 1973 Banco Real began to expand its operations abroad, creating Grupo Real del Paraguay (The Real Group of Paraguay), composed of a commercial bank and three other businesses. In the following year, Banco Real opened a branch on the Brazilian island of Fernando de Noronha and acquired Banco de Minas Gerais, which operated 133 branches at that time.

On its 50th anniversary, in 1975, Banco Real operated 512 branches in Brazil, the biggest branch network in the country, in addition to 12 associated businesses including Companhia Real de Investimentos, then the number one in the domestic ranking. It also had 10 units located abroad - in Bogotá, Panama, Grand Cayman, Nassau, Curaçao, Los Angeles, New York, Toronto, and Mexico City.

In mid-1998, Banco ABN AMRO SA - the Brazilian subsidiary of ABN AMRO Bank - acquired Banco Real. ABN AMRO had begun its activities in Brazil in 1917 as Banco Holandés da America do Sul, when it opened two branches: one in Santos, São Paulo (state) and another in Rio de Janeiro. In 1945, Banco Holandés opened its first branch in São Paulo, and other branches followed. Then in 1963, the bank acquired 50% of the finance company, Aymoré de Crédito, Financiamento e Investimento. Banco Holandés acquired the remainder of the shares in 1970.

In 1993, Banco ABN AMRO moved its headquarters to São Paulo. In November 1998 and November 2001 ABN AMRO-Banco Real acquired two Brazilian state-owned banks, Banco do Estado de Pernambuco S.A. (Bandepe) in Recife and Banco do Estado do Paraiba (Paraiban). Then in October 2003, Banco Real acquired Banco Sudameris from Banca Intesa; in 1998, Sudameris had bought Banco América do Sul, which Japanese immigrants had founded in 1944.

<doc id="1020426" wikidata="Q3536721" url="?curid=1020426" title="Treaty with Tunis (1797)">
<text>The Treaty with Tunis was signed on August 28, 1797, between the United States of America and the Barbary State of Tunis. As the treaty provided in Article One:

:&quot;There shall be a perpetual and constant peace between the United States of America and the magnificent Pasha, Bey of Tunis, and also a permanent friendship, which shall more and more increase.&quot;

The treaty is notable because of its religious language in the opening statement, namely recognizing the President of the United States of America as &quot;the most distinguished among those &quot;who profess the religion of the Messiah&quot;, of whom may the end be happy.&quot; Because of the presence of this clause, W.C. Anderson makes the argument that Christianity is adopted by this treaty.

The treaty provided protection to Americans at a cost higher than the Treaty of Tripoli imposed. 

The Treaty of Tunis was not only notable for the use of religious language in the opening statement, but it was also a treaty where the President of the United States got involved in the negotiation even after Senate action. The Treaty of Tunis had alterations on three of the articles. Articles that were altered are 11, 12, and 14. While the resolution of the Senate related only to Article 14, it was considered by the Secretary of State (Pickering) that Articles 11 and 12 were also objectionable, and changes in them were proposed, an interesting and early example of the control of treaty negotiations by the President, even after Senate action.

Article 14 in the original document read &quot;The citizens of the United States of America who shall transport into the Kingdom of Tunis the merchandise of their country in the vessels of their nation, shall pay three per cent duty. Such as may be laden by such citizens under a foreign flag, coming from the United States or elsewhere, shall pay ten per cent duty. Such as may be laden by foreigners on board of American vessels coming from any place whatever, shall also pay ten per cent duty. If any Tunisian merchant wishes to carry merchandise of his country under any flag whatever, into the United States of America, and on his own account, he shall pay three percent.&quot; The percentage of duties (taxes) was changed from 10% to 6%. It now reads &quot;A Tunisian merchant who may go to America with a vessel of any nation soever, loaded with merchandise which is the production of the kingdom of Tunis, shall pay duty (small as it is) like the merchants of other nations; and the American merchants shall equally pay, for the merchandise of their country which they may bring to Tunis under their flag, the same duty as the Tunisians pay in America. But if an American merchant, or a merchant of any other nation, shall bring American merchandise under any other flag, he shall pay six I per cent duty. In like manner, if a foreign merchant shall bring the merchandise of his country under the American flag, [null he shall also pay six] per cent.&quot;

Article 11 read in the original treaty &quot;When a vessel of war of one of the parties shall enter a port of the other, she shall be saluted by the forts and shall return the salute gun for gun, neither more nor less. But there shall be given by the parties, respectively, a barrel of powder for every gun which shall be required for the salute.&quot; The altered version states this article as a request. It now reads &quot;When a vessel of war of the United States of America shall enter the port of Tunis, and the Consul shall request that the castle may salute her, the number of guns shall be fired which he may request; and if the said Consul does not want a salute, there shall be no question about it. But in case he shall desire the salute, and the number of guns shall be fired which he may have requested, they shall be counted and returned by the vessel in as many barrels of cannon powder. The same shall be done with respect to the Tunisian corsairs when they shall enter any port of the United States.&quot;

Article 12 the only alteration was in the last sentence. The sentence read &quot;The subjects or citizens of the two nations shall be protected by the government or commandants of the places where they may be, and not by the other authorities of the country. In case the Government of Tunis shall have need of an American vessel for its service, the captain shall freight his vessel, and the freight shall be paid to him according to the agreement of the Government, without his being allowed to refuse.&quot; The only change was in the wording and a phrase was added. It now reads &quot;The subjects of the two contracting powers shall be under the protection of the Prince and under the jurisdiction of the chief of the place where they may be, and no other persons shall have authority over them. If the commandant of the place does not conduct himself agreeably to justice, a representation of it shall be made to us In case the Government shall have need of an American merchant vessel, it shall cause it to be freighted, and then a suitable freight shall be paid to the captain, agreeably to the intention of the Government, and the captain shall not refuse it.&quot;

<doc id="1020440" wikidata="Q7756507" url="?curid=1020440" title="The Pembroke Hill School">
<text>The Pembroke Hill School (usually referred to as Pembroke Hill) is a secular, coeducational, independent preparatory school for about 1,200 students in early years (age 2 years) through high school, separated into four sections: early years-prekindergarten (early childhood school), kindergarten-5th grade (lower school), 6th-8th grade (middle school), and 9th-12th grade (upper school). It is located on two campuses in the Country Club District of Kansas City, Missouri, near the Country Club Plaza.

== History ==
Vassie James Ward Hill, a Kansas Citian and Vassar College graduate born in 1875, gained a fortune upon the death of her first husband, Hugh Ward, a son of pioneer Seth E. Ward. She then married Albert Ross Hill, formerly president of the University of Missouri.

At the time, Kansas Citians of means commonly sent their children to boarding schools on the east coast. Hill did not want to send her daughter and three sons &quot;back east.&quot; She believed they should be able to have an equal education in Kansas City. This led her to research the workings of college preparatory schools, especially the progressive education of the Country Day School movement.

In 1910, using funds from 12 Kansas City businessmen, Hill founded the Country Day School for boys, which accepted both day students and boarders (boarding ceased in the 1950s). The initial enrollment was 20 students but grew to 52 within three years. It sat on what is today Pembroke Hill&#x27;s Ward Parkway Campus, to the west of the Country Club Plaza at the intersection of State Line Road.

Three years later, Ruth Carr Patton and Frances Matteson Bowersock joined with Hill to found the Sunset Hill School, named after Hill&#x27;s favorite area on the Vassar campus. Sunset Hill was located on what today is Pembroke Hill&#x27;s Wornall Campus, south of the Country Club Plaza. At the time of its founding, the campus overlooked the Kansas City Country Club (today Loose Park). It also includes a portion of the battlefield from the Battle of Westport.

In 1925, some educators and students left the Country Day School to form the Pembroke School for boys. Their endeavor failed amidst the Great Depression, and the two schools re-merged in 1933 to form the Pembroke-Country Day School, keeping the Country Day School&#x27;s original campus. It usually was referred to as &quot;Pem Day.&quot;

== Merger ==
From the start, Sunset Hill and Pembroke-Country Day worked cooperatively. Often, teachers taught at both schools. For generations, many Kansas City families would send their boys to Pem Day and their girls to Sunset Hill. School activities, such as plays and dances, often were combined, and Sunset Hill girls were cheerleaders for Pem Day&#x27;s athletic teams. In 1963, the schools began coeducational classes in upper-level math, science, and languages.

In the early 1980s, the two schools began merger discussions, ultimately merging in 1984 to become the Pembroke Hill School. The class of 1985 elected to have separate graduation ceremonies. True coeducation began the next year. The former Sunset Hill campus became home to the primary and lower schools (then preschool through 6th grade), and the former Pem Day campus became home to the middle and upper schools (then 7th grade through 12th grade).

== Events ==
In 1988, &quot;Kansas City Magazine&quot; notoriously published an article titled &quot;A High School on Easy Street&quot;, criticizing Pembroke Hill&#x27;s students&#x27; allegedly &quot;advantaged way of life.&quot;

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Pembroke Hill completed a $50 million capital improvement project, which renovated both campuses. The Ward Parkway campus gained a new middle school building, Boocock Middle School (which now serves 6th-8th grades), a new upper school building, Jordan Hall, a new arts center, and a new library, the James M. Kemper Sr. Library.

In 1997, 1998, and 1999, Pembroke Hill&#x27;s boys&#x27; basketball team won the Missouri Class 2A state title. In 2000, however, in a nationally publicized scandal, the Missouri State High School Activities Association stripped Pembroke of the titles and placed the school on probation after the &quot;Kansas City Star&quot; revealed that promoter and AAU coach Myron Piggie had remitted cash payments to two of the school&#x27;s star players, Kareem Rush and his brother JaRon Rush, to play on his &quot;amateur&quot; basketball team. Piggie admitted to paying JaRon Rush $17,000 and Kareem Rush $2,300, after which the brothers &quot;submitted false and fraudulent Student Athlete Statements to the universities where they were to play intercollegiate basketball&quot;, certifying that they had not been paid to play basketball. As a result, the University of California, Los Angeles and the University of Missouri found themselves subject to NCAA penalties for awarding athletic scholarships to non-amateurs. On Piggie&#x27;s 2002 appeal from his prison sentence and restitution for conspiracy to commit wire fraud, mail fraud, and tax evasion, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit found that Pembroke Hill had &quot;sustained a loss of $10,733.89 in investigative costs and forfeiture of property as a result of&quot; Piggie&#x27;s conspiracy.

In the Class of 2013, 29 seniors were recognized by National Merit. Of these 29, 21 or 21% of the class, are National Merit Semifinalists. Eight of the students are Commended Students. This number represents the second highest percentage in Missouri.

On September 7, 2017, Dr. Steve Bellis announced that the 2018–2019 school year would be his last as Head of School. Dr. Bellis served as the Headmaster of the Ward Parkway Campus of The Pembroke Hill School for 16 years. Upon his departure, Pembroke welcomed in Brad Shelley as the newest Head of School. Shelley was previously serving as associate headmaster at the McDonogh School, in Baltimore, MD.

According to &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot;, students at Pembroke Hill have &quot;faced several incidents of anti-Semitic behavior at Pembroke.&quot; On the 2021 International Holocaust Remembrance Day in January, a swastika was discovered on a student&#x27;s desk. The symbol was accompanied by an offensive reference toward members of the school&#x27;s LGBT community. The incident was covered by citywide media and contextualized by prior incidents where one student raised his arm in a Nazi salute while calling a Jewish student an offensive name, and swastikas were painted on a Jewish student&#x27;s locker. Several Jewish parents spoke to &quot;The Star&quot; on the condition of anonymity, fearing reprisals against their children. Following the incident, officials initiated a hiring search for the newly created position of Director of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.

In April 2021, months after a swastika was discovered in a classroom, school officials found &quot;KKK&quot; written on the side of a desk. School officials hired consulting firm Sophic Solutions to &quot;hold community conversations, complete a diversity and equity audit, and then present recommendations.&quot;

== Accreditation ==
Pembroke Hill is accredited by the Independent Schools Association of the Central States (ISACS) and the National Association for the Education of Young Children. The school is a member of the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS).

== Athletics ==
Pembroke Hill colors are blue and red, its teams are known as the Raiders, and its mascot resembles a Viking raider. Pembroke is a member of the Missouri State High School Activities Association.

=== Championships ===
In 2006 and 2007, the girls&#x27; basketball team won the Missouri Class 3 state title. The Raiders lacrosse team won the 2009 Division II state championship, beating Eureka High School 6-5 after trailing 5–2 in the 4th quarter. The boys&#x27; tennis team also won the 2009 Division II state championship, sweeping all teams up until the final, where Pembroke won 5–2. In 2017, the Raiders won state tennis tournaments in both the boys and girls class 1 sections. The boys defeated The Saint Louis Priory School 5–2 in the finals, while the girls upended the defending champion John Burroughs School 5–4 in October.

In 2021, boys&#x27; golf member Ryan Lee won the Missouri golf championships for the second time in his high school career. Lee set a state record for the lowest two day score, firing a total score of 133 (67,66).

=== Rivalries ===
Pembroke Hill has cross-state athletic rivalries with two schools located in suburbs of St. Louis: MICDS and John Burroughs School, both in Ladue, Missouri. The Raiders&#x27; biggest rivals in the Kansas City area are fellow private schools in The Barstow School and Rockhurst High School. Pembroke Hill also has a rivalry in football with St. Pius X located in the northland of Kansas City.

<text>Sunthorn Kongsompong (, , ; 1 August 1931 – 2 August 1999) was the &quot;de facto&quot; head of government of Thailand from 1991 to 1992, after a military coup d&#x27;etat led by Sunthorn and General Suchinda Kraprayoon deposed the government of Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan on 23 February 1991. The generals accused Chatichai of corruption, and established the National Peacekeeping Council (NPKC) as an interim administration, with Sunthorn as chairman. Anand Panyarachun was appointed prime minister in March 1991, but the administration of the country was also executed by the NPKC.

Sunthorn left the political office following the May 1992 constitution promulgation, which prohibited members of the military from executing the premier&#x27;s office.

His son was Apirat Kongsompong, who from 2018 to 2020 was Commander in Chief of the Royal Thai Army.

<doc id="1020448" wikidata="Q1817380" url="?curid=1020448" title="Samburu National Reserve">
<text>Samburu National Reserve is a game reserve on the banks of the Ewaso Ng&#x27;iro river in Kenya. It is in size and is from Nairobi. It ranges in elevation from . Geographically and administratively, it is part of Samburu County.

In the middle of the reserve, the Ewaso Ng&#x27;iro flows through doum palm groves and thick riverine forests. It provides water to the wildlife in the reserve.

Samburu National Reserve was one of the two areas in which conservationists George and Joy Adamson raised Elsa the Lioness, made famous in the best-selling book and award-winning movie &quot;Born Free&quot;. The Elephant Watch Camp, of which Saba Douglas-Hamilton is director, lies within the park.
Samburu National Reserve is also the home of Kamunyak, a lioness famous for adopting oryx calves.

==Habitat==

Samburu National Reserve contains two mountains, Koitogor and Ololokwe, the Ewaso Ng&#x27;iro river (meaning &quot;brown water&quot;) runs through the reserve and the mixture of acacia, riverine forest, thorn trees and grassland vegetation. The Ewaso Ng&#x27;iro flows from the Kenyan highlands and empties into the Lorian Swamp. The natural serenity that is evident here is due to its distance from industry and the inaccessibility the reserve had for many years.

==Wildlife==

There is a wide variety of animal and bird life seen at Samburu National Reserve. Several large game species common to Kenya&#x27;s northern plains can be found in abundance here, including the following dry-country fauna: gerenuk, Grevy&#x27;s zebra, oryx and reticulated giraffe. All three big cats, the lion, cheetah and African leopard, as well as elephant, Cape buffalo and hippopotamus.

Other mammals frequently seen in the park include olive baboon, warthogs, Grant&#x27;s gazelle, Kirk&#x27;s dik-dik, impala, and waterbuck. A black rhinoceros population has been re-introduced into the park after an absence of 25 years after heavy poaching.

There are over 350 species of bird. These include grey-headed kingfisher, sunbirds, bee-eaters, Marabou stork, tawny eagle, Verreaux&#x27;s eagle, bateleur, vulturine guineafowl, yellow-necked spurfowl, lilac-breasted roller, secretary bird, superb starling, northern red-billed hornbill, yellow-billed hornbill, and various vultures including the palm-nut vulture.

The Ewaso Ng&#x27;iro river contains large numbers of Nile crocodile basks.

From 2005, the protected area is considered part of a Lion Conservation Unit.

<doc id="1020454" wikidata="Q3137787" url="?curid=1020454" title="Baseball (TV series)">
<text>Baseball is a 1994 American television documentary miniseries created by documentary filmmaker Ken Burns about the history of the sport of baseball.

First broadcast on PBS, this was Burns&#x27; ninth documentary and won the 1995 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Informational Series. It was funded in part by the National Endowment for the Humanities.

== Format ==
&quot;Baseball&quot;, like Burns&#x27; previous documentaries such as &quot;The Civil War&quot;, used archived pictures and film footage mixed with interviews for visual presentation. Actors provide voice over reciting written work (letters, speeches, etc.) over pictures and video. Episodes are interspersed with the music of the times taken from previous Burns series, original played music, or recordings ranging from Louis Armstrong to Elvis Presley. John Chancellor, anchor of the &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; from 1970 to 1982, narrated the series.

The documentary is divided into nine parts, each referred to as an &quot;inning&quot;, following the division of a baseball game. Each &quot;inning&quot; reviews an era, mentioning notable moments in the world and in America itself, and begins with a brief prologue acting as an insight to the game during that era. The prologue ends with the playing of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; just as a real baseball game would begin, being performed usually by a brass band, with a couple of exceptions: The 1920s, where the rendition is played by a piano of the era, and the 1960s, where the rendition is the version played by Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock. In some &quot;inning&quot; episodes, a period version of the baseball anthem &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; is used. Roughly halfway through each &quot;inning&quot;, a title card appears, reading &quot;Bottom of&quot; the inning, dividing the episode into two parts in a manner also recalling the game; in the seventh &quot;inning&quot;, the &quot;Bottom&quot; is immediately preceded by the &quot;seventh-inning stretch&quot;. Within these halves of the episode, there are smaller segments also highlighted with a simple title card that often highlights various important parts of baseball&#x27;s history. These often include player highlights, important or eventful games, or the creation of various brands that are now well known throughout baseball such as Louisville Slugger.

== The Nine Innings ==
; 1st Inning – Our Game: This inning serves as an introduction to the game and the series, and covers baseball&#x27;s origins and the game as it evolved prior to the 20th century, to where professional leagues make the game grow in popularity, and notoriety, throughout the growing nation.
Original airdate: Sunday, September 18, 1994.
; 2nd Inning – Something Like A War: This inning covers approximately 1900 to 1910, and includes the formation of the American League and its integration with the National League, culminating in the establishment of the World Series, as well as the emergence of the game&#x27;s first great stars, Christy Mathewson and Honus Wagner, who help to clean up baseball&#x27;s previously bad reputation as a rowdy, brawling game. Ty Cobb is discussed in-depth (the title of this inning comes from one of his many quotes). Many of the quotes used in this inning and of the other early innings are taken from Lawrence S. Ritter&#x27;s best selling &quot;The Glory of Their Times&quot;.
Original airdate: Monday, September 19, 1994.
; 3rd Inning – The Faith of Fifty Million People: This inning covers approximately 1910 to 1920, and follows baseball as it goes through its greatest era of popularity yet. It heavily focuses on the Black Sox Scandal, taking its title from a line in the novel &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;. The line refers to how easy it was for gamblers to tamper with the faith people put in the game&#x27;s fairness.
Original airdate: Tuesday, September 20, 1994.
; 4th Inning – A National Heirloom: This inning covers approximately 1920 to 1930, and focuses on baseball&#x27;s recovery from the Black Sox Scandal, giving much of the credit to the increase in power hitting throughout the game, led by its savior Babe Ruth. The title comes from what sports writers called Ruth. During an interview given to MLB Network during the series&#x27; re-airing in 2009, Burns stated he originally wanted to title the 4th Inning &quot;That Big Son-of-a-Bitch&quot;, a name given to Ruth by many in the game during that era. However, the companion book uses this title.
Original airdate: Wednesday, September 21, 1994.
; 5th Inning – Shadow Ball: This inning covers approximately 1930 to 1940. A great deal of this inning covers the Negro leagues, and the great players and organizers who were excluded from the Major Leagues. Also, the episode deals with organized Baseball&#x27;s response to the Great Depression, as well as the sad decline of its most iconic star, Babe Ruth, and the emergence of new heroes, like Bob Feller, Hank Greenberg, and Joe DiMaggio. 
Original airdate: Thursday, September 22, 1994.
; 6th Inning – The National Pastime: This inning covers approximately 1940 to 1950. The emphasis here is on baseball finally becoming what it had always purported to be: a national game, as African-Americans are finally permitted to play Major League Baseball, led by Jackie Robinson. This inning also looks at how the game responded to World War II and how the game became, more than ever, a symbol of America itself. 
Original airdate: Sunday, September 25, 1994.
; 7th Inning – The Capital of Baseball: This inning covers approximately 1950 to 1960. Burns emphasizes the greatness of the three teams based in New York (the New York Yankees, the New York Giants, and Brooklyn Dodgers). This inning also covers one of baseball&#x27;s golden eras and how America&#x27;s own changes, such as leaving urban areas and heading west to more open suburbs, caused baseball to follow.
Original airdate: Monday, September 26, 1994.
; 8th Inning – A Whole New Ballgame: This inning covers approximately 1960 to 1970. As the nation underwent turbulent changes, baseball was not immune, as Babe Ruth&#x27;s beloved record of 60 home runs in a season is threatened by a sullen and complicated player, Roger Maris, and for the first time in decades, pitchers, led by stars Sandy Koufax and Bob Gibson, dominate the game. The loss of home run power and betrayal to the game&#x27;s past, combined with the meteoric rise of football, cause many to turn their back on baseball. Expansion and labor are major topics in this inning.
Original airdate: Tuesday, September 27, 1994.
; 9th Inning – Home: The final inning covers approximately 1970 to 1992. While baseball survived the 1960s, the changes were not over, and in some ways, its most bitter conflicts were just beginning. Major topics included the formation of the players&#x27; union, the owners&#x27; collusion, free agency, and drugs, as well as gambling, scandals. However, the game manages to win back the hearts of many with such moments as the excitement of the 1975 World Series and the return of the New York Yankees to dominance. The documentary ends with an ironic boast baseball (and indirectly the World Series) had survived wars, depressions, pandemics, and numbers of scandals and thus could never be stopped. The 1994 World Series, the series to be played the year the film first aired on PBS, was cancelled due to a players&#x27; strike. This marked the first time since 1904 the World Series was not played. 
Original airdate: Wednesday, September 28, 1994.
;10th Inning – (Episode 1, Top of the 10th)
: This two part, four hour encore presentation covers stories from 1992 to 2010. The first part discusses the labor stoppage of the 1990s, which disgruntles fans as well as Mark McGwire&#x27;s and Sammy Sosa&#x27;s pursuit of the home run record in 1998.
Original airdate: Tuesday, September 28, 2010.
;10th Inning – (Episode 2, Bottom of the 10th)
: This two part, four hour encore presentation covers stories from 1992 to 2010. The second part spends a fair amount of time covering the steroid scandal in the 2000s, as well as the role baseball played in helping the nation heal from 9/11, and how the game, even in the midst of America&#x27;s greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression continue to become as popular as it has ever been.
Original airdate: Wednesday, September 29, 2010.

== Reception ==
Critics and audiences praised the series but criticized its length and detail. At 18.5 hours, the runtime of the series is one of Burns&#x27; longest.

The first episode more than doubled PBS&#x27;s average primetime ratings with a Nielsen rating of 5.1 and an audience share of 7% but did not do as well as &quot;Civil War&quot; 9 rating and 13% share.

==&quot;The Tenth Inning&quot;==
At a preview screening of his 2007 documentary &quot;The War&quot;, Ken Burns spoke of the possibility of coming up to date in the history of baseball with a &quot;Tenth Inning&quot; episode of his &quot;Baseball&quot; documentary. This was officially confirmed by Burns in an MLB Network interview, and later to the NBC LA web site during the winter Television Critics Association media tour January 8. It aired in Fall 2010 and covered the period from 1992 through the 2009 season.

During in-game coverage of a Texas Rangers game during July 2009, Burns was interviewed, and said &quot;The Tenth Inning&quot; would air &quot;about a year from now&quot; on PBS. He also stated that it would be two two-hour programs. One would be the &quot;top of the 10th&quot;, and the other would be the &quot;bottom of the 10th&quot;. He also said that &quot;the good Lord willing&quot;, there would be an 11th Inning and a 12th Inning in the future. His aim was to air the 11th Inning in 2020 opening with Armando Galarraga. Burns also said that &quot;Baseball&quot; is the only one of his documentaries to which he was ever interested in doing a &quot;sequel&quot; (of sorts).

&quot;The Tenth Inning&quot; premiered on PBS on September 28, 2010, narrated by Keith David. The Inning was broken into two halves airing on September 28 and 29, 2010. The documentary discussed the major stories that covered the period from 1992 through the 2009 season. It focuses heavily on examining the Steroid era and the many players who got caught up in it, but also discusses other major issues in baseball, such as how baseball rebounded from the 1994 strike largely thanks to the selflessness of Cal Ripken Jr. and other players, the return to prominence of the Yankees, the influence of international players (specifically Dominican and Japanese players) on the game, and the drama of the 2003 and 2004 American League Championship Series, which helped baseball, even in the midst of America&#x27;s greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression, become as popular as it has ever been.

=== Critical reception ===
David Hinckley of &quot;New York Daily News&quot; wrote, &quot;Ken Burns hits another one out of the park.&quot;

== 2020 Re-airing ==
The complete series (including the &quot;Tenth Inning&quot; segments) was streamed online for free by PBS during the shortened 2020 Major League Baseball season, starting on what would have been the regular opening day for the season, hoping to &quot;fill the void&quot; left by the lack of baseball. In a video message posted the Sunday prior, Ken Burns confirmed the following: &quot;As we hunker down in the days ahead, it’s important that we find things that bring us together and show us our common humanity. That’s why, in the absence of many of our favorite sports, I’ve asked PBS — that’s the Public Broadcasting Service — to stream my film about America’s pastime, ‘Baseball.’ Stay healthy and let’s look after each other. Play ball.&quot;

<text>Agde (; ) is a commune in the southern French department of Hérault. It is the Mediterranean port of the Canal du Midi. It is situated on an ancient basalt volcano, hence the name &quot;Black Pearl of the Mediterranée&quot;.

==Location==
Agde is located on the Hérault river, from the Mediterranean Sea, and from Paris. The Canal du Midi connects to the Hérault river at the Agde Round Lock (&quot;L&#x27;Écluse Ronde d&#x27;Agde&quot;) just north of Agde, and the Hérault flows into the Mediterranean at 
. Agde station has high-speed rail direct connections northbound to Paris, Lille, Geneva, southbound to Perpignan as well as Spain. Agde has regional services to Narbonne, Montpellier, Nimes and Avignon.

==History==


===Foundation===

Agde (525 BCE) is one of the oldest towns in France, after Béziers (575 BCE) and Marseille (600 BCE).
Agde (&quot;Agathe Tyche&quot;, &quot;good fortune&quot;) was a 5th-century BCE Greek colony settled by Phocaeans from Massilia. 

2,500 years ago, the Hérault river had three arms : &quot;grau de Vias&quot;, &quot;grau d&#x27;Agde&quot;, &quot;grau d&#x27;Ambonne&quot;; a delta was formed in the middle of , and the eastern arm was leading to the Bagnas pond (occitan name &quot;Banhas&quot;), which was largely drained in the Middle Ages when mills were built with constant flow on the main arm (the bishop&#x27;s mill still remains).

The Greek name was Agathe (). The symbol of the city, the bronze &quot;Ephebe of Agde&quot;, of the 4th century BCE, recovered from the fluvial sands of the Hérault, was joined in December 2001 by two Early Imperial Roman bronzes, of a child and of Eros, which had possibly been on their way to a villa in Gallia Narbonensis when they were lost in a shipwreck.

===Development===

The inlet in the Hérault river, Grau d&#x27;Agde, became from the Antique to the Eighteenth century period the most important port in this occitanian region of the Mediterranée for trade. 

From the beginning of the fifth century (until the French Revolution), the city of Agde developed in the upstream area that was not subject to flooding and was the seat of a bishopric. But &quot;It was subjugated by the Roman Empire, the Visigoths [from Italy] and the Saracens [from Spain] before becoming definitively Christian in 759.&quot; 

Around the beginning of the 13th century, the town was administered by consuls, a forerunner of modern municipalities. Development took place on the main rock, sheltered from flooding, and urban districts appeared, with the concept of the urban island, named after the person who paid the highest tax to the king and the bishopric. The town was divided into two parts: the part on the rock and the part around the rock, where farmland was divided into hamlets of properties around churches.

The fortifications appeared in the 12th century around the rock, in the 14th century extended around the town; During the French Revolution of 1848 the fortifications were demolished except for the small part next to the current Tourist Office. 

At the end of the 16th century the lieutenant-general of Languedoc Joyeuse built Fort Brescou. Later Cardinal Richelieu undertook the construction of a roadstead for an Harbour, a strategic point in the Mediterranean area. The work, made difficult by the gradual silting up of the coastline, was abandoned after the death of the Cardinal. Fort Richelieu remains in place.

The paths and squares are named in Occitan, with French added over time, streets have existed since the French Revolution, when the population and birthplaces were registered.

Until the French Revolution, Agde was owned by the bishopric: through the wars of religion all seigniorial possessions become the property of the episcopate. And until then Vias was part of the commune
and until the seventeenth century, the part of the Étang de Thau up to and including Sète was part of the diocese; further north it is the diocese of the bishop of the most important .
 Today only the chapter house remains in Agde.

At the end of the 18th century, when tall sail ships gave way to motor merchant ships, Agde changed its activity towards the exploitation of the land, market gardening, olives and fruits. The local viticulture then experienced is one of its greatest moments of prosperity until the phylloxera.

With the transition to the steam engine, the port of Agde became a shipping point for foodstuffs, it was connected to the railway on a state planning decision concerning the Canal du Midi; The floating bridges before the suspension iron bridge 1836 are the solution to the overflow of the Hérault (the entry carries a tax for 9 years). 
The episcopal palace is cut in two for the passage of the bridge - the right part became the actual Hôtel de la Galiote, the left part the gendarmerie and the prison (which were demolished in 1982) -.

In the 19th century the old 17th century ice houses of Agde became reservoirs allowing the distribution of water by pumping through cast iron pipes. But because of the sometimes brackish water pumped into the town from the Hérault river (depending on the season and the drought), the municipal water supply sometimes failed; In 1966, an alluvial resource from the bed of the coastal river was installed 4 km upstream from the town. This was necessary because of the new development of the modern seaside resort.

Public lighting using electricity (from the Moulin des Evèques) in Agde was planned in 1890 (electricity in a low head dam was also installed by Laurens in his Château). In 1929 the Compagnie de Distribution Electrique du Midi took over the municipal and private contract. In 1946 Électricité de France manages the electricity factory (production stops in 1951).

At the 19th century Belle Epoque, in the mediterranean shore, the development of the French Riviera with the Train Bleu instituted winter aristocratic cosmopolitan tourism since 1880 around Monaco and its grand hotels; An Agatha native Emmanuel Laurens, an inherited millionaire, bought the &quot;St Gervais Villa&quot; in Saint-Raphaël, Var (1898). In the same time he builds in Agde &quot;Belle-Isle&quot; the &quot;Château Laurens&quot;, the marquant concrete Art Nouveau building in Occitania, with its private train station. 

In the old town center, the 1960s municipality had to rebuild the entire infrastructure due to decrepitude and population growth. 1969,the local abbatoirs are closed.

After immediate World War II the summer mass tourism was created in campsites and in 1960s&#x27; some very large and high residences were integrated in the &quot;new urbanism&quot;.
Actual shore development in Occitania began in the 60&#x27;s following first waterfront in Grau d&#x27;Agde with numerous campsites. 

The Mission Racine aimed to revitalize the economy of the region between Béziers and Sète, and make Cap d&#x27;Agde &quot;the holiday port of Toulouse&quot;, the decrepit little town of Agde fully depends on Béziers.

The main marina (Port) was designed next to the location of the cape small fishing port (&quot;Cap d&#x27;Agde&quot;). It replaces the former salt marsh, in use 1912-1916. The fishing port of the Hérault river has been modernised with its professional fish market hall. The river&#x27;s shipyards, which are mixed with pleasure boats and small fishing boats, succeeded the wooden boat yards. &quot;1960: The president&#x27;s plan is actually to make from the coast of Occitania the &quot;French Florida&quot;.

The heads of the inter-ministerial mission developed collective facilities to attract the greatest number of tourists: holiday centres and camps of the nationalised PTT, EDF, SNCF; holiday village houses with Belgian, Netherlands, German investments. Campsites are created, one with the first naturist settlement in France. About leisure, tennis courts, discotheques, amusement parks (an aquatic park) are built. The National Forestry Office with arboriculturists (e.g. Vilmorin) contributed to the creation of green spaces in the resort, and reforestation. Hundreds of thousands of seedlings are then distributed free of charge to individuals.

The naturist campsite became an important tourist complex outside the city, and in its vicinity the tennis courts was the major theme for the development of housing estates.
Since 2007 the Sodéal (Economic development society of Agde and the coast (70% of capital owned by the town) ammenages the marinas on the Hérault river and the shore, main one Le Port de Cap d&#x27;Agde.

Urban sprawl has been taking place for first twenty years of the 21th century between Le Cap and Grau d&#x27;Agde, and this latter place is densifying from its postwar existing hollydays habitat on small plots among large empty ones. In the 21st century, green spaces are reduced to housing and are no longer accessible to the public.

After the installation of basic urban networks, going further, in the same time, cycling infrastructure is reamenaged because of car traffic jams in the 2010s. And municipal car parks receive solar panels in 2017 2019.

2021-2024 Project for extended railway station and the new marina on the Canal du Midi started with destroying the retail buildings around Hôtel Riquet, the Agde offices of the canal&#x27;s founder.

Access to the city tunnel under the railroad line was opened in 2023, after two years of construction, while the most central space, the Promenade and its market, is transformed with the digging of a scheduled car parking lot that began in 2023.

=== Historical act in Agde : French Clergy and property ===
In the history of Roman Catholicism in France, the Council of Agde was held 10 September 506 at Agde, in Saint-André church, under the presidency of Caesarius of Arles. It was attended by thirty-five bishops, and its forty-seven genuine canons dealt &quot;with ecclesiastical discipline&quot;. One of its canons (the seventh), forbidding ecclesiastics to sell or alienate the property of the church from which they derived their living, seems to be the earliest mention of the later system of benefices.

==Population==

Agde&#x27;s inhabitants are called &quot;Agathois&quot;.
10% permanent residents, the population goes up to 200,000 inhabitants in the summer (fourth of a year)

== Wine, wineyards and winemakers ==

The vineyards in Agde are among the oldest in France. Viticulturists, winegrowers experienced the problems of viticulture in the 19th century with diseases. However, while Aramon was able to save the production situation (see the electric pump) in the region by cultivation near the sea, the intensive production of wine in the colony of Algeria caused both the low profitability and the low quality of Agde wines among Languedoc zone. Production began to decline. And production has plummeted since the sea-resort was planned, as housing needs space. The Richemer Cellars were born from the merger of the cooperative cellars of Agde (1936) and Marseillan (1934). However, tourist festivals are still present in the 21st century, including the Vinocap trade show, which brings together a hundred winegrowers. Stores supply wine for tourists. And if the last vineyard of Bagnas is now very small below Château Maraval with the Meyer distillery in ruins, walking in is a planed tourist-office leisure nowadays; its wine is better for &quot;connoisseurs&quot;, old grape varieties producing piquette have been abandoned. This &quot;Wine tourism&quot; has been in full development for several years.

The wine-growing area of the Bagnas reserve was reduced in 2019 with the urbanization of the border running from Château Maraval down to the naturist camp: the most expensive detached villas in the town are here, as well as those at the top of the Mont St Martin with panoramic sea views, which also had vineyards starting at Richelieu beach that disappeared with the urbanisation of 1970.

==Marinas==


The Port of Cap d&#x27;Agde (main marina) was excavated following the Mission Racine in the old salt marsh, the Luno lagoon.

The marina is delimited by the buildings that border it, each one with 100 apartments and around those the housing estates of 200 villas, and in the 2 cases hotels added.

The marina has a single entrance, due to the south–north marine currents that silt it up. It is made up of two distinct parts, built around accessible and non-accessible islands.
The part between accessible Ile des Loisirs and non-accessible Ile St Martin is the part of the harbor where the boat&#x27;s mooring ring to the quay is private and sold with the villa or apartment. 
The part between Ile St Martin and accessible Ile des Pêcheurs is the part of the harbor where the boat&#x27;s mooring ring is rented to the harbor master.

There&#x27;s also a second marina, Port Ambonne, a remnant of the dried-up eastern arm of the Hérault delta, known as Port Lano (old name Lano pound). This is a port for the naturist camp. It is close to a heliport for safety operations at sea. Les Berges de l&#x27;Hérault are the historic riverbanks of the Hérault.

Overall the car must be available for yachtsmen, and some of the places to live are built with an underground garage. 
==Naturist complex==

After the creation of a camping in the farm for nudists receiving Belgian, German and Dutch families, the beach was officially designated as a naturist beach in 1973.
The first development was the construction of apartments, stores and swimming pools in a paid-entry area. These massive concrete buildings did not comply with town-planning regulations, and the huge buildings have global form O and Y. Nudity was legal on the beach. A small commercial area was built before the entrance, the one that makes the camp self-sufficient after it, and housing estates grew up on the seafront, filling the land up to the vacation villages of 1975.
This complex is aside Port Lano and its marina.
==Architecture==






Agde is known for the distinctive black basalt used in local buildings such as the cathedral of Saint Stephen, built in the 12th century to replace a 9th-century Carolingian edifice built on the foundations of a fifth-century Roman church.

Bishop Guillaume fortified the cathedral&#x27;s precincts and provided it with a 35-metre &quot;donjon&quot; (keep). The Romanesque cloister of the cathedral was demolished in 1857.

The sanctuary of Notre-Dame-du-Grau was once an ancient temple, for dévotion in the Antique. The Agenouillade (Kneel) is built after a miraculous prayer by Our Lady (Mary, mother of Jesus) to avoid flooding in Agde in the Sixteenth century.

Near by the Agde Round Lock, aside the rail-way (with a special station for a private stop), Château Laurens is a splendid furnished villa, dandy residence. Inside is a gothic style &quot;salon de concert&quot; with original 19th century stained glass windows from Bézier&#x27;s school.
All like some wine châteaux of Bordeaux were built in classic style due to winery riches, this one coming from an Agde vineyard income is in eclectic style. it is the most beautiful concrete building in Occitania from Belle Epoque.

But if it includes an electric power plant, it does not include a producer wine cellar.

The urban planning of the 60s in France for the new towns separates car traffic and pedestrian-cyclist traffic with some footbridges. For French resorts architecture, &quot;Mediterranean style&quot; sets the mood. This vision of the popular vacation with its french social side is associated with the real estate. In this area, the way was given by the neighbor town Sète for its after-war development, mainly with the retail area of its harbour.

The Bishops&#x27;s Mill is now (2010) a cultural exhibition center, it was &quot; a 13th-century building and former flour mill rehabilitated in the last century as a hydraulic factory and then as a &quot;sardine factory&quot;.

The cooperative winery is created in 1936, but merged in 1998 with the one of Marseillan, 
activity in Marseillan, traffic on Béziers-Sète road. It is transformed into offices and apartments in 2021.

Former National and Municipal Police Station is founded in the old building of National Police in the town-center in 2004, the new one is an extension. 
And the new establishment replacing the old one in Cap center is open in 2020 (cost 1,2 million€). 

The Musée de l&#x27;Éphebe was inaugurated in 1987 after a series of clandestine archaeological excavations of the Roman villa in front of the arena, culminating in the first official underwater archaeological museum.

The modernist movement in the town design can be seen in social housing as well as institutional buildings such as retirement homes, hospital and hôtels. During the &quot;Trente Glorieuses&quot;, high schools were built for baby boomers, with their stadiums, gyms and swimming pools. In Agde, for example, the historic 1975 Sunflower swimming pool has been transformed into a yoga and gymnastics hall.

In the 2000s the International Style is associated with wealth, and it appears in new construction sites with glass facades or rhythmically perforated metal facades, this becomes the decided new rule for the appearance of buildings to improve the value of the city with the aim of attracting more prosperous people to live there.

The new municipal and departmental swimming pool L&#x27;Archipel, cité de l&#x27;eau, is created in 2011, a wooden structure, glass roof.

The new Cap d&#x27;Agde Center was designed with first its casino and second its congress center. The designer is Jean-Michel Wilmotte (architect), with its twin Spanish-style esplanades (Barcelona) (2018 the first one, 2020 the twins), tall circular buildings with large crenellations on the upper floors plus interior gardens, a new annex of the town hall, a new post office, a new congress centre (architect Philippe Bonon and Hervé di Rosa), a new tourist office, ground floors a shopping area (housing starts from 2020 to 2024). 
Circular Casino Barrière (architect Philippe Bonon), is the first built with the today redevelopment of the Ile des Loisirs.
The Maison des Savoirs, former Agde high school transferred to Paul Emile Victor school in Cap d&#x27;Agde site, is a Médiathèque, it is the transformation of the old school (built in the 19th century), the first phase was designed in 2000 by Denis Milhé, the second phase is that of Philippe Bonon, opened in 2020.

The theatre, associated with the media library of the Maison des Savoirs has been rehabilitated since 2020, the whole renovation of the esplanade starting from the Hérault and ending at the theatre will end in 2024.

== History of the communities in Agde ==
=== Spanish community ===
=== Romani community ===
===Jewish community===
It is assumed that a Jewish community was established in the town around the sixth century AD. During the Council of Agde, assembled by the Catholic church in 506 AD, Christian laymen and ecclesiastics were prohibited from eating with Jews or hosting them. This prohibition suggests that the town Jews held good relations with their town neighbours. It is also assumed that the Jewish community was never large, since it did not own a cemetery and buried their dead in Béziers, three miles away.

The Jewish name of the city was Agdi, or Akdi (אגדי). 
=== Agde camp ===
Agde was one of the Internment camps in France, 1936-1946, for the &quot;dangerous people&quot;.
&quot;In February 1939, Agde had a population of 9,000 when the army decided to build a camp at its gates to accommodate 25,000 Spanish “Retirada” republicans. When war was declared, they were replaced by soldiers from the Czechoslovak army, joined a year later by workers from Indochina. In May–June 1940, the town welcomed a large number of French refugees, as well as Belgians, Poles and Czechoslovakians, (including Jews), many of whom were interned in the camp.&quot;

During World War II, about two thousand Jews from Germany and Austria were sent to the camp near the town; most were deported on 24 August 1942.
==Sport and leisure==

The seaside resort of Agde has 14 km of sand for 10 beaches including 15 seasonal private beaches between Grau d&#x27;Agde and Port Ambonne.
; Bagnas natural reserve since 1984 : Bagnas

; Boat show for traders since 1999 : Salon nautique

; Tennis since 1973 : 1973, le Camp Barthès au Cap-d&#x27;Agde

; Vinocap since 2009 : Vinocap

; Deuch&#x27; since 2022: La folie Deuch&#x27;

; E-mobility : e-mobility
In 1973 &quot;Cap-d&#x27;Agde was the temple of the yellow ball in the camp created by Pierre Barthès, before being the Mecca of naturism&quot;.

In 1993 the Mediterranean Games began in Cap d&#x27;Agde. To celebrate the memory of first 1601 historic tournament in town, in 2001 the city of Agde organised major festivities bringing together all the jousting societies of the region.
Agde has a football club RCO Agde who play at the Stade Louis Sanguin. They currently play in the Championnat de France amateur 2.

Agde also has a rugby club, Rugby Olympique Agathois (ROA), who play in the French Federale 1 competition.
== Administrative and budgetary structure ==

Since the 1960 Racine plan for national mass tourism, the town of Agde has been divided into 3 entities: Agde, Cap d&#x27;Agde and Grau d&#x27;Agde. However, there is only one town with no arrondissements, managed by a single council and a single mayor. Consequently, there is only one zip code.

In 2024, the town&#x27;s responsibilities include town planning, building permits, social housing, parks, gardens and stadiums, and local roads. Police powers remain the responsibility of the municipalities even if Agde was one of the prototypes of the gathering in the same premises its municipal police, and the national police (2020), and that the mayor is responsible for directing and planning emergency. One of the main problems since 2020 is the drinkable water supply on a too old network (1970) that leaks, with the climatic problem of drougth.

The budget for all actions within this framework is provided mainly by local taxes on housing and industrial and commercial activity, (plus the garbage collection tax, for the &quot;Sictom&quot; waste collection center in Pézenas since 2014 for Agde).
Since 2003, an Agglomeration of communities for the administration of 20 communes (with Agde 24,651 inhabitants and Pézenas 8,317 inhabitants (2012) as the main towns) has been founded under the name &quot;Agglomération Hérault Méditerranée&quot;. &quot;With a total population of 2,294 permanent residents and around 350,000 in season, this represents a surface area of 371 km2, 20km-long coastline.&quot;

The declared competencies and responsibilities in place of the municipalities of the agglomeration are :
&quot;Agriculture, Quality of life, Water and wastewater treatment, Budget management, Environment, Housing, Leisure and Arts and Crafts (Media libraries, Swimming-pool), Heritage, Public transport (Cap&#x27;Bus).&quot;

For Agde&#x27;s old town, an urban contract for social cohesion (CUCS) was signed between the Hérault-Méditerranée agglomeration community and the French government in 2007.

=== Protecting people and property ===
Since January 1, 2018, the law has assigned the block of competencies relating to Water Environment Management and Flood Prevention (GEMAPI) to the agglomeration [and not to town halls]. The territory is particularly exposed to a double risk, of flooding on the one hand, with a rich hydrographic network including the Hérault river and its watershed, and on the other, of marine submersion.

The Agglomération is responsible for the maintenance and monitoring of several urban flood protection dykes in Agde territory.

=== Green spaces department ===
Developing dry gardens, encouraging the planting of perennials, pruning trees and mowing stadium lawns with the pooling of equipment and machinery: the Agglomération&#x27;s 100 employees keep public spaces clean. Their job is to clean streets and sidewalks, parking lots, squares and public gardens. I.e, there are 70 km of hedges in Cap d&#x27;Agde.

=== Waste water reused ===
The first project of its kind in France is to irrigate the golf course (a private area). It is materialized with the construction by the Agglomeration of the storage reservoir and a first launch in 2018, avoiding the use of 200,000 m3 drinking water. &quot;Eventually, part of Agde&#x27;s green spaces will be able to be irrigated by treated water from the &quot;POSIDONIA&quot; wastewater treatment plant&quot;.

<text>Great Bedwyn is a village and civil parish in east Wiltshire, England. The village is on the River Dun about southwest of Hungerford, southeast of Swindon and southeast of Marlborough.

The Kennet and Avon Canal and the Reading to Taunton line both follow the Dun and pass through the village. Bedwyn railway station is at Great Bedwyn and is the terminus of the rail commuter service via and .

The parish lies within the North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It includes the hamlets of Crofton and St Katharines, together with Tottenham House and part of its estate, Tottenham Park.

==History==

=== Romans ===
A Roman road between Cirencester and Winchester crosses the parish, with Crofton on its route. Castle Copse, south of Great Bedwyn village, is the site of a Roman villa.

=== &#x27;Bedanheafeford&#x27;, the Battle of Bedwyn ===
The battle of &#x27;Bedanheafeford&#x27; between Aescwine of Wessex and King Wulfhere of Mercia in 675 is alleged to have been fought near Great Bedwyn. The battle was originally recorded in the 675 AD entry of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;.

A.H. Burne interpreted &#x27;Biedanheafde&#x27; as an early version of Bedwyn, the derivation of the name being &quot;the head of the Bieda&quot; or &quot;Beda&quot;, a stream running through the Bedwyns. However placename interpretation is tenuous evidence for the battlefield location; the site of the battle has also been claimed for Beedon in Berkshire, and elsewhere.

The discovery of a number of skeletons at Crofton in 1892 by J.W. Brooke was later used to substantiate a local battlefield location. An account of the battle of Bedwyn was published by local historian Maurice Adams in 1903. However, only excavation of these graves will confirm if they contain battlefield victims.

Brooke recorded that &quot;I cannot assign any period to them, but the field over them is paved with flint weapons. On one visit I observed children building miniature castles with human femur and tibiae.&quot; In a letter to Maurice Adams, B.H. Cunningham described the graves, five to seven in number, &quot;radiating from a common centre like the spokes of a wheel&quot;. Unfortunately he had made no notes of his finds and was writing from memory. Mrs M.E. Cunnington&#x27;s study of Saxon grave sites in Wiltshire noted that there was no evidence to support the belief that the Crofton site contained Saxon graves. Nearby finds consisted only of a La Tène earthenware pot. As the graves are within the site of a causewayed camp this is not surprising. Maurice Adams would not have known about the Crofton camp as it was undiscovered until an aerial survey in 1976.

Given the lack of evidence, Maurice Adam&#x27;s confidence in a Bedwyn battlefield site cannot be shared. Until more substantial evidence about the Crofton graves can be gathered, there is no reason to suggest that the Bedwyn location, for an obscure 7th century battle, is anything more than a myth.

=== Reference in the will of King Alfred the Great ===

The last will and testament of King Alfred the Great contains reference to Bedwyn. Describing his elder son Edward&#x27;s inheritance he writes &quot;And I grant him the land at Cannington and at Bedwyn and at Pewsey ...&quot; The Bedwyn of King Alfred was a large estate, whose territory included the modern parishes of Great and Little Bedwyn, Grafton, and Burbage. Bedwyn continues to enjoy an enduring royal pedigree. It belonged to the crown in 788, when part of the estate was granted to a crown servant called Bica. King Alfred&#x27;s descendants held the estate until it was granted to Abingdon Abbey by King Edgar in 968. However the estate was recovered by King Athelred a few years later, and was recorded as a crown estate in the Domesday survey of 1086. Although most of the estate had passed into private hands by the end of the mediaeval period, the execution of Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, in 1552 resulted in the temporary return of much of Bedwyn to the crown. The disastrous finances of his descendants resulted in the great sale of 1929, and much of the former Bedwyn estate was purchased by the Crown Estate. They remain one of the largest landowners in modern Bedwyn.

== Religious sites ==
===Church of St. Mary===
The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary the Virgin has 12th-century origins. Beneath the church are substantial remains of a Saxon church begun in AD 905. In the chancel is a memorial to Sir John Seymour, father of King Henry VIII&#x27;s wife Jane Seymour. The church is designated as a Grade I listed building, and a 14th-century limestone cross in the churchyard is Grade II*.

Thomas Willis (1621–1675), the great Oxford physician and natural philosopher, was born at Great Bedwyn on 27 January 1621 and was baptized on 14 February at the church.

=== Church of St. Katharine ===
St Katharine&#x27;s was built by T.H. Wyatt in 1861, as the estate church for Tottenham House. In 1864, a parish was formed for it from parts of the parishes of Great Bedwyn, Little Bedwyn and Burbage. The church is Grade II* listed.

=== Methodist chapel ===
A Methodist chapel was opened c. 1810 in Church Street, Great Bedwyn. It was replaced by a chapel built in 1875 in Brown&#x27;s Lane; this chapel closed in 1967.

== Canal and railway ==
The Kennet and Avon Canal was opened from Hungerford to Great Bedwyn in 1799, and from Great Bedwyn to Devizes in 1809. There are four locks in the parish: Burnt Mill Lock and Bedwyn Church Lock near the village, and two of the Crofton flight to the southwest.

In 1862 the Great Western Railway built the Berks and Hants Extension Railway from Hungerford to Pewsey and Devizes, closely following the north bank of the canal, with a station named at Great Bedwyn. There are regular services to and , and the station is a railhead for Marlborough which is served by buses that connect with the trains.

== Schools ==
A National School was built in Church Street, Great Bedwyn in 1835 and extended in 1856, becoming a Church of England primary school in 1963. The school moved to a new building on the outskirts of the village in 1994.

In the northwest of the parish, a church school was opened at St Katharine&#x27;s in 1865 and continues in use.

The National School at East Grafton, opened in 1846, was used by children from Crofton; this school closed in 2011.

==Local government==
The civil parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which performs all significant local government functions.

In 1895 the southern portion of Great Bedwyn parish (south of the railway, including Wolfhall and East Grafton) became a new parish called Grafton. Wolfhall was transferred to Burbage parish in 1988.

==Parliamentary representation==
Great Bedwyn was a parliamentary borough which elected two Members of Parliament (MPs) to the House of Commons from 1295 until 1832, when the borough was abolished by the Great Reform Act. The parish now falls within the East Wiltshire constituency.

== Notable people ==
A branch of the Hungerford family of Farleigh Hungerford owned land in the area. Members include Sir Anthony Hungerford (1567–1627), a religious controversialist, who sat in Parliament for Marlborough and later Great Bedwyn. He bought an estate at Marten (now in Grafton parish).

Thomas Willis (1621–1675), influential physician and anatomist, Oxford professor and one of the founders of the Royal Society, was born at Great Bedwyn.

<doc id="1020465" wikidata="Q390920" url="?curid=1020465" title="Baltic Cup (football)">
<text>The Baltic Cup (, , ) is an international football competition contested by the national teams of the Baltic states – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Sometimes guests from the Northern Europe subregion are also invited: Finland has participated in the event twice, Iceland once, and Faroe Islands made a debut appearance in 2024. Though originally held annually, the competition has been biennial since 2008.

It is one of the oldest national teams football tournaments in Europe after the British Home Championship, and the oldest of the ones still organized.

==History==
As Estonia had unofficially declared itself the Baltic football champion in 1925, 1926 and 1927 based on matches played with Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland it was decided in 1928 to organize an official tournament. Though Poland and Finland were invited to join, the tournament took place between the three Baltic nations.

The tournament was intended to improve relations between the nations, but intrigues around the organization and budget questions worked against this goal. The hosts always did everything to wear out their competitors. In 1933 Lithuanian hosts surprised the officials with a tour to a local brewery in Kaunas in the morning before the Lithuania–Latvia match. The Estonian newspaper &quot;Päevaleht&quot; reported that the Finnish referee for the match was really jolly, but did a horrible job, mostly favouring the Lithuanian hosts. The rules demanded that at least two wins were necessary to win the championship. Both the Lithuania–Estonia and Lithuania–Latvia matches had been drawn, but stopped due to darkness and a lack of artificial lighting.

In the team meeting Latvia demanded that the Lithuania–Estonia match should be re-played first. Latvia was hoping for an advantage against a tired Lithuanian team in their match. Lithuania and Estonia disagreed, noting that Latvia had won their match against Estonia, so a Latvian win against Lithuania would grant the Latvians the championship and end the tournament. Consensus was not reached and the Latvian team left the same day. The championship was not awarded.

The feud led to the cancellation of the 1934 tournament, but the championship returned for the 1935. The rules were changed so that extra matches were now only held between leading teams if they were necessary for deciding on the championship. In 2021, for the 2020 Baltic Cup, Estonia won the Cup after a wait of 83 years.

During the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states, the Baltic Cup took place in 1940 and from 1948 to 1976 (with cancelled editions in 1951, 1953 to 1956 and 1963 to 1968) as a minor regional tournament between the Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian SSRs, with occasional appearances by the Belarusian SSR. In 1991, the tournament was fully restored to the format as it was in the 1930s.

The 2020 tournament was postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic, and took place in 2021, similarly to UEFA Euro 2020.

== The trophy ==
The original silver trophy of the Baltic Cup was seized by the Soviets in 1940 and subsequently lost after reportedly being taken to Moscow. A replica trophy was created in 1991 by Latvian sculptor Indulis Urbāns. It depicts three footballers, representing the three Baltic nations, holding a football on their shoulders akin to Atlas. However, in recent editions, e.g. 2022 and in the 2000s, the trophies awarded were of various different shapes.

==Hat-tricks==
Since the first official tournament in 1928, 4 hat-tricks have been scored in over 50 matches of the 28 editions of the tournament. The first hat-trick was scored by Arnold Pihlak of the Estonia, playing against Lithuania on 26 July 1928; and the last was by Virginijus Baltušnikas of Lithuania, playing against Latvia on 12 July 1992. No player has ever scored two hat-tricks in the Baltic Cup and no player has ever scored more than 3 goals in a single Baltic Cup match.

<text>Agde Cathedral () is a Roman Catholic church located in Agde in the Hérault &quot;département&quot; of southern France. The cathedral is dedicated to Saint Stephen, and stands on the bank of the river Hérault.

It was formerly the seat of the Bishops of Agde, the last of whom, Charles-François-Siméon de Rouvroy de Saint-Simon de Vermandois de Sandricourt, was guillotined during the Terror. The see was not restored after the French Revolution and its parishes were added to the Diocese of Montpellier by the Concordat of 1801.

==History and description ==

The present building was constructed in the 12th century, beginning in 1173 under the direction of bishop William II of Agde, replacing a 9th century Carolingian church that had stood on the foundations of a 5th-century Roman church, which stood on the site of a temple of Diana.

The cathedral is remarkable for being built of black basalt from the nearby volcanic Mont St. Loup quarries. The building is extremely strong and was designed to serve as a fortress as much as a church: the walls are between 2 and 3 metres thick, and the square tower, 35 metres high, could also function as a keep (a fortified tower). The very prominent crenellations and machicolations are more characteristic of a fortress than of a church. It was declared a &quot;monument historique&quot; in 1840.

The Romanesque cloister which once adjoined the cathedral was demolished in 1857. Many of the materials, such as the capitals and the columns, were shortly afterwards reused for the construction of the lady chapel, which is now used as the entrance.

The 17th century high altar is made of polychromatic marble, which stands out against the austere setting of the cathedral&#x27;s interior, as does the organ&#x27;s Baroque architectural style.

Of the cathedral&#x27;s five bells, four are hung in the belltower, and were cast by Burdin-Aîné of Lyon in 1894 and 1895. The fifth is on top of the belltower and is used only for the chiming of the clock. It was cast in 1665 by Damiac Fulcrand at Béziers, and declared a &quot;monument historique&quot; in 1959.

<text>Dolomite (also known as dolomite rock, dolostone or dolomitic rock) is a sedimentary carbonate rock that contains a high percentage of the mineral dolomite, CaMg(CO3)2. It occurs widely, often in association with limestone and evaporites, though it is less abundant than limestone and rare in Cenozoic rock beds (beds less than about 66 million years in age). One of the first geologists to distinguish dolomite from limestone was Déodat Gratet de Dolomieu, a French mineralogist and geologist after whom it is named. He recognized and described the distinct characteristics of dolomite in the late 18th century, differentiating it from limestone.

Most dolomite was formed as a magnesium replacement of limestone or of lime mud before lithification. The geological process of conversion of calcite to dolomite is known as dolomitization and any intermediate product is known as dolomitic limestone. The &quot;dolomite problem&quot; refers to the vast worldwide depositions of dolomite in the past geologic record in contrast to the limited amounts of dolomite formed in modern times. Recent research has revealed sulfate-reducing bacteria living in anoxic conditions precipitate dolomite which indicates that some past dolomite deposits may be due to microbial activity.

Dolomite is resistant to erosion and can either contain bedded layers or be unbedded. It is less soluble than limestone in weakly acidic groundwater, but it can still develop solution features (karst) over time. Dolomite rock can act as an oil and natural gas reservoir.

==Name==
Dolomite takes its name from the 18th-century French mineralogist Déodat Gratet de Dolomieu (1750–1801), who was one of the first to describe the mineral.

The term &quot;dolomite&quot; refers to both the calcium-magnesium carbonate mineral and to sedimentary rock formed predominantly of this mineral. The term &quot;dolostone&quot; was introduced in 1948 to avoid confusion between the two. However, the usage of the term &quot;dolostone&quot; is controversial, because the name &quot;dolomite&quot; was first applied to the rock during the late 18th century and thus has technical precedence. The use of the term &quot;dolostone&quot; was not recommended by the &quot;Glossary of Geology&quot; published by the American Geological Institute.

In old USGS publications, dolomite was referred to as &quot;magnesian limestone&quot;, a term now reserved for magnesium-deficient dolomites or magnesium-rich limestones.

==Description==
Dolomite rock is defined as sedimentary carbonate rock composed of more than 50% mineral dolomite. Dolomite is characterized by its nearly ideal 1:1 stoichiometric ratio of magnesium to calcium. It is distinct from high-magnesium limestone in that the magnesium and calcium form ordered layers within the individual dolomite mineral grains, rather than being arranged at random, as they are in high-magnesium calcite grains. In natural dolomite, magnesium is typically between 44 and 50 percent of total magnesium plus calcium, indicating some substitution of calcium into the magnesium layers. A small amount of ferrous iron typically substitutes for magnesium, particularly in more ancient dolomites. Carbonate rock tends to be either almost all calcite or almost all dolomite, with intermediate compositions being quite uncommon.

Dolomite outcrops are recognized in the field by their softness (mineral dolomite has a Mohs hardness of 4 or less, well below common silicate minerals) and because dolomite bubbles feebly when a drop of dilute hydrochloric acid is dropped on it. This distinguishes dolomite from limestone, which is also soft but reacts vigorously with dilute hydrochloric acid. Dolomite usually weathers to a characteristic dull yellow-brown color due to the presence of ferrous iron. This is released and oxidized as the dolomite weathers. Dolomite is usually granular in appearance, with a texture resembling grains of sugar.

Under the microscope, thin sections of dolomite usually show individual grains that are well-shaped rhombs, with considerable pore space. As a result, subsurface dolomite is generally more porous than subsurface limestone and makes up 80% of carbonate rock petroleum reservoirs. This texture contrasts with limestone, which is usually a mixture of grains, micrite (very fine-grained carbonate mud) and sparry cement. The optical properties of calcite and mineral dolomite are difficult to distinguish, but calcite almost never crystallizes as regular rhombs, and calcite is stained by Alizarin Red S while dolomite grains are not. Dolomite rock consisting of well-formed grains with planar surfaces is described as &quot;planar&quot; or &quot;idiotopic&quot; dolomite, while dolomite consisting of poorly-formed grains with irregular surfaces is described as &quot;nonplanar&quot; or &quot;xenotopic&quot; dolomite. The latter likely forms by recrystallization of existing dolomite at elevated temperature (over ).

The texture of dolomite often shows that it is secondary, formed by replacement of calcium by magnesium in limestone. The preservation of the original limestone texture can range from almost perfectly preserved to completely destroyed. Under a microscope, dolomite rhombs are sometimes seen to replace oolites or skeletal particles of the original limestone. There is sometimes selective replacement of fossils, with the fossil remaining mostly calcite and the surrounding matrix composed of dolomite grains. Sometimes dolomite rhombs are seen cut across the fossil outline. However, some dolomite shows no textural indications that it was formed by replacement of limestone.

== Occurrence and origin ==

Dolomite is widespread in its occurrences, though not as common as limestone. It is typically found in association with limestone or evaporite beds and is often interbedded with limestone. There is no consistent trend in its abundance with age, but most dolomite appears to have formed at high stands of sea level. Little dolomite is found in Cenozoic beds (beds less than 65 million years old), which has been a time of generally low sea levels. Times of high sea level also tend to be times of a greenhouse Earth, and it is possible that greenhouse conditions are the trigger for dolomite formation.

Many dolomites show clear textural indications that they are secondary dolomites, formed by replacement of limestone. However, although much research has gone into understanding this process of &quot;dolomitization&quot;, the process remains poorly understood. There are also fine-grained dolomites showing no textural indications that they formed by replacement, and it is uncertain whether they formed by replacement of limestone that left no textural traces or are true primary dolomites. This &quot;dolomite problem&quot; was first recognized over two centuries ago but is still not fully resolved.

The dolomitization reaction

is thermodynamically favorable, with a Gibbs free energy of about -2.2 kcal/mol. In theory, ordinary seawater contains sufficient dissolved magnesium to cause dolomitization. However, because of the very slow rate of diffusion of ions in solid mineral grains at ordinary temperatures, the process can occur only by simultaneous dissolution of calcite and crystallization of dolomite. This in turn requires that large volumes of magnesium-bearing fluids are flushed through the pore space in the dolomitizing limestone. Several processes have been proposed for dolomitization.

The hypersaline model (also known as the evaporative reflux model) is based on the observation that dolomite is very commonly found in association with limestone and evaporites, with the limestone often interbedded with the dolomite. According to this model, dolomitization takes place in a closed basin where seawater is subject to high rates of evaporation. This results in precipitation of gypsum and aragonite, raising the magnesium to calcium ratio of the remaining brine. The brine is also dense, so it sinks into the pore space of any underlying limestone (&quot;seepage refluxion&quot;), flushing out the existing pore fluid and causing dolomitization. The Permian Basin of North America has been put forward as an example of an environment in which this process took place. A variant of this model has been proposed for sabkha environments in which brine is sucked up into the dolomitizing limestone by evaporation of capillary fluids, a process called &quot;evaporative pumping&quot;.

Another model is the mixing-zone or Dorag model, in which meteoric water mixes with seawater already present in the pore space, increasing the chemical activity of magnesium relative to calcium and causing dolomitization. The formation of Pleistocene dolomite reefs in Jamaica has been attributed to this process. However, this model has been heavily criticized, with one 2004 review paper describing it bluntly as &quot;a myth&quot;. A 2021 paper argued that the mixing zone serves as domain of intense microbial activity which promotes dolomitization.

A third model postulates that normal seawater is the dolomitizing fluid, and the necessary large volumes are flushed through the dolomitizing limestone through tidal pumping. Dolomite formation at Sugarloaf Key, Florida, may be an example of this process. A similar process might occur during rises in sea level, as large volumes of water move through limestone platform rock.

Regardless of the mechanism of dolomitization, the tendency of carbonate rock to be either almost all calcite or almost all dolomite suggests that, once the process is started, it completes rapidly. The process likely occurs at shallow depths of burial, under , where there is an inexhaustible supply of magnesium-rich seawater and the original limestone is more likely to be porous. On the other hand, dolomitization can proceed rapidly at the greater temperatures characterizing deeper burial, if a mechanism exists to flush magnesium-bearing fluids through the beds.

Mineral dolomite has a 12% to 13% smaller volume than calcite per alkali cation. Thus dolomitization likely increases porosity and contributes to the sugary texture of dolomite.

=== The dolomite problem and primary dolomite ===
Dolomite is supersaturated in normal seawater by a factor of greater than ten, but dolomite is not seen to precipitate in the oceans. Likewise, geologists have not been successful at precipitating dolomite from seawater at normal temperatures and pressures in laboratory experiments. This is likely due to a very high activation energy for nucleating crystals of dolomite.

The magnesium ion is a relatively small ion, and it acquires a tightly bound hydration shell when dissolved in water. In other words, the magnesium ion is surrounded by a clump of water molecules that are strongly attracted to its positive charge. Calcium is a larger ion and this reduces the strength of binding of its hydration shell, so it is much easier for a calcium ion than a magnesium ion to shed its hydration shell and bind to a growing crystal. It is also more difficult to nucleate a seed crystal of ordered dolomite than disordered high-magnesium calcite. As a result, attempts to precipitate dolomite from seawater precipitate high-magnesium calcite instead. This substance, which has an excess of calcium over magnesium and lacks calcium-magnesium ordering, is sometimes called &quot; protodolomite&quot;. Raising the temperature makes it easier for magnesium to shed its hydration shell, and dolomite can be precipitated from seawater at temperatures in excess of . Protodolomite also rapidly converts to dolomite at temperatures of or higher. The high temperatures necessary for the formation of dolomite helps explain the rarity of Cenozoic dolomites, since Cenozoic seawater temperatures seldom exceeded 40 °C.

It is possible that microorganisms are capable of precipitating primary dolomite. This was first demonstrated in samples collected at Lagoa Vermelha, Brazil in association with sulfate-reducing bacteria (&quot;Desulfovibrio&quot;), leading to the hypothesis that sulfate ion inhibits dolomite nucleation. Later laboratory experiments suggest bacteria can precipitate dolomite independently of the sulfate concentration. With time other pathways of interaction between microbial activity and dolomite formation have been added to the discord regarding their role in modulation and generation of polysaccharides, manganese and zinc within the porewater. Meanwhile, a contrary view held by other researchers is that microorganisms precipitate only high-magnesium calcite but leave open the question of whether this can lead to precipitation of dolomite.

=== Dedolomitization ===
Dolomitization can sometimes be reversed, and a dolomite bed converted back to limestone. This is indicated by a texture of pseudomorphs of mineral dolomite that have been replaced with calcite. Dedolomitized limestone is typically associated with gypsum or oxidized pyrite, and dedolomitization is thought to occur at very shallow depths through infiltration of surface water with a very high ratio of calcium to magnesium. 

== Uses ==

Dolomite is used for many of the same purposes as limestone, including as construction aggregate; in agriculture to neutralize soil acidity and supply calcium and magnesium; as a source of carbon dioxide; as dimension stone; as a filler in fertilizers and other products; as a flux in metallurgy; and in glass manufacturing. It cannot substitute for limestone in chemical processes that require a high-calcium limestone, such as manufacture of sodium carbonate. Dolomite is used for production of magnesium chemicals, such as Epsom salt, and is used as a magnesium supplement. It is also used in the manufacture of refractory materials.

==Caves in dolomite rock==
As with limestone caves, natural caves and solution tubes typically form in dolomite rock as a result of the dissolution by weak carbonic acid. Caves can also, less commonly, form through dissolution of rock by sulfuric acid. Calcium carbonate speleothems (secondary deposits) in the forms of stalactites, stalagmites, flowstone etc., can also form in caves within dolomite rock. “Dolomite is a common rock type, but a relatively uncommon mineral in speleothems”.
Both the &#x27;Union Internationale de Spéléologie&#x27; (UIS) and the American &#x27;National Speleological Society&#x27; (NSS), extensively use in their publications, the terms &quot;dolomite&quot; or &quot;dolomite rock&quot; when referring to the natural bedrock containing a high percentage of CaMg(CO3)2 in which natural caves or solution tubes have formed.

===Dolomite speleothems===
Both calcium and magnesium go into solution when dolomite rock is dissolved. The speleothem precipitation sequence is: calcite, Mg-calcite, aragonite, huntite and hydromagnesite. Hence, the most common speleothem (secondary deposit) in caves within dolomite rock karst, is calcium carbonate in the most stable polymorph form of calcite. Speleothem types known to have a dolomite constituent include: coatings, crusts, moonmilk, flowstone, coralloids, powder, spar and rafts. Although there are reports of dolomite speleothems known to exist in a number of caves around the world, they are usually in relatively small quantities and form in very fine-grained deposits.

<text>Murphy Aircraft Manufacturing Limited is a Canadian maker of civil general aviation kits for amateur construction currently owned by China-headquartered Duofu Group. The company was founded in 1985 by Darryl Murphy and is located in Chilliwack, British Columbia.

==History==
The company was started as the result of a hunting accident. Darryl Murphy was a mechanical engineering technologist who designed and built a rigid wing hang glider in 1978 as a school project at the Saskatchewan Institute of Applied Science and Technology in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. In 1984 Murphy was in a non-aviation accident that left him hospitalized for four months. During his recovery time he decided to design a biplane to fit into the then-new Canadian ultralight category. The aircraft was a single-seat model and was intended as a one-off aircraft for his own use, with no production intentions. Murphy named it the Renegade.

After taking the Renegade to a number of fly-ins and other aviation events, Murphy was encouraged by the positive response it received and by the number of people who asked him to build one for them. In 1985 Murphy quit his job and started &quot;Murphy Aviation&quot; (later renamed &quot;Murphy Aircraft Manufacturing&quot;), with his brother Bryan and located the company in Chilliwack, British Columbia.

The original Renegade design was turned into a two-seater by relocating the fuel tank from the centre fuselage to the upper wing, installing a second seat and designating it the Renegade II. Initial sales were disappointing as only one kit was sold in the first six months. Sales improved greatly once the aviation press began reviewing the aircraft. By 1986 the company had a backlog of orders, including many from outside North America. Murphy displayed the Renegade at the EAA Convention, Oshkosh and returned to Chilliwack with a substantial order book. During 1989 sales totalled 129 Renegade IIs.

In May 1987 a new version of the basic Renegade design first flew. Named the Renegade Spirit it added a radial engine-style round cowling and a Rotax 532 and later the Rotax 582 engine.

In September 2008, as a result of restructuring due to the early 2000s recession, Murphy Aircraft split off their sales functions to a new company, &quot;Patterson AeroSales&quot;, headed by former Murphy sales representative Bob Patterson. Murphy Aircraft continues to concentrate on designing and manufacturing kit aircraft while Patterson handles &quot;show appearances, advertising materials, promotions and general sales responsibilities&quot;. Murphy Aircraft President Darryl Murphy also explained that the company will only manufacture kits in batches once sufficient numbers of orders have been accumulated to justify a production run and that standard aircraft hardware parts, like rivets and bolts would be shipped directly from the suppliers to customers to save costs.

On 9 January 2014 the company issued a press release indicating that Darryl Murphy was retiring and wished to sell the company, indicating he expected to receive in the &quot;$2.5 to $4 million range, depending on how much of the manufacturing machinery the buyer wants&quot;.

On 22 January 2016 Murphy Aircraft announced that it has begun the process to put the Murphy Rebel into the light-sport aircraft category.

The company unveiled a new Darryl Murphy design at AirVenture in July 2016, the Murphy Radical, which incorporates bicycle carriers on the wings.

In 2022, Murphy Aircraft was acquired by Beijing-based Duofu International Holding Group, one of the top 25 Chinese conglomerates, which has subsidiaries in the fields of investment, manufacturing, mining, real estate, culture, tourism, international trade and aviation manufacturing. The company appointed Jensen Li as the managing director.

The newly acquired company halted kit production while rewriting the kit documentation using CAD/CAM computerization and also re-working the kits to speed up assembly time with improved pre-drilling. Kit production was expected to resume later in 2023, with a reduced offering of only three designs, the Murphy Moose, Radical and Rebel.

<text>Mogi das Cruzes () is a municipality in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, located within the metropolitan region of the state capital of the city of São Paulo. The population is 451,505 (2022 census) in an area of 713 km2. It is located 40 km to the east of the city of São Paulo. It was founded in 1560 by the &quot;bandeirantes&quot;. The sprawling municipality, which includes many rural areas, is the easternmost arm of São Paulo conburbation (built up area) seen on satellite images. César de Souza and Brás Cubas districts are considered the suburban core, center of town and a city within the municipality in a horizontal line east of the built-up area of Suzano. 

== History ==
Mogi das Cruzes began as a village around 1560, serving as a resting place for the bandeirantes and explorers coming and going from São Paulo, including Brás Cubas. In September 1608, the Captain-Major of the Captaincy of São Vicente, Gaspar Conqueiro, granted Gaspar Vaz Guedes a Sesmaria in that location. Gaspar Vaz Guedes was responsible for opening the first road between the capital and Mogi, starting the village, later elevated to a &quot;town&quot;, with the name &quot;Vila de Sant&#x27;Ana de Mogi Mirim&quot;. The fact was made official on September 1, 1611. On March 13, 1865, it was elevated to the status of city, and on April 14, 1874, it was elevated to the status of county.

According to historian Isaac Grinberg, the bandeirante Gaspar Vaz, in addition to being responsible for opening and exploring these lands, after acquiring a land grant in the region, was also responsible for the request to elevate the settlement to a town. This occurred in 1611, on the first of September.

Mogi das Cruzes welcomes colonies from all corners of the world, with a special emphasis on Japanese colonization, with a large number of Japanese and their descendants (approximately 20% according to the city hall), who are already in their third generation in the municipality. In addition, the municipality has a considerable population from the northeast, with the majority of whom came to the state capital and later moved to Mogi das Cruzes in search of a better quality of life.

== Districts ==
The municipality is subdivided into the following districts:
* Brás Cubas (named after Brás Cubas)
* Biritiba-Ussu
* César de Sousa
* Jundiapeba
* Quatinga
* Sabaúna
* Taiaçupeba

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia Telefônica da Borda do Campo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012. The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<text>“The Computer Wore Menace Shoes&quot; is the sixth episode of the twelfth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 3, 2000. In the episode, Homer buys a computer and creates his own website to spread gossip and fake news. However, when Homer starts writing conspiracy theories about flu shots, he is sent to an island where people who know too much are imprisoned.

&quot;The Computer Wore Menace Shoes&quot; was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Mark Kirkland. The title of the episode is a reference to the 1969 Disney comedy film &quot;The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes&quot;, but the episode isn&#x27;t related to the film in any other way. The episode&#x27;s third act features many references to the 1967 science fiction series &quot;The Prisoner&quot;.

The episode features Patrick McGoohan as Number Six, the main character from &quot;The Prisoner&quot;. In its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 9.1 million viewers, finishing in 28th place in the ratings the week it aired. Following its broadcast, the episode received mixed reviews from critics; commentators were divided over the episode&#x27;s third act.

==Plot==
After finding out that all of the nuclear power plant&#x27;s staff members had been informed of the plant&#x27;s closure for maintenance via e-mail, Homer decides to buy a computer. After Lisa sets up the computer for him, Homer starts his own webpage, which contains copyrighted material from other pages. To avoid getting sued, Homer calls himself &quot;Mr. X&quot;. Late at night, unable to sleep until someone visits his page, Homer hears a rumor from Bart started by either Nelson Muntz or Jimbo Jones that Mayor Quimby spent the street repair fund on a secret swimming pool. He posts this rumor on his page, which is seen by several of Springfield&#x27;s citizens, and reporters find a luxurious pool along with many scantily dressed women in Quimby&#x27;s office building.

Homer keeps anonymously investigating and posting more scandals, including Mr. Burns selling uranium to terrorists (resulting in Burns getting arrested by the FBI), Apu selling expired doughnuts as bagels, and various unprofessional acts by the Springfield Police Department (although he overlooks Krusty&#x27;s admission to vehicular manslaughter). Eventually, Mr. X wins the Pulitzer Prize for his journalistic achievements, despite no-one knowing who he is. When he hears that the prize money will be given to starving children, Homer reveals himself as Mr. X. However, this ends up alienating Homer from the rest of the town, as no-one feels comfortable confessing their secrets now that they know he is Mr. X, and his fame soon plummets. To boost his popularity, Homer begins posting outrageous fake stories on his webpage. Regaining his fame, Homer celebrates by going to a Kwik-E-Mart which turns out to be fake, and he ends up being kidnapped.

Homer wakes up on the &quot;Island&quot;, a place where the inhabitants are people who have been exiled from society for harboring dangerous secrets. Homer learns from the organization&#x27;s leader, Number Two, that a story he wrote about flu vaccinations containing a mind-control serum is true; the mind control drug is calibrated to drive people into a frenzy of shopping, which is why flu shots are administered shortly before Christmas. While Homer is trapped on the Island, he is replaced by a doppelgänger who looks identical to him but speaks with a thick German accent and wears a dark tie.

Number Six, who is trapped on the Island for inventing the bottomless peanut bag, tells Homer about a makeshift boat he spent thirty-three years making, which Homer steals and escapes the Island with. When he gets home, Homer tries to contact the police through his computer, only for the computer to be hacked remotely by Number Two. Homer is attacked by his doppelgänger but then defeats him by kicking him in the crotch. Marge and the kids are happy that the real Homer has returned, but then a fake Santa&#x27;s Little Helper spouts a gas that drugs the entire family. The episode ends with everyone in the family enjoying their strange, new life on the Island. A fake koala shoots gas towards the viewer while Homer and Lisa invite them to the Island.

==Production==

&quot;The Computer Wore Menace Shoes&quot; was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Mark Kirkland. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on December 3, 2000. Originally, the episode was about Homer becoming Matt Drudge, the creator and an editor of the news aggregation website the &quot;Drudge Report&quot;, of which Swartzwelder is a fan. At that point, the episode was called &quot;Homer the Drudge&quot;. The chalkboard gag was written by staff writer Don Payne, and the couch gag was conceived by producer Laurie Biernackie.

The third act of &quot;The Computer Wore Menace Shoes&quot; is a pastiche of the 1967 science fiction television series &quot;The Prisoner&quot;. In order to &quot;get the feel&quot; of &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, the writers watched its opening sequence, which summarizes the story of the series. Kirkland, who had seen a couple of episodes as a child, watched several episodes of the series with &quot;The Simpsons&quot;&#x27; animators in order to make &quot;The Computer Wore Menace Shoes&quot; resemble it. They were also influenced by 1960s modernism and furniture designs from the 1971 science fiction film &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;.

The episode features American-born actor Patrick McGoohan as Number Six, the central character in &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, which McGoohan played. &quot;The Computer Wore Menace Shoes&quot; was the only time McGoohan reprised his role as Number Six. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Payne said that McGoohan was &quot;very funny&quot;, and that all the writers wanted to meet him when he came to record his dialogue for the episode.

McGoohan was reportedly very pleased with his role in the episode; when his wife Joan McGoohan, who is a real estate broker, helped staff writer Max Pross buy a house, she told him that Patrick McGoohan was as proud of the episode as anything in his career.

==Cultural references==

&quot;The Computer Wore Menace Shoes&quot; makes fun of use of the Internet, which was rapidly growing in popularity at the time. &quot;[...] The Internet was just starting to turn into a serious waste of time around this point in history&quot;, staff writer Matt Selman said in the episode&#x27;s DVD commentary. The news website that Homer creates is based on the Drudge Report, a news aggregator created by journalist Matt Drudge. The episode was also written at a time when several &quot;The Simpsons&quot; producers invested in an animated web series&#x27; company called icebox.com, which was co-created by two former &quot;The Simpsons&quot; writers.

Although the title of the episode is a reference to the 1969 Disney film &quot;The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes&quot;, the episode itself has &quot;essentially nothing&quot; to do with the film, according to M. Keith Booker in his book &quot;Drawn to Television: Prime-Time Animation from The Flintstones to Family Guy.&quot; In the episode, the slogan of Homer&#x27;s webpage is &quot;All the muck that&#x27;s fit to rake&quot;. This is a reference to the American newspaper &quot;The New York Times&quot;, whose slogan is &quot;All the News That&#x27;s Fit to Print&quot;. The word &quot;muck&quot; refers to muckrakers, a term closely associated with reform-oriented journalists who wrote largely for popular magazines after 1900.

The episode&#x27;s third act, which serves as a parody of &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, features several references to the series. When the secret organization finds out about Homer&#x27;s discovery, he is taken to a secret location called the &quot;Island&quot;. The &quot;Island&quot; is modeled after the &quot;Village&quot;, where Number Six is taken in &quot;The Prisoner&quot;.

While he is in the &quot;Island&quot;, Homer is repeatedly gassed by unexpected objects, a reference to the way Number Six would often be gassed in &quot;The Prisoner&quot;. &quot;George [Meyer] and I used to laugh a lot about how often [Number Six] would be gassed by unexpected devices in the show&quot;, Scully said in the episode&#x27;s DVD commentary. &quot;And we wanted to cram as many in as we could.&quot; While escaping the &quot;Island&quot;, Homer is chased by a &quot;big balloon&quot;. The balloon is a reference to Rover, a floating white ball in &quot;The Prisoner&quot; that was created to keep inhabitants in the &quot;Village&quot;, which was also featured in the season 9 episode &quot;The Joy of Sect&quot;. The music heard in the scene is based on &quot;The Prisoner&quot;&#x27;s theme music.

==Release and reception==
In its original American broadcast on December 3, 2000, &quot;The Computer Wore Menace Shoes&quot; received a 9.0 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research, translating to approximately 9.1 million viewers. The episode finished in 28th place in the ratings for the week of November 27-December 3, 2000, tying with an episode of the news magazine &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; and the CBS sitcom &quot;The King of Queens&quot;. After the episode was released, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;&#x27; writers created a website called mrxswebpage.com, which was made to resemble Homer&#x27;s website in the episode.

This was at a time when many television shows created websites to promote episodes; earlier that year, Fox created a website called whatbadgerseat.com in conjunction with the season premiere, in which badgers played an important role. On August 18, 2009, the episode was released as part of a DVD set called &quot;The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season&quot;. Mike Scully, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Don Payne, John Frink, Matt Selman, Tom Gammill, Max Pross, Mark Kirkland and Joel H. Cohen participated in the audio commentary for the episode.

Following its broadcast, &quot;The Computer Wore Menace Shoes&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. Giving it a positive review, DVD Talk&#x27;s Jason Bailey described the episode as a &quot;smart piece of social satire&quot;. He especially enjoyed Homer&#x27;s part in the episode, and found that his incompetence at handling computers is &quot;comedic gold&quot;. Casey Burchby, another reviewer for DVD Talk, also enjoyed the social satire in the episode, and although he found the parody of &quot;The Prisoner&quot; &quot;bizarre&quot;, he maintained that it was &quot;bold&quot;.

Writing for DVD Verdict, Mac MacEntire argued that the episode is &quot;hilarious&quot;, provided one has seen &quot;The Prisoner&quot;. DNA Smith described the episode as &quot;memorable&quot;. The episode is also often considered to be a fan favorite, according to Matt Haigh of &quot;Den of Geek&quot;. On the other hand, DVD Movie Guide&#x27;s Colin Jacobson was less impressed with the episode.

In his review of &quot;The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season&quot;, Jacobson wrote that he enjoyed the episode&#x27;s take on &quot;Internet idiocy&quot;. He wrote, &quot;Some parts of it feel dated, but the web features even more ill-informed opinions today than it did nine years ago, so much of it remains timeless and on target.&quot; However, he was critical of the episode&#x27;s third act. &quot;The side of the show feels like it was intended to amuse a few fans and it doesn’t show a lot of real cleverness or wit&quot;, he wrote. He summarized the episode as being decent, but inconsistent.

<doc id="1020498" wikidata="Q204704" url="?curid=1020498" title="Garrett Eckbo">
<text>Garrett Eckbo (November 28, 1910 – May 14, 2000) was an American landscape architect notable for his seminal 1950 book &quot;Landscape for Living&quot;.

==Youth==
He was born in Cooperstown, New York, to Axel Eckbo, a businessman, and Theodora Munn Eckbo. In 1912, the family moved to Chicago, Illinois. After Eckbo&#x27;s parents divorced, he and his mother relocated to Alameda, California, where they struggled financially while he grew up. After Eckbo graduated from high school in 1929, he felt a lack of ambition and direction and went to stay with a wealthy paternal uncle, Eivind Eckbo, in Norway. It was during his stay in Norway that he began to focus on his future. Once he returned to the U.S., he worked for several years at various jobs saving money so that he could attend college.

==Education==
After attending Marin Junior College for a year, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley where he majored in landscape architecture.

While Eckbo was at Berkeley he was influenced by two of the programs faculty members, H. Leland Vaughan and Thomas Church, who inspired him to move beyond the formalized beaux-arts style that was popular at the time. The Beaux Arts-movement is defined as being carefully planned, richly decorated and being influenced by classical art and architecture. Eckbo graduated with a B.S. in landscape architecture in 1935 and subsequently worked at Armstrong Nurseries in Ontario near Los Angeles where he designed about a hundred gardens in less than a year. After working at the Nurseries, he was restless to expand his creative horizons and entered Harvard University&#x27;s Graduate School of Design by way of a scholarship competition, which he won.

Beginning his studies at Harvard, Eckbo found that the curriculum followed the Beaux-Arts method and was similar to the one at Berkeley but more rigidly entrenched. Eckbo, along with fellow students Dan Kiley and James Rose resisted and began to &quot;explore science, architecture, and art as sources for a modern landscape design.&quot; Eckbo began to take architecture classes with the former Bauhaus director Walter Gropius, who was then head of the architecture department while continuing to take classes in the landscape architecture department. Gropius and Marcel Breuer introduced Eckbo to the idea of the social role in architecture, the link between society and spatial design.

Eckbo was also influenced by the works of several abstract painters, including Wassily Kandinsky, László Moholy-Nagy and Kasimir Malevich. Eckbo would convey a sense of movement in his designs by the layering and massing of plants as inspired by the artists&#x27; paintings.

==Professional work and philosophy==
After receiving his MLA degree from Harvard in 1938, Eckbo returned to California where he worked in the San Francisco Office of the Farm Security Administration. He designed camps for the migrant agricultural workers in California&#x27;s Central Valley. He applied his modernist ideas to these camps attempting to improve the workers living environments. &quot;&#x27;The Grapes of Wrath&#x27; was our bible,&quot; he said of John Steinbeck&#x27;s 1939 novel about farmers dislocated by the dust bowl. &quot;The F.S.A. was a remarkable experience because it had the really creative atmosphere a public agency can have if it&#x27;s not inhibited by some frustrating force.&quot;

Those major organizational plantings of Chinese elms, cottonwoods, mulberries, sycamores and other hardy species were softened with magnolias, oaks and olives for shade and almond and plum trees for color. The landscape architect sees nothing extraordinary about going to such trouble for the dispossessed. &quot;You were conscious of social problems that existed, and you tried to think of ways to improve them,&quot; he said.

During World War II, the agency shifted its focus to housing for defense workers. Mr. Eckbo designed site plans for 50 such settlements on the West Coast. But peace brought a different public attitude. &quot;There were products we wanted to buy, things we wanted to do, a great outflow of energy, demand and desire. Prosperity is bad for morale,&quot; he said. &quot;It makes us greedy.&quot;

Mr. Eckbo had a leading hand in planning what many scholars consider the postwar period&#x27;s finest subdivision scheme, the 256-acre Ladera Housing Cooperative near Palo Alto. But the project was never fully realized without Federal Housing Authority financing, which was probably withheld because the community was racially integrated.

In 1940, Eckbo joined with his brother–in-law, Edward Williams to form the firm Eckbo and Williams. Five years later Robert Royston joined the firm.

In 1946, Eckbo resettled in Los Angeles to take advantage of its growing opportunities for private practice. Never a puritan, he threw himself with gusto into defining the landscape of a new American dream. &quot;L.A. is larger, looser, a place of freer movement socially than the Bay Area,&quot; he said. &quot;The years I spent there were the best of my professional life.&quot;

Mr. Eckbo&#x27;s eagerness to experiment during the 1950s was epitomized by his theatrical Beverly Hills swimming pool design for the owner of Cole of California, the bathing suit company. The landscape architect cantilevered a steel beam spanning the width of the pool to support a masonry wall and a series of concrete diving platforms that allowed models to swim under the backdrop unnoticed and then emerge like Esther Williams from the deep.

In other projects, Mr. Eckbo advanced the quintessential California mode of indoor-outdoor living, casual recreation and the flexible use of space. 
&quot;In the landscape profession,&quot; Mr. Eckbo explained, &quot;small gardens are not seen as our highest aspiration. If you can do a 50-acre park, it must be more important. But for me the private garden has always been a laboratory for developing new ideas and concepts. Any family that has a quarter-acre backyard has got a real project. Any improvement of any space is a step forward.&quot;

Many of Eckbo&#x27;s gardens accompanied well known leading modernist architect housing design, including Raphael Soriano, Richard Neutra and Robert Alexander (including Orange Coast College and were photographed by Julius Shulman.

In 1956, the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA) asked Eckbo to create a garden containing large amounts of aluminum, for the company&#x27;s publicity purposes. Aluminum had been widely used during the war years as a component in airplane manufacture, but ALCOA was interested in promoting the metal&#x27;s peacetime use as well.

In 1963, he returned to Berkeley to head the department of landscape architecture where he had been a student.

The very successful firm of Eckbo, Royston and Williams designed hundreds of projects including residential gardens, planned community developments, urban plazas, churches and college campuses.

He would eventually form the highly successful firm Eckbo, Dean, Austin and Williams in 1964, which in 1973, officially adopted the moniker, EDAW. Guided by a progressive vision of the leadership role of landscape architecture, EDAW became involved in sustainable planning at the regional scale as early as the 1960s when the firm created the California Urban Metropolitan Open Space Plan for the State.

In a period in history when suburban sprawl was ascendant, EDAW&#x27;s open space plan for the state of California was as innovative as it was provocative. The very idea of an &quot;open space plan&quot; was a novel one. The firm drew up plans to preserve open spaces in danger of encroachment on the fringes of the greater Los Angeles-San Diego, Palm Springs, San Francisco Bay and Lake Tahoe areas. In addition to protected county, state and federal lands existing at the time, EDAW&#x27;s plan identified a further 330,000 acres for protection. In strong language, it warned against the automobile and foretold the climate crisis. &quot;A new ethical attitude about land use is needed,&quot; intoned EDAW&#x27;s report, &quot;in order to protect the environment for everyone’s benefit.&quot;

EDAW also began to work internationally, with projects in New Delhi, India (Lodi Park and the Ford Foundation Headquarters) and Osaka, Japan (Civic Center) among other locations worldwide. Eckbo famously said: &quot;design shall be dynamic, not static. Design shall be areal, not axial. Design shall be three dimensional, people live in volumes, not planes.&quot;

Growth in the firm continued apace in the 1970s and &#x27;80s, with new satellite offices in Alexandria, Virginia, and Atlanta, Georgia. In 1979 Eckbo left EDAW, the firm he helped to found. EDAW was acquired by AECOM Technology Corporation in 2005, whose work continuously strives to include cross-disciplinary work and link environmental and social goals to improve quality of life.

Leaving the firm in 1979, Eckbo first formed the firm Garrett Eckbo and Associates and finally Eckbo Kay Associates with Kenneth Kay.

Throughout Eckbo&#x27;s career he maintained his vision of the interaction of art and science to create environments that were functional and livable, while maintaining the social, ecological and cultural approach to design.

In 1964, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1994. In 1968, he signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.

He received numerous awards, including UC Berkeley&#x27;s College of Environmental Design Distinguished Alumnus of 1998, the American Society of Landscape Architects Medal of Honor in 1975, the Architectural League of New York&#x27;s gold medal in 1950 and the American Institute of Architect&#x27;s merit award in 1953. In 1970, he won an American Society of Landscape Architects&#x27; merit award for Lodi Park in New Delhi, India.

&quot;Art emotionalizes the intellect. Science intellectualizes the emotions. Together, they bring order to nature and freedom to man,&quot; he wrote in his 1969 book, &quot;The Landscape We See&quot;.

&quot;Today, one finds the center of city or town only by the increasing height of buildings, the increasing clamor of lights and signs, and the increasing congestion of traffic,&quot; he wrote. &quot;We still build temples and palaces and many other splendid structures, but they are lost in the modern urban jungle.&quot;

&quot;Over the years I&#x27;ve done a lot of flying across the country,&quot; he said in an interview to Martin Filler of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;and from an airplane it looks as if nobody knew what they were doing or where they were building. There&#x27;s a near total absence of physical community in America today, no sequence of qualitative connections and experiences. What we landscape architects are about is to try to bring some intelligence to that pattern.&quot;

Mr. Eckbo&#x27;s great success in doing just that is evident in the more than 1,000 highly varied schemes he produced for clients ranging from migrant farm workers in California&#x27;s Central Valley to Gary Cooper in Beverly Hills. But despite his important role in creating a distinctive new style of American landscape design during the expansive postwar years, when his lively, innovative gardens were the horticultural equivalents of the architecture and furniture of Charles and Ray Eames, Mr. Eckbo is still not as widely known outside certain practical and academic architectural and landscape circles, although his students and colleagues bear testament to his teachings and humanity.
Other books by Eckbo include &quot;Landscape for Living&quot; and &quot;Urban Landscape Design&quot;.

Linda Jewell, professor of landscape architecture at the University of California, Berkeley, where Eckbo taught said Eckbo&#x27;s books always contained numerous illustrations of his observations and theoretical positions. Some of the illustrations reflected actual projects, others were proposals that Eckbo thought should be real, she said.

&quot;He was always an advocate for the underclass,&quot; she said. &quot;Everything he did had a social agenda behind it.&quot;

Eckbo died on May 14, 2000, after a stroke. He was survived by his wife, Arline, of Oakland; daughters Marilyn Kweskin and Alison Peper of Los Angeles; six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

==Teaching==
Eckbo taught at the School of Architecture at the University of Southern California from 1948 to 1956. Among his students were architect Frank Gehry. Gehry credits Eckbo and Simon Eisner, who taught city planning, in encouraging him to follow his &quot;liberal political do-gooder leanings&quot; and apply to Harvard Graduate School of Design for graduate work in city planning: &quot;they also knew I wasn&#x27;t interested in doing rich guys&#x27; houses and that I would be more emotionally inclined toward low-cost housing and planning.&quot;

He was the chairman of the Department of Landscape Architecture at UC Berkeley from 1963 to 1969.

Eckbo&#x27;s social inquiry techniques, environmental, landscape and living teachings have continued to exert influence internationally through the practice of the firms he founded, including the large and international EDAW / AECOM and international students at UC Berkeley, such as Mexican architect and landscape architect Mario Schjetnan.

At the request of UC Berkeley&#x27;s Institute of Governmental Studies, Eckbo wrote &quot;Public Landscape,&quot; ranking architectural and planning successes and failures from the public arena.

In 1997, the UC Berkeley Art Museum mounted a &quot;Garrett Eckbo: Landscape for Living&quot; exhibit.

Though he gave up designing when he turned 80, he continued to write for several years after, including &quot;People in a Landscape&quot;, a summation of humanistic principles that at the time in the decade of the late 1990s may have seemed novel to a generation that grew up in a very different climate for design in the public realm than the social and economic transformations Eckbo lived through during the Great Depression and post war period.

<doc id="1020506" wikidata="Q908920" url="?curid=1020506" title="SoundStorm">
<text>SoundStorm is a brand by Nvidia referring to a SIP block integrating 5.1 surround sound technology found on the die of their nForce and nForce2 chipsets for x86 CPUs. It is also the name of a certification to be obtained from Nvidia when complying with their specifications.

==Certification==
The SoundStorm certification ensured that many manufacturers produced solutions with high quality sound output. To achieve SoundStorm certification, a motherboard had to use the nForce or nForce2 chipsets and also include the specified discrete outputs. It was also necessary to meet certain sound quality levels as tested by Dolby Digital sound labs.

At the time SoundStorm was the only available solution capable of outputting Dolby Digital Live, coveted in home theater PCs.

==Hardware==
The SoundStorm SIP block is said to consist of a series of fixed-function and general-purpose processing units. A fully programmable, Motorola 56300-based digital signal processor (DSP) is provided for effects processing but with very limited support under DirectX on the PC.

The DSP on the APU was normally driven by code largely derived from the 3D audio middleware company Sensaura. The Sensaura middleware was also used by the Windows drivers of nearly every sound card and audio codec other than those by Creative. Unlike the usual software implementations of the Sensaura code, the SoundStorm solution ran the same code on a hardware DSP, which resulted in extremely low CPU usage. It was also capable of real-time Dolby Digital 5.1 encoding. Compared to other audio solutions of the day, the difference in CPU usage when running popular multimedia applications was as much as 10-20%. While the Audigy offers similar performance, it does so at a much higher price point, and only as a discrete add-in solution.

The nForce2 APU was a purely digital component, with motherboard manufacturers still having to use codec chips such as the 650 from Realtek for the audio output functions, and to do the necessary digital to analog conversion (DAC). After the discontinuation of SoundStorm, codec chips such as the Realtek 850 have become standard integrated audio solutions, with audio processing functions offloaded onto the host processor. As such, the quality of the device drivers is important to ensure reasonably low host processor usage, without audio quality issues.

==Drivers==
Since the SoundStorm solution was a general-purpose DSP where code was uploaded to the card by the device drivers at boot time, this made it easy to add new functionality. However, it also had implications of preventing third-party device drivers for the SoundStorm, since they did not have access to the DSP code. Linux drivers for the SoundStorm actually talk directly to the audio codec (like a RealTek ALC650), bypassing the APU completely and doing all audio calculations on the CPU and leaving the SoundStorm DSP idle.

== History ==
=== Video game consoles ===
Reportedly, SoundStorm development was originally funded by Microsoft for use in the Xbox gaming console. At the time of writing reportedly a second generation chip had been developed, this time with funding from Sony, as part of the PlayStation 3 project. It was hinted that SoundStorm may make return to the PC scene, possibly as part of a multimedia graphics card, along the lines of the original NV1 card, rather than as a discrete or onboard solution. While there did appear to be plans for a discrete product at one point, this never materialised.

=== Discontinuation ===
Nvidia decided the cost of including the SoundStorm SIP block on the dies of their chipsets was too high and was not included in nForce3 and beyond.

== Alternatives ==
Other manufacturers have since produced standalone sound cards based on C-Media chips such as the CMI8788 which also provide Dolby Digital and DTS encoding features. These manufacturers include Turtle Beach and Auzentech. A software alternative is redocneXk, which provides real-time AC3 encoding comparable to SoundStorm or Creative&#x27;s Audigy2 and later sound cards.

In October 2013 AMD presented products with AMD TrueAudio. A block of DSPs to be used to offload calculations for 3D sound.

<doc id="1020511" wikidata="Q705343" url="?curid=1020511" title="The Final Cut (2004 film)">
<text>The Final Cut is a 2004 science fiction psychological thriller film written and directed by Omar Naim. It stars Robin Williams, Jim Caviezel, Mira Sorvino, Mimi Kuzyk, Stephanie Romanov, Genevieve Buechner and Brendan Fletcher. The film takes place in a setting where brain implants make it possible to record the sight and sound of entire lives. Williams plays a professional who specializes in editing the memories of unsavory people into uncritical memorials that are played at funerals.

The film won the award for best screenplay at the Deauville American Film Festival and was nominated for best film at the Sitges Film Festival and Berlin International Film Festival.

==Plot==
&quot;Cutters&quot; edit the collected memories of the recently deceased into feature-length memorials that are viewed by loved ones at funerals. The &quot;cutters code&quot; forbids them to mix footage from implants, to sell memories, and to have the implant themselves.

Ten-year-old Alan Hakman, while visiting a city with his parents, meets another boy, Louis, and the two bond as they play together. Louis reluctantly joins Hakman in exploring an abandoned factory, and Hakman crosses a wooden plank suspended high above the ground. Goaded by Hakman, Louis also attempts to cross the plank, but he loses his confidence and falls. Hakman races to the ground and panics when he steps in what he thinks is Louis&#x27;s blood. Hakman flees the scene and tells no one what has happened. Later that day, he leaves the city with his parents.

Years later, the adult Hakman has become a skilled cutter who specializes in editing the memories of controversial people into flattering life stories. When Fletcher, a former cutter, confronts him at a funeral, Hakman describes himself as a sin-eater, who brings redemption to the immoral. Fletcher offers him $500,000 for the memories of his latest client, wealthy businessman Charles Bannister, but Hakman refuses. In a meeting, Fletcher demands the memory recordings so that he can use Bannister, who he suspects was a pedophile, as a scandal to shut down EYE Tech, the implant manufacturer. Hakman again refuses and, worried for his safety, uses his knowledge from memory tapes to shake down a shady criminal for a pistol.

As Hakman works through Bannister&#x27;s memories, he encounters a scene that implies that Bannister was molesting his daughter Isabel, and Hakman wordlessly deletes it. He eventually comes across a person who he is convinced must be his childhood friend Louis. Excited, he sets up a meeting with Bannister&#x27;s family to find out more information. Bannister&#x27;s wife Jennifer is dismissive, but Isabel reveals that the man, recently dead of a car crash, was a teacher named Louis Hunt. Hoping that Hunt had an implant, Hakman organizes a break-in at EYE Tech, but they have no record of Hunt. However, Hakman surprisingly finds a file on himself that contains documentation of his parents&#x27; purchase of an implant for him.

In his distress, Hakman turns to his lover, Delila. At his apartment, he shows her the equipment that he uses to view memories, and he demonstrates surreal footage from a defective implant. He leaves her alone as he seeks help from anti-implant protestors, who have discovered a way to block the implant through specialized body modification. When he returns to find his apartment in disarray, he assumes that Fletcher has broken in; instead, Delila confronts him, having found memory tapes that document her prior relationship. She accuses him of voyeurism and angrily destroys his memory viewer, which results in Bannister&#x27;s files also being damaged.

Fletcher and his associate finally break in, but they find nothing. Hakman tells Bannister&#x27;s wife that the erased footage was lost in an accident, and she feigns disappointment, content to let dirty secrets stay hidden. Hakman asks his colleagues to recover live footage from his own implant, a potentially deadly process. They agree but admonish him that he can never cut memories again; a cutter with an implant is a violation of the &quot;Cutter&#x27;s code&quot;. The recorded memories show that Hakman had attempted to dissuade Louis from crossing the plank, and that he had stepped in red paint, not blood. Hakman, relieved, visits Hunt&#x27;s grave but is confronted again by Fletcher, who has learned about Hakman&#x27;s implant. After chasing Hakman through the graveyard, he hesitates and seems willing to let Hakman go; however, Fletcher&#x27;s associate kills Hakman.

Fletcher loads Hakman&#x27;s memories (which contain the memories of everyone he had viewed as a cutter) into a viewer and promises to use them for the greater good. As he pages through Hakman&#x27;s memories, looking for evidence of Bannister&#x27;s guilt, he sees the young Hakman looking in a mirror.

==Cast==
==Release==
&quot;The Final Cut&quot; premiered on October 15, 2004. It grossed $548,039 domestically and $3,070,786 internationally. Lionsgate Home Entertainment released it on DVD on March 22, 2005.

==Reception==
&quot;The Final Cut&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 37% of 79 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 5.27/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;The Final Cut&quot; fails to make compelling use of its intriguing premise and talented cast, settling for a middling sci-fi drama that never justifies its pretensions.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 43 out of 100 based on 22 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; rated it 3 stars out of 4, and wrote that &quot;the movie never really finds its way out of the dilemmas it has created&quot;, but that Williams&#x27;s acting saves it from these issues.

Leslie Felperin of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that it has &quot;strong visuals&quot; but called it clichéd and poorly acted.

Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that it is poorly edited and features an emotionless performance from Williams.

Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the film fails to deliver on its promising premise.

Daniel W. Kelly of DVD Talk rated it 4½ stars out of 5, and called it &quot;an intriguing, unassuming drama with sci-fi elements that doesn&#x27;t get bogged down in sci-fi overkill&quot;.

<text>David Boris Pall (2 April 1914 – 21 September 2004), founder of Pall Corporation, was the chemist who invented the Pall filter used in blood transfusions.

==Education==
Born in 1914 in Thunder Bay, Ontario of Russian immigrant parents, he grew up on a farm in Saskatchewan. He attended McGill University, from which he was granted a bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemistry and a Ph.D. in physical chemistry.

==Career==
He moved to New York City in 1938 and became a part of the Manhattan Project. Pall worked on the design a filter to separate uranium 235 from uranium 238 using sintered stainless steel mesh.

In 1946, he established Pall Corporation. The company&#x27;s initial focus was on the development of filters for use in aircraft hydraulics. However, in 1959, when Dr. Pall&#x27;s first wife, Josephine, died of aplastic anemia, he began to work on the &quot;Pall filter&quot;. Mrs. Pall had undergone multiple blood transfusions in the course of an illness, which were ultimately unsuccessful. His Pall filter was designed to make blood transfusions significantly safer by filtering out white blood cells, thereby reducing the incidence of transfusion reactions and viral infections.

Pall expanded the business, adding additional products. Today, Pall Corporation has sales in excess of $2.0 Billion.

==Achievements==
In his lifetime, Dr. Pall received over 180 patents and in 1990, he received the United States National Medal of Technology from President George H. W. Bush.

Pall was a trustee of the North Shore University Hospital.

==Death and legacy==
Pall died of complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease at his last home in Roslyn Estates, New York.

Pall&#x27;s grandson is music producer Alex Pall of The Chainsmokers.

<doc id="1020524" wikidata="Q6179710" url="?curid=1020524" title="Jens Jensen (politician)">
<text>Jens August Jensen (2 May 1865 – 16 November 1936) was an Australian politician who served in the House of Representatives from 1910 to 1919. He was a minister in the governments of Andrew Fisher and Billy Hughes, serving as Minister for the Navy from 1915 to 1917 and Minister for Trade and Customs from 1917 to 1918.

==Early life==
Jensen was born on 2 May 1865 in Sebastopol, Victoria, on the outskirts of Ballarat. He was the third son of Anna Marie Christine () and Anthon Jensen, Danish immigrants who had immigrated to Australia during the Victorian gold rush. His father was reputedly a veteran of the First Schleswig War between Denmark and Germany.

Jensen attended state schools until the age of 11, when he began working as a stable boy. He moved to Beaconsfield, Tasmania, in 1878 and worked as a rabbit hawker and miner; he eventually gained his engine driver&#x27;s certificate. In 1885, Jensen married Elizabeth Frances Broadhurst. The couple had one son and four daughters before her death in 1894. He remarried in 1896 to Bertha Hopton, with whom he had another son and daughter. Also in 1896, Jensen built a hotel and theatre in Beaconsfield. He later opened a larger establishment at Beauty Point, and bought an orchard nearby. He was elected to the Beaconsfield Town Council in 1899.

==Political career==

===State politics===
Jensen was elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly at the 1903 state election, winning the seat of George Town. He was a member of the Launceston branch of the Reform League, one of Tasmania&#x27;s earliest formal political organisations. In parliament he supported the faction of liberal democrats associated with William Propsting, who formed a government after the election.

In June 1903, Jensen was admitted to the membership of the Tasmanian Workers&#x27; Political League – the forerunner of the Australian Labor Party in Tasmania – after attending the organisation&#x27;s inaugural state conference and signing the pledge required of parliamentary members. He was re-elected in George Town as an endorsed Labor candidate at the 1906 state election, before transferring to the new multi-member seat of Wilmot at the 1909 election. He was appointed Chief Secretary in John Earle&#x27;s eight-day government in June 1909, the first time the ALP had held office in Tasmania.

===Federal politics===
In February 1910 he resigned from the House of Assembly and won the seat of Bass in the House of Representatives at the April 1910 election. He served as an Assistant Minister and then in July 1915 he became the first Minister for the Navy in the Fisher and Hughes governments. When a group of pro-conscription ALP members under Billy Hughes broke away in the 1916 Labor split to form the National Labor Party, Jensen joined them. Hughes retained government after the split, and Jensen was appointed Minister for Trade and Customs.

As trade minister, Jensen was involved in the creation of an independent Australian trade commissioner service. In June 1918 he published &quot;an extensive report on Australia&#x27;s trade representation abroad that would link with but not rely upon the British consular service&quot;. It proposed the appointment of Australian trade commissioners in Canada, Japan, Russia, South Africa and the United States, and the creation of a bureau of trade information within the Department of Trade and Customs. The bureau was subsequently established as the Bureau of Commerce and Industry, while a Board of Trade was also created in 1918 modelled on the British equivalent.

Along with the other members of National Labor, Jensen joined the Commonwealth Liberal Party in forming the Nationalist Party of Australia. In 1918, Jensen was investigated by the Royal Commission on Navy and Defence Administration. When the Commission found against him, he was forced to resign from the ministry. He subsequently lost his endorsement to contest his seat at the 1919 election. Though he attempted to contest the seat as an independent, he was defeated by the endorsed Nationalist candidate, Syd Jackson.

Jensen subsequently shifted to state politics, elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly seat of Bass in 1922. After losing his seat in 1925, he rejoined the ALP in 1927, and was elected for Wilmot, holding it until 1934.

==Personal life==

In 1885, Jensen married Elizabeth Broadhurst, with whom he had five children. He was widowed in 1894 and remarried in 1896 to Bertha Hopton, a domestic servant. He had three further children from his second marriage, one of whom predeceased him, and according to the &quot;Australian Dictionary of Biography&quot; was &quot;at times violent at home and showed his second wife little affection&quot;.

Jensen suffered from diabetes later in life and died of cerebrovascular disease on 16 November 1936 at a private hospital in Caulfield South, Victoria.

===Affair and will dispute===
Jensen had a long-running extramarital affair with his cousin Maggie Jane Gilbert. He formally separated from his second wife in 1927 and paid her alimony, although she had reportedly instituted divorce proceedings shortly before his death. Jensen settled the majority of his estate on Gilbert, with four of his children subsequently lodging a caveat against the will on the grounds of undue influence.

In their suit, Jensen&#x27;s children alleged that he had fathered a daughter out of wedlock with Gilbert, and that he had attempted to arrange a marriage between this daughter and one of his legitimate sons, who were half-siblings. They further alleged that Jensen had given Gilbert almost all of his property and wealth prior to his death, including a block of flats at Beauty Point, an estate in northern Tasmania, and valuable shareholdings. Jensen&#x27;s widow Bertha was called as a witness and stated that her husband had physically abused their children, including with a horsewhip, as well as alleging that Gilbert had tried to poison him.

The presiding judge Charles Duffy ultimately granted probate and removed the caveat, finding that the claim of undue influence had not been made out although he accepted the evidence of Jensen&#x27;s widow and children as to his character and personal life.

<doc id="1020528" wikidata="Q471402" url="?curid=1020528" title="Richard Marquand">
<text>Richard Alfred Marquand (22 September 1937 – 4 September 1987) was a British film and television director active in both US and UK film productions, best known for directing the 1983 space opera &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, the final film in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy. He also directed the 1981 drama film &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot;, the quiet Paris set romance &quot;Until September&quot;, and the 1985 thriller &quot;Jagged Edge&quot;.

==Early life==
Marquand was born in Llanishen, Cardiff, Wales. He was the son of Rachel E. (née Rees) and Hilary Marquand, an economist and Labour MP who served as Minister of Pensions and later Minister of Health under Prime Minister Clement Attlee. He is the younger brother of David Marquand, who also served as a Labour MP.

Marquand was educated at Emanuel School, London, the University of Aix-Marseille in France and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he studied modern languages, and where one of his tutors was E. M. Forster. During National Service he studied Mandarin and was posted to Hong Kong where he also read the news on the English language Hong Kong Television.

==Career==
By late 1966, Marquand had begun a career directing television documentaries for the BBC, where he worked on projects such as the 1972 series &quot;Search for the Nile&quot; and an edition of &quot;One Pair of Eyes&quot; (1968), about the novelist Margaret Drabble who had been a friend of his at Cambridge. He collaborated with the celebrated foreign correspondent James Cameron on a long-running series called &quot;Cameron Country&quot; for BBC television and also with John Pilger on a series of films for ITV. In 1979, Marquand incorporated many of his documentary techniques in his biographical television movie &quot;Birth of the Beatles&quot;. He directed several films specifically for children including the 1977 Emmy winning &quot;Big Henry and the Polka Dot Kid&quot;.

On the strength of his direction of the 1981 feature, &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot;, Marquand was hired by writer-producer George Lucas to direct &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. In his commentary track on the DVD, Lucas explains that Marquand &quot;had done some great suspense films and was really good with actors. &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot; was the film I&#x27;d seen that he had done that impressed me the most, it was really nicely done and had a lot of energy and suspense.&quot; For his work on the film, Marquand won a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation in 1984.

Marquand subsequently directed the 1985 courtroom thriller &quot;Jagged Edge&quot;, starring Jeff Bridges and Glenn Close.

==Personal life and death==
In 1960, Marquand married screenwriter Josephine Elwyn-Jones, the daughter of Labour MP Elwyn Jones and author and illustrator Pearl Binder. They had two children, Hannah Rachel and James Elwyn, before they divorced in 1970. James Marquand is a film editor who has also worked as a director. In 1981, Marquand married fellow film director Carol Bell, with whom he had another two children, Sam Adair and Molly Joyce. Marquand was a fan of Liverpool Football Club.

According to a 2014 Wales Online interview with his son James, Marquand wrote a screenplay for &quot;a Welsh western&quot; in the late 1970s at the South Wales branch of Pinewood Studios. The screenplay told the story of a young orphan girl in Victorian Mid Wales who enlists two local men to help her wreak revenge on those who killed her father; Marquand used to tell the story to his children when they were on holiday at the family&#x27;s cottage near Tregaron. Marquand reportedly pitched it to Hollywood producers who expressed interest in making it into a film; however, Marquand declined the offer because the producers insisted the story be relocated to the Rocky Mountains in the United States. In the interview, James Marquand expressed interest in adapting his father&#x27;s screenplay into a film.

On 30 August 1987, Marquand had a stroke at his home in Penshurst. He was taken to Kent and Sussex Hospital in Royal Tunbridge Wells, where he died five days later, on 4 September, at the age of 49. His last film, &quot;Hearts of Fire&quot;, starring Bob Dylan, was released posthumously.

<text>In astrophysics, bow shocks are shock waves in regions where the conditions of density and pressure change dramatically due to blowing stellar wind. Bow shock occurs when the magnetosphere of an astrophysical object interacts with the nearby flowing ambient plasma such as the solar wind. For Earth and other magnetized planets, it is the boundary at which the speed of the stellar wind abruptly drops as a result of its approach to the magnetopause. For stars, this boundary is typically the edge of the astrosphere, where the stellar wind meets the interstellar medium.

==Description==

The defining criterion of a shock wave is that the bulk velocity of the plasma drops from &quot;supersonic&quot; to &quot;subsonic&quot;, where the speed of sound cs is defined by
formula_1
where formula_2 is the ratio of specific heats, formula_3 is the pressure, and formula_4 is the density of the plasma.

A common complication in astrophysics is the presence of a magnetic field. For instance, the charged particles making up the solar wind follow spiral paths along magnetic field lines. The velocity of each particle as it gyrates around a field line can be treated similarly to a thermal velocity in an ordinary gas, and in an ordinary gas the mean thermal velocity is roughly the speed of sound. At the bow shock, the bulk forward velocity of the wind (which is the component of the velocity parallel to the field lines about which the particles gyrate) drops below the speed at which the particles are gyrating.

==Around the Earth==
The best-studied example of a bow shock is that occurring where the Sun&#x27;s wind encounters Earth&#x27;s magnetopause, although bow shocks occur around all planets, both unmagnetized, such as 
Mars and Venus and magnetized, such as Jupiter or Saturn. Earth&#x27;s bow shock is about thick and located about from the planet.

==At comets==

Bow shocks form at comets as a result of the interaction between the solar wind and the cometary ionosphere. Far away from the Sun, a comet is an icy boulder without an atmosphere. As it approaches the Sun, the heat of the sunlight causes gas to be released from the cometary nucleus, creating an atmosphere called a coma. The coma is partially ionized by the sunlight, and when the solar wind passes through this ion coma, the bow shock appears.

The first observations were made in the 1980s and 90s as several spacecraft flew by comets 21P/Giacobini–Zinner, 1P/Halley, and 26P/Grigg–Skjellerup. It was then found that the bow shocks at comets are wider and more gradual than the sharp planetary bow shocks seen at Earth, for example. These observations were all made near perihelion when the bow shocks already were fully developed.

The Rosetta spacecraft followed comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko from far out in the solar system, at a heliocentric distance of 3.6 AU, in toward perihelion at 1.24 AU, and back out again. This allowed Rosetta to observe the bow shock as it formed when the outgassing increased during the comet&#x27;s journey toward the Sun. In this early state of development the shock was called the &quot;infant bow shock&quot;. The infant bow shock is asymmetric and, relative to the distance to the nucleus, wider than fully developed bow shocks.

==Around the Sun==

For several decades, the solar wind has been thought to form a bow shock at the edge of the heliosphere, where it collides with the surrounding interstellar medium. Moving away from the Sun, the point where the solar wind flow becomes subsonic is the termination shock, the point where the interstellar medium and solar wind pressures balance is the heliopause, and the point where the flow of the interstellar medium becomes subsonic would be the bow shock. This solar bow shock was thought to lie at a distance around 230 AU from the Sun – more than twice the distance of the termination shock as encountered by the Voyager spacecraft.

However, data obtained in 2012 from NASA&#x27;s Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) indicates the lack of any solar bow shock. Along with corroborating results from the Voyager spacecraft, these findings have motivated some theoretical refinements; current thinking is that formation of a bow shock is prevented, at least in the galactic region through which the Sun is passing, by a combination of the strength of the local interstellar magnetic-field and of the relative velocity of the heliosphere.

==Around other stars==

In 2006, a far infrared bow shock was detected near the AGB star R Hydrae.

Bow shocks are also a common feature in Herbig Haro objects, in which a much stronger collimated outflow of gas and dust from the star interacts with the interstellar medium, producing bright bow shocks that are visible at optical wavelengths.

The Hubble Space Telescope captured these images of bow shocks made of dense gasses and plasma in the Orion Nebula.

== Around massive stars ==
If a massive star is a runaway star, it can form an infrared bow-shock that is detectable in 24 μm and sometimes in 8μm of the Spitzer Space Telescope or the W3/W4-channels of WISE. In 2016 Kobulnicky et al. created the largest spitzer/WISE bow-shock catalog to date with 709 bow-shock candidates. To get a larger bow-shock catalog The Milky Way Project (a Citizen Science project) aims to map infrared bow-shocks in the galactic plane. This larger catalog will help to understand the stellar wind of massive stars.

The closest stars with infrared bow-shocks are:

Most of them belong to the Scorpius–Centaurus association and Theta Carinae, which is the brightest star of IC 2602, might also belong to the Lower Centaurus–Crux subgroup. Epsilon Persei does not belong to this stellar association.

==Magnetic draping effect==
A similar effect, known as the magnetic draping effect, occurs when a super-Alfvénic plasma flow impacts an unmagnetized object such as what happens when the solar wind reaches the ionosphere of Venus: the flow deflects around the object draping the magnetic field along the wake flow.

The condition for the flow to be super-Alfvénic means that the relative velocity between the flow and object, formula_5, is larger than the local Alfvén velocity formula_6 which means a large Alfvénic Mach number: formula_7. For unmagnetized and electrically conductive objects, the ambient field creates electric currents inside the object, and into the surrounding plasma, such that the flow is deflected and slowed as the time scale of magnetic dissipation is much longer than the time scale of magnetic field advection. The induced currents in turn generate magnetic fields that deflect the flow creating a bow shock. For example, the ionospheres of Mars and Venus provide the conductive environments for the interaction with the solar wind. Without an ionosphere, the flowing magnetized plasma is absorbed by the non-conductive body. The latter occurs, for example, when the solar wind interacts with the Moon which has no ionosphere. In magnetic draping, the field lines are wrapped and draped around the leading side of the object creating a narrow sheath which is similar to the bow shocks in the planetary magnetospheres. The concentrated magnetic field increases until the ram pressure becomes comparable to the magnetic pressure in the sheath:
:formula_8

where formula_9 is the density of the plasma, formula_10 is the draped magnetic field near the object, and formula_11 is the relative speed between the plasma and the object. Magnetic draping has been detected around planets, moons, solar coronal mass ejections, and galaxies.
