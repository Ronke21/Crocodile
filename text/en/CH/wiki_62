<text>The Doug Anthony All Stars (or Doug Anthony Allstars, DAAS, D.A.A.S. or stylised as D⋆A†A☭S) were an Australian musical comedy group who initially performed together between 1984 and 1994. The group were an acoustic trio, originally comprising Paul McDermott and Tim Ferguson on main vocals and Richard Fidler on guitar and backing vocals. The group reformed in 2014, with Paul Livingston (aka &quot;Flacco&quot;) replacing Fidler on guitar.

DAAS were known for their aggressive, provocative style, their habit of involving audience members and their tendency to attack topical and sometimes controversial issues in their comedy.

DAAS began performing as buskers on the streets of Canberra in 1984, while they were attending university. After winning the Pick of the Fringe award at the 1986 Adelaide Fringe Festival, the group relocated from Canberra to Melbourne. After performing at Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1987 they gained popularity in the United Kingdom, where they made numerous television appearances and performed several times on the UK&#x27;s Channel 4 late-night alternative comedy show &quot;Viva Cabaret&quot;. In 1989 they were made regular performers on the Australian comedy show &quot;The Big Gig&quot;. They remained a popular feature of the show until 1991 when they left to create their own ABC comedy series, &quot;DAAS Kapital&quot;.

The group released four live recordings and one studio album, &quot;DAAS Icon&quot;, which achieved some independent success in Australia but was briefly banned in Britain. They also released a collection of dark short stories in 1989, titled &quot;Book&quot;, which took a markedly different tone from their comedic stage performances. They also made two live concert videos and one film, &quot;The Edinburgh Years&quot;. The group split up in 1994, following a final farewell tour of Australia. Although they reunited in 2003 to perform together at a benefit concert, were interviewed together in 2008 in support of their DVD, and reunited for a one-off show to launch the &quot;DAAS Kapital&quot; DVD in 2013, the three ruled out the suggestion of a reunion tour at the time.

After an hiatus, McDermott, Ferguson and Paul Livingston (performing the role of Fidler) performed &quot;as DAAS&quot; for their 30th anniversary at the Canberra Comedy Festival, held in March 2014.

The group have been inactive since the end of 2017.

==Style==

DAAS employ an aggressive, confrontational style, which author and journalist Geoff Bartlett describes as &quot;[pushing] the boundaries of humour and good taste to their absolute limits&quot;. They frequently delve into topical and taboo subject matter with songs such as &quot;Commies for Christ&quot; and &quot;I Fuck Dogs&quot;. &quot;Long before anyone knew the term, one of our greatest driving forces was to be politically incorrect,&quot; said Ferguson. Each band member developed distinctive onstage characters, with McDermott adopting a nasty, mean persona, while Ferguson played a narcissistic character who was &quot;gorgeous but stupid&quot;. Fidler initially played the straight man, but as the group became more aggressive he developed into a character who was naturally happy and caring but frequently victimised by his fellow band members.

The group drew inspiration from short-lived punk bands like the Fat Sluts, The Lone Reagans and Forbidden Mule, whom Ferguson describes as &quot;like all punk bands... very fast and furious.&quot; Much of the band&#x27;s provocative style emerged from their origins as street performers, where to get people&#x27;s attention they resorted to outrageous or theatrical tactics—the group would sometimes walk into the street and stop traffic to get noticed. &quot;Sometimes we have to do really ugly or horrendous things to get people&#x27;s attention, and we&#x27;re not afraid to do that. We&#x27;ll hit someone if it gets a bit of discourse going,&quot; said McDermott.

Neil Pigot, who did some work with the group, describes their style as &quot;a sort of extension of the Python tradition, but very much in an Australian context.&quot; He says that DAAS were &quot;crucially important&quot; in the development of Australian comedy, directly contributing to the styles of successful comedy shows such as &quot;The D-Generation&quot;, &quot;Fast Forward&quot; and &quot;Wogs Out of Work&quot;. At the time DAAS emerged, Pigot says, comedy in Australia was dominated by joke-tellers and impersonators. By contrast, DAAS were belligerent and confrontational, frequently attacking topical issues, invading people&#x27;s personal space and involving the audience in their act. Mark Trevorrow, who frequently collaborated with the group, described their work as &quot;true genius.&quot; &quot;Their great shows were among the greatest evenings I&#x27;ve witnessed in my life and their worst shows were among the worst,&quot; he said. &quot;They&#x27;d whip up an audience and appeal to people&#x27;s darker side. It was very Dada, what they were doing. And what happens with that is you&#x27;re just as often likely to have people who want to kill you as applaud you.&quot; In addition, ABC comedy producer Ted Robinson says that the group played an important role in raising the profile of Australian comedy overseas, particularly in Britain where DAAS were very popular. British comedian Al Murray said of seeing the group at the Edinburgh Festival in 1988, &quot;they came onstage with the attitude of feral invaders and left it with no taboo untouched.&quot; Murray described the All Stars as &quot;an insanely hot act from Oz who sang, cursed, sweated and insulted each other and their audiences with a level of commitment and polish that seemed exotically charged and almost transgressive in the late 80s.&quot;

DAAS were known for continuing to act, or to remain in character, during interviews. Much of this was just banter, but they also had serious messages. DAAS were often criticising the media and part of this was to tell outrageous lies to journalists during interviews and attempt to see them published as fact. In one of the best-known instances of this, the group told British reporters that their namesake, former Australian politician Doug Anthony, was a much-loved Prime Minister of Australia who had been assassinated on 11 November 1975, by right-wing extremists. (In fact, Anthony is a former Deputy Prime Minister of Australia who had led the right-of-center National Party of Australia from 1971 to 1984.) The lie was printed in &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot;. This game continued undetected until in 1990 the group told a reporter that they had been cast in &quot;Batman&quot; and had become great friends with Jack Nicholson, both lies. The story was reported as fact in newspapers around Australia and appeared as a cover story in the TV guide of Melbourne&#x27;s &quot;Herald Sun&quot; before the media realised the hoax.

==History==

===Early years===
Tim Ferguson met Richard Fidler busking on the streets of Canberra in 1984, while they were both attending university. Ferguson recalls: &quot;Richard was playing the guitar—something from Cat Stevens—one day and I walked up to him and we did &#x27;Wild Thing&#x27;. I sang a few lyrics and jumped about like a mad thing. Lo and behold we made a stack of money in ten minutes.&quot; The two began performing together and joined with another friend, Robert Piper, to form the Doug Anthony All Stars. They derived their name from Doug Anthony, a former Country Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. According to Fidler, during their earlier gigs in clubs and as street performers, Ferguson was &quot;a bit of an explosive hippie&quot; while Fidler and Piper were more reserved. Robert Piper left the group in 1985 due to other commitments. Piper has gone on to a successful career with the United Nations and in March 2013 was named Deputy Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process and the humanitarian coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory.

With Piper&#x27;s departure, Paul McDermott, who performed at one of DAAS&#x27;s regular clubs, was invited to join. He accepted, although he did not like their material, which he considered too sweet. Fidler says McDermott changed the group&#x27;s dynamic; he wrote the majority of their songs and prompted a darker tone. After winning the Pick of the Fringe award at the 1986 Adelaide Fringe Festival, the group relocated from Canberra to Melbourne, where they based themselves with a regular gig at the Prince Patrick Hotel in Collingwood, in an effort to save enough money to travel to the Edinburgh Fringe. Initially, DAAS found that Melbourne audiences did not respond to their act and to provoke a reaction they became more aggressive, with McDermott and Ferguson adopting more abusive personas and often picking on Fidler&#x27;s naturally happy but stupid character. They made their first overseas performance at the Edinburgh Fringe in 1987, to sold out crowds.

===Successes===
Following their Edinburgh Fringe shows, the group enjoyed considerable success in the United Kingdom, making appearances on numerous BBC comedy shows. In 1988, the group was nominated for the Perrier Comedy Award for their performances at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Fidler says that the British people were more receptive to their act at the time than Australians had been. &quot;The whole thing exploded for us when we got there, it was quite incredible. Within a very short time we were doing national television appearances in front of millions of people and playing these enormous shows,&quot; he says. They played extensively in Canada, Germany, America and Britain, and finished their time in Britain by appearing on the final episode of the successful &quot;Friday Night Live&quot;. However, despite the acclaim they were receiving overseas, when they returned to Australia at the end of 1988 they remained unknown. Upon arriving in Melbourne, they struggled to gain a following and went back to busking on the streets.
This changed in 1989 when ABC comedy producer Ted Robinson invited them to appear on a new comedy show, &quot;The Big Gig&quot;. They became a popular feature on the series and appeared in every episode until 1991. In 1989, the group also released a book titled &quot;Book&quot;, which was a collection of dark short stories. Many of the stories had been written several years prior, even before the three had started performing together, and adopted a markedly different tone to their comedic, largely ad libbed live shows. Ferguson said that they had wanted to write something that people could read and enjoy without having seen DAAS perform. &quot;Book&quot; sold 30,000 copies in England within the first two weeks of publication before being banned when DAAS refused to release an edited version of the book or permit a warning sticker on the cover. The issue was taken to court in the same year, where the ban was overturned.

DAAS released their first official album, &quot;DAAS Icon&quot; (1990). Two of the featured songs, &quot;I Want to Spill the Blood of a Hippy&quot; and &quot;Bottle&quot;, were also released as singles. &quot;Icon&quot; went on to become the highest selling independent album in Australia, but was banned in the United Kingdom due to a reference to the IRA in the song &quot;KRSNA&quot;. This was later overturned by a British court. The group continued to appear weekly on &quot;The Big Gig&quot; until 1991 when their own series, &quot;DAAS Kapital&quot;, premiered on the ABC. A futuristic half-hour-long sitcom about the band&#x27;s adventures in an underwater history museum, &quot;DAAS Kapital&quot; ran for two seven-episode seasons between 1991 and 1992 despite a poor critical reaction. From 1992, they became UK-based, returning to Australia for a short time in 1993 to promote &quot;Dead &amp; Alive&quot;, a live recording of one of their London shows which was released on CD and VHS. They played at the opening of the 1992 Barcelona Olympics and appeared regularly on Britain&#x27;s Channel 4 variety show &quot;Viva Cabaret&quot;.

The reformed group returned to tour the United Kingdom in 2016, and won the Spirit of the Fringe Award at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Their show at the Pleasance in Edinburgh was chosen by Steve Bennett, editor of Chortle.co.uk, as the second most memorable comedy gig of 2016.

===Break-up and reformation===
The group held a final farewell tour of Australia in 1994, which was recorded and released on CD by ABC Records as &quot;DAAS: The Last Concert&quot;. The break-up sparked rumours of a falling out among the trio, although all three denied this, stating that it was simply time to move on. Richard Fidler described it as a matter of practicality: Ferguson wanted to return to Australia to be closer to his young family, while McDermott and Fidler wished to continue working in Britain as they felt they had done everything they had wanted to do in Australia.
In June 2010, Tim Ferguson revealed that the break-up was due in large part to personal health issues. Unknown to the public at the time, Ferguson had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1996 after experiencing symptoms for several years including a few severe episodes while touring in 1993. The symptoms affected his mobility, causing him to struggle with choreography and physical routines onstage and eventually, he says, &quot;it was clear I couldn&#x27;t remain a Doug Anthony Allstar with whatever this was&quot;. Still coming to terms with his diagnosis, Ferguson chose to keep it private, telling few people outside of his close friends and family. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want other people to know,&quot; he says. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want it to be coming up in conversation with strangers.&quot;

In July 2003, DAAS reunited for the first time since their break-up to perform at a special gala comedy event called &quot;For Holly&quot;. Dedicated to the memory of Holly Robinson—a casting director for &quot;Home and Away&quot; and the daughter of &quot;The Big Gig&quot;″s Ted Robinson—who had died of cancer the month before, the concert was a fundraising benefit for research into the disease. At Holly&#x27;s request, the three also performed the Hunters &amp; Collectors&#x27; &quot;Throw Your Arms Around Me&quot;, a song they had frequently covered in the group&#x27;s later years, at her funeral.
A DAAS DVD titled &quot;The Unlimited Uncollectible Sterling Deluxe Edition&quot;, a 2-disc collection of their performances from the first two seasons of &quot;The Big Gig&quot;, was released on 6 November 2008. Ferguson, Fidler and McDermott recorded a commentary track for the DVD and made several media appearances together to promote its release, but the three ruled out the prospect of a reunion tour. &quot;We certainly catch up for barbecues, but not as a comedy group,&quot; McDermott said.

DAAS reunited for a one-off show to launch the DVD of the television series &quot;DAAS Kapital&quot; on 13 April 2013 as part of the Melbourne International Comedy Festival.

After an hiatus, McDermott, Ferguson and Paul Livingston (performing the role of Fidler) performed &quot;as DAAS&quot; for their 30th anniversary at the Canberra Comedy Festival, held in March 2014. They eventually embarked on several tours of Australia and the United Kingdom.

Although Fidler had been advocating for the group to reform for years, his work commitments with ABC Radio prevented him from participating and Livingston again filled his place as the group&#x27;s guitarist.

In 2016, Livingston wrote a memoir titled &quot;D.A.A.S.: Their Part in My Downfall&quot;, which chronicled his association with the group in the 1980s and 1990s as a support act and collaborator, and then as a member of the reformed group.

On 2 and 9 October 2018, the ABC screened &quot;Tick Fucking Tock&quot;, a two-part documentary about the Doug Anthony All Stars covering their formation, history, breakup and reformation.

===Subsequent work===

Initially, McDermott was not interested in further pursuing comedy, which he came to regard as an &quot;aberration&quot;. However in 1996, he returned to television after being recruited by Ted Robinson to host the satirical news-based quiz show &quot;Good News Week&quot;. McDermott hosted the show until its cancellation in 2000 and returned to this role when the series was renewed in 2008. He reunited with Robinson again in 2007 when he was named host of a new ABC variety program, &quot;The Sideshow&quot;, a show described as a successor to &quot;The Big Gig&quot;. Although it quickly built a strong cult audience, the show did not rate well and was cancelled after its initial run of 26 episodes.

In addition to his television work, McDermott has continued to be involved in live comedy. He has frequently participated in the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, having often captained one of the two competing teams in the festival&#x27;s Great Debate since his first debate appearance in 1994. At the 2002 festival he not only presented a solo comedy show titled &quot;Comedyoscopy&quot;, but also performed with Cameron Bruce and Mick Moriarty in a music-based comedy trio called GUD. McDermott described GUD as being in a similar vein to DAAS in that it revolved around music, comedy and the inter-relationships between the band members onstage. As of 2018, McDermott is host of ABC quiz show &quot;Think Tank&quot;.

In 1996, Ferguson hosted the Nine Network&#x27;s comedy game show &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget Your Toothbrush&quot;, and after the show&#x27;s cancellation Nine kept him on to develop new television pilots. However, the network was not sure how best to use his talents, and Ferguson left to pursue other work. During this time, he wrote his first novel, &quot;Left, Right and Centre: A Tale of Greed, Sex and Power&quot;, a political satire. His subsequent television credits have included &quot;Unreal TV&quot;, &quot;Big Brother&quot;, &quot;Funky Squad&quot; and &quot;Shock Jock&quot;, a 2001 cable sitcom which he also wrote and produced. He has also built a strong career as a corporate event performer and was a sessional lecturer at RMIT University, where he taught narrative comedy for the Professional Screenwriting Advanced Diploma. In 2010, he released a guide to comedy writing, &quot;The Cheeky Monkey: Writing Narrative Comedy&quot;. In 2010, Ferguson hosted and co-produced &quot;WTF – With Tim Ferguson&quot;, a comedy chat show on community television station C31 Melbourne.

In 2015, Ferguson co-wrote and co-directed the feature film &quot;Spin Out&quot;, which was released by Sony Pictures in 2016. He has co-written and produced a performance piece for orchestras, &quot;Billie and the Dinosaurs&quot;, which will debut in early 2018 at the Music for Canberra community school of which he is a patron.

After leaving DAAS, Fidler became heavily involved in computers and multimedia. In 1996, he wrote the award-winning CD-ROM &quot;Real Wild Child&quot;, a history of Australian rock and roll. Fidler also wrote a regular monthly column for &quot;internet.au&quot; magazine on the digital media world, and contributed an essay to the &quot;Australian Constitutional Convention&quot; website . Although he had not initially intended to return to television, he has hosted various TV shows since 1996, including &quot;Race Around the World&quot;, &quot;Aftershock&quot;, &quot;Mouthing Off&quot; and &quot;Vulture&quot;; and spent three years in management as an editor of ABC-TV comedy before deciding he &quot;wasn&#x27;t cut out to be a manager&quot;. In 2005, Fidler ventured into radio, fronting the 7–10pm shift on ABC Local Radio station 612 ABC Brisbane. Since 2006, he has hosted the 11 am–3pm shift on 612 ABC Brisbane, with the show&#x27;s first hour—known as &quot;The Conversation Hour&quot;—also broadcast on 702 ABC Sydney. He currently co-hosts &quot;Conversations&quot; (of which he was the founding host) on ABC radio (including Radio National) which is one of the network&#x27;s highest rating broadcasts and podcasts. In 2011, Fidler co-wrote a satirical book on Australian politics titled, &quot;Jack the Insider: The Insider&#x27;s Guide to Power in Australia&quot;, released by Random House Books, New Zealand.

Original and founding member Robert Piper entered into a very successful career with the United Nations, serving in Cambodia, New York, Serbia, and other countries, and later worked for the Clinton Administration.

<doc id="1029145" wikidata="Q333555" url="?curid=1029145" title="James Harris, 1st Earl of Malmesbury">
<text>James Harris, 1st Earl of Malmesbury, (21 April 1746 – 21 November 1820) was an English diplomat.

==Early life (1746 – 1768)==
Born at Salisbury, the son of James Harris, an MP and the author of &quot;Hermes&quot;, and Elizabeth Clarke of Sandford, Somerset. He was educated at Winchester, at Merton College, Oxford and did Law and History at the University of Leiden (1765-1767).

==Early diplomatic career: Spain (1768 – 1771)==

Harris arrived in Spain in December 1768 and became secretary to the British embassy at Madrid, and was left as &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; at that court on the departure of Sir James Grey in August 1769 until the arrival of George Pitt, afterwards Lord Rivers. This interval gave him his opportunity; he discovered the intention of Spain to attack the Falkland Islands, and was instrumental in thwarting it by putting on a bold countenance. As a reward he was appointed minister &quot;ad interim&quot; at Madrid.

==Envoy-extraordinary in Berlin (1772 – 1776)==
In January 1772 Harris was appointed envoy-extraordinary to Prussia in Berlin, arriving on 21 February. Within a month of his arrival he became the first diplomat to hear of Frederick the Great&#x27;s partition of Poland with the cooperation of Russia. His service in this office was undistinguished but he made an impression on Frederick, who requested that he be reappointed.

==Marriage (1777)==

Harris married Harriet Maria Amyand (1761 – 20 August 1830), the youngest daughter of Sir George Amyand (1720–1766) and Anna Maria Korteen, and sister of Anna Maria Amyand, who married Sir Gilbert Elliot (later 1st Earl of Minto).

They had four children together:
*Lady Frances Harris (d. 1 November 1847) m. General Sir Galbraith Lowry Cole
*Lady Catherine Harris (d. December 1855) m. General Sir John Bell
*James Edward Harris, 2nd Earl of Malmesbury (19 August 1778 – 10 September 1841) m. Harriet Susan Dashwood
*Rev. Hon. Thomas Alfred Harris (24 March 1782 – 15 December 1823) m. Maria Markham, daughter of George Markham, Dean of York

==Envoy-extraordinary in St Petersburg (1777 – 1783)==
In autumn of 1777, Harris travelled to Russia to be envoy-extraordinary to Russia, an office he held until September 1783. At St Petersburg he made his reputation, for he managed to get on with Catherine II, in spite of her predilections for France, and steered adroitly through the accumulated difficulties of the first Armed Neutrality. He was made a Knight of the Bath at the end of 1778; but in 1782 he returned home owing to ill-health, and was appointed by his friend, Charles James Fox, to be minister at The Hague, an appointment confirmed after some delay by William Pitt the Younger in 1784.

==The Hague (1784 – 1788)==

He did very great service in furthering Pitt&#x27;s policy of maintaining England&#x27;s influence on the Continent by the arms of her allies, and held the threads of the diplomacy which ended in the king of Prussia&#x27;s overthrowing the Patriot republican party in the Dutch Republic, which was inclined to France, and re-establishing the stadtholder William V, Prince of Orange in his dictatorial powers. As envoy, Harris immersed himself in Dutch politics from 1784 on and managed to become the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the Orangist party. He and his French counterpart, Charles Olivier de Saint-Georges de Vérac, the French ambassador to the States General of the Netherlands, fought a secret war with the help of agents of influence, like the then-Grand Pensionary of the province of Zeeland, Laurens Pieter van de Spiegel, and the confidential agent Hendrik August van Kinckel, and spies like Pierre Auguste Brahain Ducange. Harris returned to London in secret at the end of May 1787, where he managed to convince the Cabinet to endorse a policy of subversion in the Dutch Republic, to be funded by £70,000 from a slush fund, laundered through the king&#x27;s Civil list. Harris agents used the money to bribe regiments of the Dutch States Army in the pay of the Patriot States of Holland, that had deposed the stadtholder as Captain-General of that Army, to defect. The counter-measures of the States of Holland precipitated a political crisis that prompted the States to ask for French mediation. The arrest of Princess Wilhelmina, the wife of the stadtholder, on 28 June 1782, gave Prussia and Great Britain an opening to muscle in on this diplomatic mediation, and eventually offered an excuse to intervene militarily. In recognition of his services he was created Baron Malmesbury, of Malmesbury in the County of Wiltshire on 19 September 1788, and permitted by the King of Prussia to bear the Prussian eagle on his arms, and by the Prince of Orange to use his motto &quot;Je maintiendrai&quot;.

In 1786 he told Pitt that France was &quot;an ambitious and restless rival power, on whose good faith we never can rely, whose friendship never can be deemed sincere, and of whose enmity we have the most to apprehend.&quot; He also wrote to Robert Murray Keith: &quot;...from everything I hear and observe, there is not the least doubt that France is working hard at the formation of a League, the object of which, is the Destruction of England.&quot;

The historian Paul Langford has claimed that Harris &quot;proved brilliantly effective as a focus for Orangist and anti-French feeling, and as the agent of Anglo-Prussian cooperation&quot;.

==Wilderness (1788 – 1793)==
He returned to England and took an anxious interest in politics, which ended in his seceding from the Whig party with the Duke of Portland in 1793.

==French Revolutionary War (1793 – 1797)==
In that year he was sent by Pitt, but in vain, to try to keep Prussia true to the first coalition against France. In 1794, he was sent to Brunswick to solicit the hand of the unfortunate Princess Caroline of Brunswick for the Prince of Wales, to marry her as proxy, and conduct her to her husband in England. For once his diplomatic skills seem to have failed him: confronted with Caroline&#x27;s bizarre manner and appearance, he sent no advance word to the Prince, who was so shocked by the sight of his future wife that he asked Malmesbury to bring him brandy.

===French peace missions===

In 1796 and 1797 he was in Paris vainly negotiating with the French Directory, and then in Lille in summer 1797 for equally fruitless negotiations with John Skey Eustace and the Directory&#x27;s plenipotentiaries Hugues-Bernard Maret, Georges René Le Peley de Pléville and Etienne Louis François Honoré Letourner.

Due to bad roads in France, Malmesbury reached Paris on 22 October 1796, a week after leaving London. This led the foremost opponent of peace with France, Edmund Burke, to quip that his journey was slow because &quot;he went the whole way on his knees&quot;.

==Later life (1798 – 1820)==
After 1797, he became partially deaf, and quit diplomacy altogether; but for his long and eminent services he was on 29 December 1800 created Earl of Malmesbury and Viscount FitzHarris of Hurn Court in the County of Southampton.

He now became a sort of political Nestor, consulted on foreign policy by successive foreign ministers, trusted by men of the most different ideas in political crises, and above all the confidant, and for a short time after Pitt&#x27;s death almost the political director, of Canning. Younger men were also wont to go to him for advice, and Lord Palmerston particularly, who was his ward, was tenderly attached to him, and owed many of his ideas on foreign policy directly to his teaching. His later years were free from politics, and until his death on 21 November 1820 he lived very quietly and almost forgotten.

His monument in Salisbury Cathedral was sculpted by Francis Chantrey.

==Legacy==
As a statesman, Malmesbury had an influence among his contemporaries which is scarcely to be understood from his writings, but which must have owed much to personal charm of manner and persuasiveness of tongue; as a diplomatist, he seems to have deserved his reputation, and shares with Macartney, Auckland and Whitworth the credit of raising diplomacy from a profession in which only great nobles won the prizes to a career opening the path of honour to ability. One historian called him &quot;the greatest English diplomat of the eighteenth century.&quot; Paul Langford has claimed that Malmesbury &quot;was by any standards a brilliant diplomat as well as an experienced one. Though he was not disposed to undervalue himself, neither were others; Talleyrand considered him the ablest British diplomat of the age and certainly his achievement at the Hague was to sustain such a judgement&quot;.

Malmesbury remarked that it was &quot;a truth inculcated into John Bull with his mother&#x27;s milk, viz. that France is our natural enemy&quot;. He said on another occasion that &quot;The history of the present century afforded repeated proofs, that the English fought and conquered less for themselves than for the sake of their allies, and to preserve that equilibrium of power, on which the fate of all Europe depends&quot;.

Malmesbury did not publish anything himself, except an account of the Dutch revolution, and an edition of his father&#x27;s works, but his important &quot;Diaries&quot; (1844) and &quot;Letters&quot; (1870) were edited by his grandson.

He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for Christchurch from 1770 to 1774 and from 1780 to 1788.

His former residence Malmesbury House in Salisbury takes its name from his title.

<text>The Gault Formation is a geological formation of stiff blue clay deposited in a calm, fairly deep-water marine environment during the Lower Cretaceous Period (Upper and Middle Albian). It is well exposed in the coastal cliffs at Copt Point in Folkestone, Kent, England, where it overlays the Lower Greensand formation, and underlies the Upper Greensand Formation. These represent different facies, with the sandier parts probably being deposited close to the shore and the clay in quieter water further from the source of sediment; both are believed to be shallow-water deposits.

The etymology of the name is uncertain and probably of local origin.

==Distribution==
It is found in exposure on the south side of the North Downs and the north side of the South Downs. It is also to be found beneath the scarp of the Berkshire Downs, in the Vale of White Horse, in Oxfordshire, England, and on the Isle of Wight where it is known as Blue Slipper. Gault underlies the chalk beneath the London Basin, generally overlying eroded rocks of Jurassic and Devonian age; lower gault is present only below the outer parts of the basin and is absent under central London. The Gault Formation represents a marine transgression following erosion of the Lower Greensand. It is subdivided into two sections, the Upper Gault and the Lower Gault. The Upper Gault onlaps onto the Lower Gault. The Gault Formation thins across the London Platform and then terminates against the Red Chalk just to the south of The Wash in East Anglia.

The Gault exposure at Copt Point, which is the type locality for the formation, is 40 m in thickness.

==Uses==
The clay has been used in several locations for making bricks, notably near Dunton Green and near Wye in Kent.

Gault often contains numerous phosphatic nodules, some thought to be coprolites, and may also contain sand as well as small grains of the mineral glauconite. Crystals of the mineral selenite are fairly common in places, as are nodules of pyrite.

==Fossils==

Gault yields abundant marine fossils, including ammonites (such as &quot;Hoplites&quot;, &quot;Hamites&quot;, &quot;Euhoplites&quot;, &quot;Anahoplites&quot;, and &quot;Dimorphoplites&quot;), belemnites (such as &quot;Neohibolites&quot;), bivalves (such as &quot;Birostrina&quot; and &quot;Pectinucula&quot;), gastropods (such as &quot;Anchura&quot;), solitary corals, fish remains (including shark teeth), scattered crinoid remains, and crustaceans (such as the crab &quot;Notopocorystes&quot;). Terrestrial fossils that have been found at Gault include fossil wood, a dinosaur (&quot;cf.&quot; &quot;Acanthopholis&quot;), and pterosaurs, including azhdarchoids, ornithocheirids, and the indeterminate pterodactyloid &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; &quot;daviesii&quot;. Several pterosaur fossil remains from the overlying Cambridge Greensand may have been reworked from the underlying Gault.

<text>Stuff Happens is a play by David Hare, written in response to the Iraq War. Hare describes it as &quot;a history play&quot; that deals with recent history. The title is inspired by Donald Rumsfeld&#x27;s response to widespread looting in Baghdad: &quot;Stuff happens and it’s untidy, and freedom’s untidy, and free people are free to make mistakes and commit crimes and do bad things.” (April 11, 2003)

The play presents a mix of viewpoints, including arguments for and against the attack on Iraq. It mixes verbatim re-creations of real speeches, meetings, press conferences and fictionalized versions of private meetings between members of the Bush and Blair administrations. The play also includes international figures such as Hans Blix and Dominique de Villepin. An ensemble cast plays over 40 roles during the 3-hour play, although the actors playing the principals—Bush, Rice, Powell—play only one role.

In 2020, Andy Propst of &quot;Time Out&quot; dubbed &quot;Stuff Happens&quot; &quot;one of the most impressive political dramas to emerge in recent memory&quot; and ranked it the 30th greatest play of all time.

== Characters ==
==Plot and Style==

David Hare&#x27;s &quot;Stuff Happens&quot; is a play about the events that led up to the 2003 Iraq War. The play focuses on the diplomatic side of the war. The play begins at George Bush&#x27;s election in November 2000 and ends around April 2004. Parts of the dialogue are direct quotes from the characters&#x27; real-world counterparts. The play is about real people and real events that had occurred. Hare states that &quot;the events within [the play] have been authenticated from multiple sources, both private and public.&quot; Hare also stated that the dialogue is not “knowingly untrue” but he had to sometimes “use his imagination” to cover events that were not recorded verbatim, admitting that his play is not a documentary as such. The events during the play are as follows:

Act One-

Scene 1 through 3: These scenes serve as an introduction to the play and the characters. Scene 3 focuses specifically on background information on the main characters before the plot begins.

Scene 4: The National Security Council starts the meeting talking about the issues in the Middle East, specifically what&#x27;s going on between the Israelis and the Palestinians. After talking briefly about this issue, Bush then wants to shift the conversation towards Iraq. The CIA believe that Iraq has a plant at an abandoned warehouse to produce chemical or biological weapons. Since there isn&#x27;t enough proof, they are told to look more into the issue.

Scene 5: This whole scene is about an angry journalist. The journalist rants about how Americans ignore how lucky they are to be able to have freedom and instead, they choose to fight with each other and disagree with each other constantly.

Scene 6: Hare describes how the events of 9/11 happen. He gives the exact times the planes crashed into the twin towers and the Pentagon. It is also explained that the 4th plane was meant to hit the White House but the passengers were able to prevent that from happening. This is what started the War on Terror between &quot;the free and democratic world and terrorism.&quot;

Scene 7: The War Cabinet meets at Camp David to discuss future plans going forward. They decide that Afghanistan can be used as an example to show other countries what happens if they try to use terrorism on other countries. Wolfowitz and Rumsfeld believe that the U.S. should take action on Iraq since it will be less of a risk than Afghanistan and still be able to send a message to other countries. Wolfowitz believes that Saddam Hussein is involved with what happened on 9/11.

Scene 8: Bush signs orders to attack Afghanistan with British support. Air strikes attack 31 different Al Qaeda and Taliban targets. When the British were able to track down Bin Laden, they were ordered to pull out which gave him the chance to go into a different hiding spot off the radar. Bush then talks to Rumsfeld privately to discuss going to war with Iraq.

Scene 9: A politician states that the attack on Iraq was controversial and possibly illegal. The British decide that they will no longer back up America after these actions because they believe there wasn&#x27;t a legal cause for attacking Iraq.

Scene 10: It is believed that Iraq was a terrorist ally that was a threat to America. Other countries aren’t taking Bush seriously and don&#x27;t believe he knows what he is doing. Bush and Blair meet privately at Bush&#x27;s ranch to discuss the problems regarding the Middle East. Bush believes that since Afghanistan is done they should just move on to Iraq as a second phase. Blair tries convincing Bush that the support from the UN is needed before they can invade Iraq. The British need evidence that Iraq is actually a threat in order to be able to invade them legally. After their conversation, Bush says to the press that the removal of Saddam is the main goal with his government.

Scene 11: Bush believes that since there are new styles of threats since the UN Charter was created, that means there should be new ways of thinking. Powell meets with Bush and says how he believes that if the U.S. goes in to Iraq without the UN then the U.S. will be in trouble. Powell says that invading will make America look like a dictatorship and put our allies in trouble.

Act 2-

Scene 12: The NSC reassembles and Cheney says that the story should be known as the “Crisis at the UN”  so that it is no longer about America&#x27;s wrongdoing but instead makes it about the UN and whether they can deliver or not.

Scene 13: Palestinians believe that the UN is a double standard because the UN only does things that benefit themselves but ignore what benefits the countries outside of the UN. The UN condemns the idea of terrorism but they allow the countries in the Middle East to murder themselves.

Scene 14: Cheney states on a TV studio that defeating Iraq would be a crucial hit to the base of terrorism before terrorism is able to escalate to nuclear weapons. Blair is still frustrated because he can&#x27;t legally allow Britain to go to war because there isn&#x27;t enough evidence of there being a threat. Blair then tries to get enough information from his resources in order to get enough evidence to make an invasion legal.  Bush addresses to the general assembly that the first time the world finds out that Saddam has nuclear weapons will be when he uses one and it becomes too late.

Scene 15: Powell meets with some members of the UN to discuss Iraq and Saddam. De Villepin thinks that the U.S. decided on the process to invade Iraq without coming up with the purpose for it. The U.S. have been leaving out other countries when it comes to their decisions for the last two years so the rest of the UN are cautious when it comes to making plans with the U.S. The French will help the U.S. if their goal is to disarm Saddam but won&#x27;t help if the goal is to fully invade Iraq.

Scene 16: The House voted 296 to 133 which allows Bush to deploy armed forces when it is necessary and appropriate. The British Parliament believe that Bush will prematurely attack Iraq just to gain more power and oil. Bush however says that he wants to go through the UN and only disarm Saddam, he doesn&#x27;t want there to be a war. The U.S. and the French agree to having the “Resolution 1441” which allows any member state to defend itself against the threat of Iraq.

Scene 17: Iraq inspectors commit to produce a full description of their chemical facilities. Saddam won&#x27;t admit that he has the deadly weapons that the UN are looking for. There is controversy in Britain because some people believe that the Britain should be able to help the U.S. and some say that they should wait. Blair has no idea what his further actions are because Saddam wasn&#x27;t any help and Blair has to keep calling Bush.

Scene 18: This scene is about the option of a British person on the United States. The person goes on about how America is attacking an area where there are no terrorist connections instead of going after the area where there is a known connection.

Scene 19: The French make a secret offer to the U.S. that if there are no more resolutions brought up at the UN, then the French will drop their opposition on the war. Powell doesn&#x27;t think the U.S. should act without talking about it with Blair first. The U.S. then rejects the offer by the French.

Scene 20: Rumsfeld thinks the U.S. should stop listening to the European countries because the Europeans care more about how the U.S. will react rather than Saddam. Debate breaks out among the American officials about whether the UN is useful and if they should wait on Blair to get permission from him in order to carry out their actions. Bush becomes worried that the British government might end up collapsing. Powell will be in charge of giving the presentation to the UN showing the powerful case the U.S. has for going to war.

Scene 21: There have been over 400 inspections across over 300 different sites and there still hasn&#x27;t been any sign of Iraq having any weapons capable of mass destruction. The UN inspectors need time in order to be able to successfully complete their mission. There are 100 million people protesting across 600 cities demanding that the inspectors get more time to finish their mission instead of just going straight to war.

Scene 22: Britain, Spain, and the U.S. agree to have a new resolution which allows authorization to use force. They need votes from the Security Council in order to successfully pass the resolution. The British would benefit from putting the statement of the new resolution out the next day because it is believed that no matter the circumstance, the French would vote no on it which would get rid of the second resolution all together without it being the Britain&#x27;s fault. Blair announces that the attempts to pass the new resolution will no longer continue because Chirac provided pointless diplomacy. Bush commits to working towards peace between Israel and Palestine in order to help the British Parliament survive. Right before dawn in Baghdad, the air raid sirens were a sign that the war was just beginning.

Scene 23: This scene is the ending scene that portrays the aftermath of the Iraq War. The military campaign ends after just 42 days. It will cost nearly a trillion dollars in order to reconstruct Iraq. Powell resigns from the administration during the next election. In an interview, Powell admits that the facts they were given at the time of action, ended up being wrong.

Scene 24: This scene is the last scene in the play. It focuses on an Iraqi exile. The Iraqi generally states that the American dead are more honored than the dead of the Iraqis. The Iraqi also states that Iraq was crucified for Saddam Hussein&#x27;s sins and that the people of Iraq are to blame because they didn&#x27;t take charge of their own country, which allowed Saddam to take control of Iraq.

==Production history==
&quot;Stuff Happens&quot; had its world premiere at the Olivier Theatre at the National Theatre in London on 1 September 2004 and has subsequently been performed at Los Angeles&#x27; Mark Taper Forum (with Keith Carradine and Julian Sands) in June 2005 and at Sydney&#x27;s Seymour Centre (with Rhys Muldoon and Greg Stone) in July 2005. Greg Stone won a Helpmann Award for Best Male Actor in a Play in 2006.

It debuted Off-Broadway on 28 March 2006 at the Public Theater and closed on 25 June 2006. The cast featured Jeffrey DeMunn as Donald Rumsfeld, Zach Grenier as Dick Cheney, Peter Francis James as Colin Powell and Byron Jennings as Tony Blair. Director Daniel Sullivan chose a small venue at the Newman Theater at the Public. This created an atmosphere such “as if the audience too is participating in this re-creation of recent events”. The production won the 2006 Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Ensemble; 2006 Outer Critics Circle Award, Outstanding Off-Broadway Play; and 2005-2006 OBIE Awards for Performance, Peter Francis James, Performance, Byron Jennings and Direction, Daniel Sullivan.

A one-off revival of the play took place as a rehearsed reading at the National Theatre to mark the release of the Chilcot inquiry on July 6, 2016. Directed by David Hare, the production featured Alex Jennings returning to the role of George W. Bush, Julian Sands returning as Tony Blair and Bill Nighy as the Narrator.

They are similar to charity shops, with mostly second-hand items—only everything is available at no cost. Whether it is a book, a piece of furniture, a garment or a household item, it is all freely given away, although some operate a one-in, one-out–type policy (swap shops). The free store is a form of constructive direct action that provides a shopping alternative to a monetary framework, allowing people to exchange goods and services outside of a money-based economy.

==History==
The anarchist 1960s countercultural group the Diggers opened free stores which simply gave away their stock, provided free food, distributed free drugs, gave away money, organized free music concerts, and performed works of political art. The Diggers took their name from the original English Diggers led by Gerrard Winstanley and sought to create a mini-society free of money and capitalism.

== Similar phenomena ==
Another recent development in the give-away shop movement is the creation of the Freecycle Network. It began in the state of Arizona, United States, for the purpose of connecting people who had extra belongings to get rid of with people who needed something, organized as discussion/distribution lists, and usually hosted on one of the free websites. A similar concept has operated in Israel from 2006 via the , and in Australia from 2011 via Ziilch. These websites allow free listing of goods to be acquired by others at no cost.

<text>Reusel is a village and former municipality in the south of the Dutch province of North Brabant. It is one of the villages of the municipality Reusel-De Mierden.

The village is known on their village dialect (Reusels), which is still spoken, and for the nature area Het Goor, which is also known as the Reuselse Moeren. Also the town is known for the large number of bars and shops. And the annual town fair (Reusel Kermis) is famous in the area.

Reusel existed until 1997, when it merged with Hooge en Lage Mierde to form the new municipality of Reusel-De Mierden.

==Spurious location==
Thousands of Dutch locations in family trees are spuriously identified as &quot;Holland, Reusel-de Mierden, Noord-Brabant, Netherlands&quot; despite having no connection to this small village. This is due to an error in popular genealogy software Family Tree Maker, which previously would match &quot;Holland&quot; to a narrow, 1.3 km road named &quot;Het Holland&quot; (The Woodland) located in Reusel, and automatically suggest this substitution. Long after the software error was corrected, these spurious locations have persisted in trees and have been uncritically copied.

<text>At right is displayed the color traditionally called liver.

The first recorded use of &quot;liver&quot; as a color name in English was in 1686.

Liver may also refer to a group of certain types of dark brown color in dogs and horses. Said nomenclature may also refer to the color of the organ.

==In dogs==
In dogs, the Liver color is caused by dilution of the eumelanin (black) pigment by the B locus. The gene that causes Liver is recessive, so a BB or Bb dog has normal black pigment. Only a bb dog is Liver. There are several different recessive b genes, but they all turn the coat brown. They are only distinguishable through genetic testing. Liver may also be called different names such as Brown, Chocolate, or Red. Red is a very misleading term, and should be avoided when referring to the color liver because it can be confused for phaeomelanin pigment. This second pigment is what colors all the &quot;true red&quot; or yellow parts of a dog.
Liver dilution can also be combined with other genes that dilute a dog&#x27;s coat. The D locus dilutes black pigment to a blue-grey color usually called Blue. It is a recessive trait like Liver. When a dog has both Liver and Blue dilution, it will appear to be a light, warm-gray color known as Isabella. This is the color of Weimaraners. This color also has alternate names such as Liliac or Silver. When Liver is combined with Merle, the eumelanin (black) pigment is further diluted in random patches. This usually creates a light reddish-gray dog with dark brown patches. This color is often called &quot;Red Merle&quot; even though that is misleading. A more correct name would be Liver Merle or Chocolate Merle.
There are many other dog colors that can look like brown, but are not Liver. A dog that is very dark red, like an Irish Setter may sometimes appear brown. Dogs with a blend of Black and Red/Yellow fur can also look like they have brown areas. An easy way to tell if a dog is Liver or not is to look at their nose. Eumelanin (black) pigment colors a dog&#x27;s nose, so a Liver dog will have a Liver colored nose. If the nose is black, the dog is not a liver. A pink nose has nothing to do with liver dilution, and will not help determine if a dog is liver or not. Liver will also dilute a dog&#x27;s brown eyes to amber/yellow.

It is also possible for a dog to be a Liver, and not appear brown. A dog that is recessive red cannot produce eumelanin (black) pigment in their fur. Since Liver is a dilution of black pigment, a recessive red Liver dog will appear to be a shade of Red, Yellow, or Cream depending on the intensity of the dog&#x27;s phaeomelanin (red) pigment. A recessive red Liver will still be born with a Liver nose and amber/yellow eyes. It is common for the nose of any recessive red dog to fade to pink as they grow older. Livers, like any dog, can also be covered with varying amounts of white which will hide the color of the fur.

==Liver chestnut in horses==

In horses, liver chestnut is a chocolate-colored chestnut horse. A dark liver chestnut has the same recessive base genetics as a regular chestnut, but the shade is a dark brown rather than the reddish or rust color more typical of chestnut. A horse that appears to be a dark liver chestnut but has a flaxen-colored mane and tail, sometimes colloquially though incorrectly called a &quot;chocolate palomino&quot;, could be genetically chestnut but could also be a black horse manifesting the silver dapple gene. Silver dapple is a dilution gene that acts in a manner similar to the liver dilution in dogs.

The darkest liver chestnuts may be confused for black, but such horses are distinguished from other phenotypes by the absence of black hairs, and obviously brown or reddish legs, muzzles, flanks and other &quot;soft&quot; areas. The genotypes that determine specific varieties of chestnut are not known, but the genetics that darken the coat may have a recessive mode of inheritance. The sooty gene may also be one factor in creating the darker color, though sooty coloration is generally not evenly distributed throughout the coat. Genetic testing can distinguish a chestnut from a black or a bay horse.

Other dilution genes in horses analogous to those creating dilution shades in dogs do not create a liver color in horses. These include the dun gene, which produces a tan-colored or &quot;blue&quot;/gray solid colored coat and the champagne gene which tends to lighten the coat more than the mane or tail.
==Liver (organ)==


This is the color of a healthy human liver. It may range from brown to reddish brown, and the color represented in the adjacent box is the gross average of these shades. A yellowish or greenish liver may indicate jaundice or a similar condition, a dark brown color may indicate alcohol poisoning, a black color can be seen in livers affected by Dubin–Johnson syndrome, and white or grayish tones may indicate cancer. It is unknown why the color of dogs and horses came to be known by the term &quot;Liver&quot;, as these tones indicate an unhealthy liver.

These healthy tones usually indicate blood flow, which is why livers and other meat turn grayish brown when cooked.
==Dark liver (web)==

<doc id="1029175" wikidata="Q909471" url="?curid=1029175" title="Dammar gum">
<text>Dammar, also called dammar gum, or damar gum, is a resin obtained from the tree family Dipterocarpaceae in India and Southeast Asia, principally those of the genera &quot;Shorea&quot; or &quot;Hopea&quot; (synonym &quot;Balanocarpus&quot;). The resin of some species of &quot;Canarium&quot; may also called dammar. Most is produced by tapping trees; however, some is collected in fossilised form on the ground. The gum varies in colour from clear to pale yellow, while the fossilised form is grey-brown. Dammar gum is a triterpenoid resin, containing many triterpenes and their oxidation products. Many of them are low molecular weight compounds (dammarane, dammarenolic acid, oleanane, oleanonic acid, etc.), which easily oxidizes and photoxidizes. 

== Types ==
* &quot;Damar mata kucing&quot; (&#x27;cat&#x27;s eye damar&#x27;) is a crystalline resin, usually in the form of round balls. &quot;Shorea javanica&quot; is an important source in Indonesia.
* &quot;Damar batu&quot; (&#x27;stone damar&#x27;) is stone or pebble-shaped, opaque dammar collected from the ground.
* &quot;Damar hitam&quot; (&#x27;black damar&#x27;)

==Uses==
*&quot;Dammar varnish&quot;, made from dammar gum dissolved in turpentine, was introduced as a picture varnish in 1826; commonly used in oil painting, both during the painting process and after the painting is finished. Dammar varnish and similar gum varnishes auto-oxidize and yellow over a relatively short time regardless of storage method; this effect is more pronounced on paintings stored in darkness than with works on display in light due to the bleaching effects of sunlight on the colorants involved.
*Batik is made from dammar crystals dissolved in molten paraffin wax, to prevent the wax from cracking when it is drawn onto silk or rayon.
*Encaustic paints are made from dammar crystals in beeswax with pigment added. The dammar crystals serve as a hardening agent.
*As caulk for ships in the past, frequently with pitch or bitumen.
*As a common mounting material along with canada balsam for preparing biological samples for light microscopy.
*Used in Ayurvedic medicine for various conditions.

==Constituent compounds==
Fresh dammar gum consists of a mixture of compounds; primarily hydroxydammarenone, dammarenolic acid, and oleanonic aldehyde.

==Material safety==

===Physical data===
* Appearance: white powder
* Melting point: around 120 °C
* Density: 1.04 to 1.12 g/ml
* Refractive index: around 1.5
* CAS number: 9000-16-2
* EINECS: 232-528-4
* Harmonised Tariff: 1301-90

===Stability and toxicity===
The gum is stable, probably combustible and incompatible with strong oxidising agents. Its toxicity is low, but inhalation of dust may cause allergies.

<text>In finite field theory, a branch of mathematics, a primitive polynomial is the minimal polynomial of a primitive element of the finite field . This means that a polynomial of degree with coefficients in is a &quot;primitive polynomial&quot; if it is monic and has a root in such that formula_1 is the entire field . This implies that is a primitive ()-root of unity in .

==Properties==
* Because all minimal polynomials are irreducible, all primitive polynomials are also irreducible.
* A primitive polynomial must have a non-zero constant term, for otherwise it will be divisible by &quot;x&quot;. Over GF(2), is a primitive polynomial and all other primitive polynomials have an odd number of terms, since any polynomial mod 2 with an even number of terms is divisible by (it has 1 as a root).
* An irreducible polynomial &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) of degree &quot;m&quot; over GF(&quot;p&quot;), where &quot;p&quot; is prime, is a primitive polynomial if the smallest positive integer &quot;n&quot; such that &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) divides is .
* A primitive polynomial of degree has different roots in , which all have order , meaning that any of them generates the multiplicative group of the field.
* Over GF(&quot;p&quot;) there are exactly primitive elements and primitive polynomials, each of degree , where is Euler&#x27;s totient function.
* The algebraic conjugates of a primitive element in are , , , …, and so the primitive polynomial has explicit form . That the coefficients of a polynomial of this form, for any in , not necessarily primitive, lie in follows from the property that the polynomial is invariant under application of the Frobenius automorphism to its coefficients (using ) and from the fact that the fixed field of the Frobenius automorphism is .

==Examples==
Over the polynomial is irreducible but not primitive because it divides : its roots generate a cyclic group of order 4, while the multiplicative group of is a cyclic group of order 8. The polynomial , on the other hand, is primitive. Denote one of its roots by . Then, because the natural numbers less than and relatively prime to are 1, 3, 5, and 7, the four primitive roots in are , , , and . The primitive roots and are algebraically conjugate. Indeed . The remaining primitive roots and are also algebraically conjugate and produce the second primitive polynomial: .

For degree 3, has primitive elements. As each primitive polynomial of degree 3 has three roots, all necessarily primitive, there are primitive polynomials of degree 3. One primitive polynomial is . Denoting one of its roots by , the algebraically conjugate elements are and . The other primitive polynomials are associated with algebraically conjugate sets built on other primitive elements with relatively prime to 26:
:formula_2

==Applications==
===Field element representation===
Primitive polynomials can be used to represent the elements of a finite field. If &quot;α&quot; in GF(&quot;p&quot;&quot;m&quot;) is a root of a primitive polynomial &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), then the nonzero elements of GF(&quot;p&quot;&quot;m&quot;) are represented as successive powers of &quot;α&quot;:

:formula_3

This allows an economical representation in a computer of the nonzero elements of the finite field, by representing an element by the corresponding exponent of formula_4 This representation makes multiplication easy, as it corresponds to addition of exponents modulo formula_5

===Pseudo-random bit generation===
Primitive polynomials over GF(2), the field with two elements, can be used for pseudorandom bit generation. In fact, every linear-feedback shift register with maximum cycle length (which is , where &quot;n&quot; is the length of the linear-feedback shift register) may be built from a primitive polynomial.

In general, for a primitive polynomial of degree &quot;m&quot; over GF(2), this process will generate pseudo-random bits before repeating the same sequence.

===CRC codes===
The cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is an error-detection code that operates by interpreting the message bitstring as the coefficients of a polynomial over GF(2) and dividing it by a fixed generator polynomial also over GF(2); see Mathematics of CRC. Primitive polynomials, or multiples of them, are sometimes a good choice for generator polynomials because they can reliably detect two bit errors that occur far apart in the message bitstring, up to a distance of for a degree &quot;n&quot; primitive polynomial.

==Primitive trinomials==
A useful class of primitive polynomials is the primitive trinomials, those having only three nonzero terms: . Their simplicity makes for particularly small and fast linear-feedback shift registers. A number of results give techniques for locating and testing primitiveness of trinomials.

For polynomials over GF(2), where is a Mersenne prime, a polynomial of degree &quot;r&quot; is primitive if and only if it is irreducible. (Given an irreducible polynomial, it is &quot;not&quot; primitive only if the period of &quot;x&quot; is a non-trivial factor of . Primes have no non-trivial factors.) Although the Mersenne Twister pseudo-random number generator does not use a trinomial, it does take advantage of this.

Richard Brent has been tabulating primitive trinomials of this form, such as . This can be used to create a pseudo-random number generator of the huge period ≈ .

<doc id="1029178" wikidata="Q1783193" url="?curid=1029178" title="Contextualism">
<text>Contextualism, also known as epistemic contextualism, is a family of views in philosophy which emphasize the &quot;context&quot; in which an action, utterance, or expression occurs. Proponents of contextualism argue that, in some important respect, the action, utterance, or expression can only be understood relative to that context. Contextualist views hold that philosophically controversial concepts, such as &quot;meaning P&quot;, &quot;knowing that P&quot;, &quot;having a reason to A&quot;, and possibly even &quot;being true&quot; or &quot;being right&quot; only have meaning relative to a specified context. Other philosophers contend that context-dependence leads to complete relativism.

In ethics, &quot;contextualist&quot; views are often closely associated with situational ethics, or with moral relativism.

Contextualism in architecture is a theory of design where modern building types are harmonized with urban forms usual to a traditional city.

In epistemology, contextualism is the treatment of the word &#x27;knows&#x27; as context-sensitive. Context-sensitive expressions are ones that &quot;express different propositions relative to different contexts of use&quot;. For example, some terms generally considered context-sensitive are indexicals, such as &#x27;I&#x27;, &#x27;here&#x27;, and &#x27;now&#x27;; while &#x27;I&#x27; has a constant linguistic meaning in all contexts of use, whom it refers to varies with context. Similarly, epistemic contextualists argue that the word &#x27;knows&#x27; is context sensitive, expressing different relations in some different contexts.

==Overview==
Contextualism was introduced, in part, to undermine skeptical arguments that have this basic structure:
# I don&#x27;t know that I am not in a skeptical scenario H (e.g., I&#x27;m not a brain in a vat)
# If I don&#x27;t know that H is not the case, then I don&#x27;t know an ordinary proposition O (e.g., I have hands)
# Conclusion: Therefore, I don&#x27;t know O
The contextualist solution is not to deny any premise, nor to say that the argument does not follow, but link the truth value of (3) to the context, and say that we can refuse (3) in context—like everyday conversational context—where we have different requirements to say we know.

The main tenet of contextualist epistemology is that knowledge attributions are context-sensitive, and the truth values of &quot;know&quot; depend on the context in which it is used. A statement like &#x27;I know that I have hands&#x27; would be false. The same proposition in an ordinary context—e.g., in a cafe with friends— would be truth, and its negation would be false. When we participate in philosophical discourses of the skeptical sort, we seem to lose our knowledge; once we leave the skeptical context, we can truthfully say we have knowledge.

That is, when we attribute knowledge to someone, the context in which we use the term &#x27;knowledge&#x27; determines the standards relative to which &quot;knowledge&quot; is being attributed (or denied). If we use it in everyday conversational contexts, the contextualist maintains, most of our claims to &quot;know&quot; things are true, despite skeptical attempts to show we know little or nothing. But if the term &#x27;knowledge&#x27; is used when skeptical hypotheses are being discussed, we count as &quot;knowing&quot; very little, if anything. Contextualists use this to explain why skeptical arguments can be persuasive, while at the same time protecting the correctness of our ordinary claims to &quot;know&quot; things. This theory does not allow that someone can have knowledge at one moment and not the other, which would not be a satisfying epistemological answer. What contextualism entails is that in one context an utterance of a knowledge attribution can be true, and in a context with higher standards for knowledge, the same statement can be false. This happens in the same way that &#x27;I&#x27; can correctly be used (by different people) to refer to different people at the same time.

What varies with context is how well-positioned a subject must be with respect to a proposition to count as &quot;knowing&quot; it. Contextualism in epistemology then is a semantic thesis about how &#x27;knows&#x27; works in English, not a theory of what knowledge, justification, or strength of epistemic position consists in. However, epistemologists combine contextualism with views about what knowledge is to address epistemological puzzles and issues, such as skepticism, the Gettier problem, and the Lottery paradox.

Contextualist accounts of knowledge became increasingly popular toward the end of the 20th century, particularly as responses to the problem of skepticism. Contemporary contextualists include Michael Blome-Tillmann, Michael Williams, Stewart Cohen, Keith DeRose, David Lewis, Gail Stine, and George Mattey.

The standards for attributing knowledge to someone, the contextualist claims, vary from one user&#x27;s context to the next. Thus, if I say &quot;John knows that his car is in front of him&quot;, the utterance is true if and only if (1) John believes that his car is in front of him, (2) the car is in fact in front of him, and (3) John meets the epistemic standards that my (the speaker&#x27;s) context selects. This is a loose contextualist account of knowledge, and there are many significantly different theories of knowledge that can fit this contextualist template and thereby come in a contextualist form.

For instance, an evidentialist account of knowledge can be an instance of contextualism if it&#x27;s held that strength of justification is a contextually varying matter. And one who accepts a relevant alternative&#x27;s account of knowledge can be a contextualist by holding that what range of alternatives are relevant is sensitive to conversational context. DeRose adopts a type of modal or &quot;safety&quot; (as it has since come to be known) account on which knowledge is a matter of one&#x27;s belief as to whether or not p is the case matching the fact of the matter, not only in the actual world, but also in the sufficiently close possible worlds: Knowledge amounts to there being no &quot;nearby&quot; worlds in which one goes wrong with respect to p. But how close is sufficiently close? It&#x27;s here that DeRose takes the modal account of knowledge in a contextualist direction, for the range of &quot;epistemically relevant worlds&quot; is what varies with context: In high standards contexts one&#x27;s belief must match the fact of the matter through a much wider range of worlds than is relevant to low standards contexts.

It is claimed that neurophilosophy has the goal of &quot;contextualizing&quot;.

Contextualist epistemology has been criticized by several philosophers. Contextualism is opposed to any general form of &quot;Invariantism&quot;, which claims that knowledge is not context-sensitive (i.e. it is invariant). More recent criticism has been in the form of rival theories, including &quot;Subject-Sensitive Invariantism&quot; (SSI), mainly due to the work of John Hawthorne (2004), and &quot;Interest-Relative Invariantism&quot; (IRI), due to Jason Stanley (2005). SSI claims that it is the context of the subject of the knowledge attribution that determines the epistemic standards, whereas Contextualism maintains it is the attributor. IRI, on the other hand, argues that it is the context of the practical interests of the subject of the knowledge attribution that determines the epistemic standards. Stanley writes that bare IRI is &quot;simply the claim that whether or not someone knows that &quot;p&quot; may be determined in part by practical facts about the subject&#x27;s environment.&quot; (&quot;Contextualism&quot; is a misnomer for either form of Invariantism, since &quot;Contextualism&quot; among epistemologists is considered to be restricted to a claim about the context-sensitivity of knowledge attributions (or the word &quot;knows&quot;). Thus, any view which maintains that something other than knowledge attributions are context-sensitive is not, strictly speaking, a form of Contextualism.)

An alternative to contextualism called contrastivism has been proposed by Jonathan Schaffer. Contrastivism, like contextualism, uses semantic approaches to tackle the problem of skepticism.

Recent work in experimental philosophy has taken an empirical approach to testing the claims of contextualism and related views. This research has proceeded by conducting experiments in which ordinary non-philosophers are presented with vignettes, then asked to report on the status of the knowledge ascription. The studies address contextualism by varying the context of the knowledge ascription, e.g. how important it is that the agent in the vignette has accurate knowledge.

In the studies completed up to 2010, no support for contextualism has been found: stakes have no impact on evidence. More specifically, non-philosophical intuitions about knowledge attributions are not affected by the importance to the potential knower of the accuracy of that knowledge.

<text>In semiotics, linguistics, anthropology, and philosophy of language, indexicality is the phenomenon of a &quot;sign&quot; pointing to (or &quot;indexing&quot;) some element in the context in which it occurs. A sign that signifies indexically is called an index or, in philosophy, an indexical.

The modern concept originates in the semiotic theory of Charles Sanders Peirce, in which indexicality is one of the three fundamental sign modalities by which a sign relates to its referent (the others being iconicity and symbolism). Peirce&#x27;s concept has been adopted and extended by several twentieth-century academic traditions, including those of linguistic pragmatics, linguistic anthropology, and Anglo-American philosophy of language.

Words and expressions in language often derive some part of their referential meaning from indexicality. For example, &quot;I&quot; indexically refers to the entity that is speaking; &quot;now&quot; indexically refers to a time frame including the moment at which the word is spoken; and &quot;here&quot; indexically refers to a locational frame including the place where the word is spoken. Linguistic expressions that refer indexically are known as deictics, which thus form a particular subclass of indexical signs, though there is some terminological variation among scholarly traditions.

Linguistic signs may also derive nonreferential meaning from indexicality, for example when features of a speaker&#x27;s register indexically signal their social class. Nonlinguistic signs may also display indexicality: for example, a pointing index finger may index (without referring to) some object in the direction of the line implied by the orientation of the finger, and smoke may index the presence of a fire.

In linguistics and philosophy of language, the study of indexicality tends to focus specifically on deixis, while in semiotics and anthropology equal attention is generally given to nonreferential indexicality, including altogether nonlinguistic indexicality.

==In linguistic pragmatics==

In disciplinary linguistics, indexicality is studied in the subdiscipline of pragmatics. Specifically, pragmatics tends to focus on deictics—words and expressions of language that derive some part of their referential meaning from indexicality—since these are regarded as &quot;[t]he single most obvious way in which the relationship between language and context is reflected in the structures of languages themselves&quot; Indeed, in linguistics the terms &quot;deixis&quot; and &quot;indexicality&quot; are often treated as synonymous, the only distinction being that the former is more common in linguistics and the latter in philosophy of language. This usage stands in contrast with that of linguistic anthropology, which distinguishes deixis as a particular subclass of indexicality.

== In linguistic anthropology ==
The concept of indexicality was introduced into the literature of linguistic anthropology by Michael Silverstein in a foundational 1976 paper, &quot;Shifters, Linguistic Categories and Cultural Description&quot;. Silverstein draws on &quot;the tradition extending from Peirce to Jakobson&quot; of thought about sign phenomena to propose a comprehensive theoretical framework in which to understand the relationship between language and culture, the object of study of modern sociocultural anthropology. This framework, while also drawing heavily on the tradition of structural linguistics founded by Ferdinand de Saussure, rejects the other theoretical approaches known as structuralism, which attempted to project the Saussurean method of linguistic analysis onto other realms of culture, such as kinship and marriage (see structural anthropology), literature (see semiotic literary criticism), music, film and others. Silverstein claims that &quot;[t]hat aspect of language which has traditionally been analyzed by linguistics, and has served as a model&quot; for these other structuralisms, &quot;is just the part that is functionally unique among the phenomena of culture.&quot; It is indexicality, not Saussurean grammar, which should be seen as the semiotic phenomenon which language has in common with the rest of culture.

Silverstein argues that the Saussurean tradition of linguistic analysis, which includes the tradition of structural linguistics in the United States founded by Leonard Bloomfield and including the work of Noam Chomsky and contemporary generative grammar, has been limited to identifying &quot;the contribution of elements of utterances to the referential or denotative value of the whole&quot;, that is, the contribution made by some word, expression, or other linguistic element to the function of forming &quot;propositions—predications descriptive of states of affairs&quot;. This study of reference and predication yields an understanding of one aspect of the meaning of utterances, their &quot;semantic meaning&quot;, and the subdiscipline of linguistics dedicated to studying this kind of linguistic meaning is semantics.

Yet linguistic signs in contexts of use accomplish other functions than pure reference and predication—though they often do so simultaneously, as though the signs were functioning in multiple analytically distinct semiotic modalities at once. In the philosophical literature, the most widely discussed examples are those identified by J.L. Austin as the performative functions of speech, for instance when a speaker says to an addressee &quot;I bet you sixpence it will rain tomorrow&quot;, and in so saying, in addition to simply making a proposition about a state of affairs, actually enters into a socially constituted type of agreement with the addressee, a wager. Thus, concludes Silverstein, &quot;[t]he problem set for us when we consider the actual broader uses of language is to describe the total meaning of constituent linguistic signs, only part of which is semantic.&quot; This broader study of linguistic signs relative to their general communicative functions is pragmatics, and these broader aspects of the meaning of utterances is &quot;pragmatic meaning&quot;. (From this point of view, semantic meaning is a special subcategory of pragmatic meaning, that aspect of meaning which contributes to the communicative function of pure reference and predication.).

Silverstein introduces some components of the semiotic theory of Charles Sanders Peirce as the basis for a pragmatics which, rather than assuming that reference and predication are the essential communicative functions of language with other nonreferential functions being mere addenda, instead attempts to capture the total meaning of linguistic signs in terms of all of their communicative functions. From this perspective, the Peircean category of indexicality turns out to &quot;give the key to the pragmatic description of language.&quot;

This theoretical framework became an essential presupposition of work throughout the discipline in the 1980s and remains so in the present.

===Adaptation of Peircean semiotics===

The concept of indexicality has been greatly elaborated in the literature of linguistic anthropology since its introduction by Silverstein, but Silverstein himself adopted the term from the theory of sign phenomena, or semiotics, of Charles Sanders Peirce. As an implication of his general metaphysical theory of the three universal categories, Peirce proposed a model of the sign as a triadic relationship: a sign is &quot;something which stands to somebody for something in some respect or capacity.&quot; Thus, more technically, a sign consists of

* A &quot;sign-vehicle&quot; or &quot;representamen&quot;, the perceptible phenomenon which does the representing, whether audibly, visibly or in some other sensory modality;
* An &quot;object&quot;, the entity of whatever kind, with whatever modal status (experienceable, potential, imaginary, law-like, etc.), which is represented by the sign; and
* An &quot;interpretant&quot;, the &quot;idea in the mind&quot; of the perceiving individual, which interprets the sign-vehicle &quot;as&quot; representing the object.

Peirce further proposed to classify sign phenomena along three different dimensions by means of three trichotomies, the second of which classifies signs into three categories according to the nature of the relationship between the sign-vehicle and the object it represents. As captioned by Silverstein, these are:

*&quot;Icon&quot;: a sign in which &quot;the perceivable properties of the sign vehicle itself have isomorphism to (up to identity with) those of the entity signaled. That is, the entities are &#x27;likenesses&#x27; in some sense.&quot;
*&quot;Index&quot;: a sign in which &quot;the occurrence of a sign vehicle token bears a connection of understood spatio-temporal contiguity to the occurrence of the entity signaled. That is, the presence of some entity is perceived to be signaled in the context of communication incorporating the sign vehicle.&quot;
*&quot;Symbol&quot;: the residual class, a sign which is not related to its object by virtue of bearing some qualitative likeness to it, nor by virtue of co-occurring with it in some contextual framework. These &quot;form the class of &#x27;arbitrary&#x27; signs traditionally spoken of as the fundamental kind of linguistic entity. Sign vehicle and entity signaled are related through the bond of a semantico-referential meaning&quot; which permits them to be used to refer to any member of a whole class or category of entities.

Silverstein observes that multiple signs may share the same sign-vehicle. For instance, as mentioned, linguistic signs as traditionally understood are symbols, and analyzed in terms of their contribution to reference and predication, since they arbitrarily denote a whole class of possible objects of reference by virtue of their semantic meanings. But in a trivial sense each linguistic sign token (word or expression spoken in an actual context of use) also functions iconically, since it is an icon of its type in the code (grammar) of the language. It also functions indexically, by indexing its symbol type, since its use in context presupposes that such a type exists in the semantico-referential grammar in use in the communicative situation (grammar is thus understood as an element of the context of communication).

So icon, index and symbol are not mutually exclusive categories—indeed, Silverstein argues, they are to be understood as distinct modes of semiotic function, which may be overlaid on a single sign-vehicle. This entails that one sign-vehicle may function in multiple semiotic modes simultaneously. This observation is the key to understanding deixis, traditionally a difficult problem for semantic theory.

=== Referential indexicality (deixis) ===

In linguistic anthropology, &quot;deixis&quot; is defined as referential indexicality—that is, morphemes or strings of morphemes, generally organized into closed paradigmatic sets, which function to &quot;individuate or single out objects of reference or address in terms of their relation to the current interactive context in which the utterance occurs&quot;. &quot;Deictic&quot; expressions are thus distinguished, on the one hand, from standard denotational categories such as common nouns, which potentially refer to any member of a whole class or category of entities: these display purely semantico-referential meaning, and in the Peircean terminology are known as &quot;symbols&quot;. On the other hand, deixis is distinguished as a particular subclass of indexicality in general, which may be nonreferential or altogether nonlinguistic.

In the older terminology of Otto Jespersen and Roman Jakobson, these forms were called &quot;shifters&quot;. Silverstein, by introducing the terminology of Peirce, was able to define them more specifically as referential indexicals.

=== Non-referential indexicality ===
Non-referential indices or &quot;pure&quot; indices do not contribute to the semantico-referential value of a speech event yet &quot;signal some particular value of one or more contextual variables.&quot; Non-referential indices encode certain metapragmatic elements of a speech event&#x27;s context through linguistic variations. The degree of variation in non-referential indices is considerable and serves to infuse the speech event with, at times, multiple levels of pragmatic &quot;meaning&quot;. Of particular note are: sex/gender indices, deference indices (including the affinal taboo index), affect indices, as well as the phenomena of phonological hypercorrection and social identity indexicality.

Examples of non-referential forms of indexicality include sex/gender, affect, deference, social class, and social identity indices. Many scholars, notably Silverstein, argue that occurrences of non-referential indexicality entail not only the context-dependent variability of the speech event, but also increasingly subtle forms of indexical meaning (first, second, and higher-orders) as well.

==== Sex/gender indices ====
One common system of non-referential indexicality is sex/gender indices. These indices index the gender or &quot;female/male&quot; social status of the interlocutor. There are a multitude of linguistic variants that act to index sex and gender such as:

*&quot;word-final or sentence-final particles&quot;:many languages employ the suffixation of word-final particles to index the gender of the speaker. These particles vary from phonological alterations such as the one explored by William Labov in his work on postvocalic /r/ employment in words that had no word final &quot;r&quot; (which is claimed, among other things, to index the &quot;female&quot; social sex status by virtue of the statistical fact that women tend to hypercorrect their speech more often than men); suffixation of single phonemes, such as /-s/ in Muskogean languages of the southeastern United States; or particle suffixation (such as the Japanese sentence-final use of &quot;-wa&quot; with rising intonation to indicate increasing affect and, via second-order indexicality, the gender of the speaker (in this case, female))
*&quot;morphological and phonological mechanisms&quot;: such as in Yana, a language where one form of all major words are spoken by sociological male to sociological male, and another form (which is constructed around phonological changes in word forms) is used for all other combination of interlocutors; or the Japanese prefix-affixation of o- to indicate politeness and, consequently, feminine social identity.

Many instances of sex/gender indices incorporate multiple levels of indexicality (also referred to as &quot;indexical order&quot;). In fact, some, such as the prefix-affixation of o- in Japanese, demonstrate complex higher-order indexical forms. In this example, the first order indexes politeness and the second order indexes affiliation with a certain gender class. It is argued that there is an even higher level of indexical order evidenced by the fact that many jobs use the &quot;o-&quot; prefix to attract female applicants. This notion of higher-order indexicality is similar to Silverstein&#x27;s discussion of &quot;wine talk&quot; in that it indexes &quot;an identity-by-visible-consumption [here, &quot;employment&quot;]&quot; that is an inherent of a certain social register (i.e. social gender indexicality).

==== Affect indices ====
Affective meaning is seen as &quot;the encoding, or indexing of speakers emotions into speech events.&quot; The interlocutor of the event &quot;decodes&quot; these verbal messages of affect by giving &quot;precedence to intentionality&quot;; that is, by assuming that the affective form intentionally indexes emotional meaning.

Some examples of affective forms are: diminutives (for example, diminutive affixes in Indo-European and Amerindian languages indicate sympathy, endearment, emotional closeness, or antipathy, condescension, and emotional distance); ideophones and onomatopoeias; expletives, exclamations, interjections, curses, insults, and imprecations (said to be &quot;dramatizations of actions or states&quot;); intonation change (common in tone languages such as Japanese); address terms, kinship terms, and pronouns which often display clear affective dimensions (ranging from the complex address-form systems found languages such a Javanese to inversions of vocative kin terms found in Rural Italy); lexical processes such as synecdoche and metonymy involved in effect meaning manipulation; certain categories of meaning like evidentiality; reduplication, quantifiers, and comparative structures; as well as inflectional morphology.

Affective forms are a means by which a speaker indexes emotional states through different linguistic mechanisms. These indices become important when applied to other forms of non-referential indexicality, such as sex indices and social identity indices, because of the innate relationship between first-order indexicality and subsequent second-order (or higher) indexical forms. (See multiple indices section for Japanese example).

==== Deference indices ====
Deference indices encode deference from one interlocutor to another (usually representing inequalities of status, rank, age, sex, etc.). Some examples of deference indices are:

=====T/V deference entitlement=====
The T/V deference entitlement system of European languages was famously detailed by linguists Brown and Gilman. T/V deference entitlement is a system by which a speaker/addressee speech event is determined by perceived disparities of &#x27;power&#x27; and &#x27;solidarity&#x27; between interlocutors. Brown and Gilman organized the possible relationships between the speaker and the addressee into six categories:
# Superior and solidary
# Superior and not solidary
# Equal and solidary
# Equal and not solidary
# Inferior and solidary
# Inferior and not solidary
The &#x27;power semantic&#x27; indicates that the speaker in a superior position uses T and the speaker in an inferior position uses V. The &#x27;solidarity semantic&#x27; indicates that speakers use T for close relationships and V for more formal relationships. These two principles conflict in categories 2 and 5, allowing either T or V in those cases:
# Superior and solidary: T
# Superior and not solidary: T/V
# Equal and solidary: T
# Equal and not solidary: V
# Inferior and solidary: T/V
# Inferior and not solidary: V
Brown and Gilman observed that as the solidarity semantic becomes more important than the power semantic in various cultures, the proportion of T to V use in the two ambiguous categories changes accordingly.

Silverstein comments that while exhibiting a basic level of first-order indexicality, the T/V system also employs second-order indexicality vis-à-vis &#x27;enregistered honorification&#x27;. He cites that the V form can also function as an index of valued &quot;public&quot; register and the standards of good behavior that are entailed by use of V forms over T forms in public contexts. Therefore, people will use T/V deference entailment in 1) a first-order indexical sense that distinguishes between speaker/addressee interpersonal values of &#x27;power&#x27; and &#x27;solidarity&#x27; and 2) a second-order indexical sense that indexes an interlocutor&#x27;s inherent &quot;honor&quot; or social merit in employing V forms over T forms in public contexts.

=====Japanese honorifics=====
Japanese provides an excellent case study of honorifics. Honorifics in Japanese can be divided into two categories: addressee honorifics, which index deference to the addressee of the utterance; and referent honorifics, which index deference to the referent of the utterance. Cynthia Dunn claims that &quot;almost every utterance in Japanese requires a choice between direct and distal forms of the predicate.&quot; The direct form indexes intimacy and &quot;spontaneous self-expression&quot; in contexts involving family and close friends. Contrarily, distal form index social contexts of a more formal, public nature such as distant acquaintances, business settings, or other formal settings.

Japanese also contains a set of humble forms (Japanese &quot;kenjōgo&quot; 謙譲語) which are employed by the speaker to index their deference to someone else. There are also suppletive forms that can be used in lieu of regular honorific endings (for example, the subject honorific form of : . Verbs that involve human subjects must choose between &quot;distal&quot; or &quot;direct&quot; forms (towards the addressee) as well as a distinguish between either no use of referent honorifics, use of subject honorific (for others), or use of humble form (for self). The Japanese model for non-referential indexicality demonstrates a very subtle and complicated system that encodes social context into almost every utterance.

=====Affinal taboo index=====
Dyirbal, a language of the Cairns rain forest in Northern Queensland, employs a system known as the affinal taboo index. Speakers of the language maintain two sets of lexical items: 1) an &quot;everyday&quot; or common interaction set of lexical items and 2) a &quot;mother-in-law&quot; set that is employed when the speaker is in the very distinct context of interaction with their mother-in-law. In this particular system of deference indices, speakers have developed an entirely separate lexicon (there are roughly four &quot;everyday&quot; lexical entries for every one &quot;mother-in-law&quot; lexical entry; 4:1) to index deference in contexts inclusive of the mother-in-law.

====Hypercorrection as a social class index====
Hypercorrection is defined by Wolfram as &quot;the use of speech form on the basis of false analogy.&quot; DeCamp defines hypercorrection in a more precise fashion claiming that &quot;hypercorrection is an incorrect analogy with a form in a prestige dialect which the speaker has imperfectly mastered.&quot; Many scholars argue that hypercorrection provides both an index of &quot;social class&quot; and an &quot;Index of Linguistic insecurity&quot;. The latter index can be defined as a speaker&#x27;s attempts at self-correction in areas of perceived linguistic insufficiencies which denote their lower social standing and minimal social mobility.

Donald Winford conducted a study that measured the phonological hypercorrection in creolization of English speakers in Trinidad. He claims that the ability to use prestigious norms goes &quot;hand-in-hand&quot; with knowledge of stigmatization afforded to use of &quot;lesser&quot; phonological variants. He concluded that sociologically &quot;lesser&quot; individuals would try to increase the frequency of certain vowels that were frequent in the high prestige dialect, but they ended up using those vowels even more than their target dialect. This hypercorrection of vowels is an example of non-referential indexicality that indexes, by virtue of innate urges forcing lower class civilians to hypercorrect phonological variants, the actual social class of the speaker. As Silverstein claims, this also conveys an &quot;Index of Linguistic insecurity&quot; in which a speaker not only indexes their actual social class (via first-order indexicality) but also the insecurities about class constraints and subsequent linguistic effects that encourage hypercorrection in the first place (an incidence of second-order indexicality).

William Labov and many others have also studied how hypercorrection in African American Vernacular English demonstrates similar social class non-referential indexicality.

====Multiple indices in social identity indexicality====
Multiple non-referential indices can be employed to index the social identity of a speaker. An example of how multiple indexes can constitute social identity is exemplified by Ochs discussion of copula deletion: &quot;That Bad&quot; in American English can index a speaker to be a child, foreigner, medical patient, or elderly person. Use of multiple non-referential indices at once (for example copula deletion and raising intonation), helps further index the social identity of the speaker as that of a child.

Linguistic and non-linguistic indices are also an important ways of indexing social identity. For example, the Japanese utterance &quot;-wa&quot; in conjunction with raising intonation (indexical of increasing affect) by one person who &quot;looks like a woman&quot; and another who looks &quot;like a man&quot; may index different affective dispositions which, in turn, can index gender difference. Ochs and Schieffilen also claim that facial features, gestures, as well as other non-linguistic indices may actually help specify the general information provided by the linguistic features and augment the pragmatic meaning of the utterance.

===Indexical order===
In much of the research currently conducted upon various phenomena of non-referential indexicality, there is an increased interest in not only what is called first-order indexicality, but subsequent second-order as well as &quot;higher-order&quot; levels of indexical meaning. First-order indexicality can be defined as the first level of pragmatic meaning that is drawn from an utterance. For example, instances of deference indexicality, such as the variation between informal &quot;tu&quot; and formal &quot;vous&quot; in French, indicate a speaker/addressee communicative relationship built upon the values of &quot;power&quot; and &quot;solidarity&quot; possessed by the interlocutors. When a speaker addresses somebody using the V form instead of the T form, they index (via first-order indexicality) their understanding of the need for deference to the addressee. In other words, they perceive or recognize an incongruence between their levels of power and/or solidarity and employ a more formal way of addressing that person to suit the contextual constraints of the speech event.

Second-Order Indexicality is concerned with the connection between linguistic variables and the metapragmatic meanings that they encode. For example, a woman is walking down the street in Manhattan and she stops to ask somebody where a McDonald&#x27;s is. He responds to her talking in a heavy &quot;Brooklyn&quot; accent. She notices this accent and considers a set of possible personal characteristics that might be indexed by it (such as the man&#x27;s intelligence, economic situation, and other non-linguistic aspects of his life). The power of language to encode these preconceived &quot;stereotypes&quot; based solely on accent is an example of second-order indexicality (representative of a more complex and subtle system of indexical form than that of first-order indexicality).

====Oinoglossia (wine talk)====
For demonstrations of higher (or rarefied) indexical orders, Michael Silverstein discusses the particularities of &quot;life-style emblematization&quot; or &quot;convention-dependent-indexical iconicity&quot; which, as he claims, is prototypical of a phenomenon he dubs &quot;wine talk&quot;. Professional wine critics use a certain &quot;technical vocabulary&quot; that are &quot;metaphorical of prestige realms of traditional English gentlemanly horticulture.&quot; Thus, a certain &quot;lingo&quot; is created for wine that indexically entails certain notions of prestigious social classes or genres. When &quot;yuppies&quot; use the lingo for wine flavors created by these critics in the &quot;actual context&quot; of drinking wine, Silverstein argues that they become the &quot;well-bred, interesting (subtle, balanced, intriguing, winning, etc.) person&quot; that is iconic of the metaphorical &quot;fashion of speaking&quot; employed by people of higher social registers, demanding notoriety as a result of this high level of connoisseurship. In other words, the wine drinker becomes a refined, gentlemanly critic and, in doing so, adopts a similar level of connoisseurship and social refinement. Silverstein defines this as an example of higher-order indexical &quot;authorization&quot; in which the indexical order of this &quot;wine talk&quot; exists in a &quot;complex, interlocking set of institutionally formed macro-sociological interests.&quot; A speaker of English metaphorically transfers him- or herself into the social structure of the &quot;wine world&quot; that is encoded by the &quot;oinoglossia&quot; of elite critics using a very particular &quot;technical&quot; terminology.

The use of &quot;wine talk&quot; or similar &quot;fine-cheeses talk&quot;, &quot;perfume talk&quot;, &quot;Hegelian-dialectics talk&quot;, &quot;particle-physics talk&quot;, &quot;DNA-sequencing talk&quot;, &quot;semiotics talk&quot; etc. confers upon an individual an identity-by-visible-consumption indexical of a certain macro-sociological elite identity and is, as such, an instance of higher-order indexicality.

== In philosophy of language ==
Philosophical work on language from the mid-20th century, such as that of J.L. Austin and the ordinary language philosophers, has provided much of the originary inspiration for the study of indexicality and related issues in linguistic pragmatics (generally under the rubric of the term &quot;deixis&quot;), though linguists have appropriated concepts originating in philosophical work for purposes of empirical study, rather than for more strictly philosophical purposes.

However, indexicality has remained an issue of interest to philosophers who work on language. In contemporary analytic philosophy, the preferred nominal form of the term is &quot;indexical&quot; (rather than &quot;index&quot;), defined as &quot;any expression whose content varies from one context of use to another ... [for instance] pronouns such as &#x27;I&#x27;, &#x27;you&#x27;, &#x27;he&#x27;, &#x27;she&#x27;, &#x27;it&#x27;, &#x27;this&#x27;, &#x27;that&#x27;, plus adverbs such as &#x27;now&#x27;, &#x27;then&#x27;, &#x27;today&#x27;, &#x27;yesterday&#x27;, &#x27;here&#x27;, and &#x27;actually&#x27;. This exclusive focus on linguistic expressions represents a narrower construal than is preferred in linguistic anthropology, which regards linguistic indexicality (&quot;deixis&quot;) as a special subcategory of indexicality in general, which is often nonlinguistic.

Indexicals appear to represent an exception to, and thus a challenge for, the understanding of natural language as the grammatical coding of logical propositions; they thus &quot;raise interesting technical challenges for logicians seeking to provide formal models of correct reasoning in natural language.&quot; They are also studied in relation to fundamental issues in epistemology, self-consciousness, and metaphysics, for example asking whether indexical facts are facts that do not follow from the physical facts, and thus also form a link between philosophy of language and philosophy of mind.

The American logician David Kaplan is regarded as having developed &quot;[b]y far the most influential theory of the meaning and logic of indexicals&quot;.

<text>Vidar Riseth (born 21 April 1972) is a Norwegian former professional footballer who played as a centre-back or midfielder. He played for Neset, Rosenborg, Kongsvinger, Lillestrøm and Strømsgodset in Norway, and Luton Town, LASK Linz, Celtic and 1860 Munich abroad. He played 52 times for the Norway national team, scoring four goals, and played for his country at the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000. He retired as a professional footballer in June 2010. He later worked as a professional football commentator.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Riseth joined Rosenborg from local side Neset in January 1991. He played one game in the 1992 championship winning season, but had more games as Rosenborg won back to back in 1993. In 1994, he joined Kongsvinger. He played there for three seasons, scoring regularly as he played as a centre forward at this time of his career. Late in his Kongsvinger career, he went for a brief loan to Luton.

On 20 March 2000, while playing for Scottish club Celtic, he scored the opening goal in the 2000 Scottish League Cup Final, which Celtic went on to win 2–0. In November, he moved on loan to German club 1860 Munich until the end of the season. At the end of his loan spell, the two clubs discussed making the deal permanent.

He returned to Norway to play for Rosenborg, and on 24 October 2007, helped secure their first UEFA Champions League home victory in six years, scoring the second in a shock 2–0 win against Spanish club Valencia.

<doc id="1029189" wikidata="Q1186544" url="?curid=1029189" title="Thick description">
<text>In the social sciences and related fields, a thick description is a description of human social action that describes not just physical behaviors, but their context as interpreted by the actors as well, so that it can be better understood by an outsider. A thick description typically adds a record of subjective explanations and meanings provided by the people engaged in the behaviors, making the collected data of greater value for studies by other social scientists.

The term was first introduced by 20th-century philosopher Gilbert Ryle. However, the predominant sense in which it is used today was developed by anthropologist Clifford Geertz in his book &quot;The Interpretation of Cultures&quot; (1973) to characterise his own method of doing ethnography. Since then, the term and the methodology it represents has gained widespread currency, not only in the social sciences but also, for example, in the type of literary criticism known as New Historicism.

== Gilbert Ryle ==

Thick description was first introduced by the British philosopher Gilbert Ryle in 1968 in &quot;The Thinking of Thoughts: What is &#x27;Le Penseur&#x27; Doing?&quot; and &quot;Thinking and Reflecting&quot;. 

# thin, which includes surface-level observations of behaviour; and
# thick, which adds context to such behaviour.

To explain such context required grasping individuals&#x27; motivations for their behaviors and how these behaviors were understood by other observers of the community as well.

This method emerged at a time when the ethnographic school was pushing for an ethnographic approach that paid particular attention to everyday events. The school of ethnography thought seemingly arbitrary events could convey important notions of understanding that could be lost at a first glance. Similarly Bronisław Malinowski put forth the concept of a &quot;native point of view&quot; in his 1922 work, &quot;Argonauts of the Western Pacific&quot;. Malinowski felt that an anthropologist should try to understand the perspectives of ethnographic subjects in relation to their own world.

== Clifford Geertz ==

Following Ryle&#x27;s work, the American anthropologist Clifford Geertz re-popularized the concept. Known for his symbolic and interpretive anthropological work, Geertz&#x27;s methods were in response to his critique of existing anthropological methods that searched for universal truths and theories. He was against comprehensive theories of human behavior; rather, he advocated methodologies that highlight culture from the perspective of how people looked at and experienced life. His 1973 article, &quot;Thick Description: Toward an Interpretive Theory of Culture&quot;, synthesizes his approach.

Thick description emphasized a more analytical approach, whereas previously observation alone was the primary approach. To Geertz, analysis separated observation from interpretative methodologies. An analysis is meant to pick out the critical structures and established codes. This analysis begins with distinguishing all individuals present and coming to an integrative synthesis that accounts for the actions produced. The ability of thick descriptions to showcase the totality of a situation to aid in the overall understanding of findings was called &quot;mélange of descriptors&quot;. As Lincoln &amp; Guba (1985) indicate, findings are not the result of thick description; rather they result from analyzing the materials, concepts, or persons that are &quot;thickly described.&quot;

 takes issue with the state of anthropological practices in understanding culture. By highlighting the reductive nature of ethnography, to reduce culture to &quot;menial observations,&quot; Geertz hoped to reintroduce ideas of culture as semiotic. By this he intended to add signs and deeper meaning to the collection of observations. These ideas would challenge Edward Burnett Tylor&#x27;s concepts of culture as a &quot;most complex whole&quot; that is able to be understood; instead culture, to Geertz, could never be fully understood or observed. Because of this, ethnographic observations must rely on the context of the population being studied by understanding how the participants come to recognize actions in relation to one another and to the overall structure of the society in a specific place and time. Today, various disciplines have implemented thick description in their work.

Geertz pushes for a search for a &quot;web of meaning&quot;. These ideas were incompatible with textbook definitions of ethnography of the times that described ethnography as systematic observations of different populations under the guise of Race categorization and categorizing the &quot;other.&quot; To Geertz, culture should be treated as symbolic, allowing for observations to be connected with greater meanings.

This approach brings about its own difficulties. Studying communities via large-scale anthropological interpretation will bring about discrepancies in understanding. As cultures are dynamic and changing, Geertz also emphasizes the importance of speaking &quot;to&quot; rather than speaking &quot;for&quot; the subjects of ethnographic research and recognizing that cultural analysis is never complete. This method is essential to approach the actual context of a culture. As such, Geertz points out that interpretive works provide ethnographers the ability to have conversations with the people they study.

== Interpretive turn ==
Geertz is revered for his pioneering field methods and clear, accessible prose writing style (cf. Robinson&#x27;s critique, 1983). He was considered &quot;for three decades...the single most influential cultural anthropologist in the United States.&quot;

Interpretive methodologies were needed to understand culture as a system of meaning. Because of this, Geertz&#x27;s influence is connected with &quot;a massive cultural shift&quot; in the social sciences - referred to as the &quot;interpretive turn&quot;. The interpretive turn in the social sciences had strong foundations in the methodology of cultural anthropology. A shift occurred from using structural approaches (as an interpretive lens) towards meaning. With the interpretive turn, contextual and textual information took the lead in understanding reality, language, and culture. This was all under the assumption that a better anthropology included understanding the particular behaviors of the communities being studied.

Geertz&#x27;s thick-description approach, along with the theories of Claude Lévi-Strauss, has become increasingly recognized as a method of symbolic anthropology, enlisted as a working antidote to overly technocratic, mechanistic means of understanding cultures, organizations, and historical settings. Influenced by Gilbert Ryle, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Max Weber, Paul Ricoeur, and Alfred Schütz, the method of descriptive ethnography that came to be associated with Geertz is credited with resuscitating field research from an endeavor of ongoing objectification—the focus of research being &quot;out there&quot;—to a more immediate undertaking, where participant observation embeds the researcher in the enactment of the settings being reported. However, despite its dissemination among the disciplines, some theorists pushed back on thick description, skeptical about its ability to somehow interpret meaning by compiling large amounts of data. They also questioned how this data was supposed to provide the totality of a society naturally.

<doc id="1029195" wikidata="Q1030817" url="?curid=1029195" title="Busbar">
<text>In electric power distribution, a busbar (also bus bar) is a metallic strip or bar, typically housed inside switchgear, panel boards, and busway enclosures for local high current power distribution. They are also used to connect high voltage equipment at electrical switchyards, and low-voltage equipment in battery banks. They are generally uninsulated, and have sufficient stiffness to be supported in air by insulated pillars. Those features allow sufficient cooling of the conductors, and the ability to tap in at various points without having to create a new joint.

==Design and placement==
The busbar&#x27;s material composition and cross-sectional size determine the maximum current it can safely carry. Busbars can have a cross-sectional area of as little as , but electrical substations may use metal tubes in diameter or more as busbars. Aluminium smelters use very large busbars to carry tens of thousands of amperes to the electrochemical cells that produce aluminium from molten salts.

Busbars are produced in a variety of shapes, including flat strips, solid bars and rods, and are typically composed of copper, brass or aluminium as solid or hollow tubes. Some of these shapes allow heat to dissipate more efficiently due to their high surface area to cross-sectional area ratio. The skin effect makes 50–60 Hz AC busbars more than about thickness inefficient, so hollow or flat shapes are prevalent in higher-current applications. A hollow section also has higher stiffness than a solid rod of equivalent current-carrying capacity, which allows a greater span between busbar supports in outdoor electrical switchyards. 

A busbar must be sufficiently rigid to support its own weight, and forces imposed by mechanical vibration and possibly earthquakes, as well as accumulated precipitation in outdoor exposures. In addition, thermal expansion from temperature changes induced by ohmic heating and ambient temperature variations, and magnetic forces induced by large currents, must be considered. To address these concerns, flexible bus bars, typically a sandwich of thin conductor layers, were developed. They require a structural frame or cabinet for their installation. Mechanical forces generated by fault currents, which can momentarily reach hundreds of thousands of amperes, must also be considered.

Distribution boards split the electrical supply into separate circuits at one location. Busways, or bus ducts, are long busbars with protective covers. Rather than branching from the main supply at one location, they allow new circuits to branch off anywhere along the busway.

A busbar may be either supported on insulators, or wrapped in insulation. They are protected from accidental contact either by a metal earthed enclosure or by elevation out of normal reach. Insulated bus bars are used in busways listed to UL 857 standards. Power neutral busbars may also be insulated because it is not guaranteed that the potential between power neutral and safety grounding is always zero. Earthing (safety grounding) busbars are typically bare and bolted directly onto any metal chassis of their enclosure. They may be enclosed in a metal housing, in the form of a bus duct or busway, segregated-phase bus, or isolated-phase bus.

Busbars may be connected to each other and to electrical apparatus by bolting, clamping or welding. Joints between high-current bus sections often have precisely machined matching surfaces that are silver-plated to reduce contact resistance. At extra high voltages (more than 300 kV) in outdoor buses, corona discharge around the connections becomes a source of radio-frequency interference and power loss, so special connection fittings designed for those voltages are used.

<text>The Ndwandwe are a Bantu Nguni-speaking people who populate sections of southern Africa. They are also known as the Nxumalo&#x27;s

The Ndwandwe, with the Mthethwa, were a significant power in present-day Zululand at the turn of the nineteenth century. Under the leadership of King Zwide, the Ndwandwe nation destroyed the Mthethwa under their king Dingiswayo, and the power vacuum was filled by Shaka Zulu and the Zulu tribe. In a common front against the Ndwandwe, Shaka collected the remains of the Mthethwa and other regional tribes, and survived the first encounter of the Zulu Civil War with Zwide at the Battle of Gqokli Hill in 1818. 

In 1819, Zwide made another expedition against the Zulus, but Shaka again changed his tactics, letting the Ndwandwe army penetrate his territory and responding with guerrilla warfare. Shortage of supplies caused the Ndandwe to return home, but when they were crossing the river Mhlatuze in early 1820, their forces were split and defeated at the Battle of Mhlatuze River.

This led to the disintegration of the Ndwandwe nation as Zwide&#x27;s generals and sons led sections of the Ndwandwe northwards. One such group, under Soshangane, formed the Gaza Empire in present-day central Mozambique while another, under Zwangendaba, established rule as the waNgoni in present-day Malawi. Others established themselves as chiefs of note in Swaziland and Zambia to create a Ndwandwe legacy of enduring power that is scattered across Southern Africa.

They speak Nguni dialects and their nations’ official languages are English in Zambia and Zimbabwe, and Portuguese in Mozambique.

<text>Metabolomics is the scientific study of chemical processes involving metabolites, the small molecule substrates, intermediates, and products of cell metabolism. Specifically, metabolomics is the &quot;systematic study of the unique chemical fingerprints that specific cellular processes leave behind&quot;, the study of their small-molecule metabolite profiles. The metabolome represents the complete set of metabolites in a biological cell, tissue, organ, or organism, which are the end products of cellular processes. Messenger RNA (mRNA), gene expression data, and proteomic analyses reveal the set of gene products being produced in the cell, data that represents one aspect of cellular function. Conversely, metabolic profiling can give an instantaneous snapshot of the physiology of that cell, and thus, metabolomics provides a direct &quot;functional readout of the physiological state&quot; of an organism. There are indeed quantifiable correlations between the metabolome and the other cellular ensembles (genome, transcriptome, proteome, and lipidome), which can be used to predict metabolite abundances in biological samples from, for example mRNA abundances. One of the ultimate challenges of systems biology is to integrate metabolomics with all other -omics information to provide a better understanding of cellular biology.

== History ==
The concept that individuals might have a &quot;metabolic profile&quot; that could be reflected in the makeup of their biological fluids was introduced by Roger Williams in the late 1940s, who used paper chromatography to suggest characteristic metabolic patterns in urine and saliva were associated with diseases such as schizophrenia. However, it was only through technological advancements in the 1960s and 1970s that it became feasible to quantitatively (as opposed to qualitatively) measure metabolic profiles. The term &quot;metabolic profile&quot; was introduced by Horning, &quot;et al.&quot; in 1971 after they demonstrated that gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) could be used to measure compounds present in human urine and tissue extracts. The Horning group, along with that of Linus Pauling and Arthur B. Robinson led the development of GC-MS methods to monitor the metabolites present in urine through the 1970s.

Concurrently, NMR spectroscopy, which was discovered in the 1940s, was also undergoing rapid advances. In 1974, Seeley et al. demonstrated the utility of using NMR to detect metabolites in unmodified biological samples. This first study on muscle highlighted the value of NMR in that it was determined that 90% of cellular ATP is complexed with magnesium. As sensitivity has improved with the evolution of higher magnetic field strengths and magic angle spinning, NMR continues to be a leading analytical tool to investigate metabolism. Recent efforts to utilize NMR for metabolomics have been largely driven by the laboratory of Jeremy K. Nicholson at Birkbeck College, University of London and later at Imperial College London. In 1984, Nicholson showed 1H NMR spectroscopy could potentially be used to diagnose diabetes mellitus, and later pioneered the application of pattern recognition methods to NMR spectroscopic data.

In 1994 and 1996, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry metabolomics experiments were performed by Gary Siuzdak while working with Richard Lerner (then president of the Scripps Research Institute) and Benjamin Cravatt, to analyze the cerebral spinal fluid from sleep deprived animals. One molecule of particular interest, oleamide, was observed and later shown to have sleep inducing properties. This work is one of the earliest such experiments combining liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry in metabolomics.

In 2005, the first metabolomics tandem mass spectrometry database, METLIN, for characterizing human metabolites was developed in the Siuzdak laboratory at the Scripps Research Institute. METLIN has since grown and as of December, 2023, METLIN contains MS/MS experimental data on over 930,000 molecular standards and other chemical entities, each compound having experimental tandem mass spectrometry data generated from molecular standards at multiple collision energies and in positive and negative ionization modes. METLIN is the largest repository of tandem mass spectrometry data of its kind. The dedicated academic journal Metabolomics first appeared in 2005, founded by its current editor-in-chief Roy Goodacre.

In 2005, the Siuzdak lab was engaged in identifying metabolites associated with sepsis and in an effort to address the issue of statistically identifying the most relevant dysregulated metabolites across hundreds of LC/MS datasets, the first algorithm was developed to allow for the nonlinear alignment of mass spectrometry metabolomics data. Called XCMS, it has since (2012) been developed as an online tool and as of 2019 (with METLIN) has over 30,000 registered users.

On 23 January 2007, the Human Metabolome Project, led by David S. Wishart, completed the first draft of the human metabolome, consisting of a database of approximately 2,500 metabolites, 1,200 drugs and 3,500 food components. Similar projects have been underway in several plant species, most notably &quot;Medicago truncatula&quot; and &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; for several years.

As late as mid-2010, metabolomics was still considered an &quot;emerging field&quot;. Further, it was noted that further progress in the field depended in large part, through addressing otherwise &quot;irresolvable technical challenges&quot;, by technical evolution of mass spectrometry instrumentation.

In 2015, real-time metabolome profiling was demonstrated for the first time.

== Metabolome ==
The metabolome refers to the complete set of small-molecule (&lt;1.5 kDa) metabolites (such as metabolic intermediates, hormones and other signaling molecules, and secondary metabolites) to be found within a biological sample, such as a single organism. The word was coined in analogy with transcriptomics and proteomics; like the transcriptome and the proteome, the metabolome is dynamic, changing from second to second. Although the metabolome can be defined readily enough, it is not currently possible to analyse the entire range of metabolites by a single analytical method.

In January 2007, scientists at the University of Alberta and the University of Calgary completed the first draft of the human metabolome. The Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) is perhaps the most extensive public metabolomic spectral database to date and is a freely available electronic database (www.hmdb.ca) containing detailed information about small molecule metabolites found in the human body. It is intended to be used for applications in metabolomics, clinical chemistry, biomarker discovery and general education. The database is designed to contain or link three kinds of data:
# Chemical data,
# Clinical data and
# Molecular biology/biochemistry data.
The database contains 220,945 metabolite entries including both water-soluble and lipid soluble metabolites. Additionally, 8,610 protein sequences (enzymes and transporters) are linked to these metabolite entries. Each MetaboCard entry contains 130 data fields with 2/3 of the information being devoted to chemical/clinical data and the other 1/3 devoted to enzymatic or biochemical data. The version 3.5 of the HMDB contains &gt;16,000 endogenous metabolites, &gt;1,500 drugs and &gt;22,000 food constituents or food metabolites. This information, available at the Human Metabolome Database and based on analysis of information available in the current scientific literature, is far from complete. In contrast, much more is known about the metabolomes of other organisms. For example, over 50,000 metabolites have been characterized from the plant kingdom, and many thousands of metabolites have been identified and/or characterized from single plants.

Each type of cell and tissue has a unique metabolic ‘fingerprint’ that can elucidate organ or tissue-specific information. Bio-specimens used for metabolomics analysis include but not limit to plasma, serum, urine, saliva, feces, muscle, sweat, exhaled breath and gastrointestinal fluid. The ease of collection facilitates high temporal resolution, and because they are always at dynamic equilibrium with the body, they can describe the host as a whole. Genome can tell what could happen, transcriptome can tell what appears to be happening, proteome can tell what makes it happen and metabolome can tell what has happened and what is happening.

== Metabolites ==

Metabolites are the substrates, intermediates and products of metabolism. Within the context of metabolomics, a metabolite is usually defined as any molecule less than 1.5 kDa in size. However, there are exceptions to this depending on the sample and detection method. For example, macromolecules such as lipoproteins and albumin are reliably detected in NMR-based metabolomics studies of blood plasma. In plant-based metabolomics, it is common to refer to &quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot; metabolites. A primary metabolite is directly involved in the normal growth, development, and reproduction. A secondary metabolite is not directly involved in those processes, but usually has important ecological function. Examples include antibiotics and pigments. By contrast, in human-based metabolomics, it is more common to describe metabolites as being either endogenous (produced by the host organism) or exogenous. Metabolites of foreign substances such as drugs are termed xenometabolites.

The metabolome derives from a large network of metabolic reactions, where outputs from one enzymatic chemical reaction are inputs to other chemical reactions. Such systems have been described as hypercycles.

== Metabonomics ==

Metabonomics is defined as &quot;the quantitative measurement of the dynamic multiparametric metabolic response of living systems to pathophysiological stimuli or genetic modification&quot;. The word origin is from the Greek &quot;μεταβολή&quot; meaning change and &quot;nomos&quot; meaning a rule set or set of laws. This approach was pioneered by Jeremy Nicholson at Murdoch University and has been used in toxicology, disease diagnosis and a number of other fields. Historically, the metabonomics approach was one of the first methods to apply the scope of systems biology to studies of metabolism.

There has been some disagreement over the exact differences between &#x27;metabolomics&#x27; and &#x27;metabonomics&#x27;. The difference between the two terms is not related to choice of analytical platform: although metabonomics is more associated with NMR spectroscopy and metabolomics with mass spectrometry-based techniques, this is simply because of usages amongst different groups that have popularized the different terms. While there is still no absolute agreement, there is a growing consensus that &#x27;metabolomics&#x27; places a greater emphasis on metabolic profiling at a cellular or organ level and is primarily concerned with normal endogenous metabolism. &#x27;Metabonomics&#x27; extends metabolic profiling to include information about perturbations of metabolism caused by environmental factors (including diet and toxins), disease processes, and the involvement of extragenomic influences, such as gut microflora. This is not a trivial difference; metabolomic studies should, by definition, exclude metabolic contributions from extragenomic sources, because these are external to the system being studied. However, in practice, within the field of human disease research there is still a large degree of overlap in the way both terms are used, and they are often in effect synonymous.

== Exometabolomics ==

Exometabolomics, or &quot;metabolic footprinting&quot;, is the study of extracellular metabolites. It uses many techniques from other subfields of metabolomics, and has applications in biofuel development, bioprocessing, determining drugs&#x27; mechanism of action, and studying intercellular interactions.

== Analytical technologies ==

The typical workflow of metabolomics studies is shown in the figure. First, samples are collected from tissue, plasma, urine, saliva, cells, etc. Next, metabolites extracted often with the addition of internal standards and derivatization. During sample analysis, metabolites are quantified (liquid chromatography or gas chromatography coupled with MS and/or NMR spectroscopy). The raw output data can be used for metabolite feature extraction and further processed before statistical analysis (such as principal component analysis, PCA). Many bioinformatic tools and software are available to identify associations with disease states and outcomes, determine significant correlations, and characterize metabolic signatures with existing biological knowledge.

=== Separation methods ===
Initially, analytes in a metabolomic sample comprise a highly complex mixture. This complex mixture can be simplified prior to detection by separating some analytes from others. Separation achieves various goals: analytes which cannot be resolved by the detector may be separated in this step; in MS analysis, ion suppression is reduced; the retention time of the analyte serves as information regarding its identity. This separation step is not mandatory and is often omitted in NMR and &quot;shotgun&quot; based approaches such as shotgun lipidomics.

Gas chromatography (GC), especially when interfaced with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), is a widely used separation technique for metabolomic analysis. GC offers very high chromatographic resolution, and can be used in conjunction with a flame ionization detector (GC/FID) or a mass spectrometer (GC-MS). The method is especially useful for identification and quantification of small and volatile molecules. However, a practical limitation of GC is the requirement of chemical derivatization for many biomolecules as only volatile chemicals can be analysed without derivatization. In cases where greater resolving power is required, two-dimensional chromatography (GCxGC) can be applied.

High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has emerged as the most common separation technique for metabolomic analysis. With the advent of electrospray ionization, HPLC was coupled to MS. In contrast with GC, HPLC has lower chromatographic resolution, but requires no derivatization for polar molecules, and separates molecules in the liquid phase. Additionally HPLC has the advantage that a much wider range of analytes can be measured with a higher sensitivity than GC methods.

Capillary electrophoresis (CE) has a higher theoretical separation efficiency than HPLC (although requiring much more time per separation), and is suitable for use with a wider range of metabolite classes than is GC. As for all electrophoretic techniques, it is most appropriate for charged analytes.

In direct-infusion mass spectrometry (DI-MS), sample is directly introduced into the spectrometer and separation steps are skipped. DI-MS can be employed to perform single cell metabolic analysis of human cells.

=== Detection methods ===
Mass spectrometry (MS) is used to identify and quantify metabolites after optional separation by GC, HPLC, or CE. GC-MS was the first hyphenated technique to be developed. Identification leverages the distinct patterns in which analytes fragment. These patterns can be thought of as a mass spectral fingerprint. Libraries exist that allow identification of a metabolite according to this fragmentation pattern . MS is both sensitive and can be very specific. There are also a number of techniques which use MS as a stand-alone technology: the sample is infused directly into the mass spectrometer with no prior separation, and the MS provides sufficient selectivity to both separate and to detect metabolites.

For analysis by mass spectrometry, the analytes must be imparted with a charge and transferred to the gas phase. Electron ionization (EI) is the most common ionization technique applied to GC separations as it is amenable to low pressures. EI also produces fragmentation of the analyte, both providing structural information while increasing the complexity of the data and possibly obscuring the molecular ion. Atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization (APCI) is an atmospheric pressure technique that can be applied to all the above separation techniques. APCI is a gas phase ionization method, which provides slightly more aggressive ionization than ESI which is suitable for less polar compounds. Electrospray ionization (ESI) is the most common ionization technique applied in LC/MS. This soft ionization is most successful for polar molecules with ionizable functional groups. Another commonly used soft ionization technique is secondary electrospray ionization (SESI).

In the 2000s, surface-based mass analysis has seen a resurgence, with new MS technologies focused on increasing sensitivity, minimizing background, and reducing sample preparation. The ability to analyze metabolites directly from biofluids and tissues continues to challenge current MS technology, largely because of the limits imposed by the complexity of these samples, which contain thousands to tens of thousands of metabolites. Among the technologies being developed to address this challenge is Nanostructure-Initiator MS (NIMS), a desorption/ ionization approach that does not require the application of matrix and thereby facilitates small-molecule (i.e., metabolite) identification. MALDI is also used; however, the application of a MALDI matrix can add significant background at that complicates analysis of the low-mass range (i.e., metabolites). In addition, the size of the resulting matrix crystals limits the spatial resolution that can be achieved in tissue imaging. Because of these limitations, several other matrix-free desorption/ionization approaches have been applied to the analysis of biofluids and tissues.

Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) was one of the first matrix-free desorption/ionization approaches used to analyze metabolites from biological samples. SIMS uses a high-energy primary ion beam to desorb and generate secondary ions from a surface. The primary advantage of SIMS is its high spatial resolution (as small as 50 nm), a powerful characteristic for tissue imaging with MS. However, SIMS has yet to be readily applied to the analysis of biofluids and tissues because of its limited sensitivity at and analyte fragmentation generated by the high-energy primary ion beam. Desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) is a matrix-free technique for analyzing biological samples that uses a charged solvent spray to desorb ions from a surface. Advantages of DESI are that no special surface is required and the analysis is performed at ambient pressure with full access to the sample during acquisition. A limitation of DESI is spatial resolution because &quot;focusing&quot; the charged solvent spray is difficult. However, a recent development termed laser ablation ESI (LAESI) is a promising approach to circumvent this limitation. Most recently, ion trap techniques such as orbitrap mass spectrometry are also applied to metabolomics research.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the only detection technique which does not rely on separation of the analytes, and the sample can thus be recovered for further analyses. All kinds of small molecule metabolites can be measured simultaneously - in this sense, NMR is close to being a universal detector. The main advantages of NMR are high analytical reproducibility and simplicity of sample preparation. Practically, however, it is relatively insensitive compared to mass spectrometry-based techniques.

Although NMR and MS are the most widely used modern-day techniques for detection, there are other methods in use. These include Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance, ion-mobility spectrometry, electrochemical detection (coupled to HPLC), Raman spectroscopy and radiolabel (when combined with thin-layer chromatography).

== Statistical methods ==
The data generated in metabolomics usually consist of measurements performed on subjects under various conditions. These measurements may be digitized spectra, or a list of metabolite features. In its simplest form, this generates a matrix with rows corresponding to subjects and columns corresponding with metabolite features (or vice versa). Several statistical programs are currently available for analysis of both NMR and mass spectrometry data. A great number of free software are already available for the analysis of metabolomics data shown in the table. Some statistical tools listed in the table were designed for NMR data analyses were also useful for MS data. For mass spectrometry data, software is available that identifies molecules that vary in subject groups on the basis of mass-over-charge value and sometimes retention time depending on the experimental design.

Once metabolite data matrix is determined, unsupervised data reduction techniques (e.g. PCA) can be used to elucidate patterns and connections. In many studies, including those evaluating drug-toxicity and some disease models, the metabolites of interest are not known &quot;a priori&quot;. This makes unsupervised methods, those with no prior assumptions of class membership, a popular first choice. The most common of these methods includes principal component analysis (PCA) which can efficiently reduce the dimensions of a dataset to a few which explain the greatest variation. When analyzed in the lower-dimensional PCA space, clustering of samples with similar metabolic fingerprints can be detected. PCA algorithms aim to replace all correlated variables with a much smaller number of uncorrelated variables (referred to as principal components (PCs)) and retain most of the information in the original dataset. This clustering can elucidate patterns and assist in the determination of disease biomarkers – metabolites that correlate most with class membership.

Linear models are commonly used for metabolomics data, but are affected by multicollinearity. On the other hand, multivariate statistics are thriving methods for high-dimensional correlated metabolomics data, of which the most popular one is Projection to Latent Structures (PLS) regression and its classification version PLS-DA. Other data mining methods, such as random forest, support-vector machines, etc. are received increasing attention for untargeted metabolomics data analysis. In the case of univariate methods, variables are analyzed one by one using classical statistics tools (such as Student&#x27;s t-test, ANOVA or mixed models) and only these with sufficient small p-values are considered relevant. However, correction strategies should be used to reduce false discoveries when multiple comparisons are conducted since there is no standard method for measuring the total amount of metabolites directly in untargeted metabolomics. For multivariate analysis, models should always be validated to ensure that the results can be generalized.

== Machine learning and data mining ==
Machine learning is a powerful tool that can be used in metabolomics analysis. Recently, scientists have developed retention time prediction software. These tools allow researchers to apply artificial intelligence to the retention time prediction of small molecules in complex mixture, such as human plasma, plant extracts, foods, or microbial cultures. Retention time prediction increases the identification rate in liquid chromatography and can lead to an improved biological interpretation of metabolomics data.

== Key applications ==
Toxicity assessment/toxicology by metabolic profiling (especially of urine or blood plasma samples) detects the physiological changes caused by toxic insult of a chemical (or mixture of chemicals). In many cases, the observed changes can be related to specific syndromes, e.g. a specific lesion in liver or kidney. This is of particular relevance to pharmaceutical companies wanting to test the toxicity of potential drug candidates: if a compound can be eliminated before it reaches clinical trials on the grounds of adverse toxicity, it saves the enormous expense of the trials.

For functional genomics, metabolomics can be an excellent tool for determining the phenotype caused by a genetic manipulation, such as gene deletion or insertion. Sometimes this can be a sufficient goal in itself—for instance, to detect any phenotypic changes in a genetically modified plant intended for human or animal consumption. More exciting is the prospect of predicting the function of unknown genes by comparison with the metabolic perturbations caused by deletion/insertion of known genes. Such advances are most likely to come from model organisms such as &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; and &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;. The Cravatt laboratory at the Scripps Research Institute has recently applied this technology to mammalian systems, identifying the &quot;N&quot;-acyltaurines as previously uncharacterized endogenous substrates for the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and the monoalkylglycerol ethers (MAGEs) as endogenous substrates for the uncharacterized hydrolase KIAA1363.

Metabologenomics is a novel approach to integrate metabolomics and genomics data by correlating microbial-exported metabolites with predicted biosynthetic genes. This bioinformatics-based pairing method enables natural product discovery at a larger-scale by refining non-targeted metabolomic analyses to identify small molecules with related biosynthesis and to focus on those that may not have previously well known structures.

Fluxomics is a further development of metabolomics. The disadvantage of metabolomics is that it only provides the user with abundances or concentrations of metabolites, while fluxomics determines the reaction rates of metabolic reactions and can trace metabolites in a biological system over time.

Nutrigenomics is a generalised term which links genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics to human nutrition. In general, in a given body fluid, a metabolome is influenced by endogenous factors such as age, sex, body composition and genetics as well as underlying pathologies. The large bowel microflora are also a very significant potential confounder of metabolic profiles and could be classified as either an endogenous or exogenous factor. The main exogenous factors are diet and drugs. Diet can then be broken down to nutrients and non-nutrients. Metabolomics is one means to determine a biological endpoint, or metabolic fingerprint, which reflects the balance of all these forces on an individual&#x27;s metabolism. Thanks to recent cost reductions, metabolomics has now become accessible for companion animals, such as pregnant dogs.

Plant metabolomics is designed to study the overall changes in metabolites of plant samples and then conduct deep data mining and chemometric analysis. Specialized metabolites are considered components of plant defense systems biosynthesized in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Metabolomics approaches have recently been used to assess the natural variance in metabolite content between individual plants, an approach with great potential for the improvement of the compositional quality of crops.

<doc id="1029213" wikidata="Q7087888" url="?curid=1029213" title="Oliver Trask">
<text>Oliver Trask is a fictional character on the FOX television series &quot;The O.C.&quot;, portrayed by Taylor Handley. Oliver appeared in the series&#x27; first season as a thorn in Ryan Atwood and Marissa Cooper&#x27;s relationship, soon developing a severe obsession with the latter. After holding Marissa captive at gunpoint in his penthouse, Oliver was arrested and sent to a rehabilitation clinic.

==Character development==

===Concept and creation===
Oliver was created by Josh Schwartz, whose concept for the character was &quot;based on a guy...a friend of mine dated who faked having cancer to [hang on to her].&quot; Schwartz said of the guy &quot;That kind of desperation and loneliness was really fascinating to me, and that&#x27;s what inspired the Oliver character.&quot;

===Characterization===

Taylor Handley says of his character that &quot;Oliver is very intelligent, (...) and intelligent people are good manipulators.&quot; Handley also elaborated that &quot;[his] character is very needy due to his past&quot; which would take some of Marissa&#x27;s attention away from Ryan, and that, by request, he dyed his hair dark for the show to give &quot;a more sinister look&quot;.

Oliver used to go to a school referred to as &quot;Pacific&quot;. At his former school Oliver was obsessed with a girl and cut his wrists. She had a restraining order filed against him, and later attended rehabilitation.

==Storylines==
According to Schwartz the storyline was &quot;designed as a six-episode arc where we would bring in a character whose circumstances coming into this world were not unlike Ryan&#x27;s&quot;.

===Season 1===
Oliver Trask is a rich kid who lives in the penthouse of a hotel. His parents own a chain of hotels, and are largely absent from his life. He left his last school, Pacific High, because a girl took out a restraining order against him, after he became obsessed with her. Oliver eventually attempts suicide because she rejects him. He meets Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton) at therapy, and falls for her and transfers to Harbor to get close to her. Marissa initially thinks of him as merely a casual friend, and so doesn&#x27;t notice anything sinister in his constant presence in her life. Marissa&#x27;s boyfriend, Ryan Atwood (Ben McKenzie), doesn&#x27;t trust him, and warns Marissa about her new friend&#x27;s intentions. Marissa and many of their friends dismiss Ryan&#x27;s warnings as jealousy; Luke Ward (Chris Carmack) believes him, however, having taken an instant dislike to Oliver.

In the episode &quot;The Truth&quot;, Oliver invites Marissa to his parents&#x27; penthouse hotel room. Once there, he becomes possessive and threatening, and refuses to let Marissa leave, producing a gun and threatening to kill himself when she calls Ryan in tears. Ryan bursts in and pleads with Oliver to put the gun down for Marissa&#x27;s sake. Oliver does so, and is led away in police custody.

==Reception==
&quot;TV Guide&quot; described Oliver as a &quot;clichéd plot device&quot; and a &quot;cookie-cutter villain&quot;, but Schwartz said that reception was mixed with viewers loving the character as &quot;someone that we love to hate.&quot; Other reception noted that he was irritating but &quot;addicting person to watch&quot;, that he &quot;was able to exude as much hate that a writer could place on a single character&quot;, and that he was an &quot;audience-infuriating nut&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; included him their list of &quot;21 Most Annoying TV Characters Ever&quot;, commenting: &quot;Oliver (Taylor Handley) was around for only six episodes, but it seemed like much longer. Just the mention of Oliver&#x27;s name still makes us brood.&quot;

==Effect==
Oliver&#x27;s appearance lasted only a few episodes - from &quot;The Best Chrismukkah Ever&quot; (Season 1, Episode 13) to &quot;The Truth&quot; (Season 1, Episode 18). However, the character&#x27;s actions had long term implications. Already existing trust issues between Ryan and Marissa were exacerbated by the conflict over Oliver&#x27;s true colors. It is argued by Seth in &quot;The Ties that Bind&quot; (Season 1, Episode 27) that Marissa&#x27;s relationship with Oliver may have driven Ryan to seek solace with Theresa, resulting in the scandal over Theresa&#x27;s pregnancy and marriage that arises in the final episodes of the show&#x27;s first season and into the second season.

==Rumors==
It was rumoured that Oliver would return for the finale of season two. These rumours were untrue (though in the second season finale, after Seth hears a door bell ring he quips: &quot;With the way things are going right now, I bet that&#x27;s Oliver.&quot; This could have been a reference to these rumors, but was more likely due to how badly things seemed to be going for the characters.) Schwartz made repeated references to Oliver&#x27;s return. He is quoted as stating that a return was the alternative option to the lesbian storyline between Marissa and Alex. After the finale for that season aired, rumors then arose that Oliver would return in the third season with Kirsten, who was in rehab for alcoholism. However, this never happened, although in the third season finale when Marissa apologizes to Ryan for all the craziness, Ryan assures that he would not have done anything different, &quot;except for maybe Oliver,&quot; to which Marissa laughed and said &quot;me too.&quot;

<text>Heinrich Gottlieb Ludwig Reichenbach (8 January 1793 – 17 March 1879) was a German botanist, ornithologist and illustrator. It was he who first requested Leopold Blaschka to make a set of glass marine invertebrate models for scientific education and museum showcasing, the successful commission giving rise to the creation of the Blaschkas&#x27; Glass sea creatures and, subsequently and indirectly, the more famous Glass Flowers.

==Early life==
Born in Leipzig and the son of Johann Friedrich Jakob Reichenbach (the author in 1818 of the first Greek-German dictionary) Reichenbach studied medicine and natural science at the University of Leipzig in 1810 and, eight years later in 1818, he the now Professor became an instructor before, in 1820, he was appointed the director of the Dresden natural history museum and a professor at the Surgical-Medical Academy in Dresden, where he remained for many years. Together with Carl Friedrich Heinrich Schubert he started in 1822 to edit and distribute his first exsiccata work &quot;Lichenes exsiccati collecti atque descripti auctoribus L. Reichenbach et C. Schubert. Die Flechten in getrockneten Exemplaren, gesammelt und beschrieben von L. Reichenbach und C. Schubert&quot;. Later on he published several other exsiccatae, an example being &quot;Flora Germanica exsiccata sive Herbarium normale plantarum selectarum criticarumve, in Germania propria vel in adjacente Borussia, Austria et Hungaria, Tyroli, Helvetia Belgiaque nascentim, concinnatum editumque a Societate Florae Germanicae curante&quot;. For distributing and exchanging plant specimens he cooperated with many botanists, e.g., Friedrich Wilhelm Noë.

==Glass sea creatures==

Director of the natural history museum in Dresden, Professor Reichenbach was faced with an annoying yet seemingly unsolvable problem of showing invertebrate marine life. Land-based flora and fauna was not an issue, for it was a relatively simple matter to exhibit mounted and stuffed creatures such as gorillas and elephants, their lifelike poses attracting and exciting the museums&#x27; visitors. Invertebrates, however, by their very nature, posed a problem. In the 19th century the only method practised for showcasing them was to take a live specimen and place it in a sealed jar of alcohol. This killed it but, more importantly, time and a lack of hard parts eventually rendered the specimen little more than a colorless floating blob of jelly, making it neither pretty nor an effective teaching tool. Prof. Reichenbach wanted something more, specifically 3D colored models of marine invertebrates that were both lifelike and able to stand the test of time. In 1863, he &quot;saw an exhibition of highly detailed, realistic glass flowers created by a Bohemian Lampworker, Leopold Blaschka, at an exhibition hosted by Prince Camille de Rohan;&quot; and it was the Prince who first introduced Reichenbach to Leopold Blaschka.

Enchanted by the botanical models and positive that Leopold held the key to ending his own showcasing issue, in 1863 Reichenbach convinced and commissioned Leopold to produce twelve model sea anemones. These marine models, hailed as &quot;an artistic marvel in the field of science and a scientific marvel in the field of art,&quot; were exactly what Prof. Reichenbach needed and, at last, provided an outlet for the wonder Leopold had felt all those years ago when observing the phosphorescent ocean life. The key fact, though, was that these glass marine models were, as would soon be acknowledged, &quot;perfectly true to nature,&quot; and as such represented an extraordinary opportunity both for the scientific community and the Blaschkas themselves. Knowing this and thrilled with his newly acquired set of glass sea creatures, Reichenbach advised Leopold to drop his current and generations long family business of glass fancy goods and the like in favor of selling glass marine invertebrates to museums, aquaria, universities, and private collectors. Advice which would prove wise and fateful both economically and scientifically, for Leopold did as the Dresden natural history museum director suggested. A decision which swiftly sparked the Blaschkas&#x27; highly lucrative mail-order business of selling Glass sea creatures to interested parties across the globe. Poetically, though Reichenbach did not know it, many years later his showcasing problem and manner of finding the Blaschkas would be repeated by Harvard Professor George Lincoln Goodale - Goodale getting the idea for the creation of the Glass Flowers from Harvard&#x27;s own collection of Glass sea creatures.

Sadly, however, the original six glass sea anemones purchased by Ludwig Reichenbach in 1863 as well as the rest of that first collection was destroyed in the Bombing of Dresden in World War II.

==Later career==

He was later the founder of the Dresden botanical gardens and joint founder of Dresden Zoo. The museum&#x27;s zoological collection was almost completely destroyed by the fire in the Zwinger palace during the constitutional crisis of 1849, but Reichenbach was able to replace it within only a few years. This collection is the basis of that seen in the museum today. Reichenbach was a prolific author and able botanical artist. His works included (1823–32, 10 vols.) and (1851–54).

===Honors===
He was honoured by having several plants and animals named after him including &quot;Iris reichenbachii&quot; Heuff., &quot;Viola reichenbachiana&quot; Jord. ex Bor. (syn. &quot;V. sylvatica&quot; (Hartm.) Fr. ex Hartm. and &quot;V. sylvestris&quot; Lam. p.p.) (the slender wood violet). Dr. Reichenbach oversaw a world-famous botanical garden in Dresden with a great collection of cacti, and &quot;Echinocactus reichenbachii&quot; a beautiful cactus of the south-central U.S. and northern Mexico was named in his honor. Reichenbach&#x27;s sunbird (&quot;Anabathmis reichenbachii&quot;) is also named after him. This botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation Rchb. when citing a botanical name. Finally, he was also the father of Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach, equally a botanist and an eminent orchid specialist.

==Death==

Reichenbach died in 1879 and was interred in the Trinity Cemetery in Dresden Johannstadt. The tomb, however, was cleared after abandoning the right to use. However, the cemetery administration had not awarded the grave site, so that at the initiative of the Senckenberg Natural History Collections in Dresden, a stele was erected, which was unveiled on September 11, 2011.

<doc id="1029243" wikidata="Q187196" url="?curid=1029243" title="Time in New Zealand">
<text>Time in New Zealand is divided by law into two standard time zones. The main islands use New Zealand Standard Time (NZST), 12 hours in advance of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) / military M (Mike), while the outlying Chatham Islands use Chatham Standard Time (CHAST), 12 hours 45 minutes in advance of UTC / military M^ (Mike-Three).

During summer months – from the last Sunday in September until the first Sunday in April – daylight saving time is observed and clocks are advanced one hour. New Zealand Daylight Time (NZDT) is 13 hours ahead of UTC, and Chatham Daylight Time (CHADT) 13 hours 45 minutes ahead.

New Zealand&#x27;s associated states – the Cook Islands and Niue – and the dependent territory of Tokelau use several different time zones at their own discretion.

== History ==
On 2 November 1868, New Zealand officially adopted a standard time to be observed nationally, and was the first country to do so, about fifteen years before any other. Chatham Island was 45 minutes ahead of mainland New Zealand [twelve hours and fifteen minutes ahead of Coordinated Universal Time]. It was based on longitude 172° 30′ East of Greenwich, hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This standard was known as New Zealand Mean Time (NZMT).

In 1941, during the Second World War, clocks were advanced half an hour, to reduce electric power use making New Zealand 12 hours ahead of GMT. This change was made permanent from 1946 by the &quot;Standard Time Act 1945&quot;, at which the time at the 180°E meridian was made the basis for New Zealand Time. NZST remained half an hour ahead of NZMT, and the Chatham Islands 45 minutes ahead of NZST.
In the late 1940s the atomic clock was developed and several laboratories began atomic time scales. A new time scale known as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) was adopted internationally in 1972. This was based on the readings of atomic clocks, updated periodically in accordance with time variations in the Earth&#x27;s rotation by the addition or deletion of seconds (called leap seconds). The &quot;Time Act 1974&quot; defines New Zealand Standard Time as 12 hours in advance of UTC.

In 2011, the New Zealand dependency of Tokelau moved its time zone forward by 24 hours, by skipping 30 December to be in the UTC+13:00 time zone, the same zone as New Zealand daylight saving.

== Daylight saving time (DST) ==
Starting in 1909, a member of Parliament, Sir Thomas Kay Sidey annually put forward a bill to advance the clocks an hour from September to the following March and the &quot;Summer Time Act 1927&quot; succeeded. In 1927, clocks were advanced by an hour from first Sunday in November to the first Sunday in March. This proved unpopular, so the &quot;Summer Time Act 1928&quot; revised this to a &quot;half&quot;-hour shift from 14 October 1928 (second Sunday) to 17 March 1929 (third Sunday), then the &quot;Summer Time Act 1929&quot; permanently fixed this half-hour shift to run from the second Sunday in October to the third Sunday in March every year. In 1933, the period was extended from the first Sunday in September to the last Sunday in April. This continued until the Second World War, when emergency regulations in 1941 extended daylight saving to cover the whole year with annual re-applications until the &quot;Standard Time Act 1945&quot; made the abandonment of NZMT permanent in 1946, so that 180° becomes the base longitude and what was called NZ Summer Time (NZST) became NZ Standard Time.

The &quot;Time Act 1974&quot; empowered the governor-general to declare by Order in Council a period when daylight saving time is to be observed. This was a one-hour shift (on top of the earlier half-hour shift) from the first Sunday in November to the last Sunday in February, promptly changed the next year by The New Zealand Time Order 1975 which fixed the period of observance from the last Sunday in October to the first Sunday in March.

In 1985 a comprehensive survey was undertaken by the Department of Internal Affairs. Public attitudes towards NZDT (New Zealand Daylight Time) and its effects on work, recreation and particular groups of people in society were surveyed. The survey indicated that 76.2% of the population wanted NZDT either continued or extended.
The survey also concluded that opinion on the topic differed little between sexes, and that support for NZDT was generally higher in urban centres. Daylight saving was famously opposed in the small Northland dairy farming community of Ararua, which refused to adjust its clocks for some years. Support for shortening or abolishing NZDT was always in the minority in the areas surveyed.

As a consequence of the survey and further feedback from the public, in 1988 the Minister of Internal Affairs arranged for a trial period of extended NZDT to be held from the second Sunday in October 1989 to the third Sunday in March 1990. The Minister invited the public to write to him with their views on the five-week extension.

The &quot;Daylight Time Order 1990&quot; declared that NZDT would run from 02:00 NZST on the first Sunday in October to 03:00 NZDT on the third Sunday in March.

On 30 April 2007 the government announced that it had extended the daylight saving period from 24 to 27 weeks. From September 2007, daylight saving is now observed from the last Sunday in September until the first Sunday in April. From 30 April 2007, DST begins at 02:00 NZST on the last Sunday in September each year, and ends at 03:00 NZDT (or 02:00 NZST as defined in the 1974 Act) on the first Sunday in April.

New Zealand time, including DST, is used by several Antarctic bases that are supplied from New Zealand. This results in the oddity that the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station sets its clocks an hour further ahead during the southern summer, when the sun is constantly above the horizon, than in the southern winter, when the sun is constantly below the horizon. The extreme geographic position of the base means that no possible adjustment of the daily activity cycle can have any effect on the amount of sunlight received during those activities. However, the arrangement presumably makes real time communications with New Zealand more practical, particularly in dealing with offices.

The other countries in the Realm of New Zealand – Cook Islands, Niue, and Tokelau – do not maintain DST. Two of them are on the other side of the International Date Line and have 22–24 hours time difference to New Zealand.

The following table lists recent and near future starting and ending dates of daylight saving time in the main islands of New Zealand:

== Standards ==
New Zealand standard time is maintained by the Measurement Standards Laboratory (MSL), part of New Zealand Government. New Zealand standard time is based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). UTC is kept within 200 nanoseconds of the international atomic time scale maintained by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Paris.

It is disseminated by various means, including time pips broadcast on Radio New Zealand, speaking clock and Network Time Protocol.

==Dependencies and associated states==
There are two associated states of New Zealand in the Pacific Ocean, both on the other side of the International Date Line:
* The Cook Islands are in the UTC−10:00 time zone or Military W (Whiskey) and do not observe daylight saving time. Clocks in the Cook Islands are 22 or 23 hours behind New Zealand: at noon on Thursday in New Zealand, it is 13:00 or 14:00 on Wednesday in the Cook Islands.
* Niue is in the UTC−11:00 time zone or Military X (X-ray) and does not observe daylight saving time. Clocks in Niue are 23 or 24 hours behind New Zealand: at noon on Thursday in New Zealand, it is noon or 1 pm on Wednesday in Niue.

The New Zealand dependency of Tokelau is in the UTC+13:00 time zone or Military M&#x27; (Mike Prime) and does not observe daylight saving time. Clocks in Tokelau are set to the same time as or 1 hour ahead of New Zealand: at noon on Thursday in New Zealand, it is 12:00 or 13:00 on Thursday in Tokelau.

The Ross Dependency, McMurdo Station and Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica maintain NZST/NZDT.

<text>Parlay X was a set of standard Web service APIs for the telephone network (fixed and mobile). It is defunct and now replaced by OneAPI, which is the current valid standard from the GSM association for Telecom third party API.

It enables software developers to use the capabilities of an underlying network. The APIs are deliberately high level abstractions and designed to be simple to use. An application developer can, for example, invoke a single Web Service request to get the location of a mobile device or initiate a telephone call.

The Parlay X Web services are defined jointly by ETSI, the Parlay Group, and the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). OMA has done the maintenance of the specifications for 3GPP release 8. 

The APIs are defined using Web Service technology: interfaces are defined using WSDL 1.1 and conform with Web Services Interoperability (WS-I Basic Profile). 

The APIs are published as a set of specifications.

In general Parlay X provides an abstraction of functionality exposed by the more complex, but functionally richer Parlay APIs. 
ETSI provide a set of (informative not normative) Parlay X to Parlay mapping documents. 

Parlay X services have been rolled out by a number of telecom operators, including BT, Korea Telecom, T-Com, Mobilekom and Sprint.

<doc id="1029247" wikidata="Q468054" url="?curid=1029247" title="Mick Mars">
<text>Robert Alan Deal (born May 4, 1951), known professionally as Mick Mars, is an American musician best known as the former lead guitarist and co-founder of the heavy metal band Mötley Crüe, being the oldest of the four original members. He is known for his aggressive, melodic solos and bluesy riffs.

== Early life ==
Mars was born Robert Alan Deal, in Terre Haute, Indiana, in 1951. Soon after, his family moved to Huntington, Indiana. Before he was nine years old, his family relocated again, this time to Garden Grove, California. He realized he wanted to become a musician at only three years of age, when his parents took him to see country singer Skeeter Bonn at a local 4-H Fair in Indiana. &quot;He was wearing a bright-orange outfit with rhinestones all over the place, and a big white Stetson hat. I went, &#x27;I&#x27;m doing that. That&#x27;s what I want to do.&#x27;&quot; He attended Westminster High School.

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
His parents bought him his first guitar at age 12 and he began a relentless practice routine, thinking only of becoming a successful musician. He began at age 14 as bassist in a Beatles cover group called The Jades before switching to lead guitar. He dropped out of high school and began playing guitar in a series of unsuccessful blues-based rock bands throughout the 1970s.

In his early 20s, he took a job in an industrial laundromat operating heavy machinery while moonlighting with his band Wahtoshi in the local club circuit. After recovering from a serious injury to one of his hands suffered in a workplace accident, he quit to focus on music full time. In 1973, he joined a cover band called White Horse and soon began to be recognized as an accomplished guitarist. &quot;He could copy parts note for note. You give him &quot;Highway Star&quot; and he could nail Ritchie Blackmore&#x27;s riffs,&quot; said ex-White Horse bassist Harry Clay.

Former White Horse drummer Jack Valentine says that Mars began using various aliases in the 1970s such as Zorky Charlemagne as a means of avoiding the police, as he was behind on child-support payments to ex-girlfriend Sharon, the mother of two of his children. &quot;Any time we got pulled over by the cops for a taillight or whatever, and the cops saw his ID, they’d throw him in jail. We&#x27;d have to figure a way to get him out,&quot; recalled Valentine.

White Horse had a promising future, and Mars (still known as Bob Deal) began drawing comparisons to another young guitarist named Eddie Van Halen of a rival club band named Mammoth. &quot;Mick Mars and Eddie Van Halen were the two hottest guitar players in LA. There probably weren&#x27;t two better guitar players on the planet,&quot; said Valentine. Mars eventually left White Horse when the band decided to play disco music in the hopes of achieving greater success.

He then joined a pop group called Video Nu-R and released the singles &quot;Gypsy Woman/You Drive Me Crazy&quot; in 1978 and &quot;Work, Work/Decadence Plus&quot; in 1979. These singles marked Mars&#x27; recording debut.

=== Mötley Crüe ===
After nearly a decade of frustration on the California club circuit, he made the decision to reinvent himself. He shaved off his trademark mustache, changed his legal name from Bob Deal to Mick Mars, and dyed his hair jet black, hoping for a fresh start. In April 1980 he placed an ad in the LA newspaper &quot;The Recycler&quot;, describing himself as &quot;a loud, rude and aggressive guitar player&quot; in need of a band. Nikki Sixx and Tommy Lee, who were putting together a new band which would soon become Mötley Crüe, contacted him and hired him after hearing him play. Lee opened the door and recalled &quot;he&#x27;s standing there looking like Cousin Itt from The Addams Family&quot; and immediately turned to Sixx and said &quot;This is our guy, he&#x27;s perfect, he&#x27;s disgusting and scary&quot;.

The name Mötley Crüe came about at the suggestion of Mars. In the early days of White Horse, someone had referred to the band as a &quot;motley looking crew&quot; and Motley Crew was a name they had initially considered using. Sixx liked the name and subsequently altered it to Mötley Crüe.

One of the most influential heavy metal groups of the 1980s, Mötley Crüe has sold over 100 million albums worldwide. They have also achieved seven multiplatinum and five platinum US certifications, nine Top 10 albums on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, twenty-two Top 40 mainstream rock hits, and six Top 20 pop singles.

While Mötley Crüe gained a well-deserved reputation for partying, Mars was never a fan of drugs. &quot;I went, &#x27;Please don&#x27;t ever, ever do smack. You can&#x27;t make music when you&#x27;re falling down&#x27;,&quot; he told his bandmates when heroin began to enter the picture. He did, however, develop a serious drinking problem after joining the band.

During the recording of their &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot; album in 1989 Mars reportedly used so many amplifiers on his guitar that sounds of his guitar could be heard on the recordings of Aerosmith&#x27;s album &quot;Pump&quot;, which was being recorded in the same studio at the time:

When the band made the decision to fire vocalist John Corabi and reunite with original vocalist Vince Neil in 1997 for &quot;Generation Swine&quot;, Mars was not involved in the decision making process. &quot;They had no respect for Mick,&quot; Corabi said. &quot;Mick was just the grumpy old bastard to them. [Sixx and Lee] gave Mick shit about his finances and the girls he dated. He&#x27;d been dealing with over 20 years of this.&quot; Mars refers to the &quot;Generation Swine&quot; era as his only regret as a member of Mötley Crüe, as the band erased much of what he recorded in the studio and hired session guitarists instead. Mars also claims that he had little involvement in 2000&#x27;s &quot;New Tattoo&quot;, saying &quot;I didn&#x27;t write any of those songs, since I wasn&#x27;t invited. I think I got one lick on that album.&quot; Sixx has denied this claim, saying that &quot;This is during the period that [Mars] had disintegrated into opiate addiction.&quot;

On 2008’s &quot;Saints of Los Angeles&quot;, guitarist DJ Ashba recorded the vast majority of the guitar parts, though his work was uncredited. Sixx has said that the band had no choice, claiming that &quot;Mick was struggling to play his parts.&quot;

Mötley Crüe reunited in 2018 and started touring again in 2022. However, several years away from the band had convinced Mars that he never wanted to tour again. He made it clear to his bandmates that he was open to recording again but could not handle another world tour, as he could no longer move his head from side to side and was permanently hunched over.

Mars says he has never had a close offstage relationship with any of his Mötley Crüe bandmates. &quot;(Sixx) has only ever visited me two or three times at the most,&quot; he says. &quot;Tommy came over once, and Vince just came over once, even though he lived just around the corner from me in Venice Beach. It&#x27;s just the way we worked,&quot; he says.

=== Retirement and lawsuit against Mötley Crue ===
On October 26, 2022, Mars announced his retirement from touring with Mötley Crüe. The next day, the band confirmed that John 5 had taken his place. That same week, they announced Mars&#x27; complete retirement from the band, supporting his decision, with John 5 taking his place starting with the 2023&#x27;s The World Tour with Def Leppard.

On April 6, 2023, Mars sued the band, alleging that the group were trying to &quot;unilaterally&quot; get Mars removed from the lineup. Later that day, the band released a statement stating that, whilst Mars hadn&#x27;t been fired, he isn&#x27;t touring with the group. Mars would state:

Mars refused to sign a severance agreement that would divest him of those and other future interests, in return for a five percent stake in the group&#x27;s 2023 tour, which is going on without him.

=== Solo career ===
In February 2023, amidst the controversies surrounding the band lawsuit, Mars began work on a solo album again, titled &quot;The Other Side of Mars&quot;, produced in Los Angeles. Cory Marks has described the album, saying:
Mars stated that plans surrounding a solo album had previously been discussed since 2014. &quot;The Other Side of Mars&quot; was released on February 23, 2024.

The first single from the album, &quot;Loyal to the Lie&quot;, was released on October 31, 2023.

== Personal life ==
=== Family ===
With his girlfriend and later wife Sharon, Mars has a son (Les Paul) and a daughter (Stormy), both born in the 1970s. Sharon would later walk out on him with the children after a workplace accident left him unable to provide for the family or play guitar. He fathered a third child, Erik, with a woman named Marcia Lea Martell (nee Tucker), while playing in the band White Horse. At one point, with three children and little success as a musician, Mars&#x27; well-being suffered. &quot;He was a real sad guy,&quot; said ex-White Horse drummer Jack Valentine. &quot;Looking into his eyes, I just saw this world of sorrow. He had such a hard life.&quot; Later he was married to Emi Canyn from 1990 to 1994. His current wife since 2013 is former model Seraina Schönenberger. Mars says he&#x27;s been financially destitute three times in his life. &quot;One was before (Mötley Crüe) formed. Two was the first wife, and three was the second wife. They drained my bank accounts. I lost my house. I lost cars. I lost guitars. I lost everything,&quot; he remembers.

In 1989 Martell filed a &quot;Complaint For Breach of Oral Agreement, Injunctive Relief, and Negligent and Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress&quot; against Mars, claiming that he intentionally and maliciously neglected their son&#x27;s emotional needs due to his refusal to meet or communicate with the boy despite their son&#x27;s desires.

Mars has nine grandchildren and at least one great-grandchild, though he doesn&#x27;t know the exact number.

Mars currently resides in Nashville, Tennessee with Schönenberger. He has a relationship with his son, Les Paul, but is estranged from his other children.

=== Health ===
For all of his professional career, Mars has struggled with ankylosing spondylitis, a chronic, inflammatory form of arthritis that mainly affects the spine and pelvis. He says the pain began when he was 14 years old, with sharp pain at the top of his tailbone. He did not get a proper diagnosis until he was 27, and the condition has caused him a great deal of pain and increasingly impaired his movement throughout his life. He has said that although the condition can be quite painful, he is grateful that ankylosing spondylitis rarely affects the hands and feet; &quot;That meant I could play guitar, and that&#x27;s what mattered most.&quot; Mars said in Mötley Crüe&#x27;s 2001 autobiography, &quot;The Dirt&quot;:

By late 2001, the excruciating pain caused by ankylosing spondylitis led to addiction issues with Oxycontin, Vicodin, and Lortab. He was also drinking heavily and taking as many as 45 Advil a day. Mars rarely left his home or even went outside during this period. &quot;I used to see giant reptile aliens at the end of my bed,&quot; he says. Sixx claims that Mars eventually moved into his house and that he &quot;actually had to spoon-feed [Mars] since he was so fucked up.&quot;

Over the years, the illness has caused his lower spine to seize up and freeze completely solid, &quot;... causing scoliosis in [his] back and squashing [him] further down and forward until [he] was a full shorter than [he] was in high school.&quot; Mars reported in 2013 that his neck is so stiff he could not even turn his head, preventing him from driving a car. The condition led to hip-replacement surgery at the end of 2004. In spite of the pain, Mars refuses to use a cane or a wheelchair, saying &quot;If I can&#x27;t get up there myself, I&#x27;m not doing it.&quot;

== Influences ==
Mainly influenced by the Blues rock music of the 1960s, he has pointed out the likes of Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix as influences:
Mars also claims that the albums: &quot;&quot; (1967), &quot;Truth&quot; (1968), &quot;Having a Rave Up with the Yardbirds&quot; (1965), &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot; (1967), &quot;Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs&quot; (1970), &quot;Bad Company&quot; (1974), &quot;Band of Gypsys&quot; (1970), &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot; (1969), and various songs by Mike Bloomfield helped &quot;change his life&quot;. Former Mötley Crüe vocalist John Corabi has said that Mars was a big fan of Leslie West and Jeff Beck; &quot;To Mick, it was about kicking you in the chest and having this ungodly sound.&quot;

== Other works ==
Mars has contributed songwriting to John LeCompt, a former member of Evanescence and the other band members of Machina, and to the Swedish band Crashdïet. Their second album, &quot;The Unattractive Revolution&quot;, was released on October 3, 2007, and featured two songs co-written by Mars.

Mars played guitar on the title track of Hinder&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;Take It to the Limit&quot;, and contributed a guitar solo to the song &quot;Into the Light&quot; by Papa Roach, on their 2009 album &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;. Mars also contributed a guitar solo to the song &quot;The Question&quot; on Rock Star: Supernova runner-up Dilana&#x27;s U.S. debut album &quot;Inside Out&quot;. In 2010 he co-wrote a song with Escape the Fate for the band&#x27;s self-titled album, which was instead withheld from the album and reserved for a later release. Mars co-wrote and appears in the music video of the song &quot;Boss&#x27;s Daughter&quot; by Pop Evil on their 2011 album &quot;War of Angels&quot;.

In November 2019, Mars released a new song, &quot;The Way I&#x27;m Wired&quot;, with Black Smoke Trigger. Mars was also featured on the hit single &quot;Outlaws &amp; Outsiders&quot; by Cory Marks. In 2024, Mars was featured on another Cory Marks single titled &quot;(Make My) Country Rock&quot;.

== Equipment ==
Mars in his early career used guitars that were popular at the time: Kramer, and other Superstrats; on occasion he used a black Gibson Les Paul, and sometimes a B.C. Rich. However, according to an interview published in September 2009, Mars&#x27; main stage guitars for that tour were Fender Stratocasters with an &quot;HSH&quot; (humbucker, single coil, humbucker) configuration. He frequently used a Stratocaster modified from components of 1963, 1964, and 1965 models with J.M. Rolph pickups and a licensed Floyd Rose bridge system turning it into a Superstrat.

<text>Ernest Percival Rhys ( ; 17 July 1859 – 25 May 1946) was a Welsh-English writer, best known for his role as founding editor of the Everyman&#x27;s Library series of affordable classics. He wrote essays, stories, poetry, novels and plays.

==Early life==
Rhys was born in Islington in north London, the son of John Rees (his spelling) and his English wife Emma Percival of Hockerill. Shortly afterwards his father set up in the wine and spirits trade, working for Walter Gilbey in premises in Nott Square, Carmarthen, where before marriage he had been in training for the ministry. The family was in Carmarthen for a number of years, and had a Welsh-speaking maid. In 1865 John Rees was transferred to another Gilbey shop, in Newcastle upon Tyne.

After home education with a governess, Rhys spent two years at Bishop&#x27;s Stortford Grammar School as a boarder, leaving in poor health. He then attended a Newcastle school run by a German master, acquiring some German and French. He then spent a desultory period working in his father&#x27;s office. In 1876 he took up an apprenticeship as a mining engineer, or &quot;coal viewer&quot;. Against the wishes of his father, Rhys did not apply to the University of Oxford.

Rhys worked through his apprenticeship in the Durham coalfield. He passed his mining engineer examination. At this period he lived in a pit village in Lower Weardale, and wrote extensively, poetry and prose, without being published. He set up a library, a book group and a programme of lectures. He described the miners&#x27; life in his story collection &quot;Black Horse Pit&quot; (1925).

On his own account, Rhys owed his first literary commission, and his interest in poetry, to Joseph Skipsey, whom he knew in Newcastle in the early 1880s. He was employed by the Walter Scott Publishing Co. of Newcastle. Initially he edited the works of George Herbert for its Canterbury Poets series. After that he was employed doing editorial work on its Camelot Series, of reprints and translations. Rhys later wrote that the approach was based on the mistaken idea that he was the academic John Rhys.

==Early associations==
Rhys had connections to the Fabian Society, and the Socialist League led by William Morris, though he did not join the League. He was a friend of Percival Chubb (1860–1960), eventually President of the American Ethical Union. In his early life, Chubb was a disciple of Thomas Davidson, founder of the Fellowship of the New Life, and indirectly of the Fabian Society. Chubb with Rhys at the start of the 1880s mixed in these circles, and also with the Social Democratic Federation. Rhys kept up during the decade with socialists such as Edward Carpenter.

Rhys was one of a number of British socialists who visited Walt Whitman; it followed a postal introduction in 1885 by William Michael Rossetti.

==In London==
Turning to writing in London as a profession from 1886, Rhys built up a steady reputation as a reviewer for periodicals. The American journey on which the meeting with Walt Whitman occurred is described in &quot;Everyman Remembers&quot;, Rhys&#x27;s autobiography. It was also the occasion of his encounter with Edmund Clarence Stedman in New York, and dates to 1887/8. He and Stedman became correspondents. In 1890, he was sharing rooms in Hampstead with Arthur Symons.

Rhys married his wife Grace in 1891. She began to write herself after the marriage, which produced five children. Initially they lived in a cottage on Moel y Gamelin near Llangollen, but it proved impractical for the literary life, and they returned to London. Their first home there was in the Vale of Health area of Hampstead, having according to Rhys a literary association with Leigh Hunt, who moved to the unsalubrious Vale in 1816. They moved on from &quot;Hunt Cottage&quot;, but within Hampstead so-called, to a house in Hermitage Lane, now Childs Hill, which they named &quot;Derwen&quot;. The Rhyses there held a form of literary &quot;salon&quot;.
In 1906, Rhys persuaded J. M. Dent the publisher to start out on the ambitious &quot;Everyman&#x27;s Library&quot; project. When Rhys died in London on 25 May 1946, 983 &quot;Everyman&quot; titles had been produced.

==London associations==
In 1887 Rhys met W. B. Yeats at a Sunday political gathering called by Morris; he later introduced Yeats to the duo Michael Field. It was at a garden party held by Yeats that Rhys first met Grace Little, his future wife.

In February 1890 Rhys was a founder member of the Rhymers&#x27; Club in London. In June of that year he met the poet John Davidson at a Sunday gathering in Hampstead held by William Sharp. Davidson became a recruit to the Rhymers&#x27; Club. In its early form, the club was for &quot;Celtic&quot; poets. That restriction changed in January 1891, with a meeting at the base of the Century Guild of Artists in Fitzroy Street. Rhys also attended Yeats&#x27;s evenings in the Woburn Buildings, St. Pancras, meeting there Maud Gonne and the young Rupert Brooke.

Chapter XIX of &quot;Everyman Remembers&quot; describes an occasion at Rhys&#x27;s home attended by Yeats, Davidson, Ezra Pound, Ford Madox Hueffer and D. H. Lawrence. It has been argued that this gathering, dated to 1909, must be a conflation of events, since chronology makes it implausible that Davidson and Lawrence were both there. That year, Rhys and Ernest Radford were 1890s figures invited to the founding meeting of the poets&#x27; club set up by F. S. Flint and T. E. Hulme.

The Rhyses also knew Arthur Waugh and his family, who included the authors Alec Waugh and Evelyn Waugh; Grace became a close friend of Arthur&#x27;s wife Catherine. They had settled at Hillfield Road in West Hampstead, having earlier lived off the Finchley Road. Alec Waugh was Ernest Rhys&#x27;s first biographer in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;. Evelyn Waugh, on the other hand, came to dislike the Rhys style of family and literary entertainment, by 1920.

<doc id="1029255" wikidata="Q333285" url="?curid=1029255" title="James Harris (grammarian)">
<text>James Harris, FRS (24 July 1709 – 22 December 1780) was an English politician and grammarian. He was the author of &quot;Hermes, a philosophical inquiry concerning universal grammar&quot; (1751).

==Life==
James Harris was born at Salisbury, Wiltshire, the son of James Harris (1674–1731) by his second marriage to Elizabeth (c. 1682–1744), daughter of Anthony Ashley Cooper, 2nd Earl of Shaftesbury. He was educated at the Salisbury Cathedral School, and Wadham College, Oxford. On leaving university he was entered at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn as a student of law, though he was not intended for the Bar. The death of his father in 1733 brought him an independent fortune and Malmesbury House in Salisbury&#x27;s Cathedral Close.

Harris became a county magistrate. He was Member of Parliament for Christchurch from 1761 until his death, and Comptroller to the Queen from 1774 to 1780. He held political office under George Grenville: in January 1763 he became a lord of the admiralty, and in April that year a lord of the treasury. He retired from his post with Grenville in 1765.

Harris was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1763. He died at Malmesbury House on 22 December 1780, and was buried on 28 December in Salisbury Cathedral, where there is a memorial to him in the north transept.

==Associations==
Harris was a lover of music and a friend of Handel. He directed concerts and music festivals at Salisbury for nearly fifty years. He adapted the words for a selection from Italian and German composers (subsequently published by the cathedral organist Joseph Corfe). He wrote a number of pastorals. One of them, &quot;Damon and Amaryllis&quot; was produced by David Garrick at Drury Lane, as debut piece for the singer Thomas Norris. Norris was originally a Salisbury chorister, and a protégé of Harris. In 1741 John Robartes, 4th Earl of Radnor gave him the collection of Handel&#x27;s music made by Elizabeth Legh (1694–1734).
One correspondent of Harris was Lord Monboddo, who disclosed in a 1772 letter to him some early evolutionary thought. Samuel Johnson found Harris uncongenial, saying he was &quot;a sound, solid scholar,&quot; but &quot;a prig&quot; and &quot;a coxcomb&quot; who &quot;did not understand his own system&quot; in Harris&#x27;s work &quot;Hermes&quot;.

The music historian Charles Burney, on the other hand, esteemed him as a writer on music. Harris, his wife and daughter attended a high-powered domestic concert at Burney&#x27;s house in May 1775, of which a vivid description by the 22-year-old Frances (Fanny) Burney survives: &quot;I had the satisfaction to sit next to Mr. Harris, who is very chearful &quot;[sic]&quot; and communicative, and his conversation instructive and agreeable.&quot; His daughter Louisa (&quot;a modest, reserved, and sensible girl&quot;) was asked to sing, and Harris accompanied her.

==Works==
Interested in the Greek and Latin classics, Harris sought out manuscripts and printed editions that influenced his writings, as did the works of the 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury, his uncle. Harris published in 1744 &quot;Three Treatises — on art; on music, painting and poetry; and on happiness&quot;. In 1751 appeared the work by which he became best known, &quot;Hermes, a philosophical inquiry concerning universal grammar&quot;. In the direction of prescriptive grammar, it influenced Robert Lowth&#x27;s English grammar of 1762.

Harris also published &quot;Philosophical Arrangements&quot; and &quot;Philological Inquiries&quot;. His works were collected and published in 1801, by his son James who prefixed a brief biography.

Hampshire Record Office holds Harris&#x27;s papers. Letters from his wife Elizabeth are also extant.

<doc id="1029261" wikidata="Q960718" url="?curid=1029261" title="Spectral band replication">
<text>Spectral band replication (SBR) is a technology to enhance audio or speech codecs, especially at low bit rates and is based on harmonic redundancy in the frequency domain.

It can be combined with any audio compression codec: the codec itself transmits the lower and midfrequencies of the spectrum, while SBR replicates higher frequency content by transposing up harmonics from the lower and midfrequencies at the decoder. Some guidance information for reconstruction of the high-frequency spectral envelope is transmitted as side information.

When needed, it also reconstructs or adaptively mixes in noise-like information in selected frequency bands in order to faithfully replicate signals that originally contained no or fewer tonal components.

The SBR idea is based on the principle that the psychoacoustic part of the human brain tends to analyse higher frequencies with less accuracy; thus harmonic phenomena associated with the spectral band replication process needs only be accurate in a perceptual sense and not technically or mathematically exact.

== History and use ==
A Swedish company Coding Technologies (acquired by Dolby in 2007) developed and pioneered the use of SBR in its MPEG-2 AAC-derived codec called aacPlus, which first appeared in 2001. This codec was submitted to MPEG and formed the basis of MPEG-4 High-Efficiency AAC (HE-AAC), standardized in 2003. Lars Liljeryd, Kristofer Kjörling, and Martin Dietz received the IEEE Masaru Ibuka Consumer Electronics Award in 2013 for their work developing and marketing HE-AAC. Coding Technologies&#x27; SBR method has also been used with WMA 10 Professional to create WMA 10 Pro LBR, and with MP3 to create mp3PRO.

HE-AAC which uses SBR is used in broadcast systems like DAB+, Digital Radio Mondiale (including xHE-AAC), HD Radio, and XM Satellite Radio.

If the player is not capable of using the side information that has been transmitted alongside the &quot;normal&quot; compressed audio data, it may still be able to play the &quot;baseband&quot; data (e.g. sampled at 22.05 kHz instead of 44.1 kHz) as usual, resulting in a dull (since the high frequencies are missing), but otherwise mostly acceptable sound. This is, for example, the case if an mp3PRO file is played back with MP3 software incapable of utilizing the SBR information.

Opus&#x27;s CELT part performs &quot;spectral folding&quot; on the MDCT bin level, making it a far less advanced but lower-delay technique compared to SBR.

Dolby Digital Plus (E-AC3) performs &quot;Spectral Extension&quot; (SPX). SPX reduces high-frequency components to metadata and is similar to E-AC3 multichannel coupling calculation. Dolby AC-4 expands the technique to Advanced Spectral Extension (A-SPX), with the option of interleaving with regular, non-extended data in time or frequency domain. As a result, SPX can be selective disabled for difficult portions.

== Methods ==
Encoding of SBR produces a downsampled (usually 2:1) audio signal and guidance information. In an early publication, the guiding data is described as being produced by quadrature mirror filter (QMF) analysis and an envelope estimator.

Decoding of SBR requires transposing harmonics, a case of audio time stretching and pitch scaling.
* A traditional approach starts with small intervals of discrete fourier transform (DFT), phase adjustments, IDFT, and ends with overlap-add. This method is sensitive to transient signals which can cause echos, requiring some padding (50% in USAC) in the DFT.
* A newer approach is the QMF. One single filter bank can perform a whole time-stretch and pitch-scale operation for lower computational complexity.

<doc id="1029262" wikidata="Q2162060" url="?curid=1029262" title="The Man in the White Suit">
<text>The Man in the White Suit is a 1951 British satirical science fiction comedy film made by Ealing Studios. It stars Alec Guinness, Joan Greenwood and Cecil Parker and was directed by Alexander Mackendrick. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Writing (Screenplay) for Roger MacDougall, John Dighton and Alexander Mackendrick.

It followed a common Ealing Studios theme of the &quot;common man&quot; against the Establishment. In this instance the hero falls foul of both trade unions and the wealthy mill owners who attempt to suppress his invention.

Mandy Miller (aged only 6) made her first film appearance in this film.

==Plot==
Sidney Stratton, a brilliant young research chemist and former Cambridge scholarship recipient, has been dismissed from jobs at several textile mills in the north of England because of his demands for expensive facilities and his obsession with inventing an everlasting fibre. While working as a labourer at the Birnley Mills, he accidentally becomes an unpaid researcher and invents an incredibly strong fibre which repels dirt and never wears out. From this fabric, a suit is made—which is brilliant white because it cannot absorb dye and slightly luminous because it includes radioactive elements.

Stratton is lauded as a genius until both management and the trade unions realise the consequence of his invention; once consumers have purchased enough cloth, demand will drop precipitously and put the textile industry out of business. The managers try to trick and bribe Stratton into signing away the rights to his invention but he refuses. Managers and workers each try to shut him away, but he escapes.

The bosses negotiate with Daphne, the daughter of the owner of Birnley Mills, that she will trick Stratton into giving it all up and she asks £5000 for this, but when she meets Stratton she has a change of heart and encourages him to announce his invention to the press. Going back to his rooms he is confronted by a woman who he thought was on his side, but suddenly realises that no-one wants his invention.

The climax sees Stratton running through the streets at night in his glowing white suit, pursued by both the managers and the employees. As the crowd advances, his suit begins to fall apart as the chemical structure of the fibre breaks down with time. The mob, realising the flaw in the process, rip pieces off his suit in triumph, until he is left standing in his shirt and underwear. Only Daphne Birnley, the mill-owner&#x27;s daughter, and Bertha, a works labourer, have sympathy for his disappointment.

The next day, Stratton is dismissed from his job. Departing, he consults his chemistry notes. A realisation hits and he exclaims, &quot;I see!&quot; With that he strides off, perhaps to try again elsewhere.

== Sound ==
The gurgling musical theme, &quot;Guggle Glub Gurgle&quot;, that plays when Sidney Stratton&#x27;s apparatus is bubbling was created by sampling laboratory equipment. Jack Parnell sampled the motif and incorporated it into his &quot;White Suit Samba&quot;.

==Reception==
The film opened at the Odeon Marble Arch cinema in London on 10 August 1951, and was one of the most popular films of the year in Britain. It earned rentals of $460,000 in the United States and Canada. (This figure was also given as $500,000.)

Harve Bennett cited the film as helpful in writing &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot;. The Genesis device crippled the storytelling ability of the franchise because it was too powerful. He remembered the lesson of &quot;The Man in the White Suit&quot; as &quot;for every great advance, you pay a price&quot;, which enabled him to figure out a scenario for the film.

The British Film Institute named it the 58th greatest British film of all time. In 2014 &quot;The Guardian&quot; included it as one of the twenty best British science fiction films.

== Stage adaptation ==
A stage play based on the film directed by Sean Foley and starring Stephen Mangan and Kara Tointon opened at the Theatre Royal, Bath in September 2019 before transferring to the Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre in London&#x27;s West End.

<text>In October 2006, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) adopted a nationwide alert system for characterizing the level of unrest and eruptive activity at volcanoes. The system is now used by the Alaska Volcano Observatory, the California Volcano Observatory (California and Nevada), the Cascades Volcano Observatory (Washington, Oregon and Idaho), the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory and the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory (Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico and Arizona).

Under this system, the USGS ranks the level of activity at a U.S. volcano using the terms &quot;normal&quot;, for typical volcanic activity in a non-eruptive phase; &quot;advisory&quot;, for elevated unrest; &quot;watch&quot;, for escalating unrest or an eruption underway that poses limited hazards; and, &quot;warning&quot;, if a highly hazardous eruption is underway or imminent. These levels reflect conditions at a volcano and the expected or ongoing hazardous volcanic phenomena. When an alert level is assigned by an observatory, accompanying text will give a fuller explanation of the observed phenomena and clarify hazard implications to affected groups.
== Summary of Volcanic Activity Alert Notification System ==

== Aviation color codes ==
== Earlier volcano warning schemes for the United States ==
Prior to October 2006, three parallel Volcano warning schemes were used by the United States Geological Survey and the volcano observatories for different volcano ranges in the United States. They each have a base level for dormant-quiescent states and three grades of alert.

===Color Code Conditions, Long Valley Caldera and Mono-Inyo Craters Region, California===
Developed in 1997 to replace a previous 5-level system devised in 1991.

===Level of Concern Color Codes for volcanoes in Alaska===

The Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) used the following color-coded system to rate volcanic activity. It was originally established during the 1989-90 eruption of Redoubt Volcano.

All five classifications are spelled as proper nouns, i.e., Level of Concern Color Code Orange not Level of concern color code Orange or any other variation. On its website the AVO spells the alert color in all capitals, but this is not otherwise necessary outside their system.

===Warning system for Cascade Range volcanoes in Washington and Oregon===
Introduced following the May 18, 1980, eruption of Mount St. Helens.

<text>New Brighton is a coastal suburb of Christchurch, New Zealand, east of the city centre. It is one of eastern Christchurch&#x27;s main entertainment and tourist centres, with its architecturally unique pier and scenic coastline. The 2011 Christchurch earthquakes caused significant damage in the area.

==History==

=== Māori connections ===
New Brighton is of cultural significance for the local iwi or tribe Ngāi Tahu who are the kaitiaki (guardians) of this takiwā (or area). Ngāi Tūāhuriri hapū, a sub-tribe of Ngāi Tahu, hold mana whenua status (territorial rights) in respect to this area. Te Tai o Mahaanui refers to the coast and surrounding land of which New Brighton is a part.

=== Naming ===

The naming of New Brighton was apparently done on the &#x27;spur of the moment&#x27; by William Fee, an early settler of the area. When Guise Brittan, the Waste Lands Commissioner, visited the area in December 1860, he was recognised and Fee chalked &#x27;New Brighton&#x27; on a wooden plank, supposedly in reference to his fellow settler Stephen Brooker, who had come from New Brighton in England. The suburb is frequently referred to simply as Brighton, occasionally leading to confusion with Brighton near Dunedin.

=== Early settlement ===
Māori people were the first settlers in Canterbury and arrived around the 13th century according to western archaeological evidence, though Māori whakapapa (genealogies) date settlement before this period of time with the discovery of the South Island by Waitaha ancestor, Rākaihautū. Traditional food gathering or mahinga kai sites of Waitaha, Rapuwai, Kāti Mamoe and subsequently Ngāi Tahu iwi included Ihutai (Avon Heathcote Estuary) nearby to New Brighton. Walking trails between Ngāi Tahu settlements (kāika) passed close to New Brighton&#x27;s present day commercial centre. A sand dune track called Pohoareare ran around Ihutai between Ōpāwaho kāika (settlement) on the Heathcote River and South New Brighton, a popular iwi destination for swimming and catching horihori (sole).

The first English settler&#x27;s home in the area was built in 1858 by Walker. From 1860 on, increasingly more settlers started to be interested in New Brighton. The first settlers built their houses from mānuka scrub and clay. These cob and sod houses were quite simple with one big room which was partitioned later, weatherboards on the outside walls, beaten clay floor and an oil drum for cooking purposes. Beside the lack of infrastructure, the first settlers had to deal with the nature of the area which consisted of sand dunes with nearly no vegetation. Strong winds could deposit a foot of sand on the first improvised New Brighton roads. Shifting sand was managed by vegetation planting. After a lot of trial and error during which many grass types were planted, it was decided that lupins and marram-grass were the best for stabilising the sand dunes. By 1899, officials had planted a ton of marram-grass.

One of the first businessmen who saw potential in New Brighton was English settler Joseph Harrop Hopkins. On 7 November 1872, Hopkins purchased 150 acres for £300. Within two years, Hopkins built a boarding house and a hotel. After approval from the Licensing Authority on 28 April 1874, the hotel was named &quot;New Brighton&quot;. In order to attract new visitors to the area and provide a comfortable and attractive mode of transport, Hopkins purchased an expensive 170-passenger paddle steamer which run daily from central Christchurch (Wards Brewery) to New Brighton. However the steamer didn&#x27;t attract as much attention as desired and Hopkins fell into financial troubles. In 1875, he had to sell the steamer and his land.

Early development of the area was slow. By 1884, according to official records, only 16 houses were present. From 1885, a gradual increase in the number of houses occurred, roads and streets were planned, and the first shops appeared. Development accelerated in the following years. The area used be known simply as the &quot;Beach&quot;, which was part of the Avon River Road Board District. As the development continued, the area became a borough in 1897. By 1901, New Brighton reached 1,008 residents. This number further increased to around 4,000 by 1922.

==Transportation==
Before the first roads were built, it was challenging to get to the area. New Brighton was originally separated from the then outer suburbs of Christchurch by the swampy areas adjoining the Avon River / Ōtākaro. Later on, urban expansion, land reclamation and drainage led to New Brighton being connected to Christchurch city. The first English settlers carried goods to and from New Brighton on a galvanised cart drawn by an ox. Mānuka scrub was frequently used as a ground cover to prevent the cart from being bogged. The first road to New Brighton followed the Avon River / Ōtākaro. In 1874, the poor quality of the roading, due to the moving sands of the area, led to the matter being brought to the urgent attention of the Superintendent of the Canterbury Provincial Council, in order to secure funding to improve the roads. Maintenance and improvement of the area&#x27;s roading was affected by the borough&#x27;s income. From 1897, a water cart was used on dirt roads, and in 1896 gravel began to be laid on some of the roads.

===Early public transport===
In 1861, the first commercial coach service commenced, and from 1872, there were daily coach services from Christchurch which attracted more settlement in the area including boarding houses, baches (holiday homes) and permanent houses.

===Trams===
Trams were first introduced to Christchurch thanks to the Canterbury Tramway Company, which was founded in 1878. The first tram services commenced in central Christchurch in 1880, with the tramway system consisting of several lines and stations. Buoyed by its success, the New Brighton Tramway Company was formed in 1885 with the purpose of providing a tram connection from the eastern end of the central Christchurch tramway network, at Linwood, out to New Brighton. Construction of the line, which followed Pages Road, commenced in 1887 and was completed early the following year, with fare-paying services commencing on 15 February 1888. The service proved to be popular, garnering between 3,000 and 5,000 passengers per week. A second tram route, which became known as the North Beach tramline, was constructed by the City and Suburban Tramway Company, passing through Linwood, Avonside, Shirley, Avondale, Rawhiti, before ending at the New Brighton Pier, was completed in 1894. 

In this era, the trams on both routes were horse-drawn. It was only with the formation of the Christchurch Tramway Board in 1905 and which took over the assets of the local tramway companies, that steam engines were introduced to the New Brighton lines. Electrification of the New Brighton tramway lines was completed in August 1906.

===Trolley buses===

Over time, the North Beach route proved uneconomic, mainly due to the poor state of the track not enabling the trams to compete with the private Inter City Motors&#x27; buses which ran along the same route. The tramline was closed in 1931, with a new electric trolley bus service commencing in its place. The bus company was eventually purchased by the board in 1935, allowing the Board to have a monopoly on that route. 

The fate of the main New Brighton tramway line followed that of the economy. The Great Depression of the 1930s caused a decline in patronage, but increased during World War II due to the restrictions placed on other forms of motorised transport. By the late 1940s, the growth of the Christchurch urban and suburban areas, along with increased rates of car ownership meant that the trams were no longer the best mode for public transport. In a process lasting from 1947 to 1951, the Christchurch Transport Board made a series of decisions to phase out the trams, and replace them with diesel-powered buses.

===Buses===

The transition away from trams proceeded apace in 1951 when the Christchurch Tramway Board ordered 57 diesel buses, with their routes following that of the former tram and trolley bus network. The Christchurch-New Brighton line was closed down on 18 October 1952. The 5 Brighton bus route, following the same route along Pages Road, commenced the same day. The use of buses allowed other routes to be incorporated into public transport network; these included 5A Aldwins Road, 5B Breezes Road, and 5S South Brighton. The 10 Marshland Road and Richmond bus service, which fed into the North Beach route, commenced on 31 May 1956. The 19 North Beach bus service, which followed what had been the North Beach tram, and then trolley bus, route, commenced on 8 November 1956. 

In 1984, two new services, the 30 &amp; 31 Seaside Specials were started to bring people from the southern and northern suburbs, respectively, to New Brighton on Saturdays for shopping. With the introduction of weekend trading, the demand for these services wained, and the buses were discontinued. 

, New Brighton is serviced by the following bus routes, all operated under the Metro brand:

== Christchurch earthquakes aftermath ==

Due in part to the ground on which it was built, the consequences for New Brighton of the 2011 earthquake did not only relate to building damage.

In December 2012, residents held a protest against the perceived slow progress of rebuilding in the area following the region&#x27;s damaging earthquakes, in which 80 people bared their bottoms. Christchurch Mayor Bob Parker said he wasn&#x27;t offended, but the residents were &quot;wrong&quot;. These feelings of neglect by the Christchurch City Council would continue to persist. The People&#x27;s Independent Republic of New Brighton was formed by Paul Zaaman, a New Brighton businesses and landowners association spokesperson, in order to protest a perceived lack of investment by the Christchurch City Council into New Brighton.

New Brighton was named to be the host of the finish of the annual Coast to Coast multisport race in February 2015. The previous finishing point of the race was in Sumner.

Redevelopment of the town centre after the earthquakes based on the New Brighton Centre Master Plan has commenced with He Puna Taimoana hot pools opening, alongside beachside playgound, Marine Parade and streetscape enhancements.

==Location==
The suburb is divided into three sections spread along the southern coast of Pegasus Bay: North New Brighton; New Brighton; and South New Brighton, which lies at the northern end of a narrow peninsula between the bay and the Avon Heathcote Estuary. A pier was built here in the 1990s, and opened on 1 November 1997.

New Brighton was originally a distinct coastal village, separated from the then outer suburbs of Christchurch by the swampy areas adjoining the Avon River. However, urban expansion, land reclamation and drainage have led to New Brighton being connected to Christchurch city.

==Demographics==
New Brighton covers . It had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
New Brighton had a population of 6,099 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 153 people (2.6%) since the 2013 census, and a decrease of 498 people (−7.5%) since the 2006 census. There were 2,544 households, comprising 3,018 males and 3,084 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.98 males per female, with 1,134 people (18.6%) aged under 15 years, 1,143 (18.7%) aged 15 to 29, 2,952 (48.4%) aged 30 to 64, and 876 (14.4%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 88.7% European/Pākehā, 14.2% Māori, 4.0% Pasifika, 3.4% Asian, and 2.5% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 18.5, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 59.7% had no religion, 27.1% were Christian, 0.6% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.4% were Hindu, 0.3% were Muslim, 0.5% were Buddhist and 3.3% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 846 (17.0%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 1,065 (21.5%) people had no formal qualifications. 567 people (11.4%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 2,454 (49.4%) people were employed full-time, 708 (14.3%) were part-time, and 234 (4.7%) were unemployed.

==Economy==

For several decades, New Brighton had the distinction of being the only place in Christchurch where general retail shops were permitted to open on Saturdays (remaining closed on Mondays), and the business district thrived as a result. With the introduction of nationwide Saturday trading in 1980, and then seven-day trading in 1990, retail activity declined significantly.

The 2011 Christchurch earthquake compounded New Brighton&#x27;s struggle for economic wellbeing creating vacant derelict sites in its main retail centre. As part of the New Brighton Regeneration Project, the Beachside Playground has been upgraded and He Puna Taimoana saltwater hot pools built.

Housing projects are planned by a range of developers including Williams Corporation who sold 37 townhouses situated in 180 Marine Parade within 24 hours in March 2022 and The Home Foundation who are building over 60 terraced homes in a development called Te Pakau Maru on Beresford Street. Paradigm Group are planning a mix of ground floor retail with 16 upstairs apartments at the vacant site of 101 Brighton Mall.

== Landmarks ==

=== New Brighton Pier ===

On 18 January 1894, the first New Brighton pier was opened by the Governor of New Zealand, the Earl of Glasgow. In his opening speech, the Earl said:The long timber structure took three years to build and its opening was a significant achievement in promoting New Brighton as a health and recreational resort. Some commentators believe that this potential of New Brighton as a recreational and health resort similar to English New Brighton has not been realised, possibly because of its prevalent harsh winds, poor soils and the somewhat shabby image of the suburb. The pier stood until 1965 when it was demolished as the run down structure wasn&#x27;t deemed safe by the City Council.

A new long concrete pier was constructed and opened on 1 November 1997. In 1999, a library and cafe building was erected at the pier&#x27;s base. The building received awards from New Zealand Institute of Architects. The pier was closed for earthquake repairs in 2016 and reopened again in May 2018. It has become one of the icons of Christchurch.

=== St Faith&#x27;s Anglican church ===

St Faith&#x27;s is an Anglican church located on Hawke street. The original wooden church was built in 1886 and enlarged in 1909. The present church was built between 1924 and 1925. It was constructed using Port Hills’ basalt, a slate roof and Oamaru stone dressings and linings. It was badly damaged in the 2010/11 Christchurch earthquakes. After work to restore and strengthen the church building, it was reopened in May 2022.

=== He Puna Taimoana Hot Pools ===
Developed for $19.2m and opening in April 2020, the hot pools have five outdoor pools for year-round use, as well as a café, sauna and steam room. The name, translated as “coastal pools” or “seaside pools”, reflects the location of the pools and surrounding environment, and was gifted by Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tūāhuririri and Matapopore. In March 2024, the complex welcomed its 500,000th visitor.

==Education==
There were no schools in the New Brighton district up until 1889, the nearest school was located 2 miles away in Burwood. At present time, New Brighton contains no secondary schools. The nearest secondary schools are situated side by side being Shirley Boys&#x27; High School and Avonside Girls&#x27; High School in the suburb of North New Brighton. New Brighton contains three primary schools: 

* New Brighton Catholic School: a state-integrated full primary school for years 1 to 8, established in 1935. 
* Nova Montessori School: a private full primary school for years 1 to 8, established in 1988.
* Rāwhiti School: a state full primary school for years 1 to 8, opened in January 2015 as the result of a merger of Central New Brighton, Freeville, and North New Brighton schools.
The suburb also has a number of kindergarten and childcare facilities, including New Brighton Community Preschool and Nursery.

==Sport and recreation==
Rāwhiti Domain is the main sports field in the suburb, and has facilities for the Rawhiti Golf Club, New Brighton Rugby Football Club, New Brighton Cricket Club, and the New Brighton Olympic Athletic Club. The suburb also has a bowling club, located at the Returned Services&#x27; Association building. 

The New Brighton Surf Bathing and Life Saving Club is the oldest surf life saving club in New Zealand, having been established in July 1910.

<doc id="1029280" wikidata="Q2831239" url="?curid=1029280" title="Albert Henry Baskerville">
<text>Albert (Bert) Henry Baskerville (born as &quot;Baskiville&quot;) (15 January 1883 – 20 May 1908) was a Wellington, New Zealand, postal clerk, a rugby union forward, author of the book &quot;Modern Rugby Football: New Zealand Methods; Points for the Beginner, the Player, the Spectator&quot; and a pioneer of rugby league.

==Rugby football==
His father, Henry William Baskiville, had been killed in an accident on 30 January 1903 when doing some drainage works on Upper Queen Street in Auckland. He and some other workmen were working in a deep excavation when one side of it began to collapse, men called out but his father moved the wrong way and was buried to his neck. He was quickly removed but his injuries were too serious to survive. This left Albert as the main income earner for the family since then and they moved to Wellington shortly afterwards.

Prior to becoming the administrator of the 1907-08 tour, Baskerville played rugby for the Wellington club in 1903 (making two appearances for their senior side) before switching to the Oriental club in 1904 where he played regularly in the backs for the senior side. He was said to be on the verge of provincial selection towards the end of the 1907 season but was not included in the Wellington representative side. He also played for the Post and Telegraph mid-week side in 1904 which won the tournament, beating Cycle and Bearers in the final. In the following year, he represented the Wednesday Players representative side in a match against the Wairarapa Thursday representative side. 

His book, &quot;Modern Rugby Football: New Zealand Methods; Points for the Beginner, the Player, the Spectator&quot;, was published in 1907 and gave him somewhat of a national profile. After the success of this project he moved on to his next ambitious idea, a professional rugby tour of Great Britain. Baskerville competed in many athletic events from 1903 to 1907 as a short and middle distance runner where he would compete for prize money. In late 1905, he filed a patent for a &quot;cuff protector and blotter&quot;.

==The Tour==

Baskerville wrote to the Northern Union and asked if it would host a touring party of New Zealand rugby players. The Northern Union was excited by this proposal and quickly agreed. Baskerville began to work full-time on organising the tour, leaving his job at the Postal Department and severing his connection with the Oriental Football Club. The Wellington Rugby Union moved quickly to attempt to stop him from attending its grounds and he received a life ban from the New Zealand Rugby Union. Despite this he managed to put together an impressive touring party that included eight All Blacks, including four from the 1905 tour of Great Britain. The team was dubbed the All Golds by the Sydney press, a derogatory play on the New Zealand rugby union team&#x27;s nickname the All Blacks.

The tour was a great success both financially (each player earned roughly £300) and on the field, where the touring side won consecutive Test series against Great Britain and Australia. For most of the tour, Baskerville was busy with the administration work and it was not until the final game of the British leg, against St Helens R.F.C., that he played, scoring a try. On arriving in Australia he then played in the first ever trans-Tasman test which was the first match by the Australia national rugby league team, again scoring a try. That was to be the only time that Baskerville represented New Zealand in a Test match. Baskerville contracted pneumonia on the ship taking the touring party from Sydney to Brisbane and, after several days in hospital, died aged 25 in Brisbane on 20 May 1908. His body was taken by the manager, Harry Palmer, and a group of players from each province back to Wellington. The rest of the touring party stayed in Australia to complete the remaining fixtures. Like five other members of the touring party, Baskerville is buried at Karori Cemetery.

==Legacy==
On their return from Australia the remaining members of the tour party held a memorial game, the first game of rugby league in New Zealand, and raised £300 for his widowed mother.

The Courtney Goodwill Trophy, international rugby league&#x27;s first, was presented for the first time in 1936 and depicted Baskiville, along with other pioneering greats of the code, Jean Galia (France), James Lomas (England) and Dally Messenger (Australia).

He is commemorated by the naming of the Baskerville Shield, the trophy awarded when Great Britain and New Zealand meet in test series. In 2001, Baskerville was inducted as one of the NZRL Legends of League.

<doc id="1029281" wikidata="Q268779" url="?curid=1029281" title="Monochrom">
<text>Monochrom (stylised as monochrom) is an international art-technology-philosophy group, publishing house and film production company. It was founded in 1993, and defines itself as &quot;an unpeculiar mixture of proto-aesthetic fringe work, pop attitude, subcultural science and political activism&quot;. Its main office is located at Museumsquartier/Vienna (at &#x27;Q21&#x27;).

The group&#x27;s members are: Johannes Grenzfurthner, Evelyn Fürlinger, Harald Homolka-List, Anika Kronberger, Franz Ablinger, Frank Apunkt Schneider, Daniel Fabry, Günther Friesinger and Roland Gratzer.

The group is known for working with different media and entertainment formats, although many projects are performative and have a strong focus on a critical and educational narrative. Johannes Grenzfurthner calls this &quot;looking for the best weapon of mass distribution of an idea&quot;. Monochrom is openly left-wing and tries to encourage public debate, sometimes using subversive affirmation or &quot;over-affirmation&quot; as a tactic. The group popularized the concept of &quot;context hacking&quot;.

On the occasion of Monochrom&#x27;s 20th birthday in 2013, several Austrian high-profile media outlets paid tribute to the group&#x27;s pioneering contributions within the field of contemporary art and discourse.

== History and philosophy ==

In the early 1990s, Johannes Grenzfurthner was an active member of several BBS message boards. He used his online connections to create a zine or alternative magazine that dealt with art, technology and subversive cultures, and was influenced by US magazines like &quot;Mondo 2000&quot;. Grenzfurthner&#x27;s motivations were to react to the emerging conservatism in cyber-cultures of the early 1990s and to combine his political background in the Austrian punk and antifa movement with discussion of new technologies and the cultures they create. Franz Ablinger joined Grenzfurthner and they became the publication&#x27;s core team.&lt;br&gt;The first issue was released in 1993. Over the years the publication featured many interviews and essays, for example by Bruce Sterling, HR Giger, Richard Kadrey, Arthur Kroker, Negativland, Kathy Acker, Michael Marrak, DJ Spooky, Geert Lovink, Lars Gustafsson, Tony Serra, Friedrich Kittler, Jörg Buttgereit, Eric Drexler, Terry Pratchett, Jack Sargeant and Bob Black, in its specific experimental layout style.

In 1995 the group decided to cover new artistic practices and started experimenting with different media: performances, computer games, robots, puppet theater, musical, short films, pranks, conferences, online activism.

In 1995 we decided that we didn&#x27;t want to constrain ourselves to just one media format (the &quot;fanzine&quot;). We knew that we wanted to create statements, create viral information. So a quest for the best &quot;Weapon of Mass Distribution&quot; started, a search for the best transportation mode for a certain politics of philosophical ideas. This was the Cambrian Explosion of monochrom. We wanted to experiment, try stuff, find new forms of telling our stories. But, to be clear, it was (and still is) not about keeping the pace, of staying up-to-date, or (even worse) staying &quot;fresh&quot;. The emergence of new media (and therefore artistic) formats is certainly interesting. But etching information into copper plates is just as exciting. We think that the perpetual return of &#x27;the new&#x27;, to cite Walter Benjamin, is nothing to write home about – except perhaps for the slave-drivers in the fashion industry. We&#x27;ve never been interested in the new just in itself, but in the accidental occurrence. In the moment where things don&#x27;t tally, where productive confusion arises.

All the other core team members joined between 1995 and 2006.

Grenzfurthner is the group&#x27;s artistic director. He defines Monochrom&#x27;s artistic and activist approach as &#x27;Context hacking&#x27; or &#x27;Urban Hacking&#x27;.

The group monochrom refers to its working method as &quot;Context Hacking&quot;, thus referencing the hacker culture, which propagates a creative and emancipatory approach to the technologies of the digital age, and in this way turns against the continuation into the digital age of centuries-old technological enslavement perpetrated through knowledge and hierarchies of experts. ... Context hacking transfers the hackers&#x27; objectives and methods to the network of social relationships in which artistic production occurs, and upon which it is dependent. ... One of context hackers&#x27; central ambitions is to bring the factions of counterculture, which have veered off along widely diverging trajectories, back together again.

== Community and network ==

From its very foundation, the group defined itself as a &quot;movement&quot;, &quot;culture&quot; (referring to Iain M. Banks&#x27;s sci-fi series) and &quot;open field of experimentation&quot;. Monochrom supported and supports various artists, activists, researchers and communities with an online publishing platform, a print publishing service (&quot;edition mono&quot;), and organizes in-person meetings, screenings, radio shows, debate circles, conferences, online platforms. It is fundamental for the group&#x27;s core members to combine artistic and educational endeavors with community work (cf. social practice).

Some collaborations have been rather short-lived (for example the publication of a 1993 fringe science paper by Jakob Segal, projects with the Billboard Liberation Front and Ubermorgen or the administration of Dorkbot Vienna), some have been going for many years and decades (for example with Michael Marrak, Cory Doctorow, Jon Lebkowsky, Fritz Ostermayer, V. Vale, eSeL, Scott Beale/Laughing Squid, Machine Project, Emmanuel Goldstein, Jason Scott, Jonathan Mann, Jasmin Hagendorfer and the &quot;Porn Film Festival Vienna&quot;), Michael Zeltner, Anouk Wipprecht, VSL Lindabrunn).

Monochrom supports initiatives like the &quot;Radius Festival&quot;, &quot;Play:Vienna&quot;, the &quot;Buckminster Fuller Institute Austria&quot;, &quot;RE/Search&quot;, the &quot;Semantic Web Company&quot; and the Vienna hackerspace &quot;Metalab&quot;. For a couple of years, Monochrom ran the DIY project &quot;Hackbus&quot; in cooperation with David &quot;Daddy D&quot; Dempsey (of FM4)

Since 2007, Monochrom is the European correspondent for Boing Boing Video.

=== Art residency ===

Monochrom offers a collaborative art residency in Vienna. Since 2003 the group has invited and created projects with artists, researchers, and activists like Suhrkamp&#x27;s Johannes Ullmaier, pop theorist Stefan Tiron, performance artist Angela Dorrer, DIY blogger (and later: entrepreneur) Bre Pettis, photographer and activist Audrey Penven, digital artist Eddie Codel, sex work activist Maggie Mayhem, glitch artist Phil Stearns, illustrator Josh Ellingson, DIY artist Ryan Finnigan, digital artist Jane Tingley, digital rights activist Jacob Appelbaum, sex tech expert Kyle Machulis, hacker Nick Farr, filmmakers Sophia Cacciola and Michael J. Epstein, writer Jack Sargeant, and others.&lt;br&gt;All former resident artists are considered &quot;ambassadors&quot;.

Johannes Grenzfurthner sees Monochrom as a community and social incubator of critical and subversive thinkers. An example is Bre Pettis of MakerBot Industries, who got inspired to create 3d printers during his art residency with Monochrom in 2007. Pettis wanted to create a robot that could print shot glasses for Monochrom&#x27;s cocktail-robot event Roboexotica and did research about the RepRap project at Metalab. Shot glasses remained a theme throughout the history of MakerBot.

== Main projects (in chronological order) ==
* &quot;Mackerel Fiddlers&quot; (1996-)
** A radical anti-representation/anti-recording music movement that partially refers to Hakim Bey&#x27;s Temporary Autonomous Zone. To quote the manifesto: &quot;We set value on developing a form of viral resistance by systematic infiltration of symphonic orchestras. A New Year&#x27;s Concert of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra (1984) could have been transformed by at least one Mackerel Fiddler and Austria&#x27;s image would have been ruined worldwide. ... These days, self-production and &#x27;embarrassment sells&#x27; have become the golden rules of media, be it radio, TV, or telegraph. Thus it is not only legitimate to be ashamed of ones activity as a Mackerel Fiddler, it is also thankworthy. Failure is beautiful! Disgrace is sunshine!&quot;
* &quot;Schubumkehr&quot; (1995–1996)
** A manifesto propagating &#x27;internet demarketing&#x27; and deals with negative aspects of early net culture. Paz Sastre reprinted and contextualized the manifesto in this 2021 publication &quot;Manifiestos sobre el arte y la red 1990-1999&quot;, published by &quot;Exit Media&quot;.
* &quot;Der Exot&quot; (1997–2012) 
** A telerobot remotely controlled via a web interface/chat forum. The robot was supported and operated by a big community. The robot&#x27;s basic structure was built out of remodeled Lego bricks and equipped with a Fisheye lens camera. The project was the first telerobot/tele-community projects of its kind. It was presented at art festivals and technology presentations.
** Monochrom relaunched the project in 2011, calling it a &quot;resurrection&quot;, and specifying the social aspect of the project: &quot;A mobile robot with a mounted camera that can be controlled via web interface. But that&#x27;s tricky. If too many people try to control the robot at the same time it is counter-productive. ... Der Exot is the anti-crowd source robot. The users have to discuss and cooperate via a chat interface to communicate where they want to go, what corners they want to explore, what to crush.&quot; The project was presented at the &#x27;Robotville&#x27; Exhibition of the Science Museum London.
* &quot;Wir kaufen Seelen&quot; (&quot;We Buy Souls&quot;) (1998)
** A &quot;spirituo-capitalist&quot; booth where project members tried to buy the souls of passers-by for US$5 per soul. A total of fifteen were purchased and registered. These souls are still being offered for sale to third parties with a power of disposal.
* &quot;Roboexotica&quot; (1999-) 
** An annual festival where scientists, researchers, computer geeks and artists from all over the world build cocktail robots and discuss technological innovation, futurology and science fiction. &quot;Roboexotica&quot; is also an ironic attempt to criticize techno-triumphalism and to dissect technological hypes. 2002 Monochrom teamed up with Shifz in the organization of the events. &quot;Roboexotica&quot; has been featured on Slashdot, Wired News, Reuters, &quot;New York Times&quot; and blogs like Boing Boing and New Scientist.
* &quot;Minus 24x&quot; (2001)
** Monochrom&#x27;s pro-failure/pro-error/pro-inability manifesto, hailing the &quot;Luddites of inability&quot;. Quote: &quot;Turning an object against the use inscribed in it (as sociolect of the world of things) means probing its possibilities. ... The information age is an age of permanently getting stuck. Greater and greater speed is demanded. New software, new hardware, new structures, new cultural techniques. Lifelong learning? Yes. But the company can&#x27;t fire the secretary every six months, just because she can&#x27;t cope with the new version of Excel. They can count their keystrokes, measure their productivity ... but! They will never be able to sanction their inability! Because that is imminent.&quot;
* &quot;Scrotum gegen votum&quot; (&quot;Scrotum for a vote&quot;) (2000-)
** &quot;A form of political commentary for &quot;about fifty percent of the population&quot;. Masculine individuals (whether in sex or gender) are seated nude in a special chair attached to a flatbed scanner. The scans then may or may not be sent to various politicians. The project won the NEBAPOMIC 2000 (Network-based Political Minimalism Counteraction Award) in the category of small country with political tendencies towards the conservative right.
* &quot;Soviet Unterzoegersdorf&quot; (1999-) 
** In 2005 Monochrom presented the first part of a computer game trilogy: &quot;Soviet Unterzoegersdorf - The Adventure Game&quot; (using AGS). To Monochrom it was clear that the adventure game, an almost extinct form of computer game, would provide the perfect media platform to communicate the idea of &quot;Soviet Unterzoegersdorf&quot;. Edge chose the game as their &#x27;internet game of the month&#x27; of November 2005.
** In 2011 Monochrom and Austrian production company Golden Girls Filmproduktion announced that they are working on the feature film Sierra Zulu. The movie will be dealing with Soviet Unterzoegersdorf. In 2012 Monochrom presented the 16-minute short film &quot;Earthmoving&quot;. It is a prequel to the feature film Sierra Zulu and features actors Jeff Ricketts, Martin Auer, Lynsey Thurgar, Adrienne Ferguson and Alexander Fennon.
** In March 2009 Monochrom presented &#x27;Soviet Unterzoegersdorf: Sector II&#x27;. The game features special guest appearances of Cory Doctorow, Bruce Sterling, Jello Biafra, Jason Scott, Bre Pettis and MC Frontalot.
** The fake history of the &quot;last existing appanage republic of the USSR&quot;, Soviet Unterzoegersdorf. Created to discuss topics such as the theoretical problems of historiography, the concept of the &quot;socialist utopia&quot; and the political struggles of postwar Europe. The theoretical concept was transformed into an improvisational theatre/performance/LARP that lasted two days.
* &quot;Georg Paul Thomann&quot; (2002–2005) 
** Monochrom was chosen to represent the Republic of Austria at the São Paulo Art Biennial, São Paulo (Brazil) in 2002. However, the political climate in Austria (at that time, the center-right People&#x27;s Party had recently formed a coalition with Jörg Haider&#x27;s radical-right Austrian Freedom Party) gave the left-wing art group concerns about acting as wholehearted representatives of their nation. Monochrom dealt with the conundrum by creating the persona of Georg P. Thomann, an irascible, controversial (and completely fictitious) artist of longstanding fame and renown. Through the implementation of this ironic mechanism - even the catalogue included the biography of the non-existent artist - the group solved with pure fiction the philosophical and bureaucratic dilemma attached to the system of representation presented to them by the Biennial.
** An interesting story related to the Thomann project took place once the São Paulo Art Biennial was underway. The artist Chien-Chi Chang was invited as the representative of Taiwan, but the country&#x27;s name was removed by the administration from his cube overnight and replaced by the label, &quot;Museum of Fine Arts, Taipei.&quot; As the members of Monochrom discovered, China had threatened to retreat from the Biennial (and create massive diplomatic problems) if the organizers of the Biennial were thought to be challenging the &quot;One-China policy.&quot; Chang&#x27;s open letter remained unanswered. Under the guise of Thomann, Monochrom invited artists from several countries to show their solidarity with Chang by taking the adhesive letters from their countries&#x27; name tags and giving them to Chang so that he could remount &quot;Taiwan&quot; outside his room. Monochrom wanted to show that artists do not necessarily have to internalize the fragmentation and isolation imposed by the rat-race of art markets and exhibitions as society-controlling imperatives. Several Asian newspapers reported about the performance. One Taiwanese newspaper headlined: &quot;Austrian artist Georg Paul Thomann saves &#x27;Taiwan&#x27;&quot;.
** In 2005 Monochrom released press info that &quot;Austrian artist and writer Prof. Georg Paul Thomann died in a tragic accident at the tender age of 60&quot;. On 29 July 2005 they staged his funeral in Hall in Tirol. Thomann&#x27;s gravesite remains in Hall. Georg Paul Thomann&#x27;s tombstone shows an engraved URL of the Thomann project page.
** Georg Paul Thomann is featured in RE/Search&#x27;s &quot;Pranks 2&quot; book.
* &quot;452 x 157 cm^2 global durability&quot; (2002-)
** Together with Patick Hoenninger. Milk packages are collected in many countries. The standardized format of the Tetra Pak offers a worldwide frame for creative variation, which becomes visible on the 9.5 by 16.5 cm front of the packaging. According to the group, the relation to pop art not only exists in an aesthetic but also in a social dimension, reminiscent of Walter Benjamin&#x27;s &quot;The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technological Reproducibility.&quot;
* &quot;The Absent Quintessence&quot; (2002)
** Feature films were drastically cut and thereby wrenched out of their genres (hardcore porn, splatter, eastern/kung fu, zombie, etc.). These genre films – all of which are characterized by certain anonymity and a mass-produced look – have been stripped of their &quot;essential&quot; scenes (for example, all sex scenes in pornography, all fight scenes in the kung fu films). Thus, the material has been reduced to a bare-bones plot that had actually been conceived only as filler, but its aesthetics and stereotypical narrative patterns now make it easy to contextualize. The project tried to analyze these &quot;re-released&quot; shorts and to filter out interesting subtexts.
* &quot;Towers of Hanoi&quot; (2002)
** Members of the group entered a bank and exchanged 50 euros for dollars, then back again to euros - and so on - until the money was gone. Afterward the group calculated how many times you have to exchange the global amount of cash (20 trillion euros) from euros to dollars until it vanishes completely. It was calculated that if this process was completed a total of 849 times using the global amount of cash, 18 cents would remain.
* &quot;Blattoptera&quot; (2003–2005) 
** Artists were invited to design a gallery-space for their tribe of South American cockroaches. Each month a different international artist, or arts group, was invited to design an environment in which the cockroaches are placed, to act as audience for, and as aesthetic judges of the work.
* &quot;Brandmarker&quot; (2003-)
** How well do people remember the logos of large corporations that sell consumer goods? An attempt to evaluate the actual power of commercial brands by making people draw famous logos from memory.
* &quot;Eignblunzn&quot; (2003)
** Members of the group prepared blood sausage out of their own blood and ate it (&#x27;auto blood sausage&#x27;). The performance was accompanied by political essays about the &#x27;autocannibalistic&#x27; tendencies of the global economy. The event also can be interpreted as a critical statement about art, art history, and the art market (Viennese Actionism).
* &quot;Instant Blitz Copy Fight&quot; (2004-)
** People from all over the world are asked to take flash pictures of copyright warnings in movie theaters. Monochrom (in cooperation with Cory Doctorow) collects and exhibits those pictures as a copyleft/Free Culture statement.
* &quot;The Flower Currency&quot; (2005)
** A project to explore a value exchange system, created and owned by children, to enable artists to collaborate on the creation of interdisciplinary artworks.
* &quot;Udo 77&quot; (2004)
** A musical about Udo Proksch, a criminal figure in recent Austrian history. Born to a poor family he rose to become the darling of Austrian high society before landing in jail on a life sentence for sinking a ship and its crew in order to cash in on insurance of nonexistent goods. His perfectly tuned network of sponsors, friends, and political functionaries could not hush up the scandal and many of his associates joined him in his fall from grace.
* &quot;1 Baud&quot; (2005)
** Monochrom held workshops in San Francisco to teach people semaphore communication techniques (&#x27;International Code of Signals&#x27;). After a few days set aside for study and practice, they started a citywide performance to send messages through town at a speed of 1 baud. (&quot;1 Baud&quot; was part of the &quot;Experience The Experience&quot; tour.)
* &quot; Brick Of Coke &quot; (2005)
** Monochrom created a &#x27;Brick Of Coke&#x27;: they put twenty gallons of Coca-Cola into a pot and boiled it down for a week until the residue left behind could be molded into a brick. The performance and talk dealt with the sugar industry and other multinational corporation policies and Coca-Cola as a symbol of corporate power. (&quot;Brick Of Coke&quot; was part of the &quot;Experience The Experience&quot; tour.)
* &quot;Buried Alive&quot;/&quot;Six Feet Under Club&quot; (2005-) 
** In 2010 Monochrom created the &quot;Six Feet Under Club&quot;. Couples could volunteer to be buried together in a casket beneath the ground to perform sexual acts. In a press release they explained that the space they occupy is &quot;extremely private and intimate&quot;. The coffin &quot;is a reminder of the social norm of exclusive pair bonding &#x27;till death do us part&#x27;.&quot; However, this intimate scene was corrupted by the presence of a night vision webcam which projects the scene on to an outside wall. The scenario kept the intimacy of a sexual moment intact while moving the private act into public space. Monochrom&#x27;s performance can be seen as an absurd parody of pornographic cinema or an examination of the high value placed on sexual privacy. &quot;Six Feet Under Club&quot; performances took place in San Francisco in 2010 and Vienna in 2013 and 2014.
** People in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Vancouver and Toronto had the opportunity to be buried alive in a real coffin for fifteen minutes. As a framework program Monochrom members held lectures about the history of the science of determining death and the medical cultural history of &quot;buried alive&quot;. (&quot;Buried Alive&quot; was launched as part of the &quot;Experience The Experience&quot; tour in 2005, but was extended beyond the tour and became a permanent coffin installation at VSL Lindabrunn in Lower Austria in 2013.
* &quot;Catapulting Wireless Devices&quot; (2005)
** The catapult is one of the oldest machines in the history of technology. Monochrom created an ironic statement about progress. The group build a small medieval trebuchet and used a couple of issues of the techno-utopist magazine Wired as a counterweight to catapult wireless devices (e.g. cell phones or PDAs) at the greatest possible distance. (&quot;Catapulting Wireless Devices&quot; was part of the &quot;Experience The Experience&quot; tour.)
* &quot;Farewell to Overhead&quot; (2005)
** The group created a melancholic electro pop song about the &quot;dead medium&quot; overhead projector and adolescence/socialisation.
* &quot;Growing Money&quot; (2005)
** To quote Monochrom&#x27;s press statement: &quot;Money is frozen desire. Thus it governs the world. Money is used for all forms of trade, from daily shopping at the supermarket to trafficking in human beings and drugs. In the course of all these transactions, our money wears out quickly, especially the smaller banknotes that are changing hands constantly. ... Money is dirty, and thus it is a living entity. This is something we take literally: money is an ideal environment for microscopic organisms and bacteria. We want to make your money grow. In a potent nutrient fluid under heat lamps we want to get as much life as we can out of your dollar bills.&quot; (&quot;Growing Money&quot; was part of the &quot;Experience The Experience&quot; tour.)
* &quot;Illegal Space Race&quot; (2005)
** Monochrom placed the planets true to scale (sun, 4 meters in diameter at Machine Gallery, Alvarado Street, near Echo Park) throughout the Los Angeles cityscape. Then they conducted an &#x27;illegal space car race&#x27; through the solar system. (&quot;Illegal Space Race&quot; was part of the &quot;Experience The Experience&quot; tour.)
* &quot;Magnetism Party&quot; (2005)
** In form of a staged college party, Monochrom deleted all the electromagnetic storage media that they could find with a couple of heavy-duty neodymium magnets. Monochrom stated that the Magnetism Party was an attempt to actively come to terms with one aspect of the information society that is almost completely ignored by our epistemological machinery: forgetting. The slogan was &quot;Delete is just another word for nothing left to lose&quot;. (&quot;Magnetism Party&quot; was part of the &quot;Experience The Experience&quot; tour.)
* &quot;Arad-II&quot; (2005): 
** The members of Monochrom staged a fake (public theatre performance) about a deadly virus outbreak at &#x27;Art Basel Miami Beach&#x27;, one of the biggest art fairs in North America. Monochrom dealt with the networking/business aspect of the art market, the post-September 11, 2001 attacks hysteria about biological warfare, and the media coverage about Avian influenza (bird flu). Press release quote: &quot;In mid-November 2005, Günther Friesinger visited the Ulaangom Biennial in the Republic of Mongolia. ... He directly departed to Miami to attend some meetings at Art Basel Miami Beach. ... There is acute evidence that he is carrying a rare, but highly contagious sub-form of the Arad-II Virus (family Onoviridae), of which Freiburg virus is also a member. ... Friesinger is walking around the different art fairs in Miami Beach and is spreading the pathogen. The situation is critical. A worldwide outbreak – due to the many visitors from all over the world – is imminent. ... We want to find all the people that Günther Friesinger small talked to and handshaked with. We want to retrieve and destroy the business cards he has spread. Additionally, we must take him into custody and in the event of his death cremation is absolutely necessary.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Arad-II Crisis / monochrom&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* &quot;Café King Soccer (Café König Fußball)&quot; (2006)
** In June 2006, Monochrom created the art installation &#x27;Café King Soccer&#x27; at NGBK Gallery in Berlin. The installation deals with the soccer corruption case in whose centre we find referee Robert Hoyzer. Monochrom reflect on the fact that soccer has at all times mirrored the dialectics between the culture of subjectivity of the working class and the assertion of objectivity of middle-class culture. The former is represented by the collectives that meet in the game, the latter by the referee, an exemplary civil subject conducting the game by acting as its objective opponent. The Hoyzer case violated this agreement. In it, Hoyzer is – especially in the forefront of the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany – also a tragic character, because he acted out his inner self-contradiction as an exemplary civil subject in a publicly effective way. At the same time, the Hoyzer case is itself an integral part of the game – merely because of his exemplary immolation as a scapegoat which seems to correspond exactly to his role on the field - and conditio sine qua non of its perpetuation.
* &quot;Campaign for the Abolition Of Personal Pronouns&quot; (2006):
** Monochrom propagates the creation of gender-neutral personal pronouns. In an activist way the group states that there is a relationship between the structure of language and the way people think and act (see Constructivism).
* &quot;Waiting for GOTO&quot; (2006):
** The reference point Monochrom chose for their theatre-project &#x27;Waiting for GOTO&#x27; (Volkstheater Wien) is the theatre classic &#x27;Waiting for Godot&#x27; which is projected into the future by modernistic references to science-fiction. In &#x27;Waiting for Goto&#x27; we meet &#x27;ideological delinquents&#x27; in a distant interstellar future who are separated from their bodies and locked up in two female students who are able to earn their college fees and make ends meet thanks to this job. The play presents us with Monochrom&#x27;s portrayal of everyday work in a neo-liberal society, double consciousness, the endurance of incorporated contradictions by fragmented subjects, and the exploitation of the living body, self-alienation.
* &quot;Lord Jim Lodge powered by monochrom&quot; (2006-): 
**The Lord Jim Lodge was founded during the 1980s by the artists Jörg Schlick, Martin Kippenberger, Albert Oehlen and Wolfgang Bauer. Every member was obliged to use the lodge logo and/or the &quot;Sun Breasts Hammer&quot; symbol and the slogan &quot;No one helps nobody&quot; in his work. The group&#x27;s declared goal was to make the logo &quot;more well known than that of Coca-Cola&quot;. Thanks to the international recognition received by the oeuvres of Kippenberger, Oehlen, and Schlick the Lord Jim Lodge has already attained a relatively high degree of notoriety. Still, the logo&#x27;s dissemination has remained – despite the international reputation that these artists have achieved – within the framework of the art system and its peripheral importance. As an intentional addition to works of visual art, it was in the end limited by their material form of existence. In March 2006 it was announced that Monochrom has assumed ownership of all trademark and usage rights of the artist Jörg Schlick&#x27;s Lord Jim Lodge. Monochrom took part in a contest by &#x27;Coca-Cola Light&#x27; (&#x27;Coca-Cola Light Art Edition 2006&#x27;). Quote Monochrom: &quot;This puts us in a position to set in motion long overdue synergy effects between Coca-Cola and the Lord Jim Lodge. The only possibility for realizing the challenge formulated in the lodge logo is to use habitat in the merchandise world as a vehicle of transmission for guiding the message through that world&#x27;s channels of distribution and into public consciousness. ... Thus we would like to use the prize as a trial run for such a form of cooperation/competition. Coca-Cola and Lord Jim Lodge – together at last! The symbolic-economic capital of the Lord Jim Lodge and the economic-symbolic capital of Coca-Cola will be brought together, paving the way for a better future. For a world of radical beauty and exclusive bottles in small editions! In the end, we are all individuals – at least as long as nobody comes along and proves the contrary.&quot; Monochrom won the prize. The logo of &quot;Lord Jim Lodge powered by monochrom&quot; was printed on 50.000 Coca-Cola Light bottles.
* &quot;Taugshow&quot; (2006-):
**Monochrom produce a regular TV talk show for a Viennese community TV station and put it online on their page under a Creative Commons license. &quot;Taug&quot;show is referring to the Viennese slang term &#x27;taugen&#x27; (to dig something, to adore something). Quote: &quot;Our guests are geeks, heretics, and other coevals. Taugshow is a tour-de-farce, condensed into the well-known cultural technique of a prime time TV show.&quot; Guests are people like underground publisher V. Vale, sex activist and author Violet Blue, Chaos Computer Club spokesman Andy Müller-Maguhn, RepRap designer Vik Olliver, fashion researcher Adia Martin, media activist Eddie Codel, blog researcher Klaus Schönberger, computer crime lawyer Jennifer Granick, bondage instructor J. D. Lenzen, science researcher Karin Harrasser, blogger Regine Debatty, IT expert Emmanuel Goldstein, DEF CON founder Jeff Moss, Tim Pritlove and blogger/writer Cory Doctorow.
* &quot;Arse Elektronika&quot; (2007-): 
**Monochrom organizes a series of conferences about sex and technology. The first conference was held in October 2007 in San Francisco and dealt with &quot;pr0nnovation&quot; (the history of pornography and technological innovation) and featured speakers such as Mark Dery, Violet Blue and Eon McKai.
**Arse Elektronika 2008 dealt with &quot;Sex and Science Fiction&quot; (&#x27;Do Androids Sleep With Electric Sheep?&#x27;) and was held in San Francisco in October 2008. It featured speakers like Rudy Rucker and Constance Penley.
**The general theme of Arse Elektronika 2009 was &#x27;Of Intercourse and Intracourse&#x27; (genetics, biotechnology, wetware, body modifications) and took place October 2009 in San Francisco. Featured guests: R. U. Sirius, Annalee Newitz, Allen Stein.
**2010 the first Arse Elektronika exhibition was presented in the city of Hong Kong.

**Arse Elektronika compilations
***There are currently four compilations or proceedings of essays presented at, or relevant to, the themes of Arse Elektronika.
* &quot;Sculpture Mobs&quot; (2008-): 
** Monochrom promotes a concept called Sculpture Mobs. At the 2008 Maker Faire in San Mateo, California Monochrom trained attendees to erect public sculptures in a simulated Wal-Mart parking lot in just 5 minutes before &quot;security&quot; was called. Quote: &quot;No one is safe from public sculptures, those endless atrocities! All of them are labeled &#x27;art in public space&#x27;. Unchallenging hunks of aesthetic metal in business parks, roundabouts, in shopping malls! It is time to create DIY public art! Get your hammers! Get your welding equipment!&quot;
** Monochrom teamed up with the Billboard Liberation Front to create a political illegal public sculpture called &quot;The Great Firewall of China&quot; at the Google Campus in Mountain View, California.
** Monochrom created additional Sculpture Mobs and Sculpture Mob Training Camps in various cities: Graz (2008), Ljubljana (2008) and Barcelona (2010).
*&quot;Der Streichelnazi / Nazi Petting Zoo&quot; (2008): 
** The group staged a public &quot;Nazi petting&quot; or &quot;hugging&quot; on a heavily frequented Viennese shopping street. The piece is a political and ironic statement about Austria&#x27;s Nazi past and how Austria deals with it. Quote from their video documentation: &quot;In 1938 Austria joined the Third Reich. Millions cheered Hitler and in the referendum, 99.75% said &#x27;yes&#x27; to &#x27;Greater Germany&#x27;. But after World War II, many Austrians sought comfort in the idea of Austria as &quot;the Nazis&#x27; first victim&quot;. Factions of Austrian society tried for a long time to advance the view that it was only annexation at the point of a bayonet(te). But it&#x27;s time to embrace history. It&#x27;s time to remember the feel-good days of 1938. It&#x27;s time to let our real feelings out! It&#x27;s time to hug the Nazi, Austria! Finally!&quot;
*&quot;Carefully Selected Moments&quot; (2008):
** Monochrom publishes a Best-Of CD featuring re-recorded versions of some of the group&#x27;s favorite songs.
*&quot;Hacking the Spaces&quot; (2009-):
** Monochrom publishes a much-debated pamphlet by Johannes Grenzfurthner who (in collaboration with Frank Apunkt Schneider) makes a critical study on hackerspaces. In writing the historical context of hackerspaces originally expanding from the counter culture movement and conceived as niches against bourgeois society, Grenzfurthner and Schneider argue that hackerspaces today function quite differently as they initially did. Back in the seventies, these open spaces were imagined as tiny worlds to escape from capitalism or authoritarian regimes. The idea was much more based on micro-political tactics than on hippie&#x27;s spirit: Instead of trying to transfer the old world into a new one people started to build up tiny new worlds with the old world. They made up open space where people could come together and try out different forms of living, working, maybe loving and whatever people do when they want to do something. In a capitalist society, alternative concepts always end up being commodified such as &quot;indie music&quot; becoming mainstream. According to Grenzfurthner and Schneider, the same happened to hackerspaces when &quot;the political approach faded away on &quot;en route&quot; into tiny geeky workshop paradises&quot;.
*&quot;Kiki and Bubu&quot; (2008-): 
** Invited by Boing Boing&#x27;s Xeni Jardin, Monochrom created a sock puppet show focussing on the characters of Kiki and Bubu, an orange-red bird and a brown bear. Kiki is the well-read one, while Bubu is portrayed as a little slow, but often surprises with deep insights. Kiki and Bubu are fond of the ideology of Neo-Marxism and the series is based on the idea of explaining leftist terms (like commodification, neoliberalism, alienation, planned economy) in an entertaining yet surreal way.
** The first installments were short films (2008), but Monochrom also created life puppet shows (2008, 2010, 2014) and a 50-minute feature video called &quot;Kiki and Bubu: Rated R Us&quot; (2011): &quot;Kiki and Bubu have some feelings, so they sign up for an online dating site. When the People of China want to become their friends, they are excited. However, sending the People of China a video of themselves proves to be difficult: Their content gets flagged as inappropriate and taken down from YouTube. On the long quest for knowledge that follows, Kiki and Bubu learn all about Internet censorship. And love.&quot;
*&quot;Antidev - God Hates Game Designers&quot; (2012):
** Monochrom member Johannes Grenzfurthner staged a fundamentalist Christian protest, holding signs like &quot;God Hates Game Designers&quot; and &quot;Thou Shalt Not Monetize Thy Neighbor&quot; at the Game Developers Conference 2012 in San Francisco, attacking the focus on marketing and monetization. The images went viral and provoked much controversy.
*&quot;Die Gstettensaga: The Rise of Echsenfriedl&quot; (2014):
** A sci-fi fantasy comedy about the post-apocalyptic world after the so-called &quot;Google Wars&quot;. The movie was produced for Austria&#x27;s TV station ORF and deals with the politics and hype behind media technology and nerd culture. The film was directed by Johannes Grenzfurthner.
*&quot;Hedonistika&quot; (2014-):
** Monochrom&#x27;s &quot;smorgastic Festival for Gastrobots, Culinatronics, Advanced Snackhacks and Nutritional Mayhem&quot;, an event dedicated to approaches in gastronomical robots, cooking machines, molecular cuisine and experimental food performances. The first installment was presented in Montréal at the &#x27;Biennale internationale d&#x27;art numérique&#x27;. The second installment was presented in Holon, near Tel Aviv, at &#x27;Print Screen Festival&#x27;, and in Linz at Ars Electronica 2022.
*&quot;monochrom&#x27;s ISS&quot; (2011): 
** Monochrom creates an improv reality sitcom for theater stages portraying the first year of operation of the International Space Station. The show depicts day-to-day working life in outer space and asks questions about work under the special conditions (and impairments) of a space station, to come to terms with weightlessness and the dictatorship of the functional. The production features actor Jeff Ricketts.
*&quot;Creative Class Escort Service (Kreativlaufhaus)&quot; (2015): 
** Monochrom offered an escort service for creative workers (like writers, sculptors, curators, art theorists, filmmakers, designers). The basic concept was to run a &quot;Laufhaus&quot;, a specific form of German/Austrian brothel where sex workers rent a room and offer services. Monochrom also transported creative workers to clients off-site. Monochrom wanted to start a public debate about the working conditions in art and the sex work field.
*&quot;Occupy East India Trading Company&quot; (2015):
** At the annual TEDxVienna conference, members of Monochrom entered the Volkstheater in 17th-century costumes, carrying a sign and pamphlets protesting the East India Company. The group wanted to address the history of global corporations, especially at a corporate-sponsored event as TEDx: &quot;The East India Company – the first great multinational corporation, and the first to run amok – was the ultimate model for many of today&#x27;s joint-stock corporations.&quot;
*&quot;Shingal, where are you?&quot; (2016):
** Set in an abandoned coal mine at the Turkish border, the documentary &quot;Shingal, where are you?&quot; weaves together the stories of Yezidi refugees following ISIS attacks and the kidnapping of more than 3000 women and children. The story is told in raw cinematography from the parallel perspective of three generations of Yezidis. The film was directed by Angelos Rallis and Hans Ulrich Goessl. Monochrom functioned as the co-production company.
*&quot;Traceroute&quot; (2016):
** A documentary about the history, politics, and impact of nerd culture. It was written and directed by Johannes Grenzfurthner.
*&quot;Anima Ex Machina&quot; (2020):
** The novel &quot;Anima Ex Machina&quot; is a good example of Monochrom&#x27;s history as publisher. The German science fiction and fantasy writer Michael Marrak was invited to Vienna as an artist-in-residence in September and October 2020. He created the sci-fi novel &quot;Anima Ex Machina&quot;, which was then published by Monochrom. The novel was nominated for the Kurd Laßwitz Award, possibly the best-known science fiction award from Germany.
*&quot;Glossary of Broken Dreams&quot; (2018): 
** An essayistic feature film by Johannes Grenzfurthner that tries to present an overview of political concepts such as freedom, privacy, identity, resistance, etc. The film features performances by Amber Benson, Max Grodenchik, Jason Scott, Maschek, Jeff Ricketts and others.
*&quot;Masking Threshold&quot; (2021):
** A horror drama film directed by Johannes Grenzfurthner, written by Grenzfurthner and Samantha Lienhard. The synopsis: &quot;Conducting a series of experiments in his makeshift home-lab, a skeptical IT worker tries to cure his harrowing hearing impairment. But where will his research lead him? Masking Threshold combines a chamber play, a scientific procedural, an unpacking video and a DIY YouTube channel while suggesting endless vistas of existential pain and decay.&quot;
*&quot;Razzennest&quot; (2022):
** A horror comedy film written and directed by Johannes Grenzfurthner. South African filmmaker and enfant terrible Manus Oosthuizen meets with film critic Babette Cruickshank in a Los Angeles sound studio. With key members of Manus&#x27;s crew joining, they record an audio commentary track for his new &quot;elegiac feature documentary &quot;Razzennest&quot;.&quot; Strange incidents occur during the recording session.

*&quot;Hacking at Leaves&quot; (2024):
**An documentary film directed and written by Johannes Grenzfurthner. It explores various themes including the United States&#x27; colonial past, Navajo tribal history, and the hacker movement, through the lens of the story of a hackerspace in Durango, Colorado, during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.
*&quot;Solvent&quot; (2024):
**A supernatural mystery horror film directed by Johannes Grenzfurthner. In an Austrian farmhouse, a team of experts discovers a hidden secret while searching for Nazi documents.

<doc id="1029283" wikidata="Q6055592" url="?curid=1029283" title="Internet Mail 2000">
<text>Internet Mail 2000 is an Internet mail architecture proposed by Daniel J. Bernstein (and in subsequent years separately proposed by several others), designed with the precept that the initial storage of mail messages be the responsibility of the sender, and not of the recipient as it is with the SMTP-based Internet mail architecture.

Whereas the SMTP-based Internet mail architecture has a close analogue in the architecture of paper mail, this is not the case for &quot;Internet Mail 2000&quot;. Its architecture depends on various things that are unique to the natures of the Internet and to electronic messages. One of its goals is to reduce spam.

== Implementations ==
Over the years since Daniel J. Bernstein proposed it, several attempts have been made to design and to implement a real &quot;Internet Mail 2000&quot; system, with varying degrees of achievement. The closest thing to a concrete, open implementation of the system is Meng Weng Wong&#x27;s StubMail, which was presented at Google in July 2006.

== See also ==
Bernstein has also suggested the Quick Mail Transfer Protocol (QMTP).

<doc id="1029287" wikidata="Q7791671" url="?curid=1029287" title="Thomas Lake Harris">
<text>Thomas Lake Harris (May 15, 1823 – March 23, 1906) was an Anglo-American Universalist minister, spiritualistic prophet, poet, and vintner. Harris is best remembered as the leader of a series of communal religious experiments, culminating with a group called the Brotherhood of the New Life in Santa Rosa, California.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Thomas Lake Harris was born May 15, 1823, at Fenny Stratford in Buckinghamshire, England. His parents were strict Calvinistic Baptists and very poor. When Harris was five years old his parents emigrated from England, settling in the town of Utica, New York. His mother died when he was still a young boy and Harris was forced by circumstances to help support the family from the age of 9.

At the age of 21 Harris became a Universalist minister, preaching to the congregation of the Fourth Universalist Society in the City of New York.

From 1848 he became minister of an independent Christian congregation in New York City. In that church he came into contact with young newspaper publisher Horace Greeley, who was so moved by one of Harris&#x27;s sermons that he was inspired to organize Harris&#x27;s congregation to help found the New York Juvenile Asylum.

===Mysticism and communalism===

Harris soon turned towards spiritualism, becoming a devotee of the Swedish mystic Emanuel Swedenborg. By 1851 he had departed New York for Virginia, where together with Rev. J. L. Scott he launched the first of his communal enterprises, the Mountain Cove Community of Spiritualists, on pristine land claimed by one of the group&#x27;s leaders to be the actual site of the Garden of Eden. It was intended to there create a &quot;city of refuge&quot; from which angels were to descend and ascend. The experiment was racked by squabbling over property and personalities, and after two years the Virginia commune collapsed.

Following the collapse of the Mountain Cove Community, Harris went back to his native England, where he preached modified Swedenborgian ideas to a London congregation for several years. There he began his career as a writer and poet, publishing several books. Harris&#x27;s poetry was well-regarded and he was the subject of a chapter by Alfred Austin in his book &quot;The Poetry of the Period.&quot;

===Brotherhood of the New Life===

Harris subsequently returned to America, settling in the town of Amenia in Dutchess County, New York. He would remain at Amenia for five or six years, establishing a bank, a flour mill, and a vineyard, and gathering around him a small group of devoted religious disciples. Included among the approximately sixty converts were five orthodox clergymen and about 20 Japanese from Satsuma Province. The community—the Brotherhood of the New Life—decided to settle at the village of Brocton, New York on the shore of Lake Erie. Its nature was co-operative rather than communistic, and farming and industrial occupations were engaged in by his followers, numbering at one time about 2,000 in the United States and Great Britain. He professed to teach his community a change in the mode of respiration which was to be the visible sign of possession by Christ and the seal of immortality.

In Brocton, Harris established a winemaking industry. In reply to the objections of teetotallers, Harris said that the wine prepared by himself was filled with the divine breath so that all noxious influences were neutralized. Harris also built a tavern and strongly advocated the use of tobacco.

===Later years===

Harris took part of the community to Santa Rosa, California, where in about 1875 he created the Fountain Grove community. For a time in 1876 Harris discontinued public activities, but issued, to a secret circle, books of verse dwelling mainly on sexual questions. In 1891 he announced that his body had been renewed, and that he had discovered the secret of the resuscitation of humanity. He also made a third marriage, and visited England intending to remain there. However, Harris was called back by a fire which destroyed large stocks of his wine, and remained in New York till 1903, when he visited Glasgow. His followers believed that he had attained the secret of immortal life on earth, and after his death on the March 23, 1906, declared that he was only sleeping. It was three months before it was acknowledged publicly that he was really dead.

He was succeeded by Nagasawa Kanaye, who led the sect until his death in 1934.

==Dissension and influence==

About 1881, Laurence Oliphant and his wife broke away from the sect, charging Harris with robbery and succeeding in getting back from him many thousands of pounds by legal proceedings. But while losing faith in Harris himself, they did not abandon his main teaching. Oliphant&#x27;s view of Harris will be found in his novel &quot;Masollam&quot;. Briefly, he held that Harris was originally honest, greatly gifted, and possessed of certain psychical powers. But in the end he came to practice unbridled licence under the loftiest pretensions, made the profession of extreme disinterestedness a cloak to conceal his avarice, and demanded from his followers a blind and supple obedience.

The utopian ideals promoted by Harris had significant influence among his Japanese followers. These included:
* Arai Osui (1846–1922), who initially transmitted Harris&#x27;s ideas to Japan.
* Hatakeyama Yoshinari (1843–1876), later president of Tokyo Kansei Gakko.
* Ichiki Kanjuro (1842–1919), commonly known as Mitsumura Junzo, later an admiral in the Japanese Imperial Navy.
* Samejima Hisanobu (1846–1880), later an ambassador
* Yoshida Kiyonari (1845–1891), later an ambassador
* Nagasawa Kanaye (1852–1934), Harris&#x27;s California lieutenant, who acted as developer and manager of the community&#x27;s of vineyards near Santa Rosa. He succeeded Harris and acted as leader of the brotherhood until 1934.

Harris&#x27;s community left a significant stamp on the history of Santa Rosa; today that part of town is still called Fountaingrove. A street therein, Thomas Lake Harris Drive, is named for him. The round barn that was part of the winery of Harris&#x27;s protege, Kanaye Nagasawa, was an emblem of the community; it burned in the 2017 Tubbs Fire. A local park and lake were recently named in Nagasawa&#x27;s honor.

==Publications and sources==
Harris published a book, &quot;Lyra triumphalis&quot;, dedicated to A. C. Swinburne. His teaching was esoteric in form, but has been considered a thinly veiled attempt to alter the ordering of sexual relations.

A good deal of the verse published by Harris in more than 40 volumes had what we would call today science-fictional themes. He depicted interplanetary empires, imperial cities entirely covering planets, and the &quot;ancient astronaut&quot; myth, in which space travellers help early humans with agriculture, technology and spiritual development.

&quot;The Path&quot; (Vol. VI, February, 1892, pp. 346–47) printed the article &quot;The Brotherhood of the New Life&quot; by W. Q. Judge, which said that &quot;The Brotherhood of the New Life&quot; has nothing in common with the Theosophical Society. Judge was a follower of Helena P. Blavatsky, the founder of theosophy.

The authoritative biography from the side of the disciples of Harris is the book &quot;Life&quot; by A. A. Cuthbert, published in Glasgow in 1908. Containing language common to Harris&#x27;s sect, it also contains some biographical facts as well as quotations.

The information about Harris in &quot;Memoir of the Life of Laurence Oliphant and of Alice Oliphant, his Wife&quot; (1891), by Margaret Oliphant, his cousin, has not been refuted and Oliphant&#x27;s own portrait of Harris in &quot;Masollam&quot; seems truthful. But his personal magnetism and self-confidence led many to continue to believe in him.

<doc id="1029296" wikidata="Q5191686" url="?curid=1029296" title="Elizabeth Yeats">
<text>Elizabeth Corbet Yeats (11 March 1868 – 16 January 1940), known as Lolly, was an Irish educator and publisher. She worked as an art teacher and published several books on art, and was a founder of Dun Emer Press which published several works by her brother W. B. Yeats. She was the first commercial printer in Ireland to work exclusively with hand presses.

==Early life and education==
Elizabeth Corbet Yeats was born at 23 Fitzroy Road, London. She was the daughter of the Irish artist John Butler Yeats and Susan Yeats (née Pollexfen). She was sister to W. B., Jack and Susan Mary &quot;Lily&quot; Yeats. From the age of four she lived in Merville, Sligo, at the home of her grandfather William Pollexfen. In November 1874 her family moved to 14 Edith Villas, West Kensington, London. Her governess was Martha Jowitt from 1876 until 1879 before the family moved to Bedford Park, Chiswick, in 1878.

Yeats returned to Howth, County Dublin in 1881. She enrolled, with her sister Susan, in the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art in 1883 and took classes at the Royal Dublin Society.

The family moved to Eardley Crescent, South Kensington, London, in 1886. While there Yeats started to write fiction and published a home-made magazine, The Pleiades, with six friends, contributing ‘Story without a plot’ to the Christmas 1888 issue. In addition, she published ‘Scamp and three friends’ in The Vegetarian.

Yeats also attended the Chiswick School of Art with her sister Susan and brother Jack Butler Yeats, learning &quot;Freehand drawing in all its branches, practical Geometry and perspective, pottery and tile painting, design for decorative purposes&quot;.

In the 1890s she lived at 3 Blenheim Road, Bedford Park, London and trained as a kindergarten teacher at the Froebel College in Bedford, Bedfordshire. She undertook her teaching practice at the Bedford Park High School. In 1892 when her training was completed she taught as a visiting art mistress at the Froebel Society, Chiswick High School and the Central Foundation School.

== Career ==
Lecturing and publication of four popular painting manuals: &quot;Brushwork&quot; (1896), &quot;Brushwork studies of flowers, fruits and animals&quot; (1898), &quot;Brushwork copy book&quot; (1899), and &quot;Elementary brushwork studies&quot; (1900) earned Yeats a good income.

She trained and worked as an art teacher and was a member of William Morris&#x27;s circle in London before her family returned to Dublin in 1900. Yeats wrote and created the artwork for &quot;Elementary Brush-Work Studies&quot; (published in 1900), an educational book that teaches young children the technique of painting flowers and plants using her simple method. At the suggestion of Emery Walker, who worked with Morris on the Kelmscott Press, Yeats studied printing with the Women&#x27;s Printing Society in London.

In Dublin, she accepted the invitation to join Evelyn Gleeson to form the Dun Emer Guild along with Lily, who was an embroiderer. &quot;The name Dun Emer (Fort of Emer) was named for the Lady Emer, wife of the hero Cúchulainn, renowned in Irish folklore for her beauty and artistic skills.&quot; Yeats managed the Dun Emer Press from 1902 with a printing press acquired from a provincial newspaper. The Press was located at Runnymede, the house of Evelyn Gleeson. (This house, located in Dundrum, was later renamed Dun Emer. It has since been demolished.) This was set up with the intention of training young women in bookbinding and printing as well as embroidery and weaving. In 1903, Yeats started printing and Dun Emer&#x27;s first book was W. B. Yeats&#x27;s &quot;In the seven woods&quot; (1903). 

Despite being a gifted printer, the costings exceeded the quality of work that Yeats produced with the result that the press (like the guild) was often at risk financially. Eleven books, decorated with pastels by George William Russell, appeared under the Dun Emer imprint produced from a first-floor room. Yeats had several disagreements with her brother William over his directions as literary editor. She also disliked Evelyn Gleeson. In October 1906 she travelled to New York to advertise her products but published Dun Emer&#x27;s last book William&#x27;s Discoveries (1907) in late November when she returned to Dublin.

After many years of strained relations between the Yeats sisters and Evelyn Gleeson, their business relationship was finally ended. Subsequently, in 1908, Lolly and her brother William started the Cuala Press, publishing over 70 books including 48 by the poet. Yeats managed the press while her sister Lily controlled the embroidery section. Cuala continued to be a family strain. Their father, John Butler Yeats, had to castigate his son William for sending overtly critical letters to his sisters about the press. However, Cuala produced magnificent books: W. B. Yeats&#x27; &quot;The green helmet and other poems&quot; (1910) and a series of Broadsides (published 1908–15, with illustrations from Jack Yeats).

Yeats was the first commercial printer in Ireland to work exclusively with hand presses.

She worked with Cuala Press until short of her death on 16 January 1940 after a diagnosis of high blood pressure and heart trouble.

== Legacy ==
The Cuala press produced handcrafted books, cards and prints. An academic project at the Irish Art Research Centre, Trinity College Dublin is putting images from some of the prints online. The role of the press, which only employed women, in supporting women&#x27;s rights, and also a new national identity and confidence after the 1921 independence of Ireland from Britain, is now understood. The prints, which sold widely in the UK, USA and Ireland and which were radical at that time, showed, counter to the prevailing stereotypes of the time, a fresh view of Ireland as prosperous and with strong rural traditions.

<text>China Ocean Shipping Company (abbreviated as COSCO) was a former shipping corporation from 1961 to 2016, owned by the State Council of China. The company merged with China Shipping Group Company to form China COSCO Shipping Corporation in January 2016. 

COSCO was founded in 1961 as a state-owned shipping and logistics services supplier company. 

COSCO headquarters is in Ocean Plaza in the Xicheng District in Beijing. It owns 1114 ships, including 365 dry bulk vessels, a container fleet with a capacity of , and a tanker fleet of 120 vessels. The fleet calls at over a thousand ports worldwide. It ranks among the largest in both number of container ships and aggregate container volume in the world. In 2012, it was among China&#x27;s top 15 brands.

It was the largest dry bulk carrier in China and one of the largest dry bulk shipping operators worldwide. In addition, the Group is the largest liner carrier in China.

COSCO division COSCO Shipping Port Company manages the company&#x27;s port operations.

==History==
===China Ocean Shipping Company (1961–1993)===
China Ocean Shipping Company, or COSCO in short, was founded in 1961 as a Chinese government agency. In the same year, a subsidiary was formed in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province. The Guangzhou subsidiary purchased a British vessel and renamed it as &quot;Guanghua&quot; (). &quot;Guanghua&quot; made its maiden voyage to Jakarta for the People&#x27;s Republic of China in April 1961.

After the US resumed diplomatic relations with China in the 1970s, China Ocean Shipping Company signed an agreement with American company Lykes Brothers Steamship Company in 1979. The agreement opens the commercial sea routes between the United States and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In the same year, COSCO became the Chinese side representative to collaborate with International Telephone and Telegraph on repairing the communication facilities in the coastal cities of China.

In 1981, COSCO won a contract from the Pakistani Government owned National Tanker Company of Pakistan, for crude oil transport.

In 1991 COSCO was asked by the US Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) to submit information regarding Chinese Government restricting U.S.-flag carriers on doing business in China. COSCO asked FMC to drop its probe instead. FMC also investigated COSCO for its pricing behavior in 1997, but stated there was not enough evidence to launch a formal probe on alleged under-pricing its service to eliminate competitor.

In August 1993, COSCO&#x27;s ship &quot;Yinhe&quot;, was anchored off the coast of Oman. US government alleged that the ship carried material exported to Iran, which could be used to make chemical weapons. COSCO claimed that the ship only contained &quot;paper goods, hardware and machine parts&quot;. In what became known as the &quot;Yinhe&quot; incident, United States military vessels and aircraft followed the &quot;Yinhe,&quot; disrupting its normal travel route. The United States unilaterally disabled the &quot;Yinhe&quot;&#x27;s civilian GPS, causing it lose direction and anchor on the high seas for twenty-four days until it agreed to inspection. The &quot;Yinhe&quot; experienced shortages of water and fuel. The inspection, which occurred in Saudi Arabia did not find any improper chemicals and on September 4, representatives of the Chinese, Saudi and United States governments jointly signed a certification that the ship&#x27;s cargo did not contain materials related to chemical weapons.

===China Ocean Shipping (Group) Company (1993–2015)===
The company became a holding company and renamed as China Ocean Shipping (Group) Company in 1993. Two other government owned companies, China Marine Bunker Supply Company (Chimbusco in short) and China Road Transport Company, which engaged in oil tanker and road transport businesses respectively, became the subsidiaries of the group in 1988 and 1992 respectively. China Road Transport Company was renamed into COSCO Logistics in 2001 (now part of COSCO Shipping Logistics). As of 2003, COSCO Logistics engaged in shipping agency, freight forwarding, third party logistics and supporting services. While Chimbusco became a joint venture with PetroChina since 2003.

COSCO has a Hong Kong division which the division acquired a HK-listed company Shun Shing Holdings in February 1997. Hong Kong was a British colony until June 30, 1997, and has been a special administrative region of China with a separate jurisdiction system since July 1. Another subsidiary of COSCO HK at that time, COSCO Pacific, was a HK-listed company since 1994. COSCO Pacific has a joint venture with Hongkong International Terminals Limited, which operates a terminal in Kwai Tsing Container Terminals, Hong Kong since 1991. COSCO Pacific acquired 49% stake of COSCO Logistics from the parent company in 2003. COSCO retained the remaining 51%. COSCO Pacific also owned 20% stake of Hong Kong-based Chong Hing Bank from 1997 to 2007. In 2007 the stake was sold to the parent company, COSCO HK.

In 1995, another subsidiary, COSCO Corporation (Singapore) Limited, became a listed company in Singapore Exchange. The company was a component of Straits Times Index until 2010.

COSCO acquired a Shanghai-listed company in 1997 as a vehicle of backdoor listing. It became COSCO Development, which engaged in real estate. The direct parent company of COSCO Development was sold in 2005, thus COSCO Development was no longer part of the COSCO Group. Also in 2005, COSCO Group acquired a company from COSCO Development. That company was the operator of Boao Forum for Asia.

In 1997, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, United States senators from California, had asked the Clinton administration to investigate COSCO&#x27;s leasing on a former naval base in Long Beach. The site was developed into a container port terminal, Pacific Container Terminal. 

In 2002, another subsidiary, COSCO Shipping Co., Ltd., became a listed company in Shanghai.

In 2004, COSCO formed a joint venture with fellow Central Government owned Ansteel Group (&quot;Angang&quot; Group).

In 2005, the flagship subsidiary of COSCO, China COSCO Holdings, became a listed company. The A share of China COSCO Holdings was listed in Shanghai since 2007.

After the post-2008 financial crisis collapse of global shipping, COSCO began gradually acquiring the Greek port of Piraeus. Under COSCO, Piraeus has become a busy port, rising from traffic of 400,000 containers in 2008 to nearly five million containers in 2018. Most European trade with China occurs via Greek ships, including through Piraeus.

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, most shipping companies halted all container shipping to Russia, except for basic food products, medicine and humanitarian aid. The exception is COSCO which continues to ship to Russia, and was the largest shipping company to do so.

===Mergers===
In 2005, a smaller Central Government owned company, China Ocean Shipping Tally (known as China Tally in short), was merged into COSCO Group.

In 2008, China COSCO Holdings was part of Financial Times Global 500 for the first time.

By 2015, after more than 5 decades, COSCO Group expanded into one of the major shipping company of the country. It also had a few listed subsidiaries: COSCO Pacific, COSCO International Holdings, China COSCO Holdings, China International Marine Containers, etc., . Real estate developer, Sino-Ocean Group, was an associate company of COSCO until 2010.

In December 2015, COSCO Group merged with fellow Chinese Government owned China Shipping Group to form China COSCO Shipping. COSCO Group was retained as an intermediate holding company.

In December 2017, COSCO Group (China Ocean Shipping (Group) Company) was re-incorporated from &quot;An industrial enterprise owned by the whole people&quot; to simply a limited company. The name of the company, also changed to China Ocean Shipping Company, Limited ().

== Subsidiaries ==
COSCO contains several listed companies and has more than 300 subsidiaries locally and abroad, providing services in freight forwarding, ship building, ship repair, terminal operation, container manufacturing, trade, financing, real estate, and information technology.

On the eve of 2015 merger, COSCO Group has a few listed companies:
* China COSCO Holdings (SEHK: 1919; SSE: 601919) - flagship listed subsidiary, also known as &quot;China COSCO&quot; or &quot;COSCO Holdings&quot;

Moreover, China International Marine Containers is an associate company of the group, which COSCO indirectly owned 22.77% shares of that listed company as of December 2015. The stake was owned by COSCO Pacific until 2013.

As of 2000, COSCO also owned 30% stake of China Cargo Airlines.

COSCO also had an unlisted business unit in Hong Kong, which was known as COSCO (Hong Kong) Group Limited. COSCO (H.K.) Group was the direct parent company of COSCO Pacific (valid until December 2004) and COSCO International. COSCO (H.K.) Group bought the 20% stake of Chong Hing Bank and the entire stake of Shun Shing Construction from COSCO Pacific and COSCO International respectively in 2007.

<text>Andrzej Mostowski (1 November 1913 – 22 August 1975) was a Polish mathematician. He worked primarily in logic and foundations of mathematics and is perhaps best remembered for the Mostowski collapse lemma. He was a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences and a representative of the Warsaw School of Mathematics.

==Biography==
Born in Lemberg, Austria-Hungary, Mostowski entered University of Warsaw in 1931. He was influenced by Kuratowski, Lindenbaum, and Tarski. His Ph.D. came in 1939, officially directed by Kuratowski but in practice directed by Tarski who was a young lecturer at that time.

He became an accountant after the German invasion of Poland but continued working in the Underground Warsaw University. After the Warsaw uprising of 1944, the Nazis tried to put him in a concentration camp. With the help of some Polish nurses, he escaped to a hospital, choosing to take bread with him rather than his notebook containing his research. Some of this research he reconstructed after the War, however much of it remained lost.

In 1954 Mostowski was awarded by Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta and in 1963 elected a real member of the PAS. After the World War II he supervised Rasiowa&#x27;s both master and doctoral theses in logic and the foundations of mathematics.

His work was largely on recursion theory and undecidability. From 1946 until his death in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, he worked at the University of Warsaw. Much of his work, during that time, was on first order logic and model theory. He also worked at the State Institute of Mathematics, which was incorporated into the Polish Academy of Sciences in 1952.

His son Tadeusz is also a mathematician working on differential geometry. With Krzysztof Kurdyka and Adam Parusinski, Tadeusz Mostowski solved René Thom&#x27;s gradient conjecture in 2000.

<text>Concerto for Group and Orchestra is a live album by Deep Purple and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Malcolm Arnold. Recorded at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall in September 1969, it consists of a concerto composed by Jon Lord, with lyrics by Ian Gillan.

The first full length album to feature Gillan on vocals and Roger Glover on bass, it was released on vinyl in December 1969. It was also the last Purple album distributed in the US by Tetragrammaton Records, which went defunct shortly after.

The original performance included three additional songs: &quot;Hush&quot;, &quot;Wring That Neck&quot;, and &quot;Child in Time&quot;. These were added to a 2002 reissue. 

Long planned by Jon Lord, the project was not very successful in the United States but helped restore Purple&#x27;s reputation and image in the United Kingdom. 

The 1969 performance is considered &quot;groundbreaking&quot; because it was the first time that a major rock band recorded a live album with a full-fledged orchestra, cementing the &quot;then odd but today very common&quot; relationship between heavy rock and classical music. 

&quot;I thought it was a total gimmick,&quot; observed guitarist Ritchie Blackmore. &quot;I told Jon I&#x27;d be prepared to try it, but that I had a lot of heavy rock numbers I wanted to put on an LP, and we&#x27;d see which one took off. I didn&#x27;t want to be involved with the concerto because of the novelty effect, and the press we were getting out of playing it at the Royal Albert Hall. But I said that if the next LP didn&#x27;t take off, I was prepared to play with orchestras for the rest of my life.&quot;

The original score for the concerto was lost in 1970. However, it was performed again in 1999 with a recreated score, and has been performed several times since.

==Original 1969 Royal Albert Hall performance==
The piece was first performed and recorded on 24 September 1969 in the Royal Albert Hall, London, by Deep Purple and The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Malcolm Arnold. The programme consisted of:
==Concerto==
&quot;Concerto for Group and Orchestra&quot; is split into three movements.
; &quot;First movement (Moderato – Allegro)&quot;: After an extended orchestral introduction, the group and orchestra work as separate blocks, trying to get dominance over the main theme and working as antagonists to each other. There are cadenzas for electric guitar and clarinet.
; &quot;Second movement (Andante)&quot;, with lyrics sung by Ian Gillan: This movement is based around two tunes that are played in various different arrangements by the orchestra and the group, individually and together. After a combined pop / blues version of the second tune, there is an organ cadenza followed by a quiet ending by the orchestra.
; &quot;Third movement (Vivace – Presto)&quot;: Apart from Ian Paice&#x27;s drum solo, the music combines the orchestra and group together in a &quot;free for all&quot;. The movement alternates between 6/8 and 2/4 time signatures. 

The &quot;Concerto&quot; was first performed at the Albert Hall in London on 24 September 1969 with Deep Purple and The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Malcolm Arnold. It was performed at second time at the Hollywood Bowl on 25 August 1970, with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Lawrence Foster, after which the score was lost.

==Releases==

&quot;Concerto for Group and Orchestra&quot; was released on vinyl in December 1969 in the United States (Tetragrammaton) and in January 1970 in the United Kingdom (Harvest). These releases contained only the &quot;Concerto&quot;, with the second movement broken in two-halves. Copies of the original US editions are rare as Tetragrammaton went bankrupt while the album was still being issued. In the following year, the &quot;Concerto&quot; became the only Tetragrammaton release to be reissued by Warner Bros., Deep Purple&#x27;s new US label. On 4 April 1970 the &quot;Concerto&quot; was shown on British television as &quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot;. 
The 1990s saw a CD release including the songs &quot;Wring That Neck&quot; and &quot;Child in Time&quot;. In 2002 EMI released special edition DVD-A, SACD and two-CD sets of &quot;Concerto for Group and Orchestra&quot;, featuring the entire programme of music played that night. In 2003 a video recording of this concert was released on DVD. However, four and a half minutes of the 1st Movement are missing in this video, as it was taken straight from the BBC&#x27;s 4 April 1970 broadcast of the event (see above). The edit was in the original BBC broadcast.

==1999 Royal Albert Hall performances==
On 25 and 26 September 1999, thirty years after its initial performance, the &quot;Concerto&quot; was again performed in front of a live audience in the Royal Albert Hall. To make this performance possible, a new score was created by Lord with the assistance of Paul Mann and Marco de Goeij by listening to the recording and watching the video of the 1969 performance. Performers were:

*The London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Paul Mann

A recording of the concert was released on a double CD as &quot;Live at the Royal Albert Hall&quot;. A cut recording of the performance was also released on DVD, entitled &quot;In Concert with the London Symphony Orchestra&quot;.

==2000–2001 tour==
Encouraged by the success of the 1999 performances, Deep Purple took the &quot;Concerto&quot; on tour, first performing it in South America with local orchestras, then in Europe with the George Enescu Philharmonic Orchestra, in Japan with the New Japan Philharmonic Orchestra, all conducted by Paul Mann.

==40th anniversary performance==
On 24 September 2009 Jon Lord joined the RTÉ Concerto Orchestra in the National Concert Hall, Dublin, Ireland to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the first performance of &quot;Concerto for Group and Orchestra.&quot; Also performed, were pieces from Jon Lord&#x27;s solo career and a number of Deep Purple songs including an orchestral version of Child In Time.

==Further performances==
The score of the concerto having been recreated, groups and orchestras across the world were free to perform it:
==2012 studio version==
In October 2012 a studio version of the &quot;Concerto for Group and Orchestra&quot; was released. The recording features the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Paul Mann. The soloists are Jon Lord (organ), Darin Vasilev (guitar in the 1st movement), Joe Bonamassa (guitar in the 2nd movement), Steve Morse (guitar in the 3rd movement), Steve Balsamo, Kasia Łaska, and Bruce Dickinson (vocals), Brett Morgan (drums), and Guy Pratt (bass). The orchestral parts were recorded at the Philharmonic Hall, Liverpool on 1 and 2 June 2011. The band parts were recorded in August and October 2011 and also in May 2012. The album was mixed at Abbey Road Studios in late May 2012. According to Paul Mann, Jon Lord heard the final master of the recording a few days before his death on 16 July 2012.

==Reception==
===Malcolm Arnold&#x27;s views===
In an interview for hospital radio in Huddersfield in 1970, shortly after the Royal Albert Hall performance, Arnold provided a positive take on the experience:
===Ritchie Blackmore&#x27;s views===
In a 1979 interview with &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine Blackmore said:
== Legacy ==

The cover art of the Swedish heavy metal band Opeth&#x27;s 2010 concert DVD &quot;In Live Concert at the Royal Albert Hall&quot; is intentionally similar in layout, colour and motive to that of Deep Purple&#x27;s &quot;Concerto for Group and Orchestra&quot;, &quot;underlining Opeth&#x27;s longstanding love for their prog-rock roots&quot;.

<text>Alice Christiana Gertrude Meynell (née Thompson; 11 October 184727 November 1922) was a British writer, editor, critic, and suffragist, now remembered mainly as a poet. She was considered for the position of Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom twice, first in 1892 on the death of Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and later in 1913 on the death of Alfred Austin, but was never appointed to the position.

Meynell and her husband, Wilfrid Meynell, were the owners and editors of several Catholic publications and patrons of the poet Francis Thompson.

==Early life and family==
Alice Christiana Gertrude Thompson was born in Barnes, London on 11 October 1847 to Thomas James and Christiana (née Weller) Thompson, a painter and concert pianist. The family moved around England, Switzerland, and France, but she was brought up mostly in Italy, where a daughter of her father&#x27;s from his first marriage had settled. Her father was a friend of Charles Dickens, and Meynell suggests in her memoir that Dickens was also romantically interested in her mother, noting that he had said to Thomas Thompson, &quot;Good God, what a madman I should seem if the incredible feeling I have conceived for that girl could be made plain to anyone!&quot;

On her father&#x27;s side, Meynell had Jamaican Creole ancestry and was a third cousin of Elizabeth Barret Browning.

Meynell suffered from ill health during her early life, and in 1868, during a bout of illness, converted to Roman Catholicism. During this time, she reportedly fell in love with the Jesuit Priest, Father Augustus Dignam, who had helped her in her conversion. Dignam is believed to have inspired Meynell&#x27;s love poems &quot;After Parting&quot; and &quot;Renouncement.&quot; By 1880, her entire family had also converted to Catholicism.

In 1876, Meynell met newspaper editor and fellow Catholic convert Wilfrid Meynell (1852-1948), who was five years her junior, and they married in 1877. The couple had eight children: Sebastian, Monica, Everard (1882–1926), Madeleine, Viola, Vivian (who died at three months), Olivia, and Francis. Viola Meynell (1885–1956) became a writer, known mainly for fiction, who later wrote a biography of her mother titled &quot;The Life of Alice Meynell&quot; (1932). Her youngest child Francis Meynell (1891–1975) became a poet and a printer who co-founded The Nonesuch Press.

==Career==

=== Writing and publishing ===
In 1875, Meynell published &quot;Preludes&quot;, her first poetry collection, illustrated by her elder sister Lady Elizabeth Butler (1846–1933). The work was warmly praised by John Ruskin, who especially praised the sonnet &quot;Renouncement&quot; for its beauty and delicacy, though although it received little public notice otherwise.

After their marriage in 1877, Meynell and her husband became a proprietors and editors of various magazines, including &quot;The Pen&quot;, the &quot;Weekly Register&quot;, and &quot;Merry England&quot;, among others. Meynell was highly involved in the editorial work of these publications.

Meynell also continued to publish her own writing, including literary and art criticism, and wrote regularly for &quot;The World&quot;, &quot;The Spectator&quot;, &quot;The Magazine of Art&quot;, the &quot;Scots Observer&quot; (which became the &quot;National Observer&quot;, both edited by W. E. Henley), &quot;The Tablet&quot;, &quot;The Art Journal&quot;, the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot;, and &quot;The Saturday Review&quot;. Her poems show her feminist concerns as well as her reactions to the events of World War I.

=== Patronage of Francis Thompson ===
The poet Francis Thompson, who was homeless and suffering from an opium addiction, sent the couple a manuscript. His poems were first published in the Meynell&#x27;s paper &quot;Merry England&quot;, and the couple became supporters of Thompson. His 1893 book &quot;Poems&quot; was published by the Meynells.

=== Relationships with other writers ===
Meynell and her husband had a wide social circle that included many notable writers of their time, including Jeannette Augustus Marks, Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Frieda and D.H. Lawrence, Harriet Monroe, and Aubrey de Vere.

Meynell also had a deep friendship with Coventry Patmore, whose poetry she supported, that lasted several years. In 1893, Coventry gave Meynell the manuscript for &quot;The Angel in the House&quot;, his best-known work, as a token of their friendship. Eventually, Patmore became obsessively in love with Meynell, leading her to end their friendship. She wrote the article on Patmore for the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;.

=== Artist&#x27;s model ===
Meynell was also involved in the world of art. In 1894, she was drawn by John Singer Sargent, and in 1897 by William Rothenstein. She was also photographed by Sherril Schell in approximately 1911-1913, by E. O. Hoppé in 1914, and by Walter Stoneman in approximately 1916.

Sargent requested Meynell to write the introduction for a collection of his works, titled &quot;The Works of John S. Sargent, R.A.&quot;, in 1903.

== Critical reception ==
In March 1923, a few months after Meynell&#x27;s death, Jeanette Marks published a retrospective of Meynell&#x27;s works in the &quot;North American Review&quot;. She criticized Meynell&#x27;s &quot;religiosity&quot; and &quot;deliberate and labored moral judgments,&quot; but praised Meynell&#x27;s embrace of &quot;the multitude,&quot; writing that:

Also in 1923, Harriet Monroe wrote of Meynell&#x27;s writing, &quot;There is a crying need for a complete edition of Alice Meynell&#x27;s verse and prose...Sometimes her quest of an austere beaty is carried too far toward preciosity, but often she attains without effort a severe clarity and precision which the rising generation will do well to study.&quot;

Meynell&#x27;s work has continued to be praised and studied in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, with contemporary scholars including Angela Leighton and Linda Austin having published articles on Meynell and her work.

== Activism ==
At the end of the 19th century, in conjunction with uprisings against the British (among them the Indians&#x27;, the Zulus&#x27;, the Boxer Rebellion, and the Muslim revolt led by Muhammad Ahmed in the Sudan), many European scholars, writers, and artists, began to question Europe&#x27;s colonial imperialism. This led the Meynells and others in their circle to speak out for the oppressed. Alice Meynell was a vice-president of the Women Writers&#x27; Suffrage League, founded by Cicely Hamilton and active 1908–19.

Meynell was one of the early founders of the Catholic women&#x27;s organisation, Catholic Women&#x27;s Suffrage Society in support of peaceful means for the achievement of equal suffrage rights for women. Meynell established and wrote in the first edition of its newspaper &quot;The Catholic Suffragist,&quot; in 1915, that &#x27;a Catholic suffragist woman is a graver suffragist on graver grounds and with weightier reasons than any other suffragist in England (sic)&#x27;... Surely England has endured too long what is not only immodest but profoundly immoral, reports were shared from eleven branches (including a national congress in Wales and two societies in Scotland) and the editorial said &#x27;We dare to say that if the balance of power between men and women had been more equal the world over, we should not still be settling international disputes by swamping a continent in blood and turning Europe into a shambles.

Meynell wrote in &quot;The Tablet&quot; against Father Henry Day who preached against votes for women risking &#x27;bringing a revolution of the first magnitude&#x27;. Meynell retorted &#x27;I say, most gravely, the vaster the magnitude of the revolution, the better.&#x27; Where Day saw &#x27;danger&#x27; Meynell saw a &#x27;fortress of safety&#x27; for Catholic women, and she saw anti-suffrage rhetoric as &#x27;insolence&#x27;.

==Death and legacy==

Meynell was twice considered for the Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom, on the 1892 death of Alfred, Lord Tennyson and in 1913 to replace Alfred Austin. Elizabeth Barrett Browning, her third cousin, was the only other female potential laureate up to that time. Neither of these women were given the recognition of this status with the first and only female to hold the post, appointed by the monarch, being Carol Ann Duffy in 2009 -19.

After a series of illnesses, including migraine and depression, Meynell died on 27 November 1922 aged 75. A posthumous collection of her &quot;Last Poems&quot; was published by Burns and Oates, a year later. Meynell is buried at Kensal Green Catholic Cemetery in London. There is a London County Council commemorative blue plaque on the front wall of the property at 47 Palace Court, Bayswater, London, W2, where she and her husband once lived, whilst the 2023 play &quot;Modest&quot; covered Alice and her sister Elizabeth&#x27;s life from 1874 to 1879.

Upon Meynell&#x27;s death, Jeannette Marks wrote, &quot;Like a child my mind has kept step with hers for many years, and like a child it still runs beside her, looking up, using her living words, following her thought. In the &#x27;running&#x27; I have lost account of time; and now, they say, she is dead...&quot;Tribulation, Immortality, the Multitude!&quot;&quot;

<doc id="1029326" wikidata="Q1159714" url="?curid=1029326" title="Dani people">
<text>The Dani (also spelled Ndani) are an ethnic group from the Central Highlands of Western New Guinea in Baliem Valley, Highland Papua, Indonesia. Around 100,000 people live in the Baliem Valley, consisting of representatives of the Dani tribes in the lower and upper parts of the valley each 20,000 and 50,000 in the middle part (with a total of 90,000 people). The areas west of the Baliem Valley are inhabited by approx 180,000, representatives of the Lani people, incorrectly called &quot;Western Dani&quot;. All inhabitants of Baliem Valley and the surrounding areas are often called &quot;Dani&quot; hence they are also sometimes conflated with other highland tribes such as Lani in the west; Walak in the north; Nduga, Mek, and Yali in the south and east.

They are one of the most populous tribes in the highlands and are found spread out through the highlands. The Dani are one of the best-known ethnic groups in Papua, due to the relatively numerous tourists who visit the Baliem Valley area where they predominate. &quot;Ndani&quot; meaning &#x27;people of the east&#x27; is the name given to the Lani living east of the Moni, at the time misunderstood to refer to all inhabitants of the Baliem Valley, and while they call themselves &quot;Hubula&quot; (or &quot;Huwulra, Hugula, Hubla&quot;), they have been known as Dani since the 1926 Smithsonian Institution-Dutch Colonial Government expedition to New Guinea under Matthew Stirling who visited the Moni.

==Language==
Linguists identify at least four sub-groupings of Dani languages or Baliem Valley languages:
*Wano language 
*Nggem language 
*Central Dani
**Grand Valley Dani:
*** Lower-Grand Valley Dani (20,000 speakers) and Hupla language
*** Mid-Grand Valley Dani (50,000 speakers)
*** Upper-Grand Valley Dani (20,000 speakers)
** Lani or Western Dani (180,000 speakers) and Walak language
* Ngalik language: 
**Nduga
**Silimo
**Yali (dialect cluster)

The Dani languages differentiate only two basic colours, &quot;mili&quot; for cool/dark shades such as blue, green, and black, and &quot;mola&quot; for warm/light colours such as red, yellow, and white. This trait makes it an interesting field of research for language psychologists, e.g. Eleanor Rosch, eager to know whether there is a link between the way of thought and language.

==First contact with Europeans==
A small fringe group of the Dani (technically Nduga), living south of Puncak Trikora and presenting themselves as the Pesegem and the Horip tribes, were met on 29 October 1909, by the Second South New Guinea Expedition led by Hendrikus Albertus Lorentz, who stayed several nights in their village. First contact with the populous Western Dani (Lani) was made in October 1920 during the Central New Guinea Expedition, in which a group of explorers stayed for six months with them at their farms in the upper Swart River Valley (now &quot;Toli Valley&quot;, Tolikara Regency). The Grand Valley was only sighted on 23 June 1938 from a PBY Catalina by Richard Archbold, who stumbled upon the valley while studying high-altitude vegetation in the Jayawijaya Mountains.

The first white people to live among the Dani (Lani) of in Tolikara were John and Helen Dekker, under whose ministry the Christian population among the Dani grew to 13,000.

==Culture==
Sweet potatoes are important in their local culture, being the most important tool used in bartering, especially in dowries. Likewise, pig feasts are extremely important to celebrate events communally; the success of a feast, and that of a village big man (man of influence) or organiser, is often gauged by the number of pigs slaughtered.

The Dani use an earth oven method (called &quot;bakar batu&quot; or &quot;barapen&quot;) to cook pigs and their staple crops such as sweet potato, banana, and cassava. They heat stones in a fire until they are extremely hot, and line a pit with some of them. Cuts of meat and pieces of sweet potato or banana are wrapped in banana leaves, the food packages are lowered into the pit, more hot stones are placed on top, and the pit is covered with grass and a cover to keep steam in. After a couple of hours, the food is ready to eat. Pigs are too valuable to be served regularly and are reserved for special occasions only.
Ritual small-scale warfare between rival villages was an integral part of traditional Dani culture, with much time spent preparing weapons and treating resulting injuries. In 1966, there was a massacre in which 125 people were killed in an attack by an enemy clan. Typically the emphasis in battle is to insult the enemy and wound or kill token victims, as opposed to capturing territory or property or vanquishing the enemy village. Such fighting is no longer done.

== Ethnographic studies ==
In 1961, as a member of the Harvard-Peabody study, filmmaker Robert Gardner began recording the Dani of the Baliem River Valley, specifically in Kurulu District and Wita Waya District, Jayawijaya Regency. In 1965, he created the film &quot;Dead Birds&quot; from this experience. Gardner emphasizes the themes of death and people-as-birds in Dani culture. &quot;Dead birds&quot; or &quot;dead men&quot; are terms the Dani use for the weapons and ornaments taken from the enemy during battle (&quot;wim&quot;). These trophies are displayed during the two-day dance of victory (&quot;edai&quot;) after an enemy is killed.

<doc id="1029329" wikidata="Q267481" url="?curid=1029329" title="Laurence Oliphant (author)">
<text>Laurence Oliphant (3 August 1829 – 23 December 1888), a Member of Parliament, was a South African-born British author, traveller, diplomat, British intelligence agent, Christian mystic, and Christian Zionist. His best known book in his lifetime was a satirical novel, &quot;Piccadilly&quot; (1870). More heed has gone since to his plan for Jewish farming communities in the Holy Land, &quot;The Land of Gilead&quot;. Oliphant was a UK Member of Parliament for Stirling Burghs.

==Early life==
Laurence Oliphant was born in Cape Town, Cape Colony, the only child of Sir Anthony Oliphant (1793–1859), a member of the Scottish landed gentry, and his wife Maria. At the time of his son&#x27;s birth Sir Anthony was Attorney General of the Cape Colony, but he was soon appointed Chief Justice in Ceylon. Laurence spent his early childhood in Colombo, where his father purchased a home called Alcove in Captains Gardens, subsequently known as Maha Nuge Gardens. Sir Anthony and his son have been credited with bringing tea to Ceylon and growing 30 tea plants brought over from China on the Oliphant Estate in Nuwara Eliya. In 1848 and 1849, he and his parents toured Europe. In 1851, he accompanied Jung Bahadur from Colombo to Nepal, which provided the material for his first book, &quot;A Journey to Katmandu&quot; (1852).
Oliphant returned to Ceylon and from there went to England to study law. Oliphant left his legal studies to travel in Russia. The outcome of that tour was his book &quot;The Russian Shores of the Black Sea&quot; (1853).

Oliphant&#x27;s parents were Christian Zionists.

==Diplomatic and utopian pursuits==
Between 1853 and 1861 Oliphant was secretary to Lord Elgin during the negotiation of the Canada Reciprocity Treaty in Washington, and companion to the Duke of Newcastle on a visit to the Circassian coast during the Crimean War.

In 1861, Oliphant was appointed First Secretary of the British Legation in Japan under Minister Plenipotentiary (later Sir) Rutherford Alcock. He arrived in Edo at the end of June, but on the evening of 5 July, a night-time attack was made on the legation by xenophobic ronin. His pistols having been locked in their travelling box, Oliphant rushed out with a hunting whip, and was attacked by a ronin with a heavy two-handed sword. A beam, invisible in the darkness, interfered with the blows, but Oliphant was severely wounded and sent on board ship to recover. He had to return to England after a visit to Tsushima Island, where he discovered a Russian force occupying a secluded bay and obtained its withdrawal. The attack on the legation left him with permanent damage to one of his hands.

He was sent to Poland in 1863 as a British observer to report on the January Uprising.

Oliphant returned to England, resigned from the Diplomatic Service and was elected to Parliament in 1865 for Stirling Burghs. While he did not show any conspicuous parliamentary ability, he was made a great success by his novel &quot;Piccadilly: A Fragment of Contemporary Biography&quot; (1870). Oliphant&#x27;s later novels include &quot;Altiora Peto&quot; (1883) and &quot;Masollam: A Problem of the Period&quot; (1886).

He then became connected to the spiritualist prophet Thomas Lake Harris, who, in about 1861, had organised a small Christian utopian community, the Brotherhood of the New Life, which was settled in Brocton, New York, on Lake Erie, and he subsequently moved to Santa Rosa, California.

After initially being refused permission to join Harris in 1867, he was eventually allowed to join his community, and Oliphant caused a scandal by leaving Parliament in 1868 to follow Harris to Brocton. He lived there for several years engaged in what Harris termed the &#x27;Use&#x27;, manual labour aimed at forwarding his utopian vision. Members of the community were allowed to return to the outside world from time to time to earn money for the community. After three years, Oliphant worked as correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot; during the Franco-German War, and afterwards spent several years in Paris in the service of the paper. There he met, through his mother, his future wife, Alice le Strange. They married at St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square, London, on 8 June 1872. In 1873, Oliphant went back to Brocton with his wife and mother.

Later, he and his mother had a falling out with Harris and demanded their money back, which had allegedly been derived mainly from the sale of Lady Maris Oliphant&#x27;s jewels. That forced Harris to sell the Brocton colony, and his remaining disciples moved to their new colony in Santa Rosa, California.

In 1876 Oliphant returned to England while his wife, Alice, chose to remain with the Brotherhood of the New Life in Brocton.

By 1878 Oliphant, caught up in a wave of Western concern that Russia intended to conquer the Middle East, devised a &quot;Plan for Gilead&quot; under which Britain would plant a Jewish agricultural colony &quot;in the northern and more fertile half of Palestine&quot; and enlisted the approval of Prime Minister Disraeli, a supporter of Zionism; Foreign Minister Salisbury, the Prince of Wales; and the novelist George Eliot. Oliphant, credentialed by the British government, set sail in 1879 to investigate conditions for establishing a Jewish agricultural settlement in Palestine. Oliphant would later come to see Jewish agricultural settlements as a means of alleviating Jewish suffering in Eastern Europe.

In May 1879, Oliphant was in Istanbul in the Ottoman Empire, petitioning the Sublime Porte for permission to establish a Jewish agricultural colony in the Holy Land and settling large numbers of Jews there (this was prior to the first wave of Jewish settlement by Zionists in 1882). He did not see it as an impossible task in view of the large numbers of Christian believers in the United States and England who supported that plan. With financial support from Christadelphians and others in Britain, Oliphant amassed sufficient funding to purchase land and settle Jewish refugees in the Galilee.

While awaiting an appointment with the Sublime Porte, Oliphant traveled to Romania to discuss his proposed agricultural settlements with the Jewish communities there.

The long-awaited meeting with the Sublime Porte finally took place in April 1880, and Oliphant&#x27;s plan was dismissed. In the opinion of Henry Layard, British Ambassador to the Sublime Porte at the time of Oliphant&#x27;s visit, the effort failed because Oliphant spoke about how the return of the Jews to Palestine would bring the second coming of Jesus – language and ideas that the Sultan found uncongenial.

When a wave of pogroms swept the Russian Empire in 1881, most notably the Kiev pogrom, charitable funds were raised in London under the aegis of the Mansion House Committee, a group created for the purpose. When the committee announced that the funds would be used to help the Jewish refugees resettle in America, Oliphant published an article in The Times on February 15, 1881, asserting that Jews who chose to settle in Palestine would have their religion safeguarded; his article met with such enthusiasm among Polish and Russian Jews that the Mansion House Committee appointed him commissioner to Galicia. Oliphant and his wife, Alice, who had reunited in 1882, traveled to Vienna and Galicia, meeting with representatives of Eastern Jews and promising that &quot;as soon as your Christian sympathizers in England are convinced the Jews fleeing from Russia can settle with safety in the land of their ancestors, then they will contribute thousands, I may well say, hundreds of thousands of pounds to promote this great object.&quot;

Oliphant had by this point become something of a celebrity among Jews in Eastern Europe. He was spoken of as &quot;another Cyrus&quot; and a &quot;saviour&quot;. His settlement plans were published by the early Zionist newspaper Hamagid, written up by Peretz Smolenskin in &quot;Ha-Shaḥar&quot;, and Moses Lilienblum expressed the hope that Oliphant would be &quot;the Messiah for Israel.&quot; According to historian Nathan Michael Gelber, &quot;you could find in the houses of poor Jews a picture of Oliphant. It would be hung right next to the pictures of the great philanthropists Moses Montefiore and Baron Hirsch.&quot;

Despite the fact that the Sublime Porte had given no permission for the building of Jewish agricultural settlements, in May 1882 the Oliphants began a journey to Palestine, traveling through Budapest to Moldave, where they paused to meet Rabbi Avrohom Yaakov Friedman whom Oliphant understood to be &quot;the leader of world Jewry&quot;, hoping to persuade him to raise sufficient funds to purchase Palestine from the Ottoman Emperor.

The Oliphants settled in Palestine, dividing their time between a house in the German Colony in Haifa, and another in the Druze village of Daliyat al-Karmel on Mount Carmel. Oliphant&#x27;s secretary Naftali Herz Imber, author of the Israeli national anthem, Hatikva, lived with them. In the Holy Land, they were in touch with the Jewish pioneers of the First Aliyah, donating 1,000 roubles to the founding settlers of Yesud HaMa&#x27;ala. He is regarded as having been &quot;central&quot; to &quot;the establishment and survival&quot; of Rosh Pinna and Zikhron Ya&#x27;akov.

==Esoteric writings==
Laurence and his wife Alice collaborated on a work of esoteric Christianity, which was published in 1885 as &quot;Sympneumata, or Evolutionary Forces Now Active in Man&quot;. Influenced by the American mystic Thomas Lake Harris as well as spiritualists Anna Kingsford and Edward Maitland, &quot;Sympneumata&quot; is founded on an interpretation of the Fall whereby the human soul was originally androgynous but became divided into male and female counterparts upon being encased in physical bodies. In &quot;Sympneumata&quot; the Oliphants emphasise the need to locate ones physical and spiritual counterparts through a breathing practice, with the aim of unlocking the androgyne within through &#x27;vibratory&#x27; motion.

In December 1885, Alice became ill and died on 2 January 1886. Oliphant, also stricken, was too weak to attend her funeral. Oliphant was persuaded that after Alice&#x27;s death he was in much closer contact with her than when she was still alive, and believed that she inspired him to write &quot;Scientific Religion: Or, Higher Possibilities of Life and Practice Through the Operation of Natural Forces&quot;, which was published in November 1887.

==Final years==
In 1888, Oliphant traveled to the United States and married his second wife, Rosamond, a granddaughter of Robert Owen in Malvern. The couple planned to return to Haifa, but Oliphant took sick at York House, Twickenham, England, and died there on 23 December 1888. His obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; said of him, &quot;Seldom has there been a more romantic or amply filled career; never, perhaps, a stranger or more apparently contradictory personality.&quot;

==Legacy==
In 2000 Alice Oliphant&#x27;s watercolours showing Haifa as it was in the late 19th century were shown in a special exhibition entitled &quot;The Drawing Room of Lady Oliphant&quot; at the Israeli National Maritime Museum. Paintings by Alice&#x27;s sister, Jamesina Waller made during her visit to the Holy Land were also on display. The &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot;&#x27;s art critic, Angela Levine, deemed Lady Alice&#x27;s watercolours, &quot;charming but amateurish.&quot;

In 2003, Ticho House in Jerusalem mounted an exhibit of the Holy Land paintings of Alice Oliphant and her sister Jesamine Waller.

==Books==
*&quot;A Journey to Kathmandu (the Capital of Napaul), with The Camp of Jung Bahadoor; including A Sketch of the Nepaulese Ambassador at Home &quot; is a travelogue written in 1852. The book describes the cultural condition of Nepal, however the book is not considered of scientific value. Oliphant then a 21-year-old son of colonial of Colombo joined the team of Jang Bahadur Rana who was returning to Nepal from England with his two younger brothers, Jagat Shamsher and Dhir Shamsher. The team had a stop at Ceylon in December 1850 from where Oliphant accompanied. The book is under public domain since 6 Jul 2005.

<text>Adolf Lindenbaum (12 June 1904 – August 1941) was a Polish-Jewish logician and mathematician best known for Lindenbaum&#x27;s lemma and Lindenbaum–Tarski algebras.

== Life ==
He was born and brought up in Warsaw. He earned a Ph.D. in 1928 under Wacław Sierpiński and habilitated at the University of Warsaw in 1934. He published works on mathematical logic, set theory, cardinal and ordinal arithmetic, the axiom of choice, the continuum hypothesis, theory of functions, measure theory, point-set topology, geometry and real analysis. He served as an assistant professor at the University of Warsaw from 1935 until the outbreak of war in September 1939. He was Alfred Tarski&#x27;s closest collaborator of the inter-war period. Around the end of October or beginning of November 1935 he married Janina Hosiasson, a fellow logician of the Lwow–Warsaw school. He and his wife were adherents of logical empiricism, participated in and contributed to the international unity of science movement, and were members of the original Vienna Circle. Sometime before the middle of August 1941 he and his sister Stefanja were shot to death in Naujoji Vilnia (Nowa Wilejka), 7 km east of Vilnius, by the occupying German forces or Lithuanian collaborators.

<doc id="1029333" wikidata="Q5044865" url="?curid=1029333" title="Carolina Nairne">
<text>Carolina Oliphant, Lady Nairne (16 August 1766 – 26 October 1845) – also known as Carolina Baroness Nairn in the peerage of Scotland and Baroness Keith in that of the United Kingdom – was a Scottish songwriter.
Many of her songs, such as, &quot;Will ye no&#x27; come back again?&quot;, &quot;Charlie is my Darling&quot; , &quot;The Rowan Tree&quot; and &quot;Wi&#x27; a Hundred Pipers&#x27; remain popular today, almost two hundred years after they were written. One of her songs, &quot;Caller Herrin&#x27;&quot;, was sung at the 2021 commemoration of the 1881 Eyemouth disaster. She usually set her words to traditional Scottish folk melodies, but sometimes contributed her own music.

Carolina Nairne and her contemporary Robert Burns were influenced by the Jacobite heritage in their establishment of a distinct Scottish identity, through what they both called national song. Perhaps in the belief that her work would not be taken seriously if it were known that she was a woman, Nairne went to considerable lengths to conceal her identity (even from her husband) when submitting her work for publication. Early on she called herself Mrs Bogan of Bogan, but feeling that gave too much away she often attributed her songs to the gender-neutral B.B., S.M., or &quot;Unknown&quot;.

Although both working in the same genre of what might today be called traditional Scottish folksongs, Nairne and Burns display rather different attitudes in their compositions. Nairne tends to focus on an earlier romanticised version of the Scottish way of life, tinged with sadness for what is gone forever, whereas Burns displays an optimism about a better future to come.

==Life and antecedents==

Carolina Oliphant was born at the Auld Hoose, Gask, Perthshire (her father&#x27;s ancestral family home) on 16 August 1766. She was the fourth child of the three sons and four daughters of Laurence Oliphant (1724–1792), laird of Gask, and his wife Margaret Robertson (1739–1774); her mother was the eldest daughter of Duncan Robertson of Struan, the chief of Clan Donnachie, which fought on the Jacobite side in the uprisings of 1715 and &#x27;45. Her father was also a staunch Jacobite, and she was given the name Carolina in memory of Prince Charles Edward Stuart.

Following the failure of the Jacobite rising of 1745 the Oliphant family – along with the Robertsons and the Nairnes – was accused of high treason, exiled to France, and their estates seized. The exiles remained in France for nineteen years, during which time Carolina&#x27;s parents were married at Versailles, in 1755. The government eventually allowed the family&#x27;s kinsmen to buy back part of the Gask estate, and the couple returned to Scotland two years before Carolina&#x27;s birth. Her parents were cousins, both grandchildren of Lord Nairne, who had commanded the second line of the Jacobite army at the Battle of Prestonpans in 1745. Although he was sentenced to death the following year, he managed to escape to France, where he remained in exile until his death in 1770.

The upbringing of Carolina and her siblings reflected their father&#x27;s Jacobite allegiance, and their everyday lives were filled with reminders that he considered the Stewarts to be the rightful heirs to the throne. A governess was employed to ensure that the girls had a &#x27;full education including music and art&#x27;, and that they did not speak in a broad Scots dialect, as their father considered it unladylike. General tuition was provided by a local minister – the children&#x27;s prayer books had the Hanoverian sovereign&#x27;s names obscured by those of the Stewarts – and music and dance teachers were also engaged. Delicate as a child, Carolina gradually developed into a genteel young woman, much admired by fashionable families; she was well educated, able to paint and an accomplished musician familiar with traditional songs.

As a teenager, Carolina was betrothed to William Murray Nairne, another of Lord Nairne&#x27;s grandchildren, who became the 5th Lord Nairne in 1824. Born in Ireland to a Jacobite family from Perthshire whose lands had also been forfeited, he regularly visited Gask. It was only after he was promoted to the position of assistant inspector-general at a Scottish barracks that the pair were married on 2 June 1806. The couple settled in Edinburgh, where their only son, also named William Murray Nairne (1808–1837), was born two years later. He was a sickly child and, following her husband&#x27;s death in 1830, Lady Nairne lived with her son in Ireland and on the continent. The change in climate was not as beneficial to his health as had been hoped; he died in Brussels in December 1837. Nairne returned to Gask in 1843, but following a stroke her health deteriorated; she died on 26 October 1845 and was buried in the family chapel.

==Songwriting==

Nairne began writing songs shortly after her father&#x27;s death in 1792. She was a contemporary of the best-known Scottish songwriter and poet Robert Burns. Although the two never met, together they forged a national song for Scotland, that in the words of Dianne Dugaw, Professor of English and Folklore at the University of Oregon, &quot;lies somewhere between folk-song and art-song.&quot; For both, Jacobite history was a powerful influence. Nairne could read music and played the harpsichord, which allowed her to contribute some of her own tunes. Three tunes she almost certainly wrote are those to &quot;Will Ye No Come Back Again&quot;, &quot;The Rowan Tree&quot;, and &quot;The Auld House&quot;, as no earlier printed versions have been found.

What was probably her first composition – &quot;The Pleughman&quot; (ploughman) – may have been a tribute to Burns. Just like him, Nairne&#x27;s songs were at first circulated by being performed, but her interest in Scottish music and song brought her into contact with Robert Purdie, an Edinburgh publisher. Purdie was gathering together &quot;a collection of the national airs, with words suited for refined circles&quot; to which Nairne contributed a significant number of original songs, all without attribution to her. The collection was published in six volumes as &quot;The Scottish Minstrel&quot; from 1821 to 1824, with music edited by Robert Archibald Smith.

The bulk of Nairne&#x27;s more than 80 songs have Jacobitism as their backdrop, perhaps unsurprising given her family background and upbringing. Examples of the best known of such works include &quot;Wha&#x27;ll be King but Charlie?&quot; &quot;Charlie is my darling&quot;, &quot;The Hundred Pipers&quot;, &quot;He&#x27;s owre the Hills&quot;, and &quot;Will ye no&#x27; come back again?&quot;. In part she wrote such songs as a tribute to the mid-18th century struggles of her parents and grandparents, but the Jacobite influence in her work runs deep. In &quot;The Laird o&#x27; Cockpen&quot;, for instance, Nairne echoes the Jacobite distaste for the Whiggish displays and manners of the nouveau riche in post-Union Scotland, as does the evocative &quot;Caller Herrin&#x27;&quot;.

Most of Nairne&#x27;s songs were written before her marriage in 1806. She completed her last – &quot;Would Ye Be Young Again?&quot; – at the age of 75, adding a note in the manuscript that perhaps reveals much of her attitude to life: &quot;The thirst of the dying wretch in the desert is nothing to the pining for voices which have ceased forever!&quot; Indeed, her songs often focus on grief, on what can be no more, and romanticise a traditional way of Scottish life. Her contemporary Burns, on the other hand, had an eye on a global future – &quot;a brotherhood of working people &#x27;the warld o&#x27;er&#x27; that&#x27;s &#x27;comin yet.

==Anonymity==
Nairne concealed her achievements as a songwriter throughout her life; they only became public on the posthumous publication of &quot;Lays from Strathearn&quot; (1846). She took pleasure in the popularity of her songs, and may have been concerned that this could be jeopardised if it became public knowledge that she was a woman. It also explains why she soon switched from Mrs Bogan of Bogan to the gender-neutral BB when submitting her contributions to &quot;The Scottish Minstrel&quot;, and even disguised her handwriting. On one occasion, pressed by her publisher Purdie who wanted to meet his best contributor, she appeared disguised as an elderly gentlewoman from the country. She succeeded in persuading Purdie that she was merely a conduit for the songs she gathered from simple countryfolk, and not their author. But the entire editorial committee of the &quot;Minstrel&quot; – all of them female – was aware of her identity for instance, as were her sister, nieces and grandniece. On the other hand, she shared her secret with very few men, not even her husband; as she wrote to a friend in the 1820s &quot;I have not told even Nairne lest he blab&quot;.

Consideration for her husband may have been another of Nairne&#x27;s motives for maintaining her anonymity. Despite his Jacobite family background he had served with the British Army since his youth, and it might have caused him some professional embarrassment if it had become widely known that his wife was writing songs in honour of the Jacobite rebels of the previous century. Somewhat testifying against that view however is that she maintained her secrecy for fifteen years after his death.

==Recognition==
The name Nairne was adopted for a crater on the planet Mercury by the International Astronomical Union in 2022.

<doc id="1029351" wikidata="Q4659903" url="?curid=1029351" title="A Summons to Memphis">
<text>A Summons to Memphis is a 1986 novel by Peter Taylor that won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1987. It is the recollection of Phillip Carver, a middle aged editor from New York City, who is summoned back to Memphis by his two conniving unmarried sisters to help them prevent the marriage of their elderly father to a younger woman.

==Plot summary==

As the story unfolds, Phillip reflects on the major incidents in the life of his once well-to-do family, which was forced to leave Nashville during the time of the Great Depression after the older Mr. Carver, a distinguished lawyer, lost a great deal of money in failed investments with his then-friend and business associate Lewis Shackleford. Though this happened when the four Carver children were still in their teens, they recall the event as a great betrayal, and the resulting move had a major impact on them and continues to affect their abilities to build stable relationships and function as adults. Their lives were further dominated by their father as he ended romantic relationships for his children if he disapproved of them for any reason.

Ultimately, the oldest Carver son joined the army and died in World War II. Neither Phillip nor his sisters ever married. His sisters maintain an odd continued adolescence well into their fifties, dressing as though they were still attractive teenagers. Phillip moves to New York and lives with a younger woman whom he will never marry. The &quot;summons&quot; to Memphis in the book&#x27;s title refers to several events, but chiefly a call by Phillip&#x27;s sisters to return and help them block their then-octogenarian father from remarrying after the death of their mother.

The book is a rumination on the responsibilities of parents, friendships between men, the relationship between the &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; south, the nature of revenge and the possibility of forgiveness.

==Awards and nominations==
* Won Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1987. 
* Finalist for National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction in 1986.

<text>The Cuala Press was an Irish private press set up in 1908 by Elizabeth Yeats with support from her brother William Butler Yeats that played an important role in the Celtic Revival of the early 20th century. Originally Dun Emer Press, from 1908 until the late 1940s it functioned as Cuala Press, publicising the works of such writers as Yeats, Lady Gregory, Colum, Synge, and Gogarty.

==Origins==
At the suggestion of Emery Walker, Elizabeth Yeats trained as a printer at the Women&#x27;s Printing Society in London. In 1902, Elizabeth Yeats and her sister Lily joined their friend Evelyn Gleeson in the establishment of a craft studio near Dublin which they named Dun Emer. Dun Emer became a focus of the burgeoning Irish Arts and Crafts Movement, specialising in printing, embroidery, and rug and tapestry-making. Elizabeth ran the printing operation, and Lily managed the needlework department.

In 1904, the operation was reorganised into two parts, the Dun Emer Guild run by Gleeson and Dun Emer Industries under the direction of the Yeats sisters, and in 1908 the groups separated completely. Gleeson retained the Dun Emer name, and the Yeats sisters established Cuala Industries at nearby Churchtown, which ran the Cuala Press and an embroidery workshop. The sisters&#x27; cousin Ruth Pollexfen served as an apprentice to Lily and gave embroidery lessons at the workshop. Cuala (or Cualu) was the name of the Gaelic territory covering south Dublin before the Norman conquest of Ireland.

==Operations==
It was intended that the new press would produce work by writers associated with the Irish Literary Revival. They ended up publishing over 70 titles in total, including 48 by W. B. Yeats. The press closed in 1946.

The Cuala was unusual in that it was the only Arts and Crafts press to be run and staffed by women and the only one that published new work rather than established classics. In addition to Yeats, Cuala published works by Ezra Pound, Jack B. Yeats, Padraic Colum, Robin Flower, Elizabeth Bowen, Oliver St John Gogarty, Lady Gregory, Douglas Hyde, Lionel Johnson, Patrick Kavanagh, Louis MacNeice, John Masefield, Frank O&#x27;Connor, John Millington Synge, John Butler Yeats, Rabindranath Tagore and others.

After Elizabeth Yeats died in 1940, the work of the press was carried on by two of her long-time assistants, Esther Ryan and Mollie Gill under the management of Georgie Hyde-Lees. The final Cuala title was &quot;Stranger in Aran&quot; by Elizabeth Rivers, which was published on 31 July 1946.

In 1969 the press was taken up by W. B. Yeats&#x27; children, Michael and Anne Yeats, with Liam Miller. Some titles were run in the 1970s, and archives are still held by the press.

<doc id="1029359" wikidata="Q140811" url="?curid=1029359" title="Net D">
<text>Net 10, net 15, net 30 and net 60 (often hyphenated &quot;net-&quot; and/or followed by &quot;days&quot;, e.g., &quot;net 10 days&quot;) are payment terms for trade credit, which specify that the net amount (the total outstanding on the invoice) is expected to be paid in full by the buyer within 10, 15, 30 or 60 days of the date when the goods are dispatched or the service is completed. Net 30 or net 60 terms are often coupled with a credit for early payment.

The word &quot;net&quot; in this sense means &quot;total after all discounts&quot;. It originally derives from the Latin &quot;nitere&quot; (to shine) and &quot;nitidus&quot; (elegant, trim), and more recently from the French &quot;net&quot; (sharp, neat, clean).

==Examples==
* The notation &quot;net 30&quot; indicates that full payment is expected within 30 days. If a $1000 invoice has the terms &quot;net 30&quot;, the buyer must pay the full $1000 within 30 days.
* The notation &quot;2% 10, net 30&quot; indicates that a 2% discount can be taken by the buyer only if payment is received in full within 10 days of the date of the invoice, and that full payment is expected within 30 days, For example, if a $1000 invoice has the terms, &quot;2% 10, net 30&quot;, the buyer can take a 2% discount ($1000 x .02 = $20) and make a payment of $980 within 10 days or pay the full $1000 within 30 days.

==Usage==
Net 30 is a term that most business and municipalities (federal, state, and local) use in the United States. Net 10 and net 15 are widely used as well, especially for contractors and service-oriented businesses (as opposed to those that deal with tangible goods). Net 60 is not used as frequently due to its longer payment term.

Legally speaking, net 30 means that buyer will pay seller in full on or before the 30th calendar day (including weekends and holidays) of when the goods were dispatched by the seller or the services were fully provided. Transit time is included when counting the days, i.e. a purchase in transit for 7 days before receipt has just 23 additional days until payment is due to the seller. Net 30 payment terms typically have an interest penalty for not meeting these terms and they begin accruing on the 31st day after dispatch. The same happens with net 60, but 60 days are given for payment, interest penalties begin on the 61st day and thus a purchase in transit for 7 days has now 53 days until payment is due to the seller.

In certain markets such as the United Kingdom, a construction such as &quot;net 30, end of the month&quot; or &quot;Net Monthly Account&quot; indicates that payment in full is expected by the end of the month following the month of the invoice.

<text>The Dun Emer Press (&quot;fl.&quot; 1902–1908) was an Irish private press founded in 1902 by Evelyn Gleeson, Elizabeth Yeats and her brother William Butler Yeats, part of the Celtic Revival. It was named after the legendary Emer and evolved into the Cuala Press.

==History==
In 1902, Elizabeth and her sister Lily Yeats joined Evelyn Gleeson in establishing a craft studio at Dundrum, near Dublin, called Dun Emer. This specialized in printing and other crafts, with Elizabeth Yeats in charge of the printing press. While living in London, Elizabeth Yeats had been part of the circle of William Morris, and had been inspired by his printing work. Gleeson offered the Yeats sisters her large house in Dundrum, in which a crafts group providing training and work for young women, in the fields of bookbinding, printing, weaving, and embroidery, could live and work. Bookbinding workshops were a later addition to the studio. The sisters&#x27; cousin Ruth Pollexfen served as Lily&#x27;s apprentice in the embroidery section.

The Dun Emer studio and press were named after Emer, daughter of Forgall Monach, wife of the hero Cúchulainn in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology, a figure famous for her artistic skills as well as her beauty. The title-page device of the Dun Emer Press was designed by Elinor Monsell and shows Emer standing underneath a tree. Monsell also created the symbol of the Abbey Theatre, Dublin, which depicts Maeve with a wolfhound. The focus of the Press was on publishing literary work by Irish authors, and Elizabeth and Lily Yeats&#x27;s younger brother, the artist Jack Butler Yeats, did much of the illustration work.

In 1904, the Dun Emer crafts studio was organized into two parts, the Dun Emer Guild under Gleeson and Dun Emer Industries under the Yeats sisters.

The Dun Emer Press produced limited editions of books, printed by hand in the manner of William Morris&#x27;s Kelmscott Press. The texts it published were written or selected by W. B. Yeats, who was the press&#x27;s literary editor and who also subsidized its operations, which lacked profitability. In its prospectus issued early in 1903, the press boasted of &quot;a good eighteenth century fount of type&quot; and &quot;paper made of linen rags and without bleaching chemicals&quot;.

As well as books, the Press also printed broadsheets designed by Jack Yeats, and hand-coloured greeting cards. In 1908, after the Press had produced eleven literary titles, the different elements of the Dun Emer studio separated completely, with Gleeson retaining the Dun Emer name. The Yeats sisters left Dundrum and took the new name Cuala for their operations, Elizabeth establishing the Cuala Press at Churchtown, Dublin.

<text>The Palace on Wheels is India&#x27;s first luxury tourist train launched by the Indian Railways in joint collaboration with Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation (RTDC) to promote tourism in Rajasthan. The train was launched in 1982. The train has been renamed as Heritage Palace on Wheels.

The train service was renovated and relaunched in August 2009 with a new decor, itinerary and cuisine.

==History==
The concept of the &quot;Palace on Wheels&quot; was derived from the royal background of the coaches, which were originally meant to be the personal railway coaches of the erstwhile rulers of the princely states of Rajputana, Baroda, the Nizam of Hyderabad and mainly the Governor-General of India.

Due to changes in the rail gauges over the years, after the launch of the first train in 1982, the second train was built in 1991 and the third train was built in 1995.

The train halted operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. It resumed operations in 2022 and was flagged off by Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot at Gandhinagar Railway Station on 8 October 2022. The Chief Minister announced that modern furnishings and additional amenities have been added to the train and the government has accorded an industry status to the sector while setting aside ₹1,000 crore in the 2022-23 budget to promote tourism. Before the stop in operations due to the pandemic, the train ran continuously from 1982 to 2020.

A petition was filed by Worldwide Rail Journeys Pvt Ltd. to allow 18 foreign passengers to travel on the train while operations were halted due to the pandemic since they had deposited an amount of ₹15 lakh towards their booking. The Delhi High Court gave a judgement to allow these foreigners to board the train.

==Facilities==
The train has 14 coaches with 41 cabins and can accommodate 82 tourists. Each coach is named after former Rajput states and matches the aesthetics and interiors of the royal past: Alwar, Bharatpur, Bikaner, Bundi, Dholpur, Dungargarh, Jaisalmer, Jaipur, Jhalawar, Jodhpur, Kishangarh, Kota, Sirohi and Udaipur. Each coach has three cabins (named &quot;chambers&quot; or &quot;saloons&quot; by the company) with luxury amenities and Wi-Fi internet.
The train has two restaurants, &quot;The Mahārāja&quot; and &quot;The Mahārāni&quot;, with a Rajasthani ambience serving continental and Chinese cuisine, one bar-cum-lounge, 14 saloons and a spa.

It has on-board postal, banking and laundry services.

==Route==
The train runs from September through April and has a 7 nights &amp; 8 days itinerary. It departs from New Delhi (Day 1), and covers Jaipur (Day 2), Sawai Madhopur and Chittaurgarh (Day 3), Udaipur (Day 4), Jaisalmer (Day 5), Jodhpur (Day 6), Bharatpur and Agra (Day 7), return to New Delhi (Day 8).

<text>Józef Maria Bocheński or Innocentius Bochenski (30 August 1902 – 8 February 1995) was a Polish Dominican, logician and philosopher.

== Biography ==
Bocheński was born on 30 August 1902 in Czuszów, then part of the Russian Empire, to a family with patriotic and pro-independence traditions. His predecessors had fought in the Napoleonic wars and various national uprisings. His father, Adolf Józef Bocheński (1870–1936), who greatly developed the family estate, was a landowning activist, volunteer in the 1919-21 war with the Soviet Union and a doctor of agricultural sciences; his interest in economic history influenced Józef’s own reflections on economic doctrine and his personal aversion to Marxism. Józef’s mother, Maria Małgorzata née Dunin-Borkowska (1882–1931), was interested in theology, the author of the biographies of St John of the Cross and St Teresa of Jesus and the founder of a parish in Ponikwa. In charge of raising the children, she was known for her rigorous methods of exerting parental control and autocratic character. Józef’s father had a more liberal disposition, being primarily interested in his sons becoming good athletes and cavalrymen (he himself having had considerable sports achievements as a horse rider). Józef had three siblings: Aleksander Adolf Maria Bocheński (1904–2001), journalist and political author, economic and political activist, member of the Legislative Parliament in 1947–1952, member of the PAX Association Board in 1962–1985 as well as an activist of the Patriotic Movement for National Rebirth; Adolf Maria Bocheński (1909––1944), journalist, political author and soldier of the Polish Armed Forces in the West; and Olga Antonina, married name Zawadzka (1905–2008), teacher and author of religious education curricula, awardee of the Righteous Among the Nations medal. Józef was initially taught at home. The tutors taught the boys patriotic songs, military drills and inculcated them with a romantic perception of patriotism. Yet at the same time, they were raised in French culture, with emphasis being placed on logicality and rationalism.

In 1907, the Bocheński family moved from Czuszów in the Kielce region to Ponikwa, a property inherited by Józef’s mother, near Brody in Eastern Galicia. Life in this vast estate had a significant impact on the siblings, who had been taught to cherish the tradition of eastern borderland (&quot;Kresy&quot;) peoples. The brothers had been politicised since early childhood, and now they argued among themselves the validity Roman Dmowski’s concepts. The topic was so hotly disputed that the parents felt obliged to ban such discussions at the dinner table, all the more so because Józef was quite favourably disposed to the national camp, whereas his father regarded National Democrats to be ‘a mentality rather than a political party’.

The First World War, with several evacuations and returns to Ponikwa on account of its proximity to the frontline, led to the family’s drastic impoverishment. They witnessed soldiers’ and workers’ revolts at the time of the Bolshevik Revolution. Their numerous peregrinations also meant that Józef had to frequently change schools, from Tarnów to Warsaw (Konrad Górski School), and then to Lwów (Adam Mickiewicz Gymnasium).

As a sixteen-year-old, Józef Bocheński witnessed Polish-Ukrainian fighting in Lwów, but his parents did not allow him to participate. After graduating from high school in 1920, he volunteered to join the 8th Uhlan Regiment and saw action in the Battle of Komarów. These war experiences reaffirmed his conviction that defensive warfare was a justified means of conducting national politics. He studied law at the University of Lwów in 1920–1922, and then political economy at the University of Poznań in 1922–1926. However, he was not attracted to studying as much as to other aspects of student life. In the academic year 1924/1925, he was president of the university’s Brotherly Aid Association, and was also active in the Corona Academic Corporation as well as the Monarchist Organization, of which he was president in 1926. The views that Bocheński then espoused could be perceived as leaning towards the ideals of National Democracy – though he later reflected that in his youth for a time he considered himself to be an anarchist. In the student press, he actively condemned the May Coup and took part in anti-Piłsudski demonstrations. (His brothers, by contrast, were fervent supporters of the Marshal.)

In 1926, Józef came to the conclusion that he faced a completely wasted life. Feeling that he was no longer a Christian, a Catholic or even a person of faith, he broke his engagement with Maria Franciszka Bocheńska (his cousin) and entered a seminary. He did this to discipline his exuberant personality in an institution whose feudal, anti-democratic nature, by his own admission, he found attractive. According to Włodzimierz Sznarbachowski, a close acquaintance, that was also the intention of Józef’s autocratic mother, Maria Bocheńska, who understood well her oldest son’s character (just as she felt her youngest son should become a diplomat, and Alexander, a natural-born farmer, should be allowed to marry). Another major influence on Józef’s choice was Friar Jacek Woroniecki, who helped him to become interested in Thomism.

From 25 June 1926 to 3 July 1927, Józef was a seminarian at the Poznań Theological Seminary. There he experienced conversion and developed fascination with Christian philosophy. Joining a religious order was, in Józef’s mind, an essential consequence of his choice and after lengthy considerations of the qualities of the Jesuit, Franciscan, Dominican and Benedictine orders, he decided to join the Dominicans. He made his noviciate the Kraków Dominican monastery from October 1927 to October 1928. After making a temporary profession of vows on 4 October 1928, against his intention of becoming a missionary, he was told to take up studies in philosophy at Fribourg University, Switzerland, in 1928–1931. He was awarded a doctorate in philosophy on 31 June 1931 (for ‘an idiotic’, in his opinion, thesis on Maurycy Straszewski). In 1931–1933, he studied at the Pontifical University of St Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum) in Rome to become, on 21 March 1934, a doctor of theology (for a thesis entitled &quot;Discovering the existence of God through causality and the Catholic faith&quot;). On 20 June 1932, he was ordained to the presbyterate. In 1934–1940, he gave lectures on logic at the Angelicum in Rome. He was awarded a habilitation in Christian Philosophy at the Jagiellonian University on 14 March 1938 on the basis of a thesis entitled &quot;From the history of the logic of modal sentences&quot;. Bocheński’s understanding of the supernatural and material spheres was greatly influenced by his attachment to the logical method of thinking, which, in his opinion, inevitably led to recognising the existence of God. The view that faith, being an act of will, was not contrary, but coherent with science and logic was apparent in all his works. In the 1930s, Józef also published articles in &quot;Bunt Młodych&quot; and &quot;Polityka&quot;, magazines where his brothers Aleksander and Adolf were leading columnists. Józef’s articles primarily concerned philosophical issues, providing in this form a basis for the ‘superpower’ ideology of the two periodicals.

The outbreak of war found him engaged the construction of a religious house in Służewo. On 6 September, he left Warsaw accompanied by National Democrat acquaintances and subsequently joined the 81st Infantry Regiment, where he served as a chaplain. Taken prisoner at Kock, he soon managed to escape and – via Kraków, Katowice and Vienna – eventually reached Italy. There he was involved in helping Polish professors imprisoned by the Germans, and next he got through to Great Britain, where he carried out pastoral work among the Polish exiles and served as a Polish Army education officer. In 1943–1944, he was a lecturer at the Military Academy in Edinburgh. On 16 February 1944, Bishop Józef Gawlina appointed him army chaplain, thanks to which he joined the Polish II Corps, where he met his brother Adolf and participated in the Battle of Monte Cassino (serving on the Italian front from 27 March to 16 July 1944). On 17 August 1944, he was appointed chaplain to Polish Army Headquarters in Rome and head of the army bishop’s press office. He held this position until 15 October 1945, in that time authoring many distinctly anti-communist articles as well as serving as editor of the soldiers’ religious press.

In the autumn of that year, he started giving lectures on the history of 20th-century philosophy at the University of Fribourg, and from 1951 also on early modern history. An associate professor from 1945, he became a full professor at the university in 1948. Bocheński continued working at Fribourg until 1973, as dean of the Faculty of Philosophy in 1950-1952, and university rector in 1964-1966. In 1957, he became the director of the Eastern Europe Institute at Fribourg, from 1956 he was also a board member of Kollegium Ost in Cologne, and its director in 1961. In 1960, he received Fribourg citizenship.

Bocheński was visiting professor at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, the University of Kansas, the University of Cologne, the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Salzburg and Boston College. He was a member of the Council of the International Federation of Philosophical Societies, the founder and secretary of the World Union of Catholic Philosophical Societies as well as the president of the International Federation of Logical and Methodological Societies. He established the Polish Catholic Home in Fribourg in 1952, and also co-founded the Polish Museum Foundation in Rapperswil.

He was awarded honorary doctorates by the University of Notre Dame, USA (1966), the University of Buenos Aires (1977), the University of Milan (1981), as well as the Jagiellonian University and Academy of Theology in Warsaw (1988).

He was the promoter of several dozen doctoral dissertations and author of numerous books on what could be broadly termed philosophy and theology. The most important of these include: &quot;Szkice etyczne&quot; (1953&quot;)&quot;, &quot;Formale Logik&quot; (1956), &quot;A history of formal logic&quot; (1961), &quot;The logic of religion&quot; (1965), &quot;Sto zabobonów. Krótki filozoficzny słownik zabobonów&quot; (1987), &quot;Marksizm – leninizm. Nauka czy wiara?&quot; (1988),&quot;Współczesne metody myślenia&quot; (1992), &quot;Zarys historii filozofii&quot; (1993) and &quot;Lewicę, religię, sowietologię&quot; (1996).

Bocheński had his own reflections and theories regarding the nation, based on the concepts of Fr Woroniecki, and not limited to only the issues of language, culture or ideology, but also to the whole sphere of emotions and axiology. His views in these matters corresponded with the traditions of Polish national thought, which placed emphasis on biological, economic and cultural development as a prerequisite in the struggle for independence, which only then could be followed by the building of the actual state. Patriotism, in his opinion, should not be withdrawn, but offensive in so far as the nation’s potential permitted. In this respect, he was both a militarist and a positivist, convinced, similarly to his brother Alexander, that the Poles had to face a long and arduous education in overcoming their much accumulated shortcomings.

Bocheński criticised Marxism from the philosophical point of view as a closed system of thought, misinterpreting interpersonal relations through a false belief in the existence of a ‘scientific worldview’, which was by definition anti-Christian and especially dangerous as an instrument of Soviet imperial politics and propaganda. Hence, he fought Marxism by all possible means, for instance, by taking part in the 1950s trial of the German Communist Party by the Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe, which led to its banning. He also criticised Marxism from an economic standpoint by creating his own philosophy of entrepreneurship as a phenomenon conditioned by various human factors, which could not be explained by a closed theory.

The Dominican was not only an outstanding scholar of Thomism, but also its ardent supporter, being particularly attached to Thomistic concepts of pluralism and its consequent concepts of personalism, especially in the interpretation of Jacques Maritain, as expressed in his text published in &quot;Znak&quot;, Polish People’s Republic [sic] (I. Bocheński, ‘ABC tomizmu’, &quot;Znak&quot;, 1950, No. 2, pp. 89–126). Bocheński’s personalism did not, however, mean the absolutization of the idea of being able to implement Christianity in every political system, or that every political system was compatible with Christianity. Therefore, he did not agree with the Poles who in the 1940s and 50s supported of Emmanuel Mounier’s view that personalism could deepen socialism and vulgarised it to the level of leftist integrationism, stating as, for instance, Konstanty Łubieński, that a Catholic not only can, but even ought to be socialist (K. Łubieński, ‘Open letter to Mr Juliusz Lada. (On the margin of the note in &quot;The Tablet&quot;)’, &quot;Dziś i Jutro&quot;, 1948, No. 49, pp. 1–2). The PAX Association ideology derived from this theses, because this is what we are talking about here, assumed that despite different worldview inspirations, Marxism and Catholicism shared the same social and economic goals. Of course, this issue could not be viewed in a strictly theological context. As a staunch anti-communist, Bocheński was particularly opposed to any efforts of combining Catholicism with communism, and that was exactly what the PAX Association was implying.

The philosopher was personally involved in putting on the index of the Congregation of the Holy Office Bolesław Piasecki’s &quot;Zagadnienia istotne&quot; (&quot;Real Issues&quot;) as well as PAX’s biweekly &quot;Dziś i Jutro&quot; (&quot;Today and Tomorrow&quot;) – where incidentally his brother occasionally published texts. The official reason for this was the fact that Piasecki placed the Act of Creation above the Act of Salvation, which would allow Catholics to engage in any political system that in his subjective appraisal would lead to positive changes in the world. Bocheński received the text of the book from Janina Kolendo with Piasecki’s approval because he hoped Alexander’s older brother would understand the thesis and even persuade the Vatican to look also favourably on it. Józef Bocheński, was outraged and wrote a critical memorandum to Bishop Józef Gawlina, who then passed it on to the Holy Office. Bocheński, speaking on Polish Radio Free Europe, also engaged in that station’s campaign against Piasecki’s activities.

Józef’s stance against PAX also made him critical of the path selected by Alexander. Admittedly, the two brothers had a good relationship and corresponded with each other whenever it was possible. Aleksander would visit Józef in France or Switzerland, where, as the former half-jokingly recalled, he would and vainly try to persuade Jozef to divide competencies in the family, leaving the Dominican the theological issues and all the political issues to himself. Jozef, however, had no illusions that his younger brother had taken a path that was wrong and damaging to the Church. Already in the interwar period, Józef described Aleksander’s style of reasoning as foggy, in contrast to the brilliant analyses of his youngest brother Adolf. In the post-war period, Jozef primarily disapproved of Aleksander’s support of Piasecki’s campaign against Primate Wyszyński, which included PAX accusing the cardinal of disruptive activities. Aleksander not only approved of the open letter of the PAX Association in this matter, but even tried to persuade bishops Bohdan Brejza and Henryk Grzondziel to support it. Józef did not hide his indignation in a letter to his brother, in which he condemned Aleksander’s actions as contrary to ‘binding’ principles, and stated that he had abstained from public criticism not because of family considerations but because of the apolitical stance he had to maintain as a scholar and university rector.

During one of their meetings, in 1961, Aleksander and Józef served as intermediaries between Piasecki and the Vatican. This was a classified, informal meeting in which the Holy See tried to improve relations between PAX and Primate Wyszyński in return for information Piasecki could provide about the Church in the East. The whole matter never went beyond the sphere of speculation, but it showed that for the sake of the Church, Józef Bocheński was willing to put all personal and political animosities to one side.

In September 1982, he took part in negotiations to release hostages held at the Polish Embassy in Bern. In 1987, he visited Poland for the first time after almost 50 years.

Bocheński, a fan of fast cars and aviation (obtaining a pilot’s licence at the age of 68 in 1970, and achieving a total flight experience of 765 hours and 40 minutes), was famous for his original views and unconventional manner. In his will, he dedicated his body to science. Józef Maria Bocheński died in Fribourg on 2 February 1995.

His distinctions and awards included the Monte Cassino Commemorative Cross and the Gold Cross of the Polish Army Field Bishop in 1945, the Order of Italy and the Copernicus Silver Medal in 1973, the Alfred Jurzykowski Prize in 1974 and the Polonia Restituta Commander’s Cross (awarded Polish President Kazimierz Sabbat) in 1987. By a resolution of the Senate of the Republic of Poland, 2020 was proclaimed the year of Fr Józef Bocheński.

==Cracow Circle==
Bocheński is perhaps the most famous exponent of the Cracow Circle Thomism, which has been called &quot;the most significant expression of Catholic thought between the two World Wars.&quot; The Circle was founded by a group of philosophers and theologians that, in distinction from traditional neo-Thomism, embraced modern formal logic and applied it to traditional Thomist philosophy and theology. Inspired by the logical clarity of Aquinas, members of the Circle held both philosophy and theology to contain &quot;propositions with truth-values…a structured body of propositions connected in meaning and subject matter, and linked by logical relations of compatibility and incompatibility, entailment etc.&quot; &quot;The Cracow Circle set about investigating and where possible improving this logical structure with the most advanced logical tools available at the time, namely those of modern mathematical logic, then called ‘logistic’.&quot; Other members of the Circle included Jan Salamucha and Jan F. Drewnowski.

==&quot;Précis de logique mathématique&quot;== 
Bochenski said &quot;that once when he went to visit Lukasiewicz before the war [World War II], Lukasiewicz conveyed him inside excitedly, indicated a complex formula, beginning something like &#x27;CCC...&#x27;, and said, &#x27;Look at this beautiful and &quot;self-evidently true&quot; formula.&#x27; Clearly the formula&#x27;s truth was not immediately evident to the bemused Bochenski.&quot;

In Bocheński&#x27;s , he uses this notation, in the style of Łukasiewicz:

== The logical hexagon for the square of opposition ==
Robert Blanché quoted a passage of Bochenski’s &quot;Formale Logik&quot; in &quot;Structures intellectuelles&quot; (1966, 39): &quot;Hindu logic knows of three logical propositions and not the four of western logic. For it &quot;Some S are P&quot; does not signify &quot;Some S at least are P&quot; but &quot;Some S are P but not all&quot;.&quot; This passage shows that Indian tradition explicitly speaks of the existence of partial quantity, the third quantity to be considered along with totality apprehended by A the universal affirmative of the square, and zero quantity apprehended by E the universal negative of the square. To the two universals A and E entertaining a relationship of contrariety, one should add the third contrary constituted by the double negation of the first two. As the subcontrary I contradicts E and the subcontrary O contradicts A, the logical proposition apprehending partial quantity can be represented by the conjunction of I and O : I &amp; O. In Blanché’s logical hexagon this conjunction is symbolized by the letter Y. Many scholars think that the logical square of opposition, representing four values, should be replaced by the logical hexagon, which has the power to express more relations of opposition.

<doc id="1029403" wikidata="Q485273" url="?curid=1029403" title="Ik people">
<text>The Ik people are an ethnic group or tribe native to northeastern Uganda, near the Kenyan border. Primarily subsistence farmers, most Ik live in small clan villages, or &quot;odoks&quot;, in the area surrounding Mount Morungole in the Kaabong district. Their population is estimated between 10,000 and 15,000. The word &quot;Ik&quot; means &quot;head of migration&quot;; they are traditionally believed by locals to have been some of the region&#x27;s earliest settlers from Kenya.

The Ik language is a member of the Kuliak sub-group of Nilo-Saharan languages. Notable traditions include &quot;itówé-és&quot; (&quot;blessing the seeds&quot;), a three-day festival that marks the beginning of the agricultural year, and &quot;ipéyé-és,&quot; a coming-of-age ritual in which young men must cleanly slaughter a male goat with a spear. The Ik are predominantly Christian.

The Ik, along with various other Ugandan tribes, have been subject to forced eviction from their ancestral lands without compensation. They continue to face numerous challenges due to their small population and isolation. The road system in rural Kaabong is poor, and access to education and health services is scarce: in 2016, only one Ik student completed their O-level examinations. In 2016, Hillary Lokwang became the first member of the tribe to be elected to parliament; however, they continue to be politically marginalized. Due to their reliance on agriculture, they are vulnerable to drought and famine. The tribe is considered endangered by some.

In 1972, they were the subject of anthropologist Colin Turnbull&#x27;s highly contested book &quot;The Mountain People&quot;, which described a culture of extreme individualism in which love and altruism were virtually unknown. Later ethnographic research has challenged that portrayal.

==Communities and culture==
The Ik are divided into patrilineal clans, of which Heine in 1985 noted twelve. Clans are led by the &quot;J’akama Awae,&quot; an inherited position. Marriages between members of different clans occur; in these cases, according to Heine, women retain their original clan identity, while their children are born members of the father&#x27;s clan. Clans live in small, walled villages known as &quot;odoks&quot; or &quot;asaks&quot;. Ik villages may be visited by tourists.

=== Rituals ===
There are known rituals in Ik culture, the most significant of which are &quot;ipéyé-és&quot; and &quot;tasapet.&quot; Both are considered rights of passage and are practiced by only men: &quot;ipéyé-és&quot; marks the beginning of manhood, and &quot;tasapet&quot; the initiation to elderhood.  In &quot;ipéyé-és,&quot; young men must slaughter a male goat instantaneously, using a spear that may not penetrate the other side of the goat&#x27;s body. &quot;Tasapet&quot; may not be completed by a man until all of his older brothers have gone through it. Once this has occurred, his hair will be shaved and he will be taken to live in the bush for a month, as well as slaughtering a bull. Men who have completed &quot;tasapet&quot; are considered the highest members of the Ik: no decisions can be made without their consent, and they are entitled to respect from those younger. As of 1985, this tradition may be endangered due to the expense of purchasing cattle from neighboring groups.

=== Marriage ===
Marriage is generally arranged between families, and engagements may be decided when the bride is as young as seven to ten years old. The groom&#x27;s family is expected to pay a bride price; the groom is obligated to work for the bride&#x27;s family for a period. The first marriage ceremony is called &quot;tsan-es,&quot; in which the engaged are rubbed with oil. The groom then throws a spear at a tree, in order to test his abilities as a hunter. Following this, the bride is expected to cook and perform domestic duties for the groom&#x27;s clan, while they assess her ability to integrate among them. In the second ceremony, the groom&#x27;s family visits the bride bearing livestock and grain. They are welcomed with beer and any remaining problems between the two families are discussed. After a few days of celebration, the bride returns with the groom&#x27;s family. In subsequent ceremonies, the groom is expected to provide food or beer to various other members of the clan, in order to help integrate the newlyweds into society.

=== Holidays ===
Three major holidays were noted by Heine in his report, the most important of which is &quot;itówé-és&quot;, or “blessing of the seeds.” The holiday is celebrated over three days, generally in January, and marks the beginning of the agricultural season. On the first day of the holiday, a sacred tree is planted and people bring their seeds to be blessed under it, which includes dancing around the tree. Beer is brewed, and the following morning elder members taste it, after which it is drunk. No individual may drink until all older members of the tribe have done so first. &quot;Dzíber-ika mεs,&quot; or “beer of the axes”, is the second most important Ik holiday. Beer is brewed by individual families and brought to the &quot;di,&quot; the meeting place of the elders, along with all their agricultural tools. The beer is drunk and then sprinkled over the tools to bless them. It is usually celebrated in November or December. &quot;Inúmúm-έs&quot;, or “opening the harvest”, &quot; &quot;is celebrated around August. Harvested grains are cooked communally and eaten by the men at the &quot;di.&quot;

=== Generosity ===
Turnbull&#x27;s 1972 ethnography described the Ik as &quot;unfriendly, uncharitable, inhospitable and generally mean as any people can be.&quot; This perception of the Ik was reflected in other publications, including &quot;The New York Times,&quot; who described the Ik as a &quot;haunting flower of evil.&quot; A twenty-first century report by Catherine Townsend of Baylor University, however, fully repudiated these claims. Using the Dictator Game, a common anthropological test, the Ik demonstrated generosity on par with most other cultures. The Ik believe in nature spirits called &quot;kíʝáwika,&quot; which reward generosity. According to Townsend, Turnbull&#x27;s perception of the Ik may have been partly due to the famine the group was experiencing at the time.

A habitually peaceful people, the Ik are frequently raided by neighboring tribes. They have a ritual dance in which they practice responding to an attack, in which the men defend the village and women help lead children to hidden positions, as well as caring for wounded.

==Livelihood==
The Ik are primarily subsistence farmers. Their staple crops include sorghum, millet, corn and tobacco. Their diets are supplemented with hunting as well as gathering of certain foods, including honey, various fruits and white ants, known as &quot;danj.&quot; They may trade with neighboring groups for products such as cattle. The Ik are known to brew beer, and the drink plays an important role in some of their traditions.

==&quot;The Mountain People&quot;==
In 1972, anthropologist Colin Turnbull published an ethnography about the Ik, &quot;The Mountain People&quot;. The research provides an examination of Ik culture based on his fieldwork during a drought and famine in 1965–66. He depicts the Ik as a people forced into radical individualism to survive, such that they take no care or responsibility for others, sharing nothing, never cooperating on anything, and treating the elderly, infirm and even their own children as little more than burdens. He relies on the few surviving elderly Ik as sources for describing the earlier, less dysfunctional Ik society, including hunter-gatherer practices, marriage, childbirth, death rituals/taboos, and religion.

Turnbull records his horror at many of the events he witnesses, such as their disregard for familial bonds, leading to the death of children and the elderly by starvation. He writes warmly about certain Ik, and describes his &quot;misguided&quot; efforts to give food and water to those too weak to farm or forage, standing guard over them to prevent others from stealing their food. The book raises questions about human nature, and the abandonment of love and altruism in time of severe hardship; it also suggests parallels to the individualism of Western society. His time with the Ik exasperated Turnbull and aggravated his innate melancholy, yet he dedicated his work &quot;to the Ik, whom I learned not to hate&quot;.

Given the Ik&#x27;s subsistence crisis and (apparent) cultural collapse, Turnbull advocated to the Ugandan government that the tribe be broken up and resettled &quot;with no more than ten people in any re-located group&quot; to alleviate the Ik tendency of alienating their neighbors.

===Criticism===
Turnbull&#x27;s research is controversial among other researchers, who question the accuracy of many &#x27;vivid&#x27; claims by his study subjects. In 1983, Bernd Heine argued that Turnbull&#x27;s methods and conclusions were flawed:
* Evidence indicates Turnbull possessed limited knowledge of the rapidly-evolving Ik language and tradition and virtually no knowledge of the flora and fauna of the region. He asserted the Ik had been hunter-gatherers but were forced to learn farming after being expelled from their homeland by the formation of Kidepo National Park. However, linguistic and cultural evidence suggests that the Ik had been farmers long before that displacement.
* Some of Turnbull&#x27;s informants were not Ik but Diding&#x27;a, including Turnbull&#x27;s translator, named Lomeja, who Heine claimed spoke a broken form of Ik. Moreover, half of the six villages Turnbull studied were headed by non-Ik.
* Turnbull&#x27;s claim of extensive Ik cattle stealing is contradicted by official government reports.
* Heine&#x27;s own research contradicted Turnbull&#x27;s claim of frequent non-monogamy among the Ik; during the two years Turnbull stayed among them, there was only one documented instance of non-monogamous sexual activity.
Heine concluded, &quot;...Turnbull&#x27;s account of Ik culture turned out to be at variance with most observations we made - to the extent that at times I was under the impression that I was dealing with an entirely different people.&quot; Heine endorsed the conclusion of T.O. Beidelman:
===Cultural references===
Turnbull&#x27;s book provided material for a 1975 play called &quot;The Ik&quot; by Colin Higgins and Dennis Cannan. Directed by Peter Brook, the play premiered in Paris in 1975, and was produced in London in 1976 by the Royal Shakespeare Company. The group toured the United States in 1976 as a bi-centennial gift from French tax-payers.

The physician and poet Lewis Thomas wrote an essay, &quot;The Ik&quot;, which Cevin Soling read as a child and sparked a documentary, &quot;Ikland&quot; (2011). It was produced in the mid-2000s by Spectacle Films and was directed by Soling and David Hilbert. The film depicts the Ik people in a positive light by showing how easily befriended they are, how they survive and live as families, their music and dancing, and their ability to step into acting roles. The documentary concludes with members of the tribe mimicking a staged performance of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; by Charles Dickens as a Western metaphor for &#x27;redemption&#x27;.

<text>Nicolae Bălcescu () (29 June 181929 November 1852) was a Romanian Wallachian soldier, historian, journalist, and leader of the 1848 Wallachian Revolution.

==Early life==
Born in Bucharest to a family of low-ranking nobility, he used his mother&#x27;s maiden name, in place of his father&#x27;s name, &quot;Petrescu&quot; (his mother was originally from Bălcești, Vâlcea County now, then Argeș County). His siblings were Costache, Barbu, Sevasta and Marghioala, and his father died in 1824.

As a boy, Bălcescu studied at the Saint Sava College (from 1832), and was a passionate student of history. At the age of 17, he joined the Wallachian Army, and, in 1840, took part, alongside Eftimie Murgu and Cezar Bolliac, in Mitică Filipescu&#x27;s conspiracy against Prince Alexandru II Ghica. The plot was uncovered, and Bălcescu was imprisoned in Mărgineni Monastery, where he remained for the following two years. The rough imprisonment conditions led to Bălcescu contracting tuberculosis, which left irreversible marks on health and led to his death.

Upon his release (after being granted a pardon by the new prince, Gheorghe Bibescu), he took part in forming a secret society drawn up from the Freemasonry and named &quot;Frăția&quot; (&quot;The Brotherhood&quot;), which he led together with Ion Ghica and Christian Tell (joined soon after by Gheorghe Magheru) in resistance against Prince Bibescu.

==&quot;Magazin istoric pentru Dacia&quot; and other early works==

In order to further his history studies, Bălcescu went to France and Italy, and was, together with August Treboniu Laurian, the editor of a magazine entitled &quot;Magazin istoric pentru Dacia&quot;, which was first published in 1844; that year also marked the publishing (in a different magazine) of his historical essay &quot;Puterea armată și arta militară de la întemeierea Prințipatului Valahiei și până acum&quot; (&quot;The Military Strength and Art of Warfare from the Creation of the Wallachian Principality to This Day&quot;, which argued for a strong military as a guarantee of self-determination).

While in Paris (1846), he became leader of the Romantic nationalists and liberal-radical group &quot;Societatea studenților români&quot; (the Society of Romanian Students), which reunited Wallachians and Moldaviansit also included Ion Brătianu, Alexandru C. Golescu, Ion Ionescu de la Brad, C. A. Rosetti, and Mihail Kogălniceanu.

&quot;Magazin istoric&quot; went on to publish the very first collection of internal sources on the history of Wallachia and Moldaviamedieval chronicles which were afterwards published as a single volume. One of his contributions to the magazine singles him out as a radical liberal: &quot;Despre starea socială a muncitorilor plugari în Principatele Române în deosebite timpuri&quot; (&quot;On the Social Status of the Ploughmen of the Romanian Principalities at Various Times&quot;) argues for a land reform, aimed at dispossessing the boyars of large plots of land (that would in turn be awarded to landless peasants); it was used as reference by Karl Marx in his succinct analysis of the events, a fact which was to earn Bălcescu credentials in Communist Romania.

==Wallachian Revolution==

In 1848, after taking part in the uprising in France, Bălcescu returned to Bucharest in order to take part in the 11 June revolution. He was, for just two days, both Minister and Secretary of State of the provisional government put in place by the revolutionaries. His advocacy of universal suffrage and land reform was not shared by many revolutionaries, and his group came into conflict with the traditional figures of authoritythe Orthodox Metropolitan Neofit II, although head of the revolutionary government, opposed the reforms and ultimately conspired against the Revolution itself.

Bălcescu was arrested on 13 September that year by the authorities of the Ottoman Empire who had put an end to the Revolution; his relationship with the Ottomans was complicated by the fact that the radicals&#x27; strict opposition to Imperial Russia had made them reliable for the Portethe Ottomans later allowed all participants in the events to take refuge in Istanbul, and thus avoid contact with the Russian troops sent over to assist the Ottoman presence. Bălcescu initially made his way to Transylvania, but was expelled by Habsburg authorities, who considered him a threat and an agitator of Romanian sentiment in that region.

==In Istanbul and Transylvania==

In early 1849, Bălcescu was in Istanbul when the Hungarian revolutionary armies under Józef Bem mounted a successful offensive against Habsburg forces and their Transylvanian Romanian allies. The Hungarian government of Lajos Kossuth then entered a debilitating war with Avram Iancu&#x27;s Romanian guerrilla force, and the former members of the Wallachian government were approached by the Polish revolutionaries in exile, such as Henryk Dembiński, to mediate a peace between the two sides (in the hope that this was to ensure a stronger resistance to Russia, and counting on the Wallachian resentment towards the Saint Petersburg government).

Bălcescu left for Debrecen in May, and met with Kossuth to register the latter&#x27;s offer to Iancu. Marxist-inspired historiography has celebrated this as an agreement; in fact, Bălcescu&#x27;s papers reveal that he viewed the peace offering as unsatisfactory for Romanians, and that Avram Iancu rejected it altogether (while agreeing to a temporary armistice). The final offer from the Budapest leadership to Bălcescu and Iancu called for the Romanians to withdraw from Transylvania, as the region was turning into a battleground between Russia and the Hungarians. When this latter conflict drew to a close, the Romanians in Transylvania, although never particularly welcoming of the Russian presence, surrendered their weapons to the reinstated Habsburgs (Iancu&#x27;s loyalty to the dynasty had been the subject of a parallel dispute between him and the Wallachians).

==Final years==

Bălcescu&#x27;s most important work is &quot;Românii supt Mihai-Voievod Viteazul&quot; (&quot;Romanians under the Rule of Michael the Brave&quot;), which he wrote in exile in 1849first published posthumously by Alexandru Odobescu in 1860. The volume is a history of Michael&#x27;s campaigns, as the first moment when Wallachia, Transylvania, and Moldavia, came under a single, albeit brief rule. They show Bălcescu&#x27;s commitment to both radicalism and nationalism, his view oscillating between praise of Michael&#x27;s gestures and criticism of his stance as a supporter of serfdom and privilege.

His final years saw an intense publishing activity, including his study, written in French, , as well as a collaboration with Adam Mickiewicz on &quot;La Tribune des Peuples&quot;. Stricken by tuberculosis, impoverished, and constantly moving between various locations in France and the Italian Peninsula, he died in Palermo (in the Two Sicilies) at 33 years of age. Bălcescu never married, though he and his lover Alexandra Florescu had a son, Bonifaciu Florescu (1848–1899), who became a professor of French language and literature.

==Nationalization of his properties==
In the present his properties remain nationalized by the Romanian Government 2011, after 1945, as Bălcesti Giltofani Land in Bălcești which in the present is Nicolae Bălcescu Museum, taken from Bălcescu&#x27;s family member Radu Mandrea and Aristide Razu, in 1948 by a &quot;donation act&quot; towards the Communist Government, in Romania, in Vâlcea County.

Also his earthly remains, remain in Palermo, Italy, although the Communist Party of Romania tried to bring them back to Romania in 1970, to use them for communist propaganda. The Capuchin Monks in Palermo at the Capuchin Monastery, also known as Capuchin catacombs of Palermo, denied to the Romanian Communist Delegation of Historians access to the grave.

<text>Jefferson is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Frederick County, Maryland, United States. As of the 2020 census the town had a population of 2,235 (which includes the widespread area of the town&#x27;s zip code, not Jefferson proper). Jefferson was established in 1774 and incorporated as a town in 1831. However, a year later, in 1832, the citizens of the town decided that municipal government was unnecessary, and dis-incorporated the town, which has been unincorporated since then.

==History==
According to archaeologist Mary F. Barse, Jefferson was initially laid out in 1774 on a tract owned by Mrs. Eleanor Medley, which was ultimately called &quot;New Town&quot;. It contained 40 rectangular lots – 20 aligned on each side of what is now MD 180 – stretching between what are now Lander Road and Old Middletown Road. In 1795, 22 additional lots were platted by Elias Delashmutt on the western end of the original section, and called &quot;New Freedom&quot;. In 1831 both sections were incorporated as &quot;Jefferson&quot; by the Maryland Legislature.

Jefferson&#x27;s growth in the 19th century was due largely to its location on the main road between Frederick and Harpers Ferry, which is today&#x27;s Maryland Route 180. Along this thoroughfare, wagon traffic and livestock drives were frequent. Concomitantly, commercial development intensified to serve the surrounding farms as well as travelers. As a center of agricultural mercantilism, throughout most of the late 18th and 19th century, Jefferson was also home to a sizable population of slaves.

The Hagerstown and Frederick Railway linked Jefferson to Frederick and Hagerstown in 1907. However, Jefferson Pike remained the only link to the closest steam powered rail station in Brunswick.
Examined historic maps (Griffith 1795; Bond 1858; Martenet 1865, 1885; Lake 1873; USGS1910) depict Jefferson on what is now MD 180 as early as 1795. It was designated &quot;Trap Town&quot; at the close of the 18th century by Griffith (1795). Local history suggests that the name derives from the large number of taverns operating at the time, which were purportedly, on either ends of town. Consequently, a traveler could be &quot;trapped&quot; on their way in or out of town.

The Lewis Mill Complex and the George Willard House are National Register of Historic Places properties near Jefferson.

==Geography==
Jefferson is located in southwestern Frederick County at the western base of Catoctin Mountain. Maryland Route 180 passes through the town, and U.S. Route 340 bypasses it to the south, forming the southern edge of the CDP. US 340 leads northeast to Frederick, the county seat, and southwest to Harpers Ferry, West Virginia.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Jefferson CDP has an area of , all land.

Mar-Lu-Ridge Summer Camp and Education and Conference Center, located on the crest of Catoctin Mountain, south of Jefferson, has been a main retreat and outdoor ministry site for the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America since 1959.

<doc id="1029423" wikidata="Q957798" url="?curid=1029423" title="Megastructure">
<text>A megastructure is a very large artificial object, although the limits of precisely how large vary considerably. Some apply the term to any especially large or tall building. Some sources define a megastructure as an enormous self-supporting artificial construct. The products of megascale engineering or astroengineering are megastructures.

Most megastructure designs could not be constructed with today&#x27;s level of industrial technology. This makes their design examples of speculative (or exploratory) engineering. Those that could be constructed easily qualify as megaprojects.

Megastructures are also an architectural concept popularized in the 1960s where a city could be encased in a single building, or a relatively small number of buildings interconnected. Such arcology concepts are popular in science fiction. Megastructures often play a part in the plot or setting of science fiction movies and books, such as &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot; by Arthur C. Clarke.

In 1968, Ralph Wilcoxen defined a megastructure as any structural framework into which rooms, houses, or other small buildings can later be installed, uninstalled, and replaced; and which is capable of &quot;unlimited&quot; extension. This type of framework allows the structure to adapt to the individual wishes of its residents, even as those wishes change with time.

Other sources define a megastructure as &quot;any development in which residential densities are able to support services and facilities essential for the development to become a self-contained community&quot;.

Many architects have designed such megastructures. Some of the more notable such architects and architectural groups include the Metabolist Movement, Archigram, Cedric Price, Frei Otto, Constant Nieuwenhuys, Yona Friedman, and Buckminster Fuller.

==Proposed==
* Atlantropa, a hydroelectric dam to be built across the Strait of Gibraltar, lowering the surface of the Mediterranean Sea by as much as 200 meters.
* Trans-Global Highway, highway systems that would link all six of the inhabited continents on Earth. The highway would network new and existing bridges and tunnels, not only improving ground transportation but also potentially offering a conduit for utility pipelines.
* Cloud nine is Buckminster Fuller&#x27;s proposal for a tensegrity sphere a mile in radius which would be large enough so that it would float in the sky if heated by only one degree above ambient temperature, creating habitats for mini cities of thousands of people in each &quot;Cloud Nine&quot;. Fuller also proposed a marine analog consisting of a hollow terraced floating tetrahedron of reinforced concrete measuring one mile from vertex to vertex supporting a population of one million living in air-deployed residential modules on the exterior with the requisite infrastructure providing utilities (water, power, sewerage, etc.) inside. The modules would have standardized utility ports so as to be completely livable within minutes of arrival, and could be subsequently detached and moved to other such cities.
* The Line, a 170-kilometer-long linear settlement in Saudi Arabia, a smart city currently in the early stages of construction.

==Theoretical==
A number of theoretical structures have been proposed which may be considered megastructures.

===Stellar scale===

Most stellar scale megastructure proposals are designs to make use of the energy from a sun-like star while possibly still providing gravity or other attributes that would make it attractive for an advanced civilization.
* The Alderson disk is a theoretical structure in the shape of a disk, whose outer radius is equivalent to the orbit of Mars or Jupiter and whose thickness is several thousand kilometers. A civilization could live on either side, held by the gravity of the disk and still receive sunlight from a star bobbing up and down in the middle of the disk.
* A Dyson sphere (also known as a Dyson shell) refers to a structure or mass of orbiting objects that completely surrounds a star to make full use of its solar energy.
* A Matrioshka brain is a collection of multiple concentric Dyson spheres which make use of star&#x27;s energy for computing.
* A Stellar engine either uses the temperature difference between a star and interstellar space to extract energy or serves as a Shkadov thruster.
* A Shkadov thruster accelerates an entire star through space by selectively reflecting or absorbing light on one side of it.
* Topopolis (also known as Cosmic Spaghetti) is a large tube that rotates to provide artificial gravity.
* A Ringworld (or Niven Ring) is an artificial ring encircling a star, rotating faster than orbital velocity to create artificial gravity on its inner surface. A non-rotating variant is a transparent ring of breathable gas, creating a continuous microgravity environment around the star, as in the eponymous Smoke Ring.

Related structures which might not be classified as individual stellar megastructures, but occur on a similar scale:

* A Dyson swarm is a Dyson sphere made up of separately orbiting elements (including large habitats) rather than a single continuous shell.
* A Dyson bubble is a Dyson sphere in which the individual elements are statites, non-orbital objects held aloft by the pressure of sunlight.

===Planetary scale===
* A Bishop Ring, Halo or Orbital is a space habitat similar to but much smaller than a Niven Ring. Instead of being centered on a star, it is in orbit around the star and its diameter is typically on the order of magnitude of a planet. By tilting the ring relative to its orbit, the inner surface would experience a nearly conventional day and night cycle. Due to its enormous scale, the habitat would not need to be fully enclosed like the Stanford torus, instead its atmosphere would be retained solely by centripetal gravity and side walls, allowing an open sky.
* Globus Cassus is a hypothetical proposed project for the transformation of Planet Earth into a much bigger, hollow, artificial world with the ecosphere on its inner surface. This model serves as a tool to understand the World&#x27;s real functioning processes.
* Shellworlds or paraterraforming are inflated shells holding high pressure air around an otherwise airless world to create a breathable atmosphere. The pressure of the contained air supports the weight of the shell.
* Completely hollow shell worlds can also be created on a planetary or larger scale by contained gas alone, also called gravitational balloons, as long as the outward pressure from the contained gas balances the gravitational contraction of the entire structure, resulting in no net force on the shell. The scale is limited only by the mass of gas enclosed, the shell can be made of any mundane material. The shell can have an additional atmosphere on the outside.
*It can also refer to terraformed or artificial planets with multiple concentric layers.

===Orbital structures===
* An orbital ring is a dynamically elevated ring placed around the Earth that rotates at an angular rate that is faster than orbital velocity at that altitude, stationary platforms can be supported by the excess centripetal acceleration of the super-orbiting ring (similar in principle to a Launch loop), and ground-tethers can be supported from stationary platforms.
* The Bernal sphere is a proposal for a spherical space colony with a maximum diameter of 16 kilometers. It would have gravity at the equator, and gradually turn to zero G at the poles.
* Rotating wheel space stations, such as the Stanford torus, are wheel-like space station which produce artificial gravity by rotation. Typical designs include transport spokes to a central hub used for docking and/or micro-gravity research.
* The related concepts, O&#x27;Neill and McKendree cylinders, are both pairs of counter-rotating cylinders containing habitable areas inside and creating 1g on their inner surfaces via centripetal acceleration. The scale of each concept came from estimating the largest 1g cylinder that could be built from steel (O&#x27;Neill) or carbon fiber (McKendree).
* Hollowed asteroids (or Bubble worlds or Terraria) are spun on their axis for simulated gravity and filled with air, allowing them to be inhabited on the inside. In some concepts, the asteroid is heated to molten rock and inflated into its final form.
* A stellaser is a star-powered laser or maser.

===Trans-orbital structures===
* A skyhook is a very long tether that hangs down from orbit.
* A space elevator is a tether that is fixed to the ground, extending beyond geostationary orbital altitude, such that centripetal force exceeds gravitational force, leaving the structure under slight outward tension.
* A space fountain is a dynamically supported structure held up by the momentum of masses which are shot up to the top at high speeds from the ground.
* A launch loop (or Lofstrom loop) is a dynamically supported 2000 km long iron loop that projects up in an arc to 80 km that is ridden by maglev cars while achieving orbital velocity.
* StarTram Generation 2 is a maglev launch track extending from the ground to above 96% of the atmosphere&#x27;s mass, supported by magnetic levitation.
* A rotovator is a rotating tether where the lower tip is moving in the opposite direction to the tether&#x27;s orbital velocity, reducing the difference in velocity relative to the ground, and hence reducing the velocity of rendezvous; the upper tip is likewise moving at greater than orbital velocity, allowing propellantless transfer between orbits. Around an airless world, such as the moon, the lower tip can actually touch the ground with zero horizontal velocity. As with any momentum exchange tether, orbital energy is gained or lost in the transfer.

==Fictional==
A number of structures have appeared in fiction which may be considered megastructures.

===Stellar scale===
* The Dyson sphere has appeared in many works of fiction, including the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe.
* Larry Niven&#x27;s series of novels beginning with &quot;Ringworld&quot; centered on, and originated the concept of a ringworld, or Niven ring. A ringworld is an artificial ring with a radius roughly equal to the radius of the Earth&#x27;s orbit (1 AU). A star is present in the center and the ring spins to create g-forces, with inner walls to hold in the atmosphere. The structure is unstable, and required the author to include workarounds in subsequent novels set on it.
* In the manga &quot;Blame!&quot; the megastructure is a vast and chaotic complex of metal, concrete, stone, etc., that covers the Earth and assimilates the Moon, and eventually expands to encompass a volume greater than the orbit of Jupiter.
* In &quot;White Light&quot; by William Barton and Michael Capobianco, a Topopolis is presented as taking over the entire universe.
*In the Heechee Saga series by Frederik Pohl, a race of pure energy beings called The Foe have constructed the Kugelblitz, a black hole made of energy and not matter.
* In the Xeelee series of books by Stephen Baxter, the eponymous alien race constructed the Ring, a megastructure made of cosmic strings, spanning over 10 million light years.
* In &quot;Freelancer&quot;, The Dom&#x27;Kavosh&#x27;s Dyson shell that is inhabited by a drone race created by the Dom&#x27;Kavosh, Nomads. This is reached via a hyper gate, created by the same creators as the Dyson sphere.
* The Saga of Cuckoo series novel &quot;Wall Around a Star&quot; mentions a proposal to build a super dyson sphere, completely enclosing the Galactic Center.
* The title of the novel &quot;Helix&quot; by Eric Brown directly references a stellar-scale helical megastructure. Different types of environments and habitats are interspersed along the structure, while their varying distance from the central star affects the climate.
*The player&#x27;s central quest in computer game Dyson Sphere Program is to construct a Dyson sphere. Gameplay focuses on constructing planetary scale factories as a means towards this end.
* The Quarg in the game Endless Sky are shown building a massive ring around one of their stars, which is most likely around one astronomical unit in diameter. A completed version of this can also be found in another location.
* In computer games Space Empires IV and Space Empires V, the player can construct sphereworlds and ringworlds around stars.
* Dennis E. Taylor&#x27;s 2020 novel &quot;Heaven&#x27;s River&quot; features a &quot;Topopolis&quot; built around an alien system. Different segments of the structure are built with artificial climate and weather.

===Planetary and orbital scale===

* Several structures from the fictional &quot;Halo&quot; universe:
** The original twelve Halos, seen in &quot;&quot;, were 30,000 kilometers in diameter; a separate array of six Halos are 10,000 kilometers in diameter, with one of the original twelve later being reduced to this size in &quot;&quot;.
** The Lesser Ark is a 127,530 km diameter structure from which the Halo Array can be activated and capable of building 10,000 km Halos. The &quot;greater&quot; Ark, seen in &quot;Cryptum&quot; and &quot;Primordium&quot;, is capable of producing 30,000 km Halos. 
** Onyx is an artificial planet made entirely out of Forerunner Sentinels (advanced replicating robots). At its core is a &quot;shield world&quot;, contained within slipstream space, that is approximately one astronomical unit in diameter. The much smaller Shield World 0459, (approximately 1,400 km in diameter), is the setting for the latter half of &quot;Halo Wars&quot;. A third shield world, Requiem, is the primary setting for &quot;Halo 4&quot;. Requiem is an artificial hollow planet encased in a kind of Dyson Sphere. &quot;Halo 5: Guardians&quot; introduces a fourth shield world, Genesis.
** &quot;High Charity&quot;, the Covenant&#x27;s mobile planetoid station.
*In the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episodes &quot;The Stolen Earth&quot; and &quot;Journey’s End&quot;, a planet-sized space station known as The Crucible is built by the Daleks, a genocidal alien race, and facilitates the reality bomb, a weapon meant to erase the entire multiverse from existence. The Crucible also held enough Daleks to slaughter the universe they were in even without the bomb, according to The Doctor.
* In &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; and &quot;Shadow The Hedgehog&quot;, the Eclipse Cannon is a planet-destroying WMD built inside of the Space Colony Ark. 
* Buster Machine III from &quot;Gunbuster&quot;.
* The Culture Orbital from &quot;The Culture&quot;.
* In the 2013 CGI anime film, &quot;Space Pirate Captain Harlock&quot;, the Jovian Accelerator is an ancient, Death Star-like Weapon of mass destruction that uses energy from Jupiter&#x27;s atmosphere to create a large beam of intense light strong enough to destroy an entire planet.
* Sidonia, the main ship and home of millions of humans, 1000 years in the future in the Knights of Sidonia manga and anime series, created after the destruction of the earth along with other unnamed seed ships.
* Trantor, the capital of an interstellar empire in Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Foundation series, is an ecumenopolis, a planet entirely covered in one huge metal-clad building, with only one small green space: the Emperor&#x27;s palace grounds.
* The Ori Supergate seen in a number of episodes of &quot;Stargate SG1&quot; could be classed as a megastructure.
* In &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; series, Earth, as well as other planets, were artificial megastructures. Earth was intended to function as a gigantic computer and was built by a race of beings who made their living by manufacturing other planets.
* Mata-Nui in the &quot;BIONICLE&quot; franchise is classifiable as a megastructure. In the story, he is a massive robot as tall as a planet, and inside his body, every inhabitant of the BIONICLE Universe (Matoran, Toa, etc.) all live, unaware that they live inside a massive, space-traveling entity.
* In the &quot;Robotech&quot; Sentinels novels, Haydon IV is an artificially constructed cyber-planet with android citizens.
* In the &quot;Invader Zim&quot; episode &quot;Planet Jackers&quot;, two aliens surround the Earth with a fake sky in order to throw it into their sun.
* In the 2017 video game &quot;Destiny 2&quot;, the fleet of Dominus Ghaul, the ruler of the Cabal Empire, features a massive super-weapon named the &quot;Almighty&quot;, whose wingspan is said to be as wide as the planet Mercury. &quot;Almighty&quot; links itself to a solar system&#x27;s star on the quantum level via an energy beam and breaks it down into usable fuel, warping to another system before the star collapses into a supernova. 
* Nightmare&#x27;s fortress from &quot;&quot; can be classified as a megastructure because it is the size of a small planet.
* In several works, Arthur C. Clarke writes about a colossal hollow tube, first described in &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot; (1973), and inhabited by different races.
* The Citadel in the &quot;Mass Effect&quot; universe is an enormous space station constructed by an ancient race of machines called the Reapers millions of years before the games in the series. At the time of &quot;Mass Effect 2&quot;, its population is 13.2 million.
* In the game &quot;Airforce Delta Strike&quot; a large Space Elevator called the Chiron Lift is used to send supplies out into outer space.
* In the game &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, an alien empire, the Combine, invaded earth through the border world Xen. After the combine invaded earth in an event named the &quot;Seven Hour War&quot;, they created a large tower 2.5 miles tall, the &quot;Combine Citadel&quot;.
* In the &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; series, the Imperial Palace (site of the Golden Throne wherein the Emperor of Mankind is kept alive indefinitely) could be considered a megastructure. The palace is a complex of continent-wide structures with the Golden Throne being located in an area stretching across the whole of the Himalayan mountains.
* In the film &quot;Elysium&quot;, a luxury space station (a Bishop Ring) called Elysium houses the wealthy population of the human species.
* Large rotating space-stations are a staple of science fiction, including Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s novel &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, the battle school from &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;, and the eponymous &quot;Babylon 5&quot;.
* Hollowed asteroids feature in various fiction, such as Kim Stanley Robinson&#x27;s novel &quot;2312&quot;, Larry Niven&#x27;s &quot;Known Space&quot;, and Golden Age SF writers like Clarke and Asimov.
* In the 2022 film &quot;Moonfall&quot;, Earth&#x27;s moon is knocked from its orbit and begins to circle closer to Earth. A conspiracy theorist believes the Moon is a Dyson sphere megastructure and turns out to be correct.

=== &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977 – present, American sci-fi franchise) ===

* The Death Star from &quot;Star Wars&quot; is 160 km in diameter, followed by a second Death Star 200km in diameter. 
* Starkiller Base was constructed from the dwarf planet Ilum, depending on the source it&#x27;s diameter 660 to 830 km. 
* The Centerpoint Station was a 350  km spherical space station at the Lagrangian point between the planets Talus and Tralus in the Corellia system. It was a gigantic and ancient hyperspace tractor beam with which an ancient race, known as Celestials, created the Corellia star system. With the help of the tractor beam, whole planets could be moved through hyperspace and arranged into their actual orbits around the central star. On the other hand, the same technology could be used as a weapon to destroy even stars. On the inside of the main sphere, a huge living space called Hollowtown was home to many people in a similar fashion as on the inside of a Dyson sphere.
** A second, smaller megastructure of near-identical design, called Sinkhole Station, was also built shortly after the construction of Centerpoint Station. Its purpose was to maintain the stability of The Maw, a black hole cluster constructed using Centerpoint Station.
* Coruscant is an ecumenopolis, the planet is entirely covered by and essentially a city. It serves as the capital of first the Republic and then later the First Galactic Empire.
* The Galaxy Gun, a large space station designed to destroy entire planets from across the galaxy could be considered a megastructure because its size is more than seven kilometres long.
* The Star Forge from &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&quot;.
* Glavis Ringworld is a ring shaped space station around a star in &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot;.
* The Core World Kuat was circled by an orbital ring used primarily as a shipyard.
* There are multiple instances of hollowed asteroids, such as Hammer Station and the Eye of Palpatine.

=== &quot;Stellaris&quot; (2016 video game) ===

* Stellar-Scale Megastructures
** A Dyson Sphere is a megastructure added in the Utopia expansion, capable of producing massive amounts of energy at the cost of rendering the solar system uninhabitable, except for Habitats.
** A Ring World is a megastructure added in the Utopia expansion, offering a solar-system sized habitat equivalent to four massive habitable planets.
** A Matter Decompressor is a megastructure added in the Megacorp expansion to the game and allows the owner to harvest massive amounts of minerals from the cores of Black Holes.
** A Mega-Shipyard is a massive shipyard in orbit of a star, capable of producing ships much faster than average shipyards.
** The Aetherophasic Engine is a megastructure built by crisis aspirants, capable of destroying the entire galaxy as a side-product of allowing the race which constructed it to ascend to the &quot;Shroud&quot;, an alternate dimension in the game composed of nearly pure energy
** A Quantum Catapult is a large megastructure built around a pulsar or neutron star that is capable of sending fleets instantly across the galaxy. It however is not completely accurate and thus can send fleets away from their intended destinations.
* Orbital/Planetary Scale Megastructures
** A Science Nexus is a massive orbital science laboratory which expands the empire&#x27;s science production massively.
** A Sentry Array is a massive orbital station that gives you sight over the entire in-game galaxy.
** Habitats are orbital structures which serve the purpose of a small planet.
** A Mega Art Installation is a megastructure that improves your overall amenities and happiness in your empire.
** A Strategic Coordination Center is a megastructure that Increases your naval capacity, and ship speed, as well as adds several other bonuses.
** An Interstellar Assembly acts as a hub for the game&#x27;s Galactic Community, increases your diplomatic weight, adds more envoys, and another empire&#x27;s opinion of you.
** Gateways allow for near-instantaneous travel across the galaxy. In addition, there is a unique form of Gateway called &quot;L-Gates&quot; which link up to an extragalactic cluster of stars.
** Orbital Rings are massive ring structures built around planets that afford extra protection and increase the output of the planet.
** Hyper Relays are large structures that allow ships to jump to identical Hyper Relays in adjacent systems instead of using the existing hyperlane connections, thereby avoiding having to traverse systems at sublight speeds.
* In addition, many megastructures can also generate in &quot;ruined&quot; versions, which the player can later repair.

<text>Alebrijes () are brightly colored Mexican folk art sculptures of fantastical (fantasy/mythical) creatures.

==Description==
The first alebrijes originated in Mexico City, originally created by &#x27;cartonero&#x27; artist Pedro Linares. Linares often said that in 1943, he fell very ill. While he was in bed unconscious, he dreamt of a strange place resembling a forest. There, he saw trees, rocks, and clouds that suddenly transformed into strange, unknown animals. He saw &quot;a donkey with butterfly wings, a rooster with bull horns, and a lion with an eagle head,&quot; and all of them were shouting one word &quot;Alebrijes! Alebrijes! Alebrijes!&quot; Upon recovery, he began recreating these Chimera-like creatures that he had seen in cartonería, the making of three-dimensional sculptures with different types of papers, strips of papers, and &quot;engrudo&quot; (glue made out of wheat flour and water).

His work caught the attention of artists Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo because they used to purchase Judas figures from Pedro Linares. In the 1980s, British filmmaker Judith Bronowski arranged an itinerant Mexican art craft demonstration workshop in the United States featuring Pedro Linares, Manuel Jiménez, and Maria Sabina, a textile artisan from Oaxaca. Although the Oaxaca Valley area already had a history of carving animals and other types of figures from wood, artisans from Oaxaca learned of the alebrijes paper-mâché sculptures when Bronowski&#x27;s workshop took place. Linares demonstrated his designs on family visits. These were adapted to the carving of a local wood called copal; this type of wood is said to be magical, made from united magic. In the 1990s, the artisans of Oaxaca began to use the word Alebrije to designate their figures carved in wood.

The papier-mâché-to-wood carving adaptation was pioneered by Arrazola native Manuel Jiménez. This version of the craft has since spread to several other towns, most notably San Martín Tilcajete and La Unión Tejalapan, and has become a significant source of income for the area, especially for Tilcajete. The success of the craft, however, has led to the depletion of the native copal trees. Attempts to remedy this with reforestation efforts and management of wild copal trees have had limited success. The three towns most closely associated with alebrije production in Oaxaca have produced a number of notable artisans such as Manuel Jiménez, Jacobo Angeles, Julia Fuentes, and Miguel Sandiego.

== Original papercraft alebrijes ==
Alebrijes originated in Mexico City in the 20th century, in 1936. The first alebrijes, as well as the name itself, are attributed to Pedro Linares, an artisan from México City (Distrito Federal), who specialized in making piñatas, carnival masks and &quot;Judas&quot; figures from cartonería, an ancient and widespread papercraft often confused with papier-mâché. He sold his work in markets such as the one in La Merced.

In 1936, when he was 30 years old, Linares fell ill with a high fever, which caused him to hallucinate. In his fever dreams, he was in a forest with rocks and clouds, many of which turned into wild, unnaturally colored creatures, frequently featuring wings, horns, tails, fierce teeth and bulging eyes. He heard a crowd of voices repeating the nonsense word &quot;Alebrije&quot;. After he recovered, he began to re-create the creatures he&#x27;d seen, using papier-mâché and cardboard. Eventually, a Cuernavaca gallery owner discovered his work. This brought him to the attention of Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, who began commissioning more alebrijes. The tradition grew considerably after British filmmaker Judith Bronowski&#x27;s 1975 documentary on Linares.

Linares received Mexico&#x27;s National Arts and Sciences Award in the Popular Arts and Traditions category in 1990, two years before he died. This inspired other alebrije artists, and Linares&#x27; work became prized both in Mexico and abroad. Rivera said that no one else could have fashioned the strange figures he requested; work done by Linares for Rivera is now displayed at the Anahuacalli Museum in Mexico City.

The descendants of Pedro Linares, such as his son Miguel Linares, his granddaughters Blanca y Elsa Linares, and his grandson Ricardo Linares, live in Mexico City near the Sonora Market and carry on the tradition of making alebrijes and other figures from cardboard and papier-mâché. Their customers have included the Rolling Stones, David Copperfield, and filmmaker Guillermo del Toro. The Stones gave the family tickets to their show. Various branches of the family occupy a row of houses on the same street. Each family works in its own workshops in their own houses, but they will lend each other a hand with big orders. Demand rises and falls; sometimes there is no work, and sometimes families work 18 hours a day.

The original designs for Pedro Linares&#x27; alebrijes have fallen into the public domain. However, according to Chapter Three of the 1996 Mexican federal copyright law, it is illegal to sell crafts made in Mexico without acknowledging the community and region they are from, or to alter the crafts in a way that could be interpreted as damaging to the culture&#x27;s reputation or image. The law applied to the commercialization of the crafts as well as to their public exhibition and the use of their images. This law is rarely enforced; most crafts sellers in Mexico rarely disclose where the origin of their products. The name &quot;alebrijes&quot; is used for a wide variety of crafts, even though the Linares family has sought to gain control over the name. The family says that pieces which are not made by them and do not come from Mexico City should state so. The Linares family continues to export their work to the most important galleries showing Mexican art worldwide. For example, &quot;Beasts and Bones: The Cartonería of the Linares Family&quot; in Carlsbad, California, featured about seventy alebrijes and was so popular that it was extended by several weeks.

Because a variety of artists and artisans have been creating alebrijes in their own styles, the craft has become part of Mexico&#x27;s folk art repertoire. No two alebrijes are exactly alike. Outside of the Linares family, one of the most noted alebrije artists is Susana Buyo, who learned to work with cardboard and papier-mâché at one of the Linares family workshops. Known as the &quot;Señora de los Monstruos&quot; by the local children in Condesa, an upscale neighborhood of Mexico City, she is a native Argentine and naturalized Mexican citizen. Her work can be found across Mexico City and elsewhere, such as those found in Europe. Her work differs from that of the Linares in that many of her designs include human contours, and many have expressions more tender than terrifying. She also uses nontraditional materials such as feathers, fantasy stones, and modern resins, both for novelty and for durability.
While Pedro Linares dreamed up the creatures, they did not surface in a vacuum. Similarities and parallels can be drawn between alebrijes and various supernatural creatures from Mexico&#x27;s indigenous and European past. In pre-Hispanic art, the brightly colored images were often fantastic and macabre. Influences from Mexico City&#x27;s Chinatown, especially in the dragons, and Gothic art such as gargoyles can be seen. Red cardboard demons called judas, which Linares made, are still made to be burned in Mexico during Holy Week in purification rituals. More recent examples in Mexican culture, artist Julio Ruelas and graphics artist/commentator José Guadalupe Posada, have created fantastic and sometimes terrifying images. Alebrijes, especially the monsters, have gained a reputation for &quot;scaring away bad spirits&quot; and protecting the home. Some, like master craftsman Christian David Mendez, claim that there is a certain mysticism involved in the making and owning of alebrijes, with parts of certain animals representing human characteristics.

=== The annual Monumental Alebrije Parade in Mexico City ===

A more recent phenomenon, the annual Monumental Alebrije Parade, has been sponsored by the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City since 2007. The 2009 parade featured more than 130 giant alebrijes made of wood, cardboard, paper, wire, and other materials, and marched from the Zocalo in the historic center of the city to the Angel of Independence monument on Paseo de la Reforma. Entries by artisans, artists, families and groups each year have gotten bigger, more creative and more numerous, with names like:

* &quot;Devora Stein&quot; by Uriel López Baltazar
* &quot;Alebrhijos&quot; by Santiago Goncen
* &quot;Totolina&quot;, by Arte Lado C
* &quot;AH1N1&quot; by Taller Don Guajo
* &quot;Volador&quot;, by Taller de Plástica El Volador
* &quot;La mula del 6&quot; by Daniel Martínez Bartelt
* &quot;La gárgola de la Atlántida&quot; by Juan Carlos Islas
* &quot;Alebrije luchador&quot; by Ricardo Rosales

They are accompanied by bands playing popular Mexican music. At the end of the parade, the pieces are lined up on Paseo de la Reforma for judging and displayed for two weeks. The 2010 alebrije parade had themes related to the Bicentennial of the Independence of Mexico and the Centennial of the Mexican Revolution, although Walter Boelsterly, head of the Museo de Artes Populares, concedes that such may require a bit of tolerance because it can lead to revered figures such as Miguel Hidalgo and Ignacio Allende with animal parts. He states that the aim is to celebrate and not to mock. In addition to the annual parade, the Museum has sponsored alebrije shows such as the three-meter tall alebrije which captured attention at the Feria International del Libro in Bogotá. The word &quot;alebrije&quot; was not known in Colombia, so the locals dubbed it a &quot;dragoncito&quot; (little dragon). Along with &quot;dragoncito&quot; 150 other, smaller pieces of Mexican crafts were shown.

== Carved wood alebrijes ==
=== Development of the craft in Oaxaca ===

Many rural households in the Mexican state of Oaxaca have prospered over the past three decades through the sale of brightly painted, whimsical wood carvings they call alebrijes to international tourists and the owners of ethnic arts shops in the United States, Canada, and Europe. What are called &quot;alebrijes&quot; in Oaxaca is a marriage of native woodcarving traditions and influence from Pedro Linares&#x27; work in Mexico City.

Pedro Linares was originally from México City (Distrito Federal). In the 1980s, British filmmaker, Judith Bronowski, arranged an itinerant demonstration workshop in the United States participating Pedro Linares, Manuel Jiménez and a textile artisan Maria Sabina from Oaxaca. Although the Oaxaca valley area already had a history of carving animal and other types of figures from wood, it was at this time, when Bronowski&#x27;s workshop took place when artisans from Oaxaca knew the alebrijes papier-mâché sculptures.

Then Linares&#x27; designs were adapted to the carving of a local wood called copal. The Oaxaca valley area already had a history of carving animal and other types of figures from wood, and Linares&#x27; designs were adapted to the carving of a local wood called copal. This adaptation was pioneered by Arrazola native Manuel Jiménez. This version of the craft has since spread to a number of other towns, most notably San Martín Tilcajete and La Unión Tejalapan, become a major source of income for the area, especially for Tilcajete. Given the scale of success with alebrijes, populations of native copal trees have decreased over the years. Efforts through reforestation and the management of the trees have yet to create any significant growth in population. The three towns most closely associated with alebrije production in Oaxaca have produced a number of notable artisans such as Manuel Jiménez, Jacobo Angeles, Martin Sandiego, Julia Fuentes and Miguel Sandiego.

One of the most important things about the fantastical creatures carved of wood is that every piece is removable, it is how one can tell a genuine piece carved by one of the original great carvers. The later carvers did not learn the technique of making each piece fit so well that it could be removed and put back in again and again. Those pieces have more than tripled in value. The painting on these figures is also more intense and varied.
The first to copy the fantastic forms and bright colors was Manuel Jiménez, who carved the figures in local copal wood rather than using paper. Animal figures had always been carved in the central valleys area of Oaxaca by the Zapotecs since the pre-Hispanic period. Totems of local animals were carved for luck or religious purposes as well as hunting decoys. Figures were also carved for children as toys, a tradition that continued well into the 20th century. 

After the craft became popular in Arrazola, it spread to Tilcajete and from there to a number of other communities, and now the three main communities are, San Antonino Arrazola, San Martin Tilcajete and La Union Tejalapam, each of which has developed its own style. The carving of wood figures did not have a name, so the name &quot;alebrije&quot; eventually became adopted for any carved, brightly colored figure of copal wood, whether it is of a real animal or not. To make the distinction, the carvings of fantastic creatures, closer to Linares&#x27; alebrijes, are now sometimes called &quot;marcianos&quot; (lit. Martians). Oaxacan alebrijes have eclipsed the Mexico City version, with a large number of stores in and around the city of Oaxaca selling the pieces, and it is estimated that more than 150 families in the same area make a living making the figures.

Woodcarving, along with other crafts in Oaxaca, grew in importance as the state opened up to tourism. This started in the 1940s with the Pan-American Highway and has continued to this day with the construction of more roads, airports and other transportation coincided with the rising prosperity of the U.S. and Canada making Mexico an affordable exotic vacation. Oaxacan woodcarving began to be bought in the 1960s by hippies. Prior to the 1980s, most of the woodcarvings were natural and spiritual world of the communities, featuring farm animals, farmers, angels and the like. These pieces, now referred to as &quot;rustic&quot; (nistico), were carved and painted in a simple manner. Later known for their alebrijes, carvers such as Manuel Jimenez of Arrazola, Isadoro Cruz of Tilcajete and Martin Sandiego of La Union began by carving animals as youths, often while doing other chores such as tending sheep. By the 1960s and 1970s, these carvers had enough of a reputation to sell their work in the city of Oaxaca. As more dealers shipping to other parts of Mexico and abroad visited the rural villages, more exotic animals such as lions, elephants and the like were added, and eventually came to dominate the trade. Eventually, traditional paints gave way to acrylics as well. Another development that encouraged woodcarving were artisans&#x27; contests held by the state of Oaxaca in the 1970s, which encouraged carvers to try new ideas in order to win prizes and sell their pieces to state museums.
In the 1970s and early 1980s, carvers in the three villages sold pieces mostly to store owners in Oaxaca, with only one carver, Manuel Jimenez, carving full-time. Most other carvers used the craft to supplement incomes from farming and wage labor. It was also considered to be a male occupation. In the mid-1980s, the influence of the Linares alebrijes was becoming popular and wholesalers and store owners from the United States, began to deal with artisans in Oaxaca directly. The desire of the foreign merchants for non-indigenous animals and the newly popular alebrijes affected the market. By 1990, woodcarving had begun to boom with most households in Arrazola and Tilcajete earning at least part of their income from the craft. La Union was less successful in attracting dealers and tourists. The boom had a dramatic economic effect, shifting the economies of Arrazola and Tilcajete away from farming and towards carving. It also affected the carvings that were being produced. Carvings became more complicated and paintings more ornate as families competed against each other. Specialization also occurred with neophyte carvers looking for a niche to compete with already established carvers. The craft continued to become established in the 1990s as more families carved and more tourists came to Oaxaca with the building of new roads. Some of these new Oaxacan crafters have extended the design to smooth – abstract painted realistic animals, especially the Mendoza family (Luis Pablo, David Pablo and Moises Pablo a.k.a. Ariel Playas), creating a new generation of alebrijes.

While the sales trend has been mostly positive for Oaxacan alebrijes, it is dependent on global market fluctuations and on tourism to Oaxaca. There was a decline in sales in the late 1980s, possibly due to global market saturation and the dominance of repetitive, unimaginative designs. Sales rose again in the 1990s. Sales fell again in 2001, when tourism from the U.S. fell and fell again precipitously 2006 due to statewide social unrest. It has not fully recovered since.

The alebrije market is divided into two levels, the production of unique, high-quality, labor-intensive pieces and the production of repetitive, average quality and inexpensive pieces. Those who have produced exceptionally fine pieces have gained reputations as artists, commanding high prices. Larger pieces are generally made only by the better carving families. While pieces can be bought and ordered from the artisans directly, most sell to middlemen who in turn sell them to outlets in Mexico and abroad. The most successful carving families sell almost exclusively to dealers and may have only a few pieces available for the drop-in visitor. Within Mexico, Oaxacan alebrijes are often sold in tourist locations such as Oaxaca city, La Paz, Cancún, Cozumel and Puerto Escondido. Most pieces sold internationally go to the United States, Canada, Europe and Japan, where the most expensive pieces end up in ethnic craft stores in urban areas, university towns and upscale resorts. Cheaper pieces tend to be sold at trade shows and gift shops. Tourists who buy pieces directly from carvers pay about twice what wholesalers do.

The price of each piece depends on the quality, coloring, size, originality and sometimes the reputation of the carver. The most expensive pieces are most often sent abroad. Pieces sold retail in Oaxaca generally range from US$1 to $200. The most commercialized figures are those of dogs, armadillos, iguanas, giraffes, cats, elephants, zebras, deer, dolphins, sharks, and fish. Animals are often painted with bright colors and designs and carved with exaggerated features that bear little resemblance to what occurs in the natural world. Anthropomorphism is common and carvings of animals playing musical instruments, golfing, fishing, and engaging in other human pursuits are very popular.

Fantastic creatures such as dragons and chimeras and others are also carved, even carvings of Benito Juárez, Subcomandante Marcos, chupacabras (imaginary beings that eat goats), &quot;Martians,&quot; mermaids, and hippocampus.

The diversity of the figures is due to a segmented market both in Mexico and abroad which rewards novelty and specialization. In a number of cases, carvings return to images from Mexican culture such as angels, saints, and Virgins, which will have somber faces even if they are painted in very bright colors. Devils and skeletons are often parts of more festive scenes depicting them, for example, riding dogs and drinking. Foreign customers demand more creative figures with little repetition. Prices abroad range from between three and five times the retail price in Oaxaca, with a median of US$100, with lowest usually around $10 and highest around $2,000. One of the most expensive pieces sold from a carving village occurred in 1995, when a doctor from Mexico City paid Isidro Cruz of Tilcajete the equivalent of US$3000 for a piece entitled &quot;Carousel of the Americas.&quot; This piece took Cruz three months to complete.

Typical household income of families from Arrazola and Tilcajete averages about US$2000 per year, but exceptional artists can earn up to $20,000 per year. Two thousand a year is substantially more than average in Oaxaca and allows families to build or expand housing and send children to secondary school. Most families carve as a sideline with agriculture providing basic staples. In some towns, especially in Tilcajete, the economy has shifted from agriculture to the making of wood carvings with a number of families abandoning farming altogether. For most households in Oaxaca, the success of alebrijes has not replaced the need to farm or alleviated the need to send family members to Mexico City or to the United States and work and send remittances back home.

Despite Oaxaca&#x27;s reputation for the production of crafts by indigenous peoples, alebrije makers are monolingual Spanish speakers who generally do not identify themselves as a member of an indigenous group, though almost all have Zapotec ancestors. The alebrijes are considered to be novelty items for the makers rather than expressions of a cultural heritage. More traditional woodcarving, such as utensils, toys, religious figures and the like are still made by older residents, but these crafts are overshadowed by alebrijes. Approximately 150 families now devote themselves at least part-time to the making of alebrijes, with carving techniques being passed down from generation to generation and many children growing up around fantastic figures both finished and in process.

Due to copies from other places, a certification scheme is being considered to ensure the viability of crafts from this area. That would include educating consumers and working with reputable stores.

=== The carving process ===

The carving of a piece, which is done while the wood is still wet, can last anywhere from hours to a month, depending on the size and fineness of the piece. Often the copal wood that is used will influence what is made, both because of the shapes the branches can take and because male and female trees differ in hardness and shape. Carving is done with non-mechanical hand tools such as machetes, chisels and knives. The only time a more sophisticated tool is used is when a chain saw is employed to cut off a branch or level a base for the proposed figure. The basic shape of the creature is usually hacked using a machete, then a series of smaller knives used as the final shape is achieved. Certain details such as ears, tails and wings are usually made from pieces separate from the one for the main body.

After the carving, the figure is then left to dry for up to ten months, depending on its overall size and thickness. Semi tropical wood such as copal is susceptible to insect infestations, and for this reason drying pieces are often soaked in gasoline and sometimes baked to ensure that all insect eggs have been destroyed. As the figure dries, it is also susceptible to cracking. The cracks are filled with small pieces of copal wood and a sawdust resin mixture before painting.

Oaxaca woodcarvings were all originally painted with aniline paints made with natural ingredients such as bark of the copal tree, baking soda, lime juice, pomegranate seeds, zinc, indigo, huitlacoche and cochineal. These colorings were also used for dying clothing, ceremonial paints and other uses. Since 1985, most carvers have now switched to acrylics which resist fading and withstand repeated cleanings better. Some still use aniline paints as they have a more rustic look that some customers prefer. Either way, the painting is generally done in two layers, with a solid undercoat and a multicolored designed superimposed.

Originally, woodcarving was a solitary activity with all aspects done by one person, usually a male. As sales soared in the 1980s, the work began to be shared among family members. Women and children help mostly with sanding and painting, leaving men to contribute less than half of the work that goes into the figures. Despite this, pieces are still referred to as the work of one person, usually the male carver. There are exceptions to this. There are men who paint better than they carve and in the community of San Pedro Taviche, women collect and carve wood about as often as the men. In most cases, all the work on pieces is done by family members. Families may hire other relatives or strangers if faced with a large order. However, only the most established of carving families can have any permanent outside help and a number of these refuse to hire outsiders.

=== Copal wood ===

Almost all alebrije carvers in Oaxaca use the wood of trees from the genus &quot;Bursera&quot; (Family Burseraceae), with a preference for the species &quot;B. glabrifolia&quot;, which is locally called copal or copalillo. This tree is typically found in dry tropical forests in Oaxaca and neighboring states. The exceptions are Isidro Cruz of Tilcajete, who uses &quot;zompantle&quot; (&quot;Erythrina coralloides&quot;) and the Manuel Jimenez family, which carves in tropical cedar (&quot;Cedrela odorata&quot;) imported from Guatemala.

Originally, carvers obtained wood from the local forests on their own. Copal trees are short and squat and do not yield much wood; every piece is used. Despite this, the success of woodcarving caused an unsustainable drain on local wild copal, and nearly all of the trees near Tilcajete and Arrazola have disappeared. This localized depletion soon gave rise to a copal wood market in Oaxaca, even though many of the copal trees in other parts are of a different subspecies, which has more knots. Obtaining wood is a complex exercise because negotiating with other municipalities requires navigating complex social, legal and economic norms, and in many cases, state and federal environmental authorities have stepped in to try to preserve wild copal trees in a number of areas. Some communities have simply refused to sell their wood. These difficulties has led to a black market in copal wood, with carvers purchasing most of their supplies from vendors called &quot;copaleros&quot;. Harvesting copalillo is not a complex task; trees are relatively small and the wood is soft. Trees are felled using an axe or chainsaw. Branches are cut with machetes. Most harvesting occurs on ejidal (communal) lands. Legal or not, the purchase of copal wood from other parts of Oaxaca is putting unsustainable pressure on wild populations in a wider area, forcing copaleros to go further to obtain wood and often to deal with angry locals and police who alternately seek bribes and enforce the law. Eventually, this led to about only six copaleros which control most of the wood being sold, and these supplies&#x27; being unreliable. The federal government states that most of the figures are made with illegally obtained wood.

Securing supplies of copal wood is a major concern for woodcarvers. Despite the fact that the cost of the wood is not particularly high, despite the effort, the main issue is reliability. Another issue for carvers is quality. Artisans will pay more for their wood only if they are sure they can pass the added cost onto their customers. A number of attempts to grow the trees for woodcarving purpose have been undertaken. Copal is a native tree species to the area, so it grows readily without much care. It takes anywhere from five to ten years for a tree to grow big enough to be harvested (branches or entire tree). Some of the efforts include reforestation efforts sponsored by groups such as the Rodolfo Morales Foundation in Ocotlan, and a number of families spend time planting trees during the rainy season. Some have begun copal plantations. Various artisans have also joined the reforestation efforts through associations of their own, creating alebrijes while attempting to restore what they take from nature. Current needs for the wood far outweigh what these efforts have been able to produce.

Another effort involves a program designed to manage wild copal supplies in a municipality called San Juan Bautista Jayacatlán. This arrangement has economic advantages for both the alebrije-makers and the owners of the forests where the wood is produced. It has not been developed sufficiently yet to affect the illegal harvest of wood, but its organizers hope that in time, it will become the more economical and preferred method. The difference between this program and others is that this works within the broader ethnobotanical context by promoting the management of the species within its native habitat. Jayacatlán is located next to the recently established biosphere reserve of Tehuacán-Cuicatlán. The benefit to Jayacatlán is to give the municipality a way to exploit its copal supplies and preserve its biodiversity at the same time. The benefit to carvers is to promote a reliable source of wood, as well as a trademark called &quot;ecoalebrijes&quot; to help them sell more alebrijes at a higher price. The wood from Jayacatlan is only sold to Arrazola and not to the other major center of Tilcajete. The enthusiasm of Arrazola&#x27;s woodcarvers stems more from having a supply of good wood than from notions of ecology.

=== San Martin Tilcajete ===

Of the three major carving towns, San Martin Tilcajete has experienced the most success. This success is mostly due to carver Isidro Cruz, who learned to carve when he was thirteen during a long illness in the late 1940s. His work was sold locally and eventually noticed by Tonatiúh Gutierrez, the director of expositions for the Mexican National Tourist Council, later a government agency in charge of promoting crafts. He encouraged Cruz to carve masks and later appointed him in charge of a state craft buying center. Cruz worked at this for four years, learning much about craft selling and getting others from Tilcajete connected to the market. Unlike other carvers, Cruz was open about his techniques and by the late 1970s, about ten men were carving and selling in Tilcajete. Cruz not only taught his methods to others, he was able to purchase many of his neighbors&#x27; works. Cruz&#x27;s efforts stimulated new styles of carving, such as alebrijes, and their sale in the city of Oaxaca. By the 1980s, there were four families devoted to carving full-time, with the rest splitting their time between crafts and agriculture. Through the 1960s and to the 1980s, embroidered shirts, blouses and dresses were still a well-received craft from Tilcajete, but by the end of the 1980s, most families were involved in carving alebrijes.

Today, the carving of alebrijes is the economic base of Tilcajete. Every Friday on the main square is the &quot;tianguis del alebrije&quot; or weekly market selling wooden figures. The event allows visitors to purchase items from local craftsmen directly. There are usually also vendors selling other local products such as ice cream as well. Annually, the municipality holds its Feria del Alebrije (Alebrije Festival), which features alebrije sales and exhibitions, music, dance and theatre. There are also offerings of local and regional cuisine. More than 100 vendors attend, selling alebrijes, textiles, local dishes, artwork and locally made alcoholic beverages. It is sponsored by the Master Craftsmen Group of Tilcajete (Grupo de Maestros Talladoes de Tilcajete), which includes Hedilberto Olivera, Emilia Calvo, Roberta Ángeles, Juventino Melchor, Martin Melchor, Margarito Melchor Fuentes, Margarito Melchor Santiago, José Olivera Pérez, Jesús Melchor García, Vásquez, María Jiménez, Cira Ojeda, Jacobo and María Ángeles, Justo Xuana, Victor Xuana, Rene Xuana, Abad Xuana, Flor and Ana Xuana, Rogelio Alonso, who works in papier-mâché, and Doris Arellano, who is a painter.

Some of the better known artisans in Tilcajete include Delfino Gutierrez, sisters Ana and Marta Bricia Hernandez, the family of Efrain and Silvia Fuentes, Coindo Melchor, Margarito Melchor and Maria Jimenez. Delfino Gutierrez specializes in free-form elephants, frogs, turtles, armadillos and more which are sold in stores in Chicago, California, New York and Israel. The Hernandez sisters sell primarily from their home and known for their painting style. The Fuentes family gained fame from Efrain&#x27;s carving talents. He was featured in an exhibit in Santa Fe, NM when he was only 13 and his work has been featured in at least one book. Margarito Melchor specializes in cats, and Coindo Melchor carves elaborate ox teams with bulls, driver, and a cart filled with animals and crops as well as creatures that have been described as &quot;bird headed women.&quot; Maria Jimenez and her brothers specialize in saints and angels as well as some animals. Maria is the best known painter in the Oaxacan community. She says that she has about thirty designs that she has developed for carvings, many of which are related to when she made embroidered dresses.

The most successful artisan is Jacobo Angeles, whose work have been prominently displayed at The Smithsonian and the National Museum of Mexican Art in Chicago. It can also be found in numerous museums, art colleges and galleries in the world. Jacobo learned to carve from his father when he was twelve, and later was mentored by elders in his and other communities. While alebrijes designs have been innovative and incorporating modern elements, the Angeles family&#x27;s designs focus on representations of Zapotec culture. This can be seen in the painted designs, based on influences such as the friezes of Mitla, and other ancient symbols as well as the continued use in aniline paints made from natural ingredients such as the bark of the copal tree, baking soda, lime juice, pomegranate seeds, zinc, indigo, huitlacoche and cochineal. Each year, Jacobo travels the United States to promote Oaxacan folk art in general to educational institution as well as a speaker at art institutions.

=== Arrazola ===

The making of alebrijes in Oaxaca was initially established in Arrazola by Manuel Jimenez. Jimenez began carving wooden figures since he was a boy tending animals in the 1920s. By the late 1950s and early 1960s, Jimenez&#x27;s work was being sold in the city of Oaxaca, which led them to being shown to folk art collectors such as Nelson Rockefeller. By the late 1960s, he was giving exhibitions in museums in Mexico City and the United States and tourists began visiting his workshop in the 1970s. He kept his carving techniques strictly within the family with only his sons and a son in law carving with him. For this reason, only six families were carving alebrijes in Arrazola as late as 1985. Jimenez died in 2005. Today, Jimenez&#x27;s works fetch a minimum of US$100.

Many carvers and carving communities engage in specialties in order to have niches in the more competitive alebrije market in Oaxaca. In Arrazola, one of the community&#x27;s specialty is the carving of complex animal bodies, especially iguanas out of one single piece of wood. Another way the community competes is through its annual festival &quot;Cuna de los Alebrijes&quot; (Cradle of the Alebrijes), which is held each year to promote its figures. This fair is cosponsored by the Secretary of Tourism for the state of Oaxaca. It occurs in the second half of December, during the Christmas season, with more than sixty artisans who make the figures. The goals are to draw more tourists to the town at this time and to make connections with stores, galleries and museums.

Like Tilcajete, Arrazola has a number of well known artisans. Marcelo Hernandez Vasquez and his sisters have been making alebrijes for eighteen years, and Juan Carlos Santiago is sought out for his penguins. Antonio Aragon makes small, finely carved, realistic deer, dogs, lions and cats, and Sergio Aragon specializes in miniatures.

One of the best known is Miguel Santiago, who sells about forty pieces a year. Some of these sales are individual pieces and others are multiple sets such as Frida Kalo surrounded by monkeys. Sets are usually sold to foreign buyers for between US$300 and $800 and have been sent to Europe, Japan and the United States. Sets often take more than a month to make and his work is considered to be in the high end of the market. Santiago&#x27;s orders extend more than two years in advance. Santiago used to work with a brother and later with a nephew, but today he works mostly solo with his father to help. Another of the best known is one of the few female entrepreneurs in the market, Olga Santiago. She does not carve or paint, rather she hires others to do the work while she administrates. However, she signs all the pieces. Many of her carvers and painters are young men who leave quickly to form workshops of their own. While her workshop is not the only one run in this manner, hers is the newest and most successful. Olga&#x27;s client base is tourists, which are often brought to her by tour guides, taxi drivers and the like for a commission, and wholesalers.

=== La Unión Tejalapan ===
La Union Tejalapan has not had the same success as Arrazola and Tilcajete because they have not been able to attract as many dealers or tourists. A significant market remains for simple rustic pieces (pre-alebrije) and pieces painted with traditional aniline paints, which La Union specializes in. These are popular with those seeking non alebrije pieces such as saints, angels, devils, skeletons and motifs related to Day of the Dead. Alebrije pieces are also made, but are painted simply with one or two colors with few decorations. La Union artisans make multipiece rodeos, fiestas, and nativity scenes. Another rustic aspect to La Union pieces is that legs can be nailed onto the torsos. The first alebrije carver from La union was Martin Santiago. In the 1950s and 1960s, Santiago worked in the United States for various periods working as an agricultural laborer in the Bracero Program. When this program ended, Santiago found that he could not support his family by farming and began selling woodcarvings to a shop owner in Oaxaca. This arrangement ended after a complex dispute. Santiago then began carving and selling on his own with his four brothers and for many years the Santiago family was the only carvers in the community.

Today there are a number of others involved in the craft. Aguilino Garcia sells fairly expensive skunks, crocodiles, armadillos, and palm trees. He has a reputation for working slowing but makes pieces that were selling for between 100 and 400 pesos in 1998. Better known is the husband and wife team of Reynaldo Santiago and Elodia Reyes, who have been carving since their marriage in the mid-1970s. Reynaldo is a nephew of Martin Santiago. Like in many other carving families, he carves while she paints. Their children are not involved in their business. While the couple make some large and medium-sized pieces, they specialize in miniatures (around seven cm), such as dogs, cats, giraffes, rabbits and goats which will for around 30 pesos each. Because La Union gets few tourists, the couple is mostly reliant on the store owners and wholesalers who buy from them. Today their major buyers are a wholesaler in California and a store owner in Texas.

== Other parts of Mexico ==
Outside of Mexico City and Oaxaca, alebrijes are known and made but mostly as a hobby rather than as a significant source of work. Most of these alebrijes are made with papier-mâché, wire, cardboard and sometimes with other materials such as cloth. Alebrije workshops and exhibitions have been held in Cancún. Workshops on the making of alebrijes with the purpose of selling them have been held in Cuautla, Morelos. In Tampico, workshops are given by Omar Villanueva. He has also given workshops in Nuevo Laredo, Campeche, Cancun, Playa del Carmen, Chetumal, Querétero and other places.

One alebrije craftsman in Cuautla is Marcos Zenteno, who has taught the craft to his daughter. He also gives workshops on the making of the craft to others. One of the major attractions at the Primer Festival Internacional de las Artes in Saltillo in 2000 were alebrijes, which came from workshops from Monclova, Sabinas, Parras de la Fuente and Saltillo.

== Illuminated alebrijes ==

An innovation in alebrijes are versions which are lighted, generally designed to be carried by a single person on the shoulders. Instead of cartonería, these alebrijes are made on movable metal frames, with LED lights, and with cloth or plastic skin. Preferred materials for the structure include ecological fabrics and micro-papers, assembled together before the alebrijes are fully painted and varnished for exhibition.

This style of alebrije was first presented at a short parade dedicated to them in 2014 in Colonia Roma. These versions have been made in Mexico City by various artists, especially in workshops such as the Fábrica de Artes y Oficios Oriente. Exhibitions dedicated to the variation have attracted up to 6,000 people to the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City and have been displayed at Mexico International Festival of Lights.

<doc id="1029428" wikidata="Q5191739" url="?curid=1029428" title="Lily Yeats">
<text>Susan Mary Yeats (; 25 August 1866 – 5 January 1949), known as Lily Yeats, was an embroiderer associated with the Celtic Revival. In 1908 she founded the embroidery department of Cuala Industries, with which she was involved until its dissolution in 1931. She is known for her embroidered pictures.

==Early life and education==
Born in Enniscrone, County Sligo, Ireland on 25 August 1866, she was the daughter of John Butler Yeats and Susan Yeats (née Pollexfen). Her siblings were William Butler, Jack and Elizabeth Yeats. She was a sick child. Susan brought the children every year on holidays to her parents recently acquired home at Merville (1965) just outside the town of Sligo, sometimes staying til Christmas. The longest time was from July 1872 until November 1874, during which time John Butler often joined them. The maternal grandparents were William Pollexfen and Elizabeth (nee Middleton). In late 1874 the Yeats family moved to 14 Edith Villas, West Kensington, London. Whilst living there, Yeats and her siblings were educated by a governess, Martha Jowitt until 1876. In 1878, the family moved to a larger house in Bedford Park, Chiswick, where she attended Notting Hill school for a short time.The Yeats family moved to Howth, County Dublin in 1881, where Lily enrolled in the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art along with her sister Elizabeth in 1883. They also took classes in the Royal Dublin Society.

The Yeats family moved to Eardley Crescent, South Kensington, Yeats became ill and was sent to live with relatives. She eventually went to live with her aunt Elizabeth Pollexfen Orr and her invalided mother in Huddersfield in 1887. In 1888, she returned to the family home in 3 Blenheim Road, Bedford Park. From here, the family often visited with William Morris at Kelmscott House. Money was tight, and Lily was offered an opportunity to learn embroidery in the style propounded by Morris, which would become known as art needlework. She attended the Chiswick School of Art with her sister Susan and brother Jack and also studied under Morris&#x27;s daughter May, who ran the embroidery section of Morris &amp; Co. and worked there until April 1894 when she left due to ill health. She worked for a time as a governess at Hyère in the south of France. Whilst there, she contracted typhoid, and returned to London in December 1896. From late 1897, writer Susan L. Mitchell lodged with the Yeats family, when Yeats and Mitchell became close friends. By 10 December 1888 Yeats had returned to Morris &amp; Co. and was paid ten shillings for her first week&#x27;s work for the firm. By March 1889 Lily was training embroideresses for the firm.

==Career==

Lily continued to work under May Morris for six years, but their relationship was strained (she called her employer &quot;the Gorgon&quot; in her scrapbook) In 1895, Lily caught typhoid fever while in France, and her health remained uncertain for the remainder of the decade. After their mother&#x27;s death in 1900, Lily and her sister Elizabeth returned to Ireland with their friend Evelyn Gleeson. By this time Lily had also assumed the guardianship of her teenage cousin Ruth Pollexfen, a talented embroiderer in her own right. In 1902 the sisters and Gleeson founded a craft studio near Dublin which they named Dun Emer (the Fort of Emer) after Emer, the wife of Irish legendary hero Cuchullain. Dun Emer became a focus of the burgeoning Irish Arts and Crafts Movement, focusing on embroidery, printing, and rug and tapestry-making. They recruited young local women to the enterprise, teaching them painting, drawing, cooking, sewing, and the Irish language in addition to the Guild&#x27;s core crafts. Lily Yeats ran the embroidery department, which created textiles for church decoration and domestic use.

In 1904, the operation was reorganized into two parts, the Dun Emer Guild run by Gleeson and Dun Emer Industries under the direction of the Yeats sisters, and in 1908 the groups separated completely. Gleeson retained the Dun Emer name, and the Yeats sisters established Cuala Industries at nearby Churchtown, which ran a small press, the Cuala Press, and an embroidery workshop. William Butler Yeats&#x27;s wife George (Bertha Georgina), helped Lily run the embroidery arm of the studio which produced clothing and linens.The Yeats sisters lived together through their adult lives, albeit contentiously. In 1923, Lily fell dangerously ill with what was believed to be tuberculosis while on holiday in London, and her brother lodged her in a London nursing home in July, where she remained until the following April. On her recovery, she returned to Cuala, but the embroidery department was never a resounding success. Lily&#x27;s health deteriorated again in 1931 (her ailment had finally been correctly diagnosed as a malformed thyroid in 1929), and the decision was made to dissolve the embroidery branch of Cuala. At the time, Lily wrote
Lily Yeats continued to sell embroidered pictures in the following years. She died in 1949.

<doc id="1029436" wikidata="Q1337446" url="?curid=1029436" title="Jason Kreis">
<text>Jason Clarence Kreis (born December 29, 1972) is an American soccer coach and former player who is the director of operations and special projects for Major League Soccer side Real Salt Lake and the former head coach of the United States under-23 team. From 2021 to 2023, he also served as an assistant coach for MLS club Inter Miami. He coached Orlando City SC in Major League Soccer and was previously an assistant coach under Jürgen Klinsmann for the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team. Prior to that he was the head coach of New York City FC and Real Salt Lake.

Kreis spent the majority of his playing career in Major League Soccer in the United States, initially with the Dallas Burn, and later with Real Salt Lake. In total he made over 300 professional appearances, was Major League Soccer MVP in 1999, and is currently tied for the fifth highest scorer in MLS regular season history, with 108 goals. He also earned fourteen international caps for the United States national team. At one point in his playing career, he was the all-time leading scorer in MLS history.

== Early life ==
Kreis played for the Gladiator Soccer Club in his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska, where his parents were among the pioneers who established this first premier/select club within the state. As a freshman at Burke High School in Omaha, Kreis was selected First Team All-State. He remains the only freshman selected to the first team. Following his freshman year, Kreis and his family moved to Mandeville, Louisiana, where he led Mandeville High School to several Class 5A state soccer tournaments, but never won a state title, losing to Lafayette High, led by stars Shammi Gupta and Wayne Shullaw, in the quarterfinals his senior year. While at Mandeville, he was also a standout performer for the Baton Rouge United Jags, a U-19 Select team that finished as national runner-up in 1991 and won the prestigious Capital Cup tournament in Washington, D.C.

He played collegiately at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. A first team All-America pick in 1993 and 1994, Kreis finished his college career with 39 goals and 38 assists, ranking fifth all-time in scoring.

== Club career ==

=== Minor leagues ===
In 1993, Kreis played during the summer for the Raleigh Flyers of the USISL. In the summer of 1994, he returned to Louisiana to play for the New Orleans Riverboat Gamblers, also of the USISL. After finishing his collegiate eligibility in 1994, Kreis signed his first professional contract with the Raleigh Flyers in the spring of 1995.

=== Dallas Burn ===
On August 1, 1995, Kreis signed a contract with Major League Soccer as the league prepared for its inaugural season. Kreis was drafted forty-third overall by the Dallas Burn in the fifth round of the MLS Inaugural Draft. He scored the first goal in Burn history. In 1999, Kreis was the first American-born player to be named league MVP after he led the league in points and goals, and also registered the first 15-goal, 15-assist season in league history. The five-time all-star led his team in goals five times and in points four times.

On June 26, 2004, Kreis scored his eighty-ninth league goal against D.C. United, moving past Roy Lassiter to the top of the league&#x27;s all-time goal-scoring chart. Kreis remained the MLS all time goalscoring leader for more than three years until Jaime Moreno surpassed his record on August 22, 2007. He ended his ninth MLS season with career totals of 91 goals and 65 assists for 247 points, plus added four goals and two assists in the playoffs. He remains Dallas&#x27; all-time leader in games played (247), goals (91), assists (65), and points (247).

=== Real Salt Lake ===

On November 17, 2004, Kreis was traded to expansion team Real Salt Lake, becoming the first player in the club&#x27;s history. Kreis scored the first goal in Salt Lake&#x27;s history in its second match, a 3–1 loss to the Los Angeles Galaxy. In doing so, he became the first player in league history to do so for two different teams, as he scored the inaugural goal for Dallas in 1996 as well.

On August 13, 2005, he became the first player in MLS history to score 100 career league goals, during a 4–2 loss to the Kansas City Wizards. The achievement was unexpected from observers, especially out of a 1996 class that included other candidates like Eric Wynalda, Brian McBride, or Joe-Max Moore; Kreis had never been considered a particularly dangerous goalscorer and had only lead the league in scoring once, in 1999.

Kreis was left unprotected in the 2006 MLS Expansion Draft by Real Salt Lake and subsequently chosen by Toronto FC. He was reacquired by Salt Lake on November 17, 2006, with the club sending partial allocation money to Toronto in exchange.

He retired as a player on May 3, 2007, to take over as head coach, finishing with 108 career goals. His number (9) was retired by Real Salt Lake in 2011 but was later restored for use by Kreis&#x27;s request.

== International career ==
With only 14 international appearances, Kreis was never able to translate his club success into one with the U.S. national team. He received his first cap on August 30, 1996, against El Salvador at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Kreis scored his only international goal on September 8, 1999, in a 2–2 draw against Jamaica in Kingston.

== Coaching career ==

=== Real Salt Lake ===
On May 3, 2007, Kreis retired from professional competition and was announced as the new head coach of Real Salt Lake, retiring as a player and taking over the coaching reins from John Ellinger. At the time of his hire, Kreis became the youngest active head coach in MLS at 34 years and 127 days. He led Real Salt Lake to its first-post season playoff appearance in 2008 and in 2009 he coached the team to its first MLS Cup championship. Kreis is the youngest coach in MLS history to win the MLS Cup. Following the 2009 MLS Cup win, Kreis would lead Real Salt Lake to playoff appearances in every subsequent season through 2013, including an appearance in the 2013 MLS Cup, which RSL lost to Sporting Kansas City in dramatic fashion on penalty kicks. Kreis also guided Real Salt Lake to a very good CONCACAF Champions League campaign in 2011. Real Salt Lake won Group A and made it all the way to the 2011 CONCACAF Champions League Finals, only to lose to 3–2 on aggregate to C.F. Monterrey.

Real Salt Lake signed Kreis to a contract extension on March 24, 2011, that kept him at the RSL helm through the 2013 season, after which he left RSL to become head coach of New York City FC. Real Salt Lake originally retired Kreis&#x27; number 9 jersey from his playing days, but has since reinstated the number with his permission.

=== New York City ===
On December 11, 2013, Kreis was announced as the first head coach of New York City FC, having reached the end of his contract at Real Salt Lake and declining an extension offer from RSL so he could take the New York City FC position. The move came just four days after he missed out on lifting his second MLS Cup with the Utah team, losing on penalty kicks to Sporting Kansas City. It was revealed in the announcement that his contract, starting on January 1, 2014, would see him begin by traveling to Manchester in England to familiarize himself with the set-up of franchise-owners Manchester City.

Kreis&#x27; inaugural season with NYCFC ended in disappointment. The club finished with a 10–17–7 record in the regular season placing 8th in the Eastern Conference, failing to make the 2015 MLS Cup Playoffs. He and the club parted ways on November 2, 2015.

=== Orlando City ===
On July 19, 2016, Kreis was hired by Orlando City to replace outgoing inaugural coach Adrian Heath. At Orlando City, he reunited with two of his assistant coaches, Miles Joseph and C. J. Brown, and led the club to its first win in two months during his first game in charge.

On June 15, 2018, Kreis was released by Orlando City.

=== United States U-23 ===
On March 19, 2019, Kreis was named head coach of the United States men&#x27;s national under-23 team.

=== Fort Lauderdale ===
On February 15, 2020, Kreis was hired by Inter Miami, to coach their USL League One affiliate Fort Lauderdale.

=== Inter Miami ===
On March 1, 2021, Inter Miami announced that Kreis was to become an assistant coach under Phil Neville. On June 1, 2023, the club announced that it had parted ways with Neville, with Kreis also relieved of his duties.

<doc id="1029440" wikidata="Q7834537" url="?curid=1029440" title="Translation unit">
<text>In the field of translation, a translation unit is a segment of a text which the translator treats as a single cognitive unit for the purposes of establishing an equivalence. It may be a single word, a phrase, one or more sentences, or even a larger unit.

When a translator segments a text into translation units, the larger these units are, the better chance there is of obtaining an idiomatic translation. This is true not only of human translation, but also where human translators use computer-assisted translation, such as translation memories, and when translations are performed by machine translation systems.

== Perceptions on the concept of &quot;unit&quot; ==
Vinay and Darbelnet took to Saussure&#x27;s original concepts of the linguistic sign when beginning to discuss the idea of a single word as a translation unit. According to Saussure, the sign is naturally arbitrary, so it can only derive meaning from contrast in other signs in that same system.

However, Russian scholar Leonid Barkhudarov stated that, limiting it to poetry, for instance, a translation unit can take the form of a complete text. This seems to relate to his conception that a translation unit is the smallest unit in the source language with an equivalent in the target one, and when its parts are taken individually, they become untranslatable; these parts can be as small as phonemes or morphemes, or as large as entire texts.

Susan Bassnett widened Barkhudarov&#x27;s poetry perception to include prose, adding that in this type of translation text is the prime unit, including the idea that sentence-by-sentence translation could cause loss of important structural features.

Swiss linguist Werner Koller connected Barkhudarov&#x27;s idea of unit sizing to the difference between the two languages involved, by stating that the more different or unrelated these languages were, the larger the unit would be.

One final perception on the idea of &quot;unit&quot; came from linguist Eugene Nida. To him, translation units have a tendency to be small groups of language building up into sentences, thus forming what he called &quot;meaningful mouthfuls of language&quot;.

== Points of view towards translation units ==

=== Process-oriented POV ===
According to this point of view, a translation unit is a stretch of text on which attention is focused to be represented as a whole in the target language. In this point of view we can consider the concept of the think-aloud protocol, supported by German linguist Wolfgang Lörscher: isolating units using self-reports by translating subjects. It also relates to how experienced the translator in question is: language learners take a word as a translation unit, whereas experienced translators isolate and translate units of meaning in the form of phrases, clauses or sentences.

Since 1996 and 2005 keylogging and eyetracking technologies were introduced in Translation Process Research. These more advanced and non-invasive research methods made it possible to elaborate a finer-grained assessment of translation units as loops of (source or target text) reading and target text typing. Loops of translation units are thought to be the basic units by which translations are produced. Thus, Malmkjaer, for instance, defines process oriented translation units as a “stretch of the source text that the translator keeps in mind at any one time, in order to produce translation equivalents in the text he or she is creating” (p. 286). Records of keystrokes and eye movements allow to investigate these mental constructs through their physical (observable) behavioral traces in the translation process data. Empirical Translation Process Research has deployed numerous theories to explain and models the behavioral traces of these assumed mental units.

=== Product-oriented POV ===
Here, the target-text unit can be mapped into an equivalent source-text unit. A case study on this matter was reported by Gideon Toury, in which 27 English-Hebrew student-produced translations were mapped onto a source text. Those students that were less experienced had larger numbers of small units at word and morpheme level in their translations, while one student with translation experience had approximately half of those units, mostly at phrase or clause level.

<doc id="1029446" wikidata="Q5162775" url="?curid=1029446" title="Conscription in the United States">
<text>In the United States, military conscription, commonly known as the draft, has been employed by the U.S. federal government in six conflicts: the American Revolutionary War, the American Civil War, World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. The fourth incarnation of the draft came into being in 1940, through the Selective Training and Service Act; this was the country&#x27;s first peacetime draft. 

From 1940 until 1973, during both peacetime and periods of conflict, men were drafted to fill vacancies in the U.S. Armed Forces that could not be filled through voluntary means. Active conscription in the United States ended in January 1973, and the U.S. Armed Forces moved to an all-volunteer military except for draftees called up through the end of 1972. Conscription remains in place on a contingency basis, however, in that all male U.S. citizens, even those residing abroad, and all male immigrants, whether documented or undocumented but residing within the United States, are required to register with the Selective Service System (SSS) between the ages of 18 and 25. Failure to register for the SSS, when otherwise required, can mean denial of many federal services, such as federal health care programs. 

Although it has not been applied in recent American history, U.S. federal law continues to allow for compulsory conscription for militia service under emergency or extraordinary security conditions. The law is described in Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution and 10 U.S. Code § 246. Such conscription would apply to able-bodied men between the ages of 17 and 45 who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, U.S. citizens, as well as women in certain health care occupations. Conscription of 17-year-olds is optional and requires parental consent.

Conscription has faced strong opposition throughout American history from prominent figures like Daniel Webster, who stated, &quot;A free government with an uncontrolled power of military conscription is the most ridiculous and abominable contradiction and nonsense that ever entered into the heads of men.&quot;

==History==

===Colonial era to 1862===
In colonial times, the Thirteen Colonies used a militia system for defense. Colonial militia laws—and after independence, those of the United States and the various states—required able-bodied males to enroll in the militia, to undergo a minimum of military training, and to serve for limited periods of time in war or emergency. This earliest form of conscription involved selective drafts of militiamen for service in particular campaigns. Following this system in its essentials, the Continental Congress in 1778 recommended that the states draft men from their militias for one year&#x27;s service in the Continental Army; this first national conscription was irregularly applied and failed to fill the Continental ranks.

For long-term operations, conscription was occasionally used when volunteers or paid substitutes were insufficient to raise the needed manpower. During the American Revolutionary War, the states sometimes drafted men for militia duty or to fill state Continental Army units, but the central government did not have the authority to conscript except for purposes of naval impressment. The 1789 constitution lists among of the enumerated powers of Congress the ability to create its own armies and navy for unlimited purposes, and to fund and regulate state militias that could be called up only for federal law enforcement and domestic defense. The new constitution also made the President of the United States the commander-in-chief of both the federal military and the militia when in federal service. The Second Militia Act of 1792 defined the first group who could be called up as &quot;each and every free able-bodied white male citizen&quot; between the ages of 18 and 45.

During the War of 1812, President James Madison and his Secretary of War James Monroe unsuccessfully attempted to create a national draft of 40,000 men. The proposal was fiercely criticized on the House floor by antiwar Congressman Daniel Webster of New Hampshire.

===Civil War===
The United States first employed national conscription during the American Civil War. The vast majority of troops were volunteers; of the 2,200,000 Union soldiers, about 2% were draftees, and another 6% were substitutes paid by draftees.

The Confederacy had far fewer inhabitants than the Union, and Confederate President Jefferson Davis proposed the first conscription act on March 28, 1862; it was passed into law the next month. Resistance was both widespread and violent, with comparisons made between conscription and slavery.

Both sides permitted conscripts to hire substitutes to serve in their place. In the Union, many states and cities offered bounties and bonuses for enlistment. They also arranged to take credit against their draft quota by claiming freed slaves who enlisted in the Union Army.

Although both sides resorted to conscription, the system did not work effectively for either. The Confederate Congress on April 16, 1862, passed an act requiring military service for three years from all white males aged 18 to 35 not legally exempt. It later extended the obligation.

The U.S. Congress passed the Militia Act of 1862 which mirrored the 1792 Act except to allow African-Americans to serve in the militias and authorizing a militia draft within a state when it could not meet its quota with volunteers. This state-administered system failed in practice and Congress passed the Enrollment Act of 1863, the first genuine national conscription law, replacing the Militia Act of 1862, which required the enrollment of every male citizen and those immigrants (aliens) who had filed for citizenship, between 20 and 45 years of age, unless exempted by the Act. It set up under the Union Army an elaborate machine for enrolling and drafting men. Quotas were assigned in each state, the deficiencies in volunteers required to be met by conscription.

Still, men drafted could provide substitutes, and until mid-1864 could also avoid service by paying commutation money. Many eligible men pooled their money to cover the cost of any one of them drafted. Families used the substitute provision to select which member should go into the army and which would stay home. Another popular means of procuring a substitute was to pay a soldier whose period of enlistment was about to expire—the advantage of this method was that the Army could retain a trained veteran in place of a raw recruit. Of the 168,649 men procured for the Union Army through the draft, 117,986 were substitutes, leaving 50,663 who had their personal services conscripted. There was much evasion and overt resistance to the draft, and the New York City draft riots were in direct response to the draft and were the first large-scale resistance against the draft in the United States.

The problem of Confederate desertion was aggravated by the inequitable inclinations of conscription officers and local judges. The three conscription acts of the Confederacy exempted certain categories, such as the planter class. Enrollment officers and local judges often practiced favoritism, sometimes accepting bribes. Attempts to effectively deal with the issue were frustrated by conflict between state and local governments on the one hand and the national government of the Confederacy.

During the Civil War, there were critics against the policy of conscription. For example, Frederick Douglass, an escaped slave and abolitionist strongly advocated against the policy. Douglass asserted, &quot;What is freedom? It is the right to choose one&#x27;s own employment. Certainly it means that, if it means anything. And when any individual or combination of individuals, undertakes to decide for any man when he shall work, where he shall work, at what he shall work, and for what he shall work, he or they practically reduce him to slavery.&quot;

===National Guard===
The Militia Act of 1903 reorganized the federally supported state militias as the National Guard, aligning their training with active duty needs so they could be quickly put into federal service.

In 1933, Congress reorganized the National Guard under its Article I enumerated power to &quot;raise and support armies&quot; instead of its power to &quot;Provide for organizing, arming and disciplining the Militia&quot;. This avoids the constraint on federal militia service that it can only be used &quot;to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions.&quot;

Able-bodied men between the ages of 17 and 45 outside of the National Guard are defined in the Militia Act and under the laws of some states as the unorganized militia, which may be called into state or federal service as needed.

===World War I===
In 1917, the administration of President Woodrow Wilson decided to rely primarily on conscription, rather than voluntary enlistment, to raise military manpower for World War I when only 73,000 volunteers enlisted out of the initial 1 million target in the first six weeks of the war. One ascribed motivation was to thwart former president Theodore Roosevelt, who proposed raising a volunteer division, which would have upstaged Wilson. However, there is no evidence that Roosevelt had enough support to carry out that plan, and because Wilson had just started his second term, the former President&#x27;s prospects for substantial political gain seemed dubious.

The Selective Service Act of 1917 was carefully drawn to remedy the defects in the Civil War system and—by allowing exemptions for dependency, essential occupations, and religious scruples—to place each man in his proper niche in a national war effort. The act established a &quot;liability for military service of all male citizens&quot;; authorized a selective draft of all those between 21 and 31 years of age (later from 18 to 45); and prohibited all forms of bounties, substitutions, or purchase of exemptions. Administration was entrusted to local boards composed of leading civilians in each community. These boards issued draft calls in order of numbers drawn in a national lottery and determined exemptions.

In 1917, 10 million men were registered. This was deemed to be inadequate, so age ranges were increased and exemptions reduced, and so by the end of 1918 this increased to 24 million men that were registered with nearly 3 million inducted into the military services, with little of the resistance that characterized the Civil War, thanks to a well-received campaign by the government to increase support for the war, and shut down newspapers and magazines that published articles against the war, but there was resistance in some areas (&quot;see&quot; Green Corn Rebellion).

The draft was universal and included black men on the same terms as whites, although they served in different units. In all 367,710 black Americans were drafted (13% of the total), compared to 2,442,586 White (86.9%). Along with a general opposition to American involvement in a foreign conflict, Southern farmers objected to perceived unfair conscription practices that exempted members of the upper class and industrial workers.

Draft boards were localized and based their decisions on social class: the poorest were the most often conscripted because they were considered the least likely to be the skilled labor needed for the war effort. Poor men were also less likely to convince local boards that they were primary breadwinners who could be deferred to support dependents. Forms of resistance ranged from peaceful protest to violent demonstrations and from humble letter-writing campaigns asking for mercy to newspapers demanding reform. The most common tactics were dodging and desertion, and some communities in isolationist areas even sheltered and defended their draft dodgers as political heroes.

Nearly half a million immigrants were drafted, which forced the military to develop training procedures that took ethnic differences into account. Military leaders invited Progressive reformers and ethnic group leaders to assist in formulating new military policies. The military attempted to socialize and Americanize young immigrant recruits, not by forcing &quot;angloconformity&quot;, but by showing remarkable sensitivity and respect for ethnic values and traditions and a concern for the morale of immigrant troops, with the aim of blending them into the larger society. Sports activities, keeping immigrant groups together, newspapers in various languages, the assistance of bilingual officers, and ethnic entertainment programs were all employed.

====Opposition====

The Conscription Act of 1917 was passed in June. Conscripts were court-martialed by the Army if they refused to wear uniforms, bear arms, perform basic duties, or submit to military authority. Convicted objectors were often given long sentences of 20 years in Fort Leavenworth. In 1918, Secretary of War Newton D. Baker created the Board of Inquiry to question the conscientious objectors&#x27; sincerity. Military tribunals tried men found by the Board to be insincere for a variety of offenses, sentencing 17 to death, 142 to life imprisonment, and 345 to penal labor camps. Many of these sentences were commuted after the war&#x27;s end.

In 1917, a number of radicals and anarchists, including Emma Goldman, tried to challenge the new draft law in federal court, arguing that it was a direct violation of the Thirteenth Amendment&#x27;s prohibition against slavery and involuntary servitude. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the draft act in the Selective Draft Law Cases on January 7, 1918. The decision said the Constitution gave Congress the power to declare war and to raise and support armies. The Court, relying partly on Emerich de Vattel&#x27;s &quot;The Law of Nations&quot;, emphasized the principle of the reciprocal rights and duties of citizens:

Conscription was unpopular from left-wing sectors at the start, with many Socialists jailed for &quot;obstructing the recruitment or enlistment service&quot;. The most famous was Eugene Debs, head of the Socialist Party of America, who ran for president in 1920 from his Atlanta prison cell. He had his sentence commuted to time served and was released by President Warren G. Harding on December 25, 1921. Also notably, the Industrial Workers of the World attempted to obstruct the war effort through strikes in war-related industries and not registering, but it did not meet with large success.

Although draft riots were not widespread, an estimated 171,000 people never registered for the draft, while another 360,000 people never responded to induction orders.

====Conscientious objectors in WWI====
Conscientious objector (CO) exemptions were allowed for the Amish, Mennonites, Quakers, and Church of the Brethren only. All other religious and political objectors were forced to participate. Some 64,700 men claimed conscientious objector status; local draft boards certified 57,000, of whom 30,000 passed the physical and 21,000 were inducted into the U.S. Army. About 80% of the 21,000 decided to abandon their objection and take up arms, but 3,989 drafted objectors refused to serve. Most belonged to historically pacifist denominations, especially Quakers, Mennonites, and Moravian Brethren, as well as a few Seventh-day Adventists and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. About 15% were religious objectors from non-pacifist churches.

Ben Salmon was a nationally known political activist who encouraged men not to register and personally refused to comply with the draft procedures. He rejected the Army Review Board proposal that he perform noncombatant farm work. Sentenced to 25 years in prison, he again refused a proposed desk job. He was pardoned and released in November 1920 with a &quot;dishonorable discharge&quot;.

===Interwar===
The draft ended in 1918, but the Army designed the modern draft mechanism in 1926 and built it based on military needs, despite an era of pacifism. Working where Congress would not, it gathered a cadre of officers for its nascent Joint Army-Navy Selective Service Committee, most of whom were commissioned based on social standing rather than military experience. This effort did not receive congressionally approved funding until 1934, when Major General Lewis B. Hershey was assigned to the organization. The passage of a conscription act was opposed by some, including Dorothy Day and George Barry O&#x27;Toole, who were concerned that such conscription would not provide adequate protection for the rights of conscientious objectors. However, much of Hershey&#x27;s work was codified into law with the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 (STSA).

===World War II===

In the summer of 1940, after Nazi Germany conquered France, Americans supported the return of conscription. One national survey found that 67% of respondents believed that a German-Italian victory would endanger the United States, and that 71% supported &quot;the immediate adoption of compulsory military training for all young men&quot;. Similarly, a November 1942 survey of American high-school students found that 69% favored compulsory postwar military training.

The World War I system served as a model for that of World War II. President Roosevelt&#x27;s signing of the Selective Training and Service Act on September 16, 1940, began the first peacetime draft in the United States. The 1940 law instituted conscription in peacetime, requiring the registration of all men between 21 and 35. It also reestablished the Selective Service System as an independent agency responsible for identifying young men and facilitating their military service. Roosevelt named Lewis B. Hershey to head the System on July 31, 1941; he remained in post until 1969. This act came when other preparations, such as increased training and equipment production, had not yet been approved. Nevertheless, it served as the basis for the conscription programs that continue to the present.

The act set a cap of 900,000 men to be in training at once, and limited military service to 12 months unless Congress deemed it necessary to extend such service in the interest of national defense. An amendment added 18 more months to this service period on August 18, 1941. After the Pearl Harbor attack the STSA was further amended (December 19, 1941), extending the term of service to the duration of the war plus six months and requiring the registration of all men 18 to 64 years of age. During World War II, 49 million men were registered, 36 million classified, and 10 million inducted. 18- and 19-year-olds were made liable for induction on November 13, 1942. By late 1942, the Selective Service System moved away from a national lottery to administrative selection by its more than 6,000 local boards.

On December 5, 1942, presidential Executive Order 9279 closed voluntary enlistment for all men from the ages of 18 to 37 for the duration of the war, providing protection for the nation&#x27;s home front manpower pool. The Navy and Marine Corps began procuring their personnel through the Selective Service System in early 1943. The Navy and Marine Corps enlisted inductees and volunteers under the same service agreements, but with different service obligations, while the Army placed wartime inductees and volunteers into a special service component known as the Army of the United States, commonly known as the &quot;AUS&quot;; service commitments were set at the length of the war plus six months.

Paul V. McNutt, head of the War Manpower Commission, estimated that the changes would increase the ratio of men drafted from one out of nine to one out of five. The commission&#x27;s goal was to have nine million men in the armed forces by the end of 1943. This facilitated the massive requirement of up to 200,000 men per month and would remain the standard for the length of the war.

The World War II draft operated from 1940 until 1946 when further inductions were suspended, and its legislative authorization expired without further extension by Congress in 1947. During this time, more than 10 million men had been inducted into military service. However, the Selective Service System remained intact.

====Opposition====
Draft evasion accounted for about 4% of the total inducted. About 373,000 alleged evaders were investigated with just over 16,000 being imprisoned. Opposition was nonetheless encountered, especially in the northern cities where some African-Americans protested the system. The Nation of Islam was at the forefront, with many Black Muslims jailed for refusing the draft, and their leader Elijah Muhammad was sentenced to federal prison for 5 years for inciting draft resistance. Organized draft resistance also developed in the Japanese American internment camps, where groups like the Heart Mountain Fair Play Committee refused to serve unless they and their families were released. 300 Nisei men from eight of the ten War Relocation Authority camps were arrested and stood trial for felony draft evasion; most were sentenced to federal prison. American Communists also opposed the war by forming the &quot;American Peace Committee&quot;, which tried to organize a coalition of anti-war groups. This lasted until Germany attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941, whereupon they changed the committee&#x27;s name to the &quot;American People&#x27;s Committee&quot; and supported aid to Britain, the draft and other preparations for war.

====Conscientious objectors in WWII====
Of the more than 72,000 men registering as conscientious objectors (CO), nearly 52,000 received CO status. Of these, over 25,000 entered the military in noncombatant roles, another 12,000 went to the Civilian Public Service program, and nearly 6,000 went to prison.

===Early Cold War and Korean War===
The second peacetime draft began with passage of the Selective Service Act of 1948 after the STSA expired. The new law required all men of age 18 to 26 to register. It also created the system for the &quot;Doctor Draft&quot;, aimed at inducting health professionals into military service. Unless otherwise exempted or deferred (see Berry Plan), these men could be called for up to 21 months of active duty and five years of reserve duty service. Congress further tweaked this act in 1950 although the post–World War II surplus of military manpower left little need for draft calls until President Truman&#x27;s declaration of a national emergency in December 1950. Only 20,348 men were inducted in 1948 and only 9,781 in 1949.

Between the Korean War&#x27;s outbreak in June 1950 and the armistice agreement in 1953, Selective Service inducted over 1.5 million men. Another 1.3 million volunteered, usually choosing the Navy or Air Force. Congress passed the Universal Military Training and Service Act in 1951 to meet the demands of the war. It lowered the induction age to 18½ and extended active-duty service commitments to 24 months. Despite the early combat failures and later stalemate in Korea, the draft has been credited by some as playing a vital role in turning the tide of war. A February 1953 Gallup Poll showed that 70 percent of Americans surveyed felt that the SSS had handled the draft fairly. Gallup reported that 64 percent of the demographic group including all draft age men (males 21 to 29) believed the draft to be fair.

To improve equity in the system, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed an executive order on July 11, 1953, that ended the paternity deferment for married men. In large part, the change in the draft served the purposes of the burgeoning Cold War. From a program that had just barely passed Congressional muster during the fearful prelude to World War II, a more robust draft continued as fears now focused on the Soviet threat. Nevertheless, some dissenting voices in Congress continued to advocate for voluntary military service.

The onset of the Cold War coincided with men born during the Great Depression beginning to reach military age. Hershey and other supporters of the draft frequently pointed out that the Depression had resulted in a substantial reduction of the birth rate in order to back up their doubts regarding the return to an all-volunteer military at a time when it was known that the number of men reaching military age was going to fall significantly. The Korean War era marked the first time that any form of student deferment had been used. During the Korean War, a student carrying at least 12 semester hours was spared until the end of his current semester.

Though the United States signed the Korean War Armistice on July 27, 1953, technology brought new promises and threats. American air and nuclear power fueled the Eisenhower doctrine of &quot;massive retaliation.&quot; This strategy demanded more machines and fewer foot soldiers, so the draft slipped to the back burner. However, SSS director Gen. Hershey urged caution, fearing the conflict looming in Vietnam. In May 1953, he told his state directors to do everything possible to keep the SSS alive in order to meet expected needs.

Following the 1953 Korean War Armistice, Congress passed the Reserve Forces Act of 1955 with the aim of improving National Guard and federal Reserve Component readiness while also constraining its use by the president. Toward this end, it mandated a six-year service commitment, in a combination of reserve and active duty time, for every line military member regardless of their means of entry. Meanwhile, the SSS kept itself alive by devising and managing a complex system of deferments for a swelling pool of candidates during a period of shrinking requirements. The greatest challenge to the draft came not from protesters but from lobbyists seeking additional deferments for their constituent groups such as scientists and farmers.

Many government leaders felt that the potential for a draft was a critical element in maintaining a constant flow of volunteers. On numerous occasions, General Hershey told Congress that for every man drafted, three or four more were scared into volunteering. Assuming that his assessment was accurate, this would mean that more than 11 million men volunteered for service because of the draft between January 1954 and April 1975.

The policy of using the draft to incentivize voluntary enlistment was unique in American history. Previous drafts had not aimed to encourage individuals to enlist in order to gain preferential placement or less dangerous postings. However, the incremental buildup of the Vietnam War without a clear threat to the country bolstered this focus. Some estimates suggest that almost one-third of all eligible men were conscripted during the period of 1965–69. This group represented those without exemption or resources to avoid military service. During the active combat phase, the possibility of avoiding combat by selecting their service and military specialty led as many as four out of 11 eligible men to enlist. The military relied upon draft-induced volunteerism to meet its quotas, especially for the Army, which accounted for nearly 95% of all inductees during the Vietnam War era. For example, defense recruiting reports show that 34% of the recruits in 1964, up to 50% in 1970, indicated that they had joined voluntarily in order to avoid placement uncertainty via the draft. These rates dwindled to 24% in 1972 and 15% in 1973 after the change to a lottery system. Accounting for other factors, it can be argued up to 60% of those who served throughout the Vietnam War era did so directly or indirectly because of the draft.

In addition, deferments provided an incentive for men to follow pursuits considered useful to the state. This process, known as channeling, helped push men into educational, occupational, and family choices that they might not otherwise have pursued. Undergraduate degrees were valued. Graduate work had varying value over time, though technical and religious training received nearly constant support. War-industry support in the form of teaching, research, or skilled labor also received deferred or exempt status. Finally, married and family men were exempted because of the positive social consequences. This included using presidential orders to extend exemptions again to fathers and others. Channeling was also seen as a means of preempting the early loss of the country&#x27;s &quot;best and brightest&quot; who had historically joined and died early in war.

In the only extended period of military conscription of U.S. males during a major peacetime period, the draft continued on a more limited basis during the late 1950s and early 1960s. While a far smaller percentage of eligible males were conscripted than in war periods, draftees by law served in the Army for two years. Elvis Presley and Willie Mays were two of the most famous people drafted during this period.

Public protests in the United States were few during the Korean War. However, the percentage of CO exemptions for inductees grew to 1.5%, compared to a rate of just .5% in the past two wars. The Justice Department also investigated more than 80,000 draft-evasion cases.

===Vietnam War===


President Kennedy&#x27;s decision to send military troops to Vietnam as advisors was a signal that Selective Service Director Lewis B. Hershey needed to visit the Oval Office. From that visit emerged two wishes of JFK with regard to conscription. The first was that the names of married men with children should occupy the very bottom of the callup list. Just above them should be the names of men who were married. This policy was implemented in practice, but was not encoded into statute by Congress. Men who fit into these categories became known as Kennedy Husbands.

Many early rank-and-file anti-conscription protesters had been allied with the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy. The signing in 1963 of the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty left them free to focus on other issues. Syndicated cartoonist Al Capp portrayed them as S.W.I.N.E. (Students Wildly Indignant About Nearly Everything). Protest activity increased after the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution.

Consequently, there was some opposition to the draft even before the major U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War began. The large cohort of Baby Boomers who became eligible for military service during the Vietnam War allowed a steep increase in the number of exemptions and deferments, especially for college students. Besides being able to avoid the draft, college graduates who volunteered for military service (primarily as commissioned officers) had a much better chance of securing a preferential posting compared to less-educated inductees. Contrary to popular belief, the large majority of American soldiers who participated in the war, and who were killed in combat, were in fact volunteers and not draftees.

As U.S. troop strength in South Vietnam increased, more young men were drafted for service there, and many of those still at home sought means of avoiding the draft. Since only 15,000 National Guard and Reserve soldiers were sent to South Vietnam, enlistment in the Guard or the Reserves became a popular means of avoiding serving in a war zone. For those who could meet the more stringent enlistment standards, service in the Air Force, Navy, or Coast Guard was a means of reducing the chances of being killed. Vocations to the ministry and the rabbinate soared, because divinity students were exempt from the draft. Doctors and draft board members found themselves being pressured by relatives or family friends to exempt potential draftees.

The marriage deferment ended suddenly on August 26, 1965. Around 3:10 pm, President Johnson signed an order allowing the draft of men who married after midnight that day, then around 5 pm, he announced the change for the first time. This caused a last-minute rush to the altar by thousands of American couples.

Some conscientious objectors objected to the war based on the theory of Just War. One of these, Stephen Spiro, was convicted of avoiding the draft, but given a suspended sentence of five years. He was later pardoned by President Gerald Ford.

Between 1964 and 1973, 9,087,000 men and women would serve in the armed forces in some capacity. Of these, 2,594,000 would be deployed to Vietnam. 1,766,910 would be drafted into the military serving throughout the world. Most of those who were drafted went into the Army and less than 42,700 went into the Marine Corps. The Navy and Air Force did not accept draftees.

From a pool of approximately 27 million, the draft raised 2,215,000 men for military service (in the United States, South Vietnam, and elsewhere) during the Vietnam War era. The majority of service members deployed to South Vietnam were volunteers, even though hundreds of thousands of men opted to join the Army, Air Force, Navy, and Coast Guard (for three or four year terms of enlistment). If drafted, they would only serve for two years, but would have no choice over their military occupational specialty.

Of the nearly 16 million men not engaged in active military service, 96% were exempted (typically because of jobs including other military service), deferred (usually for educational reasons), or disqualified (usually for physical and mental deficiencies but also for criminal records including draft violations). The requirements for obtaining and maintaining an educational deferment changed several times in the late 1960s. For several years, students were required to take an annual qualification test. In 1967 educational deferments were changed for graduate students. Those starting graduate studies in the fall of 1967 were given two semester deferments becoming eligible in June 1968. Those further along in their graduate study who entered prior to the summer of 1967 could continue to receive a deferment until they completed their studies. Peace Corps Volunteers were no longer given deferments and their induction was left to the discretion of their local boards. However most boards allowed Peace Corps Volunteers to complete their two-year assignment before inducting them into the military. On December 1, 1969, a lottery was held to establish a draft priority for all those born between 1944 and 1950. Those with a high number no longer had to be concerned about the draft. Nearly 500,000 men were disqualified for criminal records, but fewer than 10,000 of them were convicted of draft violations. Finally, as many as 100,000 eligible men fled the country.

===End of conscription===
During the 1968 presidential election, Richard Nixon campaigned on a promise to end the draft. He had become interested in the idea of an all-volunteer army during his time out of office, based upon a paper by Martin Anderson of Columbia University, and in part due to the efforts of ardent anti-draft activist-economist and Nobel laureate, Milton Friedman. Friedman has been quoted in interviews as stating: 
Nixon also saw ending the draft as an effective way to undermine the anti-Vietnam War movement since he believed affluent youths would stop protesting the war once their own probability of having to fight in it was gone. There was opposition to the all-volunteer notion from both Congress and the Department of Defense, so Nixon didn&#x27;t take immediate action toward ending the draft early in his presidency.

Instead, the Gates Commission was formed, headed by Thomas S. Gates, Jr., a former Secretary of Defense in the Eisenhower Administration. Gates initially opposed the all-volunteer army idea but changed his mind during the course of the 15-member commission&#x27;s work. The Gates Commission issued its report in February 1970, describing how adequate military strength could be maintained without having conscription. The existing draft law was expiring at the end of June 1971, but the Department of Defense and Nixon administration decided the draft needed to continue for at least some time. In February 1971, the administration requested Congress to extend the draft for two years, to June 1973.

Senatorial opponents of the war wanted to reduce this to a one-year extension, eliminate the draft altogether, or tie the draft renewal to a timetable for troop withdrawal from Vietnam; Senator Mike Gravel of Alaska took the most forceful approach, trying to filibuster the draft renewal legislation, shut conscription down, and directly force an end to the war. Senators supporting Nixon&#x27;s war efforts supported the bill even though some had qualms about ending the draft. After a prolonged battle in the Senate, a September 1971 cloture was achieved over the filibuster, and the draft renewal bill was approved. Meanwhile, military pay was increased as an incentive to attract volunteers, and television advertising for the U.S. Army began. With the end of active U.S. ground participation in Vietnam, December 1972 saw the last men conscripted, who were born in 1952 and earlier.

On February 2, 1972, a drawing was held to determine draft priority numbers for men born in 1953, but in January 1973, Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird announced that no further draft orders would be issued. In March 1973, 1974, and 1975, the Selective Service assigned draft priority numbers for all men born in 1954, 1955, and 1956 in case the draft was extended, but it never was.

Command Sergeant Major Jeff Mellinger, believed to be the last drafted enlisted ranked soldier still on active duty, retired in 2011. Chief Warrant Officer 5 Ralph E. Rigby, the last Vietnam War-era drafted soldier of Warrant Officer rank, retired from the army on November 10, 2014, after a 42-year career.

December 28, 1972, had been scheduled to be the last day that draftees would be inducted that year. However, President Nixon declared that day a national day of mourning due to the death of former President Truman, and Federal offices were closed. Men scheduled to report that day were never inducted since the draft was not resumed in 1973.

===Post-1980 draft registration===

On July 2, 1980, President Jimmy Carter issued Presidential Proclamation 4771 and reinstated the requirement that young men register with the Selective Service System. At that time, it was required that all males, born on or after January 1, 1960, register with the Selective Service System. Those who were now in this category were male U.S. citizens and male immigrant non-citizens between the ages of 18 and 25; they were required to register within 30 days of their 18th birthday even if they were not actually eligible to join the military.

The Selective Service System, still essentially what it was in 1980, describes its mission as &quot;to serve the emergency manpower needs of the Military by conscripting untrained manpower, or personnel with professional healthcare skills, if directed by Congress and the President in a national crisis.&quot; Registration is possible online or by mail. Registration forms are available at U.S. Post Offices.

The Selective Service registration form states that failure to register is a felony punishable by up to five years imprisonment or a $250,000 fine. In practice, though, no one has been prosecuted for failure to comply with draft registration since 1986, in part because prosecutions of draft resisters in the 1980s proved counter-productive for the government, and in part because of the difficulty of proving that noncompliance with the law was &quot;knowing and willful&quot;.

In interviews published in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in May 2016, current and former Selective Service System officials said that in 1988, the Department of Justice and Selective Service agreed to suspend any further prosecutions of nonregistrants. Many men do not register at all, register late, or change addresses without notifying the Selective Service System.

Even in the absence of prosecution, however, failure to register may lead to other consequences. Registration is a requirement for employment by the federal government and some state governments, as well as for receiving various state benefits such as driver&#x27;s licenses. Some collateral sanctions formerly in effect have been repealed: &quot;From 1982 to 2021, males were required to register with Selective Service System to receive Title IV Federal student aid... This requirement was eliminated by the FY 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act... [F]ailing to register with Selective Service System no longer impacts students&#x27; eligibility for Title IV student aid. Effective July 1, 2022, applicants will no longer be able to register with Selective Service System via the FAFSA.&quot;

==Healthcare personnel==

In 1951, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention created the Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS), a two-year program to train doctors, veterinarians, statisticians, and other health workers in epidemiology. Eligible health workers drafted into general military service during the Korean and Vietnam Wars could instead enlist in the EIS to guard against potential biological warfare.

On December 1, 1989, Congress ordered the Selective Service System to put in place a system capable of drafting &quot;persons qualified for practice or employment in a health care and professional occupation&quot;, if such a special-skills draft should be ordered by Congress. In response, Selective Service published plans for the &quot;Health Care Personnel Delivery System&quot; (HCPDS) in 1989 and has had them ready ever since. The concept underwent a preliminary field exercise in Fiscal Year 1998, followed by a more extensive nationwide readiness exercise in Fiscal Year 1999. The HCPDS plans include women and men ages 20–54 in 57 different job categories. As of May 2003, the Defense Department has said the most likely form of draft is a special skills draft, probably of health care workers.

==Legality==

In 1918, the Supreme Court ruled that the World War I draft did not violate the United States Constitution in the &quot;Selective Draft Law Cases&quot;. The Court summarized the history of conscription in England and in colonial America, a history that it read as establishing that the Framers envisioned compulsory military service as a governmental power. It held that the Constitution&#x27;s grant to Congress of the powers to declare war and to raise and support armies included the power to mandate conscription. It rejected arguments based on states&#x27; rights, the 13th Amendment, and other provisions of the Constitution.

Later, during the Vietnam War, a lower appellate court also concluded that the draft was constitutional. &quot;United States v. Holmes&quot;, 387 F.2d 781 (7th Cir.), &quot;cert. denied&quot;, 391 U.S. 936 (1968). Justice William O. Douglas, in voting to hear the appeal in &quot;Holmes&quot;, agreed that the government had the authority to employ conscription in wartime, but argued that the constitutionality of a draft in the absence of a declaration of war was an open question, which the Supreme Court should address.

During the World War I era, the Supreme Court allowed the government great latitude in suppressing criticism of the draft. Examples include &quot;Schenck v. United States&quot;, 249 U.S. 47 (1919) and &quot;Gilbert v. Minnesota&quot;, 254 U.S. 325 (1920). In subsequent decades, however, the Court has taken a much broader view of the extent to which advocacy speech is protected by the First Amendment. Thus, in 1971 the Court held it unconstitutional for a state to punish a man who entered a county courthouse wearing a jacket with the words &quot;Fuck the Draft&quot; visible on it. &quot;Cohen v. California&quot;, 403 U.S. 15 (1971). Nevertheless, protesting the draft by the specific means of burning a draft registration card can be constitutionally prohibited, because of the government&#x27;s interest in prohibiting the &quot;nonspeech&quot; element involved in destroying the card. &quot;United States v. O&#x27;Brien&quot;, 391 U.S. 367 (1968).

Since the reinstatement of draft registration in 1980, the Supreme Court has heard and decided four cases related to the Military Selective Service Act: &quot;Rostker v. Goldberg&quot;, 453 U.S. 57 (1981), upholding the Constitutionality of requiring men but not women to register for the draft; &quot;Selective Service v. Minnesota Public Interest Research Group (MPIRG)&quot;, 468 U.S. 841 (1984), upholding the Constitutionality of the first of the federal &quot;Solomon Amendment&quot; laws, which requires applicants for Federal student aid to certify that they have complied with draft registration, either by having registered or by not being required to register; &quot;Wayte v. United States&quot;, 470 U.S. 598 (1985), upholding the policies and procedures which the Supreme Court thought the government had used to select the &quot;most vocal&quot; nonregistrants for prosecution, after the government refused to comply with discovery orders by the trial court to produce documents and witnesses related to the selection of nonregistrants for prosecution; and &quot;Elgin v. Department of the Treasury&quot;, 567 U.S. 1 (2012), regarding procedures for judicial review of denial of Federal employment for nonregistrants.

In 1981, several men filed lawsuit in the case &quot;Rostker v. Goldberg&quot;, alleging that the Military Selective Service Act violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment by requiring that men only and not also women register with the Selective Service System. The Supreme Court upheld the act, stating that Congress&#x27;s &quot;decision to exempt women was not the accidental byproduct of a traditional way of thinking about women&quot;, that &quot;since women are excluded from combat service by statute or military policy, men and women are simply not similarly situated for purposes of a draft or registration for a draft, and Congress&#x27; decision to authorize the registration of only men therefore does not violate the Due Process Clause&quot;, and that &quot;the argument for registering women was based on considerations of equity, but Congress was entitled, in the exercise of its constitutional powers, to focus on the question of military need, rather than &#x27;equity.

The &quot;Rostker v. Goldberg&quot; opinion&#x27;s dependence upon deference on decision of the executive to exclude women from combat has garnered renewed scrutiny since the Department of Defense announced its decision in January 2013 to do away with most of the federal policies that have kept women from serving in combat roles in ground war situations. Both the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Air Force had by then already opened up virtually all positions in sea and air combat to women. Lawsuits were filed challenging the continued constitutionality of requiring men but not women to register with the Selective Service system: &quot;National Coalition for Men v. Selective Service System&quot; (filed April 4, 2013, U.S. District Court for the Central District of California; dismissed by the District Court July 29, 2013 as not &quot;ripe&quot; for decision; appeal argued December 8, 2015 before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals; reversed and remanded February 19, 2016), and Kyle v. Selective Service System (filed July 3, 2015, U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey), brought on behalf of 17-year-old Elizabeth Kyle-LaBell by her mother, Allison. Elizabeth tried to register, but as a female, was not eligible.

=== &quot;National Coalition for Men v. Selective Service System&quot; ===

In February 2019, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas ruled that male-only conscription registration breached the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s equal protection clause, overturning the previous ruling on the grounds that the policies of the armed forces regarding women had changed significantly, such that they can now be used interchangeably with men. In a case brought by non-profit men&#x27;s rights organisation the National Coalition for Men against the U.S. Selective Service System, judge Gray H. Miller issued a declaratory judgement that the male-only registration requirement is unconstitutional, though did not specify what action the government should take. That decision was reversed by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. A petition for review was then filed with the U.S. Supreme Court. In June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the decision by the Court of Appeals due to the fact that Congress was actively investigating removing the male-only requirement.

==Conscientious objection==

According to the Selective Service System,

The Supreme Court has ruled in cases &quot;United States v. Seeger&quot; (1965) and &quot;Welsh v. United States&quot; (1970) that conscientious objection can be by non-religious beliefs as well as religious beliefs; but it has also ruled in &quot;Gillette v. United States&quot; (1971) against objections to specific wars as grounds for conscientious objection.

There is currently no mechanism to indicate that one is a conscientious objector in the Selective Service system. According to the SSS, after a person is drafted, he can claim conscientious objector status and then justify it before the Local Board. This is criticized because during the times of a draft, when the country is in emergency conditions, there could be increased pressure for Local Boards to be more harsh on conscientious objector claims.

There are two types of status for conscientious objectors. If a person objects only to combat but not to service in the military, then the person could be given noncombatant service in the military without training of weapons. If the person objects to all military service, then the person could be ordered to &quot;alternative service&quot; with a job &quot;deemed to make a meaningful contribution to the maintenance of the national health, safety, and interest&quot;.

==Selective Service reforms==

The Selective Service System has maintained that they have implemented several reforms that would make the draft more fair and equitable.

Some of the measures they have implemented include:
* Before and during the Vietnam War, a young man could get a deferment by showing that he was a full-time student making satisfactory progress toward a degree; now deferment only lasts to the end of the semester. If the man is a senior he can defer until the end of the academic year.
* The government has said that draft boards are now more representative of the local communities in areas such as race and national origin.
* A lottery system would be used to determine the order of people being called up. Previously the oldest men who were found eligible for the draft would be taken first. In the new system, the men called first would be those who are or will turn 20 years old in the calendar year or those whose deferments will end in the calendar year. Following this, men above 20 years will be called in sequence up until their liability ends; eligible men below the 20-year cutoff (i.e. 18 and 19-year-olds) will then be called afterwards, being lowest priority.

==Conscription controversies and proposals since 2003==

The effort to enforce Selective Service registration law was abandoned in 1986. Since then, no attempt to reinstate conscription has been able to attract much support in the legislature or among the public. Since early 2003, when the Iraq War appeared imminent, there had been attempts through legislation and campaign rhetoric to begin a new public conversation on the topic. Public opinion since 1981 has been largely negative.

In 2003, several Democratic congressmen (Charles Rangel of New York, Jim McDermott of Washington, John Conyers of Michigan, John Lewis of Georgia, Pete Stark of California, Neil Abercrombie of Hawaii) introduced legislation that would draft both men and women into either military or civilian government service, should there be a draft in the future. The bill was defeated on October 5, 2004, with two members voting for it and 402 members voting against. Of those who introduced the bill, only Stark voted in support.

This statement was in reference to the U.S. Department of Defense use of &quot;stop-loss&quot; orders, which have extended the Active Duty periods of some military personnel. All enlistees, upon entering the service, volunteer for a minimum eight-year Military Service Obligation (MSO). This MSO is split between a minimum active duty period, followed by a reserve period where enlistees may be called back to active duty for the remainder of the eight years. Some of these active duty extensions have been for as long as two years. The Pentagon stated that as of August 24, 2004, 20,000 Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines had been affected. As of January 31, 2006 it has been reported that more than 50,000 soldiers and reservists had been affected.

Despite arguments by defense leaders that they had no interest in re-instituting the draft, Representative Neil Abercrombie&#x27;s (D-HI) inclusion of a DOD memo in the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; which detailed a meeting by senior leaders signaled renewed interest. Though the conclusion of the meeting memo did not call for a reinstatement of the draft, it did suggest Selective Service Act modifications to include registration by women and self-reporting of critical skills that could serve to meet military, homeland-defense, and humanitarian needs. This hinted at more targeted draft options being considered, perhaps like that of the &quot;Doctor Draft&quot; that began in the 1950s to provide nearly 66% of the medical professionals who served in the Army in Korea. Once created, this manpower tool continued to be used through 1972. The meeting memo gave DOD&#x27;s primary reason for opposing a draft as a matter of cost effectiveness and efficiency. Draftees with less than two years&#x27; retention were said to be a net drain on military resources providing insufficient benefit to offset overhead costs of using them.

Mentions of the draft during the presidential campaign led to a resurgence of anti-draft and draft resistance organizing. One poll of young voters in October 2004 found that 29% would resist if drafted.

In November 2006, Representative Charles B. Rangel (D-NY) again called for the draft to be reinstated; Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi rejected the proposal.

On December 19, 2006, President George W. Bush announced that he was considering sending more troops to Iraq. The next day, the Selective Service System&#x27;s director for operations and chief information officer, Scott Campbell, announced plans for a &quot;readiness exercise&quot; to test the system&#x27;s operations in 2006, for the first time since 1998.

On December 21, 2006, Veterans Affairs Secretary Jim Nicholson, when asked by a reporter whether the draft should be reinstated to make the military more equal, said, &quot;I think that our society would benefit from that, yes sir.&quot; Nicholson proceeded to relate his experience as a company commander in an infantry unit which brought together soldiers of different socioeconomic backgrounds and education levels, noting that the draft &quot;does bring people from all quarters of our society together in the common purpose of serving&quot;. Nicholson later issued a statement saying he does not support reinstating the draft.

On August 10, 2007, with National Public Radio on &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, Lieutenant General Douglas Lute, National Security Adviser to the President and Congress for all matters pertaining to the United States Military efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, expressed support for a draft to alleviate the stress on the Army&#x27;s all-volunteer force. He cited the fact that repeated deployments place much strain upon one soldier&#x27;s family and himself which, in turn, can affect retention.

A similar bill to Rangel&#x27;s 2003 one was introduced in 2007, called the Universal National Service Act of 2007 (H.R. 393), but it has not received a hearing or been scheduled for consideration.

At the end of June 2014 in Pennsylvania, 14,250 letters were erroneously posted to men born in the 19th century calling upon them to register with the Selective Service. This was attributed to a clerk at the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation who failed to select a century during a transfer of 400,000 records to the Selective Service; as a result, the system did not differentiate between men born in 1993 (who would need to register) and those born in 1893 (who would almost certainly be dead). This was compared to the &quot;Year 2000 problem&quot; (&quot;Y2K bug&quot;), in which computer programs that represented years using two digits instead of four digits were expected to have problems beginning in the year 2000. The Selective Service identified 27,218 records of men born in the 19th century made errantly applicable by the change of century and began sending out notices to them on June 30.

On June 14, 2016, the Senate voted to require women to register for the draft, though language requiring this was dropped from later versions of the bill.

In 2020, the bipartisan National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service issued a final report recommending that the military improve enlistment rates through improved outreach and recruiting rather than a renewed draft. However, it also recommended that the U.S. Department of Defense perform regular national mobilization drills to rehearse a recommencement of the draft.

In 2020 and 2021, bills were introduced in Congress either to repeal the Military Selective Service Act or, alternatively, to replace all references to &quot;male&quot; in that act with non-gendered language. Either of these proposals, if enacted, would remove any gender and sex conditionality related to the draft. Neither proposal was enacted.

In 2024, an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025 was proposed that males &quot;between the ages of eighteen and twenty-six, shall be automatically registered&quot; with Selective Service. If enacted, the amendment would enable automatic draft registration using data from other federal databases. Other proposed amendments to the 2025 NDAA included exempting any potential conscripted females from combat assignments during a future draft, removing the registration requirement for federal employees, and requiring Senate confirmation of the Selective Service System Director. None of these proposed amendments were included in the final 2025 NDAA version, aside from an amendment allowing for federal employment of veterans that did not register with Selective Service that provide proof of military service and an amendment &quot;to update the types of information that the Department of Defense may obtain from the Selective Service System&quot; to include &quot;full names, email addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, and mailing addresses furnished.&quot;

==Non-citizens==

The Selective Service (and the draft) in the United States is not limited to citizens. Howard Stringer, for example, was drafted six weeks after arriving from his native Britain in 1965. Today, non-citizen males of appropriate age in the United States, who are permanent residents (holders of green cards), seasonal agricultural workers not holding an H-2A Visa, refugees, parolees, asylees, and illegal immigrants, are required to register with the Selective Service System. Refusal to do so is grounds for denial of a future citizenship application. In addition, immigrants who seek to naturalize as citizens must, as part of the Oath of Citizenship, recite the following:

The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) also allows the recital of a &quot;Modified Oath for Religious or Conscientious Objections&quot; with either or both of the clauses &quot;that I will bear arms on behalf of the United States when required by law; that I will perform noncombatant service in the Armed Forces of the United States when required by law&quot; deleted.

<text>Margaret Oliphant Wilson Oliphant (born Margaret Oliphant Wilson; 4 April 1828 – 20 June 1897) was a Scottish novelist and historical writer, who usually wrote as Mrs. Oliphant. Her fictional works cover &quot;domestic realism, the historical novel and tales of the supernatural&quot;.

==Life==
Margaret was born at Wallyford, near Musselburgh, East Lothian, as the only daughter and youngest surviving child of Margaret Oliphant (c. 1789 – 17 September 1854) and Francis W. Wilson (c. 1788–1858), a clerk. She spent her childhood at Lasswade, Glasgow and Liverpool. Oliphant Gardens, a street in Wallyford, is named after her. As a girl, she continually experimented with writing. She had her first novel published, &quot;Passages in the Life of Mrs. Margaret Maitland&quot;, in 1849. This dealt with the relatively successful Scottish Free Church movement, with which her parents sympathised. Next came &quot;Caleb Field&quot; in 1851, the year she met the publisher William Blackwood in Edinburgh and was invited to contribute to &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; – a tie that continued for her lifetime and covered over 100 articles, including a critique of the character of Arthur Dimmesdale in Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;.

In May 1852, Margaret married her cousin, Frank Wilson Oliphant, at Birkenhead and settled at Harrington Square, now in Camden, London. Her husband was an artist working mainly in stained glass. Three of their six children died in infancy. Her husband developed tuberculosis and for his health they moved in January 1859 to Florence and then to Rome, where he died. This left Oliphant in need of an income. She returned to England and took up literature to support her three surviving children.
She had become a popular writer by then and worked notably hard to sustain her position. Unfortunately, her home life was full of sorrow and disappointment. In January 1864 her one remaining daughter Maggie died in Rome and was buried in her father&#x27;s grave. Her brother, who had emigrated to Canada, was shortly afterwards involved in financial ruin. Oliphant offered a home to him and his children, adding their support to already heavy responsibilities.

In 1866 she settled at Windsor to be near her sons, who were attending Eton. That year, her second cousin, Annie Louisa Walker, came to live with her as a companion-housekeeper. Windsor was her home for the rest of her life. Over more than 30 years she pursued a varied literary career, but personal troubles continued. Her ambitions for her sons remained unfulfilled. Cyril Francis, the elder, died in 1890, leaving a &quot;Life of Alfred de Musset&quot;, incorporated in his mother&#x27;s &quot;Foreign Classics for English Readers&quot;. The younger, Francis (whom she called &quot;Cecco&quot;), collaborated with her in the &quot;Victorian Age of English Literature&quot; and won a position at the British Museum, but was rejected by Sir Andrew Clark, a famous physician. He died in 1894. With the last of her children lost to her, she had little further interest in life. Her health steadily declined and she died at Wimbledon on 20 June 1897. She was buried in Eton beside her sons. She left a personal estate worth a gross £4,932 and a net value £804.

In the 1880s Oliphant acted as literary mentor of the Irish novelist Emily Lawless. During that time, Oliphant wrote several works of supernatural fiction, including a long ghost story &quot;A Beleaguered City&quot; (1880) and several short tales, including &quot;The Open Door&quot; and &quot;Old Lady Mary&quot;. Oliphant also wrote historical fiction. &quot;Magdalen Hepburn&quot; (1854) is set during the Scottish Reformation, and features Mary, Queen of Scots and John Knox as characters.

Oliphant wrote more than 120 works, including novels, books of travel and description, histories, and volumes of literary criticism.

===Biographies===
Oliphant&#x27;s biographies of Edward Irving (1862) and her cousin Laurence Oliphant (1892), together with her life of Sheridan in the &quot;English Men of Letters&quot; series (1883), show vivacity and a sympathetic touch. She also wrote lives of Francis of Assisi (1871), the French historian Count de Montalembert (1872), Dante (1877), Miguel de Cervantes (1880), and the Scottish theologian John Tulloch (1888).

===Historical and critical works===
*&quot;Historical Sketches of the Reign of George II&quot; (1869) (See George II.)
*&quot;The Makers of Florence&quot; (1876)
*&quot;A Literary History of England from 1760 to 1825&quot; (1882)
*&quot;The Makers of Venice&quot; (1887)
*&quot;Royal Edinburgh&quot; (1890)
*&quot;Jerusalem, the Holy City, Its History and Hope&quot; (1891)
*&quot;The Makers of Modern Rome&quot; (1895)
*&quot;William Blackwood and his Sons&quot; (1897)
*&quot;The Sisters Brontë.&quot; In: &quot;Women Novelists of Queen Victoria&#x27;s Reign&quot; (1897)

At the time of her death, Oliphant was still working on &quot;Annals of a Publishing House&quot;, a record of the progress and achievement of the firm of Blackwood, with which she had been so long connected. Her &quot;Autobiography and Letters&quot;, which present a touching picture of her domestic anxieties, appeared in 1899. Only parts were written with a wider audience in mind: she had originally intended the &quot;Autobiography&quot; for her son, but he died before she had finished it.

===Critical reception===
Opinions on Oliphant&#x27;s work are split, with some critics seeing her as a &quot;domestic novelist&quot;, while others recognise her work as influential and important to the Victorian literature canon. Critical reception from Oliphant&#x27;s contemporaries is divided as well. Among those who were not in favour of Oliphant was John Skelton, who took the view that Oliphant wrote too much and too fast. Writing a &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s&quot; article called &quot;A Little Chat About Mrs. Oliphant&quot;, he asked, &quot;Had Mrs. Oliphant concentrated her powers, what might she not have done? We might have had another Charlotte Brontë or another George Eliot.&quot; Not all of the contemporary reception was negative, though. M. R. James admired Oliphant&#x27;s supernatural fiction, concluding that &quot;the religious ghost story, as it may be called, was never done better than by Mrs. Oliphant in &quot;The Open Door&quot; and &quot;A Beleaguered City&quot;&quot;. Mary Butts lauded Oliphant&#x27;s ghost story &quot;The Library Window&quot;, describing it as &quot;one masterpiece of sober loveliness&quot;. Principal John Tulloch praised her &quot;large powers, spiritual insight, and purity of thought, and subtle discrimination of many of the best aspects of our social life and character&quot;.

More modern critics of Oliphant&#x27;s work include Virginia Woolf, who asked in &quot;Three Guineas&quot; whether Oliphant&#x27;s autobiography does not lead the reader &quot;to deplore the fact that Mrs. Oliphant sold her brain, her very admirable brain, prostituted her culture and enslaved her intellectual liberty in order that she might earn her living and educate her children.&quot; However, even modern critics are divided on Oliphant&#x27;s work. Authors Gilbert and Gubar did not include Oliphant in their &quot;Great tradition&quot; of women&#x27;s writing because she did not question or challenge the patriarchy at the time of her life and writing.

===Revival of interest===
Interest in Mrs Oliphant&#x27;s work declined in the 20th century. In the mid-1980s, a small-scale revival was led by the publishers Alan Sutton and Virago Press, centred on the Carlingford series and some similarities of subject-matter with the work of Anthony Trollope.

Penguin Books in 1999 published an edition of &quot;Miss Marjoribanks&quot; (1866). &quot;Hester&quot; (1873) was reissued in 2003 by Oxford World&#x27;s Classics. In 2007–2009, the Gloucester publisher Dodo Press reprinted half a dozen of Oliphant&#x27;s works. In 2010, both the British Library and Persephone Books reissued &quot;The Mystery of Mrs. Blencarrow&quot; (1890), in the latter case with the novella &quot;Queen Eleanor and Fair Rosamund&quot; (1886), and the Association for Scottish Literary Studies produced a new edition of the novel &quot;Kirsteen&quot; (1890).

BBC Radio 4 broadcast four-hour dramatisations of &quot;Miss Marjoribanks&quot; in August/September 1992 and &quot;Phoebe Junior&quot; in May 1995. A 70-minute adaptation of &quot;Hester&quot; was broadcast on Radio 4 in January 2014.

Russell Hoban alludes to Oliphant&#x27;s fiction in his 2003 novel &quot;Her Name Was Lola&quot;.

<doc id="1029459" wikidata="Q7704666" url="?curid=1029459" title="Terry Leahy">
<text>Sir Terence Patrick Leahy (born 28 February 1956) is a British businessman, previously the CEO of Tesco, the largest British retailer and the third-largest retailer in the world measured by revenues. In 2011, he became a senior advisor at private equity company Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice.

He now lives in Cuffley, Hertfordshire, with his wife, Alison, and his three children.

== Early life ==
Born in Belle Vale, Liverpool to Irish immigrants, Leahy grew up in a prefabricated home in Endbrook Road. His father, a merchant seaman, was injured in World War II and worked as a bookmaker to support the family. Leahy attended Our Lady of the Assumption Primary School, L25. He passed the 11+ exam and earned a scholarship to attend St. Edward&#x27;s College, Liverpool a direct grant grammar school. He credits these institutions as providing scaffolding for ascent out of an impoverished background. He began working (including a job stacking shelves at Tesco) and went on to study at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST) where he gained his BSc in Management Sciences and graduated in 1977. He earned a D.Sc. from Cranfield University.

==Career==
===Tesco===
Following his then girlfriend to London, he applied to become a product manager for Turkey Foil but was turned down. He applied for a job at Tesco, but lost out to another candidate. After that candidate was quickly reassigned upwards, Leahy returned to Tesco in 1979 as a marketing executive.

Tesco was a resolute market follower of the two leading brands, Marks &amp; Spencer as the then world&#x27;s most profitable retailer, and Sainsbury&#x27;s as the world&#x27;s most profitable food retailer. Leahy concluded that Tesco should stop following a strategy of catch-up and start leading through market knowledge, which led to his success in devising and implementing the Tesco Clubcard loyalty programme and also monitoring the shopping habits of Clubcard holders.

Leahy was appointed to the board in 1992, and in 1995 Tesco became the UK&#x27;s biggest retailer. Leahy became chief executive in 1997, on the retirement of Lord MacLaurin (formerly his mentor) who wanted to appoint a successor to lead international expansion and increased market share. Tesco stretched its lead as the UK&#x27;s largest retailer and also grew internationally.

Following Tesco&#x27;s announcement of £2 billion in profits in April 2005, Leahy hit back against protests that the company was &quot;too successful&quot;. During his tenure, he increased the company&#x27;s UK market share from 20pc to 30pc.

On 8 June 2010, Tesco announced that Leahy was to retire as chief executive in March 2011. Leahy has been paid £8.42m in performance related bonuses since his departure from Tesco, in addition to a pension pot worth £18.4m at the time of his departure. Since then he has focused on startup investments.

===B&amp;M Retail===
Following his departure from Tesco Leahy was appointed the chairman of the board of B&amp;M Retail in December 2012. Sir Terry is a senior adviser to CD&amp;R. In 2017, it was announced that he would step down as chairman from B&amp;M after five years. During this time, he steered the retailer on to the stock market. Revenues also rose from £993m to £2.7bn as a result of an aggressive expansion plan, which also saw its store portfolio increase from 331 shops to 893.

== Honours ==
Leahy was knighted in 2002. 

== Institutions==
He was Chancellor of UMIST, his alma mater, from 2002 until 1 October 2004, when he became one of two co-chancellors of the University of Manchester, when UMIST and the Victoria University of Manchester were merged into a new university. He was given an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Cranfield University on 7 June 2007.

Leahy is an Everton Football Club supporter and is a special advisor to the club. He was also part of a proposed ground move to Kirkby which would have a new ground with a Tesco supermarket, a hotel, a range of high street shops and extensive car parking. This project was called in for government scrutiny and rejected when Communities secretary, John Denham, decided the £400m project would breach shopping policies which discourage supermarket chains from sucking business away from town and city centres.

== Books ==
Leahy&#x27;s book &quot;Management in 10 Words&quot; was published by Random House Business Books in June 2012.

<text>Frank Templeton Prince (13 September 1912 – 7 August 2003) was a British poet and academic, known generally for his best-known poem &quot;Soldiers Bathing&quot;, written during the Second World War in 1942, which has been frequently included in anthologies.
He was born in Kimberley, South Africa. His father Henry (Harry) Prince (formerly Prinz) was from the East End of London, of Dutch-Jewish descent, while his mother was Scottish. He was educated at the Christian Brothers College in Kimberley, then Balliol College, Oxford. He had a visiting position at Princeton University. In World War II he was involved in intelligence work at Bletchley Park.

He married in 1943, and took an academic position after the war at the University of Southampton, where he settled. In the mid-1970s, he taught at the University of the West Indies in Jamaica, as well as Brandeis University in the United States and Sana&#x27;a University, Yemen.

Prince&#x27;s early work drew praise from T.S. Eliot, who was then editor at Faber and Faber. Eliot published some of his poetry in The Criterion before publishing Prince&#x27;s first book &quot;Poems&quot; in 1938. In work such as the &quot;Afterword on Rupert Brooke&quot; his interest in the metrical ideas of Robert Bridges is evident.

F. T. Prince died in Southampton in 2003.
