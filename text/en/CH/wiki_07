<text>Thomas William Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (6 May 175430 June 1842), known as Coke of Norfolk or Coke of Holkham, was a British politician and agricultural reformer. Born to Wenman Coke, Member of Parliament (MP) for Derby, and his wife Elizabeth, Coke was educated at several schools, including Eton College, before undertaking a Grand Tour of Europe. He returned to Britain and married. When his father died he inherited a 30,000-acre Norfolk estate. Returned to Parliament in 1776 for Norfolk, Coke became a close friend of Charles James Fox, and joined his Eton schoolmate William Windham in his support of the American colonists during the American Revolutionary War. As a supporter of Fox, Coke was one of the MPs who lost their seats in the 1784 general election, and he returned to Norfolk to work on farming, hunting, and the maintenance and expansion of Holkham Hall, his ancestral home.

Coke was again returned to Parliament in 1790, sitting continuously until 1832, and he primarily spoke on matters of local interest, such as the Corn Laws. His second focus was on civil liberties, and he spoke out against the government&#x27;s response to the Peterloo Massacre and similar events. Described as the &quot;greatest commoner in England&quot;, he chose the passage of the Great Reform Act 1832 as the moment to retire, later being made Earl of Leicester in July 1837. After a short illness, Coke died on 30 June 1842, and was succeeded as Earl by his son Thomas. Coke&#x27;s main legacy was as an agricultural reformer, not as a politician; he has historically been credited with sparking the British Agricultural Revolution through the reforms he made to farming on his estates. Later historians have questioned this, however, noting that the developments credited to him are most likely the work of other individuals; nevertheless, he has still been described as &quot;the real hero of Norfolk agriculture&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Coke was born on 6 May 1754 in London, to Wenman Coke (originally Wenman Roberts) and Elizabeth Chamberlayne. The Cokes were a landowning family of Derbyshire, originally from Norfolk, Wenman representing Derby as one of its two Members of Parliament, and as such Coke was born into a wealthy, estate-owning family; one of his first memories was &quot;being held up to a window to watch a fox being cornered and killed by hounds&quot;. Little is known of Coke&#x27;s father; Wenman is described as a shy person who &quot;saw little company and lived much out of the world; his habits were those of a country gentleman, bending his mind to agriculture, moderately addicted to field sports and more than either, to reading in which he passed many hours; firm in his principles which were those of the old Whig; amiable in his disposition mild in his manners, he was beloved of his friends&quot;. The family&#x27;s prospects improved significantly in 1759 when Coke was five, when his great-uncle, Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester, died. The cause of Thomas&#x27;s death is not certain, although there are chances it was a duel, but the result was that upon the death of Thomas&#x27;s wife Margaret, Wenman inherited a substantial Norfolk estate, including Holkham Hall, a &quot;Palladian masterpiece&quot;. Margaret studiously avoided the rest of the family, vowing to outlive Wenman simply to ensure that he did not inherit the estate. In the event she died in 1775, one year before Wenman, who thereby inherited.

Few records exist of Thomas Coke&#x27;s early years, although it is known that he was educated in Longford, Derbyshire, before going to a school in Wandsworth run by French settlers. In 1765 he was sent to Eton College, where he was joined by William Windham, a close friend in his later life. Coke was apparently happy at Eton, and was excellent at field sports; on one occasion 70 snipes he had killed were found in his room, and on another, he narrowly avoided being punished for shooting a pheasant in Windsor Great Park. He was not particularly interested in his academic studies, but by the time he left Eton in 1771 Coke had developed a close circle of friends and connections from the landowning class, and practical skills to deal with his future estates. After leaving school he undertook a Grand Tour of Europe, financed by his father and his great-aunt (who offered him £500 not to go to a university, regarding them as dens of vice). Coke visited France and Italy, where he witnessed the marriage of the Young Pretender to Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern; Louise apparently fell in love with Coke, preferring the similarly aged Englishman to her 52-year-old alcoholic husband.

==Career==
By the time Coke returned to Britain, plans were already under way for him to enter Parliament. When an election was called in 1774, Weman stood for the seat of Norfolk, with his son asked to stand in his place for Derby. Coke was not particularly enthusiastic about this, and withdrew when his opponent discovered he was under 21, the requisite age to stand for Parliament. With his father elected, Coke travelled with him to London, meeting members of the British high society. His sister Elizabeth and her husband James Dutton were also visiting, with Dutton&#x27;s sister Jane, and Coke fell in love with her. Wenman was not impressed when Coke asked him to let them be married, as he had picked out the daughter of a baronet for his son, but with the intercession of Wenman&#x27;s friend Harbord Harbord, he finally consented to their marriage, which was solemnized on 5 October 1775.

The new couple lived in Godwick Manor, their peace disturbed in 1776 when Wenman&#x27;s health began to fail. He finally died on 10 April after &quot;a constipation which medicine could not remove&quot;, leaving Coke in charge of a 30,000-acre estate at the age of 22. Soon after his father&#x27;s death, Harbord and other senior Whigs visited Coke and asked him to stand for Norfolk in his father&#x27;s stead. Coke was not enthusiastic, not seeing himself as a politician and hoping to enjoy his new estates and wealth, but after his visitors pointed out a Tory might otherwise replace him &quot;my blood chilled all over me from my head to my foot, and I came forward&quot;. On 12 April he issued a manifesto to the Norfolk electorate, soon returning to campaign, and after being unanimously nominated on 27 April he was elected in May.

===Entry to Parliament===

Little is known of Coke&#x27;s early career in Parliament; he spoke relatively infrequently, and the parliamentary session was dissolved soon after his election. During that summer, however, he struck up a relationship with Charles James Fox, a soon-to-be famous Whig politician noted for his outspoken and flamboyant lifestyle. Coke later recounted that &quot;When I first went into Parliament I attached myself to Fox and clung to him through life. I lived in the closest bond of friendship with him.&quot; The period was one of economic stability and political calm under Lord North, which ended due to the American Revolution and resulting American Revolutionary War. Coke was noted for his support of the American colonists; as a strong supporter of the 1688 Glorious Revolution and the resulting Bill of Rights 1689, he felt that the support of the espoused principles of justice and tolerance in Britain and overseas was his duty as a British subject, and saw no conflict between his position as a supporter of the colonists and his patriotism. Following the Battles of Saratoga, it became clear that any victory in America would be long and expensive, and in an attempt to raise funds King George III asked subjects to donate. In Norwich, a meeting was held in January 1778 for this purpose; it raised £4,500 in less than an hour. Windham and Coke attended this meeting, Windham making an impassioned speech pointing out that the campaign had so far resulted only in &quot;disappointment, shame and dishonour&quot;, and that &quot;peace and reconciliation with America&quot; was the only option. Windham, Coke and their supporters then withdrew to a nearby pub, where they drafted a petition to the king from &quot;the Nobility, Gentry, Clergy, Freeholders and Inhabitants of the County of Norfolk&quot;. This was presented to Parliament by Coke on 17 February 1778, signed by 5,400 people from Norfolk. George III took this as a personal insult, and as a result, disliked Coke until his death.

Coke also brought up the issue of the hunting game. During the late 18th century a series of laws were passed protecting a landowner&#x27;s right to hunt, and giving severe penalties to poachers. On 27 February Coke, an enthusiastic hunter, suggested in Parliament that these laws be relaxed; &quot;Combinations had been formed in the Country against the execution of these laws and some lives had been lost&quot;. Before any motion could be brought (it was not until 1827 that the laws were revised), the situation in America came up again. On 22 February, Henry Seymour Conway brought a motion asking the King to &quot;listen to the humble prayer and advice of his faithful Commons, that the war on the continent of North America may no longer be pursued for the impractical purpose of reducing the inhabitants of that country to obedience by force&quot;. While the motion failed, it was again brought on 27 February, and passed. With this, Conway moved that &quot;An humble address be presented to His Majesty&quot;; George III replied that he would see them on 3 March at St James&#x27;s Palace. It was then that &quot;the most important and symbolic act of Coke&#x27;s political career&quot; occurred. As a Knight of the Shire, Coke had the right to appear in court dressed &quot;in his boots&quot; as opposed to in formal court dress; this he did, appearing in front of George III dressed in leather breeches, boots and spurs.

Eventually, the king began negotiations with the American colonies and accepted the resignation of Lord North – an action which would, eventually, lead to Coke leaving Parliament. A new government was formed in April 1782, with Lord Rockingham as Prime Minister and Fox and Lord Shelburne as Secretaries of State. Rockingham and Shelburne disagreed constantly, particularly over the situation in North America, and with Rockingham&#x27;s death on 1 July Shelburne was made Prime Minister. At this the rest of the government resigned, and after a period of political chaos, the short-lived Fox-North Coalition was formed in April 1783. Coke was disgusted by this arrangement, describing it as a &quot;revolting compact&quot;. An East India Bill, which created 7 commissioners to oversee India, brought chaos to the coalition. Controversially, the commissioners would be appointed by the government, not by the crown, which challenged what the King saw as his constitutional right. Defeated in the House of Lords, the bill was used by George III to overturn Fox&#x27;s government and install a government led by William Pitt the Younger. Parliament was eventually dissolved on 25 March 1784, and thanks to Coke&#x27;s long-standing support of Fox and his actions, the ensuing general election led to Coke losing his seat.

===Norfolk work===

In between his Parliamentary work, Coke and his wife had been maintaining and improving his estates since they took possession of it in April 1776. The cornerstone was Holkham House, a &quot;temple to the arts&quot; built by Coke&#x27;s great uncle. Knowing that he did not have the same understanding of classical architecture and art, Coke mainly left it alone, instead focusing on the park and gardens. 

A 2023 reappraisal of his contribution to the art collection discusses his addition of portraits by Thomas Gainsborough, Joshua Reynolds, Ramsay Richard Reinagle, George Hayter, Chester Harding, and John Opie. He also added sculpture by Joseph Nollekens, Richard Westmacott, Thomas Banks, and Francis Leggatt Chantrey.

The grounds had been laid out during the 1720s and 1730s, in a design which quickly became seen as old-fashioned. Coke had the lake massively expanded. A total of 36,000 cubic yards of earth was shifted and he employed the gardener John Sandys from 1781. Sandys created several large areas of woodland by planting over 7,000 trees on 22 acres near the Eastern Lodge, another ten acres near the lake, and four acres of marshland. In 1784 a further woodland expansion was undertaken, with 40 acres and 11,000 trees, and between 1785 and 1789 396,750 trees were planted on a further 179 acres. Sandys retired in 1805 and was replaced in 1806 by James Loose, but he continued to advise Coke on forestry matters. The library was also expanded, through the work of William Roscoe, who bought books including the &quot;Mainz Psalter&quot; for Coke between 1814 and 1842.

Coke also expanded the estate itself, incorporating farms around the House as their leases ended, and by 1800 the estate covered 3,500 acres. Samuel Wyatt was also employed from 1799 to 1805 to build new lodges at the entrance of the extended estate, and until 1806 also worked on a new kitchen garden; this covered six acres. Humphry Repton was employed to extend the lake yet again, and proposed building a boathouse and fishing pavilion, as well as a chain ferry leading to a &quot;snug thatched cottage&quot;; there is no evidence this proposal was ever approved. Most of the work was completed by 1810, and from then on Coke&#x27;s attention turned to hunting game. The estate was explicitly designed with that in mind, and game books note between 1,300 and 2,500 partridges were killed most years. In 1822, Elizabeth, Coke&#x27;s daughter, recorded that 800 birds were shot in one day.

Jane Dutton, Coke&#x27;s wife, gave birth to their first child in 1777, a daughter named Jane. Two more daughters followed; Anne Margaret in 1779, and Elizabeth in 1795, before Jane&#x27;s death in 1800. Jane was married to Charles Nevison Howard, Viscount Andover, on 21 June 1796, but on 11 January 1800 Andover died in a shooting accident on the Holkham estate. Jane remarried to Henry Digby in 1806, and they had 11 children.

===Landlord and agriculturalist===
As a landlord, Coke was a firm believer in the right and moral obligation of a landowner to improve the quality of life of those living on his estates. The roles of landlord and tenant were clearly set out by the late 18th century; the landlord was to provide fields, roads and buildings, while the tenant would provide the seed, implements and manual labour. Coke&#x27;s estate included 54 farms when he inherited it, with excellent farm output. There were, however, significant debts as a result of his uncle&#x27;s work on Holkham Hall, with the interest alone being £4,000 a year. He had some difficulties dealing with the people employed before he inherited the estates, and when the steward Ralph Cauldwell, appointed by Coke&#x27;s uncle, retired in 1782, Coke failed to replace him until 1816. This replacement was Francis Blaikie, a Scottish man who had previously been employed as estate steward for Lord Chesterfield. Blaikie paid close attention to where farms were doing badly or could do better, but often struggled to deal with Coke. Coke lacked financial sense in matters other than the agricultural, on one occasion selling all his land near Manchester. It wasn&#x27;t until 20 years later that Blaikie became aware of this, after receiving a query from the new owners about the mineral rights. Blaikie travelled to Manchester to meet the solicitor who had handled the sale, finding not only poorly drafted conveyances but that all the sold land had been rich in coal.

In the early 18th century, farmland was run through an open field system, which were commonly overstocked and made trying experimental methods very difficult; enclosed farms, on the other hand, were higher quality and useful for experimentation, with the result that they commanded a rent almost double a similarly sized open field. Compounding this problem, many of the enclosures were split up into strips, with the result that ownership was unclear. Between 1776 and 1816, Coke rapidly bought strips of land near his estates and had them enclosed. Much of this came during the Napoleonic Wars when grain prices (and therefore farming profits) peaked. Coke was influenced by &quot;Turnip&quot; Townshend, who had owned a nearby estate and promoted crop rotation and farm improvement. Along with enclosure, marling and improved grasses, Townshend&#x27;s improvements resulted in &quot;a course of husbandry utterly unlike that practised a hundred years ago&quot;.
Coke&#x27;s big improvements came in two areas; grasses and husbandry. He pioneered the use of cocksfoot and lucerne as grass and feed respectively, with the result that by 1793 he claimed to have 2,400 sheep in Holkham, as opposed to the 700 kept when he inherited the estates. The husbandry involved the milking comparisons of various types of cow, along with the first planting of Scottish turnips, which are &quot;a good table vegetable being more palatable and nutritious and not so watery as the Norfolk variety&quot;. His prime area of experimentation was on the selective breeding for sheep. The most common sheep in the area was the Norfolk Horn, which was long-legged and slow to mature. Coke became a promoter of the English Leicester, a breed noted as fast-maturing and excellent when fed turnips. Coke cross-bred the two, with the resulting sheep being highly tame and superior to the pure Norfolk breed. Coke also bred cattle and used oxen for ploughing rather than horses, being the first to use them harnessed rather than yoked and winning a prize for his oxen in 1837.

Through sheep shearings, competitions and his contacts within the nobility, Coke soon spread his new ideas and breeds. Initially small events of local farmers, the shearings soon became 200-person formal dinners, rising to 300 people in 1821 and 700 soon after, with even the American ambassador Richard Rush attending in 1819, along with the French Consul and the Duke of Sussex. The Board of Agriculture was formed in 1793, with Coke sitting as one of the 30 &quot;ordinary members&quot; as a leading agriculturalist; he was made the Vice-President in 1805. The Board published a series of county reports for most of the United Kingdom, describing new farming measures being undertaken in various parts of the country.

Coke has been described as &quot;the real hero of Norfolk agriculture&quot;, despite the fact that his land was so poor one critic is said to have remarked that &quot;the thin sandy soil must be ploughed by rabbits yoked to a pocket knife&quot;. 19th and early 20th century historians held him to be the crucial figure of the British Agricultural Revolution. However, academics and writers dispute his importance. He is credited with inventing four-crop rotation which Naomi Riches has described as an &quot;error&quot;, and R. A. C. Parker, writing in the &quot;Economic History Review&quot;, states that &quot;many of the innovations he is supposed to have introduced should be attributed to his predecessors in Norfolk&quot;; however that &quot;is not to deny the substantial contribution of Coke himself to the advance of farming technique in England&quot;.

===Further Parliamentary career===

Coke was re-elected to Parliament in 1790, at a time of great political trouble. The French Revolution a year earlier had torn the Whig party in half, with Coke and Fox in the isolated minority who supported the revolutionaries as their acts became more brutal. With the declaration of war in 1793, an impact was finally felt in Britain with a rise in agricultural prices and rent. It also led to the establishment of local yeomanry forces to defend the country, something Coke opposed. This reduced his popularity in Norfolk and led to suspicions he might be a Jacobin, to the point where he was forced to publicly declare that he was not a Republican and &quot;detested their principles&quot;. Eventually, in late September 1798, he raised the Holkham Yeoman Cavalry, commanding it as a Major, to defend against any invasion. This unit was dissolved in 1802 with the Peace of Amiens, but after war broke out again a year later more volunteer regiments were formed. Coke was notably absent from any preparations for defence, feeling that the risks of invasion were exaggerated, but was eventually persuaded by public opinion to reform the Yeoman Cavalry in 1803; it was again dissolved in 1805.

The French Revolution had split the Whigs into two factions, but as it progressed Fox&#x27;s group in support of the revolutionaries began to dwindle. Coke stuck by Fox, and with the outbreak of the War, the split became finalised; Fox refused to accept that Britain need be involved in the conflict, as did Coke. In Parliament, Coke spoke out against the conflict, debating the motion to raise money for the war through a new tax in April 1794, and supporting Wilberforce&#x27;s anti-war motion on 24 March 1795. He felt more comfortable with local matters, however, and his main concerns &quot;were those of the agricultural interest&quot;, arguing against a new land tax and introducing a bill to shorten the shooting season, allowing for the production of more corn. Coke was again returned to Parliament in 1796, despite an anti-war and anti-government address to the electorate which was condemned as arrogant and dictatorial, but found on his return that the Foxites had agreed to withdraw from Parliamentary activity.

After Parliament was dissolved in June 1802, another election saw Coke again returned, although in a contested election that cost the candidates £35,000. With the death of William Pitt in 1806, the two Whig groups agreed to an alliance, which took the form of the Ministry of All the Talents; Fox was confirmed as Foreign Secretary, and Windham as Secretary for War and the Colonies. The government reportedly offered Coke a peerage, which he refused primarily to focus on abolishing Britain&#x27;s involvement in the Atlantic slave trade, which was accomplished roughly a year after Fox&#x27;s death on 13 September 1806. Fox&#x27;s death made Parliament lose some of its appeal to Coke, as they had been close friends. His attendance in the next two years was very limited, and the next occasion of note was his support of the Corn Laws, which were highly unpopular in Norfolk and led to him being physically attacked by a mob in 1815.

With the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo, the wars in Europe ended, and the troops returned home. As a result, the nation underwent dramatic shifts due to rising unemployment as the economy shifted and the government began to pay off its debts incurred during 20 years of war. Agricultural prices slumped, and Coke became active in opposing tax increases which would impact on the farmers. In February 1816 he spoke out against income and malt tax, and in March attacked the property tax as &quot;utterly at variance with civil liberty&quot;. An opponent of government excess in a time of unemployment and high taxation, he also voted against the army estimates and opposed the Civil List in May. With a County Meeting on 5 April 1817, Coke spoke on the King&#x27;s intent on &quot;overturning democracy and enslaving the country&quot; by restricting freedom of speech and the press, suggesting that the government needed to be removed.

Returning to Parliament in 1818, he argued against the Royal Households Bill and introduced a Game Law Amendment Bill, which was defeated. Following the Peterloo Massacre and the government&#x27;s introduction of a Seditious Meetings Prevention Bill, Coke accused the government of being &quot;most strongly implicated in the events in Manchester&quot;, saying that the meeting would have been peaceful had it not been &quot;interfered with by the officious agents of authority&quot;. The 1820s saw Coke speak far less; firstly, because of the continued Tory domination of Parliament, and secondly because of his remarriage. In 1822, at the age of 68 and after 21 years as a widower, he married Anne Keppel, the daughter of Lord Albemarle, and Coke&#x27;s 18-year-old godchild. Anne had initially been brought to Holkham to partner with his nephew William, who due to Coke&#x27;s lack of sons would inherit the estate, but they failed to get on. Anne and Coke&#x27;s marriage was met with bemusement, and described as &quot;absurd&quot;, but despite opposition took place on 26 February. Soon after the wedding, Anne became pregnant, and their son Thomas was born on 22 December.

In 1831, Coke&#x27;s personal friend Earl Grey became Prime Minister; as a result, Coke&#x27;s appearances in Parliament became more regular. He expressed delight at the Great Reform Act 1832, although he only spoke on the subject once, and chose its passage on 4 June 1832 as the appropriate moment to retire as an MP. As the &quot;greatest commoner in England&quot;, Coke finally accepted a peerage in July 1837 (having been offered one six times before), becoming the Earl of Leicester. He took no pleasure in attending the House of Lords, however, describing it as &quot;the hospital for incurables&quot;.

==Death==

Coke remained in the prime of life after his retirement; records show him killing 24 deer with 25 shots at the age of 79, and having another child three years later. A portrait painted of him which appears to be of a man 20 years younger, is according to Stirling &quot;no flattering likeness&quot;, but instead completely accurate. After a short and painful illness while visiting his estate (and childhood home) at Longford Hall, Derbyshire, Coke died in the early hours of 30 June 1842 at the age of 88; his last words were reported to be &quot;well, perhaps I have talked too much&quot;. The body lay in state for two days, with the funeral procession finally setting out on 7 July. It travelled through King&#x27;s Lynn, where black flags of mourning were flown and thousands came to pay their respects. On the final leg of the journey, with a funeral procession two miles in length led by 150 Holkham tenants on horseback and followed by several hundreds of private carriages, 200 gentlemen on horseback, riding two abreast, and lastly, a long train of neighbours, tenants and yeomen, Coke was eventually buried at the family mausoleum in Tittleshall on 11 July. Immediately after Coke&#x27;s death, a committee formed to create a monument to him; over a thousand subscribers contributed £5,000. The eventual Coke Monument, found in the grounds of Holkham Hall, was designed by William Donthorne and finally completed in 1851. Wilhelmina Stirling wrote a 2-volume &quot;Life of Thomas William Coke&quot;.

The earldom and the Holkham estate passed to his son Thomas.

==Family==

<doc id="1009552" wikidata="Q838189" url="?curid=1009552" title="GNU Linear Programming Kit">
<text>The GNU Linear Programming Kit (GLPK) is a software package intended for solving large-scale linear programming (LP), mixed integer programming (MIP), and other related problems. It is a set of routines written in ANSI C and organized in the form of a callable library. The package is part of the GNU Project and is released under the GNU General Public License.

GLPK uses the revised simplex method and the primal-dual interior point method for non-integer problems and the branch-and-bound algorithm together with Gomory&#x27;s mixed integer cuts for (mixed) integer problems.

== History ==
GLPK was developed by Andrew O. Makhorin (Андрей Олегович Махорин) of the Moscow Aviation Institute. The first public release was in October 2000.
* Version 1.1.1 contained a library for a revised primal and dual simplex algorithm.
* Version 2.0 introduced an implementation of the primal-dual interior point method.
* Version 2.2 added branch and bound solving of mixed integer problems.
* Version 2.4 added a first implementation of the GLPK/L modeling language.
* Version 4.0 replaced GLPK/L by the GNU MathProg modeling language, which is a subset of the AMPL modeling language.

== Interfaces and wrappers ==
Since version 4.0, GLPK problems can be modeled using GNU MathProg (GMPL), a subset of the AMPL modeling language used only by GLPK. However, GLPK is most commonly called from other programming languages. Wrappers exist for:

* Julia and the JuMP modeling package
* Java (using OptimJ)

== Further reading ==

* The book uses GLPK exclusively and contains numerous examples.

<doc id="1009560" wikidata="Q603494" url="?curid=1009560" title="Wicker Park (film)">
<text>Wicker Park is a 2004 American romantic thriller drama film directed by Paul McGuigan and starring Josh Hartnett, Rose Byrne, Diane Kruger and Matthew Lillard. It is a remake of the 1996 French film &quot;L&#x27;Appartement&quot;, which in turn is loosely based on Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. It was nominated for the at the Montreal World Film Festival, the city in which the film was partially filmed.

The title refers to the Wicker Park neighborhood on Chicago&#x27;s near northwest side.

==Plot==
Matt Simon, a young advertising executive, returns to Chicago with his fiancée Rebecca, after spending the last two years in New York. He bumps into his old friend Luke on the way into a meeting at a restaurant, in preparation for a business trip to China. Once inside, Matt thinks he overhears Lisa, the beautiful dancer he was in love with two years before, who had vanished overnight. Unable to confront the woman he believes may be Lisa, he blows off the trip and instead embarks on an obsessive search for her, as the story of Matt and Lisa&#x27;s romance unfolds in flashbacks.

A key card which the woman leaves at the restaurant leads Matt to a hotel, where he finds Lisa&#x27;s silver compact and an article marked in a newspaper. He leaves a note for Lisa at the restaurant bar, borrows Luke&#x27;s car, and trails the man from the newspaper article to an apartment. There, Matt discovers a note to Lisa under the door, with her key enclosed. The apartment is deserted, but he leaves Lisa a note himself, to meet him in Wicker Park, and keeps the key. An ecstatic Matt returns the car to Luke, who is furious because he has missed a date with his new girlfriend Alex. When Alex calls, Matt takes the blame and Luke is mollified.

The next day, after waiting in vain at Wicker Park, Matt goes back to the apartment and is caught by a woman who is also named Lisa. She says the apartment is hers, but she has a coat and red-soled shoes with a broken heel identical to Lisa&#x27;s—shoes that came from Luke&#x27;s shop, where Lisa first met Matt. She says that she was at the hotel because the man in the newspaper was stalking her, and asks Matt to stay the night. They end up sleeping together. Flashbacks reveal that this &quot;Lisa&quot; is actually Alex, Lisa&#x27;s old neighbor and friend. Alex had fallen in love with Matt from afar, but he met and fell for Lisa before Alex found the courage to speak to him. The man from the newspaper was stalking Lisa, and Alex agreed to swap apartments with her for a few days before Lisa left for a new job in London.

Luke persuades Matt to come with him that night to see Alex perform in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. She is unrecognizable in stage makeup, but panics after she sees Matt in the audience with Luke. Matt returns to the apartment, feels the real Lisa&#x27;s presence in spite of its emptiness, and spends the night. Alex sleeps with Luke that night. In the morning, when Matt calls Luke, she answers the phone then drops it in a panic. She overhears Luke say Matt is at the apartment, and runs out to call him and meet him there. After receiving Matt&#x27;s note at the restaurant, the real Lisa calls and asks Luke to tell Matt to meet her at three o&#x27;clock, saying he will know where. When Alex arrives at the apartment, Matt gives her another pair of red-soled shoes, Lisa&#x27;s size, but they are too big. She realizes he suspects something, but Matt says he can exchange them and leaves. Alex then calls Luke and asks him to meet her at the restaurant.

Now suspicious, Matt follows &quot;Lisa&quot; (Alex), bumps into Luke, and follows him into the restaurant to finally meet Alex, the girl Luke is in love with. Matt confronts Alex, her deception revealed. A flashback reveals that two years ago, the same day that Matt asked Lisa to move in with him, Lisa was offered a last minute job touring with a show in Europe and had to jump on a plane. Lisa had given Alex a note to deliver to Matt, telling him she loved him and wanted to live with him. Instead, Alex had kept the note, deleted all the messages Lisa had left for Matt on his answering machine, and told Lisa that she had caught Matt in bed with another woman. Matt never learned why Lisa left, seemingly without a word. In the present, a confused Luke tells Matt that Lisa called and wants him to meet her at three o&#x27;clock before she returns to London. Matt is unsure where to meet, but Alex gives him Lisa&#x27;s old note and he realizes that Lisa is at Wicker Park. Arriving too late, Matt then races to the airport, and is met by Rebecca, who has come to pick him up from the business trip to China he never went on. He confesses that he still loves someone else and cannot marry her. Lisa is nearby on the phone, listening to Alex admit what she has done and apologize. Matt sees Lisa through the crowd and comes up behind her. She senses he is there, turns to kiss him, and they are reunited.

== Production ==
Calling &quot;L&#x27;Appartement&quot; &quot;among the most absorbing and ingeniously constructed thrillers in years,&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; noted that the film &quot;was tapped for a Hollywood redo almost immediately,&quot; but then went into development hell with multiple directors (Joel Schumacher, Steven Spielberg, Joan Chen and Danny Cannon) and stars (Brendan Fraser, Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Paul Walker) attached at different times.

&quot;Wicker Park&quot; has been given 27% approval based on reviews from 137 critics from Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 4.4 out of 10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Implausible coincidences and an overly convoluted structure make the movie hard to follow or believe.&quot; At Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 40 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Main criticisms are directed towards the film&#x27;s complex plot and unconvincingly implausible coincidences. The Associated Press says, &quot;the characters do incredibly stupid things simply for the sake of plot contrivance.&quot; &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; calls it &quot;a film with more unbelievable coincidences than a Henry Fielding novel, more plot holes than a Swiss cheese and populated with the stock characters of that Hollywood world, that cinematic parallel universe.&quot; McGuigan&#x27;s direction is also criticised, with the &quot;Denver Rocky Mountain News&quot; saying he &quot;seems to have invested more in the youth and glamour of his cast than in a plausible and exacting script&quot;, whereas &quot;The New York Times&quot; says &quot;Directorial touches can&#x27;t do much to salvage a project as poorly conceived as this one.&quot;

Though calling the film inferior to &quot;L&#x27;Appartement&quot;, Scott Foundas wrote in &quot;Variety&quot; that both &quot;Wicker Park&quot; directing and screenplay were faithful to the French original, praising the way the film&#x27;s second half &quot;jumps back and forth in time and shifts between various characters&#x27; points-of-view, until finally the disparate pieces of the pic&#x27;s fragmented puzzle come together.&quot; He added, &quot;And while cynical viewers will no doubt suggest that [the] pic&#x27;s entire mystery could be remedied with a single e-mail or cell phone call, the same might be said for &quot;Vertigo&quot;, and there&#x27;s something refreshing and timeless about the way &quot;Wicker Park&quot; allows its characters to rely on their own wits rather than those increasingly common technological aids.&quot;

The non-linear narrative received a mixed response. In a mixed review, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; says, &quot;The preview audience I saw it with hooted in disbelief at the outrageous bits, then happily dug in to see what would happen next.&quot; Conversely, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; says, &quot;This is a smart movie, full of astonishing reverses and switchbacks, and it adroitly walks the thin line between too clever by half and not clever enough by three-quarters.&quot; In a favorable review, Roger Ebert says &quot;Wicker Park&quot; &quot;works because the actors invest their scenes with what is, under the circumstances, astonishing emotional realism.&quot;

&quot;Wicker Park&quot; was nominated for the Grand Prix des Amériques at the Montreal World Film Festival, the city in which it was partially filmed.

=== Box-office gross ===

Filmed on a budget of $30 million, &quot;Wicker Park&quot; grossed only $21.6 million worldwide.

==Home media==
On December 28, 2004, the movie was released on DVD and VHS from MGM Home Entertainment.

<doc id="1009575" wikidata="Q2932621" url="?curid=1009575" title="Cadbury Creme Egg">
<text>Cadbury Creme Egg (originally named Fry&#x27;s Creme Egg) is a chocolate confection produced in the shape of an egg. It originated from the British chocolatier Fry&#x27;s in 1963 before being renamed by Cadbury in 1971. The product consists of a thick chocolate shell containing a sweet white and yellow filling that resembles fondant. The filling mimics the albumen and yolk of a soft boiled egg.

The confectionery is produced by Cadbury in the United Kingdom, by The Hershey Company in the United States, and by Mondelez International in Canada.

==History==
While filled eggs were first manufactured by the Cadbury Brothers in 1923, the Creme Egg in its current form was introduced in 1963. Initially known as Fry&#x27;s Creme Eggs, they were renamed Cadbury Creme Eggs in 1971.

==Composition==
Cadbury Creme Eggs are manufactured as two chocolate half shells, each of which is filled with a white fondant made from sugar, glucose syrup, inverted sugar syrup, dried egg white and flavouring. The fondant in each half is topped with a smaller amount of the same mixture coloured yellow with paprika extract, to mimic the yolk and white of a real egg. Both halves are then quickly joined and cooled, the shell bonding together in the process. The solid eggs are removed from the moulds and wrapped in foil.

During an interview in a 2007 episode of &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, actor B. J. Novak drew attention to the fact that American market Cadbury Creme Eggs had decreased in size, despite the official Cadbury website stating otherwise. American Creme Eggs at the time weighed and contained 150 kcal. Before 2006, the eggs marketed by Hershey were identical to the UK version, weighing and containing 170 kcal.

In 2015, the British Cadbury company under the American Mondelēz International conglomerate announced that it had changed the formula of the Cadbury Creme Egg by replacing its Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate with &quot;standard cocoa mix chocolate&quot;. It had also reduced the packaging from six eggs to five, with a less than proportionate decrease in price. This resulted in a large number of complaints from consumers. Analysts at IRI found that Cadbury lost more than $12 million in Creme Egg sales in the UK.

==Manufacture and sales==
Creme Eggs are produced by Cadbury in the United Kingdom, by The Hershey Company in the United States, and by Cadbury Adams in Canada. They are sold by Mondelez International in all markets except the US, where The Hershey Company has the local marketing rights. At the Bournville factory in Birmingham in the UK, they are manufactured at a rate of 1.5 million per day. The Creme Egg was also previously manufactured in New Zealand, but has been imported from the UK since 2009. A YouGov poll saw the Creme Egg ranked as the most famous confectionery in the UK.

As of 2011 the Creme Egg was the best-selling confectionery item between New Year&#x27;s Day and Easter in the UK, with annual sales in excess of 200 million eggs and a brand value of approximately £55 million. However, in 2016 sales plummeted after the controversial decision to change the recipe from the original Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate to a cheaper substitute, with reports of a loss of more than £6M in sales.

Creme Eggs are available individually and in boxes, with the numbers of eggs per package varying per country. The foil wrapping of the eggs was traditionally pink, blue, purple, and yellow in the United Kingdom and Ireland, though green was removed and purple replaced blue early in the 21st century. In the United States, some green is incorporated into the design, which previously featured the product&#x27;s mascot, the Creme Egg Chick. , the packaging in Canada has been changed to a , purple, red and yellow soft plastic shell.

Creme Eggs are available annually between New Year&#x27;s Day and Easter Sunday. In the UK in the 1980s, Cadbury made Creme Eggs available year-round but sales dropped and they returned to seasonal availability. In 2018, white chocolate versions of the Creme Eggs were made available. These eggs were not given a wrapper that clearly marked them as white chocolate eggs, and were mixed in with the normal Creme Eggs in the United Kingdom. Individuals who discovered an egg would win money via a ticket that had a code printed on it inside of the wrapper.

Creme Eggs were manufactured in New Zealand at the Cadbury factory in Dunedin from 1983 to 2009. Cadbury in New Zealand and Australia went through a restructuring process, with most Cadbury products previously produced in New Zealand being manufactured instead at Cadbury factories in Australia. Cadbury Australia produces some Creme Eggs products for the Australian market, most prominently the Mini Creme Egg. New Zealand&#x27;s Dunedin plant later received a $69 million upgrade to specialise in boxed products such as Cadbury Roses, and Creme Eggs were no longer produced there. The result of the changes meant that Creme Eggs were instead imported from the United Kingdom. The change also saw the range of Creme Eggs available for sale decrease. The size also dropped from to in this time. The response from New Zealanders was not positive, with complaints including the filling not being as runny as the New Zealand version. As of 2024, Cadbury Australia continue to produce the Mini Egg variant.

==Advertising==

The Creme Egg has been marketed in the UK and Ireland with the question &quot;How do you eat yours?&quot; and in New Zealand with the slogan &quot;Don&#x27;t get caught with egg on your face&quot;. Australia and New Zealand have also used a variation of the UK question, using the slogan &quot;How do you do it?&quot;

In the US, Creme Eggs are advertised on television with a small white rabbit called the Cadbury Bunny (alluding to the Easter Bunny) which clucks like a chicken. Other animals dressed with bunny ears have also been used in the television ads, and in 2021, out of over 12,000 submissions in the Hershey Company&#x27;s third annual tryouts, an Australian tree frog named Betty was named the newest Cadbury Bunny. Ads for caramel eggs use a larger gold-coloured rabbit which also clucks, and chocolate eggs use a large brown rabbit which clucks in a deep voice. The advertisements use the slogan &quot;Nobunny knows Easter better than him&quot;, spoken by TV personality Mason Adams. The adverts have continued to air nearly unchanged into the high definition era and after Adams&#x27;s death in 2005, though currently the ad image is slightly zoomed to fill the screen. The majority of rabbits used in the Cadbury commercials are Flemish Giants.

In the UK, around the year 2000, selected stores were provided standalone paperboard cutouts of something resembling a &quot;love tester&quot;. The shopper would press a button in the centre and a &quot;spinner&quot; (a series of LED lights) would select at random a way of eating the Creme Egg, e.g. &quot;with chips&quot;. These were withdrawn within a year. There are also the &quot;Creme Egg Cars&quot; which are, as the name suggest, ovular vehicles painted to look like Creme Eggs. They are driven to various places to advertise the eggs but are based mainly at the Cadbury factory in Bournville. Five &quot;Creme Egg Cars&quot; were built from Bedford Rascal chassis. The headlights are taken from a Citroën 2CV.

For the 2008/2009 season, advertising in the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and Canada consisted of stopmotion adverts in the &quot;Here Today, Goo Tomorrow&quot; campaign which comprised a Creme Egg stripping its wrapper off and then breaking its own shell, usually with household appliances and equipment, while making various &#x27;goo&#x27; sounds/noises (as the only sounds and voices they make are the sole word &quot;goo&quot;), and a &#x27;relieved&#x27; sound/noise when it has finally been able to break its shell. The Cadbury&#x27;s Creme Egg website featured games where the player had to prevent the egg from finding a way to release its own &quot;goo&quot;.

A similar advertising campaign in 2010 featured animated Creme Eggs destroying themselves in large numbers, such as gathering together at a cinema before bombarding into each other to release all of the eggs&#x27; goo, and another which featured eggs being destroyed by mouse traps.

In Halloween 2011, 2012 and 2013, advertising in Canada and New Zealand consisted of the &quot;Screme Egg&quot; Easter aliens, such as 48 seconds in the advertising.

=== Creme Egg Café ===
In 2016, Cadbury opened a pop-up café titled &quot;Crème de la Creme Egg Café&quot; in London. Tickets for the café sold out within an hour of being published online. The café on Greek Street, Soho, was open every Friday, Saturday and Sunday from 22 January to 6 March 2016.

<doc id="1009591" wikidata="Q2740658" url="?curid=1009591" title="Holkham">
<text>Holkham is a small village and civil parish in north Norfolk, England, which includes a stately home and estate, Holkham Hall, and a beach, Holkham Gap, at the centre of Holkham National Nature Reserve.

==Geography==
The parish has an area of and in the 2001 census had a population of 236 in 104 households. For the purposes of local government, the parish falls within the district of North Norfolk.

The village of Holkham is located on the coast road (the A149) between Wells-next-the-Sea and Burnham Overy Staithe. At one time the village was a landing with access to the sea via a tidal creek to the harbour at Wells. The creek succumbed to land reclamation, much of which created the grounds of the estate, starting in 1639 and ending in 1859 when the harbour at Wells was edged with a sea wall. The land west of the wall was subsequently turned to agricultural uses. Aerial photographs show traces of the creek in the topsoil, and the lake to the west of the hall appears to be based on a remnant of it. Now the village serves principally as the main entrance to the hall and deer park, and to Lady Anne&#x27;s Drive which leads to the beach. Among the houses of the village are several estate-owned businesses, including a hotel (&#x27;The Victoria Inn&#x27;) and art gallery.
Holkham Hall is one of the principal Palladian houses of England, built for an ancestor of Thomas Coke, noted agricultural innovator and later 1st Earl of Leicester of Holkham. The hall, now the home of the 8th Earl, is surrounded by an attractive park, with herds of red and fallow deer, a lake that was once a tidal creek, several monuments and drives, and its own church. Both hall and park are open to the public.

From the main coast road Lady Anne&#x27;s Drive, a toll road owned by the Holkham Estate, crosses the reclaimed salt marshes to Holkham Gap. This is a gap in pine-fringed sand dunes which form the outer coastline. From here, an uninterrupted sandy beach runs both ways to Wells and Burnham Overy Staithe. To the west of the gap is a nudist section of beach. Holkham railway station was located about halfway along Lady Anne&#x27;s Drive (to the east). The railway line through to Holkham was built in 1864. The line made up part of the Great Eastern Railway network, which ran from Wells-next-the-Sea, through Holkham and on to Burnham Market. The line was closed in 1952.

Holkham Pines is the large belt of pine trees which runs west to east inland from the beach; the eastern end is known as Wells Woods. Holkham Freshmarsh is a series of wet meadows which sit inland from the pine belt, and north of the A149. They are bisected by Lady Anne&#x27;s Drive, which gives access to the woods and the beach. The marshes are important for their wintering population of pink-footed geese, and have been designated a National Nature Reserve.

==History==

===Celts===
The last of the ancient Celts to inhabit East Anglia were the tribe of the Iceni. They are believed responsible for the earthworks of the Roman Iron Age visible in the marsh. A Roman road runs along the west side of the estate. Their provincial capital under Roman occupation was Venta Icenorum near Norwich.

===Anglo-Saxons===
The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; for the years 449–454 records the arrival of large numbers of Angles and Jutes under Hengist and Horsa, defeating the British king, Vortigern, in 455.

By about 600 the distribution of cruciform brooches, a diagnostic of Anglo-Jutish society, show that the culture had displaced the Celtic on the east coast of Britain, including coastal East Anglia. A similar displacement was true of Saxon culture in south-east Britain, diagnosed by saucer brooches. Two bands of Saxons penetrated into East Anglia, one down the rivers that empty into the Wash and the other into the centre.

In the 7th century the Germanic kings of these regions were being converted to Christianity. The Anglisc or Englisc of East Anglia may already by that time have been divided into the &quot;North Folk&quot; and the &quot;South Folk&quot;. In 654 the Christian king of East Anglia, Anna of East Anglia, was killed in battle against the last pagan king of Mercia. So great was his Christian affirmation that his four daughters renounced the world and became saints. Numerous lives of the saints relate that the youngest, Saint Withburga, was brought up at Holkham. She later founded a Benedictine nunnery at East Dereham and was eventually buried at Ely in 743. This is the first reference to Holkham.

A church on the grounds of the estate, still used for worship, commemorates the saint. The existence of the saint is attested by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which for the year 798 records that the body of Wihtburga, sister of St. Aethelthryth, was found to be uncorrupted at Dereham 55 years after her death.

The &quot;Chronicle&quot; and the historian, Bede, do not state the name of Holkham. It does appear as that in the Domesday Book, 1086, which means that it must precede Middle English. The element -ham is clearly identifiable as Old English, &quot;village, manor, home&quot;. The Holk- remains unidentified. A suggestion has been made that it comes from *hoelig, &quot;holy&quot;, in honour of the saint, but it would not have been named that before she was one. The guidebook of the parish church (which is dedicated to Saint Withburga) says the area was originally called &#x27;Wihtburgstowe&#x27; but later &#x27;holc-ham&#x27; which the church guide translates as &#x27;homestead in a hollow&#x27;.

===Later Middle Ages ===
Medieval manuscripts concerning Holkham have been edited by William Hassall and Jacques Beauroy.

=== 20th century ===
Holkham Studio Pottery was set up at Holkham Hall in 1951, making it the first stately home to produce pottery on-site to sell in the gift shop. At its peak, it employed 100 people and sold its distinctive pottery around the world. The company, which produced earthenwares, became Holkham Pottery Ltd in 1961 and closed in 2007.

==Parish church of St Withburga==


Holkham parish church is just south of the coast road, hidden in the trees of the Holkham Estate. It stands on a tall circular mound, which archaeologists suggest might be man-made and possibly pre-Saxon.

Holkham parish church is dedicated to Saint Withburga. This dedication to a Saxon saint often implies a church has Saxon origins. Excavations at Holkham have found Saxon remains near the west end which may be a tower. Norman remains have been found incorporated into the present building which implies that the Normans expanded the Saxon building – as they did at other churches. In turn this Norman church made way for an Early English building (13th century). The tower and the western part of the south aisle date from this period. The church guidebook notes that the tower gets progressively younger as it goes up. The lower section is Early English up to the sill of the belfry windows. The belfry itself is Decorated (14th century) while the battlements and pinnacles are Perpendicular (15th to 16th century). During restoration work at least six 12th and 13th century coffin lids with foliated crosses were found on site and are now on show inside the church.

The north aisle and north transept are thought to have been added later than the 13th century as burials and parts of coffin lids were found under the foundations. The church is known to have been enlarged in the 14th century and many of the internal arches are Decorated period. By the early 18th century the church had fallen into decay but the development of Holkham Estate by the Coke family led to renewed interest in the church. In 1767 the Countess Dowager of Leicester put up £1,000 for its repair. She had overseen the completion of Holkham Hall after the death of the 1st Earl in 1759.

A major renovation of the church was completed in 1869 at the expense of Juliana, the wife of the 2nd Earl of Leicester. This cost £9,000. She died the following year and has a striking sculpted memorial in the north chapel of the church. The unusual mausoleum in the west wall of the churchyard was built for Juliana in the 1870s, but her body was transferred in 1905 to the Coke family plot on the south side of the churchyard.

Inside the parish church there are several other memorials to various members of the Coke family of Holkham Hall. During the post medieval period, many Cokes were also buried in St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Tittleshall.

==Media==
* All the Peenemünde sequences of the 1965 film &quot;Operation Crossbow&quot; featuring German attempts to make the V-1 fly were filmed at Holkham Gap. The mass grave sequence at Holkham was filmed using male extras recruited from nearby Wells-next-the-Sea and – as a result – the film used to show at the former Wells cinema for several weeks a year during the late 1960s.
* Several parts of the 1976 film &quot;The Eagle Has Landed&quot;, starring Michael Caine, Donald Sutherland and Robert Duvall, were filmed on Holkham Beach and in the pinewoods.
* The final scenes of &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; (1998) were filmed on the beach.
* The music video for &quot;Pure Shores&quot;, by All Saints, for the 2000 film &quot;The Beach&quot;, was filmed here.
* A number of beach scenes for the &quot;Avengers&quot; episode &quot;The Town of No Return&quot; (1965) were filmed at Holkham Gap.
* Parts of the ITV1 drama &quot;Kingdom&quot;, featuring comedian Stephen Fry, were filmed on Wells and Holkham Beaches.

<doc id="1009596" wikidata="Q6771395" url="?curid=1009596" title="Marksmanship Device">
<text>A Marksmanship Ribbon device is primarily a miniature metal rifle, pistol, target, service star, or letter E or S which may be worn if authorized on a Marksmanship Ribbon awarded to members of the United States Coast Guard, United States Air Force, and United States Navy.

==Air Force==
The Air Force use a bronze service star on top of their marksmanship ribbon to represent a qualification of expert in an additional weapon other than the one that originally earned the Airman the qualification ribbon. The Air Force&#x27;s Small Arms Expert Marksmanship Ribbon, as it is known, is awarded to those who qualify as expert with either the service rifle or service pistol.

==Navy and Coast Guard==
The Navy and Coast Guard present two marksmanship ribbon devices for scoring as a Sharpshooter or Expert on a pistol and rifle qualification course:
the bronze &quot;S&quot; device and silver &quot;E&quot; device for the Navy and silver &quot;S&quot; and &quot;E&quot; devices for the Coast Guard. The Air Force uses a &quot; bronze star to indicate expert qualification in both rifle and pistol. The Coast Guard also has additional ribbon devices which represent accomplishments in Civilian Marksmanship Program (CMP) sanctioned competitions.

The Expert Marksmanship device should not be confused with the Battle E Device. The Navy and Coast Guard Expert Marksmanship device is worn on the Marksmanship Ribbon in lieu of the full sized Marksmanship Medal. When wearing the Marksmanship Medal, the Marksmanship Ribbon with the Expert device is not worn. For a period of time, the &quot;E Device&quot; was bronze until three consecutive expert qualifications were achieved, then the device would change to silver with a permanent award status.

Coast Guardsman who have been awarded the bronze or silver Coast Guard Excellence-in-Competition (EIC) Pistol Shot or Rifleman Badge can wear a bronze or silver miniature replica of the M1911 or M14 attached to the U.S. Coast Guard Pistol or Rifle Marksmanship Ribbon, respectively, in lieu of wearing the EIC badge(s). Likewise, Coast Guardsman who have been awarded the Coast Guard Distinguished Pistol Shot or Marksman Badge can place a small gold metal replica of a pistol or rifle target, respectively, on the appropriate marksmanship ribbon vice having to wear the distinguished badge(s) on their dress uniforms.

From 1942 to 1960, the Navy awarded unique Distinguished Marksmanship Ribbons vs. devices for their existing marksmanship ribbons. Today, only Distinguished Marksmanship Badges are authorized for wear on Navy uniforms.

==National Guard==

Some State National Guard organizations also award marksmanship ribbons to their top shooters. In the Missouri National Guard, the top twelve guardsmen selected to represent their state at the Winston P. Wilson Rifle and Pistol Championships are awarded a Governor&#x27;s Twelve Ribbon. Any guardsman who earns the award more than once wear a bronze or silver Hawthorn Cluster device(s) on top of the ribbon. A bronze Hawthorn Cluster notes the award of a second and succeeding awards, while a silver Hawthorn Cluster is worn in lieu of five bronze Hawthorn Clusters.

<doc id="1009601" wikidata="Q7865829" url="?curid=1009601" title="USA Roller Sports">
<text>USA Roller Sports (USARS), formerly the United States Amateur Confederation of Roller Skating, is the national governing body of competitive roller sports (inline skating and roller skating) in the United States. It is recognized by the International Roller Sports Federation (FIRS) and the United States Olympic Committee.

USA Roller Sports has sponsored amateur roller skating competitions at the regional and national level since 1937 in figure skating, speed skating and roller hockey; and since 2011 in roller derby. USARS has been the United States representative for the International Federation of Roller Sports (FIRS) since 1972, when it obtained this designation after the merger of two predecessor roller skating federations (the Roller Skating Rink Operators&#x27; Association or RSROA established in 1937, and the U. S. Amateur Roller Skating Association, or USARSA). The organization exercises jurisdiction over matters pertaining to the participation of United States roller skaters in international competition, including existing or potential Pan American Games and Olympic Games participation.
The USARS mission statement is: &quot;USARS is dedicated to creating, enhancing and conducting the best competitions and programs for roller sports. We instill the drive to win and be the absolute best… in sport and in life.&quot;

USA Hockey Inline was one of two governing bodies for the sport of inline hockey in the United States. It was created in December 1994 by USA Hockey. On May 10, 2011, USA Hockey announced that it was terminating its inline program, and that all inline hockey memberships would expire on August 31, 2011, and encouraged USA Hockey inline members to transfer to USARS.

==Roller sports disciplines==

In its bylaws, USARS acknowledges &quot;artistic&quot;, &quot;speed&quot;, &quot;roller derby&quot; and &quot;hockey&quot; discipline categories. Its membership application for individuals, however, includes the following categories:

*&quot;figure&quot; refers to roller figure skating, including singles, pairs, dance, figure, and precision
*&quot;speed&quot; refers to inline speed skating
*&quot;roller derby&quot; was accepted as an official discipline in 2011
*&quot;rink hockey&quot; refers to quad skate roller hockey
*&quot;inline hockey&quot; refers to inline skate roller hockey
*&quot;recreation&quot; refers to fitness skating and jam skating (recreational dance skating)
*&quot;aggressive&quot; refers to skateboarding and aggressive inline skating

USARS also accepts organizations (teams and leagues) and noncompeting members (coaches and officials, typically).

==Competitions Organized==
The USA Roller Sports is responsible for many competitions taking place each year.
One of the biggest is USA Rink Hockey National Championship.

==Olympic status==
The sport is part of the Pan American Games and the World Games and is noted as an Olympic Recognized sport. In 2005, the International Olympic Committee selected Roller Sports among four other sports for consideration into the Olympic Games. In particular, Inline Speedskating was chosen and submitted for consideration. In the 1990s, hockey was slated as a demonstration sport but was never added as a full-fledged member of the Olympic Games&#x27; program.

FIRS President Aracu has recently set up a multimedia site to make rollerskating sports more visible to the IOC. Enter that site from http://www.rollersports.tv/ So far figure rollerskating and inline speed skating are represented in online videos. Pres. Aracu also has posted on that site a few letters documenting some of the steps he has taken to promote international speed skating.

FIRS and the CIC proposed to the International Olympic Committee that inline speedskating be the rollerskating discipline presented at the 2012 Summer Games. http://olympic.patincarrera.com/eng/news.html

In February 2012 IOC President Jacques Rogge told reporters that rollersports are one of eight sports in consideration for the 2020 Olympics.

==Controversy==
In October 2001, USA Hockey, the national governing body of ice hockey in the United States, challenged USARS jurisdiction over roller hockey; however, the United States Olympic Committee continues to reaffirm the charter of roller sports, eligible in the summer Olympics, to USA Roller Sports.

In the meantime, USA Hockey formed a separate branch called USA Hockey InLine that is also promoting inline hockey events, but did not send a national team to the FIRS Inline Hockey World Championships.

USA Hockey InLine does field its own national team, but it takes part in the IIHF Inline Hockey World Championships, a separate event operated by the International Ice Hockey Federation since 1996.

In response, USA Roller Sports aligned itself with the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) to help with growth and legitimacy of its hockey programs.

Top roller hockey players have often shifted their allegiance from one organization to the other depending on opportunities. In some cases, players will appear at both World Championships in the same year.

On May 10, 2011, USA Hockey announced that it was terminating its inline program, and that all inline hockey memberships would expire on August 31, 2011, and encouraged USA Hockey inline members to transfer to USARS.

Since 2011, USARS has been in an ongoing controversy with the Women&#x27;s Flat Track Derby Association and the affiliated Men&#x27;s Roller Derby Association, with competing rules sets for playing roller derby.

<text>T.61 is an ITU-T Recommendation for a Teletex character set. T.61 predated Unicode,
and was the primary character set in ASN.1 used in early versions of X.500 and X.509
for encoding strings containing characters used in Western European languages. It is also used by older versions of LDAP. While T.61 continues to be supported in modern versions of X.500 and X.509, it has been deprecated in favor of Unicode. It is also called Code page 1036, CP1036, or IBM 01036.

While ASN.1 does see wide use and the T.61 character set is used on some standards using ASN.1 (for example in RSA Security&#x27;s PKCS #9), the 1988-11 version of the T.61 standard itself was superseded by a never-published 1993-03 version; the 1993-03 version was withdrawn by the ITU-T. The 1988-11 version is still available.

T.61 was one of the encodings supported by Mozilla software in email and HTML until 2014, when the supported encodings were limited to those in the WHATWG Encoding Standard (although T.61 remained supported for LDAP).

<doc id="1009610" wikidata="Q7786270" url="?curid=1009610" title="This Sporting Life (radio program)">
<text>This Sporting Life was a culturally iconic Triple J radio comedy programme, created by award-winning actor-writer-comedians John Doyle and Greig Pickhaver, who performed as their characters Roy and HG. Broadcast from 1986 to 2008, it was one of the longest-running, most popular and most successful radio comedy programmes of the television era in Australia. Undoubtedly the longest-running show in Triple J&#x27;s programming history, it commanded a large and dedicated nationwide audience throughout its 22-year run.

The title &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; was taken from the novel and 1963 film of the same name.

&quot;This Sporting Life&quot; was added to the National Film and Sound Archive&#x27;s Sounds of Australia registry in 2013.

==Early years==
Often referred to by its acronym, TSL, the show was a parody of sporting panel programmes, although the duo cast a wide comedic net that encompassed entertainment, politics, celebrity and contemporary Australian culture in general. It was modeled to some extent on the popular 1980s Melbourne radio sports comedy panel show &quot;Punter to Punter&quot;, which also featured Pickhaver (as HG Nelson) as a panel member and which was primarily concerned with the world of horse and greyhound racing. Interviewed in 2000, John Doyle cited controversial broadcaster John Laws as a major influence:

:&quot;We started with &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; and what we did was anti-commercial. We modeled it, in the early days, on the John Laws show, constant self-promotion and constant promotion of products that were your own.&quot;

Although TSL was not an instant hit—some Triple J listeners at first mistook it for a real sports show—it soon found a loyal audience in Sydney, and this grew into a substantial nationwide following in the 1990s as Triple J expanded to become a national network.

TSL was also notable as one of the few successful topical comedy programmes that was substantially improvised. Doyle and Pickhaver would reportedly meet on the morning of the broadcast to discuss the week&#x27;s events and agree on a general list of topics, but almost all of their discussions were improvised, live to air. The consistent high quality of their humour is doubly remarkable given the show&#x27;s long-running time of three hours every Sunday afternoon (originally four hours on Saturdays).

==Guests and comedy segments==
Aside from their improvised commentary, over the years, &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; included numerous scripted, pre-recorded segments, such as the topical satire commentaries &quot;The Nelson Report&quot; and &quot;Date&#x27;s Up, With Roy Slaven&quot;.

There was also a series of regular live feature segments; one of the earliest of these was &quot;Tips from the Other Side&quot;, in which HG Nelson would list predictions for forthcoming sporting fixtures which had been provided by contacting the spirits of deceased celebrities. According to HG, many of these tips were provided thanks to the spirit of the late British &quot;psychic&quot; Doris Stokes, who acted as an intermediary. During one of these segments it was revealed that the spirits of the Russian Royal Family were avid fans of Rugby league. For several years in the late 1980s the show also featured a weekly satirical roundup of entertainment at local Sydney clubs.

Guests appeared on the programme in the early days, such as comedian Angela Webber in the guise of &quot;punk granny&quot; Lillian Pascoe, but guest appearances were gradually eliminated as the years passed. However the duo maintained an enduring relationship with actor Robbie McGregor who, in the guise of &quot;King Wally Otto in the Soundproof Booth&quot;, provided the introduction, links and a wide variety of parodic fake advertisements. Australian Big Brother host Gretel Killeen and actor-comedian Jonathan Biggins have also provided voice-overs for many fake ads, including the ongoing series of fictitious products and services provided by Nelson-Slaven Industries.

In the last few years of the series comedian Chris Taylor from The Chaser filled in for John Doyle, broadcasting alongside HG Nelson on the occasions when Doyle was absent due to &quot;other media commitments&quot;.

Aside from the regular improvised discussions and fake ads, one of the show&#x27;s most enduring features was the listener giveaway segment, &quot;The Fat&quot;, two of which occurred per show (&quot;the first Fat of the afternoon&quot;, typically open to women only, and &quot;the second Fat of the afternoon&quot;, open to all comers). In these competitions, listeners were asked to phone in with the answer to a question sourced from one of that afternoon&#x27;s wide-ranging and often fantastical discussions of sporting news and personalities, for example: &quot;Who is known as the founding father of Russian rugby league&quot;?

==Advertising parodies==
Doyle and Pickhaver wrote dozens of parody advertisements for a vast range of imaginary products and services provided by Roy and HG&#x27;s numerous fictional companies, most of which were gathered under the Nelson-Slaven Industries banner.

These included services such as the HG Nelson Butchery -- &quot;still doing things with meat other butchers only dream of&quot; -- &quot;Roy&#x27;s Rectal Ring Balm&quot; (a rectal ointment) and &quot;Happy Jack&#x27;s Ta-taa Packs&quot; (a body bag), Angus Fraser Paints &#x27;If you&#x27;ve got nothing to say the whole world can hear it&#x27; -- as well as innumerable parody books, films and TV series. Other highlights included a long-running series of fake ads for &quot;Istengar&quot;, an esoteric branch of yoga that teaches practitioners how to create works of art from their own faeces. Another fake ad (satirising the Nine Network&#x27;s &quot;The Footy Show&quot;), promotes Rex Mossop&#x27;s Rugby League Finishing School, which offers training to footballers hoping to pursue a career in the media.

One advertisement parodied mathematics, possibly with the help of Adam Spencer: (Young woman&#x27;s voice:) &quot;The Mandelbrot set: You&#x27;ve heard about it, you&#x27;ve seen it... now try the fragrance modelled on it: A fragrance that is... &#x27;indescribable&#x27;.&quot;

In later years, real-life sporting stars such as rugby league players Stan Jurd and Paul Sironen also recorded parodic voice-overs for the show promoting fictional bodies such as the &quot;National Rugby League Party&quot;, a fictitious political organisation.

In its last years TSL introduced another popular recurring voice-over character, Sydney car dealer Frosty Lahood (voiced by ABC NewsRadio sports reporter David Lord), whose famous &quot;No root: no toot&quot; deal offered customers their money back if the attractive new vehicle (usually a Daewoo Nubira or Hyundai Lantra) did not enable the buyer to &quot;get a root&quot; (i.e. have sex) within 24 hours of purchase.

Another parody was the &quot;Alan Jones Scouts for God&quot; child day-care centre, offering all-day child care for only five dollars. The slogan of the Alan Jones Scouts for God was: &quot;If the kids are happy, and you&#x27;re happy, there&#x27;s a fair chance we&#x27;re happy too&quot;.

==The South Coast News==
One of the show&#x27;s most popular scripted segments was &quot;The South Coast News&quot;, a parody news bulletin read by real-life journalist and TV presenter Paul Murphy. It ran for several years in the late 1980s and early 1990s and two volumes of scripts were later published in book form, with illustrations by cartoonist Bill Leak, who had an enduring relationship with the duo.

The basic conceit of the sketch was that the small New South Wales south coast town of Ulladulla was heavily populated by famous Australian sporting and show business identities, that many of these celebrities owned businesses in the area or worked in various official capacities in the town, and that all were regularly involved in hilarious and often ribald misadventures.

Prominent recurring characters included the town&#x27;s mayor, renowned TV composer and conductor Tommy Tycho, former TV wrestler Mario Milano, owner of the Bluebird Cafe, and former NSW Premier Barrie Unsworth, owner of the disreputable &#x27;Cardigan Club&#x27;. This fictional Ulladulla also boasted a colossal statue of long-distance swimmer Linda McGill (&quot;The Big Linda&quot;, which stood astride the entrance to the boat harbour and featured a revolving restaurant in its head). All the streets were named after sporting or TV stars, and the local high school was named after rugby league player Barry Beath.

==Humour and terms==
Much of Roy and HG&#x27;s comedy is topical, poking fun at current sporting news, the foibles, ego trips and media gaffes of sporting, film and music stars, and the often risible phraseology used by sporting writers and commentators.

Doyle and Pickhaver also interweave their dialogue with a colourful and uniquely Australian form of linguistic comedy that often verges on the obscene, although they very rarely use &quot;four-letter words&quot; unless particularly enraged.

Over the years they have coined many memorable parodic words and terms, while others revive archaic expressions from their youth, and many have since entered the vernacular in Australia.

Many listeners will be familiar with the TSL lexicon, which includes words and phrases such as:

*&quot;bed flute&quot; or simply &quot;flute&quot;—the male sex organ
*&quot;bugger-all to the power of less&quot;—nothing
*&quot;bush-junk&quot;—useless native or introduced wild animals, suitable only for shooting
*&quot;date&quot;—anus
*&quot;dwahl&quot;—a slump in sporting form or a period of poor performance
*&quot;football head&quot;—the Zen-like focus or mindset required to play a good game of footy; underperforming players are often described as not having their football head on
*&quot;half dream room, the&quot;—an unconscious state, usually derived from a concussion; HG often claimed certain players were at their best when playing concussed
*&quot;horizontal folk dancing&quot;—sexual intercourse
*&quot;(Planet) Koozbane&quot;—a perennial Nelson-ism applied to sportspersons who have been stunned by a heavy blow, fall or tackle. The term is believed to derive from the name of the home planet of the alien puppet characters featured on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; and &quot;Sesame Street&quot;
*&quot;love-tap&quot;—a blow inflicted on another player (usually during League or ARL games) without the intention of inflicting serious harm
*&quot;night-tools&quot;—genital organs
*&quot;night-tool work&quot;—sexual intercourse
*&quot;room of mirrors, the&quot;—a metaphorical mirror-lined room to which players are (or should be) banished for a period of time, in order to renew their motivation by &quot;taking a long, hard look at themselves&quot;
*&quot;set of seven&quot;—one week, in reference to the expression &quot;set of six&quot; (tackles) from Rugby league
*&quot;sloop&quot;—penis; the organ is said to be &quot;pointing north&quot; when erect
*&quot;stink&quot;—a fight
*&quot;Sweet Science, The&quot;—boxing
*&quot;yips, the&quot;—a grave condition that adversely affects the performance of professional golfers

The duo are well known for their lengthy, hyperbolic dissertations on the characters of sporting and cultural identities. Roy is renowned for his long-winded and extremely colourful demolition of almost every conceivable aspect of the personality and performance of a sports star with whom he is displeased.

He will often describe the subject as &quot;a hopeless joke&quot;, and declare that they are a fool to him/herself and to his/her family, state and country of origin; this climactic phase of his analysis is usually delivered at the top of his voice. Yet, paradoxically, Roy almost invariably concludes these harangues with quiet, amiable remarks on what a nice person the subject is, how much he likes them, and how much he or she has contributed to their particular field of endeavour. This can also be reversed such as when commentating the first Melbourne Grand Prix he praised the track as &quot;the best in the world... superior to Monza, Spa and Hockenheim&quot; which were all &quot;rubbish&quot;. When there was a big crash on the first corner he claimed the track was to blame because it was &quot;a joke&quot;.

Although usually more concise than Roy, and typically taking the role of presenter/interviewer who sets out the subject and poses questions for Roy to comment on, HG Nelson has his own unique and colourful editorial style. On many occasions he has described decisions or innovations with which he disagrees as &quot;a hastily cobbled-together farrago&quot;. He once promised that he would &quot;walk nude down George Street with a pie on my head&quot; if the outcome of a sporting fixture did not match his prediction, and during one especially memorable rant he denounced golfer Greg Norman as:

:&quot;... a hapless water buffalo, wallowing around in the swamp, waiting for the safari to wander by and finish him off&quot;.

In his roundup of the 2006 Melbourne Cup, Nelson described the unusual hat he had worn to the event, which was fashioned in the form of a miniature chicken-processing factory, and which automatically dispensed tiny chickens for &quot;the kiddies&quot;. The duo have also long been advocates of the concept of employing &quot;celebrity shooters&quot; at racing fixtures—i.e. hiring well-known personalities to &#x27;put down&#x27; horses that are badly injured during races and in 2008 they energetically promoted the concept of a national pig-shoot for peace.

TV programming is another favourite target for duo&#x27;s satire. Responding to the growth in reality TV programming, Roy suggested several innovative new programmes including &quot;Celebrities With Gastric&quot; and &quot;Celebrity Horses With Gastric&quot;.

Cricket legend Sir Donald Bradman has long been a target of the duo&#x27;s satire, and it is now well established—at least according to Roy &amp; HG—that Bradman was a spy for the Japanese during World War II. They have also deduced that, in his twilight years, &quot;The Don&quot; was locked in a shed at the back of his house in Bowral, NSW and forced to sign millions of items of all descriptions in order to capitalise on the inevitably lucrative market in Bradman memorabilia that would emerge after his death.

==This Sporting Life Terminology==
==Roy Slaven==
Another perennial aspect of their comedy is the overweening egotism and impossible achievements of &quot;Rampaging&quot; Roy Slaven, a character who was probably inspired by sports broadcaster and former professional rugby league footballer Rex Mossop, who was famous for his outspoken opinions and hilarious tautologies.

Roy will often begin his commentaries &quot;sotto voce&quot; as a mocking parody of Sydney radio announcer Alan Jones, but often finishes screaming at the top of his lungs. By his own account, Slaven has represented Australia in every known sport for most of the 20th century, has ridden in every Melbourne Cup (and won most of them) on his ageless mount Rooting King, is on intimate terms with every major sports, TV, music and film personality in modern history, as well as being a close personal friend of many top racehorses and greyhounds.

Roy&#x27;s tales of sporting achievement are mixed with reminiscences of his youth in Lithgow, his membership of the rambunctious Lithgow Shamrocks rugby league team, and his formative relationship with mentor and coach &#x27;Grassy&#x27; Grannal. Doyle gives a strong scatological edge to the Slaven character and Roy&#x27;s commentaries and recollections often include hilarious anecdotes about celebrities or teammates who were stricken by attacks of vomiting and diarrhoea—invariably referred to by the quaint Australian term &quot;gastric&quot;.

Other memorable Slaven recollections have included the assistance he gave to music star Cher during her bout with chronic fatigue syndrome—which included a daily regimen in which Slaven tied Cher to the back of a car and dragged her behind it for several kilometres—and his revelation that American film actress Kim Basinger planned to buy her home town, rename it &quot;Basingerville&quot; and rebuild it as a showpiece of modern sanitary technology where, thanks to a transparent sewerage system, residents could follow their effluent all the way from toilet to outfall.

==State of Origin commentaries==
Besides &quot;This Sporting Life&quot;, Roy and HG also provide radio commentary for Australian rugby league&#x27;s three annual State of Origin series matches, as well as the NRL and AFL grand finals (dubbed the &quot;Festival of the Boot&quot;, parts one and two).

At the opening of each State of Origin match (and the Grand Finals) Roy and HG traditionally drown out the obligatory rendition of the Australian national anthem—typically performed at the actual event by a minor Australian music celebrity—by playing the lugubrious country-and-western song &quot;I Thank You&quot;, recorded in 1969 by former boxing champion Lionel Rose.

The choice of this song seems to have been inspired by several interconnected satirical motives—the appalling standard of Rose&#x27;s vocal performance, the clichéd sentimentality of the lyrics (&quot;When a boy becomes a man, he must do the best he can&quot;), the inherent violence associated with the former boxer, Rose, and the ironic satire implicit in the phenomenon of a former sports champion (with a very poor singing voice) attempting to establish a career in popular music by recording a prosaic genre love song written by a faded 1960s pop star (Johnny Young).

The duo, particularly Slaven&#x27;s, commentary often features sensationalist over-reactions to the game at hand, such as calling for entire teams of players to be sacked after losses, or even questioning whether certain teams will ever win another match in the future. The commentary is also notable for its overly biased support of whichever team is winning, and the calling of every player on the field by their Roy &amp; HG-assigned nicknames.

On many occasions, the opening minutes of their &#x27;call&#x27; have featured Roy&#x27;s scathing comments on the various celebrities he has encountered at the match, and his vociferous denunciation of the often hilariously bad pre-match and half-time &quot;entertainment&quot;, which regularly feature massed displays by large groups of &quot;kiddies&quot; with &quot;ballooowens&quot; (balloons) and stilted performances by imported has-been stars like Billy Idol and Tina Turner, whose only real connection to The Game is the hefty paycheque they receive from the NSWRL for their brief appearances.

==Television==
As well as performing &#x27;This Sporting Life&#x27; on radio, Doyle and Pickhaver successfully transferred the concept and characters to television. Over the last ten years they have hosted a range of TV incarnations of the TSL format. The huge popularity of one of these, &quot;The Dream with Roy and HG&quot;, took Roy &amp; HG&#x27;s unique comedy style to thousands of Australians who had never listened to the radio show or watched the ABC series.

==Recognition at Australian Comedy Awards==
In November 2003, This Sporting Life was named Outstanding Networked Radio Comedy Performance at the inaugural Australian Comedy Awards in Melbourne.

==Departure from Triple J and subsequent radio projects==
On 3 December 2008 Triple J announced that Roy and HG would be leaving the ABC after 22 years on air. In a press statement, Triple J manager Linda Bracken said:
:&quot;They are more than a radio programme, they have become their own radio comedy genre. It&#x27;s been a joy and a privilege to work with them.&quot;

Although HG Nelson had announced at the end of the previous week&#x27;s show that they would return on Sunday 7 December for the last programme of the year, it did not go ahead as scheduled and was replaced by a music shift.

Roy and HG began broadcasting on Triple M on 12 January 2009, with a show called &quot;The Life&quot; presented during drive time at 4pm to 7pm every Monday and Friday on all Triple M stations, excluding Adelaide. Like &quot;This Sporting Life&quot;, it was a wideranging sport/comedy show, and also uses some phases from TSL. The series was later cut back to one episode per week, and concluded in May 2011. It was followed by the duo&#x27;s short Olympics commentary series &quot;Roy &amp; HG&#x27;s Mardi Gras of Medals&quot;, broadcast on Triple M during August 2016.

In 2017 the duo returned to Triple M, presenting &quot;The Sporting Probe&quot;, a weekly two-hour program which was also distributed (minus music and advertisements) as a podcast. The series concluded in early December 2018.

In 2019 Roy and HG signed with the Macquarie Sports Radio network and presented a weekly two-hour program, &quot;Just Short of a Length&quot;. The series ran throughout 2019 but was terminated towards the end of that year when MSR cancelled all its &quot;talk&quot; content.

In March 2020 Roy and HG finally returned to the ABC after a twelve-year absence when they were commissioned to present a new weekly two-hour program, &quot;Bludging on the Blindside&quot;, presented on Saturdays at midday on the ABC Grandstand digital radio channel, on ABC local radio, and as a podcast.

<doc id="1009620" wikidata="Q645961" url="?curid=1009620" title="Rail transport in Australia">
<text>Rail transport in Australia is a component of the Australian transport system. It is to a large extent state-based, as each state largely has its own operations, with the interstate network being developed ever since Australia&#x27;s federation in 1901. , the Australian rail network consists of a total of of track built to three major track gauges: of standard gauge (1435 mm / 4 ft 8 in), of broad gauge (1600 mm / 5 ft 3 in), and of narrow gauge (1067 mm / 3 ft 6 in) lines. Additionally, about of 610 mm / 2 ft gauge lines support the sugar-cane industry. , around 11 percent of the Australian heavy railways network route-kilometres are electrified.

Except for a small number of private railways, most of the Australian railway network infrastructure is government-owned, either at the federal or state level. The Australian federal government is involved in the formation of national policies, and provides funding for national projects. 

==National issues==
===Uniform gauge===
Very little thought was given in the early years of the development of the colony-based rail networks of Australia-wide interests. The most obvious issue to arise was determining a track gauge. Despite advice from London to adopt a uniform gauge, should the lines of the various colonies ever meet, gauges were adopted in different colonies, and indeed within colonies, without reference to those of other colonies. This has caused problems ever since.

Attempts to fix the gauge problem are by no means complete. For example, the Mount Gambier line is isolated by gauge and of no operational value.

=== Electrification ===

With the electrification of suburban networks, which began in 1919, a consistent electric rail traction standard was not adopted. Electrification began in Melbourne in 1919 using 1500 V DC. Sydney&#x27;s lines were electrified from 1926 using 1500 V DC, Brisbane&#x27;s from 1979 using 25 kV AC, and Perth&#x27;s from 1992 using 25 kV AC. There has also been extensive non-urban electrification in Queensland using 25 kV AC, mainly during the 1980s for the coal routes. From 2014 Adelaide&#x27;s lines are being gradually electrified at 25 kV AC. 25 kV AC voltage has now become the international standard.

==History==

The first railways in Australia were built by private companies, based in the then colonies of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia.

The first railway was privately owned and operated and commissioned by the Australian Agricultural Company in Newcastle in 1831, a cast-iron fishbelly rail on an inclined plane as a gravitational railway servicing &quot;A Pit&quot; coal mine. The first steam-powered line opened in Victoria in 1854. The four km long Flinders Street to Sandridge line was opened by the Melbourne &amp; Hobson&#x27;s Bay Railway Company at the height of the Victorian gold rush.

In these early years there was very little thought of Australia-wide interests in developing the colony-based networks. The most obvious issue to arise was determining a uniform gauge for the continent. Despite advice from London to adopt a uniform gauge, should the lines of the various colonies ever meet, gauges were adopted in different colonies, and indeed within colonies, without reference to those of other colonies. This example has caused problems ever since at the national level.

In the 1890s, the establishment of an Australian Federation from the six colonies was debated. One of the points of discussion was the extent that railways would be a federal responsibility. A vote to make it so was lost narrowly, instead the new constitution allows &quot;the acquisition, with the consent of a State, of any railways of the State on terms arranged between the Commonwealth and the State&quot; (Section 51 xxxiii) and &quot;railway construction and extension in any State with the consent of that State&quot; (Section 51 xxxiv). However, the Australian Government is free to provide funding to the states for rail upgrading projects under Section 96 (&quot;the Parliament may grant financial assistance to any State on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit&quot;).

Suburban electrification began in Melbourne in 1919 (1500 V DC). Sydney&#x27;s lines were electrified from 1926 (1500 V DC), Brisbane&#x27;s from 1979 (25 kV AC), and Perth&#x27;s from 1992 (25 kV AC). Mainline electrification was first carried out in Victoria in 1954, closely followed by New South Wales which continued to expand their network. These networks have fallen into decline, in contrast to Queensland where 25 kV AC equipment was introduced from the 1980s for coal traffic.

Diesel locomotives were introduced to Australian railways from the early 1950s. Most units were of local design and construction, using imported British or American technology and power equipment. The three major firms were Clyde Engineering partnered with GM-EMD, Goninan with General Electric, and AE Goodwin (later Comeng) with the American Locomotive Company (ALCO). The major British company was English Electric, with Swiss firm Sulzer also supplying some equipment. This continues today, with Downer Rail and UGL Rail the modern incarnations of Clyde and Goninan respectively.

==Government funding==

While Australian federal governments have provided substantial funding for the upgrading of roads, since the 1920s they have not regularly funded investment in railways except for their own railway, the Commonwealth Railways, later Australian National Railways, which was privatised in 1997. They have considered the funding of railways owned by State Governments to be a State responsibility.

Nevertheless, Australian governments have made loans to the states for gauge standardisation projects from the 1920s to the 1970s. From the 1970s to 1996, the Australian Government has provided some grant funding to the States for rail projects, particularly the Keating Government&#x27;s One Nation program, announced in 1992, which was notable for standardising the Adelaide to Melbourne line in 1995. Significant government funding was also made available for the Alice Springs to Darwin line, opened in 2004. Substantial funding is now being made available for freight railways through the Australian Rail Track Corporation and the AusLink land transport funding program.

===Australian Rail Track Corporation===

The Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC) is a federal government owned corporation established in 1997 that owns, leases, maintains and controls the majority of main line standard gauge railway lines on the mainland of Australia, known as the Designated Interstate Rail Network (DIRN).

In 2003 the Australian and New South Wales Governments agreed that ARTC would lease the NSW interstate and Hunter Valley networks for 60 years. As part of this agreement, ARTC agreed to a $872 million investment programme on the interstate rail network. The funding sources for the investment included an Australian Government equity injection into ARTC of $143 million and a funding contribution of almost $62 million by the New South Wales Government.

===AusLink===
Under the AusLink program introduced in July 2004, the Australian Government has introduced the opportunity for rail to gain access to funds on a similar basis to that of roads. AusLink established a defined national network (superseding the former National Highway system) of important road and rail infrastructure links and their intermodal connections.

Rail funding has been announced for signalling upgrades to numerous railway lines, gauge conversion of existing broad gauge lines in Victoria to standard gauge, new rail links to intermodal freight precincts, and extensions to existing crossing loops to permit longer trains to operate.

Funding is focused on the National Network, including the following rail corridors, connecting at one or both ends to State Capital Cities:
* Sydney–Melbourne railway
* Sydney–Brisbane railway
*Sydney to Adelaide, via Sydney–Melbourne railway to Cootamundra and then the Cootamundra–Parkes line, Parkes–Crystal Brook line and the Adelaide–Darwin railway
* Melbourne-Adelaide railway
*Adelaide to Perth – Sydney–Perth railway
* Adelaide–Darwin railway
*Brisbane to Townsville – the North Coast railway line in Queensland
*Townsville to Mount Isa
* Hobart to Burnie, including link to Bell Bay, Tasmania
*Melbourne to Mildura via Geelong
* Sydney to Dubbo
*Some urban links in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide, connecting the long distance links to each other and to ports and airports
* Hunter Region rail links from Dubbo to Newcastle via the Dubbo-Merrygoen, Merrygoen–Binnaway, Binnaway–Werris Creek and Werris Creek–Port of Newcastle lines and the Merrygoen–Gulgong, Merrygoen–Sandy Hollow and Sandy Hollow–Muswellbrook lines

=== Infrastructure Australia ===
After the 2007 federal election, the government body Infrastructure Australia was created to oversee all rail, road, airports and other infrastructure at a national level.

==Rail infrastructure==

Construction and maintenance of network infrastructure is consolidated into non-profit government bodies and contracted private: in the case of the interstate network and various non-urban railways of New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia, the Australian Government-owned Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC); the New South Wales Regional Network, John Holland Rail; and rail infrastructure throughout the southern half of Western Australia, Arc Infrastructure.

ARTC &quot;has a working relationship with Queensland Rail about the use of the 127 kilometres of standard gauge line between the Queensland border and Fisherman Island. ARTC intends to start discussions with Queensland about leasing this track once the NSW arrangements are bedded down&quot;. ARTC also maintains the NSW Hunter Valley network under contract.

On 1 January 2012, John Holland commenced the operation and maintenance of the New South Wales Regional Network under contract from Transport for NSW, comprising 2,700 kilometres of operational freight and passenger rail lines.

Arc Infrastructure has a lease until 2049 on 5,100 kilometres of Western Australian rail infrastructure, from Geraldton in the north, to Leonora and Kalgoorlie in the east, and south to Esperance, Albany and Bunbury. It is responsible for maintaining the network and granting access to operators.

Other railways continue to be integrated, although access to their infrastructure is generally required under National Competition Policy principles agreed by the Federal, State and Territory governments:
* Queensland – Queensland Rail and Aurizon
* Tasmania – TasRail
* Victorian non-interstate lines – V/Line and Metro Trains Melbourne
* South Australian non-interstate lines – Aurizon
* Tarcoola-Darwin line - Aurizon

Inland Rail is a railway construction project extending from Melbourne to Brisbane along a route west of the Great Dividing Range. Construction in stages commenced in 2018 and is scheduled to be completed in 2025, using existing routes where appropriate.

==Operators==
===Rail freight===
The major freight operators on the rail networks (excluding integrated mining railways) are:
* Aurizon
* Pacific National
* Qube Logistics
* SCT Logistics

Other rail freight operators include:
* Bowmans Rail
* East Coast Rail
* Southern Shorthaul Railroad
* TasRail

Licensing of personnel with nationally recognised credentials facilitates the transfer of those employees from one state or operator to another, as traffic demands.

====Total freight movement====
Including the mining railways, in 2015–16, there were 413.5 billion tonne kilometres of freight moved by rail. Overall railway freight in Australia is dominated by bulk freight, primarily iron ore and coal. In 2015–16, Australian railways carried over 1.34 billion tonnes of freight, 97 per cent of which were bulk movements. Intrastate bulk freight in Western Australia, principally iron-ore movements, accounted for 61 per cent of national rail freight tonnes. Bulk movements in Queensland and NSW, principally coal, were 17 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively.
=== Long-distance passenger ===

Unlike the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, Long-distance rail and regional rail in Australia mostly operates on a state-by-state basis. The main companies that provide service are Journey Beyond, NSW TrainLink, Queensland Rail and V/Line.

Journey Beyond operates four long-distance trains, the first three of the following being upmarket &quot;experiential&quot; services:
* &quot;Indian Pacific&quot; (Sydney–Adelaide–Perth): 1 round trip per week

Queensland Rail, a state entity, operates several passenger lines under its train subsidiary. Five routes target the domestic market:
* Spirit of Queensland (Brisbane–Cairns): 3 round trips per week
* Electric Tilt Train (Brisbane–Rockhampton): 12 round trips per week
* &quot;Spirit of the Outback&quot; (Brisbane–Longreach): 2 round trips per week
* &quot;The Westlander&quot; (Brisbane–Charleville): 2 round trips per week
* &quot;The Inlander&quot; (Townsville–Mount Isa): 2 round trips per week

An additional three Queensland Rail routes are aimed at providing tourist services:
* &quot;The Savannahlander&quot; (Cairns–Forsayth): 1 round trip per week (operated under private contract)
* &quot;The Gulflander&quot; (Normanton–Croydon): 1 round trip per week
* Kuranda Scenic Railway (Cairns–Kuranda): daily

The Public Transport Authority, a government agency of Western Australia, operates various buses and four long-distance rail routes through its Transwa subsidiary. All routes originate from Perth:
* &quot;The Prospector&quot;: (Perth-Kalgoorlie) 9 round trips per week
* &quot;AvonLink&quot;: (Perth (Midland)–Northam) 1 round trip per day
* &quot;MerredinLink&quot;: (Perth–Merredin) 3 round trips per week
* &quot;The Australind&quot;: (Perth–Bunbury) 2 round trips per day

=== Urban rail ===

*Sydney Trains is the state government operator of the Sydney suburban railway network, which is part of the Transport for NSW network.
*Metro Trains Sydney, a private entity whose majority owner is MTR Corporation, operates the Sydney Metro rapid transit line on behalf of Transport for NSW.
*NSW TrainLink, the intercity counterpart of Sydney Trains, provides local suburban services in Newcastle and Wollongong on behalf of Transport for NSW. It also provides services between regional centres and Sydney. These services largely run using double-decker electric trains, with some of the rolling stock used on intercity services shared with Sydney Trains.
*Metro Trains Melbourne, a private entity whose majority owner is MTR Corporation, operates the Melbourne suburban railway network on behalf of Public Transport Victoria.
*V/Line, a state government organisation, operates the Victorian regional rail network, including some services within metropolitan Melbourne, and between Melbourne and regional centres on behalf of Public Transport Victoria.
*Queensland Rail through their City network division (formerly Citytrain) is the state government operator of the South East Queensland railway network, which is part of the Translink network.
*Transperth is the public transport system in Perth. Railways in Perth are operated by the Public Transport Authority
*Keolis Downer operates the Adelaide suburban railway network on behalf of Adelaide Metro. This system features six lines.

==== Urban light rail and trams ====
*Yarra Trams, which is a subsidiary of Keolis Downer, operates the 250 km, 29 lines of the Melbourne tram network.
* Transdev operates the 24.7 km Sydney light rail network, on behalf of Transport for NSW.
* Keolis Downer operates , a 20 km light rail line on the Gold Coast. The line is part of the Translink network.
* Torrens Connect operates the Glenelg tram line in Adelaide. The line is part of the Adelaide Metro network.
* Canberra Metro Operations, a private joint venture between John Holland and Pacific Partnerships, operates the 12 km Canberra Metro light rail line. This line is part of the Transport Canberra network.
* Keolis Downer, locally branded as Newcastle Transport, operated on behalf of Transport for NSW, operates the 2.7 km Newcastle Light Rail line.

=== Tourist and heritage railways ===

There are many heritage railways and heritage tramways in Australia, often run by community organisations and preservation societies. There are also some privately operated passenger services, such as:

*Skitube is a private railway in the New South Wales snowfields. Owned by the Perisher Ski Resort, it connects the main entrance of this tourist destination with ski areas that are inaccessible via road. The line mainly operates underground.
*The Byron Bay Train service operates as a shuttle between Byron Bay station in the Byron Bay township and North Beach station. The privately run service operates on a 3 km section of the disused Murwillimbah line.

==Private railways==

===Cane===
Tramways with gauge for the transport of sugarcane have always been operated as private concerns associated with the relevant sugar cane mill. These tramways are quite advanced technically, with hand-me-down rails cascaded from the normal rails, remote-controlled brake vans, concrete sleepers in places, and tamping machines in miniature. The twenty or so separate tramways cooperate in research and development.

===Timber===
Tramways were often associated with the transport of timber to sawmills. Various gauges were used, including the gauge, which was also commonly used for cane haulage.

Wider gauges were sometimes used as well; Queensland had a number of 991 mm (3 ft 3 in) systems, some on wooden rails. In some areas was used, a considerable investment of resources. In the early 21st century, the disused Queensland Rail line to Esk in the Brisbane Valley was used for timber haulage.

=== Iron ore ===
Five isolated heavy duty railways for the cartage of iron ore in the Pilbara region of Western Australia have always been private concerns operated as part of the production line between mine and port, initially commencing in 1966 with Goldsworthy Mining Associates&#x27; Goldsworthy railway, and recently in 2008 with Fortescue Metals Group&#x27;s Fortescue railway and in 2015 with Roy Hill Holdings&#x27; Roy Hill railway. These lines are continually optimising axle loads (currently the heaviest in the world) and train lengths, that have pushed the limit of the wheel to rail interface and led to much useful research of value to railways worldwide. An open access sixth standard gauge iron ore network was proposed to the Oakajee Port in the Mid-West region to the south of the Pilbara but the project is currently on hold pending a viable business case.

== High-speed rail ==
===Medium-speed passenger services===
Several medium-speed rail services operate on existing track that has been upgraded to accommodate faster services and/or tilting technology. Some of these services use high-speed capable rolling stock.

* In Western Australia, Westrail began using high-speed diesel railcars in 1971 on &quot;The Prospector&quot; service from Perth to Kalgoorlie, and set a new Australian speed record. Now operated by Transwa, the railcars were replaced in 2004 with new units capable of , although track condition currently limits this to . The same type of cars are used on the AvonLink service.
* New South Wales commenced operations with the XPT in 1982. Based on the British InterCity 125 train, it has a maximum service speed of and set an Australian speed record for the time of on a test run in 1992. The train is not often used to its full potential, operating along winding steam-era alignments; for example, the average speed on the Sydney–Melbourne route in 2002 was . New South Wales trialled the Swedish X 2000 tilt train in 1995. Propelled by two specially modified XPT power cars, the train carried passengers between Sydney and Canberra in an eight-week trial.
* Queensland Rail&#x27;s Electric Tilt Train service operates from Brisbane to Rockhampton, while the Diesel Tilt Train service runs from Brisbane to Cairns. These routes were partially upgraded in the 1990s at a cost of $590 million, with the construction of of deviations to straighten curves. Both with a service speed of , the electric train set an Australian rail speed record of in 1999.
* In Victoria, the state government upgraded railway lines as part of the Regional Fast Rail project, with V/Line operating VLocity diesel railcars at a maximum speed of over the lines. In the early stages of the project, the Victorian Government incorrectly referred to it as the &#x27;Fast Train&#x27; or &#x27;Very Fast Train&#x27;, and this practice continues among some politicians and members of the public.

=== High-speed rail ===
High speed rail has been repeatedly raised as an option since the 1980s, and has had bipartisan support for research and land purchase.

The focus usually falls on Sydney to Melbourne, where it is seen as a competitor to the busy Sydney–Melbourne air corridor, with Sydney to Brisbane and (less often) Melbourne to Adelaide also proposed. The benefits of regional city development are frequently raised.

The most recent major study into interstate high-speed rail was undertaken from 2011 to 2013, after which the federal government indicated it would start purchasing land for a rail corridor, however this did not eventuate. In 2016 the prime minister indicated a high-speed rail link might be funded privately and by value capture.

The Queensland Rail Electric Tilt Train&#x27;s record speed of 210 km/h is just above the internationally accepted definition of high-speed rail of 200 km/h (120 mph). The maximum test speed of 193 km/h set by NSW TrainLink&#x27;s XPT is approximately that. The Transwa WDA/WDB/WDC class railcars used on the medium-speed &quot;Transwa Prospector&quot; service are high-speed capable, but are limited to 160 km/h in service. The XPT is also theoretically capable of reaching speeds of 200 km/h.

== Regulation ==

Prior to 1993, the regulation of Australian Railways was under the control of the state-owned operators. The first move away from this arrangement was in New South Wales with the passing of the Rail Safety Act in 1993. This Act moved the regulation away from the NSW State Rail Authority into the independent hands of the Transport Safety Bureau within the NSW Department of Transport. Each rail operator and rail infrastructure owner was accredited by the Regulator under the Rail Safety Act. This was the first such legislation in Australia and gradually, the different states passed similar forms of legislation. 

With the opening up of the national rail network to private operators, the different pieces of state-based legislation provided the growing group of interstate operators with a complicated set of varying requirements for their operations. In December 2009 the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) agreed to establish a national rail safety regulator and develop a rail safety national law that the rail safety regulator would administer. Following an extensive consultation period with industry, governments and unions, a final version of the national legislation was submitted to and approved by the Transport Ministers in November 2011. 

The Rail Safety National Law was first enacted in South Australia in 2012 and all other states and territories have either adopted the RSNL or passed legislation that models it. This legislation created the Office of The National Rail Safety Regulator (ONRSR), based in Adelaide. New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania were the first states to come under ONRSR control from 2013, with other states joining in the following years.

<text>Tales from the Elvenpath is the second compilation album by Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish, released on 18 October 2004 by Drakkar Entertainment. Elvenpath is also the name of another Nightwish song, and although the compilation takes its name from that song, the song itself does not appear on the record, because that song is from the debut album, Angels Fall First, which was recorded with another record label.

&quot;Tales from the Elvenpath&quot; got Gold Disc in Finland, with 20.000 sold copies, and in Germany, with 100.000 sold copies.

<doc id="1009626" wikidata="Q1840362" url="?curid=1009626" title="Teletex">
<text>Teletex was ITU-T specification F.200 for a text and document communications service that could be provided over telephone lines. It was rapidly superseded by e-mail; however, the name &quot;Teletex&quot; lives on in several of the X.500 standard attributes used in Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.

==Overview==
Teletex was designed as an upgrade to the conventional telex service. The terminal-to-terminal communication service of telex would be turned into an office-to-office document transmission system by teletex. Teletex envisaged direct communication between electronic typewriters, word processors and personal computers. These units had storage for transmitting and receiving messages. The use of such equipment considerably enhanced the character set available for document preparation.

==Features==

===Character sets===
In addition to the standard character set, a rich set of graphic symbols and a comprehensive set of control characters were supported in teletex. The set of control characters helped in preparation and reproduction of documents. In particular, they permitted the positioning of the printing element, specification of page orientation, left and right margins, vertical spacing and the use of underlining. The page control feature allowed standard A4 size papers to be used for receiving messages instead of the continuous stationery used in conventional telex systems.

===Transmission and reception===
A background/foreground operation was envisaged in teletex. Transmission/reception of messages should proceed in the background without affecting the work which the user might be carrying out in the foreground with the equipment. In other words, a user might be preparing a new document, while another document was being transmitted or received. The teletex would also maintain compatibility with the present telex system and inter-operate with it. Telex procedures called for the exchange of header information before the actual document transfer took place. The header information consisted of four parts:

* Part 1: Destination ID,
* Part 2: Originator ID,
* Part 3: Date and time stamp,
* Part 4: Document reference.

Twenty-four characters were used for source/destination ids, 14 characters for date and time stamp, and 7 characters for document reference (which also specified the number of pages in the document). Destination/source ID consisted of four fields:

* Field 1: Country/Network code,
* Field 2: National subscriber number,
* Field 3: Reserved for future use,
* Field 4: Terminal/Owner code.

The number of characters allotted to each of the above fields was variable, subject to a maximum for each field, the total being 24 characters.

<doc id="1009633" wikidata="Q2414187" url="?curid=1009633" title="The Shadow of Yserbius">
<text>The Shadow of Yserbius, originally published by Sierra On-Line and developed by Joe Ybarra of Ybarra Productions, was the first of three graphical MUDs for the online community. &quot;The Shadow of Yserbius&quot; and its successors remained online until 1996, when America Online purchased the rights from AT&amp;T for an undisclosed price (rumored to be $40 million). AOL soon abandoned &quot;The Shadow of Yserbius&quot;, which was a competitor to its existing online RPG &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot;.

In late 2007, the ImagiNation Revival Project succeeded in resurrecting the long-dormant ImagiNation Network by using the original client software coupled with DOSBox. &quot;The Shadow of Yserbius&quot; was again available for online play with all features, graphics, sounds, and such fully intact and functional. Macros were fully supported and compatibility with old character and map files was enabled for TSN/INN versions 2.4 and higher. In early 2016, the server was shut down making online play not possible until recently.

The game was followed by two sequels: &quot;The Fates of Twinion&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Ruins of Cawdor&quot; (1995).

== Gameplay ==
The goal of the game was to kill an evil elemental creature called En-li-Kil. There were a number of &quot;rooms&quot;, where up to 30 (later 60) people could meet and adventure together in groups of up to four. Combat was turn-based.

The available professions were Barbarian, Knight, Ranger, Thief, Cleric, and Wizard. Player races included Human, Orc, Elf, Troll, Dwarf, Gnome, Halfling, and Gremlin.

Another popular pastime was player vs. player sparring. Many players were members of guilds.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1993 called the online version&#x27;s static artwork &quot;lovely&quot; and approved of the questing and, especially, the social nature of the game. The magazine concluded that &quot;those who possess the money would be well served to try out TSN and &quot;Yserbius&quot;&quot;. In June 1994 &quot;Shadow of Yserbius: Fates of Twinion&quot; was a finalist for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s &quot;Online Game of the Year&quot; award, losing to &quot;Multiplayer BattleTech&quot;.

James V. Trunzo reviewed &quot;The Shadow of Yserbius&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #41 (March, 1994), giving it a final evaluation of &quot;Below Average&quot; for solo play but &quot;Excellent&quot; for online play and stated that &quot;once you take away interaction with live friends and foes, &quot;Yserbius&quot; is just another hack-and-slay adventure game, lacking most of the features considered standard in other games of its ilk.&quot;

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1994 stated that the boxed set of offline versions of &quot;Yserbius&quot; and &quot;Twinion&quot; was &quot;a hollow shell of its vibrant on-line self ... Playing &quot;Yserbius&quot; without fellow on-line gamers is like being in an amusement park after hours, on in which the rides aren&#x27;t all that fun to begin with&quot;. While acknowledging that &quot;there is something to be said for&quot; its &quot;refreshingly simple&quot; gameplay, and the usefulness of an offline way to learn and level up characters for the online version, the magazine concluded that most fantasy RPG players would be disappointed when &quot;Betrayal at Krondor&quot;, &quot;Lands of Lore&quot;, and other alternatives were available.

== Remake==
&quot;MedievaLands&quot; is a complete remake of &quot;The Shadow of Yserbius&quot; and its sequel, &quot;The Fates of Twinion&quot;. In addition to support for modern Windows and macOS platforms, &quot;MedievaLands&quot; adds quality of life and gameplay functionality inspired by successors of the original games.

<text>Winifred Evelyn Spooner (11 September 1900 – 13 January 1933) was an English aviator of the 1920s and 1930s, and the winner of the Harmon Trophy as the world&#x27;s outstanding female aviator of 1929. She died aged 32 from pneumonia.

== Early life and education ==
Winifred Spooner was born in Woolwich in Kent, the daughter of Major Walter B. Spooner and Annie Spooner. She attended Sherborne Girls in Dorset.

After she received pilot&#x27;s licence No. 8137 from the London Aeroplane Club in September 1927, she became a competitor in sports aviation. She was the 16th woman to receive a licence. She also received an Aviator&#x27;s Certificate in the United States, dated 21 August 1931 and signed by Orville Wright.

Winifred&#x27;s brothers, Tony and Frank, had leased farmland and stables near Folly Court in Wokingham, Berkshire, where they schooled and sold polo-ponies, hunters and steeplechasers. They called their enterprise The Polo Farm. During the First World War Frank had served as a cavalry officer in India, and from 1917 to 1918 had been the head of the equestrian school. Winifred&#x27;s other brother, Captain Hugh &quot;Tony&quot; Spooner, who served in the 19th King George&#x27;s Own Lancers, married to Glenda Spooner, was Superintendent of Flying Operations and Chief Pilot to the Misr-Airwork Company of Egypt. He was killed in a flying accident in a sandstorm in Egypt on 15 March 1935.

There was a field on the farm big enough upon which to land a light aircraft, so Winifred built a wooden hangar and moved her Moth from Stag Lane. During this period Winifred, Hugh and Frank lived at 4 South Drive in Wokingham. Winifred continued her air-taxi service, charging £4 an hour or one shilling a mile, covering Britain and France, and gave flying lessons. She also bought a car; Wokingham locals recall her being one of the first woman drivers in the area. Some time later she moved to Scott&#x27;s Farm near Bearwood, now part of Woosehill.

== Achievements ==
In July 1928 she took the 3rd place in the seventh King&#x27;s Cup Race and won the Siddeley Trophy as the first Aeroplane Club aviator to cross the line, flying DH.60 Cirrus I Moth.
In 1929 she finished fifth in the King&#x27;s Cup Race, and won the Harmon Trophy as the world&#x27;s outstanding female aviator. She also took 10th place in the International Tourist Plane Contests &quot;Challenge&quot;.

In 1930 she was a member of the British team at the International Tourist Plane Contest Challenge 1930 between 16 July and 8 August in Berlin, Germany, finishing the rally seventh overall in her De Havilland Gipsy Moth. She completed the whole contest in 4th position. In late August of the same year she was fourth in the handicapped race &quot;Giro Aereo d&#x27;Italia&quot; in Italy.

On 5 December 1930, accompanied by Captain Edwards, she set out to prove that South Africa could be reached within 5 days by flying day and night. After 16 hours, while Captain Edwards was flying the aircraft and Winifred was asleep, the plane crashed into the sea off the coast of Belmonte Calabro in complete darkness. The plane losing height was attributed to a mechanical failure. As Captain Edwards was quite badly injured, Winifred left him sitting on the wooden fuselage and swam ashore &quot;6 strokes at a time&quot;; the ditching was about two miles offshore. She then alerted local fishermen who set out to rescue Captain Edwards and the plane.

She participated in three out of four F.A.I – International Tourist Plane Contests – Challenge 1929, Challenge 1930, Challenge 1932 – as one of only two women; being one of the top contestants and taking 10th place in 1929 and 4th place in 1930. In 1932 she occupied the 4th position after technical trials, but she decided to withdraw after a forced landing, caused by a sabotage on her fuel.

In 1931, she took the fifth place in the King&#x27;s Cup Race and became the first British woman to earn her living as a private owner&#x27;s personal pilot, flying the air racer and MP, Sir William Lindsay Everard, all over Britain, Europe, Turkey and the Middle East.

She is reported to have crashed an aircraft in Cleator Moor in Cumberland, England. The date is unknown but the plane was taken to the Mill Yard, and Spooner is reported to have suffered no more than tattered stockings.

== Death ==
In January 1933, Spooner, who was never ill, caught a cold while at Ratcliffe Aerodrome, Leicestershire, which rapidly worsened and she took to her bed. Pneumonia set in on the following day and the local doctor sent for a specialist from Nottingham. Unfortunately, because of thick fog, the specialist lost his way and the oxygen he was bringing, which might have saved her life, arrived too late: Spooner suffered a heart attack, and, despite an injection of strychnine, died the next day, on 13 January. The bad luck that had dogged Spooner all her life, and which had cost her numerous trophies and earned her the nickname &#x27;bad luck Wimpey&#x27;, had followed her to the end.

Her remains were taken to St. Swithin&#x27;s Church at Hinton Parva, near Swindon in Wiltshire for burial beside her parents. The Rev. W. Lucas Stubbs, the Rev. C.F. Burgess and the Rev. Gordon Soames conducted the service, and in addition to members of her family, those present included: Captain Tregona representing the Italian Government; the Italian Air Minister, General Italo Balbo; Commander H.E. Perrin, Secretary of the Royal Aero Club; and her former employer, Lindsay Everard. A memorial service was held four days later at St. Peter&#x27;s in Eaton Square, London. Many attended, including Viscountess Elibank; Lt.-Col. F.C. Shelmerdine, Director of Civil Aviation; Lady Acton and Kathleen Countess of Drogheda representing the Women&#x27;s Committee, Air League.

== Commemoration ==
A bronze bust of Spooner, created by Donald Gilbert, was unveiled on 30 May 1934 by Lindsay Everard MP at the headquarters of the Women&#x27;s Automobile and Sports Association, presented by an anonymous donor.

== Sherborne Memorial Scholarship ==
In 1936, Spooner&#x27;s close friend, Dugald Macpherson, founded a memorial scholarship to her memory at Sherborne School for Girls.

<text>Liscard is an area of the town of Wallasey, in the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, Merseyside, England. The most centrally located of Wallasey&#x27;s townships, it is the main shopping area of the town, with many shops located in the Cherry Tree Shopping Centre. At the 2001 census the population of Liscard local government ward was recorded at 15,510, increasing to 15,574 at the 2011 census.

==History==
The first mention of the settlement was circa 1260 as &quot;Lisnekarke&quot;. The name is from Welsh &quot;Llys carreg&quot;, with the name meaning &quot;hall at the rock&quot; or &quot;...cliff&quot;. 
In the past the name has been spelt as &quot;Liscak&quot; (1260), &quot;Lisecair&quot; (c.1277), &quot;Lysenker&quot; (1295) and &quot;Lyscart&quot; (1417).

Liscard was formerly a township and chapelry in the parish of Wallasey, in the Wirral Hundred, in 1866 Liscard became a separate civil parish, on 1 April 1912 the parish was abolished and merged with Wallasey and became part of the County Borough of Wallasey. The population was recorded as 211 in 1801, 4,100 in 1851, 28,661 in 1901 and 38,659 in 1911.
Liscard Hall was built in 1835 by a Liverpool merchant, Sir John Tobin. Its grounds later became Central Park. A &quot;model farm&quot; was also developed nearby by the Tobin family. The former Grade II listed mansion later became an art college within Central Park. It was damaged by a suspicious fire on 7 July 2008 after being left empty and inadequately secured by Wirral Council and was subsequently demolished.
The site has since been grassed over.
Liscard Battery was built in 1858 to help protect shipping on the River Mersey and defend the port of Liverpool. It was equipped with seven 10-inch guns. Set back from the river and hidden by new building, it was known as &quot;the snake in the grass&quot; to local inhabitants. The battery was obsolete by 1912, and sold on and houses were erected on top, and now the site has an odd appearance with only the curtain wall and ornate crenellated gatehouse surviving.
This gateway was designated a Grade II listed building in 1988.

Liscard and Poulton railway station on the Wirral Railway opened to passengers in 1895. Consisting of a single island platform in a cutting, it was part of a branch line with Seacombe railway station as its terminus. This branch closed to passengers in 1960 and to freight in 1963. Its route now forms the approach road to the Kingsway Tunnel.

==Geography==
Liscard is in the north-eastern part of the Wirral Peninsula, less than south-south-east of the Irish Sea at New Brighton, about east-north-east of the Dee Estuary at West Kirby and about west-north-west of the River Mersey at Egremont. Liscard is situated at an elevation of around above sea level.

Liscard is situated from Birkenhead, and from Liverpool via the Kingsway Tunnel.

==Governance==

Liscard is part of the Wallasey parliamentary constituency and represented since 1992 by Angela Eagle, a Labour Party MP, who retained her seat in the 2015 general election.

The area is also a local government ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, taking in the majority of Egremont. As of , Liscard is represented by two Labour Party councillors. The most recent local elections took place on 6 May 2021.

==Community==
The area is largely residential and contains mainly high-density semi-detached and terraced housing. 
Central Park is now the largest park in Wallasey, It has two areas for young children, with swings, slides and other games, large areas of greenery and a popular walled garden. There is also a cricket ground and a large duck pond. It links Liscard to Poulton and Egremont.

===Education===
Liscard includes the Oldershaw Academy, a secondary school with specialist status as a Business and Enterprise College and Liscard Primary School.

<text>Maudine Ormsby was a Holstein cow that was at the center of one of the most notorious pranks in U.S. college history. In the fall of 1926, Miss Ormsby was named Homecoming Queen at the Ohio State University. Rosalind Morrison won the Homecoming Queen election, but because only 10,000 students were enrolled and 12,000 votes had been cast, it was clear the election had irregularities. Rosie, as she was known, was named Queen, but being an honorable woman, withdrew when the fraud became apparent. Runner-up Maudine Ormsby, a mystery candidate nominated by the College of Agriculture but not enrolled as a student, became Homecoming Queen.

Maudine Ormsby was crowned Queen and viewed her subjects as part of the homecoming parade. According to OSU, however, she did not attend the dance held in her honor. Rosalind Morrison Strapp, would joke the rest of her life that her epitaph should read, &quot;But for Maudine, here lies the queen.&quot;

<text>Captain Frederic John Walker, (3 June 1896 – 9 July 1944) (his first name is given as Frederick in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; and some &quot;London Gazette&quot; entries) was a British Royal Navy officer noted for his exploits during the Second World War. Walker was the most successful anti-submarine warfare commander during the Battle of the Atlantic, and was known popularly as Johnnie Walker (after the Johnnie Walker brand of whisky).

==Early life and career==
Walker was born in Plymouth, the son of Frederic Murray and Lucy Selina (née Scriven) Walker. He joined the Royal Navy as a cadet in 1909 and was educated at the Royal Naval Colleges at Osborne and Dartmouth, where he excelled. First serving on the battleship as a midshipman, Walker as a sub-lieutenant went on to join the destroyers and in 1916 and 1917 respectively. Following the end of the First World War, Walker joined the . He married Jessica Eileen Ryder Stobart, with whom he had three sons and a daughter.

==Interwar period, 1920s–1930s==
During the interwar period Walker entered the field of anti-submarine warfare. He took a course at the newly founded anti-submarine warfare training school of HMS &quot;Osprey&quot;, on the Isle of Portland, which was established in 1924. Walker consequently became an expert in this particular type of warfare, and was appointed to a post specialising in this field, serving in a number of capital ships. In May 1933 he was promoted to commander and took charge of the First World War destroyer . In December 1933 Walker took command of the based on the China Station. In April 1937 Walker became the Experimental Commander at HMS &quot;Osprey&quot;.

==Second World War==
In 1940, he was appointed as Operations Staff Officer to Vice-Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay. Even so, Walker still had not been given a command, despite his expertise in antisubmarine warfare that would no doubt be indispensable in the Battle of the Atlantic. During Walker&#x27;s time in that role, the Operation Dynamo evacuation took place from Dunkirk, in which the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was evacuated from France. The evacuation was a success, with over 338,000 British and French troops being rescued and brought back to England, or to Brittany. He was Mentioned in Despatches for his work during this operation.

===36th Escort group===
Walker received his own command in October 1941, taking control of the 36th Escort Group, commanding from the . The escort group which consisted of two sloops ( and ) and six corvettes was based in Gladstone Dock, Bootle near the home of the Western Approaches Command. Initially his Group was primarily used to escort convoys to and from Gibraltar.

Walker&#x27;s first chance to test his innovative methods against the U-boat menace came in December 1941, when his group escorted Convoy HG 76 (32 ships). During the journey five U-boats were sunk, four by Walker&#x27;s group, including which was depth-charged and rammed by Walker&#x27;s own ship on 19 December 1941. The Royal Navy&#x27;s loss during the Battle for HG 76 was one escort carrier, , formerly the German vessel &quot;Hannover&quot;; one destroyer, , and two merchant ships. This is sometimes described as the first true Allied convoy victory in the Battle of the Atlantic. He was given the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) on 6 January 1942, &quot;For daring, skill and determination while escorting to this country a valuable Convoy in the face of relentless attacks from the Enemy, during which three of their Submarines were sunk and two aircraft destroyed by our forces&quot;. Walker&#x27;s group succeeded in sinking at least three more U-boats during his tenure as commander of the 36th Escort Group. In June 1942, Walker was promoted to captain dating from 30 June 1942 and he was awarded the first Bar to his DSO in July 1942.

===2nd Support group===

In October 1942, Walker left the 36th Escort Group and became Captain (D) Liverpool, granting him some time to recuperate. He finally returned to a ship command when he became commander of the 2nd Support Group in 1943, consisting of six sloops, which was based at Gladstone Dock, Bootle. Walker led from , a newly commissioned . The group was intended to act as a reinforcement to convoys under attack, with the capacity to actively hunt and destroy U-boats, rather than be restricted to escorting convoys. Walker had suggested the innovative idea to the Commander-in-Chief Western Approaches Command, Sir Max Horton. The combination of an active hunting group and a determined, and innovative anti-submarine specialist such as Walker proved to be a potent force. One eccentric aspect of his charismatic nature was the playing of the tune &quot;A Hunting We Will Go&quot; over the ship&#x27;s Tannoy when returning to its base.

In June 1943, Walker&#x27;s own ship &quot;Starling&quot; was responsible for the sinking of two U-boats. The first, , was destroyed on 2 June 1943 by depth charges and gunfire, and the second, , on 24 June 1943 by depth charges and ramming. Another U-boat, , was sunk by his group on the same day. On 30 July 1943, Walker&#x27;s group encountered a group of three U-boats on the surface (two were type XIV replenishment boats known as &quot;Milk Cows&quot;) while in the Bay of Biscay. He signalled the &quot;General Chase&quot; to his group and fired at the submarines, causing damage that prevented them from diving. Two of them, , a Type XIV, and , a Type IX/C40, were then sunk by Walker&#x27;s group, and the second Type XIV, , by an Australian Short Sunderland flying boat.
Upon his return to Gladstone Dock, Walker was informed that his son, Timothy Walker, had been killed when the submarine was lost in early August 1943 in the Mediterranean Sea. On 14 September 1943, Walker was appointed as a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) &quot;for leadership and daring in command of H.M.S. &quot;Starling&quot; in successful actions against Enemy submarines in the Atlantic.&quot;

On 6 November 1943, Walker&#x27;s group sank and . In early 1944 Walker&#x27;s group displayed its efficiency against U-boats by sinking six in one patrol. On 31 January 1944, Walker&#x27;s group gained its first kill of the year when it sank . On 9 February his group sank , , and in one action, then sank on 11 February, and on 19 February. On 20 February 1944, one ship of Walker&#x27;s group, , was torpedoed and sank seven days later while being towed home. All of her crew were saved. They returned to their base at Gladstone Dock to the thrilled jubilation of the local inhabitants and the Admiralty. The First Lord of the Admiralty was present to greet Walker and his ships. Walker’s seniority as a captain was backdated from 30 June 1942 to 30 June 1940 and he was awarded a second bar to his DSO.

In March 1944, Walker&#x27;s group provided part of the 32-ship escort force for an Arctic convoy of 49 merchant ships, codenamed Convoy JW 58. The powerful escort also included two escort carriers and two flotillas of fleet destroyers, as well as the U.S. Navy light cruiser which was on its way to Russia as part of the Lend-Lease programme. The whole force was commanded by Rear-Admiral Frederick Dalrymple-Hamilton on the cruiser , who initially tried to direct Walker&#x27;s ships into a tight screen, but soon allowed him to independently command the two support groups from Western Command. Walker&#x27;s own ship &quot;Starling&quot; sank the on 29 March, the group&#x27;s first day with the convoy, and subsequently the ships under his command sank and before they arrived at Murmansk without the loss of a single ship. The groups returned with the 36-ship convoy RA 58, but despite intelligence of 16 U-boats in their path, no contacts were made due to adverse conditions affecting the ASDIC (sonar).

Walker&#x27;s last duty was protecting the fleet from U-boats during the Normandy landings, the immense Allied invasion of France. This he did successfully for two weeks; no U-boats managed to get past Walker and his vessels, and many U-boats were sunk or damaged in the process. During this concerted effort Walker&#x27;s dedication to his tasks was tremendous; he took no respite from his duties, which ultimately contributed to his death. 
In May, he was informed by the Commander-in-Chief, Western Approaches that he was to take a two-month rest starting August and subsequently take command of an aircraft carrier. Later that year, once accustomed to air procedures, he was to be promoted to flag rank and given command of a carrier task force to be taken to the Pacific. He was awarded the third bar to his DSO on 13 June 1944, and was again Mentioned in Despatches on 20 June 1944.

===Methods===
One highly successful tactic employed by Walker was the creeping attack, in which two ships would work together to keep contact with a U–boat while attacking. Another approach was the barrage attack, in which three or more sloops in line launched depth charges to saturate the area where the submarine might be. Walker was also adept at the &#x27;hold down&#x27;: after making contact with a U-boat, keeping it at a depth below depth charge detonation range until it was forced to surface and become susceptible to attack by running out of air or battery power.

===Successes===
Walker was the most successful anti-submarine commander of the Second World War, being credited with 20 U boats destroyed, from various ships.

==Death==
Walker suffered a cerebral thrombosis on 7 July 1944, and he died two days later at the Royal Naval Hospital at Seaforth, Merseyside, at the age of 48. His death was attributed to overwork and exhaustion.

His funeral service, attended by about 1,000 people, took place at Liverpool Cathedral with full naval honours. A naval procession followed, escorting the coffin through the streets of the city to the Pier Head, by the River Mersey, where it was embarked aboard the destroyer , for a burial at sea. As Walker&#x27;s Group had already steamed out for combat duty, most of the naval personnel who manned the funeral procession were from the Royal Canadian Navy.

A final honour was a posthumous Mention in Despatches on 1 August 1944.

==Legacy==

In 1998 a statue by Liverpool sculptor Tom Murphy of Walker in a typical pose was unveiled at the Pier Head in Liverpool by the Duke of Edinburgh. 

Memorabilia associated with Captain Walker including two paintings of Walker, naval ensigns, the General Chase signal flags and the ships&#x27;s bell from HMS &quot;Starling&quot;, which was given to the former Bootle County Borough Council on 21 October 1964 by Admiral Sir Nigel Henderson. Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth, can be viewed in Bootle Town Hall.

<doc id="1009646" wikidata="Q370625" url="?curid=1009646" title="New York and Harlem Railroad">
<text>The New York and Harlem Railroad (now the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Harlem Line) was one of the first railroads in the United States, and was the world&#x27;s first street railway. Designed by John Stephenson, it was opened in stages between 1832 and 1852 between Lower Manhattan Island to and beyond Harlem. Horses initially pulled railway carriages, followed by a conversion to steam engines, then on to battery-powered Julien electric traction cars. In 1907, the then leaseholders of the line, New York City Railway, a streetcar operator, went into receivership. Following a further receivership in 1932, the New York Railways Corporation converted the line to bus operation. The Murray Hill Tunnel now carries a lane of road traffic, but not the buses.

The line became part of the New York Central Railroad system with trackage rights granted to the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad into Manhattan. It is now part of the Metro-North Railroad system, and the only Manhattan trackage of that system. As of 2017, Metro-North operates commuter passenger service from Grand Central Terminal, via Southeast (change from electric to diesel power), to Wassaic. The trackless right-of-way from Wassaic to Chatham is being converted to the Harlem Valley Rail Trail.

== History ==
The New York and Harlem Railroad was first built from the original Grand Central Terminal on 23rd Street in New York City to suburban Harlem. Opposition to the charter was voiced by steamboat proprietors, whose service was successfully competed against by the new railroad; to avoid steamboat competition on the Hudson River, the tracks were laid on the east side of Manhattan Island, away from the Hudson. The railroad was extended an additional northward, reaching Chatham, New York in 1852. When the railroad was extended further, it provided a rail route for people and commerce northward to Albany, Boston, and towns in Vermont and Canada. The completion of the Harlem Valley Railroad also resulted in the availability of products transported by rail directly to New York City, rather than depending on river transport via Poughkeepsie.

In 1831, when the New York and Harlem Railroad received its charter, it was an early commuter railroad connecting Harlem with lower Manhattan (New York City). Early in the 1840s, the Harlem Valley Railroad was extended northward into Westchester County, and then was authorized by the New York State Legislature to be further extended northward in order to create a connection with Albany. On May 12, 1846, a new competitor received its charter to build a railroad alongside the Hudson River between New York City&#x27;s lower Manhattan west side and Albany, backed mostly by wealthy Poughkeepsie manufacturers and merchants. (It was completed to Albany on October 3, 1851, after a great amount of costly blasting, filling and tunneling the craggy eastern shore of the Hudson River.) The Harlem Valley&#x27;s directors started to worry that Boston would have a competitive advantage over New York City for the expanding &quot;western trade.&quot; An easier and less-costly inland route, also to be named &quot;Harlem Valley&quot;, was thus created.

===Construction===

The company was incorporated on April 25, 1831 as the New York and Harlem Railroad, to link New York City with suburban Harlem. Among the company&#x27;s founders was John Mason, a wealthy banker and president of Chemical Bank who was among the largest landowners in New York City. They decided to build their railroad on the eastern side of Manhattan Island, convinced that it would never be able to compete with steamboat traffic on the Hudson River.

The first section, along Bowery from Prince Street north to 14th Street, opened on November 26, 1832. After that, the following sections opened:
*June 10, 1833 – north along Fourth Avenue to 32nd Street
*May 9, 1834 – north along Fourth Avenue to Yorkville, including the Murray Hill Tunnel
*October 26, 1837 – north along Fourth Avenue to Harlem, including the Yorkville Tunnel
*May 4, 1839 – south along Bowery, Broome Street and Centre Street to City Hall at Centre Street and Park Row
*September 3, 1842 – north to Williamsbridge
*December 1, 1844 – north to White Plains
*June 1, 1847 – north to Croton Falls
*December 31, 1848 – north to Dover Plains
*January 19, 1852 – north to Chatham Four Corners with a connection to the Albany and West Stockbridge Railroad, and trackage rights northwest to Albany.
*November 26, 1852 – south along Park Row to Astor House at Park Row and Broadway
*A freight branch was built to Port Morris, following the 1853 purchase of the Spuyten Duyvil and Port Morris Railroad and abandoned late in the 20th century. Parts are still visible.

Between 1847 and 1856, a track was built in Grand Street between Centre Street and Bowery (along with one block on the Bowery) for northbound trains. Southbound trains continued to use the old route.

In 1864 or 1865, a branch was added for trains between downtown and the East 34th Street Ferry Landing, running along 32nd Street, Lexington Avenue and 34th Street. This was the start of separate horse car service, running between Astor House and the ferry.

Grand Central Depot opened just north of 42nd Street in October, 1871, and intercity passenger trains from the north were ended there. Freight trains continued to operate along the tracks south of Grand Central, as did streetcars (still turning off at 42nd Street).

===Operation and control===
As in other early railroads, the dominant propulsion in the railroad&#x27;s early years was horse power. In 1837, steam engines were introduced, but their use was limited to areas outside of the heavily settled parts of the city, which was then north of 23rd Street.

The New York City Common Council passed an ordinance on December 27, 1854, to take effect in 18 months, barring the NY&amp;H from using steam power south of 42nd Street, due to complaints by persons whose property abutted the right-of-way. Before that, the steam locomotives had run to 32nd Street. When the ordinance took effect, the NY&amp;H had not done anything. After much debate, including an injunction issued preventing the city from enforcing the ordinance, the courts struck down the injunction on July 30, 1858.

In 1864, the railroad was purchased by Cornelius Vanderbilt, who consolidated it five years later with the Hudson River Railroad to form the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad: a precursor of the much larger New York Central Railroad.

On July 2, 1870, horsecars started to run not only to the 34th Street Ferry but to 73rd Street via Madison Avenue. These trains ran through the Murray Hill Tunnel and turned west on 42nd before going north on Madison (northbound cars used Vanderbilt Avenue to 44th Street). The line was soon extended to 86th Street and then to Harlem.

On April 1, 1873, the NY&amp;H leased its freight lines to the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad, but the horsecar line south of Grand Central remained separate. This eventually became the New York Central Railroad and then part of Penn Central and Conrail. Metro-North Railroad took over the line in 1983.

The first electric streetcar open to passengers in New York City, a Julien electric traction car, was run on September 17, 1888 on the line to 86th Street. The line went back to using horses for a time, but switched to a &quot;below-grade third rail&quot; (commonly called a &quot;conduit&quot;) in 1897. On July 1, 1896, the Metropolitan Street Railway leased the streetcar lines.

The New York City Railway, which leased the Metropolitan, and hence also these lines, went into receivership on September 24, 1907. The receivers returned operation of the Fourth Avenue line back to the Metropolitan Street Railway on July 31, 1908. The lease was terminated on January 31, 1920, with operation returned to the NY&amp;H.

On October 10, 1932, it was leased again, this time to the New York Railways Corporation, with the right to convert the line to bus operation. The stockholders voted to do this on February 19, 1934.

An approximation of the route is now traveled by NYCT Bus&#x27;s M1 bus. The Murray Hill Tunnel now carries a lane of roadway, but not the buses.

<doc id="1009651" wikidata="Q11122599" url="?curid=1009651" title="Male bonding">
<text>In ethology and social science, male bonding or male friendship is the formation of close personal relationships, and patterns of friendship or cooperation between males. Male bonding is a form of homosociality, or social connection between individuals of the same gender. Male bonding can occur through various contexts and activities that build emotional closeness, trust, and . Male bonding is an important feature of men’s social functioning and can provide benefits including emotional support and intimacy, shared identity, and personal fulfillment contributing to men’s mental health and wellbeing.

Though male bonding and male friendships have been researched in contexts of anthropology, psychology, and sociology, overall male bonding remains understudied.

== Characteristics ==
Male bonding can take various forms and may be expressed differently across cultures and individual relationships. Common characteristics of male bonding include:

Shared Activities: Men often bond through participation in common activities such as sports, or hobbies. These activities provide an environment for cooperation, competition, and shared experiences, all of which can help strengthen social ties.

Emotional Support: Though men’s friendships are often stereotyped as surface level and consisting of less intimacy, more recent studies have found that men today both value and engage in intimacy in their friendships more than men in previous generations.

Rituals and Traditions: Many male groups engage in social rituals that help cement their relationships. These can range from informal traditions like watching sports together to more formal rites of passage such as fraternity initiations. Such traditions have also been criticized as promoting hegemonic masculinity.

== Male bonding across the lifespan ==

=== Early childhood (Ages 2-6) ===
In early childhood, male bonding begins primarily within the family structure. For young boys, bonding often centers around interactions with fathers, or other male relatives. These early connections help children develop trust and emotional security.

There is research evidence from studies of children in school settings that preschool aged children are more likely to select same-sex playmates, rather than playmates of the other sex, when able to self-select playmates. There is also evidence that very young boys and girls differ in emotional expressiveness in dyadic friendships. Young boys often begin to seek out and enjoy time with other boys around this age, especially as they begin to recognize gender as a part of their identity.

=== School-age children (Ages 6-12) ===
As children enter school, their social world expands beyond the family, and peer relationships become increasingly important. Male bonding in this phase is shaped by shared interests, group activities, and a developing sense of identity. Boys begin to form more structured friendships, typically based on shared activities. These early friendships lay the groundwork for later emotional and social development. Research suggests that during this phase, children often begin to segregate into same-gender groups, with boys forming strong bonds with other boys.

=== Adolescence (Ages 12-22) ===
Adolescence is a period of significant social, emotional, and physical development, and peer relations become more complex and takes on new dimensions as young boys navigate the challenges of puberty and identity formation.

Friendship is important for adolescent mental health and in early adolescence male friendships tend to become more intimate with higher value placed on self-disclosure, reciprocity, loyalty, and commitment. Friendship networks at this age tend to include both same and other gender peers as interests in romantic relationships begins to emerge, though gender segregation remains prominent across dyadic friendships.

In adolescence, cultural pressure for boys to conform to masculine ideals tends to increase which has led many to theorize that boys have fewer intimate friendships in adolescence and adulthood. Some researchers have found that in early adolescence boys often have very loving and intimate relationships with same-gender best friends, but that this intimacy wanes over time with men becoming more disconnected from their friendships in later adolescence, despite stated desires for intimacy. In some studies, men in college report less instances of sharing personal information with male friends including thoughts, feelings, attitudes, and self-disclosures compared to what they shared with female friends. However, more recent literature suggests that college age men tend to be less limited by traditional views of masculinity and homosocial bonding than previous generations and are more intimate and emotionally expressive in their same gender friendships.

During adolescence, boys often bond through risk-taking behaviors such as experimenting with substances, engaging in rebellious acts, or pushing physical limits. This creates a shared sense of adventure and camaraderie but can also have negative consequences if the behaviors are dangerous.

=== Young adulthood (Ages 22-30) and middle adulthood (Ages 30-60) ===
Relatively little research has explored male bonding and male friendships in adulthood. Young adulthood is marked by increased independence and the establishment of long-term goals, such as career ambitions, romantic relationships, and starting families. Male bonding during this stage often revolves around shared life transitions, professional development, and personal challenges.

In adulthood, more emphasis begins to be placed on social roles and responsibilities such as increased focus on career, family, and personal development which can impact the amount of time men spend bonding with friends. However, strong male friendships remain vital, as they offer support in navigating the complexities of adulthood and help men maintain a sense of identity. Men’s friendship networks during this time often include work and professional contacts.

=== Older adulthood (Ages 60+) ===
Though much research shows friendship in old age is psychologically beneficial, as with other adult age groups, there is very little research on gender differences in friendships later in life. Factors that may impact male bonding in older adults include loss of friends, health issues, and social isolation. In addition to experiencing friendship loss due to death, as men retire, their friendships may deplete due to loss of contact with friends they previously engaged with regularly in work or networking settings.

== Male bonding and gender norms ==
For the past several decades, the social sciences have defined hegemonic masculinity by attributes such as strength, independence, and emotional restraint. These norms have often discouraged men from forming emotionally intimate relationships or expressing vulnerability and have resulted in homohysteria. Men within the LGBTQ+ community often face stigma and exclusion due to non-normative gender identities and sexual orientations. For these individuals, experiences of male bonding are influenced by experiences of marginalization, discrimination, and the complexities of navigating social identities. Gay, bisexual, and queer men may struggle to find acceptance within male spaces that emphasize homophobia or rigid masculinity, such as in sport.

More recent research has shown that younger men are more likely to include gay peers in friendship groups. A new theory of masculinity, called &quot;Inclusive masculinity theory&quot;, has emerged to capture a societal decline in homophobia in western cultures and a theorized more inclusive version of masculinity.

For transgender men, the experience of male bonding is shaped by their intersectional identities as both transgender individuals and men. As they navigate gender transition and male socialization, they may face challenges in forming male bonds. Transgender men may encounter exclusion from men in male-dominated spaces such as locker rooms or sports teams.

== Male bonding in contemporary Western media ==
Male bonding has been a common theme in Western media for many decades, often depicted in ways that reinforce traditional notions of masculinity and friendship. In recent years, popular shows like &quot;Dave&quot; (2020-) and &quot;Ted Lasso&quot; (2020-) have presented male friendships that are characterized by emotional support, vulnerability, and deeper connections beyond just shared activities.

=== &quot;Bromance&quot; ===
The term &quot;bromance&quot; has emerged in recent years to describe a close, non-romantic friendship between men that involves a heightened level of emotional intimacy and affection. The bromance has gained prominence in Western media, particularly in films and television. Unlike traditional representations of male friendships, which often emphasize masculine stereotypes, the bromance focuses on the positive emotional aspects of male bonding.

Though initially thought of as media trope, the bromance has become a more positive and inclusive representation of male relationships that allows men to express care for each other, both verbally and physically, in ways that defy traditional masculine norms, such as hugging, openly expressing affection, or discussing emotions.

=== &quot;Locker Room Talk&quot; ===
Locker room talk refers to the informal, often crude conversations that men engage in, typically in private settings such as locker rooms, bars, or among male peers. This style of conversation is often characterized by humor, bravado, and an emphasis on male sexuality, dominance, and sometimes, objectification of women. Locker room talk has become a cultural trope associated with toxic masculinity that reflects broader societal critiques of masculinity and male bonding.

These conversations have gained more scrutiny and attention in both popular culture and the media in recent years following the 2016 U.S. presidential election, when a recording of Donald Trump casually bragging about sexually assaulting women to a television personality was leaked to the public. Following the tape being leaked, Trump attempted to dismiss public concern by stating the remarks were “locker room talk.” The incident sparked widespread discussions about the impact of such talk on societal attitudes toward women and the role it plays in reinforcing a culture of toxic masculinity.

=== Recession in male friendship ===
The &quot;male friendship crisis&quot; refers to a growing concern that men, particularly in Western societies, are increasingly isolated from close, emotionally intimate friendships. The American male friendship recession has been reported on by news outlets including the New York Times, PBS News, Psychology Today, and Vox.

Surveys have shown that men are experiencing a decline in the number of meaningful friendships they maintain, with the number of men reporting having at least 6 close friends halving in 2021 compared to 1990. Many men have reported feeling lonely or disconnected from others. This phenomenon is often attributed to cultural norms that encourage men to hide vulnerability and is thought to have been accelerated by societal shifts in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic such as social isolating during the pandemic and resulting increases in remote work arrangements.

<text>War Eagle is a battle cry, yell, or motto of Auburn University and supporters of Auburn University sports teams. War Eagle is a greeting or salutation among the Auburn Family (e.g., students, alumni, fans). It is also the title of the university&#x27;s fight song and the name of the university&#x27;s golden eagle.

The widespread use of &quot;War Eagle&quot; by Auburn devotees has often led to outside confusion as to Auburn&#x27;s official mascot. However, the official mascot of Auburn University is Aubie the Tiger, and all Auburn athletic teams, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s, are nicknamed the Tigers. Auburn has never referred to any of its athletic teams as the &quot;Eagles&quot; or &quot;War Eagles.&quot; The university&#x27;s official response to the confusion between the Tigers mascot and the War Eagle battle cry is, &quot;We are the Tigers who say &#x27;War Eagle.&#x27;&quot;
Since 1930, and continuously since 1960, Auburn has kept a live golden eagle on campus. Since 2001 Auburn has presented an untethered eagle to fly over Jordan-Hare stadium prior to the start of football games. War Eagle VIII, a golden eagle named Aurea, along with Spirit, a bald eagle, perform the War Eagle Flight before all Auburn home games at Jordan–Hare Stadium.

== History of the &quot;War Eagle&quot; phrase ==

As early as 1916, the Columbus, Georgia Daily Enquirer mentioned &quot;War Eagle&quot; as an Auburn battle cry. In the 1846 edition of Francis Parkman&#x27;s study of the Plains Indians &quot;The Oregon Trail,&quot; the term &quot;War Eagle&quot; is used to describe the feathers in the headdress of various Dakota tribe members. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, &quot;War Eagle&quot; appeared from time to time in the United States as an evocative nickname for people and things such as Native Americans (including professional wrestlers); race horses; a U.S. civil war mascot; and, in one case, a coal mine interest.

There are several stories about the origin of the battle cry. One of these is a mythical story published in 1959 in the Auburn Plainsman, conceived by its then editorial page editor, Jim Phillips. This myth is detailed below under &quot;War Eagle I&quot;. Another mythical story is told about an Auburn student who returns to the University after the war with an eagle who was wounded on the battlefield with him but he nursed back to health. The eagle soared above the field in 1892 as Auburn scored the winning touchdown as the crowd chanted &quot;War Eagle!&quot; Just then, the eagle fell to the ground dead from age but was to live on as the Auburn football battle cry for generations to come.

A 1914 football game against the Carlisle Indians provides another myth. According to this story, there was a lineman/tackle named Bald Eagle on the Indians&#x27; team. Attempting to exhaust that player, Auburn&#x27;s team began running multiple plays directly at his position. Without even huddling, the Auburn quarterback Lucy Hairston would yell &quot;Bald Eagle,&quot; letting the rest of the team know that the play would be run at the tackle. Spectators, however, thought the quarterback was saying &quot;War Eagle,&quot; and began to chant that. 
Another legend claims that &quot;War Eagle&quot; was the name given to the large golden eagle by the Plains Indians because the eagle furnished feathers for use in their war bonnets.

According to a 1998 article in the Auburn Plainsman, the most likely origin of the &quot;War Eagle&quot; cry grew from a 1913 pep rally at Langdon Hall, where students had gathered the day before the annual football game against the University of Georgia. Cheerleader Gus Graydon told the crowd, &quot;If we are going to win this game, we&#x27;ll have to get out there and fight, because this means war.&quot; During the frenzy, another student, E. T. Enslen, dressed in his military uniform, noticed something had dropped from his hat. Bending down, he saw it was the metal emblem of an eagle that had come loose during his wild cheering. Someone asked him what he had found, and Enslen loudly replied, &quot;It&#x27;s a War Eagle!&quot; The new cry was used by students at the game the following day.

== War Eagle birds ==

Auburn has had eight numbered &quot;War Eagle&quot; birds, but the first of these only appeared in a legend about the history of the phrase &quot;War Eagle&quot;.

=== War Eagle I (1892) ===

The mythical War Eagle I has the most colorful story of all of the &quot;War Eagle&quot; eagles. War Eagle I&#x27;s story begins in the Civil War. According to the legend, a soldier from Alabama during the Battle of the Wilderness came across a wounded young eagle. The bird was named Anvre, and was cared for and nursed back to health by the soldier. Several years later the soldier, a former Auburn student, returned to college as a faculty member, bringing the bird with him. For years both were a familiar sight on campus and at events. On the day of Auburn&#x27;s first football game in 1892 against the University of Georgia, the aged eagle broke away from his master during the game and began to circle the field, exciting the fans. But at the end of the game, with Auburn victorious, the eagle fell to the ground and died.
In 2010, a children&#x27;s book,&quot;The War Eagle Story&quot; by Francesca Adler-Baeder and illustrated by Tiffany Everett was published that favors this version of the story.

This legend was originally published in the March 27, 1959, edition of the &quot;Auburn Plainsman&quot; and was conceived by then editorial page editor Jim Phillips. Though apocryphal, this tale is most often told as the beginning of the association of &quot;War Eagle&quot; with Auburn. Phillips has pressed several recent presidents of Auburn to research the true origin of the battle cry &quot;before my fictitious story gets carved in stone.&quot;

=== War Eagle II (1930) ===

Auburn&#x27;s first real, live-eagle confirmed mascot, War Eagle II, was mentioned in the New York Times, which noted then that &quot;War Eagle&quot; was already established as Auburn&#x27;s battle cry. In November 1930 a golden eagle swooped down on a flock of turkeys in Bee Hive, Alabama, southwest of Auburn, Alabama, and became entangled in a mass of pea vines. Fourteen individuals and businesses scraped together $10 and purchased the eagle from the farmer who owned the pea patch. Cheerleaders DeWit Stier and Harry &quot;Happy&quot; Davis (who later became executive secretary of the Alumni Association) helped care for the new bird. It was put in a strong wire cage and taken to the Auburn football game against the University of South Carolina in Columbus, Georgia on Thanksgiving Day.

Auburn, having not won a Southern Conference game in four seasons, was anticipated to lose. However, Auburn took a 25–7 victory over the Gamecocks. The student body concluded that the luck from the eagle&#x27;s presence—which had been absent from their prior losses—was responsible for the victory that day. The eagle was kept in a cage behind Alumni Hall (renamed Ingram Hall), and cared for by members of the &quot;A&quot; Club.

The bird&#x27;s ultimate fate is unknown. Some say it died or was carried away by students of a rival school. Others say it was given to a zoo due to the high cost of upkeep; there is even a rumor that it was stuffed and put in the John Bell Lovelace Athletic Museum.

Originally known simply as &quot;War Eagle&quot; this bird was retroactively named &quot;War Eagle II&quot; with the arrival of War Eagle III.

=== War Eagle III (1960–1964) ===

Auburn&#x27;s third eagle arrived in Auburn in November 1960 after being captured by a cotton farmer in Curry Station, Talladega County, Alabama who found the bird caught between two rows of cotton. The eagle was sent to Auburn by the Talladega County Agent along with a load of turkeys. It was first taken to the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity house where it refused a cold chicken leg but made fast work of a live chicken. After a short stay in one of the Wildlife Department&#x27;s animal pens, the eagle was moved into a cage built by the Auburn&#x27;s Delta chapter of Alpha Phi Omega fraternity. This would begin a 40-year period where Alpha Phi Omega was the bird&#x27;s primary caretaker.

Jon Bowden, a fraternity brother who had previously worked with hawks in Colorado and Missouri, volunteered to serve as the bird&#x27;s trainer. Formally named War Eagle III, Jon nicknamed the bird &quot;Tiger.&quot; In April 1961, Jon and Tiger made their first appearance as trainer and mascot on the baseball diamond. Auburn was playing the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets and was trailing 10–13 in the eighth inning, but rallied in the ninth and scored 4 runs to win the game.

The students were receptive to the new mascot and expressed a concern for a larger cage to house War Eagle III. In 1964, on the morning of the football game against Tennessee, War Eagle III was seen by his trainer, A. Elwyn Hamer Jr., sitting on the ground next to his perch. He had sprung the clip on his leash and escaped. After several days of searching, the bird was found shot to death in a wooded area near Birmingham, Alabama, where the game was being played.

=== War Eagle IV (1964–1980) ===

The Birmingham Downtown Action Committee found another golden eagle in the Jackson, Mississippi zoo and presented it to the Auburn student body in October 1964. This became War Eagle IV, also called &quot;Tiger.&quot; She lived in a large aviary—until torn down in 2003 the second largest single-bird enclosure in the country—that had been funded and constructed by the Alpha Phi Omega fraternity and named for A. Elwyn Hamer Jr., War Eagle III&#x27;s first trainer who had been killed in a plane crash in December 1965.

Throughout the years, the fraternity provided care and training for the mascot. On the morning of the 1980 Iron Bowl against Alabama in Birmingham, she was found dead by her trainers (Tim Thomason, Charlie Jacks, Bob Ingram, Arnie Cobb, and her former trainer Bill Watts), having died of natural causes at age 22, after having served as Auburn&#x27;s mascot for 16 years. A marker in memory of War Eagle IV is located on the Auburn University campus near the former site of the aviary.

=== War Eagle V (1981–1986) ===

Through the efforts of War Eagle IV&#x27;s trainers and with the financial support of the Birmingham Downtown Action, an immature golden eagle was located soon after the death of War Eagle IV and brought to Auburn from Wyoming. The bird arrived in Auburn on March 3, 1981 and was taken to the Veterinary School where she was kept for a short period in order to be examined for any signs of shock from travel. She was then transferred to a small cage until the annual &quot;A Day&quot; football game when she was presented to the University by the Birmingham Downtown Action Committee on May 9, 1981.

The bird was under the stewardship of the U.S. Government under the provisions of the Endangered Species Act and was on loan to the Auburn University Veterinary School. She was officially named War Eagle V, and nicknamed &quot;Tiger&quot; as was tradition. She was approximately two years old at her arrival and was very active on campus. She attended many university functions, Alumni meetings, schools, hospitals, the 1985 Boy Scouts of America National Jamboree, and the 1986 National Order of the Arrow Conference.

On September 4, 1986, War Eagle V died of a ruptured spleen at the age of 8 and a half years old. War Eagle V was taken to Auburn&#x27;s veterinary school the night before by her trainer, Jim McAlarney, who noticed that she was not behaving normally. McAlarney spent the night at the veterinary school while veterinarians made a futile effort to save the bird&#x27;s life.

=== War Eagle VI (1986–2006) ===

The eagle trainers began working soon after the unexpected death of War Eagle V to find a new golden eagle. The Auburn University Alumni Association and many Auburn alumni contributed to the effort and a new eagle was located at the Tennessee Valley Authority Raptor Rehabilitation Facility in Land Between The Lakes, Kentucky. Trainers made the trip to the facility to receive Auburn&#x27;s new mascot. The bird originally came from St. Louis, Missouri, where she was seized by Federal agents as part of an illegal breeding operation and brought to Kentucky by wildlife biologist, Robert D. Smith, who managed the Bald Eagle and Osprey programs at Land Between the Lakes and just happened to have a son at Auburn. Like War Eagle V, she was under the stewardship of the U.S. Government under the provisions of the Endangered Species Act and was on loan to the Auburn University College of Veterinary Medicine. She arrived in Auburn on October 8, 1986 at an age of six years. Like the two eagles before her, she was cared for by the members of Alpha Phi Omega and nicknamed Tiger.

In 2000, day-to-day care of War Eagle VI was turned over to the Auburn University Raptor Center, ending the 40-year program of care by Alpha Phi Omega. Shortly thereafter, the bird was moved from the Hamer Aviary to the Auburn University Raptor center. The Hamer Aviary was torn down in the summer of 2003.

During the 2000 football season, War Eagle VI began a tradition of performing a free flight before a home football game. War Eagle VI, and later other eagles kept by in the Auburn University Raptor Center in Auburn, flew around the stadium before landing on the field as the crowd chanted &quot;War Eagle&quot;. On February 8, 2002, War Eagle VI flew in Rice-Eccles Stadium as part of the opening ceremonies of the 2002 Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City. War Eagle VI was featured the next day on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today Show&quot;.

In the summer of 2003, allegations of improper care of the birds by the Auburn University Raptor Rehabilitation Center were leveled by the university administration and by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Many of the birds were suffering from diseases and malnourishment. After all investigations were concluded, War Eagle VI was allowed to fly again prior to Auburn home games.

War Eagle VI&#x27;s presence continued to be used throughout her life as a wildlife educational tool.

On November 11, 2006, War Eagle VI was officially retired in a pregame ceremony before the Georgia game. During halftime of the same game, her successor, Nova, was named War Eagle VII. In her final game as War Eagle VI, Auburn defeated Arkansas State 27–0, finalizing the team&#x27;s record under War Eagle VI at 174-69-4. She saw two undefeated Auburn seasons, four SEC titles, and six SEC Western Division crowns.

Tiger continued to make non-flying appearances at Auburn University events and for wildlife education to various organizations until her death on June 18, 2014, at age 34 shortly following cataract surgery.

=== War Eagle VII (2006–2019) ===

Nova, Auburn&#x27;s fourteen-year-old golden eagle, was officially named War Eagle VII on November 11, 2006. He was hatched in the Montgomery Zoo in 1999 and moved to Auburn at six months of age. Prior to being named War Eagle VII, Nova had already participated in pre-game flights and conservation exhibits throughout the southeast.

He is a National Champion as of 2010.

As of 2017- Nova was suspended from flight activities due to a diagnosis of chronic heart disease. Auburn University would instead use Spirit, a bald eagle, in place of Nova for the 2017-18 Football Season

War Eagle was named the #4 mascot in a poll by Foxsports.

=== War Eagle VIII (2019–present) ===

Upon receiving War Eagle VII&#x27;s diagnosis in 2017, a three-year-old golden eagle named Aurea was tabbed as his eventual successor. She made her stadium debut in 2018 and was officially named War Eagle VIII in a Board of Directors meeting on November 22, 2019,

==&quot;War Eagle&quot; as Auburn&#x27;s fight song==
&quot;War Eagle&quot; is the university&#x27;s official fight song. It is played before and after games, as well as immediately after Auburn scores by the Auburn University Marching Band. (Auburn plays &quot;Glory, Glory, to Ole Auburn&quot; after an extra point.) In addition, the Samford Carillon, located in the clock tower of Samford Hall, rings the fight song every day at noon.

&quot;War Eagle&quot; was written in 1954 and 1955 by New York songwriters Robert Allen and Al Stillman. The &quot;Auburn Victory March&quot; had been the fight song for decades. The Jordan Vocational High School Band of Columbus, Georgia, under the direction of Bob Barr first performed the song during Auburn&#x27;s 1955 season-opener versus Chattanooga.

Auburn University currently does not hold ownership of the copyright for &quot;War Eagle&quot;. The Auburn Alumni Association did not renew it and the copyright is currently held by the estate of Robert Allen, one of the songwriters who composed it. Therefore, companies selling products with &quot;War Eagle&quot; being played must acquire licensing from the estate as well as Auburn University. There is a movement within the university to regain the ownership of the song.

<doc id="1009683" wikidata="Q5416235" url="?curid=1009683" title="Eveleigh">
<text>Eveleigh is an inner southern suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Eveleigh is located about 3 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district and is part of the local government area of the City of Sydney.

== History ==
Eveleigh was named after the estate of Lieutenant J. R. Holden, so called after his birthplace in England. Much of the suburb of Redfern was known as Eveleigh in the early days. In fact, Redfern railway station was originally known as Eveleigh railway station. The Eveleigh railway yards were located immediately south-west of the station.

Following the nationalisation of failed private railways, construction began in the early 1880s on a new workshops complex, occupying an area of over , bounded by North Newtown, Darlington, Erskineville, Redfern, Alexandria and Chippendale. Originally the workshops serviced and repaired the growing NSW rail fleet, but in 1908 Eveleigh began manufacturing steam locomotives. By this time more than 3000 people were employed at the site. Many workers lived in the area, but many lived in other suburbs and until the 1980s commuting workers alighted at the purpose-built Macdonaldtown Station, located in the middle of the complex.

Included in the complex was a running shed, opened in 1884, for steam locomotives used in the daily duties of train haulage. Originally of three bays, the first was demolished about 1925 and the remaining two in the early 1960s.

In 1989, part of the site was used to house Paddy&#x27;s Markets, while the original site at Haymarket was being redeveloped.
===Eveleigh Workshops===
The Eveleigh Railway Workshops are of great significance to Australia&#x27;s industrial, military and social history. Eveleigh manufactured the first steam locomotives made in Australia, and it contains the most complete set of late nineteenth and early twentieth century light and medium engineering technologies in Australia (much of which is now preserved in an industrial museum in Bays 1 and 2 of the old Locomotive Workshop).

The Eveleigh site was also used to manufacture munitions in both World War I and World War II.

Eveleigh is also significant in the history of Australian unionism. In 1892, unions successfully negotiated to establish a six-day working week, and the 1917 General Strike, which began with the 3,000 workers at Eveleigh, eventually spread across Australia, involving almost 100,000 nationwide.

The locomotive workshop was closed in 1988 and the main rail workshops were moved to Enfield. 3801 Limited occupied the Large Erecting Shop from 1986 to 2017.
===Public Housing Estates===
The Eveleigh area is largely social housing, and home to 4 housing estates in its proximity, most notably the estate of 1-2 story townhouses centred around South Sydney rotary park, developed in the Early 1990s along with 2 other estates nearby on Golden grove street and Newton street built around 5-10 years earlier.

Recently, a residential area in carriageworks was redeveloped, being replaced with a unit block of mostly social and community housing, the north Eveleigh precinct redevelopment was completed in 2018. Not long after, another much older run down housing block across Wilson street from carriageworks was completely demolished a year later and is currently being redeveloped

The South Eveleigh Housing Estate around Explorer street is currently under threat of demolition.

==Population==
At the 2021 census, the population had decreased to 606 residents, from 663 residents in 2016. 56.4% of people were born in Australia and 60.6% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 47.0% and Catholic 21.8%.

==Developments==

In 1991, the NSW Government established a consortium including the University of Sydney, University of Technology, Sydney and UNSW which transformed Alexandria side of the workshops site into the Australian Technology Park. Another section of the old workshops, which faces onto Wilson St, has recently been converted into a large theatre space.

Australian Technology Park occupies the site of the former Eveleigh railway yards. It is the home of a growing community of researchers, entrepreneurs, incubator businesses, start-ups, mature technology companies and education organisations.

The ATP buildings are also frequently used as locations for advertisements and television programs including &quot;MasterChef Australia&quot;. &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot; and the auditions of &quot;Australian Idol&quot;. The ATP site will also soon house extensive film and television production facilities including a new digital film making studio built by production company Kennedy Miller Mitchell for the filming of &quot;Mad Max 4&quot; and &quot;Happy Feet 2&quot;. The Seven Network and outside broadcast company NEP Group are housed within four purpose-built high definition television studios.

<text>The Strand Historic District, also known as the Strand District, in downtown Galveston, Texas (USA), is a National Historic Landmark District of mainly Victorian era buildings that now house restaurants, antique stores, and curio shops. The area is a major tourist attraction for the island city and also plays host to two very popular seasonal festivals. It is widely considered the island&#x27;s shopping and entertainment center. The district includes properties along the south side of Harborside Drive (Avenue A) and both sides of The Strand (Avenue B) and Mechanic Street (Avenue C) from 20th Street westward to 26th Street.

The street labeled &quot;The Strand&quot; is actually named Avenue B, which runs parallel to Galveston Bay.

The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970, and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976 for its unparalleled collection of commercial Victorian architecture in Texas, and its role as the state&#x27;s major port in the 19th century.

Today &quot;the Strand&quot; is generally used to refer to the entire five-block business district between 20th and 25th streets in downtown Galveston, very close to the city&#x27;s wharf.

==History==
The original plat of Galveston, drawn in the late 1830s, includes Avenue B. The name &#x27;strand&#x27; for Ave. B was coined by a German immigrant named Michael William Shaw who opened a jewelry store on the corner of 23rd and Ave. B. Shaw, not liking the name &quot;Ave. B&quot;, changed the name of the street on his stationery to &quot;Strand&quot;, thinking that the name (named after a street in London) would have higher-class connotations for his jewelry store. He later convinced other owners on the street to change the names they used for the street as well, and the name stuck. (The word &quot;strand&quot; comes from the Old English word for &quot;shore&quot; or &quot;river bank&quot;; in German, Swedish and Dutch, the word means &quot;beach&quot;.)

The Strand&#x27;s very earliest buildings were typically wooden and vulnerable to fires and storms that hit the island frequently throughout the 19th century. Eventually those structures were replaced with iron-fronted brick buildings. The two oldest buildings still standing on the Strand date to 1855 and 1858; other historic buildings date back typically to the 1870s and 1880s.

Throughout the 19th century, the port city of Galveston boomed; and the Strand, which is very close to the harbor, grew into the region&#x27;s main business center. For a time, it was known as the &quot;Wall Street of the South&quot;.

Because of the Port of Galveston&#x27;s enormous vessel traffic (between 700 and 1,400 vessels annually), the Strand became a popular place for major businesses to locate, including the state&#x27;s five largest banks at the time, wholesalers, commission merchants, cotton brokers, attorneys and slave auctioneers. In 1881, businesses in the Strand district sold about US$38 million worth of merchandise and services. Between 1838 and 1842, 18 newspapers were started; The Galveston News, founded in 1842, is the lone survivor.

Because of the Strand&#x27;s close proximity to Galveston&#x27;s harbor, the area suffered some damage during several battles during the Civil War, particularly when Union forces barricaded the city. During the Battle of Galveston, Confederate forces fought from every corner of the area; several buildings suffered damage from shots and shelling. The battles forced many businesses to close and move to nearby Houston until the war&#x27;s end. But most moved back into their regular quarters and enjoyed prosperity until the turn of the next century.

The Galveston hurricane of 1900 was devastating to much of the city, and the Strand district was no exception. Many of its buildings suffered catastrophic damage — some buildings lost entire floors, others lost elaborate cornices and flourishes. Many businesses elected to move away from the wharf and, by extension, away from the Strand. The area became a warehouse district, and was not revived until the 1960s when the Junior League of Galveston County restored two buildings.

That restoration effort sparked a revitalization project that is still ongoing. In 1973 the Galveston Historical Foundation followed suit, creating a trust fund for dramatic restorations of the Strand district that has sparked significant private investment as well.

==Present day==

Today, the Strand features shops, historical exhibits, museums, art galleries and many restaurants and night clubs. It is also the location of a very popular annual Mardi Gras celebration, as well as a Christmas festival known as Dickens on the Strand, which celebrates the city&#x27;s Victorian heritage with participants roaming the Strand in period dress.

Attractions within the area include The Galveston County Museum, the Galveston Railroad Museum, Victorian architecture, horse and carriage rides, historical markers, an old fashioned trolley for transportation, and a giant chess set in Saengerfest Park, a small square park located on the corner of Tremont St (23rd St) and Strand St (Avenue B). It was created in the early 1990s by George and Cynthia Mitchell.

The historic district also contains a variety of retailers, including clothing, factory outlets, souvenir shops, art galleries, antique galleries.

On the outer edges of the Strand is the Post Office district, known for its antique galleries, art galleries, the Old Quarter Acoustic Cafe, and the Grand 1894 Opera House. Closer to the water is Pier 21, which has daily showings of the movies &quot;The Great Storm of 1900&quot; and &quot;The Pirate Island of Jean Lafitte&quot;, the Ocean Star Offshore Drilling Rig &amp; Museum, and the Texas Seaport Museum with tall ship Elissa.

The Strand sustained significant and catastrophic damage from the storm surge of Hurricane Ike on September 13, 2008, prompting the National Trust for Historic Preservation to add the district to the 2009 list of America&#x27;s Most Endangered Places.

<doc id="1009696" wikidata="Q2919710" url="?curid=1009696" title="Darlington, New South Wales">
<text>Darlington is a small, inner-city suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Darlington is located about three kilometres south of the Sydney central business district and is part of the local government area of the City of Sydney. At the time of its incorporation in 1864, it had the distinction of being the smallest municipality in the Sydney metropolitan area, at a mere 44 acres. Darlington is bordered by City Road, Cleveland Street, Golden Grove Street, Wilson Street and Abercrombie Street.

==History==
===First Nations history of Darlington===
The first Aboriginal inhabitants of Darlington were the Cadigal people of the Eora belonging to the wider Dharug language group. The Cadigal were a coastal people who subsisted on fishing, hunting land animals and gathering shellfish and plants. Darlington was part of their southern range bordered by the Kameygal clan to the south at Botany Bay and the Wangal clan to the west.

===British penal settlement and European colonisation===
The earliest recorded British history of Darlington is linked to school purposes when in 1789, Governor Arthur Phillip received instructions from England to set aside land in the new penal colony for church and school use. In 1819, fifty two acres of land was given to William Hutchinson by Governor Lachlan Macquarie. In 1835, a 28 acres land grant was made to William Shepherd by Governor Richard Bourke. It had been promised earlier in 1827 by Governor Ralph Darling and in his honour, Shepherd named the fruit and flower farm he established &#x27;Shepherd&#x27;s Darling Nursery&#x27;. His nursery is still remembered today in many Darlington street names such as Ivy, Pine, Myrtle, Rose, Vine and Shepherd Streets. By 1844, the Hutchinson estate, much of Shepherd&#x27;s Nursery and a portion of the adjoining 96 acre land grant to William Chippendale comprised much of present-day Darlington.

===Subdivision and industrialisation===
By the late 1850s, the University of Sydney to the north of Darlington, at the site of the former Grose Farm was established. The incorporation of Darlington was proclaimed on 16 September 1864 and the first council was elected. The origin of the suburb&#x27;s name is arguable, possibly being derived from Governor Ralph Darling and the Darling Nursery, or from William Vane, 3rd Earl of Darlington, a well known British politician during the early years of the New South Wales Colony. Rapid subdivision of Darlington continued in the 1880s but by 1891, Darlington was regarded as a slum and was the most densely populated suburb of Sydney. By the late 1890s, the Eveleigh Railway Workshops had been built and were employing many local workers. Other industries operating in Darlington at this time included the Henry Jones and Co. jam factory, iron foundry, a zinc and brass works, two cabinet factories, a cordial factory, a boot factory, a portmanteau factory and other small industries.

===Sydney University expansion===
In the late 1950s, the Government of New South Wales re-zoned some 70 acres of the Darlington area as a ‘special uses’ area, for government institutions such as The Department of Housing and the University of Sydney to extend its campus across City Road into Darlington. This resulted, despite increasing community opposition and resentment, in the demolition of about 650 houses as well as shops, factories, banks, the post office, the Town Hall and other amenities, and the population of Darlington decreased by about 2,000.

Factories and light industries have mostly closed, and the suburb has experienced residential consolidation and urban renewal since the 1990s.

==Population==
===Demographics===

At the 2021 census the population of Darlington had dropped to 2,597.

According to the , there were 3,097 residents in Darlington. The median age was 25 years old compared to the Australian median of 38 years old. In Darlington, 44.8% of people were born in Australia. The most common other countries of birth were China 20.2%, England 3.0% and New Zealand 2.2%. 55.2% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin at 19.6%. 60.9% of Darlington respondents reported &#x27;no religion&#x27; compared to the total for Australia at 29.6%. The next most common responses were Catholic 9.9%, Buddhism 4.3% and Anglican 3.2%. 81.5% of residents had never married compared to the Australian figure of 35.0%.

==Commercial area==
Abercrombie St at Lawson Street has become the commercial focus of Darlington since the university expansion in the 1960s. This street has a number of cafes, restaurants, small grocery and other businesses. Commercial businesses also operate within the Sydney University Darlington campus. Broadway Shopping Centre, King Street, Newtown and Redfern Street shopping areas are also nearby.

==Parks and open spaces==

Sydney University&#x27;s Cadigal Green is the largest park in Darlington and contains the old Darlington School, seating and a wetland. Charles Kernan Reserve on Abercrombie St is named after a former local resident and has playground facilities, public BBQs and a community garden. Other parks include the Vine Sreett playground and a pocket park located on the corner of Boundary and Shepherd Streets. Other large parks within walking distance include Victoria Park, Prince Alfred Park and Redfern Park.

==Architecture==
===Housing===
The opening of the Eveleigh Railway Workshops in the 1880s was the major stimulus for the building of Victorian worker&#x27;s terraces in Darlington. This style of housing dominated the suburb and housed the workers for the railway workshops and nearby industries. Some earlier workers cottages dating from the 1870s-1880s remain in Thomas and Vine Streets.
===Adaptive reuse===
The McMurtrie, Kellermann &amp; Co factory stands on the corner of Abercrombie and Lawson Streets and is a landmark in the local neighbourhood marking the junction of five streets. This former boot factory represents the industrial development of Darlington from the late nineteenth century to the mid twentieth century and is historically significant for its connection to the Australian manufacturing of shoes from the 1880s to the 1920s and gas metres from the 1920s to the 1960s. The former factory also represents the historical development of the labour movement as the site of large strikes in 1935 protesting the replacement of skilled with unskilled workers. It was converted into residential and commercial space in 2002.

The IXL Garage building on Golden Grove Street was built in 1937 as a motor garage for the Henry Jones and Company factory and represents the industrial development of Darlington during the mid-twentieth century. It is historically significant for its connection to the development of the Australian food processing industry for jams, tinned fruits and other processed foods. The construction of the garage to house delivery trucks for the former IXL jam factory also represents technological advancements of the inter-war period through the growing use of motor vehicles for the distribution of products.

Examples of adaptive reuse in Darlington include several buildings converted into residential or mixed use, including:
* the former &quot;tinshed&quot; industrial site on the corner of Wilson and Shepherd Streets
* the former Blue Diamond Furniture factory on Boundary St
* The former Dempsey factory, the site of a successful legal case for communal residential living in 1978, designed by Col James, who lived there until shortly before his death in 2013
*Former automotive repair premises, Abercrombie Street 
*The NSW Institution for the Deaf, Dumb and Blind on City Road was the first school for the deaf in Australia. Benjamin Backhouse was appointed architect and the building was constructed in phases from the 1880s with additions until 1929. It is an eclectic mixture of late Victorian architectural styles featuring polychromatic brickwork, with flanking towers with Burgundian (French) style pyramidal roofs including dormers and decorative metal finials. The superintendent&#x27;s residence for the NSW Deaf Dumb and Blind Institute is a Victorian Italianate two-storey bay fronted villa, typical of a suburban villa of the late 1880s, with popular decorative motifs in cast iron and render, and reflects the status associated with the position of Superintendent. The residence was probably designed by A.L. and G. McCredie who succeeded Benjamin Backhouse, the original architect, on his retirement in 1884. The residence and garden were enclosed with a dwarf stone wall and iron palisade in 1892. It was refurbished in 1990 and is now the Darlington Centre conference facility.
The 1859 Cypress Hall on City Road, later called Leinster Hall, is a Regency villa built 1858–59, and concurrent with the Great Hall, is the oldest building at the University of Sydney. The nucleus of the villa remains highly intact, encapsulated within the walls of St Michael&#x27;s College, which was built in 1929. The villa is only one of a very few substantial Regency buildings from this period that has survived in the inner western area of Sydney and is the only known surviving Regency building in the Darlington area.

The old Darlington School was designed in 1877 and was one of a number of single-storey suburban schools designed by the architect to the Council of Education, George Allen Mansfield and opened in 1878. It is a two-storey Gothic Revival style building constructed of polychromatic brickwork, with a spire and a slate roof. It was transferred to the University of Sydney in 1976.

===Modern===
The Jane Foss Russell building in the grounds of Sydney University was named after Jane Foss Barff (née Russell) who became the first woman to receive a Master of Arts at Sydney University in 1889. It was built with multiple green glass facades and panels of different colors, types and styles covering different sides of the building. It features a large outdoor plaza with tiered seating, function space and cafes, interesting architectural themes and dynamic use of building materials. External balconies, terraced areas extending between floors, bleachers and an assortment of sitting areas are incorporated into the building&#x27;s design. The Gordon Yu-Hoi Chiu Building, University of Sydney, received the 1998 RAIA NSW Architecture Award for Public Buildings. The new Abercrombie precinct will be home for the new University of Sydney Business School.

==Education==
Darlington Public School is located on Abercrombie St for Preschool to Year 6.

TAFE NSW Eora (formerly the Eora Centre) is a campus of TAFE NSW Sydney Metro located on Abercrombie Street. It has been a centre for contemporary visual and performing arts and Aboriginal studies since it was established in July 1984. The building formerly housed the British United Shoe Machine Co.

Chippendale Child Care Centre at Pine St Chippendale provides the nearest early childhood education and care service.

==Sports==
Sydney University Sports and Aquatic Centre features swimming, tennis, basketball, gymnasium facilities. Victoria Park Pool and fitness centre is also located nearby in Victoria Park. Prince Alfred Park is located on Cleveland Street and has tennis, basketball and a newly refurbished swimming pool. A Seido Karate club is located on Abercrombie Street.

==Arts==
===Carriageworks===
The former Eveleigh Carriage Workshops is now Carriageworks, a centre for the nurturing, development and presentation of contemporary arts. It contains theatre, rehearsal and workshop spaces, a gallery and other facilities. Carriageworks is located off Wilson Street and is part of the adjacent suburb of Eveleigh. The Anna Schwartz Gallery is located on Wilson St within the Carriageworks complex.

===Tin Sheds===
Tin Sheds Gallery on City Road is a contemporary exhibition space located within the Faculty of Architecture, Design and Planning at the University of Sydney.

===Other galleries===
The Sheffer Gallery on Lander St supports challenging art from unrepresented artists, off-site exhibitions by other galleries and curators, and other art-related events. The Pine Street Creative Arts Centre has a branch at the Darlington Activity Centre on Shepherd Street. Another nearby gallery is the White Rabbit Gallery in Balfour Street, Chippendale which houses one of the world&#x27;s largest and most significant collections of contemporary Chinese art.

==Religion==

As described in Demographics, half of the residents of Darlington do not identify with a religion. However, there are several places of worship in the suburb, including the Greek Orthodox Parish and Community of &quot;The Dormition of Our Lady&quot; on Abercrombie Street, &quot;St Michael and all the Angels&quot; Melkite Cathedral on Golden Grove Street and the Portuguese Pentecostal Church on Abercrombie St.

==Transport==
Darlington is served by buses on the City Road and Cleveland Street routes and the railway stations at Redfern and nearby Macdonaldtown.

<doc id="1009701" wikidata="Q2560176" url="?curid=1009701" title="Minor seventh chord">
<text>In music, a minor seventh chord is a seventh chord composed of a root note, a minor third, a perfect fifth, and a minor seventh (1, 3, 5, 7). In other words, one could think of it as a minor triad with a minor seventh attached to it.
For example, the minor seventh chord built on A, commonly written as A−7, has pitches A-C-E-G: 

:&lt;score vorbis=&quot;1&quot; lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt;
{ \new Staff \with{ \magnifyStaff #1.5 } \relative c&#x27; {
 \override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
 &lt;a c e g&gt;1
&lt;/score&gt;

== Minor/minor seventh chord ==
A seventh chord with a minor third, perfect fifth, and minor seventh is commonly called a minor seventh chord, but also sometimes a minor/minor seventh chord to distinguish it from the minor/major seventh chord discussed below. It can be represented as either as m7 or −7, or in integer notation, {0, 3, 7, 10}.

This chord occurs on different scale degrees in different diatonic scales:

* In a major scale, it is on the supertonic, mediant, and submediant degrees (, , and ). This is why the ii in a ii–V–I turnaround is a minor seventh chord (ii7).

* In a natural minor scale, it is on the tonic, subdominant, and dominant degrees (, , and ).
* In a harmonic minor scale, it is only on the subdominant degree (). 
* In an ascending melodic minor scale, it is only on the supertonic degree ().

Example of tonic minor seventh chords include LaBelle&#x27;s &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;, Roberta Flack&#x27;s &quot;Killing Me Softly with His Song&quot;, The Doobie Brothers&#x27; &quot;Long Train Runnin&#x27;&quot;, Chic&#x27;s &quot;Le Freak&quot;, Lipps Inc.&#x27;s &quot;Funkytown&quot;, and the Eagles&#x27; &quot;One Of These Nights&quot;.

The major sixth chord (major triad with an added major sixth) is an inversion of this chord.

== Minor/major seventh chord ==
When the seventh note is a major seventh above the root, it is called a minor/major seventh chord. For example, the minor/major seventh chord built on C, commonly written as CmM7, has pitches C–E–G–B:

:&lt;score vorbis=&quot;1&quot; lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt;
{ \new Staff \with{ \magnifyStaff #1.5 } \relative c&#x27; {
 \override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
 &lt;c es g b&gt;1
&lt;/score&gt;

Its harmonic function is similar to that of a &quot;normal&quot; minor seventh, as is the minor seven flat five or half-diminished chord – but in each case, the altered tone (seventh or fifth, respectively) creates a different feeling which is exploited in modulations and to use leading-tones. 

==Minor seventh as virtual augmented sixth chord==

The minor seventh chord may also have its interval of minor seventh (between root and seventh degree, i.e.: C–B in C–E–G–B) rewritten as an augmented sixth C–E–G–A. Rearranging and transposing, this gives A–C–E–F, a virtual minor version of the German augmented sixth chord. Again like the typical augmented sixth, this enharmonic interpretation gives on a resolution irregular for the minor seventh but normal for the augmented sixth chord, where the 2 voices at the enharmonic major second converge to unison or diverge to octave. 

==Minor seventh chord table==

The just minor seventh chord is tuned in the ratios 10:12:15:18. This may be found on iii, vi, and vii. Another tuning may be in the ratios 48:40:32:27. 

==Minor seventh chords for guitar==

In standard tuning, the left is the low E string, the number is the fret, and x means mute the string.

* Am7: x02010 
* Bm7: xx7777
* Cm7: xx1313 
* Dm7: xx0211 
* Em7: xx0987 
* Fm7: xx1111
* Gm7: xx3333

<doc id="1009719" wikidata="Q4822916" url="?curid=1009719" title="Austext">
<text>Austext is the former Australian teletext service based in Brisbane, Queensland. The service was carried and operated by the Seven Network and its affiliates over most of Australia. It carried news, financial information, weather, lottery results, a TV guide and other information, as well as closed captioning for programs.

The service was freely available for viewing on any television, computer or other device with teletext functionality and the ability to access and view Channel Seven, or one of Seven&#x27;s regional affiliates Prime, GWN or Southern Cross.

==History==
Seven first began testing the Teletext services in 1979, starting regular service on 4 February 1980 with useful information being transmitted in 1982 in Brisbane and Sydney. Austext was shut down in September 2009. TCN, head station of the Nine Network and ATN&#x27;s competitor, tried a teletext service in 1977, but as of 1979 it wasn&#x27;t frequently updated due to the lack of teletext receivers.

In its early years, there were two separate services: 7-Text coming out of ATN in Sydney with a separate version for HSV-7 in Melbourne, and in Brisbane, SevenTel. In 1988, BTQ-7 became responsible for the national service and was renamed Austext.

==Content==
The information available on Austext pages included the latest in news, weather, racing, general interests and a television guide. Also available are contact details for Austext and state deaf associations.

The news pages included the latest in business, national news, international news, sport, science and technology, and showbiz.
The weather pages include same day forecast capital city temperatures, same day forecast conditions and minimum/maximum temperatures as well as current temperature, humidity, dew point, wind speed, wind direction, sunrise and sunset times, and an outlook for the next five days for major centres across Australia which was all supplied by the Bureau of Meteorology. The racing pages included a national TAB racing index which ceased operation on 4 August 2009. The general interest pages included items such as lottery results, daily horoscopes and a joke of the day. The service also carried a TV guide with listings for the Seven Network in its five metropolitan markets, as well as listings for other networks, both metropolitan and regional, until 2007 when they disappeared.

Closed captioning for programs on the Seven Network&#x27;s channels are also included in the Austext system. When produced by the Australian Caption Centre, they were branded as &quot;Supertext&quot;. To access closed captions through Austext, viewers enter the navigation code number 801 on an analog television or by pressing the Text, CC, Subtitle or a designated coloured button (depending on make and model) on their digital set top box or television.

==Closure==
In July 2009 Seven announced that Austext would shut down on 30 September 2009. This was due to claims from the network that the technology had come to the end of its useful service life and is not commercially viable to replace. Seven also noted the wide availability of alternate sources of information now accessible to viewers such as Seven&#x27;s own websites. Despite the closure, closed captioning services continued to remain available.

<text>James Landrum White (January 22, 1847 – March 8, 1925) was a shape note singing teacher, composer, and a reviser of his father&#x27;s shape note tunebook known as &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot;.

==Musical career==
In 1844, three years before J. L. White&#x27;s birth, B. F. White and Elisha J. King published &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot;, using the four-shape shape note system of notation. It was in the musical tradition established by this book that J. L. White would carry out his musical career.

This career was a curious and not entirely successful one. Although J. L. White was the most musically eminent son of the tradition&#x27;s revered founder, his tastes in sacred music were quite different from his father&#x27;s--and indeed, from a great number of other Sacred Harp singers. During his career J. L. White was involved in editorial work on at least four tune books, two of which can be viewed as his attempts to reshape the musical practice of the Sacred Harp singing community.

First, during his father&#x27;s lifetime, J. L. was heavily involved (according to J. S. James) in the 1869–1870 (4th) edition of his father&#x27;s book.

B. F. White died in 1879. In 1884, J. L. White and his brother, B. F., Jr., released the New Sacred Harp. It was a seven-shape note tune book of 192 pages (a little over 200 songs). Fewer than 20% of its songs were found in the &quot;Sacred Harp&quot;, and less than 5% of the songs were written in a minor key. Many of the old songs appeared with altered harmony. According to Gavin James Campbell (see reference below), this book was not a success:

Most singers held fast to their disintegrating 1869 editions rather than convert to &quot;The New Sacred Harp&quot;. Although a few orders continued to trickle in, the &quot;Musical Million&quot; [a leading shape note periodical] advertised the book for less than a year, and made no mention of it after 1890.

It was, however, probably more popular than previously supposed. For example, in 1891 singers in Leon County, Texas were singing &quot;every Sunday evening, using &quot;New Sacred Harp&quot;.&quot; As late as August 1896, the Withlacoochee Musical Convention, meeting in Berrien County, Georgia, adopted &quot;The Sacred New Harp&quot; &quot;for the next annual session.&quot;

In 1897, White and his nephew Charles P. Byrd, responding to a demand for the older book, issued a reprint of the fourth edition of the Sacred Harp.

In 1909, J.L. White made another effort to modernize the Sacred Harp. This time, he labeled his new book as the fifth edition of &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot;. The book began with B. F. White&#x27;s rudiments of music and about 300 pages of music from the fourth edition. Afterward appeared a second rudiments of music section by J. L. White and about 200 pages of new music, much of it in contemporary musical styles. The supplement also included settings of songs from the 1870 Sacred Harp with alto parts added. In the second part of the book, J. L. White undertook to correct his father&#x27;s &quot;errors in harmony,&quot; as he called them, by altering the notes in other parts as well—resulting, as Buell E. Cobb (see reference below) has maintained, in parts that were frequently monotonous and uninteresting to sing.

The 1909 edition not only failed to sell well, but was outright condemned by some Sacred Harp groups. The Cleburne County (Alabama) Sacred Harp Convention pledged that it would continue to use the old Fourth Edition. It called for a new revision, and asked that any new songs in subsequent revisions would &quot;be of the Sacred Harmony and arranged as in the Old Book.&quot; The Mulberry River Convention, also of Alabama, asked that any new songs be &quot;composed by Sacred Harp singers only.&quot;

White prepared a revised release of the &quot;fifth edition&quot; in 1910, and then scrapped the idea altogether by the next year. In 1911, he released &quot;The Sacred Harp, Fourth Edition with Supplement&quot;. This was the old 1870 edition with a supplement of newer gospel songs, but none of the reharmonizations of old songs. This 1911 &quot;White Book&quot; contained 597 total songs and was the largest of the early 20th century revisions of the &quot;Sacred Harp&quot;. In just two years, J. L. White made three attempts to revise the Sacred Harp in a manner that would satisfy Sacred Harp singers.

With the exception of the added gospel songs in close harmony, this 1911 &quot;White Book&quot; is the most traditional of the three early 20th century revisions of the Sacred Harp, reprinting the 1870 book almost &quot;verbatim&quot;, removing and/or adding alto parts to only a few of the old songs. Almost 60% of this book&#x27;s songs are presented in three-part harmonies.

Having satisfied the public&#x27;s demand for a more traditional book, J. L. White finally experienced a degree of success. During the first quarter of the 20th century, his &quot;Fourth Edition with Supplement&quot; was a strong competitor among the multiple contending revisions of B. F. White&#x27;s original book, particularly in areas where James&#x27;s &quot;Original Sacred Harp&quot; was also used. To counter White&#x27;s work, J. S. James brought suit against him, though unsuccessfully, seeking damages for infringement of copyright. The &quot;White Book&quot; became popular in the northern parts of Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi, eastern Tennessee, and some parts of south Georgia. It was used by black singers in northern Mississippi until it was no longer available.

In J. L. White&#x27;s lifetime, he released one slight revision of the book. After his death, without further revision, and eventually no more printings, the use of his book dwindled to a small following in northwest Georgia. The last printing of the White book was in 1946, although bound photostatic copies were made in 1958 through the generosity of H. A. Patillo. Today its use is continued in several singings held at the Hardeman Primitive Baptist Church in Decatur, Georgia. The book was republished in 2007, the Sacred Harp and folk music revival having finally benefitted it. With the republication, there is some new use of the book.

==Personal biography==
White was the eighth child of Benjamin Franklin White and Thurza Melvina Golightly. J. L.&#x27;s siblings were William Decatur, David Patillo, Robert H., Mary Caroline, Nancy Ogburn, Thurza Melvina, Benjamin Franklin, Jr., and Martha America. The Whites moved to Harris County, Georgia in 1842, where J. L. White was born.

On January 19, 1887, James Landrum White married Mary Melinda (Minnie) Clarke in Fulton County, Georgia. They made their home in the Atlanta area and had four children: Mary, James &amp; Benjamin (twins), and Julian. In addition to teaching music, J. L. farmed and sold pianos. He organized several singing conventions, keyed the music at conventions, sang tenor in the &quot;Sacred Harp&quot;, and was often a soloist in various churches around Atlanta. J. L. White is buried in the Miller-Clarke Cemetery in Lithonia, Georgia.

<text>George Howard (November 21, 1789 – August 2, 1846) was the 22nd Governor of the State of Maryland in the United States from 1831 to 1833. Howard was well known as a fervent anti-Jacksonian during his term in office. 
==Biography==
He was born on November 21, 1789, in the Governor&#x27;s Mansion in Annapolis, the second son of Gov. John Eager Howard (1752–1827) and Margaret Oswald &quot;Peggy&quot; Chew. The family later lived at &quot;Belvidere&quot; in Baltimore County, Maryland where he was educated by tutors. On December 26, 1811, he married Prudence Gough Ridgely, a daughter of Gov. Charles Carnan Ridgely (1760–1829) of Hampton and Priscilla Dorsey (1762–1814). Priscilla descended from the Dorsey family of Maryland; one of the original families of Maryland and founders of Anne Arundel County, Maryland. They received &quot;Waverly&quot; near Woodstock, Maryland as a wedding gift from his father. They had fourteen children (nine boys and five girls).

At &quot;Waverly,&quot; he led the life of a country gentleman and farmer. He was elected a member of the Governor&#x27;s Council in January 1831 and worked closely with his predecessor Daniel Martin. When Gov. Martin died in July 1831, Howard, as President of the Council, succeeded him, taking the oath of office on July 22 of that year. When Martin&#x27;s unexpired term ended in January 1832, the Maryland General Assembly elected Howard for a full-year term, receiving 64 of the 82 ballots cast.

Howard advocated the establishment of a State Bank, opposed the doctrine of nullification, was a foe of lotteries, and urged the endowment of Maryland colleges. Alexis de Tocqueville, the author of &quot;Democracy in America&quot;, described Howard in 1831 in his journal following several meetings as &quot;... the son of the famous Colonel Howard and the representative of one of the oldest families. All of these gentlemen [referring to Howard and a couple other sons of famous Revolutionary War figures] are very ordinary individuals and evidently owe their elevation simply to their names.&quot;
Howard held many slaves, but he was receptive to the movement to colonize free Negroes in Africa, telling the legislature &quot;The prosecution of this system may probably at some distant day, tend to the restoration of the whole of our colored population, to the land of their forefathers.&quot; In June 1842, Howard created and served as chair to the Maryland Slave-Holders Convention with Charles Carroll, Allen Thomas, CD Warfield, Upton Welsh, Benjamin Howard, Wesley Linthicum, and William H Worthington as representatives from the Howard district of Anne Arundel County (Now Howard County).

Howard retired to &quot;Waverly&quot; following the end of his term. He served as a presidential elector in 1836 and 1840, when he supported the Whig candidate. He died at his home on August 2, 1846, and was probably buried first in the family burial ground at &quot;Waverly.&quot; His remains were later removed to the Western Cemetery. His body was again removed, but its present resting place is unknown. He is believed to be buried in the Howard family vault at Old Saint Paul&#x27;s Cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland, where his father John Eager Howard is also buried. Howard left &quot;Waverly&quot; to his wife, Prudence, along with 22 slaves. She died the following year and willed the estate to the couple&#x27;s oldest son, George, Jr.

George Howard was painted by C. Gregory Stapko. His wife, Prudence Dorsey, was painted by Philip Tilyard. Her portrait can be found in the collection of Hampton National Historic Site HAMP 5662.

<text>Julio Garavito Armero (5 January 1865 – 11 March 1920) was a Colombian astronomer.

== Life ==
Born in Bogotá, he was a child prodigy in science and mathematics. He obtained his degrees as mathematician and civil engineer in the &quot;Universidad Nacional de Colombia&quot; (National university of Colombia). In 1892, he worked as the director of the &quot;Observatorio Astronómico Nacional&quot; (National Astronomical Observatory). His investigative works had been published in &quot;Los Anales de Ingeniería&quot; (The Annals of Engineering) since 1890, seven years before he took over editing the publication.

In his youth he studied at San Bartolomé high school, but in 1885 he had to interrupt his studies temporarily because of the civil wars which were affecting his home country. During the Thousand Days War, Garavito was part of a secret scientific society called &quot;El Círculo de los Nueve Puntos&quot; (the nine-point circle), where the condition for admission was to solve a problem about Euler&#x27;s theorem. This group was active until Garavito&#x27;s death. As an astronomer of the observatory, he did many useful scientific investigations such as calculating the latitude of Bogotá, studies about the comets which passed by the Earth between 1901 and 1910 (such as Comet Halley), and the 1916 solar eclipse (seen in the majority of Colombia).
But perhaps the most important were his studies about celestial mechanics, which finally turned into studies about lunar fluctuations and their influence on weather, floods, polar ice, and the Earthorbital acceleration (this was corroborated later). He worked also in other areas such as optics (this work was left unfinished at his death), and economics, by which he helped the country recover from the rough civil war. With this objective, he gave lectures and conferences in economics and the human factors which affected it, such as war or overpopulation.

He was later the director of the Chorographic Commission, created with the objectives of developing the Colombian railways and defining the frontier with Venezuela. He is believed to have questioned Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity . He has been compared to two great scientists of the 19th century: José Celestino Mutis and Francisco José de Caldas.

== Trivia ==

A crater on the Moon&#x27;s far side is named Garavito after him. One of the most prestigious universities in Colombia is also named after him: Escuela Colombiana de Ingeniería (Colombian School of Engineering &quot;Julio Garavito&quot;), created in 1972, with a special emphasis in Applied Sciences and Engineering.

His face appears on the 20,000 colombian peso bill, with the Moon on the same side of the bill, and the Earth as viewed from the Moon&#x27;s surface on the other side. Because of this, and the blue colour of the bill, there is a local folk superstition that bringing offerings of blue candles and blue flowers to his grave in the Central Cemetery of Bogotá and praying there can help one to become wealthy.

<text>High Island is an unincorporated community located in the Bolivar Peninsula census-designated place, Galveston County, Texas, United States. The community is located in the extreme eastern part of the county on Bolivar Peninsula, less than one mile from Chambers County and less than two miles from Jefferson County. , 500 people resided in High Island. The 2010 census did not record a population for High Island.

Houston Audubon operates four bird sanctuaries in the area, and the community is globally famous destination for birdwatchers particularly during spring migration from April 1 to May 15. Sea Rim State Park is in nearby Jefferson County, but it is inaccessible by State Highway 87, which has been closed since 1990.

==History==
High Island once had a large number of producing oil wells and was served by the Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe Railway&#x27;s branch line to Port Bolivar. Following the 1942 abandonment of trackage on the Bolivar Peninsula, High Island became the new terminus of the line until Santa Fe Railway removed its bobtail-truss swing bridge over Mud Bayou in 1969.

In the early 1970s, several victims of serial killer Dean Corll were buried by him and his accomplices at High Island&#x27;s beach. Six bodies were recovered by law enforcement personnel in August 1973, while one remains undiscovered.

In 1986, Hurricane Bonnie made landfall near High Island. And in 2007, Hurricane Humberto made landfall near High Island as well. 2008 saw Hurricane Ike impact High Island with significant storm surge and winds up to 110 mph (178 km/h). After Hurricane Ike the United States Postal Service temporarily relocated High Island post office box services to Winnie, Texas.

==Geography==
High Island lies on the eastern side of Galveston Bay, just inland from the Gulf of Mexico.

Located on the mainland, High Island&#x27;s name comes from the large salt dome under the area. This salt dome raises the elevation of the area to around 38 feet, giving High Island the highest elevation of any point on the Gulf coast from Mobile, Alabama to the Yucatán Peninsula. The metaphorical &quot;island&quot; (the term island is used to describe other Gulf Coast salt domes, such as Avery Island in Louisiana) has often served to protect its residents from the effects of hurricanes&#x27; storm surge.

The main route from Houston to High Island is to travel along Interstate 45 to Galveston, take the ferry to Port Bolivar, and then travel east to High Island.

==Education==
The High Island Independent School District serves the community.

High Island ISD is assigned to Galveston College in Galveston.

==Birding tourism==
Houston Audubon has 4 sanctuaries at High Island: Boy Scout Woods, Smith Oaks, Eubanks Woods, and the S.E. Gast Red Bay Sanctuary. Boy Scout Woods is the headquarters, which is staffed by volunteers during peak spring migration season from mid-March to mid-May. Smith Oaks is the largest sanctuary and home to the Rookery.

High Island, with its substantial wooded areas unlike elsewhere on the upper Texas coast, is a natural refuge for migrating birds making their perilous way across the Gulf of Mexico from the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico into their northern summering grounds in the United States and Canada. During this spring migration, the birds must navigate the hundreds of miles of overwater flight to find refuge and food on their journey northward.

During a normal spring migration, birders from around the world can find concentrated and high numbers of species of migratory birds in High Island that winter in southern Mexico, Central America, and South America, and make their summer breeding homes in the north.

The most spectacular bird viewing is during a spring northerly storm, which causes a &quot;fall out&quot; at High Island. During these storms, the migrating birds encounter strong head winds and a prolonged and energy-draining flight over the Gulf. Every bird that comes off the Gulf near High Island is then exhausted, and immediately seeks a dry land perch. In such conditions, the beaches of the Bolivar Peninsula can be covered with tens of thousands of birds. With its wooded areas and more ample feeding opportunities, almost every tree and open space in High Island is covered with exhausted birds.

Fall southerly migration also concentrates along the Gulf at sites such as High Island, but is more dispersed as the southerly moving birds find ample cover and food as they move southward through the United States.

<doc id="1009736" wikidata="Q4548967" url="?curid=1009736" title="12th man (football)">
<text>The 12th man or 12th player is a collective term for fans of sports teams in many eleven-a-side games, in particular association football. As most football leagues allow a maximum of eleven players per team on the playing field at a time, referring to a team&#x27;s fans as the 12th man implies that they have a potentially helpful and significant role in the game.

The presence of fans can have a notable impact on how the teams perform, an element in the home advantage. Namely, the home team fans would vocally support and urge on their team to win the game. Thus these fans will often create loud sounds or chant in the hope of encouraging their team; or of distracting, demoralizing or confusing the opposing team while they have possession of the ball; or to persuade a referee to make a favorable decision to the team. Noises are made by shouting, singing, whistling, stomping, clapping and various other techniques.

In Canadian football, 12 players from each team are usually on the field at one time and the term 13th man is often used to refer to fans. Similarly, in Australian rules football 18 players are on the field and the fans are often referred to as the 19th man. However, in basketball, where five players are on the court, the term &quot;Sixth man&quot; generally refers to an energetic substitute player. Similarly, in rugby sevens, with seven players from each team on the field, &quot;Eighth man&quot; is not used to refer to fans as the term refers to the eighth forward in rugby union. The term &quot;Twelfth Man&quot; has a specifically different meaning in cricket, referring instead to the nominated first substitute player who fields when a member of the fielding side is injured during play.

==History==
The first recorded use of the term &quot;twelfth man&quot; was a magazine published by the University of Minnesota in September 1900, that referred to &quot;the mysterious influence of the twelfth man on the team, the rooter&quot;. Later, in the November 1912 edition of &quot;The Iowa Alumnus&quot;, an alumni publication of the University of Iowa (then known as State University of Iowa), E. A. McGowan described the 1903 game between Iowa and the University of Illinois. In his article, &quot;The Twelfth Player&quot;, McGowan wrote: &quot;The eleven men had done their best; but the twelfth man on the team (the loyal spirited Iowa rooter) had won the game for old S.U.I.&quot;

The 1922 Dixie Classic served as the setting for an event later referred to as &quot;The story of the 12th Man&quot;. This football game featured the top-ranked Centre College and The Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas (later known as Texas A&amp;M). During the game, A&amp;M coach Dana X. Bible realized that one more injury would leave him without another backfield player to send into the game. Bible called E. King Gill, a sophomore basketball player, down from the stands to stand ready as a substitute. Gill was ready in uniform on the sidelines if his team needed him.

Individuals have occasionally been labeled by local media as the &quot;Twelfth Man&quot; of their team. In 1930, W. H. Adamson, Principal of Oak Cliff (Dallas) High School was called the &quot;Twelfth Man&quot; of the school&#x27;s American football team by a local reporter due to the rousing pre-game speeches he would give to the players. Likewise, sometimes, fans of both teams in an annual contest have been described as the 12th man.

In the 1935 Princeton– game before 56,000 fans who braved the snow and cold, spectator Mike Mesco was initially reported to have left his seat from the stands to join the Dartmouth defensive line and was referred to in a local newspaper as the &quot;Twelfth Dartmouth Man&quot;, though later was found to be not Mesco, but George Larsen of Cranford, New Jersey.

The term has been used by various American football teams including the University of Minnesota, the University of Iowa, Baylor University, Dartmouth College, Simmons College, Texas A&amp;M and the NFL&#x27;s Seattle Seahawks, Green Bay Packers, Buffalo Bills, Denver Broncos, Washington Commanders, Indianapolis Colts, Miami Dolphins, and Chicago Bears in marketing practices in reference to their supporters. The Bears currently use the phrase &quot;4th Phase&quot; (with the first three phases being offense, defense, and special teams), and the Seahawks currently use the phrase &quot;The 12s&quot;.

=== 12th Man Clubs ===
Many high schools in the United States incorporate 12th man language into their booster, supporter, or rooter clubs. Examples of such &quot;12th Man Clubs&quot; include the Dana Hills Dolphins, Washington Panthers, Richwood Knights, Diamond Bar Brahmas, Fairfield Falcons, and Brentwood Bruins.

The Campbellsville University Tigers of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics also have a 12th Man Club.

=== Buffalo Bills ===
On December 12, 1992, (12/12/1992) the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League honored their 12th Man as the seventh inductee into the Buffalo Bills Wall of Fame, located inside Highmark Stadium. Their fans were inducted because of their loyal support during the team&#x27;s early &#x27;90s Super Bowl runs, which coincided with quarterback Jim Kelly and his wearing of #12. In 2008, the Bills renamed their &quot;12th Man Walk of Fame&quot; as &quot;Tim Russert Plaza&quot;, in honor of the recently deceased Buffalo native and lifelong fan. The team continues to refer to its fans as the &quot;12th Man&quot;, with their independent, international fan clubs known as &quot;Bills Backers Chapters&quot;. The Bills have a licensing agreement with Texas A&amp;M over the use of the &quot;12th Man&quot; term.

=== Indianapolis Colts ===
Fans of the Indianapolis Colts of the NFL were known as the 12th Man. The Colts created a Ring of Honor on September 23, 1996, after playing 13 seasons in Indianapolis, Indiana. In 2007, the Colts inducted their 12th Man as the sixth entrant into the team&#x27;s Ring of Honor, then located on the interior facade of the RCA Dome. The Ring of Honor currently encircles Lucas Oil Stadium, the team&#x27;s home venue. The organization also designates a &quot;12th Man Fan of the Game&quot;. On November 12, 2015, Texas A&amp;M announced the filing of a lawsuit against the Colts based on the team&#x27;s usage of the term. On February 17, 2016, the lawsuit was settled with the Colts agreeing to remove the phrase from their Ring of Honor and to immediately cease all other uses of the trademarked phrase.

=== Seattle Seahawks ===

The Seattle Seahawks retired the number 12 jersey on December 15, 1984, in honor of their fans. In 2003, the Seahawks installed a giant flagpole in the south end zone of what is now Lumen Field, and began a tradition of raising a giant flag with the number 12 on it in honor of the fans, one of whom is Sam Adkins, the former Seahawks quarterback who did wear the number 12. Usually, a local celebrity or a season ticket holder raises the flag during pregame ceremonies. In recent years, 12th Man flags have been seen all over Seattle whenever the Seahawks make the playoffs, including atop the Space Needle. In 2014, Boeing painted a Boeing 747-8 freighter aircraft with a special Seahawks livery, with the number 12 on the tail, and they later flew it over eastern Washington in a flight path spelling the number 12. When the Seahawks took the field for Super Bowl XLVIII, they were led by LB Heath Farwell carrying the team&#x27;s 12th Man flag per team tradition. In May 2016, mountaineer David Liaño González displayed a 12th Man flag at the summit of Mount Everest.

The Seahawks&#x27; 12th Man has twice set the Guinness World Record loudest crowd noise at a sporting event, first on September 15, 2013, registering 136.6 dB during a game against the San Francisco 49ers and again on December 2, 2013, during a Monday Night Football game against the New Orleans Saints, with a roar of 137.6 dB. As per an agreement struck between the Seahawks and Texas A&amp;M in 2016, the Seahawks have virtually ceased from referring to their fans as the &quot;12th Man&quot;, and instead are using the term &quot;12s&quot; or the 12 Fan.

===Texas A&amp;M===
The first known instance of Texas A&amp;M referring to its fanbase as the &quot;12th Man&quot; is contained on page 17 of the November 25, 1921, edition of &quot;The Battalion&quot;, the Texas A&amp;M campus newspaper. Ever since the day E. King Gill left the stands in 1922, the entire student body has stood throughout the game to symbolize their &quot;readiness, desire, and enthusiasm&quot; to take the field if needed. A statue of E. King Gill stands on the campus.

Football coach Jackie Sherrill created the &quot;12th Man Kick-Off Team&quot; in the 1980s, composed of non-athletic scholarship students who tried out for the team. Coach Sherrill has written a book entitled &quot;No Experience Required&quot; which details this team and the tradition. These students were placed on the roster for the sole purpose of kickoffs. The squad was nicknamed &quot;the suicide squad&quot;. These students often had little regard for their safety and were determined to make a tackle at any cost. The 12th Man Kick-Off Team was extremely successful and eventually held opponents to one of the lowest yards-per-return average in the league during kickoffs. Later, head coach R. C. Slocum changed the team to allow only one representative of the 12th Man on the kick off team who wears uniform number 12. The player is chosen based on the level of determination and hard work shown in practices. Under Dennis Franchione, the 12th Man Kick-Off Team composed of walk-ons was brought back, though used only rarely when the team was up by quite a few points.

On June 30, 2014, Texas A&amp;M bought the domain name 12thman.com, which then became its official athletics website.

===Washington Redskins===
In 1986, the Washington Redskins (now known as the Washington Commanders) released a video entitled &quot;Thanks to the 12th Man&quot;. A blogger on NFL.com considered it to be among the worst sports videos of all time.

==Use in association football (soccer)==

The term &quot;12th man&quot; is commonly used in football to refer to the fans and occasionally the manager. A notable club famous for the twelfth man reference comes from Aston Villa, referring to the Holte End stand at Villa Park. Large European teams such as Bayern Munich, Malmö FF, Hammarby IF, Helsingborgs IF, Werder Bremen, Aberdeen, Rangers, Lazio, Feyenoord, PSV, Ferencvárosi TC, FC Red Star, Fenerbahçe S.K., and Sporting CP have officially retired the number 12 to the fans. Stockport County fans are registered as official members of their squad with the number 12. Portsmouth F.C. has also retired its number 12 shirt, and lists the club&#x27;s supporters, &quot;Pompey Fans&quot;, as player number 12 on the squad list printed in home match programmes, while Plymouth Argyle have theirs registered to the &quot;Green Army&quot; (the nickname for their fans). Number 12 is also reserved for the fans at many other clubs, including CSKA Moscow and Zenit Saint Petersburg in Russia, Bristol Rovers and Grimsby Town in England, as well as Aarhus Gymnastikforening (AGF), Odense Boldklub, also known as OB, in Denmark, Malmö FF and Hammarby IF in Sweden, Persija Jakarta in Indonesia, Botev Plovdiv in Bulgaria and Perth Glory in Australia. On Hammarby IF&#x27;s, Helsingborgs IF, Malmö FF, Feyenoord and Werder Bremen&#x27;s home games, the stadium speaker announces number 12 as &quot;the fans&quot; during team lineup announcements.

Dynamo Dresden in Germany also keeps number 12 for their fans, as well as the official team anthem being &quot;We are the 12th man&quot;. Aberdeen F.C. supporters commonly display a large banner in the shape of a football shirt with the text &quot;Red Army 12&quot; in place of a player&#x27;s name and number. The fans of the Northern Ireland national football team and Derry City are referred to as the 12th man as well. In the League of Ireland, Shamrock Rovers F.C. retired the number 12 jersey in recognition of the fans who took over the club in 2005. Cork City F.C., Clube Atlético Mineiro and Clube de Regatas do Flamengo also retired the number 12 for the fans. The most vociferous fans of Boca Juniors in Argentina are known as the &quot;Jugador Numero 12&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Player Number 12&quot;) or simply &quot;La Doce&quot; (&quot;The 12&quot;). On September 18, 2004, U.S. Lecce, an Italian team currently playing in Serie B, retired the number 12 to the fans, which was handed to them by the former captain Cristian Ledesma. They symbolically represent a 12th Man in the field. In the beginning of 2009–2010 season, Happy Valley AA introduced the club&#x27;s mascot, a panda, on squad list as the fan club captain wearing the number 12 jersey. As of the end of the 2011–2012 season, Rangers F.C announced that the number 12 jersey would be retired in honour of the fans support throughout a period of financial difficulty.

==Other usage==
In American football, the sideline is sometimes also referred to as the &quot;12th man&quot; or &quot;12th defender&quot;: since a player is considered down when he steps out of bounds, the sideline effectively acts as an extra defender. This usage is less common than the one referring to the fans. In most sports the term can also be construed to mean the referee, implying that the match official favours one team and is not impartial.

==Effects==
The effects of the &quot;12th man&quot; vary widely, but can be put in two categories. The first is simply psychological, the effect of showing the home team that they are appreciated, and showing the away team that they are somewhat unwelcome. The second directly relates to the deafening effects of a loud crowd.

In Association football, the crowd can be very passionate and often sing throughout the whole match. Some occasions where the crowd noise is extra loud can be before kickoff; during the buildup to and scoring of a goal; when encouraging the team to come back from defeat; to discourage an opposition penalty taker; or to harass a referee giving a free kick to the opposition team.

In American football, fans are most incited by physical play, especially good plays made by the defense. Additionally, the home team can derive energy from the loud noise of their fans; former American football players have described the feeling of their adrenaline pumping after hearing the fans yell, which is &quot;like you have a reserve energy tank&quot;.

The noise of the crowd can have a significant impact on the players on the field. In American football, an extremely loud crowd can prevent the offensive linemen from hearing the snap count. This can have the effect of making the player slower to react when the ball is snapped, and his eventual response may be weaker than normal because each play is begun &quot;with some indecision and doubt&quot;. The noise can also prevent players from hearing audibles and can make it difficult for the team&#x27;s offense to coordinate plays in the huddle. The effect of the noise can often be measured in mistakes, such as false start penalties.

Coaches can take steps to minimize the effect of the crowd noise on their teams. Some American football teams bring large speakers to their practice fields and broadcast loud noises such as jet engines to prepare their teams for the anticipated noise level. Crowd noise tends to diminish after a long lull in play, such as a pause for instant replay. Former NFL player Brian Baldinger speculates that some coaches draw out reviews as part of a coaching strategy to quiet the crowd for their next play.

A researcher from Harvard University discovered in a study that some association football referees appeared to be impacted by crowd noise. His studies revealed that a home team acquired an additional 0.1 goal advantage for every 10,000 fans in the stadium.

Delia Smith, Norwich City&#x27;s joint major shareholder, received some attention when she took to the pitch during a half time interval, with a microphone in hand and Sky TV cameras in tow, to tell fans the side &quot;need their twelfth man&quot;. &quot;Where are you?&quot; she cried. Norwich City lost the game in the final seconds, but Smith&#x27;s passion worked to increase the affection the fans held for her.

The current naturally loudest football stadium is Nef Stadium in Istanbul home of Galatasaray S.K. As a prepared attempt, the current world record for crowd noise at an athletic event was set on September 29, 2014, when the Kansas City Chiefs hosted the New England Patriots. Noise during that event reached a high of 142.2 decibels during a timeout.

==Texas A&amp;M trademark==
Texas A&amp;M University applied on December 26, 1989, for trademark U.S. Ser. No. related to usage of the term. The United States Patent and Trademark Office issued the September 4, 1990, to Texas A&amp;M. Four additional Trademark claims related to the &quot;12th Man&quot; term were also filed and granted at later dates by Texas A&amp;M University (See U.S. Ser. Nos. , , and ), the first three of which have achieved Incontestable Status as a result of its section 15 affidavit with the Patent and Trademark Office. According to former Texas A&amp;M Athletic Director Bill Byrne, he contacted the Chicago Bears and Buffalo Bills about halting their &quot;12th Man&quot; themes. Byrne stated that, &quot;they responded quickly with our requests to stop using our Twelfth Man trademark&quot;. Texas A&amp;M sent requests to stop using the phrase to the Seattle Seahawks in both 2004 and 2005. The Seahawks did not respond to the requests.

In January 2006, Texas A&amp;M filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against the Seattle Seahawks and in May 2006, the dispute was settled out of court. Neither side admitted any fault or liability. In the agreement, the Seahawks licensed the phrase in exchange for $100,000, along with public acknowledgement as to Texas A&amp;M&#x27;s ownership rights of the phrase, and an additional annual fee. The compensation amounted to $5,000 per year. The agreement, which expired in 2016, limited the Seahawks&#x27; usage to seven western states and forbid them from selling any &quot;12th Man&quot; merchandise. In August 2015, the Seahawks shifted towards calling their fans the &quot;12s&quot;, and replaced their &quot;Home of the 12th Man&quot; stadium sign with a new &quot;Home of the 12s&quot; sign.

On November 12, 2015, Texas A&amp;M filed suit against the Indianapolis Colts after repeated cease and desist requests were ignored by the NFL team. On February 17, 2016, the lawsuit was settled with the Colts agreeing to remove the phrase from their Ring of Honor and to immediately cease all other uses of the trademarked phrase.

In August 2016, the Seahawks agreed to a new five-year trademark licensing agreement with Texas A&amp;M. As part of the agreement, the Seahawks agreed to pay Texas A&amp;M $140,000 for limited rights to use the trademarked term. This agreement, like the previous agreement, prohibits the Seahawks from using the &quot;12th Man&quot; term on any merchandise. The new agreement, however, also prohibits Seattle from using the term on social media, nor are they allowed to use the term on any signage within their stadium, including their Ring of Honor.

<doc id="1009767" wikidata="Q342522" url="?curid=1009767" title="Acquiescence">
<text>In law, acquiescence occurs when a person knowingly stands by, without raising any objection to, the infringement of their rights, while someone else unknowingly and without malice aforethought acts in a manner inconsistent with their rights. As a result of acquiescence, the person whose rights are infringed may lose the ability to make a legal claim against the infringer, or may be unable to obtain an injunction against continued infringement. The doctrine infers a form of &quot;permission&quot; that results from silence or passiveness over an extended period of time.

==Overview==

Although not typically found in statutory law, the doctrine of acquiescence is well-supported by case law. One common context in which acquiescence is raised is when there is a dispute or disagreement over the location of a property line, followed by an extended period of time during which the parties respect a property line. Even if it is later discovered that the actual property line was in a different location, the long-term acquiescence to the incorrectly placed line may result in its becoming enforceable as the legal property line.

An example of the law of acquiescence occurred in a dispute between the State of Georgia and the State of South Carolina, in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that Georgia could no longer make any claim to an island in the Savannah River, despite the 1787 Treaty of Beaufort&#x27;s assignment to the contrary. The court said that Georgia had knowingly allowed South Carolina to join the island as a peninsula to its own coast by dumping sand from dredging, and to then levy property taxes on it for decades. Georgia thereby lost the island-turned-peninsula by its own acquiescence, even though the treaty had given it all of the islands in the river.

==Similar legal doctrines==

Doctrines similar to acquiescence include:

*The common law doctrine of estoppel. A claim of estoppel may arise when one party gives legal notice to a second party of a fact or claim, and the second party fails to challenge or refute that claim within a reasonable time. The second party may be said to have acquiesced to the claim, and thus to be &quot;estopped&quot; from later challenging it or making a counterclaim based upon the actions of the other party. Estoppel by acquiescence is different from estoppel by laches as acquiescence involves an intentional act of the party who is accused of acquiescence, while laches may result from conduct that is not voluntary. In international law, the ICJ distinguishes estoppel from acquiescence by stating that acquiescence is &quot;tacit recognition manifested by unilateral conduct which the other party may interpret as consent,&quot;
*Silence is acquiescence (aka. silent acquiescence and acquiescence by silence). Under this related doctrine, when confronted with a wrong or an act that can be considered a tortious act, one&#x27;s silence in the face of the transgression may result in a loss of a right to make a claim for loss or damage, on the principle of consent inferred from accepting or permitting the wrongful acts without protest or claim.

<doc id="1009768" wikidata="Q272917" url="?curid=1009768" title="Cheryl Hines">
<text>Cheryl Ruth Hines (born September 21, 1965) is an American actress, best known for her role as Cheryl David on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; (2000–2024), earning two Primetime Emmy Award nominations. She also starred as Dallas Royce on the ABC sitcom &quot;Suburgatory&quot; (2011–2014) and made her directorial debut with the 2009 film &quot;Serious Moonlight&quot;. Beyond acting, Hines is known for her advocacy work and public presence. She is married to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the current U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services and son of Senator Robert F. Kennedy.

== Early life and education ==
Hines was born in Miami Beach, Florida, to James and Rosemary Hines. She spent much of her childhood in Tallahassee, where she was actively involved in the Young Actors Theatre. Despite financial hardships—she reportedly did not have her own bed until after high school—she pursued her education at Lively Technical Center and Tallahassee State College before earning a degree in radio and television production from the University of Central Florida in 1990.

==Career==
Hines began her acting career by performing improvisational comedy at The Groundlings Theater. Her fellow students included Lisa Kudrow. Hines made guest appearances on television shows such as &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; and &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot;. She also appeared on an episode of &quot;The Dating Game&quot; in 1996. She was not picked on the episode.

Hines received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her work on &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; in 2003 and 2006. She has said that &quot;Until &quot;Curb&quot;, I&#x27;d done small roles, really small roles. They wanted to cast an unknown actress. It worked in my favor that I hadn&#x27;t done anything. It changed my life.&quot;

Hines appeared in &quot;RV&quot; with Robin Williams, &quot;Waitress&quot; with Keri Russell, and the 2008 mockumentary &quot;The Grand&quot;, a spoof of the World Series of Poker. Her 2009 directorial debut &quot;Serious Moonlight&quot; stars Meg Ryan with a script by the late Adrienne Shelly, Hines&#x27; director and co-star in &quot;Waitress&quot;.

Hines played Jane in the 2009 ABC sitcom &quot;In the Motherhood&quot;. It is a loose adaptation of the web series. The series was dropped due to low ratings after five of its planned seven episodes were aired. During the 2009–2010 season of &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;, Hines guest-starred as Kitty Walker McCallister&#x27;s campaign manager, Buffy. In July 2010, Hines was announced to be joining the cast of the Nickelodeon film based on &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;, &quot;A Fairly Odd Movie: Grow Up, Timmy Turner!&quot; as a human disguise of Wanda, Timmy&#x27;s fairy godmother.

Hines served as executive producer for the 2010 reality series &quot;School Pride&quot;, which follows the renovation of a different school each week. Hines starred as Dallas Royce on the ABC sitcom &quot;Suburgatory&quot;. The series ended in 2014 after three seasons. She appeared in &quot;We Need Help&quot;, a web series airing on Yahoo! Screen. On January 29, 2014, Hines received the 2,516th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Hines is a panelist on a singing game show, &quot;I Can See Your Voice.&quot;

==Personal life==
Hines married Paul Young, founder of the management firm Principato-Young, on December 30, 2002. They welcomed their daughter, Catherine Rose Young, on March 8, 2004. After nearly eight years of marriage, Hines and Young filed for divorce on July 20, 2010.

Hines has been actively involved in advocacy work, particularly with United Cerebral Palsy (UCP). Her involvement began after a nephew was born with cerebral palsy, prompting her to seek resources and support from the organization. Over time, she became a vocal advocate and now serves on UCP’s board of trustees. In 2015, Hines and her family won $25,000 for UCP while competing on &quot;Celebrity Family Feud&quot;.

Raised Catholic, Hines began dating Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in December 2011 after being introduced by her &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; co-star, Larry David. The couple announced their engagement in April 2014 and married on August 2, 2014, at the Kennedy Compound on Cape Cod.

<doc id="1009769" wikidata="Q3640333" url="?curid=1009769" title="Birmingham 6 (band)">
<text>Birmingham 6 is a Danish electro-industrial/EBM group founded in 1991 and named after the Birmingham Six, a group of Irish men wrongly imprisoned for the Birmingham pub bombings. Members include Kim Løhde Petersen and Michael Hillerup.

==Themes==
They took on the name as they focused on injustices worldwide, but particularly in western democratic society. Their lyrics have often been controversial and some radio stations have banned airplay of their songs, while other groups refused to be associated with them. Birmingham 6 has written several songs questioning governmental systems and their unwillingness to admit their own fallibility. &quot;Israel&quot; talks about the issues between the Palestinians and the Jews. &quot;Contagious&quot; discusses AIDS and &quot;Who Do You Love?&quot; points out the difficulty in telling good from evil. The song &quot;6794700&quot; describes church views on abortion they disagreed with. &quot;Love Child&quot; describes how the tourism agency in Thailand helps western travel agencies fulfill certain men&#x27;s desire for an underage prostitute. The song &quot;Policestate&quot; talks about the riots in Copenhagen in 1993 during the re-voting for the European Union in which police shot into the angry mob, injuring several protesters.

==Releases==
They released their first album, &quot;Mindhallucination&quot; in 1994. It was released in the United States in 1995 as &quot;Assassinate&quot; with a few track changes. Their next album, &quot;Error of Judgement&quot;, was released in 1996. In 1999, &quot;Resurrection&quot;, a collection of previously released tracks and two new remixes, was released. 7 tracks on the album &quot;Error of Judgement&quot; were sung by Jean-Luc de Meyer, better known as a member of Front 242.

Birmingham 6 also released a single of their cover of &quot;Godlike&quot; by KMFDM. Birmingham 6 covered AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;Thunderstruck&quot; for the 1997 tribute album &quot;Covered in Black&quot; on Cleopatra records. They also covered Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Seek and Destroy&quot; for the tribute album &quot;Tribute to... METALLICA&quot;.

==Touring==
In 1997, they embarked on a 5-week coast to coast U.S. Tour together with Seattle act Rorschach Test. Due to poor tour organisation, vocalist and original member Kim Løhde Petersen left the band after only four shows. At the time, they were noted as being &quot;among industrial music&#x27;s most compelling bands.&quot;

Unable to perform the remaining shows on the tour without Kim, the band broke up the tour, and returned to Denmark in a state of bankruptcy.

As a tribute to the Danish Club Metropolis, Kim Løhde Petersen and Michael Hillerup reunited for one night to play live at the club&#x27;s 10th anniversary party on March 7, 2003. The concert also featured Diary of Dreams.

In October 2008, Birmingham 6 performed at &quot;12. Elektrisch Festival&quot; in Zwickau, Germany. The German label Black Rain released the live compilation &quot;12. Electrisch Festival&quot; on 17 December 2008. This festival also featured &quot;Absolute Body Control&quot; and &quot;Tyske Ludder&quot;. The Birmingham 6 tracks featured on the live compilation are &quot;You Cannot Walk Here&quot; and a cover of KMFDM&#x27;s &quot;Godlike&quot;.

In March 2009, Birmingham 6 performed in Copenhagen at the &quot;10 Years of Black Rain&quot; show (celebrating the 10 year anniversary of the German label Black Rain) featuring Hicoctan (DE) and Feindflug (DE).

<doc id="1009772" wikidata="Q2850184" url="?curid=1009772" title="Anita Neville">
<text>Anita Ruth Neville (born July 22, 1942) is a former Canadian politician from Manitoba, who has served as the province&#x27;s 26th lieutenant governor since 2022. She was also a Liberal member of the House of Commons of Canada, first being elected in the general election of 2000. She was re-elected in 2004, 2006, and 2008. After serving for more than ten years, she lost her seat in the election of 2011.

In 2022, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, through Governor General Mary Simon, appointed Neville to succeed Janice Filmon as lieutenant governor of Manitoba. She is the first Jewish lieutenant governor of Manitoba and the third who is female.

==Early life and career==
Neville was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the University of Manitoba. Before entering political life, Neville worked as an economic development consultant for the province of Manitoba. She was a director of Workforce 2000 and the Winnipeg Core Area Initiative and Employment Training Program, and has also been involved in the Law Society of Manitoba and the Winnipeg Jewish Child and Family organization. During the 1990s, she was a member of the Canadian delegation which was responsible for monitoring elections in post-war Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Neville was for several years a school trustee on the Winnipeg School Board, representing Ward One in the Winnipeg School Division from 1986 to 2000. Neville regularly topped the poll in her three-member constituency. She served as Chair of the Board for five years (1987–1989; 1996–1998), and also chaired its finance committee for some time.

==Federal politics==
In the 1995 provincial election in Manitoba, Neville was a Liberal candidate in the upscale west-central Winnipeg riding of River Heights. This riding is usually considered as one of the few safe seats for the provincial Liberals, and was previously held by party leader Sharon Carstairs prior to her appointment to the Senate of Canada in 1994. Amid an ongoing drop in support for the Liberals, however, Neville came second with 4,435 votes, whereas Progressive Conservative candidate Mike Radcliffe got 5,429.

Later in 1995, Neville was re-elected as a Winnipeg school trustee, finishing in first place in Ward One with 13,828 votes. In the 1999 election, she chaired the successful campaign of provincial Liberal leader Jon Gerrard in River Heights.

In the 2000 federal election, Neville was the Liberal nominee for the Winnipeg South Centre district, previously held by the retiring Lloyd Axworthy. She was elected with 15,231 votes, against 10,675 for her nearest competitor, Progressive Conservative David Newman. This contest was notable for a controversy involving Canadian Alliance candidate Betty Granger, who made comments about Asian students that many interpreted as racist.

In the 2004 election, following substantial boundary reassignments, Neville was re-elected with 18,133 votes against 10,516 for Conservative candidate Raj Joshi.

In 2008, Neville was re-elected with 16,438 votes (42.3%) against 14,103 (36.3%) for Conservative Party candidate Trevor Kennerd, 5,490 (14.1%) for New Democratic Party candidate Rachel Heinrichs, and 2,860 (7.4%) for Green Party candidate Vere Scott.

During Paul Martin&#x27;s time as prime minister, Neville served as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage. She has also served as the Official Opposition Critic for Indigenous Affairs.

In the 2011 election, Neville lost to Conservative Joyce Bateman by 696 votes.

==Political interests==
Neville was the Official Opposition Critic for the Status of Women, and was a member of the Standing Committee on the Status of Women and the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development.

During her time in Parliament, Neville was a prominent Liberal supporter of Israel and co-chaired of the Liberal Parliamentarians for Israel with Senator David Smith. She was also a vocal opponent of the war with Iraq in early 2003 and was a leading opponent of the proposed American Missile Defense Shield. She has also supported numerous initiatives in the Indigenous community and supported the legalization of same-sex marriage in 2005.

<doc id="1009773" wikidata="Q1026107" url="?curid=1009773" title="Kaqchikel people">
<text>The Kaqchikel (also called Kachiquel) are one of the Indigenous Maya peoples of the midwestern highlands of Guatemala and of southern Mexico. They constitute Guatemala&#x27;s third largest Maya group. The name was formerly spelled in various other ways, including Cakchiquel, Kakchiquel, Caqchikel, and Cachiquel.

== Language ==
The Kaqchikel language, one of the Mayan languages from the Quichean branch, is spoken today by 400,000 people. It is closely related to the Tzutujil language. 

== Location ==
In Guatemala they live in the departments of Sololá, Chimaltenango, Sacatepéquez, Guatemala, Baja Verapaz Department, and Escuintla.

In Mexico, the Kaqchikel communities are located in the state of Chiapas, in the municipalities of Amatenango de la Frontera, Mazapa de Madero, Motozintla, Frontera Comalapa, El Porvenir and Villa Comatitlan, due to recent migrations, there are small Kaqchikel communities in the state of Campeche located in the municipalities of Campeche and Champotón.

== History ==
In Postclassic Maya times the capital of the main branch of the Kaqchikel was Iximché. Like the neighboring K&#x27;iche&#x27; (Quiché), they were governed by four lords: Tzotzil, Xahil, Tucuché and Acajal, who were responsible for the administrative, military and religious affairs. The Kakchikel recorded their history in the book &quot;Annals of the Cakchiquels&quot;, also known as &quot;Memorial de Sololá&quot;.

The Chajoma were another Kaqchikel-speaking people; the ruins of Mixco Viejo have been identified as their capital.

Iximché was conquered by the Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado in 1524. At that time, the Kaqchikel were the enemies of the neighbouring K&#x27;iche&#x27; Kingdom, and helped the Spaniards to conquer it. The first colonial capital of Guatemala, Tecpán Guatemala, was founded near Iximché on July 25, 1524. On November 22, 1527, after several Kaqchikel uprisings, the capital was moved to Ciudad Vieja, near Antigua Guatemala.

<doc id="1009776" wikidata="Q632552" url="?curid=1009776" title="French Parliament">
<text>The French Parliament (, ) is the bicameral parliament of the French Fifth Republic, consisting of the upper house, the Senate (), and the lower house, the National Assembly (). Each assembly conducts legislative sessions at separate locations in Paris: the Senate meets in the Palais du Luxembourg, the National Assembly convenes at the Palais Bourbon, both on the Rive Gauche.

Each house has its own regulations and rules of procedure. However, occasionally they may meet as a single house known as the Congress of the French Parliament (), convened at the Palace of Versailles, to revise and amend the Constitution of France.

== History and name ==
The French Parliament, as a legislative body, should not be confused with the various parlements of the Ancien Régime in France, which were regional appeals courts with certain administrative functions varying from province to province and as to whether the local law was written and Roman, or customary common law.

The word &quot;Parliament&quot;, in the modern meaning of the term, appeared in France in the 19th century, at the time of the constitutional monarchy of 1830–1848. It is never mentioned in any constitutional text until the Constitution of the 4th Republic in 1946. Before that time, reference was made to &quot;les Chambres&quot; or to each assembly, whatever its name, but unlike in Great Britain, the legislature as a whole had no name as such. 

Across the varied constitutional structures used in France since 1791, all have had a legislative body of varying names, which has for most of its history been bicameral (though at times unicameralism and more unorthodox forms with three or more chambers have existed).

== Election of representatives ==
The current Parliament is composed of two chambers: the upper Senate () and the lower National Assembly, which have 349 and 577 members respectively.

Deputies, who sit in the National Assembly, are elected by first past the post voting in two rounds for a term of five years, notwithstanding a dissolution of the Assembly. Each constituency has around 100,000 residents, though some variance of size exists between rural and urban constituencies. For example, the Val-d&#x27;Oise constituency has 188,000 electors, while Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon near Canada has just 6,000.

Senators are elected by indirect universal suffrage by the &quot;grands électeurs&quot;, who consist of deputies, regional councillors, departmental councillors and representatives of municipal councillors. The latter constitute 95% of the electoral body.

== Organization and powers ==
Normally, the parliament meets for a single nine-month session each year but under special circumstances the President of France can call an additional session. Parliamentary power was limited after the establishment of the Fifth Republic; however, the National Assembly can still cause a government to fall if an absolute majority of the legislators votes for a motion of no confidence. As a result, the government usually consists of members from the political party that dominates the Assembly and must be supported by a majority there to prevent a vote of no-confidence.

The Prime Minister and other government Ministers are appointed by the President, who is under no constitutional or other mandatory obligation to make governmental appointments from the ranks of the majority party in parliament. This is a safeguard that was introduced by the founder of the Fifth Republic, Charles de Gaulle, to attempt to prevent the disarray and horse-trading seen in the parliamentary regimes of the Third and Fourth Republics; however, in practice the prime minister and other ministers usually do belong to the majority party. A notable exception to this custom occurred during Nicolas Sarkozy&#x27;s premiership when he appointed socialist ministers and Secretary of State-level junior ministers to his government. The rare periods during which the president is not from the same political party as the prime minister are usually known as cohabitation. The Cabinet of Ministers is led by the President rather than the Prime Minister.

The government (or, when it sits in session every Wednesday, the cabinet) exerts considerable influence on the agenda of Parliament. The government can link its term to a legislative text which it proposes, and unless a motion of censure is introduced within 24 hours of the proposal and passed within 48 hours of introduction – thus full procedures last at most 72 hours – the text is considered adopted without a vote. However, this procedure was limited by a 2008 constitutional amendment. Legislative initiative rests with the National Assembly.

Legislators enjoy parliamentary immunity. Both assemblies have committees that write reports on a variety of topics. If necessary, they can establish parliamentary commissions of inquiry with broad investigative power. However, this is almost never exercised because the majority can reject a proposition by the opposition to create an investigatory commission. Also, such a commission may only be created if it does not interfere with a judicial investigation, meaning that in order to cancel its creation, one just needs to press charges on the topic concerned by the investigatory commission. Since 2008, the opposition may impose the creation of an investigative commission once a year, even against the wishes of the majority. However, they still cannot lead investigations if there is a judicial case in process already (or that starts after the commission is formed).

<text>Steele Rudd was the pen name of Arthur Hoey Davis (14 November 1868 – 11 October 1935) an Australian author, best known for his short story collection &quot;On Our Selection&quot;.

In 2009, as part of the Q150 celebrations, Rudd was named one of the Q150 Icons for his role in Queensland literature.

==Early life==
Davis was born at Drayton near Toowoomba, Queensland, the son of Thomas Davis (1828–1904), a blacksmith from Abernant in south Wales who arrived to Australia in 1847 due to a five-year conviction for petty theft, and Mary, née Green (1835–1893) an Irishwoman from Galway who was driven to emigrate by the Great Famine. The boy was the eighth child and fifth son in a family of 13 children. The father later on took up a selection at Emu Creek, and there Davis was educated at the local school. He left school before he was 12 and worked at odd jobs on a station, and at 15 years of age became a junior stockrider on a station on the Darling Downs. When he was 18 he was appointed a junior clerk in the office of the curator of intestate estates at Brisbane.

In 1889, Davis was transferred to the sheriff&#x27;s office and in his spare time took up rowing and when he began writing a column on rowing in a weekly paper and needed a pseudonym he adopted &quot;Steele Rudder&quot;, the first name from the English essayist Richard Steele, the second chosen because he wanted to bring into his name some part of a boat. Later it was shortened to &quot;Steele Rudd&quot;. During his time as under sheriff, Davis had to give the signal at the hanging of Patrick Kenniff which left him nervous and irritable for months after the event.

==Writing career==
Towards the end of 1895 Davis sent a sketch based on his father&#x27;s experience &#x27;Starting the selection&#x27; to &quot;The Bulletin&quot;. The sketch was published on 14 December 1895. This afterwards became the first chapter of &quot;On Our Selection&quot; when it was published in 1899. Encouraged by J. F. Archibald, Davis continued the series of sketches, 26 of which were included in the volume. Within four years 20,000 copies had been printed. It afterwards appeared in numerous cheap editions and by 1940 the number of copies sold had reached 250,000. The stories have also been the basis of a play and several films.

In 1903 &quot;Our New Selection&quot; appeared and in the same year Davis, who had reached the position of under-sheriff, retired from the public service. In January 1904, Davis brought out &quot;Rudd&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, a monthly magazine published at 6d. a copy, which continued for nearly four years. It was issued first from Brisbane and was afterwards transferred to Sydney. It had a much longer life than most Australian magazines, but there was not then a large enough public in Australia to enable a cheap popular magazine to be successful. It was revived under various names between 1923 and 1930.

Davis published a long series of volumes continuing the &quot;On Our Selection&quot; series, as listed below. Most were successful, but there could not have been a great deal of profit for the author from the cheap editions. Towards the end of his life appeared two capable books &quot;The Romance of Runnibede&quot; (1927), and &quot;Green Grey Homestead&quot; (1934). But Davis found that having established a reputation in one direction, it was difficult to find a public for books written in more serious vein, and during his last years he had to struggle to make a living. He died at Brisbane on 11 October 1935. Davis was twice married and was survived by three sons and a daughter by the first marriage. In addition to the volumes mentioned others will be found listed in &quot;Miller&#x27;s Australian Literature&quot;.

Davis was a tall, ruddy-faced man of mercurial temperament, fiery of temper, an excellent talker and a charming companion. He had a great love for horses and for 20 years was a well-known polo player. His books were written largely from the experiences of his own early days, and they were thoroughly appreciated by a generation that was familiar with characters on the land who had all the courage, optimism and humour of dad and mum and the other members of the family.

His reputation was established by his short stories of country life. The 1920 movie &quot;On Our Selection&quot; and 1932–1952 radio series &quot;Dad and Dave&quot; helped turn the characters into Australian cultural icons.

Davis, however, detested his struggling but admirable family being made into comic yokels, and had nothing to do with the radio program. There is no character called &#x27;Mabel&#x27; attached to Dave anywhere in the entire Rudd canon of fiction: Dave briefly had a girlfriend called Fanny in one story, and he eventually married a girl called Lily. Davis had a profound respect for the pioneering Australian woman, and he was particularly incensed by the use of &#x27;Mum&#x27; when referring to Mrs Rudd. &quot;&#x27;It is &#x27;Mother&#x27;, &#x27;Mother&#x27;, Mother!&#x27; he would shout, flushed in the face.&quot;

Examples of popular &#x27;Dad and Dave&#x27; jokes that did not originate from Rudd:

 &quot;Dad: Where&#x27;s Dave gone, Mum?&quot;

 &quot;Mum: Dave&#x27;s out Condobolin, Dad.&quot;

 &quot;Dad: Out Condobolin? Cripes, I didn&#x27;t think Dave had any time for the womenfolk!&quot;

 &quot;Dave: Hey Dad! Them telephone blokes are silly coots! One of them just rung up to say it&#x27;s a long distance from Sydney!&quot;

The humour of Rudd&#x27;s &quot;Selection&quot; stories arises from character and situation, and never involves wisecracks like these.

A replica of Rudd&#x27;s shingle hut can still be seen at the town of Nobby, Queensland. There is a statue of Steele Rudd at the Speakers&#x27; Corner in King George Square in Brisbane. There is also a residential college named &quot;Steele Rudd&quot; at the University of Southern Queensland campus.

There are copper statues of Dad, Dave, Mum and Mabel at Gundagai.

==Quotation==
In his 1908 book, &quot;Dad in Politics&quot;, Davis satirises political life in the opening sentence:

This quotation is often used to illustrate the cynicism of Australians towards the political class. FitzHenry notes that Davis&#x27;s satirical depiction of individual members of the Queensland Parliament was so close to reality that he was almost called to the Bar of the House of Parliament for breach of parliamentary privilege.

==Dramatisation==
* 1912 &quot;Our Selection&quot; was performed as adapted by actor Bert Bailey ( 1868–1935)

A play titled &quot;The Execution of Steele Rudd&quot; by Australian playwright Harry Reade was first staged in 1981 by the National Theatre at the Playhouse, Perth, directed by Stephen Barry. It portrays the character and actions of Davis who is employed in the sheriff&#x27;s office, managing arrangements for the execution of two criminals. The play was also staged by Melbourne&#x27;s Playbox Theatre in 1983.

<text>Stephen Orr Spurrier (born April 20, 1945) is an American former football player and coach. He played ten seasons in the National Football League (NFL) before coaching for 38 years, primarily in college. He is often referred to by his nickname, &quot;the Head Ball Coach&quot;. He played college football as a quarterback for the Florida Gators, where he won the 1966 Heisman Trophy. The San Francisco 49ers selected him in the first round of the 1967 NFL draft, and he spent a decade playing in the National Football League (NFL) mainly as a backup quarterback and punter. Spurrier was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1986.

After retiring as a player, Spurrier went into coaching and spent five years as a college assistant for the Florida Gators, the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, and the Duke Blue Devils where he began to develop his innovative offensive system while serving as the Blue Devils offensive coordinator in the early 1980s. He was hired to his first head coaching job by the Tampa Bay Bandits of the United States Football League (USFL) in 1983 and led the team to two playoff appearances in three seasons before the league folded. Spurrier returned to the college ranks in 1987, serving as the head football coach at Duke (three seasons), Florida (12 seasons), and South Carolina (10.5 seasons), amassing 228 total wins and a 72% career winning percentage. Between his stints at Florida and South Carolina, he led the Washington Redskins for two seasons with less success. Spurrier retired from coaching in 2015 and became an ambassador and consultant for the University of Florida&#x27;s athletic department, though he briefly returned to the sidelines to coach the Orlando Apollos of the short-lived Alliance of American Football in 2019. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 2017, making him one of four members to be inducted as both a player and a coach.

Spurrier&#x27;s teams were known for winning with aggressive and high-scoring offenses, and he became known for teasing and &quot;needling&quot; rivals both before and after beating them on the field. Spurrier&#x27;s 1989 Duke squad won the program&#x27;s only Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championship since 1962. He is the winningest coach in both Florida and South Carolina program history, making him the only coach to hold the record for most wins at two different Southeastern Conference (SEC) schools. Florida&#x27;s streak of four consecutive SEC championships in the mid-1990s is the second-longest in conference history behind Bear Bryant&#x27;s 1970s Alabama teams. And when Florida quarterback Danny Wuerffel won the Heisman Trophy during the Gators 1996 national championship season, Spurrier became the only Heisman Trophy winner to coach another Heisman Trophy winner.

In recognition to his contributions to the university and its football program, the University of Florida officially renamed the Gators home field &quot;Steve Spurrier-Florida Field at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium&quot; in 2016.

==Early life==
Spurrier was born on April 20, 1945, in Miami Beach, Florida. He is the second son of a Presbyterian minister, J. Graham Spurrier, and his wife Marjorie. Graham Spurrier changed congregations repeatedly during Steve&#x27;s early childhood, resulting in several moves for the family. The Spurriers left Miami Beach before Steve&#x27;s first birthday, moving to Charlotte, North Carolina to live near his paternal grandparents. His father accepted pastorships in Athens, Tennessee and then Newport, Tennessee before settling in Johnson City, Tennessee in 1957, when Steve Spurrier was 12 years old. The youngest Spurrier began to earn his reputation as a good athlete and a fierce competitor in Johnson City, impressing his peers and his older brother&#x27;s friends with his tenacity in sandlot sports.

Spurrier&#x27;s skills as a young baseball player caused a local businessman to talk the Reverend Spurrier into coaching the Little League team sponsored by his business so that Spurrier&#x27;s son would be on the squad. The younger Spurrier has often repeated an anecdote about playing baseball on a team coached by his father. &quot;How many of you believe that it&#x27;s not whether you win or lose, but how you play the game, that counts?&quot; the elder Spurrier once asked his players. When some raised their hands, he told them, &quot;Well, I don&#x27;t believe in that saying. If they&#x27;re keeping score, we&#x27;re going to play to win.&quot;

== Playing career ==

=== Science Hill High School ===
Spurrier attended Science Hill High School in Johnson City, Tennessee, where he played football, basketball and baseball for the Science Hill Hilltoppers and was an all-state selection in all three sports. Spurrier had an undefeated record in three years as a high school starting pitcher and led his team to two consecutive state baseball championships. On the basketball court, Spurrier played point guard and was known for his ability to run his team&#x27;s offense with flashy passes and dribbling and his knack for scoring in many different ways, attributes which helped his team win two conference championships. He averaged 22 points per game during his senior season and was named the conference player of the year.

Many observers in Johnson City thought that Spurrier&#x27;s best sport in high school was basketball, while his father thought that he was best at baseball. Spurrier agreed that basketball and baseball came more naturally, but he preferred football, and he became the Hilltopper&#x27;s starting quarterback during his junior year. Coach Kermit Tipton installed a passing offense to take advantage of Spurrier&#x27;s talents and, unusual for a high school team, occasionally allowed the young quarterback to call plays on the field. Boosted by a post-season game at the end of his senior year in which he brought his team back from a 21–0 second-half deficit to win 28–21, Spurrier was a high school All-American and drew the attention of many college programs.

Spurrier&#x27;s achievements in multiple sports earned him induction into the National Federation of State High School Associations&#x27;s National High School Hall of Fame.

=== University of Florida ===

====Recruitment====
After winning multiple all-state honors in high school, Spurrier was recruited in one or more sports by many colleges, including Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, Kentucky, Duke, South Carolina, and both Air Force and Army. However, he was not aggressively pursued as a football player by the coaching staff at the University of Tennessee in nearby Knoxville because at the time, Tennessee ran a wing-T offense that featured a running quarterback while Spurrier was an excellent passer. While Tennessee never officially offered him a football scholarship, Volunteers basketball coach Ray Mears offered Spurrier a scholarship, which he declined since he preferred to play football.

University of Florida coach Ray Graves heard about Spurrier late in the recruiting process from his brother Edwin, who was the postmaster in Knoxville, and visited Johnson City in February 1963. Spurrier and his family got along well with Graves, and Steve visited the Florida campus in Gainesville the following week. He received a favorable first impression of Gainesville when he arrived to find warm sunshine after leaving freezing temperatures in Tennessee, and thought more highly of Graves when the coach stayed by his side in the school infirmary after Spurrier&#x27;s cold worsened into the flu during his recruiting visit. Graves did not promise Spurrier that he would be his starting quarterback, but he told the star recruit that he fit into his coaching staff&#x27;s plan to open up the Gator offense and would be given a fair opportunity to earn the job. Soon after returning home, Spurrier decided to attend the University of Florida because of &quot;the passing, the SEC, the weather, and coach Ray Graves.&quot;

====1963–64====
NCAA rules in the 1960s forbade college freshmen from participating in varsity sports competition. Spurrier therefore spent his first year at Florida practicing with the varsity team and playing on the freshman team, which scheduled four scrimmages against other schools&#x27; freshman squads as a way for young players to gain experience. In 1963, Spurrier led the &quot;Baby Gators&quot; to a 45–12 victory over Georgia&#x27;s freshman team at Florida Field, a game which he half-jokingly claims as a home win against the Gators&#x27; fiercest rivals.

Spurrier was in competition for the starting quarterback position leading up to his sophomore year of 1964 until a serious knee injury suffered during spring drills allowed returning senior starter Tommy Shannon to keep the job. Coach Ray Graves still felt the need to get the future star on the field, so he decided to alternate Shannon and Spurrier as the flow of the game dictated. Spurrier entered the season-opening game against SMU in the second quarter. After two unsuccessful running plays called from the sidelines put the Gators in a third down and long situation, Coach Graves told Spurrier to call the next play himself. The young quarterback responded by completing a fifty-six yard screen pass on his first collegiate attempt and another pass for a touchdown on his second pass. Spurrier would add another touchdown pass during the second half of his varsity debut. The following week on the road at Mississippi State, Spurrier entered a tied game late in the fourth quarter and led the Gators down the field for a game-winning field goal.
Spurrier continued to alternate with starter Tommy Shannon as the season progressed, gaining more playing time every week. After being named SEC Back of the Week for a two touchdown performance in a 30–14 upset over Ole Miss in October, Spurrier was given the starting nod for the undefeated Gators&#x27; next game against undefeated and #3 ranked and eventual national champion Alabama in Tuscaloosa. Though Spurrier threw a touchdown pass and was the Gators&#x27; offensive star, his team fell short when another late fourth quarter comeback attempt ended in a missed field goal and a 17–14 Alabama win. Spurrier remained the Gators&#x27; starter for the remainder of the season and was sometimes brilliant but inconsistent. He led the Gators to a 14–0 home win over rival Auburn and a 20–6 upset of #7 LSU in Baton Rouge, but he did not play well in losses to rivals Georgia and Florida State. Nevertheless, he was named the SEC&#x27;s Sophomore of the Year for 1964.

====1965–66====

Spurrier was the Gators&#x27; starting quarterback and team leader in 1965 and 1966. He finished ninth in Heisman Trophy voting for the 1965 season. He finished his three-year, thirty-one-game college career having completed 392 of 692 attempts for 4,848 passing yards and 37 touchdowns, breaking every UF and many conference records for passing and total offense. In addition to being a stellar passer, Spurrier gained notoriety by playing his best under pressure; eight times during his college career, he led the Gators to fourth-quarter comeback wins. The most memorable example was a November 1966 game against Auburn, when, after leading the team down the field on a two minute drill, he waved off Florida&#x27;s regular placekicker and booted a forty-yard field goal, giving the Gators a 30–27 win and likely securing himself the Heisman Trophy. This penchant for dramatic comebacks prompted John Logue of the &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot; to famously write &quot;Blindfolded, with his back to the wall, with his hands tied behind him, Steve Spurrier would be a two-point favorite at his own execution.&quot;

As a junior, Spurrier was named a Football Writers Association of America first-team All-American and is still the only player from the losing team to be named the MVP of the Sugar Bowl after passing for a record 352 yards in leading a furious fourth-quarter rally that fell just short. As a senior, Spurrier was awarded many national recognitions, including the 1966 Heisman Trophy and Walter Camp Memorial Trophy, and was a unanimous first-team All-American. He was also the 1966 recipient of Florida&#x27;s Fergie Ferguson Award, which recognizes the &quot;senior football player who displays outstanding leadership, character and courage.&quot;

Though the 9–2 1966 season was one of the best in program football history up to that point (along with the 1928 Florida Gators football team), the Gators fell short of their elusive first conference title due to a 27–10 upset loss to arch-rival Georgia, a loss that Spurrier would remember when he returned as Florida&#x27;s coach and made beating Georgia a priority.

In 2006, Spurrier was recognized by &quot;The Gainesville Sun&quot; as the No. 2 player of the first century of the Gators football program.

Spurrier was among the test subjects who was given a prototype for what would become Gatorade during the 1965 season. Spurrier was unsure of whether or not the beverage had a substantial impact on the team&#x27;s success.

=== National Football League ===

====San Francisco 49ers====
The San Francisco 49ers selected Spurrier with the third overall pick of the 1967 NFL/AFL draft, trading up to land the star quarterback. Spurrier was told by team officials that he was being prepped to replace veteran 49ers quarterback and frequent All-Pro John Brodie in &quot;four or five years&quot;, a situation which negatively affected his motivation. &quot;I was not a very ambitious player&quot;, Spurrier admitted in his 2016 autobiography.

Spurrier had few opportunities to play and fewer to start early in his pro career, and he did not play very well when he got on the field. He attempted less than five passes over the entire season in three out of his first five years in the NFL, and he did not throw a touchdown pass until his third pro season. Instead, he settled into the role of backup quarterback and starting punter.

Spurrier&#x27;s first extended opportunity came in 1972, when an injured ankle left Brodie unable to play for over a month. San Francisco was 2–3 when Spurrier became the starter, and he led the team to a 6–1–1 record, throwing sixteen touchdowns over eight games and putting them in a position to make the playoffs. Spurrier continued to start even after Brodie had recovered. However, when he threw three interceptions in the first half of the regular-season finale, Brodie entered the game and led a second-half comeback that clinched a playoff spot. Head coach Dick Nolan chose to start Brodie in the first round of the playoffs against the Dallas Cowboys, whom the 49ers had beaten 31–10 on Thanksgiving Day in Texas with Spurrier starting. Spurrier did not make an appearance in the playoff rematch, and the Cowboys intercepted Brodie twice on their way to a 30–28 victory that ended the 49ers&#x27; season.

Spurrier next had an opportunity to start in the fifth game of the 1973 season, when he replaced a slumping Brodie against the Minnesota Vikings. Teammates later claimed that Spurrier drew new plays in the huddle in the snow at old Metropolitan Stadium on his way to a team-record 31 completions and 320 passing yards, but he also tossed two interceptions, and the 49ers lost 17–14. Spurrier&#x27;s lingering knee injury flared up after the game, so 49ers Coach Nolan decided to start third-stringer Joe Reed the following week, and Spurrier played sparingly the remainder of the season.

Spurrier had successful knee surgery in the offseason and, with his NFL contract expired, listened to offers from teams in the new World Football League. However, Brodie had retired, and as the heir apparent to the 49ers&#x27; starting quarterback position in 1974, Spurrier decided to re-sign with San Francisco. Spurrier played well in the preseason and had seemingly secured the starting job, but these plans were derailed when he suffered a badly dislocated shoulder in the final preseason game. The injury required surgery, and he missed virtually the entire season. A serious offseason traffic accident reaggravated the injury, and Spurrier was again the 49ers backup quarterback to start the 1975 season, this time to veteran Norm Snead.

The 49ers began the 1975 season with a 2–5 record, prompting Spurrier to ask Nolan for a chance to start against the Los Angeles Rams, who had dominated the rivalry during his tenure in San Francisco. Nolan agreed, and Spurrier led his team to a 24–23 comeback win, throwing for 240 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions in what he later called his &quot;best, or at least favorite&quot; game of his pro career. The performance earned him the starting job, and the 49ers won the next two games behind Spurrier to get back to 5–5. However, they lost their next four games, Spurrier was sent back to the bench, and Coach Nolan was fired at the conclusion of the season. Incoming coach Monte Clark traded multiple high draft picks for New England Patriots&#x27; quarterback Jim Plunkett, making it clear that Spurrier would not be a part of the 49ers&#x27; rebuilding plans. Overall, he was 13–12–1 as a starter with San Francisco.

====Tampa Bay Buccaneers====
In April 1976, Spurrier was sent to the expansion Tampa Bay Buccaneers in exchange for two players and a second-round draft pick as part of the new franchise&#x27;s first trade. The Buccaneers&#x27; new acquisition generated local excitement, as Spurrier had been a college star at the nearby University of Florida. He won the job as team&#x27;s first starting quarterback, a title that he later regretted, as the undermanned Bucs went on to suffer the first winless season (0–14) in modern NFL history. Though he had looked forward to playing professional football in Florida, Spurrier was frustrated by the losses, the constant hits absorbed while playing behind a porous offensive line, and his philosophical differences with Bucs coach John McKay. McKay insisted on employing a run-heavy attack similar to the offense he had used to win championships with the USC Trojans, while Spurrier felt that the team did not have the right personnel to run the ball effectively and should employ a more pass-oriented offense. Another point of contention was Coach McKay&#x27;s insistence that his son, John McKay, Jr., be the Bucs&#x27; primary wide receiver while Spurrier and other observers felt that he did not have the talent to fill that role.

The Bucs cut Spurrier in April 1977, a move that left him &quot;puzzled and disappointed&quot; since he had been working out with the team up to that point and had not been told that his release was imminent. He signed with the Denver Broncos in July and was released after playing in several preseason games, then briefly signed with the Miami Dolphins but was released in the last round of cuts before the beginning of the regular season, at which point he decided to end his playing career.

Over 10 NFL seasons, Spurrier played in 106 games (starting 38), completing 597 passes in 1,151 attempts, for a total of 6,878 yards, 40 touchdowns, and 60 interceptions. He also punted 230 times for a 38.3-yard average.

== Coaching career ==

=== Assistant coach ===

==== Florida (1978) ====
Spurrier spent fall 1977 out of football, living in Gainesville with his young family and considering possible career choices. While not officially connected with the University of Florida at the time, he was often on campus, running at the university&#x27;s track and attending football games as a fan. He watched the Gators play to a 6–4–1 record in 1977, a season that prompted head coach Doug Dickey to scrap the wishbone-based run-heavy attack that his teams had used for several years with declining success in favor of a more open pro-style offense. To effect this change, Dickey revamped his offensive staff, and he hired Spurrier to his first coaching job as Florida&#x27;s quarterbacks and receivers coach.

The changes did not bring many positive results. While Florida&#x27;s passing attack improved and former option quarterback Cris Collinsworth was named to the All-SEC team as a wide receiver under Spurrier&#x27;s tutelage, the 1978 Gators&#x27; overall scoring output was almost identical to that of 1977 at about 22 points per game. The team&#x27;s record also slumped to 4–7, leading to Dickey&#x27;s dismissal. Spurrier expressed an interest in becoming Florida&#x27;s next head coach but was not a serious candidate due to his lack of experience, and Clemson coach Charley Pell was hired soon after the conclusion of the season. Pell chose not to retain any of Dickey&#x27;s coaching staff, leaving Spurrier without a job.

In later years, Spurrier has repeatedly thanked Doug Dickey for giving him a chance to get into coaching with no prior experience.

==== Georgia Tech (1979) ====
Spurrier was unsure if he wanted to continue pursuing a coaching career after his unpleasant experience at Florida, stating that he would only accept a position &quot;if the opportunity was really right.&quot; In 1979, he accepted an offer to become the quarterbacks coach at Georgia Tech under head coach Pepper Rodgers, who had been an offensive assistant at Florida when Spurrier was the quarterback.

Like Dickey at Florida, Rodgers sought to shift Georgia Tech&#x27;s offense from a wishbone attack to a more passing-oriented offense. And also like Dickey, Rodgers&#x27;s efforts did not produce immediate results. The Yellow Jackets began the season 1–5–1 and did not score more than 14 points against a Division I-A opponent over its first seven games. Spurrier, who had not been tasked with constructing a game plan and had seldom been allowed to call plays up to that point, asked Coach Rodgers for a larger role on the staff and was allowed to take control of the offense for the eighth game of the season, against Duke. Georgia Tech surprised Duke with a more aggressive offense than they&#x27;d run all year, and the Yellow Jackets won, 24–14. With Spurrier continuing to call plays, Georgia Tech won the next two games as well, scoring over 20 points in both contests and setting a Georgia Tech record for passing yardage in a season. But the campaign ended with a 16–3 loss to archrival Georgia, dropping Georgia Tech to 4–6–1 overall and leading to Rodgers&#x27; dismissal.

Spurrier asked incoming head coach Bill Curry if he would be retained as Georgia Tech&#x27;s quarterback coach and was told that he was one of &quot;two or three&quot; candidates for the job, prompting him to seek employment elsewhere. Spurrier would not forget being dismissed by Curry in 1980. In later years, Spurrier repeatedly mentioned his perfect record (6–0) against Curry&#x27;s teams when they met as head coaches, often by very lopsided margins.

==== Duke (1980–1982) ====
In 1980, Spurrier was hired to be the offensive coordinator at Duke University by head coach Red Wilson, who had been impressed by Spurrier&#x27;s coaching abilities the previous season when Georgia Tech had upset Wilson&#x27;s Duke squad. Wilson gave the young coach free rein to design the offense, coach the quarterbacks, and call the plays, and Spurrier met the challenge by developing a record-breaking offense that Duke fans nicknamed &quot;Air Ball&quot;. Under Spurrier, Blue Devils quarterback Ben Bennett set an NCAA record for career passing yardage, receiver Chris Castor was named ACC player of the year, and Duke&#x27;s 1982 team became the first in Atlantic Coast Conference history to average more than 300 passing yards per game. Duke earned two straight winning seasons in 1981 and 1982, a feat that the program had not achieved since 1970 and 1971 and would not achieve again until Spurrier returned as the school&#x27;s head football coach later in the decade. They also upset Tennessee in Knoxville 25–24 in 1982 on an 88-yard touchdown pass during Spurrier&#x27;s first return to the state as an opponent.

In later years, Spurrier has stated that his seasons working to get maximum production out of outmanned Duke squads were critical to his development as a coach and an offensive strategist. Success at a school not known for its football program also built Spurrier&#x27;s reputation as an innovative young offensive coach who could improvise and succeed without seeming to work very hard. Duke quarterback Ben Bennett recalls Spurrier diagraming a trick halfback option play with his cereal on the morning before a game, and the play going for a 60-yard touchdown pass that afternoon. During another game, Spurrier devised a new pass play on the sideline which Duke ran for a touchdown on its next offensive possession. Coach Wilson had not seen the play before, and when he asked Spurrier what play he&#x27;d called, the young assistant replied &quot;Touchdown, coach.&quot;

=== Head coach ===
==== Tampa Bay Bandits (1983–1985) ====
In 1983, Spurrier returned to Tampa to accept his first head coaching position with the Tampa Bay Bandits of the new United States Football League (USFL). At 37 years old, Spurrier was the youngest head coach in professional football at the time.

&quot;BanditBall&quot; was marketed as a fun alternative to the woeful Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who were in the midst of a record-setting streak of losing seasons. Spurrier&#x27;s wide-open offense was prominently featured, as was starting quarterback John Reaves, who had broken many of Spurrier&#x27;s passing records at the University of Florida and had grown up in Tampa. The Bandits&#x27; attendance was the highest in the USFL over its three-year run, and Spurrier&#x27;s offenses were consistently among the league&#x27;s best. The team narrowly missed the playoffs in their first season and made the postseason the next two years. Overall, Spurrier led the Bandits to 35–21 record before the USFL dissolved after the 1985 season.

==== Duke (1987–1989) ====
Spurrier spent 1986 out of football as the USFL&#x27;s planned move to a fall schedule never took place. When it became clear that the Bandits would not retake the field, Spurrier began to seek new coaching opportunities. He interviewed to be the head coach at Mississippi State, but was passed over in favor of Rockey Felker. He also sought to be the head coach at LSU, but was passed over in favor of Mike Archer.

Finally, Spurrier returned to Duke University as the Blue Devils&#x27; new head coach and offensive coordinator in 1987. Spurrier proceeded to raise the Blue Devils to levels of success that the program had not realized in over twenty-five years. His offenses broke numerous school and conference records for scoring, passing yards, and total yards, many of which had been set during his tenure as Duke&#x27;s offensive coordinator. His 1989 Duke squad was the most successful, winning Duke&#x27;s first Atlantic Coast Conference championship since 1962 (and most recent to date), and appearing in their first bowl game since 1960.

In what would become a recurring trend at most of his coaching stops, Spurrier&#x27;s teams regularly beat their biggest rivals while he brashly &quot;needled&quot; them with jokes and &quot;zingers&quot; that were amusing to his fans but infuriating to opponents. Spurrier&#x27;s Duke squads went 3–0 against archrival North Carolina, including a 41–0 victory in Chapel Hill that clinched a share of the 1989 ACC title. At Spurrier&#x27;s suggestion, that win was followed by a joyful team picture taken in front of the Kenan Memorial Stadium scoreboard, a photo that still rankles some Tar Heel supporters.

For his success, Spurrier was named the ACC Coach of the Year in both 1988 and 1989.

==== Florida (1990–2001) ====
In December 1989, Spurrier accepted an offer to return to the University of Florida as the Gators&#x27; &quot;head ball coach.&quot; He had privately expressed interest in the job in early October, when Florida coach Galen Hall was fired mid-season for his alleged involvement in an NCAA rules violation and prominent Gator boosters reached out to Spurrier. However, he delayed any further discussion at that time to concentrate on coaching Duke. After the Blue Devils clinched the ACC championship in their last regular season game, Spurrier met with University of Florida president Robert Bryan and athletic director Bill Arnsparger, and he agreed in principle to return to Florida on December 12.

Spurrier asked to delay an official announcement until both Florida and Duke had played in their respective bowl games. As rumors swirled, however, Spurrier broke the news to his Duke team on December 27, the night before they played in the 1989 All-American Bowl. They played poorly and lost, and Spurrier later decided that he should have waited to tell his team until after the game, and that when it came to coaching jobs, &quot;it&#x27;s best to make your decision and move on quickly&quot;. Spurrier was officially announced as Florida&#x27;s new football coach on December 31, 1989.

During his introductory press conference on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1989, Spurrier said that he wanted to immediately change several things, including bringing back blue jerseys (Florida had switched from traditional blue to orange in 1979 under Charley Pell), bringing back natural grass to Florida Field (artificial turf had been installed in the early 1970s), and putting Miami back on the schedule (the schools&#x27; annual series had ended after the 1987 game). He stressed the need to beat traditional rivals Auburn, Georgia, and Florida State, against whom Florida had gone 0–9 over the previous three seasons. Finally, he worked to convince Gator players and fans alike that it was possible to win championships at Florida, which had still never won an officially recognized conference title in 83 years of football. To that effect, he put together a booklet called &quot;The Gator Mentality&quot;, in which is collected coaching tips and theories that he used himself along with inspirational quotes he shared with his players.

Spurrier inherited a team under NCAA investigation for the second time in five years. He successfully steered the program away from the previous scandals and led the Gators to the best record in the SEC in his first year, though they were declared ineligible for the league title due to NCAA probation handed down during the season. Building on the success of Spurrier&#x27;s first year, Florida finally captured their first officially recognized SEC title in 1991. Under Spurrier, the Gators represented the SEC East in the first five SEC Championship Games, winning four of them. The 1996 team captured the Gators&#x27; first-ever National Championship with a 52–20 win over Florida State in the Sugar Bowl, avenging the Gators&#x27; sole regular-season loss in which Florida State upset Florida 24–21 in Tallahassee.

Spurrier&#x27;s finest moment as a coach may have been the Gators&#x27; 1997 game against the previously undefeated and national title game-bound Florida State Seminoles. Spurrier used a two-quarterback offense, rotating quarterbacks Doug Johnson and Noah Brindise in and out of the game, confusing the Florida State defense and its veteran coordinator, Mickey Andrews, and giving Spurrier more time to counsel his quarterbacks on the sidelines without having to use time-outs. Florida upset the heavily favored Seminoles 32–29.

Significantly, Spurrier is credited with changing the way the SEC played football. Spurrier employed a pass-oriented offense (known in the sports media as the &quot;Fun &#x27;n&#x27; Gun&quot;) in contrast to the ball-control, rush-oriented offenses that were traditionally played in the SEC. His innovative offensive schemes forced many coaches in the SEC to change their offensive and defensive play-calling.

While his offensive style used a more wide-open passing game than the SEC was accustomed to, Spurrier was also able to utilize a constant group of talented running backs. Many of them would later go on to have success at the NFL level, including Errict Rhett, Fred Taylor, Terry Jackson, and Earnest Graham.

Spurrier and his Gators accomplished a number of memorable feats during his twelve seasons in Gainesville (1990–2001), including:

* Won one national championship (1996), and played for another (1995).
* Won six SEC championships (1991, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 2000).
* Named SEC Coach of the Year five times (1990, 1991, 1994, 1995, 1996).
* First Heisman Trophy-winner to coach a Heisman Trophy-winner (Danny Wuerffel).
* Won at least nine games in each of his twelve seasons, one of only three coaches in major college history to do so.
* Averaged more than ten wins per season.
* Ranked in the final top fifteen in each of his twelve seasons, including nine top-ten finishes, five final top-five rankings, and an average end-of-season ranking of 6.8.
* Appeared among the top twenty-five teams in the weekly polls 202 of a possible 203 weeks, including each of his last 202 consecutive weeks. The Gators were ranked number one in the polls twenty-nine times, appeared among the top five team for 117 weeks, and among the nation&#x27;s top ten teams for 179 weeks.
* Appeared in a bowl game in each of his last eleven seasons—every season in which the Gators were eligible—one of only five schools to do so during the same time period.
* Only coach in major college history to win as many as 120 games in his first twelve seasons at one school (an overall record of 122–27–1, with a winning percentage of .8167).
* One of only two coaches in major college history to win ten or more games in six consecutive seasons (1993–1998).
* Only college football team to score at least 500 points, including bowl games, for four consecutive years (1993–1996) since the NCAA began keeping statistics in 1937.

Spurrier is also credited with creating the nickname &quot;The Swamp&quot; for Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, the Gators&#x27; home field. In the early 1990s, he said, &quot;. . . a swamp is where Gators live. We feel comfortable there, but we hope our opponents feel tentative. A swamp is hot and sticky and can be dangerous. Only Gators get out alive.&quot; Soon after becoming head coach, he insisted that the artificial turf then in use at the stadium be replaced with natural grass, and the &quot;Swamp&quot; remains a natural surface field today. During Spurrier&#x27;s tenure, the Gators built up one of the most formidable home-field advantages in the nation; they would not lose a home SEC game until 1994, and would only suffer two more home losses to conference opponents during his 12-year run. Largely due to the formidable home-field advantage Spurrier built, he is by far the winningest coach in Florida history as his 122 wins are 52 more than runner-up Graves.

Spurrier was known for his gamesmanship while coaching Florida, doing such things as giving much-derided Georgia coach Ray Goff the nickname of &quot;Ray Goof.&quot; His rivalry with the Tennessee Volunteers and their coach Phillip Fulmer became highly publicized, as Spurrier would gig the Volunteers after the Gators&#x27; wins over Tennessee, saying that &quot;you can&#x27;t spell &#x27;Citrus&#x27; without &#x27;UT,&#x27;&quot; a reference to the Citrus Bowl, which at the time had the contractual right to select the second-place SEC football team. He also said of Peyton Manning, Tennessee&#x27;s quarterback, &quot;I know why Peyton came back for his senior year: he wanted to be a three-time Citrus Bowl MVP!&quot;

Other memorable one-liners from Steve Spurrier included nicknaming rival Florida State University, &quot;Free Shoes University&quot;, for the Seminoles&#x27; NCAA troubles with recruiting violations.

On January 4, 2002, Spurrier abruptly resigned as head coach, stating, &quot;I simply believe that twelve years as head coach at a major university in the SEC is long enough.&quot;

Before Spurrier returned to coach his Gamecocks against the Gators in 2006 and 2008, his most recent visits to Gainesville were on September 2, 2006, to take part in the Gators&#x27; celebration of the 10-year anniversary of their 1996 championship season, and on September 30, 2006, when he was one of the first four inductees into the Gator Football Ring of Honor, alongside Danny Wuerffel, Emmitt Smith, and Jack Youngblood. At both appearances, Spurrier received standing ovations from the crowd.

Spurrier retains a deep affection and loyalty for his alma mater, and sometimes still accidentally says &quot;we&quot; when referring to the University of Florida. The feeling is mutual; he remains very much in the good graces of Gator fans for building their program into a perennial national power. When he was inducted into the Gators&#x27; &quot;Ring of Honor&quot;, Spurrier humbly announced to the sell-out crowd at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium: &quot;I&#x27;d just like to thank coach Ray Graves for bringing the skinny kid from Tennessee to the University of Florida.&quot; Additionally, in 2016, the university added his name to the playing surface at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium; it is now Steve Spurrier-Florida Field.

Spurrier has not let his affection for the University of Florida get in the way of a budding Florida-South Carolina rivalry, however. In 2005, his Gamecocks upset the Gators 30–22 in Columbia, costing the Gators a shot at the SEC championship. And in November 2010, he coached South Carolina to a 36–14 victory in Gainesville (their first ever on Florida Field) in a game that decided the SEC Eastern Division title.

==== Washington Redskins (2002–2003) ====

Ten days after Spurrier resigned his position at the University of Florida, he became head coach of the NFL&#x27;s Washington Redskins. Spurrier&#x27;s five-year, $25 million contract with the Redskins was the most lucrative coaching contract in the history of the NFL at the time.

A fast start to the 2002 season raised hopes for Spurrier&#x27;s potential success. The Redskins led off the preseason in Japan, where they beat the San Francisco 49ers 38–7 in the American Bowl. The team threw for over 400 yards and was accused of running up the score, a charge frequently leveled against Spurrier at Florida. The Redskins went 4–1 in the preseason (including a 40–10 win in Tampa against Spurrier&#x27;s last professional team, the Buccaneers) and won the first game of the regular season 31–23, with Shane Matthews throwing for 327 yards and 3 touchdowns against the Arizona Cardinals. However, subsequent opponents were able to slow Spurrier&#x27;s offense, mainly by using disguised blitzes to disrupt the passing game. By the end of the season, the Redskins were ranked 25th (out of 32 teams) in scoring offense and finished with a 7–9 record. It was only Spurrier&#x27;s second losing campaign in 18 years as a head coach, the first being his first year at Duke.

In 2003, the Redskins started 2–0 but finished 5–11, with several close losses coming down to the 4th quarter. The offense was a bit improved, but the departure of defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis to become the head coach of the Cincinnati Bengals saw the defense fade from 5th in scoring defense during the previous season to 24th in 2003. The team as a whole faded late in the season, and were outscored 85–31 over their last three games. Spurrier resigned on December 30, 2003, choosing to walk away from $15 million still owed to him over the remaining three years of his contract. In a statement released by the team, Spurrier said &quot;I apologize to Redskins fans that we did not reach a level of success that we had all hoped... It&#x27;s a long grind and I feel (that) after 20 years as a head coach there are other things I need to do. I simply believe this is the right time for me to move on because this team needs new leadership.&quot;

Spurrier&#x27;s disappointing tenure as an NFL head coach has been heavily scrutinized and analysed. During his first season in Washington, Spurrier brought in several of his former stars from Florida, including quarterbacks Danny Wuerffel and Shane Matthews, leading to criticism that he played favorites. Also criticized was his decision to bring along most of his coaching staff from Florida even though they had little or no experience coaching professional football (the exception being Marvin Lewis, who was a veteran NFL coach).
As the 2002 season progressed, an increasing number of philosophical, strategic, and player personnel differences began to cause a rift between Spurrier and the Washington front office, including team owner Daniel Snyder. Snyder pushed for the drafting of Tulane quarterback Patrick Ramsey in the 2002 NFL draft, and though Spurrier said that he would not play Ramsey very much during his rookie season, the coach was pressured to use him by team officials, and Ramsey was starting by game 4. The quarterback position continued to be a source of friction, particularly when, over Spurrier&#x27;s objections, the front office decided to release Wuerffel before the start of Spurrier&#x27;s second season. Spurrier later said that he &quot;knew it was over&quot; when he &quot;wasn&#x27;t allowed to pick the backup quarterback&quot;.

Spurrier spoke about his NFL coaching experience during SEC Media Days in 2014. &quot;When I left Florida after 12 years, I thought I was going to coach in the NFL five or six years and retire to the beach, and play golf a bunch, and travel around, this, that and the other. But that was a bad plan. It was. Later you found out that was not a real good idea. But that&#x27;s the way I was thinking back then.&quot;. After retiring from coaching, Spurrier further reflected on his NFL stint in several interviews. In a 2016 appearance on the Paul Finebaum Show, Spurrier reflected that the Redskins might not have been the best choice for his jump to the NFL. &quot;I went to the team that offered the most money instead of the best situation&quot;, he said. And in 2015, he told David Feherty that, &quot;The owner and the personnel guys, they picked the team. I couldn’t even pick the quarterback the second year. So I knew it wasn’t going to work, but that&#x27;s ok. I probably didn’t do a very good job, and the situation wasn’t what I was looking for, so it was time to move on.&quot; In an interview with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 2019, Spurrier said of his time in Washington that &quot;I did a lousy job. The GM did a lousy job. He happened to be the owner, so who needed to go?&quot;

==== South Carolina (2005–2015) ====

Throughout the 2004 football season, various sources openly speculated about Spurrier returning to coach in the college ranks once again, preferably for a program located in the southeastern United States and even more preferably, somewhere in his beloved Southeastern Conference. The University of Florida was in the process of taking applications for a new coach after Spurrier&#x27;s successor at Florida, Ron Zook, was fired following the 2004 season. The timing seemed perfect for Spurrier&#x27;s return to the Gators and Spurrier initially said that he wanted to be considered for his old job, but later removed his name from consideration stating that &quot;12 years at Florida was probably long enough.&quot; Soon afterwards, rumors began circulating that South Carolina Gamecocks&#x27; Athletic Director, Mike McGee, was actively pursuing Spurrier and that Spurrier was considering the Gamecocks&#x27; offer. Again, the timing was perfect and on November 22, South Carolina coach Lou Holtz announced his retirement and, during his final press conference, hinted that Spurrier might replace him. The next day, months of rumors were put to rest as Spurrier was introduced as South Carolina&#x27;s new head coach. Spurrier had signed a seven-year deal that paid him $1.25 million per year and the Steve Spurrier era began for the Gamecocks.

In 2005, his first season as the Gamecocks&#x27; new head coach, Spurrier led his South Carolina Gamecocks with newfound humility. The Gamecocks, who were not expected to have a winning season by most pundits, rattled off a five-game SEC winning streak for the first time in their fourteen-year SEC history. Included among those victories were historic wins at Tennessee (16–15) – the program&#x27;s first win in Knoxville – and against then 12th-ranked Florida (30–22), who South Carolina had not beaten since 1939. The Associated Press named Spurrier the SEC Coach of the Year, and the Gamecocks finished the 2005 season with a 7–5 record and a trip to the Independence Bowl.

Two days prior to South Carolina&#x27;s 2006 season opener, Spurrier announced that he would kick off the athletics department&#x27;s capital campaign with a $250,000 donation over five years. Spurrier&#x27;s Gamecocks opened the 2006 season with a 15–0 win over Mississippi State in Starkville, where he was 0–2 while coaching the Florida Gators. With the victory, he reached 150 wins for his college coaching career. On September 30, Spurrier was inducted into the Gator Football Ring of Honor in a pre-game ceremony in Gainesville. Later in the season on November 11, Spurrier returned to &quot;The Swamp&quot; to face off against his former Gators team, which was then ranked sixth in the BCS rankings. Trailing 17–16, the Gamecocks had a chance to win with a 48-yard field goal attempt on the last play of the game. However, Ryan Succop&#x27;s kick was blocked as time expired in a repeat of an earlier blocked extra-point attempt.

In the final game of the 2006 regular season, Spurrier led the Gamecocks to victory over in-state rival Clemson at Death Valley. Trailing 28–14 in the third quarter, South Carolina scored seventeen unanswered points to lead 31–28. With only seconds remaining, Clemson&#x27;s field goal attempt missed wide left and the Gamecocks celebrated their first victory over Clemson in five years.

On December 2, 2006, amid speculation he was a candidate for head coaching jobs at Miami and Alabama, Spurrier received a contract extension through 2012 and a raise from $1.25 million to $1.75 million annually. Spurrier and the Gamecocks went on to defeat the Houston Cougars in the Liberty Bowl on December 29, and finished the season 8–5. All five of the Gamecocks&#x27; 2006 losses were to ranked opponents. Spurrier became the first head coach in Gamecock football history to take a team to a bowl game in each of his first two seasons.

The 2007 football season, got off to a quick start winning at SEC rival Georgia early in the season as well as Louisiana-Lafayette and South Carolina State, and climbed into the top 10 in the national rankings. South Carolina stumbled down the stretch dropping the final five games, including a home loss in the season finale to arch-rival Clemson. The 6-6 (3-5 SEC) season record marked the first non-winning college season for Spurrier since his first season at Duke in 1987.

Spurrier won his 100th SEC game on October 11, 2008, coaching the Gamecocks to a 24–17 victory over Kentucky. In his ten seasons as the Gamecocks&#x27; head coach, Spurrier has beaten each of South Carolina&#x27;s traditional SEC Eastern Division rivals at least five times. Against their annual SEC Eastern Division opponents, his ten teams have posted an 8–2 record against Kentucky, 8–2 against Vanderbilt, 5–5 against Tennessee, 5–5 against Georgia, 5–5 against Florida, and 2–1 against Missouri who began competing in the SEC in 2012. Against South Carolina&#x27;s major in-state rival, Clemson, Spurrier&#x27;s Gamecocks have gone 6–4. While Spurrier&#x27;s teams at South Carolina have shown flashes of his old &quot;Fun &#x27;n&#x27; Gun&quot; offense, they have mostly relied on stout defense to win upsets. The Gamecocks have been bowl eligible every year Spurrier has been their head coach, a feat no other Carolina coach has accomplished. Also, the Gamecocks have been ranked in the AP Poll Top 25 at some point during the season in nine out of Spurrier&#x27;s ten years at South Carolina

In 2009, Steve Spurrier&#x27;s Gamecocks upset #4 Ole Miss 16–10 in Columbia, their first victory over a Top 5 team.

Spurrier&#x27;s Gamecocks won the SEC Eastern Division championship for the first time in school history in 2010, clinching the title with a convincing 36–14 victory at &quot;The Swamp&quot; over the Florida Gators. It was a season of firsts for South Carolina, including their first win at Florida, first win over a No. 1 ranked team (Alabama), and first time sweeping the November &quot;Orange Crush&quot; portion of their schedule with wins over Tennessee, Florida and Clemson. Following a 9–3 regular season and an appearance in the SEC championship game, Spurrier was named SEC Coach of the Year by his fellow coaches in the conference.

The Gamecocks had another strong season in 2011, beating every opponent in the division. However, losses to Arkansas and Auburn cost them a return appearance in the SEC title game. With a 34–13 rout of Clemson, the Gamecocks won 10 games for only the second time in their 119-year football history. In the 2012 Capital One Bowl, the Gamecocks dispatched Nebraska 30–13 to win their school-record 11th game. They also finished eighth in the AP Poll and ninth in the Coaches&#x27; Poll—their first top-ten finishes in a major media poll in school history.

In 2012 Spurrier led the Gamecocks to their second-consecutive regular season with double-digit wins—something no Gamecock team had ever achieved. The 2012 regular season culminated with the annual season-ending game against Clemson at Clemson&#x27;s Memorial Stadium. Spurrier and his Gamecocks emerged with a fourth consecutive double-digit victory over the Tigers. That win was also Spurrier&#x27;s 65th win with the Gamecocks, vaulting him past Rex Enright to become the winningest coach in South Carolina&#x27;s history. Spurrier led the Gamecocks to a thrilling 33–28 victory in the 2013 Outback Bowl against the winningest program in college football, the Michigan Wolverines. The victory elevated the Gamecocks to an 11–2 record for the 2nd consecutive season. Additionally, by finishing 8th in the Associated Press poll and 7th in the Coaches poll, South Carolina finished in Top 10 of both polls for the second year in a row.

During the 2013 season, Spurrier led his Gamecocks to a third consecutive 11–2 record. Only two other programs (Alabama and Oregon) have won 11 or more games each of the last three seasons (2011–13). During the season, the Gamecocks defeated three teams that finished ranked in the Top 10 in the final AP Poll (Missouri, University of Central Florida, and Clemson). The Gamecocks were the only team to accomplish this feat. They also became the first and only team to defeat two teams that won BCS bowl games. Following their 34–24 win over Wisconsin in the Capital One Bowl, the Gamecocks were ranked 4th in the final AP Poll, setting a record for the program. This also marked the third straight year that the Gamecocks finished with a Top 10 ranking in the final AP Poll. While defeating Clemson, again, the Gamecocks ran their winning streak over their archrival to five games, which is the longest winning streak in the rivalry, for either team, since 1940. The 31–17 score marked the 5th straight double-digit margin of victory over their ACC foe. Also, for the 5th straight year, the Gamecocks defense held the Tigers to 17 points or less. They would go on to defeat Wisconsin in the Capital One bowl 34–24 and would finish the year ranked #4, their highest finish ever in a season.

The 2014 Gamecocks endured a disappointing season, going 7–6 overall and 3–5 against SEC opponents, and finishing in fifth place in their division. With 4 losses and only 2 wins by the middle of the 2015 season, Spurrier announced to his team and staff on October 12, 2015, that he had resigned as head coach. He publicly confirmed his intentions at a press conference the following day. Spurrier reiterated that he was not officially retiring, but added he would probably never coach again.

A popular tradition, started during the Sparky Woods era at USC, occurs on the last Saturday of July when the University of South Carolina athletics department hosts the annual &quot;Steve Spurrier Ladies Football Clinic.&quot; Only female fans are invited to attend the clinic where football coaches and players discuss the X&#x27;s and O&#x27;s with fans who want to understand the game better. All attendees get a tour of the football facilities, and finish the day running onto the football field through the players&#x27; tunnel accompanied by artificial smoke and theme music in the same way the team does during the season. The event was hosted by Spurrier and his wife Jerri.

==== Orlando Apollos (2019) ====
In April 2018, Spurrier was named the head coach of the Orlando Apollos of the Alliance of American Football (AAF), a new spring football league that was slated to begin play in February 2019. Spurrier was the first coach or player to sign with the AAF, as he thought the four to five month per year commitment made the new league a &quot;perfect job&quot; for him to get back into coaching, giving him an opportunity to finish his career on another winning note – &quot;It&#x27;s a mulligan in life,&quot; he explained.

The AAF did not finish the season due to league-wide financial difficulties. The Apollos led the standings with a 7–1 record when the league shut down, leading Spurrier to claim that they should be named the first and only AAF &quot;regular season champions&quot;.

==After coaching==

In July 2016, Spurrier returned to the University of Florida to serve as an ambassador and consultant for the athletic program. On September 3, 2016, the field at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium was renamed to &quot;Steve Spurrier-Florida Field at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium&quot; in honor of Spurrier&#x27;s achievements at the university. On June 7, 2016, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley inducted Spurrier into the Order of the Palmetto, the highest honor of the South Carolina government. On July 22, 2021, Steve Spurrier was inducted into the South Carolina Football Hall of Fame.

Since retiring from coaching, Spurrier has been a frequent contributor to sports talk shows on TV, radio, and podcasts, including his own show on SiriusXM Satellite Radio, co-hosting shows on WRUF radio in Gainesville, and appearing on many other shows.

In 2021, Spurrier opened Spurrier&#x27;s Gridiron Grill in the Celebration Pointe entertainment complex in Gainesville. The establishment is a sports bar / restaurant that features large displays of memorabilia from throughout Spurrier&#x27;s playing and coaching career, including his Heisman Trophy.

== Personal life ==
Spurrier married his college sweetheart, the former Jerri Starr, on September 14, 1966, during his senior year at the University of Florida. They have four children — Lisa, Amy, Steve Jr., and Scott, as well as 14 grandchildren. Spurrier&#x27;s oldest son, Steve Spurrier Jr., has been an assistant football coach for several years, including stints as a receivers coach on his father&#x27;s staffs in Washington and South Carolina. After his father retired in 2015, Steve Jr. joined Bob Stoops&#x27;s staff at Oklahoma. Spurrier&#x27;s youngest son, Scott, played wide receiver for the Gamecocks through the 2009 season. Scott eventually joined his father as tight ends coach of the Orlando Apollos.

While he was a University of Florida student, Spurrier was a member of Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity (Alpha Omega chapter), and was inducted into the University of Florida Hall of Fame, the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame, and Florida Blue Key leadership honorary. As a coach, he was inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa at the University of Florida in 1991.

<doc id="1009795" wikidata="Q2425480" url="?curid=1009795" title="Kumina">
<text>Kumina is an Afro-Jamaican religion, dance and music form. Kumina has practices that include secular ceremonies, dance and music that developed from the beliefs and traditions brought to the island by Kongo enslaved people and indentured labourers, from the Congo region of West Central Africa, during the post-emancipation era. It is mostly associated with the parish of St. Thomas in the east of the island. However, the practice spread to the parishes of Portland, St. Mary and St. Catherine, and the city of Kingston.

Kumina also gives it name to a drumming style, developed from the music that accompanied the spiritual ceremonies, that evolved in urban Kingston. The Kumina drumming style has a great influence on Rastafari music, especially the Nyabinghi drumming, and Jamaican popular music. Count Ossie was a notable pioneer of the drumming style in popular music and it continues to have a significant influence on contemporary genres such as reggae and dancehall.

The &quot;Kumina riddim&quot; is a dancehall riddim produced by Sly &amp; Robbie in 2002. It has featured in recordings of over 20 artists including Chaka Demus &amp; Pliers and Tanya Stephens.

==Definition==

Kumina is an Afro-Jamaican Religion and is not the same as Pukkumina or Pocomania.

==History==

Kumina emerged through the practices of indentured labourers who were brought to Jamaica from the Kongo region of central Africa after the abolition of slavery.
In the second half of the 19th century it syncretised with Myalism.
Kumina differed from Zion Revivalism in rejecting the belief that the Bible should be the central authority behind worship.

==Beliefs and practices==

The practices of Kumina are primarily linked to healing. Healing ceremonies utilise singing, dancing, drumming, animal sacrifice, and spirit possession, with the intent of summoning spirits to heal the sick individual. These elements are also found in Myalism and Zion Revivalism.

==Organization==
Organization of Kumina communities follows the general local character of African religions in Jamaica. Kumina communities are small family based communities or nations. Some nations include &quot;Mondongo&quot;, &quot;Moyenge&quot;, &quot;Machunde&quot;, &quot;Kongo&quot;, &quot;Igbo&quot;, and &quot;Yoruba&quot;. People from Kumina families are given the title &quot;Bongo&quot;. Marrying into a Bongo family is one avenue to become a part of a Kumina nation; special initiation is the other avenue. Kumina nations are led by a &quot;King&quot; and &quot;Queen&quot;. Imogene &quot;Queenie&quot; Kennedy AKA Queenie III (c1920-1998) was a well-known Kumina Queen in the 20th century, born in St Thomas in the late 1920s she later moved to Kingston and then Waterloo, St Catherine.

==Influence on Rastafari==

The use of cannabis or ganja in Kumina may have been an influence on the adoption of this plant as a sacrament in Rastafari, a religion that developed in Jamaica during the 1930s.

<text>The Seven Early Songs (&quot;Sieben frühe Lieder&quot;) (c. 1905 – 1908), are early compositions of Alban Berg, written while he was under the tutelage of Arnold Schoenberg. They are an interesting synthesis combining Berg&#x27;s heritage of pre-Schoenberg song writing with the rigour and undeniable influence of Schoenberg. The writing very much carries with it the heritage of Richard Strauss (although the influences of a number of other composers can be discerned – Robert Schumann, Gustav Mahler, and Hugo Wolf for example, as well as Claude Debussy&#x27;s harmonic palette in evidence in &quot;Nacht&quot;), through the expansiveness of gesture and &#x27;opening of new vistas,&#x27; and that of Richard Wagner.

<text>Ma Liang (187–222), courtesy name Jichang, was an official serving under the warlord Liu Bei during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. Since he was young, Ma Liang was famous for his exceptional talent, with Chen Shou describing him as one of Shu&#x27;s best officials. However, he was killed in battle at the age of 35 years during the Battle of Xiaoting. He served in the state of Shu Han as one of the founding emperor Liu Bei&#x27;s Palace Attendants during the early Three Kingdoms period and was the elder brother of Ma Su.

==Life==
Ma Liang was born in Yicheng County (), Xiangyang, which is present-day Yicheng, Hubei. He had four brothers, all of them well known as gifted individual. Ma Su was one of them. However, Ma Liang was esteemed as the most talented. He had white strands of hair in his eyebrows. There was a saying in Ma Liang&#x27;s hometown to describe him and his brothers: &quot;Of the Five Changs (五常) in the Ma family, White Eyebrows (白眉) is the most &quot;liang&quot;.&quot;

Around 209, when the warlord Liu Bei took charge of Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan) after the death of its Inspector (), Liu Qi, he recruited Ma Liang to serve as an Assistant Officer () under him. Later in 211, when Liu Bei left Jing Province for an expedition in Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing), Ma Liang remained behind in Jing Province. Ma Liang was a close friend of Liu Bei&#x27;s strategist Zhuge Liang and they were sworn brothers.

He once wrote a letter to Zhuge Liang, who was in Yi Province at the time, to praise and encourage him. The letter was written as such: 

Zhuge Liang was happy to receive those words from Ma Liang and cherished them as they shared a close bond.

Following Liu Bei&#x27;s takeover of Yi Province, Ma Liang was promoted to the position of a Senior Clerk () in the office of the General of the Left ().

Ma Liang was later appointed as an emissary to meet the warlord Sun Quan, Liu Bei&#x27;s ally. Before his mission to Wu, Ma Liang spoke to Zhuge Liang: &quot;Now that I&#x27;m sent by the state with the mission to bring harmony and friendship between our two nations. May I have the chance to be introduced by you to General Sun Quan?&quot; Zhuge Liang answered: &quot;You ought to try writing something yourself.&quot; And so Ma Liang wrote a draft that said: &quot;Our wise lord send his advisor Ma Liang to convey respects, bring gifts and extend prosperity to our friendship thereby continue on the praiseworthy legacy of Kunwu (昆吾) and Shiwei (豕韋). I&#x27;m a fortunate man of some talent from Jing and Chu region. Rarely, I&#x27;m rash in action and yet I have the virtue of seeing matters through to the end. With a calm heart, I turn my head toward you hoping you deign to accept me and give me assistance so I can accomplish my mission.&quot; Sun Quan received and treated Ma Liang very respectfully.

In 221, after the collapse of the Eastern Han dynasty, Liu Bei declared himself emperor and established the state of Shu Han. Ma Liang was appointed as a Palace Attendant () in Shu. Later that year, Liu Bei launched a campaign against Sun Quan, leading to the Battle of Xiaoting. Ma Liang was tasked with persuading the tribal peoples in Wuling (武陵; around present-day Wuling District, Changde, Hunan) to join Liu Bei and he succeeded in his mission. The army&#x27;s advance until they arrived at Xiaoting in Yidao, from there Liu Bei extended his camps closely linked to each other. While Ma Liang following the road to Wuling was further sent to oversee and manage the affairs of the Yi and Man tribes that previously joined Liu Bei. Liu Bei was eventually defeated by Sun Quan&#x27;s general Lu Xun at the Battle of Xiaoting in 222 and Ma Liang was killed in action. Later, after he managed to retreat to Baidicheng (in present-day Fengjie County, Chongqing) safely, Liu Bei appointed Ma Liang&#x27;s son, Ma Bing (), as a Cavalry Commandant ().

==Appraisal==

Chen Shou, who wrote Ma Liang&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (&quot;Sanguozhi&quot;), appraised Ma Liang as follows: &quot;Ma Liang was incorruptible, honest and was praised as an outstanding elite. He was worthy to be called a &quot;lingshi&quot; (令士; a virtuous scholarly gentleman)... Along with Dong He, Liu Ba, Chen Zhen and Dong Yun, he was one of the best officials in Shu.&quot;

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
Ma Liang is a minor character in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, He joined Liu Bei under Yi Ji&#x27;s recommendation along with his younger brother Ma Su. Then, he advised Liu Bei to have Liu Qi appointed as Governor of Jing Province to satisfy the people while he would conquer the southern Commanderies. During the conquest of Yi, he stayed behind and acted as Guan Yu&#x27;s main civil advisor mostly as a voice of reason during the negotiation with Wu and playing weiqi against Guan Yu during Hua Tuo&#x27;s famous operation.

<text>André Maginot (; ; 17 February 1877 – 7 January 1932) was a French civil servant, soldier and Member of Parliament. He is best known for his advocacy of the string of forts known as the Maginot Line.

== Early life ==
Maginot was born and grew up in Paris but spent extended vacations in Revigny-sur-Ornain, the village of his forebears, which was in the part of Lorraine that had not in 1871 been annexed to Germany. After taking the civil service exam in 1897, Maginot began a career in the French bureaucracy that would last the rest of his life. He worked as the assistant of the Governor-General in Algeria until 1910, when he resigned and began his political career. He was elected to the French Chamber of Deputies that year and served as Under-Secretary of State for War prior to the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.

When the war began, Maginot enlisted in the army and was posted along the Lorraine front. In November 1914, Maginot, who had been promoted to sergeant for his &quot;coolness and courage&quot;, was wounded in the leg near Verdun, and he would walk with a limp for the rest of his life. For extreme valour, he was awarded the Médaille militaire. He was also a fencer.

== Development of Maginot Line ==
Later in the war, Maginot returned to the Chamber of Deputies and served in a number of government posts, including Minister of Overseas France (20 March 1917 – 12 September 1917, 11 November 1928 – 3 November 1929), Minister of Pensions starting in 1920 and Minister of War (1922–1924, 1929–1930, 1931–1932). He believed that the Treaty of Versailles did not provide France with sufficient security. He pushed for more funds for defence and grew more distrustful of Germany although few in France then wanted to think about the possibility of another war.

Maginot came to advocate building a series of defensive fortifications along the French border with Germany that would include a combination of field positions and permanent concrete forts. He was influenced in that decision by his observations of successful fortifications employed at Verdun during the war. He was also probably influenced by the destruction of his home in Revigny-sur-Ornain, which made him determined to prevent Lorraine from ever being invaded again.

In 1926 Maginot was successful in getting the government to allocate money to build several experimental sections of the defensive line. During a debate concerning the budget in 1926, André Maginot lobbied heavily for the money needed to construct the enormous line of fortifications. He was finally able to persuade Parliament to allocate 3.3 billion francs for the project (the upper house voted 274 to 26 in favor of the project a few days later).

Work on the project progressed rapidly. Maginot visited a work site in October 1930 and expressed satisfaction with the work. He was especially pleased with the work in Lorraine, site of the home where he spent his childhood, and fought for more funding for construction in that area. Maginot was the main proponent for the project, but most of the actual designs for the Maginot Line were the work of the Minister of War for most of 1926 to 1929, Paul Painlevé.

==Death and legacy==

Maginot never saw the line completed, since he became ill in December 1931 and died in Paris on 7 January 1932 of typhoid fever. Many people mourned him throughout France, and it was only after his death that the line of defences that he had advocated came to bear his name.

During the Second World War, Germany bypassed the line by passing Panzers through hills and marshlands, which were impenetrable to tanks when Maginot had made his recommendations.

A monument in memory of Maginot was dedicated near Verdun in September 1966.

== Quote ==
We could hardly dream of building a kind of Great Wall of France, which would in any case be far too costly. Instead we have foreseen powerful but flexible means of organizing defense, based on the dual principle of taking full advantage of the terrain and establishing a continuous line of fire everywhere.
:–10 December 1929

They typically contain stuffed toys or other cheap prizes, and sometimes contain more expensive items like electronic devices and fashion accessories. Claw machines are also known as skill cranes, claw cranes, crane games, teddy pickers, and are known as UFO catchers in Japan due to the claws&#x27; resemblance to UFOs.

The earliest claw machines are believed to have been created in the late 19th century and inspired by the machines used to build the Panama Canal, while the first patented claw machine, the Erie Digger, was inspired by the creation of the Erie Canal and invented in 1926. It and its successor, the Miami Digger, were popular throughout the United States during the 1930s, specifically during the Great Depression, as carnival attractions and as furniture in public places. By the 1980s, claw machines were ubiquitous in both the United States and Japan; the success of Sega&#x27;s &quot;UFO Catcher&quot; machines in the 1980s and 1990s inspired a claw machine craze in the latter country. Claw machines have made appearances in numerous video games, music videos, films, and television shows since at least the 1990s.

In the late 2010s, claw machines became immensely popular in South Korea and Taiwan as cheap entertainment due to their slowing economies at the time, with the number of claw machine arcades in both places rising into the thousands. Also in the 2010s, claw machines that could be remotely controlled via mobile applications or websites began turning up online.

Claw machines are often rigged to modify the claw&#x27;s strength on each turn, and are consequently considered gambling devices in some jurisdictions.

==Early history==
Claw machines are believed to have originated in the United States in the 1890s, when they were made to resemble the machines that built the Panama Canal. The first patented claw machine, the Erie Digger, was a glass box containing candy and other small objects, a chute, and a coin-operated miniature steam shovel that moved in an arc, could be moved with a handle, and could be lifted and dropped into the chute using a hand crank. It was invented in 1926, manufactured by the Erie Manufacturing Company, and named after the construction of the Erie Canal. It found success at carnivals, partially because it did not require electricity like other carnival attractions. Throughout the 1930s, it saw use as furniture in train stations, hotels, drugstores, cigar stores, and bus stations, where it was used to keep customers entertained. During the Great Depression, designing intricate, Art Deco claw machines for hotels and stores became a lucrative endeavor. 

The Miami Digger, invented by American carnival operator William Bartlett of Miami and patented by him in 1932, improved upon the design of the Erie Digger by using an electric motor and allowing the crane to move around the entire box. It was also known as the Nickel Digger, as it contained money, such as nickels and silver dollars, as prizes; premium versions of the diggers had watches and cigarette lighters as prizes for adults. Bartlett became rich from the popularity of the machines and died in 1948.

==Global popularity==
===In Asia===
Japanese companies Sega and Taito began designing trolley-style claw machines in the 1960s. They gained popularity in Japan during the late 1970s, with crane games ranking among Japan&#x27;s top ten highest-grossing electro-mechanical (EM) arcade games of 1977 and 1978. Sega released their &quot;UFO Catcher&quot; claw machine in 1985 and made their first shipment of it in 1986. It had sold 10,000 cabinets by 1991, its popularity inspiring Sega&#x27;s creation of the &quot;Dream Catcher&quot; in 1989 and the &quot;New UFO Catcher&quot; in 1991 while making the &quot;UFO Catcher&quot; series responsible for 90 percent of stuffed toy claw machine sales. By 1994, its claw could be changed to fit the sizes and shapes of different prizes, and it had become a craze across Japan: arcades started dedicating entire floors to &quot;UFO Catcher&quot; cabinets—of which Sega had sold over 40,000, making it Sega&#x27;s best-selling game at the time—and the term &quot;UFO catcher&quot; became synonymous with crane games in Japan.

Sega Shinjuku Kabukicho, a two-story Sega arcade in Shinjuku, Tokyo containing 477 claw machines, received the Guinness World Record for having the most claw machines in a single venue in 2021, a record previously held by the Taito Station in Fuchū, Tokyo for having 454 machines. , Yuka Nakajima of Japan holds the Guinness World Record for being the most successful claw machine player due to winning more than 3,500 Rilakkuma teddy bears from claw machines. In 2021, claw machines accounted for more than half of the revenue at Japanese arcades, according to the Japan Amusement Industry Association. Japanese claw machines can also contain cakes as prizes.

The number of claw machine arcades and the popularity of claw machines both experienced a sharp increase in South Korea in 2016 and 2017, specifically in Seoul neighborhoods with universities like Hongdae and Sinchon. From 2015 to 2017, the number of South Korean claw arcades increased from 20 to 1,900, while mentions of claw machines on Korean social networks also increased during that time. &quot;Korea JoongAng Daily&quot; and &quot;The Korea Herald&quot; attributed the increased interest to South Korea&#x27;s harsh economy at the time leading to a desire for cheap entertainment, while &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; associated it with the country&#x27;s increasing youth unemployment.

In Taiwan, where claw machine arcades are usually open all day and owners sublet their machines to different operators, claw machines became especially popular as inexpensive entertainment starting in 2017, due to their costing NT$10 to use. The number of claw machine arcades in Taiwan increased from 920 in 2016 to 3,353 in 2018 and, , there are more than 10,000. A 2018 survey of children aged seven to 18 reported 32.7 percent of them using claw machines one to three days a week and over four percent using them every day. The Central Bank of the Republic of China increased their budget in 2019 to produce more NT$10 coins to accommodate the increasing popularity of claw machines in Taiwan. By 2018, the average monthly revenue for operating a claw machine was around NT$5,000. 

The largest claw machine arcade in China, LJJ Station in Beijing, has more than 60 machines with stuffed toy versions of characters from WeChat animations. Before 2020, claw machines were popular in Thai shopping malls; a 2020 survey conducted by the advocacy group No Gambling Youth Club stated that 75 of the 92 shopping malls surveyed contained 1,300 claw machines collectively.

===United States===
In the United States, claw machines became ubiquitous in the 1980s. They are common at carnivals, grocery stores, shopping malls, arcades, amusement parks, and bowling alleys. The world&#x27;s largest claw machine, according to Guinness World Records, is a 17 by 8 by 12 feet machine designed by the Dayton, Ohio-based creative agency Real Art and opened in 2014.

There were many instances of children getting stuck inside of claw machines in the United States throughout the 2010s, including in Tennessee, New York, Kentucky, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Texas.

===Online and in popular culture===
Online claw machines are claw machines controlled remotely online, with prizes that get shipped to users&#x27; homes upon being won. Since the 2010s, mobile apps, such as &quot;Clawee&quot; in Israel and &quot;Sega Catcher Online&quot; in Japan, and websites, such as &quot;Netch&quot; in Japan and the Santa Claw in the United States, have allowed users to remotely use claw machines stored in warehouses in their respective countries.

The 1993 Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) video game &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot; includes a minigame based on the &quot;UFO Catcher&quot;, while the 1998 PlayStation game &quot;Bomberman World&quot; has a UFO catcher-themed battle stage. Sega&#x27;s 2005 video game &quot;Yakuza&quot; and its sequels &quot;Yakuza 0&quot; and &quot;Yakuza Kiwami&quot; also feature &quot;UFO Catcher&quot; machines. The 2019 video game &quot;Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot; includes a claw machine as a side activity. In the 1995 film &quot;Toy Story&quot;, Buzz Lightyear and Sheriff Woody climb into a claw vending machine filled with claw-worshipping aliens. In the &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; episode &quot;Skill Crane&quot; from its fourth season, Squidward becomes addicted to trying to win a prize from a claw machine. Claw machines have also been featured in the music videos for Delta Heavy&#x27;s 2019 song &quot;Take Me Home&quot;, Corpsegrinder&#x27;s 2022 song &quot;Bottom Dweller&quot;, and the City Girls&#x27; 2022 song &quot;Good Love&quot;.

==Legality==
===North America===
The passing of the Johnson Act by Congress in 1951, which prohibited the transfer of electronic gambling devices across state lines, led to Miami Diggers at carnivals being destroyed by operators or seized by government officials. Carnival owner Lee Moss organized other carnival owners together to protest against the classification of the diggers as gambling machines. Because of this, a compromise was soon reached that allowed carnival owners to keep the diggers but required them to be manually operated with no coin slot and prizes that were not money and worth one dollar or less, while the government would tax each machine US$10. Regulations loosened in 1973 due to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) abandoning the Johnson Act. , state regulations generally require that claw machines contain less valuable prizes. Most states exempt claw machines from their gambling laws.

In California, claw machines are considered slot machines and their ownership and operation are prohibited by Penal Code Section 330b.

In New Jersey, claw machines are regulated by the Legalized Games of Chance Control Commission. In 2016, New Jersey Senator Nicholas Scutari proposed legislation that would add specifications to prevent claw machines from being unwinnable. In response to a spate of lawsuits against California claw game operators, attorney Bob Snyder advised claw machine owners to avoid using the word &quot;skill&quot; in the game description decal present on most machines.

In other jurisdictions, such as Alberta, Canada, skill cranes are illegal unless the player is allowed to make repeated attempts (on a single credit) until he or she wins a prize. Skill cranes in single-play mode (where the player has only one chance per credit to try for a prize) were found by the Ontario Court of Appeal to be essentially games of chance, and therefore prohibited except at fairs or exhibitions, where they are covered by an exemption.

===Asia===
Claw machines were outlawed in Thailand after being classified as gambling devices by the Supreme Court of Thailand in 2004, though, until 2019, laws prohibiting their use were rarely enforced. In 2020, the Ministry of Interior in Thailand ordered a nationwide ban on claw machines after activists protested against their widespread availability. However, the public prosecutor of Chiang Mai ruled in 2022 that claw machines were vending machines rather than gambling machines and were therefore legal. South Korean law dictates that claw machines cannot carry prizes worth over ₩5,000 to prevent addiction. An investigation by South Korea&#x27;s Game Rating and Administration Committee in 2017 found that the majority of claw machines they randomly inspected broke Korean law. The Consumer Protection Committee of the Executive Yuan stated in 2019 that their investigation of claw machines in Taoyuan, New Taipei City, Kaohsiung, Taipei City, Tainan, and Taichung found that 70 percent of them contained illegal adult products such as vibrators and e-cigarettes. In 2021, the Ministry of Home Affairs in Singapore proposed capping the value of prizes in claw machines at S$100 in order to, according to them, &quot;address the inducement effect of high-value prizes, without increasing the regulatory burden on operators&quot;. In March 2024, Brunei has banned claw machines as they have been deemed &quot;haram&quot; due to its gambling elements.

==Chances of winning==
Since the 1920s, advertising for claw machines has suggested that they are able to be won completely through strategy and skill. Claw machines can be set to give players a chance of winning during every paid turn if they use a &quot;Play Till Win&quot; setting. Settings like claw strength—which is controlled by the amount of voltage sent to a claw—and &quot;dropping skill&quot;—the ability of a claw to drop a prize back into the machine after picking it up—are frequently modified by arcade owners to control the odds of a player winning and are often based on how much money the machine has earned. Claw machine strength-control has been reported in the United States, South Africa, South Korea, and Singapore.

On social media platforms such as TikTok and YouTube, videos of people using claw machines and offering modifications for how to get prizes from them were popular in the 2010s and 2020s. A 2015 report by &quot;Vox&quot;″s Phil Edwards describing how claw machines were often rigged went viral online and became controversial among claw machine enthusiasts. A 2016 report by Jeff Rossen for the American TV program &quot;Today&quot; showing the same thing prompted the American Amusement Machine Association, which represents arcade game manufacturers across the United States, to make their members sign a &quot;Fair Play Pledge&quot; in 2017 that required their machines to be winnable through skill alone. The 2021 book &quot;How to Beat the Claw Machine: Tips and Tricks to Help You Win Big&quot;, written by American arcade owner Brian McKanna, offers tips on how to win prizes at claw machines, which he described as &quot;absolutely rigged&quot;.

According to a 2023 report by News24, most claw machines in South Africa can be set to only allow players to win if the machine has earned a certain amount of money. A manual for the Intelligrab operating system, made by Belgian manufacturer Elaut, encourages claw machine owners to create the illusion that the player almost won the prize, and owners can adjust machines&#x27; claw strength per turn.

<text>A random-access channel (RACH) is a shared channel used by wireless terminals to access the mobile network (TDMA/FDMA, and CDMA based network) for call set-up and bursty data transmission. Whenever mobile wants to make an MO (Mobile Originating) call it schedules the RACH. RACH is transport-layer channel; the corresponding physical-layer channel is PRACH. 

==RACH for GSM standard==
Since RACH is shared, there is a probability that two or more mobiles transmit at the same time and their transmissions collide in the medium (air) and they will not be granted access to the network. This happens because limit for number of mobiles transmitting in one RACH time slot is not defined in the GSM standard. If collision happens then mobile waits for random period of time and transmits the RACH again. RACH uses GSM 51 frame multiframe structure in the uplink to transmit information. Mostly TS1 is used but in high capacity GSM cell areas, TS2, TS4 and TS6 is also used for RACH leaving TS0 (mainly used for broadcast frequency). 

A random-access channel like that of mobile phone networks is also used in the OpenAirMesh network, between cluster heads and mesh routers.

A key feature of a random-access channel is that messages are not scheduled (compared to, for example, a &quot;dedicated channel&quot; in UMTS, which is assigned exclusively to one user at a time). There is no certainty that only a single device makes a connection attempt at one time, so collisions can result.

<text>The Laird LC-DW300 and LC-DW500 Super Solution aka &quot;Sky Buzzard&quot; was a racing biplane built in the early 1930s by Matty Laird for the Cleveland Speed Foundation, Laird was already famous in the air racing circuit. It had a large radial engine and an extremely faired windshield. Other than being a biplane, it was similar in appearance to the Gee Bee, a more famous racer from the period. It was an advanced design for the time because of the relatively clean aerodynamic construction and tight engine cowling.

The Super Solution was the first winner of the Bendix Trophy race from Burbank to Cleveland where it was flown by Maj. James H. Doolittle.

==Development==
Construction of the Super Solution started on 8 July 1931. The aircraft was complete and test flown at Ashborn Field in Chicago by 22 August 1931. Further changes were made by the Christopher Bros. in Wichita, Kansas in 1932, such as raising the seat, installing a sliding canopy, and adding retractable landing gear.

==Design==
Two engines were used in the Solution, the second being a geared variant that allowed a lower propeller rpm with a larger propeller. The engines ran with high-compression pistons and &quot;doped&quot; leaded fuel. Both produced over 500 hp from the standard 375 hp P&amp;W R-985 Wasp Jr. S2A engine of the day.

==Operational history==
Initial flight tests proved the aircraft required more rudder area to maintain stability and the fixed pitch propeller needed to be adjusted to allow takeoffs under a mile in length.

*1931 National Air Races piloted by Jimmy Doolittle wins the Bendix Trophy at a 223 mph average speed.
*1931 Thompson Trophy - Trial runs prove difficult, with aileron reversal occurring at speed. The main wing spar crushed from race loads, requires steel patches. Doolittle drops out of the race with engine trouble due to a scuffed piston.
*1931 In October, Doolittle flies the Super Solution on a flight between Ottawa, Ontario, Washington D.C., and Mexico City, setting a new speed record between the capitals of 12 hours, 36 minutes.
*1932 In August, the Shell Oil sponsored Solution is test flown by Doolittle with new retractable gear. The aircraft is damaged in a gear-up landing, and Doolittle switches to the Gee Bee R-1. The Solution is shipped to Shell Oil in St.Louis, then later donated to the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum by the Swallow Aircraft Company in 1948.

== On display ==
*The EAA has a Super Solution replica in their museum in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. It was presented in 1981 by Jimmy Doolittle and Mattie Laird.
*Jim Moss of Washington state built the only flying reproduction, which is currently on display at Fantasy of Flight in Polk City, Florida.

<doc id="1009831" wikidata="Q3020352" url="?curid=1009831" title="On Ancient Medicine">
<text>The treatise On Ancient Medicine () is perhaps the most intriguing and compelling work of the Hippocratic Corpus. The Corpus itself is a collection of about sixty writings covering all areas of medical thought and practice. Traditionally associated with Hippocrates, (c. 460 BC – c. 370 BC) the father of Western medicine, philological evidence now suggests that it was written over a period of several centuries and stylistically seems to indicate that it was the product of many authors dating from about 450–400 B.C.

== Hippocrates ==
Hippocrates was born circa 460 BCE on the island of Cos in Greece. Hippocrates was looked at as a teacher and physician. His name is in around sixty medical articles, most of these medical articles were not written by him. He is admired for his high standards of moral conduct in the practice of medicine, especially for the Hippocratic Oath, which was also written by someone else. Hippocrates later dies circa 375 BCE in Larissa, Thessaly.

==Hippocratic Corpus: structure==
On the basis of its diverse arguments regarding the nature of medical therapeutics, the Hippocratic Corpus could be divided into four divisions or groups.

Group I: The humoral theory of medicine proposed that our bodies were made up of diverse fluids, elements, or powers, that were considered to be the basic units or fundamental building blocks of all nature. Whereas, a more simplified and categorized version of this theory is usually associated with the four humors of black bile, blood, phlegm and yellow bile, the humoral theory as presented in Group I of the Hippocratic Corpus is never structured or schematized. Its approach to understanding the diverse cause of illnesses and their cures is empirical in nature.

It therefore, takes a more holistic view of the human organism which defines simple categorization of disease causality and treatment or cure. It places emphasis on &quot;physis&quot; (nature) or unitary vital force of the organism by which the physician must be guided. It is the self-healing powers of the human organism, the inner physician, which must always be consulted in the diagnosis and treatment of sickness. The interaction of the humors within man must always be seen in this light. Indeed, this group viewed the human organism as being composed of an infinite number of humors and that disease consists in the isolation of one of these humors within the organism leading to an imbalance which must be cured through coction of this humor, a process leading to the restoration of balance.

Group II: The proponents of this group argue that in addition to cure through coction and evacuation may be added the therapeutic approach of treatment of sickness through the administration of contraries. This could be in the form of dietary prescription but also medicinal substances. Medicinal substances are chosen on the basis of their indwelling powers or virtues, a method of analysis also applied in the diagnosis of disease in relation to the human organism.

Group III: This group utilizes an analytical approach to the diagnosis and treatment of sickness. It relies on the formation of hypotheses based on systematized views of the humoral activity and their corresponding treatments. Its medical theory could be described as rational versus empirical. Diseases and their causes are categorized as are their respective remedies. It places emphasis on cure by contraries and largely ignores the concept of the self-healing capacity of the organism. The organism and its environment are analyzed in terms of hypothesized causal processes. Treatment consists in opposing the humor, quality or power causing the disease by administering a remedy of opposite quality.

Group IV: This group according to Harris Coulter, &quot;Consists of two works: Ancient Medicine and The Art. These two works provide analysis and critique of the therapeutic doctrine of Group three. The idea of cure through opposition between qualities is rejected, and a philosophical justification is given for the ideas underlying the works of Group 1.&quot;

== Ancient Medicine in Greece ==
The medical practice of Hippocrates used natural aspects to treat diseases. The Hippocratic teachings on the value of knowing a patient&#x27;s health, independence of thought, and the necessity for balance between the individuals, the social environment, and the natural environment. These foundations of health were incorporated in Ancient Greece to help discover the source of illness and to help promote health. 

To maintain health, Ancient Greeks followed the belief that physical and mental health work together. Aristotle believed that the best way to achieve harmony between the mind and body is to participate in sports and gymnastics. It has been suggested that sessions of aerobics, for example walking, will help to boost cognitive attention control in children. Data suggests that exercise improves scholastic performance.

To enhance both physical and mental health, physical movement was an essential component of academic learning. Special services were offered by teachers known as &quot;paidotrivai&quot; during the Olympic Games. According to a study by Hippocrates, olive oil was used to warm up, increase body temperature, and become more flexible, and athletes were given figs as well as other fruits containing high glucose concentrations to help them perform better. 

== Trauma, Therapy and Interventions ==
Up until the Middle Ages, Hippocrates and Galen had quite an impact on surgical treatment procedures for wounds and injuries. For instance, Hippocrates identified the splitting of limb gangrene and treated the ailment by making incisions between the dead and the living tissue.  He thought that after treating the wounds with pure water or wine, they needed to be kept dry in order to heal correctly and rapidly. Also, he thought that the development of pus contributed to the decrease of wound complications. These discoveries influenced surgical treatment procedures for wounds and injuries up to the Middle Ages. 

The earliest taxonomy of mental illnesses was proposed by Hippocrates, and it included mania, melancholy, phrenitis, insanity, disobedience, paranoia, panic, epilepsy, and hysteria. He held that intellect and sensitivity enter the brain through the lips by breathing and that the brain is the primary organ responsible for mental diseases. He held that the four fluids blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile as well as observation, study of the reasons, balance of theory, and the four liquids themselves form the basis for the diagnosis and treatment of both physical and mental illnesses. According to Plato&#x27;s view, there are two possible ways to repair the body and the soul. While medicine and gymnastics are seen as legitimate remedies, the legislative and judicial systems are necessary for true soul healing. The betterment of human conduct and the treatment of both mental and physical diseases depended heavily on music and theater. It was thought that using music to heal the spirit also treated the body, along with particular musical treatments for particular illnesses. The first person to use music as treatment to overcome pain was Asclepius. According to Aristotle, religious music that uplifts the spirit has a similar impact on individuals who have undergone therapy and mental catharsis. &quot;Catharsis,&quot; or the letting go of emotions via performance, took place in the Theater of Epidaurus in the Ancient Temple of Epidaurus. 

==Hippocratic Corpus: origins==
The origins of the Hippocratic Corpus can be traced in the sixth and fifth centuries B.C. in Italy. There were two seminal schools of Western medical thought; there was Agrigentum on the southern coast of Sicily and Croton on the west coast of the Gulf of Taranto. Agrigentum was the home of Empedocles, while Croton harbored the Pythagorean sect of medical philosophy. The school of Agrigentum and Empedocles placed great emphasis on cure by contraries and thus should be associated with Group III of the Hippocratic Corpus. The school of Croton rejected the notion of cure by contraries while championing the medical philosophy that perceived the human organism consists of an infinite number of humors. The arguments of this group should be identified with Group IV of the Hippocratic Corpus.

The first medical philosopher of the school of Croton was Alcmaeon of Croton. Alcmaeon argued that the maintenance of good health required a balance of the powers of moist and dry, cold and hot, bitter and sweet. Sickness arises when there is an imbalance within the human organism caused by the predominance of one power over another. In the Agrigentum school of thought Empedocles hypothesized that the universe consisted of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire. On the basis of these four elements he sought to account for the origin of matter. Matter or the universe was generated out of these four elements and their mutual attraction and repulsion. The conflict between these two schools of thought became manifest in their medical philosophies. Whereas, Alcmaeon argued that there were indefinite number of diverse qualities that made up the human organism, Empedocles contended that there were four concrete or substantial elements. Whereas it is Empedocles&#x27; medical philosophy that ultimately inspires the humoral doctrine of human nature, it is Alcmaeon&#x27;s theory that underpins the medical therapeutic doctrine proposed in &quot;On Ancient Medicine&quot; (Group IV). Alcmaeon&#x27;s argument that there are an infinite number of causes for disease that cannot be simply organized into categories is the basic operating assumption of empirical medicine. Therefore, medical knowledge continuously expanded thorough a firsthand experience and observation of the human organism within nature. It is in this light that &quot;On Ancient Medicine&quot; should be seen as an attempt by the advocates of the Alcmaeon and the empirical school of thought to respond to and critique the Empedoclean or humoral theory of medicine.

==&quot;On Ancient Medicine&quot;==
The basic arguments of &quot;On Ancient Medicine&quot; have three components. In chapters 1–19 the author responds to the supporters of the hypothesis theory of medicine. In so doing he argues that the exploration of medicine itself reveals the human organism as a blend of diverse substances or humors. Having set forth this humoral theory, he then critiques the hypothesis theory proposed by his opponents as being an oversimplified conception of the cause of disease. Against this backdrop, he discusses his own theory and method he employed in its discovery (chaps. 20–24). He then responds to the charge that ancient medicine is not a genuine medical art because it has limited accuracy. These arguments must be seen in the light of the author&#x27;s theory of human physiology (chaps. 9–12).

===Chapters 1–19===
The author is responding to the supporters of the hypothesis theory by arguing that medicine has a systematic character to qualify it as a tekhne (art, craft or science). This genuine &quot;tekhne&quot; depends on the knowledge of the physician attained through first-hand experience that enables him to both distinguish diverse treatments and to realize success in their skillful administration (1). Medicine should not proceed with hypotheses or generalizations; rather it should be rooted in experience and discovery. It should be empirical in its methodology. Hence, in chapter 2 the author argues that medicine&#x27;s principle and method enables the physician to make discoveries over a long period of time. The discipline must be flexible and receptive to new discoveries. In chapters 3–8, the author supports the claim that medicine has a method of discovery by giving an account of medicine&#x27;s origins and discoveries. He traces it back to a regimen beneficial for the sick and observes that some foods are not beneficial for either the healthy or the sick.
The author cites accounts of human beings from the fifth-century who suffered as a result of their savage diet. As a result, techniques were developed for the preparation of food best suited in producing a healthy and civilized human being. He likens it to a medical discovery (3.4-6); and as such constitutes a general &quot;tekhne&quot;. The author establishes a close methodological parallel between cooking and medicine. In cooking it is critical to recognize that human beings have a nature distinct from animals. For instance, humans are less capable of digesting raw meats. Thus, allowances must be made in the preparation and cooking of meat that best suit the human metabolism (3.5). The most common element between cooking and medicine is the mixing and blending of foods. Medicine, however, requires a greater discrimination between food types and classes of individuals so that correct nutritional needs may be identified and prescribed (5). The practitioner in the end acquires mastery of preparing foods and the ability to identify the class of individuals to whom the food is administered. In this regard, cooking and medicine are the same (chaps. 7–8).

It is in chapter 13 that the author returns to his analysis of his opponent&#x27;s hypothesis theory. His goal is to explore the potential consequences of the principle in question. The proponents of cure by contraries assume that all diseases have their roots in the humors hot, cold, wet, dry, and that the cure for each disease is the opposite of the cause. The author imagines a situation where a person changes his food from cooked to raw and as a result becomes ill. Thus, the cause of a given illness is associated with a given humor and the cure as being that humor&#x27;s opposite. Hot therefore would cure cold, and dry would be the cure for wet. The author sees this as an oversimplification. He argues that cooking is a process in which the original raw food losses some of its qualities and gains others by mixing and blending (13.3). Human beings are affected by the food they consume because every food has its own innate virtues. It is important for the physician to identify these virtues (14.1-2). The attainment of such knowledge demands a clear understanding of human nature. The human being, explains the author, contains a blend of many humors. When the humors are balanced or properly mixed the human being is healthy, but when they are unbalanced or improperly mixed and one is more concentrated than the other, pain and disease is the result (14.4-6). 
In chapter 15 the author argues that whereas the proponents of humoral medicine see food purely as hot, cold, wet, or dry, human beings also possess a quality such as sweet or bitter. These qualities are the ones that cause serious harm to the body. In Chapter 16, the author presents a number of examples from common experience. For instance, in a fever hot and cold humors counteract each other in the body without the need of medical aid. As he points out in chapter 17, however, in some cases the fever persists. This is an indication that hot is not the sole cause of the fever. There must be some other inherent factor responsible for sustaining the fever. In chapters 18 and 19, he continues to develop the idea that recovery from disease comes about when there is a blending and coction of the humors. Coction is the act or process of attaining a more perfect or more desirable condition. The importance of coction in the author&#x27;s theory also reflects his close analogy between medicine and cooking. Just as the cook brings about coction in food external to the human organism; the physician brings about coction of the bodily humors.

===Chapters 20–24===
In chapter 20 the author dismisses the theories of human nature associated with Empedocles and the pre-Socratic inquiry as irrelevant to medical practices. He argues that their theories lean towards philosophy and have more to do with the art of writing than with medicine. The author believes that the theory of human nature must be based on medicine, through the observation of the human organism within nature. He takes exception to thinkers such as Empedocles who attempted to provide such an understanding through his cosmological theories. Practically speaking, for medicine to be effective the physician needs to know the true nature of man and this must be determined through his relationship to food, drink, and other practices associated with the human organism (20.3). Therefore, the physician must understand the constituency of food and its effects on the body of the patient he is treating. In Chapters 22–24 the author extends the nature theory to include bodily structures. He also expands his theory of knowledge by advocating the use of analogies to attain an understanding of that which cannot be observed directly within the human organism.

===Chapters 9–12===
In chapters 9–12 the author argues that there is a corresponding relationship between the physician&#x27;s experience and knowledge and his ability to practice the art of medicine. The greater the general and specific knowledge attained by the physician, the more accurate his diagnostic and therapeutic skills to include preparation and administration of prescriptions or remedies. This is critical because the same illness manifests itself differently in each patient and treatment must correspond to individual symptoms, and not to the common symptoms. This also applies to dietary measures. Thus, in the preparation and administration of remedies or dietary measures, care must be given not only in selecting the quantity and quality of the preparation or remedy, but also to the timing of its administration which must take into account bodily rhythms. The physician, the author argues, must rely upon the reaction of the individual to the treatment. This is indeed a complex process which demands both the education and precision of the physician. Hippocrates argues that even if the ancient art of medicine &quot;does not possess precision in everything; rather, since it has been able to come, by means of reasoning, from profound ignorance close to perfect accuracy, I think it much more appropriate to marvel at its discoveries as having been made admirably, correctly, and not by chance&quot;.

==Date==
The dates proposed by Schiefsky for &quot;On Ancient Medicine&quot; span from 440 to around 350 BC. There are a number of considerations which strongly suggest a date in the late fifth century. That the author refers to Empedocles (490–430 B.C.) as motivation of the method he attacks suggests a date not long after his peak of activity. The author&#x27;s sense of discovery and benefits of technology are characteristic of late fifth-century thought. The idea that human beings rose through technology from savage behavior has parallels in Sophocles&#x27; fifth-century work, &quot;Antigone&quot;. Furthermore, the author&#x27;s attack on the written account of medicine by sophists as having nothing to do with the art of medicine is a discussion taken up by the fifth-century thinker Socrates in &quot;The Phaedo&quot;. Also, the treatise&#x27;s interest in &#x27;things in the sky and under the earth&#x27; also characterizes Aristophanes&#x27; &quot;Clouds&quot; (424 BC.) and Plato&#x27;s &quot;Apology&quot;.

Elizabeth Craik agrees that a date in the last few decades of the 5th century BC is plausible. She similarly argues for this conclusion on the grounds that the author alludes to Empedocles (whom Craik argues died in 423 BC) and that the use of term &quot;sophistai&quot; (&#x27;sophists&#x27;) is used dismissively but not pejoratively.

==Influence==
There are two main proponents when discussing the influences on the treatise, whether of philosophy on medicine or the reverse. Hans Diller attempted to show that the author&#x27;s point of view was influenced mostly by Plato. Ludwig Edelstein argued the author characterized &#x27;Hippocratic empiricism&#x27;, &quot;a methodological stance characterized by the rejection of all generalizations and resulting from the influence of Protagorean relativism on medical thought.&quot; The proponents for tracing influence in the opposite direction, from medicine to philosophy, argued that the work &quot;On Ancient Medicine&quot; influenced Protagoras. It is possible, however, that different thinkers could come to similar conclusions regarding natural philosophy and practice independently of one another.

==Authorship==
Since the work of Émile Littré in the nineteenth century, the treatise &quot;On Ancient Medicine&quot; has been scrutinized to aid in answering the &#x27;Hippocratic question&#x27;: the question about which of the works in the Hippocratic corpus were written by Hippocrates. Littré was the scholar most associated with advocating that &quot;On Ancient Medicine&quot; was written by Hippocrates. He thought that the treatise was the work to which Plato was referring in &quot;The Phaedrus&quot;. However, it is difficult to reconstruct the historical Hippocrates with our existing evidence amounting to a brief account in the &quot;Anonymous Londinensis&quot; papyrus, and a few references in Plato and Aristotle. Based on the information available for the treatise &quot;On Ancient Medicine&quot;, it is impossible to definitively answer the Hippocratic question.

<text>Unser Sandmännchen (&quot;Our Little Sandman&quot;), Das Sandmännchen (&quot;The Little Sandman&quot;), Der Abendgruß (&quot;The Evening-Greeting&quot;), Abendgruß (&quot;Evening-Greeting&quot;), Der Sandmann (&quot;The Sandman&quot;), Sandmann (&quot;Sandman&quot;), Sandmännchen (&quot;Little Sandman&quot;) is a German children&#x27;s bedtime television program using stop-motion animation. The puppet was based on the Ole Lukøje character by Hans Christian Andersen.

Two versions of &quot;Sandmännchen&quot; were created: one in East Germany (&quot;Unser Sandmännchen&quot;), and one in West Germany (&quot;Das Sandmännchen&quot;).

The series is the longest-running animated television series in history; additionally, it is the TV show with the most episodes in history.

== Background ==
The original idea came from , who in 1950 changed from East Berlin&#x27;s Berliner Rundfunk (BERU) to West Berlin TV and radio station Sender Freies Berlin (SFB). With the help of author Johanna Schüppel, she developed a working version of the character and its story in 1958. &quot;The Little Sandman&quot; himself first appeared on screen in West Berlin in &quot;Sandmännchens Gruß für Kinder&quot; (&quot;Sandmännchen&#x27;s Greeting to Children&quot;) on 1 December 1959, and other episodes were soon made.

However, already on 22 November 1959 (only three weeks after the production had started), East German television Deutscher Fernsehfunk (DFF) began broadcasting its own &quot;Unser Sandmännchen&quot;, complete with its own &quot;good night, children&quot; character, also called &quot;Sandmännchen&quot;.

Created by the puppetmaster and director Gerhard Behrendt, the East German show represented everyday life, travel, and fantastic adventures. The character often showcased socialist technological achievements, such as the use of awe-inspiring vehicles like futuristic cars and flying devices. It was very popular with GDR citizens to the point that after the wall fell, former citizens lamented the appropriation of the beloved cartoon by corporate West German television.

The production of the West German version of &quot;Sandmännchen&quot; ceased in 1991, following the unification of Germany. The East German version was ultimately more popular, and repeats of episodes are still broadcast today.

A full-length feature film, &quot;The Sandman and the Lost Sand of Dreams&quot; (German: &quot;Das Sandmännchen – Abenteuer im Traumland&quot;, literally &quot;The Little Sandman – Adventure[s] in Dreamland&quot;), was released in 2010.

== Theme tune ==
Wolfgang Richter composed the theme to the East German programme in just three hours one evening. Wolfgang Krumbach wrote the text. It was sung by the Rundfunk-Kinderchor Berlin.

Opening verse (on the Sandman&#x27;s arrival):
:&quot;Sandmann, lieber Sandmann, es ist noch nicht so weit! 
:Wir sehen erst den Abendgruß, ehe jedes Kind ins Bettchen muß, 
:du hast gewiß noch Zeit.&quot;

:&quot;Sandman, dear Sandman, it&#x27;s not yet time!
:First we&#x27;ll watch the &quot;Evening Greeting&quot; before every child must go to bed.
:Surely you have time for that.&quot;

There was a second verse which was dropped after the German reunification because it mentions the East German Fernsehfunk which no longer existed:

:&quot;Sandmann, lieber Sandmann, hab nur nicht solche Eil! 
:Dem Abendgruß vom Fernsehfunk lauscht jeden Abend alt und jung, 
:sei unser Gast derweil.&quot;

Translation:
:&quot;Sandman, dear Sandman, don&#x27;t be in such a rush!
:Everyone, young and old, listens to Fernsehfunk&#x27;s &quot;Evening Greeting&quot; every night.
:Please be our guest for that.&quot;

Closing verse (when he leaves):
:&quot;Kinder, liebe Kinder, das hat mir Spaß gemacht. 
:Nun schnell ins Bett und schlaft recht schön. 
:Dann will auch ich zur Ruhe gehn. Ich wünsch&#x27; euch gute Nacht.&quot;

Translation:
:&quot;Children, dear children, that was fun.
:Now, quick, to bed and sleep tight.
:Then I will also go and rest. I wish you a good night.&quot;

The score and overall design of the show was remarkably elaborate for a children&#x27;s television production. The Sandman often visited other countries, and this fact was frequently emphasised by the use of traditional instrumentation and harmony added to the score.

== International broadcasts ==
The East German show was shown in many countries, including western countries like Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Norway. The show was named &quot;Jon Blund&quot; in Norway, &quot;John Blund&quot; in Sweden and &quot;Nukkumatti&quot; in Finland.

The theme song in Norway went as follows:
:&quot;Hvem er denne karen med skjegg og lue på?
:Han ligner litt på nissen i grunn, det er ikke ham det er Jon Blund.
:Han besøker store og små.&quot;

In English, this means:
:Who is this man with a beard and a hat on?
:He looks a bit like santa actually, but it&#x27;s not him it&#x27;s Jon Blund.
:He visits children big and small.

The first verse of the theme song in Swedish was:
:&quot;Titta, kom och titta, kom sätt er här omkring.
:Det dröjer säkert ännu en stund innan sömnen kommer med John Blund.
:Han vill visa oss någonting.&quot;

In English, this means:
:&quot;Look, come look, come sit down around here.
:It will surely be a while yet before sleep comes with John Blund.
:He wants to show us something.&quot;

The theme song in Finland was:
:Nukkumatti, nukkumatti lasten, illoin kulkee, heittää unihiekkaa.
:Päivän leikit aika lopettaa on, kun TV:n iltasatu alkaa.
:Satu päättyi näin ja lapset käyvät jo nukkumaan, siis hyvää yötä.

In English, this means:
:Sandman, the children&#x27;s own Sandman, makes his rounds at night, sprinkling dream sand.
:It&#x27;s time to cease the games of the day, when the TV bedtime story begins.
:Thus ended the fairy-tale, and the children are already going to bed, so good night.

== Supporting characters ==
The Sandmännchen stories contained a number of characters who remain popular today:

*&quot;Pittiplatsch&quot;, a little round-bodied kobold, with his friends &quot;&quot;, a duck, and &quot;Moppi&quot;, a dog.
*&#x27;, a fox, and his friend &#x27;, a magpie.
*&quot;&quot;, a water sprite, and his friend &quot;Küken&quot;, a baby chicken.

== In popular culture ==
Even after German unification merged the former German Democratic Republic into the Federal Republic of Germany, the &quot;Sandmännchen&quot; has retained a following, and it continues to be shown every night on German television. Periodic references have been made to it in film and literature.

* In 2009, the band Oomph! released the single &quot;Sandmann&quot;. The song is about the child poverty in Germany and has many references to Sandmännchen.
* &quot;Unser Sandmännchen&quot; is featured in the 2003 film &quot;Good Bye, Lenin!&quot;.
* The German industrial metal band Rammstein uses the opening monologue from the West German &quot;Sandmännchen&quot;, &quot;Nun, liebe Kinder, gebt fein Acht. Ich habe euch etwas mitgebracht&quot; (&quot;Now, dear children, pay attention. I have brought you something&quot;), in the intro to their song &quot;Mein Herz brennt&quot;. The original demo version of the song was called &quot;Sandmann&quot;. In the demo version, the contents had a darker tone than the finished version. In &quot;Sandmann&quot;, a psychopath has murdered the real Sandmann, and masquerades as him.
* The Norwegian 52 minute long documentary &quot;Sandmann – Historien om en sosialistisk supermann&quot; (&quot;Sandmännchen – The History of a Socialistic Superman&quot;) by Jannicke Systad Jacobsen from 2005 looks back on the rise and fall of East German socialism through the tales of Sandmann.
* An application for iOS has been released on 11 November 2015.
* &quot;Unser Sandmännchen&quot; is the protagonist of the pop-essay &quot;La Repubblica di Sabbiolino - DDR... ma non troppo!&quot; (&quot;The Sandman Republic - DDR… but not too much!&quot;), by italian journalist Francesco Cristino published in Italy in 2020.

<text>Joseph Stephen James, of Douglasville, Georgia, was a lawyer, community leader, shape note singer, composer, and a reviser of the tunebook known as &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot;.

==Life==

Joe S. James was born March 20, 1849, in Campbell County (now in Douglas County), the son of Stephen and Martha (Shipleigh) James. He was an attorney and was active in local civic and political life. He was the first mayor of Douglasville, was instrumental in the establishment of Douglasville College, in obtaining the city&#x27;s first water and phone systems, and in bringing several industries to the city. James held membership in the Methodist Church and the Masonic Lodge. He was owner and editor of &quot;The New South&quot;, newspaper of the city of Douglasville. 

J. S. James married Margaret Elizabeth Maxwell in 1869, and they had seven children: Margaret Odessa, Stephen Edwin, Infant twin sons, Eunice Lettitia, Lois Cleveland, and Joe S., Jr. He died in 1931 and is buried in Douglasville, Georgia.

==As Sacred Harp singer and leader==

In Sacred Harp singing, J. S. James was important as a musical leader, as an author of prose works, and as a tunebook editor. His works include &quot;A Brief History of the Sacred Harp and Its Author, B. F. White, Sr., and Contributors&quot; (1904), &quot;Union Harp and History of Songs&quot; (1909), &quot;Sacred Tunes and Hymns&quot; (1913), &quot;Explanation of the Sacred Harp&quot; (1920) and, probably most important, the &quot;Original Sacred Harp&quot;. The latter tunebook was released in 1911. It added alto parts to most of the songs and restored several songs that had been deleted in the 1869-70 revision of &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot; by B. F. White and the Southern Musical Convention. James supervised the revision and was head over a revision committee appointed by the United Sacred Harp Musical Association. This edition continued a tradition that stemmed from B. F. White&#x27;s own time and in turn was extended in the so-called &quot;Denson&quot; revisions, which form the basis of the 1991 Edition, now the most widely used Sacred Harp volume. (For details of this history, see Sacred Harp.) 

James&#x27; 1911 book quickly embroiled him in two controversies. He was sued by W. M. Cooper, editor of a rival Sacred Harp edition, for plagiarism of the alto parts as written by Cooper. James brought a suit against J. L. White for White&#x27;s revision of &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot;, claiming infringement of copyright and seeking $3000 in damages.

James led in organizing the &quot;United Sacred Harp Musical Association&quot; in 1904, which he hoped would function as a sort of &quot;National Association&quot; of Sacred Harp singings and conventions.

<text>Socket 3 was a series of CPU sockets for various x86 microprocessors. It was sometimes found alongside a secondary socket designed for a math coprocessor chip, such as the 487. Socket 3 resulted from Intel&#x27;s creation of lower voltage microprocessors. An upgrade to Socket 2, it rearranged the pin layout. Socket 3 is compatible with 168-pin socket CPUs. 

Socket 3 was a 237-pin zero insertion force (ZIF) 19×19 pin grid array (PGA) socket suitable for the 3.3 V and 5 V, 25–50 MHz Intel 486 SX, 486 DX, 486 DX2, 486 DX4, 486 OverDrive and Pentium OverDrive processors as well as AMD Am486, Am5x86 and Cyrix Cx5x86 processors.

<text>Live at the Wireless is a radio show, and now a long-standing tradition, of Triple J, an Australian radio station. Live music is one of the central philosophies of the station.

The live broadcasts take a number of forms. Some broadcasts are from open-air concerts and festivals, or smaller pub gigs around the country. Many are bands that have been invited into the Triple J studios to play a live set of tracks, usually acoustic. Occasionally, Triple J will give away tickets to listeners, to allow them to be a part of a special live performance in a secret location.

All of the live broadcasts are recorded, and the station has released several double-CD compilations of live tracks. Many complete live sets are traded by music fans worldwide over the internet.

Live music is not exclusive to the &quot;Live at the Wireless&quot; segment - many other shows, including the specialty music shows, also have bands playing acoustic in the studio.

Ash have released their &quot;Live at the Wireless&quot; set from 1996 as an album - see &quot;Live at the Wireless (Ash album)&quot;.

<text>The Green Bay and Western Railroad served central Wisconsin for almost 100 years before it was absorbed into the Wisconsin Central in 1993. For much of its history the railroad was also known as the Green Bay Route. At the end of 1970 it operated 255 miles of road on 322 miles of track; that year it reported 317 million ton-miles of revenue freight.

==History==

The Green Bay and Western Railroad was formed in 1896 from the bankruptcy proceedings of the Green Bay, Winona &amp; St Paul and the Kewaunee, Green Bay and Western. The existing route, originally built by the Green Bay and Lake Pepin Railroad, linking Green Bay, Wisconsin, and East Winona, Wisconsin, formed the bulk of the new railroad. The Green Bay and Western acquired on August 1, 1906, a majority of shares/interest in the Ahnapee and Western Railway.
The GBW established in 1929 the Western Refrigerator Line Company (WRX) to operate a 500-car fleet of reefers. Passenger traffic ceased in April 1949. The Line had carried 50,000 passengers yearly in the 1870s, 310,000 in 1915 but only 1,000 in 1947 having reverted to mixed trains. The Green Bay and Western sold off the Ahnapee and Western Railway to Vernon M. Bushman and a group of private investors on May 31, 1947. The Itel Corporation purchased the Green Bay &amp; Western in 1978. The Green Bay &amp; Western and the Fox River Valley Railroad were merged into a new Wisconsin Central subsidiary, the Fox Valley and Western Railroad August 27, 1993. Wisconsin Central was, in turn, purchased by Canadian National railway in 2001.

==Main line==
* Kewaunee - Casco Junction - Green Bay. Opened - November 1891. 2015 Status - Open from Green Bay - Luxemburg. Points past that are part of the Ahnapee State Trail.
* Green Bay - New London. Opened - November 1871. 2015 Status - Open to industrial spurs in west Green Bay to MP 4. Otherwise abandoned. Most of the abandoned segment are currently trails.
* New London - Wisconsin Rapids. Opened - January 1873. 2015 Status - Open New London (MP 39) - Northport (MP 41.75) and Plover - Wisconsin Rapids. Northport - Manawa is currently out of service. Otherwise abandoned.
* Wisconsin Rapids - Merrillan. Opened - January 1873. 2021 Status - Open.
* Merrillan - Arcadia. Opened December 1873. 2021 Status - Open.
* Arcadia - East Winona. Opened 1883. 2021 Status - O/O/S.
* East Winona - Winona. Opened 1891. The GBW operated over this section as one-third owner of the Winona Bridge Railway Company. One third was originally Chicago Great Western, another third was owned by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. Status 2015 Abandoned. The bridge was closed to traffic in 1984. It was damaged by fire in 1989 and dismantled in 1990.

==Branch lines==
*Casco Junction - Algoma - Sturgeon Bay, see Ahnapee and Western Railway.
*Iola (Iola Northern Railroad), opened 1893 from Scandinavia, operated by the GBW and purchased by them in 1914, abandoned October 1956. Note: The proposed extension to Prentice to connect with the Soo Line was never constructed.
*Waupaca (Waupaca Green Bay Railway), opened 1907 from Scandinavia, purchased by GBW in 1922, closed 1947 (passenger traffic ceased some years previously). The Waupaca Line was promoted by local business interests to provide competition to the Wisconsin Central. The Waupaca Depot was unusual in that it was the former Evangelical Lutheran church.
*Biron Branch, opened sometime between 1881 and 1896 from Wisconsin Rapids, open as of 2021. Although only long from Wisconsin Rapids, it proved valuable as connection to paper industries.
*Stevens Point (Stevens Point and Northern), opened January 1882 from Plover, purchased by GBW in May 1896, open as of 2021.
*La Crosse Branch (La Crosse to Onalaska), , opened 1876, abandoned 1922. Connected to main line via trackage rights over the C&amp;NW from Marshland.

==Lake Michigan ferry connections==
The GBW prospered from 1892 when a train ferry was introduced across Lake Michigan from Kewaunee eliminating transhipment and bypassing the congested Chicago area. Ferries ran to Frankfort, Michigan, operated by the Ann Arbor Railroad and Ludington, Michigan, operated by the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio.

Frankfort services ended around 1980 and those to Ludington in 1990.

<text>Blaze Bayley (born Bayley Alexander Cooke, 29 May 1963) is an English heavy metal singer. He was the lead singer of Wolfsbane from 1984 to 1994 (and currently since 2010, following reunions in 2007 and 2009). He was also the lead singer of Iron Maiden from 1994 to 1999. Since then, he has pursued a solo career and has released eleven studio albums. Blaze was voted number 67 in Sweden Rock magazine&#x27;s top 100 singers of all time.

== Early life ==

Bayley was born Bayley Alexander Cooke in Birmingham on 29 May 1963. His main inspiration to be a singer was when he saw Ronnie James Dio perform live at Birmingham Odeon on Dio&#x27;s &quot;Holy Diver&quot; tour. At the time, Bayley was working a night job as a hotel porter. He would watch the rehearsals of a sixth form band who played Sex Pistols covers and some original material. It was the first time Blaze decided he would like to be a singer on stage.

== Career ==

=== Wolfsbane (1984–1994, 2007–present) ===

Bayley started his career as the lead vocalist of Wolfsbane, a band formed in 1984. Their debut album, &quot;Live Fast, Die Fast&quot;, was released in 1989.

Before that, Wolfsbane had recorded three demos - Wolfsbane (1985), Dancin&#x27; Dirty (1987), and Wasted but Dangerous (1988). Notably, the latter was recorded at Square Dance Studios in Derby, England. In 1990, they had the privilege of supporting Iron Maiden on their No Prayer on the Road tour in the UK. During the same year, Wolfsbane released an EP titled All Hell&#x27;s Breaking Loose Down at Little Kathy Wilson&#x27;s Place. Their second full studio album, Down Fall the Good Guys, followed in 1991, granting them their sole UK chart entry with the single &quot;Ezy&quot; peaking at No. 68.

Despite being dropped by Def American due to perceived insufficient sales, Wolfsbane was voted the UK&#x27;s best unsigned act in 1993. That same year, they released a live album, Massive Noise Injection, through the Bronze Company label. In 1994, the band unveiled their self-titled third studio album, Wolfsbane, also on the Bronze Company label. A limited edition of the album included the EP Everything Else. It was during Bruce Dickinson&#x27;s departure from Iron Maiden in 1993 that Bayley emerged as the chosen replacement from hundreds of auditions. Following this, Wolfsbane disbanded.

In 2007, Wolfsbane regrouped for a special one-off performance, with Bayley resuming vocal and frontman duties. They provided support for The Wildhearts on a brief UK tour in December 2007. Another tour followed in December 2009, this time supporting The Quireboys on their &#x27;A Little Bit of What You Fancy 20th Anniversary Tour&#x27; . Notably, Wolfsbane headlined a show at the Borderline in London on 9 April 2011. Subsequently, they embarked on a tour supporting Saxon in April 2011. In 2011, Wolfsbane released the album Wolfsbane Save the World, along with an EP titled Did it for the Money, complemented by a successful UK tour.

=== Iron Maiden (1994–1999) ===

Bayley was chosen as Bruce Dickinson&#x27;s replacement after hundreds of auditions. His departure from Wolfsbane led to their disbandment later that year. After a serious motorcycle accident put him out of commission for a year, Bayley was able to record vocals for Maiden&#x27;s &quot;The X Factor&quot;, released in 1995. Bayley went on tour with the band in support of the album. Another Iron Maiden album with Bayley on vocals, &quot;Virtual XI&quot; was released in 1998.

The two Iron Maiden albums released during Bayley&#x27;s tenure did not chart as well as the band had hoped. &quot;The X Factor&quot; peaked at No. 8 on the UK Albums Chart and &quot;Virtual XI&quot; hit only No. 16, both being the lowest-charting Iron Maiden studio albums since &quot;Killers&quot; was released in 1981.

In 1999, Bayley was dismissed from Iron Maiden during a band meeting, after suffering from difficulties with his voice due to extensive touring and performing songs outside his vocal range. After the return of Bruce Dickinson, Iron Maiden occasionally perform songs from the two Maiden albums featuring Bayley, including &quot;Man on the Edge&quot; and &quot;Futureal&quot;, which he co-wrote, though no Bayley-era songs appeared in the band&#x27;s set list between 2004 and 2017. In 2018, the band played &quot;The Clansman&quot; and &quot;Sign of the Cross&quot;. Likewise, Bayley has performed Iron Maiden songs originally recorded by the Dickinson and Paul Di&#x27;Anno led line-ups at some concerts.

=== Solo career (1999–present) ===

==== BLAZE / Blaze Bayley (1999–2007) ====

Following Bayley&#x27;s departure from Iron Maiden in 1999, he began a solo career when he formed his own band, &quot;BLAZE&quot;, in March that year. Bayley recruited guitarist Steve Wray, guitarist John Slater, bassist Rob Naylor and drummer Jeff Singer, and signed a deal with German label SPV, releasing his debut studio album &quot;Silicon Messiah&quot; in 2000. The album was followed up by &quot;Tenth Dimension&quot; in 2002 and the band&#x27;s first live album in 2003, &quot;As Live as It Gets&quot;. All those albums had positive reviews, but financial problems and some issues with the record company soon led to changes in the band.

After recording the live album, Jeff Singer announced he was leaving. Three months later, Rob Naylor was also leaving. Session drummer Phil Greenhouse and bassist Wayne Banks were hired for the rest of the &quot;Tenth Dimension&quot; tour until permanent replacements could be found. Guitarist Jason Banks was drafted in for a few gigs at the end of 2003 to cover for John Slater.

At the end of 2003, Blaze began writing material for their third studio album, &quot;Blood &amp; Belief&quot;. Phil Greenhouse was replaced on drums by Jason Bowld for recording and Dave Knight for touring. The band began to tour for the album shortly after it was released in 2004, but were set back again by the news that John Slater could not perform a large section of the tour. Despite rejoining the band later in the year, Slater eventually left the band in September with Steve Wray to form the band Rise to Addiction. Bassist Wayne Banks and drummer Dave Knight left the band to join the Robin Gibb band in September 2004.

Blaze performed a number of shows in 2004 and 2005 with the line-up of Bayley, guitarist Oliver Palotai, guitarist Luca Princiotta, bassist Nick Douglas, and drummer Daniel Löble. The two guitarists were eventually kept on as full members. The band&#x27;s line-up shifted once again when Löble quit to join German power metal band Helloween early in 2005 and when Douglas returned to another German heavy metal band, Doro. The two were replaced by unknown German musicians Daniel Schild and Christian Ammann respectively. With the new line-up, Blaze began to work on a fourth studio album for a release in 2007, but in January that year it was announced the entire line-up had to separate from Bayley due to serious financial matters. Following the line-up change, Bayley opted to rename the band under his name, Blaze Bayley.

==== Blaze Bayley (2007–onwards) ====
In February 2007, Blaze Bayley Band (also known as BBB) added guitarists Nicolas Bermudez and Rich Newport, bassist Dave Bermudez, and drummer Rico Banderra and recorded the live DVD album &quot;Alive in Poland&quot;, released later that year. Bayley announced that Rich Newport had left the band to pursue a &quot;career&quot; as a guitar teacher later on that year, and Jay Walsh would replace him onstage for the remainder of the tour. Jay was made a full member of the band in November 2007. Bayley also announced the addition of drummer Lawrence Paterson, formerly of British metal bands Chokehold and Shadowkeep at the same time.

In July 2008, Blaze Bayley Band (BBB) released their debut studio album, &quot;The Man Who Would Not Die&quot;. The album also contained the band&#x27;s first single, &quot;Robot&quot;, despite only being available digitally. It is sometimes regarded as a mini-compilation as it includes many bonus tracks.
In September Debbie Hartland, Blaze&#x27;s wife and manager of the band, died of a stroke after some weeks of recovery. The singer and the band, although distraught by the loss, bravely continued to perform in honour of her love and committed work. The band recorded another DVD live at Z7, &quot;The Night That Will Not Die&quot;, which was released in March 2009. Blaze Bayley announced that the band had started recording for their new album on 28 September 2009. A contest was run on the band&#x27;s forum: the first two people who correctly guessed the title of the new album would receive a free signed copy. The title was revealed to be &quot;Promise and Terror&quot; a few days later.
The second album &quot;Promise and Terror&quot; was released on 1 February 2010. Professional reviews were generally very positive. The album was produced by Jason Edwards.

In February 2010, BBB started their 2010 world tour in Dudley, UK. They spent the next months playing the UK, France, Italy, Germany before leaving for the South American leg of the tour. They then returned to Europe later in the year.

In May 2010, Lawrence Paterson, the drummer for the band left due to unspecified personal and professional reasons. Paterson was also the author of the book &quot;At The End of the Day&quot;, a biography of the Blaze Bayley Band. Also their manager, Anna, announced her departure from the band. She claimed that the band&#x27;s idea of where to go next and hers were not in the same direction.

Following the departure of Paterson the Blaze Bayley Band engaged Italian drummer Claudio Tirincanti to continue the Promise and Terror tour. On 10 July 2010 Blaze Blayley claimed live on stage that his current album was his best-selling as a solo-artist shedding some light on the recent changes in his line-up and management.

The BBB embarked on a short European tour in early 2011 and were supposed to follow that up in May 2011 with more dates in the UK. But surprisingly, on 29 March via his official channels, Blaze Bayley stated that he had to part ways with the band due to both health and financial reasons. Later emerged that a great problem has been the fact that the Bermudez brothers had to frequently buy flights back home to Colombia to renew their visas. The matter was heavy not only from the financial and bureaucratic point of view, but also musically: the BBB had often to find last minute substitutes, in the likes of Luke and Chris Appleton from the band Fury UK or Dave Andrews who would later join the band.

On 31 March 2011, Blaze announced that he would continue as a solo performer working with different musicians.

Alongside the reunion and new recordings of Wolfsbane, Bayley played a two-week acoustic solo tour in the UK in September 2011 with fellow Wolfsbane guitarist Jase Edwards plus a few unplugged gigs in Italy with Andrea Neri on guitar. Footage of the acoustic shows with Jase Edwards can be seen on the Official Blaze Bayley YouTube Page.

In 2011 Blaze presents the first new song with the renewed line-up, called &quot;Black Country&quot;. In February 2012 Bayley toured Russia with Paul Di&#x27;Anno, starting a partnership between the two ex-Iron Maiden singers who hit the road as &quot;Blaze VS Paul&quot; and &quot;Double Trouble Tour&quot; in 2012 and 2013.

The singer hit the stages of some summer festivals and after that travelled to the US in October/November 2011 for his first full US headline tour since his days with Iron Maiden, supported by North-American musicians of the Canadian band Man the Destroyer plus American guitarist/producer Rick Plester, of international fame, who worked with Bayley in the future.

On 26 December 2011, in a personal Christmas message on his website Blaze announced that his new album &quot;The King of Metal&quot; would be released on 8 March 2012. On the same day, Blaze officially announced the first two legs of the King of Metal world tour on the official Blaze Bayley Facebook page.
&quot;The King of Metal&quot; album was recorded between Italy and the Netherlands, mixed by Tony Newton at Steve Harris home studio, Rick Plester in the US and Raoul Soentken in the Netherlands.

New line-up consists of three Italians (the confirmed drummer Claudio Tirincanti, bassist Lehmann, guitarist Andrea Neri) and Dutch youngster Thomas Zwijsen, a talented classic guitarist who became a cult-musician on YouTube for his acoustic arrangements of Iron Maiden&#x27;s classics. Zwijsen co-wrote most of the music of the new Bayley album. The same line-up recorded the album and backed Bayley in the King of Metal European Tour, playing more than 60 gigs.

The busy schedule of 2012 also saw an acoustic tour with Zwijsen (July), some appearances with Czech band Seven, a few gigs with Wolfsbane (October), a second co-headlining tour with Paul Di&#x27;Anno in Eastern Europe, Australia and New Zealand (November), and the successful &quot;unplugged&quot; tour that also touched Brazil and Europe, with Zwijsen on classical guitar and Dutch violinist Anne Bakker.

In 2013, the intense acoustic experience became an official release in the catalogue of Bayley: in partnership with Thomas Zwijsen, he released an EP (&quot;Russian Holiday&quot;) of classically arranged tunes, working with Yellowdog Creative Project Management for the release. The artwork of the album was created by Akirant.es.

Bayley then hit the US for a special tour with an all-star band named The Foundry, with guitarist Rick Plester (Black Symphony), bass player John Moyer (Adrenaline Mob, Disturbed, Queensrÿche) and Scorpions drummer James Kottak, plus vocalist Shawn Austin. Later in the year, Bayley reached Canada for some acoustic gigs and then toured again with Di&#x27;Anno in Finland, Russia and Ukraine.

===== Partnership with Absolva =====
Bayley announced &quot;Soundtracks of My Life&quot;, a double-CD best of, as a tribute to his 30th anniversary as a singer, released in November 2013, and followed by an extensive world tour the following year. The album presented two new tracks, &quot;Hatred&quot; and &quot;Eating Children&quot;, written and performed by Blaze Bayley and Rick Plester. For both songs, two promotional video clips were shot.

After a first leg of the tour in South America, Bayley presented the new live band for European gigs. They were musicians of the Manchester-based band Absolva: Chris Appleton (guitars, already seen live with Bayley), Dan Bate (bass, then temporarily replaced by Luke Appleton, brother of Chris and member of Iced Earth, and then again new Absolva permanent bass player Karl Schramm) and Martin McNee (drums).

With the Absolva line-up, Blaze recorded the DVD &quot;Live in Prague&quot; which contained a full show of the &quot;Soundtracks of My Life&quot; European tour plus bonuses. In Slovakia and Germany, with other musicians, Bayley then celebrated his 20th anniversary of joining Iron Maiden with a small tour with an exclusive set focused on songs of his period in the band. Then, Bayley hit Canada and US, the latter again under the moniker The Foundry with Plester, Moyer and Twisted Sister&#x27;s drummer A.J. Pero and occasionally Bobby Jarzombek behind the kit. In 2015, he toured South America under the moniker &quot;Metal Singers&quot; together with vocalists Udo Dirkschneider, Ripper Owens and Mike Vescera.
In March 2016, with new management – Mark Appleton (of independent record label Rocksector Records) – a new album &quot;Infinite Entanglement&quot; was released, followed by an extensive European tour with the Absolva line-up. The new album was a concept inspired by sci-fi themes like Blaze&#x27;s early solo releases &quot;Silicon Messiah&quot; and &quot;Tenth Dimension&quot;. &quot;Infinite Entanglement&quot; was written and recorded by Bayley and the musicians from Absolva, as well as writing contributor Michelle Sciarrotta. The record also featured backing vocal contributions from Luke Appleton of Iced Earth, Jo Robinson and Mel Adams of Aonia and Liz Owen, nylon acoustic guitar from Thomas Zwijsen, violin from Anne Bakker, as well as voice actors Bayley himself, Aine Brewer, Rob Toogood and Michelle Sciarrotta. The European touring for 2016 was completed by a performance at Huskvarna Rock &amp; Art festival in Sweden. During 2016, Bayley also toured Latin America and Canada with different musicians, followed by North America with Geoff Tate and Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens under the band name Trinity, a short-lived collaboration organised by Tate&#x27;s management.

In June 2016, Bayley was onstage as guest vocalist with Disturbed at Download Festival in England, performing The Who&#x27;s &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot;.

&quot;Endure and Survive&quot;, the second album in the &quot;Infinite Entanglement&quot; trilogy, was released in March 2017, co-written between Bayley, Chris Appleton and Michelle Sciarrotta. The album continued the sci-fi story and again featured the same backing vocal/choir contributions as its predecessor, plus instrumental contributions from Thomas Zwijsen on nylon acoustic guitar and Anne Bakker on violin, as well as Uli Jon Roth&#x27;s keyboard player Corvin Bahn who played accordion. The voice actors also returned to help continue the story. The official video for promotional singles of the album, &quot;Escape Velocity&quot; was filmed at Iron Maiden lead singer Bruce Dickinson&#x27;s aircraft maintenance business and flight simulator, Cardiff Aviation Ltd.

The concluding part of the trilogy, &quot;The Redemption of William Black&quot;, was released in March 2018, co-written predominantly by the Bayley/Appleton partnership.

During these years, the touring and recording band was cemented from the ranks of Absolva – Chris Appleton (guitar and backing vocals), Martin McNee (drums), Karl Schramm (bass and backing vocals). World tours have accompanied each full metal release.

In November 2018, a second classical acoustic album &quot;December Wind&quot; was released featuring guest guitarist Thomas Zwijsen.

In March 2019, a double live album and DVD, &quot;Live in France&quot;, was released, as recorded at the famous Chez Paulette venue near Nancy, France.

2019 marked the 25th anniversary of Blaze Bayley joining Iron Maiden, and to help celebrate this, a series of festival appearances occurred featuring a setlist selected exclusively from his two studio albums with Iron Maiden – &quot;X-Factor&quot; and &quot;Virtual XI&quot;. For these performances, Luke Appleton of Iced Earth was drafted in as second guitarist. The most prominent of these performances was at Sweden Rock Festival and Rock the Coast (Spain).

In April 2020, a double live album and DVD, &quot;Live in Czech&quot;, was released, as recorded at the venue Melodka in Brno, Czech Republic.

===== Recent events =====
On 15 December 2020, it was announced on Blaze Bayley&#x27;s website and social media that pre-order had started for Blaze&#x27;s new studio album &quot;War Within Me&quot;.

Bayley has continued to work with the British heavy metal musicians from Absolva. The album was released digitally on 9 April 2021 and soon after the physical version was released. On February 23, 2024 a new album is announced: &quot;Circle Of Stone&quot;, anticipated by digital singles &quot;Rage&quot;, the title track and &quot;Mind Reader&quot;.

<doc id="1009869" wikidata="Q738686" url="?curid=1009869" title="MTT assay">
<text>The MTT assay is a colorimetric assay for assessing cell metabolic activity. NAD(P)H-dependent cellular oxidoreductase enzymes may, under defined conditions, reflect the number of viable cells present. These enzymes are capable of reducing the tetrazolium dye MTT, which is chemically 3-(4,5-di[[MTT assay|methyl]][[MTT assay|thiazol]]-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, to its insoluble formazan, which has a purple color. Other closely related tetrazolium dyes including XTT, MTS and the WSTs, are used in conjunction with the intermediate electron acceptor, 1-methoxy phenazine methosulfate (PMS). With WST-1, which is cell-impermeable, reduction occurs outside the cell via plasma membrane electron transport. However, this traditionally assumed explanation is currently contended as proof has also been found of MTT reduction to formazan in lipidic cellular structures without apparent involvement of oxidoreductases.

Tetrazolium dye assays can also be used to measure cytotoxicity (loss of viable cells) or cytostatic activity (shift from proliferation to quiescence) of potential medicinal agents and toxic materials. MTT assays are usually done in the dark since the MTT reagent is sensitive to light.

==MTT and related tetrazolium salts==
MTT, a yellow tetrazole, is reduced to purple formazan in living cells. A solubilization solution (usually either dimethyl sulfoxide, an acidified ethanol solution, or a solution of the detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate in diluted hydrochloric acid) is added to dissolve the insoluble purple formazan product into a colored solution. The absorbance of this colored solution can be quantified by measuring at a certain wavelength (usually between 500 and 600 nm) by a spectrophotometer. The degree of light absorption is dependent on the degree of formazan concentration accumulated inside the cell and on the cell surface. The greater the formazan concentration, the deeper the purple colour and thus the higher the absorbance.

XTT (2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide) has been proposed to replace MTT, yielding higher sensitivity and a higher dynamic range. The formed formazan dye is water-soluble, avoiding a final solubilization step.

Water-soluble tetrazolium salts are more recent alternatives to MTT: they were developed by introducing positive or negative charges and hydroxy groups to the phenyl ring of the tetrazolium salt, or better with sulfonate groups added directly or indirectly to the phenyl ring.
MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium), in the presence of phenazine methosulfate (PMS), produces a formazan product that has an absorbance maximum at 490 nm in phosphate-buffered saline. The MTS assay is often described as a &#x27;one-step&#x27; MTT assay, which offers the convenience of adding the reagent straight to the cell culture without the intermittent steps required in the MTT assay. However this convenience makes the MTS assay susceptible to colormetric interference as the intermittent steps in the MTT assay remove traces of coloured compounds, whilst these remain in the microtitre plate in the one-step MTS assay. Precautions are needed to ensure accuracy when using this assay and there are strong arguments for confirming MTS results using qualitative observations under a microscope. (This, however, is prudent for all colormetric assays.)

WSTs (water-soluble tetrazolium salts) are a series of other water-soluble dyes for MTT assays, developed to give different absorption spectra of the formed formazans. WST-1 and in particular WST-8 (2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium), are advantageous over MTT in that they are reduced outside cells, combined with PMS electron mediator, and yield a water-soluble formazan. Finally, WST assays (1) can be read directly (unlike MTT that needs a solubilization step), (2) give a more effective signal than MTT, and (3) decrease toxicity to cells (unlike cell-permeable MTT, and its insoluble formazan that accumulate inside cells).

==Significance==
Tetrazolium dye reduction is generally assumed to be dependent on NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductase enzymes largely in the cytosolic compartment of the cell. Therefore, reduction of MTT and other tetrazolium dyes depends on the cellular metabolic activity due to NAD(P)H flux. Cells with a low metabolism such as thymocytes and splenocytes reduce very little MTT. In contrast, rapidly dividing cells exhibit high rates of MTT reduction. It is important to keep in mind that assay conditions can alter metabolic activity and thus tetrazolium dye reduction without affecting cell viability. In addition, the mechanism of reduction of tetrazolium dyes, &quot;i.e.&quot; intracellular (MTT, MTS) &quot;vs.&quot; extracellular (WST-1), will also determine the amount of product. Additionally, proof has been provided as to the spontaneous MTT reduction in lipidic cellular compartments/structures, without enzymatic catalysis involved. Nevertheless, even under this alternative paradigm, MTT assay still assesses the reduction potential of a cell (i.e. availability of reducing compounds to drive cellular energetics). As such, the final cell viability interpretation remains unchanged.

In studying the viability of cells seeded on 3D fibrous scaffolds, the thickness of the scaffolds may influence the MTT assay results.

== Observation ==
The optical density (OD) at 550 nm is used to calculate the percentage of viability results using the following equation:

:Viability % = 100 × OD550e / OD550b

where:
* OD550e = Mean value of the measured optical density of the test item
* OD550b = Mean value of the measured optical density of the negative control

<text>Grønland (meaning “Greenland” in Norwegian) is a neighbourhood in central Oslo, Norway. It is served by several tram and bus lines, as well as the Oslo Metro at the Grønland Station. The neighborhood, along with neighboring Tøyen, is considered to be very ethnically diverse and is home to a large population of immigrants.

The neighbourhood is situated on the east side of Akerselva, five to ten minutes walking distance from Oslo Central Station and downtown Oslo. It stretches from Grünerløkka down to the fjord by Middelalderparken shore area.

== History ==
The area was originally the beach area east of the Aker river discharge, and the name alludes to grassland by the lake (the name Grønland means &quot;green land&quot; or &quot;green fields&quot; in Norwegian). The streets Grønland and Grønlandsleiret are where the old shoreline used to be. This is considered the historic northern border of Oslo. They are the old road between the suburb and Oslo (then called Christiania), via Vaterland Bridge (first bridge built 1654). The growth of Bjørvika led to the incorporation of Grønland into Christiania/Oslo in 1859. A church, a school and a fire station were built near the newly erected Botsfengslet in the 1600s.

<doc id="1009892" wikidata="Q2749216" url="?curid=1009892" title="W25 (nuclear warhead)">
<text>The W25 was a small nuclear warhead that was developed by the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory for air-defense use. It was a fission device with a nominal yield of 1.7 kt.

The W25 was used for the MB-1 &quot;Ding Dong&quot;, an unguided air-to-air rocket used by US Northrop F-89 Scorpion, F-101 Voodoo, and F-106 Delta Dart interceptor aircraft, and Canadian CF-101 Voodoo aircraft, as part of NATO nuclear sharing. The MB-1 entered service in 1957 and was eventually redesignated the AIR-2 Genie. Limited numbers were carried by Air National Guard F-106 aircraft until December 1984.

==History==
===Genie application===
The W25 program began in March 1951, when the Division of Military Application suggested that the use of nuclear weapons to blunt enemy aircraft attacks be examined. However, little immediate action was taken because the state-of-the-art in both warheads and missiles was not yet advanced enough for the proposal to be practicable.

Technology soon improved and, by February 1952, the Joint Chiefs of Staff requested that the Joint Air Board study the matter. The study was completed in January 1953, which suggested that gun-, rocket- and missile-carried warheads were possible, launched from interceptor and bomber aircraft. The board specifically recommended the development of nuclear warheads for the RIM-8 Talos, CIM-10 Bomarc and MIM-3 Nike Ajax surface-to-air missiles. During discussions about the report, it was believed that tens of thousands of air defense warheads would be needed, and so the warheads would have to be economical in nuclear materials to reduce their cost.

At the same time, the US air force wanted a high-velocity, nuclear armed, air to air missile. The air force believed that, because air defenses operated under peacetime conditions, it was desirable to have the ability for a human to make confirmation that an unidentified aircraft was indeed hostile before engaging it.

Sandia National Laboratory had been investigating the high-altitude operation of nuclear weapons since 1952 and, in August 1953, concluded that the only major concern was high-voltage breakdown at low pressures. That meant that existing weapon-firing sets were unsuitable, so solutions were examined. It was soon decided that the problem could be solved through the use of a sealed nuclear weapon, with the weapon filled with high-pressure air to prevent electric arcing.

In October 1953, the air defense warhead programs took an unusual turn in that they avoided the then-trend to highly standardize nuclear and non-nuclear components of weapons. This was justified on the basis that air defense warheads needed to be readily available for use, needed to be highly resistant to premature detonation, and needed to economise the use of nuclear materials. Sandia conducted research into the optimum size of an air-to-air missile warhead and, in May 1954, the Atomic Energy Commission began development of an air-to-air nuclear warhead.

In May 1954, the military characteristics were specified for a warhead. It would be capable of remaining at the ready condition for 30 days, be capable of 50 hours flight time at altitudes of up to , and withstand temperatures of . The warhead would be able to withstand acceleration of along the longitudinal axis and along perpendicular axes.

In June 1954, the warhead names Mark 25, Mark 30 and Mark 31 were formally adopted. The air force would be responsible for the rocket systems, including the arming and fusing system, while the AEC would supply the warhead and associated assembly, testing and handling equipment. The rocket for the warhead was initially named Ding Dong and was optimized for carriage on the F-86 Sabre, F-89 Scorpion and F-100 Super Sabre. The rocket was to be in diameter, but excursions of up to were to be investigated.

A study of yield to kill probability was published in November 1954. While higher yields increased the lethal radius of the weapon, higher yields required the launching range to be increased to allow for a safe escape by the launching aircraft. This reduced the accuracy of the weapon, eventually counteracting the advantage from the increased yield. Cost in nuclear material to kill was also studied, and it was found that the largest weapon diameter of was most efficient in nuclear material. However, larger weapons required a larger rocket and caused aircraft compatibility problems. A diameter of was eventually settled on.

In January 1955, the joint study group was dissolved and reformed as the Air-to-Air Rocket Joint Project Group. By that point, the weapon weighed approximately .

In March 1955, the assistant secretary for defense authorized the full development of the rocket and its warhead. In the same month, the air force expressed an urgent desire to have the weapon operational by 1957. Because of the numbers required, they requested that quantity production of the weapon begin but, because no firm production directive had been received, the AEC denied the request. The military liaison committee subsequently requested the warhead be in production by the rocket availability date of January 1957.

The weapon was to have maximum interchangeability of components with other weapons, provided that it did not compromise the weapon&#x27;s sealed design. The weapon would be capable of storage in a ready-to-operate condition for at least 30 days, with 90 days being desirable, as long as such a requirement did not delay the production date. The warhead would be capable of operation up to , with being desirable. Diameter would be with length and weight being held at a minimum.

Concern was expressed at this time over the use of thermal batteries in the weapon, because all the components needed to produce detonation would be present inside the warhead. An evaluation was therefore made and a report released in April 1955, describing several safing options that could be used. Eventually an automatic safe/arm device was selected, that disconnected the high voltage connections to the detonators. By placing it inside the warhead and not in the warhead adaption kit, it became possible for the system to also short the x-unit capacitor and thermal battery.

By May 1955, the rocket, the AIR-2 Genie, was taking shape. Unguided, the rocket would have a range of and a velocity of over its launch speed. Length would be , diameter with fins retracted of and with fins extended . The warhead was pressurized to at the factory to prevent high-voltage arc over at altitude.

In June 1955, the air force requested an acceleration of the warhead production program, which would produce an interim warhead for short-term deployment that would be replaced by production Mark 25 warheads as they became available. The interim warheads were to be called the EC-25 (emergency capability warhead), while production warheads were to be called the Mark 25 Mod 0 or W25-0 warhead. Design release was scheduled for July 1956, with the first production warheads being produced in June 1957. Emergency capability warheads were produced beginning in December 1956. Initially, the rocket was certified for the F-86 Sabre, with later capability with the F-101 Voodoo and F-106 Delta Dart as the aircraft became available.

The weapon was hailed as a major achievement as it was believed to be of a new generation of weapons that required little maintenance or inspection — a &quot;wooden&quot; bomb, likened to that of needing the maintenance of a block of pine.

In January 1961, Sandia was requested to develop an environmental safing device for the weapon. This was achieved with an inertial switch, producing the Mark 25 Mod 1 warhead. The weapon entered the stockpile in March 1962.

The W25 was retired in 1984.

===Atomic demolition munition===
In October 1953, it was recommended that a lightweight atomic demolition munition (ADM) be developed. The device would be in diameter, in length, weigh less than and be capable of disassembly into packages. The application was cancelled in favor of ADMs based on the Mark 30 and Mark 31 in February 1956.

===Little John===
In September 1954, the US army began examining warheads for the MGR-3 Little John rocket (originally called Honest John Junior). Military characteristics for a warhead were provided in April 1955 and the W25 warhead was briefly considered for the role. In February 1956, the application was cancelled in favor of a higher-yield, smaller diameter weapon. The W45 warhead was eventually selected for the rocket.

===Boosted and all-uranium warhead===
In June 1956, informal comments were made about the lack of a boosted W25 warhead. Albuquerque Operations Office replied that no formal request for such a weapon had ever been received and the military promptly furnished such a request. In July 1956, a preliminary study was concluded stating that, because of the size limitations of the Genie application, a complete redesign would be needed, effectively producing a new warhead. 

That study was followed by concerns about the plutonium hazard of the W25 and queries about producing an all-uranium weapon. A study group was convened which reported in November 1956 that, while the plutonium hazard could be reduced to some degree, inside the space limitations given, an all-uranium warhead was not possible without utilizing a gun-type device. In May 1957, the AEC was directed to examine ways to minimize the plutonium hazard without increasing fissile material requirements. The results of that study remain classified, but the application was cancelled in November 1957.

==Design==
The W25 was in diameter and long, with a reported weight of . The warhead was an implosion weapon and was of the sealed design.

<text>The Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP), defined in , is a routing protocol used to share information between routers to facilitate the transportation of IP multicast packets among networks. It formed the basis of the Internet&#x27;s historic multicast backbone, Mbone.

==Operation==
The protocol is based on the Routing Information Protocol (RIP). The router generates a routing table with the multicast group of which it has knowledge with corresponding distances (i.e. number of devices/routers between the router and the destination). When a multicast packet is received by a router, it is forwarded by the router&#x27;s interfaces specified in the routing table.

DVMRP operates via a reverse path flooding technique, sending a copy of a received packet (specifically IGMP messages for exchanging routing information with other routers) out through each interface except the one at which the packet arrived. If a router (i.e. a LAN which it borders) does not wish to be part of a particular multicast group, it sends a &quot;prune message&quot; along the source path of the multicast.

==Criticisms==
Being a naïve distance-vector protocol, DVMRP has difficulties with network scaling in some topologies, primarily due to the periodic reflooding necessary to detect new hosts. This was more prevalent in early versions of the protocol, prior to the implementation of pruning. DVMRP&#x27;s flat unicast routing mechanism, which is used to determine the source interface of a data stream, also affects its ability to scale.

<doc id="1009912" wikidata="Q178541" url="?curid=1009912" title="Medical glove">
<text>Medical gloves are disposable gloves used during medical examinations and procedures to help prevent cross-contamination between caregivers and patients. Medical gloves are made of different polymers including latex, nitrile rubber, polyvinyl chloride and neoprene; they come unpowdered, or powdered with corn starch to lubricate the gloves, making them easier to put on the hands.

Corn starch replaced tissue-irritating lycopodium powder and talc, but even corn starch can impede healing if it gets into tissues (as during surgery). As such, unpowdered gloves are used more often during surgery and other sensitive procedures. Special manufacturing processes are used to compensate for the lack of powder.

There are two main types of medical gloves: examination and surgical. Surgical gloves have more precise sizing with a better precision and sensitivity and are made to a higher standard. Examination gloves are available either sterile or non-sterile, while surgical gloves are generally sterile.

Besides medicine, medical gloves are widely used in chemical and biochemical laboratories. Medical gloves offer some basic protection against corrosives and surface contamination. However, they are easily penetrated by solvents and various hazardous chemicals, and should not be used for dishwashing or otherwise when the task involves immersion of the gloved hand in the solvent. Medical gloves are recommended to be worn for two main reasons:

# To reduce the risk of contamination of health-care workers hands with blood and other body fluids.
# To reduce the risk of germ dissemination to the environment and of transmission from the health-care worker to the patient and vice versa, as well as from one patient to another.

==History==
Caroline Hampton became the chief nurse of the operating room when Johns Hopkins Hospital opened in 1889. When &quot;in the winter of 1889 or 1890&quot; she developed a skin reaction to mercuric chloride that was used for asepsis, William Halsted, soon-to-be her husband, asked the Goodyear Rubber Company to produce thin rubber gloves for her protection. In 1894 Halsted implemented the use of sterilized medical gloves at Johns Hopkins. However, the first modern disposable glove was invented by Ansell Rubber Co. Pty. Ltd. in 1965.
They based the production on the technique for making condoms. These gloves have a range of clinical uses ranging from dealing with human excrement to dental applications.

Criminals have also been known to wear medical gloves during commission of crimes. These gloves are often chosen because their thinness and tight fit allow for dexterity. However, because of the thinness of these gloves, fingerprints may actually pass through the material as glove prints, thus transferring the wearer&#x27;s prints onto the surface touched or handled.

The participants of the Watergate burglaries infamously wore rubber surgical gloves in an effort to hide their fingerprints.

==Industry==
In 2020, the market for medical gloves had a value of more than USD 10.17 billion and, with growing demand (especially in developing countries), is expected to grow by 9.2 per cent per year until 2028. The majority of medical gloves is manufactured in South East Asia with Malaysia alone accounting for about three quarters of global production in 2020.

===Labour rights violations===
There have been several investigations in factories in Malaysia, Thailand and Sri Lanka that documented severe violations of human and labour rights. Both in Malaysia and Thailand migrants represent the majority of workers in hard physical labour. They are frequently recruited by specialized agencies in their less affluent home countries such as Nepal and are often charged with high recruitment fees forcing them into debt bondage. There are documented cases in which employees&#x27; passports were withheld by their employers leaving them especially vulnerable to exploitation.
In 2010, for instance, Swedwatch, a Swedish labour right NGO examining a Malaysian factory, reported that most employees were working 12 hours per day seven days a week without overtime pay or payslip, harassment of workers by the management, safety deficits and poor hygienic conditions in employee housing. 
Reacting to these findings, from October 2019 to March 2020, the US Department of Labor listed medical gloves produced in Malaysia on the List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor and temporarily banned the import of gloves produced by the Malaysian company Top Glove, the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer at the time.

==Sizing==
Generally speaking, examination gloves are sized in XS, S, M and L. Some brands may offer size XL. Surgical gloves are usually sized more precisely since they are worn for a much longer period of time and require exceptional dexterity. The sizing of surgical gloves are based on the measured circumference around the palm (excluding the thumb) in inches, at a level slightly above the thumb&#x27;s sewn. Typical sizing ranges from 5.5 to 9.0 at an increment of 0.5. Some brands may also offer size 5.0. First-time users of surgical gloves may take some time to find the right size and brand that suit their hand geometry the most. People with a thicker palm may need a size larger than the measurement and vice versa. Sizing should be one of the first thing to look for. Dexterity is essential for every worker and wearing the wrong size of glove can have a huge impact on someone&#x27;s work. Wearing the right size of glove can also increase comfort, which can influence workers to wear their assigned PPE.

Research on a group of American surgeons found that the most common surgical glove size for men is 7.0, followed by 6.5; and for women 6.0 followed by 5.5.

==Powdered gloves==
To facilitate donning of gloves, powders have been used as lubricants. Early powders derived from pines or club moss were found to be toxic. Talcum powder was used for decades but linked to postoperative granuloma and scar formation. Corn starch, another agent used as lubricant, was also found to have potential side effects such as inflammatory reactions and granuloma and scar formation.

===Elimination of powdered medical gloves===
With the availability of non-powdered medical gloves that were easy to don, calls for the elimination of powdered gloves became louder. By 2016, healthcare systems in Germany and the United Kingdom had eliminated their use. In March 2016, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a proposal to ban their medical use and on December 19, 2016 passed a rule banning all powdered gloves intended for medical use. The rule became effective on January 18, 2017.

Powder-free medical gloves are used in medical cleanroom environments, where the need for cleanliness is often similar to that in a sensitive medical environment.

===Chlorination===
To make them easier to don without the use of powder, gloves can be treated with chlorine. Chlorination affects some of the beneficial properties of latex, but also reduces the quantity of allergenic latex proteins.

=== Polymer coating ===
On the market, it is a wide range of applications for polymer coatings in the market. Most of the current disposable gloves are powdered. These coatings include several polymers: silicone, acrylic resins, and gels that make gloves easier to wear. This process is currently used in nitrile gloves and latex gloves.

==Alternatives to latex==
Due to the increasing rate of latex allergy among health professionals, and in the general population, gloves made of non-latex materials such as polyvinyl chloride, nitrile rubber, or neoprene have become widely used. Chemical processes may be employed to reduce the amount of antigenic protein in Hevea latex, resulting in alternative natural-rubber-based materials such Vytex Natural Rubber Latex. However, non-latex gloves have not yet replaced latex gloves in surgical procedures, as gloves made of alternative materials generally do not fully match the fine control or greater sensitivity to touch available with latex surgical gloves. (High-grade isoprene gloves are the only exception to this rule, as they have the same chemical structure as natural latex rubber. However, fully artificial polyisoprene—rather than &quot;hypoallergenic&quot; cleaned natural latex rubber—is also the most expensive natural latex substitute available.) Other high-grade non-latex gloves, such as nitrile gloves, can cost over twice the price of their latex counterparts, a fact that has often prevented switching to these alternative materials in cost-sensitive environments, such as many hospitals. Nitrile is more resistant to tearing than natural latex, and is more resistant to many chemicals. Sulfur compounds used as accelerants to cure nitrile can speed the tarnishing process in silver, so accelerant-free nitrile or other gloves must be used when handling objects made of these metals when this is not acceptable.

== Double gloving ==
Double gloving is the practice of wearing two layers of medical gloves to reduce the danger of infection from glove failure or penetration of the gloves by sharp objects during medical procedures. Surgeons double glove when operating on individuals bearing infectious agents such as HIV and hepatitis, and to better protect patients against infections possibly transmitted by the surgeon. A systematic review of the literature has shown double gloving to offer significantly more protection against inner glove perforation in surgical procedures compared to the use of a single glove layer. But it was unclear if there was better protection against infections transmitted by the surgeon. Another systematic review studied if double gloving protected the surgeon better against infections transmitted by the patient. Pooled results of 12 studies (RCTs) with 3,437 participants showed that double gloving reduced the number of perforations in inner gloves with 71% compared to single gloving. On average ten surgeons/nurses involved in 100 operations sustain 172 single gloves perforations but with double gloves only 50 inner gloves would be perforated. This is a considerable reduction of the risk.

In addition, cotton gloves can be worn under the single-use gloves to reduce the amount of sweat produced when wearing these gloves for a long period of time. These under gloves can be disinfected and used again.

<doc id="1009913" wikidata="Q335598" url="?curid=1009913" title="Derek Sherinian">
<text>Derek Sherinian (born August 25, 1966) is an American keyboardist who has toured and recorded for Alice Cooper, Billy Idol, and Joe Bonamassa, among others. He was also a member of Dream Theater from 1994 to 1999, is the founder of Planet X and also one of the founding members of Black Country Communion, Sons of Apollo, and Whom Gods Destroy. He has released nine solo albums that have featured a variety of prominent guest musicians, including guitarists Slash, Yngwie Malmsteen, Allan Holdsworth, Steve Lukather, Joe Bonamassa, Michael Schenker, Steve Vai and Al Di Meola, and drummer Simon Phillips.

Sherinian has distinguished himself by his versatility, and aggressive &quot;guitaristic&quot; approach to his signature keyboard style. MusicRadar.com declared, &quot;A true shredder, his virtuoso playing has seen him dubbed the keyboard-playing version of Eddie Van Halen.&quot; In 2021, he was voted &quot;Greatest Keyboardist Of The 21st Century&quot;, and #8 Greatest of All Time by MusicRadar.com. Sherinian was voted #1 Keyboardist in Japan&#x27;s BURRN! Magazine in 2020, 2022, and 2023. In 2018, he was voted #9 Greatest Keyboardist Ever in &quot;Prog&quot; magazine. He has also appeared on the cover of numerous keyboard magazines around the world, including the November 2011 issue of &quot;Keyboard&quot;, which declared Sherinian a &quot;Keyboard Hero for a New Generation&quot;. He has also been called the &quot;King of the Keys&quot; by &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine and the &quot;Caligula of Keyboards&quot; by Alice Cooper. His musical influences include Elton John, Edward Van Halen and Jan Hammer.

==Early life==

Born in Laguna Beach, California, Sherinian is of Greek and Armenian descent. He began taking piano lessons at age five in Santa Cruz, California. After his junior year at Soquel High School, he received a scholarship to the Berklee College of Music in Boston where he attended with future Megadeth guitarist and Trans-Siberian Orchestra musical director Al Pitrelli, and Living Colour drummer Will Calhoun. He has since studied with other keyboardists, including Mitchel Forman, T Lavitz, Russell Ferrante, and Alex Alessandroni.

== Professional career ==
===Buddy Miles===
Sherinian&#x27;s first professional gig after leaving Boston was in 1988 with ex-Jimi Hendrix Band of Gypsies drummer Buddy Miles touring the Chitlin&#x27; Circuit. Sherinian paid tribute to Miles covering his song &quot;Them Changes&quot; featuring Joe Bonamassa on his 2020 solo album &quot;The Phoenix&quot;.

===Alice Cooper===
Sherinian received his first big break with Alice Cooper in 1989 to tour in support of the platinum selling Trash album. Sherinian toured and recorded with Cooper on and off until 1998. Cooper said of Sherinian, &quot;Derek Sherinian will be at least one chapter in my book when I write my autobiography. He is the Caligula of the keyboards. He was born with the rock star charisma. Reeking of self-esteem, he walked into our first rehearsal for the &#x27;Trash&#x27; tour and flawlessly auditioned by playing every classic Bob Ezrin keyboard part to the note. Ten years later and thousands of exchanged poker chips later, the two of us have probably broken even. He once pulled four twos on the bullet train from Japan, and won a huge poker pot. I&#x27;ll always remember that day... him jumping up on the very conservative bullet train, screaming that he&#x27;d pulled four twos, which is an awfully good hand in poker.

===Dream Theater===

In 1994, Sherinian replaced Kevin Moore in the progressive metal band Dream Theater, originally for the band&#x27;s promotional tour for &quot;Awake&quot;. In February 1995, he was made a full-time member of the band. Dream Theater guitarist John Petrucci added &quot;...Derek -considering the fact that he&#x27;s heavily into guitarists and rock music, his history, and the range of all the great guitarists he&#x27;s worked with —plays with a fire unheard of from most keyboardists.&quot; He recorded the albums &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot; (1995), &quot;Falling into Infinity&quot; (1997), and &quot;Once in a LIVEtime&quot; (1998) with Dream Theater before being replaced in January 1999 by Jordan Rudess due to creative differences and turmoil within the band. 
Sherinian reunited with Dream Theater for a one-off concert in 2004, which was recorded and released as When Dream and Day Reunite (2004). The band&#x27;s performance of &quot;Metropolis Pt. 1&quot; featured an extended improvisation between Sherinian, Rudess, and guitarist John Petrucci.

During the late 1990s, Sherinian released two albums with the progressive rock supergroup Platypus, which featured Dream Theater bassist John Myung, Dixie Dregs drummer Rod Morgenstein, and King&#x27;s X guitarist Ty Tabor. The group released two albums, t (1998) and &quot;Ice Cycles&quot; (2000), before disbanding in 2000.
In 2002, he was part of the band Jughead, which also included Tabor, bassist/vocalist Matt Bissonette and drummer Gregg Bissonette.
In January 2012, Sherinian performed at two shows with instrumental supergroup Mike Portnoy, Billy Sheehan, and Tony MacAlpine (PSMS) for the Guitar Center Drum Off, and Sabian Live. In the fall of that year, PSMS began rehearsing for a tour and a video of their rehearsal was released on DVD as &quot;InstruMENTAL Inspiration&quot;. They toured Europe and Asia concluding with a live DVD/CD &quot;Live in Tokyo&quot; released on September 24, 2013. In 2014, PSMS performed two songs at the TAMA 40th Anniversary Party at the NAMM Show on January 25, and also the Progressive Nation at Sea cruise on the Norwegian Pearl February 18–22, co-promoted by Sherinian and Portnoy.

===Michael Schenker===
In 2021, Michael Schenker invited Sherinian to guest on his album &quot;Immortal&quot; album on the opening song &quot;Drilled To Kill&quot;. Schenker said of Sherinian, &quot;Derek and myself trading solos, it sounds unexpected and beyond my expectation,&quot; Michael says. &quot;Absolutely fantastic!&quot;

In 2022, Schenker returned the favor by guesting on Sherinian&#x27;s &quot;Vortex&quot; album on the song &quot;Die Kobra&quot;.
In 2024, Sherinian appeared on Schenker&#x27;s &quot;My Years With UFO&quot; album.

===Yngwie Malmsteen===
Sherinian joined Malmsteen&#x27;s band in August 2001 for a South American tour. After the tour, Sherinian and Malmsteen performed on each other&#x27;s albums. Sherinian on Malmsteen&#x27;s &quot;Attack!&quot;,and Malmsteen performed on Sherinian&#x27;s &quot;Black Utopia&quot; album.
Sherinian joined Malmsteen again in 2006 for a North American Tour, and shows in Finland, and Russia. Again, they recorded for each other, Sherinian on Malmsteen&#x27;s &quot;Perpetual Burn&quot;, and Malmsteen on Sherinian&#x27;s &quot;Blood Of The Snake&quot;. 
1n 2017, Malmsteen and Sherinian rejoined the Generation Axe Asia Tour, featuring Zakk Wylde, Steve Vai, Nuno Bettencourt, and Tosin Abasi.

===Solo career===

Since 1999, Sherinian has recorded nine solo albums, featuring performances by highly acclaimed musicians.

Sherinian&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Planet X&quot; (1999), written and recorded with Australian drummer Virgil Donati, led to the formation of a band of the same name (Planet X). Guitar virtuoso Tony MacAlpine was recruited to complete the band. Sherinian has stated that his intention when forming Planet X was to create a group of musicians that &quot;played their instruments so fiercely that they would strike fear in the hearts of all musicians&quot;. In 2017, the short documentary &quot;Return to Planet X&quot; reflected on the making of this album.

In 2001, Sherinian teamed with drummer Simon Phillips and guitarists Steve Lukather and Zakk Wylde to record &quot;Inertia&quot;, followed by &quot;Black Utopia&quot; (2003). For &quot;Black Utopia&quot;, three new faces joined Sherinian&#x27;s group: bassist Billy Sheehan, rock guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen, and jazz fusion guitarist Al Di Meola. With respect to this fusion-influenced lineup, Sherinian stated:
Sherinian also called the album &quot;a lot darker and heavier than [&quot;Inertia&quot;]&quot;.

Sherinian extended further into the fusion realm by collaborating with guitarist Allan Holdsworth and violinist Jerry Goodman (formerly of the Mahavishnu Orchestra) on &quot;Mythology&quot; (2004). In addition to another appearance by Phillips, other musicians on the recording were Zakk Wylde, John Sykes, Steve Stevens, and Tony Franklin.
Holdsworth said of the session, &quot;When Derek was finishing his album, he told me he’d love for me to play a guitar solo on it, so I did. I recorded a solo for him in the specific length that he requested, and he put it on that track [which also features Zakk Wylde]. People have told me they really like that guitar solo, but I haven’t heard it in years so I don’t remember it. [laughs]&quot;

Since 2002, Sherinian has toured with several artists, including Billy Idol and Yngwie Malmsteen. Derek&#x27;s fifth solo album, &quot;Blood of the Snake&quot; (2006), features contributions from Idol, as well as Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Slash, John Petrucci of Dream Theater, and Brian Tichy; Phillips, Franklin and Lukather make return appearances. A video for a cover version of Mungo Jerry&#x27;s &quot;In the Summertime&quot; was released along with the album. Sherinian also worked with duduk master Djivan Gasparyan on the song &quot;Prelude To Battle&quot; on the release, written for his great-grandmother who survived the Armenian genocide. In 2009, Sherinian released his sixth solo album, &quot;Molecular Heinosity&quot;, again featuring Zakk Wylde, Tony Franklin and Brian Tichy. Later that year, Sherinian performed a one-off acoustic gig with Alice in Chains to launch their &quot;Black Gives Way to Blue&quot; album.

In September 2011, Sherinian released his seventh solo album titled &quot;Oceana&quot;, reuniting with Simon Phillips and Steve Lukather, and featuring a guest appearance from BCC bandmate Joe Bonamassa.

In 2019, Sherinian signed a new solo deal with Sony Music, and released &quot;The Phoenix&quot; September 18, 2020. In 2022, Sherinian released his 9th solo album &quot;Vortex&quot;, with Simon Phillips, Michael Schenker, Nuno Bettencourt, Steve Stevens and Mike Stern. Sherinian/Phillips &quot;Live&quot; album was released in August 25, 2023.

===Black Country Communion===

In 2009, Sherinian became a founding member of supergroup Black Country Communion with Glenn Hughes, Jason Bonham, and Joe Bonamassa, releasing their debut &quot;Black Country&quot; in 2010. In 2011, he performed on a second Black Country Communion record titled &quot;2&quot;, followed by a nine-week tour of the United States and Europe. Sherinian recorded with Black Country Communion on their third studio release &quot;Afterglow&quot;. The band split up in September 2012 due to Bonamassa&#x27;s solo touring schedule. Sherinian went on to join Bonamassa&#x27;s solo band in July 2013 until December 2014. BCC reunited in 2017 to record their fourth album &quot;BCCIV&quot;. They released their 5th album &quot;BCCV&quot; in June 2024.

===Whitesnake===
Sherinian was hired by David Coverdale to replace the original keyboards on the previously released Whitesnake albums &quot;Slip of the Tongue&quot; and &quot;Restless Heart&quot;. Sherinian&#x27;s performances resulted on the &quot;Red, White, and Blues Trilogy&quot; compilation records, containing the albums &quot;The Rock Album&quot; (2020), &quot;Love Songs&quot; (2020), &quot;The Blues Album&quot; (2021), &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (2022) and &quot;The Purple Album: Special Gold Edition&quot; (2023 re-issue). Whitesnake singer David Coverdale explained, &quot;One of the things that&#x27;s very noticeable; it&#x27;s all &#x27;80s keyboards, which I can&#x27;t stand. They totally date it. Thank god, I found Derek Sherinian, who — and I know he won&#x27;t mind me saying this — Derek&#x27;s like the illegitimate son of Jon Lord. He just played his ass off for us, and you can hear it.&quot;

April 2004, Sherinian was invited by ex-Whitesnake guitarist John Sykes to play three shows in Japan with Marco Mendoza bass, Tommy Aldridge on drums. The live album John Sykes (2004) &quot;Bad Boy Live&quot; was from this tour. Sykes later guested on the song &quot;God of War&quot; with Zakk Wylde on Sherinian&#x27;s (2004) &quot;Mythology&quot; record.

===Sons of Apollo===
In August 2017, he and Mike Portnoy joined forces to form a progressive metal supergroup named Sons of Apollo and also featuring Billy Sheehan, vocalist Jeff Scott Soto and guitarist Ron &quot;Bumblefoot&quot; Thal. Sons of Apollo released their debut album &quot;Psychotic Symphony&quot; on October 21, 2017, followed by a world tour of 83 shows in 23 countries. Sons of Apollo released their second album, &quot;MMXX&quot;, in January 2020 co-produced once again by Sherinian and Mike Portnoy.

===Whom Gods Destroy===
In December 2023, Sherinian and guitarist Ron &quot;Bumblefoot&quot; Thal unveiled a new progressive metal project named &quot;Whom Gods Destroy&quot;. They announced Dino Jelusick on vocal duties, along with Yas Nomura on bass, and Bruno Valverde as their drummer. Their debut album &quot;Insanium&quot; was released March 2024. 

===Guest live appearances===
====Kiss====
On the recommendation of Eric Singer, Sherinian was hired to play off-stage keyboards on Kiss&#x27; Revenge Tour. Sherinian is on the &quot;Alive III&quot; live album and also guested with Kiss on the song &quot;Do You Remember Rock &amp; Roll Radio?&quot; on the Ramones tribute album &quot;We&#x27;re a Happy Family&quot;, and &quot;Alive IV&quot;.

====Alice in Chains====
July 14, 2009, Sherinian performed a one-off acoustic gig at Ricardo Montalbán Theatre in Hollywood with Alice in Chains to launch their &quot;Black Gives Way to Blue&quot; album.

====Dorians====
September 10, 2012, Sherinian was special guest to the Armenian band Dorians performing a concert in Yerevan and the first rock concert ever in Artsakh. On September 13, 2012 Glenn Hughes and Sherinian met Bako Sahakyan, the president of de facto independent Nagorno-Karabakh Republic and organized a concert there. After his visit to Artsakh, Sherinian was placed on the Azerbaijan black list due to conflict between the two countries.

====Black Label Society====
March 6, 2013, Sherinian was a special guest keyboardist with Black Label Society for their &quot;Unblackened&quot; acoustic set at the Club Nokia in Los Angeles. The performance aired live on AXS TV, and was released in September 2013 on CD/DVD/Blu-ray formats. Zakk Wylde officially &quot;patched&quot; Sherinian in as president of the Black Label Society Burbank Chapter.

====Tony MacAlpine Benefit====
December 12, 2015, Sherinian co-organized and participated in the Tony MacAlpine Benefit Concert at the Wiltern Theater in L.A. backing up Zakk Wylde along with Mike Portnoy and Billy Sheehan.

====Joe Satriani====
In August 2023, guitarist Joe Satriani invited Derek to play four East Coast concerts with him, which included drummer Kenny Aronoff on drums.

====Generation Axe====
Sherinian was personally invited by guitarists Steve Vai, and Yngwie Malmsteen to join the Generation Axe Asia / A Night of Guitars Tour also featuring Zakk Wylde, Nuno Bettencourt, and Tosin Abasi.

==Influences and acclaim from other artists==

In a 2000 interview, Sherinian cited his early keyboard influences as being Jan Hammer (Mahavishnu Orchestra), Jon Lord (Deep Purple), Keith Emerson (Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer and The Nice), Rick Wakeman (Yes), and Elton John. Other influences include guitarists Allan Holdsworth, Jeff Beck, and Eddie Van Halen. Sherinian said,&quot; When it comes to soloing, I have always been influenced and inspired by the great guitarists, specifically Edward Van Halen, Allan Holdsworth, Yngwie Malmsteen, Randy Rhoads, Jeff Beck, Michael Schenker. You can hear elements of all of these players in my DNA. I have managed to take my favorite qualities of all these great players, and process through my instrument, creating a totally unique signature style.&quot; Sherinian enjoys co-writing material with fellow musicians, and often finds that he writes better material with drummers. Sherinian cites Van Halen&#x27;s guitar playing as having a direct influence on his aggressive unique approach to keyboards in terms of technique as well as tone; his unique signature lead patches contain numerous elements of guitar sounds such as distortion, harmonics, and palm-muting, eventually leading to playing a gig with Eddie for a party at Van Halen&#x27;s home in 2006, of which Sherinian said &quot;It was the highlight of my career, it was completely surreal.&quot; Sherinian&#x27;s work with noted Toto guitarist Steve Lukather on the 2001 solo CD &quot;Inertia&quot; was cited by Lukather as &quot;probably my best recorded work in my whole career. Great record! I&#x27;m very proud of it!&quot;.

Sherinian&#x27;s collaborations with top musicians were featured in a 2007 article in &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine, where guitarist Zakk Wylde offered, &quot;People want to play with him because he&#x27;s that good. He can play everything from the easiest licks on a piano to the most complex Beethoven sonatas with ease.&quot; Sherinian explains that he enlists a variety of guitarists because he &quot;[does not] think there is one guitarist who can cover all the styles featured on [the] albums.&quot; Sherinian often tailors songs for specific guitarists, such as Holdsworth and Wylde for &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; (off &quot;Mythology&quot;); in this respect, he seeks to take certain aspects of genres and make them &quot;collide in an eloquent way&quot;.

==Equipment==
Sherinian uses vintage instruments, primarily the Hammond organ, Moog, Rhodes, and Nord Lead 3 mixed in with some modern sounds. Sherinian was presented the G2 Modular synth serial number 001 by Clavia representative Bengt Lilja in January 2004. As a Korg endorsee, Sherinian was one of the first artists to adopt the Korg Trinity keyboard series in 1996. In collaboration with KORG sound designer Jack Hotop, they created Sherinian&#x27;s signature &quot;guitaristic&quot; lead sound (the &quot;Monster Lead&quot;, made famous on the Dream Theater album &quot;Falling into Infinity&quot;) on the Trinity, as well as other, more &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;aggressive&quot; keyboard patches, owing to his fondness of guitar tones and technique.
He also uses the Hammond B3 organ; he thinks that &quot;every rock keyboardist should have a B3 and overdriven Leslie as part of their sound.&quot;

Sherinian is also known for being one of the first keyboardists to use vertical keyboard stands, influencing a new generation of keyboardists.

<text>Sarandë (; ; ) is a city in the Republic of Albania and the seat of Sarandë Municipality. Geographically, the city is located on an open sea gulf of the Ionian Sea within the Mediterranean Sea. Stretching along the Albanian Ionian Sea Coast, Sarandë has a Mediterranean climate with over 300 sunny days a year.

In ancient times, the city was known as Onchesmus or Onchesmos and was a port-town of Chaonia in ancient Epirus. It owes its modern name to the nearby Byzantine monastery of the Forty Saints (Agioi Saranda) by which it became known from the High Middle Ages. Sarandë today is known for its deep blue Mediterranean waters. Near Sarandë are the remains of the ancient city of Butrint, a UNESCO World Heritage site. In recent years, Sarandë has seen a steady increase in tourists, many of them coming by cruise ships. Visitors are attracted by the natural environment of Sarandë and its archaeological sites. Sarandë is inhabited by a majority of ethnic Albanians, and also has a minority Greek community and as such has been considered one of the two centers of the Greek minority in Albania.

== Etymology ==

&quot;Saranda&quot; is named after the Byzantine monastery of the &quot;Agioi Saranda&quot;, meaning the &quot;Forty Saints&quot; in Greek, in honor of the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste. Under Ottoman rule, the town in the Turkish language became known as &quot;Aya Sarandi&quot; and then &quot;Sarandoz&quot;. Owing to Venetian influence in the region, it often appeared under its Italian name &quot;Santi Quaranta&quot; on Western maps. This usage continued even after the establishment of the Principality of Albania, owing to the first Italian occupation of the region. During the Italian occupation of Albania in World War II, Benito Mussolini changed the name to &quot;Porto Edda&quot;, in honor of his eldest daughter. Following the restoration of Albanian independence, the city reverted to its Albanian name &quot;Saranda&quot;.

== History ==

=== Early history ===

Due to the archaic features found in the Ancient Greek name of the city: Onchesmos () (latinized form: Onchesmus) and the toponyms of the surrounding region it appears that the site was part of a proto-Greek area in late 3rd-early 2nd millennium BC. Bronze Age tools typical of Mycenaean Greece have been unearthed in Sarandë which date c. 1400-1100 BC. In antiquity the city was known by the name of &quot;Onchesmus&quot; or &quot;Onchesmos&quot; and was a port-town of Chaonia in ancient Epirus, opposite the northwestern point of Corcyra, and the next port upon the coast to the south of Panormus. It was inhabited by the ancient Greek tribe of the Chaonians. Onchesmos flourished as the port of the Chaonian capital Phoenice (modern-day Finiq). It seems to have been a place of importance in the time of Cicero, and one of the ordinary points of departure from Epirus to Italy, as Cicero calls the wind favourable for making that passage an &quot;Onchesmites&quot;. According to Dionysius of Halicarnassus the real name of the place was the Port of Anchises (Ἀγχίσου λιμήν), named after Anchises, the father of Aeneas; and it was probably owing to this tradition that the name Onchesmus assumed the form of &quot;Anchiasmus&quot; or &quot;Anchiasmos&quot; () under the Byzantine Empire.

Saranda, then under the name of Onchesmos, is held to be the site of Albania&#x27;s first synagogue, which was built in the 4th or 5th century. It is thought that it was built by the descendants of Jewish captives who arrived on the southern shores of Albania around 70 CE, during the First Jewish–Roman War. Onchesmos&#x27; synagogue was supplanted by a church in the 6th century.

The city was probably raided by the Ostrogoths in 551 CE, while during this period it became also the target of piratic raids by Gothic ships. In a medieval chronicle of 1191 the settlement appears to be abandoned, while its former name (Anchiasmos) isn&#x27;t mentioned any more. From that year, the toponym borrows the name of the nearby Orthodox basilica church of &quot;Agioi Saranta&quot;, erected in the 6th century, ca. southeast of the modern town.

=== Modern history ===

In the early 19th century during the rule of Ali Pasha, British diplomat William Martin Leake reported that there existed a small settlement under the name Skala or Skaloma next to the harbor. Following the Ottoman administrative reform of 1867, a müdürluk (independent unit) of Sarandë consisting of no other villages was created within the kaza (district) of Delvinë. Sarandë in the late Ottoman period until the Balkan Wars (1912–1913) consisted of only a harbour being a simple commercial station without permanent residents or any institutional community organisation. The creation of the Saranda müdürluk was related to the desires of Ottoman authorities to upgrade the port and reduce the economic dependence of the area on Ioannina and Preveza. In 1878, a Greek rebellion broke out, with revolutionaries taking control of Sarandë and Delvinë. This was suppressed by Ottoman troops, who burned twenty villages in the region. One of the earliest photographs of Saranda dates from 3 March 1913 and shows Greek soldiers in the main street during the course of the Second Balkan War. Saranda was an important city in the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus.

Greek troops occupied it during the Balkan Wars. Later, the town was included in the newly formed Albanian state on 17 December 1913 under the terms of the Protocol of Florence. The decision was rejected by the local Greek population, and as the Greek army withdrew to the new border, the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus was established. In May 1914, negotiations were started in Sarandë between representative of the provisional government of Northern Epirus and that of Albania which continued in nearby Corfu and ended up with the recognition of the Northern Epirote autonomy inside the newly established Albanian state.

It was then occupied by Italy between 1916 and 1920 as part of the Italian Protectorate on southern Albania. Throughout 1926–1939 of the interwar period, Italy financed extensive improvements to the harbour at Sarandë. A small Romanian Institute was established in 1938. Sarandë was again occupied by Italian forces in 1939, and was a strategic port during the Italian invasion of Greece. During this occupation, it was called &quot;Porto Edda&quot; in honor of the eldest daughter of Benito Mussolini.

During the Greco-Italian War, the city came under the control of the advancing Greek forces, on 6 December 1940. The capture of this strategic port further accelerated the Greek penetration to the north. As a result of the German invasion in Greece in April 1941, the town returned to Italian control. On 9 October 1944 the town was captured by a group of British commandos under Brigadier Tom Churchill and local partisans of LANÇ under Islam Radovicka. The actions of the British troops was viewed with suspicion by LANÇ as they suspected that the British would occupy the town to use as a base and provide aid to their allies in the Greek resistance in the area as British documents indicated that EDES forces also joined the operation. However, the British troops soon withdrew from the region, leaving the region to the Albanian communist forces.

As part of the People&#x27;s Republic of Albania (1945-1991) policies a number of Muslim Albanians were settled from northern Albania in the area and local Christians are no longer the only community in Saranda. During this period as a result of the atheistic campaign launched by the state the church of Saint Spyridon in the harbor of the city was demolished. After the restoration of democracy in Albania (1991) a small shrine was erected at the place of the church.

In 1992, during the escalation of violence against ethnic Greek communities in southern Albania, incidents included the burning down of Greek shops in the city harbour and vandalization of the Omonoia organization offices (the latter being the political party of the Greeks in the country).

During the 1997 Albanian civil unrest, units comprised by the local Greek minority were able to achieve the first military success for the opposition through the capture of a government tank.

== Geography ==

Part of the Albanian Riviera, Sarandë is situated on the arch-shaped bay of Sarandë between the Gormarti and Berdeneshi Hills and the Albanian Ionian Sea Coast in southwestern Albania. Sarandë Municipality is encompassed in Vlorë County as part of the Southern Region of Albania and consists of the adjacent administrative units of Ksamil and Sarandë. Its total area is 58.96 km2.

=== Climate ===

Sarandë has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa) as of the Köppen climate classification.

== Economy ==


Given its coastal access and Mediterranean climate, Sarandë has become an important tourist attraction since the fall of communism in Albania. Saranda as well as the rest of the Albanian Riviera, according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;is set to become the new &quot;undiscovered gem&quot; of the overcrowded Med.&quot; Tourism is thus the major economic resource, while other resources include services, fisheries and construction. 
The unemployment rate according to the population census of 2008 was 8.32%. It has been suggested that family tourism and seasonal work during the summer period help mitigate the real unemployment rate. Recently, the town has experienced an uncontrolled construction boom which may hamper the city&#x27;s future tourism potential. 
Since 2012, the Port of Saranda is undergoing an expansion to accommodate cruise ships at its terminal.
=== Tourism ===
Sarandë is viewed as the unofficial capital of the Albanian Riviera, and can be used as a base for excursions along it.

The region is prosperous with varied attractions and activities relating to nature and wildlife. Notable sights include the ancient archaeological site of Butrint and the Blue Eye Spring. Ksamil is notable for its beaches and islets.

== Demography ==

During the late Ottoman period until the Balkan Wars (1912–1913) Sarandë consisted of only a harbour and was without permanent residents. In 1912, right after the Albanian Declaration of Independence, the settlement had only 110 inhabitants. At the 1927 census, it had 810 inhabitants, but was not yet a town. In the 1930s, it had a good demographic development, and it is in this period that the first public buildings and the main roads were constructed. In 1957, the city had 8,700 inhabitants and was made the center of a district. The population of Sarandë was exclusively Christian. A Muslim community was settled in the city as part of the resettlement policies during the People&#x27;s Republic of Albania (1945–1991). The total population is 20,227 (2011 census), in a total area of 70.13 km2. The population of the former municipality at the 2011 census was 17,233. The population according to the civil offices, which record all citizens including those living abroad, is 41,173 (2013 estimate).

According to a survey by the Albanian Helsinki Committee, in 1990 Sarandë numbered 17,000 inhabitants, of whom 7,500 belonged to the Greek minority. The members of the Greek minority of the city, prior to the collapse of the socialist regime (1991), were deprived from their minority rights, since Sarandë did not belong to the &quot;minority areas&quot;. In fieldwork undertaken by Greek scholar Leonidas Kallivretakis in the area during 1992 noted that Saranda&#x27;s mixed ethno-linguistic composition (total population in 1992: 17,555) consisted of 8,055 Muslim Albanians, 6,500 Greeks and an Orthodox Albanian population of 3,000. Statistics from the same study showed that, including the surround villages, Sarande commune had a population consisting of 43% Albanian Muslims, 14% Albanian Christians, 41% Greek Christians, and 2% Aromanian Christians. In the early 1990s, the local Orthodox Albanian population mainly voted for political parties of the Greek minority based in the Saranda area.

Sarandë is considered one of the two centers of the Greek minority in Albania, Gjirokastër being the other. According to the representatives of the Greek minority 42% of the town&#x27;s population belong to the local Greek community. Since the 1990s the population of Sarandë has nearly doubled. According to official estimation in 2013, the population of the city is 41,173. According to a survey conducted by the Albanian Committee of Helsinki, in 2001 the Albanian population numbered about 26,500, while Greeks formed the rest with about 3,400 alongside a small number of Vlachs and Roma. The city, according to the Albanian Committee of Helsinki, has lost more than half of its ethnic Greeks from 1991 to 2001, because of heavy emigration to Greece. According to official estimates of 2014 the number of the Greek community in the former municipality is 7,920, not to count those who live in the wider current municipality (including additionally 4,207 in Ksamil). Two schools/classes in Greek attended by a total of 217 students existed in the Saranda municipality as of 2014. Other minorities include Aromanians, Roma and Ashkali.

<text>The Tenterfield Oration was a speech delivered by Sir Henry Parkes, Premier of the Colony of New South Wales, at the Tenterfield School of Arts in Tenterfield, New South Wales, Australia, on 24 October 1889.

In the oration, Parkes called for the Federation of the six Australian colonies, which were then self-governing but remained under the authority of the British Colonial Secretary. The speech is regarded as the catalyst for the federation process in Australia, ultimately leading to the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia 12 years later, in 1901.

==Background==
The northern region of the New South Wales suffered from administrative disunity, as it was geographically distant from the colony&#x27;s capital, Sydney, yet closer to commercial hubs across the border in Queensland. The imposition of border import tariffs by Queensland further complicated trade, frustrating many in neighboring districts who strongly supported free trade.

The primary reason given by Premier Parkes for federation in the Tenterfield Oration was the necessity of a united defence of the Australian continent. In a 1999 address, Bob Carr, Premier of New South Wales from 1995 to 2005, compared the significance of the Tenterfield Oration for Australia to that of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Gettysburg Address in the United States.

At Tenterfield, Parkes urged the seven colonies (including the Colony of New Zealand) to &quot;unite and create a great national government for all Australia.&quot; He explicitly cited the United States as an inspiration, emphasizing its achievement of independence from British rule. This call for unity resonated deeply with the colonists. The speech was widely published in Australian newspapers, and Parkes&#x27; subsequent efforts in petitioning the Queen and drafting the Constitution earned him the title of &quot;Father of Federation.&quot;

The site of the Tenterfield Oration was formally commemorated by the Commonwealth Governor-General in 1946.

Prompted by Parkes&#x27; Tenterfield Oration, the colonies agreed to send delegates to a Constitutional Conference in Melbourne in 1890. This initiated the process of drafting and adopting the Commonwealth Constitution over the course of the 1890s, ultimately leading to the unification of the colonies and the establishment of a system of federalism in Australia.

== The Speech ==
The speech referred to the Parliament of New South Wales and the Parliament of Queensland, and quoted the poem &quot;The Dominion&quot; by James Brunton Stephens:

<doc id="1009925" wikidata="Q4789039" url="?curid=1009925" title="Arent S. Crowninshield">
<text>Arent Schuyler Crowninshield (March 14, 1843 – May 27, 1908) was a rear admiral of the United States Navy. He saw combat during the Civil War, and after the war held high commands both afloat and ashore.

==Early life==
Born in New York, he was the grandson of Jacob Crowninshield (appointed Navy secretary under President Jefferson, but who died before taking up the office), and grandnephew of George Crowninshield Jr. (adventuring owner of &quot;Cleopatra&#x27;s Barge&quot;, first yacht to cross the Atlantic) and Benjamin Williams Crowninshield, United States Secretary of the Navy from 1815 to 1818. Some sources give his first name as Alton.

==Education and career==
Arent graduated from the United States Naval Academy on May 28, 1863 and immediately went into action in the American Civil War, participating in the assault on Fort Fisher while serving on the steam sloop .
After the war, he rose steadily through the ranks, becoming lieutenant on November 10, 1866, and commander on March 25, 1880.

He commanded the training ship from 1878 to 1881, the school ship of the New York Nautical School from 1887 to 1891, and the sloop-of-war from February 1892 to November 1893.

Promoted to captain on July 21, 1894, he took command of the new battleship at her commissioning in 1895, leaving in 1897 to become chief of the Bureau of Navigation with the rank of Rear Admiral.

During the 1898 Spanish–American War, Crowninshield was appointed to the Naval War Board, and had a large part in the United States Naval operations planning that resulted in resounding victories like the Battle of Manila Bay. He retired from the Navy in April 1902, completing 39 years on active service.

Admiral Crowninshield was a member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.

Rear Admiral Crowninshield died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on May 27, 1908, and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

==Personal life==
He married Mary Bradford (1844–1913), daughter of the writer Sarah Hopkins Bradford, in Dresden, Germany, on July 27, 1870. His wife became a published writer herself.

<doc id="1009951" wikidata="Q187542" url="?curid=1009951" title="Li–Fraumeni syndrome">
<text>Li–Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare, autosomal dominant, hereditary disorder that predisposes carriers to cancer development. It was named after two American physicians, Frederick Pei Li and Joseph F. Fraumeni Jr., who first recognized the syndrome after reviewing the medical records and death certificates of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma patients. The disease is also known as SBLA, for the Sarcoma, Breast, Leukemia, and Adrenal Gland cancers that it is known to cause.

== Etiology ==
LFS is caused by germline mutations (also called genetic variants) in the &quot;TP53&quot; tumor suppressor gene, which encodes a transcription factor (p53) that normally regulates the cell cycle and prevents genomic mutations. The variants can be inherited, or can arise from mutations early in embryogenesis, or in one of the parent&#x27;s germ cells.

LFS is thought to occur in about 1 in 5,000 individuals in the general population. In Brazil there is a common founder variant, p.Arg337, that occurs in about 1 in every 375 people.  LFS is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion which means that a person with LFS has a 50% chance to pass the syndrome on in every pregnancy (and a 50% chance to &quot;not&quot; pass on the syndrome).

==Clinical presentation==

Li–Fraumeni syndrome is characterized by early onset of cancer, a wide variety of types of cancers, and development of multiple cancers throughout one&#x27;s life.

LFS: Mutations in &quot;TP53&quot;

&quot;TP53 &quot;is a tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 17 that normally assists in the control of cell division and growth through action on the normal cell cycle. &quot;TP53&quot; typically becomes expressed due to cellular stressors, such as DNA damage, and can halt the cell cycle to assist with either the repair of repairable DNA damage, or can induce apoptosis of a cell with irreparable damage. The repair of &quot;bad&quot; DNA, or the apoptosis of a cell, prevents the proliferation of damaged cells and the development of cancer.

Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in the &quot;TP53&quot; gene can inhibit its normal function and allow cells with damaged DNA to continue to divide. If these DNA mutations are left unchecked, some cells can divide uncontrollably, forming tumors (cancers). Many individuals with Li–Fraumeni syndrome have been shown to be heterozygous for a &quot;TP53&quot; variant. Recent studies have shown that 60% to 80% of classic LFS families harbor detectable germ-line &quot;TP53&quot; mutations, the majority of which are missense mutations in the DNA-binding domain. These missense mutations cause a decrease in the ability of p53 to bind to DNA, thus inhibiting the normal &quot;TP53&quot; mechanism.

LFS-Like (LFS-L):

Families who do not conform to the criteria of classical Li–Fraumeni syndrome have been termed &quot;LFS-Like&quot;. LFS-L individuals generally do not have any detectable &quot;TP53&quot; variants, and tend to meet either the Birch or Eeles criteria.

===Clinical===

The classical LFS malignancies—sarcoma, cancers of the breast, brain, and adrenal glands—comprise about 80% of all cancers that occur in this syndrome.

The risk of developing any invasive cancer (excluding skin cancer) is about 50% by age 30 (1% in the general population) and is 90% by age 70. Early-onset breast cancer accounts for 25% of all the cancers in this syndrome. This is followed by soft-tissue sarcomas (20%), bone sarcoma (15%), and brain tumors—especially glioblastomas—(13%). Other tumours seen in this syndrome include leukemia, lymphoma, and adrenocortical carcinoma.

The table below depicts tumor site distribution of variants for families followed in the LFS Study at the National Cancer Institute&#x27;s (NCI) Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG): 
About 95% of females with LFS develop breast cancer by age 60 years; the majority of these occur before age 45 years lending females with this syndrome to have almost a 100% lifetime risk of developing cancer.

Cancer Risks by Sex and Age

Age          20 years old       40 years old      60 years old

Men        25%                     40%                     88%

Women  18%                     75%                     &gt;95%

==Diagnosis==
Germline variants in the &quot;TP53&quot; tumor suppressor gene was discovered to be the primary cause of Li–Fraumeni syndrome in 1990.

Li–Fraumeni syndrome is diagnosed if a person has a pathogenic or likely pathogenic &quot;TP53&quot; variant and/or if these three Classic Criteria are met:
* The patient has been diagnosed with a sarcoma at a young age (below 45).
* A first-degree relative has been diagnosed with any cancer at a young age (below 45).
* Another first- or a second-degree relative has been diagnosed with any cancer at a young age (below 45) or with a sarcoma at any age.

LFS should also be suspected in individuals who meet other published criteria.

2015 Revised Chompret Criteria:

* A proband with a tumor belonging to the LFS tumor spectrum (premenopausal breast cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, osteosarcoma, central nervous system (CNS) tumor, adrenocortical carcinoma) before age 46 years AND at least one first- or second-degree relative with an LFS tumor (except breast cancer if the proband has breast cancer) before age 56 years or with multiple tumors; OR
* A proband with multiple tumors (except multiple breast tumors), two of which belong to the LFS tumor spectrum and the first of which occurred before age 46 years; OR
* A proband with adrenocortical carcinoma, choroid plexus tumor, or rhabdomyosarcoma of embryonal anaplastic subtype, irrespective of family history; OR
* Breast cancer before age 31 years
Birch Criteria for Li Fraumeni-like syndrome:

* A proband with any childhood cancer, sarcoma, brain tumor, or adrenal cortical carcinoma diagnosed before age 45, AND
* A first- or second-degree relative with a typical LFS malignancy (sarcoma, leukemia, or cancers of the breast, brain or adrenal cortex) regardless of age at diagnosis, AND
* A first- or second-degree relative with any cancer diagnosed before age 60

Eeles Criteria for Li Fraumeni-like Syndrome:

* Two different tumors that are part of extended LFS in first- or second-degree relatives at any age (sarcoma, breast cancer, brain tumor, leukemia, adrenocortical carcinoma, melanoma, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer).

If an individual has a personal or family history concerning for LFS, they should discuss the risks, benefits, and limitations of genetic testing with their healthcare provider or a genetic counselor.

==Management==

Genetic counseling and genetic testing for the &quot;TP53&quot; gene can confirm a diagnosis of LFS. People with LFS require early and regular cancer screening following the &quot;Toronto Protocol&quot;:

* Children and adults undergo comprehensive annual physical examinations every 6 to 12 months
* All patients consult a physician promptly for evaluation of lingering symptoms and illnesses
* Ultrasound of abdomen and pelvis every 3 to 4 months from birth to age 18 years
* Colonoscopy and upper endoscopy every 2 to 5 years beginning at age 25 or 5 years before the earliest known GI cancer in the family
* Annual dermatological exam starting at age 18 years
* Annual whole-body MRI 
* Annual brain MRI and neurological exam
* Annual prostate-specific antigen (PA) starting at age 40
* Breast awareness beginning at age 18
* Clinical breast exam every 6 to 12 months starting at age 20
* Annual breast MRI age 20 to 29; annual breast MRI alternating with mammogram age 30 to 75
* Consideration of risk-reducing mastectomy (surgery to remove the breast tissue)
* Families and individuals should consider participating in a peer-support group

<doc id="1009975" wikidata="Q1135315" url="?curid=1009975" title="Survivor (band)">
<text>Survivor was an American rock band formed in Chicago in 1978 by Jim Peterik and Frankie Sullivan. The band achieved commercial success in the 1980s. with five top ten singles in the United States. The band is best known for their 1982 hit &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot;, the theme song for the film &quot;Rocky III&quot; which spent six weeks at number one in the US.

Dave Bickler was the band&#x27;s vocalist from 1978 to 1983, appearing on the band&#x27;s first four albums. He left the band after a vocal injury and was replaced by Jimi Jamison in 1984. With Jamison, the band had several hits including &quot;High on You&quot;, &quot;The Search Is Over&quot;, &quot;Burning Heart&quot; and &quot;Is This Love&quot; before going on hiatus in 1988. 

The band returned in 1993 with Bickler, but Jamison replaced him again in 2000. Their final album &quot;Reach&quot; (2006) was their first in 18 years. After the album, Jamison left the band and Robin McAuley became the singer. In 2011, Jamison returned for his third stint as vocalist. The band toured with both Bickler and Jamison on vocals in 2013, which lasted until Jamison&#x27;s death in 2014.

== 1978–1981: Origins and early albums ==
Before Survivor formed, Jim Peterik was the lead vocalist–guitarist for the band The Ides of March. Later, the Jim Peterik Band formed after Peterik had released his album &quot;Don&#x27;t Fight the Feeling&quot; on Epic Records in 1976. The liner notes of the album, written by Jim Charney, refer to Peterik as a &quot;survivor&quot;. This note inspired the name of Peterik&#x27;s next grouping.

Drummer Gary Smith and bassist Dennis Keith Johnson had both been members of Bill Chase&#x27;s jazz-rock fusion band Chase; Peterik had worked with Chase in 1974. One of the other inspirations for Peterik&#x27;s choice of the new band&#x27;s name was his narrow escape from death when he was unable to make a guest appearance at a Chase concert scheduled for Jackson, Minnesota on August 9, 1974. He ended up not being on the plane that crashed, killing Bill Chase and most of his band.

In 1978 the Jim Peterik Band had dissolved, and Jim was considering returning to singing and producing jingles. After several days of pleading with Peterik, road-manager/sound man Rick Weigand persuaded him to meet with guitarist Frankie Sullivan (ex-Mariah). Within an hour of that first meeting, the band Survivor was born. Johnson and Smith were recruited and Peterik brought in singer Dave Bickler (ex-Jamestown Massacre), who had worked with Peterik in Chicago on commercial jingles sessions. In May of 1978 the band played the Elgin High School (Illinois) Prom at the Blue Moon Ballroom in Elgin, Illinois. When the band returned after a break Dave Bickler was introducing the band members and said that from that point on the band would be called Survivor. 

In September 1978 Survivor played their first show, performing at Lyons Township High School in La Grange, Illinois. After they played in small clubs during the rest of that year (one venue was the original My Pi pizzeria near Loyola University Chicago, where they headlined every Saturday night in the upstairs bar area), Atlantic Records A&amp;R executive John Kalodner signed Survivor.
One of Survivor&#x27;s earliest performances (their second gig, according to Peterik&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Through the Eye of the Tiger&quot;), at Haymakers Rock Club in Wheeling, Illinois on September 15, 1978, has appeared as a bootleg recording in trader&#x27;s circles in recent years.

The group&#x27;s first album, the self-titled &quot;Survivor&quot;, was recorded in 1979 and released on the Atlantic subsidiary Scotti Bros. in February 1980. The album produced no Top 40 singles (&quot;Somewhere in America&quot; only managed to make number 70) and did not achieve the level of success that the band had hoped for.

On Survivor&#x27;s first album, Peterik played rhythm guitar. All keyboards were performed by lead singer Dave Bickler (who plays several instruments), but Peterik&#x27;s role quickly became backing vocals, keyboards and co-songwriter by 1981, with some keyboard parts being performed on records by session players per the producers.

In 1981 it was decided to let Johnson and Smith go as they had schedule conflicts with their other projects and were a bit &quot;too jazzy&quot; in their approach, according to Peterik. They were replaced by Sullivan&#x27;s friend and drummer Marc Droubay and bassist Stephan Ellis, whom Peterik and Sullivan had spotted playing in a band at Flipper&#x27;s Roller Boogie Palace in the Los Angeles, CA area.

Both Droubay and Ellis came aboard in time for the recording of the band&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;Premonition&quot; (August 1981). It charted higher, achieving popularity with American audiences, and gave the band its first Top 40 single, &quot;Poor Man&#x27;s Son&quot;. The album also showed off Bickler&#x27;s range as a vocalist with its second single, &quot;Summer Nights&quot; and fan favorite non-singles, like &quot;Heart&#x27;s A Lonely Hunter&quot;, &quot;Take You On A Saturday&quot;, &quot;Runway Lights&quot; and &quot;Love Is On My Side&quot;.

== 1982–1983: &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot; and &quot;Caught In The Game&quot; ==
In 1982, Survivor&#x27;s breakthrough arrived when actor Sylvester Stallone asked them to provide the theme song for his movie &quot;Rocky III&quot;. Stallone had heard &quot;Poor Man&#x27;s Son&quot; and wanted a song similar to it and to Queen&#x27;s &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot;. The band agreed to his request and soon came up with &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot;.

The new song featured a faster tempo than &quot;Poor Man&#x27;s Son&quot; while still incorporating the stylish, nearly identical power chords. It reached number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, remaining there for six weeks, and was in the Top 40 for a total of eighteen weeks. It also topped the British charts and was Australia&#x27;s number 1 single for four weeks.

&quot;Eye&quot; went on to win the band the Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, was voted Best New Song by the People&#x27;s Choice Awards and received an Academy Award nomination.

The album of the same title, &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot;, was released by the band in June 1982 and contained another Top 40 hit in the United States, &quot;American Heartbeat&quot; (number 17 US) and &quot;The One That Really Matters&quot; (number 74 US). The album charted at number 2 in the States.

In 1983, Survivor tried to duplicate the success of &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot; with their next release, &quot;Caught in the Game&quot; (September 1983). The album turned out to be a commercial disappointment, stalling at number 82 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the U.S., while the album&#x27;s title track peaked at number 77.

The band suffered a further setback when lead singer Dave Bickler suffered vocal problems and was required to undergo an operation to remove vocal cord nodules, a very common ailment in singers, that required rest which Peterik and Sullivan were unwilling to do. Bickler was fired and the band&#x27;s record label, yet again, failed to do much in the way of promotion of what many feel was a superior album overall to &quot;Eye Of The Tiger&quot; one year before. In early 1984, Bickler was replaced by Jimi Jamison of the bands Target and Cobra.

== 1984–1988: Jimi Jamison era ==
The band&#x27;s first song to feature Jimi Jamison was &quot;The Moment of Truth&quot;, the theme song of the box office smash hit &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; (1984), which peaked at number 63 on the Billboard Hot 100 in June 1984. Next came Survivor&#x27;s first album with Jamison, &quot;Vital Signs&quot; (August 1984), which provided the band with a massive comeback, peaking at number 16 on the Billboard Album Chart with the hits &quot;I Can&#x27;t Hold Back&quot; (number 13 US), &quot;High on You&quot; (number 8 US), and &quot;The Search Is Over&quot; (number 4 US). 

In 1985 the band went on tour with Bryan Adams, performing sold-out concerts at Nashville&#x27;s War Memorial Auditorium, the Dallas Convention Center, the San Antonio Convention Center and the Lakefront Arena in New Orleans. Later that year they had another hit with &quot;Burning Heart&quot;, a song from the &quot;Rocky IV&quot; soundtrack, which peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1986.

&quot;When Seconds Count&quot; was released in October 1986 and included the hit &quot;Is This Love&quot; (number 9 U.S.). On the Billboard Album Chart the album only reached number 49 but still managed to sell over 500,000 copies and reached certified gold status.

In 1987 bassist Ellis developed a stomach ulcer requiring the band&#x27;s head roadie, Rocko Reedy, to fill in on bass for a few dates. These health problems ultimately forced him out of the group. Drummer Droubay, who was becoming increasingly unhappy with the group&#x27;s shift to a more pop sound, was likewise released at the end of Survivor&#x27;s 1987 tour.

During pre-production of their seventh album, &quot;Too Hot to Sleep&quot; (October 1988), Ellis and Droubay were replaced by studio session veterans drummer Mickey Curry and bassist Bill Syniar, formerly of the band Tantrum. Sullivan produced the effort with Frank Filipetti. Though the album presented a harder-rocking Survivor, similar to the sound in the band&#x27;s early days, &quot;Too Hot to Sleep&quot; failed to make a significant dent on the chart (only number 187 US).

There were, reportedly, a few live dates done by the band during this period (including a stint as opening act for Cheap Trick on the &quot;Lap Of Luxury&quot; Tour of North America) that included Syniar on bass and Kyle Woodring on drums.

== 1988–2000: Hiatus, Bickler&#x27;s return and legal issues ==
After the disappointing sales of &quot;Too Hot to Sleep&quot;, Jamison decided to start work on a solo album and Peterik and Sullivan decided to put the band on indefinite hiatus in the fall of 1988. A &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation was released in late 1989.

Jamison&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;When Love Comes Down&quot;, was released in July 1991 and he decided to continue touring and playing Survivor songs with local musicians. Meanwhile, the Survivor rhythm section of Ellis and Droubay decided to form the group Club M.E.D. with guitarist Rod McClure, releasing the album &quot;Sampler&quot; in 1990. Peterik co-wrote &quot;The Sound of Your Voice&quot;, &quot;Rebel to Rebel&quot; and &quot;Treasure&quot; for 38 Special&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Bone Against Steel&quot;.

In 1992 Jamison toured, now billing his band as &quot;Survivor&quot; or &quot;Jimi Jamison&#x27;s Survivor&quot;. After Jamison&#x27;s success touring overseas that year, Sullivan contacted Jamison&#x27;s management and asked to be included on the tour; he performed on eight to ten dates before leaving the group. Soon after, in late 1992 to early 1993, Survivor was tapped to make a new and more extensive hits package with two new songs. For a short time, Peterik, Sullivan and Jamison were reunited in the studio to record new material for the new package and forthcoming world tour. But after contract talks faltered, Jamison quit and went back on the road again as &quot;Jimi Jamison&#x27;s Survivor&quot;.
In early 1993, Peterik and Sullivan reunited with original lead singer Dave Bickler as Survivor and released a new &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album with two new songs (&quot;Hungry Years&quot;, co-written by Bickler, and &quot;You Know Who You Are&quot;). They embarked on a European tour, with Bill Syniar and Kyle Woodring returning on bass and drums respectively. Bassist Randy Riley then replaced Syniar later in 1993 and Klem Hayes, who had performed on the new tracks on the 1993 compilation, took over in 1994 after Riley departed.

As Jamison was also touring as Survivor, Peterik and Sullivan filed a lawsuit against their former colleague for using the name but ultimately failed (at the time) in their bid to stop Jamison from touring under the &quot;Survivor&quot; banner.

On November 27, 1993 guitarist Dave Carl filled in for Sullivan at a gig at Club Dimensions in Highland, Indiana after the latter injured his ribs from falling through a garage roof.

From 1993 to 1996, Peterik, Sullivan and Bickler recorded about 20 demos for a new album (which are available on the &quot;Fire Makes Steel&quot; bootleg) with Syniar and Woodring and, later, Ellis and Droubay contributing. But they failed to secure a record deal due to ongoing litigation and trademark issues with Jamison.

With Peterik and Sullivan increasingly at musical and personal odds and Sullivan attempting to move the band in more of a bluesy direction, Peterik abruptly decided to leave Survivor, playing his last show with them on July 3, 1996, at the &#x27;Eyes To The Skies&#x27; summer fest in Lisle, Illinois.

At this juncture, Sullivan and Bickler were effectively the only remaining original members of the band. Survivor replaced Peterik with composer–keyboardist Chris Grove. Peterik returned to recording and touring with The Ides of March and also formed the group Pride of Lions.

In late 1996, bassist Stephan Ellis and drummer Marc Droubay rejoined Survivor, but Ellis left again by early 1999 and was replaced by Gordon Patriarca who only played about a half a dozen shows before new bass player Billy Ozzello was brought in. Survivor then went on to record more demos for a record deal, including &quot;Rebel Girl &#x27;98&quot; and the Sullivan solo album cut &quot;Lies&quot;.

In 1999 Jamison released the album &quot;Empires&quot; under the name &quot;Jimi Jamison&#x27;s Survivor&quot; (later re-released under his own name).

In late September 1999, Sullivan, who had brought forth another lawsuit against Jamison, won ownership of the name &quot;Survivor&quot;, thereby ending the ongoing trademark battle.

== 2000–2006: Bickler&#x27;s departure and Jamison&#x27;s return ==
In March 2000 Bickler was fired, severing the then Sullivan–Bickler Survivor and resulting in Sullivan&#x27;s reestablishment of a partnership with Jamison. The band then began recording material for a new album. The Peterik–Sullivan-penned track &quot;Velocitized&quot; was set for inclusion on the soundtrack to the Stallone film &quot;Driven&quot;. However, it did not make the cut.

Later that year, the band threatened to sue CBS for using the name &quot;Survivor&quot; as the title of their hit reality show &quot;Survivor&quot;.

For 2002, they recorded &quot;Christmas is Here&quot; which managed to move up the Mediabase Christmas charts, reaching No. 6 as the most added holiday song at radio, and which appeared on the soundtrack &quot;A Classic Rock Christmas&quot;.

In 2003 bassist Randy Riley returned to replace Billy Ozzello.

In 2004 a Starbucks television commercial debuted for their Double Shot espresso beverage. It featured the band following a man named Glen, singing a modified version of &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot; while he went about his day-to-day tasks. This commercial gained a number of fans and was nominated for an Emmy Award.

Meanwhile, original Survivor vocalist David Bickler began collaborating on the successful Bud Light beer Real Men of Genius radio ads in the late 1990s and 2000s. The Real Men of Genius ads were popular and included TV spots aired during the 2006 Super Bowl, among others. A CD package containing many of the popular commercials was recorded with Bickler, selling over 100,000 copies in its first month of release.

Bassist Stephan Ellis returned to play a few shows with the group in 2005, but Barry Dunaway played bass for most of that year. By early 2006, Billy Ozzello returned as bassist.

In April 2006, Survivor released a new album, &quot;Reach&quot;. Consisting of mostly new songs, it also included some re-recordings from the &quot;Fire Makes Steel&quot; sessions. Six of the album&#x27;s songs were originally written and recorded in the 1990s with Bickler on lead vocals.

On July 14, 2006, Jamison left the band once again. Former McAuley Schenker Group singer Robin McAuley replaced him on lead vocals.

== 2007–2019: Reunions and Jamison&#x27;s death ==
The band performed &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot; on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; on April 3, 2007. 

In 2008 Michael Young replaced Chris Grove on keyboards.

According to Sullivan, and revealed at Survivormusic.com on March 5, 2010, an album of new original music, &quot;Re-Entry&quot;, was to be released the following month, but no album was ever released. As of 2010, the lineup was a mix of old and new members: Robin McAuley (vocals), original member/songwriter Sullivan (guitar/vocals), longtime members Marc Droubay (drums) and Billy Ozzello (bass) and newcomer Mitchell Sigman (keyboards/guitar), who replaced Young. Sigman, however, was gone by 2011 and a new player, Walter Tolentino, was brought in.

Sullivan worked with the Chicago suburb melodic rock band Mecca, led by Chicago area native singer–songwriter Joe Knez Vana. Coincidentally, he replaced Peterik, who produced the first Mecca album. The album was released in late 2011 on Frontiers Records.

In 2011 Jamison returned as front man and in 2013 it was announced on the band&#x27;s official media sources that Sullivan had reunited the current Survivor lineup with Bickler. &quot;Our fans are the best and I can&#x27;t think of a better way to give them our best. With this lineup, and both Dave and Jimi in the band, we can perform ALL of our hits,&quot; he said. They were also working on new material and looking forward to getting back into the studio together.

As of 2014, Frankie&#x27;s son, Ryan, has taken over on drums in place of Droubay, who had to bow out due to health matters.

On September 1, 2014, Jamison died of what was believed to be a heart attack in his home in Memphis, Tennessee, at age 63. Jamison performed his last show on August 30, 2014, in Morgan Hill, California, at the CANcert benefit event during the ARTTEC Summer Concert Series. The benefit raised funds and awareness for two non-profit organizations that support cancer patients as well as career training opportunities for high school students. In November 2014 &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine carried a report that shed further light on the cause of Jimi&#x27;s death: &quot;Shelby County medical examiner confirms [Jamison] was suffering from cardiovascular disease and narrowing of the arteries. But the report cites the cause of death as a result of hemorrhagic brain stroke, with &#x27;acute methamphetamine intoxication contributing.&#x27; His passing was ruled to be an accident.&quot;

In September 2015, Survivor appeared at a showcase for talent buyers down in Nashville, with new vocalist 21-year-old Cameron Barton singing alongside Dave Bickler. In March 2016, Bickler quit the band; this was announced via an edit on Survivor&#x27;s Twitter page.

In late 2017, California musician/actor/composer Jeffrey Bryan (a.k.a. Jeff Fishman) joined Survivor, replacing Tolentino.

On February 28, 2019, the former Survivor bassist Stephan Ellis died. Facebook posts from family members and friends indicate that he had been ill for a while, suffering from dementia, and that he spent his final days in a hospice.

<doc id="1009988" wikidata="Q1993431" url="?curid=1009988" title="Hi and Lois">
<text>Hi and Lois is an American comic strip about a suburban family. Created by Mort Walker and illustrated by Dik Browne, both of whose children currently work on the strip, it debuted on October 18, 1954, distributed by King Features Syndicate.

==Publication history==
The Flagstons first appeared in Walker&#x27;s &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot;. They spun off into their own strip, written by Walker and drawn by Browne. Lois Flagston (née Bailey) is Beetle Bailey&#x27;s sister and the two strips make occasional crossovers. One of these occurred on the strip&#x27;s 40th anniversary in 1994, when Beetle visited his sister Lois and her family. Chip resembles his Uncle Beetle in attitude and appearance, especially the eyes.
The strip made efforts to keep up with the times, such as housewife Lois Flagston taking a career in real estate in 1980. In previous decades, the strip was acclaimed; in 1962, it earned Browne a Reuben Award from the National Cartoonists Society.

The strip faced some controversy given the changes in content restrictions since its debut in the 1950s. Once, editors insisted that belly buttons could not appear; in protest, Browne included a box of dimpled navel oranges.

Now produced by the sons of the original creative team, the strip is written by Brian and Greg Walker and drawn by Robert &quot;Chance&quot; Browne (until his death in 2024) and Eric Reaves.

As of 2016, &quot;Hi and Lois&quot; appears in 1,000 newspapers around the world.

===Comic books===
&quot;Hi and Lois&quot; was occasionally featured in Dell Comics&#x27; &quot;Four Color Comics&quot; series in the 50&#x27;s.

The feature also had its own short-lived series from Charlton Comics. Eleven issues were produced from November 1969 to July 1971. The cover price was fifteen cents.

===TV animation===
Hi and Lois were featured prominently in the animated television film &quot;Popeye Meets the Man Who Hated Laughter&quot;, which debuted on ABC on October 7, 1972, as part of the network&#x27;s anthology series &quot;The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie&quot;.

==Characters==
*Hi and Lois Flagston: Hi (short for Hiram) and Lois are typical middle-class American suburbanites. Their names are a pun on the &quot;opposite&quot; terms of &quot;high and low&quot;. Hi is a sales manager, Lois is a realtor and is sister to &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot;. They have four children.
**Chip: a slovenly, indolent, teenaged high school boy; a running gag has Chip dating new girlfriends. Eight years old at the time the strip started, Chip grew into his teenage years by sometime in the 1960s, where he has stayed. 
**Dot and Ditto: rambunctious twins Dot (girl) and Ditto (boy), four-year-olds when the strip began, now (and since the late sixties) grade school-aged; Dot is the better student of the two.
**Trixie: the Flagstons&#x27; freckled, blonde infant daughter, who loves &quot;talking&quot; (through thought balloons) to Sunbeam, a ray of sunlight. While the other children have aged, Trixie has not.
*Dawg: the Flagstons&#x27; large, lazy, shaggy sheepdog.
*Thirsty Thurston: the Flagstons&#x27; fat, lazy, and frequently tipsy next-door neighbor; Hi&#x27;s co-worker and golf buddy.
*Irma Thurston: Thirsty&#x27;s thin, weary, and long-suffering wife.
*Abercrombie and Fitch: the friendly neighborhood garbage collectors. Their names are taken from the elite outfitter of sporting and excursion goods of that era.
*Mr. Foofram: Owner and president of Foofram Industries, where Hi and Thirsty work. Diminutive and at times short-tempered, but not a tyrant like J.C. Dithers from &quot;Blondie&quot;.
*Mr. Wavering: An elderly neighbor of Hi and Lois; he served as a corporal in the United States Marine Corps.

==Reception==
Ron Goulart praised Dik Browne&#x27;s artwork for the strip, stating &quot;Browne made &quot;Hi and Lois&quot; one of the most visually interesting strips on the comics page.&quot; In an article for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reviewing then-current comic strips, Ken Tucker gave &quot;Hi and Lois&quot; a B+ rating, and added that it had the &quot;gentlest humor&quot; of all the Mort Walker comic strips.

<doc id="1009989" wikidata="Q262501" url="?curid=1009989" title="Deponent verb">
<text>In linguistics, a deponent verb is a verb that is active in meaning but takes its form from a different voice, most commonly the middle or passive. A deponent verb has no active forms.

== Languages with deponent verbs ==
&quot;This list may not be exhaustive.&quot;

===Ancient Greek===

Ancient Greek has middle-voice deponents (some of which are very common) and some passive-voice deponents. An example in classical Greek is (, &#x27;I come&#x27; or &#x27;I go&#x27;), middle/passive in form but translated into English using the active voice (since English has no middle voice).

Some &#x27;active&#x27; verbs will take middle-form futures, such as how (, &#x27;I hear&#x27;) becomes (, &#x27;I will hear&#x27;), rather than the regular adding of a sigma (like (, &#x27;I stop&#x27;) becoming (, &#x27;I will stop&#x27;)). These are still translated into English as active. For these verbs, there is no future middle, but the future passive is unaffected.

Koine Greek has a few verbs which have very different meanings in the active and middle/passive forms. For example, () means &quot;I set fire to&quot;, whereas its middle form () means &quot;I touch&quot;. Because is much more common in usage, beginners often learn this form first and are tempted to assume that it is a deponent.

In recent years, there has been a sustained challenge to the notion of deponency by scholars of ancient Greek. They argue that the &quot;middle-preference&quot; verbs in Greek should be translated within the middle voice, and as a consequence that our understanding of the middle voice should be shaped by these verbs. In other words the &quot;deponent&quot; verbs take only the middle endings because the semantic domain of these verbs communicates a middle idea.

===Latin===
Latin deponent verbs can belong to any conjugation. Their form (except in the present and future participle) is that of a passive verb, but the meaning is active. Usually a deponent verb has no corresponding active form, although there are a few, such as &#x27;I turn (transitive)&#x27; and &#x27;I turn (intransitive)&#x27; which have both active and deponent forms.

Examples are (&#x27;to exhort&#x27;), (&#x27;to fear&#x27;), (&#x27;to speak&#x27;), (&#x27;to flatter&#x27;), and many more. The forms regularly follow those of the passive of normal verbs:

Deponents have all the participles normal verbs do, although those of the perfect carry an active meaning, rather than a passive meaning as in the case of normal verbs. Some deponent verbs, such as , use the corresponding forms of other verbs to express a genuine passive meaning.

Additionally, four Latin verbs ( , , , and ) are called &quot;semi-deponent&quot;, because though they look passive in their perfect forms, they are semantically active in all forms.

Conversely, Latin also has some verbs that are active in form but passive in meaning. was used as the passive of . In the perfect forms (perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect), this was a compound verb just like the passive voice of regular verbs ( ).

===Old Irish===
Old Irish has a substantial number of deponent verbs, some of them very common, such as and . The -Vr ending was the regular passive or impersonal ending.

The pattern was not continued into the modern languages and all such verbforms were ultimately replaced by &#x27;normal&#x27; forms. The -Vr ending still is the regular passive or impersonal ending in the later language, as in the eg Modern Scottish Gaelic passive/impersonal . The verb has its origin in the deponent Old Irish .

===Sanskrit===
Sanskrit has active, middle and passive voices. As the passive is a secondary formation (based on a different stem with middle endings), all deponent verbs take middle-voice forms, such as .

Traditional grammar distinguishes three classes of verbs: , and . Thus, (plural of ) might be considered a deponent verb.

===Swedish===
Swedish has a few passive-voice deponents, although its closely related neighbour languages Danish and Norwegian mostly use active corresponding forms. Indeed, Norwegian shows the opposite trend: like in English, active verbs are sometimes used with a passive or middle sense, such as in . is the normal passive ending in the Scandinavian languages. 
* (cf. Danish and Norwegian Bokmål (non-deponent))
* (cf. Danish , Norwegian Bokmål (non-deponent))
* 
* 
* , as in 

A handful of Swedish deponent verbs are specifically used for reciprocal or continuous meanings. These verbs typically have non-deponent counterparts.
* 

===Norwegian===
Norwegian has several common deponents which use the passive ending in the active voice, instead of the usual active ending (and retains the in the infinitive, where most verbs end solely in ):
* 
* 
The past tense is indicated by or , e.g. .

===Danish===
Modern Danish has 54 unique deponent verbs
which work basically like in the other Scandinavian languages; the most common ones are:
* 

Some other verbs do have an active form but also a deponent one with a different meaning or usage, e.g.:
* (in the active form, )
* (in the active form, )
* (in the active form ).

Finally, some verbs are passive in Danish, but would be translated with active verbs in most other languages, e.g.:
* (literally ), 

== Deponency and tense ==
Some verbs are deponent in all tenses, but other verbs are deponent only in certain tenses. For example, the Greek verb (&quot;anabainō&quot;) &#x27;I go up&#x27; uses active forms in the imperfect active and aorist active, but in the future active it shows the middle form (&quot;anabēsomai&quot;) &#x27;I will go up&#x27;.

Latin has a few semi-deponent verbs, which have active forms in the present, future, and imperfect tenses, but are deponent in the perfect system.

<doc id="1009990" wikidata="Q7246346" url="?curid=1009990" title="Privy Council ministry">
<text>The Privy Council ministry was a short-lived reorganization of English government that was reformed to place the ministry under the control of the Privy Council in April 1679, due to events in that time.

==Formation==
It followed years of widespread discontent with the government, which had been consistently autocratic and clandestine since the Restoration and was now mired in conflict between Parliament and King Charles. Sir William Temple, England&#x27;s foremost diplomat and greatly respected both at home and abroad, was recalled at the beginning of 1679 and became the king&#x27;s closest advisor. Elections to the House of Commons returned a majority for the opponents of the government, the Earl of Danby was forced from office and Temple led the formation of a new ministry, aiming to reconcile the conflicting factions of the day.

Temple believed the king should not exercise absolute power but was also uncomfortable with the increasing prominence of Parliament. He sought to create a less divisive body that could carry popular support without trying to dictate to the king. He proposed that the king should no longer be advised by any one individual or by a select committee of the Privy Council, but by a reformed council as a whole. The new council would have thirty members, rather than fifty: Fifteen would hold paid high office in government, the Church or the judiciary; fifteen would be independent, representing the parliamentary factions and chosen for their wealth (which Temple felt was the source of power). The king would give full consideration to the opinions of the council, which would be free to discuss and vote on all matters. The king duly dismissed the existing council; news of this, and that the new government would include members of the country party and the king&#x27;s popular, illegitimate son, Monmouth, was widely welcomed. However, Charles took against the scheme when Temple insisted on the inclusion of Viscount Halifax, whom he disliked personally. He agreed but insisted, to Temple&#x27;s alarm, that the Earl of Shaftesbury, the government&#x27;s most vociferous critic, should also be included. This sabotaged Temple&#x27;s council, ensuring irreconcilable division.

==First meeting of the council, and its collapse==

The new council met on 21 April. Within hours, it had been subverted as a group of nine conflicting members took a lead in the conduct of business; Temple reacted angrily, almost leaving the council, then consenting to form a group of four (with Halifax, Essex and Sunderland) to advise the king in secret. The four worked well together, but the full council was sharply divided. Shaftesbury now effectively led the opposition from within the government itself, with the support of a majority in the Commons. In the face of the Exclusion Bill, the king prorogued and then dissolved Parliament without the council&#x27;s approval. Temple withdrew from active participation, leaving Halifax, Essex and Sunderland to exercise power as a Triumvirate, and a thirty-first councillor was appointed. When the king fell ill and his brother&#x27;s return from the Dutch Republic caused alarm in the country, Temple expressed his concerns to the Triumvirate but was no longer taken seriously. Elections for the new Parliament returned another opposition majority, and the king prorogued it before it met, again in spite of the council. Shaftesbury was discharged from office and other leading critics of the government resigned. Temple&#x27;s experiment ended with the rise of Laurence Hyde, a strong supporter of the King, in November.

<text>Anthocharis damone, the eastern orange tip, is a butterfly in the subfamily Pierinae, found in southern Europe and into Asia Minor.

==Description in Seitz==

&quot;A. damone&quot; Boisd. from South Italy, Sicily, the southern Balcan, Asia Minor and Syria, is sexually dimorphic. The male is lemon-yellow above and below, with a narrowly black apex, large deep orange-red apical patch, which is more or less dark-edged proximally, and with a large black median spot to the forewing: the underside of the hindwing deeper yellow, with grey-greenish markings. The female is white above and on the underside of the forewing, and has a broader blackish apex to the upperside of the forewing. —
&quot;pallida&quot; form. nov. is the name for the form occurring in Mesopotamia; male above somewhat paler yellow, the dark apex of the forewing is strongly mixed with red, the orange patch is less fiery, being dark-edged only in the cell, the black median spot is smaller, less prominent, the ground-colour of the hindwing beneath is lighter yellow, and the dark markings are more united to isolated patches. In the female the black median spot of the forewing is smaller on both sides and less sharply marked, the underside of the hindwing being lighter yellow.
==Habitat==

In Armenia &quot;A. damone&quot; inhabits mountain steppes, but also occurs in juniper woodlands, occupying elevation range from 1200 to 2200 m a.s.l.

<text>Despair, Inc is a company based in Austin, Texas, that produces posters and souvenirs that satirize the motivational indoctrination common in corporate environments.

They are known for their cynical and ironic &quot;Demotivator&quot; items, which parody the grandiose imagery and solemn language of Successories, a range of motivational products. Examples:
*&quot;MEETINGS: None of us is as dumb as all of us.&quot;
*&quot;BLAME: The secret to success is knowing who to blame for your failures.&quot;
*&quot;DREAMS: Dreams are like rainbows. Only idiots chase them.&quot;

On the company website, each &quot;Demotivator&quot; is followed by a list of individuals who the company feels would be a perfect candidate for the item (this does not apply to all their offerings). A running gag is that the category &quot;Disaffected College Students&quot; (or a variant thereof) is included as the last candidate in most listings.

In 2000, Despair, Inc. obtained a registered trademark in the US for the familiar frowny emoticon when used on &quot;greeting cards, posters and art prints&quot;.

<text>FASTA is a DNA and protein sequence alignment software package first described by David J. Lipman and William R. Pearson in 1985. Its legacy is the FASTA format which is now ubiquitous in bioinformatics.

== History ==
The original FASTA program was designed for protein sequence similarity searching. Because of the exponentially expanding genetic information and the limited speed and memory of computers in the 1980s heuristic methods were introduced aligning a query sequence to entire data-bases. FASTA, published in 1987, added the ability to do DNA:DNA searches, translated protein:DNA searches, and also provided a more sophisticated shuffling program for evaluating statistical significance. There are several programs in this package that allow the alignment of protein sequences and DNA sequences. Nowadays, increased computer performance makes it possible to perform searches for local alignment detection in a database using the Smith–Waterman algorithm.

FASTA is pronounced &quot;fast A&quot;, and stands for &quot;FAST-All&quot;, because it works with any alphabet, an extension of the original &quot;FAST-P&quot; (protein) and &quot;FAST-N&quot; (nucleotide) alignment tools.

== Uses ==
The current FASTA package contains programs for protein:protein, DNA:DNA, protein:translated DNA (with frameshifts), and ordered or unordered peptide searches. Recent versions of the FASTA package include special translated search algorithms that correctly handle frameshift errors (which six-frame-translated searches do not handle very well) when comparing nucleotide to protein sequence data.

In addition to rapid heuristic search methods, the FASTA package provides SSEARCH, an implementation of the optimal Smith–Waterman algorithm.

A major focus of the package is the calculation of accurate similarity statistics, so that biologists can judge whether an alignment is likely to have occurred by chance, or whether it can be used to infer homology. The FASTA package is available from the University of Virginia and the European Bioinformatics Institute.

The FASTA file format used as input for this software is now largely used by other sequence database search tools (such as BLAST) and sequence alignment programs (Clustal, T-Coffee, etc.).

== Search method ==
FASTA takes a given nucleotide or amino acid sequence and searches a corresponding sequence database by using local sequence alignment to find matches of similar database sequences.

The FASTA program follows a largely heuristic method which contributes to the high speed of its execution. It initially observes the pattern of word hits, word-to-word matches of a given length, and marks potential matches before performing a more time-consuming optimized search using a Smith–Waterman type of algorithm.

The size taken for a word, given by the parameter kmer, controls the sensitivity and speed of the program. Increasing the k-mer value decreases number of background hits that are found. From the word hits that are returned the program looks for segments that contain a cluster of nearby hits. It then investigates these segments for a possible match.

There are some differences between fastn and fastp relating to the type of sequences used but both use four steps and calculate three scores to describe and format the sequence similarity results. These are:

* Identify regions of highest density in each sequence comparison. Taking a k-mer to equal 1 or 2.

: In this step all or a group of the identities between two sequences are found using a look up table. The k-mer value determines how many consecutive identities are required for a match to be declared. Thus the lesser the k-mer value: the more sensitive the search. k-mer=2 is frequently taken by users for protein sequences and kmer=4 or 6 for nucleotide sequences. Short oligonucleotides are usually run with k-mer= 1. The program then finds all similar local regions, represented as diagonals of a certain length in a dot plot, between the two sequences by counting k-mer matches and penalizing for intervening mismatches. This way, local regions of highest density matches in a diagonal are isolated from background hits. For protein sequences BLOSUM50 values are used for scoring k-mer matches. This ensures that groups of identities with high similarity scores contribute more to the local diagonal score than to identities with low similarity scores. Nucleotide sequences use the identity matrix for the same purpose. The best 10 local regions selected from all the diagonals put together are then saved.

* Rescan the regions taken using the scoring matrices. trimming the ends of the region to include only those contributing to the highest score. 
: Rescan the 10 regions taken. This time use the relevant scoring matrix while rescoring to allow runs of identities shorter than the k-mer value. Also while rescoring conservative replacements that contribute to the similarity score are taken. Though protein sequences use the BLOSUM50 matrix, scoring matrices based on the minimum number of base changes required for a specific replacement, on identities alone, or on an alternative measure of similarity such as PAM, can also be used with the program. For each of the diagonal regions rescanned this way, a subregion with the maximum score is identified. The initial scores found in step1 are used to rank the library sequences. The highest score is referred to as &quot;init1&quot; score.

* In an alignment if several initial regions with scores greater than a CUTOFF value are found, check whether the trimmed initial regions can be joined to form an approximate alignment with gaps. Calculate a similarity score that is the sum of the joined regions penalising for each gap 20 points. This initial similarity score (&quot;initn&quot;) is used to rank the library sequences. The score of the single best initial region found in step 2 is reported (&quot;init1&quot;).
: Here the program calculates an optimal alignment of initial regions as a combination of compatible regions with maximal score. This optimal alignment of initial regions can be rapidly calculated using a dynamic programming algorithm. The resulting score initn is used to rank the library sequences. This joining process increases sensitivity but decreases selectivity. A carefully calculated cut-off value is thus used to control where this step is implemented, a value that is approximately one standard deviation above the average score expected from unrelated sequences in the library. A 200-residue query sequence with k-mer 2 uses a value 28.

* Use a banded Smith–Waterman algorithm to calculate an optimal score for alignment.
: This step uses a banded Smith–Waterman algorithm to create an optimised score (&quot;opt&quot;) for each alignment of query sequence to a database(library) sequence. It takes a band of 32 residues centered on the &quot;init1&quot; region of step2 for calculating the optimal alignment. After all sequences are searched the program plots the initial scores of each database sequence in a histogram, and calculates the statistical significance of the &quot;opt&quot; score. For protein sequences, the final alignment is produced using a full Smith–Waterman alignment. For DNA sequences, a banded alignment is provided.

FASTA can remove complexity regions before aligning the sequences by encoding low complexity regions in lower case and using the -S option. However, the BLAST program offers more options for correcting for biased composition statistics. Therefore, the program PRSS is added in the FASTA distribution package. PRSS shuffles the matching sequences in the database either on the one-letter level or it shuffles short segments which length the user can determine. The shuffled sequences are now aligned again and if the score is still higher than expected this is caused by the low complexity regions being mixed up still mapping to the query. By the amount of the score the shuffled sequences still attain PRSS now can predict the significance of the score of the original sequences. The higher the score of the shuffled sequences the less significant the matches found between original database and query sequence.

The FASTA programs find regions of local or global similarity between Protein or DNA sequences, either by searching Protein or DNA databases, or by identifying local duplications within a sequence. Other programs provide information on the statistical significance of an alignment. Like BLAST, FASTA can be used to infer functional and evolutionary relationships between sequences as well as help identify members of gene families.

<text>John Chandler (February 1, 1762September 25, 1841) was an American politician and soldier of Maine. The political career of Chandler, a Democratic-Republican, was interspersed with his involvement in the state militia during both the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812.

== Biography ==
=== Family background ===
Chandler was born in Epping in the Province of New Hampshire. He was one of 69 children and the third-oldest son of Joseph Chandler (1725–1776) and his wife Lydia (née Eastman; 1726–1820). His father Joseph was a blacksmith. He fought in the French and Indian War and was a captain in the Revolutionary War. He died at Mount Independence in 1776.

=== American Revolutionary War ===
Chandler was self-educated and enlisted in the Continental Army at age 15. In the same year he was captured by the British, but he soon escaped. In May 1779 he was captured again. In September, he was able to escape and made his way back to Epping. Immediately he reenlisted in the Continental Army. During the war he had become the protégé of General Henry Dearborn, (1751–1829), a future fifth U.S. Secretary of War (1801–1809), who was also an important commander of the Northeast sector at Fort Detroit, in the Old Northwest Territory, but a terrible failure during the War of 1812.

On August 27, 1783, Chandler married Mary Whittier, with whom he had seven children (three sons and four daughters).

=== Politician in Massachusetts ===
After the end of the war, Chandler was both illiterate and without money. However, he borrowed money from Dearborn and bought a farm near Monmouth in the District of Maine, then a part of Massachusetts. He settled there with his family in 1784. A local schoolmaster gave him all the support he needed to catch up on his schooling quickly. He worked hard as a blacksmith, prospered over the years and became a respected member of the community.

From 1803 to 1805, Chandler served in the Massachusetts Senate; he later was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democratic-Republican, serving from March 4, 1805, to March 3, 1809. Chandler was not a candidate for renomination in 1808. In the same year he was appointed Sheriff of Kennebec County. On February 27, 1812, he became major general of the Massachusetts Militia.

=== War of 1812 ===
At the outbreak of the War of 1812, President James Madison appointed Chandler to the command of the 17th division. This was a brigade of U.S. Volunteers, troops recruited for one year of service. At this moment he was still major general of the Massachusetts Militia. On July 8, 1812, he resigned his militia office and was commissioned as a brigadier general of the United States Army. The first part of the war he was serving under Major General Henry Dearborn as the commander of one of three brigades of the &quot;Army of the North&quot;.

At the beginning of June 1813 he accompanied Brigadier General William H. Winder during the Niagara campaign on an advance into Canada. At the Battle of Stoney Creek Chandler was wounded, and both he and Winder were captured, when they wandered into the British line, thinking it was their own. In 1814 he was set free in an exchange of prisoners. Chandler subsequently served defending the coast of New Hampshire and Maine, coordinating efforts between the local militia and federal units. After the war ended, he returned to politics as a member of the Massachusetts General Court in 1819.

=== Later years ===
Chandler was the first president of the Maine Senate and a member of the Maine Constitutional Convention. Upon the admission of Maine to the Union, Chandler was elected to the U.S. Senate. Chandler began his term on June 14, 1820, and was reelected in 1823. During his time in the Senate, Chandler was the chairman of the Committee on Militia during the 18th through 20th Congresses and played a key role in establishing the arsenal at Augusta, as well as the construction of the military road from Bangor to Houlton. He resigned on March 3, 1829, to become the customs collector of Portland, a post he held until 1837. Chandler was a trustee of Bowdoin College from 1821 - 1838. He died in Augusta at age 79 and was buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery.

<text>A Service Access Point (SAP) is an identifying label for network endpoints used in Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) networking.

The SAP is a conceptual location at which one OSI layer can request the services of another OSI layer. As an example, PD-SAP or PLME-SAP in IEEE 802.15.4 can be mentioned, where the medium access control (MAC) layer requests certain services from the physical layer. Service access points are also used in IEEE 802.2 Logical Link Control in Ethernet and similar data link layer protocols.

When using the OSI Network system (CONS or CLNS), the base for constructing an address for a network element is an NSAP address, similar in concept to an IP address. OSI protocols as well as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) can use Transport (TSAP), Session (SSAP) or Presentation (PSAP) Service Access Points to specify a destination address for a connection. These SAPs consist of NSAP addresses combined with optional transport, session and presentation selectors, which can differentiate at any of the three layers between multiple services at that layer provided by a network element.
IEEE 802&#x27;s reference model (RM) guarantees the following SAPs:

* LSAP - Link
* MSAP - MAC
* PSAP - PHY
802.3 (the Ethernet standard) optionally includes:
* OSAP - operations, administration and maintenance (OAM)
* MCSAP - MAC control
* Energy efficient Ethernet PSAP
* Time sync PSAP

<doc id="1010025" wikidata="Q10854587" url="?curid=1010025" title="IRAC">
<text>IRAC ( ) is an acronym that generally stands for: Issue, Rule, Application, and Conclusion. It functions as a methodology for legal analysis. The IRAC format is mostly used in hypothetical questions in law school and bar exams.

==Sections of an IRAC==

===Issue===
In the IRAC method of legal analysis, the &quot;issue&quot; is simply a legal question that must be answered. An issue arises when the facts of a case present a legal ambiguity that must be resolved in a case, and legal researchers (whether paralegals, law students, lawyers, or judges) typically resolve the issue by consulting legal precedent (existing statutes, past cases, court rules, etc.). For example, suppose the law required that a lawsuit had to be filed within one year of an allegedly negligent act. If the 365th day falls on a Sunday, then the issue would be whether or not the law counts weekends as part of its computation of the one-year time limit. Would the plaintiff have to file by the preceding Friday? Would the law excuse the weekend and consider a Monday filing to be timely, even though that would technically be the 366th day? In order to answer the legal question (issue), one would move to the next letter in the IRAC acronym: &quot;R&quot;, which stands for Rule.

===Rule===
The Rule section of an IRAC follows the statement of the issue at hand. The rule section of an IRAC is the statement of the rules pertinent in deciding the issue stated. Rules in a common law jurisdiction derive from court case precedent and statute. The information included in the rules section depends heavily on the specificity of the question at hand. If the question states a specific jurisdiction then it is proper to include rules specific to that jurisdiction. Another distinction often made in the rule section is a clear delineation of rules that are in holding, and binding based on the authority of the hierarchy of the court, being ratio decidendi, and being the majority ruling, or simply persuasive. There are occasions when rules are adopted on the basis they are the only clearly articulated rules on the issue, in spite of being minority decisions, obiter dicta, and from lower courts, in other jurisdictions, which have never been contradicted.

The rules help make a correct legal analysis of the issue at hand using the facts of the case. The rules section needs to be a legal summary of all the rules used in the analysis and is often written in a manner which paraphrases or otherwise analytically condenses information into applicable rules.

===Application===
The Application (or Analysis) section of an IRAC applies the rules developed in the rules section to the specific facts of the issue at hand. This section uses only the rules stated in the rules section of the IRAC and usually utilizes all the rules stated including exceptions as is required by the analysis. It is important in this section to apply the rules to the facts of the case and explain or argue why a particular rule applies or does not apply in the case presented. The application/analysis section is the most important section of an IRAC because it develops the answer to the issue at hand. It is useful to think like a lawyer, arguing the facts of the matter from both sides while sticking to the rules before coming to a decision.

===Conclusion===
The Conclusion section of an IRAC directly answers the question presented in the issue section of the IRAC. It is important for the methodology of the IRAC that the conclusion section of the IRAC not introduce any new rules or analysis. This section restates the issue and provides the final answer.
Conclusion is a vital process where the final calls are distributed upon the previous cases and are redefined by the judge.

==The role of facts==
The facts of a case are central to every step in the IRAC. It is from the facts that the issues are identified. It is the facts that lead to the identification of the most appropriate rules, and the rules which lead to the most useful way of construing the facts. Analysis requires the interpretation of facts and rules. The conclusion is a decision based on the application of the rules to the facts for each issue.

==Criticism==
IRAC has many proponents and opponents. The main arguments of the proponents of the IRAC methodology say it reduces legal reasoning to the application of a formula that helps organize the legal analysis. Since an organized legal analysis is easier to follow and reduces errors in reasoning, therefore, the proponents argue that the IRAC is a very useful tool.

The opponents of the IRAC fall into two categories. The first category are those who object to using an IRAC because of its strict and unwieldy format. Most of these critics offer an alternative version of the IRAC such as MIRAT, IDAR, CREAC, TREACC, CRuPAC, ISAAC and ILAC. Each new iteration is supposed to cure the defects of the IRAC and offer more or less freedom depending upon the format. A very good example of such an alternative format is the CREAC which is said to offer more clarity and congruity. They argue this based upon the repetition of the conclusion in the beginning and the end which is said to leave no doubt as to the final answer and offer congruity to the overall reasoning. It also has an explanation of the rules section which helps delineate rules into stating the rules and explaining the rules for further clarity.

The second category of critics of the IRAC say that it tends to lead to overwriting, and oversimplifying the complexity of proper legal analysis. This group believes that a good legal analysis consists of a thoughtful, careful, well researched essay that is written in a format most amiable to the writer. The importance of an open format amiable to the writer is supposed to let the legal reasoners concentrate on expressing their argument to the best of their abilities instead of concentrating on adhering to a strict format that reduces this focus.

==An example IRAC==
A generic IRAC on a law school exam would consist of an answer to a question. The following example demonstrates a generic IRAC as an answer to a question.

Person &quot;A&quot; walks into a grocery store and picks up a loaf of bread. He then stuffs the bread beneath his jacket. A security attendant sees him and follows him to the cash register. Person A passes through without stopping to pay for anything. The security attendant stops him at the gate. He detains person A while he interrogates him. Person A is unresponsive and uncooperative and in fact downright hostile to the charges being leveled at him by the security attendant. Person A is held for a period of two hours at the end of which it is found that he had actually put the loaf of bread back and was not stealing. Person A sues the grocery store for false imprisonment. Would person A prevail in court?

<doc id="1010027" wikidata="Q7016151" url="?curid=1010027" title="1972 New Zealand general election">
<text>The 1972 New Zealand general election was held on 25 November to elect MPs to the 37th session of the New Zealand Parliament. The Labour Party, led by Norman Kirk, defeated the governing National Party.

==Background==
The National Party had been in office since the 1960 election, when it had defeated the ruling Labour Party, led by Walter Nash. The Second Labour Government was the shortest-lasting of all New Zealand governments to that day; in contrast, the Second National Government, led for the majority of its tenure by Keith Holyoake, would be re-elected three times. 

National&#x27;s policies were focused around stability and a &quot;steady as she goes&quot; approach, but Holyoake&#x27;s Government was increasingly perceived as tired and worn-out. Additionally, Holyoake had been in politics since the 1930s, and his staunch conservatism was a poor fit for an increasingly cosmopolitan society. For much of the government&#x27;s third term, there had been speculation as to when Holyoake would stand down. Finally, in February 1972, Holyoake stood aside and was replaced by his deputy, Jack Marshall, who took steps to reinvigorate the party.

Meanwhile, Norman Kirk had been at the helm of Labour since 1965. In this time, he had been modernising and updating the Labour Party, but narrowly lost the 1969 election. Kirk slimmed and dressed to improve his image, and visited several overseas Labour parties to broaden his knowledge. He activated a &quot;spokesman&quot; or shadow cabinet system to spread the responsibility, but it was difficult to avoid one composed largely of MPs from the Auckland and Christchurch areas. Despite the improvements, commentators speculated whether National would pull off another cliffhanger victory. Economic recession and voter fatigue had hurt National at the polls. Labour&#x27;s slogan was &quot;It&#x27;s Time – Time for a change, time for Labour&quot;, which expertly captured the national mood.

A deciding election issue was the proposed raising of the levels of lakes Manapouri and Te Anau as part of the construction of the Manapouri Power Station to supply the aluminium smelter in Bluff with electricity. National wanted to proceed with the work but Labour pledged to keep the lake levels as they were. It became a deciding issue, with four National incumbents from Otago and Southland losing their electorates (Awarua, Invercargill, Otago Central, and Oamaru).

===MPs retiring in 1972===
Nine National MPs and one Labour MP intended to retire at the end of the 36th Parliament.

===1972 electoral redistribution===
Since the , the number of electorates in the South Island was fixed at 25, with continued faster population growth in the North Island leading to an increase in the number of general electorates. Including the four Māori electorates, there had been 80 electorates since the . This increased to 84 electorates through the 1969 election. The 1972 electoral redistribution saw three additional general seats created for the North Island, bringing the total number of electorates to 87.

Together with increased urbanisation in Christchurch and Nelson, the changes proved very disruptive to existing electorates. Only two South Island electorates were not altered by the redistribution ( and ). Only eight of the North Island electorates were not altered (, , , , , , , and ).

In the South Island, three electorates were abolished (, , and ), and three electorates were newly created (, , and ). In the North Island, five electorates were abolished (Hauraki, , , , and ), two electorates were recreated ( and ), and six electorates were newly created (, , , , , and ).

==Election day==

The date for the 1972 elections was 25 November, a Saturday. 1,583,256 people were registered to vote. There was a turnout of 89.1%, slightly higher than the previous election and considerably higher than the following one. The number of electorates being contested was 87.

==Results==
The election saw the Labour Party defeat the governing National Party in a landslide, winning 55 seats to National&#x27;s 32. This represented the largest swing against a sitting government since Labour first won power in 1935. Labour was therefore able to form its first government since 1960, with Norman Kirk becoming Prime Minister. The second National government thus gave way to the third Labour government. No minor parties managed to gain seats, and no independents were elected. There were 1,583,256 electors on the roll, with 1,401,152 (88.50%) voting.

<doc id="1010035" wikidata="Q7907710" url="?curid=1010035" title="V (drink)">
<text>V is an energy drink brand produced by Frucor Suntory, a New Zealand–based beverage manufacturer. It was launched in Methven, New Zealand in August 1997 and in Australia in 1999. The product&#x27;s success, a market share over 60% in New Zealand and 42% in Australia, makes it the most popular brand of energy drink in both countries. V is considered a local rival to Red Bull. Frucor says V energy drinks are not intended for children, and they are not recommended for pregnant women or people sensitive to caffeine.

== Variants ==
V Energy (also referred to as &quot;Green V&quot;) is the original flavour of V released in 1997.

Blue (also referred to as &quot;Blue V&quot;) is a pineapple and passion fruit flavour introduced in October 2011 which V challenges the drinker to try and work out the flavour. V Sugar Free Blue and V Zero Sugar Blue (as of August 2023) are also currently available.

V Black was a flavour variant that was discontinued in 2013. V Black was re-released in 2018 for a limited time in New Zealand over a 6-week period. It was described as having a strong coffee flavour. V Black was rereleased in June 2024.

V Pure is a flavour alternative released in 2016 coming from six Natural Ingredients; apple juice, sparkling water, lemon juice, Guarana seed extract, caffeine from green coffee beans and natural V flavour.

V added a second Sugar Free flavour in 2018, themed after summer and the tropics. This product replaced V Zero.

V Tortured Orchard Raspberry Lemonade was introduced in 2018. In 2020, this flavour was brought back as a permanent edition and rebranded to &#x27;V Raspberry Lemonade&#x27;.

V Tropical Tang was released in May 2023 and is described as &quot;guava, pineapple and berries&quot;. However, the new addition is currently only available in 500ml cans.

== V Energy Shots ==
The energy shots (described as &quot;Pocket Rockets&quot;) are claimed to be as effective as the larger cans but have an extremely bitter taste that, according to the V Pocket Rocket website, is to stop young children from drinking them.

== V Iced Drinks ==
In 2018, V released two Iced Coffee and two Iced Chocolate drinks to the New Zealand and Australian Market.

==Advertisement and promotions==
The drink sponsored &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; in the UK for its second series in 2003.

In April 2018, V together with donut store chain Donut King, released in Australia a V flavoured donut. The donut was sold through Donut King stores nationwide and contained a gooey Guarana filling and covered in green sugar crystals.

V sponsored &quot;Back of the Y Masterpiece Television&quot; in the mid-2000s.
