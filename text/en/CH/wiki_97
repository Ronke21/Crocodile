<text>Scrapbooking is a method of preserving, presenting, and arranging personal and family history in the form of a book, box, or card. Typical memorabilia include photographs, printed media, and artwork. Scrapbook albums are often decorated and frequently contain extensive journal entries or written descriptions. Scrapbooking started in the United Kingdom in the nineteenth century.

== History ==
In the 15th century, commonplace books, popular in England, emerged as a way to compile information that included recipes, quotations, letters, poems, and more. Each commonplace book was unique to its creator&#x27;s particular interests. Friendship albums became popular in the 16th century. These albums were used much like modern day yearbooks, where friends or patrons would enter their names, titles and short texts or illustrations at the request of the album&#x27;s owner. These albums were often created as souvenirs of European tours and would contain local memorabilia including coats of arms or works of art commissioned by local artisans. Starting in 1570, it became fashionable to incorporate colored plates depicting popular scenes such as Venetian costumes or Carnival scenes. These provided affordable options as compared to original works and, as such, these plates were not sold to commemorate or document a specific event, but specifically as embellishments for albums. In 1775, James Granger published a history of England with several blank pages at the end of the book. The pages were designed to allow the book&#x27;s owner to personalize the book with their own memorabilia. The practice of pasting engravings, lithographs, and other illustrations into books, or even taking the books apart, inserting new matter, and rebinding them, became known as extra-illustrating or &quot;grangerizing&quot;.

Additionally, friendship albums, confession albums, and school yearbooks afforded girls in the 18th and 19th centuries an outlet through which to share their literary skills, and allowed girls an opportunity to document their own personalized historical record previously not readily available to them. In &quot;Negotiating Intimacy in British Romantic Friendship Albums,&quot; Renee Bryzik has analyzed five albums from the Pfozheimer archive at the New York Public Library that illustrate the practice&#x27;s range in style and content.

For example, college women around the turn of the century used scrapbooks extensively to construct representations of their everyday life as students. Without photograph albums to provide images of these life events, students created unique representations through scrapbooks in order to illustrate their lives using ephemera and memorabilia. A guest list or group of visiting cards might represent a young woman&#x27;s visit to a party. A playbill and ticket stub might serve as reminders of a trip to New York to see a Broadway show. Solid objects such as plants, silverware, or small trinkets were also used when further visual representation was needed. 
A page from these subject-based scrapbooks might include class schedules, exam booklets, letters from professors, or other printed material from school events. Thus scrapbooks from this era can create a more complete image of their maker&#x27;s life.
During the 19th century, scrapbooking was seen as a more involved way to preserve one&#x27;s experiences than journaling or other writing-based forms of logging. Printed material such as cheap newspapers, visiting cards, playbills, and pamphlets circulated widely during the 19th century and often became the primary components of peoples’ scrapbooks. The growing volume of ephemera of this kind, parallel to the growth of industrialized society, created a demand for methods of cataloguing and preserving them. This is why scrapbooks devoted solely to cataloguing recipes, coupons, or other lists were also common during this time. Until later in the 19th century, scrapbooks were seen as functional as well as aesthetically pleasing. Several factors, including marketing strategies and technological advancement, contributed to the image of scrapbooking moving further toward the aesthetic plane over the years.

The advent of modern photography began with the first permanent photograph created by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce in 1826. This allowed the average person to begin to incorporate photographs into their scrapbooks. However, books or albums made specifically for showcasing photographs alone were not popularized in the United States until closer to 1860. Before that point, photographs were not thought of as items to be reproduced and shared. Demand for photo albums was spurred on in large part by the growing popularity of the carte de visite, a small photograph distributed in the same manner one might a visiting card. 
Old scrapbooks tended to have photos mounted with photomounting corners and perhaps notations of who was in a photo or where and when it was taken. They often included bits of memorabilia like newspaper clippings, letters, etc. An early known American scrapbooker and inventor of scrapbooking supplies was Mark Twain. Twain carried scrapbooks on his travels as he collected souvenirs, clippings, and pictures. Various individuals and communities created scrapbooks throughout the twentieth century in Britain. Among the most ardent scrapbookers of the 18th century was William Henry Dorsey, an artist who collected documents, paintings and artifact pertaining to Black history. Dorsey compiled hundreds of scrapbooks on the lives of Black people during the 18th century and built a collection that he laid out in his home in Philadelphia.

== Modern scrapbooking ==

Marielen Wadley Christensen (pronounced as the names &quot;Mary Ellen&quot;), of Elk Ridge, Utah, United States (formerly of Spanish Fork, Utah) is credited with turning scrapbooking from what was once just the ages-old hobby into the actual industry containing businesses devoted specifically to the manufacturing and sale of scrapbooking supplies. She began designing creative pages for her family&#x27;s photo memories, inserting the completed pages into sheet protectors collected in 3-ring binders. By 1980, she had assembled over fifty volumes and was invited to display them at the World Conference on Records in Salt Lake City. In 1981 Marielen and her husband Anthony Jay (&quot;A.J.&quot;) authored and published a how-to booklet, &quot;Keeping Memories Alive,&quot; and opened a scrapbook store in Spanish Fork that ended up with the same name, that remains open today.
In addition to preserving memories, the hobby is popular for the strong social network that scrapbooking can provide. Hobbyists, known as &quot;scrappers&quot; or &quot;scrapbookers&quot;, get together and scrapbook at each other&#x27;s homes, local scrapbook stores, scrapbooking conventions, retreat centers, and even on cruises. The term &quot;crop&quot;, a reference to cropping or trimming printed photographs, was coined to describe these events.

Following the lead of Keeping Memories Alive (which was originally in the smaller building next door and named The Annex in its early years), many other stores have popped up and cater to the scrapbooking community. These shops provide many of the necessary tools for every scrapbooker&#x27;s needs. Besides Keeping Memories Alive, these include companies such as Creative Memories, Making Memories, Stampin&#x27; Up!, and Close to My Heart.

The scrapbooking industry doubled in size between 2001 and 2004 to $2.5 billion with over 1,600 companies creating scrapbooking products by 2003. Creative Memories, a home-based retailer of scrapbooking supplies founded in 1987, saw $425 million in retail sales in 2004. However, Creative Memories&#x27; parent company filed Chapter 11 in 2013 and became the bankruptcy with the largest debt in the Twin City area.

According to Google Trends, the search terms related to scrapbook and scrapbooking have seen a 70 percent decline since its peak in 2005–2006. However, there is much debate among the community of people who engage in memory keeping about what the decline means for the health and future of the industry as a whole. What seems to be clear is that traditional scrapbooking is once again in a transition period due to many forces including current economic issues, the influence of social media and the ease of digital sharing, and the rejection of the stereotype of traditional scrapbooks being something that is for older women. However, if one takes a closer look, it is easy to see all the ways people continue memory keeping even if it doesn&#x27;t fall strictly within the definition of traditional scrapbooking as defined here.

Some examples include the advent of Smash books created by EK Success, which in some ways, are a closer representation to original scrapbooks in that they are wire bound books in a variety of sizes consisting of blank printed background papers into which one can journal and glue mementos into.

Another variation is the introduction and growth of pocket scrapbooking, most well-known and represented by Project Life created and introduced by Becky Higgins. Higgins created the system in response to her personal desire to continue record the lives of her children and family, but in a quicker, more simple way that allowed her the flexibility to complete the project, but still in an attractive, cohesive way.

One of the newest trends into scrapbooking is bringing the layout designs down to a much smaller size. Small enough to carry in a small bag with on the go updates and area for creativity and memory keeping. A traditional traveler&#x27;s notebook is a simple leather cover with a band to keep closed. The cover can hold up to six inserts which can be used in many ways. The notebook has grown in popularity, allowing for journaling and memory keeping for any interests.

Mini albums are another great way of memory keeping and a new trend in scrapbooking. They can be made in different sizes based on the number of photos to be put inside the album. These mini albums can be constructed and hand made from scratch.

=== Materials ===
The most important scrapbooking supply is the album itself, which can be permanently bound, or allow for the insertion of pages. There are other formats such as mini albums and accordion-style fold-out albums. Some of these are adhered to various containers, such as matchbooks, CD cases, or other small holders. When scrap artists started moving away from the &quot;page&quot; and onto alternative surfaces and objectives, they termed these creations &quot;altered items&quot; or now simply called &quot;off-the-page&quot;. This movement circles back to the history of art from the 1960s when Louise Nevelson was doing &quot;Assemblages&quot; with found objects and recycled parts.

Modern scrapbooking is done largely on 12 inch (30 cm) square or letter-size (US Letter (8.5 by 11 inch) or A4 (210 by 297 mm)) pages. More recently, smaller albums have become popular. The most common new formats are 6, 7, or 8-inch (15, 17.5, or 20 cm) square. It is important to many scrappers to protect their pages with clear page protectors.

Basic materials include background papers (including printed and cardstock paper), photo corner mounts (or other means of mounting photos such as adhesive dots, photo mounting tape, or acid-free glue), scissors, a paper trimmer or cutting tool, art pens, archival pens for journaling, and mounting glues (like thermo-tac). More elaborate designs require more specialized tools such as die cut templates, rubber stamps, craft punches, stencils, inking tools, eyelet setters, heat embossing tools, and personal die cut machines. Many people who enjoy scrapbooking will create their own background papers by using the tools mentioned along with &quot;fancy&quot; textured scissors.

Various accessories, referred to as &quot;embellishments&quot;, are used to decorate scrapbook pages. Embellishments include stickers, rub-ons, stamps, eyelets, brads, chipboard elements in various shapes, alphabet letters, lace, wire, fabric, beads, sequins, and ribbon. The use of die cut machines is also increasingly popular; in recent years a number of electronic die-cutting machines resembling a plotter with a drag knife have hit the market (e.g. The Cricut), enabling scrappers to use their computer to create die cuts out of any shape or font with the use of free or third party software. Scrapbook makers will also use magazine clippings to &quot;decorate&quot; a scrapbook.

One of the key components of modern scrapbooking is the archival quality of the supplies. Designed to preserve photographs and journaling in their original state, materials encouraged by most serious scrapbookers are of a higher quality than those of many typical photo albums commercially available. Scrappers insist on acid-free, lignin-free papers, stamp ink, and embossing powder. In using pigment-based inks, which are fade resistant, colorfast, and often waterproof, scrappers can preserve their works. Many scrappers use buffered paper, which will protect photos from acid in memorabilia used in the scrapbook. Older &quot;magnetic&quot; albums are not acid-free and thus cause damage to the photos and memorabilia included in them. Gloves, too, are used to protect photos from the oil on hands.

An international standard, ISO 18902, provides specific guidelines on materials that are safe for scrapbooking through its requirements for albums, framing, and storage materials. ISO 18902 includes requirements for photo-safety and a specific pH range for acid-free materials. ISO 18902 prohibits the use of harmful materials, including Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and Cellulose nitrate.

=== Digital scrapbooking ===

The new era of digital scrapbooking has allowed many previous inconveniences of scrapbooking to be absolved and for supplies to become readily accessible. Online programs provide all of the features, that could previously only be purchased separately, all in the same place. This includes tools such as colorful paper, stickers, patterns, fonts, etc. All features allow for simple cropping and resizing to fulfill the scrapbooker&#x27;s vision. Furthermore, the addition of designs and templates permit a convenient organization of pictures and quick upload of photos. All the photos and tools are available in one place, making the process easily transportable and well-situated for any location.

The advent of scanners, desktop publishing, page layout programs, and advanced printing options make it relatively easy to create professional-looking layouts in digital form. The internet allows scrapbookers to self-publish their work. Scrapbooks that exist completely in digital image form are referred to as &quot;digital scrapbooks&quot; or &quot;computer scrapbooks&quot;.

While some people prefer the physicality of the actual artifacts they paste onto the pages of books, the digital scrapbooking hobby has grown in popularity in recent years. Some of the advantages include a greater diversity of materials, less environmental impact, cost savings, the ability to share finished pages more readily on the internet, and the use of image editing software to experiment with manipulating page elements in multiple ways without making permanent adjustments. A traditional scrapbook layout may employ a background paper with a torn edge. While a physical page can only be torn once and never restored, a digital paper can be torn and untorn with ease, allowing the scrapbooker to try out different looks without wasting supplies. Some web-based digital scrapbooks include a variety of wallpapers and backgrounds to help the users create a rich visual experience. Each paper, photo, or embellishment exists on its own layer in your document, and you can reposition them at your discretion.

Furthermore, digital scrapbooking is not limited to digital storage and display. Many digital scrappers print their finished layouts to be stored in scrapbook albums. Others have books professionally printed in hard bound books to be saved as keepsakes. Professional printing- and binding-services offer free software to create scrapbooks with professional layouts and individual layout capabilities. Because of the integrated design and order workflow, real hardcover bound books can be produced more cost effectively.

Early digital scrapbooks were created from digital photos uploaded to an external site. Over time, this moved to a model of downloading software onto a personal computer that will organize photos and help create the digital scrapbook. With the growth of Web 2.0 functionality, digital scrapbooking is going back online, to avoid the hassles of having to download and install PC software. The availability of cheap online storage (e.g., on Amazon&#x27;s S3 service), and the desire to leverage pre-uploaded online albums (e.g., on Yahoo&#x27;s Flickr) make it more convenient for users to directly compose their digital scrapbooks online. Print on demand fulfillment enables such digital scrapbooks to effectively supplant traditional scrapbooks.

Digital scrapbooking has advanced to the point where digital scrapbook layouts may be made entirely online using Web-based software. Users upload their photos, create a digital scrapbook layout using a Web page and digital scrapbook graphics. The layout can then be downloaded as a low-resolution JPEG file for sharing on the Web or as a high-resolution JPEG file for printing.

== Crops ==
Scrapbooking crops (or &quot;Crops&quot;) are events where 2 or more scrapbookers gather to work in a social circle on their books, cards or other projects. It is similar to the old quilting bees that used to be socially prevalent, but has been replaced by today&#x27;s &quot;Crop&quot;. Attendees bring specific supplies themselves to work on said projects and sometimes there are vendors at these events to purchase any extra scrapbooking needs. At these events ideas are shared, techniques are taught to one another, products used (e.g. cutting machines such as, Silhouette &amp; Cricut) are learned about and attendees have a few hours to days of uninterrupted time to work on their scrapbooks, cards, or any project they are needing to accomplish. Events are planned informally at one&#x27;s home, a church hall or establishments with meeting rooms to the larger attended crops that encompass days of time in a hotel, where the attendee stays in the same hotel and works in the large ballroom or conference rooms in the hotel with tens to hundreds of attendees. Some of the ways to learn about events are mainly through word of mouth, social media, and community postings.

== Industry statistics ==
Some people attribute the increased interest in scrapbooking to a renewed passion for genealogy, while others say that it is an outlet for those interested in photography and graphic design.

For evidence of interest in scrapbooking, consider the following facts:
* Over 4 million women in the United States alone consider themselves to be scrapbookers.
* Over 4% of all women in U.S. have done traditional scrapbooking. Millions of others do various aspects of photo books but are not scrapbookers.
* Scrapbooking is one of the largest categories within the craft and hobby industry and now considered to be the third most popular craft in the nation. From 1996 through 2004, sales of scrapbooking products increased across the United States. In 2005, annual sales flattened for the first time after many back to back years of double growth. From 2006 through 2010 traditional scrapbooking sales have declined, while digital forms of scrapbooking have grown. Traditional scrapbooking sales for 2010 have declined to about $1.6 billion in annual sales from a peak of about $2.5 billion in 2005.

During that same time frame the number of independent scrapbooking stores declined from a high of 4,200 to about 1,200 independent storefronts. The number of scrapbooking manufacturers also declined in that same period from a high of 800 to under 250.

== Common idioms ==

=== Journaling ===
In addition to the collection of photographs, tickets, postcards, and other memorabilia, journaling is often a principal element in modern scrapbooks. Journaling is text that describes, explains, or accents the photographs on a scrapbook page. Contemporary journaling can take many forms. It can be reflective and story-like, take a reportive tone, or simply be a list of words. Journaling may also include song lyrics, quotations, and poems. The value of journaling lies in the fact that it provides an account of family histories that may otherwise not be preserved.

Many consider journaling one of the most important elements of any scrapbook. Journaling is a personal choice and it can describe the event, the photographs, or relate feelings and emotions. Handwritten journaling is considered best by some scrapbookers who see handwriting as valuable for posterity, but many people journal on the computer and print it onto a variety of surfaces including vellum, tape, ribbon, and paper.

=== Sketches ===
Scrapbookers will sometimes refer to sketches for inspiration for their pages. Sketches are a hand-drawn layout showing where to position photos, titles, journaling, and embellishments. It gives novice scrapbookers somewhere to begin if they are not experienced with balancing the layout correctly. Scrapbookers can interpret the sketch in any way they choose; it is a great starting point when you have scrappers-block. There have been many sketchbooks published and scrapbooking magazines always offer sketches as part of their content.

<doc id="1041458" wikidata="Q1062817" url="?curid=1041458" title="Chaptalization">
<text>Chaptalization is the process of adding sugar to unfermented grape must in order to increase the alcohol content after fermentation. The technique is named after its developer, the French chemist Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal. This process is not intended to make the wine sweeter, but rather to provide more sugar for the yeast to ferment into alcohol.

Chaptalization has generated controversy and discontent in the French wine industry due to advantages that the process is perceived to give producers in poor-climate areas. In response to violent demonstrations by protesters in 1907, the French government began regulating the amount of sugar that can be added to wine.

Chaptalization is sometimes referred to as enrichment, for example in the European Union wine regulations specifying the legality of the practice within EU.

The legality of chaptalization varies by country, region, and even wine type. In general, it is legal in regions that produce grapes with low sugar content, such as the northern regions of France, Germany, and the United States. Chaptalization is, however, prohibited in Argentina, Australia, California, Italy, Portugal, Spain and South Africa. Germany prohibits the practice for making Prädikatswein.
==History==

The technique of adding sugar to grape must has been part of the process of winemaking since the Romans added honey as a sweetening agent. While not realizing the chemical components, Roman winemakers were able to identify the benefits of added sense of body or mouthfeel.

While the process has long been associated with French wine, the first recorded mention of adding sugar to must in French literature was the 1765 edition of &quot;L&#x27;Encyclopedie&quot;, which advocated the use of sugar for sweetening wine over the previously accepted practice of using lead acetate. In 1777, the French chemist Pierre Macquer discovered that the actual chemical benefit of adding sugar to must was an increase in alcohol to balance the high acidity of underripe grapes rather than any perceived increase in sweetness. In 1801, while in the services of Napoleon, Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal began advocating the technique as a means of strengthening and preserving wine.

In the 1840s, the German wine industry was hard hit by severe weather that created considerable difficulty for harvesting ripened grapes in this cool region. A chemist named Ludwig Gall suggested Chaptal&#x27;s method of adding sugar to the must to help wine makers compensate for the effects of detrimental weather. This process of &quot;Verbesserung&quot; (improvement) helped sustain wine production in the Mosel region during this difficult period.

At the turn of the twentieth century, the process became controversial in the French wine industry with vignerons in the Languedoc protesting the production of &quot;artificial wines&quot; that flooded the French wine market and drove down prices. In June 1907, huge demonstrations broke out across the Languedoc region with over 900,000 protesters demanding that the government take action to protect their livelihood. Riots in the city of Narbonne prompted Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau to send the French army to the city. The ensuing clash resulted in the death of five protesters. The following day, Languedoc sympathizers burned the prefecture in Perpignan. In response to the protests, the French government increased the taxation on sugar and passed laws limiting the amount of sugar that could be added to wine.

==Process variations==

Different techniques are employed to adjust the level of sugar in the grape must. In the normal chaptalization process, cane sugar is the most common type of sugar added although some winemakers prefer beet sugar or corn syrup. In many wine regions, brown sugar is an illegal additive, and in regions that disallow chaptalization altogether, grape concentrate may be added. After sugar is added to the must, naturally occurring enzymes break down the sucrose molecules in sugar into glucose and fructose, which are then fermented by the yeast and converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide.

In warmer regions, where overripening is a concern, the opposite process of rehydration (dilution with water) and acidification is used. This is used in jurisdictions such as areas of California, where if the must has excess sugar for normal fermentation, water may be added to lower the concentration. In acidification, tartaric acid is added to the must to compensate for the high levels of sugar and low levels of acid naturally found in ripe grapes.

In Champagne production, measured quantities of sugar, wine, and sometimes brandy are added after fermentation and prior to corking in a process known as dosage. Chaptalization, on the other hand, involves adding sugar prior to fermentation. Champagne producers sometimes employ chaptalization in their winemaking when the wine is still in the form of must.

Some wine journalists contend that chaptalization allows wine makers to sacrifice quality in favor of quantity by letting vines overproduce high yields of grapes that have not fully ripened. Also, winemakers have been using technological advances, such as reverse osmosis to remove water from the unfermented grape juice, thereby increasing its sugar concentration, but decreasing the volume of wine produced.

==Current legality==

Control of chaptalization is fairly strict in many countries, and generally only permitted in more northerly areas where grapes might not ripen enough. In the European Union, the amount of chaptalization allowed depends on the wine growing zone.
Dispensation to add another 0.5% ABV may be given in years when climatic conditions have been exceptionally unfavorable. National wine regulations may further restrict or ban chaptalization for certain classes of wine.

In some areas, such as Germany, wine regulations dictate that the wine makers must label whether or not the wines are &quot;natural,&quot; i.e. without sugar. Other areas, such as France, do not have such label requirements.

In the United States, federal law permits chaptalization when producing natural grape wine from juice with low sugar content. This allows chaptalization in cooler states such as Oregon, or in states such as Florida where the native grape (Muscadine) is naturally low in sugar. However, individual states may still create their own regulations; California, for example, prohibits chaptalization, although California winemakers may add grape concentrate.

<text>The Belfast and County Down Railway (BCDR) was an Irish gauge () railway in Ireland (later Northern Ireland) linking Belfast with County Down. It was built in the 19th century and absorbed into the Ulster Transport Authority in 1948. All but the line between Belfast and Bangor was closed in the 1950s, although some of it has been restored near Downpatrick by a heritage line, the Downpatrick and County Down Railway.

==History==
The company was incorporated on 26 June 1846 with the first section of line from Belfast to Holywood opening for traffic on 2 August 1848. The line was further extended to Bangor by the Belfast, Holywood and Bangor Railway (BHBR), opening on 1 May 1865, and acquired by the BCDR in 1884. The line to Downpatrick was opened on 25 March 1859. The line from Downpatrick to Newcastle was built by the Downpatrick, Dundrum and Newcastle Railway, opening on 25 March 1869 and absorbed by BCDR on 14 July 1884. The railway&#x27;s first chief engineer was Sir John Macneill, who was responsible for allowing the railway to cross the marshy River Quoile.

A branch to Ballynahinch was opened in 1858 via .

A branch line from Downpatrick to Ardglass was opened in 1892, as was a loop line at Downpatrick. This resulted in a &#x27;triangle&#x27;-shaped track layout just outside of Downpatrick, allowing trains between Belfast and Newcastle to collect and drop off passengers at the Loop Platform, who would be ferried between there and the main station at Downpatrick by a local train. Thanks to the triangular layout, trains were still capable of operating directly from the main Downpatrick station to Belfast or Newcastle. The branch from Newcastle to Castlewellan was opened on 24 March 1906.

By 1948 the company had 29 locomotives. Two steam railcars from Kitson &amp; Company were acquired in 1905. The locomotive works were at Belfast Queen&#x27;s Quay railway station and closed in 1950. New carriage works had been opened in 1886, with the last carriage being built in 1923.

==Steamships==
The Belfast, Holywood and Bangor Railway Act 1881 authorised that company not only to have a railway built between Holywood and Bangor but also to run steamships &quot;for the purpose of establishing an improved and efficient communication between Belfast, Holywood and Bangor&quot;. The BHBR did not exercise this power, but several years after it had been taken over by the BCDR, the latter company started running scheduled passenger steamship services on the route.

The BCDR took advice from the Glasgow &amp; South Western Railway (G&amp;SWR), which had been running passenger paddle steamers since 1891. For the 1893 season the G&amp;SWR had ordered a new ship, , to be built by J&amp;G Thomson at Clydebank. The two railways then ordered from Thomson&#x27;s two sister ships of a slightly revised design: for the G&amp;SWR and for the BCDR. Thomson&#x27;s launched &quot;Slieve Donard&quot; on 20 May 1893 and she entered service between Belfast&#x27;s Donegall Quay and Bangor on 20 June. She was named after Slieve Donard, the highest peak in the Mourne Mountains in County Down.

In October 1893 the BCDR ordered a slightly larger paddle steamer, , named after Slieve Bearnagh, the second-highest peak in the Mourne Mountains. She made her first voyage on Belfast Lough on 1 May 1894. &quot;Donard&quot; and &quot;Bearnagh&quot; worked between Donegall Quay and Bangor, between them providing six sailings per day from Mondays to Saturdays and five on Sundays. From Mondays to Saturdays one mid-afternoon sailing per day extended around the coast to Donaghadee. On Saturday afternoons other sailings continued from Bangor across Belfast Lough to Larne.

Later that summer a local steamer line, the New Belfast, Bangor and Larne Steamboat Company, went into liquidation and the BCDR bought two of its ships, and , from the receivers. These ships were older and smaller than those that Thomson had supplied, and the BCDR seemed to have made little use of them. &quot;Bangor Castle&quot; had been on charter to the Southampton, Isle of Wight and South of England Royal Mail Steam Packet Company since 1888 and was scrapped in 1899.

In 1899 the railway sold &quot;Slieve Donard&quot; to Alexander Campbell, co-founder of the P &amp; A Campbell pleasure steamer company. &quot;Slieve Bearnagh&quot; remained with the B&amp;CDR, occasionally making excursions to Portaferry on the Ards Peninsula, Ardglass in south Down, and Larne and Portrush on the coast of County Antrim in addition to her regular scheduled route on Belfast Lough.

At the end of the 1911 summer season the BCDR put &quot;Slieve Bearnagh&quot; up for sale and ordered a new paddle steamer, again slightly larger than her predecessors. A &amp; J Inglis of Pointhouse, Glasgow launched the new ship, PS &quot;Erin&#x27;s Isle&quot;, on 12 June 1912 and fitted her out in less than a month. On 19 June 1912 the railway sold &quot;Slieve Bearnagh&quot; to D&amp;J Nicol of Dundee for service on the east coast of Scotland. &quot;Erin&#x27;s Isle&quot; was in BCDR service from 12 July 1912 until her fourth summer season ended on 29 September 1915. On 20 November 1915 the Admiralty requisitioned her for £400 per month to be a Royal Navy minesweeper. On 7 May 1919 she was sunk by a mine, for which the Admiralty paid £53,676 compensation. However, the railway found that a new ship would cost £64,000 and decided not to return to owning steamships.

==Ulster Transport Authority==
In 1946 the Northern Ireland Government announced that it would unite under a single authority all public transport that was wholly within Northern Ireland. The Transport Act (NI) 1948 created the Ulster Transport Authority which took over the BCDR on 1 October 1948 and the Northern Counties Committee on 1 April 1949.

On 15 January 1950 the UTA withdrew services on the former BCDR lines between Comber and Newcastle; Ballynahinch Junction and Ballynahinch; and Downpatrick and Ardglass. The Northern Ireland Transport Tribunal had authorised these closures on 15 December 1949.

The UTA withdrew services between Ballymacarrett Junction and Donaghadee on 22 April 1950. The line between Castlewellan and Newcastle remained open until 1 May 1955, served by Great Northern Railway Board trains to and from Banbridge. Once these two sections had been closed, the line between Belfast and Bangor was the only part of the former BCDR that remained open.

When the UTA took it over, the BCDR had 29 locomotives, 181 carriages and 25 other coaching vehicles, 629 wagons mostly covered vans and wagons but also including some 6-wheeled fish vans, and 54 service vehicles.

==Incidents and accidents==
In the Ballymacarrett rail crash of 1871, on 13 May, 2 died and 55 were injured when a passenger train ran into a derailed goods train at Ballymacarrett Junction. The goods train derailed when a drunken fireman drove the train into an unfinished turnout, fouling the line.

In the Ballymacarrett rail crash, on 10 January 1945, 22 passengers died and 27 were injured when a railmotor car ran into the rear of a conventional train stopped at a signal at Ballymacarrett Junction. The 7.40 a.m. rail motor Holywood to Belfast crashed into the rear of the 7.10 a.m. Bangor to Belfast train. The darkness and local fog were a factor but the driver of the rail motor was held to blame. The Railway had to pay out some £80,000 in compensation, which crippled the company financially, leading to its early nationalisation in 1948.

==Downpatrick and County Down Railway==
The Downpatrick and County Down Railway (DCDR) operates the only Irish Gauge heritage railways in Northern Ireland on part of the former BCDR Belfast-Newcastle main line. It has fully restored and operates several miles of track, including the famous &#x27;Downpatrick Loop&#x27;, complete with original restored platform. The DCDR operates four railway stations on the line, one of which was the original BCDR Loop Platform. The railway holds a vast collection of BCDR rolling stock and museum artefacts, the majority of which are on display for the public to enjoy. The DCDR&#x27;s logo is based on a monogram previously used by the BCDR.

== Preservation ==

Seven carriages that were once owned by the Belfast and County Down Railway have survived into preservation. Among them are three six-wheeled carriages built at Queen&#x27;s Quay by the BCDR, one of the railway&#x27;s three railmotors, an 1897 composite bogie coach, the BCDR&#x27;s royal saloon No. 153, and a six-wheeled carriage built at Dundalk by the Great Northern Railway that was later purchased by the BCDR. All of these apart from six-wheeled third No. 18, built at Queen&#x27;s Quay, are located at the Downpatrick and County Down Railway. So far, bogie coach No. 148 and ex-railmotor No. 72 have been fully restored, while No. 153 is part-way through overhaul. The other coaches owned by the railway are awaiting maintenance on site.

In addition, one BCDR locomotive has been preserved at the Ulster Transport Museum: BCDR No. 30, which was built in 1901 by Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company. The engine was renumbered 230 by the Ulster Transport Authority in 1951, and preserved by the company for static display. It is one of only 19 remaining 5&#x27; 3&quot; gauge steam locomotives left in Ireland.

==After closure==
Much of the line between Belfast and Newcastle was lifted in the early- to mid-1950s by the Ulster Transport Authority, shortly after the closure of the line. Some of the trackbed was purchased by farmers, while some was later used for walkways: for example, the stretch of former line North of Dundrum. As already mentioned, some of the line was relaid by the Downpatrick and County Down Railway.

The line from Belfast to Comber was converted in the 2000s to The Comber Greenway, a walk and cycleway.

<text>Squirt is a caffeine-free, grapefruit-flavored, carbonated soft drink, created in 1938 in Phoenix, Arizona. Squirt competes primarily against The Coca-Cola Company&#x27;s Fresca.

== History ==
Squirt was created by Herb Bishop in 1938. Squirt was manufactured in the Beet Sugar Factory in Glendale, Arizona until 1981.

In 1941, a little boy mascot known as &quot;Lil&#x27; Squirt&quot; was created for marketing the product. Squirt became a popular soft drink in many parts of the country, especially the West and Southwest. In the 1950s, it became commonly used as a mixer in cocktails.

In 1978, Squirt was sold to Michigan bottler Beverage America. In 1986, Squirt was acquired by A&amp;W. In October 1993 A&amp;W Beverages was folded into Cadbury Schweppes. 

In May 2008, Cadbury Schweppes spun off Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages into an independent company called the Dr Pepper Snapple Group, and renamed itself to Cadbury plc. Dr Pepper/Seven Up still exists as a trademark and brand name as of 2024.

On July 9, 2018, Keurig acquired the Dr Pepper Snapple Group in an $18.7 billion deal. The combined company was renamed &quot;Keurig Dr Pepper&quot;.

== Product line ==
Squirt is naturally flavored but contains less than 2% grapefruit juice. Like many other soft drinks, its packaging has varied over the years. 

In 1983, Diet Squirt, the first soft drink in the United States to be sweetened with aspartame, was introduced.

In the mid 1980s, a vitamin-C-enriched Diet Squirt Plus was briefly marketed.

In the early 1990s, Squirt Sorbet, a frozen treat, was offered in Detroit area supermarkets.

Berry-flavored Ruby Red and Diet Ruby Red Squirt have also been introduced. Unlike regular Squirt, Ruby Red Squirt contains caffeine.

In 2008, Squirt Citrus Power was introduced. Unlike regular Squirt, Squirt Citrus Power is caffeinated, lacks concentrated grapefruit juice, and contains taurine and other ingredients similar to an energy drink.

<text>Christopher Patrick Baird (born 25 February 1982) is a Northern Irish former professional footballer who last played for Derby County and represented the Northern Ireland national football team from 2003 to 2016. His preferred position was right-back or centre-half, but he also played on occasion as a left-back, defensive midfielder and central midfielder. In addition to his three-year stint at Derby County, Baird previously played for Southampton, Fulham, Reading, Burnley and West Bromwich Albion.

==Club career==

===Southampton===
Baird started his career at Northern Irish club, Ballymena United, before moving to Southampton in 1998. Baird went on to make his progress through the Southampton&#x27;s Academy and in 2001, Baird signed his first professional contract with the club, keeping him until 2002.

Baird made his debut for Southampton on 22 March 2003 as a late substitute for David Prutton in a 2–2 draw at home to Aston Villa. His second appearance came in a 6–1 defeat at Arsenal, when he came on after 26 minutes to replace Fabrice Fernandes, with Arsenal already 5–0 up. Baird&#x27;s first start came on the final day of the 2002–03 League season, in a 1–0 win at Manchester City. A week later, he started for Southampton in the 2003 FA Cup final, also against Arsenal. Southampton lost the match 1–0, but Baird was voted as the Saints man of the match.

In the 2003–04 season, Baird struggled to make the first team and was loaned out to Walsall on a one–month deal. Baird made his Walsall debut on 27 September 2003, in a 2–1 win over Preston North End. Baird then provided an assist for one of the goals for Darren Wrack, in a 2–0 win over Wigan Athletic on 25 October 2003. Baird&#x27;s regular playing time in the first team saw him extend his loan spell at Walsall for another month, leading manager Colin Lee to unsuccessfully try to sign him for £1 million. Baird was sent off in his last appearance for Walsall, when he received a second yellow card, in a 0–0 draw against Crystal Palace on 21 November 2003.

After his loan spell at Walsall came to an end, Baird made his first Southampton appearance of the 2003–04 season, in a 3–1 win over local rivals Portsmouth on 21 December 2003. With his first team opportunities limited, Baird joined Watford on a month loan. Baird made his Watford debut on 20 March 2004, in a 4–1 loss against Ipswich Town. On 16 April 2004, Baird&#x27;s loan spell at Watford extended until the end of the season. After making eight appearances for Watford, Baird returned to his parent club and played the last game of the season. Baird made only four league appearances for Southampton.

Ahead of the 2004–05 season, Baird said he was considering leaving Southampton if he does not get a guarantee first team place under new manager Paul Sturrock. Nevertheless on 1 July 2004, Baird signed a two–year contract with the club. Despite guarantee of first team football under Sturrock, Baird, however, was left out the squad for Saints&#x27; pre-season tour of Sweden. As a result, Baird&#x27;s lack of first opportunities frustrated him and was planned on re-joining Watford on loan, only to be blocked by Harry Redknapp. Baird never made an appearance for the club in the 2004–05 season, as the club were relegated to the Championship.
Following Southampton&#x27;s relegation from the Premiership, Baird was told by Redknapp that he was to be loaned out to get first experience, but this never happened. After Redknapp&#x27;s departure to Portsmouth, Baird made his first Southampton appearance in two years in a 1–0 win over Luton Town on 11 December 2005. He started 16 league games in the 2005–06 season. Despite this, Baird signed a three–year contract with the club.

In the first game of the 2006–07 season, away to Derby County on 6 August 2006, he was drafted into the centre half position when Claus Lundekvam went off injured in the sixth minute. On 25 November 2006, in his 50th first-team game for Southampton, he scored his first professional goal in a 2–1 victory over Luton Town. Having established himself in the Southampton team, he was singled out for praise by Southampton manager George Burley. During the match in a 4–3 win over against Birmingham City on 29 November 2006, Baird find himself in alteration with goalkeeper Kelvin Davis after the pair shoved each other and the tension were so high that teammates got involved to calm the situation. However, this was played down by Burley. His second goal of the season came on 26 December 2006, in a 1–1 draw against Crystal Palace. Baird then scored his third goal of the same on 13 March 2007, in a 2–2 draw against Cardiff City. Despite missing out two matches, due to a groin injury, Baird spent most of the 2006–07 season in central defence, making forty–four appearances and at the end of the season he was the winner of the Saints Player of the Season award.

At the end of the 2006–07 season, Baird found himself in a transfer move when Fulham made an initial £2.5m bid for him, which was rejected by Southampton. In response, Baird informed the club that he wanted to leave by handing in a transfer request. Despite being confident of keeping Baird, Burley, stated that he would sell Baird at the right price. In response to Burley&#x27;s comment, Fulham increased their bid to sign Baird. Baird, himself, later stated it wasn&#x27;t an easy decision to leave Southampton.

===Fulham===
Baird left Southampton on 12 July 2007 to move to Premier League club Fulham for £3.025 million, where he linked up with manager Lawrie Sanchez. Baird was also linked with a move to Sunderland, but was in favour in joining Fulham.

Baird made his Fulham debut, in the opening game of the season, in a 2–1 loss against Arsenal. Weeks later on 25 August 2007, Baird was sent–off after receiving a second bookable offence, in a 2–1 loss against Aston Villa and served a suspension in the second round in the League Cup against Shrewsbury Town. However, Baird struggled to make a first team breakthrough, due to injuries and was fell out favour for the remainder of the season, under Manager Roy Hodgson. Despite this, Baird made eighteen appearances in his first season at Fulham. Due to lack of first team opportunity, Baird was linked with a move to Scottish Premier League side Rangers.

Having initially worn the number 34 shirt, he changed to the number 6 for the 2009–10 season. Although typically a centre-back, and often surplus to requirements behind the rarely injured pairing of Aaron Hughes and Brede Hangeland, manager Roy Hodgson brought out a versatility in Baird which made him indispensable for long periods at Fulham, where first he filled in very successfully at right-back when John Paintsil was injured, and then due to the injuries to Dickson Etuhu and Danny Murphy he was often used in a central midfield role during the 2009–10 season, returning to right-back when they regained fitness. His success at right-back also earned him a start in the UEFA Europa League against Atlético Madrid ahead of the fit-again Paintsil. The season saw Baird redeem himself at Fulham, where he made thirty–two appearances for the club.

In the 2010–11 season, Baird remained on the substitute for the first three matches, with Panstil regaining his first team place as a right–back, under new manager Mark Hughes. It wasn&#x27;t until on 11 September 2010 when Baird made his first appearance of the season, in a 2 – 1 win over Wolves. On 14 September 2010 Baird signed a new contract with Fulham, keeping him at Craven Cottage until at least the summer of 2013, and on 28 December 2010 he scored his first and second goals for Fulham against Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium in a 2–0 victory. This was voted the second Fulham &quot;Goal of the Season&quot; by the Fulham fans, just behind his teammate Mousa Dembélé. Both were long-range strikes, earning him the nickname &quot;Bairdinho&quot; amongst Fulham fans. Baird was charged with abusive and insulting gestures towards a match official during a match against Liverpool on 9 May 2011, after he played the full 90 minutes and picked up a yellow card by referee Lee Mason in the 5–2 defeat at Craven Cottage. He then subsequently missed the last two games of the season against Birmingham City and Arsenal and was replaced by Philippe Senderos. Despite this, Baird made twenty–nine appearances for the club in the 2010–11 season.

The 2011–12 season was a less successful one for Baird. With the arrival of Martin Jol as manager he found it difficult to get games, having to rely mostly on injuries to in-form right-back Stephen Kelly, but his proven versatility meant that he was almost always on the bench, and was the go-to substitute for central midfield, right-back and sometimes centre-back as well. Despite making nineteen appearances for the club in the 2011–12 season, Baird dismissed claims he heading for an exit and expressed desire to fight for his first team place.

With Kelly falling out of favour in the early part of the 2012–13 season, and injuries to players like Mahamadou Diarra, plus the departures of Danny Murphy, Mousa Dembélé and Dickson Etuhu, Baird has become a regular in central midfield again, alongside Steve Sidwell, and with just those two goals at Stoke to his name for Fulham in 113 games prior to 20 October 2012, he scored in consecutive weeks at the end of October, the first being the winner in the 1–0 defeat of Aston Villa and then scoring a header in a 3–3 draw with Reading on 27 October 2012. In January transfer window, Baird started negotiations with a move to West Brom, but the move to West Brom was broken down and stayed at Fulham. Baird sat out from the first team and made nineteen appearances for the 2012–13 season.

Baird was one of twelve players released by Fulham at the end of the 2012–13 Premier League season.

===Reading===
Despite training with QPR for two weeks and receiving a contract offer, Baird signed for Reading on 20 September 2013 on a deal until January 2014.

He made his debut the next day in a 3–1 win over Derby at Pride Park. Then on 9 November 2013, Baird provided assist for Garath McCleary to score the opener, in a 1–1 draw against QPR. However, a few weeks later, Baird sustained ankle injury that kept him out in the sidelined for weeks. But on 20 January 2014, Baird&#x27;s contract was expired and left the club.

===Burnley===
After being left without a club since leaving Reading in January, Baird signed for Burnley on 20 March 2014 on a short-term deal until May 2014.

Two days after signing for the club, Baird made his Burnley debut, playing as a right–back, in a 3–0 win over Charlton Athletic. After the match, Baird said it was nice to make his return to the pitch, in addition, with a victory, though he was tired during the game. Two weeks later on 5 April 2014, Baird then provided assist for Scott Arfield, in a 1–1 draw against Watford.

At the end of the 2013–14 season, Baird went on to make seven appearances, as he played a little role of helping Burnley reaching promotion to the Premier League. Despite this, the club was keen to keep a hold of Baird beyond the season.

===West Bromwich Albion===
Baird returned to the Premier League on 7 July 2014, signing a one-year contract at West Bromwich Albion.

Baird made his West Brom debut, coming on as a substitute for Chris Brunt in the 77th minute, in the opening game of the season, with a 2–2 draw against Sunderland. Baird then made his first start for the club on 22 November 2014, in a 2–0 loss against Chelsea. However, Baird struggled in the first team, due to being on the substitute bench and injuries. Towards the end of the season, Baird initially played in the left–back position, but soon played in defensive–midfielder for four matches.

At the end of the 2014–15 season, it was announced that Baird was released by the club.

===Derby County===
After leaving West Brom, Baird signed for Derby County in June 2015 on a two-year contract. Upon joining the club, Baird was given a number twelve shirt.

Ahead of the 2015–16 season, Baird was given the captain armband, succeeding Richard Keogh, under the new management of Paul Clement. Upon learning he was the new captain, Baird said it was an honour, while Manager Clement cited his responsibilities and great qualities as the reason he was appointed captain.

Baird made his Derby County debut in the opening game of the season, in a 0–0 draw against Bolton Wanderers. Baird remained as captain for the first six matches, playing in the right–back and defensive midfielder until he suffered a concussion during a match against Preston North End and missed two matches as a result. After making his first team return against MK Dons on 26 September 2015, Baird was dropped to the substitute bench and played six times between October and December.

However, Baird struggled to be in the first team, having been sidelined to substitute bench and injuries. As a result, Baird lost his first team place to Cyrus Christie. Following Clement&#x27;s sacking, Baird was removed as a captain and captaincy was returned to Keogh for the remainder of the season. Baird played his last game as captain on 6 February 2016, in a 1–1 draw against Fulham. Baird went on to make fourteen league appearances for Derby County in his first season.
On 18 February 2016, Baird re–joined his former club Fulham on loan until the end of the season. Baird then made his Fulham debut two days later, playing forty–five minutes after coming on as a substitute, in a 3–0 win over Charlton Athletic. But unfortunately in mid–March, Baird suffered ankle injury. After missing three matches, Baird then made his return to the first team the following month on 9 April 2016, coming on as a substitute in the 77th minute, in a 2–1 win over Cardiff City.

Despite hopes of re-joining the club permanently, Baird was recalled from his loan on 2 May 2016. He was released by Derby at the end of the 2017–18 season.

In February 2019, Baird announced his retirement as a player with immediate effect.

==International career==
On 3 June 2003, Baird made his Northern Ireland début against Italy in a 2–0 defeat, becoming a regular member of the national side, despite playing little domestically between 2003 and 2005. 

In March 2007, Baird was called up by the national team despite sustaining a groin injury against Colchester United a week before. Baird missed two international matches as a result. Northern Ireland FA deemed it a failure to comply to call-up, thus invoked a FIFA rule which states that &quot;any player who fails to comply with a call-up for whatever reason may not play for his club for the duration of the call-up plus one day,&quot; and Southampton would risk points deduction by playing him during the said period. Baird then made his 50th international cap on 25 March 2011 and was given a captaincy against Serbia. He was previously given a captaincy in August 2007 against Liechtenstein in a Euro 2008 qualifier.

On 18 May 2016, Baird was selected as part of the provisional 27-man squad to represent Northern Ireland in the UEFA Euro 2016 competition. On 28 May 2016, Baird was named in the final 23 man Euro 2016 squad for Northern Ireland.

On 17 August 2016, Baird announced his retirement from international football.

==Personal life==
In September 2010 his mother&#x27;s home in Rasharkin was petrol bombed by the loyalists in a sectarian attack.

Baird became a father on New Years Day in 2005 when his partner gave birth to a daughter, Shannon. In May 2006, Baird and his partner, Sarah, were married.

<text>Włodzimierz Bonawentura Krzyżanowski (; in some sources, misspelled Wladimir Krzyzanowski; 8 July 1824 – 31 January 1887) was a Polish-American engineer, politician, and brigadier general in the Union Army.

A Polish noble, he took part in the 1846 uprising against Prussia and left Poland after the uprising&#x27;s suppression. During the American Civil War he enlisted in the United States&#x27; Union Army, recruited a company of Polish immigrants, and became colonel of the 58th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, listed in the official Army Register as the &quot;Polish Legion&quot;.

In the July 1863 Battle of Gettysburg, Krzyżanowski helped repel an evening assault by the famed Louisiana Tigers on the Union defenses atop East Cemetery Hill.

After the war he held several government posts, though it is disputed whether he was, as has often been stated, the first American administrator of Alaska Territory.

==Early life==
Krzyżanowski was born in Rożnowo, Grand Duchy of Poznań, into an old Polish noble family that bore the Świnka coat of arms, and whose roots reached back to the 14th century and ownership of the village of Krzyżanowo near Kościan. Krzyżanowski&#x27;s father and both uncles had fought for Polish independence under Napoleon&#x27;s banners, and his brother fought in the November 1830 Uprising.
Krzyżanowski was first cousin to Frédéric Chopin, whose mother Justyna Krzyżanowska&#x27;s brother was Włodzimierz Krzyżanowski&#x27;s father.

After the death of Krzyżanowski&#x27;s father, the family fell into debt and had to leave their estate. The mother sent Włodzimierz to relatives in Poznań, while the rest of the family moved to Warsaw. Young Krzyżanowski attended St. Mary Magdalen &quot;Gymnasium&quot; in Poznań, a principal center of the Polish nationalist underground in Prussian Poland.

Krzyżanowski took part in the 1846 uprising against Prussia and, after its suppression, fled Poland to avoid arrest. He went to the Free City of Hamburg, from which he sailed to New York, eventually arriving on January 25, 1847. In the United States he learned the English language and continued his education.

After completing his education, Krzyżanowski worked as a civil engineer and surveyor in Virginia and was instrumental in pushing America&#x27;s railroads west. There he made the acquaintance of General Burnett and married his daughter Caroline, with whom he moved to Washington, D.C., to set up his own company, which brought him substantial wealth. He also became active in Republican Party politics. In 1860 he supported Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s candidacy for president of the United States.

==Civil War==
In Washington, D.C., in early 1861, Krzyżanowski enlisted as a private two days after President Abraham Lincoln called for volunteers. Krzyżanowski recruited a company of Polish immigrants, one of the first companies of Union soldiers. He moved the company to New York City, enlisted more immigrants, and soon became colonel of the 58th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, listed in the official Army Register as the &quot;Polish Legion&quot;.

Krzyżanowski participated in the battles of Cross Keys in the Shenandoah Valley, and Second Bull Run (Second Manassas), where he was injured when his horse fell, Chancellorsville, where his brigade and the corps they were part of were routed by a Confederate flank attack, and Gettysburg in the Eastern Theater.

President Lincoln appointed Krzyżanowski brigadier general on November 26, 1862. The appointment expired by law on March 4, 1863, because the U.S. Senate failed to confirm the promotion. The Senate belatedly approved the appointment on March 9, 1863, but recalled it March 11, 1863, returned it to President Lincoln on March 12, 1863, and tabled it on March 13, 1863, keeping the expiration of the appointment in effect.

At Gettysburg on 1 July 1863 his men were pushed back through the town as the Union XI Corps retreated. During this action, Krzyżanowski was injured when his horse stumbled. However, next day he led a counterattack on Cemetery Hill that helped stabilize the faltering Union line.

Later in the year, the XI Corps was sent to the Western Theater to help raise the Confederate siege of Chattanooga. Krzyżanowski played a role in the Battle of Wauhatchie, where he followed Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker&#x27;s orders very literally, and was present at the Battle of Missionary Ridge.

When the XI Corps was dissolved, much of it being added to XX Corps, Krzyżanowski was assigned to command at Bridgeport, Alabama, to guard the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad, and later to Stevenson, Alabama, both commands within the Department of the Cumberland. He also commanded the 3rd Brigade of the Defenses of the Nashville &amp; Chattanooga Railroad, reporting to Maj. Gen. Robert H. Milroy.

On 2 March 1865 President Lincoln nominated Krzyżanowski for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from 2 March 1865. The U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on 9 March 1865. Krzyżanowski was mustered out of the volunteers on 1 October 1865.

==Postbellum==
After the war, Krzyżanowski was given governing duties in Alabama. He later served as the appointed governor of Georgia. Supposedly he also served as the first American administrator of Alaska Territory. However, the &quot;Anchorage Daily News&quot; was unable to find conclusive information to support or disprove this claim. It is said that the supposed posting was a reward for his services as personal representative of Secretary William H. Seward during the negotiations for the purchase of Alaska.

He served in the U.S. Treasury Department and later in the customs service in Panama and New York.

Krzyżanowski died in New York City. On 13 October 1937, the 50th anniversary of his death, his remains were transferred with military honors from Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York, to Arlington National Cemetery. President Franklin D. Roosevelt broadcast a nationwide tribute via radio, and Poland&#x27;s president, Ignacy Mościcki, transmitted his from Warsaw.

==Legacy==
Krzyżanowski&#x27;s legacy was honored by the American Polish Civil War Centennial Committee during the 1960s, which lobbied politicians for a greater appreciation of his remembrance. Thomas J. Lane pushed for House Joint Resolution 707, which would have made 9 July 1962 &quot;Gen. Kryzanowski Memorial Day&quot;. The resolution did not, however, receive sufficient support from Congress.

<text>The Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics (KITP) is a research institute of the University of California, Santa Barbara dedicated to theoretical physics. KITP is one of 20 Kavli Institutes.

The National Science Foundation has been the principal supporter of the institute since it was founded as the Institute for Theoretical Physics in 1979. In a 2007 article in the &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot;, KITP was given the highest impact index in a comparison of nonbiomedical research organizations across the United States.

== About ==
In the early 2000s, the institute, formerly known as the Institute for Theoretical Physics, or ITP, was named after businessman and philanthropist Fred Kavli, in recognition of his donation of $7.5 million to the institute.

Kohn Hall, which houses KITP, is located just beyond the Henley Gate at the East Entrance of the UCSB campus. The building was designed by the Driehaus Prize winner and New Classical architect Michael Graves, and a new wing designed by Graves was added in 2003–2004.

== Members ==
The directors of the KITP have been:

* Walter Kohn, 1979–1984 (Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 1998) 
* Robert Schrieffer, 1984–1989 (Nobel Prize for Physics, 1972)
* James S. Langer, 1989–1995 (Oliver Buckley Prize (APS), 1997)
* James Hartle, 1995–1997 (Einstein Prize (APS), 2009)
* David Gross, 1997–2012 (Nobel Prize in Physics, 2004)
* Lars Bildsten, 2012–present (Helen B. Warner Prize (AAS), 1999; Dannie Heineman Prize for Astrophysics (AAS &amp; American Institute of Physics), 2017)

The Director, Deputy Director Mark Bowick, and Permanent Members of the KITP (Leon Balents, Lars Bildsten, David Gross, and Boris Shraiman) are also on the faculty of the UC Santa Barbara Physics Department. Former Permanent Members include Joseph Polchinski and Physics Nobel laureate Frank Wilczek.

<text>The British 30th Division was a New Army division that was originally made up of battalions raised by public subscription or private patronage. The division was taken over by the British War Office in August 1915 and moved to France in December. It served on the Western Front for the duration of the First World War.

==Formation==
On 28 July 1914, the First World War started. Seven days later, on 4 August, Germany invaded Belgium and the United Kingdom entered the war to uphold the Treaty of London (1839). Britain faced a continental war it was not prepared to fight, and while the Expeditionary Force was dispatched to France and Belgium, the country lacked the forces required for the protracted war envisioned by the military leadership.

On 5 August, Herbert Kitchener was appointed Secretary of State for War. This position allowed Kitchener a largely independent role within the war cabinet. His first act, the next day, was to request parliamentary approval to increase the strength of the British Army by 500,000 men. Over the following days, the Army Council laid out plans for Kitchener&#x27;s proposed expansion: traditional recruitment would be used to expand the regular army, bypassing the county associations and thus avoiding expanding the Territorial Force. The first wave, originally termed the New Expeditionary Force, became the First New Army. Historian Peter Simkins wrote that Kitchener held the Territorial Force in disdain, calling it an ill-trained &quot;Town Clerk&#x27;s Army&quot;, and this was partially why he set up a parallel recruitment system. Simkins noted that it would be a &quot;gross oversimplification to ascribe Kitchener&#x27;s decision merely to prejudice and ignorance&quot;. Had the Territorial Force been used as the basis for expansion it would have been &quot;swamped&quot; and &quot;rendered temporarily incapable of carrying out any function at all&quot;, when a &quot;viable home defence force&quot; was needed due to the threat of a German invasion.

On 10 December 1914, the formation of the Fifth New Army was authorized and consisted of the 37th Division with the 110th, the 111th, and the 112th brigades. Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby was instrumental in raising pals battalions for the King&#x27;s Regiment (Liverpool) and the Manchester Regiment, which formed the basis of these newly formed brigades and the division. In April 1915, the Fourth New Army was broken-up to provide reinforcements for other new army divisions. This resulted in a series of number and name changes, with the Fifth New Army becoming the Fourth; the 37th Division was renumbered as the 30th Division; and the 110th and 111th Brigades became the 89th and 90th Brigades. The 112th Brigade was transferred to the 35th Division, and was exchanged with the 126th Brigade that was renumbered as the 91st when it joined the 30th.

The division started to assemble, as a single formation, in April 1915 near Grantham and the first general officer commanding (Major-General William Fry) was appointed on 4 May 1915. The final elements of the division did not join until August, owing to equipment shortages. On 14 September, the division departed Lincolnshire for Larkhill in the Salisbury Plain Training Area to undergo final training before being deployed to France. This lasted until 31 October, when the order for deployment was received. While advance parties left for France the next day, the rest of the formation was reviewed on 4 November by Edward Stanley. Two days later, a move to Southampton and Folkestone took place. Troops sent to the former were transported to Le Havre, while those sent to the later were dispatched to France via Boulogne. By 12 November, the division had finished its move and was located at Ailly-le-Haut-Clocher, northwest of Amiens. While some sort of insignia was displayed on the helmet and worn on the uniform sleeves once deployed, little is known of what they consisted of.

==Service during the First World War==
During 1916, the division fought in the Battle of the Somme, specifically: the Battle of Albert (including the First day on the Somme and the capture of Montauban), the Capture of Trônes Wood, and the Battle of Le Transloy. In 1917, it took part in the First and the Second battles of the Scarpe, which formed part of the larger Battle of Arras; this was followed by the Battle of Pilckem Ridge later in the year. The final year of the war saw the division engaged in the 1918 First Battle of the Somme, including the Battle of St. Quentin, actions at the crossing of the Somme, and the Battle of Rosieres. This was followed by the Battle of the Lys. Following these battles, the remnants of the infantry were withdrawn rendering the formation a division in name only. In July, it was reconstituted as a fighting formation. Around this time, a variation of the crest of the Stanley family–an eagle standing above a swaddled infant–was adopted as the divisional insignia. The formation then went on to take part in the culminating offensive of the war, the Hundred Days Offensive. The division&#x27;s total losses during the war amounted to 35,182 killed, wounded, or reported as missing.

Following the armistice of 11 November 1918, the division moved back away from the frontline area until it reached the vicinity of Blaringhem, with the HQ based at Renescure, on 4 December. Towards the end of the month, the formation was tasked with supporting efforts at the army&#x27;s supply ports at Dunkirk, Calais, Boulogne, and Étaples and relocated to them in January. By the middle of the following month, it was only supporting the ports at Boulogne and Étaples. Meanwhile, demobilization had started although the division&#x27;s first troops did not return to the UK until May and the process had finished by 1 September when the division ceased to exist.

<text>The 32nd Division was an infantry division of the British Army that was raised in 1914, during the First World War.

==Formation history==
The Division was one of those created for Kitchener&#x27;s Fifth New Army (&#x27;K5&#x27;) on 10 December 1914 and was originally numbered 38th until the six K4 divisions were converted into reserve units. It landed in France in November 1915. Major-General Reginald Barnes took command of the division for a short while in November 1916 before being replaced by the controversial Major-General Cameron Shute.

The division was raised from volunteers for Lord Kitchener&#x27;s New Armies, made up of infantry &#x27;Pals battalions&#x27; and artillery brigades raised by public subscription or private patronage. The division was taken over by the War Office in September 1915. It served in France and Belgium in the trenches of the Western Front for the duration of the war. It saw action at the Battle of the Somme, the Pursuit to the Hindenburg Line, the Defence of Nieuport, the German spring offensive, and the Allied Hundred Days Offensive beginning at the Battle of Amiens.

32nd Division was occupying Avesnes when the Armistice with Germany came into effect on 11 November. Two days later it was informed that it would take part in the advance to the Rhine, which began on 19 November. However, the division was halted on the Meuse between Dinant and Namur, to act as reserve for the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR). On 28 January 1919 the division began entraining for Bonn and on 3 February it took over the southern sector of the Cologne bridgehead while demobilisation of individuals continued. On 15 March the division was renamed the Lancashire Division in BAOR, and war-raised units were progressively replaced by Regulars during 1919. During the war the division lost 34,226 killed, wounded and missing.

<text>Aceair SA was a Swiss aircraft manufacturer established in Manno in 1999. It was developing the AERIKS 200 in kitplane form.

== Status ==

Aceair ceased operation in 2004, and with it the Aeriks 200 project was cancelled. This was principally due to Diamond Engines cancelling the manufacture of the rotary engine the 200 was based around.
Some assets of the company were purchased by a pair of entrepreneurs, and so the Aeriks 200 may eventually see commercial launch someday.

<text>Mohammad-Ali Jamālzādeh Esfahani (; 13 January 1892 in Isfahan, Iran – 8 November 1997 in Geneva, Switzerland) was one of the most prominent writers of Iran in the 20th century, best known for his unique style of humour. In view of his vast influence over Persian short story writing, he is often referred to as the father of this genre in Iran.

==Biography==

===Early years and family===
Sayyed Mohammad-Ali Jamalzadeh was born in Esfahan into a middle-class family. The date of his birth is uncertain; years between 1892 and 1896 have been mentioned and, by the end of his life, even he himself was not certain of the actual year. The year 1895 has traditionally been taken as the year of his birth.

Jamalzadeh&#x27;s father, Sayyed Jamal ad-Din Esfahani, was a progressive and popular pro-constitutional mullah, preacher and writer who
became a constitutional revolutionary, delivering raging sermons that inspired his son but cost him his life; he was executed in 1908 on the order of Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar who considered him among the most dangerous of his enemies.

===Living abroad===

The young Jamalzadeh lived in Iran only until he was twelve or thirteen. Thereafter, he lived in Lebanon, where he attended the Aintoura Catholic School (1908) near Beirut, in France (1910), and in Switzerland where he studied law at University of Lausanne and later at University of Burgundy in Dijon, France.

After his father&#x27;s death, Jamalzadeh&#x27;s life took a turn for the worse, but thanks to many supporting friends and to occasional paid teaching jobs, he survived starvation. By the time of World War I, still in his early age, he joined the Committee of Iranian Patriots (Komita-ye Melliyun-e Irāni) in Berlin and, in 1915, founded a newspaper (&quot;Rastakhiz&quot;) for this group in Baghdad. In a trip from Baghdad to Istanbul, Jamalzadeh witnessed the Armenian genocide and encountered many corpses during his journey. He wrote of his experiences and eyewitness accounts decades later in two books entitled &quot;Qatl-e Amm-e Armanian&quot; (Armenian massacres) and &quot;Qatl o ḡārat-e Arāmaneh dar Torkiye&quot; (On the massacres of Armenians in Turkey). During this time he also worked for the periodical &quot;Kāveh&quot; (1916). In 1917, he published his first book &quot;Ganj-e Shayegan&quot; (The Worthy Treasure). An overview of Iran of the start of the 20th century, &quot;Ganj-e Shayegan&quot; deals with Iran&#x27;s socio-political and economic problems, a major contribution which bridges the gap between literature and science. In the same year he represented the Nationalists at the World Congress of Socialists in Stockholm. His later years, until 1931 when he settled in Geneva and worked thereafter for the International Labour Organization, were spent in temporary employments, such as one at the Iranian embassy in Berlin.

During all these years, Jamalzadeh had very little contact with Iran but continued to write about the lives of contemporary Iranians. His preoccupation with the use of language and his Dickensian style of writing, including repetitions, piling up of adjectives, and using popular phrases, quickly remind the reader of Jamalzadeh&#x27;s background and of his sincere intentions.

==Literary works==

=== Once Upon a Time &quot;(Yeki Bud Yeki Nabud)&quot; ===
Jamalzadeh&#x27;s major work &quot;Yeki Bud Yeki Nabud&quot; (یکی بود یکی نبود - Once Upon a Time), published in 1921 in Berlin, did not reach Iran until a year later, and when it did, it was not received favourably. The public, especially the clergy, loathed Jamalzadeh&#x27;s portrayal of their country to the degree that copies of the book were burned in public squares. A collection of six short stories, &quot;Yeki Bud Yeki Nabud&quot; deals with the social and political conditions in Iran around the start of the 20th century, a subject that up to then had been outside the purview of writers and poets in general. Moreover, interwoven with this is a considerable amount of militancy against Western interference in Iran and an open mockery of religious fanaticism.
Jamalzadeh&#x27;s simple and colloquial style, combined with a measured humour, enhanced the impact of his writings, making his stories such as &quot;Yeki Bud Yeki Nabud&quot; and &quot;Farsi Shekar Ast&quot; (Persian is Sugar) even more poignant than otherwise would be the case. This hostile public reaction affected Jamalzadeh to the degree that for the next twenty years he refrained from engaging in any literary activities.

==== What&#x27;s Sauce for the Goose... &quot;(Bil-e Dig, Bil-e Choqondar)&quot; ====
One of the most well known short stories from Jamalzadeh&#x27;s &quot;Once Upon A Time&quot; is Bil-e Dig, Bil-e Choqondar (بیله دیگ بیله چغندر) known in English as &quot;What&#x27;s Sauce for the Goose.&quot; This first person narrative follows the story of an Iranian man in Europe who, in his reminiscence of Iranian bathhouses, meets a masseur with whom he engages in deep conversation.

The story begins with the unnamed narrator absorbed in an internal monologue on habits and their tendency to return, even after a person tries to break them. The narrator then, almost as if returning to habit, expresses his sudden urge to attend a hammam (bathhouse) in order to satisfy his previously expressed feelings of nostalgia. Upon arrival to the bathhouse, the narrator was disappointed to find that the Turkish-style bathhouses of Europe were no match for their Iranian counterparts that he knew and loved; however, he was pleasantly surprised to be massaged by an Iranian-trained masseur. By engaging in conversation with the masseur, the narrator underestimates the servant&#x27;s background and realizes some of the flaws of the Iranian society and culture. After learning that masseur was an advisor to several Iranian ministries, the narrator is immediately overcome with skepticism and disbelief. The masseur continued to tell his story of being placed into the role of an advisor, the respect and high position that he gained by chance, and his less-than-positive judgment of Iranians from an outsider&#x27;s perspective. One of the negative aspects he alludes is the dishonesty of Iranians, illustrated in his story of being robbed by thieves and given empty promises. After listening to the masseur, the narrator slyly retorts with a Persian proverb &quot;Bil-e dig, bil-e choqondar.&quot; After unsuccessfully attempting to explain the proverb, the narrator&#x27;s time at the bathhouse is done. Disappointed that their time is up, the masseur hands the man his diary in which he details his encounters in Iran.

Upon his return home, the narrator begins to read the diary. He quickly realizes that the stories in the diary are written by an uneducated man, who views Iran with the prejudice that the whole world should be like Europe. In one observation, the masseur comments on the absence of women from public life. Obviously, women are not actually absent from the society but appear in public fully covered in body-length black veils. Due to not being introduced to the specifics of local culture, the European masseur took them for &quot;strange types of priests&quot;.

The masseur also comments on the social stratification in Iranian society. He writes that the men in Iran are distinguished by the color of their hats and that there are three groups: The Yellow Hats, the White Hats, and the Black Hats. As the narrator keeps reading the descriptions for each group, he learns that they represent the peasants, the clerics, and the government, respectively. The European observer cannot understand why the Yellow Hats, who sacrifice all their belongings to the other two classes hold so much respect for them at the same time. He says: &quot;They are so insistent upon this that often both they themselves and their families starve to death or die from the cold and are buried without so much as a shroud, while the Black Hats and the White Hats have profited so much from the Yellow Hats&#x27; suffering that they have no idea how to spend their money.&quot; Once the narrator read through the whole diary, he mails it back to the masseur with a little note. In it, he includes the translation of the proverb he previously failed to explain.

The European masseur&#x27;s observations come off as naïve and limited due to his ignorance, but they serve as a social satire that Jamalzadeh uses as a literary strategy to exemplify a humorous but eye-opening perspective on Iranian society.

A scholarly analysis that has been done by Clause V. Pederson regards the modernist views that Jamalzadeh&#x27;s shows in his literature. There is no doubt Western influences in modern Persian literature, including Mohammad-Ali Jamalzadeh&#x27;s works, but many of the cultural and political influences in these stories are often overlooked along with its message that reflects on a new worldview. Jamalzadeh&#x27;s literary works express a modernist view of the world where there is no fixed world order and the individual is the center of the universe that has the freedom to use his rational and intellectual capabilities to understand, interpret, and create their own surrounding reality subjectively and relatively. Examples of these ideas are shown in Jamalzadeh&#x27;s short story &quot;Bile dig, Bile Choghondar&quot; (&quot;What&#x27;s Sauce for the Goose&quot;) which demonstrates these views on individuality, rational faculties, interpretation, the relativity of truth, and reality. An example that the author uses to recount this point across is in the Moayyed and Sprachman translation: &quot;Habit truly is like a beggar from Samaria or a pet cat or a Jew owed money or an Isfahani jakesraker: no matter how many times you throw it out one door, it&#x27;ll always return through another&quot;. Here he does not refer to regular ordinary habit but is referring to the habits that blind people and doesn&#x27;t allow people to see the world as it truly is. In the story, the narrator meets a French masseur who has been to Iran with his former master. From the story that the masseur tells about Iran, a ridiculing and exaggerated story, the narrator then realizes that his own understanding of Iran has been clouded by ill memory and habit. He realizes that the European masseur&#x27;s understanding is limited and partly wrong. Although he feels humiliated at the fact that he did not understand his own culture, he realizes that this new knowledge helps him to understand Western culture and also Iranian culture better than the masseur does because the masseur has not allowed himself to see the world as it really is.

He began writing again in the 1940s, but by that time he had lost the dexterity that imparted conciseness, novelty of form, originality of ideas, a biting sense of humor, and a tight structure to his earlier stories. Tautologism, a tendency toward using sage remarks, making mystical and philosophical speculations, and disregard for order became the hallmark of his later writings. &quot;Sahra-ye Mahshar&quot; (Armageddon) (1947), &quot;Talkh-o Shirin&quot; (Bitter and Sweet) (1955), &quot;Kohne va Now&quot; (Old and New) (1959), &quot;Qair az Khoda Hichkas Nabud&quot; (None Existed Except God) (1961), &quot;Asman-o Risman&quot; (The Blue Yonder and Rope) (1965), &quot;Qesse-ha-ye Kutah Bara-ye Bachcheha-ye Rish-dar&quot; (Short Stories for Bearded Children [i.e. for Adults]) (1974), and &quot;Qesse-ye Ma be Akhar Rasid&quot; (Thus Ends Our Story) (1979) were written during this phase of his literary activity. Although Jamalzadeh continued to criticize the court and the clergy, some of his works of this period lack his original unique Persian style, even though he is at times as biting and as veracious as in his earlier writings.

In addition to Persian, Jamalzadeh was fluent in French, German, and Arabic. He translated many books from the latter languages into Persian.

Jamalzadeh was nominated for the 1965, 1967, and 1969 Nobel Prize in Literature by Richard N. Frye, Ehsan Yarshater, and Jes Peter Asmussen respectively. 

==Death==

Jamalzadeh died at the age of 105, in Geneva, Switzerland. His tomb is located in the &quot;Petit-Saconnex&quot; cemetery (block number 22).

==Personal life==
In 1914 Jamalzadeh married his first wife, Josephine, a Swiss woman and a fellow student in Dijon. In 1931 and during his residence in Geneva, Jamalzadeh married his second wife, the German Margaret Eggert.

<doc id="1041515" wikidata="Q153136" url="?curid=1041515" title="Habsburg monarchy">
<text>The Habsburg monarchy, also known as Habsburg Empire, or Habsburg Realm (), was the collection of empires, kingdoms, duchies, counties and other polities that were ruled by the House of Habsburg. From the 18th century it is also referred to as the Austrian monarchy () or the Danubian monarchy.

The history of the Habsburg monarchy can be traced back to the election of Rudolf I as King of Germany in 1273 and his acquisition of the Duchy of Austria for the Habsburgs in 1282. In 1482, Maximilian I acquired the Netherlands through marriage. Both realms passed to his grandson and successor, Charles V, who also inherited the Spanish throne and its colonial possessions, and thus came to rule the Habsburg empire at its greatest territorial extent. The abdication of Charles V in 1556 led to a division within the dynasty between his son Philip II of Spain and his brother Ferdinand I, who had served as his lieutenant and the elected king of Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia. The Spanish branch (which held all of Iberia, the Netherlands, and lands in Italy) became extinct in 1700. The Austrian branch (which ruled the Holy Roman Empire, Hungary, Bohemia and various other lands) was itself split into different branches in 1564 but reunited 101 years later. It became extinct in the male line in 1740, but continued through the female line as the House of Habsburg-Lorraine.

The Habsburg monarchy was a union of crowns, with only partial shared laws and institutions other than the Habsburg court itself; the provinces were divided in three groups: the Archduchy proper, &quot;Inner Austria&quot; that included Styria and Carniola, and &quot;Further Austria&quot; with Tyrol and the Swabian lands. The territorial possessions of the monarchy were thus united only by virtue of a common monarch. The Habsburg realms were unified in 1804 with the formation of the Austrian Empire and later split in two with the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867. The monarchy began to fracture in the face of inevitable defeat during the final years of World War I and ultimately disbanded with the proclamation of the Republic of German-Austria and the First Hungarian Republic in late 1918.

In historiography, the terms &quot;Austria&quot; or &quot;Austrians&quot; are frequently used as shorthand for the Habsburg monarchy since the 18th century. From 1438 to 1806, the rulers of the House of Habsburg almost continuously reigned as Holy Roman Emperors. However, the realms of the Holy Roman Empire were mostly self-governing and are thus not considered to have been part of the Habsburg monarchy. Hence, the Habsburg monarchy (of the Austrian branch) is often called &quot;Austria&quot; by metonymy. Around 1700, the Latin term came into use as a term of convenience. Within the empire alone, the vast possessions included the original Hereditary Lands, the , from before 1526; the Lands of the Bohemian Crown; the formerly Spanish Austrian Netherlands from 1714 until 1794; and some fiefs in Imperial Italy. Outside the empire, they encompassed all the Kingdom of Hungary as well as conquests made at the expense of the Ottoman Empire. The dynastic capital was Vienna, except from 1583 to 1611, when it was in Prague.

==Origins and expansion==
The first Habsburg who can be reliably traced was Radbot of Klettgau, who was born in the late 10th century; the family name originated with Habsburg Castle, in present-day Switzerland, which was built by Radbot. After 1279, the Habsburgs came to rule in the Duchy of Austria, which was part of the elective Kingdom of Germany within the Holy Roman Empire. King Rudolf I of Germany of the Habsburg family assigned the Duchy of Austria to his sons at the Diet of Augsburg (1282), thus establishing the &quot;Austrian hereditary lands&quot;. From that moment, the Habsburg dynasty was also known as the House of Austria. Between 1438 and 1806, with few exceptions, the Habsburg Archduke of Austria was elected as Holy Roman Emperor.

The Habsburgs grew to European prominence as a result of the dynastic policy pursued by Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor. Maximilian married Mary of Burgundy, thus bringing the Burgundian Netherlands into the Habsburg possessions. Their son, Philip the Handsome, married Joanna the Mad of Spain (daughter of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile). Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, the son of Philip and Joanna, inherited the Habsburg Netherlands in 1506, Habsburg Spain and its territories in 1516, and Habsburg Austria in 1519.

At this point, the Habsburg possessions were so vast that Charles V was constantly travelling throughout his dominions and therefore needed deputies and regents, such as Isabella of Portugal in Spain and Margaret of Austria in the Low Countries, to govern his various realms. At the Diet of Worms in 1521, Emperor Charles V came to terms with his younger brother Ferdinand. According to the Habsburg &quot;compact&quot; of Worms (1521), confirmed a year later in Brussels, Ferdinand was made Archduke, as a regent of Charles V in the Austrian hereditary lands.

Following the death of Louis II of Hungary in the Battle of Mohács against the Ottoman Turks, Archduke Ferdinand (who was his brother-in-law by virtue of an adoption treaty signed by Maximilian and Vladislaus II, Louis&#x27;s father at the First Congress of Vienna) was also elected the next king of Bohemia and Hungary in 1526. Bohemia and Hungary became hereditary Habsburg domains only in the 17th century: Following victory in the Battle of White Mountain (1620) over the Bohemian rebels, Ferdinand II promulgated a &quot;Renewed Land Ordinance&quot; (1627/1628) that established hereditary succession over Bohemia. Following the Battle of Mohács (1687), in which Leopold I reconquered almost all of Ottoman Hungary from the Turks, the emperor held a diet in Pressburg to establish hereditary succession in the Hungarian kingdom.
Charles V divided the House in 1556 by ceding Austria along with the Imperial crown to Ferdinand (as decided at the Imperial election, 1531), and the Spanish Empire to his son Philip. The Spanish branch (which also held the Netherlands, the Kingdom of Portugal between 1580 and 1640, and the Mezzogiorno of Italy) became extinct in 1700. The Austrian branch (which also ruled the Holy Roman Empire, Hungary and Bohemia) was itself divided between different branches of the family from 1564 until 1665, but thereafter it remained a single personal union. It became extinct in the male line in 1740, but through the marriage of Queen Maria Theresa with Francis of Lorraine, the dynasty continued as the House of Habsburg-Lorraine.

===Names===
* Habsburg monarchy (German &quot;Habsburgermonarchie&quot;): this is an unofficial umbrella term, very frequently used, but was not an official name.
* Austrian monarchy () came into use around 1700 as a term of convenience for the Habsburg territories.
* &quot;Danubian monarchy&quot; () was an unofficial name often used contemporaneously.
* &quot;Dual monarchy&quot; () referred to the combination of Cisleithania and the Transleithania, two states under one crowned ruler.
* Austrian Empire (): This was the official name of the new Habsburg empire created in 1804, immediately prior to the Holy Roman Empire being dissolved in 1806. In this context, the English word &quot;empire&quot; refers to a territory ruled by an emperor, and not to a &quot;widespreading domain&quot;.
* Austria-Hungary (), 1867–1918: This name was commonly used in international relations, although the official name was &quot;Austro-Hungarian Monarchy&quot; ().
* Crownlands or crown lands (&quot;Kronländer&quot;) (1849–1918): This is the name of all the individual parts of the Austrian Empire (1849–1867), and then of Austria-Hungary from 1867 on. The Kingdom of Hungary (more exactly the Lands of the Hungarian Crown) was not considered a &quot;crownland&quot; anymore after the establishment of Austria-Hungary in 1867, so that the &quot;crownlands&quot; became identical with what was called the Kingdoms and Lands represented in the Imperial Council (&quot;Die im Reichsrate vertretenen Königreiche und Länder&quot;).
* The Hungarian parts of the empire were called &quot;Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen&quot; or &quot;Lands of Holy (St.) Stephen&#x27;s Crown&quot; (&quot;Länder der Heiligen Stephans Krone&quot;). The Bohemian (Czech) Lands were called &quot;Lands of the St. Wenceslaus&#x27; Crown&quot; (&quot;Länder der Wenzels-Krone&quot;).

Names of some smaller territories:
* The Prince-Archbishopric of Salzburg finally became Austrian in 1816 after the Napoleonic wars; before that it was ruled by the prince-archbishops of Salzburg as a sovereign territory.
* The Prince-Bishopric of Trent and Prince-Bishopric of Brixen became Austrian in 1803 following the Treaty of Lunéville.
* Austria, historically, was split into &quot;Austria above the Enns&quot; and &quot;Austria below the Enns&quot; (the Enns river is the state-border between Upper- and Lower Austria). Upper Austria was enlarged after the Treaty of Teschen (1779) following the War of the Bavarian Succession by the so-called Innviertel (&quot;Inn Quarter&quot;), formerly part of Bavaria.
* Hereditary Lands (&quot;Erblande&quot; or &quot;Erbländer&quot;; mostly used &quot;Österreichische Erblande&quot;) or German Hereditary Lands (in the Austrian monarchy) or Austrian Hereditary Lands (Middle Ages – 1849/1918): In a narrower sense these were the &quot;original&quot; Habsburg territories, principally the Archduchy of Austria (&quot;Oesterreich&quot;), Duchy of Styria (&quot;Steiermark&quot;), Duchy of Carinthia (&quot;Kaernten&quot;), Duchy of Carniola (&quot;Krain&quot;), County of Tyrol (&quot;Tirol&quot;) and Vorarlberg. In a wider sense the Lands of the Bohemian Crown were also included (from 1526; definitively from 1620/27) in the Hereditary Lands. The term was replaced by the term &quot;Crownlands&quot; (see above) in the 1849 March Constitution, but it was also used afterwards.The &quot;Erblande&quot; also included many small territories that were principalities, duchies or counties in other parts of the Holy Roman Empire, such as Further Austria.

==Territories of the Habsburg Monarchy==

The territories ruled by the Austrian monarchy changed over the centuries, but the core always consisted of four blocs:
* The Hereditary Lands, which covered most of the modern states of Austria and Slovenia, as well as territories in northeastern Italy and (before 1797) southwestern Germany. To these were added in 1779 the Inn Quarter of Bavaria and in 1803 the Prince-Bishoprics of Trent and Brixen. The Napoleonic Wars caused disruptions where many parts of the Hereditary lands were lost, but all these, along with the former Prince-Archbishopric of Salzburg, which had previously been temporarily annexed between 1805 and 1809, were recovered at the Congress of Vienna 1815, with the exception of Further Austria. The Hereditary provinces included:
** Archduchy of Austria
*** Upper Austria
*** Lower Austria
** Inner Austria
*** Duchy of Styria
*** Duchy of Carinthia
*** Duchy of Carniola
*** The Imperial Free City of Trieste
*** Margraviate of Istria (although much of Istria was Venetian territory until 1797)
*** Princely County of Gorizia and Gradisca
** County of Tyrol (although the Bishoprics of Trent and Brixen dominated what would become the South Tyrol before 1803
** Duchy of Salzburg
** Further Austria, mostly ruled jointly with Tyrol.
*** Vorarlberg (actually a collection of provinces, only united in the 19th century)
*** The Vorlande, a group of territories in Breisgau and elsewhere in southwestern Germany lost in 1801 (although the Alsatian territories (Sundgau) which had formed a part of it had been lost as early as 1648)
** Grand Duchy of Salzburg (only after 1805)
* The Lands of the Bohemian Crown. The Bohemian Diet elected Ferdinand, later Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I, as king in 1526. Initially consisting of the five lands:
** Kingdom of Bohemia
** Margraviate of Moravia
** Silesia, Most of Silesia was conquered by Prussia in 1740–1742 and the remnants which stayed under Habsburg sovereignty were ruled as Duchy of Upper and Lower Silesia (Austrian Silesia).
** Lusatia, was ceded to Saxony in 1635.
*** Upper Lusatia
*** Lower Lusatia
* The Kingdom of Hungary – two-thirds of the former territory that was administered by the medieval Kingdom of Hungary was conquered by the Ottoman Empire and the Princes of vassal Ottoman Transylvania, while the Habsburg administration was restricted to the western and northern territories of the former kingdom, which remained to be officially referred as the Kingdom of Hungary. In 1699, at the end of the Ottoman–Habsburg wars, one part of the territories that were administered by the former medieval Kingdom of Hungary came under Habsburg administration, with some other areas being acquired in 1718 (some of the territories that were part of medieval kingdom, notably those in the south of the Sava and Danube rivers, remained under Ottoman administration).
* Kingdom of Croatia
* Military Frontier


Over the course of its history, other lands were, at times, under Austrian Habsburg rule (some of these territories were secundogenitures, i.e. ruled by other lines of Habsburg dynasty):
* Serbia occupation (1686–1691)
* Kingdom of Slavonia (1699–1868)
* Duchy of Milan (1706–1797)
* Duchy of Mantua (1706–1797)
* Kingdom of Naples (1707–1735)
* Kingdom of Sardinia (1707–1720)
* State of the Presidi (1707–1733)
* Austrian Netherlands, consisting of most of modern Belgium and Luxembourg (1713–1795)
* Grand Principality of Transylvania, between 1699 (Treaty of Karlowitz) and 1867 (Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867)
* Kingdom of Serbia (1718–1739)
* Banat of Temeswar (1718–1778)
* Banat of Craiova (1718–1739 &quot;de facto&quot;, 1716–1737)
* Kingdom of Sicily (1720–1735)
* Duchy of Parma and Piacenza (1735–1748)
* Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, in modern Poland and Ukraine (1772–1918)
* Duchy of Bukovina (1774–1918)
* Serbia occupation (1788–1791)
* West Galicia, the Polish lands, including Kraków, taken in the Third Partition (1795–1809)
* Venetia (1797–1805)
* Kingdom of Dalmatia (1797–1805, 1814–1918)
* Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia (1814–1866)
* Grand Duchy of Kraków, which was incorporated into Galicia (1846–1918)
* Serbian Vojvodina (1848–1849) de facto entity, officially unrecognized
* Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar (1849–1860)
* Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia (1868–1918)
* Sanjak of Novi Pazar occupation (1878–1908)
* Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina (1878–1918)

The boundaries of some of these territories varied over the period indicated, and others were ruled by a subordinate (secundogeniture) Habsburg line. The Habsburgs also held the title of Holy Roman Emperor between 1438 and 1740, and again from 1745 to 1806.

===Characteristics===

Within the early modern Habsburg monarchy, each entity was governed according to its own particular customs. Until the mid 17th century, not all of the provinces were even necessarily ruled by the same person—junior members of the family often ruled portions of the Hereditary Lands as private apanages. Serious attempts at centralization began under Maria Theresa and especially her son Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor in the mid to late 18th century, but many of these were abandoned following large scale resistance to Joseph&#x27;s more radical reform attempts, although a more cautious policy of centralization continued during the revolutionary period and the Metternichian period that followed.

Another attempt at centralization began in 1849 following the suppression of the various revolutions of 1848. For the first time, ministers tried to transform the monarchy into a centralized bureaucratic state ruled from Vienna. The Kingdom of Hungary was placed under martial law, being divided into a series of military districts, and the Diet of Hungary was forced to dissolve after the revolution was suppressed by Austrian troops under the command of Julius Jacob von Haynau. Following the Habsburg defeats in the Second Italian War of Independence (1859) and Austro-Prussian War (1866), these policies were gradually abandoned.

After experimentation in the early 1860s, the famous Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 was arrived at, by which the so-called dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary was set up. In this system, the Kingdom of Hungary (&quot;Lands of the Holy Hungarian Crown of St. Stephen.&quot;) was an equal sovereign with only a personal union and a joint foreign and military policy connecting it to the other Habsburg lands. Although the non-Hungarian Habsburg lands were referred to as &quot;Austria&quot;, received their own central parliament (the &quot;Reichsrat&quot;, or Imperial Council) and ministries, as their official name – the &quot;Kingdoms and Lands Represented in the Imperial Council&quot;. When Bosnia and Herzegovina was annexed (after 30 years of occupation and administration), it was not incorporated into either half of the monarchy. Instead, it was governed by the joint Ministry of Finance.

During the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, the Austrian territories collapsed under the weight of the various ethnic independence movements that came to the fore with its defeat in World War I. After its dissolution, the new republics of Austria (the German-Austrian territories of the Hereditary lands) and the First Hungarian Republic were created. In the peace settlement that followed, significant territories were ceded to Romania and Italy and the remainder of the monarchy&#x27;s territory was shared out among the new states of Poland, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia), and Czechoslovakia.

==Other lines==
A junior line ruled over the Grand Duchy of Tuscany between 1765 and 1801, and again from 1814 to 1859. While exiled from Tuscany, this line ruled at Salzburg from 1803 to 1805, and in Grand Duchy of Würzburg from 1805 to 1814. The House of Austria-Este ruled the Duchy of Modena from 1814 to 1859, while Empress Marie Louise, Napoleon&#x27;s second wife and the daughter of Austrian Emperor Francis I, ruled over the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza between 1814 and 1847. Also, the Second Mexican Empire, from 1863 to 1867, was headed by Maximilian I of Mexico, the brother of Emperor Franz Josef of Austria.

<text>Peter Pin-Shan Chen (; born 3 January 1947) is a Taiwanese-American computer scientist and applied mathematician. He is a retired distinguished career scientist and faculty member at Carnegie Mellon University and Distinguished Chair Professor Emeritus at Louisiana State University. He is known for the development of the entity–relationship model in 1976.

== Biography ==
Born in Taichung, Taiwan, Chen received a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in electrical engineering in 1968 from National Taiwan University and earned a Ph.D. in computer science and applied mathematics at Harvard University in 1973. In 1970, he worked one summer at IBM. After graduating from Harvard, he spent one year at Honeywell and a summer at Digital Equipment Corporation.

From 1974 to 1978 Chen was an assistant professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management. From 1978 to 1983 he was an associate professor at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA Management School). From 1983 to 2011 Chen held the position of M. J. Foster Distinguished Chair Professor of Computer Science at Louisiana State University and, for several years, adjunct professor in its Business School and Medical School (Shreveport). During this period, he was a visiting professor once at Harvard in &#x27;89-&#x27;90 and three times at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (EECS Dept. in &#x27;86-&#x27;87, Sloan School in &#x27;90-&#x27;91, and Division of Engineering Systems in 06-&#x27;07). From 2010 to 2020, Chen was a Distinguished Career Scientist and faculty member at Carnegie Mellon University, U.S.A.

Besides lecturing around the world, he has also served as an (honorary) professor outside of the U.S. In 1984, under the sponsorship of the United Nations, he taught a one-month short course on databases at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, and was awarded as Honorary Professor there. Then, he went to Beijing as a member of the IEEE delegation of the First International Conference on Computers and Applications (the first major IEEE computer conference held in China). From 2008 to 2014, he was an Honorary Chair Professor at the Institute of Service Science at National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan. Starting in 2016, he is an Honorary Chair Professor in the Department of Bioengineering and Bioinformatics, Asia University (Taiwan).

Chen has served as an advisor for government agencies and corporations. He is a member of the advisory board of the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate of National Science Foundation (2004-2006) and the United States Air Force Scientific Advisory Board (2005-2009).

== Awards and honors ==
Chen&#x27;s original paper is one of the most influential papers in the computer software field based on a survey of more than 1,000 computer science professors documented in a book on &quot;Great Papers in Computer Science&quot;. Chen&#x27;s work is also cited in the book &quot;Software Challenges&quot; published by Time-Life Books in 1993 in the series on &quot;Understanding Computers.&quot; Chen is recognized as one of the pioneers in a book on &quot;Software Pioneers&quot;. He is listed in Who&#x27;s Who in America and Who&#x27;s Who in the World.

Chen has received many awards in the fields of Information Technology. He received the Data Resource Management Technology Award from the Data Administration Management Association (DAMA International) in New York City in 1990. He was elected as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), IEEE, and ER.&lt;ref name=&quot;ER/Conceptual Modeling Main Website&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He won the Achievement Award in Information Management in 2000 from DAMA International. He was an inductee into the Data Management Hall of Fame in 2000. He received the Stevens Award in Software Method Innovation in 2001. In 2003, Chen received the IEEE Harry H. Goode Memorial Award at the IEEE-CS Board of Governors meeting in San Diego. He was presented with the ACM - AAAI Allen Newell Award at the ACM Banquet in San Diego in June 2003 and International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) in Acapulco in August 2003. Chen is also the recipient of the Pan Wen-Yuan Outstanding Research Award in 2004. In June 2011 in Jeju Island, Korea, Chen received the Transformative Achievement Medal from the Software Engineering Society and the Society for Design and Process Science. In 2021, he received the Leadership Award from the IEEE Technical Committee of Service Computing (TCSVC). 
His innovative work initiated/accelerated a new field of research and practice called &quot;Conceptual Modeling&quot; based on conceptual model (computer science) or Entity–Relationship model. In 1979, he founded an annual international professional meeting, the International Conference on Conceptual Modeling, which has been held in different countries. He also founded the Data &amp; Knowledge Engineering journal for publishing and disseminating scholarly research results.

== Work ==

=== Entity–relationship modeling and conceptual data modeling===
The entity–relationship model serves as the foundation of many systems analysis and design methodologies, computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools, and repository systems. The ER model is the basis for IBM&#x27;s Repository Manager/MVS and DEC&#x27;s CDD/Plus.

Chen&#x27;s original paper is commonly cited as the definitive reference for entity relationship modeling though the concept of object relationship had been developed a year earlier by Schmid and Swenson as reported in the 1975 ACM SIGMOD Proceedings . Chen is one of the pioneers of using entity–relationship concepts in software and information system modeling and design. Before Chen&#x27;s paper, the basic entity–relationship ideas were used mostly informally by practitioners. Chen first published an abstract and presented his ER model in the First Very Large Database Conference in September 1975, the same year of a paper with similar concepts written by A. P. G. Brown. Chen&#x27;s main contributions are formalizing the concepts, developing a theory with a set of data definition and manipulation operations, and specifying the translation rules from the ER model to several major types of databases (including the Relational Database). He also popularized the model and introduced it to the academic literature.

The ER model was adopted as the meta-model ANSI Standard in Information Resource Directory System (IRDS), and the ER approach has been ranked at the top methodology for database design and one of the top methodologies in systems development by several surveys of Fortune 500 companies.

=== Computer-aided software engineering ===
Chen&#x27;s work is a cornerstone of software engineering, in particular computer-aided software engineering (CASE). In the late 1980s and early 1990s, IBM&#x27;s Application Development Cycle (AD/Cycle) framework and DB2 repository (RM/MVS) were based on the ER model. Other vendors’ repository systems such as Digital&#x27;s CDD+ were also based on the ER model. Chen has had a significant impact on the CASE industry through his research and his lecturing around the world on structured system development methodologies. The ER model has influenced most of the major CASE tools, including Computer Associates’ ERWIN, Oracle Corporation’s Designer/2000, and Sybase’s PowerDesigner (and even a general drawing tool like Microsoft Visio), as well as the IDEF1X standard. The ER model is also the basis for Microsoft&#x27;s ADO.NET Entity Framework.

The hypertext concept, which makes the World Wide Web extremely popular, is very similar to the main concept in the ER model. Chen investigated this linkage as an invited expert of several XML working groups of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

The ER model also serves as the foundation of some of the recent work on Object-oriented analysis and design methodologies and Semantic Web. The UML modeling language has its roots in the ER model.

=== Computer performance modeling ===
In his early career, he was active in R&amp;D activities in computer system performance. He was the program chair of an ACM SIGMETRICS conference. He developed a computer performance model for a major computer vendor. His innovative research results were adopted in commercial computer performance tuning and capacity

=== Memory and storage hierarchy, storage technology, CD-ROM, firmware, and micro-programming ===
His Ph.D. thesis at Harvard was one of the first studies of cost-performance optimization models of multi-level memory/storage hierarchies. He was also one of the early micro-programmers developing the firmware for a file control unit for an IBM mainframe computer. His article on &quot;CD-ROM&quot; in IEEE Proceedings journal in the 1980s was one of the first articles explaining how CD-ROM worked when CD-ROMs became popular. He was a co-author of the storage technology article in early versions of a computer encyclopedia book published by McGraw-Hill.

=== Cyber security and terrorist detection ===
In recent years, he led a multidisciplinary research team in developing new efficient and effective techniques in identifying terrorists and malicious cyber transactions. At CMU, he is active in the R&amp;D activities of CERT Coordination Center and Software Engineering Institute (SEI).

=== Big data, web services, blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) ===
He is active in research and lecturing on Big Data and emerging technologies. He was a keynote speaker and a keynote panelist on Big Data at IEEE Conferences. He was the 2014 program chair, the 2015–16 conference chair, and the 2017 honorary chair of the IEEE BigData Congresses. He was the chair of the 2018 IEEE ICWS Conference and the chair of the Blockchain Panel. He was the general chair of the 2019 IEEE Service Congress, Milan, Italy. He received the 2002 ACM - AAAI Allen Newell Award, one of the top awards jointly sponsored by a computer and an AI professional societies.

<text>Faustino Hernán Asprilla Hinestroza (born 10 November 1969) is a Colombian former professional footballer who played as forward or winger, most notably for Parma, Newcastle United and the Colombia national team.

==Club career==
===Early years===
After starting out playing football with local team Carlos Sarmiento Lora School, Asprilla started his professional career in 1988 for the Colombian team Cúcuta Deportivo at the age of 18 for a year before transferring to Atlético Nacional. He scored 35 goals in 78 games, which brought him to the attention of several Italian clubs. Parma won the race to sign him for US$10.9 million in 1992.

===Parma===
In his first season at Parma, Asprilla scored some important goals, including a 27-yard second-half free-kick which helped Parma defeat Milan 1–0, ending the Italian champions&#x27; unbeaten streak at 58 matches. It was at Parma Asprilla arguably enjoyed his greatest club success. Asprilla was part of the Parma squad which won its first international tournament, the 1992–93 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, scoring four goals in eight matches. It was his brace in Spain that rallied the Italian team to a 2–1 victory over Atlético Madrid in the semi-final. However, an injury meant he was an unused substitute as Parma defeated Belgian club Royal Antwerp 3–1 in the final.

In early 1994, Asprilla was part of the Parma side that defeated Milan 2–0 at the San Siro to overturn a 1–0 first-leg deficit and claim the 1993 European Super Cup.

Also in the 1993–94 season, Parma reached a second Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final. However, a 0–1 defeat to Arsenal meant they would not retain their trophy.

In 1994–95, Parma again reached the final of a major European competition as they faced Italian compatriots Juventus in the final of the UEFA Cup. Asprilla was instrumental in Parma&#x27;s run to the final, with three goals over two legs in the semi-final against Bayer Leverkusen. In the final itself, Asprilla was in the starting XI for both legs as Parma defeated Juventus 2–1 on aggregate.

At the start of the 1995–96 season, Asprilla found himself out of head coach Nevio Scala&#x27;s plans. In February 1996, after making only six appearances in the opening five months of the season, Asprilla joined English Premier League leaders Newcastle United for a £6.7 million transfer fee.

During his first spell at Parma, Asprilla scored 25 goals in 84 Serie A appearances. He is considered one of the greatest players of Parma&#x27;s successful period in the 1990s. In his three full seasons with the club, Parma finished third, fifth and third in Serie A. The club also reached a European final in each of those seasons, as well as the 1994–95 Coppa Italia final. He also won the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1992–93, as well as a runners-up medal in 1993–94 edition of the tournament, the European Super Cup in 1993, and the UEFA Cup in 1994–95 and 1998–99. In 1993, he was also ranked by FIFA as the sixth-best player in the world in the FIFA World Player of the Year award.

===Newcastle United===
Parma sold Asprilla to English Premier League side Newcastle United for £6.7 million in February 1996, with &quot;Tino&quot;, as the fans nicknamed him, appearing at St James&#x27; Park to finalise the move during a snowstorm, dressed in a woolen coat.

At the time, Newcastle were ahead of Manchester United in the Premier League, although their lead at the top of the table was narrowing. Asprilla&#x27;s arrival on Tyneside came just months after earlier media reports of a move to England, with Leeds United being linked with his signature.

Asprilla made his league debut in Newcastle&#x27;s 2–1 win over Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium on 10 February 1996, coming on as a second-half substitute with the score 1–0 in Middlesbrough&#x27;s favour. He made an immediate impact, creating the assist for Newcastle&#x27;s equaliser. However, his time on Tyneside was blighted by inconsistency and off-field incidents, and Asprilla was blamed as one of the reasons Newcastle would go on to concede the 1995–96 Premier League title to eventual winners Manchester United.

Asprilla&#x27;s second season for Newcastle ended with the club finishing in second place once again, behind Manchester United. His role was largely reduced to substitute appearances, although he retained his best performances for the club&#x27;s UEFA Cup campaign, scoring five goals. His celebration of the goal he scored against Metz, whereby he removed his shirt and swung it from a corner flag, resulted in Asprilla being given a yellow card, meaning a suspension from Newcastle&#x27;s next UEFA Cup match against Monaco.

The 1997–98 season was Asprilla&#x27;s last for Newcastle. With the sale of striker Les Ferdinand to Tottenham Hotspur and a serious injury to Alan Shearer during the pre-season, Asprilla was preferred as first-choice striker alongside the young, inexperienced Jon Dahl Tomasson. Newcastle&#x27;s second-place league finish the season before meant they qualified for the 1997–98 UEFA Champions League; Asprilla started the first game against Barcelona and scored a hat-trick in a 3–2 win. These would turn out to be his last goals for the club. By the end of January 1998, with Newcastle struggling in the league and eliminated from the Champions League, Asprilla&#x27;s time at Newcastle came to an end. He was sold back to Parma for £6 million, having scored a total of nine goals in 48 Premier League appearances and nine goals in 11 European matches.

===Return to Parma===
In his second spell at Parma, Asprilla won his second UEFA Cup, coming on as a substitute as Parma defeated Marseille in the final.

===Palmeiras===
Asprilla played in the successful Palmeiras team in the 1999 and 2000 seasons. He won both the Rio-São Paulo Tournament and the Brazilian Champions Cup in 2000.

===Later career and Darlington link===
Although his brief time with Palmeiras saw the team achieve success, for Asprilla personally his time there marked the beginning of a pattern of short, relatively unproductive stays with various clubs across various countries, including Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Argentina.

During a time which was generally low-key, he appeared in the public eye again in 2002 amid reports he had been approached by English Division Three side Darlington. Darlington successfully appealed an initial work permit refusal and had offered around £17,000 per week plus 20% of gate receipts, a car and a rent-free flat. Chairman George Reynolds considered they were friends and in fact paraded Asprilla in front of 5,163 fans before Darlington&#x27;s 2–0 win over Carlisle United on 27 August, believing the intended two-year contract was good as signed. However, it was reported that after Asprilla stalled on taking a medical on 29 August, in the early hours of 30 August he caught a flight from Newcastle Airport to the Middle East, apparently to accept a more lucrative contract offer (the identity of the club was not revealed). Reynolds described himself as &quot;absolutely gutted&quot; by the snub, complaining Asprilla &quot;did not even have the decency to say goodbye&quot; and said he would never talk to him again. This was the second time Darlington was snubbed by a high-profile ex-Newcastle player that summer, the first being Paul Gascoigne.

===Retirement===
In July 2009, Asprilla officially retired from top flight football following a retirement match in Medellín, Colombia. Although this marks his official retirement date, he had not been actively employed by a professional side in around five years.

==International career==
===Summary===
Asprilla scored 20 goals in 57 matches for Colombia from 1993 to 2001 and played for his country at the 1994 and 1998 FIFA World Cups. Asprilla was expected to be one of the top players of the 1994 tournament, but failed to score a single goal as Colombia was eliminated in the first round.

===1992 Summer Olympics===
Asprilla was a member of the Colombian team at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona where the team was eliminated in the first round following losses to Spain (4–0) and Egypt (3–4) and a draw with Qatar (1–1).

===1993 Copa America===
In the 1993 Copa América, held in Ecuador, Colombia finished third overall. After topping Group C with a 2–1 win over Mexico and draws with Bolivia (1–1) and Argentina (1–1), Colombia defeated Uruguay 1–1 (5–3 on penalties) before losing 0–0 (6–5 on penalties) to Argentina in the semi-final, the eventual tournament winners. In the match for third place, Colombia defeated hosts Ecuador 1–0 to claim third place. Asprilla did not score in the tournament.

===1994 FIFA World Cup===
Asprilla was part of the Colombian team which demolished Argentina 5–0 in a World Cup Qualifier match in Buenos Aires in 1993, where Asprilla scored twice. Colombia finished undefeated in the South American qualifying group. Entering the 1994 World Cup, there were high expectations for Colombia as a dark horse favourite to win the tournament with a squad that included such notable players as Carlos Valderrama, Freddy Rincón and Asprilla. However, with one win and two losses, Colombia finished at the bottom of their group and was eliminated after the first round. Asprilla himself had a disappointing tournament, failing to score, and left the tournament before the group stage had concluded.

===1995 Copa América===
In the 1995 Copa América, held and won by Uruguay, Colombia again finished third. Colombia started out by finishing third in Group B with a 1–1 draw with Peru (Asprilla scored the goal), a 1–0 win over Ecuador and a 0–3 loss to Brazil. The nation then went on to defeat Paraguay 5–4 on penalties after a 1–1 draw in the quarter-finals before losing to Uruguay 2–0 in the semi-final. In the third place match, Colombia faced the United States, which Colombia easily defeated 4–1 with Asprilla scoring one of the Colombians&#x27; four goals in the match.

===1998 FIFA World Cup===
In the 1998 FIFA World Cup, held in France, expectations were again high for Colombia and Asprilla remained in the team. However, again Colombia was eliminated in the first round following one win and two losses. Asprilla was dismissed from the team after complaining to reporters about the head coach&#x27;s decision to substitute him near the end of Colombia&#x27;s opening loss against Romania.

In 2001, at age 32, Asprilla retired from international football.

==Personal life==
In 2008, he was arrested for allegedly firing a machine gun at security forces near his farm in Colombia. He was placed under house arrest on charges of weapons possession and criminal damage. He has appeared in various Colombian Reality Shows, such as &quot;Desafio&quot; 2005 and &quot;Nomadas&quot;.

He made a return to St James&#x27; Park on 22 January 2011 appearing on the pitch at half time during Newcastle United&#x27;s Premier League home match against Tottenham Hotspur and attended a charity dinner in Gateshead that evening, alongside Les Ferdinand and Peter Beardsley, where he spoke of his affection for the Newcastle fans.

In early 2013, Asprilla was linked with a return to his former club Newcastle. Asprilla spoke of performing a coaching role with the youth squad as well as developing a special role in introducing young talent into the academy from his homeland Colombia. His intention is to give Colombians a chance to showcase their skills in European/English football, based on the sheer amount of talent that has come from Colombia in recent years.

Asprilla played in former &quot;Magpies&quot; goalkeeper Steve Harper&#x27;s testimonial match on 11 September 2013 against A.C. Milan Glorie. He had a header disallowed for offside before the Italians won 2–1 on penalties.

In September 2014, it was revealed Asprilla was preparing to launch a range of flavoured condoms in Colombia. In 2020, he sold the products at a special promotional price in order to ease the strains of the COVID-19 pandemic in his home country.

Asprilla revealed in 2019 that a hitman wanted to murder Paraguay goalkeeper José Luis Chilavert after both players were sent off in Colombia&#x27;s 2–1 defeat during a 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifier in 1997.

==Style of play==
Regarded as one of the greatest Colombian players of all time, Asprilla was capable of playing as a forward, as a striker, as a centre-forward, as a second striker, or even as a creative, playmaking attacking midfielder in the number ten role. Though never a prolific goalscorer, he was a quick, agile and skilful player known for his flair, creativity, technique, power, acceleration, and pace, as well as his eye for goal and ability to create chances and score spectacular goals with either foot; moreover, he was an accurate free kick taker.

Former playing colleague, Robbie Elliott described Asprilla&#x27;s playing style: &quot;There were reasons behind everyone Kevin [Keegan] signed. With Tino it was that unpredictability, he just unlocked teams. His nickname was the octopus because his legs were everywhere and you literally had no idea what he was going to do.&quot;

Despite his talent and unpredictability, he was known for being inconsistent, as well as temperamental and controversial, both on and off the field. He was also known for his somersault then double-fist-pump goal celebration. Due to his long limbs, he was given the nickname &quot;il polipo&quot; (&quot;the octopus&quot;, in Italian), during his time in Serie A, as well as &quot;cobra&quot;, due to his playing ability.

<text>Vindö is a large, fairly densely populated island in Stockholm County, Svealand, Sweden, in the Stockholm archipelago, between Värmdö and Kanholmsfjärden. The island is cut into by several deep bays, and linked by isthmus to Djurö to the south and Skarpö to the east. Between Vindö-Djurö and Värmdölandet goes a fairway by Vindöström and Simpströmmen.

On the north Vindö are lake Vämlingen joined by the Baltic Sea by Oscar Canal, named after King Oscar II. The king liked to fish for perch in the lake at the time, the Royal Swedish Yacht Club (KSSS) operated in Sollenkroka Fladen (before they moved to Santahamina).

Carl Anton sings about Vindö in &quot;Överbyvals,&quot; where the island&#x27;s beauty during summer is praised.

<text>Arthur Russell (13 March 1886 – 23 August 1972) was a British athlete. He was the winner of the 3,200-meter steeplechase at the 1908 Summer Olympics for Great Britain.

== Biography ==
Russell, from Staffordshire, won his first AAA title while only 17 years old. He became British national champion after winning the AAA Championships steeplechase event for three successive years from 1904 to 1906.

At the London Olympics, Russell competed in the 3,200 metres steeplechase. In the first round, he was one of only two athletes in his heat to finish, easily defeating the other runner. Russell made the pace in the final for the first mile. Afterward, Russell and American John Eisele fought for the lead until the bell, when Briton Archie Robertson passed Eisele and was only beaten by two yards by Russell, with Eisele behind.

Russell was a Walsall brick worker who ran for Walsall Harriers. His gold medal is extremely rare as it is made of solid gold, and this was the only time that the 3200-yard event was held.

<doc id="1041534" wikidata="Q353061" url="?curid=1041534" title="Kabinett">
<text>Kabinett (literal meaning: cabinet), or sometimes Kabinettwein (literal meaning: a wine set aside in a cabinet), is a German language wine term for a wine which is made from fully ripened grapes of the main harvest, typically picked in September, and are usually made in a light style. In the German wine classification system, Kabinett is the lowest level of &quot;Prädikatswein&quot;, lower in ripeness than Spätlese.

In Austria, Kabinett is subcategory of &quot;Qualitätswein&quot; rather than a &quot;Prädikatswein&quot;, and the term always designates a dry wine.

In the Czech Republic, Kabinet is a category of &quot;Quality Wine with Predicate&quot; (Czech: &quot;Jakostní víno s přívlastkem&quot;). Wines of this style are usually light and dry.

== History ==
The term Kabinett, also known as &quot;Cabinet&quot;, originally implied a wine of superior quality, set aside for later sale. It is essentially the German version of the wine term Reserve. The term originated with the cistercian monks at Eberbach Abbey in Rheingau, where the first recorded use of the term Cabinet occurred in 1712. The abbey&#x27;s best wines were set aside to be stored in a special cellar built in 1245, and it was later known as the Cabinet cellar, or &quot;Cabinet-Keller&quot;. However it is also recorded that the first official Cabinet Cellar was built in 1716 in Schloss Vollrads, a winery in the nearby town, Oestrich-Winkel and there was no evidence shown that Eberbach Abbey ordered its own Cabinet Cellar until 1739. 

Before 1971, the term Cabinet or &quot;Kabinett&quot; often followed the name of the grape varietal, for example, a wine might be a &quot;Trockenbeerenauslese Cabinet&quot;. The term is superfluous under current German wine law, although it can still be found on older bottles.

In 1971, the term Kabinett was officially noted in German wine law, and it was given its current definition which applies to wines which are light and non-chaptalized. Kabinett&#x27;s current definition differs greatly from its etymological implications of it being a reserve wine. Before 1971, the terms Naturwein (natural wine) or &quot;Natuerrein&quot; (naturally pure) were used in place of Kabinett. These terms designated non-chaptalized wine, where no other designations, such as Spätlese or Auslese, applied.

== Requirements ==

===German definition===

The minimum requirements, under current wine law, for a wine to be labelled Kabinett are as follows:

* The wine must have a must density of between 67 and 82 degrees Oechsle, depending on the region (wine growing zone) and grape variety.
* The wine must not undergo chaptalisation.

===Austrian definition===

The minimum requirements, under current wine law, for a wine to be labelled Kabinett are as follows:

* The wine must have a minimum must density of 17 degrees KMW (equal to 85 °Oechsle).
* The alcohol content may not exceed 13% ABV.
* The residual sugar content may not exceed 9 grams per liter.
* The wine must not undergo chaptalisation - a notable exception from the rules which apply to other &quot;Qualitätsweine&quot;.

===Czech definition===

The minimum requirements, under current Czech wine law, for a wine to be labeled Kabinet are as follows:

* The wine must be produced from grapes grown within a single defined wine sub-region.
* The wine must have a minimum must density of 19 °NM (equal to 84 °Oechsle).
* The wine must not undergo chaptalisation.

== Style ==

Since Kabinett wines may not be chaptalized, in contrast with other Qualitätswein (QbA), they tend to possess the lowest alcohol content of all German wines, despite the fact the requirements are more stringent than other QbA.

Kabinett wines are often noted for having a pronounced light and elegant character when from the colder German wine regions, such as Mosel, and in wines made from the grape variety Riesling (which dominates much of the coldest German regions).

Typically, a Riesling Kabinett from Mosel exhibits a high acidity, with floral aromas, and often hints of slate and minerality. In cooler regions, semi-sweet Kabinett wines have an alcohol content of around 7-8% ABV and dry Kabinett wines are usually around 10-11% ABV. When made in other regions, or from other grape varieties, this can vary. For example, a dry Kabinett made in Baden or the Palatinate made from a Pinot varietal may well have an alcohol content of 13% ABV.

Typical German Kabinett wines are usually best enjoyed when aged for between one and five years. However, some better examples can be cellared for over a decade.

<doc id="1041535" wikidata="Q5118367" url="?curid=1041535" title="Chute, Wiltshire">
<text>Chute is a civil parish in east Wiltshire, England, on the border with Hampshire. It includes the main village of Upper Chute and the smaller settlements of Lower Chute, Chute Standen, Chute Cadley and Mount Cowdown. The settlements are sometimes known collectively as &quot;The Chutes&quot;. The nearest town is Andover, Hampshire, about to the southeast.

Conholt House and Conholt Park are in the northeast of the parish.

==Etymology==
&quot;Chute&quot; takes its name from Chute Forest. This name is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, in the Latin phrase &quot;silva que vocatur Cetum&quot; (&quot;the wood that is called &quot;Cetum&quot;&quot;); the name is first attested as the name of a settlement in 1235, as &quot;Cett’&quot;. The name derives from the Common Brittonic word that survives today in modern Welsh as (&quot;woodland&quot;). Spellings with an &quot;e&quot;, along the lines of &quot;Cet&quot;, &quot;Cette&quot;, &quot;Chet&quot; and &quot;Chette&quot; dominate the record through the thirteenth century and reflect the usual borrowing of this Brittonic word into Old English. The spelling &quot;Chute&quot;, first attested for the village in 1268 (as &quot;Chuth’&quot;) and for the forest in 1283 (as &quot;Chute&quot;), reflects dialectal variation in Old English, specifically the West-Saxon sound-change known as palatal diphthongisation.

== Early history ==
Evidence of Neolithic occupation includes an oval barrow at Scotspoor, in the northeast corner of the parish. The northern boundary of the parish follows a prehistoric ditch and there is a prehistoric field system on Chute Down in the southwest. Bevisbury, a small Iron Age fort, is just over the Hampshire border near Chute Cadley.

The Domesday book of 1086 recorded farmland and a mill at Standen. In the 13th century the whole area was part of Chute Forest.

==Local government==
Chute is a civil parish with an elected parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority. Both councils are responsible for different aspects of local government.

The nearby village of Chute Forest has its own parish council.

==Upper Chute==
The Church of England parish church of Saint Nicholas is mentioned in 1320 and in Dean Chandler&#x27;s register of 1405. It was almost completely rebuilt in the period 1869–72 to designs by J.L. Pearson. The old church consisted of a chancel and nave with south transept, south porch, and west timber bell turret. The walls were faced with knapped flint and supported by prominent red-brick buttresses, and the 15th-century windows were replaced by new ones in 13th-century style. A vestry was built on the north side of the chancel, and the porch and the bell turret were replaced by a new south porch below a tower and a slated spire.

The church is now part of the Savernake Team ministry and also serves Chute Forest parish, following the closure of the Victorian St Mary&#x27;s Church in 1970. Six bells were transferred from the redundant church to St Nicholas&#x27; in 1976.

The Cross Keys Inn was built at the turn of the 19th century, and remained open as a public house until 2004, when its owners sought planning permission to turn it into residential property. A &#x27;Save Our Pub&#x27; campaign was mounted by locals with the support of the Campaign for Real Ale, and in March 2006 the inn reopened under new ownership.

==Chute Standen==
A school was built on the road to Upper Chute in 1858, and was attended by pupils from the parishes of Chute and Chute Forest. The architect was William White and construction was in flint with red brick dressings. The school was closed in 1978 and the building became the village hall.

==Chute Causeway==
The Chute Causeway is a section of the Roman Road that runs from Winchester northwest to Mildenhall (near Marlborough) and onwards to Cirencester. At Conholt the road deviates west to avoid the deep Hippenscombe valley, resuming its straight course near Tidcombe. The length of the deviation is about and the Causeway forms the southern .

===Local folklore and legend===
During the reign of Charles II the bubonic plague struck the parishes of Chute and Vernham Dean. At Vernham Dean a rector persuaded his parishioners to isolate themselves at the top of the hill along which Chute Causeway runs. When the time came for him to supply the food and care he had promised, the fear he had of the disease meant he failed to uphold his honour and left the villagers to die. Another story has him falling ill himself before he could do the job. He himself did not survive, even after the betrayal of his parishioners, as the plague also killed him. Since then his ghost has been seen to wander up the hill towards the campsite on the Causeway, never completing the journey he did not have the courage to finish. As he has not been seen for a long time, he may have found peace at last.

<text>Stanisław Wawrzyniec Staszic (baptised 6 November 1755 – 20 January 1826) was a leading figure in the Polish Enlightenment: a Catholic priest, philosopher, geologist, writer, poet, translator and statesman. A physiocrat, monist, pan-Slavist (after 1815) and laissez-fairist, he supported many reforms in Poland. He is particularly remembered for his political writings during the &quot;Great (Four-Year) Sejm&quot; (1788–92) and for his large support towards the Constitution of 3 May 1791, adopted by that Sejm.

He co-founded the Warsaw Society of Friends of Learning (precursor to the Polish Academy of Sciences), of which he became president. He served as a member of the State Council of the Duchy of Warsaw and as minister of trade and industry in Congress Poland. Staszic is seen as the father of Polish geology, statistics, sociology, Tatra Mountains studies and exploration, mining and industry.

== Life ==

=== Early life ===

Stanisław Staszic was born into a burgher family in the town of Piła (he was baptised on 6 November 1755), the youngest of four siblings. His father, Wawrzyniec Staszic, was mayor of Piła and a royal secretary. His brothers were Antoni (1743–1775) and Andrzej (1745–1825), a priest.

Staszic attended secondary school at Wałcz. He studied theology and graduated from a Jesuit school at Poznań in 1778 and was ordained a Catholic priest (he took lesser Holy orders in 1774, and higher orders about 1778–79). Between 1779 and 1781 he continued his studies in France at the Collège de France, where he took classes in physics and natural history.

On returning to Poland in 1781, he accepted a position as tutor in the house of Grand Crown Chancellor Andrzej Zamoyski. In 1782 he received a doctorate from the Zamojski Academy. He translated several works from French into Polish and briefly worked at the academy as a teacher of French language.

=== Reformer ===
His &quot;Remarks upon the Life of Jan Zamoyski&quot; (&quot;Uwagi nad życiem Jana Zamoyskiego&quot;, 1787), published anonymously on the eve of the Great Sejm, transformed the little-known tutor into one of the chief political thinkers of the late 18th-century Commonwealth. It became a model for other similar works and began a flood of political books and pamphlets unprecedented in the Commonwealth&#x27;s history. It was reprinted numerous times, including in unauthorized editions.

Within his &quot;Remarks&quot;, Staszic did not portray the life of Jan Zamoyski (1542–1605, one of the most prominent statesmen in Polish history); rather, he argued that reforms are needed, and that Zamoyski had already proposed or supported many of them two centuries before. Staszic was a strong partisan of reforms and an ardent advocate for the interests of the lower classes. He advocated the abolition of the serfdom and improvements of the peasants&#x27; fate (by granting them land and private rights). He criticised the szlachta (Polish nobility) for inefficient governance, and argued that it showed itself too inept to be allowed to govern alone. He argued for a slight increase in taxes, which should allow the Commonwealth to create an army of 100,000 that would at least stand a chance against the still-larger armies of its neighbours. Although he preferred republicanism in theory, in the Commonwealth context he agreed that a strengthening of the central (royal) power was the most practical solution for reforming the country, in line with the similar developments elsewhere in Europe. In &quot;Remarks&quot; he even supported the introduction of an absolute monarchy in Poland.

Staszic was a keen observer of the proceedings of the Great Sejm, spending much time in Warsaw since the Sejm began its deliberations in 1788. He continued publishing new books and pamphlets. His &quot;Warnings for Poland, coming from the current European politics and natural laws, by the writer of the remarks upon the life of Jan Zamoyski&quot; (&quot;Przestrogi dla Polski z teraźniejszych politycznych Europy związków i z praw natury wypadające przez pisarza uwag nad życiem Jana Zamoyskiego&quot;, 1790), together with his previous &quot;Remarks&quot;, are considered among the most influential works of the Polish Enlightenment. In &quot;Warnings&quot;, he criticised the magnates of Poland and Lithuania, monastic orders and serfdom, and supported the enfranchisement of the townsfolk. Although he was not a participant of the Sejm, he was an influential onlooker, and through his widely read and discussed writings of the time is recognized as one of the founding fathers of the Constitution of 3 May 1791.

During 1790–1791 he accompanied Zamoyski&#x27;s family on a trip abroad, and continued to serve as an adviser to the family, although his relations with the sons (Aleksander August Zamoyski, Stanisław Kostka Zamoyski) had become strained; he would eventually align himself with the daughter of the family, Anna Zamoyska (Anna Jadwiga Sapieżyna). He supported the 1794 Kościuszko Uprising, a failed attempt to liberate Commonwealth from foreign influence following the events of the 1793 Second Partition of Poland, donating money to the insurgents&#x27; cause. Upon the defeat of the Uprising, he accompanied the family on their trip to Vienna. He also made some successful financial investments, including in the stock market. He then served as an economic adviser for the Zamoyski and the Sapieha families, invested in their estates, and lent them money.

=== Late life ===

After Poland&#x27;s partitions, in which Russia, Prussia, and Austria seized all of the Commonwealth&#x27;s territory, Staszic was active in many scientific and scholarly initiatives. He studied the geology of the Carpathian Mountains. In 1800 he co-founded the Warsaw Society of Friends of Learning; from 1802 he was one of its most active members. In 1804 he went to France, where he observed the changes wrought by Napoleon. On return to Poland in 1805, he spent some time in the Tatra Mountains, where he continued his geological studies and conducted ethnographic ones. He worked with Jan Chrystian Hoffmann on a geological map of Poland. In the Duchy of Warsaw he worked with the Ministry of Education (&quot;Izba Edukacyjna Księstwa Warszawskiego&quot;) and was involved in numerous educational reforms and initiatives. He also briefly worked with the Ministry of Treasury.

From 1808 he was president of the Society of Friends of Learning (&quot;Towarzystwo Przyjaciół Nauk&quot;, or &quot;TPN&quot;), forerunner to the Polish Academy of Sciences (&quot;Polska Akademia Nauk&quot;); he would be elected repeatedly as the society&#x27;s president until his death. In 1808 he also became referendary to the State Council (&quot;Rada Stanu&quot;) of the Duchy; in 1810 he became a full member. In the council, he was active in regard to questions of education and the economy. As &quot;TPN&quot; president he was active in many initiatives which supported and popularized science in Poland. He oversaw the construction of a headquarters for the &quot;TPN&quot;, which came to be known as the &quot;Staszic Palace&quot;.

From 1814 he supported the Russian Empire, seen as a Pan-Slavist ally of Poland, and favored the idea of a great Slavic monarchy. After the fall of the Duchy of Warsaw in 1815, he became a member of the government of the newly created small state of Congress Poland (in personal union with Russia), initially in the new Ministry of Education and Religion, in 1816 serving as deputy minister. In 1815 he was decorated with the Order of Saint Stanislaus. In 1819 he endorsed a controversial censorship law, damaging his reputation.

His 1815 Polish translation of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; met with a negative reception. In 1816–20 he published many of his writings in a 9-volume &quot;Works&quot; (&quot;Dzieła&quot;). Volumes 7–9 comprised his &quot;Humankind: A Didactic Poem&quot; (&quot;Ród Ludzki. Poema Dydaktyczne&quot;), a gigantic philosophical essay and poem that is regarded as an important contribution to the history of Polish philosophy. However, the work ran afoul of the new censorship law and was not distributed, much of the edition eventually being destroyed.

He also carried out studies on education and on human behavior, in a social-science tradition. Some of his views and theories made him a precursor of evolutionism in the natural and social sciences. In his essays on human nature, he declared for the primacy of science and was relatively critical of the influence of religion. These views gained him some critics, as he was seen as a priest who had abandoned religion.

From 1816 he was involved in mining research and projects. He also actively supported industrial development in Poland. He was one of the first to see the importance of coal, and supported the development of metallurgy-related projects, from mines to zinc and steel mills. He was also involved in the development of ceramic and textile industries, and improving the transport infrastructure (roads, canals). He discovered coal deposits in Dąbrowa Górnicza, where he initiated the building of a coal mine. Between 1816 and 1824 he was the &quot;de facto&quot; minister of industry of the Congress Poland (styled officially the &quot;director of the Department of Trade, Crafts and Industry&quot;) and initiated construction of the Old Polish Industrial Area (&quot;Staropolski Okręg Przemysłowy&quot;). As his projects did not result in quick returns, he incurred increasing criticism, and eventually resigned from his position in 1824.

In 1816 he founded the &quot;Hrubieszowskie Towarzystwo Rolnicze&quot; (Hrubieszów Agricultural Society), seen by some as the first Polish cooperative.

He died in Warsaw on 20 January 1826, most likely due to a stroke. His funeral gathered 20,000 people, including the viceroy of the Congress Poland, Józef Zajączek. He was buried in the Camaldolese Hermit Monastery in Warsaw. His testament left his property at Hrubieszów to its tenants, and much of his wealth went to various philanthropic initiatives.

== Private life ==

Staszic was remembered by his contemporaries as a loner and not a person who was quick to make friends. He has been described as somewhat miserly; despite acquiring significant wealth, he was said to wear old clothes and use an old carriage. He was nonetheless widely respected by his contemporaries. He was seen as stern but honest, and had a tendency to speak in a fashion that some found amusing.

== Remembrance ==

He is seen as one of the chief representatives of the political activists and writers of the Polish Enlightenment. He is also seen as the father of Polish geology, statistics, sociology, Tatra Mountains studies and exploration, mining and industry. He is one of the figures immortalised in Jan Matejko&#x27;s 1891 painting &quot;Constitution of 3 May 1791&quot;. He was also the protagonist of the Charles Dickens&#x27; novella &quot;Judge Not&quot; (1851), and of Hanna Muszyńska-Hoffmanowa&#x27;s novel &quot;Pucharek ze srebra&quot; (&quot;Little chalice of silver&quot;). Wacław Berent published a biography of Staszic, but it is now lost. In 1926, on the 100th anniversary of his death, he was celebrated in the Second Polish Republic with several studies, articles and publications.

In April 1951, he was honoured on a postage stamp of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland as part of the set issued for the First Congress of Polish Science. His figure was popular among the Marxist scholars of the People&#x27;s Republic, who stressed his materialist, determinist and anti-clerical views. The 150th anniversary of his death in 1976 was also celebrated, with many works dedicated to him, including poems by Jan Czeczot and Jan Lohmann. He has been made a patron of over 200 schools, including the AGH University of Science and Technology in Kraków. There are statues of Stanisław Staszic in Łódź, Kielce, Hrubieszów and Dąbrowa Górnicza. Several geographical landmarks, minerals and a bacterium bear his name as well. In Piła, there is a Museum of Stanisław Staszic, which has gathered various artifacts related to him, and publishes a journal, &quot;Zeszyty Staszicowskie&quot; (&quot;Staszic Notebooks&quot;).

<text>Charlton St Peter or just Charlton is a small village and civil parish in the Vale of Pewsey in the English county of Wiltshire. The village lies about south-west of Pewsey. In 2011 the parish had a population of 86.

The village is in the north of the parish, between the River Avon and the Devizes-Upavon road, the A342. To the south the parish extends onto Salisbury Plain.

== Parish church ==
The Church of England parish church of St Peter was largely rebuilt by J.L. Pearson in 1858. Fragments of a 12-century building survive, and the tower is from the 15th or 16th centuries. The north chantry chapel, c. 1523, is in memory of William and Marion Chaucey. In 1964 the church was designated as Grade II* listed.

The first record of a vicar at Charlton is from 1306, and by that time the church had been appropriated by the nearby Upavon Priory; in 1423 Upavon and Charlton were granted to the Augustinian canons of Ivychurch Priory, south-east of Salisbury, who held them until the Dissolution. Today the parish is served by the Vale of Pewsey team ministry.

==Local government==

Charlton shares a parish council, named Charlton St Peter and Wilsford, with the adjacent parish of Wilsford. Charlton elects five councillors to sit alongside two from Wilsford. The parish is in the area of Wiltshire Council, a unitary authority which is responsible for most local government functions.

On 1 July 2022 the parish was renamed from &quot;Charlton&quot; to &quot;Charlton St Peter&quot;.

==Traditions==

The village inn is the &quot;Charlton Cat&quot;, &quot;a solitary little inn at the foot of the downs&quot;. This establishment was originally called the Red Lion, later the Poores Arms after Edward Poore, lord of the nearby manor of Rushall in the eighteenth century, but the villagers had long known it as &quot;The Cat&quot;, from the ill-painted lion of the original sign. This name was formally adopted in 1921.

Charlton and the neighbouring village of Rushall hold an annual village cricket match each year in June. It used to be played in each village alternately, but in recent years since the Village Lunch has been established in Rushall Village Hall, the match has been played in a field behind the Old Barns. In the last few years a tug-of-war competition has been started, only seriously between the men for the trophy, but there are a women&#x27;s and children&#x27;s tug-of-war as well.

==Notable people==
Stephen Duck, 18th-century poet, was born here and the grave of his wife Mary is in the churchyard. The &quot;Duck Feast&quot;, held annually at the Charlton Cat in the first week of June, commemorates his life and work. The cost is met from the rent of &quot;Duck&#x27;s Acre&quot;, a field in Rushall donated for the purpose by Lord Palmerston.

<text>The July Ordinances, also known as the Four Ordinances of Saint-Cloud, were a series of decrees set forth by Charles X and Jules Armand de Polignac, the chief minister, in July 1830.

Compelled by what he felt to be a growing, manipulative radicalism in the elected government, Charles felt that as king by right of birth, his primary duty was the guarantee of order and happiness in France and its people.

The result was that on 9 July 1830, Charles announced that in his interpretation of, and in full compliance with, Article 14 of the Charter of 1814, he would henceforth govern by . On 25 July, while a guest at Saint-Cloud, he signed the so-called &quot;July Ordinances&quot; which were published in the Parisian newspaper the following day.

The ordinances of 26 July:

* Suspended the liberty of the press
* Appointed new, reactionary Councillors of State
* Dissolved the newly elected Chamber of Deputies of France
* Reduced the number of deputies in future Chambers
* Summoned new electoral colleges for September of that year
* Withdrew the Deputies&#x27; right of amendment
* Excluded the commercial middle-class from future elections

They were intended to restore the previous political order. However, the ordinances had the opposite effect of angering the French citizens. Journalists gathered to protest at the headquarters of the &quot;National&quot; daily, founded in January 1830 by Adolphe Thiers, Armand Carrel, and others. The final result was the July Revolution and Charles X&#x27;s abdication and exile.

<doc id="1041543" wikidata="Q1323220" url="?curid=1041543" title="Alf Prøysen">
<text>Alf Prøysen () (23 July 1914 – 23 November 1970) was a Norwegian author, poet, playwright, songwriter and musician.
Prøysen was one of the most important Norwegian cultural personalities in the second half of the 20th century. He worked in several different media including books, newspapers and records. He also made significant contributions to music as well as to television and radio. He also wrote in the &quot;Arbeiderbladet&quot; from 1954 until his death.

He was also noted for his series of books featuring &quot;Mrs. Pepperpot&quot; (Norwegian: &quot;Teskjekjerringa&quot;). The fictional character of a series of children&#x27;s books established him as a children&#x27;s author. The series of books were first published during 1956 and was first published in English in 1959.

==Background==
He was born Alf Olafsen at Rudshøgda in Ringsaker in Hedmark county, Norway. He grew up at the Croft farm Prøysen, which was named after the Kingdom of Prussia. He was the son of Olaf Andreassen (1880–1959) and Julie Mathiasdatter (1879–1961). He was raised as the youngest of four children born to a rural farm family.

==Career==
Prøysen became an apprentice at the Norwegian School of Applied Sciences, where he was a copywriter and actor in the annual student reviews from 1942 to 1945. He became associated with NRK, making his recording debut in 1947. Prøysen soon became a national celebrity. Through songs such as &quot;Husmannspolka&quot;, &quot;Tango for to&quot;, &quot;Lillebrors vise&quot;, &quot;Du ska få en dag i mårå&quot;, &quot;Julekveldsvis&quot;, &quot;Jørgen Hattemaker&quot;, &quot;Musevisa&quot; and &quot;Romjulsdrøm&quot; he became extremely popular through the 1950s and 1960s. Prøysen contributed to many artistic fields: children&#x27;s radio, short stories, theater and music. Most of his stories and songs took place in an environment similar to the rural village where he grew up.

In 1945 he debuted with &quot;Dørstokken heme&quot;, a collection of short stories. His only novel &quot;Trost i taklampa&quot; (1950) was a success both as a book and as a play. He was frequently featured on radio and television programs during the 1950s and 1960s. Prøysen was awarded the Norwegian Cultural Council Honorary Prize (&quot;Norsk kulturråds ærespris&quot;) in 1970.

A large part of Prøysen&#x27;s writing consisted of short stories. Much of his production was made for children. The first stories about &quot;Teskjekjerringa&quot; were published in the magazine &quot;Kooperatøren&quot;. In 1956 the first book of a series about &quot;Teskedsgumman&quot; was published. From 1967, Swedish television featured a popular series. In the 1980s, a Japanese cartoon series for 130 episodes was made. Teskjekjerringa was published in the Penguin Books classic series becoming an international success.

Several biographies have been written about Alf Prøysen including a book by his daughter Elin Prøysen as well as works by Helge Hagen and Dag Solberg. A book by Ove Røsbak appeared during 1992. Røsbak also wrote an article in &quot;Dagbladet&quot; stating that several of his sources confirmed that Prøysen had discussed his bisexuality during the 1960s.
In &quot;Samtiden&quot;; nr 2, 2007 &quot; Dagbladet&quot; also had an interview with gay activist Karen-Christine Friele in which she confirmed that Prøysen had told her about his love of men and his divided life. &quot;Dagbladet&quot; editor Knut Olav Åmås commented later that the resulting debate revealed mixed feelings towards gay/bisexuality.

==Prøysenhuset==
Prøysenhuset is a cultural center and museum located at Rudshøgda in Ringsaker. The center has an auditorium, gift shop, café and play ground. The main part of the museum is a permanent exhibition that tells of the life and career of Alf Prøysen. It was designed by the architectural and engineering firm Snøhetta. The center was established as a gift to Ringsaker municipali on the 100th anniversary of his birth in July 2014.
It was financed by businessman and investor Arthur Buchardt. Local companies also gathered to fund the center. It now operates as a department under the Cultural Office of the municipality of Ringsaker.

<doc id="1041545" wikidata="Q245355" url="?curid=1041545" title="Zygmunt Krasiński">
<text>Count Napoleon Stanisław Adam Feliks Zygmunt Krasiński (; 19 February 1812 – 23 February 1859) was a Polish poet traditionally ranked after Adam Mickiewicz and Juliusz Słowacki as one of Poland&#x27;s Three Bards – the Romantic poets who influenced national consciousness in the period of Partitions of Poland.

Krasiński was the most famous member of the noble Krasiński family. He was born in Paris to Count Wincenty Krasiński and Princess Maria Urszula Radziwiłł, a member of the aristocratic Radziwiłł family, and became the close companion of his father after his mother&#x27;s early death from tuberculosis. He was educated by tutors prior to attending the Warsaw Lyceum, where he graduated in 1827. He then started to study law and administration at the Royal University of Warsaw, but was expelled from the university in 1829.

In 1829 Krasiński left Poland to study in Geneva. He met Mickiewicz, who dazzled the young writer and played an important part in shaping his literary techniques. In Rome, Krasiński received news about the November Uprising and broke off his trip with the intention of returning to Poland to fight, but in the end, did not participate. In 1833 he travelled from Saint Petersburg to Italy, where he would stay until April 1834. This period saw the creation of probably his most famous work, the tragic drama &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Undivine Comedy&quot;). By 1850 his health had worsened, but that did not stop his constant travels around Europe. Through letters and audiences with European figures, including Napoleon III of France, he sought to gain support for the Polish cause. To avoid political repercussions, he published his works anonymously, which led to him being known as the Anonymous Poet of Poland.

Krasiński&#x27;s early works were influenced by Walter Scott and Lord Byron and extolled medieval chivalry. In 1845 he published &#x27; (&quot;Psalms of the Future&quot;). He is best known for &quot;The Undivine Comedy&quot; as well as for the large body of well-received letters. His writings explore [[conservatism]], Christianity, the necessity of sacrifice and suffering to moral progress, and [[providentialism]]. &quot;The Undivine Comedy&quot; and another major work, &quot;[[Irydion]]&quot; (1834), explore the concept of [[Class conflict|class struggle]], contemplating [[social revolution]], and predicting the destruction of the [[nobility]]. His later writings showed his opposition to romantic militant ventures. He wrote letters, poetry, and &quot;treatises in the philosophy of history&quot;, such as &quot;Psalms of the Future&quot; and&#x27; (&quot;Predawn&quot;). &quot;The Undivine Comedy&quot; is perhaps the most important Polish drama of the Romantic period.

== Life ==
===Childhood===
Napoleon Stanisław Adam Feliks Zygmunt Krasiński was born in Paris on 19 February 1812 to Count Wincenty Krasiński, a Polish aristocrat and military commander, and Countess Maria Urszula Radziwiłł, a member of the House of Radziwill, a Polish-Lithuanian noble family. He spent his first years in Chantilly, where Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s Imperial Guard Regiment was stationed, and the Emperor attended his baptism. In 1814 his parents moved to Warsaw, then part of the Duchy of Warsaw, ruled by Frederick Augustus I of Saxony, as a client state of the First French Empire. Krasiński&#x27;s cultivated and doting father employed prominent tutors, including Baroness Helena de la Haye, , and , to educate Zygmunt.

Following the stabilization brought by the end of the Napoleonic Wars, which saw the end of the Duchy of Warsaw and the creation of Congress Poland, the Krasiński family spent most summer holidays on their estates in Podole and Opinogóra. On 12 April 1822 Zygmunt&#x27;s mother died of tuberculosis, and the 10-year-old boy became a precocious close companion to the family head, who instilled in Zygmunt a reverence for chivalry and honor. Zygmunt&#x27;s fascination with his father&#x27;s personality, and their mutual hopes for a free Poland, led to an excessive, onerous mutual idealization. Over the years, their &quot;intimate and difficult&quot; relationship would be very influential on Zygmunt, whom Victor Erlich described as &quot;weak and hypersensitive&quot;, compared to his &quot;affectionate but domineering&quot; father.

In September 1826 Zygmunt entered the Warsaw Lyceum (a secondary school which Chopin had attended in 1823–1826), graduating in autumn 1827. He began studies in law and administration at the Imperial University of Warsaw. On 9 March 1829 an incident occurred, stemming from Krasiński&#x27;s attendance at classes instead of at a patriotic demonstration during the funeral of Marshal . Krasiński had boycotted the funeral at the urging of his father, who the previous year had clashed politically with Bieliński, who was widely seen as a national hero. Krasiński was one of only two students to remain in class. On 14 March 1829 he was publicly criticized by a fellow student, ; this led to an altercation serious enough to involve the university administration and to eventuate in Krasiński&#x27;s expulsion.

From late May to mid-June 1829 Krasiński, accompanying his father, took his first journey abroad, visiting Vienna, capital of the Austrian Empire. In October 1829 he left Poland again, this time to study abroad. Travelling through Prague, Plzeň, Regensburg, Zürich, and Bern, 17-year-old Krasiński arrived on 3 November 1829 in Geneva.

===Literary travels===
Much of Krasiński&#x27;s time in Geneva was divided between attendance at university lectures, being tutored, and his social life. He soon became fluent in French.
His Geneva stay helped shape his personality. Soon after arrival in Geneva, at the beginning of November 1829, Krasiński met Henry Reeve, a physician&#x27;s son who was in Switzerland to study philosophy and literature. The talented young Englishman, who composed overwrought romantic poetry, greatly inspired young Krasiński. They became fast friends and exchanged letters discussing their love of classical and romantic literature.

At the beginning of 1830, Krasiński developed romantic feelings for Henrietta Willan, the daughter of a wealthy English merchant and tradesman. This relationship inspired future works by Krasiński. On 11 August 1830 Krasiński met Adam Mickiewicz, a principal figure in Polish Romanticism, and Poland&#x27;s greatest poet. Krasiński&#x27;s wide-ranging conversations with Mickiewicz, who dazzled Krasiński with the breadth of his knowledge, were vital in inspiring Krasiński&#x27;s to improve his literary techniques. From 14 August to 1 September 1830 they traveled together to the High Alps; Krasiński described this in his diary; being a prolific writer of letters, he wrote about this trip as well in a letter to his father, which was dated 5 September 1830.
Around early November 1830 Krasiński left Geneva and traveled to Italy, visiting Milan, Florence, and Rome. In Rome, receiving news about the outbreak of the November Uprising in Poland, he broke off his trip and returned to Geneva. He had been finishing a historical novel, &quot;&quot;, recounting the story of Tsaritsa and warlord Marina Mniszech, considered his most significant work of that period. On the advice of his father, who opposed rebellion against the Russian Empire (he had become a Russian general), he did not go to Poland to participate in the Uprising – to his later everlasting regret. In May 1832 he set out for Poland, on the way again visiting Italy (Milan, Verona, Vicenza, Padua, Venice), then Innsbruck and Vienna, finally by mid-August 1832 arriving in Warsaw. During that trip, in Venice, he consulted with ophthalmologist Friedrich Jäger regarding his surfacing eye disease, which would continue over the years to come, becoming one of the reasons for his growing introspection.

Having reunited with his father shortly afterward, they traveled together to Saint Petersburg, where in October he received an audience with the Russian Tsar Nicholas I. The elder Krasiński tried to arrange a diplomatic career for his son with the Russian Empire, but Zygmunt was not interested and was content to travel abroad again. In March 1833 he left Saint Petersburg and, visiting Warsaw and Kraków, traveled once more to Italy, where he would stay until 19 April 1834. This period saw the creation of what is likely his most famous work, the drama &quot;The Undivine Comedy&quot; (&quot;Nie-Boska komedia&quot;), written probably between summer and fall 1834. 

In Rome, Krasiński fell in love with . Though the relationship lasted for a few years, it did not result in marriage (in any case, Bobrowa was already married). With her and her husband Teodor, in the spring of 1834, Krasiński took another trip to Italy. That summer he met his father in Kissingen, then traveled to Wiesbaden and Ems. Autumn saw him visit Frankfurt and Milan, and by November he returned to Rome. In spring the following year he visited Naples, Pompeii, Sorrento, then Florence. In this period he finished another major work, the drama &quot;Irydion&quot;, which he had begun earlier, around 1832 or 1833.
Departing Florence in June 1835, he met Bobrowa in Kissingen, then traveled with her to Ischl and Trieste, and then on alone to Vienna, which he reached in January 1836. Then he went to Milan and Florence, and again to Rome. In Rome, in May that year, he would meet and befriend another major Polish literary figure, Juliusz Słowacki. In summer 1836 he returned to Kissingen and visited Gräfenberg, where he once more met his father. In November he returned to Vienna, where he stayed until June 1837. That summer he visited Kissingen and Frankfurt am Main, then returned by September to Vienna.

Worsening health prevented him from resuming his travels until May 1838, when he traveled to Olomouc and Salzbrunn, then returned to Poland, in June visiting family estates in Opinogóra Górna. Shortly after, he traveled to Warsaw and then Gdańsk. September marked the end of his romance (which his father had opposed) with Joanna Bobrowa. On 1 September 1838, together with his father, he again departed for Italy (Venice, Florence, Rome, and Naples). In Rome he once again met Juliusz Słowacki.

===Later life===
For over a decade, Krasiński&#x27;s muse was Countess Delfina Potocka (likewise a friend of composer Frédéric Chopin), with whom he conducted a romance from 1838 to 1848. In the first half of 1839 he traveled to Sicily, meeting Potocka in Switzerland, and his father in Dresden. He spent much of that time traveling with Potocka and writing poems and other works dedicated to her. In July 1840 his father informed the 28-year-old of plans that he had made for Zygmunt to marry Countess Eliza Branicka (1820–1876). The marriage eventuated on 26 July 1843 in Dresden. The couple would have four children: sons Władysław and Zygmunt, and daughters Maria Beatrix and Elżbieta.

As usual, much of Krasiński&#x27;s time was divided between traveling and writing. The year 1843 also saw the publication of his poem &#x27; (Predawn). In 1845 he published another major work, &#x27; (Psalms of the Future). Tirelessly continuing his travels through Central Europe, in January 1848, in Rome, he met another Polish literary figure, the struggling poet Cyprian Norwid (sometimes considered a fourth Polish bard), whom he would aid financially. He also met Mickiewicz again and endorsed Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski&#x27;s political faction. A conservative, Krasiński was critical of the revolutionary upheavals known as the Spring of Nations.

In 1850 his health worsened, but that did not stop his constant travels, including to France. Through letters and audiences with European figures, including Napoleon III, whom he met in 1857 and 1858, he sought to gain support for the Polish cause. In 1856, in Paris, he took part in the funeral of Adam Mickiewicz. On 24 November 1857, in a major blow to Krasiński, his father died.

Krasiński died in Paris on 23 February 1859. His body, like his father&#x27;s, was transported to Poland and laid to rest in the family crypt at Opinogóra. Today the former family estate of the Krasiński family is the home of a .

=== Themes ===
Key themes in his writings include conservatism, Messianist Christianity, the necessity of sacrifice and suffering to moral progress, and providentialism. His relation to his father, who strongly influenced – indeed, controlled – many aspects of his life, is also seen as a major influence in his writings.

Some of Krasiński&#x27;s work contains antisemitic motifs. Political scientist Stephen Bronner argues that the &quot;Comedy&quot; is probably &quot;the first work in which a Jewish conspiracy against a Christian society figured as the prominent theme&quot;. According to theatre critic Agata Adamiecka-Sitek, this aspect of the piece is still a sensitive topic in Poland, as the piece is &quot;both canonical and profoundly embarrassing for Polish culture, on par perhaps with &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; in the western theatre canon&quot;.He differed from his major peers, Mickiewicz and Słowacki, in his vision of the future. Accepting the likelihood of democratic social revolution, he was much less sanguine about it than they; and so were his works, when they touched on the future. All Three Bards agreed the future would see major, likely violent changes. For Krasiński, the future held little hope for a better, new world, though his later works suggested the possibility of salvation – and of restoration of Polish independence – through a return to conservative Christian values.

=== Works ===
Krasiński&#x27;s early works, particularly his historical novels, such as &quot;Agaj-Han&quot;, were influenced by Walter Scott and Lord Byron and extolled medieval chivalry. They are also deeply pessimistic. This gloomy atmosphere is visible in Krasiński&#x27;s best-known work, the drama &quot;Nie-boska komedia&quot; (&quot;The Undivine Comedy&quot;), which he wrote around 1835, when he was in his early twenties.
In the 19th century, a greater Polish Romantic poet, Adam Mickiewicz, discussed &quot;The Undivine Comedy&quot; in his Collège de France lectures, calling it &quot;the highest achievement of the Slavic theater&quot;. A century later, another Polish poet and lecturer on the history of Polish literature, Nobel laureate Czesław Miłosz, called &quot;The Undivine Comedy&quot; &quot;truly pioneering&quot; and &quot;undoubtedly a masterpiece not only of Polish but... of world literature&quot;, and remarked how surprising it was that such a brilliant drama could have been created by an author barely out of his teens. The American academic Harold B. Segel noted that the play &quot;has steadily gained prestige in the twentieth century and is widely regarded in Poland as one of the greatest dramatic works to emerge from the Romantic period&quot;, and that it had been staged outside Poland and was likely the most internationally known Polish romantic drama.

The &quot;Undivine Comedy&quot; discussed the concept of class struggle before Karl Marx had coined the phrase. &quot;The Undivine Comedy&quot; appears to have been inspired by the author&#x27;s reflections on the Polish November 1830 Uprising and on the French July 1830 Revolution. It contemplated social revolution, predicted the destruction of the nobility, and commented on societal changes wrought by western Europe&#x27;s burgeoning capitalism. The play was critical both of the aristocracy and of the revolutionaries, the former depicted as cowardly, and the latter, as destructive; neither morally superior. Also addressed were such themes as the poet&#x27;s identity, the nature of poetry, and Romantic myths of perfect love, fame, and happiness.In another prose drama, &quot;Irydion&quot;, Krasiński again took up the theme of societal decay. He condemned the excesses of revolutionary movements, arguing that motives such as retribution had no place in the Christian ethic; many contemporaries, however, saw the play as an endorsement of militant struggle for Poland&#x27;s independence, while Krasiński&#x27;s intent was to advocate for organic work as a means to society&#x27;s advancement. His later writings more clearly showed his opposition to romantic militant ventures and his advocacy of peaceful, organic educational work; this was particularly so in his &quot;Psalms of the Future&quot;, which expressly criticized the concept of revolution. Krasiński began writing &quot;Irydion&quot; before &quot;The Undivine Comedy&quot;, but published it after the latter. Miłosz commented that, while &quot;Irydion&quot; is a work of considerable talent, especially in its insightful analysis of the decadence of Roman Empire, it is not on a par with &quot;The Undivine Comedy&quot;; and Segel wrote that &quot;Irydion&quot; &quot;attracts no great attention today&quot;.

Krasiński&#x27;s later work includes a body of poetry, but his lyrical poetry is not particularly notable; indeed, he himself remarked that he was not a particularly gifted poet. More memorable are his &quot;treatises in the philosophy of history&quot;, especially &quot;Predawn&quot; and &quot;Psalms of the Future&quot;, influenced by philosophers including Georg Hegel, Friedrich Schelling, August Cieszkowski, and Bronisław Trentowski. Krasiński&#x27;s rejection of Romantic ideals and democratic slogans which he felt inspired futile bloody rebellions, brought a polemical reply from fellow poet Juliusz Słowacki in the form of the poem, &quot;&quot; (&quot;A reply to &quot;Psalms of the Future&quot;&quot;).

Lastly, he was a prolific writer of well-received letters, some of which survived and were published posthumously. Polish literature scholars Maria Janion and Kazimierz Wyka wrote that the body of his letters is, next to his dramas, his other major literary achievement; similar praise was offered by literature critic who argued that those letters are one of the crowning achievements of Polish Romanticism. Theater critic Jan Kott referred to the series of letters written by Krasiński to Potocka as &quot;the greatest (yet unwritten) novel of the Polish Romantic period&quot;.

Most, if not all, of his works, were published anonymously or under pseudonyms, to protect his family – particularly his father, a politician and administrator in Russian-controlled Congress Poland – from retribution by the Russian Empire, as his works were often outspoken and contained thinly veiled references to the political situation of contemporary Europe (in particular, of the partitions of Poland). Due to his decision to publish anonymously, to the end of his life he was able to travel freely between his family manor in Russian-controlled lands and centers of Polish emigré life in Western Europe (the Great Emigration), while others, including Mickiewicz and Słowacki, were forced to remain in exile in the West, banned from returning to Polish lands by the occupying powers. This led to his being known as the Anonymous Poet of Poland (the title of English writer Monica Mary Gardner&#x27;s 1919 monograph, &quot;The Anonymous Poet of Poland: Zygmunt Krasinski&quot;).

== Critical assessment ==

Polish literary scholar writes, in the &quot;Polish Biographical Dictionary&quot;, that Krasiński has traditionally been ranked with Mickiewicz and Słowacki as one of Poland&#x27;s Three National Bards. Of the three, however, Krasiński is considered the least influential. Miłosz wrote that Krasiński, popular in the mid-19th century, remains an important figure in the history of Polish literature but is not on a par with Mickiewicz and Słowacki. 

Modern scholars generally agree that while Krasiński was in his time admired for his poetry, it did not age well. Polish historian of literature, , observes the contradiction regarding Krasiński&#x27;s dramas and poems, the former which gained popularity with the critics, but not the public, while for the later, a reverse was true. He subsequently notes that over time, assessment of his dramas (and letters) overshadowed that of his poetry, which proved to be much less enduring. Segel likewise agreed that both Krasiński&#x27;s poetry, as early as during the turn-of-the-century Young Poland period, came to be criticized as &quot;vehicles for [an] embarrassing messianism&quot; and as &quot;amateur and shallow Romantic philosophizing&quot;. Krasiński&#x27;s popularity further waned under the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland, when his conservative religious themes met with disapproval by the communist authorities; new editions of his works were not published in the 1940s and 1950s. 

Today most of Krasiński&#x27;s Romantic tales and poetry are still considered relatively weak. On the other hand, he has come to be recognized as &quot;a superb prose stylist and easily the outstanding epistolary artist of Polish romanticism&quot;, and his &quot;Undivine Comedy&quot; remains one of the most important dramas, if not &quot;the&quot; most important Polish drama, of the Romantic period.

<text>Aldbourne ( ) is a village and civil parish about north-east of Marlborough, Wiltshire, England. It is in a valley on the south slope of the Lambourn Downs – part of the North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. From here an unnamed winterbourne flows south to join the River Kennet away near Ramsbury. The 2011 Census recorded the parish population as 1,833. The parish includes the hamlets of Upper Upham and Woodsend and part of the hamlet of Preston, which straddles the boundary with Ramsbury. The village of Snap became deserted in the early 20th century.

==History==
===Early periods===
Evidence of prehistoric activity on the chalk downs includes a barrow cemetery north-west of the village, a Bronze Age cross dyke to the north, and a field system in the valley around Snap.

There are extensive prehistoric or Romano-British field systems around Upper Upham. The west and north-east boundaries of the modern parish follow Roman roads, respectively the road from Cirencester to Cunetio (Mildenhall) and Ermin Street. Domesday Book in 1086 recorded a large settlement at &quot;Aldeborne&quot;, with 156 households, four mills and a church. Lewisham Castle is a small medieval ringwork about a mile and a half south-west of the village. It is not certain whether it was in fact a castle.
The Wiltshire Victoria County History traces the ownership of estates including Aldbourne manor, which was unusually large until it was broken up in the 17th century. Landowners include Rotrou IV, Count of Perche and descendants in the 12th century; William Longespée, 3rd Earl of Salisbury and descendants in the 13th and 14th; and trustees for the City of London for a short time in the 17th. An estate at Upham was given by Longespée to Lacock Abbey in 1249, and after the dissolution was bought in 1540 by John Goddard, whose descendants went on to be lords of the manor of Swindon.

Aldbourne was the wealthiest parish in Selkley hundred in the Middle Ages, and in 1377 the parish had 332 taxpayers. The population peaked around 1,600 in the mid-19th century, fell to 980 by the 1921 census, and has gradually risen since then.

In the English Civil War a Royalist force led by Prince Rupert fought a Parliamentarian force in a skirmish at Aldbourne Chase on 18 September 1643, two days before the First Battle of Newbury.

Fustian, a heavy cotton cloth, was woven in the village from at least the late 17th century. The industry was affected by a fire in 1760 and declined after the 1790s.

===Since 1800===
A Baptist chapel opened in 1841 in Back Lane and was rebuilt as New Zoar Chapel in 1868. It was sold in 1914 and demolished some time after 1931; its burial ground survives.

A Primitive Methodist chapel opened in West Street about 1840 and a new chapel was built on the site in 1906. Wesleyan Methodists built a chapel in Lottage Road in 1807, which was rebuilt in 1844. In 1968 the two congregations combined to build Aldbourne Methodist Church in Lottage Road. The chapel in West Street was demolished in 1982.

The Swindon, Marlborough and Andover Railway (later the Midland and South Western Junction Railway) opened between Swindon and Marlborough in 1881, alongside the Roman road in the west of the parish, just over the parish boundary. There was a station and small goods yard at Ogbourne. The line became part of the Great Western Railway in 1923 and closed in 1961, then dismantled.

During the Second World War, U.S. Army paratroopers of Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division were based at Aldbourne from late 1943 to mid-1944, in preparation for the Normandy landings in June 1944 and Operation Market Garden in September. Both Easy Company and the village featured in the 2001 HBO miniseries &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;, though scenes for Aldbourne were filmed at the village of Hambleden, near the Oxfordshire town of Henley-on-Thames.

Two disused village pumps survive in the village.

===Bell foundry===
For at least 130 years Aldbourne had a bell foundry. Master-founders at Aldbourne included Robert Cor (active 1694–1724), William Cor (active 1696–1722), Oliver Cor (active 1725–1727), John Cor (active 1728–1750), John Stares (active 1744–1746), Edward Read (active 1751–57), Edne Witts (active 1759–1774), Robert I Wells (active 1760–81), Robert II Wells (active 1781–1793) and James Wells (active 1792–1826). Bells cast by the Cor and Wells families survive at parish churches including Alvescot, Ashbury, Berwick St John, Blewbury, Church Hanborough, East Challow, Drayton, East Lockinge, Faringdon, Farnborough, Great Coxwell, Horspath, Longworth, Marcham, Marsh Baldon, St Nicolas Newbury, Northleach, Uffington, Seend, Sutton Courtenay, West Hanney and others. The ten bells at St Nicolas in Newbury include the only surviving full set of eight bells cast by James Wells of Aldbourne (in 1803); the tenor bell weighing 21cwt (slightly heavier than a ton) is the heaviest bell cast at Aldbourne.

==Parish church==
The medieval Church of England parish church of St Michael, overlooking the village green, is a Grade I listed building described by Nikolaus Pevsner as &quot;large and interesting&quot;. The nave and aisles were rebuilt in the first half of the 13th century, reusing fragments from a Norman church: one scalloped capital in the north arcade, and voussoirs in three of the arches in the south arcade. The south doorway of the nave is also from the 12th century, although parts of its stonework were replaced in the 19th. The chancel is Early English, with north and south chapels, and a sanctuary with lancet windows.

The Perpendicular Gothic three-stage tower was added in 1460 at the expense of Richard Goddard of Upham House. Until then the church probably had a central tower. It is ashlar, has angled buttresses and transomed three-light bell openings, with gargoyles above. There are transepts with three-light windows, a tall south porch – originally two-storey – and a bay between the porch and south transept. There was also a north porch until the building was restored by William Butterfield in 1863–1867; the work included new roofs for the nave and chancel, with the 15th-century roofs kept as a ceilings. The outside walls are of flint and limestone with some chequer-work and sarsen. They are crenellated. The roofs are lead and slate.

The font is probably from the 15th century, and the hexagonal carved wooden pulpit from about 1600. There are eight bells: two from the early 15th century, two from the 17th, and four cast locally in the 18th, one of them recast in 1915. Details of the gravestones and burial plots in the churchyard were recorded digitally in 2017–2018.

In 1956 the incumbent was authorised to hold both Aldbourne and Baydon, and the two benefices were united in 1965. Ramsbury was added in 1973, and today the church is one of six in the Whitton grouping.

==Notable buildings==

Court House, in its own grounds north of the church, has at its core a 16th-century farmhouse in flint and chalkstone; additions were made in brick in the 18th century and later. North of the house is an 18th-century carriage house and stables, with a small central clock-tower. A bell foundry was established in the grounds, probably in 1694, and continued to operate there until the 1760s. From 1809 to 1956 the house was used as the vicarage.

The Old Manor (formerly the Old Rectory), set behind brick walls on the south side of The Square, is a five-bay brick house from about 1740, with two further bays added on each side in the early 19th century.

Upham House, in the hamlet north-west of Aldbourne village, was built in 1599 for the Goddard family. The main part of the house, built in gritstone and flint, has a five-bay south-east front. It was Grade II* listed in 1966 and is now three dwellings.

West Leaze, on Ogbourne Road was built for Labour Party politicians Hugh and Ruth Dalton in 1929 as one of the most radical 20th century concrete houses to be built. It was designed by Irish born architect Frederick Edward Bradshaw MacManus who was working in the office of Sir John Burnet.

==Governance==

The parish has an elected parish council. It is within the area of the Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which performs the major local-government functions, and the Aldbourne and Ramsbury electoral ward, which includes the adjacent parishes of Baydon, Froxfield and Ramsbury. The 2011 Census gave a ward population of 5,231. For Westminster elections, the parish is in the East Wiltshire constituency.

==Amenities==
An open space in the centre of the village known as The Square has had a pond since at least the 18th century. Aldbourne has two public houses, the &quot;Blue Boar&quot; and the &quot;Crown&quot;, and a volunteer-run sports and social club. There is a Co-op supermarket and a village shop that includes a post office and a cafe. Aldbourne has had a village library since the 1930s, housed for the last few decades in South Street.

The village primary school, St Michael&#x27;s C of E (Aided) School, was built in 1963 on the site of a national school that opened in 1858.
Aldbourne Heritage Centre, next to the &quot;Crown Inn&quot;, is a museum run by the Aldbourne Community Heritage Group. It displays a changing array of exhibits from Aldbourne&#x27;s history, ranging from Stone Age flints and medieval documents to 19th and 20th-century photographs.

Aldbourne Band is a brass band that has won numerous national competitions.

==People==
Aldbourne people are nicknamed &quot;Dabchicks&quot; after the little grebe.

Johnny Morris (1916–1999), narrator and TV presenter known for the &quot;Animal Magic&quot; children&#x27;s programmes, was employed as a manager at an Aldbourne farm in the 1940s before becoming a full-time freelance broadcaster in the 1950s; he lived in Aldbourne until late in life.

Margaret Longhurst (1882–1958), the first female keeper in a major British museum, retired here and is remembered in the village&#x27;s heritage centre. Aldbourne was the home of the novelist Mavis Cheek in 2003–2015. Earlier residents included Jankel Adler (1895–1949), a Jewish Polish painter and printmaker who lived his last few years at Whitley Cottage, where he had a studio; Ruth Dalton (1890–1966), a Labour politician; and Anthony Marreco (1915–2006), a barrister and founding director of Amnesty International.

The author and historian Gerald Brenan and his American wife, the poet and novelist Gamel Woolsey, lived in Aldbourne from the late 1930s to 1953. Gerald&#x27;s long-time friend John Hope-Johnstone, a photographer with links to the Bloomsbury Group, lived in a cottage attached to their house until his death in 1970.

Hilda Hanbury (1872–1939), known for voluntary work, bought Upham House at Upper Upham in 1909 and restored and enlarged the house and its gardens. She became Lady Currie when her husband James Currie was knighted in 1920, and stood unsuccessfully for the Liberals at Devizes in the 1922 general election.

The classicist and educator Mary Creighton Bailey moved to Aldbourne after retirement, and died there. Composer David Gow and his wife Margaret lived in Aldbourne, having moved from Axford.

==Television==
In 1971, Aldbourne was the filming location for the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;The Dæmons&quot;, starring Jon Pertwee. The village in the story was called Devil&#x27;s End. In 1992, Reeltime Pictures filmed a direct-to-video documentary called &quot;Return to Devil&#x27;s End&quot; in Aldbourne, featuring Christopher Barry (director of the 1971 story) with cast members Jon Pertwee, Nicholas Courtney, Richard Franklin and John Levene.

Aldbourne was the filming location of the 2014 E4 television drama &quot;Glue&quot;, portraying the village of Overton. The village was also used as the filming location for Vodafone&#x27;s Christmas advertisement in 2018.

<doc id="1041550" wikidata="Q2211772" url="?curid=1041550" title="All Cannings">
<text>All Cannings (pronounced &quot;Allcannings&quot;) is a village and civil parish in the English county of Wiltshire, about east of Devizes. The parish includes the nearby smaller settlement of Allington. In 2011 the parish had a population of 649.

The southern part of the parish lies in the Vale of Pewsey, and in the north the parish extends some onto the Marlborough Downs and includes Tan Hill, which is (by a small margin) the second highest hill in Wiltshire. Etchilhampton Water, a tributary of the River Avon, forms part of the southern boundary of the parish. Moor Brook flows south through Allington and All Cannings villages to join it.

==History==
Prehistoric sites in the north of the present parish include Rybury Camp, a Neolithic causewayed enclosure overlaid by a late Bronze Age or early Iron Age hillfort, occupying some 2 hectares on a prominent ridge near Tan Hill. All Cannings Cross is an Iron Age site further south, which was investigated by Ben and Maud Cunnington from 1911; they made important finds of pottery. The Wansdyke earthwork crosses the parish in the far north.

The name is believed to be a derivation of &quot;Old Canning&quot;. A village probably existed on the current site by the tenth century, as the invading Danes at that time referred to Canning marsh.

In 1086, Domesday Book recorded land held by St Mary&#x27;s Abbey, Winchester at &quot;Caninge&quot;, with 58 households and a mill; and land held by Amesbury Abbey at &quot;Allentone&quot;, with 32 households.

There was a church from early in the 13th century and the earliest features in the current Church of England parish church are late Norman. By the 14th century the village had a water mill, but this had disappeared by the 18th century. In 1499, the Winchester abbey was granted the right to hold an annual fair near Wansdyke on Tan Hill (at the time known as Charlborough Down) which became a large sheep and horse fair, with amusements including horse racing. The fair continued to be held until World War II.

The Wiltshire Victoria County History traces the ownership of All Cannings manor from 1536, when it was granted to Edward Seymour, later Duke of Somerset. The land was sold as separate farms from 1909. Allington was held alongside Lydiard Tregoze until 1300, when it was allotted to John la Warr, 2nd Baron De La Warr (d.1347). Again the Victoria County History has the later owners, culminating in breakup and sale in 1907.

The Kennet and Avon Canal was built across the parish, passing just north of the village, and opened in 1810. The parish population peaked in the middle of the 19th century with the 1841 census showing 663 inhabitants.

The ancient parish had three tithings, All Cannings being the largest. Allington, a narrow strip to the west, was deemed a separate civil parish in 1881 and was united with All Cannings parish in 1934; its population in 1931 was 70. The third tithing was Fullaway (or Fullway), a small detached part between Stert and Urchfont, which was made a civil parish in 1857 and annexed to Stert parish in 1894, having a population around that time of 11.

==Religious sites==
=== Parish church ===
The Church of England parish church of All Saints (St Anne until c.1928), which stands at the south end of the village, took its present form in the 14th and 15th centuries and was restored in the 19th. It is a Grade II* listed building.

The church has a cruciform plan, which may reflect a Norman church on the same site; when the crossing was rebuilt in the 14th century, two short 12th-century columns and capitals were reused. The nave was re-roofed in 1638 and renewed in 1843. The chancel was rebuilt in 1678 and again in 1868–9, this time in Bath stone on a slightly narrower plan, to designs of Henry Weaver of Devizes. The elaborate interior decoration of the chancel is described by Historic England as Tractarian, with marble shafts decorating the four pairs of side windows, and an alabaster reredos with a relief of the Last Supper.

The three-stage central tower is mid-15th century and probably replaced an earlier one. It has a square stair-tower at its northeast corner, with a clock face on its north side. The Beauchamp Chapel, east of the south transept, is a chantry probably built by Richard Beauchamp, 6th Baron Amand (d. 1508).

The carved stone font is 15th-century, and its tall wooden cover is dated 1633. Monuments in the church include, at the west end of the south aisle, a large pedimented tablet to William Ernle (d. 1581) of Etchilhampton and his wife Jone; and at the same end of the north aisle, to Sir John Ernle, 5th baronet (d. 1734) – who was rector from 1709 – and his wife Elizabeth. Among the peal of six bells, two were cast by Roger Purdue of Salisbury bell foundry in 1626 and one by Thomas Rudhall in 1771.

The parish war memorial, a stone wheel-head cross unveiled in 1920, stands in the churchyard by its main entrance.

St Andrew&#x27;s church at Etchilhampton, built in the 14th century, was always a chapelry of All Cannings, and the parish became known as All Cannings with Etchilhampton. The benefice was united with Bishop&#x27;s Cannings in 1977 and today the All Cannings and Etchilhampton churches are part of the Cannings and Redhorn group. Parish registers from 1578 are held in the Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre, Chippenham.

=== Others ===
There was a church at Allington before 1100 but it fell into disuse, possibly in the 14th century.

Bethel Strict Baptist chapel opened at Allington in 1828 and is still in use. A Wesleyan Methodist chapel was registered in 1890 and closed sometime before 1959.

==Modern long barrow==
In 2015 the first long barrow in thousands of years, inspired by those built in the New Stone Age, was built on land just outside the village. The project was instigated by Tim Daw, a local farmer and a steward at Stonehenge.

The barrow was designed to have a large number of private niches within the stone and earth structure, to receive cremation urns. The structure received significant media attention as it was being built, and was fully subscribed within eighteen months.

== Notable buildings ==
All Cannings village has several groups of cottages, mostly thatched, the oldest bearing a 1647 datestone.

Rustic Farmhouse is a timber-framed house under a thatched roof, from the late 16th century. Cliff Farmhouse is another timber-framed house from the late 16th century or early 17th, originally T in plan but now L, partly rebuilt.

The former rectory, close to the church, was rebuilt in the mid-17th century and extended in the early and late 19th; the older core has a sarsen lower floor and brick upper, and limestone dressings. It was sold in 1969.

==Education==
All Cannings had a Sunday school by 1808 and a day-school by 1818. 100 pupils were enrolled in the day-school but attendance was much less as many of the children worked in the fields during the week.

By 1833 the village had two day-schools: the parish school with 105 pupils and a private school with 12 pupils. The Rector had the parish school built that year on land given by the Lord of the Manor, Alexander Baring.

The private school had closed by 1858. The parish school was reorganised in 1961 and moved into a new building in 2000.

==Rock Against Cancer concerts==
The Kings Arms public house hosts an annual &quot;Rock Against Cancer&quot; event called Concert at the Kings. Artists at the 2012 event included:

* Bob Harris (compere)
* Mike and the Mechanics
* Brian May
* Kerry Ellis
* Madeline Bell
* Midge Ure
* Tom Robinson 
* Chris Thompson
* Patti Russo
* The Sweet
* Strawbs
==Early concrete housing==
In 1868 Francis Baring, 3rd Baron Ashburton, and his tenant farmer Simon Hiscock decided to each build a pair of semi-detached workers cottages. They had two adjacent plots of the same size. The tenant built his pair of brick, his Lordship of concrete – the only major difference is that, in the absence of internal shuttering, the concrete chimneys are straight rather than bent to combine into a single chimney stack.

Both pairs of cottages still stand largely unaltered, although one of the concrete houses had an extension added in June 2006.

It is assumed that this was a trial into the efficacy of using shuttered reinforced concrete as a building method. It seems to have been successful as two more pairs were then built, followed by a more elaborate villa style pair of cottages and finally a large farmhouse. This experiment is little acknowledged outside the area. While these houses may not be the very first concrete houses built, they were built within a couple of years of the first one.

==Notable people==
*David Curwen (1913–2011) built miniature railway steam locomotives at All Cannings.
*Andy Scott (born 30 June 1949), guitarist with band The Sweet, and as of June 2020, the last surviving member of their &#x27;classic lineup&#x27;, lives in a converted barn at the village.

<doc id="1041551" wikidata="Q481559" url="?curid=1041551" title="Spätlese">
<text>(literal meaning: &quot;late harvest&quot;; plural form is &quot;Spätlesen&quot;) is a German wine term for a wine from fully ripe grapes, the lightest of the late harvest wines. &quot;Spätlese&quot; is a riper category than Kabinett in the &quot;Prädikatswein&quot; category of the German wine classification and is the lowest level of &quot;Prädikatswein&quot; in Austria, where Kabinett is classified in another way. In both cases, &quot;Spätlese&quot; is below Auslese in terms of ripeness. The grapes are picked at least seven days after normal harvest, so they are riper and have a higher sugar content. Because of the weather, waiting to pick the grapes later carries a risk of the crop being ruined by rain. However, in warm years and from good sites much of the harvest will reach &quot;Spätlese&quot; level.

The wines may be either sweet or dry; it is a level of ripeness that particularly suits rich dry wines from Riesling, Weißer Burgunder, and Grauer Burgunder grapes for example, as at Auslese levels the alcohol levels may become very high in a dry wine, leaving the wine unbalanced, making wines with at least some residual sweetness preferable to most palates. However, most German wines are traditionally dry, and the amount of sugar is not the only factor balancing a wine. Dry German wines can be very balanced, and usually get higher ratings from German wine journalists than a comparable wine with more sugar.

Many &quot;Spätlese&quot; wines will age well, especially those made from the Riesling grape.

== Characteristics ==


*Greater intensity and strength than Kabinett
*High level of acidity that curbs any overt sweetness
*Fleshy and intensely flavored
*Often tastes of apple, pear and honeysuckle
*Elegant nose with highly detectable aromas

== Requirements ==

The minimum must weight requirements for &quot;Spätlese&quot; are as follows:
* In German wine, 76 to 90 degrees Oechsle, depending on the region, 1g of moist cloyster (wine growing zone) and grape variety.
* In Austrian wine, 19 degrees KMW, corresponding to 95 °Oechsle.

Chaptalisation may not be used. The requirements are part of the wine law in both countries. Many producers, especially top-level producers, regularly exceed the minimum requirements.

== History ==
=== The &quot;Spätlese&quot; courier at Schloss Johannisberg ===
Legend has it that the introduction of the &quot;Spätlese&quot; category took place in the Rheingau winery Schloss Johannisberg in 1775, and happened by mere circumstance. Since 1718, permission to start harvest at Johannisberg was announced in writing from the Prince-Bishop of Fulda by means of a so-called autumn courier – &quot;Herbstkurier&quot;. In 1775, for some reason, the courier sent out by the abbey at Fulda was delayed for 14 days. According to some, the abbey&#x27;s messenger was robbed on the way to bring the official harvest picking order. By the time the order finally arrived noble rot had set in, but the harvest was carried out anyway, although no high hopes were staked on the wine from the rotten grapes. But rather than a failed product, the wine turned out to be surprisingly good. Schloss Johannisberg began actively seeking to produce late harvest – &quot;Spätlese&quot; – wines affected by noble rot. The delayed courier therefore became referred to as the &quot;Spätlesereiter&quot;.

In 1778 Thomas Jefferson tasted a bottle of &quot;Spätlese&quot; that was given to him and was so impressed that he advised friends who were in Europe to go to the Rheingau to experience the wines and bring a case back to America.

=== Additional Prädikat levels ===
Terminology for different levels of late harvest wines, based on grape selection, were then introduced starting with Auslese (&quot;Select harvest&quot;) being introduced in 1787, and additional levels added later. The key to these developments was selection of bunches and grapes by level of ripeness and botrytis, thus giving different wines from the same vineyard.

Therefore, the initial &quot;Spätlese&quot; terminology was for any late harvest wine, and the initial 1775 &quot;Spätlese&quot; wine was made from grapes that were affected by noble rot to the extent that they appeared unpalatable, and gave a very sweet wine. Such a wine would not really correspond to a modern-day &quot;Spätlese&quot;. Grapes of this character, vinified by themselves would rather give a Beerenauslese in modern terminology, and if bunches of such botrytis-affected grapes were mixed with more or less healthy bunches, it seems likely that the wine would be classed in the upper end of the Auslese range.

=== Later history ===
In the 1971 German wine law, the &quot;Spätlese&quot; Prädikat was given its present interpretation. In the early post-World War II era, the semi-sweet wines that Germany for long has been associated with became more common, since new methods by stopping fermentation and using Süssreserve were introduced. The &quot;Spätlese&quot; wines represents the &quot;high end&quot; of these semi-sweet, rather than fully sweet, wines, since they are not allowed to be chaptalized.
From the 1980s, and even more from the 1990s, production of dry wines became much more common in Germany. Thus, wines designated &quot;Spätlese trocken&quot; in many cases came to represent the best dry wines from many wineries. From the early 2000s, the new designations Grosses Gewächs and Erstes Gewächs have become more common, with the result that remaining &quot;Spätlese&quot; trocken wines rather represents the second-best dry wines.

In Austria, which largely abandoned the semi-sweet wine category in the wake of the 1985 diethylene glycol scandal in order to concentrate more on dry wines, &quot;Spätlese&quot; wines are much less common than in Germany.

<doc id="1041552" wikidata="Q2313942" url="?curid=1041552" title="Alton, Wiltshire">
<text>Alton is a civil parish in Wiltshire, England. The parish includes the adjacent villages of Alton Barnes and Alton Priors, and the nearby hamlet of Honeystreet on the Kennet and Avon Canal. It lies in the Vale of Pewsey about east of Devizes.

The north of the parish is on the Marlborough Downs and includes part of Milk Hill, which is the highest point in Wiltshire at . The Woodborough Stream, a tributary of the Hampshire Avon, rises at Alton Priors and separates the two villages as it flows south.

==History==
The area has prehistoric sites including the Knap Hill earthwork and Adam&#x27;s Grave, a Neolithic long barrow. A hoard of Roman coins was discovered at Alton Barnes.

The boundaries of Alton Barnes parish were established in the early 10th century, and the ancient parish became a civil parish in 1866. Alton Priors was a chapelry of Overton parish, now West Overton, and became a separate civil parish in 1866. In 1934 the civil parishes of Alton Barnes and Alton Priors were abolished and merged to form the new civil parish of Alton.

In 1086, Domesday Book recorded two landholdings within Swanborough Hundred at &quot;Awltone&quot;: one corresponding to Alton Barnes, held by Edward of Salisbury, with 14 households and a mill; and another held by Winchester Abbey with 50 households and two mills. The association of the latter with the abbey led later to the name Alton Priors. The Wiltshire Victoria County History traces the later ownership of the manors: Alton Barnes was granted in 1385 by William of Wykeham to New College, Oxford which he had recently founded, and it remained in their ownership in 1970. Alton Priors remained with the abbey until the dissolution, then passed through several hands until the estate was bought by New College in 1912.

The Ridgeway, an ancient trackway, passes through Alton Barnes (although this section is not part of the Ridgeway National Trail, which begins further north). The Wansdyke, an early medieval earthwork, crosses the north of the parish on the Marlborough Downs.

Alton Barnes Manor Farmhouse (18th-century) and the Manor House at Alton Priors (c. 1830) are Grade II listed.

==Governance==
Alton is a civil parish with an elected parish council. It is in the area of the Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions, and is represented in the council by Paul Oatway. For Westminster elections, the parish is within the East Wiltshire constituency.

==Parish churches==

Both villages had a Church of England parish church; Alton Barnes church continues in use.

=== St Mary, Alton Barnes ===
The Church of St. Mary the Virgin in Alton Barnes is partly Saxon, built in the 10th and 11th centuries, although Domesday Book mentions no church. It has only a chancel, nave and west tower. The nave has characteristic Anglo-Saxon features: typically tall, narrow proportions and (visible at the west end) long-and-short quoins. The round-headed north doorway, now blocked and glazed, is another early feature.

The south door was added in the 14th century. The original chancel was as wide as the nave, but it was demolished and replaced with a brick one in 1748. The two bells are dated 1626 and 1788, and were rehung in the west gable in 1904. 

There was a Saxon chancel arch but this was removed in 1832. There was a Victorian restoration in 1875, and a further restoration in 1904 directed by the local architect Charles Ponting. Pevsner assesses the nave as &quot;over-restored&quot; but praises its roof. The building was designated as Grade I listed in 1964.

=== All Saints, Alton Priors ===

Alton Priors&#x27; church was built in the 12th century and retains its original Norman chancel arch. The nave has two 14th-century ogee-headed windows and the west window is 15th-century. As at Alton Barnes, the original chancel has been demolished and replaced with one built of brick. There is a distinctive brass plaque to local landowner William Button (1526–1591), with complex artwork and inscription. All Saints was declared redundant in 1972 and was placed in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It is a Grade II* listed building.

=== Parish ===
Alton Priors was anciently a chapelry of Overton parish. In 1913, Alton Priors was annexed to Alton Barnes to form the parish of Alton Barnes with Alton Priors. The benefice was united with Stanton St Bernard in 1928, with the parsonage house at Stanton St Bernard to be sold, taking effect on the next vacancy (which occurred in 1932). At the same time, Honeystreet hamlet was brought into the parish from Woodborough and West Stowell hamlet was transferred to Wilsford.

A team ministry was established for the area in 1975, and today the parish is part of the Vale of Pewsey group, alongside 15 others.

== Notable buildings ==
The former Alton Barnes glebe house, now called the Old Rectory, stands west of the church. Built in vitrified brick with dressings in red brick and stone, it has two storeys with an attic. The five-bay east range is from the 1720s or 1730s, the rear block was added in 1785 and further alterations were made around the 1830s. Augustus William Hare, orator and writer, lived here c.1829 to 1833 during his rectorship, until his early death.

At Alton Priors, the limestone T-plan house known as the Manor House was built c.1830 in the north of the village; it is surrounded by an earlier walled garden and probably replaced an earlier house. The original manor house, now The Priory, stands by the stream that separates the two Altons; built in Flemish bond brickwork in the late 17th century, it was much reduced in size in the early 19th century. What remains is a four-bay block of two storeys with attic, and a single-storey kitchen wing.

==Canal==
The Kennet and Avon Canal, opened in 1810, crosses the parish. A wharf at Honeystreet served the local area and a rural industrial area developed around it, including a firm of barge builders – Robbins, Lane, and Pinniger – who continued until the 1950s.

The Barge Inn was built at Honeystreet in 1858, replacing an earlier building, to cater for those living and working on the canal. It was designated as Grade II listed in 1987. In 2010, following the closure of the business, local volunteers successfully applied for funding to aid its reopening from the Village SOS lottery fund. In 2011 the project was the subject of episode 2 of &quot;Village SOS&quot; on BBC One. The group ceased to run the pub in October 2012, but it is still open, albeit in private hands, as of February 2024.

==Notable people==
William Button (by 1503–1547, landowner) is buried in Alton Priors church, as is his son, also William (1526–1591). Both were Members of Parliament, as were two more family members: Ambrose (c.1549–c.1608) and Sir William Button, 1st Baronet (c.1584–1655).

Distinguished rectors of Alton Barnes include Richard Steward (c. 1593–1651, royalist churchman), rector from 1630; William Crowe (1745–1829, poet) from 1787; and Augustus William Hare (1792–1834, writer) from 1831.

==In popular culture==
The Barge Inn at Honeystreet was a filming location for a 1998 episode of &quot;Inspector Morse&quot;, an adaptation of &quot;The Wench Is Dead&quot;. In 2013 the white horse, Adam&#x27;s Grave and the Barge Inn featured in an episode of &quot;Walking Through History&quot;, presented by Tony Robinson on Channel 4.

==Amenities==
The Barge Inn at Honeystreet is the sole pub in the parish. Alton Barnes has a village hall, the Coronation Hall, which was built in 1953 and extended in 2000.

The nearest primary school is at Woodborough. A Parochial school was opened at Alton Barnes in 1837 and closed in 1976 owing to falling pupil numbers.

==Alton Barnes White Horse==

There is a chalk hill figure of a horse dating from 1812 (), a little more than 1000 m north of Alton. It is based on another white horse hill figure in Wiltshire, the Cherhill White Horse.

The figure is the third largest white horse in Wiltshire. The Pewsey White Horse can be seen from Milk Hill (the location of the horse). The figure is featured in &quot;Staying Out for the Summer&quot;, a music video for a song of the same name by Dodgy.

For April Fool&#x27;s Day in 2003 and 2014, the horse was temporarily transformed into a zebra, on the latter occasion by applying black stripes, made from plastic sheeting, across the horse.

==Crop circles==
Since the late 1970s Wiltshire has become known for crop circles (patterns created by flattening a crop, usually of cereal). In 1990 a pattern at Alton was used on the cover of the &quot;Box Set&quot; compilation by rock band Led Zeppelin.

<doc id="1041556" wikidata="Q243267" url="?curid=1041556" title="Juliusz Słowacki">
<text>Juliusz Słowacki (; ; ; 4 September 1809 – 3 April 1849) was a Polish Romantic poet. He is considered one of the &quot;Three Bards&quot; of Polish literature — a major figure in the Polish Romantic period, and the father of modern Polish drama. His works often feature elements of Slavic pagan traditions, Polish history, mysticism and orientalism. His style includes the employment of neologisms and irony. His primary genre was the drama, but he also wrote lyric poetry. His most popular works include the dramas &quot;Kordian&quot; and &quot;Balladyna&quot; and the poems &quot;Beniowski&quot;, &quot;Testament mój&quot; and &quot;Anhelli&quot;.

Słowacki spent his youth in the &quot;Stolen Lands&quot;, in Kremenets (; now in Ukraine) and Vilnius, Lithuania (Polish: Wilno). He briefly worked for the government of the Kingdom of Poland. During the November 1830 Uprising, he was a courier for the Polish revolutionary government. When the uprising ended in defeat, he found himself abroad and thereafter, like many compatriots, lived the life of an émigré. He settled briefly in Paris, France, and later in Geneva, Switzerland. He also traveled through Italy, Greece and the Middle East. Eventually he returned to Paris, where he spent the last decade of his life. He briefly returned to Poland when another uprising broke out during the Spring of Nations (1848).

Słowacki was born on 4 September 1809 at Kremenets (in Polish, &quot;Krzemieniec&quot;), Volhynia, formerly part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth but then in the Russian Empire and now in Ukraine.

His father, , a Polish nobleman of the Leliwa coat of arms, taught rhetoric, poetry, Polish language, and the history of literature at the Krzemieniec Lyceum in Kremenets; from 1811 he held the chair (&quot;katedra&quot;) of rhetoric and poetry at Vilnius Imperial University. He died in 1814, leaving Juliusz to be raised solely by his mother, (née Januszewska). In 1818 she married a professor of medicine, . She ran a literary salon where young Juliusz was exposed to diverse influences. It was there in 1822 that the 13-year-old met Adam Mickiewicz, the first of the Three Bards of Polish literature. Two years later, in 1824, Mickiewicz was arrested and exiled by the Russian authorities for his involvement in a secret patriotic Polish student society, the Philomaths; Słowacki likely met with him on Mickiewicz&#x27;s final day in Wilno.

Słowacki was educated at the Krzemieniec Lyceum, and at a Vilnius Imperial University preparatory &quot;gymnasium&quot; in Wilno. From 1825 to 1828 he studied law at Vilnius Imperial University. His earliest surviving poems date to that period, though he presumably wrote some earlier, none of which have survived. In 1829 he moved to Warsaw, where he found a job in Congress Poland&#x27;s . In early 1830 he debuted his literary career with the novel &#x27;, published in the periodical &quot;Melitele&quot;. That year, the November Uprising began, and Słowacki published several poems with patriotic and religious overtones. His &#x27;, first published in &quot;Polak Sumienny&quot; (&quot;The Conscientious Pole&quot;) on 4 December 1830, and other works such as &quot;&quot; (&quot;Oda do Wolności&quot;), won acclaim and were quickly reprinted several times.

In January 1831 he joined the diplomatic staff of the revolutionary Polish National Government, led by Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski. Initially he served as a copyist. On 8 March 1831 he was sent on a courier mission to Dresden (some sources say this was not an official mission but a private journey). Many others left Warsaw around that time, in the aftermath of the Battle of Olszynka Grochowska and in expectation of a Russian advance on Warsaw. In Dresden, Słowacki was well received by the local Polish émigré community, and even welcomed as &quot;the bard of fighting Warsaw.&quot; In July 1831 he volunteered to deliver messages from the National Government to its representatives in London and Paris, where he heard about the fall of the Uprising. Details of his mission (what letters he was carrying, and to whom) are not known.

===Emigration===

Like many of his countrymen, Słowacki decided to stay in France as a political refugee. In 1832 he published his first collections of poems and his first two dramas (&#x27; and &#x27;). He also met Mickiewicz again; reportedly, Mickiewicz approached his younger colleague and shook his hand. However, Słowacki&#x27;s poems, written in the 1820s, were unpopular among his Polish compatriots, as they failed to capture the sentiment of a people living under foreign occupation. Słowacki was also angered by Mickiewicz, who not only stole the limelight with his &quot;&quot; (&quot;Books of the Polish nation and pilgrimage&quot;), but his part three of &quot;Dziady&quot; (1832) cast Słowacki&#x27;s stepfather, professor Bécu, in the role of a villain. In a letter to his mother Słowacki wrote that immediately after reading that work he was ready to challenge Mickiewicz for a duel; that did not come to pass but from that moment on, Słowacki would see Mickiewicz as his main rival. Few days later, antagonized by worsening reception of his works among the Polish émigré community in Paris, including sharp criticism from Mickiewicz, Słowacki left on a trip to Geneva, Switzerland. The French authorities denied him the right to return to France as part of a larger program to rid the country of the potentially subversive Polish exiles who had settled there.

From 1833 to 1836, he lived in Switzerland. The third volume of his poems, published in 1833 and containing works from the period of the Uprising, was far more nationalist in tone and won more recognition in his homeland. At the same time, he wrote several works featuring Romantic themes and beautiful scenery, such as &quot;&quot; (&quot;In Switzerland&quot;), &quot;Rozłączenie&quot; (&quot;Separation&quot;), &quot;Stokrótki&quot; (&quot;Daisies&quot;) and &quot;Chmury&quot; (&quot;Clouds&quot;).

In 1834 he published &quot;Kordian&quot;, a Romantic drama relating to the soul-searching of the Polish people in the aftermath of the failed insurrection; this work is considered one of his best creations.

In 1836, Słowacki left Switzerland and embarked on a journey that started in Italy. In Rome he met and befriended Zygmunt Krasiński, the third of the Three Bards. Krasiński is considered the first serious literary critic of Słowacki&#x27;s work. Słowacki would dedicate several of his works, including &quot;Balladyna&quot;, to Krasiński and they would exchange a number of letters. From Rome, Słowacki went to Naples and later, to Sorrento. In August he left for Greece (Corfu, Argos, Athens, Syros), Egypt (Alexandria, Cairo, El Arish) and the Middle East, including the Holy Land (Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Jericho, Nazareth) and neighboring territories (Damascus, Beirut). It was a journey Słowacki described in his epic poem &#x27; (&quot;Travel to the Holy Land from Naples&quot;); his other works of that period inclucded the poem &#x27; (&quot;The Father of the Plague-stricken&quot;), &quot;&quot; (&quot;Agamemnon&#x27;s Grave&quot;), &quot;Rozmowa z piramidami&quot; (&quot;A talk with the pyramids&quot;), &quot;Anhelli&quot; and &quot;Listy poetyckie z Egiptu&quot; (&quot;Poetic Letters from Egypt&quot;). In June 1837 he returned to Italy, settling briefly in Florence, and moved back to Paris in December 1838.

In 1840 Mickiewicz was elected to the position of professor of Slavic literature at Collège de France; it was one of the events that cemented his position over Słowacki in the Polish émigré community. The rivalry between the two Bards for primacy would continue till the ends of lives. In 1841 Słowacki traveled briefly to Frankfurt, but Paris would become his main home till his death. In 1840 and 1841 he wrote two notable dramas: &#x27;, the only of his dramas that was put on stage during his lifetime, and &#x27;, published posthumously, well received by critics. Over the next few years Słowacki wrote and published many works, including &quot;Testament mój&quot; (&quot;My Last Will&quot;), in which he described his faith that his works would endure after his death.

Between 1841 and 1846, he published &quot;Beniowski&quot;, considered by some his best lyrical poetry. Starting as a story of a historical figure, it developed into a discussion of the poet&#x27;s own life and opinions. In 1842 he joined the religious-philosophical group, (Circle of God&#x27;s Cause), led by Andrzej Towiański. This group included, among others, Mickiewicz. Towiański&#x27;s influence is credited with a new, mystical current in Słowacki&#x27;s works, seen in works such as the &quot;Beniowski&quot; and the drama &quot;&quot; (&quot;Father Mark&quot;). Słowacki left the Circle a year later, in 1843.

In the summers of 1843 and 1844 Słowacki traveled to Pornic, a resort on the Atlantic coast in Brittany. It was there, in 1844, that he wrote &quot;&quot; (&quot;Genesis from the Spirit&quot;). This work introduced his philosophical system that would have a visible influence on his works in his last decade. Around 1839 Słowacki put his capital into the Parisian stock market. He was a shrewd investor who earned enough from the investments to dedicate his life to his literary career; he was also able to pay the costs of having his books published.

===Last years===

In the late 1840s Słowacki attached himself to a group of like-minded young exiles, determined to return to Poland and win its independence. One of his friends was the pianist and composer Frédéric Chopin. Others included enthusiasts of his work, such as Zygmunt Szczęsny Feliński, Józef Alojzy Reitzenheim and Józef Komierowski. Despite poor health, when he heard about the events of the Spring of Nations, Słowacki traveled with some friends to Poznań, then under Prussian control, hoping to participate in the Wielkopolska Uprising of 1848. He addressed the National Committee (Komitet Narodowy) in Poznań on 27 April. &quot;I tell you&quot;, he declared as the rebels faced military confrontation with the Prussian Army, &quot;that the new age has dawned, the age of holy anarchy.&quot; But by 9 May, the revolt was crushed.

Arrested by the Prussian police, Słowacki was sent back to Paris. On his way there, he passed through Wrocław, where in mid-June he was reunited with his mother, whom he had not seen for almost twenty years. He returned to Paris in July 1848. His poem &quot;Pośród niesnasków Pan Bóg uderza...&quot; (&quot;Among the discord God hits...&quot;), published in late 1848, gained new fame a century later when it seemed to foretell the 1978 ascent of Karol Wojtyła to the throne of St. Peter as Pope John Paul II. His final dramas (&#x27;, &#x27;), attempted to explain history of Poland through Słowacki&#x27;s genesic philosophy. In March 1849, Słowacki, his health failing, was visited three times by another Polish writer and poet, Cyprian Norwid, who later wrote about his visits in &#x27; (&quot;Black Flowers. White Flowers&quot;). Up to his final days, Słowacki was writing poetry; a day before his death he dictated passages of his final work, &#x27; (&quot;King-Spirit&quot;). This grandiose, visionary-symbolic poem, &quot;summary of the entire Romantic culture&quot;, Słowacki&#x27;s masterpiece, weaving together Poland&#x27;s history and its contemporary political and literary thought, was never finished.

Słowacki died in Paris on 3 April 1849 from tuberculosis, and on 5 April he was buried in the Montmartre Cemetery in Paris. He never married. Only about 30 people attended his funeral. Krasiński, although estranged from Słowacki in the last few years, wrote of the funeral:

Słowacki&#x27;s tombstone at Montmartre was designed by his friend and executor of his last will, painter Charles Pétiniaud-Dubos; it did not weather the passage of time well however, and in 1851 a new, similar tombstone was put in place, this one designed by Polish sculptor Władysław Oleszczyński. In 1927 Słowacki&#x27;s remains were moved to Wawel Cathedral in Poland, but an empty grave still remains at Montmartre.

==Work==

Słowacki was a prolific writer; his collected works (&quot;Dzieła wszystkie&quot;) were published in 17 volumes. His legacy includes 25 dramas and 253 works of poetry. He wrote in many genres: dramas, lyrical poems, literary criticism, letters, journals and memoirs, fragments of two novels, and a political brochure; he was also a translator. His letters to his mother are among the finest letters in all Polish literature.

Although the majority of his works were in Polish, he tried his hand at several works in French language (&quot;Le roi de Landawa&quot;, &quot;Beatrix Cenci&quot;). Many of his works were published only posthumously, often under arbitrary titles, as Słowacki never named them himself. He also left notes on works that he never began or never completed. Słowacki is also considered the father of modern Polish drama.

Polish literary historian divides Słowacki&#x27;s work into four periods: Wolter&#x27;s circle (pseudoclassicism), Christian ethic, Towiański&#x27;s ethic and genesic ethic. Other scholars offer slightly different periodizations; for example dividing his works into a classical period, a Swiss period, a Parisian period and a genesis period. Philologist combines Towiański&#x27;s period with the genesic ones, speaking of a &quot;mystical&quot; period. Overall, Słowacki&#x27;s early work was influenced by Byron and Shakespeare, and included works that was often historical in nature, like (as in &quot;Maria Stuart&quot; or &quot;Mindowe&quot;), or exotic, Oriental locales (as in &quot;&quot;). His work took on a more patriotic tone following the failed November Uprising of 1830–1831. His final works are heavy in mystical and philosophical undertones. In the 1840s he developed his own philosophy, or mystical system, with works such as &quot;Król-Duch&quot; and &quot;Genesis z Ducha&quot; being an exposition of his philosophical ideas (&quot;&quot;) according to which the material world is an expression of an ever-improving spirit capable of progression (transmigration) into constantly newer forms. As Ławski notes, his philosophical works can transcend clear boundaries of simple literary genres.

Słowacki&#x27;s works, situated in the period of romanticism in Poland, contain rich and inventive vocabulary, including many neologisms. They use fantasy, mysticism and symbolism and feature themes related to Poland&#x27;s history, essence of Polishness, and relation to a larger universe. Ławski, enumerating the main characteristics of Słowacki&#x27;s writings, notes first that he was a &quot;creationist&quot;, in the sense of creating new meanings and words (many of his characters bear names he invented himself, such as Kordian). Second, he notes that Słowacki was not only inspired by works of others, from poets and writers to scholars and philosophers, but that his texts were often a masterful, ironic-grotesque polemic with other creators. For example, Słowacki was so impressed by Antoni Malczewski&#x27;s &#x27; that he wrote a sequel to it, &#x27;. Likewise, &quot;Kordian&quot; is seen as building on William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and as Słowacki&#x27;s response to Mickiewicz&#x27;s &quot;Dziady&quot;. This Ławski calls &quot;ivy-like imagination&quot;, comparing Słowacki&#x27;s approach to that of an ivy, growing around works of others and reshaping them into new forms in a sophisticated literary game. Third, Słowacki was a master of irony; he used it not only on others, but on himself, and even on irony itself – the &quot;irony of irony&quot;.

==Legacy==

After his death, Słowacki acquired the reputation of a national prophet. He is now considered to be one of the &quot;Three Bards&quot; (&quot;wieszczs&quot;) of Polish literature.
Słowacki was not a very popular figure in Paris, nor among his contemporaries. He wrote many dramas, which can be seen as his favorite genre, yet he was a playwright who never saw any of his work performed on stage (only &quot;Mazepa&quot; was staged during his lifetime, and not in his presence). His works, written in Polish, dense with Slavic myths, philosophy and symbols, were difficult to translate to other languages. Słowacki&#x27;s unpopularity among other Polish émigrés can be attributed to his unwillingness to pander to contemporary tastes; and in particular, his refusal to comfort his compatriots, shaken by the loss of Polish statehood and the failure of the November Uprising. Słowacki&#x27;s ironic and sometimes pessimistic attitude was not appreciated by his contemporaries, nor was his denial of Polish uniqueness.

Whereas Mickiewicz followed the Messianic tradition and in &quot;Konrad&quot; suggested that Poland&#x27;s fate was in the hands of God, Słowacki&#x27;s &quot;Kordian&quot; questioned whether his country was not instead a plaything of Satan. However, the same work has God and the Angels watching over Poland and the Earth. In &quot;Anhelli&quot;, Słowacki&#x27;s describes the tragic fate of Polish exiles in Siberia, painting a gloomy vision of Poland&#x27;s destiny; the same topic was taken by Mickiewicz in the &quot;Books of the Polish Nation and of the Polish Pilgrimage&quot; as a call for Poles to spread hope and spirituality across Europe. While a small circle of his friends talked about his wit, perseverance and inspiration, in popular memory he was a &quot;sickly man of weak character&quot;, egocentric, bitter due to his failed rivalry with Mickiewicz. Mickiewicz himself wrote of Słowacki&#x27;s work as a &quot;beautiful church, but without God inside&quot;.

After his death, Słowacki gained a cult-like status in Poland; in particular, in the cultural center of Kraków. Several obituaries and longer articles appeared in the Polish press upon Słowacki&#x27;s death. His works, many of them published posthumously for the first time, found growing acceptance among a new generation; an 1868 work noted that &quot;Słowacki took the fancy of the Polish youth. He was its singer, its spiritual leader in the full meaning of the term&quot;. Through undoubtedly a poet of the romantic era, he was increasingly popular among the positivists and the authors of the Young Poland period in the late 1800s and early 1900s. His works were popularized by other writers, such as Adam Asnyk and Michał Bałucki, and his dramas were shown in theaters. He became a major literary figure for the new generation of Polish writers. He also became respected abroad; a 1902 English language book edited by Charles Dudley Warner noted that &quot;the splendid exuberance of his thought and fancy ranks him among the great poets of the nineteenth century&quot;.

In 1927, some eight years after Poland had regained independence, the Polish government arranged for Słowacki&#x27;s remains to be transferred from Paris to Wawel Cathedral, in Kraków. He was interred in the , beside Mickiewicz. Słowacki&#x27;s interment at Waweł Cathedral was controversial, as many of his works were considered heretical by Polish Catholic-Church officials. It took almost two decades and the backing of Józef Piłsudski, for whom Słowacki was a favorite poet, to obtain the Church&#x27;s agreement to interring Słowacki at Wawel Cathedral. At the 1927 ceremony, Piłsudski commanded:

Several streets and schools in modern Poland bear Juliusz Słowacki&#x27;s name. Three parks are dedicated to him: in Bielsko-Biała, in Łódź and in Wrocław. There are several monuments of Juliusz Słowacki, including ones in Warsaw (2001) and Wrocław (1984).

Among the most notable landmarks bearing his name is the Juliusz Słowacki Theatre in Kraków, and the , Ukraine, opened in 2004 at his family&#x27;s former manor house. In 2009 the Polish Sejm (parliament) declared that year, the two-hundredth anniversary of Słowacki&#x27;s birth, to be the Year of Juliusz Słowacki. The oldest monument to Juliusz Słowacki, unveiled in 1899, is in Miloslaw Park.

In 2014, his 205th birthday was honored with a Google Doodle.

<text>are ancient reports on provincial culture, geography, and oral tradition presented to the reigning monarchs of Japan, also known as local gazetteers. They contain agricultural, geographical, and historical records as well as mythology and folklore. &quot;Fudoki&quot; manuscripts also document local myths, rituals, and poems that are not mentioned in the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; chronicles, which are the most important literature of the ancient national mythology and history. In the course of national unification, the imperial court enacted a series of criminal and administrative codes called &quot;ritsuryō&quot; and surveyed the provinces established by such codes to exert greater control over them.

== Kofudoki ==

In the narrower sense, &quot;Fudoki&quot; refer to the oldest records written in the Nara period, later called . Compilation of &quot;Kofudoki&quot; began in 713 and was completed over a 20-year period. Following the Taika Reform in 646 and the Code of Taihō enacted in 701, there was need to centralize and solidify the power of the imperial court. This included accounting for lands under its control. According to the &quot;Shoku Nihongi&quot;, Empress Genmei issued a decree in 713 ordering each to collect and report the following information:
*Etymology of names for geographic features, such as mountains, plains, and rivers 
*Land fertility
*Myths, legends, and folktales told orally by old people
*Names of districts and townships
*Natural resources and living things

==Names==

Empress Genmei ordered in 713 that place names in the provinces, districts, and townships be written in two kanji characters with positive connotations. This occasionally required name changes. For example, became and became .

==Manuscripts==

At least 48 of the Gokishichidō provinces contributed to their records but only that of Izumo remains nearly complete. Partial records of Hizen, Bungo, Harima and Hitachi remain and a few passages from various volumes remain scattered throughout various books. Those of Harima and Hizen are designated National Treasures.

Below is a list of extant manuscripts and scattered passages.

==Parks==
In 1966, the Agency for Cultural Affairs called on the prefectural governments to build open-air museums and parks called near historic sites such as tombs (&quot;kofun&quot;) and provincial temples. These archaeological museums preserve and exhibit cultural properties to enhance public understanding of provincial history and culture.

<doc id="1041562" wikidata="Q3109569" url="?curid=1041562" title="Goat Rocks">
<text>Goat Rocks is an extinct stratovolcano in the Cascade Range, located between Mount Rainier and Mount Adams in southern Washington, in the United States. Part of the Cascade Volcanoes, it was formed by the subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate under the western edge of the North American Plate. The volcano was active from 3.2 million years ago until eruptions ceased between 1 and 0.5 million years ago. Throughout its complex eruptive history, volcanism shifted from silicic explosive eruptions to voluminous, mafic activity.

The volcano and the surrounding Goat Rocks Wilderness, established in 1964, are named after the numerous mountain goats which live in the area. The variable climate of the wilderness area supports a host of wildlife, including marmots, pikas, deer, and elk. Various peaks within the wilderness can be climbed or scrambled, and other activities such as hiking are permitted. The area is rife with minerals and resources, including coal, cobalt, copper, and base metals.

== Geography and geology ==
Goats Rocks volcano is located in southern Washington, west of Yakima, at latitude 46.50° N and longitude 121.45° W. This region of the Cascades was originally occupied by Native Americans, who hunted and fished in its vicinity and used its trails as trade routes. Goat Rocks lies in a zone of intermittent volcanism which has produced many small volcanic vents, also including the Mount Adams volcanic field and Indian Heaven. Situated in the eastern portion of the Cascade Range, Goat Rocks lies at the northwest corner of the Klickitat River basin. As a member of the Cascade Volcanoes, Goat Rocks was produced by the subduction of the oceanic Juan de Fuca plate under the western edge of the continental North American Plate. This fault, known as the Cascadia subduction zone, lacks the deep oceanic trench usually found at convergent plate boundaries, which can probably be explained by its slow rate of subduction. According to the United States Geological Survey, the Nazca and North American plates converge at a rate of each year, just half of their convergence rate as recently as 7 million years ago.


The Cascade Volcanoes in Washington are restricted to four belts; Goat Rocks forms one segment of the north–south trending Mount Adams belt that also incorporates Tumac Mountain, Adams, and the King Mountain Fissure Zone. Of the four Cascade arcs, this belt contains the second most volcanoes, and its volcanoes are predominantly made of calc-alkalic to tholeiitic to basaltic andesite lava. Goat Rocks and its immediate vicinity are underlain by pre-Tertiary greywacke and argillite, and these deposits are cut by several prominent northward-trending faults. Overlaying these deposits are Cenozoic volcanic rocks, including the thick, Eocene-aged Ohanapecosh Formation, comprised by chemically altered basalt and andesite lava flows and bedded andesite and dacite volcaniclastic rock. In turn, the Stevens Ridge Formation overlies the Ohanapecosh layer, featuring quartz-bearing silicic tuff, rhyolite, and other volcaniclastic rocks. Under both layers is the Russell Ranch Formation, in thickness, which contains deposits of lapilli and tuff hinting at a caldera, although geologists have failed to identify clear evidence for the formation of a caldera in this zone.

Together with Mount Adams, Mount Rainier, and Mount St. Helens, the Goat Rocks volcano is part of a triangle of volcanoes, an arrangement not found elsewhere in the Cascades. This may be related to a mid-crust zone with abnormally high electrical conductivity, the Southern Washington Cascades Conductor (SWCC), which is not well understood by geologists. Scientists from the United States Geodynamics Committee hypothesized in 1994 that this anomaly is associated with the thrust of a large deposit of sedimentary rock against a continental margin. However, Hill et al. (2009) dismiss this view as it proves inconsistent with maps made from magnetotelluric readings of the area. Instead, they propose that the anomaly is linked to the region&#x27;s volcanism, which has caused partial melting of the crust.

The oldest Cascade stratovolcano formed after the Columbia River Basalt Group, Goat Rocks is roughly equal in volume to Mount St. Helens and smaller in volume than Mount Baker, at approximately . Rough estimates place the composition of the volcano as 40% tuff and breccia. The remains of its lava flows can be found in the Tieton, Klickitat, and Cispus river valleys, their elevation reversed by erosion to make them resemble ridges. These flows have been thoroughly eroded, but testify to the volcano&#x27;s previous size.

=== Glaciation ===
Although it may have once been a towering stratovolcano, Goat Rocks has undergone extensive erosion since its extinction. Once eruptions ceased, the ongoing forces of glacial erosion, as well as hydrothermal alteration of the volcano&#x27;s interior, stripped away layers of volcanic ash deposits and lava flows, uncovering the rocky lava spines where magma had cooled and hardened within the conduits of the volcano. Nearly all the remaining volcanic debris has been partially covered by a younger layer of rock.

The Goat Rocks area is notable for its extensive glaciers, despite its modest elevation and southerly location relative to the rest of the Washington Cascades. Four major glaciers mantle the north and northeast slopes of the peaks: Conrad Glacier, McCall Glacier, Meade Glacier, and Packwood Glacier, along with numerous smaller permanent snowfields.

=== Major peaks in the Goat Rocks vicinity ===
The elevation of the Goat Rocks volcano and its immediate vicinity varies from at its highest point, Gilbert Peak. Because of extensive glaciation and erosion, the peaks surrounding Goat Rocks are at most moderate in height.
== Eruptive history ==
Goat Rocks is a stratovolcano with a somewhat complicated eruptive history. It first became active approximately 3.2 million years ago during the Pliocene epoch, undergoing explosive eruptions that ejected silicic lava with highly felsic rocks like rhyolite. One of these events produced of tuff that remains, exposed, on the east flank of the existing mountain. This rhyolitic episode also produced the Devil&#x27;s Horn caldera. The amount of rhyolite tuff exceeds .

Three million years ago Goat Rocks shifted to mafic volcanism, erupting olivine and basalt. As eruptions continued into the Pleistocene epoch, the lava flows became increasingly andesitic, containing mostly pyroxene with phenocrysts as well as hornblende minerals. These andesitic flows formed the volcano&#x27;s major edifice between roughly 2.5 and 0.5 million years ago, which may have resembled contemporary Mount Rainier. At this point in time, Goat Rocks&#x27;s eruptions had very high volumes and extended far from the volcano, possibly because multiple satellite vents contributed to eruptions.

Approximately 1.64 million years ago, Goat Rocks generated an andesitic lava flow extending down the Naches and Tieton Rivers, which has been recognized as the longest andesite flow on Earth having a total volume of . About 250,000 years after this andesite flow a second flow erupted from Bear Creek Mountain, the second flow took a similar path as the older one and had a total volume of . Many of the flows immediately surrounding the volcano have since been cut by intrusive dikes, which form a radial arrangement around the volcano&#x27;s core.

As erosion occurred on a large scale, the volcano remained active, producing more hornblende andesite lava flows. Eruptive activity continued at Old Snowy Mountain into the middle to late Pleistocene, yielding hornblende andesite lava flows that were subsequently glaciated in the Cispus River valley; whether Old Snowy Mountain is a vent of Goat Rocks or an independent volcano remains unclear. Hornblende andesite can also be found on top of the highest point in Goat Rocks, Gilbert Peak.

Hogback Mountain, a shield volcano north of Goat Rocks and south of White Pass, was identified by Siebert et al. (2010) as a satellite vent of Goat Rocks. Rising in elevation, it erupted more than of olivine basalt and basaltic andesite from the end of the Pliocene through the early Pleistocene. Eruptions from Goat Rocks formed a spread-out volcanic field populated by small lava domes and cinder cones as far north as an unnamed vent on American Ridge north of Bumping Lake. Spiral Butte along US 12 near White Pass is one of these vents, having erupted less than 690,000 years ago. The volcanic field&#x27;s dimensions are approximately .

Goat Rocks is now classified as an extinct volcano, as its most recent eruptive activity was during the Pleistocene. The last eruption from the Goat Rocks complex occurred around 115,000 years ago. It was an effusive lava flow known as the Clear Fork Lava. The flow was primarily composed of dacite and flowed along the White Pass Highway and has an estimated volume of .

== Wilderness ==

Land surrounding Goat Rocks was first protected by the United States Department of Agriculture in February 1931, when approximately was set aside for preservation. In 1935, this was increased to of land, then to in 1940. In 1964, the United States Congress created the Goats Rock Wilderness as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System, delegating its management to the United States Forest Service. Since additional land was incorporated in 1984, it now encompasses between Mount Rainier and Mount Adams, straddling the Gifford Pinchot and Okanogan-Wenatchee national forests. It is bordered by the Yakama Indian Reservation to the southeast.

The wilderness ranges from in elevation, featuring alpine tundras with glaciers, small lakes, and ponds, as well as 15 different routes that amount to of trails. One of these trails constitutes the highest segment of the famous Pacific Crest Trail in Washington, running for north–south through the middle of the wilderness area. Because this route is located at such a high elevation, its hikers may experience violent storms that could be dangerous for unprepared parties. Much of the wilderness is located above the timberline, offering views of alpine scenery.

=== Climate and wildlife ===
Weather within the Wilderness varies due to the mountains acting as a barrier for both weather and temperature. The Cascade Range mountains prevent wet storms from moving, forcing air to rise and then cool. This cooling air cannot hold as much moisture, causing heavy precipitation (up to in rainfall annually) on the western flanks of the mountains, which leads to extensive forestation. Snowfall typically totals more than annually, amounting to snow still being present as late as July or August. In warmer months, melted snow runs off into lakes, keeping them especially full. Because the mountains are so tall, storm clouds may get stuck even as the rest of the storm moves onward, leading to snowstorms and freezing temperatures year-round. In extreme conditions, these storm cells might endanger hikers by means of strong winds, fog, snow, and rain that can potentially make hiking nearly impossible. On the eastern sides of the mountains, air warms as it drops, producing Chinook winds, considerably lower precipitation, and less forested landscapes. Because of these conditions, temperatures on the western sides of mountains are steady, whereas temperatures on the eastern flanks fluctuate wildly.

Goat Rocks obtained its name from a population of mountain goats that can be observed around the mountain. Other fauna include marmots and pikas at high elevations. Deer and elk can be found below the timberline, including mule deer, mule deer-black-tailed hybrids, Roosevelt elk, and Rocky Mountain elk that were introduced from Yellowstone National Park in 1913. Black-tailed deer are especially common.

=== Climbing and recreation ===
Old Snowy Mountain and Gilbert Peak, two of Goat Rocks&#x27;s peaks, are frequented by hikers and mountaineers. Both are considered remote summits, although Old Snowy Mountain is the more accessible of the two. This, coupled with its easier ascent, makes Old Snowy Mountain the more popular climb. There are several routes up the mountain, which take 5–6 hours, rising in elevation. Running for round-trip, Old Snowy can be scrambled or climbed using glaciers, although a trail exists. From the summit, mountaineers can see Mount St. Helens and Mount Rainier in the distance. Because this area has a lot of loose talus and rock, an avalanche hazard exists.

The climb up Gilbert Peak was first completed by Fred G. Plummer in 1899. It also rises in elevation, lasting 6–8 hours and running for round-trip. Because the routes are longer and more technically challenging due to loose rock, scrambling Gilbert is generally considered more difficult than Old Snowy Mountain. Most climbers opt to mount Gilbert early in the climbing season when snow levels are low.

Recreational activities permitted by the Forest Service at the Wilderness include day hiking, horse riding, and backpacking. Because Goat Rocks is part of the National Wilderness Preservation System, motor vehicles and means of transport are prohibited. These include bicycles, wagons, motorboats, and helicopters. A free permit is required for entry to the wilderness.

===References===
Mineral resources in the Goat Rocks area can be divided into three segments, each rich with certain minerals. The first two are named Packwood Glacier–McCall Basin and Glacier Basin, and are located near past volcanic vents. These areas exhibit anomalous levels of cobalt, copper, lead, molybdenum, nickel, and zinc, well-dispersed levels of pyrite, and sporadic concentrations of silver. Area C corresponds to the Clear Fork of the Cowlitz River and lies along the area of contact between Goat Rocks volcano and older volcanoes to the east. It is distinct from the other two study areas, featuring anomalous amounts of barium, cobalt, copper, and manganese, as well as smaller quantities of lead, molybdenum, nickel, and zinc. Other minerals found in Area C include barite, boron, cinnabar, mercury, pyrite, and tin in concentrates taken from stream-sediment. The water has high concentrations of chlorine, copper, fluorine, and molybdenum, and altered rocks contain arsenic, lead, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc at especially high levels. The Goat Rocks vicinity seems to offer large base metal deposits. Outside the area studied, coal has been identified at the Packwood and Cowlitz fields, and building stones and gravel are being quarried to the north and west of the volcano. The Goat Rocks area&#x27;s potential resources for oil and gas remain unidentified. Because no volcanic activity has occurred during the Holocene (within the past 11,700 years), Goat Rocks has very little potential for geothermal resources.

Claims to three lode mines and a single coal mine were made within the Goat Rocks Wilderness, but the United States Bureau of Mines has no record of production from any of these claims. Historically, two claims have actually been staked in the area, the Mosquito lode near Walupt Lake in 1934, and later, the Glacier lode near Packwood Glacier in 1939. Neither show evidence of assessment work, and both deposits are now abandoned. Miners may have been drawn to the area by news of lode deposits containing gold, silver, and copper along breccia and shear zones to the north of the wilderness area.

<text>Bather load refers to the capacity of a municipal swimming pool, a water fountain, or similar facility. Often bather load is dictated by the capacity of water treatment equipment (filters, chemical processing, and the like). Facilities intended only for decoration (i.e. not intended to support a bather load) must maintain a certain minimum standard of water quality, since children often play in, or drink from them.

Bather load can be defined as the number of bathers using the pool in a 24-hour period. A certain per-capita capacity for bather load is often considered. For example, on a hot summer day, it is desired that there be reasonable capacity in waterplay areas, bathing fountains, and municipal swimming baths, to accommodate the population of potential bathers. Such percentage is expressed as the BLPP (Bather Load as a Percentage of Population).

<doc id="1041565" wikidata="Q426856" url="?curid=1041565" title="Auslese">
<text>Auslese (, ; plural form is &quot;Auslesen&quot;) is a German language wine term for a late harvest wine and is a riper category than Spätlese in the &quot;Prädikatswein&quot; category of the Austrian and German wine classification.

== Harvest ==
The grapes are picked from selected very ripe bunches in the autumn (late November-early December), and have to be hand-picked. Generally Auslese wine can be made in only the best harvest years that have been sufficiently warm. A small proportion of the grapes may be affected by noble rot in some regions although this never dominates the character of the wine. Rheingau winemaker Schloss Johannisberg is generally credited with discovering Auslese wine in 1787.

Auslesen are sometimes considered a German dessert wine, especially the wines made from botrytis infected bunches, though it is not as sweet as Eiswein, Beerenauslese (BA), or Trockenbeerenauslese (TBA) dessert wines.

Auslesen can be enjoyed by themselves (&quot;aperitif&quot; – an &quot;afternoon wine&quot;) but are usually best accompanied with food, particularly those that exhibit the hearty characteristics of German cuisine.

The term in Alsace most closely corresponding to Auslese in terms of must weight requirements is &quot;Vendange tardive&quot;, even though this French term is linguistically equivalent to the German term &quot;Spätlese&quot;.

== Requirements ==

The minimum must weight requirements for Auslese is as follows:
* In German wine, 83 to 100 degrees Oechsle, depending on the region (wine growing zone) and grape variety.
* In Austrian wine, 21 degrees KMW, corresponding to 105 °Oechsle.

Chaptalisation may not be used. The requirements are part of the wine law in both countries. Many producers, especially top-level producers, exceed the minimum requirements by a wide margin, resulting in richer and sweeter Auslesen that may even exceed the minimum requirements for Beerenauslese, the next &quot;Prädikat&quot; in order. In Germany, it is common to add stars (usually * to ***) on the wine label, &quot;Fuder&quot; (vat) numbers or a golden capsule, to indicate this.

== Dry Auslese ==

The wines are occasionally made dry (trocken) in some areas, such as Palatinate (Pfalz) but are more typically sweeter, as the very high alcohol levels (around 13-14%) in dry examples can make them unbalanced particularly when young. The typical must weight for an Auslese is 90° Oechsle. These wines, particularly when made from the riesling grape can age for very long periods of time, often ten years or more.

With the recent introduction of the new classifications of top dry German wines, Erstes Gewächs and Grosses Gewächs, the Verband Deutscher Prädikatsweingüter (VDP) has discouraged the continued use of Auslese trocken, as it has been seen as confusing for the consumer to have sweet and powerful dry wines with the same Prädikat. However a significant number of VDP members are still using the Prädikat classification on dry Wines, since the Prädikat only is dedicated to the quality level of the picked grapes and not the taste.

== Red wine Auslese ==

As German winemakers try to carve out a niche in developing red wine, the Auslese ripeness classification has come into play as the ideal level to produce Spätburgunder (Pinot noir), particularly in the Rheingau, Pfalz, and Baden regions. Winemakers are experimenting with grapes at Auslese level ripeness with Burgundian style production methods involving oak and a higher extraction of tannin levels.

These wines are also increasingly labelled Erstes Gewächs and Grosses Gewächs rather than Auslese.

<doc id="1041577" wikidata="Q310073" url="?curid=1041577" title="Mark Henry">
<text>Mark Jerrold Henry (born June 12, 1971) is an American former powerlifter, Olympic weightlifter, strongman, and retired professional wrestler. He is best known for his 25-year career in WWE.

Henry is a two-time Olympian (1992 and 1996) and a gold, silver, and bronze medalist at the Pan American Games in 1995. As a powerlifter, he was WDFPF World Champion (1995) and a two-time U.S. National Champion (1995 and 1997) and once held an American record in the deadlift. He still holds the WDFPF world records in the squat, deadlift and total. 

In weightlifting, Henry was a three-time U.S. National Weightlifting Champion (1993, 1994, 1996), an American Open winner (1992), a two-time U.S. Olympic Festival Champion (1993 and 1994) and a NACAC champion (1996). He held all three Senior US American weightlifting records in 1993–1997.

In strongman, Henry won the inaugural Arnold Strongman Classic in 2002.

Since joining the World Wrestling Federation (now WWE) in 1996, he became a one-time WWF European Champion and a two-time world champion, having held the ECW Championship in 2008, and WWE&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship in 2011. First winning the ECW Championship, he became only the fourth black world champion in WWE history (after The Rock, Booker T, and Bobby Lashley).

In April 2018, Henry was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2018.

==Early life==
Henry was born in the small town of Silsbee in East Texas, 90 miles northeast of Houston. As a child, he was a big wrestling fan and André the Giant was his favorite wrestler. While attending a wrestling show in Beaumont, Texas, young Henry tried to touch André as he was walking down the aisle, but tripped over the barricade. André picked him up out of the crowd and put him back behind the barricade. When Henry was 12 years old, his father, Ernest, died of complications from diabetes. When he was 14 years old, Henry was diagnosed with dyslexia.

Henry comes from a family in which almost all of the men are larger than average, especially his great uncle Chudd, who was 6 ft 7 in, weighed approximately , never had a pair of manufactured shoes, and was known as the strongest man in the Piney Woods of East Texas.

Henry played football in high school until his senior year, when he strained ligaments in his wrist during the first game of the year and scored below 700 on the SAT.

==Powerlifting career==

By the time Mark Henry was in the fourth grade, he was and weighed . His mother bought a set of weights for him when he was ten years old. During Henry&#x27;s freshman year at Silsbee High School, he was already able to squat , which was well over the school record. As an 18-year-old high school senior, Henry was called &quot;the world&#x27;s strongest teenager&quot; by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and made it into the headlines in early 1990 for winning the National High School Powerlifting Championships and setting teenage lifting world records in the squat and total . By the time Henry finished high school, he was a three-time Texas state champion with state and national records in all four powerlifting categories—the squat at , bench press at and deadlift at as well as the total at .

At the Texas High School Powerlifting Championships in April 1990, Terry Todd, a professor of kinesiology at the University of Texas at Austin and former weightlifter, spotted Henry and persuaded him to go to Austin after he graduated to train in the Olympic style of weightlifting. In July 1990 at the USPF Senior National Powerlifting Championships, 19-year-old Henry came second only to the legendary six-time World Powerlifting Champion Kirk Karwoski. While powerlifting relies primarily on brute strength and power, which Henry obviously possessed, Olympic weightlifting is considered more sophisticated, involving more agility, timing, flexibility and technique. There have been few lifters in history who have been able to be successful in both lifting disciplines. Mastering the technique of weightlifting usually takes many years of practice, but Henry broke four national junior records in weightlifting after only eight months of training. In April 1991, he won the United States National Junior Championships; 20 days later he placed fourth at the U.S. Senior National Championships, and finished sixth at the Junior World Weightlifting Championships in Germany two months later. Only a few weeks afterwards, he became 1991&#x27;s International Junior Champion in Powerlifiting as well. In Henry&#x27;s first year in competitive weightlifting, he broke all three junior (20 and under) American records 12 times, and became the United States&#x27; top Superheavyweight, surpassing Mario Martinez.

At the age of 19, Henry had already managed to qualify for the weightlifting competition at the 1992 Summer Olympics, where he finished tenth in the Super- Heavyweight class. Ten months before the 1992 Olympics, Henry had begun training with Dragomir Cioroslan, a bronze medalist at the 1984 Summer Olympics, who said that he had &quot;never seen anyone with Mark&#x27;s raw talent&quot;. After the Olympics, Henry became more determined to focus on weightlifting and began competing all over the world. In late 1992 he took the win at the USA Weightlifting American Open and further proved his dominance on American soil by winning not only the U.S. National Weightlifting Championships, but also the U.S. Olympic Festival Championships in 1993 and 1994. At the 1995 Pan American Games Henry won a gold, silver and bronze medal.

Henry won the ADFPA U.S. National Powerlifting Championships in 1995 with a raw Powerlifting Total. Despite competing without supportive equipment in contrast to the other competitors, Henry managed to outclass the lifter in second place by , defeating not only five-time IPF World Powerlifting Champion and 12 time USAPL National Powerlifting Champion Brad Gillingham, but also America&#x27;s Strongest Man of 1997 Mark Philippi. In the process he set all-time world records in the raw deadlift at and the squat without a squat suit at as well as the all-time drug tested raw total at . Later that same year in October, he competed in the drug-free Powerlifting World Championships and won again, even though he trained on the powerlifts only sparingly—due his main focus still being on the two Olympic lifts. He not only become World Champion by winning the competition but also bettered his previous all-time squat world record to and his all-time drug tested world record total to .

In 1996 Henry became the North America, Central America, Caribbean Islands (NACAC) Champion. He earned the right to compete at the Olympics by winning the U.S. National Weightlifting Championships in the Spring of 1996 for a third time. During his victory Henry became Senior US American record holder (1993–1997) in the Snatch at , Clean and jerk at , and Total at , improving all of his three previous personal bests. No one in the history of the sports had ever lifted as much as him in the five competitive lifts—the snatch and the clean and jerk in weightlifting—the squat, bench press and deadlift in powerlifting.

In the months prior to the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, Henry received more attention and publicity than any lifter in recent United States history. He guested at Jay Leno, Conan O&#x27;Brien and The Oprah Winfrey Show and was featured on HBO Inside Sports and The Today Show. He was also featured in dozens of magazines including U.S. News &amp; World Report, People Vanity Fair, ESPN The Magazine and &quot;Life&quot; where he was photographed nude by famed artist Annie Lebowitz. During this period he connected with WWE owner Vince McMahon for the first time, which led to him signing a 10-year deal as professional wrestler.

Henry improved his lifts to in the snatch and in the clean-and-jerk during his final eight weeks of preparation for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Henry at 6-foot-4-inches tall and bodyweight, became the largest athlete in Olympic history and was voted captain of the Olympic weightlifting team. Unfortunately, he suffered a back injury during the competition and was unable to approach his normal performance level. Due to the injury he had to drop out after his first clean and jerk attempt and finished with a disappointing 14th place. His appearance at the Olympics proved to be his last official competition in Olympic weightlifting, as he retired from weightlifting, vowing never to return unless the sport is &quot;cleaned up&quot; of anabolic steroid use.

Since his career start as a professional wrestler shortly after the Olympics, he broke his leg in the fall of 1996. But by the summer of the following year he had rehabilitated enough to be able to compete at the USAPL National Powerlifting Championships 1997, where he won the competition to become the U.S. National Powerlifting Champion in the Super Heavyweight class again. He had planned to continue heavy training in powerlifting, although his travel schedule as a professional wrestler with the WWF (now WWE) made sustained training difficult. Mark&#x27;s WWF contract was unique in many ways, allowing him at least three months off each year from wrestling, so he could train for the national and world championships in weightlifting or powerlifting. Barring injury, Mark had originally hoped to return to the platform in late 1998, to lift for many more years, and to eventually squat at least without a &quot;squat suit&quot; and to deadlift .

Although in early 1998 he was still able to do five repetitions in the bench press with , three repetitions in the squat with (with no suit and no knee wraps), and three repetitions in the standing press with in training, while traveling with the World Wrestling Federation, he never returned to compete again in official championships in favor of his wrestling career. He weighed at that time, and his right upper arm was measured at 24&quot; by Terry Todd. :When asked in September 2003, who the strongest man in the world was, Bill Kazmaier, considered by many to be the greatest strongman of all time, stated: &quot;It would have to be Mark Henry. [...] I think he&#x27;s one of the strongest men in the history of the world, without a doubt.&quot;

==Professional wrestling career==

=== World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment / WWE (1996–2021)===

====Early career (1996–1997)====
At the age of 24, Henry made his first appearance on World Wrestling Federation (WWF) programming on the March 11, 1996 episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, where he press slammed Jerry Lawler, who was ridiculing Henry while interviewing him in the ring. After Henry competed in the 1996 Summer Olympics, the WWF signed him to a ten-year contract. Trained by professional wrestler Leo Burke, his first feud in the WWF was with Lawler. At the pay-per-view event, SummerSlam in August 1996, Henry came to the aid of Jake Roberts who was suffering indignity at the hands of Lawler. Henry&#x27;s debut wrestling match was against Lawler in a house show at the Baltimore Arena on September 21, 1996. The following day, Henry defeated Lawler in a rematch at In Your House 10: Mind Games. The feud continued at house shows during subsequent weeks. On the November 4 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Henry served as a cornerman for Barry Windham in a match against Goldust. He was set to team with Windham, Marc Mero and Rocky Maivia to take on the team of Lawler, Goldust, Hunter Hearst Helmsley and Crush at Survivor Series, but was replaced by Jake Roberts when he was forced to withdraw from the event due to injury. On the November 17 episode of &quot;WWF Superstars of Wrestling&quot;, Henry defeated Hunter Hearst Helmsley, Crush, and Goldust in a tug of war contest. Henry also worked on several shows for United States Wrestling Association. Henry&#x27;s career was then stalled as he took time off over the next year to heal injuries and engage in further training.

In November 1997, he returned to the ring, making his televised return the following month. By the end of the year, he was a regular fixture on WWF programming, defeating the Brooklyn Brawler on the December 15 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, and beating The Sultan on the December 27 episode of &quot;WWF Shotgun Saturday Night&quot;.

====Nation of Domination (1998) ====
Henry joined the Nation of Domination faction with Faarooq, The Rock, Kama Mustafa, and D&#x27;Lo Brown on January 12, 1998. After The Rock usurped Faarooq&#x27;s position as leader, Henry switched loyalties to The Rock. He also competed at WrestleMania XIV in a tag team Battle Royal with Brown as his partner, but they did not win. After short feuds against Ken Shamrock and Vader, Henry participated in his faction&#x27;s enmity against D-Generation X (DX), which included a romantic storyline with DX member Chyna. 

====Sexual Chocolate (1998–2000) ====
When The Nation disbanded, he engaged in a short feud with The Rock, defeating him at Judgment Day: In Your House with help from Brown, and then forming a permanent team with Brown, gaining Ivory as a manager.

During the next year, Henry gave himself the nickname &quot;Sexual Chocolate&quot;, adopting a character. He first resumed his storyline with former enemy Chyna, but it ended with her betraying him in a controversial angle including a transvestite. During a match at the August 1999 SummerSlam pay-per-view between Brown and Jeff Jarrett for the WWF Intercontinental and WWF European Championships (both held at the time by Brown), Henry turned on Brown and helped Jarrett win the match and the titles. The next night, Henry was awarded the European title by Jarrett in return for his help. Henry lost the title one month later to Brown at the Unforgiven pay-per-view.

The night after he tried to make up with Brown and later in the week claimed to be a sex addict resulting in him attending a sex therapy session a week later where he claimed that he lost his virginity at eight years old to his sister, and had just slept with her two days ago. He was part of a storyline about him overcoming sex addiction, which he accomplished thanks to The Godfather.

After this twist, Henry turned into a fan favorite, and was seen on television romancing WWF veteran wrestler Mae Young as part of the &quot;Sexual Chocolate&quot; character. He feuded with Viscera during this time, as part of a storyline where Viscera splashed Mae Young while she was carrying Henry&#x27;s child. Young later gave birth to a hand.

====Ohio Valley Wrestling and strongman competitions (2000–2002)====
In 2000, Henry was sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) to improve his conditioning and wrestling skills. In OVW, he teamed with Nick Dinsmore to compete in a tournament for the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship in mid-2001. He also worked a couple of matches for Heartland Wrestling Association. Later that year, Henry&#x27;s mother died, causing him to go on hiatus from wrestling. He felt he had to compete in the &quot;Super Bowl of weight lifting&quot;—the Arnold Strongman Classic—in honor of his mother, who gave him his first weight set when he was a child.

Four months prior to the contest, Henry began lifting the heaviest of weights and trained for the first time since 1997 for a major lifting competition. He had never been a professional strongman before, but in the coming contest he was to face the very best of the best of professional strongmen, such as the #1 ranked strongman in the world, and defending World&#x27;s Strongest Man competition winner of 2001 Svend Karlsen, World&#x27;s Strongest Man winner of 2006 Phil Pfister, World Powerlifting Champion of 2001 and equipped deadlift world record holder Andy Bolton, World Muscle Power Champion, Olympic weightlifting Champion Raimonds Bergmanis, and reigning America&#x27;s Strongest Man of 2001 Brian Schoonveld.

On February 22, 2002, in Columbus, Ohio the competition, consisting of four events, designed to determine the lifter with the greatest overall body power, began. Henry surprised everybody when he won the first event, setting a world record in the process by lifting the Apollon&#x27;s Axle three times overhead. Only three men in history had ever been able to press it at all. By deadlifting for two repetitions in the second event and easily pushing a or more Hummer with nearly flat tires in the third event, Henry kept his lead continuously throughout the competition and never gave it up again. In the final &quot;Farmer&#x27;s Walk&quot;-event Henry quickly carried the roughly of railroad ties up an incline, winning the whole competition convincingly to capture the winning prize — a US$75,000 Hummer, a vacation cruise and $10,000 cash.

Since Henry had only trained for four months and defeated the crème-de-là-crème of worldwide strongmen, who had been practicing for years, his win was a shock for strongman experts worldwide, but remained basically unnoticed by the wrestling audience. Henry proved to be worthy of the title &quot;World&#x27;s Strongest Man&quot; not only by winning the contest, but also by achieving it in record time. By doing so he was again seen as the legit &quot;strongest man in the world&quot; by many lifting experts for a second time since 1996.

====Various feuds (2002–2007)====
Henry returned to the WWF in April 2002 and was sent to the SmackDown! brand, where he developed an in-ring persona of performing &quot;tests of strength&quot; while other wrestlers took bets on the tests, but the gimmick met with little success. During this time he competed against such superstars as Chris Jericho and Christian. After being used sporadically on WWE (formerly WWF) television during 2002, as he was training for a weightlifting contest, and suffering a knee injury, Henry was sent back to OVW for more training.

In August 2003, Henry returned to WWE television on the Raw roster as a heel where he found some success as a member of &quot;Thuggin&#x27; And Buggin&#x27; Enterprises&quot;, a group of African Americans led by Theodore Long who worked a race angle in which they felt they were victims of racism and were being held down by the &quot;white man&quot;. During that time, Henry was involved in a brief program with World Heavyweight Champion Goldberg when the former champion, Triple H, put a bounty on Goldberg. This was followed by a brief rivalry with Shawn Michaels, before he engaged in a rivalry with Booker T. After defeating Booker T twice, once in a street fight and once in a six-man tag team match, he lost to Booker T at the Armageddon pay-per-view in December 2003. At a practice session in OVW in February 2004, Henry tore his quadriceps muscle, and was out for over a year after undergoing surgery. Henry was then utilized by WWE as a public relations figure during his recovery, before returning to OVW to finish out 2005.

During the December 30 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Henry made his return to television, as he interfered in a WWE Tag Team Championship match, joining with MNM (Joey Mercury, Johnny Nitro, and Melina), to help them defeat Rey Mysterio and Batista for the championship. A week later on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Henry got in a confrontation with the World Heavyweight Champion, Batista, and went on to interfere in a steel cage match between MNM and the team of Mysterio and Batista, helping MNM to retain their titles. Henry then had another match with Batista at a live event where Batista received a severely torn triceps that required surgery, forcing him to vacate his title. On the January 13, 2006 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Henry was involved in a Battle Royal for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship. He was finally eliminated by Kurt Angle, who won the title.
A week later, Henry received assistance from Daivari, who turned on Angle and announced that he was the manager of Henry. With Daivari at his side, Henry faced Angle for the World Heavyweight Championship at the 2006 Royal Rumble in January, losing when Angle hit him with a chair (without the referee seeing) and pinned him with a roll-up.

On the March 3 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Henry interfered in a World Heavyweight Championship match between Angle and The Undertaker, attacking the latter when he was seconds from possibly winning the title. Henry then performed a diving splash on Undertaker, driving him through the announcer&#x27;s table. Henry was then challenged to a casket match by Undertaker at WrestleMania 22. Henry vowed to defeat The Undertaker and end his undefeated streak at WrestleMania, but The Undertaker defeated him. There were talks about Henry ending the streak backstage, but did not succeed. In an interview on Heavy, Henry stated that the decision was close and that if they did ask him about it he would have refused, stating he did not want to carry that weight. Henry had a rematch against The Undertaker on the April 7 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. It ended in a no-contest when Daivari introduced his debuting client, The Great Khali. Khali went to the ring and attacked The Undertaker, starting a new feud and ending Henry&#x27;s.

During the rest of April and May, Henry gained a pinfall victory over the World Heavyweight Champion, Rey Mysterio in a non-title match. Henry entered the King of the Ring Tournament, and lost to Bobby Lashley in the first round. He later cost Kurt Angle his World Heavyweight Championship opportunity against Mysterio, when he jumped off the top rope and crushed Angle through a table. Henry was then challenged by Angle to face off at Judgment Day, Henry then sent a &quot;message&quot; to Angle by defeating Paul Burchill. At Judgment Day, Henry defeated Angle by countout. Although winning, Angle got his revenge after the match by hitting Henry with a chair and putting him through a table.

Henry later went on what was referred to as a &quot;path of destruction&quot;, causing injuries to numerous superstars. Henry &quot;took out&quot; Chris Benoit and Paul Burchill on this path of destruction, and attacked Rey Mysterio and Chavo Guerrero. These events led up to a feud with the returning Batista, whom Henry had put out of action with a legitimate injury several months beforehand. When Batista returned he and Henry were scheduled to face one another at The Great American Bash in July. Weeks before that event, however, on the July 15, 2006 &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXXIII&quot;, Henry was involved in a six-man tag team match with King Booker and Finlay against Batista, Rey Mysterio, and Bobby Lashley. During the match, Henry was injured, canceling the scheduled match at The Great American Bash, as Henry needed surgery. Doctors later found that Henry completely tore his patella tendon off the bone and split his patella completely in two.

Henry returned on the May 11, 2007 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, after weeks of vignettes hyping his return. He attacked The Undertaker after a World Heavyweight Championship steel cage match with Batista, allowing Edge to take advantage of the situation and use his Money in the Bank contract. Henry then began a short feud with Kane, defeating him in a Lumberjack Match at One Night Stand. Shortly after, Henry made an open challenge to the &quot;SmackDown!&quot; locker room, which nobody ever accepted. In the coming weeks he faced various jobbers and quickly defeated them all. On the August 3 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, he claimed that nobody accepted the open challenge to step into the ring with him because of what he had done to The Undertaker, presenting footage of his assault on The Undertaker. The Undertaker responded over the following weeks, playing various mind games with Henry. Henry finally faced The Undertaker again at Unforgiven in September, losing to him after being given a Last Ride. Two weeks later, Henry lost a rematch to The Undertaker after The Undertaker performed a chokeslam on Henry.

==== ECW Champion (2007–2009)====
After a short hiatus, Henry returned to WWE programming on the October 23 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, attacking Kane, along with The Great Khali and Big Daddy V. Henry then began teaming with Big Daddy V against Kane and CM Punk, and was briefly managed by Big Daddy V&#x27;s manager, Matt Striker. At Armageddon, Henry and Big Daddy V defeated Kane and Punk. Before WrestleMania XXIV aired, Henry participated in a 24-man battle royal to determine the number one contender for the ECW Championship, but failed to win.

As part of the 2008 WWE Supplemental Draft, Henry was drafted to the ECW brand. At Night of Champions, Henry defeated Kane and Big Show in a triple threat match to capture the ECW Championship in his debut match as an ECW superstar. This was his first world championship in WWE, which also made him the fourth African-American world champion in WWE history. Upon winning the title, it was made exclusive to the ECW brand once again. Henry&#x27;s title win came nearly a full decade after he was awarded the European Championship, which was back in 1999 and the only title he held in WWE. A few weeks later, Hall of Famer Tony Atlas returned to WWE to act as Henry&#x27;s manager. Shortly after, ECW General Manager, Theodore Long, unveiled a new, entirely platinum ECW Championship belt design. In August, Henry defended the title against Matt Hardy at SummerSlam after getting himself disqualified; however championships cannot change hands via disqualification, meaning that Henry retained the title. Henry later lost the title to Hardy at September&#x27;s Unforgiven in the Championship Scramble match.

Henry attempted to regain the championship throughout the end of 2008, and had a match against Hardy at No Mercy, but failed as he was unsuccessful. Henry and Atlas then engaged in a feud against Finlay and Hornswoggle, which included Henry losing a Belfast Brawl to Finlay at Armageddon. At the start of 2009, Henry qualified for the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania 25, and was involved in a series of matches with the other competitors on &quot;Raw&quot;, &quot;SmackDown&quot;, and &quot;ECW&quot;. He was unsuccessful at WrestleMania, however, as CM Punk won the match. In May, Henry began a rivalry with Evan Bourne, which began after Bourne defeated Henry by countout on the May 26 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;.

==== Tag team championship pursuits (2009–2011)====

On June 29, Henry was traded to the Raw brand and redebuted for the brand that night as the third opponent in a three-on-one gauntlet match against WWE Champion Randy Orton, which he won, turning Henry into a face in the process. In August 2009, Henry formed a tag team with Montel Vontavious Porter and the two challenged the Unified WWE Tag Team Champions Jeri-Show (Chris Jericho and The Big Show) for the title at Breaking Point, but were unsuccessful. They stopped teaming afterwards, becoming involved in separate storylines, until the February 15, 2010 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; in which they defeated the Unified WWE Tag Team Champions The Big Show and The Miz in a non-title match. The next week they challenged The Big Show and The Miz in a title match but were unsuccessful. At Extreme Rules, Henry and MVP fought for a chance to become number one contenders to the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship, but were the second team eliminated in a gauntlet match by The Big Show and The Miz. Ultimately, The Hart Dynasty (Tyson Kidd and David Hart Smith) won the match.

Henry mentored Lucky Cannon in the second season of &quot;NXT&quot;. Cannon was eliminated on the August 10 episode of &quot;NXT&quot;. In September, Henry began teaming with Evan Bourne, starting at the Night of Champions pay-per-view, where they entered a Tag Team Turmoil for the WWE Tag Team Championship. They made it to the final two before being defeated by Cody Rhodes and Drew McIntyre. The team came to an end in October when Bourne suffered an injury and was taken out of action. Henry then formed a team with Yoshi Tatsu on the November 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, defeating WWE Tag Team Champions Justin Gabriel and Heath Slater, after a distraction by John Cena. They received a shot at the championship the next week, in a fatal four-way elimination tag team match, which also included The Usos and Santino Marella and Vladimir Kozlov. Henry and Tatsu were the first team eliminated in the match.

==== World Heavyweight Champion (2011–2012) ====
On the April 25, 2011 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Henry was drafted to the SmackDown brand as part of the 2011 WWE draft. In the main event of the night, Henry attacked his teammates John Cena and Christian, turning heel in the process. On the May 27 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Henry participated in a Triple Threat match against Sheamus and Christian to decide the number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship, which was won by Sheamus. On the June 17 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Henry was scheduled to face an angry and emotionally unstable Big Show, who warned Henry not to get into the ring; Henry ignored the warning and Big Show assaulted him before the match could begin. This act ignited a feud between the two; Henry attacked Big Show both backstage and during matches while on the July 1 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Big Show&#x27;s music played during Henry&#x27;s match against Randy Orton, causing Henry to be counted out and costing him a shot at the World Heavyweight Championship. Henry reacted by destroying the audio equipment and attacking a technician. Henry faced Big Show in a singles match at Money in the Bank and won. After the match, Henry crushed Big Show&#x27;s leg with a chair, (kayfabe) injuring him, an act Henry later referenced as an induction into the &quot;Hall of Pain&quot;. Henry did the same to Kane on the next episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, and in the months ahead, Vladimir Kozlov and The Great Khali suffered the same fate.
On the July 29 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Henry was informed that he could no longer compete as no one dared to fight him, but Sheamus interrupted, saying that he wasn&#x27;t afraid of Henry before slapping him. At SummerSlam, Henry defeated Sheamus by count-out after slamming him through a ring barricade. On the August 19 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Henry won a 20-man Battle Royal to become the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship to face Randy Orton at Night of Champions, and throughout weeks on &quot;SmackDown&quot; and &quot;Raw&quot;, Henry regularly attacked Orton, getting an advantage over him. At Night of Champions, Henry defeated Orton to win the World Heavyweight Championship for the first time. Henry successfully defended the title against Orton at Hell in a Cell in a Hell in a Cell match.

On the October 7 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Big Show returned and chokeslammed Henry through the announce table, thus earning a title shot against Henry at Vengeance. During the match, Henry superplexed Big Show from the top rope, causing the ring to collapse from the impact and the match to be ruled a no contest. Henry began a feud with the Money in the Bank briefcase holder Daniel Bryan on the November 4 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, challenging Bryan to a non-title match to prove that Bryan could not become champion. During the match, Big Show knocked out Henry, making him win by disqualification. Big Show then urged Bryan to cash in his contract, but Henry recovered and attacked both Bryan and Big Show before the match could start. At Survivor Series, Henry retained the World Heavyweight Championship against Big Show after a low blow that disqualified Henry. Angered by Henry&#x27;s cowardice, Big Show crushed Henry&#x27;s ankle with a steel chair. On the November 25 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Henry was knocked out again by Big Show, at which point Bryan cashed in his briefcase for a title match and quickly pinned Henry. However, SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long revealed that Henry was not medically cleared to compete and voided the match, so Henry remained champion and the briefcase was returned to Bryan. Later that night, Bryan won a fatal-four-way match to face Henry for the World Heavyweight Championship in a steel cage. On the November 29 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Henry defeated Bryan in a steel cage match to retain the World Heavyweight Championship.

Then at , Henry lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Big Show in a chairs match. After the match, Henry knocked Big Show out, resulting in Daniel Bryan cashing in his Money in the Bank contract to win his first World Heavyweight Championship. On the January 20 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Bryan retained the championship against Henry in a lumberjack match after Bryan provoked the lumberjacks to come in and attack them to cause a no contest. At the 2012 Royal Rumble event, Henry faced Bryan and Big Show in a triple threat steel cage match for the World Heavyweight Championship; Bryan escaped the cage to retain the title. On the February 3 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Henry was suspended indefinitely (in storyline) by SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long, after Henry physically accosted Long as he demanded a one-on-one rematch that night with Bryan. In reality, Henry had hyper-extended his knee the previous week. Henry returned to in-ring action on the February 20 episode of &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot;, losing to Sheamus. On the April 2 and 9 episodes of &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot;, Henry faced CM Punk for the WWE Championship which he won by count-out and disqualification; as a result, Punk retained his title. On the April 16 episode of &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot;, Punk defeated Henry in a no-disqualification, no count-out match to retain the WWE Championship. On May 14, Henry announced he was going under a career-threatening surgery for an injury.

==== Final feuds (2013–2017) ====
After a nine-month absence, Henry made his return on the February 4, 2013 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, brutally attacking Daniel Bryan, Rey Mysterio and Sin Cara. Four days later on &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Henry defeated Randy Orton to earn a spot in the number one contenders&#x27; Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship at Elimination Chamber. At the pay-per-view on February 17, Henry eliminated Daniel Bryan and Kane before being eliminated by Randy Orton. After his elimination, Henry attacked the three remaining participants before being escorted out by WWE officials. Henry then began a feud with Ryback after several non-verbal confrontations. On the March 15 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Henry was defeated by Ryback via disqualification, following interference from The Shield. Afterward, Henry delivered the World&#x27;s Strongest Slam to Ryback three times in a row. On April 7 at WrestleMania 29, Henry defeated Ryback in a singles match. Later that month, Henry reignited a feud with Sheamus by repeatedly attacking Sheamus backstage. Henry and Sheamus then challenged each other in tests of strength, but with Sheamus unable to best Henry, he resorted to attacking Henry with &quot;Brogue Kicks&quot;. After Sheamus (during his match) &quot;Brogue Kicked&quot; Henry (who was on commentary), Henry snapped and brutally whipped Sheamus with a belt. This led to a strap match on May 19 at Extreme Rules, where Sheamus emerged victorious. With the loss to Sheamus, Henry declared that he was &quot;going home&quot;.

After being absent from television due to injuries, Henry used social media to tease his retirement. On the June 17 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Henry returned, interrupting WWE Champion John Cena and delivering an emotional retirement speech, which was revealed as a ruse when Henry gave Cena a &quot;World&#x27;s Strongest Slam&quot; after concluding his speech. The segment was highly praised by fans and critics. With Henry stating his intent to challenge for the &quot;only title he&#x27;s never held&quot;, he was granted a WWE Championship match against Cena at Money in the Bank. On July 14 at the pay-per-view, Henry failed in his title challenge against Cena after submitting to the &quot;STF&quot;. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Henry cut a promo to congratulate Cena on his win and asked for a rematch for SummerSlam, but was ultimately attacked by The Shield, turning face in the process for the first time since 2011. Henry continued his face turn the following week, by confronting The Shield and teaming together with The Usos to fend them off. Henry and the Usos went on to lose to The Shield in two six-man tag team matches, the first on the July 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, and the second on the August 7 episode of &quot;Main Event&quot;. On the August 12 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Henry competed in a Battle Royal to determine the number one contender for the United States Championship, but was the last man eliminated by Rob Van Dam.

<doc id="1041578" wikidata="Q1366914" url="?curid=1041578" title="Rabbinic Judaism">
<text>Rabbinic Judaism (), also called Rabbinism, Rabbinicism, or Rabbanite Judaism, has been an orthodox form of Judaism since the 6th century CE, after the codification of the Babylonian Talmud. Rabbinic Judaism has its roots in the Pharisaic school of Second Temple Judaism and is based on the belief that Moses at Mount Sinai received both the Written Torah (&quot;Torah she-be-Khetav&quot;) and the Oral Torah (&quot;Torah she-be-al Peh&quot;) from God. The Oral Torah, transmitted orally, explains the Written Torah. At first, it was forbidden to write down the Oral Torah, but after the destruction of the Second Temple, it was decided to write it down in the form of the Talmud and other rabbinic texts for the sake of preservation.

Rabbinic Judaism contrasts with Sadducee Judaism, Karaite Judaism, and Samaritanism, which do not recognize the Oral Torah as a divine authority nor the rabbinic procedures used to interpret Jewish scripture. Although there are now profound differences among Jewish denominations of Rabbinic Judaism with respect to the binding force of &quot;halakha&quot; (Jewish religious law) and the willingness to challenge preceding interpretations, all identify themselves as coming from the tradition of the Oral Law and the rabbinic method of analysis.

==Background==

===Second Temple Judaism===
====Hellenistic Judaism====

In 332 BCE, the Persians were defeated by Alexander the Great. After his demise, and the division of Alexander&#x27;s empire among his generals, the Seleucid Kingdom was formed. During this time currents of Judaism were influenced by Hellenistic philosophy developed from the 3rd century BCE, notably among the Jewish diaspora in Alexandria, culminating in a Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible known as the Septuagint. An important advocate of the symbiosis of Jewish theology and Hellenistic thought is Philo.

Hellenistic culture had a profound impact on the customs and practices of Jews, both in Judea and in the diaspora. These inroads into Judaism gave rise to Hellenistic Judaism in the Jewish diaspora which sought to establish a Hebraic-Jewish religious tradition within the culture and language of Hellenism.

There was a general deterioration in relations between Hellenized Jews and other Jews, leading the Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes to ban certain Jewish religious rites and traditions. Consequently, the Jews who rejected Hellenism revolted against the Greek ruler leading to the formation of an independent Jewish kingdom, known as the Hasmonean dynasty, which lasted from 165 BCE to 63 BCE. The Hasmonean dynasty eventually disintegrated in a civil war. The people, who did not want to continue to be governed by a Hellenized dynasty, appealed to Rome for intervention, leading to a total Roman conquest and annexation of the country, see Iudaea province.

Nevertheless, the cultural issues remained unresolved. The main issue separating the Hellenistic and other Jews was the application of biblical laws in a Hellenistic (melting pot) culture.

Hellenistic Judaism spread to Ptolemaic Egypt from the 3rd century BCE, and became a notable &quot;religio licita&quot; throughout the Roman Empire, until its decline in the 3rd century concurrent with the rise of Gnosticism and Early Christianity.

The decline of Hellenistic Judaism is obscure. It may be that it was marginalized by, absorbed into or became Early Christianity (see the Gospel according to the Hebrews). The Acts of the Apostles at least report how Paul the Apostle preferredly evangelized communities of proselytes and Godfearers, or circles sympathetic to Judaism: the Apostolic Decree allowing converts to forgo circumcision made Christianity a more attractive option for interested pagans than Judaism. See also Circumcision controversy in early Christianity. The attractiveness of Christianity may, however, have suffered a setback with its being explicitly outlawed in the 80s CE by Domitian as a &quot;Jewish superstition&quot;, while Judaism retained its privileges as long as members paid the &quot;Fiscus Judaicus&quot;. However, from a historical perspective, persecution of Christians seemed only to increase the number of Christian converts, leading eventually to the adoption of Christianity by the Roman emperor Constantine.

On the other hand, mainstream Judaism began to reject Hellenistic currents, outlawing use of the Septuagint (see also the Council of Jamnia). Remaining currents of Hellenistic Judaism may have merged into Gnostic movements in the early centuries CE.

====Hillel and Shammai====

In the later part of the Second Temple period (2nd century BCE), the Second Commonwealth of Judea (Hasmonean Kingdom) was established and religious matters were determined by a pair (&quot;zugot&quot;) which led the Sanhedrin. The Hasmonean Kingdom ended in 37 BCE but it is believed that the &quot;two-man rule of the Sanhedrin&quot; lasted until the early part of the 1st century CE during the period of the Roman province of Judea. The last pair, Hillel and Shammai, was the most influential of the Sanhedrin &quot;zugot&quot;. Both were Pharisees, but the Sadducees were actually the dominant party while the Temple stood. Since the Sadducees did not survive the First Jewish–Roman War, their version of events has perished. In addition, Hillel&#x27;s views have been seen as superior to Shammai&#x27;s by Rabbinic Judaism. The development of an oral tradition of teaching called the &quot;tanna&quot; would be the means by which the faith of Judaism would sustain the fall of the Second Temple.

====Jewish messianism====
Jewish messianism has its root in the apocalyptic literature of the 2nd to 1st centuries BCE, promising a future &quot;anointed&quot; leader or Messiah to resurrect the Israelite &quot;Kingdom of God&quot;, in place of the foreign rulers of the time. This corresponded with the Maccabean Revolt directed against the Seleucids. Following the fall of the Hasmonean kingdom, it was directed against the Roman administration of Iudaea Province, which, according to Josephus, began with the formation of the Zealots during the Census of Quirinius of 6 CE, although full scale open revolt did not occur until the First Jewish–Roman War in 66 CE. Historian H. H. Ben-Sasson has proposed that the &quot;Crisis under Caligula&quot; (37–41) was the &quot;first open break&quot; between Rome and the Jews even though tension already existed during the census in 6 CE and under Sejanus (before 31 CE).

==Emergence of Rabbinic Judaism==
=== Written and Oral Law ===
Rabbinic tradition holds that the details and interpretation of the Torah (Written Law), which are called the Oral Torah or Oral Law, were originally an unwritten tradition based upon the Law given to Moses on Mount Sinai. All the laws in the Written Torah are recorded only as part of a narrative describing God imparting these laws to Moses and commanding him to transmit them to the Jewish nation.

However, as the persecutions of the Jews increased and the details were in danger of being forgotten, these oral laws were recorded by rabbi Judah ha-Nasi (&quot;Judah the Prince&quot;) in the Mishnah, redacted . The Talmud was a compilation of both the Mishnah and the Gemara, rabbinic commentaries redacted over the next three centuries. The Gemara originated in two major centers of Jewish scholarship, Israel and Babylonia. Correspondingly, two bodies of analysis developed, and two works of Talmud were created. The older compilation is called the Jerusalem Talmud. It was compiled sometime during the 4th century in Israel.

Judaism at this time was divided into antagonistic factions. The main camps were the Pharisees, Saducees, and Zealots, but also included other less influential sects. This led to further unrest, and the 1st century BCE and 1st century CE saw a number of charismatic religious leaders, contributing to what would become the Mishnah of Rabbinic Judaism, including Yochanan ben Zakai and Hanina Ben Dosa.

=== Destruction of the Temple ===


Following the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE and the expulsion of the Jews from the Roman province of Judea, Jewish worship stopped being centrally organized around the Temple, prayer took the place of sacrifice, and worship was rebuilt around rabbis who acted as teachers and leaders of individual communities.

The destruction of the Second Temple was a profoundly traumatic experience for the Jews, who were now confronted with difficult and far-reaching questions:
* How to achieve atonement without the Temple?
* How to explain the disastrous outcome of the rebellion?
* How to live in the post-Temple, Romanized world?
* How to connect present and past traditions?

How people answered these questions depended largely on their position prior to the revolt. But the destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans not only put an end to the revolt, it marked the end of an era. Revolutionaries like the Zealots had been crushed by the Romans, and had little credibility (the last Zealots died at Masada in 73). The Sadducees, whose teachings were so closely connected to the Temple cult, disappeared. The Essenes also vanished (or developed into Christians), perhaps because their teachings so diverged from the issues of the times that the destruction of the Second Temple was of no consequence to them; precisely for this reason, they were of little consequence to the vast majority of Jews.

Two organized groups remained: the Early Christians, and Pharisees. Some scholars, such as Daniel Boyarin and Paula Fredricksen, suggest that it was at this time, when Christians and Pharisees were competing for leadership of the Jewish people, that accounts of debates between Jesus and the apostles, debates with Pharisees, and anti-Pharisaic passages, were written and incorporated into the New Testament.

Of all the major Second Temple sects, only the Pharisees remained. Their vision of Jewish law as a means by which ordinary people could engage with the sacred in their daily lives, provided them with a position from which to respond to all four challenges, in a way meaningful to the vast majority of Jews.

Following the destruction of the Temple, Rome governed Judea through a Procurator at Caesarea and a Jewish Patriarch. A former leading Pharisee, Yohanan ben Zakkai, was appointed the first Patriarch (the Hebrew word, Nasi, also means prince, or president), and he reestablished the Sanhedrin at Javneh under Pharisee control. Instead of giving tithes to the priests and sacrificing offerings at the Temple, the rabbis instructed Jews to give money to charities and study in local synagogues, as well as to pay the &quot;Fiscus Iudaicus&quot;.

In 132, the Emperor Hadrian threatened to rebuild Jerusalem as a pagan city dedicated to Jupiter, called Aelia Capitolina. Some of the leading sages of the Sanhedrin supported a rebellion (and, for a short time, an independent state) led by Simon bar Kozeba (also called Simon bar Kokhba, or &quot;son of a star&quot;); some, such as Rabbi Akiva, believed Bar Kokhba to be a messiah. Up until this time, a number of Christians were still part of the Jewish community. However, they did not support or take part in the revolt. Whether because they had no wish to fight, or because they could not support a second messiah in addition to Jesus, or because of their harsh treatment by Bar Kokhba during his brief reign, these Christians also left the Jewish community around this time.

This revolt ended in 135 when Bar Kokhba and his army were defeated. The Romans then barred Jews from Jerusalem, until Constantine allowed Jews to enter for one day each year, during the holiday of Tisha B&#x27;Av.

After the suppression of the revolt the vast majority of Jews were sent into exile; shortly thereafter (around 200), Judah haNasi edited together judgments and traditions into an authoritative code, the Mishnah. This marks the transformation of Pharisaic Judaism into Rabbinic Judaism.

Although the rabbis traced their origins to the Pharisees, Rabbinic Judaism nevertheless involved a radical repudiation of certain elements of Pharisaism, elements that were basic to Second Temple Judaism. The Pharisees had been partisan. Members of different sects argued with one another over the correctness of their respective interpretations. After the destruction of the Second Temple, these sectarian divisions ended. The term &quot;Pharisee&quot; was no longer used, perhaps because it was a term more often used by non-Pharisees, but also because the term was explicitly sectarian. The rabbis claimed leadership over all Jews, and added to the Amidah the &quot;birkat haMinim&quot;, a prayer which in part exclaims, &quot;Praised are You O Lord, who breaks enemies and defeats the arrogant,&quot; and which is understood as a rejection of sectarians and sectarianism. This shift by no means resolved conflicts over the interpretation of the Torah; rather, it relocated debates between sects to debates within Rabbinic Judaism.

The survival of Pharisaic or Rabbinic Judaism is attributed to Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai, the founder of the Yeshiva (religious school) in Yavne. Yavneh replaced Jerusalem as the new seat of a reconstituted Sanhedrin, which reestablished its authority and became a means of reuniting Jewry.

The destruction of the Second Temple brought about a dramatic change in Judaism. Rabbinic Judaism built upon Jewish tradition while adjusting to new realities. Temple ritual was replaced with prayer service in synagogues which built upon practices of Jews in the diaspora dating back to the Babylonian exile.

As the rabbis were required to face two shattering new realities, Judaism without a Temple (to serve as the center of teaching and study) and Judea without autonomy, there was a flurry of legal discourse and the old system of oral scholarship could not be maintained. It is during this period that rabbinic discourse began to be recorded in writing. The theory that the destruction of the Temple and subsequent upheaval led to the committing of Oral Law into writing was first explained in the Epistle of Sherira Gaon and often repeated.

The Oral Law was subsequently codified in the Mishnah and Gemarah, and is interpreted in rabbinic literature detailing subsequent rabbinic decisions and writings. Rabbinic Jewish literature is predicated on the belief that the Written Law cannot be properly understood without recourse to the Oral Law (the Mishnah).

Much rabbinic Jewish literature concerns specifying what behavior is sanctioned by the law; this body of interpretations is called &quot;halakha&quot; (&quot;the way&quot;).

The Talmud contains discussions and opinions regarding details of many oral laws believed to have originally been transmitted to Moses. Some see Exodus 18 and Numbers 11 as a display of Moses&#x27; appointing elders as judges to govern with him and judge disputes, imparting to them details and guidance of how to interpret the laws of God while carrying out their duties. The Oral Torah includes rules intended to prevent violations of the laws of the Torah and Talmud, sometimes referred to as &quot;a fence around the Torah&quot;. For example, the written Torah prohibits certain types of travelling on the Sabbath; consequently, the Oral Torah prohibits walking great distances on the Sabbath to ensure that one does not accidentally engage in a type of travelling prohibited by the written Torah. Similarly, the written Torah prohibits plowing on the Sabbath; the Oral Torah prohibits carrying a stick on the Sabbath to ensure that one does not drag the stick and accidentally engage in prohibited plowing.

== Rabbinic literature ==
As the rabbis were required to face a new reality, that of Judaism without a Temple (to serve as the location for sacrifice and study) and Judea without autonomy, there was a flurry of legal discourse, and the old system of oral scholarship could not be maintained. It is during this period that rabbinic discourse began to be recorded in writing. The theory that the destruction of the Temple and subsequent upheaval led to the committing of Oral Torah into writing was first explained in the Epistle of Sherira Gaon and often repeated.

The Oral Torah was subsequently codified in the Mishnah and Gemara, and is interpreted in rabbinic literature detailing subsequent rabbinic decisions and writings. Rabbinic Jewish literature is predicated on the belief that the Torah cannot be properly understood without recourse to the Oral Torah. It states that many commandments and stipulations contained in the Written Torah would be difficult, if not impossible, to keep without the Oral Torah to define them. For example, the prohibition to do any &quot;creative work&quot; (&quot;melakha&quot;) on the Sabbath, which is given no definition in the Torah, is given a practical meaning in the Oral Torah, which provides definition of what constitutes &quot;melakha&quot;. Numerous examples exist of this general prohibitive language in the Torah (such as, &quot;don&#x27;t steal&quot;, without defining what is considered theft, or ownership and property laws), requiring—according to rabbinic thought—a subsequent definition through the Oral Torah. Thus Rabbinic Judaism claims that almost all directives, both positive and negative, in the Torah are non-specific in nature and require the existence of either an Oral Torah or some other method to explain them.

Much rabbinic Jewish literature concerns specifying what behavior is sanctioned by the law; this body of interpretations is called &quot;halakha&quot; (&quot;the way&quot;).

===Talmud===
Originally, Jewish scholarship was oral. Rabbis expounded and debated the law (the written law expressed in the Hebrew Bible) and discussed the Tanakh without the benefit of written works (other than the biblical books themselves), though some may have made private notes (&quot;&quot;), for example of court decisions. This situation changed drastically, however, mainly as the result of the destruction of the Jewish commonwealth in the year 70 CE and the consequent upheaval of Jewish social and legal norms. As the rabbis were required to face a new reality—mainly Judaism without a Temple (to serve as the center of teaching and study) and Judea without autonomy—there was a flurry of legal discourse and the old system of oral scholarship could not be maintained. It is during this period that rabbinic discourse began to be recorded in writing.

The earliest recorded oral law may have been of the midrashic form, in which halakhic discussion is structured as exegetical commentary on the Pentateuch (Torah). But an alternative form, organized by subject matter instead of by biblical verse, became dominant about the year 200 CE, when Rabbi Judah haNasi redacted the Mishnah ().

The Oral Law was far from monolithic; rather, it varied among various schools. The most famous two were the School of Shammai and the School of Hillel. In general, all valid opinions, even the non-normative ones, were recorded in the Talmud.

The Talmud has two components: the Mishnah (c. 200 CE), the first written compendium of Judaism&#x27;s Oral Law; and the Gemara (c. 500 CE), a discussion of the Mishnah and related Tannaitic writings that often ventures onto other subjects and expounds broadly on the Tanakh.

The rabbis of the Mishnah are known as &quot;Tannaim&quot; (sing. &quot;Tanna&quot; תנא). The rabbis of the Gemara are referred to as &quot;Amoraim&quot; (sing. &quot;Amora&quot; אמורא).

===Mishnah===
The Mishnah does not claim to be the development of new laws, but merely the collection of existing oral laws, traditions and traditional wisdom. The rabbis who contributed to the Mishnah are known as the &quot;Tannaim&quot;, of whom approximately 120 are known. The period during which the Mishnah was assembled spanned about 130 years, and five generations.

Most of the Mishnah is related without attribution (&quot;&quot;). This usually indicates that many sages taught so, or that Judah haNasi who redacted the Mishnah together with his academy/court ruled so. The &quot;halakhic&quot; ruling usually follows that view. Sometimes, however, it appears to be the opinion of a single sage, and the view of the sages collectively (, &quot;hachamim&quot;) is given separately.

The Talmud records a tradition that unattributed statements of the law represent the views of Rabbi Meir (Sanhedrin 86a), which supports the theory (recorded by Rav Sherira Gaon in his famous &quot;Iggeret&quot;) that he was the author of an earlier collection. For this reason, the few passages that actually say &quot;this is the view of Rabbi Meir&quot; represent cases where the author intended to present Rabbi Meir&#x27;s view as a &quot;minority opinion&quot; not representing the accepted law.

Judah haNasi is credited with publishing the Mishnah, although there have been a few edits since his time (for example, those passages that cite him or his grandson, Rabbi Yehuda Nesi&#x27;ah; in addition, the Mishnah at the end of Tractate Sotah refers to the period after Judah haNasi&#x27;s death, which could not have been written by Judah haNasi himself). According to the &quot;Iggeret&quot; of Sherira Gaon, after the tremendous upheaval caused by the destruction of the Temple and the Bar Kokhba revolt, the Oral Torah was in danger of being forgotten. It was for this reason that Judah haNasi chose to redact the Mishnah.

In addition to redacting the Mishnah, Judah haNasi and his court also ruled on which opinions should be followed, although the rulings do not always appear in the text.

As he went through the tractates, the Mishnah was set forth, but throughout his life some parts were updated as new information came to light. Because of the proliferation of earlier versions, it was deemed too hard to retract anything already released, and therefore a second version of certain laws were released. The Talmud refers to these differing versions as &quot;Mishnah Rishonah&quot; (&quot;First Mishnah&quot;) and &quot;Mishnah Acharonah&quot; (&quot;Last Mishnah&quot;). David Zvi Hoffmann suggests that &quot;Mishnah Rishonah&quot; actually refers to texts from earlier sages upon which Judah haNasi based his Mishnah.

One theory is that the present Mishnah was based on an earlier collection by Rabbi Meir. There are also references to the &quot;Mishnah of Rabbi Akiva&quot;, although this may simply mean his teachings in general. It is possible that Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Meir established the divisions and order of subjects in the Mishnah, but this would make them the authors of a school curriculum rather than of a book.

Authorities are divided on whether Judah haNasi recorded the Mishnah in writing or established it as an oral text for memorisation. The most important early account of its composition, the &quot;Iggeret of Rabbi Sherira Gaon&quot; of Sherira Gaon, is ambiguous on the point, although the &quot;Spanish&quot; recension leans to the theory that the Mishnah was written.

===Gemara===

The Gemara is the part of the Talmud that contains rabbinical commentaries and analysis of the Mishnah. In the three centuries following the redaction of the Mishnah by Judah ha-Nasi (c. 200 CE), rabbis throughout Palestine and Babylonia analyzed, debated and discussed that work. These discussions form the Gemara (). &quot;Gemara&quot; means &quot;completion&quot; (from the Hebrew &#x27; : &quot;to complete&quot;) or &quot;learning&quot; (from the Aramaic: &quot;to study&quot;). The Gemara mainly focuses on elucidating and elaborating the opinions of the Tannaim. The rabbis of the Gemara are known as (sing. &#x27; ).

Much of the Gemara consists of legal analysis. The starting point for the analysis is usually a legal statement found in a Mishnah. The statement is then analyzed and compared with other statements used in different approaches to biblical exegesis in rabbinic Judaism (or—simpler—interpretation of text in Torah study) exchanges between two (frequently anonymous and sometimes metaphorical) disputants, termed the &#x27; (questioner) and &#x27; (answerer). Another important function of Gemara is to identify the correct biblical basis for a given law presented in the Mishnah and the logical process connecting one with the other: this activity was known as &quot;talmud&quot; long before the existence of the Talmud as a text.

==Jewish history==

==Orthodox Jewish view==
Orthodox Judaism does not accept the scholarly view that Rabbinic Judaism came into being in the post-Second Temple era. Rather, it sees the Judaism of this period as continuing organically from the religious and cultural heritage of the Israelites, stemming from the Law given to Moses at Sinai onwards. According to this view, while the title &quot;rabbi&quot; was not used earlier, Moses was the first rabbi (and is commonly referred to by Orthodox Jews as &quot;Moses our Rabbi&quot;), with the knowledge and laws received at Sinai being passed down from teachers to students through the era of the Judges, and the prophets (most of whom are seen as the &quot;rabbis&quot; of their time), through the sages of the late Second Temple period, and continuing until today.

<text>Edward Stachura (18 August 1937 – 24 July 1979) was a Polish poet, writer and translator. He rose to prominence in the 1960s, receiving prizes for both poetry and prose. His literary output includes four volumes of poetry, three collections of short stories, two novels, a book of essays, and the final work, &quot;Fabula rasa&quot;, which is difficult to classify. In addition to writing, Stachura translated literature from Spanish and French, most notably works of Jorge Luis Borges, Gaston Miron and Michel Deguy. He also wrote songs, and occasionally performed them. He died by suicide at the age of forty-one.&lt;br&gt; 

==Life and writing ==

=== Childhood and adolescence ===

Edward Stachura was born on 18 August 1937 to a family of Polish emigrants in Charvieu-Chavagneux, department of Isère, in eastern France. He was the second of four children of Stanisław and Jadwiga Stachura (née Stępkowska) who met in France after having emigrated in the early 1920s in search of work.

Stachura spent the first eleven years of his life in France. The family lived in a large tenement house shared by a multilingual mix of emigrants; Stachura would later describe it in his first novel as &quot;this great Tenement of Babel, where apart from the Poles, who called the tune, there was a mass of Greeks, Albanians, Armenians, Italians, Arabs, and other representatives of nations.&quot; Stachura attended a French school and, once a week, the Polish school, a teacher having been provided by the consulate. His brother Ryszard, eight years his senior, says that young Edward was courteous, caring, and likeable, but unusually stubborn: in school he had a habit of correcting his teachers if their ideas were at odds with those he got from other sources.
In 1948 the family moved to Poland and settled down in a one-room thatched house in the village of Łazieniec near Aleksandrów Kujawski, the mother&#x27;s inheritance. Stachura finished grade school in Aleksandrów Kujawski in 1952, completing the program in just three years, even though, according to his mother, his skills in Polish were at first inadequate. He began high school in Ciechocinek. Originally Stachura planned a career in electrical engineering, and he also liked biology and geography, but his interests gradually shifted toward the visual arts and literature. Following conflicts with the school and with his father, Stachura moved to join his brother in Gdynia where he finished high school, graduating in 1956. During that time he published his first poems. After an unsuccessful attempt at enrolling in an arts college, he returned home, working menial jobs, writing poetry, and corresponding with other young writers. He then moved to Toruń, where he attended lectures in the art department at Nicolaus Copernicus University, and participated in the literary movement of the city.

=== College and first book publications ===

Stachura enrolled at the Catholic University of Lublin in 1957, majoring in French Philology. Struggling with difficult financial conditions, he continued writing and actively seeking opportunities to publish his works. He interrupted his studies at CUL twice, and after travelling around the country in 1959 and 1960 he finally transferred to the University of Warsaw, his move to the capital motivated primarily by a desire to facilitate the publication of his work. He continued writing, publishing poetry in periodicals, and he engaged actively in the life of the literary milieu. The year 1962 marked two important events in Stachura&#x27;s life: the first book publication—a collection of short stories titled &quot;Jeden dzień&quot; (&quot;One Day&quot;); and his marriage to Zyta Anna Bartkowska—the future author of novels and short stories published under the pseudonym of Zyta Oryszyn. The following year Stachura published his first book of poetry, &quot;Dużo ognia&quot; (&quot;Lots of Fire&quot;). Despite continuing financial difficulties, he graduated in 1965 with a master&#x27;s degree in Romance Philology; his thesis discussed the work of Henri Michaux.

=== Maturity and critical recognition ===

The years following the graduation saw a flowering of Stachura&#x27;s work. The second collection of short stories, &quot;Falując na wietrze&quot; (&quot;Waving in the Wind&quot;), was published in 1966. The book received the annual Prize of the Polish Publishers&#x27; Association. Around that time, Stachura also began a type of journal in which he collected various notes, many of which he would later incorporate into his works. Two books of poetry followed in 1968: &quot;Przystępuję do ciebie&quot; (&quot;I Come Close to You&quot;) and &quot;Po ogrodzie niech hula szarańcza&quot; (&quot;Let the Locust Hold Sway in the Garden&quot;); the latter received the prestigious Stanisław Piętak Prize. In 1969 Stachura published his first novel, &quot;Cała jaskrawość&quot; (&quot;All the Brightness&quot;), work on the novel having begun three years earlier in the form of notes in Stachura&#x27;s journal. The second novel, &quot;Siekierezada albo zima leśnych ludzi&quot; (&quot;Axing, or the Winter of the Forest Folk&quot;), followed in 1971, and it earned the author Stanisław Piętak Prize for the second time. Like the first novel, the book began with notes in the journal starting in 1967, and it was written partly in Mexico where Stachura studied in 1969 and 1970 on a twelve-month scholarship funded by the Mexican government.
The period during the writing and directly after the completion of the second novel was particularly difficult for Stachura. His marriage disintegrated, throwing him into fits of depression during which he contemplated suicide. After his return from Mexico, Stachura traveled much around Poland, often drinking heavily. In 1971, he visited the Middle East: Damascus and Beirut, and he returned to Poland via Rome and Prague. In January 1972, Stachura lost his &quot;adopted father,&quot; Rafał Urban: a writer and a storyteller; a fascinating, colorful character, twice his age, who died of cancer. In September, Stachura&#x27;s marriage was legally dissolved, and two months later his natural father died, also of cancer. Stanisław Stachura was a formidable character who over the years inspired in his son a wide range of emotions: admiration, fear, hostility, and—eventually—pity. Right after his father&#x27;s funeral, Stachura found himself in a hospital, a victim of an abnormally strong allergic reaction; while there, he wrote letters to all three siblings informing them of his intent to break off all contact with them—the symptom of a tendency that would soon become more pronounced.

=== The final years ===

In 1973 Stachura travelled to Norway, then to Geneva to receive The Kościelski Prize, and from there to France, to visit his birthplace in Charvieu. Next year he spent a few months in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. In 1975 Stachura published &quot;Wszystko jest poezja&quot; (&quot;Everything is Poetry&quot;)—a collection of essays blending impressionistic commentary about everyday events in the author&#x27;s life with philosophical reflections on the nature of the creative process and the relationship between life and literature. The book was followed by the publication of a long poem, &quot;Kropka nad ypsylonem&quot; (&quot;A Dot over Ypsilon&quot;) in the literary monthly &quot;Twórczość&quot;.

In the next few years Stachura showed a gradual deepening of distancing himself from events and people, and of his perception of aversion and hostility in the actions of friends and relatives. This transformation ultimately led to what is described by some as the mystical period in his life and writing, and by others as evidence of progressive mental illness. In 1977 he published &quot;Się&quot;—a collection of short stories employing a peculiar narrative technique (the title is a reflexive pronoun central to that technique), and suggesting, in the last selection, the elimination of corporeality. The book met with mixed reception. In 1978 Stachura published his last volume of poetry, &quot;Missa pagana&quot;. The next book, &quot;Fabula rasa&quot;, was to be his last. Published in 1979, the work continued the direction suggested two years earlier by &quot;Się&quot;—Stachura even insisted (unsuccessfully) on his name on the cover being replaced with the phrase &quot;No-man.&quot; The book led to extremely polarized critical reactions: they ranged from calling it a manifestation of the author&#x27;s mental breakdown (Ziemowit Fedecki) to praising it as one of the greatest works in the world literature (Andrzej Falkiewicz).
Regardless of the assessment of Stachura&#x27;s final work, there is no doubt that he was afflicted during that time with mental disturbances. In April 1979 he suffered a mysterious train accident: he refused to step away from the railroad track along which he was walking, despite the fact that he saw an approaching train. He suffered concussion and lost most of his right hand. After a period of hospitalization in a psychiatric ward (which he requested), Stachura returned to his mother in Aleksandrów Kujawski. He taught himself to write with his left hand and described his experiences before, during, and after the accident in a deeply moving journal, later published under the title &quot;Pogodzić się ze światem&quot; (&quot;To Come to Terms with the World&quot;). He continued writing in the journal until just four days before his death. Stachura took his own life in his Warsaw apartment on 24 July 1979, leaving behind his final poem: &quot;List do pozostałych&quot; (&quot;A Letter to the Remaining&quot;)

The poetry and life of Edward Stachura are central to the story of a Quebec man translating Stachura&#x27;s poetry into French, in the 2012 Canadian feature film &quot;Tout ce que tu possèdes&quot; (&quot;All that you possess&quot;), by Bernard Émond. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2458596/. The screenplay, which includes some of Stachura&#x27;s poems, is published by Lux Éditeur. https://web.archive.org/web/20160304080154/http://www.luxediteur.com/content/tout-ce-que-tu-poss%C3%A8des. .

<text>A prize court is a court (or even a single individual, such as an ambassador or consul) authorized to consider whether prizes have been lawfully captured, typically whether a ship has been lawfully captured or seized in time of war or under the terms of the seizing ship&#x27;s letters of marque and reprisal. A prize court may order the sale or destruction of the seized ship, and the distribution of any proceeds to the captain and crew of the seizing ship. A prize court may also order the return of a seized ship to its owners if the seizure was unlawful, such as if seized from a country which had proclaimed its neutrality.

==History/jurisdiction in various countries==
Prize courts were common in the 17th through 19th centuries, during times of American or European naval warfare. The United States in 1780 established the Federal Court of Appeals in Cases of Capture to hear appeals of prize cases from state prize courts; this court was ended in 1787, after conclusion of the war. Under current U.S. law, pursuant to , the district courts have exclusive jurisdiction in prize cases. Due to changes in the nature of naval warfare, no prize cases have been heard since the statutes were adopted in 1956.

In England and Wales, prize jurisdiction is exercised by the Admiralty Court, part of the King&#x27;s Bench Division of the High Court of Justice (see Prize Courts Act 1894 and Senior Courts Act 1981, ss. 20(1)(d), 27 and 62(2)), and by way of appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.

In France, the prize council () has jurisdiction to determine the issue of the prize. Since 2007, piracy has been transferred to criminal courts. The council&#x27;s jurisdiction is reduced to war time. The way of appeal is open to the President of the French Republic acting as judge.

The International Prize Court was an international court proposed at the beginning of the 20th century, to hear prize cases. An international agreement, the &quot;Convention Relative to the Creation of an International Prize Court&quot;, was established at The Hague on October 18, 1907, but this was never ratified or implemented.

An important factor in the diminishing importance of prize courts was the adoption of the navicert system for managing the British blockades in WWI and WWII.

<doc id="1041588" wikidata="Q1612071" url="?curid=1041588" title="Hadfield, Derbyshire">
<text>Hadfield is a town in the High Peak of Derbyshire, England, with a population at the 2021 Census of 6,763. It lies on the south side of the River Etherow, near to the border with Greater Manchester, at the western edge of the Peak District close to Glossop. It doubled as the fictional town of Royston Vasey in the BBC comedy series &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot;.

==Geography==
Hadfield is in the northwest of England, between Bottoms Reservoir and the Glossop Brook, on the southern side of the River Etherow valley, which is known as Longdendale. The town lies between above sea level. Hadfield is from Manchester.

==History==
Hadfield was part of the Manor of Glossop and, at the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, belonged to William the Conqueror. King Henry I granted the land to William Peveril. In 1157, King Henry II gave it to the Abbey of Basingwerk in North Wales. In 1537, King Henry VIII gave it to the Earl of Shrewsbury, from whom it came to the Howard family (Dukes of Norfolk). While the Howards were responsible in the 1810s for the development of Glossop, it was the Sidebottom family who developed Hadfield. They bought the Waterside and Bridge Mill complex from John Turner and John Thornley in 1820.

For three generations, they developed these mills as a large spinning and weaving combine. They built their own branch railway to the mill and, in 1880, ran 293,000 spindles and 4,800 looms. In 1896, the Sidebottoms went into liquidation. Bridge Mill was destroyed by fire in 1899, but Waterside Mill was bought by John Gartside and Co of Ashton-under-Lyne. Gartside&#x27;s re-equipped the mills with automatic looms from the United States and installed new engines and electric lighting.

During the First World War (1914–18), the mill was taken over by the Greenfield Mill Company but parts of the mill were used to produce munitions. After the war, the company declined. In 1940, the mill was occupied by Maconochie&#x27;s Foodstuffs Ltd, which had been bombed out of its previous premises in London. By 1954, about half of the original building had been demolished and more was to go. In 1976, the site was redeveloped and renamed as the Hadfield Trading Estate.

Station Mill was built in 1834 by Thomas and Edward Platt, members of a family who had farmed Longdendale for generations. The family owned this cotton mill for 68 years, before selling it in 1923 to E. Wilman &amp; Sons, which converted it to silk noil spinning. The mill closed in 1989.

Hadfield Mills were corn mills from before 1819. In 1874, Thomas Rhodes and Sons converted the mills to the manufacture of cotton. A thousand workers were employed there in 1873, but it closed in 1932. In 1940, it was reopened by Hadfield Worsted Mills Ltd for cloth manufacture.

Hadfield and its mills were linked to Glossop via an electric tramway which operated between 1903 and 1927.

==Governance==
Hadfield is administered by High Peak Borough Council at the Town/District/Borough level of Government and by Derbyshire County Council at County level.

Representation on Derbyshire County Council is split between the divisions of Glossop and Charlesworth, and Etherow – with the majority of the town being in the Etherow division. The Etherow division contains Hadfield North, Hadfield South, Gamesley and the large and sparsely populated Tintwistle ward. The Glossop and Charlesworth division contains, amongst others, the Padfield ward (which takes the northern side of Station Road, the main shopping street). These boundaries were set in 2013.

Representation on High Peak Borough Council
Hadfield does not have a parish council.

The Member of Parliament for the High Peak constituency, since 2024, has been Jon Pearce MP who represents the Labour Party. His majority in the 2024 general election was 412 over the Conservative candidate Robert Largan.
==Transport==
Hadfield lies within close proximity of the county boundary with Greater Manchester and some services are provided with this in mind. Though lying within Derbyshire and the East Midlands, some of Hadfield&#x27;s transport facilities are managed by Transport for Greater Manchester.

===Railway===
The town is served by Hadfield and Dinting railway stations, on the Glossop line. Hadfield is the terminus, with most trains running first to Glossop and then reversing back through Dinting towards Manchester Piccadilly. Services are operated by Northern Trains.

The railway, formerly known as the Woodhead Line, used to run through to Penistone and Sheffield, via the Woodhead Tunnel, but passenger services were withdrawn in 1970. Goods trains ran until 1981, when Hadfield became the terminus. The track to the east was lifted subsequently and has now been adopted as part of the Longdendale Trail footpath.

===Roads===
The A57, which links Manchester to Sheffield via the Snake Pass, passes to the south of Hadfield, from Woolley Bridge to Dinting Vale. The A628 road, from Manchester to Barnsley and Sheffield over the Woodhead Pass, runs on the other side of the River Etherow through Hollingworth and Tintwistle. These two roads are major freight routes and are often congested, which has created traffic problems both for Hadfield and the neighbouring towns and villages. The proposed Mottram to Tintwistle by-pass is intended to relieve the congestion.

===Buses===
Bus services in the area are operated by Stagecoach Manchester, High Peak Buses and Stotts Tours. The town is served by three main bus routes:
* 237, which runs twice per hour in each direction towards Glossop and Ashton-under-Lyne
* 341, which runs hourly to both Glossop and Hyde
* 393, which is an hourly circular route linking the town to Padfield, Glossop and Shirebrook Park.

==Media==
Regional TV news comes from Salford-based BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill, and one of the two local relay transmitters (Glossop 
and Mottram In Longdendale).

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Manchester on 95.1 FM and Greatest Hits Radio Midlands (formerly High Peak Radio) on 106.4 FM.

The local newspaper is the &quot;Glossop Advertiser&quot;, owned by &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;.

===Other media===
The popular BBC television comedy series &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot; was filmed in Hadfield, which doubled as the fictional town of Royston Vasey. In the film spin-off from the original series, &quot;The League of Gentlemen&#x27;s Apocalypse&quot;, Hadfield appears as itself when the characters from the TV series enter into the real world through a supposed portal below a church. The statue featured in the series and film&#x27;s opening credits is the war memorial, commemorating lives lost in the First and Second World Wars.

<doc id="1041590" wikidata="Q5111966" url="?curid=1041590" title="Christopher Booker">
<text>Christopher John Penrice Booker (7 October 1937 – 3 July 2019) was an English journalist and author. He was a founder and first editor of the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; in 1961. From 1990 onward he was a columnist for &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;. In 2009, he published &quot;The Real Global Warming Disaster&quot;. He also disputed the link between passive smoking and cancer, and the dangers posed by asbestos. In his &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; section he frequently commented on the UK Family Courts and Social Services.

In collaboration with Richard North, Booker wrote a variety of publications advancing a Eurosceptic, though academically disputed, popular historiography of the European Union. The best-known of these is &quot;The Great Deception&quot;.

==Career==

===Early life===
Booker was educated at Dragon School, Shrewsbury School and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he read History.

===1960s===
With fellow Salopians Richard Ingrams and Willie Rushton he founded &quot;Private Eye&quot; in 1961, and was its first editor. He was ousted by Ingrams in 1963. Returning in 1965, he remained a permanent member of the magazine&#x27;s collaborative joke-writing team thereafter (with Ingrams, Barry Fantoni and current editor Ian Hislop) till his death.

Booker began writing jazz reviews for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; while at university. From 1961 to 1964, he wrote about jazz for &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; as well. His contributions included a positive account of a concert given by the pianist Erroll Garner, which did not happen; it was a late cancellation. In 1962, he became the resident political scriptwriter on the BBC satire show &quot;That Was The Week That Was&quot;, notably contributing sketches on Home Secretary Henry Brooke and Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home which have often been cited as examples of the programme&#x27;s outspoken style.

From 1964 he became a &quot;Spectator&quot; columnist, writing on the press and TV, and in 1969 published &quot;The Neophiliacs: A Study of the Revolution in English Life in the Fifties and Sixties&quot;, a highly critical analysis of the role played by fantasy in the political and social life of those decades. He was married to the novelist Emma Tennant between 1963 and 1968.

===1970s===
He married Christine Verity, his second wife, in 1972. In the early 1970s, Booker campaigned against both the building of tower blocks and the wholesale redevelopment of Britain&#x27;s cities according to the ideology of the modernist movement. In 1973, he published &quot;Goodbye London&quot; (written with Candida Lycett Green), and, with Bennie Gray, was the IPC Campaigning Journalist of the Year. He made a documentary for the BBC in 1979 on modernist architecture, called &quot;City of Towers&quot;. In the mid-1970s he contributed a regular quiz to Melvyn Bragg&#x27;s BBC literary programme &quot;Read All About It&quot;, and he returned to &quot;The Spectator&quot; as a weekly contributor (1976–1981), when he also became a lead book-reviewer for &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;. In 1979, he married Valerie Patrick, his third wife, with whom he had two sons; they lived in Somerset.

===1980s===
In 1980, he published &quot;The Seventies: Portrait Of A Decade&quot;, and covered the Moscow Olympics for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, publishing &quot;The Games War: A Moscow Journal&quot; the following year. Between 1987 and 1990 he wrote &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;″s &quot;The Way of the World&quot; column (a satirical column originated by Michael Wharton) as &quot;Peter Simple II&quot;, and in 1990 swapped places with Auberon Waugh, after mocking Waugh who firmly requested he should write the column instead of Booker, to become a weekly columnist on &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, where he remained until March 2019.

Between 1986 and 1990 he took part in a detailed investigation, chaired by Brigadier Tony Cowgill, of the charges that senior British politicians, including Harold Macmillan, had been guilty of a serious war crime in handing over thousands of Cossack and Yugoslav prisoners to the Communists at the end of the war in 1945. Their report, published in 1990, presented those events in a very different light, and Booker later published a lengthy analysis of the controversy in &quot;A Looking Glass Tragedy&quot; (1997).

===After 1990===
From 1992 he focused more on the role played in British life by bureaucratic regulation and the European Union, forming a professional collaboration with Richard North, and they subsequently co-authored a series of books, including &quot;The Mad Officials: How The Bureaucrats Are Strangling Britain&quot; (1994); &quot;The Castle of Lies&quot; (1996); &quot;The Great Deception&quot; (2003), a critical history of the European Union; and &quot;Scared To Death: From BSE To Global Warming, Why Scares Are Costing Us The Earth &quot; (2007), a study of the part played in Western society in recent decades by the &#x27;scare phenomenon&#x27;.

In 2004, he published &quot;The Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories&quot;, a Jungian-influenced analysis of stories and their psychological meaning, on which he had been working for over 30 years. The book was dismissed by Adam Mars-Jones, who objected to Booker employing his generalisations about conventional plot structures prescriptively: &quot;He sets up criteria for art, and ends up condemning &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;, Wagner, Proust, Joyce, Kafka and Lawrence – the list goes on – while praising &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot;, &quot;ET&quot; and &quot;Terminator 2&quot;&quot;.

Fay Weldon wrote &quot;This is the most extraordinary, exhilarating book. It always seemed to me that &#x27;the story&#x27; was God&#x27;s way of giving meaning to crude creation. Booker now interprets the mind of God, and analyses not just the novel – which will never to me be quite the same again – but puts the narrative of contemporary human affairs into a new perspective. If it took its author a lifetime to write, one can only feel gratitude that he did it&quot;. Roger Scruton described it as a &quot;brilliant summary of story-telling&quot;.

==Views==
Booker&#x27;s weekly columns in &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; covered a wide range of topics of public interest. He has been described by British columnist James Delingpole in &quot;The Spectator&quot; as doing &quot;the kind of proper, old-school things that journalists hardly ever bother with in this new age of aggregation and flip bloggery: he digs, he makes the calls, he reads the small print, he takes up the cause of the little man and campaigns, he speaks truth to power without fear or favour&quot;.

On a range of health issues, Booker put forward a view that the public is being unnecessarily &quot;scared&quot;, as detailed in his book &quot;Scared to Death&quot;. Thus, he argues that asbestos, passive smoking and BSE have not been shown to be dangerous. His articles on global warming have been challenged by George Monbiot of &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

Booker said that white asbestos is &quot;chemically identical to talcum powder&quot; and poses a &quot;non-existent&quot; risk to human health, relying primarily on a 2000 paper for the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). He wrote in January 2002 that &quot;HSE studies, including a paper by John Hodgson and Andrew Darnton in 2000, concluded that the risk from the substance is &quot;virtually zero&quot;. In response, the HSE&#x27;s Director General, Timothy Walker, wrote that Booker&#x27;s articles on asbestos had been &quot;misinformed and do little to increase public understanding of a very important occupational health issue.&quot; The HSE issued further rebuttals to articles written by Booker in both 2005 and in 2006.

In an article in May 2008, Booker again cited the Hodgson and Darnton paper, claiming that &quot;they concluded that the risk of contracting mesothelioma from white asbestos cement was &quot;insignificant&quot;, while that of lung cancer was &quot;zero&quot;&quot;. This article was also criticised by the HSE as &quot;substantially misleading&quot;, as well as by George Monbiot, who argued that Booker misrepresented the authors&#x27; findings. Booker&#x27;s claims were also critically analysed by Richard Wilson in his book &quot;Don&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot; (2008). Wilson highlighted Booker&#x27;s repeated endorsement of the alleged scientific expertise of John Bridle, who in 2004 was convicted under the UK&#x27;s Trade Descriptions Act of making false claims about his qualifications.

===Global warming===
Booker said that the Climate Change Act 2008 was &quot;the most expensive piece of legislation ever put through Parliament&quot;, and likely to cost hundreds of billions over the next 40 years. In May 2009, Booker spoke at an International Conference on Climate Change organised by The Heartland Institute. In the autumn of 2009, he published &quot;The Real Global Warming Disaster&quot;. The book, which became his best-selling work, claims that there is not actually a consensus on climate change, and postulates that the measures taken by governments to combat climate change &quot;will turn out to be one of the most expensive, destructive, and foolish mistakes the human race has ever made&quot;. The book was characterised by Philip Ball in &quot;The Observer&quot; as being as &quot;the definitive climate sceptics&#x27; manual&quot;, in which &quot;he has rounded up just about every criticism ever made of the majority scientific view that global warming, most probably caused by human activity, is under way, and presented them unchallenged&quot;.

Ball said that Booker&#x27;s position required the reader to believe that &quot;1) Most of the world&#x27;s climate scientists, for reasons unspecified, decided to create a myth about human-induced global warming and have managed to twist endless measurements and computer models to fit their case, without the rest of the scientific community noticing. George W Bush and certain oil companies have, however, seen through the deception. 2) Most of the world&#x27;s climate scientists are incompetent and have grossly misinterpreted their data and models, yet their faulty conclusions are not, as you might imagine, a random chaos of assertions, but all point in the same direction.&quot;

In December 2009, Christopher Booker and Richard North had published an article in &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; in which they questioned whether Rajendra Pachauri, chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), was using his position for personal gain, with a follow-up &quot;Telegraph&quot; article in January 2010. On 21 August 2010, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; issued an apology, and withdrew the December article from their website having reportedly paid legal fees running into six figures. Pachauri described the statements against him as &quot;another attempt by the climate sceptics to discredit the IPCC.&quot;

==Family courts==
Booker wrote a number of articles raising concerns about the Family Court system in England and Wales. Booker championed the cause of Victoria Haigh, bringing him into further conflict with the judiciary. Booker also championed the cause of Marie Black, who fled the UK with her partner and daughter in order to evade social services.

==Death==
Booker died on 3 July 2019. On 12 July he was featured in the BBC Radio 4 obituary programme &quot;Last Word.&quot;

<doc id="1041593" wikidata="Q157318" url="?curid=1041593" title="Leszek Kołakowski">
<text>Leszek Kołakowski (; ; 23 October 1927 – 17 July 2009) was a Polish philosopher and historian of ideas. He is best known for his critical analyses of Marxist thought, such as in his three-volume history of Marxist philosophy &quot;Main Currents of Marxism&quot; (1976). In his later work, Kołakowski increasingly focused on religious questions. In his 1986 Jefferson Lecture, he asserted that &quot;we learn history not in order to know how to behave or how to succeed, but to know who we are&quot;.

Due to his criticism of Marxism and of the Communist state system, Kołakowski was effectively exiled from Poland in 1968. He spent most of the remainder of his career at All Souls College, Oxford. Despite being in exile, Kołakowski was a major inspiration for the Solidarity movement that flourished in Poland in the 1980s and helped bring about the collapse of the Soviet Union, leading to his being described by Bronisław Geremek as the &quot;awakener of human hopes&quot;. He was awarded both the MacArthur Fellowship and Erasmus Prize in 1983, the 2003 Kluge Prize, and the 2007 Jerusalem Prize.

== Life and career ==
=== Early life and education ===
Kołakowski was born in Radom, Poland. He could not obtain formal schooling during the German occupation of Poland (1939–1945) in World War II, but he read books and took occasional private lessons, passing his school-leaving examinations as an external student in the underground school system. After the war, he studied philosophy at both University of Łódź and University of Warsaw, the latter of which he completed a doctorate at in 1953, focusing on Spinoza from a Marxist viewpoint. He served as a professor and chair of Warsaw University&#x27;s department of History of Philosophy from 1959 to 1968.

In his youth, Kołakowski became a communist. He signed a denunciation against Władysław Tatarkiewicz. In 1945, he joined the Association of Fighting Youth. From 1947 to 1966, he was a member of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party. His intellectual promise earned him a trip to Moscow in 1950. He broke with Stalinism, becoming a revisionist Marxist advocating a humanist interpretation of Karl Marx. One year after the 1956 Polish October, Kołakowski published a four-part critique of Soviet Marxist dogmas, including historical determinism, in the Polish periodical &quot;&quot; His public lecture at Warsaw University on the tenth anniversary of Polish October led to his expulsion from the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party. In the course of the 1968 Polish political crisis, he lost his job at Warsaw University and was prevented from obtaining any other academic post.

He came to the conclusion that the totalitarian cruelty of Stalinism was not an aberration but a logical end-product of Marxism, whose genealogy he examined in his monumental &quot;Main Currents of Marxism&quot;, his major work, published in 1976 to 1978.

=== Career ===
Kołakowski became increasingly fascinated by the contribution that theological assumptions make to Western culture and, in particular, modern thought. For example, he began his &quot;Main Currents of Marxism&quot; with an analysis of the contribution that various forms of ancient and medieval Platonism made, centuries later, to the Hegelian view of history. In the work, he criticized the laws of dialectical materialism for being fundamentally flawed and found some of them being &quot;truisms with no specific Marxist content&quot;, others &quot;philosophical dogmas that cannot be proved by scientific means&quot; but others being just &quot;nonsense&quot;.

Kołakowski defended the role which freedom of will plays in the human quest for the transcendent. His &quot;Law of the Infinite Cornucopia&quot; asserted a doctrine of &quot;status quaestionis&quot;: for any given doctrine that one wants to believe, there is never a shortage of arguments by which one can support it. Nevertheless, although human fallibility implies that we ought to treat claims to infallibility with scepticism, our pursuit of the higher (such as truth and goodness) is ennobling.

In 1965, Kołakowski, Maria Ossowska and Tadeusz Kotarbiński drew up a report on the meaning of the concept of message, which was used by the defence in the trial of Jacek Kuroń and Karol Modzelewski who were charged by the communist authorities with &quot;propagating false information&quot; in their &quot;Open Letter to the Party&quot;.

In 1968, Kołakowski became a visiting professor in the Department of Philosophy at McGill University in Montreal and in 1969 he moved to the University of California, Berkeley. In 1970, he became a senior research fellow at All Souls College, Oxford. He remained mostly at Oxford, but he spent part of 1974 at Yale University, and from 1981 to 1994, he was a part-time professor at the Committee on Social Thought and in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Chicago.

Although the Polish Communist authorities officially banned his works in Poland, underground copies of them influenced the opinions of the Polish intellectual opposition. His 1971 essay &quot;Theses on Hope and Hopelessness&quot; (full title: &quot;In Stalin&#x27;s Countries: Theses on Hope and Despair&quot;), which suggested that self-organized social groups could gradually expand the spheres of civil society in a totalitarian state, helped to inspire the dissident movements of the 1970s that led to Solidarity and eventually to the collapse of Communist rule in Eastern Europe in 1989. In 1975, he was one of the signatories of the Letter of 59, an open letter signed by Polish intellectuals who protested against the changes of the Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland that were made by the communist party of Poland in 1975. In the 1980s, Kołakowski supported Solidarity by giving interviews, writing and fundraising.

Kołakowski maintained throughout his life and career a view of Marxism that was distinct from that of existing political regimes, and he relentlessly disputed these differences and defended his own interpretation of Marxism. In a famous article entitled &quot;What is Left of Socialism&quot;, he wrote The Bolshevik Revolution in Russia had nothing to do with Marxian prophesies. Its driving force was not a conflict between the industrial working class and capital, but rather was carried out under slogans that had no socialist, let alone Marxist, content: Peace and land for peasants. There is no need to mention that these slogans were to be subsequently turned into their opposite. What in the twentieth century perhaps comes closest to the working class revolution were the events in Poland of 1980-81: the revolutionary movement of industrial workers (very strongly supported by the intelligentsia) against the exploiters, that is to say, the state. And this solitary example of a working class revolution (if even this may be counted) was directed against a socialist state, and carried out under the sign of the cross, with the blessing of the Pope.
=== Reception in Poland ===
In Poland, Kołakowski is regarded as a philosopher and historian of ideas but also as an icon for anti-communism and opponents of communism. Adam Michnik has called Kołakowski &quot;one of the most prominent creators of contemporary Polish culture&quot;. He authored more than 30 books in a career spanning more than five decades. He is also regarded as a great populariser of philosophy. His writings, lectures and TV appearances encouraged people to ask questions, even the most banal ones, and praised the figure of a jester in philosophy – somebody who is &quot;not afraid to challenge even our strongest assumptions and maintains a healthy distance towards everything.&quot; 

=== Death ===
Kołakowski died from multiple organ failure on 17 July 2009, aged 81, at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, England. In an obituary, philosopher Roger Scruton wrote that Kołakowski was a &quot;thinker for our time&quot; and that, regarding Kołakowski&#x27;s debates with intellectual opponents, &quot;even if ... nothing remained of the subversive orthodoxies, nobody felt damaged in their ego or defeated in their life&#x27;s project, by arguments which from any other source would have inspired the greatest indignation&quot;.

== Awards ==
In 1986, the National Endowment for the Humanities selected Kołakowski for the Jefferson Lecture. Kołakowski&#x27;s lecture &quot;The Idolatry of Politics&quot;, was reprinted in his collection of essays &quot;Modernity on Endless Trial&quot;.

In 2003, the Library of Congress named Kołakowski the first winner of the $1 million John W. Kluge Prize for Lifetime Achievement in the Humanities. When announcing the inaugural laureate of the prize, James H. Billington, the Librarian of Congress, emphasized not only Kolakowski’s scholarship but also his &quot;demonstrable importance to major political events in his own time,&quot; adding that “his voice was fundamental for the fate of Poland, and influential in Europe as a whole.&quot;

* Jurzykowski Prize (1969)
* Peace Prize of the German Book Trade (1977)
* Veillon Foundation European Prize for the Essay (1980)

<text>Zbigniew Eugeniusz Religa (; 16 December 1938 – 8 March 2009) was a Polish cardiac surgeon and politician.

== Career as doctor ==
Religa finished his studies at the Medical University of Warsaw in 1963. From 1966 to 1980 he worked in the &quot;Szpital Wolski&quot; in Warsaw, where he qualified in surgery. In 1973, he visited New York City to train in vascular surgery, and in 1975 he trained in cardiac surgery in Detroit. In 1973, he obtained a Ph. D. degree; in 1981 he finished his habilitation, achieving academic recognition similar to an associate professor or senior lecturer. From 1980 to 1984, Religa lectured at the Warsaw Institute of Cardiology. In 1984 he obtained a chair in cardiac surgery and directed the Cardiosurgical Clinic in Zabrze, in 1990 he became full professor at the Silesian Medical University in Katowice, being its rector from 1997 to 1999. In 2001 he returned to Warsaw to become director of both the Clinic of Cardiac Surgery No. 2 and the Institute of Cardiology.

A pioneer in human heart transplantation in Poland, he led the team that performed the first successful heart transplantation in the country, and in June 1995 he was the first surgeon to graft an artificial valve created from materials taken from human corpses. In 2004, a team led by Religa obtained a prestigious &quot;Brussels Eureka&quot; award at the World Exhibition of Innovation, Research and Technology for developing an implantable pump for a pneumatic heart assistance system.

Religa held honorary doctorates from the Medical University of Lviv, the Silesian Medical University in Katowice, and the Medical University of Białystok.

The first successful heart transplant in Poland was performed on 5 November 1985. 
The famous heart transplant (photographed by James Stanfield) was in 1987. The patient was Tadeusz Żytkiewicz, who died in 2017 – 30 years after the operation, outliving the surgeon who gave him a new heart. The surgery lasted for 23 hours. After the surgery, an American photographer, James Stanfield from &quot;National Geographic&quot;, captured the photograph of Religa monitoring his patient&#x27;s vitals on medical equipment with one of his colleagues, Dr. Romuald Cichoń, who assisted him during the surgery, asleep in the corner. According to one of Religa&#x27;s closest associates, Marian Zembala, the photo doesn&#x27;t show Żytkiewicz. They analyzed the photo and surgery plan and established that Żytkiewicz&#x27;s surgery took place two hours later in different operating room. The patient in the photo died during transplantation. However, this has been contested by Religa himself as well as by Katarzyna Ludwiniak, Żytkiewicz&#x27;s granddaughter, who recognizes her grandfather on the photo.

== Career in politics ==

Parallel to his work as a doctor, Religa pursued a career in politics. In 1993, he became a member of the Polish senate and was re-elected in 2001. As the centre and right wing of the Polish political landscape has been in constant flux ever since democracy was reinstated, Religa was a member of several parties and organizations. In 1993, he co-founded the Nonpartisan Bloc for Support of Reforms (BBWR) which gathered behind president Lech Wałęsa and was its leader in 1994. In 1995, Religa became the chairman of the short-lived party &quot;The Republicans&quot; (&quot;Republikanie&quot;) founded by renegade BBWR members who refused to back Wałęsa in the presidential elections of 1995. However, Religa refused to run for president himself, and the Republicans eventually disintegrated when they failed to enter the Sejm in 1997. Spanning the centre and centre-right of Polish politics, Religa was well placed to play a significant role in the newly created Conservative People&#x27;s Party (SKL), which became part of the Solidarity Electoral Action (AWS) in 1997. In 2004, Religa was involved in founding the new Centrum Party and was elected to the position of honorary chairman.

Religa was considered a promising candidate in the 2005 Polish presidential elections. In his campaigning, Religa drove on his reputation and image as a successful physician, in January 2005, polls indicated support of more than 65%; in March 2005, with 17%, polls showed him ranking second behind Lech Kaczyński (19%) however as the elections neared he continued to lose support to professional politicians, ending up with only 6% votes in August. On September 2 in a move that gained him great respect in the Polish society, Religa pulled out of the presidential race urging his remaining supporters to vote for Donald Tusk from the Civic Platform.

Religa was Minister of Health of Poland in cabinets of Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz and Jarosław Kaczyński.

Religa met his wife, Anna Wajszczuk-Religa, when they were in the same study group during their second year in medical school. They got married in 1963 in Siedlce, the bride&#x27;s hometown. They had two children together, Małgorzata (Margaret) and Grzegorz (Gregory).

Religa was a heavy smoker, and died from lung cancer, diagnosed in 2007.

A movie, &quot;Bogowie&quot; (&quot;Gods&quot;), was made about Religa in 2014 by Polish film director, Lukasz Palkowski, where Religa is portrayed by Tomasz Kot.

<doc id="1041603" wikidata="Q570473" url="?curid=1041603" title="McKesson Corporation">
<text>McKesson Corporation is a publicly-traded American company that distributes pharmaceuticals and provides health information technology, medical supplies, and health management tools. The company delivers a third of all pharmaceutical products used or consumed in North America and employs over 80,000 employees. With $308.9 billion in 2024 revenue, it is the ninth-largest company by revenue in the United States and the nation&#x27;s largest health care company. The company is headquartered in Irving, Texas. It is a component of the S&amp;P 500 and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, where it is traded under the ticker symbol &quot;MCK&quot;.

McKesson provides extensive network of infrastructure for the healthcare industry and was an early adopter of technologies, including barcode scanning for distribution, pharmacy robotics, and RFID tags. The company has been named in a federal lawsuit for profiting from the opioid epidemic in the United States.

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, McKesson was a key vaccine distributor, serving as the United States of America Government&#x27;s centralized distributor for hundreds of millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses and ancillary supply kits for over a billion doses across the United States.

==History==
===19th century===
McKesson was founded in 1828 in New York City as Charles M. Olcott by Charles M. Olcott. It was later renamed Olcott, McKesson &amp; Co. and John McKesson in 1833, the business began as an importer and wholesaler of botanical drugs. A third partner, Daniel Robbins, who joined the enterprise as it grew, and who previously &quot;was an assistant to the original partners&quot;, was the &quot;Robbins&quot; when the company was renamed McKesson &amp; Robbins following Olcott&#x27;s death in 1853.

===20th century===

The company successfully emerged from the McKesson and Robbins scandal under CEO Phillip Musica, one of the most notorious business and accounting scandals of the 20th century, a watershed event that led to major changes in American auditing standards and securities regulations after being exposed in 1938.

In 1967, Foremost Dairies, a company founded by James Cash Penney, which was headquartered in San Francisco since 1954, acquired McKesson &amp; Robbins in a hostile takeover to form Foremost-McKesson Inc. The Foremost dairy operations were sold in 1982 and the name changed to &quot;McKesson Corporation&quot; but headquarters remained in San Francisco.

In 1999, McKesson acquired medical information systems firm HBO &amp; Company (HBOC). The combined firm operated as McKessonHBOC for two years. Accounting irregularities at HBOC reduced the company&#x27;s share price by half and resulted in the dismissal and prosecution of many HBOC executives.

===21st century===

In 2001, the company&#x27;s name reverted to McKesson. In the early 21st century, McKesson increased its market in medical technology through acquisitions, including Per Se Technologies and RelayHealth in 2006 and Practice Partner in 2007.

On January 6, 2006, McKesson acquired NDCHealth Corporation.

In 2010, McKesson acquired the oncology and physician services company US Oncology, Inc. for $2.16 billion, which was integrated into the McKesson Specialty Health business.

In April 2012, McKesson agreed to pay the United States $190M to settle allegations that it had inflated prices and overbilled Medicaid. Three months later, in July 2012, McKesson agreed to pay California and 28 other states $151M to settle allegations that it had inflated prices and overbilled Medicaid.

On June 24, 2013, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that McKesson Chairman and CEO John Hammergren&#x27;s pension benefits of $159 million had set a record for &quot;the largest pension on file for a current executive of a public company, and almost certainly the largest ever in corporate America&quot;.

In 2014, McKesson acquired Celesio to become one of the world&#x27;s largest healthcare companies, with over $179 billion in annual revenue.

In June 2016, McKesson announced plans to merge its IT business with Change Healthcare.

In 2017, McKesson was involved in many lawsuits against the state of Arkansas over the supply of vecuronium bromide. McKesson was under contract by Pfizer not to sell to any correctional facility that authorized and carried out capital punishment.

In November 2018, the company announced it would relocate its headquarters from San Francisco to Irving, Texas, effective April 1, 2019.
 Also in April 2019, Brian Tyler took over as CEO of the company.

In February 2020, McKesson Corp announced that it would part ways with Change Healthcare. McKesson gave up its ownership in the company and its three seats on the company&#x27;s board of directors.

====Opioid epidemic====

In 2008, McKesson paid $13 million in fines for failing to report large orders of hydrocodone. In January 2017, McKesson agreed to pay a $150 million civil penalty for alleged similar violations of the Controlled Substances Act regarding the distribution of opioids.

In January 2017, McKesson agreed to pay $150M to settle allegations that it had not done enough to track and stop suspicious opioid sales. The agreement also obligated McKesson to suspend all sales of controlled substances from its distribution centers in Colorado, Florida, Ohio, and Michigan for multiple years.

In May 2020, Attorney General of Oklahoma Michael J. Hunter sued McKesson in Bryan County District Court, alleging that the company&#x27;s actions helped fuel Oklahoma&#x27;s opioid crisis. The suit was filed along with lawsuits against Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen, and the three lawsuits allege that the three companies provided &quot;enough opioids to Bryan County that every adult resident there could have had 144 hydrocodone tablets.&quot;

In January 2022, McKesson, AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health, and Johnson &amp; Johnson agreed to pay $26 billion to settle with all but five of the states suing them. Had the states gone to court, the companies could have faced up to $95 billion in penalties.

====COVID-19 pandemic====
In August 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the CDC and HHS selected McKesson as the U.S. government&#x27;s centralized distributor for COVID-19 vaccine doses and ancillary supply kits under Operation Warp Speed. The company has played a key role in distributing the Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines while also distributing ancillary supply kits for these as well as for the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine across the U.S. (in addition to supporting the U.S. government in efforts to send doses and kits abroad).

==Finances==
For the fiscal year 2023, McKesson reported earnings of US$3.56 billion on revenue of US$276.711 billion. As of 2023, McKesson was the nation&#x27;s largest health care company and the ninth-largest company by total revenue on the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500.

McKesson&#x27;s United Kingdom base was in Warwick with data centers in Newcastle upon Tyne and Brent Cross and offices in Sheffield, Bangor, Glasgow and Vauxhall, London. Across the United Kingdom, it employed over 500 people.

In 2014, McKesson sold most of their healthcare software business to the private equity firm Symphony Technology Group and indicated also that they would not be re-bidding for the Electronic Staff Record contract.

<doc id="1041611" wikidata="Q722036" url="?curid=1041611" title="Sabre (tank)">
<text>Sabre is a variation of the Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked), featuring the turret from a wheeled Fox Armoured Reconnaissance Vehicle mounted on the hull of a tracked FV101 Scorpion.

== Development ==
This UK hybrid vehicle was introduced as a less expensive way of producing a similar vehicle to the 30mm cannon armed FV107 Scimitar tracked reconnaissance vehicle, but with a slightly lower profile turret. It was brought into service in 1995. During initial combat exercises, several flaws were identified. In particular, the vehicle lacked defensive capabilities. As such, modifications were made to the turret of the Sabre to include redesigned smoke grenade launchers and the L94A1 7.62 mm chain gun replacing the standard 7.62 mm FN MAG general-purpose machine gun, for anti-personnel use. An ammunition hopper sits on the side of the machine gun allowing the weapon to be more quickly reloaded than a belt-fed machine gun.

The UK initiated the Tactical Reconnaissance Armoured Combat Equipment Requirement (TRACER) to replace the Sabre and Scimitar. In 1996 the U.S. joined in on the project. In 2001, both the UK and U.S. dropped out of the joint program.

The marriage of the Fox turret and Scorpion chassis was not successful, and Sabre was withdrawn from British Army service in 2004.

==Additional specification==
* Smoke grenade dischargers
* Ammunition:
** 30 mm: 160 rounds Armour-piercing Enhanced Penetration (APEP) and High Explosive (HE)
** 7.62 mm: 3,000 rounds

<doc id="1041632" wikidata="Q902397" url="?curid=1041632" title="Cardinal Health">
<text>Cardinal Health, Inc. is an American multinational health care services company, and the 14th highest revenue generating company in the United States. Headquartered in Dublin, Ohio, the company specializes in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical products, serving more than 100,000 locations. The company also manufactures medical and surgical product, including gloves, surgical apparel, and fluid management products. In addition, it operates one of the largest networks of radiopharmacies in the U.S. Cardinal Health provides medical products to over 75 percent of hospitals in the United States.

== History ==
Founded in 1971 as Cardinal Foods by Robert D. Walter, the company was initially a food wholesaler. After acquiring the Bailey Drug Company in 1979, it began whole selling drugs. The company went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 1983.

In 1988, Walter sold Cardinal Health&#x27;s food operations to Roundy&#x27;s. From 1991 to 1996, the company&#x27;s sales grew from $1.2 billion to $8.9 billion. The company changed its name to Cardinal Health in 1994, and became the third-largest pharmaceutical wholesaler in the United States.

=== 2000–2019 ===
R. Kerry Clark, a former executive and vice chairman at Procter &amp; Gamble, was appointed president and CEO in April 2006, with Robert D. Walter retaining Chairmanship of the board. In September 2008, the company announced Clark and Walter would retire and George S. Barrett would become the chairman and CEO.

In 2009, Cardinal Health completed the spin-off of its clinical and medical products businesses into an independent medical technology company called CareFusion with David Schlotterbeck as CEO. Cardinal Health is now traded on the NYSE under symbol CAH. 

In December 2013, it was announced that Cardinal Health would partner with CVS Caremark to form a generic drug sourcing operation in the United States. The venture was named Red Oak Sourcing and began operations in July 2014.

Between 2014 and 2016, Cardinal, alongside McKesson Corporation, and AmerisourceBergen, spent $13 million lobbying Congress to pass Congressman Tom Marino&#x27;s &quot;Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act&quot;. The bill, which increases the burden of proof enforcers need to show against drug distributors, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in April 2016.

In January 2018, Michael Kaufmann assumed the role of CEO after serving as CFO of the company.

==== Opioid lawsuits ====
In 2019, Cardinal was one of several drug distributors named in lawsuits related to the opioid crisis in the US. In July 2021, Cardinal Health and other pharmaceutical companies agreed to participate in a $26 billion settlement. Cardinal will pay $6.4 billion over 18 years.

In May 2020, Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter sued Cardinal Health in Bryan County District Court, Oklahoma. The lawsuit alleged that he company&#x27;s actions helped fuel Oklahoma&#x27;s opioid crisis. The suit was filed along with lawsuits against AmerisourceBergen and McKesson, and the three lawsuits allege that the three companies provided &quot;enough opioids to Bryan County that every adult resident there could have had 144 hydrocodone tablets.&quot;

=== 2020–present ===
As of August 2021, it is ranked 14 on the Fortune 500 list with FY2020 annual revenue of $152.9 billion. The firm employs 48,000 people worldwide.

==== Acquisitions ====
In 1995, Medicine Shoppe International, the country&#x27;s largest franchiser of retail pharmacies, was acquired. The merger represented the first non-distribution acquisition by Cardinal Health.

In 1996, Cardinal Health acquired Pyxis Corporation, a company that developed automated pill dispensers for hospitals, for $867 million.

In 1997, Cardinal Health planned to purchase Bergen Brunswig Corp., to which McKesson Corporation responded with a bid to purchase Amerisource. Instead, Amerisource and Bergen merged into AmerisourceBergen. Later that year, Cardinal Health completed the acquisition of Owen Healthcare, the second-largest provider of pharmacy management services in the U.S. at the time.

In 1999, the firm acquired the Chicago-based medical products manufacturer and distributor, Allegiance Healthcare (formerly a division of Baxter Healthcare). In 2001, the company acquired Bindley Western Industries, a wholesale distributor of pharmaceuticals based in Indianapolis.

In April 2006, Cardinal Health purchased Niagara Falls-based ParMed Pharmaceuticals for $40.1 million. In June 2007, the firm announced the completion of a tender offer for VIASYS Healthcare.

In June 2010, Cardinal Health announced plans to purchase Healthcare Solutions Holding, a specialty pharmaceutical services company, for $517 million. In December 2010, the company acquired Kinray, an independent pharmaceutical wholesaler, increasing Cardinal Health&#x27;s presence in the independent pharmacy market by 40 percent. From 2010 to 2014, Cardinal Health acquired 18 companies including Yong Yu, a Chinese drug distributor. Cardinal sold Yong Yu in 2017 to Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co. Ltd. for $1.2 billion. 

In July 2014, Cardinal Health and CVS formed Red Oak Sourcing, the largest generic drug sourcing operation in the United States. The companies started buying generic drugs around the world to sell in U.S. markets.

In March 2015, Cardinal Health signed an agreement to acquire Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s Cordis (medical) division, a cardiology and endovascular device manufacturer, for $1.94 billion. The acquisition was completed on October 4, 2015. Cardinal sold the division in August 2021 to Hellman &amp; Friedman, a private equity firm, for $1 billion.

In April 2017, Cardinal Health announced the plan to acquire the patient product portfolio from Medtronic for $6.1 billion. The acquisition was completed on July 30, 2017.

== Controversy ==

=== Role in the Opioid epidemic ===
Multiple legal settlements have demonstrated Cardinale Health&#x27;s role in the US Opioid epidemic, though the company never admitted wrongdoing:

* December 2016: Cardinal Health settled for $44 million for violations of the Controlled Substances Act brought in allegations from United States Attorneys in districts from Maryland, New York, Florida and Washington.
* July 2021: Cardinal Health agreed to pay $6.4 billion to settle thousands of US lawsuits. They were one of four companies to pay $26 billion, including Johnson &amp; Johnson, AmerisourceBergen and McKesson.
* May 2022: Settled a derivative suit on behalf of shareholders for $124 million.
* August 2024: Settlement with various health plans including insurers and third-party payers for $92.7 million.
* August 2024: Settlement with the City of Baltimore for $152.5 million.

=== Restatements ===
In September 2004, Cardinal Health announced plans to restate past results for fiscal 2001, 2002, 2003, and the first three quarters of 2004 downward, after an accounting review and an ongoing federal investigation. In 2005, in connection with the Audit Committee&#x27;s conclusions reached in September and October 2004, the company made certain reclassification and restatement adjustments to its fiscal 2004 and prior historical consolidated financial statements. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Analysts called the restatement decision troubling, yet limited in scope.&quot;

===FDA action===
In August 2006, Cardinal Health ceased production of its Alaris SE infusion pump after approximately 1300 units were seized by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In February 2007, Cardinal Health signed a consent decree with the FDA which promised procedures to guarantee the safety of the Alaris SE. After FDA inspections, Cardinal Health entered into a further consent agreement with the FDA in 2009.

=== DEA investigation into Oxycodone diversion ===
In 2008, Cardinal Health agreed to pay $34 million in civil penalties to settle DEA allegations that it failed to report suspicious orders of hydrocodone. The fine followed a 10-month DEA suspension of a Lakeland, Florida distribution facility and two others in New Jersey and Washington. On February 2, 2012, the Drug Enforcement Administration again suspended the license of the firm&#x27;s Lakeland distribution center to distribute controlled substances on charges that it had allowed four Florida pharmacies to purchase excessive amounts of controlled substances, in particular oxycodone.

Cardinal Health obtained a restraining order against the suspension, but the suspension was upheld on February 29 by a Federal district court because the court agreed with the DEA that Cardinal Health&#x27;s activities represented an &quot;imminent danger to the public.&quot; The company stated that it blocked two of the pharmacies, (Brooks Pharmacy in Bonita Springs, Florida, and Gulf Coast Medical in Panama City, Florida), and notified the corporate owners of the two pharmacies that were part of national chains, two CVS stores in Sanford, Florida.

In February 2012, Joseph Rannazzisi, chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s Office of Diversion Control, issued immediate suspension orders against Cardinal&#x27;s supply of oxycodone to suspected pill mills. These orders were filed after Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole met with Rannazzisi to ask if he had met with Cardinal about the investigation. Cole stated that he believed “it made good sense to listen to what Cardinal had to say” regarding the investigation. That year, Cardinal and the DEA reached a settlement that suspended Cardinal&#x27;s facility in Lakeland, Florida from selling pain killers or other drugs for two years. In 2016, Cardinal was fined $44 million for after the investigation concluded.

In January 2022, Cardinal Health, Johnson &amp; Johnson, McKesson, and AmerisourceBergen agreed to pay $26 billion to settle with all but five of the states suing them. Had the states gone to court, the companies could have faced up to $95 billion in penalties.

== Finances ==
Annual financial statistics are displayed below:
== Cardinal Health Foundation ==
The Cardinal Health Foundation is the charitable arm of Cardinal Health. The company makes annual product donations of over $9 million through international relief organizations and provides up to $1,000 in matching funds for every Cardinal Health employee that makes a charitable donation. In 2008, the foundation established its E3 Grant Program. Over the past seven years, the Foundation has invested more than $7.15 million in funding to 241 hospitals, health systems or other health-related organizations.

Cardinal Health also supports organizations such as Ronald McDonald House Charities, and was named Benefactor of the Year at the 2011 Corporate Caring Awards. In 2015, the foundation contributed $3 million to the Solutions for Patient Safety project, which has raised over $11 million nationally for efforts to improve safety initiatives in children&#x27;s hospitals.

<text>Byron York (born December 5, 1955) is an American conservative correspondent, pundit, columnist, and author.

== Education ==

York holds a B.A. from the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa and an M.A. from the University of Chicago.

== Career ==

York joined &quot;The Washington Examiner&quot; as chief political correspondent in 2009. He was previously a White House correspondent for &quot;National Review&quot;. He is also a syndicated columnist. Before working for &quot;National Review&quot;, York was a news producer at CNN Headline News and an investigative reporter for &quot;The American Spectator&quot;.

He has also written for &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, &quot;The Hill&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;, and the &quot;New York Post&quot;. He has appeared on such programs as &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, &quot;The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer&quot;, &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;, &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, &quot;Special Report&quot;, &quot;The Laura Ingraham Show&quot;, and &quot;Hardball with Chris Matthews&quot;, and has contributed occasional commentaries to National Public Radio. For a brief period in 2005 he was a contributing blogger at &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;. He has taken part in discussions with other media personalities at BloggingHeads.tv.

=== Political positions ===
In 2001, York criticized President Bill Clinton&#x27;s pardon of Susan McDougal, who had served three months in prison for Contempt of court related to her involvement in the Whitewater scandal.

In 2005, York posited a plot by the Democratic Party to &quot;take down&quot; President George W. Bush in his book &quot;The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy&quot;.

In 2007, York called on President Bush to give a full pardon to Scooter Libby, who was sentenced to prison for obstruction of justice, perjury and making false statements in the Plame affair.

In 2010, York wrote an op-ed titled &quot;Obama has himself to blame for Muslim problem&quot;, which argued that President Obama was to blame for the widespread misconception that he was Muslim. York wrote that Obama had written about his Muslim grandfather and noted that members of his extended family were Muslim. York said that the Obama campaign had &quot;shouted down even a measured discussion of the topic&quot;, and &quot;to the outside observer, Obama sometimes doesn’t appear to practice any faith at all. Put it all together, and is it any wonder the public is confused?&quot;

According to the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, York has &quot;[led] the inquiries into the alleged deep-state conspiracy against Trump&quot;. According to &quot;Slate&quot;, York has &quot;[spread] conspiracy theories about the FBI.&quot; York suggested that Special Counsel Robert Mueller&#x27;s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election could be compromised because of an alleged friendship to former FBI Director James Comey, whom President Trump fired. York supported Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham&#x27;s recommendation of criminal charges against Christopher Steele, one of the people who sought to expose Russian interference in the 2016 election. They alleged that Steele had lied to federal authorities. However, federal authorities have not filed charges against him for lying. In July 2018, when Maria Butina, an accused Russian spy who had sought to involve herself in the National Rifle Association of America (NRA) and the Republican Party, was arrested, York downplayed the charges.

In February 2019, York argued that the attempt by the new Democratic majority in the House of Representatives to compel the release of President Trump&#x27;s tax returns amounted to the &quot;ultimate fishing expedition&quot;.

In 2020, during the George Floyd protests against racism and police brutality, York criticized a statement by former President George W. Bush which said it was &quot;time for America to examine our tragic failures.&quot; York said it was &quot;remarkable&quot; that Bush &quot;almost completely ignored riots, violence.&quot;

Shortly before the 2020 presidential election, York wrote a piece in the &quot;Washington Examiner&quot; analyzing a findings simulation that claimed Joe Biden wouldn&#x27;t concede the election if he lost, and claiming that Biden would pressure Democratic governors to reject Trump&#x27;s victory in their states and that House Democrats would refuse to acknowledge Trump&#x27;s victory. He also asserted that Trump would concede if he lost. In the event, essentially that very scenario played out, but with the roles reversed. There is no record of York acknowledging the reversal.

On January 14, 2025 York published a column accusing Special Counsel Jack Smith of rushing the judicial process around his investigation of Donald Trump for crimes associated with the January 6th Capitol riot for the political purpose of interfering with the 2024 presidential election and concealing his intentions. The column failed to note an alternative explanation, that Smith’s actions were motivated by the &quot;sui generis&quot; nature of a criminal case in which, were Trump to be elected President before the case went to trial, the target of his investigation was the only individual indicted by a grand jury who would be empowered to unilaterally terminate prosecution, thus denying the criminal justice system of the opportunity to present evidence of criminality before a jury. Smith’s comments about his investigation, as recounted in York’s column, fit equally well with either interpretation.

==Family and personal life==
He is the son of Tom York, a longtime television personality from Birmingham, Alabama, and Helen Hamilton (b. 1929). His nephew is Washington Examiner&#x27;s Life and Arts editor, Park MacDougald. He is married, and plays guitar and mandolin.

<doc id="1041636" wikidata="Q63312" url="?curid=1041636" title="Karl Mauch">
<text>Karl Gottlieb Mauch (7 May 1837 – 4 April 1875) was a German explorer and geographer of Africa. He reported on the archaeological ruins of Great Zimbabwe in 1871 during his search for the biblical land of Ophir.

==Exploration and Great Zimbabwe==

In 1871, Mauch arrived at the stone ruins now known as Great Zimbabwe, five years after discovering the first gold mines in the Transvaal. Mauch believed that the ruins were the remnants of the lost biblical city of Ophir, described as the origin of the gold given by the Queen of Sheba to King Solomon. He did not believe that the structures could have been built by a previous local population similar to those which inhabited the area at the time of his excavation. Further research on the site, including one of the first archaeological uses of aviation, resulted in the conclusion that the structures had indeed been of African origin. 

The Great Zimbabwe site is now considered to have been built by ancestors of the Shona people between the 11th and the 15th centuries CE.

Mauch died as a result of a fall from the third floor window of a hotel in which he was living. It is uncertain whether the death was accidental or self-inflicted.

==In media and popular culture==
&quot;The Real King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; was the fifth episode of World Media Rights&#x27; docudrama series &quot;Raiders of the Lost Past&quot;, and emphasized the life of Mauch and his quest to discover the fabled mines. The episode was first transmitted in the UK via the Yesterday channel on 23 November 2012, was directed by Gerry Pomeroy, narrated by Jonny Phillips and featured Ross Owen Williams as Karl Mauch. During the week of its first transmission, the Sunday Times Culture Magazine recommended the episode as a selection of the week. In North America, the episode was included as part of the television history series &quot;Myth Hunters&quot;.

<doc id="1041640" wikidata="Q970945" url="?curid=1041640" title="Henryk Dembiński">
<text>Henryk Dembiński (; 16 January 1791 – 13 July 1864) was a Polish engineer, traveler and general.

Dembiński was born in Strzałków, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship. In 1809 he entered the Polish army of the Duchy of Warsaw and took part in most of the Napoleonic campaigns in the East. Among others, he took part in the Battle of Leipzig in 1813. After the fall of Napoleon Bonaparte he remained in Poland and became one of the members of the Sejm of the Congress Poland. 
In the Polish November Uprising of 1830, he was a successful leader of the Polish forces. In 1831, after his victorious campaign in Lithuania, he was promoted to generał dywizji and for a brief period became the Polish Commander-in-Chief. He took part in the battles of Dębe Wielkie and Ostrołęka.

After the fall of the revolution in 1833 he emigrated to France, where he became one of the prominent politicians of the Hôtel Lambert, a group of supporters of Adam Jerzy Czartoryski.

In the Hungarian revolution of 1848 he was appointed the commanding officer of the Northern Army. After his successes he was soon promoted and Lajos Kossuth appointed him the Hungarian commander-in-chief. He was hampered by the jealousy of Artúr Görgey and after the defeat at the Battle of Kápolna, he resigned. After the Battle of Temesvár (where he was commander until the arrival of Józef Bem) and Kossuth&#x27;s resignation, he fled to Turkey, where he (together with many other prominent Polish officers) entered the service of sultan Mahmud II. However, in 1850 he returned to Paris, where he died.

<doc id="1041641" wikidata="Q3026015" url="?curid=1041641" title="Radiation hardening">
<text>Radiation hardening is the process of making electronic components and circuits resistant to damage or malfunction caused by high levels of ionizing radiation (particle radiation and high-energy electromagnetic radiation), especially for environments in outer space (especially beyond low Earth orbit), around nuclear reactors and particle accelerators, or during nuclear accidents or nuclear warfare.

Most semiconductor electronic components are susceptible to radiation damage, and radiation-hardened (rad-hard) components are based on their non-hardened equivalents, with some design and manufacturing variations that reduce the susceptibility to radiation damage. Due to the low demand and the extensive development and testing required to produce a radiation-tolerant design of a microelectronic chip, the technology of radiation-hardened chips tends to lag behind the most recent developments. They also typically cost more than their commercial counterparts.

Radiation-hardened products are typically tested to one or more resultant-effects tests, including total ionizing dose (TID), enhanced low dose rate effects (ELDRS), neutron and proton displacement damage, and single event effects (SEEs).

==Problems caused by radiation==
Environments with high levels of ionizing radiation create special design challenges. A single charged particle can knock thousands of electrons loose, causing electronic noise and signal spikes. In the case of digital circuits, this can cause results which are inaccurate or unintelligible. This is a particularly serious problem in the design of satellites, spacecraft, future quantum computers, military aircraft, nuclear power stations, and nuclear weapons. In order to ensure the proper operation of such systems, manufacturers of integrated circuits and sensors intended for the military or aerospace markets employ various methods of radiation hardening. The resulting systems are said to be rad(iation)-hardened, rad-hard, or (within context) hardened.

==Major radiation damage sources==
Typical sources of exposure of electronics to ionizing radiation are the Van Allen radiation belts for satellites, nuclear reactors in power plants for sensors and control circuits, particle accelerators for control electronics (particularly particle detector devices), residual radiation from isotopes in chip packaging materials, cosmic radiation for spacecraft and high-altitude aircraft, and nuclear explosions for potentially all military and civilian electronics.

Secondary particles result from interaction of other kinds of radiation with structures around the electronic devices.

* Van Allen radiation belts contain electrons (up to about 10 MeV) and protons (up to 100s MeV) trapped in the geomagnetic field. The particle flux in the regions farther from the Earth can vary wildly depending on the actual conditions of the Sun and the magnetosphere. Due to their position they pose a concern for satellites.
* Nuclear reactors produce gamma radiation and neutron radiation which can affect sensor and control circuits in nuclear power plants.
* Particle accelerators produce high energy protons and electrons, and the secondary particles produced by their interactions produce significant radiation damage on sensitive control and particle detector components, of the order of magnitude of 10 MRad[Si]/year for systems such as the Large Hadron Collider.
* Chip packaging materials were an insidious source of radiation that was found to be causing soft errors in new DRAM chips in the 1970s. Traces of radioactive elements in the packaging of the chips were producing alpha particles, which were then occasionally discharging some of the capacitors used to store the DRAM data bits. These effects have been reduced today by using purer packaging materials, and employing error-correcting codes to detect and often correct DRAM errors.
* Cosmic rays come from all directions and consist of approximately 85% protons, 14% alpha particles, and 1% heavy ions, together with X-ray and gamma-ray radiation. Most effects are caused by particles with energies between 0.1 and 20 GeV. The atmosphere filters most of these, so they are primarily a concern for spacecraft and high-altitude aircraft, but can also affect ordinary computers on the surface.
* Solar particle events come from the direction of the sun and consist of a large flux of high-energy (several GeV) protons and heavy ions, again accompanied by X-ray radiation.
* Nuclear explosions produce a short and extremely intense surge through a wide spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, an electromagnetic pulse (EMP), neutron radiation, and a flux of both primary and secondary charged particles. In case of a nuclear war they pose a potential concern for all civilian and military electronics.

==Radiation effects on electronics==


===Fundamental mechanisms===
Two fundamental damage mechanisms take place:

====Lattice displacement====
Lattice displacement is caused by neutrons, protons, alpha particles, heavy ions, and very high energy gamma photons. They change the arrangement of the atoms in the crystal lattice, creating lasting damage, and increasing the number of recombination centers, depleting the minority carriers and worsening the analog properties of the affected semiconductor junctions. Counterintuitively, higher doses over a short time cause partial annealing (&quot;healing&quot;) of the damaged lattice, leading to a lower degree of damage than with the same doses delivered in low intensity over a long time (LDR or Low Dose Rate). This type of problem is particularly significant in bipolar transistors, which are dependent on minority carriers in their base regions; increased losses caused by recombination cause loss of the transistor gain (see &quot;neutron effects&quot;). Components certified as ELDRS (Enhanced Low Dose Rate Sensitive)-free do not show damage with fluxes below 0.01 rad(Si)/s = 36 rad(Si)/h.

====Ionization effects====
Ionization effects are caused by charged particles, including ones with energy too low to cause lattice effects. The ionization effects are usually transient, creating glitches and soft errors, but can lead to destruction of the device if they trigger other damage mechanisms (e.g., a latchup). Photocurrent caused by ultraviolet and X-ray radiation may belong to this category as well. Gradual accumulation of holes in the oxide layer in MOSFET transistors leads to worsening of their performance, up to device failure when the dose is high enough (see &quot;total ionizing dose effects&quot;).

The effects can vary wildly depending on all the parameters – type of radiation, total dose and radiation flux, combination of types of radiation, and even the kind of device load (operating frequency, operating voltage, actual state of the transistor during the instant it is struck by the particle) – which makes thorough testing difficult, time-consuming, and requiring many test samples.

===Resultant effects===
The &quot;end-user&quot; effects can be characterized in several groups:
A neutron interacting with a semiconductor lattice will displace the atoms in the lattice. This leads to an increase in the count of recombination centers and deep-level defects, reducing the lifetime of minority carriers, thus affecting bipolar devices more than CMOS ones. Bipolar devices on silicon tend to show changes in electrical parameters at levels of 1010 to 1011 neutrons/cm2, while CMOS devices aren&#x27;t affected until 1015 neutrons/cm2. The sensitivity of devices may increase together with increasing level of integration and decreasing size of individual structures. There is also a risk of induced radioactivity caused by neutron activation, which is a major source of noise in high energy astrophysics instruments. Induced radiation, together with residual radiation from impurities in component materials, can cause all sorts of single-event problems during the device&#x27;s lifetime. GaAs LEDs, common in optocouplers, are very sensitive to neutrons. The lattice damage influences the frequency of crystal oscillators. Kinetic energy effects (namely lattice displacement) of charged particles belong here too.

====Total ionizing dose effects====
Total ionizing dose effects represent the cumulative damage of the semiconductor lattice (&quot;lattice displacement&quot; damage) caused by exposure to ionizing radiation over time. It is measured in rads and causes slow gradual degradation of the device&#x27;s performance. A total dose greater than 5000 rads delivered to silicon-based devices in a timespan on the order of seconds to minutes will cause long-term degradation. In CMOS devices, the radiation creates electron–hole pairs in the gate insulation layers, which cause photocurrents during their recombination, and the holes trapped in the lattice defects in the insulator create a persistent gate biasing and influence the transistors&#x27; threshold voltage, making the N-type MOSFET transistors easier and the P-type ones more difficult to switch on. The accumulated charge can be high enough to keep the transistors permanently open (or closed), leading to device failure. Some self-healing takes place over time, but this effect is not too significant. This effect is the same as hot carrier degradation in high-integration high-speed electronics. Crystal oscillators are somewhat sensitive to radiation doses, which alter their frequency. The sensitivity can be greatly reduced by using swept quartz. Natural quartz crystals are especially sensitive. Radiation performance curves for TID testing may be generated for all resultant effects testing procedures. These curves show performance trends throughout the TID test process and are included in the radiation test report.

====Transient dose effects====
Transient dose effects result from a brief high-intensity pulse of radiation, typically occurring during a nuclear explosion. The high radiation flux creates photocurrents in the entire body of the semiconductor, causing transistors to randomly open, changing logical states of flip-flops and memory cells. Permanent damage may occur if the duration of the pulse is too long, or if the pulse causes junction damage or a latchup. Latchups are commonly caused by the X-rays and gamma radiation flash of a nuclear explosion. Crystal oscillators may stop oscillating for the duration of the flash due to prompt photoconductivity induced in quartz.

====Systems-generated EMP effects====
SGEMP effects are caused by the radiation flash traveling through the equipment and causing local ionization and electric currents in the material of the chips, circuit boards, electrical cables and cases.

===Digital damage: SEE===
Single-event effects (SEE) have been studied extensively since the 1970s. When a high-energy particle travels through a semiconductor, it leaves an ionized track behind. This ionization may cause a highly localized effect similar to the transient dose one - a benign glitch in output, a less benign bit flip in memory or a register or, especially in high-power transistors, a destructive latchup and burnout. Single event effects have importance for electronics in satellites, aircraft, and other civilian and military aerospace applications. Sometimes, in circuits not involving latches, it is helpful to introduce RC time constant circuits that slow down the circuit&#x27;s reaction time beyond the duration of an SEE.

====Single-event transient====
An SET happens when the charge collected from an ionization event discharges in the form of a spurious signal traveling through the circuit. This is de facto the effect of an electrostatic discharge. it is considered a soft error, and is reversible.

====Single-event upset====
Single-event upsets (SEU) or transient radiation effects in electronics are state changes of memory or register bits caused by a single ion interacting with the chip. They do not cause lasting damage to the device, but may cause lasting problems to a system which cannot recover from such an error. It is otherwise a reversible soft error. In very sensitive devices, a single ion can cause a multiple-bit upset (MBU) in several adjacent memory cells. SEUs can become single-event functional interrupts (SEFI) when they upset control circuits, such as state machines, placing the device into an undefined state, a test mode, or a halt, which would then need a reset or a power cycle to recover.

====Single-event latchup====
An SEL can occur in any chip with a parasitic PNPN structure. A heavy ion or a high-energy proton passing through one of the two inner-transistor junctions can turn on the thyristor-like structure, which then stays &quot;shorted&quot; (an effect known as latch-up) until the device is power-cycled. As the effect can happen between the power source and substrate, destructively high current can be involved and the part may fail. This is a hard error, and is irreversible. Bulk CMOS devices are most susceptible.

====Single-event snapback====
A single-event snapback is similar to an SEL but not requiring the PNPN structure, and can be induced in N-channel MOS transistors switching large currents, when an ion hits near the drain junction and causes avalanche multiplication of the charge carriers. The transistor then opens and stays opened, a hard error which is irreversible.

====Single-event induced burnout====
An SEB may occur in power MOSFETs when the substrate right under the source region gets forward-biased and the drain-source voltage is higher than the breakdown voltage of the parasitic structures. The resulting high current and local overheating then may destroy the device. This is a hard error, and is irreversible.

====Single-event gate rupture====
SEGR are observed in power MOSFETs when a heavy ion hits the gate region while a high voltage is applied to the gate. A local breakdown then happens in the insulating layer of silicon dioxide, causing local overheating and destruction (looking like a microscopic explosion) of the gate region. It can occur even in EEPROM cells during write or erase, when the cells are subjected to a comparatively high voltage. This is a hard error, and is irreversible.

===SEE testing===
While proton beams are widely used for SEE testing due to availability, at lower energies proton irradiation can often underestimate SEE susceptibility. Furthermore, proton beams expose devices to risk of total ionizing dose (TID) failure which can cloud proton testing results or result in premature device failure. White neutron beams—ostensibly the most representative SEE test method—are usually derived from solid target-based sources, resulting in flux non-uniformity and small beam areas. White neutron beams also have some measure of uncertainty in their energy spectrum, often with high thermal neutron content.

The disadvantages of both proton and spallation neutron sources can be avoided by using mono-energetic 14 MeV neutrons for SEE testing. A potential concern is that mono-energetic neutron-induced single event effects will not accurately represent the real-world effects of broad-spectrum atmospheric neutrons. However, recent studies have indicated that, to the contrary, mono-energetic neutrons—particularly 14 MeV neutrons—can be used to quite accurately understand SEE cross-sections in modern microelectronics.

==Radiation-hardening techniques==

===Physical===
Hardened chips are often manufactured on insulating substrates instead of the usual semiconductor wafers. Silicon on insulator (SOI) and silicon on sapphire (SOS) are commonly used. While normal commercial-grade chips can withstand between 50 and 100 gray (5 and 10 krad), space-grade SOI and SOS chips can survive doses between 1000 and 3000 gray (100 and 300 krad). At one time many 4000 series chips were available in radiation-hardened versions (RadHard). While SOI eliminates latchup events, TID and SEE hardness are not guaranteed to be improved. 

Choosing a substrate with wide band gap gives it higher tolerance to deep-level defects; e.g. silicon carbide or gallium nitride.

Use of a special process node provides increased radiation resistance. Due to the high development costs of new radiation hardened processes, the smallest &quot;true&quot; rad-hard (RHBP, Rad-Hard By Process) process is 150 nm as of 2016, however, rad-hard 65 nm FPGAs were available that used some of the techniques used in &quot;true&quot; rad-hard processes (RHBD, Rad-Hard By Design). As of 2019 110 nm rad-hard processes are available. 

Bipolar integrated circuits generally have higher radiation tolerance than CMOS circuits. The low-power Schottky (LS) 5400 series can withstand 1000 krad, and many ECL devices can withstand 10,000 krad. Using edgeless CMOS transistors, which have an unconventional physical construction, together with an unconventional physical layout, can also be effective.

Magnetoresistive RAM, or MRAM, is considered a likely candidate to provide radiation hardened, rewritable, non-volatile conductor memory. Physical principles and early tests suggest that MRAM is not susceptible to ionization-induced data loss.

Capacitor-based DRAM is often replaced by more rugged (but larger, and more expensive) SRAM. SRAM cells have more transistors per cell than usual (which is 4T or 6T), which makes the cells more tolerant to SEUs at the cost of higher power consumption and size.

====Shielding====
Shielding the package against radioactivity is straightforward to reduce exposure of the bare device.

To protect against neutron radiation and the neutron activation of materials, it is possible to shield the chips themselves by use of depleted boron (consisting only of isotope boron-11) in the borophosphosilicate glass passivation layer protecting the chips, as naturally prevalent boron-10 readily captures neutrons and undergoes alpha decay (see soft error).

===Logical===
Error correcting code memory (ECC memory) uses redundant bits to check for and possibly correct corrupted data. Since radiation&#x27;s effects damage the memory content even when the system is not accessing the RAM, a &quot;scrubber&quot; circuit must continuously sweep the RAM; reading out the data, checking the redundant bits for data errors, then writing back any corrections to the RAM.

Redundant elements can be used at the system level. Three separate microprocessor boards may independently compute an answer to a calculation and compare their answers. Any system that produces a minority result will recalculate. Logic may be added such that if repeated errors occur from the same system, that board is shut down.

Redundant elements may be used at the circuit level. A single bit may be replaced with three bits and separate &quot;voting logic&quot; for each bit to continuously determine its result (triple modular redundancy). This increases area of a chip design by a factor of 5, so must be reserved for smaller designs. But it has the secondary advantage of also being &quot;fail-safe&quot; in real time. In the event of a single-bit failure (which may be unrelated to radiation), the voting logic will continue to produce the correct result without resorting to a watchdog timer. System level voting between three separate processor systems will generally need to use some circuit-level voting logic to perform the votes between the three processor systems.

Hardened latches may be used.

A watchdog timer will perform a hard reset of a system unless some sequence is performed that generally indicates the system is alive, such as a write operation from an onboard processor. During normal operation, software schedules a write to the watchdog timer at regular intervals to prevent the timer from running out. If radiation causes the processor to operate incorrectly, it is unlikely the software will work correctly enough to clear the watchdog timer. The watchdog eventually times out and forces a hard reset to the system. This is considered a last resort to other methods of radiation hardening.

==Military and space industry applications==
Radiation-hardened and radiation tolerant components are often used in military and aerospace applications, including point-of-load (POL) applications, satellite system power supplies, step down switching regulators, microprocessors, FPGAs, FPGA power sources, and high efficiency, low voltage subsystem power supplies.

However, not all military-grade components are radiation hardened. For example, the US MIL-STD-883 features many radiation-related tests, but has no specification for single event latchup frequency. The Fobos-Grunt space probe may have failed due to a similar assumption.

The market size for radiation hardened electronics used in space applications was estimated to be $2.35 billion in 2021. A new study has estimated that this will reach approximately $4.76 billion by the year 2032.

==Nuclear hardness for telecommunication==
In telecommunication, the term &quot;nuclear hardness&quot; has the following meanings:
1) an expression of the extent to which the performance of a system, facility, or device is expected to degrade in a given nuclear environment, 2) the physical attributes of a system or electronic component that will allow survival in an environment that includes nuclear radiation and electromagnetic pulses (EMP).

===Notes===
# Nuclear hardness may be expressed in terms of either susceptibility or vulnerability.
# The extent of expected performance degradation (&quot;e.g.,&quot; outage time, data lost, and equipment damage) must be defined or specified. The environment (&quot;e.g.,&quot; radiation levels, overpressure, peak velocities, energy absorbed, and electrical stress) must be defined or specified.
# The physical attributes of a system or component that will allow a defined degree of survivability in a given environment created by a nuclear weapon.
# Nuclear hardness is determined for specified or actual quantified environmental conditions and physical parameters, such as peak radiation levels, overpressure, velocities, energy absorbed, and electrical stress. It is achieved through design specifications and it is verified by test and analysis techniques.

<text>Pentalene is a polycyclic hydrocarbon composed of two fused cyclopentadiene rings. It has chemical formula . It is antiaromatic, because it has 4&quot;n&quot; π electrons where &quot;n&quot; is any integer. For this reason it dimerizes even at temperatures as low as −100 °C. The derivative 1,3,5-tri-&quot;tert&quot;-butylpentalene was synthesized in 1973. Because of the &quot;tert&quot;-butyl substituents this compound is thermally stable. Pentalenes can also be stabilized by benzannulation for example in the compounds benzopentalene and dibenzopentalene.

Dilithium pentalenide was isolated in 1962, long before pentalene itself in 1997. It is prepared from reaction of dihydropentalene (pyrolysis of an isomer of dicyclopentadiene) with &quot;n&quot;-butyllithium in solution and forms a stable salt. In accordance with its structure proton NMR shows 2 signals in a 2 to 1 ratio. The addition of two electrons removes the antiaromaticity; it becomes a planar 10π-electron aromatic species and is thus a bicyclic analogue of the cyclooctatetraene (COT) dianion .

The dianion can also be considered as two fused cyclopentadienyl rings, and has been used as a ligand in organometallic chemistry to stabilise many types of mono- and bimetallic complexes, including those containing multiple metal-metal bonds, and &quot;anti&quot;-bimetallics with extremely high levels of electronic communication between the centers.

<doc id="1041657" wikidata="Q213630" url="?curid=1041657" title="Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha">
<text>Ernest II (; 21 June 181822 August 1893) was Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha from 29 January 1844 to his death in 1893. He was born in Coburg to Ernest III, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and Princess Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. His father became Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (as Ernest I) in 1826 through an exchange of territories.

In 1842, Ernest married Princess Alexandrine of Baden in what was to be a childless marriage. Two years later, he became Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha when his father died. Ernest supported the German Confederation in the Schleswig-Holstein Wars against Denmark, sending thousands of troops and becoming the commander of a German corps; he was instrumental in the 1849 victory at the battle of Eckernförde against Danish forces. After King Otto of Greece was deposed in 1862, the British government put Ernest&#x27;s name forward as a possible successor. Negotiations concerning this failed for various reasons—not least of which was that he would not give up his beloved duchies in favor of the Greek throne.

A supporter of a unified Germany, Ernest watched the various political movements with great interest. While he initially was a great and outspoken proponent of German liberalism, he surprised many by switching sides and supporting the more conservative (and eventually victorious) Prussians during the Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian Wars and subsequent unification of Germany. His support of the conservatives came at a price however, and he was no longer viewed as the possible leader of a political movement. According to historian Charlotte Zeepvat, Ernest became &quot;increasingly lost in a whirl of private amusements which earned only contempt from outside&quot;.

Ernest and his only full sibling, his younger brother Prince Albert (consort to Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom), were born 14 months apart and raised as though twins. They became closer upon the separation and divorce of their parents as well as the eventual death of their mother. Their relationship experienced phases of closeness as well as minor arguments as they grew older. After Albert&#x27;s death in 1861, Ernest published anonymous pamphlets against various members of the British royal family. However, he accepted Albert&#x27;s second son, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, as his heir-presumptive. Upon Ernest&#x27;s death at Reinhardsbrunn, Alfred succeeded to the ducal throne.

==Early life==

Ernest, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, was born at Ehrenburg Palace in Coburg on 21 June 1818. He was the elder son of Ernest III, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (later Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha) and his first wife Princess Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. He was soon joined by a brother, Prince Albert, who would later become the husband of Queen Victoria. Though Duke Ernest fathered numerous children in various affairs, the two boys would have no other legitimate siblings. In 1826, their father succeeded as Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha through an exchange of territories after the death of the duke&#x27;s uncle, Frederick IV, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg.

There are various accounts of Ernest&#x27;s childhood. When he was fourteen months old, a servant commented that Ernest &quot;runs around like a weasel. He is teething and as cross as a little badger from impatience and liveliness. He is not pretty now, except his beautiful black eyes.&quot; In May 1820, his mother described Ernest as &quot;very big for his age, as well as intelligent. His big black eyes are full of spirit and vivacity.&quot; Biographer Richard Hough writes that &quot;even from their infancy, it was plainly evident that the elder son took after his father, in character and appearance, while Albert strongly resembled his mother in most respects.&quot; Ernest and his brother often lived with their grandmother the Dowager Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld until her death in 1831.

He and Albert were brought up and educated together as if they were twins. Though Albert was fourteen months younger, he surpassed Ernest intellectually. According to their tutor, &quot;they went hand-in-hand in all things, whether at work or at play. Engaging in the same pursuits, sharing the same joys and the same sorrows, they were bound to each other by no common feelings of mutual love&quot;. Perhaps the aforementioned &quot;sorrows&quot; related to their parents&#x27; marriage; it was not happy, and Duke Ernest I was continually unfaithful. In 1824, Ernest I and Louise divorced; she subsequently left Coburg and was disallowed from seeing her sons again. She soon remarried to Alexander von Hanstein, Count of Pölzig and Beiersdorf, dying in 1831 at the age of thirty. The year after her death, their father married his niece Duchess Marie of Württemberg, who was his sister Antoinette&#x27;s daughter. Their stepmother was thus also their first cousin. The duke and his new duchess were not close, and would produce no children; while the boys formed a happy relationship with their stepmother, Marie had little to no input in her stepsons&#x27; lives. The separation and divorce of their parents, as well as the later death of their mother, left the boys scarred and in close companionship with each other.

In 1836, Ernest and Albert visited their matrimonially eligible cousin Princess Victoria of Kent, spending a few weeks at Windsor Castle. Both boys, especially Albert, were considered by their family to be a potential husband for the young princess, and they were both taught to speak competent English. Their father at first thought that Ernest would make a better husband to Victoria than Albert, possibly because his sporting interests would be better received by the British public. However, most others favored Albert over Ernest as a possible husband. Temperamentally, Victoria was much more like Ernest, for both were lively and sociable with a love for dancing, gossip, and late nights; conversely, this fast pace made Albert physically ill. Victoria believed Ernest had a &quot;most kind, honest, and intelligent expression in his countenance&quot;, while Albert &quot;seemed full of goodness and sweetness, and very clever and intelligent.&quot; No offer of marriage was forthcoming for either brother however, and they returned home.

Ernest entered military training later that year. In April 1837, Ernest and Albert and their household moved to the University of Bonn. Six weeks into their academic term, Victoria succeeded as Queen of the United Kingdom. As rumors of an impending marriage between her and Albert interfered with their studies, the two brothers left on 28 August 1837 at the close of the term to travel around Europe. They returned to Bonn in early November to continue their studies. The brothers travelled to England again in 1839, at which time Victoria found her cousin Albert agreeable, and soon proposed. This connection would have many implications for Ernest in the future; for example, he was selected as godfather for Albert&#x27;s second daughter Princess Alice, and would eventually come to give her away at her wedding, only months after Albert&#x27;s death.

Thanks to his widespread royal connections, he travelled widely at this stage of his life. In 1840 and 1841 he went to Spain and Portugal; in Portugal another cousin, Ferdinand, was King Consort.

==Marriage==

Various candidates were put forward as a possible wife for Ernest. His father wanted him to look to a woman of high rank, such as a Russian grand duchess, for a wife. One possibility was Princess Clémentine of Orléans, a daughter of Louis Philippe I, whom he met while visiting the court at the Tuileries. However, such a marriage would have required his conversion from Lutheranism to Roman Catholicism, and consequently nothing came of it. She later married his cousin Prince August of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Ernest was also considered by Dowager Queen Maria Christina as a possible husband for her young daughter Isabella II of Spain, and by Queen Victoria for her cousin Princess Augusta of Cambridge.

In Karlsruhe on 3 May 1842, Ernest married 21-year-old Princess Alexandrine of Baden. She was the eldest daughter of Leopold, Grand Duke of Baden, and Princess Sophie of Sweden, daughter of the deposed King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden. Though he gave his consent, his father was disappointed that his first son did not do more to advance the concerns of Coburg. The marriage did not produce any issue, though Ernest apparently fathered at least three illegitimate children in later years.

Ernest had suffered from a venereal disease in his late teens and early twenties, most likely as the consequence of living a wild, promiscuous lifestyle. He had come to behave in such a fashion by the tutelage of his father, who took his sons to &quot;sample the pleasures&quot; of Paris and Berlin, to Albert&#x27;s &quot;horror and shame&quot;. Ernest had been so visibly deteriorating in appearance as a result that Sarah Lyttelton, a lady-in-waiting of Queen Victoria, observed at Windsor Castle in 1839 that he was &quot;very thin and hollow-cheeked and pale, and no likeness to his brother, nor much beauty. But he has fine dark eyes and black hair, and light figure, and a great look of spirit and eagerness&quot;. Later that year, Albert counselled his brother against finding a wife until his &#x27;condition&#x27; was fully recovered. He further warned that continued promiscuity could leave Ernest incapable of fathering children. Some historians believe that while he himself was able to father other children, the disease rendered his young wife infertile. Ernest was married for 51 years and with his wife visited Queen Victoria in Paris in 1890.

==Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha==
On 29 January 1844, Ernest&#x27;s father died in Gotha, one of the territories their family had recently acquired. Ernest consequently succeeded to the duchies of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha as Ernest II.

===Development of a constitution===
Extravagant to a great degree, Ernest had many money troubles throughout his reign. In January 1848, Ernest visited his brother in the midst of political unrest in Germany. Upon his return, he also discovered unrest in Coburg. One of the many concerns related to finances. Although Ernest had a large inheritance, he also had frequent debts. There were increasing calls to nationalize most of his property. Indeed, Albert had to intervene at one point and spare his brother the embarrassment of losing one of his Coburg properties.

During the 1848 turmoil in Germany, Albert had been constructing his own liberal reform plan, under which a single monarch, chancellor, and parliament would unite the German states; in addition, each state would retain its own current ruling dynasty. As this plan pertained to his brother, Ernest was given a copy in the hope that he would develop his own liberal constitution. Ernest subsequently made a few concessions, but his position remained sound, not counting the increasing problem of his debts. A constitution was drafted and promulgated in 1849 in Gotha, though one had existed in Coburg since 1821. In 1852, both constitutions were converged into one, which converted the personal union of the two duchies into a real union; the duchies were now inseparable, with a common set of institutions. During the political turmoil, timely concessions and Ernest&#x27;s popular habit of mingling with &quot;the people in their pleasures&quot; were instrumental in keeping him from losing his throne. Furthermore, various contemporary sources state that Ernest was an able, just and very popular ruler, which may have also helped keep him in power.

===Schleswig-Holstein wars===
From 1848 to 1864, Denmark and the German Confederation fought over control of the two duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. Historically, the duchies had been ruled by Denmark since medieval times, but there remained a large German majority. This majority was sparked to rebellion after Frederick VII of Denmark announced on 27 March 1848 the duchies would become an integral part of Denmark under his new liberal constitution. Prussia soon became involved, supporting the uprising and beginning the First Schleswig War. Ernest sent 8,000 men initially, adding to the army sent by the German Confederation. He also desired to be given a military job during the war, but was refused, as it was &quot;extremely difficult to offer me a position in the army of Schleswig-Holstein corresponding to my rank&quot;, according to his memoirs. He agreed to a smaller command, coming to lead a Thuringian contingent; he commented in a letter to his brother that &quot;I should have declined any other command of the kind, but I could not refuse this one, as, in the present condition of our States, it is important to keep the executive power in our hands&quot;. As commander of a German corps, Ernest was instrumental in winning the 5 April 1849 battle of Eckernförde against Danish forces, capturing two frigates. Also at this time, Ernest took an interest in the Frankfurt Parliament and may have hoped to be chosen German Emperor, but instead he urged King Frederick of Prussia to take that position, albeit unsuccessfully. Ernest also brought about a Berlin conference of German princes in 1850; he highly valued such opportunities for the political influence they brought him.

===Relationship with Victoria and Albert===
The first war ended in 1851, but would resume in 1864. During this interlude, Ernest fervently opposed the marriage of his nephew Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (&#x27;Bertie&#x27;), to Princess Alexandra of Denmark, a daughter of the future Christian IX of Denmark (and therefore an enemy of the German states). He believed that such a match flew in the face of German interests. Albert replied angrily: &quot;What has that got to do with you?... Vicky has racked her brains to help us to find someone, but in vain...We have no [other reasonable] choice&quot;. Albert agreed there were going to be problems with the match, but as he could find no alternative bride, he wrote to Ernest that keeping the affair a private matter (and outside the realm of government) was &quot;the only way to prevent a break with Prussia and the only way to keep the game in our own hands, impose the conditions that we think necessary, and as far as we can, take off its political edge&quot;. Albert also warned his son of Ernest&#x27;s endeavors to interfere with the match, commenting, &quot;Your uncle...will try his hand at this work. Your best defence will be not to enter on the subject, should he broach it&quot;.

Soon after writing these letters, Prince Albert died on 14 December 1861. His death helped Ernest repair his relationship with his sister-in-law, as Victoria had been becoming increasingly angry over Ernest&#x27;s objections to the Danish match. The two brothers had always been close, whatever their disagreements, and Albert&#x27;s death left Ernest &quot;wretched&quot;, noted Victoria in a letter to her eldest daughter. The death did not solve their argument however; seeing that his direct involvement had failed to persuade Victoria, Ernest tried a new tactic. He began to spread gossip about Alexandra and her family, saying that her mother Princess Louise &quot;had illegitimate children and Alexandra had flirtations with young officers&quot;; he also wrote to Louise herself, warning that Bertie would be an unfortunate choice for a husband. Additionally, Ernest met with his nephew at Thebes, most likely attempting to discourage him from the match in person. In an 11 April letter, Victoria unhappily noted to her eldest daughter, &quot;You did not tell me that Bertie had met Uncle Ernest at Thebes...I am always alarmed when I think of Uncle Ernest and Bertie being together as I know the former will do all he can to set Bertie against the marriage with Princess Alix&quot;. Despite Ernest&#x27;s disapproval, Bertie was duly married to Alexandra on 10 March 1863.

His close relationship with the English court gave him a position of great influence, and the marriage of his niece, Princess Victoria, to Prince Frederick William further strengthened his ties to Prussia, and in 1862 he offered to make his troops available to the King of Prussia in case of war. But his liberalism caused increased suspicion in Germany of the Coburg influence. Prussian conservatives would soon turn against him, and in particular he was opposed by Prussian Minister President Otto von Bismarck.

During the American Civil War, the Duke assigned Ernst Raven to the position of consul in the state of Texas. On 30 July 1861, Raven applied to the Confederate Government for a diplomatic exequatur and was accepted.

===Nomination for the Greek throne===

On 23 October 1862, Otto of Bavaria, King of Greece, was deposed in a bloodless &quot;coup&quot;. The Greeks were eager to have someone close to Britain and Queen Victoria replace Otto; some desired to allow Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh (her second son) to succeed as King of Greece. He was elected with 95% of the vote in the Greek head of state referendum of 1862. After his ineligibility was confirmed however, the Greeks began looking for other possible candidates, which included Duke Ernest at the British government&#x27;s suggestion. To their and Victoria&#x27;s reasoning, if Ernest were to take the Greek throne, Alfred could immediately take up his inheritance and succeed Ernest as duke (the Prince of Wales having passed his claim to the duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha on to his younger brother). Many were in favor of his nomination, including Prime Minister Lord Palmerston as well as Ernest&#x27;s sister-in-law. In a letter written to her uncle Leopold I of Belgium, Victoria stated her support for a new royal branch of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (as Leopold had been chosen as King of the Belgians in 1831), as well as her desire for her second son, Alfred, to succeed his uncle in the duchy. As negotiations continued however, she began to lose enthusiasm for the idea.

There were problems to the nomination; Ernest had no legitimate children, and thus would have had to adopt one of the princes of his house to succeed him as King of Greece. To solve this problem, Ernest suggested to Palmerston that he simply take the title Regent of Greece and hold the kingdom in trust for his chosen heir. He also stipulated that if he accepted the throne, it should be subject to certain guarantees by the other powers. The apparent deal-breaker, though, was the fact that Ernest wanted to acquire the Greek throne &quot;and&quot; still maintain control of his &quot;safer&quot; duchies. In the end, the British cabinet thought the proposed conditions unacceptable. His recommendations having been turned down, Ernest in turn refused. In 1863, the Greek throne was accepted by another member of a royal family: the Princess of Wales&#x27; younger brother Prince William of Denmark. Ernest would later comment, &quot;That this cup was spared me, I always regarded as a piece of good fortune&quot;.

===Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian Wars===

Ernest, like his brother, was in favor of a unified but federal German state. In seeking to realize this goal, Ernest liked to dabble in whatever political system promised the most success. He subsequently watched the growth of liberalism in Germany with much interest and tried to build links with the movement&#x27;s leaders. During Albert&#x27;s lifetime, Ernest took a close interest in the movement for reform, and was perceived as a progressive within Germany. His favorable view of liberalism caused his duchy to become an asylum for political refugees from other German states. In 1863, he attended the liberal Frankfurt Conference, which was openly avoided by more conservative Prussia. Though his attendance made him no friends in Prussia, he developed such strong contacts in Austria that many looked to him as a potential leader in the mounting conflict between the northern and southern powers. He grew tired of the advice he received from Albert on the subject however; as Ernest &quot;was by no means inclined to consent to an energetic rule such as I adopted immediately afterwards for the perfection of the constitutional system&quot;, according to Albert&#x27;s letters.

The Austro-Prussian War of 1866 was triggered by the desire of German conservative leaders to unify, albeit on different terms than their liberal counterparts. Ernest urged Prussian leaders against the impending war, and was an active advocate of the Austrian cause. Though Ernest normally followed more liberal politics than many of his counterparts, he began switching his views to align more closely with Bismarck by the mid-1860s. Despite this change in his private political views, he still had strong publicly known ties to Austria, where his cousin Alexander, Count Mensdorff, was Foreign Minister, and no one foresaw that Ernest would immediately side with the better-equipped Prussians upon breakout of the war. His reasoning is usually understood as acting in the best interests of his duchies, and by extension, of himself. Some influence came from Bismarck, who explained his policy and tactics in a letter to Ernest. Regardless, it was seen as a betrayal of former friends; Queen Victoria commented that Ernest &quot;might have agreed to neutrality—for that might be necessary, but to change colours I cannot think right&quot;.

Ernest was fortunate in his support of victorious Prussia; for his services he received the forest of Schmalkalden. Many other petty German dukes, princes, and kings who had supported Austria suffered immensely at Hohenzollern hands. Hanover, Hesse-Kassel, and Nassau for instance were all annexed to Prussia at the expense of their respective rulers. Though he had only recently changed his political views, Ernest was allowed to ride at the head of his battalion during the victory parade. His eldest niece Prussian Crown Princess Victoria (&quot;Vicky&quot;) was for one pleased with his Prussian support and commented &quot;I am not accustomed to hearing so much praise of Coburg here. [Ernest] was not among the crushed and beaten foe, it is sad enough as it is to see so many of one&#x27;s friends suffering from the effects of their miscalculations&quot;. Victoria&#x27;s husband Crown Prince Frederick William was also pleased with Ernest&#x27;s decision, writing in his journal 28 September 1871, that the duke&#x27;s &quot;society always affords me peculiar pleasure, especially...when his heart beats so warmly for Germany&quot;.

Ernest&#x27;s support of the Prussians in the Austro-Prussian War and later Franco Prussian War meant he was no longer the potential leader of a political movement; although it was true that he had been able to retain his duchies, it had come at a price. According to historian Charlotte Zeepvat, Ernest &quot;was increasingly lost in a whirl of private amusements which earned only contempt from outside&quot;. Ernest funneled his political thoughts into the private sphere, preferring to write covertly sponsored articles in the Coburg press that became increasingly embittered against England. In 1886, Ernest published &quot;Co-Regents and Foreign Influence in Germany&quot;, a pamphlet that greatly angered his family; though produced anonymously, no one doubted that it was written by Ernest. It attacked Vicky as a disloyal German that was too dependent on her mother, and declared that she had been too indiscreet in passing along confidential information during both war and peacetime. Queen Victoria was furious, writing to Vicky, &quot;What you told me of Uncle E and that pamphlet is simply monstrous. I assure you that I felt great difficulty in writing to him for his birthday, but I wrote it as short and cool as I could consistently with civility&quot;. &quot;Dear Uncle Ernest does us all a great deal of harm by his odd ways and uncontrollable tongue with his very lively imagination&quot;.

===Later years===
Later in his reign, Ernest&#x27;s actions managed to continually anger his sister-in-law. Though Victoria loved Ernest because he was Albert&#x27;s brother, she was displeased that Ernest was writing his memoirs, worrying about their contents mainly in regard to her dead husband. Despite their disputes, Ernest still met with Victoria and her family occasionally. In 1891, they met in France; Victoria&#x27;s lady-in-waiting commented &quot;the old Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha has been here today with his wife. He is the Prince Consort&#x27;s only brother and an awful looking man, the Queen dislikes him particularly. He is always writing anonymous pamphlets against the Queen and the Empress Frederick, which naturally creates a great deal of annoyance in the family&quot;.

Throughout his reign, Ernest had been known for his extravagance and womanizing; as he grew older, Ernest enjoyed gossip and was &quot;now a thoroughly disreputable old roué who enjoyed the outrage provoked by his actions&quot;, leading Vicky to declare that her uncle &quot;was his own enemy&quot;. His behavior and manner of dress increasingly became a joke for younger generations. His great-niece Marie of Edinburgh would later describe Ernest as &quot;an old beau, squeezed into a frock-coat too tight for his bulk and uncomfortably pinched in at the waist, sporting a top hat, lemon coloured gloves, and a rosebud in his lapel&quot;. He put on weight and though on paper his wealth was large, he was still constantly in debt.

An excellent musician and amateur composer all his life, Ernest was a great patron of the arts and sciences in Coburg, often giving awards and titles to members of the artistic and scientific world, such as Paul Kalisch, a German opera singer and the English chemist William Ernest Bush. Ernest composed songs, hymns, and cantatas, as well as musical pieces for opera and the stage, including &quot;Die Gräberinsel&quot; (1842), &quot;Tony, oder die Vergeltung&quot; (1849), &quot;Casilda&quot; (1851), &quot;Santa Chiara&quot; (1854), and &quot;Zaïre&quot;, which met with success in Germany. He could also draw and play the piano. One of his operas, &quot;Diana von Solange&quot; (1858), prompted Franz Liszt the following year to write an orchestral &quot;Festmarsch nach Motiven von E. H. z. S.-C.-G.&quot;, S.116 (E. H. z. S.-C.-G. was short for Ernst Herzog zu Sachsen-Coburg-Gotha). However, its production at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City in 1890 inspired dismal reviews, with one spectator commenting that its &quot;music was simply rubbish&quot;. Ernest was also an avid hunter and sportsman; one contemporary remarked that he was &quot;one of the foremost and keenest sportsman produced by the present century&quot;. In addition, Ernest was an enthusiastic patron of everything connected with natural history, for instance traveling to Abyssinia with the German zoologist Alfred Brehm in 1862. That journey was chronicled in a book, &quot;Reise des Herzogs Ernst von Sachsen-Koburg-Gotha nach Ägypten&quot;, published in 1862. He also published his memoirs in three volumes: &quot;Aus meinem Leben und aus meiner Zeit&quot; (1888–1890).

Ernest II died at Reinhardsbrunn on 22 August 1893 after a short illness. “When the news of the duke&#x27;s death reached the secluded Hinter - Riss, the deepest consternation took possession of the people, amongst whom the prince and the duchess had passed, as they often used to say, the happiest days of their long, eventful lives. In him they lost a kind, dear master and a good friend, who was for ever willing to help where help was needed. If it took half a century to win the affection and confidence of these self-retained hardy mountain people, his memory will a century hence be as green as are the firs and pines that cling so tenaciously to their native rock; and the deeds and words of the popular “Herr Herzog” will there be spoken of when in the outer world his name will be remembered only by the historian. The dead sportsman&#x27;s hunting - knife, which I saw so often in his strong hand, is now lying before me, a cherished memento, kindly sent me by the stricken dowager-duchess a few weeks after the funeral. It will ever remind me, not so much of a sportsman prince, as of a prince among sportsmen.” From the book: Sport in the Alps in the Past and Present, An Account of the Chase of the Chamois, Red Deer, Bouquetin, Roe-deer, Capercaillie, and Black-cock, with Personal Adventures and Historical Notes and Some Sporting Reminiscences of H.R.H. the Late Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha – William Adolphus Baillie-Grohman. As fitting as these final words was the act that closed this long and distinguished sporting career, for less than an hour before that fatal attack of apoplexy, his master hand had brought down two royals ! A lifelong sportsman, his last words were apparently &quot;Let the drive commence!&quot; His funeral was held in the Morizkirche in Coburg; thousands of spectators came to the funeral, including Emperor Wilhelm II and the Prince of Wales. He is buried in the ducal mausoleum in the &quot;&quot; which he himself had built in 1853–58.

Ernest was succeeded by his nephew Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh.

==Inheritance to Saxe-Coburg and Gotha==

For much of Ernest&#x27;s reign, the heir presumptive to Saxe-Coburg and Gotha was his only sibling Prince Albert, consort of Queen Victoria. When it became increasingly clear that Ernest would be childless, the possibility of a personal union between his duchies and the United Kingdom became real, a reality that was deemed undesirable. Special arrangements were made by a combination of constitutional clauses and renunciations to pass Ernest&#x27;s throne to a son of Albert while preventing a personal union. Consequently, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, his brother&#x27;s second eldest son, was designated the childless Ernest&#x27;s heir presumptive, when his older brother, the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII of the United Kingdom), renounced his succession rights.

Issues arose over authority to control the upbringing of his heir-presumptive. As head of the Coburg family, Ernest would normally have been able to arrange Alfred&#x27;s education and general upbringing unchallenged. This however was not the case. Alfred was torn between his British birth and his German inheritance. This was partly because Alfred was second-in-line to the United Kingdom until the birth of his nephew Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, in 1864. One example of the many problems of his education concerned the language he would speak. Although he grew up learning German, his native language was decided to be English. In addition, a naval career was chosen for Alfred, a common profession for a British prince but almost unheard of for a German prince. Ernest also wanted Alfred to be educated in Coburg, but his brother refused. Albert&#x27;s refusal most likely stemmed from the negative British reaction that would have inevitably occurred and the fact that Albert was fearful of Alfred&#x27;s moral development. Thus, despite Ernest&#x27;s protests, he went unheeded in Albert&#x27;s lifetime. In 1863, Ernest told Victoria that it was time for Alfred to leave the navy and enter a German university. By March of the following year, it was decided that Alfred would attend Bonn University but be left to consider his future, as he was having reservations over permanently residing outside England. The matter was eventually resolved; Alfred came to accept his inheritance, and Victoria understood and accepted that Ernest needed to be involved in the upbringing of his heir-presumptive, with a strong German element added to his education and (carefully chaperoned) visits to Coburg.
==In popular culture==
Ernest appears in the 2016 ITV series &quot;Victoria&quot;, portrayed by David Oakes. He is inaccurately depicted as having an affair with Harriet Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, Duchess of Sutherland. In real life, Ernest likely never met the Duchess; he was already married at the time, and the Duchess was twelve years older than him.

<text>Best... I is a compilation album by the Smiths. It was released in August 1992 by the new owner of their back catalogue, WEA (Sire Records in the United States). It reached number one on the UK Albums Chart; it reached No. 139 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Warner UK used a photograph taken by actor Dennis Hopper titled &quot;Biker Couple, 1961&quot; (top photo) for the artwork of the two 1992 &quot;best of&quot; compilations by The Smiths.

==Background==
WEA (now the Warner Music Group) had acquired the entire Smiths back catalogue in early 1992. Along with the re-release of the eight original albums (the four studio albums, the &quot;Rank&quot; live album and the three compilation albums issued while the band were still active), they immediately set to work compiling a &#x27;best of&#x27; collection in two volumes. It was the first time a regular best of compilation had ever been made of The Smiths&#x27; material and the album effortlessly reached the top of the British charts. The British press had doubts about sell-out and low track selection coherence.

The material is more or less picked and sequenced at random, and consists of both singles and album cuts. It was followed later the same year by its sibling, &quot;...Best II&quot;. The first spin-off single, a re-release of &quot;This Charming Man&quot;, reached No. 8 in the singles chart, the highest position a Smiths single had ever reached. A second single promoting &quot;Best... I&quot;, an edited re-release of &quot;How Soon Is Now?&quot;, got to No. 16 (the uncut version is featured on the compilation).

===Cover===
The UK and European release of the record featured the left half of a biker couple photograph by Dennis Hopper from 1961 entitled &#x27;Biker Couple&#x27; on its sleeve, with &quot;...Best II&quot; completing the picture; the U.S. sleeve was designed by singer Morrissey and features Richard Davalos, co-star of &quot;East of Eden&quot;.
