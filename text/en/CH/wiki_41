<text>The Navy Ceremonial Duty Ribbon, is an award of the United States Navy which was established on December 12, 2003 by order of Secretary of the Navy Gordon R. England for a successful tour of duty with the United States Navy Ceremonial Guard or USS Constitution ending on or after May 1, 2001. A Sailor&#x27;s service prior to this date does not qualify the member for the ribbon.

==History==
The ribbon was originally created in 2003 as the Navy Ceremonial Guard Ribbon to honor Sailors of that command, who form the Navy&#x27;s Presidential honor guard and conduct all Navy funerals at Arlington National Cemetery. As of January 17, 2012 the name of the Navy Ceremonial Duty Ribbon was changed to the Navy Ceremonial Duty Ribbon so that Sailors serving aboard , who give tours of the ship, could also receive the ribbon. 

==Eligibility==

The Navy Ceremonial Duty Ribbon is presented to those members of the U.S. Navy who, while stationed in Washington, D.C., complete a standard tour of duty with the United States Navy Ceremonial Guard. A standard tour is defined as at least two years of duty with no disciplinary action, above average evaluations, and adherence to physical and military bearing standards of the Navy Ceremonial Guard. Sailors must also be in a drilling status for 18 months, and reach at least Standard Honors qualification within one of the Guard&#x27;s four platoons (firing party, casket bearers, color guard, or drill team). It can also be presented to personnel who complete a successful tour aboard USS Constitution, defined in this case as a tour of 24 months, completion of all required qualifications, and maintaining outstanding personal appearance and a discipline free record. 

The only awarding authorities for the Navy Ceremonial Duty Ribbon are the commanding officer of the United States Navy Ceremonial Guard, headquartered at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in the District of Columbia; and the commanding officer of USS &quot;Constitution&quot;, which is berthed at the Charlestown Navy Yard. Multiple awards of the Navy Ceremonial Duty Ribbon are denoted by 3/16&quot; bronze service stars, however only one award of the ribbon is authorized for each tour of duty.

<text>The Nordic Bronze Age (also Northern Bronze Age, or Scandinavian Bronze Age) is a period of Scandinavian prehistory from .

The Nordic Bronze Age culture emerged about 1750 BC as a continuation of the Late Neolithic Dagger period, which is rooted in the Battle Axe culture (the Swedish-Norwegian Corded Ware variant), the Single Grave Culture (the north German and Danish Corded Ware varaiant) and Bell Beaker culture, as well as from influence that came from Central Europe. This influence most likely came from people similar to those of the Unetice culture, since they brought customs that were derived from Unetice or from local interpretations of the Unetice culture located in North Western Germany. The metallurgical influences from Central Europe are especially noticeable. The Bronze Age in Scandinavia can be said to begin shortly after 2000 BC with the introduction and use of bronze tools, followed by a more systematic adoption of bronze metalworking technology from 1750 BC.

The Nordic Bronze Age maintained close trade links with Mycenaean Greece, with whom it shares several striking similarities. Some cultural similarities between the Nordic Bronze Age, the Sintashta/Andronovo culture and peoples of the Rigveda have also been detected. The Nordic Bronze Age region included part of northern Germany, and some scholars also include sites in what is now Estonia, Finland and Pomerania as part of its cultural sphere.

The people of the Nordic Bronze Age were actively engaged in the export of amber, and imported metals in return, becoming expert metalworkers. With respect to the number and density of metal deposits, the Nordic Bronze Age became the richest culture in Europe during its existence.

Iron metallurgy began to be practised in Scandinavia during the later Bronze Age, from at least the 9th century BC. Around the 5th century BC, the Nordic Bronze Age was succeeded by the Pre-Roman Iron Age and the Jastorf culture. The Nordic Bronze Age is often considered ancestral to the Germanic peoples.

==History==
===Origins===
The Nordic Bronze Age is a successor of the Corded Ware culture in southern Scandinavia and Northern Germany. It appears to represent a fusion of elements from the Corded Ware culture and the preceding Pitted Ware culture. The decisive factor that triggered the change from the Chalcolithic Battle Axe culture into the Nordic Bronze Age is often believed to have been metallurgical influence as well as general cultural influence from Central Europe, similar in custom to those of the Unetice culture.

===Chronology===
Oscar Montelius, who coined the term used for the period, divided it into six distinct sub-periods in his piece &quot;Om tidsbestämning inom bronsåldern med särskilt avseende på Skandinavien&quot; (&quot;On Bronze Age dating with particular focus on Scandinavia&quot;) published in 1885, which is still in wide use. His relative chronology has held up well against radiocarbon dating, with the exception that the period&#x27;s start is closer to 1700 BC than 1800 BC, as Montelius suggested. For Central Europe a different system developed by Paul Reinecke is commonly used, as each area has its own artifact types and archaeological periods.

A broader subdivision is the Early Bronze Age, between 1700 BC and 1100 BC, and the Late Bronze Age, 1100 BC to 550 BC. These divisions and periods are followed by the Pre-Roman Iron Age.

== Culture ==

===Settlements===
Settlement in the Nordic Bronze Age period consisted mainly of single farmsteads, which usually consisted of a longhouse plus additional four-post built structures (&quot;helms&quot;). Longhouses were initially two aisled, and after three aisled structure became normal. Some longhouses were exceptionally large (up to about 500 m2 in area), and have been described as &quot;chiefly halls&quot;, &quot;the sitting area of which is the size of a megaron in contemporary Mycenean palaces&quot;. Larger settlements are also known (such as Hallunda and Apalle in Sweden and Voldtofte in Denmark), as well as fortified sites, specialist workshops for metalwork and ceramic production, and dedicated cult houses. Settlements were geographically located on higher ground, and tended to be concentrated near the sea. Certain settlements functioned as regional centres of power, trade, craft production, and ritual activity. The Bronze Age fortified town of Hünenburg bei Watenstedt in northern Germany (12th c. BC) has been described as a trading post for people from Scandinavia and the Baltic Sea region, as well as a cult centre and seat of a ruling elite.

===Burials===

Associated with Nordic Bronze Age settlements are burial cairns, mounds and cemeteries, with interments including oak coffins and urn burials; other settlement associations include rock carvings, or bronze hoards in wetland sites. Some burial mounds are especially large and, with respect to the amount of gold and bronze in them, extraordinarily rich for this time period. Examples of prominent burial mounds include the Håga mound and Kivik King&#x27;s Grave in Sweden, and the Lusehøj and Skelhøj in Denmark. A minimum of 50,000 burial mounds were constructed between 1500 and 1150 BC in Denmark alone.

Oak coffin burials dating from the 14th–13th centuries BC contained well-preserved mummified bodies, along with their clothing and burial goods. The bodies were intentionally mummified by watering the burial mounds to create a bog-like, oxygen-free environment within the graves. This practice may have been stimulated by cultural influence from Egypt, as it coincided with the appearance of Egyptian artefacts in Scandinavia and the appearance of Baltic amber in Egypt (e.g. in the tomb of Tutankhamun). However, intentional mummification within oak coffin burials has also been noted in Britain at an earlier date (c. 2300 BC).

A fundamental change in burial customs took place at the turn from the Older to the Younger Bronze Age. After a long period of inhumation burials, people gradually switched to cremation burials. During Period III of the Early Bronze Age (1300-1100 BCE), cremated remains were still buried in the old tradition in elongated pits or tree/oak coffins. With the beginning of the Later Bronze Age (Period IV, 1100-900 BCE), urn burials became established, although for a long time they were still placed in and around barrows. It was not until the seventh century that the first urn fields were created. Researchers used to think that urnfields appeared at the beginning of the Iron Age, around 530 BCE, but new findings from a group of researchers at the Collaborative Research Centre 1266 at the University of Kiel show that this happened a century earlier than previously thought.

The Late Bronze Age King&#x27;s Grave of Seddin in northern Germany (9th century BC) has been described as a &quot;Homeric burial&quot; due to its close similarity to contemporary elite burials in Greece and Italy.

===Agriculture===
In the Nordic Bronze Age, both agriculture (including cultivation of wheat, millet, and barley) and animal husbandry (keeping of domesticated animals such as cattle, sheep and pigs) were practiced. Fishing and hunting were also sources of food, which included shellfish, deer, elk, and other wild animals. There is evidence that oxen were used as draught animals; domesticated dogs were common, but horses were rarer and probably status symbols.

===Metalwork===
Scandinavian Bronze Age sites present a rich and well-preserved legacy of bronze and gold objects. These valuable metals were all imported, primarily from Central Europe, but they were often crafted locally and the craftsmanship and metallurgy of the Nordic Bronze Age was of a high standard. The lost-wax casting method was used to produce artefacts such as the Trundholm Sun Chariot and the Langstrup belt plate. The archaeological legacy also encompasses locally crafted wool and wooden objects.

During the 15th and 14th centuries BC, southern Scandinavia produced and deposited more elaborate bronzes in graves and hoards than any other region of Europe. As regards the number and density of metal deposits, the Nordic Bronze Age became the richest culture in Europe. More Bronze Age swords have also been found in Denmark than anywhere else in Europe. Uniform crucibles found at metal workshop sites further indicate the mass production of certain metal artefacts.

=== Rock carvings ===
The west coast of Sweden, namely Bohuslän, has the largest concentration of Bronze Age rock carvings in Scandinavia; and Scandinavia has the largest number of Bronze Age rock carvings in Europe. The west coast of Sweden is home to around 1,500 recorded rock engraving sites, with more being discovered every year. When the rock carvings were made, the area was the coastline; but it is now 25 meters above sea level. The engravings in the region depict everyday life, weapons, human figures, fishing nets, ships, chariots, plows, the sun, deer, bulls, horses, and birds. By far, the most dominant theme is human figures and ships, especially ships — 10,000 of which have recorded. The typical ship depicts a crew of six to thirteen. Rock carvings in the late Bronze Age, and even the early Iron Age, often depict conflict, power, and mobility.

===Warrior ethos===
The culture of the Nordic Bronze Age was that of a warrior culture, with a strong emphasis on weapons and status. Helle Vandkilde of Aarhus University, in her publications from 1995, describes most men of the period as having followed a warrior ethos. More than 70% of burials dating to the Nordic Bronze Age contain metal objects of various kinds, the most common objects being swords and daggers. It is noted that the people of the Nordic Bronze Age also placed great importance on helmets of intricate design, which they put much effort into making. However, not all of the weapons and armour of the Nordic Bronze Age were used for warfare. Some of them are believed to have been ceremonial, especially the helmets.

Despite the importance of weapons in their society, archaeological discoveries suggest that intrasocietal violence was not particularly common in the Nordic Bronze Age, especially not when compared to contemporary European Bronze Age cultures. The people of the Nordic Bronze Age seem to instead have been directing their military efforts outwards, likely against people of neighbouring cultures, and are believed to have participated in battles along the Amber Road and other trade routes that were important for the continuous prosperity of their society.

Many of the stone carvings from the Nordic Bronze Age depict boats in great numbers as well as groups of armed men manning the boats. Finds such as the Hjortspring boat, among others, give further credence to the theory that Bronze Age people in Scandinavia relied heavily on naval dominance of the waters surrounding their region in order to secure trade and safety.

Ancient DNA and archaeological evidence indicates that people from the Nordic Bronze Age sphere were involved in the conflict at the Tollense valley battlefield in northern Germany (13th century BC), &quot;the largest excavated and archaeologically verifiable battle site of this age in the world&quot;.

===International contacts===
The beginning of metal production and increased exchnnage appears at around 2100 BCE, when copper was imported from Slovakia via central Germany, and tin from the British Isles. The triangular network is relevant for a few centuries during the Late Neolithic (2250-1700 BCE) and the beginning of the Early Bronze Age (1700-1600 BCE). This triangular network is slightly older, as shown by the distribution of straight-walled cups in Denmark and central Germany/Bohemia, and Scandinavian flint axes found on the British Isles.

The Nordic Bronze Age maintained intimate trade links with the Tumulus culture and Mycenaean Greece. The Nordic Bronze Age exported amber through the Amber Road, and imported metals in return. During the time of the Nordic Bronze Age, metals, such as copper, tin and gold, were imported into Scandinavia on a massive scale. Copper was imported from Sardinia, Iberia and Cyprus. The trade network was briefly disrupted during the Late Bronze Age collapse in the 12th century BC.

Evidence for horse-drawn chariots appears in Scandinavia , around the same time or earlier than it appears in Greece. In both cases the chariots appear to have come from the region of the Carpathian Basin or the western steppe. Cheek-pieces and whip handles in Denmark dating from this time feature curvilinear &#x27;wave-band&#x27; designs that are also found on contemporary artefacts from the Carpathian Basin and Greece, including in the elite shaft graves at Mycenae. These designs subsequently appear on Nordic Bronze Age metalwork, including on the gold disc of the Trundholm Sun Chariot. Engraved depictions of chariots appear in Scandinavian rock art from onwards, as they do on engraved stone stelae from Mycenae. The introduction of the chariot in Scandinavia coincided with the introduction of socketed spearheads, whose ultimate origin Vandkilde (2014) ascribes to the Seima-Turbino culture. Cheek-pieces and belt hooks adorned with horse heads are suggested to have originated from the Carpathian Basin, making their way into Scandinavia.

Chariot wheels in Scandinavia are depicted with four spokes, as in Mycenaean Greece and the Carpathian Basin. A depiction of a two-wheeled vehicle with four-spoked wheels is also known from Kültepe in Central Anatolia, dating from , concurrent with the appearance of steppe horses in this region. In contrast, chariot wheels from the Sintashta culture and Andronovo cultures near the Urals had more than four spokes. Miniature spoked-wheel models have been found in the Carpathian Basin dating to the 20th–19th centuries BC, and cheek-pieces are known there from c. 2000 BC. According to Maran (2020, 2014) chariots probably originated &quot;in the entire zone between the Carpathian Basin and the Southern Ural&quot;, rather than just in the Ural region, and spread southwards from there to Greece and the Near East. In the case of Greece this is given some support by analyses of skeletal material from the shaft graves at Mycenae, which also indicate connections to the north. Chechushkov &amp; Epimakhov (2018) suggest that chariot technology developed before 2000 BC in the Don-Volga interfluve, in the context of pre-Sintashta cultures (such as the Abashevo culture).

According to Kristiansen and Larsson (2005), &quot;foreign origins were most consciously demonstrated in the formation of the Nordic Bronze Age Culture from 1500 BC onwards, basing itself on a Minoan/Mycenaean template.&quot; During the 15th–14th centuries BC the Nordic Bronze Age and Mycenaean Greece shared the use of similar flange-hilted swords, as well as select elements of shared lifestyle, such as campstools, drinking vessels decorated with solar symbols, and tools for body care including razors and tweezers. This &quot;Mycenaean package&quot;, including spiral decoration, was directly adopted in southern Scandinavia after 1500 BC, creating &quot;a specific and selective Nordic variety of Mycenaean high culture&quot; that was not adopted in the intermediate region of Central Europe. These similarities can not have come about without intimate contacts, probably through the travels of warriors and mercenaries. Archaeological evidence further indicates the existence in both regions of shared institutions linked to warriors. Specifically, the dual organisation of leadership between a &quot;Wanax&quot; (ritual chief) and a &quot;Lawagetas&quot; (warrior chief) in Mycenaean Greece was apparently replicated in the Nordic Bronze Age. However this dual organization may have also been part of a shared Indo-European tradition. Other similarities have been noted in artistic iconography from both regions and its associated cosmology. Some of the contacts between Scandinavia and Greece were probably conveyed through Central Europe. 

Cultural connections with the Hittites have also been suggested. These include a sign or symbol akin to the Hittite hieroglyph meaning ‘divine’ found among the rock carvings at Fossum in Sweden, associated with possible images of divinities. According to Kristiansen &amp; Larsson (2005), &quot;From the eighteenth century BC until the beginning of the fifteenth century BC networks were operating between the Hittites, the steppe and the Carpathians, with direct link to northern Europe. During this period basic institutions were transmitted north in exchange for amber and horses, while at the same time the institution of chariotry was transmitted south from the steppe&quot;.

Trade and cultural contacts have also been noted between the Nordic Bronze Age and New Kingdom Egypt.

The contacts during the Late Bronze Age (period IV–VI) were more intensive with Central Europe and Italy. A lot of similarities are seen in art and iconography between different continental Urnfield cultures and the Hallstatt culture. Copper was imported from Central Europe and Italy.

===Religion and cult===
There is no coherent knowledge about the Nordic Bronze Age religion, its pantheon, world view, and how it was practised. Written sources are lacking, but archaeological finds draw a vague and fragmented picture of the religious practices and the nature of the religion in this period. Only some possible sects and only certain possible tribes are known. Some of the best clues come from tumuli, elaborate artifacts, votive offerings, and rock carvings scattered across Northern Europe. There are many rock carving sites from this period. The rock carvings have been dated through comparison with depicted artifacts, for example bronze axes and swords. Many rock carvings are uncanny in resemblance to those found in the Corded Ware culture. There are also numerous Nordic Stone Age rock carvings, those of northern Scandinavia mostly portray elk.

Many finds, especially rock carvings, indicate sun worship was central to the religion. The Sun, when personified, was conceived of as female and associated with various objects, like the swastika, sun cross, and boats, and animals such as horses, birds, snakes, and fish (see also &quot;Sól&quot;), though snakes may only have been associated with the Sun by one group of religious specialists, as seen on their razors; otherwise the myths depicted on rock carvings seem to indicate the opposite, that snakes were the enemy of the Sun. During the day, the Sun is thought to be transported by horse or by boat, then at night embarks a night ship to be transported in at night, switching for a day ship or horse afterwards, repeating this process every night and day in its journey.

A pair of male twin gods are believed to have been worshiped in close conjunction with the sun goddess and were associated with objects such as lurs, horned helmets, and weapons, particularly axes and swords. Where sacrificial artifacts have been buried, they are often found in pairs and paired objects, like boats, are very common on rock carvings. The horned helmets found in sacrificial deposits are thought to be purely ceremonial and to have no practical function, i.e. in actual warfare. The Divine Twins are thought to be the protectors of the sun, ensuring its safe passage through the night so it can rise again in the morning and make its usual path across the daylit sky, repeating this every night and day.

Jeanette Varberg has proposed, in light of archaeological evidence pairing horse gear with women&#x27;s ornaments (and wagons), that there may have been a goddess associated with war and horses that was worshiped in the Late Bronze Age which she calls the Lady of the Battle and of the Horse.

Sacrifices, including of animals, weapons, jewellery, and humans, often had a strong connection to bodies of water. Water bodies such as bogs, ponds, streams, and lakes were often used as ceremonial and holy places for sacrifices and many artifacts have been found in such locations. Ritual instruments such as bronze lurs have been uncovered, especially in the region of Denmark and western Sweden. Lurs are also depicted in several rock carvings and are believed to have been used in ceremonies.

Nordic Bronze Age religion and mythology is believed to be mostly Indo-European in character and to itself be the ancestor to Norse mythology and religion and wider Germanic mythology and religion.

Similarities have been noted between Nordic Bronze Age imagery and the Nebra Sky Disc from central Germany associated with the Únětice culture.

===Seamanship===
Thousands of rock carvings from the Nordic Bronze Age depict ships, and the large stone burial monuments known as stone ships. Those sites suggest that ships and seafaring played an important role in the culture at large. The depicted ships, most likely represents sewn plank built canoes used for warfare, fishing and trade. These ship types may have their origin as far back as the neolithic period and they continue into the Pre-Roman Iron Age, as exemplified by the Hjortspring boat. 3,600-year-old bronze axes and other tools made from Cypriot copper have been found in the region.

Researchers note that there is great continuity in the way that ships continuously had a strong importance in Scandinavian society. The boat building and seafaring traditions that were established during the Nordic Bronze Age lasted throughout the ages and were further developed upon during the Iron Age. Some archaeologists and historians believe that the culmination of this sea-focused culture was the Viking Age.

==Climate==
The Nordic Bronze Age was initially characterized by a warm climate that began with a climate change around 2700 BC. The climate was comparable to that of present-day central Germany and northern France and permitted a fairly dense population and good opportunities for farming; for example, grapes were grown in Scandinavia at this time. A minor change in climate occurred between 850 BC and 760 BC, introducing a wetter, colder climate and a more radical climate change began around 650 BC.

== Genetics ==

A June 2015 study published in Nature found the people of the Nordic Bronze Age to be closely genetically related to the Corded Ware culture, the Beaker culture and the Unetice culture. People of the Nordic Bronze Age and Corded Ware show the highest lactose tolerance among Bronze Age Europeans. The study suggested that the Sintashta culture, and its succeeding Andronovo culture, represented an eastward migration of Corded Ware peoples. 

In the June 2015 study, the remains of nine individuals of the Northern Bronze Age and earlier Neolithic cultures in Denmark and Sweden from ca. 2850 BC to 500 BC, were analyzed. Among the Neolithic individuals, the three males were found to be carrying haplogroup I1, R1a1a1 and R1b1a1a2a1a1. Among the individuals from the Nordic Bronze Age, two males carried I1, while two carried R1b1a1a2.

A 2024 study published in Nature analyzed around 40 individuals from Late Neolithic and Bronze Age Southern Scandinavia. The study found evidence for three distinct genetic clusters:

LNBA phase I - Dated to 4,600 and 4,300 cal. bp and archaeologically associated with the Battle Axe culture and early Single Grave culture. The males in the LNBA phase I cluster belonged to haplogroup R1a.

LNBA phase II - Dated to 4,300–3,700 cal. bp and archaeologically associated with the Flint Dagger period (c. 2300-2000 BC). The males in the LNBA phase II cluster belonged to haplogroup R1b.

LNBA phase III - A final stage from around 4,000 cal. bp onwards, in which a distinct cluster of Scandinavian individuals dominated by males with I1 Y-haplogroups appears. Archaeologically associated with a migration of people from the north or northeast and the emergence of stone cist burials, leading to the start of the Nordic Bronze Age. The study found that the LNBA phase III cluster forms the predominant source in supervised ancestry modelling for future populations in Iron Age Scandinavia and Viking Age Scandinavia, as well as non-Scandinavian populations with Scandinavian or Germanic association, for example Anglo-Saxons and Goths. These findings are in accordance with the archaeological and linguistic associations of the Nordic Bronze Age with early Germanic speakers.

<text>Zdzisław Ludwik Krzyszkowiak (; 3 August 1929 – 23 March 2003) was a Polish track and field athlete, winner of the 3000 metre steeplechase at the 1960 Summer Olympics.

Born in Wielichowo, Greater Poland Voivodeship, Krzyszkowiak won 13 Polish National Championship titles in long-distance and cross-country events.

Krzyszkowiak rose to the international athletics scene at the 1956 Summer Olympics, where he missed the bronze medal in the 10,000 metres by 7.4 seconds, finishing fourth. At the 1958 European Championships in Athletics, Krzyszkowiak established himself as one of the best European long distance runners by winning both the 5000 and 10,000 metres. In 1958, he became the first winner of the European Sportsperson of the Year conferred by the Polish Press Agency.

Just two months before the Rome Olympics, Krzyszkowiak ran his first world record, clocking 8:31.4 in the 3000 m steeplechase. At the Olympics itself, Krzyszkowiak finished seventh in the 10,000 m, but won, as a main favourite, the 3000 m steeplechase.

After the Olympics, Krzyszkowiak decided to concentrate on the 3000 m steeplechase event, running his second world record in 1961, but was forced to retire from sports prematurely in 1963 due to injuries. After his running career, he worked as a coach.

Zdzisław Krzyszkowiak died in Warsaw, aged 73.

Zdzisław Krzyszkowiak Stadium in Bydgoszcz was named in his honor.

<text>Socratic dialogue () is a genre of literary prose developed in Greece at the turn of the fourth century BC. The earliest ones are preserved in the works of Plato and Xenophon and all involve Socrates as the protagonist. These dialogues, and subsequent ones in the genre, present a discussion of moral and philosophical problems between two or more individuals illustrating the application of the Socratic method. The dialogues may be either dramatic or narrative. While Socrates is often the main participant, his presence in the dialogue is not essential to the genre.

==Platonic dialogues==
Most of the Socratic dialogues referred to today are those of Plato. Platonic dialogues defined the literary genre subsequent philosophers used. Plato wrote approximately 35 dialogues, in most of which Socrates is the main character.

The protagonist of each dialogue, both in Plato&#x27;s and Xenophon&#x27;s work, usually is Socrates who by means of a kind of interrogation tries to find out more about the other person&#x27;s understanding of moral issues. In the dialogues Socrates presents himself as a simple man who confesses that he has little knowledge. With this ironic approach he manages to confuse the other who boasts that he is an expert in the domain they discuss. The outcome of the dialogue is that Socrates demonstrates that the other person&#x27;s views are inconsistent. In this way Socrates tries to show the way to real wisdom. One of his most famous statements in that regard is &quot;The unexamined life is not worth living.&quot; This philosophical questioning is known as the Socratic method.

Strictly speaking, the term &quot;Socratic dialogue&quot; refers to works in which Socrates is a character. As a genre, however, other texts are included; Plato&#x27;s &quot;Laws&quot; and Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Hiero&quot; are Socratic dialogues in which a wise man other than Socrates leads the discussion (the Athenian Stranger and Simonides, respectively). In some dialogues, Plato&#x27;s main character is not Socrates but someone from outside of Athens. In Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Hiero&quot; a certain &quot;Simonides&quot; plays this role when Socrates is not the protagonist.

Generally, the works which are most often assigned to Plato&#x27;s early years are all considered to be Socratic dialogues (written from 399 to 387). Many of his middle dialogues (written from 387 to 361, after the establishment of his Academy), and later dialogues (written in the period between 361 and his death in 347) incorporate Socrates&#x27; character and are often included here as well. However, this interpretation of the corpus is not universally accepted. The time that Plato began to write his works and the date of composition of his last work are not known and what adds to the complexity is that even the ancient sources do not know the order of the works or the dialogues.

The complete list of the thirty-five Platonic dialogues that have been traditionally identified as authentic, as given in Diogenes Laërtius, is included below in alphabetical order. The authenticity of some of these dialogues has been questioned by some modern scholarship.

* Peter Kreeft
** This academic philosopher has published a series of Socratic dialogues in which Socrates questions famous thinkers from the distant and near past. The first of the series was &quot;Between Heaven and Hell&quot;, a dialogue between C. S. Lewis, Aldous Huxley, and John F. Kennedy. He also authored a book of Socratic logic.

<text>The Airport Express () is one of the ten rail lines of the Hong Kong MTR system (excluding the light rail network). It links the urban area with Hong Kong International Airport and the AsiaWorld–Expo exhibition and convention centre.

It is the only rail link to the airport. It runs parallel to the Tung Chung line, a rapid transit line, from Hong Kong station to just south of the channel between Lantau Island and Chek Lap Kok island, on which the airport was constructed. The line continues to the airport and terminates at AsiaWorld–Expo. The Tung Chung line terminates in the adjacent Tung Chung new town, with bus service to various areas at the airport, including the passenger terminals.

The journey from Hong Kong station to the airport takes 24 minutes. The line is coloured teal on MTR system maps.

==History==
In October 1989, the Hong Kong government decided to replace the overcrowded Kai Tak Airport, located in Kowloon, with a new airport to be constructed at Chek Lap Kok. The government invited the Mass Transit Railway Corporation to build an express line to the airport. The project began when the Chinese and British governments settled the financial and land agreements in November 1994.

During the construction, the consultants for the Lantau Airport Railway, such as Arup, Halcrow, Meinhardt, Hyder Consulting, and others.

The Lantau Airport Railway was developed as two separate MTR lines, the Tung Chung line and the Airport Express, with the two lines sharing tracks in some sections. It cost was projected to cost HK$35.1 billion. The Airport Express began service on 6 July 1998, the opening date of the new Hong Kong International Airport. The line initially terminated at Airport station and the entire journey time was 23 minutes.

With the opening of Sunny Bay station on the Tung Chung line in June 2005, the total journey time between the Airport and Hong Kong stations was increased to 24 minutes. With the opening of AsiaWorld–Expo, the line was extended to AsiaWorld–Expo station on 20 December 2005 and a journey on the entire route takes 28 minutes.

==Route==
The Airport Express line runs from Hong Kong station in Central. It crosses beneath Victoria Harbour before stopping at Kowloon station, which was built on reclaimed land. The line then runs along the western side of the Kowloon peninsula, crosses over the Rambler Channel rail bridge to Tsing Yi, and stops at Tsing Yi station. The line continues on the Lantau Link and runs parallel to the North Lantau Highway to Airport station before terminating at AsiaWorld–Expo station.

The line only shares tracks with the Tung Chung line in the cross-harbour tunnel and from the Lantau Link through the split before reaching the airport island. The two lines have independent tracks and platforms at all stations.

The Airport Express offers more spacious and comfortable trains and stations than other MTR services. On the trains, there are luggage racks next to each door, and each seat is equipped with in-seat loudspeakers for current news, advertisements and announcements shown on LCD televisions in front.

===In-town check-in===
Airport Express passengers flying with Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong Airlines, Qantas or Singapore Airlines are able to use the in-town check-in service at Hong Kong Station or Kowloon Station (Hong Kong Station only for Singapore Airlines passengers). This includes receiving boarding passes, and checking in luggage, both services usually performed at the airport. This allows travellers to spend time in the city without having to carry their luggage before travelling to the airport bags-free. Each train has a special baggage container car and the checked baggage is scanned in bulk by a mechanised automatic explosive detection system. Upon reaching the airport, baggage is automatically transferred from the express to the traveller&#x27;s flight. In-town check in used to be offered for a greater variety of airlines at both Hong Kong and Kowloon stations, but this has been partially suspended since the COVID-19 pandemic travel disruptions.

Baggage trolleys, wide fare gates, and free porter services are available at all stations except AsiaWorld–Expo to assist passengers with baggage.

===Shuttle bus service===
The Airport Express Shuttle Bus is a free service provided exclusively for Airport Express passengers at Hong Kong or Kowloon stations, connecting them with major hotels in the Western District though Quarry Bay on Hong Kong Island and the Yau Tsim Mong District and Hung Hom station in Kowloon. Before boarding, proof of eligibility must be shown, including Airport Express train ticket (Single Journey, Same Day Return, Round Trip, Airport Express Travel Pass), Airline ticket / boarding pass, Airport Staff Octopus card, AsiaWorld–Expo entry pass or event ticket.

The Airport Express Shuttle Bus service was discontinued from 30 June 2020 due to low ridership caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of July 2024, the service has been reinstated, providing services to a limited number of hotels in the Hong Kong and Kowloon areas.

===On-board WiFi and charging service===
WiFi is available on all Airport Express cars, while USB ports and power points are available in the first and last cars.

==Graphic identity==
The Airport Express visual identity, which includes the logo, vehicle livery, signage, route maps and passenger information, was created in 1999 by Lloyd Northover, the British design consultancy founded by John Lloyd and Jim Northover.

==Fare structure==
Fares on the Airport Express are substantially higher than main line fares; a separate fare system is used for this line. Single trip or same-day return trips between the Hong Kong, Kowloon and Tsing Yi stations to Airport station cost HK$115, HK$105 and HK$70 respectively. Return tickets within 30 days cost HK$205, HK$185, and HK$120 respectively. Tickets are available at all MTR stations and the MTR online booking service. Although there are no entry gates at Airport station, passengers must still buy tickets from the ticket machines located in the Arrivals Hall, on platform 1 of the airport before boarding the train or at destination platforms (as they will not be able to exit from their destination platform otherwise).

Various discounts and rewards programmes are available, such as Group Ticket Discount, free taxi connections, Rewarding programme, Asia Miles programme, etc. Passengers may also buy discounted tickets from local travel agents. Discounts are available for groups of two to four people. Hong Kong residents can also obtain discount coupons, such as those sent from credit card companies. Discounted fares are available to airport staff to encourage commuting on the Airport Express.

Same-day return discount will be given to Octopus card users who have stayed in AsiaWorld–Expo for at least one hour. The discounted fare costs HK$72, HK$64, and HK$42 from Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Tsing Yi stations respectively, and includes a free connection with other MTR lines. A single trip from the Airport to AsiaWorld–Expo is HK$5.

Given their separate fare structure, Airport Express journeys require an out-of-system transfer if coming from or going to other MTR lines that call at the same or connected stations (e.g. coming from Central towards Hong Kong station or transferring between Airport Express and Tung Chung line trains). However, Airport Express passengers using Octopus cards can connect with all other MTR lines for free in conjunction with the Airport Express journey within one hour of arrival at an Airport Express station.

In March 2010, the MTR began to replace the magnetic tickets used for single, group, and multiple journey tickets with new &quot;smart tickets&quot; that contain a memory chip. The new system was in full operation by 5 June 2010.

Due to the high fares and small catchment areas of the Airport Express stations, some travellers may instead choose to either use the cheaper, local Tung Chung line combined with a bus route, or make their entire journey by bus. Patronage on the Airport Express has been cannibalised by the Tung Chung line running mostly on the same track.

===Morning Express Service===
The Morning Express Service is a special promotional service, allowing passengers from Tsing Yi and Kowloon stations to travel to Hong Kong station to get to work daily (excluding Sundays and public holidays) from 7am to 10am for HK$25.
==Operation and stations==
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Airport Express services operated every 10 minutes from the start of service (05:54 from Airport and 05:50 from Hong Kong) and every 12 minutes from 23:28 (from Airport) and 00:00 (from Hong Kong) until the last service 00:48. Train service was reduced as passenger ridership was yet to completely recover. From 5 November 2022, train services ran every 15–20 minutes throughout the day. As of 30 July 2024, train services have returned to their pre-pandemic frequency and timetable, though it is unsure when this took place.

The Airport Express, along with other MTR metro lines, is monitored by the Operations Control Centre in Tsing Yi.

===Rolling stock===
The Airport Express is served by 11 CAF-Stock trains built and assembled by Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles in Spain while Adtranz contributed control and traction equipment. These trains were made up of seven cars until 2003. To cope with the extra traffic demand derived from the opening of AsiaWorld-Expo station, an additional car was added to each train to form a total of eight cars. If future demand increases, trains on the AEL are capable of running with ten cars. In service, the trains travel at a maximum speed of .

The train interiors saw their first refurbishment in 2008, after ten years in service. The grey seat covers were replaced with purple and green ones, and a new indigo carpet was installed. The interior was updated yet again in 2020, and new seat covers featuring the blue and aquamarine AEL logos and a grey wave pattern will be paired with synthetic leather head rests.

==Use in media==
In late 1998, Leon Lai showed a music video of MTR&#x27;s Airport Express line for the song &quot;Happy 2000&quot;, which includes the interior of the A-Train.

In the film &quot;Shock Wave 2&quot;, a CAF-Train of the Airport Express was hijacked and planted with bombs, afterwards one of the terrorists drove it towards Hong Kong International Airport.

==Design limitations==
When British Hong Kong was planning to build the Airport Railway (Tung Chung line and Airport Express) in the 1990s, a few years before the planned handover to China, the Chinese government raised concerns about the effect of the project on the territory&#x27;s fiscal reserves, which eventually forced the (British) Hong Kong government to reduce the cost of the Airport Railway. The resulting changes made imposed design limitations on the level of service on the line.

* The airport rail link was originally designed to accommodate four tracks, two each for the Airport Express and Tung Chung line. It was later reduced to two tracks where both services share the same trackage. As a result, signal failures can affect both services.
* The Lantau Link section of the line (consisting of the Tsing Ma Bridge, Ma Wan Viaduct, and Kap Shui Mun Bridge) only allows one train to pass through each direction at the same time, raising the minimum headway between trains to 2 minutes 15 seconds.
* The signalling system is not capable of giving priority to Airport Express trains; as a result, Tung Chung line trains stopping at Sunny Bay station frequently impede Airport Express trains, which do not serve the station.
* The power supply system restricts the number of trains running between Kowloon and Lai King stations. The system can accommodate a maximum of one Airport Express train and two Tung Chung trains travelling in both directions at one time. The minimum headway on this section of the line is 3 minutes 30 seconds.

<doc id="1021580" wikidata="Q1096617" url="?curid=1021580" title="Plain swift">
<text>The plain swift (Apus unicolor) is a medium-sized swift. Although this bird is superficially similar to a barn swallow or house martin, it is not related to those passerine species. The resemblances between the groups are due to convergent evolution reflecting similar life styles.

Swifts have very short legs that they use only for clinging to vertical surfaces. They never settle voluntarily on the ground, and spend most of their lives in the air, feeding on insects that they catch in their beaks. They drink on the wing.

Plain swifts breed in colonies on cliffs, bridges and buildings on the Canary Islands and Madeira, laying two eggs in a saucer-shaped nest made of flowerheads glued with saliva. They are partially migratory, with many birds leaving to winter in mainland Africa. Until recently it was thought that the birds wintered on the African coast but recent studies suggest they travel much further to the equatorial forests of Liberia and Guinea, a distance of 2,600 kilometres. Small numbers are also believed to breed in Morocco between Agadir and Essaouira, where a colony was found on coastal cliffs and possibly also in Mauritania where there are frequent sightings. 

This 14–15 cm long species is very similar to the closely related common and pallid swifts, which also occur in the archipelagos, and separation is only possible with good views. Like its relatives, it has a short forked tail and very long swept-back wings that resemble a crescent or a boomerang.

It is entirely dark except for an indistinct pale throat patch. It is slimmer and more rakish than the pallid swift, and is darker than that species and lacks the obvious white throat.

Distinguishing the plain swift from the similarly plumaged common swift is much more difficult, although juvenile common can be easily eliminated due to its white throat. The plain is slimmer and appears longer winged than the common, and has scaly underparts, difficult to see except with excellent views. The call is a loud dry scream similar to that of the common swift, though possibly higher pitched.

<text>Animal Free Research UK (AFRUK), formerly the Dr Hadwen Trust, is a UK medical research charity that funds and promotes non-animal techniques to replace animal experiments. Established in 1970, the work undertaken by Animal Free Research UK develops reliable science whilst avoiding animal testing.

==History==

Animal Free Research UK was established as the Dr Hadwen Trust for Humane Research in 1970 (registered charity number 261096). It was formed by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) in honour of its former president, Walter Hadwen. In 1980, Dr Hadwen Trust split from BUAV and became an independent charity.

The charity became incorporated as a charitable company (registered charity number 1146896) in 2013. In 2015, the Dr Hadwen Trust became registered as a charity in Scotland (SC045327). In April 2017, the charity changed its working name from Dr Hadwen Trust to become Animal Free Research UK.

Animal Free Research UK promotes the practice of non-animal research through its funding, publications, science community outreach, and the media. Its purpose is to &quot;support scientists to transition from using animals to using new approach methodologies in medical research&quot;.

== Research ==
Projects receiving funding from the Dr. Hadwen Trust range from epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, breast and skin cancer, meningitis, asthma, diabetes and drug testing, to arthritis, Parkinson’s disease, lung injury, whooping cough, vaccine testing, dentistry, heart disease, tropical illness, fetal development, brain tumours, and AIDS.

Funding is received in the form of summer studentships, PhD students, post-docs, and strategic grants.

<doc id="1021596" wikidata="Q3978595" url="?curid=1021596" title="Swayback">
<text>Swayback, also known clinically as lordosis, refers to abnormally bent postures in the backs of humans and of quadrupeds, especially horses. Extreme lordosis can cause physical damage to the spinal cord and associated ligaments and tendons which can lead to severe pain. In horses, moderate lordosis does not generally impact an animal&#x27;s usefulness and does not necessarily cause lameness.

==Humans==
Swayback posture in humans is characterised by the posterior displacement of the rib cage in comparison to the pelvis. It looks like the person has a hyperextension of the lower back, however this is not necessarily the case. Most sway-back exhibits a posteriorly tilted pelvis; the lumbar region is usually flat (too flexed) and not hyperlordotic (too extended).

==Horses==

Usually called &quot;swayback&quot;, soft back, or low back, an excessive downward bend in the back is an undesirable conformation trait. Swayback is caused in part from a loss of muscle tone in both the back and abdominal muscles, plus a weakening and stretching of the ligaments. As in humans, it may be influenced by bearing young; it is sometimes seen in a broodmare that has had multiple foals. However, it is also common in older horses whose age leads to loss of muscle tone and stretched ligaments. It also occurs due to overuse or injury to the muscles and ligaments from excess work or loads, or from premature work placed upon an immature animal. Equines with too long a back are more prone to the condition than those with a short back, but as a longer back is also linked to smoother gaits, the trait is sometimes encouraged by selective breeding. It has been found to have a hereditary basis in the American Saddlebred breed, transmitted via a recessive gene. Research into the genetics underlying the condition has several values beyond just the Saddlebred breed as it may &quot;serve as a model for investigating congenital skeletal deformities in horses and other species.&quot;

==Small ruminants==
In small ruminants (sheep, goats, deers), &quot;swayback&quot; is the common term for the enzootic ataxia, a disease in young animals due to copper deficiency in fetal and early postnatal development.

<text>Swingfire was a British wire-guided anti-tank missile developed in the 1960s and produced from 1966 until 1993. The name refers to its ability to make a rapid turn of up to ninety degrees after firing to bring it onto the line of the sighting mechanism. This means that the launcher vehicle could be concealed and the operator, using a portable sight, placed at a distance in a more advantageous firing position.

Swingfire entered operational service in 1969 and underwent several major upgrades during its time in service. It was used on a number of vehicles including the FV438, FV102 and several truck mountings including the Land Rover and Ferret armoured car. Concepts adapting it to helicopters, tanks and even hovercraft went nowhere. Swingfire remained in service on the FV102 Striker until 2005 when they were retired in favour of man-portable missiles.

==Development==
===Earlier efforts===
The British Army was among the first to introduce a heavy anti-tank missile when they introduced the Malkara in 1958. The Malkara had a number of problems, among them that the missiles had to be raised into the line of sight for firing, and the missile left a line of smoke from its rocket motor that lingered long enough to point directly back to the launcher. Additionally, the guidance system was difficult to use and had limited performance against moving targets. Malkara was nevertheless purchased for the airborne infantry to allow them to deal with Soviet armour at long range.

Desiring a more capable weapon, the Ministry of Supply funded the Orange William development at Fairey Engineering Ltd beginning in 1954. The idea behind Orange William was that the launcher and guidance systems were separated by up to , allowing the launcher to remain far behind the front line while the small and heavily camouflaged guidance vehicle moved forward where it could see the enemy. Unfortunately, testing demonstrated the selected guidance system was easily blocked by smoke and dust, making it ineffective on the battlefield. Through this same period, the Army was developing the Royal Ordnance L11 120 mm gun for the Chieftain tank, as development continued it appeared it would be able to defeat any Soviet tank design. The need for a heavyweight missile was less pressing and development of Orange William was cancelled in September 1959.

Through the same period, a much lighter man-portable weapon was also being developed, the Vickers Vigilant. Based on the experience with Malkara, Vigilant introduced a much improved guidance system. While it was still manual, requiring the gunner to watch the missile approach the target, it used a new method of sending corrections to the missile that was far easier for the gunner to use, especially against moving targets. Vigilant went on to see widespread use in several nations including the United States.

===Swingfire and TOW===
The basic idea of under-cover fire remained of interest to the Army after the cancellation of Orange William, and the Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment (RARDE) was given £250,000 a year to continue research into the basic concepts. As part of the resulting Project 12, they developed two basic concepts, Quickfire and Swingfire. The former appears to be a fast-action weapon, but few details have been made public. The latter was designed to allow it to be fired from under cover, like Orange William. As the company already had experience in the indirect fire role, and fearing it would otherwise lead to the breakup of their missile team, Fairey was issued a new development contract in October 1959.

The basic idea of the Swingfire concept was that thrust vectoring of the rocket exhaust allowed the missile to make extreme maneuvers, including a right-angle turn immediately after launch. This was especially useful in urban settings like Berlin; the gunner could take the sight up to from the launcher and position themselves along potential lines of approach, while the launcher parked down a side street or alleyways. The crew would then dial in the distance to the main line of fire and its angle relative to the launcher, and the missile would travel that distance and then turn, flying past the gunner and into his sights. The missiles could be fired without the launcher ever exposing itself to the enemy, and the gunner could easily remain hidden in a foxhole or building. While the rocket smoke would still give away the rough location of the launcher, the enemy would be unable to return fire against the hidden launcher and would have no idea where the gunner was located.

As the Warsaw Pact greatly increased its number of tanks during the 1960s, the long-range missile was once again considered important. The Soviet plan was to simply overrun NATO forces using sheer numbers, so a weapon that could attrit these forces before they reached friendly forces was highly desirable. The US Army was equally interested in such a system, and in July 1961 the two countries signed the Rubel-Zuckerman Agreement for further development. Under this plan, the US would concentrate on short-range rapid-fire weapons, while RARDE would continue Swingfire development for the long-range role. Of the several concepts studied in the US, the BGM-71 TOW was ultimately selected. TOW used a semi-automatic guidance system that was very easy to use and capable of easily tracking moving targets, but had limited accuracy in long-range use and had to fly directly at the target and thereby expose the gunner to attack.

As TOW developed, it continued to grow larger and gain more range, ultimately emerging as a much larger design similar to the Swingfire. The US suggested the British adopt the TOW, but the necessity for the tracker to be inline with the missile throughout its flight was considered completely unacceptable to the British while the US saw this as irrelevant. Any plans to introduce TOW in British service ended.

===FV438 Swingfire===

Initially, some consideration was given to adding four Swingfire missiles to the Chieftain. Their external mounting was a significant problem, and fitting them required changes to the sighting systems, none of which was inexpensive. As the Royal Ordnance L11 main gun underwent development it proved far more powerful than expected and the extra hitting power of the Swingfire was no longer seen as a benefit worth the cost.

In November 1962, GOR.1174 was issued for a light vehicle to carry Swingfire instead, selecting the FV432 as its basis. The original design called for a roof-mounted rack with two launcher tubes angled upward at about 30 degrees. This allowed the vehicle to be placed behind barriers or inside entrenchments and the missile would pop up above it to clear the barrier. Aiming was accomplished either by the remote sight or one permanently mounted on a periscopic extension on top of the vehicle that allowed it to see over any fortifications in front. The launchers were mounted on a hinge at the rear that allowed them to be lowered for reloading. It swung through an angle of 45 degrees so the front was pointed slightly downward when lowered to allow the loader easy access to the front of the tubes from inside the vehicle. On firing, the rocket exhaust was directed forward through the tube, thereby eliminating any danger to troops near the vehicle.

The forward-firing rocket blast proved so powerful that it sometimes damaged the control wires or the missile itself. In one test, a simulated hangfire caused a fire that continued burning for three minutes and was believed it would have burned through the launcher and into the vehicle had it not been put out by a fire crew. The forward-exhaust concept was abandoned and a new launcher with open ports at the end of each tube was adopted. On launch, the exhaust hit the rear section of the vehicle deck and was deflected and spread out to a degree. Another change was that the two tubes were now separately mounted, instead of sharing a common hinge, which allowed one to be lowered for reload while the other was still in firing position.

===Prototype problems===
During testing, the system proved to have a huge number of minor problems and continually failed. It was not until 1969 that the system was considered even partially usable and the missiles began to work reliably.

A significant problem was due to the rocket smoke. Previous missile designs like Malkara had left a smoke trail pointing directly back to the launcher which could then be attacked. Swingfire didn&#x27;t need to be concerned about the smoke because the launcher itself would be hidden, so little effort was expended on using a lower-smoke design. However, in testing, it was found that the smoke was thick enough to obscure the missile or the target. This was especially a problem at long range when the missile was being viewed through the entire column of smoke. This made aiming at long range largely a matter of luck, and as a result the accuracy proved to be below specifications.

The missile was initially presented to the Army for acceptance in July 1969. and on 28 July they initially rejected it until additional corrections were made. They also found the training systems were inadequate. The new owners of the system, British Aerospace, agreed to make several changes to the design, and the Army eventually accepted the design on a provision basis in August.

===FV102 Striker===

In 1960, the Army launched the Armored Vehicle Reconnaissance (AVR) program for a light tracked reconnaissance vehicle. The initial concept called for a single turret mounting both a gun and missiles, presumably Swingfire. However, attempts to design such a turret for a vehicle light enough for the requirements proved impossible and the project was cancelled in 1964.

In its place, an even lighter aluminium armoured vehicle was designed, the Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked), or CVR(T). This differed from AVR primarily in abandoning the single turret concept and using mission-specific turrets on different vehicles. The most widely produced version was the FV101 Scorpion which mounted the 76 mm L23A1 gun firing HESH rounds capable of destroying most armoured vehicles, but not main battle tanks.

For the heavy anti-tank role, the FV102 Striker was designed, initially with a rotating turret mounting two Swingfire missiles on either side of the optics in the centre. However, this concept was seen as flawed as there was no need to rotate Swingfire to point at the target, so a new version was designed with five launcher tubes in a box along the rear of the vehicle. Another five rounds are stored in the vehicle, and like FV438, the tubes can be reloaded by lowering the tubes but the rounds have to be inserted from outside the vehicle.

===Upgrades===
The problem with the rocket exhaust became evident during the period in which new low-smoke solid rocket motors were being developed in the US and Canada, and the company agreed to develop a new motor for Swingfire to be available for 1972. Another lingering problem was that the gyro which kept the missile flying level tended to drift, but this was corrected simply by angling the launch tubes up more.

A larger upgrade was the &quot;Swingfire Improved Guidance&quot;, or SWIG. This added an infrared tracker to the vehicle optics that tracked the rocket motor exhaust and sent the correct commands to the missile to bring it inline with the sights. This was the same basic system used on the TOW. This makes missile guidance much easier as the gunner simply has to keep their sight pointed at the target and does not have to make any corrections themselves.

Barr &amp; Stroud introduced an infrared spotting scope that was evaluated by the Army in 1982. This led to a 1984 purchase of 3,500 sights. British Aerospace later introduced a thermal imaging sight that gave the missile much better night time performance.

Swingfire was developed by Fairey Engineering Ltd and the British Aircraft Corporation, together with Wallop Industries Ltd and minor subcontractors. It replaced the Vickers Vigilant missile in British service.

Besides its use on the FV438 Swingfire and the Striker armoured vehicles, Swingfire was developed to be launched from other platforms:
* FV712, Mk 5 Ferret with 4 missiles in use with the British Army
* &quot;Beeswing&quot; – pallet that can be mounted on a Land Rover or similar.
* &quot;Hawkswing&quot; – on a Lynx helicopter.
* &quot;Golfswing&quot; – on a small trolley or Argocat vehicle.

==Combat history==
Swingfire was used in the Gulf War.

==Replacement in British Army==
After a lengthy debate, the Swingfire was replaced with the Javelin in mid-2005 to meet new and changing situational requirements. The British Army invested heavily in the Javelin, and it is now the main heavy anti-tank missile system in use by the British Army.

<text>UK rap, also known as British hip hop or UK hip hop, is a music genre and culture that covers a variety of styles of hip hop music made in the United Kingdom. It is generally classified as one of a number of styles of R&amp;B/hip-hop. British hip hop can also be referred to as Brit-hop, a term coined and popularised mainly by &quot;British Vogue&quot; magazine and the BBC. British hip hop was originally influenced by the dub/toasting introduced to the United Kingdom by Jamaican migrants in the 1950s–70s, who eventually developed uniquely influenced rapping (or speed-toasting) in order to match the rhythm of the ever-increasing pace and aggression of Jamaican-influenced dub in the UK. Toasting and soundsystem cultures were also influential in genres outside of hip hop that still included rapping – such as grime, jungle, and UK garage.

In 2003, &quot;The Times&quot; described British hip hop&#x27;s broad-ranging approach:

...&quot;UK hip-hop&quot; is a broad sonic church, encompassing anything made in Britain by musicians informed or inspired by hip-hop&#x27;s possibilities, whose music is a response to the same stimuli that gave birth to rap in New York in the mid-Seventies.Although the underground scene was well established by the late 1980s, UK rap music saw little commercial success for several decades. Outside of a few exceptions such as Derek B and later the birth of trip-hop, from the 1980s until the early 2010s UK rap made up a small percentage of album sales in the domestic market. Performers saw wider success in the 2020s, including Stormzy headlining Glastonbury Festival, Dave releasing back-to-back UK number one albums with &quot;Psychodrama&quot; followed by &quot;We&#x27;re All Alone in This Together&quot;, and Little Simz winning the Mercury Prize.

==History==
===Origins===
As in the US, British hip hop emerged as a scene from graffiti and breakdancing, and then through to DJing and rapping live at parties and club nights, with its supporters predominantly listening to and influenced by US hip hop. Unlike in the US, the British hip hop scene was cross-racial from the beginning, as diverse ethnic groups in Britain tend not to live in segregated areas, even in areas with a high percentage of non-white individuals. Such places allow youth to share culture with one another, including musical genres such as hip hop.

Cross pollination through migrating West Indians helped develop a community interested in the music. The integration of sound systems represent a distinct British Caribbean influence. Sound systems allowed for powerful syncopated bass runs and the ability to bring this sound to other venues creating a club culture. There were, however, British tunes starting to appear. There are an abundance of records that are often credited with being the first British hip hop release, &quot;Christmas Rapping&quot; by Dizzy Heights (Polydor, 1982), is often credited as such, as well as the slightly later released &quot;London Bridge&quot; by Newtrament (Jive Records, 1983). Dizzy Heights was the first MC to be signed to a major label. Two singles from 1980 precede both of these however, namely Allen &amp; Blewitt&#x27;s novelty record &quot;Chip Shop Wrapping&quot;, released in 1980, a parody of The Sugarhill Gang&#x27;s &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot;, and Bo Kool&#x27;s &quot;Money (No Love)&quot;. The instrumental for &quot;Money (No Love)&quot; was produced by Funk Masters member Tony Williams, and would turn out to be an influential release in its own right, going on to inspire DJ&#x27;s from New York to employ influences from dub music.

In Scotland, actor and stand-up comedian Johnny Beattie released &quot;The Glasgow Rap&quot; in 1983, receiving some chart success at the time. He later claimed to be &quot;Scotland&#x27;s first rap star&quot;. This was one of several British novelty or comedy hip-hop singles which hit the UK charts during the 1980s, including &quot;Wikka Wrap&quot; by the Evasions, &quot;Snot Rap&quot; by Kenny Everett, &quot;&#x27;Ullo John! Gotta New Motor?&quot; by Alexei Sayle, &quot;Rat Rappin&#x27;&quot; by Roland Rat, and later in the decade, &quot;Stutter Rap (No Sleep til Bedtime)&quot; by Morris Minor and the Majors and &quot;Loadsamoney&quot; by Harry Enfield.

There were also early pop records which dabbled with rap – such as Adam and the Ants&#x27; &quot;Ant Rap&quot; (CBS, 1981) and Wham!&#x27;s &quot;Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do)&quot; (Inner Vision, 1982) — but these are often considered pop appropriations of US rap. Punk band the Clash had earlier dabbled with rap on the single &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; from their album &quot;Sandinista!&quot; (CBS, 1980), and a later single &quot;This Is Radio Clash&quot; (1981). Even earlier than this, in 1979, Ian Dury and the Blockheads released &quot;Reasons to Be Cheerful (Part 3)&quot;, another record with influences from hip hop.

Then Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren&#x27;s &quot;Buffalo Gals&quot; (Charisma, 1982), featuring the New York hip hop group World&#x27;s Famous Supreme Team, was the breakthrough hit that introduced the genre to the United Kingdom — McLaren&#x27;s &quot;Duck Rock&quot; album as a whole experimented with many musical styles from around the world. &quot;Buffalo Gals&quot; and another track from the album, &quot;World&#x27;s Famous&quot; which also featured the group, used techniques which have been established in hip hop in the United States, such as sampling and scratching. McLaren even included a song referencing the &#x27;Double Dutch&#x27; dance that was popular among breakdancing crews in New York at the time.

Over the next few years, more UK hip hop and electro music was released: &quot;Street Sounds Electro UK&quot; (Street Sounds, 1984), which was produced by Greg Wilson and featured an early appearance from MC Kermit, who later went on to form the Wilson produced Ruthless Rap Assassins; The Rapologists&#x27; &quot;Kids Rap/Party Rap&quot; (Billy Boy, 1984) and Grandmaster Richie Rich&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Flash&quot; (Spin Offs, 1985). Releases were still few and far between, and the scene remained predominantly underground.

Although record labels began to take note of the underground scene throughout the 1980s and 1990s, radio play and publicity were still a difficulty in helping the fledgling scene to grow, and the scene only managed to survive through word of mouth and the patronage of pirate radio stations around the country. Mainstream radio did play British hip hop on occasion, supported by such well-known DJs as Dave Pearce, Tim Westwood, Steve Barker and John Peel.

British hip hop in the 1980s was not just confined to music and break-dancing, but also involved the spread of New York City-style graffiti – another integral element of US hip hop culture — to London and other UK inner-city areas, both on walls and trains. The most direct influence was, however, on graffiti painted in London Underground trains. Teenagers from inner London and other European cities who were into electro-hip hop and had family and other links to New York City had by the mid-1980s taken up some of the traditions of subway graffiti and exported them home, although legendary New York writers like Brim, Bio, and Futura had themselves played a significant role in establishing such links when they visited London in the early-to-mid-1980s and &#x27;put up pieces&#x27; on or near the west London end of the Metropolitan Line. Almost as significantly, just when subway graffiti was on the decline in New York City, some British teenagers who had spent time with family in Queens and the Bronx returned to London with a &quot;mission&quot; to Americanise the London Underground through painting New York City-style graffiti on trains. These small groups of London &#x27;train writers&#x27; adopted many of the styles and lifestyles of their New York City forebears, painting graffiti train pieces and in general &#x27;bombing&#x27; the system, but favouring only a few selected underground lines seen as most suitable for train graffiti. Although on a substantially smaller scale than what had existed in New York City, graffiti on London Underground trains became seen as enough of a problem by the mid-1980s to provoke the British Transport Police to establish its own graffiti squad modelled directly on and in consultation with that of the New York City MTA. At the same time, graffiti art on London Underground trains generated some interest in the media and arts, leading to several art galleries putting on exhibitions of some of the art work (on canvas) of a few London train writers as well as TV documentaries on London hip hop culture like the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Bad Meaning Good&quot;, which included a section featuring interviews with London train writers and a few examples of their pieces.

While many early rappers from the UK, such as Derek B, imitated the styles and accents of their US heroes, there were many who realised that to merely transpose US forms would rob UK hip-hop of the ability to speak for a disenfranchised British constituency in the way that US hip-hop so successfully spoke to, and for, its audience. Attempts were made by UK rappers to develop styles more obviously rooted in British semantics, syntax and dialectical linguistic praxis and practices — Rodney P of the London Posse deliberately chose a London accent – although many succeeded only in adopting a slurred hybrid that located the rap &quot;somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean&quot;.

===Development: Late 1980s–early 1990s===
The first record label devoted to releasing UK hip hop acts was founded in 1986. Simon Harris&#x27; Music of Life label was home to rapper Derek B, the first UK rapper to achieve chart success. He even collaborated with Public Enemy on his album &quot;Bullet from a Gun&quot; and was the first British rapper to appear on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.

Building on Derek B&#x27;s success, Music of Life went on to sign groups such as Hijack, the Demon Boyz, Hardnoise (later Son of Noise) and MC Duke. Their &quot;Hard as Hell&quot; series mixed homegrown talent like Thrashpack and the She Rockers with US artists such as Professor Griff. Music of Life was swiftly followed by other labels such as Mango Records and Kold Sweat. Another successful British hip-hop artist that emerged from Music of Life was Asher D, whose Jamaican origins showed through in his vocal style. In 1988, in collaboration with Daddy Freddy, Asher D released one of the first hip-hop dancehall fusion albums, &quot;Ragamuffin Hip-Hop&quot;.
Moving away from its US roots, British hip hop started to develop its own sounds: acts like Hijack, II Tone Committee, Hardnoise, and Silver Bullet developed a fast and hardcore style (often referred to as Britcore), while many other acts took influences from elsewhere. Britcore acts were amongst the first to receive wide-spread attention across continental Europe. Caveman and Outlaw Posse developed a jazz influenced style, whilst MC Mell&#x27;O&#x27; mixed jazz and hardcore. London Posse, Black Radical Mk II and DJ Ruf Cut And Tuf C were more influenced by reggae and disco whilst the Wee Papa Girl Rappers, Cookie Crew and Monie Love achieved chart success with more radio-friendly hip hop. However, despite the chart success of some British-born hip hop artists – for example Monie Love, Slick Rick, Young MC and MF Doom, who all moved to the US – the majority of the scene was still underground and small scale.

Kinetic Effect joined the scene in the early 1980s and was part of rap outfit 2 the Top as D-Koy; later, in 1991, he teamed with Insane Macbeth to record &quot;Borderin&#x27; Insanity&quot; (released in 1993) and in 1995, he recorded &quot;Man Bites Dog&quot;/&quot;The Effect of Fear&quot; Their song &quot;The Rhythm I Give &#x27;Em&quot; made the UK Top 10 Hip Hop chart.

In 1987, Positive Beat Records came out of the hotbed of early UK hip hop, Ladbroke Grove in London with two releases. The label followed up the single &quot;It&#x27;s Getting Rough&quot; by Rocky X and D-D Dance with the Various Artists&#x27; &quot;Known 2 Be Down&quot; album. This featured Sir Drew (of KREW and Newtrament), MC Flex, She Rockers, Rapski and more of West London&#x27;s finest rap talents.

Other notable labels at the time included Liberty Grooves in Tooting, South London. The label itself started in late 1989 with the first release in 1990 by Whirlwind D &amp; Johnny F of Solid n Mind. Other artists included Gutter Snypes, True Style and DJ Noize. Liberty Grooves was also a shop and many notable artists such as MC Mell O and Braintax would perform there.

In 1988, Rapski released &quot;The Connection&quot; on 12&quot;. The track was taken from &quot;Known 2 Be Down&quot; and was an early example of mixing hip hop and reggae in a (London) style. More was to come in the early 1990s in the form of MC Reason (a.k.a. Voice of Reason) with &quot;Symbolise&quot;/&quot;HouseQuake&quot; and Jonie D with &quot;Which Base&quot;/&quot;Ride On&quot; which was performed live on ITV in 1991.

A mindset began to develop – typified by the Gunshot tune &quot;No Sell Out&quot; (1991), or Son of Noise&#x27;s &quot;Poor But Hardcore&quot; (1992) — that distrusted successful artists who did not utilise the hardcore style most associated with the scene. Silver Bullet&#x27;s chart success was applauded due to an uncompromisingly rapid delivery, whereas Derek B and Rebel MC were scorned when their more pop influenced styles earned them success. Such artists were often branded &quot;sell outs&quot;. As the scene grew, it became less common for British rappers to imitate US accents (those who did were often ridiculed) and British rap became more assured of its identity.

&quot;Hip Hop Connection&quot; — the first major British hip hop magazine – was founded in 1989 and by the early 1990s the British hip hop scene seemed to be thriving. Not only was there a firm base of rappers in London such as Blade, Black Radical Mk II, Bushkiller (including Sirus) and Overlord X, who cut a Discomix with Jah Shaka — but many distinct scenes developed nationally.

Birmingham and the West Midlands gave rise to Credit to the Nation, whose MC Fusion would espouse conscious anti-racist, sexist and homophobic lyrics. The band would also find some brief mainstream success with their indie rock crossover sound. Leeds spawned Braintax and Breaking the Illusion (who together founded Low Life Records) as well as Nightmares on Wax. Greater Manchester gave birth to the Ruthless Rap Assassins, Krispy 3 (later Krispy), the Kaliphz, Jeep Beat Collective and MC Tunes.

Bristol&#x27;s scene has a long history going right back to the early 1980s where links were made with outfits from New York. The Fearless Four came over in 1984 along with graffiti legends the Tats Cru and Rock Steady Crew. Bristol (specifically the St. Pauls area) produced The Wild Bunch (later better known as Massive Attack), and Nellee Hooper who went on to produce for Soul II Soul, as well as cutting dubplate discomixes with roots reggae artists, Horace Andy and Mad Professor. The city later became the home of trip hop with artists like Tricky and Portishead.

Caveman signed to a major label — Profile Records, the label home of Run–D.M.C. — and Kold Sweat came into their own, discovering groups like SL Troopers, Dynametrix, Unanimous Decision and Katch 22, whose &quot;Diary of a Blackman&quot; was banned by Radio 1 for using a sound clip from the National Front.

In 1991, Hijack released &quot;The Horns of Jericho&quot; (Rhyme Syndicate Records, 1991) on Ice-T&#x27;s recently formed Rhyme Syndicate label. The first single, &quot;The Badman Is Robbin&#x27;&quot;, was a top 40 hit and they went on sell more than 30,000 albums.

British hip hop was affected by the record industry clamping down on sampling, beginning to charge for the use of samples and prosecuting those who used them without permission. Larger US acts could afford to license samples and still turn a profit for their labels, a luxury not available to many smaller UK artists. One such victim of this was Milton Keynes group the Criminal Minds. Their first two releases, the 1990 mini-album &quot;Guilty as Charged&quot; and a 1991 EP &quot;Tales from the Wasteland&quot; were bogged down by potential sample clearance problems and thus were only ever made available in small numbers. As breakbeat hardcore music started to become very popular in the UK in the early 1990s, the Criminal Minds turned their attention to making this type of music instead.

The UK hip hop boom never achieved its predicted commercial success. Hijack&#x27;s &quot;The Horns of Jericho&quot; was never released in the US, whilst record companies dropped artists, citing poor sales and lack of interest. Mango Records closed down, and the British public began to turn their affections to Jungle music, a fusion of breakbeat hardcore, dub, dancehall, ragga, hip hop and reggae, profoundly influenced by the rhythmic dynamics of King Tubby&#x27;s and Scientist discomixes and the spatial reverberations of Jah Shaka and Lloyd Coxsone sound systems, both of whom attracted followers with an almost religious sense of awe and devotion to sound, specifically, to bass tones and frequencies. Other acts and styles developed from the hip hop scene, resulting in new genres to describe them – for example Massive Attack with trip hop, or Galliano, Us3 and Urban Species with acid jazz.

In the period between 1992 and 1995, the only groups to make much impact were Gunshot and the Brotherhood. 
Gunshot&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;Patriot Games&quot; was a landmark with tracks such as &quot;Mind of a Razor&quot; and &quot;World War 3&quot; becoming British hardcore classics. Formed in the &#x27;80s, the Brotherhood released their first record, simply called &quot;Brotherhood EP&quot;, as a white label in 1991. They went on to release &quot;Wayz of the Wize&quot; in 1992, then &quot;Untitled 93&quot; and &quot;XXIII&quot; in 1993, and &quot;Hip Hop N&#x27; Rap&quot; in 1994, all on the Bite It! label. None of the records sold in huge numbers but they managed to gain airplay on the Tim Westwood show and DJ 279&#x27;s show on Choice FM, gaining them a solid following across the UK. Bite It! also released tracks from artists such as Pauly Ryan and the Scientists of Sound.

===New generation: Late 1990s–early 2000s===
Following an initial flurry of interest from major record labels in the 1980s, by the early 1990s the scene had moved underground after record companies pulled back. In the mid-1990s hip hop in the UK started to experiment and diversify – often mutating into diverse genres entirely, such as trip hop and began making inroads into the US market.

As the old rappers left the scene, a new generation, raised on hip hop and electronica, was coming of age: The Herbaliser released &quot;Remedies&quot; (Ninja Tune, 1995), Mr. Scruff released the &quot;Frolic EP Pt 1&quot; (Pleasure Music, 1995), Mark B released &quot;Any More Questions?&quot; (Jazz Fudge, 1995) and DJ Skitz released &quot;Where My Mind Is At/Blessed Be The Manor&quot; (Ronin Records, 1996) featuring a young rapper called Roots Manuva on guest vocals who had previously released the single &quot;Next Type of Motion&quot; (Sound of Money, 1995).

Record labels that attempted to merge British hip hop style and sensibilities with modern dance music began to emerge, like Mark Rae&#x27;s Grand Central (home to Aim, Rae &amp; Christian, and Fingathing, among others) or DJ Vadim&#x27;s Jazz Fudge. Increasingly, these artists managed to avoid the issues surrounding sampling by making music themselves (bands such as the Stereo MCs began playing instruments and sampling their own tunes) or searching out more obscure records where a most cost effective licensing deal could be arranged.

British hip hop began to go through a renaissance, its style shifting from the hardcore template of its youth and moving into more melodic territory.

The Brotherhood managed to broker a major deal with Virgin Records in 1995. Continuing their relationship with Trevor Jackson as their producer, they released 3 singles &#x27;Alphabetical Response&#x27;, &#x27;One Shot&#x27;, &#x27;Punk Funk&#x27; and their album &quot;Elementalz&quot;, all in 1996. Their work was met with critical acclaim and they toured solidly with American artists including Cypress Hill, The Roots and WuTang, but big record sales seemed to be very elusive and they parted ways with Virgin in 1998.

In late 1996, Will Ashon started up his new Ninja Tune backed label Big Dada and planned a roster of performers. Bandit of Birmingham&#x27;s MSI/Asylum crew informed Will of Juice Aleem that he was contemplating who could truly represent the ethos of the new label. Ashon was impressed with the demo and agreed to have Aleem on board. The results of this were the first release of the now famous record label: in 1997 Juice featured on Big Dada record label&#x27;s first ever release[2], &quot;Misanthropic&quot;, under the pseudonym &quot;Alpha Prhyme&quot;, a collaboration between himself and Luke Vibert.

In 1998, Mark B and Blade released &quot;Hitmen for Hire EP&quot;, which featured guest appearances from Lewis Parker and Mr Thing (of the Scratch Perverts). The EP was a success, and led to the successful 2001 album &quot;The Unknown&quot;, which despite never charting in the UK top 75, was still a top 100 success and an even bigger success within its genre. Also, the album spawned the 2001 top 40 single &quot;Ya Don&#x27;t See the Signs&quot;, which was a remix by Feeder frontman Grant Nicholas, after the title track was a top 75 hit and Blade with Mark B supported Feeder. The same year, Bristol&#x27;s Hombré label released the &quot;2012 EP&quot; from Aspects, a benchmark release within the movement. Roots Manuva, Blak Twang, Mud Family, Ti2bs, Task Force, Phi Life Cypher, MSI &amp; Asylum, Jeep Beat Collective and Ty all came to the public&#x27;s attention, while veteran acts Rodney P, Mike J, and MC Mell&#x27;O&#x27; returned to the scene.

===Underground to mainstream: 2000s to 2010s===
A new generation of artists emerged following the turn of the century, including Jehst, Skinnyman, Nicky Spesh, Foreign Beggars and Usmaan. At the same time, a new style of electronic music emerged in the early 2000s, derivative of UK garage and jungle, with influences from dancehall, drum and bass and hip hop; this new genre was dubbed &quot;grime&quot; (sometimes called eskibeat or sublow) and effectively superseded UK hip hop in both popularity and the mainstream conscious. Grime is generally considered to be distinct from hip-hop due to its roots primarily being genres such as UK garage and jungle. In 2001, Roots Manuva claimed that British hip hop &quot;is more healthy&quot; than American hip-hop, and is more about making the music than is it about exploiting wealth or hitting it rich.Success followed The Streets&#x27; 2002 album &quot;Original Pirate Material&quot;, and he became one of the first of the new breed of British hip hop artists to gain respectable sales, though his verbal style resulted in him being shunned by many artists in the scene. Such success has caused a surge in media exposure of other British hip hop acts. Welsh rap group Goldie Lookin Chain also achieved chart success with their tongue-in-cheek take on hip-hop. Key records such as Skinnyman&#x27;s &quot;Council Estate of Mind&quot;, and Klashnekoff&#x27;s &quot;The Sagas Of...&quot; were released, cementing the reputations of the artists and opening up the floor for new artists to emerge. Labels Low Life Records, run by prominent political rapper Braintax, and Young N&#x27; Restless started and became the starting point for many. At the same time, just as garage was losing momentum, grime was creating interest. Wiley&#x27;s &quot;Treddin&#x27; on Thin Ice&quot; was a cornerstone of the genre, and one-time friend Dizzee Rascal won a Mercury Music Prize for his debut &quot;Boy in da Corner&quot;. From then on, grime artists were the only MC&#x27;s for interested record labels, and UK Hip-Hop&#x27;s momentum dried up.A new generation of young socially conscious hip-hop musicians emerged as a counter to the grime scene that many in the UK Hip Hop scene perceived as commercial. These rappers strived to bring attention to both positivity and lyricism as well as the injustices of war, gentrification and racism, following in the tradition of conscious rappers such as Nas, Mos Def and Talib Kweli. Amongst this new generation included artists such as Klashnekoff, Akala, Lowkey and the Poisonous Poets.

The mid-2000s saw the emergence of road rap, a genre that took influences from American gangsta rap and focused on crime, gang, or violent themes. Road rap was pioneered by artists and groups such as PDC and Giggs&#x27; SN1 crew.

By the late 2000s, grime music had entered into a period of stagnation. This led to an emergence of acts that, while influenced by or initially started out making grime, were moving into a more commercialised, hip-hop influenced form of music. Artists from this new wave included N-Dubz, Tinchy Stryder, Tinie Tempah, and Chipmunk (later known as Chip) who emerged in the late 2000s to great commercial success. Tinchy Stryder scored two number ones with songs &quot;Number 1&quot; and &quot;Never Leave You&quot; and became the best-selling British solo artist of 2009. The following year continued the success of the previous, with acts like Professor Green and Tinie Tempah breaking through to even bigger commercial success and also critical appreciation. The debut album from Tinie Tempah called &quot;Disc-Overy&quot; went to number one in the UK Albums Chart and was certified platinum on 1 March 2011. He also won a Brit Award for his number one single &quot;Pass Out&quot;. Rapper Plan B found success with his 2010 Hip Hop and Soul fusion album &quot;The Defamation of Strickland Banks&quot;, followed by the soundtrack album &quot;Ill Manors&quot; in 2012, both of which peaked at number 1 in the UK Albums Chart. In 2014, Scottish alternative hip-hop trio Young Fathers won the Mercury Music Prize for their album Dead. The album entered the UK chart at 35 after they won the award. Riz Ahmed, also known as Riz MC, was featured in the song &quot;Immigrants (We Get the Job Done)&quot; in &quot;The Hamilton Mixtape&quot;, which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in 2016. At the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs), &quot;Immigrants&quot; won the award for Best Fight Against the System.

=== 2010 and onwards ===
The early 2010s saw the emergence of UK afrobeats, led by artists such as Mista Silva, Kwamz, Fuse ODG, and Timbo. Around the same time, artists such as Sneakbo and Timbo were incorporating melodic rap and Caribbean influences into their music. The foundation set by these artists would later be a major influence on Afroswing, a genre that emerged around 2014 derivative of UK afrobeats while carrying influences from grime, dancehall, hip hop, and R&amp;B.

UK drill is a subgenre of drill music and road rap that originated in the South London district of Brixton from 2012 onwards. Borrowing heavily from the style of Chicago drill music, UK drill artists often rap about violent and hedonistic criminal lifestyles. Typically, those who create this style of music are affiliated with gangs or come from socioeconomically-deprived neighbourhoods where crime is a way of life for many. UK drill music is closely related to road rap, a British style of gangsta rap that became popular in the years prior to the existence of drill. Musically, UK drill often exhibits violent language and provocative lyrics.

The early 2010s also saw the emergence of an underground UK hip hop scene emulating the earlier wave of 2000s rappers such as Jehst, Task Force, King Kashmere, MysDiggi and Skinnyman. With complex lyrics and rhyme schemes and &#x27;90s New York boom bap influenced production, High Focus Records was instrumental in bringing this sound to a wider audience. 

The label was founded in 2010 by London rapper Fliptrix and key members of the larger High Focus crew have included The Four Owls, Dirty Dike, Ocean Wisdom, Jam Baxter and Dabbla. Artists from the label have managed to build a sizeable following despite remaining underground, having performed to crowds of 25,000+ across Europe, played the famous Reading and Leeds festivals in the UK and seen many tracks reaching multiple millions of views on YouTube. 

In 2015, The Four Owls collaborated with highly respected US producer DJ Premier for their track &quot;Think Twice&quot; . BRIT Award winning singer-songwriter Rag&#x27;n&#x27;Bone Man also released two albums on the label in 2011 and 2014 – &quot;Put That Soul on Me&quot; (a collaboration with Dirty Dike) and &quot;Dog n Bone&quot; with Four Owls member and rapper/producer Leaf Dog. These albums are what eventually led to his signing with major label Columbia Records, however Rag&#x27;n&#x27;Bone Man has continued to feature on High Focus records releases such as the track &quot;Mask&quot; from Jam Baxter&#x27;s album Touching Scenes in 2019.

Blah Records is also highly influential. The label was founded by Lee Scott (rapper) and Molotov in 2006 and currently managed and owned by Lee Scott and Salar. Key members of the Blah family include Lee Scott, Salar, Black Josh, Milkavelli, Jam Baxter and Cult of The Damned.

The mid-2010s saw the emergence of Abstract Orchestra, a British hip hop Orchestra that &quot;explore the shared territory between jazz and hip hop by taking modern classics such as Madvillain and J Dilla’s back catalogue and filtering them through classic arrangement techniques.&quot; The group is influenced by the style of hip hip associated with Detroit in the US and have recorded with Illa J and Slum Village. They perform with UK MC&#x27;s Micall Parknsun, Joker Starr and Yungun.

By 2014, grime music was also experiencing a resurgence. While hip hop did not immediately benefit from this, the rise of grime has been credited for re-opening the doors for competing genres such as hip hop and afroswing that were also on the rise. Acts that would rise within the hip hop scene within the following years include Dave, Kojey Radical, Slowthai, Little Simz, and Loyle Carner. Dave released a &quot;Blackbox freestyle&quot; in 2015 which helped him rise to prominence. The following year, Dave was noticed by Canadian rapper Drake, who later featured on a remix of his song &quot;Wanna Know&quot;.
 Stormzy, an artist that came up out of the grime scene, released his debut album, &quot;Gang Signs &amp; Prayer&quot;, on 24 February 2017. The album was a mixture of grime, hip-hop, and R&amp;B, and was the first &#x27;grime&#x27; album to reach number one on the UK Albums Chart. In February 2018, &quot;Gang Signs &amp; Prayer&quot; won British Album of the Year at the 2018 Brit Awards. He has reached number one on the UK Singles Chart a total of two times; firstly as part of &quot;Artists for Grenfell&quot; on 23 June 2017 with song &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;, and secondly with his own solo single &quot;Vossi Bop&quot;, which debuted at number-one upon its entry, ahead of &quot;Me!&quot; by Taylor Swift featuring Brendon Urie by some 500 combined sales.

Skepta, who also emerged from the grime scene, began collaborating with American hip hop group ASAP Mob. He featured with ASAP Rocky on the song &quot;Praise the Lord (Da Shine)&quot;, the second single from his third studio album &quot;Testing&quot; on 26 June 2018. It was the third collaboration between both artists, following Skepta&#x27;s appearance on &quot;Cozy Tapes Vol. 1: Friends&quot; and ASAP Rocky&#x27;s appearance on Skepta&#x27;s &quot;Vicious EP&quot; in 2017, which also featured ASAP Nast, Lil B, and Section Boys. The song was successful in a number of countries, peaking at number 45 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 18 on the UK Singles Chart. It was later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). His 2016 album &quot;Konnichiwa&quot; won a Mercury Prize and had earned a gold certification in the UK.

In 2017, Dave did a freestyle on American radio station Power 106 Los Angeles which has accumulated over 1,000,000 views on YouTube. In 2018, Dave achieved his first UK number-one hit with &quot;Funky Friday&quot; which featured British rapper Fredo. Dave&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Psychodrama&quot; (2019), debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and became the most-streamed first-week British rap album in the UK with a total of 23.6 million streams. The album was highly acclaimed and won Dave a Mercury Prize.

Slowthai released his debut studio album, &quot;Nothing Great About Britain,&quot; in 2019. The album was nominated for the Mercury Prize. He performed at the 2019 Mercury Prize ceremony, where he controversially held a fake severed head of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on stage. Little Simz also released &quot;Grey Area&quot; in 2019 to much acclaim.

==Road rap==
Road rap (also known as British gangsta rap) is a genre of music pioneered in South London, primarily in Brixton and Peckham. The genre was pioneered by groups such as PDC, SMS, SN1, North Star, MashTown and U.S.G. and artists such as Giggs and K Koke and later Nines and Sneakbo. The genre came to the fore as a backlash against the perceived commercialisation of grime in the mid-late 2000s in London. The genre came to prominence around 2007 with the rise of Giggs. Road rap retained the explicit depictions of violence and British gang culture found in some early grime music and combines it with a musical style more similar to American gangsta rap than the sound system influenced music of grime, dubstep, UK garage, jungle, reggae, and dub.

Gangs played a large part in the genre, with gangs such as the Peckham Boys (with its various sets such as SN1, PYG, and OPB), based in Peckham and GAS Gang, based in Brixton, with members becoming notable in the road rap scene during the 2000s.

The road rap scene centres around mixtape releases and YouTube videos with some of the genres more popular acts getting mainstream recognition. The genre has been criticised for the relentless nihilism and violence in its lyrics as well as its links to gangs and gun crime with many rappers serving prison sentences. In keeping with grime, road rap has suffered from pre-emptive policing with Giggs claiming that the Metropolitan Police have set out to deny him the opportunity to make a living from music having banned him from touring. In 2011, Stigs was served the first ever gang injunction that banned him from rapping about anything that may encourage violence.

In the early 2010s, the American genre drill began to emerge in the UK, pushed by groups such as 150, 67, and Section Boyz. UK drill has been referred to as subgenre of road rap due to the influence it&#x27;s had on the genre. Road rap also went on to influence afroswing, which emerged in the mid-2010s.

==Trap scene==
In several interviews, M Huncho has described his more tone-down, melodic style and moderately humbler approach when it comes to lyrics as his own derivative take on UK trap music, in a genre he has personally dubbed &quot;Trap Wave&quot;. Wolverhampton artist Scarlxrd implements an energetic aesthetic and tone with explosively brazen screaming vocals, and dark yet reflectively intense and meaningful lyricism in an essentially self-pioneered style known as &quot;trap-metal&quot; or &quot;ragecore&quot;; a fusion of trap music and screaming vocals. Scarlxrd has cited some of his main inspirations and influences as including the likes of Eminem, Bring Me the Horizon, Limp Bizkit, DMX, Slipknot, Travis Scott and Linkin Park, among others.

==Backlash against commercialisation==
Since grime&#x27;s post-millennial boom period coincided with UK hip-hop&#x27;s, the eagerly anticipated commercial breakout of the latter did not happen. Instead, acts such as Tinchy Stryder, Tinie Tempah, N-Dubz and Chip were signed to major labels and their traditional sound tweaked to fit a pop sensibility. However the lineage of these, and many UK rappers, is unquestionably grime rather than UK hip-hop.

There is a common belief within the underground hip hop community that true hip hop is music relevant primarily to the disenfranchised listeners, rather than the mass market. Because of the belief that mainstream acts are paid large sums of money by the major labels to make music tailored to the current mass market, these artists often face a backlash and accusations of &#x27;selling out&#x27; from the underground community.

==Media==
The growth of British hip hop was given a boost when in 2002, the BBC launched a digital radio station 1Xtra devoted to &quot;new black music&quot; including hip hop, R&amp;B, soul, UK garage, dancehall, grime and drum and bass, however 1Xtra does not play exclusively British hip hop. The cable and satellite channel, Channel AKA (formerly Channel U, now known as Now 70s) also had the profile of British hip hop and grime.
YouTube was also a very important outlet for upcoming and significant artists. Channels include Link Up TV, GRM Daily, SB.TV, Pressplay Media and Mixtape Madness.

==Women==
Women have contributed to hip hop&#x27;s evolution in Britain from the beginning. Pioneering British female rappers have included Cookie Crew, She Rockers, Wee Papa Girl Rappers, and Monie Love. Neneh Cherry, born in Stockholm, moved to England when she was 14 years old, and contributed to early British hip hop. &quot;Raw Like Sushi&quot; (1989) was solely produced by British producers and was a massive hit in both the UK and US. Cherry continues to produce and release music today.

Contemporary female British rappers include Alesha Dixon, Baby Blue, C-Mone, Envy, Estelle, Lady Leshurr, Lady Sovereign, Little Simz, M.I.A., Nadia Rose, Shystie, NoLay, Stefflon Don, Mercury prize winners Ms. Dynamite and Speech Debelle and music producer Mizz Beats.

Women in hip hop often confront a large amount of sexist stereotyping; however some female British rappers such as Lady Sovereign and M.I.A. have achieved success both in the UK and US. Artists such as Ms Dynamite, M.I.A. and Speech Debelle have also become known for political and social commentary in their music. Singer, songwriter and rapper Estelle said of the difficult position of female rappers: &quot;I think they get a tough ride because some of them don&#x27;t see themselves above and beyond the bullshit and no one&#x27;s really given them that break.&quot;

<doc id="1021613" wikidata="Q290105" url="?curid=1021613" title="Air Defense Anti-Tank System">
<text>The [[OC Oerlikon|Oerlikon]]/[[Martin Marietta]] air defense anti-tank system (US designation MIM-146 ADATS) is a dual-purpose short range surface-to-air and anti-tank missile system based on the M113A2 vehicle. The ADATS missile is a laser-guided supersonic missile with a range of 10 kilometers (6.2 miles), with an electro-optical sensor with TV and forward looking infrared (FLIR). The carrying vehicle also has a search radar with an effective range of over 25 kilometers (16 miles).

The first firing of an ADATS missile occurred in June 1981. Canada was the launch customer for the system with 36 units on the M113 chassis ordered for the Canadian Army in 1986. The system was further developed and produced at a new facility in Québec. The US Army also selected ADATS installed on the M2 Bradley chassis but by the time it was ready for service the ending of the Cold War led the US Army to cancel its orders, after Oerlikon invested over CHF 1 billion in the project. A small number of vehicles, many of them the developmental prototypes, entered service with the Canadian Army.

== History ==

The ADATS was trialed or proposed on a variety of different platforms to suit the needs of the user for the defense of mobile field formations or fixed sites such as airfields. Besides the M113A2 tracked vehicle chosen by Canada, the ADATS was also installed on the M2 Bradley chassis for the US Army and the Swiss MOWAG Shark 8x8 vehicle, and proposed for the British Warrior MICV chassis. A shelter-mounted version either with on-mount radar for autonomous use, or without radar for coordination with a central fire control center could be mounted on a 4x4 or 6x6 military truck or installed in fixed locations. This version was purchased by Thailand. A version mounted on the four-wheel trailer used for the Oerlikon Contraves Skyguard fire control system and without radar, probably intended for integration with Skyguard and Oerlikon GDF 35 mm guns, was also proposed.

There was also a proposed naval version called &quot;Sea Sprint&quot;, using the standard eight-missile turret without the radar, proposed for the close-in anti-air and anti-missile self-defense role.

Oerlikon also suggested a dedicated anti-tank system without the radar, including a version mounted on a long articulating arm that could be elevated high above the vehicle to clear trees or terrain while the launch vehicle remained hidden.

=== Canada ===

The ADATS entered service with the Canadian Army (in 1989) as a mobile, M113-based system.

The first systems were deployed as part of Canada&#x27;s NATO contribution in West-Germany. Thirty-six systems were delivered by 1994. The cost of the system was initially $650 million. Over the life of the project, total cost reached $1.1 billion.

After their return from Germany, Canadian ADATS systems were only operationally deployed once: In June 2002, they were used to defend the airspace of the G8 summit held in Kananaskis, Alberta. Canadian ADATS were never operationally deployed in Bosnia or Afghanistan.
As of 31 March 2011, the ADATS has been withdrawn from Canadian service with no planned replacement announced.

Canadian acquisition of the ADATS system was marred by a scandal relating to the purchase of the land where assembly of the system was to take place. The property had been bought and sold several times over a short period of time and its price inflated before it was sold to Oerlikon. It led to the resignation of Minister of State for Transport André Bissonnette who had been directly involved in the land deal, and several criminal accusations.

=== US Army evaluation ===

The ADATS cropped up from an extensive competition during which it was selected by the U.S. Army for the forward area air-defense (FAAD) program under the designation &quot;MIM-146&quot; for the missile. The US Army planned to purchase 387 systems. Test results indicated that the system did not perform well in inclement weather. Ultimately the FAAD contract was cancelled in the early 1990s after the end of the Cold War.

=== Thailand ===

The Royal Thai Air Force acquired one static shelter-based system from Oerlikon Canada, linked to a Skyguard fire control system.

=== Greece ===

In the late 1990s, Canada offered their surplus ADATS systems to the Greek military as part of a low-level air defense program. The offer was considered but not accepted. Greece eventually purchased the Russian Tor missile system.

=== Modernization program ===
In September 2005, the Canadian government and the Canadian Forces announced a modernization program, transforming the ADATS and associated command, control and communications systems into a &quot;multi-mission effects vehicle&quot; (MMEV). The MMEV was to retain and enhance ADATS anti-aircraft and anti-armor capability (85% or better engagement success rate) to meet new threats, provide indirect fire support to ground troops, and would be mounted on an LAV III wheeled armoured vehicle.

It was to be fitted with a 3D radar, non-line-of-sight missile (using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to gather required intelligence and target location at a range of 8 km or more) and low-cost precision kill (LCPK) missile (fireable on direct shot at a &gt;8 km range), based on a 2.75-inch rocket and advanced battle management command and control communication computer and information (BMC41), including link 11/16, to provide intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR).
In July 2006, Canadian Forces land staff recommended the cancellation of the MMEV project. The program was cancelled in November 2006.

The ADATS was withdrawn from Canadian service in 2012.

<doc id="1021618" wikidata="Q983059" url="?curid=1021618" title="Frank Lentini">
<text>Francesco &quot;Frank&quot; Lentini (May 18, 1889 − September 21, 1966) was an Italian-American sideshow performer who toured with numerous circuses. Born with a conjoined twin, Lentini had three legs.

==Early life==
Lentini was born at 8 Gintoli Street, Rosolini, Sicily, on May 18, 1889. Delivered by midwife Maria Alberino, he was the fifth of 12 children (seven sisters and five brothers) in his family. Disgraced initially, his parents gave him into the care of his aunt, the wife of his uncle Corrado Falco. At four months old he was sent to be examined by a specialist in Naples. By age five he was playing with other children and was able to straighten his third leg, but could not use it to walk. He became known for having three legs, four feet, and two sets of genitals.

Lentini was born with a parasitic twin. The twin was attached to his body at the base of his spine and consisted of a pelvic bone, a rudimentary set of male genitalia, and a full-sized leg extending from the right side of his hip, with a small foot protruding from its knee.

==Sideshow career==
He was exhibited in numerous cities, including London, in 1897. When he was eight, Magnano, who ran a travelling puppet show, brought him to Middletown and Lentini&#x27;s family moved to the United States. Lentini then entered the sideshow business as &quot;The Great Lentini&quot;, joining the Ringling Brothers Circus. He gained US citizenship at the age of 30. His career spanned over 40 years and he worked with every major circus and sideshow, including Barnum and Bailey and Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show. Lentini was so respected among his peers that he was often called &quot;The King&quot;.

In his youth, Lentini used his third leg to kick a football across the stage—hence his show name, the &quot;Three-Legged Football Player&quot;.

Lentini&#x27;s normal legs were slightly different in length: one was 99 centimeters and the other 97 centimeters. The third leg was only 91 centimeters and ended in a clubfoot. As an adult, his primary legs remained of different lengths while his extra leg was several centimeters shorter. He complained that, even with three legs, he still did not have a pair. In 1907 he married Theresa Murray, three years younger than him, and they had four children: Giuseppina (Josephine), Natale (Ned), Francesco (Frank) Junior, and Giacomo (James). When Frank and Theresa separated around 1935, he began a new life with Helen Shupe, with whom he lived until his death. Lentini died of lung failure in Jackson, Tennessee, on September 21, 1966, at the age of 77.

==Legacy==
Jonathan Redavid portrayed him in the 2017 film &quot;The Greatest Showman&quot;.

Frank Lentini is featured on the back cover of Seattle-based rock band Alice in Chains&#x27; self-titled 1995 album.

<doc id="1021619" wikidata="Q900541" url="?curid=1021619" title="Cecil Jacobson">
<text>Cecil Byran Jacobson (October 2, 1936 – March 5, 2021) was an American former fertility doctor who used his own sperm to impregnate his patients without informing them.

Jacobson was born in Salt Lake City, Utah. A graduate of Brown University, he became a researcher at George Washington University, but had no specialist training in infertility medicine.

==Baboon impregnation==

In the 1960s, Jacobson, who was Chief of the Reproductive Genetics Unit at George Washington University Medical School, claimed that he had impregnated a male baboon; he had supposedly implanted his sperm into a female baboon’s abdominal cavity. He claimed that he had terminated the pregnancy after four months, but never published his results in scientific publications.

==False pregnancies==
In the 1980s, Jacobson operated a reproductive genetics center in Fairfax County, Virginia. He specialized in treating women who had difficulty getting pregnant, or problems carrying a pregnancy to term. One form of treatment was to inject patients, before and after conception, with the hormone hCG (commonly used as a parenteral fertility medication and a hormone normally released during pregnancy), and patients who had been unable to conceive with other treatments reported success under Jacobson&#x27;s care.

The pregnancies progressed normally through the early stages: standard pregnancy tests were positive and patients&#x27; bodies began to undergo changes associated with pregnancy. Jacobson performed ultrasounds, identifying a fetus in the grainy image. Around the third month, Jacobson would report that the fetus had died. In fact, these patients were never pregnant, and the bodily changes were a reaction to the hCG. The pregnancy tests were inevitably false positives because the tests determined pregnancy by the presence of hCG. During Jacobson&#x27;s criminal trial, experts examined the ultrasound photographs, and reported that the purported &quot;fetuses&quot; were actually nearby organs or fecal matter.

Nevertheless, other patients were successful in becoming pregnant and having children. While some patients were uncomfortable with Jacobson&#x27;s manner, and began to distrust him, other patients gave him credit for successful treatment. 

==Paternity==

In 1989, suspicious former patients tipped off a local television station, which investigated and reported on the false pregnancies. Jacobson was sued by numerous patients. Federal prosecutors charged Jacobson with perjury (for false testimony during the civil proceedings) and mail and wire fraud (for the use of the letters and the telephone system as part of his fraudulent practice).

During the course of the criminal investigation, another type of fraud came to light. For a variety of reasons, some patients had arranged to be artificially inseminated with sperm provided by screened, anonymous donors arranged by Jacobson. In order to preserve the anonymity of the donors, Jacobson explained, he identified them in records using code numbers; only Jacobson was to know their true identities. Investigators found no evidence that any donor program actually existed. Some of Jacobson&#x27;s patients who had conceived through donor insemination agreed to genetic testing. At least seven instances were identified in which Jacobson was the biological father of the patients&#x27; children, including one patient who was supposed to have been inseminated with sperm provided by her husband. DNA tests linked Jacobson to at least 15 such children, and it has been suspected that he fathered as many as 75 children by impregnating patients with his own sperm.

==Aftermath==

===Defense===
Jacobson vigorously denied wrongdoing. He offered these explanations: With regard to the &quot;false pregnancy&quot; cases, he had believed that the women had actually been pregnant, and continued to maintain that some of them really were pregnant. He was well aware that injected hCG could trigger a false positive on a pregnancy test, but thought that the dosages he administered were too low to have that effect. If he misread the ultrasound results, that was an honest error. As for the donor insemination, Jacobson maintained that he had in fact relied on anonymous donors as claimed. He acknowledged using his own sperm on some occasions, when donors failed to show up when needed, and a patient was about to miss a window of opportunity to become pregnant. He could not account for the incident in which his own sperm was used in place of the patient&#x27;s husband&#x27;s, other than to suggest cross-contamination in the laboratory.

===Sentence===
In 1992, Jacobson was convicted of 52 counts of mail fraud, wire fraud, and perjury. He was sentenced to five years in prison and had his medical license revoked. Jacobson appealed his convictions and sentence, but they were upheld by the court of appeals. He later moved to Provo, Utah, where he was involved in agricultural research.

===Ig Nobel Prize===
He was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for Biology in 1992, which cited him as &quot;Dr. Cecil Jacobson, relentlessly generous sperm donor, and prolific patriarch of sperm banking, for devising a simple, single-handed method of quality control.&quot;

===Death===
Jacobson died on March 5th, 2021 in Springville, Utah at the age of 84. His cause of death was reported as compilations due to health issues he had been dealing with prior.

<text>Victoria Park is a urban park situated on the corner of Parramatta Road and City Road, Camperdown, in the City of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The park is located adjacent to The University of Sydney and the Broadway Shopping Centre.

Proclaimed as a park in 1870, Victoria Park, together with The University of Sydney and its associated University Colleges were listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 31 August 2018. The park and features including Gardener&#x27;s Lodge and its interior, the park&#x27;s entry gates and piers, and the park layout, paths and plantings were listed on the City of Sydney local government heritage list on 14 December 2012.

==History==

Victoria Park was originally part of Grose Farm, which in 1853 was designated as the site for the University of Sydney. In 1865 an area at the intersection of City Road and Parramatta Road was granted to the university for the building of a formal entrance to the university.

The park was designed in the picturesque style by Charles Moore, director of the Royal Botanic Garden. Moore used James Jones (born 1839) who became Overseer of the Domains in Sydney from 1884, whose post involved planning and supervising all outside work required by the NSW Government in the city suburbs and country. This included all garden requirements of the Government Architect (railways, police, hospitals, schools) in addition to layout out several municipal parks. A grand entrance avenue, aligned with the central tower of the university&#x27;s main quadrangle building, was built connecting this entrance area with the university. The remainder of the former farm between the entrance area and the university proper was proclaimed Victoria Park in 1870.

In the late 1880s, two lodges (one of which survives while the other was demolished in 1940) and a set of ornate gates, designed by Colonial Architect James Barnet, were built at the start of the entrance avenue on the corner of City Road and Parramatta Road.

By the end of the 19th century, the main point of access to the university switched to the entrance further west on Parramatta Road, opposite Derwent Road. Between 1910 and 1940 an area roughly east of the line of Eastern Avenue, which had been part of Victoria Park, became part of the University&#x27;s grounds; and gradually severed the historical vista along the entrance avenue, and the entrance avenue itself disappeared. In 1911 management of Victoria Park given to Sydney City Council, works included; park planning, further plantings, establishment of a children&#x27;s playground, extension of the bowling club and the introduction of park lighting. In 1927 the avenue through Victoria Park was formally reduced to a right of way. During the 1930s extensive remodelling of Victoria Park were completed including the lake, lawns, pathways, plantings, filling in of small pond (near current swimming pool), removal of iron railing surrounding the Park and creation of fence between the park and the University. Between 1924 and 1946 the University exchanged of lake and main drive with the Sydney City Council for of Victoria Park in the Eastern Avenue area.

In 1955 the Victoria Park Swimming Pool (named in honour of King George VI) opened. The pool was the first in-ground public swimming pool in Sydney. The Victoria Park lake was reduced and the bridge that carried the avenue over the lake was demolished in 1955. The eastern gates were moved to the university&#x27;s main City Road entrance via Eastern Avenue. During the 1960s the Victoria Park Lawn Bowls club house was replaced, dominating the City Road section of the park. In 1961 the University Site Development plans were presented with formation of functional precincts, landscaping with pedestrian precedence over vehicles. In 1964 Victoria Park lake re-named Lake Northam, in honour of Bill Northam.

In the 1970s Victoria Park plantings modified and flower beds reduced. In the 1990s South Sydney Council rebuilt a pedestrian path along the old entrance avenue, with a bridge rebuilt over the lake (Lake Northam). The historical vista was restored after a series of initiatives around the turn of the 21st century. In the 1990s the South Sydney City Council restored the main avenue in Victoria Park as a pedestrian path with a bridge over an enlarged Lake Northam and new garden beds. In 1992 a Draft Plan of Management for Victoria Park was created; and revised the following year. In 1998 the Victoria Park Lawn Bowls clubhouse was removed and the following year, the lawn bowls greens removed and returfed. In 2002 the University undertook works to extend the vista along that path, including the construction of a set of steps leading from Victoria Park into the University. In 2007, at the same time as reconfiguring Eastern Avenue, the original entrance gates were restored to the City Road end of the entrance avenue. In 2010 Victoria Park playground upgrade was completed; and in 2012 the Gardener&#x27;s Lodge restored and refurbished as cafe. In 2017 Victoria Park works including new paths, lighting, seating, signage, recreation space and refurbishing of Lake Northam commenced.

==Description==
Proclaimed on 16 July 1870, Victoria Park is of historical significance as a significant Victorian era park in Sydney and its part in the early history of Camperdown. It is also significant for its close association with The University of Sydney. The park retains substantial components, including fabric, spaces, layout and Victorian character of its formative 19th century planning and design.

The park contains an in-ground public swimming pool, built in 1953 and named in honour of King George VI who died the previous year. Originally it consisted of a main pool, wading pool, and male and female changing rooms. Later a children&#x27;s playground and kiosk were added. A lake, initially named Horse Pond, was formed in the 1930s after a stormwater channel to Blackwattle Bay was closed. A representational bronze sculpture of the yacht Barrenjoey was installed on the island in the centre of the lake to commemorate the gold medal for yachting won by Bill Northam, an alderman on Sydney City Council, at the 1964 Olympic Games At the same time the lake was renamed as Lake Northam in his honour. In the 1990s the lake was enlarged and a bridge, demolished in 1955, reinstated as part of the restoration of the University entrance avenue vista.

A totem pole near the southern corner of the park was &quot;presented to the people of Sydney in the name of the government and people of Canada on the occasion of National Timber Week, 1964&quot;. The pole was carved by Simon Charlie, a Quamichan man from Vancouver Island, British Columbia.

The Gardener&#x27;s Lodge adjacent to City Road was used as a toilet block for a long time, and eventually restored and now used as a café. The Lodge and the sandstone gates nearby originally guarded the eastern edge of the University grounds.

== Heritage listing ==
The University of Sydney, University Colleges and Victoria Park is of state historical significance as a vestige of Governor Phillip&#x27;s original &quot;Kanguroo Ground&quot; Crown reserve of 1790 and for its connection to the 18th century British government&#x27;s approach to colonialism and its concept of &quot;terra nullius&quot; as the foundation for dispossession of Aboriginal land in the immediate area of Sydney.

The cultural landscape is of state heritage significance for its ability to demonstrate activities of the colonial era (1792-1855) associated with Grose Farm, convict stockade, and female orphan school.

The University of Sydney and Victoria Park as connected landscapes have tangible links to Charles Moore, Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens (1848-1896) and subsequent designers using prevalent 19th century theories of landscape design, plant material and horticultural techniques. Victoria Park is a significant Victorian-era park dedicated in 1870. The park retains substantial components of its formative 19th-century planning and design, including the grand avenue linking City Road and the remaining original gate lodge to the tower of the Main Building of the University. The provision of sport and leisure facilities across the site have contributing significantly to the retention of open space and green buffers between the built forms of the campus, and are important to the people of Sydney and NSW.

The University of Sydney, University Colleges and Victoria Park has been a major landmark of Sydney and NSW since its inception. It holds substantial social values and associations, and is held in high esteem for a range of affiliated communities and groups as an iconic place of historic, academic, cultural, sporting, recreational and social pursuits and events.

The intactness of the groupings of buildings and landscapes across the history of the development of the site represents a microcosm of the development of architectural design, town planning and landscape design in New South Wales and Australia.

Victoria Park was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 31 August 2018 having satisfied the following criteria.

The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.

The University of Sydney, University Colleges and Victoria Park is of state significance for its historical connection that dates back to the foundation of the colony. The site encompasses a portion of the original &quot;Kanguroo Ground&quot; reserved by Governor Arthur Phillip in August 1790. Inclusive of timbered land, prominent ridges, and valleys with fresh water sources, this tract of land was designated for church (400 acres), Crown (400 acres) and school (200 acres) usage. The site is a vestige of the latter two areas. The later leasing of the part of this land to military officers (Grose Farm) and its use for agistment, agricultural experimentation, farming education, a stockade for convicts and establishment of a female orphan school provides an understanding of the cultural history of the local area.

The site is of state heritage significance for its continuity of provision of sporting and leisure facilities to the people of Sydney and NSW. Sport also has been an important factor in University student life and in the use of the University grounds. The sporting facilities at the University contributed significantly to the retention of open space and green buffers between the built forms of the campus.

The site has held socially and nationally significant sporting events such as horse racing (pre and post university), rugby football (oldest club in Australia), cricket, tennis and hockey (including inter-state and international matches) and Sydney&#x27;s first in-ground public pool (King George VI, Victoria Park). Victoria Park has been a place of continuous children&#x27;s play &amp; leisure activities for over 130 years, with a playground being a feature of the Park since 1912.

The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales&#x27;s history.

The University of Sydney, University Colleges and Victoria Park has state significance for its association with a large number of notable people who were involved in the development and expansion of the University, its lands, the buildings, landscape and grounds. These include the initial land owners, those responsible for and involved in the initial establishment of the University as an institution, and the architects and designers who have designed and constructed the principal buildings and landscapes throughout each campus and developed the master plans for the place.

In regard to the University of Sydney as an historic cultural landscape, there are a number of people who were involved in the initial establishment and subsequent development of the University and so have strong associations with the place. These include the following people, together with their association or contribution:
* Governor Arthur Phillipreserved part of &quot;Kanguroo Ground&quot; for future church, Crown and school usage; 1790
* Lieutenant Governor Francis Groseoriginal leaseholder; 1792
*Edmund Blacket (former NSW Colonial Architect)First architect for the University of Sydney and responsible for the core buildings the Quadrangle Building; 1854-1862
* Charles MooreFirst Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens - responsible for the design of the plantings in Victoria Park and University Place in front of Quadrangle; 1880
*Walter Liberty Vernon (NSW Government Architect)architect for the University of Sydney and responsible for the first whole of site plan for the place
*George McRae (NSW Government Architect)architect for the University, developed a plan for the whole of the place; 1914, resulting in the formalising and development of Science Road
*Walter Burley GriffinArchitect who developed a whole of site plan for the University focussing on landscape and visual and planning axes; 1915.

The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.

The University of Sydney, University Colleges and Victoria Park is of state significance for a number of fine examples of architecture and landscape design. These aesthetic values relate to:
* The University of Sydney and Victoria Park as connected landscapes, with planted features, including individual specimen trees, avenues of mature trees, open lawns, designed gardens and courtyards. The open spaces and roadways contribute to the aesthetic significance of the place and significant axial views. Across the site there are landscapes and gardens which demonstrate Picturesque (1850s-1890s), Arts and Crafts (1890s-1917) and Georgian Revival/Mediterranean (1915-1940s) aesthetic characteristics;
* Victoria Park for its landmark location on the intersection of two major thoroughfares (Parramatta Road and City Road), as an &quot;Approach Reserve&quot; to the University of Sydney and its visual relationship to the University of Sydney. The Park retains substantial components of its formative 19th century &quot;picturesque&quot; planning and design including fabric, spaces, layout, its Victorian character and importantly, the grand avenue linking City Road and the remaining original gate lodge to the tower of the Main Building of the University;
* The sporting facilities at the University and Colleges contributing significantly to the retention of open space and green buffers between the built forms of the campus. They are traditional open spaces that are readily associated with university and college life, and they form a strong element of the traditional campus form; and
* Site features such as the boundary treatments, gateways, artworks (sculptures) and memorials that individually and together contribute to the overall aesthetic and historic character of the University as a whole.

The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.

The University of Sydney, University Colleges and Victoria Park has substantial social values at state level for a range of affiliated communities and groups. These values are attached to the whole of the University, each of the colleges, campuses and individual faculties, Victoria Park, as well as smaller precincts, vistas, buildings and features in the grounds. These values may be associated with experiences and memories that these places may hold and include:
* Association as a major place for sporting groups and events;
* The Park&#x27;s sense of place, as a landmark major open space within inner-Sydney, a passive recreation area, and for the active use of the Victoria Park Swimming Pool;
* The swimming pool as a focus of over 60 years of water-based recreational activity within the Park for the local and broader community;
* The Park being used for major events and gatherings including an unofficial Aboriginal tent embassy (2000-2004), the Yabun Festival of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures held annually on 26 January, and the annual Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Fair Day; and
* Over 130 years of children using Victoria Park as a place of play.

The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.

The cultural landscape is of state heritage significance for its ability to demonstrate activities of the colonial era (1792-1855) associated with Grose Farm, convict stockade and orphan school. The potential for significant archaeological evidence of the post-European settlement period relates to the pre-university land use of Grose Farm, and the early development of the
University and Park.

The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.

The University of Sydney, University Colleges and Victoria Park contain a number of buildings and landscapes that are rare or unique and of state significance. These include:

* The long axis and grand triple avenue (of which major remnants remain) linking City Road to Edmund Blacket&#x27;s Main Building tower being a rare example of a Blacket landscape design;
* Victoria Park as a contemporarily planned setting for a major 19th century university campus, being a reserve associated from its beginnings with the first university in Australia;
* Landscape and planted features from the early 1880s of individual specimen trees and avenues of mature trees, including rare plantings in cultivation in Sydney (e.g. &quot;Combretum erythrophyllum&quot;, &quot;Ficus superba var., Muelleri&quot; and, possibly, &quot;Ficus macrophylla subsp. columnaris&quot; and &quot;Quercus acutissima&quot;);
* Botanical collections such as camellia plantings by E. G. Waterhouse and rare cultural landscape groupings of significant trees;
* The intactness of the groupings of buildings across the history of the development of the site (i.e few have been demolished); and 
* All the above and others, that individually and together contribute to the overall unique and historic character of the site as a whole.

The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.

The University of Sydney, University Colleges and Victoria Park is of state significance as an item that demonstrates principal characteristics of a class of NSWs cultural place or environment as the site:

* Is one of the finest examples of connected landscapes in NSW with a continuous history from pre-colonial times to today. The University grounds are inextricably linked to Victoria Park and reflect Governor Phillip&#x27;s designated land reserve (1789) for school, Crown and church purposes, with an allowance for the &quot;formation of a park and garden in connection therewith&quot;. The developed landscapes having retained the topography and much of the original landform. The site retains elements of the early colonial Grose Farm, the establishment of the University and the colonial landscaping;
* Demonstrates the aspirations of colonial Sydney to shape its own society, polity and ideals, which ultimately led to the establishment of the University of Sydney and University Colleges by Acts of Parliament in 1850 and 1854 respectively. The University is a tangible representation of the early development of NSW and the development of the state and nation. It represents an important part of the development of NSW and Australia into the country that we see today. It is a significant example of the influence of government-funded education. The distribution of the University colleges around the periphery (separating the teaching buildings from the residential), stressed the communal nature of the University as a whole;
* Represents a microcosm of the development of architectural design, town planning and landscape design in New South Wales and Australia;
* Has been a major landmark of Sydney and NSW since its inception and reflects a fulfilment of Governor Phillip&#x27;s designated land reserve (1789) for school, Crown and church purposes, with an allowance for the &quot;formation of a park and garden in connection therewith&quot;. Prominence of the University was created with the placement of Edmund Blacket&#x27;s Main Quadrangle Building on the crest of Petersham Ridge, with sweeping views up to it from the main artery leaving the city, Parramatta Road. The positioning of the building was a conscious statement of the importance of the University. Victoria Park is unique within NSW as a contemporarily planned setting for a major 19th century university campus. Overall, many features of this large site retain their integrity from the date of their establishment. Such features include the alignment of the site boundaries and their treatments, the internal layout of many of the roads, the configuration of buildings and gardens and the uses of the buildings and precincts; and
* Is held in high esteem by the local community, local council, students, graduates, academics, staff, benefactors and sporting club members as an iconic place of historic, academic, cultural, sporting, recreational and social pursuits and events.

<text>In neurology, abulia, or aboulia (from , meaning &quot;will&quot;), refers to a lack of will or initiative and can be seen as a disorder of diminished motivation. Abulia falls in the middle of the spectrum of diminished motivation, with apathy being less extreme and akinetic mutism being more extreme than abulia. The condition was originally considered to be a disorder of the will, and aboulic individuals are unable to act or make decisions independently; and their condition may range in severity from subtle to overwhelming. In the case of akinetic mutism, many patients describe that as soon as they &quot;will&quot; or attempt a movement, a &quot;counter-will&quot; or &quot;resistance&quot; rises up to meet them.

==Symptoms and signs==
The clinical condition denoted &quot;abulia&quot; was first described in 1838; however, since that time, a number of different, some contradictory, definitions have emerged. Abulia has been described as a loss of drive, expression, behavior and speech output, with slowing and prolonged speech latency, and reduction of spontaneous thought content and initiative, being considered more recently as &#x27;a reduction in action emotion and cognition&#x27;. The clinical features most commonly associated with abulia are:

* Difficulty in initiating and sustaining purposeful movements
* Lack of spontaneous movement
* Reduced spontaneous speech
* Increased response-time to queries
* Passivity
* Reduced emotional responsiveness and spontaneity
* Reduced social interactions
* Reduced interest in usual pastimes

Especially in patients with progressive dementia, it may affect feeding. Patients may continue to chew or hold food in their mouths for hours without swallowing it. The behavior may be most evident after these patients have eaten part of their meals and no longer have strong appetites.

===Differentiation from other disorders===
Both neurologists and psychiatrists recognize abulia to be a distinct clinical entity, but its status as a syndrome is unclear. Although abulia has been known to clinicians since 1838, it has been subjected to different interpretations – from &#x27;a pure lack of will&#x27;, in the absence of motor paralysis to, more recently, being considered &#x27;a reduction in action emotion and cognition&#x27;. As a result of the changing definition of abulia, there is currently a debate on whether or not abulia is a sign or a symptom of another disease, or its own disease that seems to appear in the presence of other more well-researched diseases, such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

A 2002 survey of two movement disorder experts, two neuropsychiatrists, and two rehabilitation experts, did not seem to shed any light on the matter of differentiating abulia from other DDMs. The experts used the terms &quot;apathy&quot; and &quot;abulia&quot; interchangeably and debated whether or not abulia was a discrete entity, or just a hazy gray area on a spectrum of more defined disorders. Four of the experts said abulia was a sign and a symptom, and the group was split on whether or not it was a syndrome. Another survey, which consisted of true and false questions about what abulia is distinct from, whether it is a sign, symptom, or syndrome, where lesions are present in cases of abulia, what diseases are commonly associated with abulia, and what current treatments are used for abulia, was sent to 15 neurologists and 10 psychiatrists. Most experts agreed that abulia is clinically distinct from depression, akinetic mutism, and alexithymia. However, only 32% believed abulia was different from apathy, while 44% said they were not different, and 24% were unsure. Yet again, there was disagreement about whether or not abulia is a sign, symptom, or syndrome.

The study of motivation has been mostly about how stimuli come to acquire significance for animals. Only recently has the study of motivational processes been extended to integrate biological drives and emotional states in the explanation of purposeful behavior in human beings. Considering the number of disorders attributed to a lack of will and motivation, it is essential that abulia and apathy be defined more precisely to avoid confusion.

==Causes==
Many different causes of abulia have been suggested. While there is some debate about the validity of abulia as a separate disease, experts mostly agree that abulia is the result of frontal lesions and not with cerebellar or brainstem lesions. As a result of more and more evidence showing that the mesolimbic and the mesocortical dopamine system are key to motivation and responsiveness to reward, abulia may be a dopamine-related dysfunction. Abulia may also result from a variety of brain injuries which cause personality change, such as dementing illnesses, trauma, or intracerebral hemorrhage (stroke), especially stroke causing diffuse injury to the right hemisphere.

===Damage to the basal ganglia===
Injuries to the frontal lobe and/or the basal ganglia can interfere with an individual&#x27;s ability to initiate speech, movement, and social interaction. Studies have shown that 5-67% of all patients with traumatic brain injuries and 13% of patients with lesions on their basal ganglia experience some form of diminished motivation.

It may complicate rehabilitation when a stroke patient is uninterested in performing tasks like walking despite being capable of doing so. It should be differentiated from apraxia, when a brain injured patient has impairment in comprehending the movements necessary to perform a motor task despite not having any paralysis that prevents performing the task; that condition can also result in lack of initiation of activity.

===Damage to the capsular genu===
A case study involving two patients with acute confusional state and abulia was conducted to see if these symptoms were the result of an infarct in the capsular genu. Using clinical neuropsychological and MRI evaluations at baseline and one year later showed that the cognitive impairment was still there one year after the stroke. Cognitive and behavioral alterations due to a genu infarct are most likely because the thalamo-cortical projection fibers that originate from the ventral-anterior and medial-dorsal nuclei traverse the internal capsule genu. These tracts are part of a complex system of cortical and subcortical frontal circuits through which the flow of information from the entire cortex takes place before reaching the basal ganglia. Cognitive deterioration could have occurred through the genu infarcts affecting the inferior and anterior thalamic peduncles. In this case study the patients did not show any functional deficits at the follow-up one year after the stroke and were not depressed but did show diminished motivations. This result supports the idea that abulia may exist independently of depression as its own syndrome.

===Damage to anterior cingulate circuit===
The anterior cingulate circuit consists of the anterior cingulate cortex, also referred to as Brodmann area 24, and its projections to the ventral striatum which includes the ventromedial caudate. The loop continues to connect to the ventral pallidum, which connects to the ventral anterior nucleus of the thalamus. This circuit is essential for the initiation of behavior, motivation and goal orientation, which are the very things missing from a patient with a disorder of diminished motivation. Unilateral injury or injury along any point in the circuit leads to abulia regardless of the side of the injury, but if there is bilateral damage, the patient will exhibit a more extreme case of diminished motivation, akinetic mutism.

===Acute caudate vascular lesions===
It s well documented that the caudate nucleus is involved in degenerative diseases of the central nervous system such as Huntington disease. In a case study of 32 acute caudate stroke patients, 48% were found to be experiencing abulia. Most of the cases where abulia was present were when the patients had a left caudate infarct that extended into the putamen as seen through a CT or MRI scan.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis for abulia can be quite difficult because it falls between two other disorders of diminished motivation, and one could easily see an extreme case of abulia as akinetic mutism or a lesser case of abulia as apathy and therefore, not treat the patient appropriately. If it were to be confused with apathy, it might lead to attempts to involve the patient with physical rehabilitation or other interventions where a source of strong motivation would be necessary to succeed but would still be absent. The best way to diagnose abulia is through clinical observation of the patient as well as questioning of close relatives and loved ones to give the doctor a frame of reference with which they can compare the patient&#x27;s new behavior to see if there is in fact a case of diminished motivation. In recent years, imaging studies using a CT or MRI scan have been shown to be quite helpful in localizing brain lesions which have been shown to be one of the main causes of abulia.

===Conditions where abulia may be present===
* Normal pressure hydrocephalus
* Major depressive disorder
* Persistent depressive disorder
* Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
* Schizophrenia
* Frontotemporal dementia
* Parkinson&#x27;s disease
* Huntington&#x27;s disease
* Pick&#x27;s disease
* Progressive supranuclear palsy
* Traumatic brain injury
* Stroke

===Alzheimer&#x27;s disease===
A lack of motivation has been reported in 25–50% of patients with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. While depression is also common in patients with this disease, abulia is not a mere symptom of depressions because more than half of the patients with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease with abulia do not have depression. Several studies have shown that abulia is most prevalent in cases of severe dementia which may result from reduced metabolic activity in the prefrontal regions of the brain. Patients with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and abulia are significantly older than patients with Alzheimer&#x27;s who do not lack motivation. Going along with that, the prevalence of abulia increased from 14% in patients with a mild case Alzheimer&#x27;s disease to 61% in patients with a severe case of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, which most likely developed over time as the patient got older.

==Treatment==
Most current treatments for abulia are pharmacological, including the use of antidepressants. However, antidepressant treatment is not always successful and this has opened the door to alternative methods of treatment. The first step to successful treatment of abulia, or any other DDM, is a preliminary evaluation of the patient&#x27;s general medical condition and fixing the problems that can be fixed easily. This may mean controlling seizures or headaches, arranging physical or cognitive rehabilitation for cognitive and sensorimotor loss, or ensuring optimal hearing, vision, and speech. These elementary steps also increase motivation because improved physical status may enhance functional capacity, drive, and energy and thereby increase the patient&#x27;s expectation that initiative and effort will be successful.

There are 5 steps to pharmacological treatment:
# Optimize medical status.
# Diagnose and treat other conditions more specifically associated with diminished motivation (e.g., apathetic hyperthyroidism, Parkinson&#x27;s disease).
# Eliminate or reduce doses of psychotropics and other agents that aggravate motivational loss (e.g., SSRIs, dopamine antagonists).
# Treat depression efficaciously when both DDM and depression are present.
# Increase motivation through use of stimulants, dopamine agonists, or other agents such as cholinesterase inhibitors.

<text>The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Zone of Alienation, also called the 30-Kilometre Zone or simply The Zone, was established shortly after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in the Ukrainian SSR of the Soviet Union.

Initially, Soviet authorities declared an exclusion zone spanning a radius around the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, designating the area for evacuations and placing it under military control. Its borders have since been altered to cover a larger area of Ukraine: it includes the northernmost part of Vyshhorod Raion in Kyiv Oblast, and also adjoins the Polesie State Radioecological Reserve in neighbouring Belarus. The Chernobyl exclusion zone is managed by an agency of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine, while the power plant and its sarcophagus and the New Safe Confinement are administered separately.

The current area of approximately in Ukraine is where radioactive contamination is the highest, and public access and habitation are accordingly restricted. Other areas of compulsory resettlement and voluntary relocation not part of the restricted exclusion zone exist in the surrounding areas and throughout Ukraine. In February 2019, it was revealed that talks were underway to re-adjust the exclusion zone&#x27;s boundaries to reflect the declining radioactivity of its outer areas.

Public access to the exclusion zone is restricted in order to prevent access to hazardous areas, reduce the spread of radiological contamination, and conduct radiological and ecological monitoring activities. Today, the Chernobyl exclusion zone is one of the most radioactively contaminated areas on Earth and draws significant scientific interest for the high levels of radiation exposure in the environment, as well as increasing interest from disaster tourists. It has become a thriving sanctuary, with natural flora and fauna and some of the highest biodiversity and thickest forests in all of Ukraine, due primarily to the lack of human activity in the exclusion zone since 1986.

Since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the Chernobyl exclusion zone has been the site of fighting with neighbouring Russia, which captured Chernobyl on 24 February 2022. By April 2022, however, as the Kyiv offensive failed, the Russian military withdrew from the region. Ukrainian authorities have continued to keep the exclusion zone closed to tourists, pending the eventual cessation of hostilities in the Russo-Ukrainian War.

==History==

===Pre-1986: Before the Chernobyl nuclear disaster===
Historically and geographically, the zone is the heartland of the Polesia region. This predominantly rural woodland and marshland area was once home to 120,000 people living in the cities of Chernobyl and Pripyat as well as 187 smaller communities, but is now mostly uninhabited. All settlements remain designated on geographic maps but marked as () – &quot;uninhabited&quot;. The woodland in the area around Pripyat was a focal point of partisan resistance during the Second World War, which allowed evacuated residents to evade guards and return into the woods. In the woodland near the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant stood the &quot;Partisan&#x27;s Tree&quot; or &quot;Cross Tree&quot;, which was used to hang captured partisans. The tree fell down due to age in 1996 and a memorial now stands at its location.

===1986: Soviet exclusion zones===
==== 10-kilometre and 30-kilometre radius ====

The Exclusion Zone was established on soon after the Chernobyl disaster, when a Soviet government commission headed by Nikolai Ryzhkov decided on a &quot;rather arbitrary&quot; area of a radius from Reactor 4 as the designated evacuation area. The 30 km Zone was initially divided into three subzones: the area immediately adjacent to Reactor 4, an area of approximately radius from the reactor, and the remaining 30 km zone. Protective clothing and available facilities varied between these subzones.

Later in 1986, after updated maps of the contaminated areas were produced, the zone was split into three areas to designate further evacuation areas based on the revised dose limit of 100 mSv.
*the &quot;Black Zone&quot; (over 200 μSv·h−1), to which evacuees were never to return
*the &quot;Red Zone&quot; (50–200 μSv·h−1), where evacuees might return once radiation levels normalized
*the &quot;Blue Zone&quot; (30–50 μSv·h−1), where children and pregnant women were evacuated starting in the summer of 1986
Special permission for access and full military control was put in place in late 1986. Although evacuations were not immediate, 91,200 people were eventually evacuated from these zones.

In November 1986, control over activities in the zone was given to the new production association &quot;Kombinat&quot;. Based in the evacuated city of Chernobyl, the association&#x27;s responsibility was to operate the power plant, decontaminate the 30 km zone, supply materials and goods to the zone, and construct housing outside the new town of Slavutych for the power plant personnel and their families.

In March 1989, a &quot;Safe Living Concept&quot; was created for people living in contaminated zones beyond the Exclusion Zone in Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia. In October 1989, the Soviet government requested assistance from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to assess the &quot;Soviet Safe Living Concept&quot; for inhabitants of contaminated areas. &quot;Throughout the Soviet period, an image of containment was partially achieved through selective resettlements and territorial delineations of contaminated zones.&quot;

=== Post-1991: Independent Ukraine ===
In February 1991, the law &quot;On The Legal Status of the Territory Exposed to the Radioactive Contamination resulting from the ChNPP Accident&quot; was passed, updating the borders of the Exclusion Zone and defining obligatory and voluntary resettlement areas, and areas for enhanced monitoring. The borders were based on soil deposits of strontium-90, caesium-137, and plutonium as well as the calculated dose rate (sieverts/h) as identified by the National Commission for Radiation Protection of Ukraine. Responsibility for monitoring and coordination of activities in the Exclusion Zone was given to the Ministry of Chernobyl Affairs.

In-depth studies were conducted from 1992 to 1993, completing an update of the 1991 law followed by further evacuations from the Polesia area. A number of evacuation zones were determined: the &quot;Exclusion Zone&quot;, the &quot;Zone of Absolute (Mandatory) Resettlement&quot;, and the &quot;Zone of Guaranteed Voluntary Resettlement&quot;, as well as many areas throughout Ukraine designated as areas for radiation monitoring. The evacuation of contaminated areas outside of the Exclusion Zone continued in both the compulsory and voluntary resettlement areas, with 53,000 people evacuated from areas in Ukraine from 1990 to 1995.

After Ukrainian Independence, funding for the policing and protection of the zone was initially limited, resulting in even further settling by &quot;samosely&quot; (returnees) and other illegal intrusion.

In 1997, the areas of Poliske and Narodychi, which had been evacuated, were added to the existing area of the Exclusion Zone, and the zone now encompasses the exclusion zone and parts of the zone of Absolute (Mandatory) Resettlement of an area of approximately . This Zone was placed under management of the &#x27;Administration of the exclusion zone and the zone of absolute (mandatory) resettlement&#x27; within the Ministry of Emergencies.

On 15 December 2000, all nuclear power production at the power plant ceased after an official ceremony with then-President Leonid Kuchma when the last remaining operational reactor, number 3, was shut down.

==== Russian invasion of Ukraine (2022–present) ====
The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone was the site of fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces during the Battle of Chernobyl on 24 February 2022, as part of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russian forces reportedly captured the plant the same day.

Facilities at Chernobyl still require ongoing management, in part to ensure the continued cooling of spent nuclear fuel. An estimated 100 plant workers and 200 Ukrainian guards who were at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant when the Russians arrived had been unable to leave. Normally they would change shifts daily and would not live at the site. They had limited supplies of medication, food, and electricity.

According to Ukrainian reports, the radiation levels in the exclusion zone increased after the invasion. The higher levels are believed to be a result of disturbance of radioactive dust by the military activity or possibly incorrect readings caused by cyberattacks.

On 10 March, the International Atomic Energy Agency stated that it had lost all contact with Chernobyl.

On 22 March, the Ukrainian state agency responsible for the Chernobyl exclusion zone reported that Russian forces had destroyed a new laboratory at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. The laboratory, which opened in 2015, worked to improve the management of radioactive waste, among other things. &quot;The laboratory contained highly active samples and samples of radionuclides that are now in the hands of the enemy, which we hope will harm itself and not the civilized world&quot;, the agency said in its statement.

On 27 March, Lyudmila Denisova, then–Verkhovna Rada Commissioner for Human Rights, said that 31 known individual fires covering 10,000 hectares were burning in the zone. These fires caused &quot;...an increased level of radioactive air pollution&quot;, according to Denisova. Firefighters were unable to reach the fires due to the Russian forces in the area. These wildfires are seasonal; one fire that was 11,500 hectares in size took place in 2020, and a series of several smaller fires occurred throughout the 2010s.

On 31 March, it was reported that most of the Russian troops occupying Chernobyl withdrew. An Exclusion Zone employee made a post on Facebook suggesting that Russian troops were suffering from acute radiation sickness, based on a photo of military buses unloading near a radiation hospital in Belarus. Chernobyl operator Energoatom claimed that Russian troops had dug trenches in the most contaminated part of the Chernobyl exclusion zone, receiving &quot;significant doses&quot; of radiation. &quot;BBC News&quot; reported unconfirmed reports that some were being treated in Belarus.

On 3 April, Ukrainian forces retook the Chernobyl power plant.

== Population ==
The 30-kilometre zone is estimated to be home to 197 Samosely living in 11 villages as well as in the town of Chernobyl. This number is in decline, down from previous estimates of 314 in 2007 and 1,200 in 1986. These residents are senior citizens, with an average age of 63. After repeated attempts at expulsion, the authorities have accepted their presence and allowed them to stay with limited supporting services. Residence is now informally permitted by the Ukrainian government.

Approximately 3,000 people work in the Zone of Alienation on various tasks, such as the construction of the New Safe Confinement, the ongoing decommissioning of the reactors, and assessment and monitoring of the conditions in the zone. Employees do not live inside the zone, but work shifts there. Some of the workers work &quot;4-3&quot; shifts (four days on, three days off), while others work 15 days on and 15 days off. Other workers commute into the zone daily from Slavutych. The duration of shifts is counted strictly for reasons involving pension and healthcare. Everyone employed in the Zone is monitored for internal bioaccumulation of radioactive elements.

The town of Chernobyl, located outside of the 10-kilometre Exclusion Zone, was evacuated following the accident but now serves as a base to support the workers within the Exclusion Zone. Its amenities include administrative buildings, general stores, a canteen, a hotel, and a bus station. Unlike other areas within the Exclusion Zone, the town is actively maintained by workers, such as lawn areas being mowed and autumn leaves being collected.

===Access and tourism===
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian invasion there were many visitors to the Exclusion Zone annually, and daily tours from Kyiv. In addition, multiple-day excursions can be easily arranged with Ukrainian tour operators. Most overnight tourists stay in a hotel within the town of Chernobyl, which is located within the Exclusion Zone. According to an exclusion area tour guide, as of 2017, there are approximately 50 licensed exclusion area tour guides in total, working for approximately nine companies. Visitors must present their passports when entering the Exclusion Zone and are screened for radiation when exiting, both at the 10 km checkpoint and at the 30 km checkpoint.

The Exclusion Zone can also be entered if an application is made directly to the zone administration department.

Some evacuated residents of Pripyat have established a remembrance tradition, which includes annual visits to former homes and schools. In the Chernobyl zone, there is one operating Eastern Orthodox church, St. Elijah Church. According to Chernobyl disaster liquidators, the radiation levels there are &quot;well below the level across the zone&quot;, a fact that president of the Ukrainian Chernobyl Union Yury Andreyev considers miraculous.

The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone has been accessible to interested parties such as scientists and journalists since the zone was created. An early example was Elena Filatova&#x27;s online account of her alleged solo bike ride through the zone. This gained her Internet fame, but was later alleged to be fictional, as a guide claimed Filatova was part of an official tour group. Regardless, her story drew the attention of millions to the nuclear catastrophe. After Filatova&#x27;s visit in 2004, a number of papers such as &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; began to produce reports on tours to the zone.

Tourism to the area became more common after Pripyat was featured in popular video games &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl&quot; and &quot;Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare&quot;. Fans of the &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.&quot; franchise, who refer to themselves as &quot;stalkers&quot;, often gain access to the Zone. (&quot;The Zone&quot; and &quot;stalker&quot; derive from Arkady and Boris Strugatsky&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;Roadside Picnic&quot;, which preceded the accident but which described the evacuation of part of Russia after the appearance of dangerous alien artifacts. It served as the basis for the classic film &quot;Stalker&quot;.) Prosecution of trespassers became more severe after a significant increase in trespassing in the Exclusion Zone. An article in the penal code of Ukraine was specially introduced, and horse patrols were added to protect the zone&#x27;s perimeter.

In 2012, journalist Andrew Blackwell published &quot;Visit Sunny Chernobyl: And Other Adventures in the World&#x27;s Most Polluted Places&quot;. Blackwell recounts his visit to the Exclusion Zone, when a guide and driver took him through the zone and to the reactor site.

On 14 April 2013, the 32nd episode of the wildlife documentary TV program &quot;River Monsters&quot; (&quot;Atomic Assassin&quot;, Season 5, Episode 1) was broadcast, featuring the host Jeremy Wade catching a wels catfish in the cooling pools of the Chernobyl power plant at the heart of the Exclusion Zone.

On 16 February 2014, an episode of the British motoring TV programme &quot;Top Gear&quot; was broadcast, featuring two of the presenters, Jeremy Clarkson and James May, driving into the Exclusion Zone.

A portion of the finale of the Netflix documentary &quot;Our Planet&quot;, released in 2019, was filmed in the Exclusion Zone. The area was used as the primary example of how quickly an ecosystem can recover and thrive in the absence of human interference.

In 2019, Chernobyl Spirit Company released Atomik Vodka, the first consumer product made from materials grown and cultivated in the exclusion zone.

On 11 April 2022, the zone administration department suspended the validity of passes that allowed access to the exclusion zone, for the duration of martial law in Ukraine.

=== Illegal activities ===
The poaching of game, illegal logging, and metal salvage have been problems within the zone. Despite police control, intruders started infiltrating the perimeter to remove potentially contaminated materials, from televisions to toilet seats, especially in Pripyat, where the residents of about 30 high-rise apartment buildings had to leave all of their belongings behind. In 2007, the Ukrainian government adopted more severe criminal and administrative penalties for illegal activities in the alienation zone, as well as reinforced units assigned to these tasks. The population of Przewalski&#x27;s horse, introduced to the Exclusion Zone in 1998, has reportedly fallen since 2005 due to poaching.

==Administration==

===Government agencies===
In April 2011, the State Agency of Ukraine on the Exclusion Zone Management (SAUEZM) became the successor to the State Department – Administration of the exclusion zone and the zone of absolute (mandatory) resettlement according to presidential decree. The SAUEZM is, as its predecessor, an agency within the State Emergency Service of Ukraine.

Policing of the Zone is conducted by special units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine and, along the border with Belarus, by the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine.

The SAUEZM is tasked with:
# Conducting environmental and radioactivity monitoring in the zone
# Management of long-term storage and disposal of radioactive waste
# Leasing of land in the exclusion zone and the zone of absolute (mandatory) resettlement
# Administering of state funds for radioactive waste management
# Monitoring and preservation of documentation on the subject of radioactivity
# Coordination of the decommissioning of the nuclear power plant
# Maintenance of a register of persons who have suffered as a result of the disaster

The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is located inside the zone but is administered separately. Plant personnel, 3,800 workers , reside primarily in Slavutych, a specially-built remote city in Kyiv Oblast outside of the Exclusion Zone, east of the accident site.

===Checkpoints===
There are 11 checkpoints.
* Dytiatky, near the village of Dytiatky
* Stari Sokoly, near the village of 
* Zelenyi Mys, near the village of 
* Poliske, near the village of 
* Ovruch, near the village of Davydky, Narodychi settlement hromada, Korosten Raion
* Vilcha, near the village of 
* Dibrova, near the village of 
* Benivka, near the city of Pripyat
* The city of Pripyat itself
* Leliv, near the city of Chernobyl
* Paryshiv, between the city of Chernobyl and the border with Belarus (route P56)

====Development and recovery projects====
The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone is an environmental recovery area, with efforts devoted to remediation and safeguarding of the reactor site. At the same time, projects for wider economic and social revival of the territories around the disaster zone have been envisioned or implemented.

In November 2007, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for &quot;recovery and sustainable development&quot; of the areas affected by the Chernobyl accident. Commenting on the issue, UN Development Programme officials mentioned the plans to achieve &quot;self-reliance&quot; of the local population, &quot;agriculture revival&quot; and development of ecotourism.

However, it is not clear whether such plans, made by the UN and then-President Victor Yushchenko, deal with the &quot;zone of alienation&quot; proper, or only with the other three zones around the disaster site where contamination is less intense and restrictions on the population are looser (such as the district of Narodychi in Zhytomyr Oblast).

Since 2011, tour operators have been bringing tourists inside the Exclusion Zone (illegal tours may have started even before). Tourists are accompanied by tour guides at all times and are not able to wander too far on their own due to the presence of several radioactive &quot;hot spots&quot;. Pripyat was deemed safe for tourists to visit for a short period of time in the late 2010s, although certain precautions must be taken.

In 2016, the Ukrainian government declared the part of the exclusion zone on its territory the Chernobyl Radiation and Environmental Biosphere Reserve.

It was reported in 2016 that &quot;A heavily contaminated area within a 10-kilometer radius&quot; of the plant would be used for the storage of nuclear waste. The IAEA carried out a feasibility study in 2018 to assess the prospect of expanding the local waste management infrastructure.

In 2017, three companies were reported developing plans for solar farms within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. The high feed-in tariffs offered, the availability of land, and easy access to transmission lines (which formerly ran to the nuclear power station) have all been noted as beneficial to siting a solar farm. The solar plant began operations in October 2018.

In 2019, following a three-year research project into the transfer of radioactivity to crops grown in the exclusion zone conducted by scientists from UK and Ukrainian universities, one bottle of vodka using grain from the zone was produced. The vodka did not contain abnormal levels of radiation because of the distillation process. The researchers consider the production of vodka, and its sales profits, a means to aid economic recovery of the communities most adversely affected by the disaster. The project later switched to producing and exporting &quot;Atomik&quot; apple spirit, made from apples grown in the Narodychi District.

==Radioactive contamination==

The territory of the zone is polluted unevenly. Spots of hyperintensive pollution were created first by wind and rain spreading radioactive dust at the time of the accident, and subsequently by numerous burial sites for various material and equipment used in decontamination. Zone authorities pay attention to protecting such spots from tourists, scrap hunters, and wildfires, but admit that some dangerous burial sites remain unmapped, and only recorded in the memories of the (aging) Chernobyl liquidators.

===Flora and fauna===

There has been an ongoing scientific debate about the extent to which flora and fauna of the zone were affected by the radioactive contamination that followed the accident. As noted by Baker and Wickliffe, one of many issues is differentiating between negative effects of Chernobyl radiation and effects of changes in farming activities resulting from human evacuation.

Near the facility, a dense cloud of radioactive dust killed off a large area of Scots pine trees; the rusty orange color of the dead trees led to the nickname &quot;The Red Forest&quot; (&quot;Рудий ліс&quot;). The Red Forest was among the world&#x27;s most radioactive places; to reduce the hazard, the Red Forest was bulldozed and the highly radioactive wood was buried, though the soil continues to emit significant radiation. Other species in the same area, such as birch trees, survived, indicating that plant species may vary considerably in their sensitivity to radiation.

Cases of mutant deformity in animals of the zone include partial albinism and other external malformations in swallows and insect mutations. A study of several hundred birds belonging to 48 different species also demonstrated that birds inhabiting highly radioactively contaminated areas had smaller brains compared to birds from clean areas.

A reduction in the density and the abundance of animals in highly radioactively contaminated areas has been reported for several taxa, including birds, insects, spiders, and mammals. In birds, which are an efficient bioindicator, a negative correlation has been reported between background radiation and bird species richness. Scientists such as Anders Pape Møller (University of Paris-Sud) and Timothy Mousseau (University of South Carolina) report that birds and smaller animals such as voles may be particularly affected by radioactivity.

Møller is the first author on 9 of the 20 most-cited articles relating to the ecology, evolution and non-human biology in the Chernobyl area. However, some of Møller&#x27;s research has been criticized as flawed. Prior to his work at Chernobyl, Møller was accused of falsifying data in a 1998 paper about asymmetry in oak leaves, which he retracted in 2001. In 2004, the Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty (DCSD) reported that Møller was guilty of &quot;scientific dishonesty&quot;. The French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) subsequently concluded that there was insufficient evidence to establish either guilt or innocence. Strongly held opinions about Møller and his work have contributed to the difficulty of reaching a scientific consensus on the effects of radiation on wildlife in the Exclusion Zone.

More recently, the populations of large mammals have increased due to a significant reduction of human interference. The populations of traditional Polesian animals (such as the gray wolf, badger, wild boar, roe deer, white-tailed eagle, black stork, western marsh harrier, short-eared owl, red deer, moose, great egret, whooper swan, least weasel, common kestrel, and beaver) have multiplied enormously and begun expanding outside the zone. The zone is considered as a classic example of an involuntary park.

The return of wolves and other animals to the area is being studied by scientists such as Marina Shkvyria (National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine), Sergey Gaschak (Chernobyl Centre in Ukraine), and Jim Beasley (University of Georgia). Camera traps have been installed and are used to record the presence of species. Studies of wolves, which are concentrated in higher-radiation areas near the center of the exclusion zone, may enable researchers to better assess relationships between radiation levels, animal health, and population dynamics.

The area also houses herds of European bison (native to the area) and Przewalski&#x27;s horses (foreign to the area, as the extinct tarpan was the native wild horse) released there after the accident. Some accounts refer to the reappearance of extremely rare native lynx, and there are videos of brown bears and their cubs, an animal not seen in the area for more than a century. Special game warden units are organized to protect and control them. No scientific study has been conducted on the population dynamics of these species.

The rivers and lakes of the zone pose a significant threat of spreading polluted silt during spring floods. They are systematically secured by dikes.

===Grass and forest fires===

It is known that fires can make contamination mobile again. In particular, V.I. Yoschenko &quot;et al.&quot; reported on the possibility of increased mobility of caesium, strontium, and plutonium due to grass and forest fires. As an experiment, fires were set and the levels of the radioactivity in the air downwind of these fires were measured.

Grass and forest fires have happened inside the contaminated zone, releasing radioactive fallout into the atmosphere. In 1986, a series of fires destroyed of forest, and several other fires have since burned within the zone. A serious fire in early May 1992 affected of land, including of forest. This resulted in a great increase in the levels of caesium-137 in airborne dust.

In 2010, a series of wildfires affected contaminated areas, specifically the surroundings of Bryansk and border regions with Belarus and Ukraine. The Russian government claimed that there was no discernible increase in radiation levels, while Greenpeace accused the government of denial.

On 4 April 2020, a fire broke in the Zone on at least 20 hectares of Ukrainian forests. Approximately 90 firefighters were deployed to extinguish the blaze, as well as a helicopter and two aircraft. Radiation is still present in these forests, making firefighting more difficult; authorities stated that there was no danger to the surrounding population. The previous reported fire was in June 2018.

===Current state of the ecosystem===
Despite the negative effect of the disaster on human life, many scientists see an overall beneficial effect to the ecosystem. Though the immediate effects of the accident were negative, the area quickly recovered and is today seen as very healthy. The lack of people in the area has increased the biodiversity of the Exclusion Zone in the years since the disaster.

In the aftermath of the disaster, radioactive contamination in the air had a decidedly negative effect on the fauna, vegetation, rivers, lakes, and groundwater of the area. The radiation resulted in deaths among coniferous plants, soil invertebrates, and mammals, as well as a decline in reproductive numbers among both plants and animals.

The surrounding forest was covered in radioactive particles, resulting in the death of 400 hectares of the most immediate pine trees, though radiation damage can be found in an area of tens of thousands of hectares. An additional concern is that as the dead trees in the Red Forest (named for the color of the dead pines) decay, contamination is leaking into the groundwater.

Despite all this, Professor Nick Beresford, an expert on Chernobyl and ecology, said that &quot;the overall effect was positive&quot; for the wildlife in the area.

The impact of radiation on individual animals has not been studied, but cameras in the area have captured evidence of a resurgence of the mammalian population – including rare animals such as the lynx and the vulnerable European bison.

Research on the health of Chernobyl&#x27;s wildlife is ongoing, and there is concern that the wildlife still suffers from some of the negative effects of the radiation exposure. Though it will be years before researchers collect the necessary data to fully understand the effects, for now, the area is essentially one of Europe&#x27;s largest nature preserves. Overall, an assessment by plant biochemist Stuart Thompson concluded, &quot;the burden brought by radiation at Chernobyl is less severe than the benefits reaped from humans leaving the area.&quot; In fact, the ecosystem around the power plant &quot;supports more life than before&quot;.

==Infrastructure==

The industrial, transport, and residential infrastructure has been largely crumbling since the 1986 evacuation. There are at least 800 known &quot;burial grounds&quot; (Ukrainian singular: &quot;mohyl&#x27;nyk&quot;) for the contaminated vehicles with hundreds of abandoned military vehicles and helicopters. River ships and barges lie in the abandoned port of Chernobyl. The port can easily be seen in satellite images of the area. The Jupiter Factory, one of the largest buildings in the zone, was in use until 1996 but has since been abandoned and its condition is deteriorating.
The infrastructure immediately used by the existing nuclear-related installations is maintained and developed, such as the railway link to the outside world from the Semykhody station used by the power plant.

===Chernobyl-2===
The Chernobyl-2 site (a.k.a. the &quot;Russian Woodpecker&quot;) is a former Soviet military installation relatively close to the power plant, consisting of a gigantic transmitter and receiver belonging to the Duga-1 over-the-horizon radar system. Located from the surface area of Chernobyl-2 is a large underground complex that was used for anti-missile defense, space surveillance and communication, and research. Military units were stationed there.

<doc id="1021630" wikidata="Q1135830" url="?curid=1021630" title="Sadamichi Hirasawa">
<text>was a Japanese tempera painter. He was convicted of mass poisoning and sentenced to death. Due to strong suspicions that he was innocent, no justice minister ever signed his death warrant.

==Teigin case==

On January 26, 1948, a man calling himself an epidemiologist arrived at a branch of the Imperial Bank (Teikoku Ginkō, aka Teigin) in Shiinamachi, a suburb of Toshima, Tokyo, shortly before closing time. He explained that he was a public health official sent by US occupation authorities who had orders to inoculate the staff against a sudden outbreak of dysentery. He gave each of the sixteen people present a pill and a few drops of liquid. Those present drank the liquid he gave, which was later thought to be &quot;nitrile hydrocyanide&quot; (青酸ニトリール), an assassination toxicant originally developed at the Noborito Laboratory. When all were incapacitated, the robber took some money lying on the desks, which amounted to 160,000 yen (about $2,000 US at the time), but left the majority behind, leaving his motive unknown. Ten of the victims died at the scene (one was a child of an employee) and two others died while hospitalized.

==Arrest and trial==
Hirasawa was caught by the police due to the Japanese habit of exchanging business cards with personal details. There had been two other extremely similar cases of attempted and actual theft at banks via the use of poison in the weeks and months before the robbery. In all cases the poisoner, a lone male, left a business card. The poisoner used a card which was marked &quot;Jirō Yamaguchi&quot; in one of the two incidents, but it was later found that said Yamaguchi did not exist: the card was a fake. The poisoner also used a real card which was marked &quot;Shigeru Matsui&quot; (of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Department of Disease Prevention) in another of the two incidents. The original owner of the card was found to have an alibi. Matsui told the police that he had exchanged cards with 593 people, but of these, 100 were of the type used in the poisoning incidents, of which eight remained in his possession. Matsui recorded the time and place of the business card exchange on the back of cards he received so the police set out to trace the remaining 92 cards. 62 cards were retrieved and their originators cleared; a further 22 were deemed to have been irrelevant to the case. One of the remaining 8 cards was received by Hirasawa. The police were led to arrest Hirasawa because:
#He could not produce the card he had received from Matsui. Hirasawa claimed to have lost the business card, together with his wallet, due to his having been the victim of pickpocketing.
#A similar amount of money to that stolen from the bank was found in Hirasawa&#x27;s possession, the origin of which he refused to divulge. The origin of the money is unknown to this day (though some, such as the crime fiction novelist Seichō Matsumoto, suggested Hirasawa received it by drawing pornographic pictures, a side business that would have been detrimental to Hirasawa&#x27;s reputation as an artist).
#Hirasawa&#x27;s alibi of having been taking a stroll in the vicinity of the crime scene could be neither verified nor substantiated.
#Hirasawa was identified as the poisoner by several witnesses (but only by two survivors, and see picture below).
#He confessed to having been involved in four previous cases of bank fraud (recanted together with his subsequent confession).

He was arrested on August 21, 1948. After police interrogation, which allegedly involved torture, Hirasawa confessed, but then recanted soon after. His later defence against his confession was based on partial insanity, alleging that he had been troubled with Korsakoff&#x27;s syndrome (as a result of rabies inoculation) and so his confession was not reliable. The court, however, disagreed and Hirasawa was sentenced to death in 1950. Until 1949, a confession was solid evidence under the law, even if the police tortured a person to extract said confession. The Supreme Court of Japan upheld the death sentence in 1955. His attorneys tried to have the sentence revoked, submitting 18 pleas for retrial over the following years.

==Doubt over guilty verdict==

He was sentenced to death, but there was originally no conclusive evidence. In addition, although 40 employees saw the crimes, there were only two people who identified him as the criminal. Seichō Matsumoto presumed that the true culprit was a former member of Unit 731 in his books &quot;A story of the Teikoku Bank Incident&quot; in 1959 and &quot;The Black Fog of Japan&quot; in 1960. Matsumoto also suspected that &quot;the money of unknown origin&quot; came from selling pornographic drawings. Kei Kumai protested Hirasawa&#x27;s conviction with his film &quot;Teigin jiken: Shikeishû&quot; (&quot;Teigin Incident: Condemned&quot; / &quot;The Long Death&quot;) in 1964.

Successive Ministers of Justice in Japan did not sign his death warrant, so the death sentence was never carried out. Even Isaji Tanaka, who on 13 October 1967 announced in front of the press that he had signed the death warrants of 23 prisoners in one go, did not sign Hirasawa&#x27;s death warrant, stating that he doubted Hirasawa&#x27;s guilt.

The poison was regarded as the readily obtainable potassium cyanide in Hirasawa&#x27;s trial. One of the reasons given to doubt Hirasawa&#x27;s guilt is because the victims&#x27; symptoms were clearly different from potassium cyanide poisoning, which is rapid. Keio University&#x27;s contemporary investigation claimed that the true poison may have been acetone cyanohydrin, a military poison deliberately designed to be slow-acting, which Hirasawa could not have obtained.

==Death in prison==
Hirasawa remained in prison as a condemned criminal for the next 32 years. He spent his time painting and writing his autobiography .

In 1981, Makoto Endo became the leader of Hirasawa&#x27;s lawyers. Beside this case, he took part in controversial trials such as that of Norio Nagayama. The defense claimed that statute of limitations for his death penalty ran out in 1985. The death penalty has a 30-year statute of limitations under the Criminal Code of Japan, and so Endo appealed for his release. However, the Japanese court refused this argument, pointing out that the statute only applies in the case if a death row inmate escapes from prison and evades capture for 30 years. Japanese courts judge that the punishment begins when the minister signs the death warrant, which had never been done. His health deteriorated in 1987. On April 30, 1987, Amnesty International petitioned the Japanese government to release him, but Hirasawa died of pneumonia in a prison hospital on May 10.

==Bids for a posthumous retrial==
Even after Hirasawa&#x27;s death, his son by adoption, Takehiko Hirasawa, tried to clear his name. Takehiko was the son of one of Sadamichi&#x27;s supporters; he became the painter&#x27;s adopted son while in university to take up the task of getting a retrial for Sadamichi, as his relatives were reluctant to pursue the case due to social prejudice. Takehiko also worked to recover several of Sadamichi&#x27;s lost paintings and held exhibitions of his work. He and his lawyers submitted a 19th plea for retrial; Sadamichi&#x27;s brain damage was also proved. , his lawyers had submitted new evidence to attempt to prove Hirasawa&#x27;s innocence.

In September 2013, Takehiko Hirasawa died alone at his home in Suginami Ward, Tokyo, aged 54; he had lived there with his natural mother until her death at age 83 the previous December. His body was only found on 16 October by several retrial supporters who had worried about not hearing from him in some time. According to supporters, the pressures and uncertainties surrounding the reopening of the case, together with his mother&#x27;s death, had caused Takehiko to periodically display signs of instability and doubts about whether he could continue. He continued to persist with his objective of getting a posthumous retrial, though - writing after his mother&#x27;s death on a website about the &quot;Teigin Incident&quot;:

It was her wish and mine and my late father’s to mark in history that Sadamichi Hirasawa is innocent. I will continue this struggle for years to come.
At the time of Takehiko&#x27;s death, he and his lawyers had assembled a team of psychologists to reexamine the witness accounts and investigation process from the trial, to determine if the evidence was credible by present standards. They had been scheduled to submit their position papers to the Tokyo High Court by the end of 2013, ahead of the court verdict on the retrial petition.

On 4 December 2013, the Tokyo High Court announced it would drop the plea for a posthumous retrial for Sadamichi Hirasawa following his adopted son&#x27;s death. As a result, the court effectively declared the case closed, unless other members of the Hirasawa family wish to pursue a retrial.

==In popular culture==
The Teigin incident is the basis for &quot;The Aosawa Murders&quot;, a 2005 Japanese crime novel written by Riku Onda, which describes a fictional mass poisoning case in Japan in 1973. This novel won the Mystery Writers of Japan Award for best Japanese crime fiction in 2006. A 2009 novel, &quot;Occupied City&quot; by English author David Peace, who was long a resident in Japan, is based on the Hirasawa case. The case is also referenced in Ian Fleming&#x27;s 11th James Bond novel, &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (1964), though embellished and exaggerated.

In 1964, Nikkatsu released &quot;Teigin jiken: Shikeishû&quot; (&quot;Teigin Incident: Condemned&quot; / &quot;The Long Death&quot;), a docudrama-style recounting of the case. Directed by Kei Kumai, the film provided actor Kinzō Shin with a rare starring role as Hirasawa.

<doc id="1021641" wikidata="Q2686639" url="?curid=1021641" title="Therese Grankvist">
<text>Therese Grankvist (born 2 May 1977) is a Swedish singer and songwriter. She started recording in 1997 under the Drömhus alias, and goes by Therese since the release of her single &quot;Monkey&quot; in 2002. She may be best known for her internationally successful collaborations with Swedish DJ and producer StoneBridge, &quot;Put &#x27;Em High&quot; and &quot;Take Me Away&quot;, released on Hed Kandi in 2004.

Therese started her own label Vixon Records in 2014.

==Early life==
Therese Grankvist spent her childhood in Nässjö, Sweden. She later moved to Tullinge (near Stockholm) at the age of 13.

==Career==
===1997–2000: Drömhus and Melodifestivalen===
Therese&#x27;s career started when she called a record company and recorded her singing on their answering machine. When she later met Dr. Alban, he convinced her to join the new eurodance project Drömhus. At first, Drömhus was meant to consist of two men and Therese, but eventually shrank to just Therese and the producers.

In 1997, Drömhus&#x27;s first single &quot;Du och jag&quot; (&quot;You and I&quot;) was released. The big breakthrough, however, came in 1998 with the single &quot;Vill ha dig&quot; (&quot;Want You&quot;), a cover of a hit by the band Freestyle in the 1980s.

In 1999, Drömhus competed in the Melodifestivalen, the Swedish national selection for Eurovision Song Contest, with the song &quot;Stjärna på himmelen&quot; (&quot;Star in the Sky&quot;). It finished second, thus not qualifying for the Eurovision Song Contest. In 2000, Therese announced that she would leave Drömhus to perform under the mononym Therese instead.

===2001–2004: &quot;Acapulco&quot; and work with StoneBridge===
Therese&#x27;s first singles, &quot;Monkey&quot; and &quot;I Need Somebody&quot;, were released in 2002, in advance of her debut album &quot;Acapulco&quot;, released early 2003 on Swedish record label Tretiak. It was her first album released under the alias Therese, containing elements of electronica, house and breakbeat, and was produced by Klas B Wahl and Swedish DJ and producer StoneBridge. Late 2003, Therese released the track &quot;Time&quot;. It was released on Robbins Entertainment in the US in 2004.

In 2004, Therese collaborated with StoneBridge on two house tracks, &quot;Put &#x27;Em High&quot; and &quot;Take Me Away&quot;, both released on record label Hed Kandi in the UK. Especially &quot;Put &#x27;Em High&quot; was a remarkable success, with the track also featured on Hed Kandi&#x27;s greatest hits collection &quot;Hed Kandi: Ibiza 10 Years&quot; in 2012.

===2005–2009: Multiple non-album releases===
In 2005, Therese co-wrote and provided backing vocals for Dannii Minogue&#x27;s &quot;Perfection&quot; which was produced by the Soul Seekerz.

Grankvist, together with The Attic, competed with the song &quot;The Arrival&quot; at Melodifestivalen 2007 on 17 February 2007 for the opportunity to represent Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 in Helsinki, Finland. They ended 7th place in Heat 3, not qualifying for the final of Melodifestivalen.

Therese released a new single, &quot;Feelin&#x27; Me&quot;, in the UK on Positiva Records in May 2007. The track was produced by Digital Dog and came with remixes by Thomas Gold and Armand Van Helden, amongst others. The B-side was produced by Thomas Gold, titled &quot;How Do You Wanna?&quot;.

On 2 June 2007, Therese, featuring The Attic, performed their single &quot;The Arrival&quot; on Sommarkrysset, a Swedish TV show that airs in summer. She again appeared on Sommarkrysset in August 2007, together with Danny Saucedo performing the song &quot;If Only You&quot; from Danny&#x27;s album.

Furthermore, Grankvist provided vocals for &quot;Another Love&quot; by The Mac Project in 2008 and &quot;Neon Lights&quot; by Elek-Tro Junkies in 2009. She also released the track &quot;Shed My Skin&quot; on Lifted House/disco:wax in Denmark in 2009.

===2010–present: &quot;Missing Disco&quot; and Vixon Records===
On 28 May 2010, Therese released a new single in Sweden, titled &quot;Drop It Like It&#x27;s Hot&quot;, featuring elements of electro, tribal house and dance-pop. A B-side, &quot;Say It (In the Morning)&quot;, and remixes by the Wideboys and Alesso were released as well, with the latter eventually featured on the second album, &quot;Missing Disco&quot;. In 2011, at the pre-listening party of Lady Gaga&#x27;s &quot;Born This Way&quot; album in Stockholm, Therese performed a mashup of &quot;Drop It Like It&#x27;s Hot&quot; and Lady Gaga&#x27;s &quot;Born This Way&quot;.

In 2011, &quot;Remedy&quot; was released as the second single from &quot;Missing Disco&quot;. It was re-released in the UK in 2014 with new remixes by Seamus Haji, DANK and Papercha$er, amongst others. This marked the first release on Therese&#x27;s own label Vixon Records, founded in 2014.

Early 2015, the title track off the album, &quot;Missing Disco&quot;, was released as the third single, featuring an extended version as well as remixes by Rich B &amp; Phil Marriott, Chris Henry, Phonetix and Gordon John. The track and remixes premiered on Therese&#x27;s SoundCloud page.

Originally set for a late 2011 release, &quot;Missing Disco&quot; was released on 10 May 2015.

==Charitable work==

<text>Anda, officially the Municipality of Anda (Bolinao: Babali nin Anda; ; ; ), is a municipality in the province of Pangasinan, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 41,548 people.

== History ==
On the north-west portion of Lingayen Gulf lies a group of islands which comprise the territory of Anda.

Before the middle of the nineteenth century, the islands which comprise the municipality were uninhabited. Only occasionally did seafarers and fishermen use the coast as havens.

Andres de la Cruz Cacho, fondly called in Bolinao as Andales Kulayo, discovered a vast tract of land suitable for grazing and fertile lowlands, and an abundant spring for agriculture. It was he who brought families from the town of Bolinao aboard a big boat and dispersed them on the island of Cabarruyan in 1842. The spread of population was rapid.

On May 10, 1842, the pioneers landed on what is now the barrio of Dolaoan, put up a settlement, and chose San Miguel Arcangel as their Patron Saint. On May 25, 1842, they established Carot and Cabungan with Santa Lucia as the common Saint of the two settlements.

In the first of June of same year, Tondol was founded. Sablig was settled in the middle of June. By the third week of June, Macaleeng was occupied.

No family was willing, to stay in Toritori at the time and so the place was bypassed. The settlers proceeded to Awile and Aruab (now Roxas) and by early July, they have established settlements in the area.

By August, Mal-Ong, Awag, Santa Rita, and San Nicolas were established. Within a period of only four months, May to August, 1842, the whole island of Cabarruyan was populated.

A steady stream of settlers followed the first pioneers and soon within a few years, the population was large enough to form a municipality.

In January, 1849 a conference of leaders was called by Don Pablo Cacho Valerio through his son Don Domingo with the end in view to established a new town. The leaders drafted a petition for the creation of a new town and sent copies on March 15, 1849, to Don Jose Sanchez y Guerrero, the then Alcalde at Iba, Zambales and to the Archbishop of Manila.

On May 26, 1849, the Alcalde brought the reply granting the petition. Accompanied by the Parish Priest, Rev. Fr. Juan Migrano, Capitan Felipe Cacho Valerio, and other municipal officials of Bolinao, the Alcalde came to Cabarruyan to choose a suitable location for the town site. They agreed on Segat in the center of the island which is now known as Namagbagan. The site for the plaza, church, town hall, convent, cemetery, and streets were laid out on January 20, 1850, by order of the Alcalde.

Anda was once a part of the municipality of Bolinao.

==Geography==
The municipality consists primarily of Cabarruyan Island (also known as Anda Island), as well as minor surrounding islets. Because of Anda&#x27;s proximity near the Hundred Islands, a popular tourist destination for its caves and beaches, it is the so-called &quot;Mother of the Hundred Islands.&quot;

Anda is from Lingayen and from Manila.

=== Barangays ===
Anda is politically subdivided into 18 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.
* Awile
* Awag
* Batiarao
* Cabungan
* Carot
* Dolaoan
* Imbo
* Macaleeng
* Macando-candong
* Mal-ong
* Namagbagan
* Poblacion
* Roxas
* Sablig
* San Jose
* Siapar
* Tondol
* Tori-tori
===Climate===

==Demographics==
=== Language ===
The people of Anda generally speak Pangasinan, Bolinao, and Ilocano. Unique in this part of the province, the Sambalic language of Bolinao or Binubolinao is primarily spoken in the municipality and the adjacent town of Bolinao.

== Economy ==

The town thrives on farming and deep-sea fishing.

In the past, progress in the town was sluggish due to its dependence to a landing barge to cross the Catubig Channel separating Anda to mainland Bolinao. In 1996, trade has increased due to a bridge connecting the municipality to the mainland. This bridge, known as Anda Bridge, was sponsored and inaugurated by then President Fidel V. Ramos, who hails from Pangasinan. Main roads have been concreted for faster access to the barangays, especially tourism related places.

==Government==
===Local government===

Anda, belonging to the first congressional district of the province of Pangasinan, is governed by a mayor designated as its local chief executive and by a municipal council as its legislative body in accordance with the Local Government Code. The mayor, vice mayor, and the councilors are elected directly by the people through an election which is being held every three years.

===Elected officials===

== Transportation ==

The town is accessible through land transportation. Two main bus companies serve commuters to and from Anda to Manila or neighboring towns and cities. These are Dagupan Bus Co., Inc.and Pangasinan Five Star Bus Co. Mini buses and jeepneys are also available for commuters going to neighboring towns and cities, like Alaminos and Dagupan.

== Fossil Finds ==

In the year 2000, fossils were found in barangay San Jose and barangay Awile. Fossils in barangay Awile were found only a few centimeters from the surface due to extensive erosion in the area. In San Jose, the fossils were discovered 3 meters from the ground surface. Most of the fossils were found in clay layer with limestone rubbles.

Among the faunal fossils discovered were from Stegodon sp., Elephas sp (large)., Elephas beyeri Von Koenigsvald (dwarf), Rhinoceros philippinensis, Cerpis sp. and Bovid sp.

<text>Dalarö is a locality situated in Haninge Municipality, Stockholm County, Sweden with 1,199 inhabitants in 2010.

It is situated south-east of Stockholm and is part of Metropolitan Stockholm and serves as a recreational summer spot for Stockholmers. At the beginning of the year 2004, the automobile company Volvo used the town for the unconventional &quot;The Mystery of Dalarö&quot; advertising campaign.

Dalarö is Haninge Municipality&#x27;s oldest locality, originally an old maritime pilot and customs community. Today Dalarö is largely characterized by the developments which were added in the late 1800s, when the area became a popular summer resort for Stockholmers. Dalarö has long been home to Swedish high society&#x27;s seaside houses. Since the 19th century, the town of Dalarö has been a holiday resort for the international guests. The historical valuable buildings are of national interest. Dalarö and the surrounding built-up area has a diverse year-round and summer cottages. During the summer months Dalarö is frequented by many tourists.

<text>Animal Aid is a British animal rights organisation, founded in 1977 by Jean Pink. The group campaigns peacefully against the consumption of animals as food and against animal cruelty such as their use for medical research—and promotes a cruelty-free lifestyle. It also investigates and exposes animal abuse.

Animal Aid conducts undercover investigations, produces campaign reports, leaflets and fact files, as well as educational videos and other resources. They also offer a quarterly magazine and a sales catalogue with vegan and cruelty-free products.

==Aims and objectives==
Animal Aid was founded in January 1977 to work, by all peaceful means, for an end to animal cruelty. The organization is a not-for-profit limited company run by a volunteer council of management. It has not applied to be a charity so that it is able to use its funds for sometimes controversial campaigns. Its aims are:
* To increase public awareness of the abuse of animals in our society, particularly in vivisection laboratories and factory farms and to educate public opinion to demand, by all lawful means, the abolition of all experiments on animals, factory farming and all other forms of animal abuse.
* To examine existing legislation on matters associated with the above objectives or related aspects and to promote social, legal and administrative reforms in furtherance of the above objectives.
* To prevent exploitation of animals.
* To educate the public and particularly young people with a sense of moral responsibility towards animals.
* To promote, generally, a lifestyle which does not involve the abuse of animals.
* To collect, and diffuse among members and the public generally, information on all matters affecting the above objectives and with a view there to print, issue and circulate papers, periodicals, books, circulars and other literary matter and produce film and audio-visual material, and to promote, sponsor, procure or assist in any way, courses or lectures or other instructions in furtherance of such objectives.

==Celebrity supporters==
Animal Aid&#x27;s current patrons are Peter Egan, Sara Pascoe, Carol Royle, Peter Tatchell and Wendy Turner Webster. It has other celebrity supporters, including Chris Packham, Deborah Meaden, Thom Yorke, Stella McCartney, Richard Wilson, Massive Attack, Alexei Sayle, Benjamin Zephaniah, Martin Shaw, Chrissie Hynde, Alan Davies and the Reverend Professor Andrew Linzey. Patrons and supporters now deceased have included Watership Down author Richard Adams, Tony Benn and comedian Spike Milligan. 

Dr Charlotte Uhlenbroek, the primatologist, has supported the Animal Aid campaign against primate experiments, stating: &quot;I have yet to hear a sufficiently compelling scientific argument that justifies the suffering inflicted on primates in medical research.&quot;

BBC TV Springwatch&#x27;s Michaela Strachan presented Animal Aid&#x27;s Animal Kind series of short curriculum-based educational films.

==Campaigns==
Animal Aid campaigns include:
* Wildlife: Animal Aid campaigns against wildlife culls, including the culling of badgers, wild boar, grey squirrels and pigeons. It has opposed shooting and the use of traps, snares and poisons in the name of conservation, and &quot;calls for tolerance, for compassion and a willingness to concede space to the natural world&quot;. It has produced information and advice sheets on humanely deterring unwanted wildlife, including the use of non-lethal methods. In 2021 Animal Aid launched a campaign to ban the manufacture, sale, possession and use of snares in the UK. The campaign presents footage of snares causing extreme suffering to animals, the failure of the &#x27;Code of Best Practice&#x27;, and the fact that in 2016 a majority of MPs voted for an outright ban. In March 2022 Animal Aid&#x27;s UK Parliament petition to ban snares reached over 100,000 signatures, triggering a parliamentary debate. 
* Animal farming: Animal Aid campaigns against factory farming. It exposes animal suffering in UK intensive farming systems as well as in &#x27;high welfare&#x27; rearing systems, such as RSPCA Assured or free-range. It conducts undercover investigations with footage documenting animal suffering, overcrowding and poor conditions on UK farms. This has included farms winning Farmer of the Year awards, free-range and RSPCA Assured farms. Investigations have exposed the suffering of meat chickens, egg-laying hens, turkeys, pigs, cows and goats. Animal Aid highlights and objects to planning proposals for new intensive farms. In 2021 this included rabbit meat and fur farms. It also campaigns against the suffering of fish and environmental damage caused by the fishing industry.
* Slaughter: Animal Aid uses hidden cameras to film in UK slaughterhouses. It has filmed inside sixteen British slaughterhouses, finding evidence of lawbreaking in most of them. Its films have revealed widespread and serious problems, including many cases of deliberate cruelty. It also found breaches of welfare laws at slaughterhouses used by &#x27;high welfare&#x27; accredited standards, including organic and RSPCA Assured. Even where no laws were broken, it has found animals suffering pain and fear. Following Animal Aid&#x27;s CCTV campaign, all the major supermarket chains agreed to insist that their suppliers fit CCTV cameras in their slaughterhouses. Animal Aid campaigns for mandatory independently monitored CCTV in all UK slaughterhouses. Although this has now happened in England and Scotland, it continues to campaign for mandatory CCTV in Wales and Northern Ireland.
* Animal experiments: Animal Aid campaigns against animal experimentation on both moral and scientific grounds. It highlights the scale of animal experimentation in the UK: that around 4 million animals are experimented on in British laboratories each year, and that around every 8 seconds one animal dies. It also publicises that, as well as rats and mice, a wide range of animals are experimented on, including cats, dogs, guinea pigs, rabbits and monkeys. It champions the increasing potential of humane, non-animal research, including test tube (in vitro) and computer (in silico) based methods, and points to documented failures of the animal model, questioning its viability. Victims of Charity: This campaign aims to persuade medical research charities to stop funding animal experiments and to use methods such as epidemiological studies; in vitro research using human cell and tissue cultures; clinical studies; human autopsy examinations; computerised patient-drug databases and post-marketing surveillance; mathematical models and computer simulations and non-invasive imaging techniques. Since the launch of the campaign, two major charities have committed to stop funding animal research. Animal Aid publishes a list of UK health charities indicating their animal research status - whether or not each charity funds or conducts animal research. Animal Aid campaigns to stop warfare experiments on animals. In the UK these are conducted by the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) at Porton Down. These experiments, conducted on thousands of animals each year, include the use of nerve agents, chemical or biological weapons and the simulation of blast injury. Examples include shooting rodents in the eyes, applying nerve agents to guinea pigs and infecting monkeys with Ebola. In 2020 Animal Aid coordinated an open letter to the UK Government, signed by a number of animal advocacy organisations, public figures, parliamentarians and over 8000 individuals, calling for a ban on the use of animals in warfare experiments. It also campaigned for MPs to support an Early Day Motion calling for a ban, which 100 MPs signed.
* Horse racing: This aims for an end to commercial horse racing, and as a first step, a ban on the use of the whip except for safety purposes. Whip regulations have been somewhat tightened up since the launch of the campaign. Animal Aid&#x27;s undercover investigation into horse slaughter revealed video evidence of practices and conditions in UK abattoirs providing horsemeat for human consumption abroad. This included former race industry horses. The investigation was featured in a 2021 BBC Panorama programme, The Dark Side of Horse Racing. Later that year the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) announced that it would not permit the sale of race horses to abattoirs to be slaughtered for meat. Race Horse Death Watch is Animal Aid&#x27;s online database that records thoroughbred deaths on British racecourses. In March 2022 Animal Aid launched the Irish Horse Death Watch website which lists all horses killed due to racing on racecourses in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
* Game bird shooting: Animal Aid campaigns for an end to the production and shooting of animals for pleasure. Some 50 million pheasants and partridges are intensively farmed every year so that they can be released and shot for sport. In 2010, the outgoing Labour government was about to ban the metal battery cages in which thousands of egg-producing pheasants and partridges are confined to their productive lives. But this was overturned by the incoming Coalition government. Animal Aid continues its campaign for the cages to be outlawed.
* Veganism: Animal Aid promotes a cruelty-free diet, provides free cookery demonstrations in schools, and sends out free information packs and other literature. A central feature of the campaign is the Great Vegan Challenge, which is staged every November.
* Living without cruelty: Animal Aid promotes a cruelty-free lifestyle, encouraging people to help end animal suffering through ordinary, everyday decisions which choose compassion over cruelty. It focuses on clothing, cosmetics, toiletries and household products, such as cleaning materials and duvets. Animal Aid discourages participation in sport and leisure activities which kill animals or cause animal suffering. It exposes animal suffering in the pet trade, and recommends adopting companion animals from rescue centres, sanctuaries or shelters rather than buying them from pet shops or breeders. It also encourages people not to buy exotic pets.

== Christmas Fayre ==

Animal Aid&#x27;s Christmas Festival is held every year, early in December, in London, England, to promote a cruelty-free lifestyle.

There are goods for sale including fair trade crafts and jewellery, cruelty-free cosmetics, recycled goods, environmentally friendly clothing, non-leather boots and shoes and seasonal cards and gifts. There is a lecture programme throughout the day, plus a wide variety of vegan food. It is promoted as a family event.

There is also an annual South West Christmas Without Cruelty Fayre held in Exeter, England.

<text>Steve Augeri (born January 30, 1959) is an American rock singer best known for his work as the lead singer of Journey from 1998 to 2006. He has also provided lead vocals for Tall Stories, Tyketto, and the Steve Augeri Band. He is a member of the supergroup Bad Penny.
==Early life and education==
Steve Augeri, the son of Joseph and Emma Augeri, was born on January 30, 1959, and raised in the Bensonhurst neighborhood of Brooklyn.

Initially studying woodwinds at New York City&#x27;s High School of Music and Art, Augeri switched to bassoon and soon discovered his love for classical music.

==Career==
Augeri has taught at French Woods Festival for the Performing Arts Summer Camp. He also sang with Michael Ward of The Innocent Criminals.

Augeri, along with guitarist Jack Morer, bass player Kevin Totoian, and drummer Tom De Faria, formed the band Tall Stories in 1988 in New York City. Tall Stories was nominated for “Best Debut Album”, and Augeri for “Best Debut Male Vocalist”, at the 1992 New York Music Awards. Tall Stories disbanded in 1995. 

Augeri provided lead vocals on Tyketto&#x27;s 1995 album, &quot;Shine&quot;, and its 1996 album, &quot;Take Out &amp; Served Up Live&quot;.
Augeri was working as a maintenance manager at the GAP when he received a phone call from Jonathan Cain and Neal Schon of Journey offering him an audition. Augeri joined Journey as lead vocalist in 1998. He has stated that replacing Steve Perry as the band&#x27;s lead singer was &quot;incredibly daunting&quot;. The song &quot;Remember Me&quot;, from the soundtrack album from the movie &quot;Armageddon&quot;, represents Augeri&#x27;s recording debut with the band. Augeri recorded three albums with Journey: &quot;Arrival&quot; (2001), the EP &quot;Red 13&quot; (2002), and &quot;Generations&quot; (2005). The live DVD of Journey&#x27;s Las Vegas concert recorded in December 2000, entitled &quot;Journey 2001&quot;, acquired platinum status. Augeri left the band in 2006 due to vocal problems.

Augeri and his wife Lydia have supported various charities with personal appearances and live performances, including Journey to the Cure (Breast Cancer Foundation), Little Baby Face Foundation, Diamond Angels (Joe DiMaggio Children&#x27;s Hospital), and March of Dimes.

Augeri has stated that he formed the Steve Augeri Band in 2012. He has toured with the band and has recorded as a solo artist.

Augeri and others formed the supergroup Bad Penny in 2020.

==Personal life==
Augeri is married to Lydia Augeri and has a son, Adam Augeri. As of 2020, Augeri resided in Staten Island, New York.

<text>Stephen Donald Black (born July 28, 1953) is an American white supremacist. He is the founder and webmaster of the neo-Nazi, Holocaust denial, and homophobic website Stormfront. He was a Grand Wizard in the Ku Klux Klan and a member of the American Nazi Party in the 1970s, though at the time he was a member it was known as the &quot;National Socialist White Peoples&#x27; Party&quot;. He was convicted in 1981 of attempting an armed overthrow of the government in the island of Dominica in violation of the U.S. Neutrality Act.

== Early life ==
Black was born in Athens, Alabama, and became a white supremacy advocate at an early age when he began handing out swastika-adorned pamphlets from the National Socialist White People&#x27;s Party at his high school, Athens High School, before transferring to Madison Academy in the fall of 1970 in order to avoid attending school with black students. This led to a decision by the local school board to ban the distribution of political literature. Black countered by mailing literature to student addresses obtained from school handbooks.

In the summer of 1970, after his junior year at Athens High School, Black traveled to Savannah, Georgia, to work on the gubernatorial campaign of J. B. Stoner, a segregationist and leader of the National States&#x27; Rights Party (NSRP). It was in this election that Jimmy Carter won the Georgia governorship. Black was asked to obtain a copy of the NSRP membership list by Robert Lloyd, a leader of the National Socialist White People&#x27;s Party, formerly known as the American Nazi Party. At the time, Black was a member of the Party&#x27;s youth branch, the National Socialist Youth Movement.

Also working on the Stoner campaign was Jerry Ray, brother of James Earl Ray, who committed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. On July 25, 1970, Jerry Ray shot Black (who was 16 at the time) in the chest with a .38-caliber hollow-point bullet to stop him from taking files from Stoner&#x27;s campaign office. Ray was acquitted of all charges, saying he shot in self-defense after Black reached for what appeared to be a weapon.

Black finished his senior year at Madison Academy, a private school in Huntsville. Then after high school, Black graduated from the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa in 1975. In the early 1970s, Black traveled on a road trip to an American Nazi Party conference in Virginia with fellow white supremacists David Duke and Joseph Paul Franklin (the latter of who was later convicted of multiple acts of racial and antisemitic terrorism and executed for serial murder).

== The Ku Klux Klan and Operation Red Dog ==

Black joined the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in 1975, one year after David Duke took over the organization. He moved to Birmingham to become the group&#x27;s state organizer. After the resignation of Duke in 1980, Black became Grand Wizard, or national director, of the Klan. In 1979, he ran for mayor of Birmingham, receiving 2.5% of the vote. Richard Arrington Jr. won the mayoral election, becoming Birmingham&#x27;s first African American mayor.

On April 27, 1981, Black and nine other would-be mercenaries – many recruited from Klan affiliated organizations – were arrested in New Orleans as they prepared to board a boat stocked with weapons and ammunition to invade the island nation Dominica in what they would call Operation Red Dog. Local media labeled the botched attempt the &quot;Bayou of Pigs&quot;, a play on words for the unsuccessful 1961 &quot;Bay of Pigs Invasion&quot; of Cuba.

Black later explained the invasion as an attempt to set up an anti-communist regime, saying, &quot;What we were doing was in the best interests of the United States and its security in the hemisphere, and we feel betrayed by our own government.&quot; The invasion was intended to restore former prime minister Patrick John to the mostly black Caribbean island. Prosecutors said the real purpose for the invasion would have been to set up tourism, gambling, offshore banking, and timber logging operations on the impoverished island.

In 1981, Black was sentenced to three years in prison for his role in the attempted invasion and his violation of the Neutrality Act. Black, Federal Bureau of Prisons #16692-034 was initially incarcerated at Federal Correctional Institution, Tucson. In 1983, he was transferred to Federal Correctional Institution, Big Spring. He was released on November 15, 1984. During his time in prison, Black took computer programming classes which led him to establish Stormfront on the Internet years later.

He ran for office in Alabama, this time as a Populist Party U.S. Senate candidate.

== Stormfront ==

In 1995, Black founded Stormfront, which was the Internet&#x27;s first significant website espousing racial hate. It remains among the most popular online resources for those drawn to racist ideologies. The site has featured the writings of William Luther Pierce and David Duke as well as works by the Holocaust denying Institute for Historical Review and the &quot;Culture of Critique&quot; series. At first, along with these articles, Stormfront housed a library of white pride, neo-Nazi, and white power skinhead graphics for downloading, and a number of links to other white nationalist websites.

In a 1998 interview for the alternative weekly newspaper &quot;Miami New Times&quot;, Black said: &quot;We want to take America back. We know a multicultural Yugoslav nation can&#x27;t hold up for too long. Whites won&#x27;t have any choice but to take military action. It&#x27;s our children whose interests we have to defend.&quot;

In 1999, Black created the website &quot;martinlutherking.org&quot;, which is administered by Stormfront. This website was created to malign the character of Dr King. In January 2018, the site remained online and surpassed sites containing reliable content in Google search results.

In December 2007, Black gained attention for donating money to Ron Paul&#x27;s 2008 presidential run.

In 2008, Black said that the establishment of white pride as a special interest group within the Republican Party is crucial. Asked by an interviewer for Italian newspaper &quot;la Repubblica&quot; if Stormfront was not just the new Ku Klux Klan, Black responded affirmatively, though he noted that he would never say so to an American journalist.

On May 5, 2009, it was announced that Black was one of 22 on a British Home Office list of individuals banned from entering the United Kingdom for &quot;promoting serious criminal activity and fostering hatred that might lead to inter-community violence&quot;.

The Stormfront forum acts as one of the largest online gatherings of racism and Holocaust deniers in the world, with threads on this theme gaining hundreds of thousands of views. A number of radio shows published by Black&#x27;s web site have featured Holocaust denial.

==Family==
In 2008, various media outlets reported that Black&#x27;s wife, Chloe, worked as an executive assistant for sugar baron José Fanjul who runs the Florida Crystals company and owns a real estate business in Latin American countries. In particular, her job duties included acting as the spokesperson for a charter school &quot;to lift underprivileged black and Hispanic children out of poverty.&quot; The story resulted in Black being criticized by some other white nationalists.

In August 2008, Black&#x27;s 19-year-old child Adrianne Black was elected to one of 111 seats on the Palm Beach County, Florida Republican committee, with 167 of 287 votes. The committee however, refused to seat Black, citing a loyalty oath she failed to sign before registering her candidacy. The oath states candidates must refrain from activities &quot;likely to injure the name of the Republican Party.&quot; She hosted the &quot;Derek Black Show&quot; weekdays on a local West Palm Beach, Florida AM radio station, WPBR, to which Don Black paid $600 a week to broadcast content on. The radio show ended in January 2013, with Adrianne Black appearing on few episodes over the last year.

By summer 2013, Adrianne Black had called into question her racist ideologies, and she began to renounce white supremacism and issued an apology to those harmed by her previous actions and beliefs. Her renunciation reportedly shocked her father and like-minded people. By 2016, Adrianne Black had fully renounced her white nationalist views and was actively speaking out against such views in the press. &quot;Washington Post&quot; staff writer Eli Saslow detailed the ideological transformation of Adrianne which began with the rejection of her family, moving to Michigan and assuming a new name and eventually becoming a Ph.D. student at the University of Chicago, studying Medieval Islam.

<text>Enköping is a locality and the seat of Enköping Municipality, Uppsala County, Sweden with 30,000 inhabitants in 2018.

== Geography ==
Enköping is situated near Lake Mälaren, about 78 km west of Stockholm.
A comparably large number of Swedish cities are located in the vicinity of Enköping. The municipal slogan is therefore &quot;Sweden&#x27;s Closest City&quot;. This expression was created in 1965 when it was discovered by a local business that within a radius of 120 kilometers, one finds 38 Swedish cities and a third of Sweden&#x27;s population.

== History ==

Near Enköping, there is some of the best preserved rock art from the Bronze Age present in central Sweden. The city of Enköping itself dates its history back to the 13th century but the city itself did not emerge until about 1250. Enköping was then as now situated by the rich farmlands close to lake Mälaren, leading to a wealthy rural population. The city has also always been a major crossroads for commerce, and excellent communications signify the city even today: The Mälar Railline (&quot;Mälarbanan&quot;) and the E18 highway provide ample means of travelling to the nearby major cities of Stockholm and Västerås. The city has several manufacturing industries, a hospital and the Swedish Armed Forces command and control an army electronic warfare centre Ledningsregementet (&quot;LedR&quot;).

==Notable people==

<text>Östhammar is a locality and the seat of Östhammar Municipality, Uppsala County, Sweden with 4,534 inhabitants in 2010. Today Östhammar Municipality is a part of Uppsala County, but the area has historically been a part of Stockholm County.

==History==
Östhammar&#x27;s city status was granted by king Albert in 1368. During this period a castle called Östhammarshus was built, but already in 1434 the castle was burnt down by its Danish vogt, who fled to Denmark over the sea when faced with the Engelbrekt rebellion. By the late 15th century the post-glacial rebound had made it hard to reach Östhammar by boat and its city status was transferred to Öregrund. Östhammar regained its city status in 1538, and moved closer to the sea.

In 1651 Östhammar got a town hall, and in 1795 Östhammar was heavily damaged by fire. Between the early 17th century and the middle of the 19th century the fishing of herring played a very important role in Östhammar&#x27;s economy.

<doc id="1021673" wikidata="Q655870" url="?curid=1021673" title="Environmentally friendly">
<text>Environment friendly processes, or environmental-friendly processes (also referred to as eco-friendly, nature-friendly, and green), are sustainability and marketing terms referring to goods and services, laws, guidelines and policies that claim reduced, minimal, or no harm upon ecosystems or the environment.

Companies use these ambiguous terms to promote goods and services, sometimes with additional, more specific certifications, such as ecolabels. Their overuse can be referred to as greenwashing. To ensure the successful meeting of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) companies are advised to employ environmental friendly processes in their production. Specifically, Sustainable Development Goal 12 measures 11 targets and 13 indicators &quot;to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns&quot;.

The International Organization for Standardization has developed ISO 14020 and ISO 14024 to establish principles and procedures for environmental labels and declarations that certifiers and eco-labellers should follow. In particular, these standards relate to the avoidance of financial conflicts of interest, the use of sound scientific methods and accepted test procedures, and openness and transparency in the setting of standards.

== Regional variants ==

=== Europe ===
Products located in members of the European Union can use the EU Ecolabel pending the EU&#x27;s approval. EMAS is another EU label that signifies whether an organization management is green as opposed to the product. Germany also uses the Blue Angel, based on Germany&#x27;s standard.

In Europe, there are many different ways that companies are using environmentally friendly processes, eco-friendly labels, and overall changing guidelines to ensure that there is less harm being done to the environment and ecosystems while their products are being made. In Europe, for example, many companies are already using EMAS labels to show that their products are friendly.

==== Companies ====

Many companies in Europe make putting eco-labels on their products a top-priority since it can result to an increase in sales when there are eco-labels on these products. In Europe specifically, a study was conducted that shows a connection between eco-labels and the purchasing of fish: &quot;Our results show a significant connection between the desire for eco-labeling and seafood features, especially the freshness of the fish, the geographical origin of the fish and the wild &quot;vs&quot; farmed origin of the fish&quot;. This article shows that eco-labels are not only reflecting a positive impact on the environment when it comes to creating and preserving products, but also increase sales. However, not all European countries agree on whether certain products, especially fish, should have eco-labels. In the same article, it is remarked: &quot;Surprisingly, the country effect on the probability of accepting a fish eco-label is tricky to interpret. The countries with the highest level of eco-labeling acceptability are Belgium and France&quot;. According to the same analysis and statistics, France and Belgium are most likely of accepting these eco-labels.

=== North America ===
In the United States, environmental marketing claims require caution. Ambiguous titles such as &quot;environmentally friendly&quot; can be confusing without a specific definition; some regulators are providing guidance. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has deemed some ecolabels misleading in determining whether a product is truly &quot;green&quot;.

In Canada, one label is that of the Environmental Choice Program. Created in 1988, only products approved by the program are allowed to display the label.

Overall, Mexico was one of the first countries in the world to pass a specific law on climate change. The law set an obligatory target of reducing national greenhouse-gas emissions by 30% by 2020. The country also has a National Climate Change Strategy, which is intended to guide policymaking over the next 40 years.

=== Oceania ===
The Energy Rating Label is a Type III label that provides information on &quot;energy service per unit of energy consumption&quot;. It was first created in 1986, but negotiations led to a redesign in 2000.

Oceania generates the second most e-waste, 16.1 kg, while having the third lowest recycling rate of 8.8%. Out of Oceania, only Australia has a policy in policy to manage e-waste, that being the Policy Stewardship Act published in 2011 that aimed to manage the impact of products, mainly those in reference to the disposal of products and their waste. Under the Act the National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme (NTCRS) was created, which forced manufactures and importers of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) importing 5000 or more products or 15000 or more peripherals be liable and required to pay the NTCRS for retrieving and recycling materials from electronic products.

New Zealand does not have any law that directly manages their e-waste, instead they have voluntary product stewardship schemes such as supplier trade back and trade-in schemes and voluntary recycling drop-off points. Though this has helped it costs the provider money with labor taking up 90% of the cost of recycling. In addition, e-waste is currently not considered a priority product, which would encourage the enforcement of product stewardship. In Pacific Island Regions (PIR), e-waste management is a hard task since they lack the adequate amount of land to properly dispose of it even though they produce one of the lowest amounts of e-waste in the world due to their income and population. Due to this there are large stockpiles of waste unable to be recycled safely.

Currently, The Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP), an organization in charge of managing the natural resources and environment of the Pacific region, is in charge of region coordination and managing the e-waste of the Oceania region. SPREP uses Cleaner Pacific 2025 as a framework to guide the various governments in the region. They also work with PacWaste (Pacific Hazardous Waste) to identify and resolve the different issues with waste management of the islands, which largely stem from the lack of government enforcement and knowledge on the matter. They have currently proposed a mandatory product stewardship policy be put in place along with an advance recycling fee which would incentivize local and industrial recycling. They are also in the mindset that the islands should collaborate and share resources and experience to assist in the endeavor.

With the help from the NTCRS, though the situation has improved they have been vocal about the responsibilities of stakeholders in the situation and how they need to be more clearly defined. In addition to there being a differences in state and federal regulations, with only Southern Australia, Australian Capital Territory, and Victoria having banned e-waste landfill, it would be possible to make this apply the rest of the region if a federal decision was made. They have also advocated for reasonable access to collection points for waste, with there being only one collection point within a 100 km radius in some cases. It has been shown that the reason some residents do not recycle is because of their distance from a collection point. In addition, there have been few campaigns to recycle, with the company, Mobile Muster, a voluntary collection program managed by the Australian Mobile Telecommunication Association, aimed to collect phones before they went to a landfill and has been doing so since 1999. Upon further study, it was found that only 46% of the public was award of the program, which later increased to 74% in 2018, but this was after an investment of $45 million from the Australian Mobile Telecommunication Association.

=== Asia ===
&quot;Economic growth in Asia has increased in the past three decades and has heightened energy demand, resulting in rising greenhouse gas emissions and severe air pollution. To tackle these issues, fuel switching and the deployment of renewables are essential.&quot; However, as countries continue to advance, it leads to more pollution as a result of increased energy consumption. In recent years, the biggest concern for Asia is its air pollution issues. Major Chinese cities such as Beijing have received the worst air quality rankings (Li &quot;et al&quot;., 2017). Seoul, the capital of South Korea, also suffers from air pollution (Kim &quot;et al&quot;., 2017). Currently, Indian cities such as Mumbai and Delhi are overtaking Chinese cities in the ranking of worst air quality. In 2019, 21 of the world&#x27;s 30 cities with the worst air quality were in India.&quot;

The environmentally friendly trends are marketed with a different color association, using the color blue for clean air and clean water, as opposed to green in western cultures. Japanese- and Korean-built hybrid vehicles use the color blue instead of green all throughout the vehicle, and use the word &quot;blue&quot; indiscriminately.

==== China ====

According to Shen, Li, Wang, and Liao, the emission trading system that China had used for its environmentally friendly journey was implemented in certain districts and was successful in comparison to those which were used in test districts that were approved by the government. This shows how China tried to effectively introduce new innovative systems to impact the environment. China implemented multiple ways to combat environmental problems even if they didn&#x27;t succeed at first. It led to them implementing a more successful process which benefited the environment. Although China needs to implement policies like, &quot;The “fee-to-tax” process should be accelerated, however, and the design and implementation of the environmental tax system should be improved. This would form a positive incentive mechanism in which a low level of pollution correlates with a low level of tax.&quot; By implementing policies like these companies have a higher incentive to not over pollute the environment and instead focus on creating an eco-friendlier environment for their workplaces. In doing so, it will lead to less pollution being emitted while there also being a cleaner environment. Companies would prefer to have lower taxes to lessen the costs they have to deal with, so it encourages them to avoid polluting the environment as much as possible.

=== International ===
Energy Star is a program with a primary goal of increasing energy efficiency and indirectly decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. Energy Star has different sections for different nations or areas, including the United States, the European Union and Australia. The program, which was founded in the United States, also exists in Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and Taiwan. Additionally, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 17 has a target to promote the development, transfer, dissemination, and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies to developing countries as part of the 2030 Agenda.

<text>Osei Tutu II (born Nana Barima Kwaku Duah; 6 May 1950) is the 16th Asantehene, enstooled on 26 April 1999. By name, Otumfuo Osei Tutu II is in direct succession to the 17th-century founder of the Ashanti Empire, Otumfuo Osei Tutu I. He is also the Chancellor of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. A Freemason, Otumfuo Osei Tutu II has served as the Grand Patron of the Grand Lodge of Ghana, the Sword Bearer of the United Grand Lodge of England and the Grand Patron of the Grand Lodge of Liberia.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===

He was born on 6 May 1950 and named Nana Barima Kwaku Duah, the third son and youngest of five children (three sons and two daughters) of Nana Afia Kobi Serwaa Ampem II, Asantehemaa (Queen-mother of the Ashanti). His father Nana Kwame Boakye-Dankwa was from Kentinkyere in Ashanti and was also the Brehyia Duke of Asante. Nana Kwame Boakye-Dankwa died on 1 January 2002, in Kumasi, Ashanti.

Otumfuo Osei Tutu was named after his paternal grandfather, Ohenenana Kwaku Duah (Nana Agari), Brahyiahene, of Kentinkyere in the Atwima district.

His siblings include Nana Ama Konadu, (Nana Konadu Yiadom III) who is the 14th Asanteheemaa, as well as the late Barima Kwabena Poku, Barima Akwasi Prempeh.

When he was about five years old, Otumfuo moved into the royal household of his uncle, Oheneba Mensah Bonsu, the Hiahene, enstooled in 1952, as early preparation for his future role.

Osei Tutu has six children. His father had other offspring from other marriages, including Yaw Boateng, Kwaku Duah, Kwabena Agyei-Bohyen, Afua Sarpong and Ama Agyemang (Kumasi, Ashanti), Fredua Agyeman Prempeh, Nana Kwasi Agyemang Prempeh and Nana Kwasi Boachie Gyambibi (Kumasi, Ashanti).

=== Education ===

=== Commitment to environmental protection and conservation ===

In July 2019, Otumfuo Osei Tutu II announced his devotion to protect the water bodies of the Asante Kingdom. This would involve the planting of 2.5 million trees around Lake Bosomtwe and would cover 400 hectares. This would aid in improving the ecosystem, cushion climate change and enhance environmental awareness among the communities around the lake. The tree planting initiative is a collaboration between the Oheneba Poku Foundation and Manhyia Palace as well as the Forestry Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Water Resources Commission, the Ghana Tourism Authority, UNESCO, the District Assemblies of Bosome-Freho and Bosumtwe, and the Lake Bosomtwe Community Resources Management Areas (CREMA), which is an NGO are the other stakeholders.

=== Otumfuo Lottery Game ===

This is a fundraising initiative to support the Otumfuo Charity Foundation. In May 2019, a working committee that composed of members of the National Lottery Authority (NLA), the State Enterprise Commission (SEC) and the Asante state&#x27;s governance team, presented a report to the monarch for approval. The National Association of Private Lotto Operators and Agents in Ghana expressed their preparedness to embrace the game so its objective would be achieved.

=== British Museum keynote address ===
On 19 July 2024, Osei Tutu delivered a keynote address at the British Museum in London on the theme &quot;Asante Culture and Heritage&quot; to mark his silver jubilee as Asantehene.

== Otumfuo Osei Tutu II Foundation (OOTIIF) ==

The Otumfuo Osei Tutu II Charity Foundation was officially launched in April 2009. It was established to enable the monarch serve his people in two of his main focus areas: education and health. In line with this, the &quot;Otumfuo Educational Fund&quot; was established in 1999 for the enhancement of education for Ghanaians and the Serwah Ampem AIDS Foundation for children who had HIV/AIDS or were affected by it. The Educational fund had by April 2019, supported 301,980 students with scholarships and other forms of support. This number is made up of 25,756  students who received full scholarships and 276,224 others who received one form of financial support or the other. By October 2019, more than 600 teachers had been recognized in the foundation&#x27;s teacher awards programme. This was to show appreciation to teachers who were working in poverty stricken areas and had no access to electricity, telephones, potable water and other basic amenities. Many teachers refuse to be posted to these areas due to the impoverished conditions of living. The awards are in the forms of money, laptops, refrigerators and scholarships up to PhD level studies.

In October 2017, Global Communities partnered with the Foundation to start up the Youth Inclusive Entrepreneurial Development Initiative for Employment (YIEDIE) project. The initiative was for five years and aimed at creating opportunities in the construction industry, to benefit economically disadvantaged youth. Global Communities, a non-profit organization with a global reach, works with communities to create sustainable changes that improve the lives and livelihoods of the less privileged. The implementation of this project was in conjunction with the Mastercard Foundation. The project operates in Ghana&#x27;s five largest cities: Accra, Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi, Ashaiman, and Tema and will provide opportunities for at least 23,700 youth, between ages 17–24, who earn less than $2 per day.

In November 2017, 4,946 children from eight districts in the Ashanti, Ahafo, Bono and Bono East Regions (Sekyere North, Bekwai Municipality, Atwima Mponua, Bibaini-Anwhiaso-Bekwai, Bosomtwe, Offinso Municipality, New Edubaise and Goaso district) were given free computer training. This was done by a collaboration between Otumfuo-Agroecom Mobile Library Project (OAMLP), which is a subsidiary of the Otumfuo Charity Foundation, and Agroecom Ghana Ltd, a cocoa buying company. This initiative is in line with its aim to bridge the gap in learning conditions between the urban and less privileged communities and instill reading and the use of ICT in pupils at the basic level.

In January 2019, an agreement was entered into by the Foundation and Young Educators Foundation who are the organizers of the &quot;Spelling Bee&quot; competition. This was geared towards making the literary programmes of the Young Educators Foundation available to less privileged communities and public schools in the Ashanti Region. This would give 100 students the opportunity to benefit from the programme every year.

In May 2020, junior high school students in Kumasi received more than 2000 books and dictionaries. Among the communities that benefited from this gesture were Bohyen, Aduato, Adumanu, Ampabame and South Suntreso. This was aimed at keeping students academically active while schools were closed to control the spread of COVID-19.

In June 2020, the Foundation donated books to about 750 Junior High School students from 11 basic schools in the Ahafo Region of Ghana. This was to facilitate the excellent performance of the students, especially in the Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE).

In July 2020, AngloGold Ashanti teamed up with the Otumfuo Osei Tutu II Charity Foundation and the Obuasi Municipal and East Educational Directorates to roll out a Live Radio and Distance Learning Programme in Obuasi. This was to ensure continuation in learning, even though schools had been closed down to control COVID-19. The Foundation was supported by the mine with an amount of 150,000 Ghana Cedis (GH₵) for the purchase and distribution of 10,000 copies of Readers and Workbooks to Junior High School Students in the catchment area.

In March 2021, the name of the foundation was changed to Otumfuo Osei Tutu II Foundation(OOTIIF). This come about as a result of the Otumfuo Education Fund, the Serwaa Ampem Foundation for Children and the Otumfuo Osei Tutu II Charity Foundation being merged into one charity with a new board of trustees and management. The new board was constituted of Oheneba Boachie-Adjei Woahene II as the chair and Sam E. Jonah, Kwaku Mensa-Bonsu, Margaret Boateng Sekyere, Kwame Bawuah-Edusei, Akua Ofori-Boateng, Andrew Asamoah, Nana Akuoku Boateng, and Mariam Agyeman Gyasi Jawhary.

<doc id="1021687" wikidata="Q2345927" url="?curid=1021687" title="Revolt of 1173–1174">
<text>The Revolt of 1173–1174 was a rebellion against King Henry II of England by three of his sons, his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine, and their rebel supporters. The revolt ended in failure after eighteen months; Henry&#x27;s rebellious family members had to resign themselves to his continuing rule and were reconciled to him.

==Background==
King Henry II had been ruling England, Normandy, and Anjou since 1154, while his wife Queen Eleanor ruled the vast territory of Aquitaine since 1137. In 1173 Henry had four legitimate sons (from oldest to youngest): Henry, called the &quot;Young King&quot;, Richard (later called &quot;the Lionheart&quot;), Geoffrey, and John (&quot;Lackland&quot;), all of whom stood to inherit some or all of these possessions. Henry also had an illegitimate son, Geoffrey, born probably before the eldest of the legitimate children.

By this time, Henry the Young King was 18 years old and praised for his good looks and charm. He had been long-married to the daughter of Louis VII of France, the former husband of Eleanor (Henry the Young King&#x27;s mother). Henry the Young King kept a large and glamorous retinue but was constrained by his lack of resources: &quot;he had many knights but he had no means to give rewards and gifts to the knights&quot;. The young Henry was therefore anxious to take control of some of his ancestral inheritances to rule in his own right.

The immediate practical cause of the rebellion was Henry II&#x27;s decision to bequeath three castles, which were within the realm of the Young King&#x27;s inheritance, to his youngest son, John, as part of the arrangements for John&#x27;s marriage to the daughter of the Count of Maurienne. At this, Henry the Young King was encouraged to rebel by many aristocrats who saw potential profit and gain in a power transition. His mother Eleanor had been feuding with her husband. She joined the cause as did many others upset by Henry&#x27;s possible involvement in the murder of Archbishop Thomas Becket in 1170, which had left Henry alienated throughout Christendom.

In March 1173 Henry the Young King withdrew to the court of his father-in-law, Louis, in France and was soon followed by his brothers Richard and Geoffrey. Eleanor tried to join them but was stopped by Henry II on the way and held in captivity. The Young King and his French mentor created a wide alliance against Henry II by promising land and revenues in England and Anjou to the Counts of Flanders, Boulogne, and Blois; William the Lion, King of the Scots, would have Northumberland. In effect, the Young King would seize his inheritance by breaking it apart.

==Revolt==
Hostilities began in April when the Counts of Flanders and Boulogne invaded Normandy from the east, the King of France and young Henry from the south, while the Bretons attacked from the west. Each of the assaults ended with failure: the Count of Boulogne was killed, Louis was defeated and kicked out of Normandy, and the Bretons were routed with great loss of life and treasure. William the Lion&#x27;s attacks in the north of England were also a failure. Negotiations were opened with the rebels in Normandy between father Henry II and son young Henry, to no avail.

The Earl of Leicester, a supporter of young Henry who had been in Normandy and was chief of the aristocratic rebels, took up the charge next. He raised an army of Flemish mercenaries and crossed from Normandy back to England to join the other rebel barons there, principally Hugh Bigod, Earl of Norfolk. The Earl of Leicester was intercepted by the English forces returning from the north in Scotland, led by Richard de Luci, and was completely defeated at Fornham. Henry II&#x27;s barons supposedly said to him, &quot;It is a bad year for your enemies.&quot;

In the spring of 1174 the rebellion continued. David, Earl of Huntingdon, brother of William the Lion, moved back south to attempt the conquest of northern England and took up the leadership of the rebel barons. William de Ferrers, Earl of Derby and one of the rebels, burned the royal burgh of Nottingham while Hugh Bigod likewise torched Norwich.

Henry II, who had been in Normandy fighting his enemies, landed in England on 8 July. His first act was to do penance for the death of Thomas Becket, who was murdered by some of Henry&#x27;s knights three years earlier and had already been canonized as a saint. The day following the ceremony at Canterbury, on 13 July, in a seeming act of divine providence for Henry II, William the Lion and many of his supporters were surprised and captured at the Battle of Alnwick by a small band of loyalists. In the aftermath Henry II was able to sweep up the opposition, marching through each rebel stronghold to receive their surrenders. With England taken care of, Henry returned to Normandy and set about a settlement with his enemies, and on 30 September &quot;King Henry, the king&#x27;s son, and his brothers, returned to their father and to his service, as their lord&quot;.

==Aftermath==

The revolt lasted eighteen months, and played out across a large area from southern Scotland to Brittany. At least twenty castles in England were recorded as having been demolished on the orders of the king. Many towns were destroyed and many people were killed. Blame was placed on young Henry&#x27;s advisors, the rebel barons, who manipulated the inexperienced and rash princes for their own dreams of gain. William Marshal, who was loyal to young Henry during the revolt, said &quot;cursed be the day when the traitors schemed to embroil the father and the son&quot;.

<doc id="1021688" wikidata="Q6114512" url="?curid=1021688" title="Jack Pardee">
<text>John Perry Pardee (April 19, 1936 – April 1, 2013) was an American professional football player and head coach. He played as a linebacker in the National Football League (NFL). As a coach, he is the only head coach to helm a team in college football, the NFL, the United States Football League (USFL), the World Football League (WFL), and the Canadian Football League (CFL). Pardee was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1986.

==Playing career==

As a teenager, Pardee moved to Christoval, Texas, where he excelled as a member of the six-man football team. He was an All-America fullback at Texas A&amp;M University and a two-time All-Pro with the Los Angeles Rams (1963) and the Washington Redskins (1971). He was one of the few six-man players to ever make it to the NFL, and his knowledge of that wide-open game served him well as a coach.

Pardee was one of the famed Junction Boys, the 1954 Texas A&amp;M preseason camp held in Junction, Texas, by football coach Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant. He was part of the 35 left from the roughly 100 players who went to Junction. After completing college at Texas A&amp;M, Pardee was selected with the first pick of the second round (14th overall) in the 1957 NFL draft by the Los Angeles Rams as a linebacker. Pardee played for the Rams from 1957 to 1970, sitting out the 1965 season to treat a malignant melanoma in his left arm. Pardee was alerted to his own cancer after reading about Houston Astros pitcher Jim Umbricht, who died from an aggressive form of skin cancer.

Pardee was traded from the Rams to the Redskins in a multiplayer deal during the first round of the 1971 NFL draft on January 28, 1971.
He ended his playing career after two seasons with the Redskins at the end of the 1972 NFL season.

==Coaching career==

===WFL===
When the World Football League started in 1974, Pardee got his first head-coaching job with the Washington Ambassadors. The team later relocated to Norfolk, Virginia, as the Virginia Ambassadors, before finally moving to their third and final home in Orlando as the Florida Blazers. The Blazers made it to the 1974 World Bowl and lost by one point to the Birmingham Americans. Pardee&#x27;s regular-season coaching record in 1974 with the Blazers was 14–6, and 2–1 in the 1974 WFL Playoffs and World Bowl. This was all the more remarkable considering that the Blazers went unpaid for the last three months of the season. Some of the Blazers players relocated to San Antonio as the Wings for the 1975 season, and Pardee also moved on, signing on as head coach of the Chicago Bears for the 1975 season.

===First stint as a head coach in the NFL===
In 1975, Pardee was hired by the Chicago Bears as head coach. He spent the next three years there, leading Chicago to their first playoff berth in 14 years in 1977, before moving on to the Washington Redskins. In 1979, he led the Redskins to within one game of making the playoffs, but in the season&#x27;s final week, they squandered a 13-point lead to the eventual NFC East champion Dallas Cowboys and missed the playoffs. He was fired after going 6–10 in 1980. In 1981, he was hired as assistant head coach in charge of defense for the San Diego Chargers.

===USFL===
In 1984, Pardee returned to his native Texas by becoming the head coach of the Houston Gamblers. The Gamblers played spring football in the United States Football League. The Gamblers had one of the most potent offenses in professional football, the run and shoot offense, with Jim Kelly as quarterback. The Gamblers merged with the New Jersey Generals in 1986, and Pardee was named head coach. With Kelly and Doug Flutie both vying for the role of starting quarterback, and Herschel Walker in the backfield, the Generals were poised to dominate the USFL, but the league folded prior to the 1986 season.

===NCAA===
Pardee returned to Houston in 1987 as head coach at the University of Houston. During his three-year stint, the Cougars, using the same offense he coached in the USFL, produced the first-ever African American quarterback to win the Heisman Trophy, Andre Ware. His team also became the first major college team in NCAA history to have over 1,000 total offensive yards in a single game, racking up 1,021 yards while beating SMU, 95–21.

Not long after Pardee&#x27;s arrival, however, Houston was slapped with crippling NCAA sanctions due to numerous major violations under his predecessor, Bill Yeoman. Among them, the Cougars were banned from bowl games in 1989 and 1990 and kicked off live television in 1989. As a result, most of the nation never got a chance to see the Cougars set numerous offensive records during the 1989 season.

===Second stint as a head coach in the NFL===
In 1990, Pardee packed up the run-and-shoot offense and moved across town, and back to the NFL, by joining the Houston Oilers. He spent five years coaching a team that made the playoffs each of his first four years there, led by Hall of Fame quarterback Warren Moon. In 1991, the Oilers won their first division title since 1967 in the American Football League. During his time with the Oilers, Pardee fell victim to NFL notoriety during the 1992 season, when in that season&#x27;s playoffs, the Oilers surrendered a 35-3 third-quarter lead to the Buffalo Bills, losing in overtime to the eventual conference champions 41–38.

The Oilers won another division title in 1993 on the strength of winning their last 11 games despite their season being wracked with turmoil on and off the field. However, after losing in the second round of the playoffs, owner Bud Adams made good on a threat to hold a fire sale if they did not make the Super Bowl. The highest-profile loss was Moon, who was traded to the Minnesota Vikings. Without Moon, the Oilers were a rudderless team. Pardee was fired following a 1–9 start to the 1994 season, and was replaced by defensive coordinator Jeff Fisher.

===CFL comes to America===
He continued his coaching career in the Canadian Football League. In 1995, he was named head coach of the CFL expansion team, the Birmingham Barracudas. Canadian football is more wide open than American football, with a field that has an additional 10 yards added to each endzone, as well as a 55 yardline and wider field. Birmingham owner Art Williams thought Pardee&#x27;s roots in the six-man game made him a natural fit. The &#x27;Cudas were part of a failed experiment to expand the CFL into the United States. With Matt Dunigan at quarterback, Birmingham made the playoffs, but lost in the first round. However, due to dreadful attendance late in the season and the league&#x27;s refusal to approve the team&#x27;s proposed relocation to Shreveport, Louisiana, for 1996, the &#x27;Cudas were shuttered at the end of the season along with the CFL&#x27;s other American teams.

===Return to coaching===
In December 2007, Pardee, then 71, was contacted by athletic director Dave Maggard about the vacant head coaching job at the University of Houston. Signaling interest, he made it as far as a finalist for the position, but the school moved forward with Oklahoma co-offensive coordinator Kevin Sumlin.

==Personal life==
Pardee was married for 50 years to Phyllis Lane Perryman and had five children and 12 grandchildren. Pardee&#x27;s youngest son, Ted, is the color commentator for the Houston Cougars football radio broadcasts.

In November 2012, Pardee was diagnosed with gallbladder cancer and his family reported that he only had six to nine more months to live, The cancer spread to other organs and Pardee moved to a Denver hospice.

Pardee died April 1, 2013. The family has established a memorial scholarship fund in Pardee&#x27;s name at the University of Houston. He was survived by his wife Phyllis, five children, and 12 grandchildren. His grandson Payton Pardee then was tight ends coach at Texas A &amp; M University-Commerce after playing wide receiver at the University of Houston. Jack&#x27;s youngest grandson, Luke Pardee, was then a quarterback at Texas Christian University,

<doc id="1021695" wikidata="Q706020" url="?curid=1021695" title="Charles Chiniquy">
<text>Charles Paschal Telesphore Chiniquy (30 July 1809 – 16 January 1899) was a Canadian socio-political activist and former Catholic priest who left the Catholic Church and converted to Protestant Christianity, becoming a Presbyterian Evangelical minister. He rode the lecture circuit in the United States denouncing the Catholic Church. His themes were that Catholicism was Pagan, that Catholics worshipped the Virgin Mary, and that its theology was anti-Christian.

Chiniquy founded the St. Anne Colony, a village located in Kankakee County, Illinois in 1851. &quot;Fifty Years in the Church of Rome&quot;, an extensive autobiographical account of his life and thoughts as a priest in the Catholic Church, was written by Chiniquy and published in 1886. He warned of plots by the Vatican to take control of the United States by importing Catholic immigrants from Ireland, Germany, and France, and suggested that the Vatican was behind the assassination of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln.

==Biography==
Chiniquy was born in 1809 to a French-Canadian family in the village of Kamouraska, Quebec. He lost his father at an early age and was adopted by his uncle. As a young man, Chiniquy studied to become a Catholic priest at the Petit Seminaire (Little Seminary) in Nicolet, Quebec. He was ordained in 1833; after his ordination, he served his church in Quebec. During the 1840s, he led a campaign throughout Quebec against the consumption of alcohol and drunkenness.

Later he immigrated to Illinois in the United States. In 1855, Chiniquy was sued by a prominent Catholic layman named Peter Spink in Kankakee, Illinois. After the fall court term, Spink applied for a change of venue to the court in Urbana, Illinois. Chiniquy hired the then-lawyer Abraham Lincoln, the future 16th President of the United States, to defend him. The spring court action in Urbana was the highest profile libel suit in Lincoln&#x27;s career. The case was ended in the fall court session by agreement.

Chiniquy clashed with the Bishop of Chicago, Anthony O&#x27;Regan, over the bishop&#x27;s treatment of Catholics in the city, particularly French Canadians. He asserted that O&#x27;Regan was secretly backing Spink&#x27;s suit against him. Chiniquy said that in 1856, O&#x27;Regan had threatened him with excommunication if he did not go to a new location where the bishop wanted to assign him. As Chiniquy refused to head that reassignment, O&#x27;Regan suspended and several months later excommunicated him in a pastoral letter, also published by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Chiniquy disputed this decision, publicly calling the bishop mistaken. Chiniquy left the Catholic Church in 1858, and subsequently converted to Protestant Christianity, becoming a Presbyterian Evangelical minister in 1860.

He asserted that Catholicism was Pagan, that Catholics worshipped the Virgin Mary, and that its theology was anti-Christian. He warned of supposed plots by the Vatican to take control of the United States by importing Catholic immigrants from Ireland, Germany, and France. This was at a time of high immigration rates from those countries, in response to social and political upheaval (the Great Famine in Ireland and revolutions in Germany and France). Chiniquy claimed that he was falsely accused by his superiors (and that Abraham Lincoln had come to his rescue), that the American Civil War was a plot against the United States of America by the Vatican, and that the Vatican was behind the Confederate cause, and the assassination of U.S. President Lincoln, and that Lincoln&#x27;s assassins were faithful Catholics ultimately serving Pope Pius IX.

After leaving the Catholic Church, Chiniquy dedicated his life to preach and evangelize among his fellow French Canadians, as well as other people in Canada and the United States, in order to convert them from Catholicism to Protestant Christianity. He wrote a number of books and tracts expressing his criticism and views on the alleged errors in the faith and practices of the Catholic Church. His two most influential literary works are the autobiography &quot;Fifty Years in The Church of Rome&quot; and the polemical treatise &quot;The Priest, The Woman, and The Confessional&quot;. These books raised concerns in the United States about the influence of the Catholic Church. According to one Canadian biographer, Chiniquy is Canada&#x27;s best-selling author of all time. He joined the Orange Order and said of it: &quot;I always found them staunch and true. I consider it a great honour to be an Orangeman. Every time I go on my knees I pray that God may bless them and make them as numerous and bright as the stars of the heaven above.&quot; When Chiniquy visited Hobart in 1879, a riot occurred when hundreds of Catholic opponents forced their way into the lecture hall. The meeting was abandoned and more than five hundred law enforcement personnel were employed for the next meeting, with thousands of protestors outside the building. 

In 1864, Chiniquy married Euphémie Allard. The couple had three children together. Chiniquy died in Montreal, Quebec, Canada on January 16, 1899.

== Legacy ==
To this day, some of Chiniquy&#x27;s works are still promoted among Protestant Christians and &quot;Sola scriptura&quot; believers. One of his most well-known modern day followers was the American Fundamentalist cartoonist and comic book writer Jack Chick, notable for being the creator of the &quot;Chick tracts&quot;; he also published a comic-form adaptation of Chiniquy&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Fifty Years in The Church of Rome&quot;, titled &quot;The Big Betrayal&quot;. Chick strongly relied on Chiniquy&#x27;s claims and books for writing his own anti-Catholic tracts.

==St. Anne Colony==
Chiniquy, then a Catholic priest, left Canada in the wake of a series of scandals. He was offered a fresh start by James Oliver Van de Velde, Bishop of Chicago, after Ignace Bourget, Bishop of Montreal, asked him to leave in 1851. Chiniquy founded and settled in St. Anne Colony, a village located in Kankakee County, Illinois in 1851. Chiniquy was suspended on 19 August 1856, for public insubordination by Bishop Anthony O&#x27;Regan, Van de Velde&#x27;s successor in Chicago. Because he continued to celebrate Mass and administer the other sacraments, he was excommunicated on 3 September 1856. About two years later, on 3 August 1858, O&#x27;Regan&#x27;s successor, Bishop James Duggan, formally and publicly reconfirmed Chiniquy&#x27;s excommunication in St. Anne.

Chiniquy had definitively left the Catholic Church in 1858, and subsequently converted to Protestant Christianity in 1860. Along with many followers, he joined the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (PCUSA). He was admitted as a Presbyterian minister on 1 February 1860. Within two years, Chiniquy, in trouble with the Presbytery of Chicago over his administration of charity funds and a college, according to Elizabeth Ann Kerr McDougall in the &quot;Dictionary of Canadian Biography&quot;, sought a new connection in order to avoid an expensive presbytery trial. The college is identified in the &quot;Seventh Biennial Report of the Superintendent of Public Instruction of the State of Illinois&quot; as Saviour&#x27;s College, founded in 1860; it is listed neither in &quot;Universities and Colleges&quot; nor &quot;Academies and Seminaries of various grades and courses,&quot; but in the &quot;Theological Seminaries and Church Schools&quot; class of institutions. The report states it &quot;is designed to supply the educational wants of the colony brought by Father Chiniquy from Canada to this State, and to prepare men who will be fitted to preach the gospel in the regions whence he came.&quot; The report also quotes a description of the school, attributed to correspondence from a Montreal newspaper, unnamed in the report, that people, also unnamed in the report, &quot;examined the day school or college, as the people there delight to call it&quot; and wrote that it had five classes, ranging from students learning the alphabet to students learning the &quot;intricacies of French and English grammar, composition, and the other studies of the school, besides the elements of Algebra, Latin, and Greek.&quot;

Alexander F. Kemp was chairman of the Synod of the Canada Presbyterian Church committee that examined Chiniquy&#x27;s application for admission as a minister. According to Kemp, Chiniquy was involved in both presbytery and civil court proceedings connected with the administration of charitable funds and with what Kemp described as an educational institute. The Presbytery of Chicago charged him with un-ministerial and un-Christian conduct; Chiniquy was expected to answer these charges before the presbytery. At that stage of the proceedings, he and his congregation resolved to separate from the Presbytery of Chicago and the Old School (PCUSA), and to request recognition from the Canada Presbyterian Church. The Presbytery of Chicago charged Chiniquy with misrepresenting that a real college was in operation in St. Anne. After conducting an inquiry, Kemp suggested that Chiniquy and his congregation be admitted into the Canada Presbyterian Church.

In St. Anne, a religious society was incorporated in the state that was named the &quot;Christian Catholic Church at St. Anne&quot;. It was classified as a Protestant religious association. Two years later, when it joined the PCUSA in 1860, it took the name of &quot;First Presbyterian Church of St. Anne&quot;.

<text>Bernold of Constance (c. 1054–Schaffhausen, September 16, 1100) was a chronicler and writer of tracts, and a defender of the Church reforms of Pope Gregory VII.

==Life==

He was educated at Constance under the renowned teacher Bernard of Constance. He attended the Lenten Synod of Rome, in 1079, at which Berengarius of Tours retracted his errors. Remaining in Italy till 1084, he likely attended the Council of Piacenza, on the proceedings of which he is the main authority. From his writings comes the well known statement that ambassadors of the Byzantine Emperor Alexius I appeared at Piacenza to drum support for the military campaigns against the Seljuq Turks. This possibly led to the First Crusade, the matter however remains unclear.

Once more at Constance, he attended the ordination of bishop Gebhard and was ordained priest himself by the papal legate. In 1086 he went with Bishop Gebhard as counsellors to Herman, contender for the Imperial crown, at the Battle of Pleichfeld. About the same time, he entered first the Benedictine Abbey of St Blasien in the Black Forest and then, in 1091, the Abbey of All Saints nearby in Schaffhausen, where he died.

==Works==

He wrote seventeen surviving tracts which are mostly apologetics for the pope&#x27;s policy, defences of papal supremacy or vindications of men who advocated or enforced it in Germany. Chief among these are: &quot;De prohibendâ sacerdotum incontinentiâ&quot; (against married clergy); &quot;De damnatione schismaticorum&quot; and &quot;Apologeticus super excommunicationem Gregorii VII&quot; (justifying excommunication of schismatics and of Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor and his partisans).

Of broader interest is Bernold&#x27;s chronicle, &quot;Chronicon,&quot; the latter part of which is a terse record of contemporary events by a knowing and intelligent observer in the extreme Papal camp. The chronicle covers the years AD 1054-1000, with the earlier years being composed of brief summaries until the AD 1070’s, the remaining yearly annals are much longer and expansive. The chronicle mostly focuses on Papal court politics and the rivalry with the German clergy/nobility. Important current events like warfare, famines and deaths of public figures are also briefly recounted.

Bernold was the author of &quot;Micrologus de ecclesiasticis observationibus&quot; (c. 1085), a lengthy commentary on the papal liturgy that became an important medieval liturgical treatise. Thanks to him, the German church was provided with a fairly common sacramentary throughout the Empire. The form of the mass given in &quot;Micrologus&quot; was established for Hungary, too, about 1100, by order of the local bishops.

<doc id="1021698" wikidata="Q1459937" url="?curid=1021698" title="Incarceration in the United States">
<text>Incarceration in the United States is one of the primary means of punishment for crime in the United States. In 2021, over five million people were under supervision by the criminal justice system, with nearly two million people incarcerated in state or federal prisons and local jails. The United States has the largest known prison population in the world. It has 5% of the world’s population while having 20% of the world’s incarcerated persons. China, with more than four times more inhabitants, has fewer persons in prison. Prison populations grew dramatically beginning in the 1970s, but began a decline around 2009, dropping 25% by year-end 2021.

Drug offenses account for the incarceration of about 1 in 5 people in U.S. prisons. Violent offenses account for over 3 in 5 people (62%) in state prisons. Property offenses account for the incarceration of about 1 in 7 people (14%) in state prisons.

The United States maintains a higher incarceration rate than most developed countries. According to the World Prison Brief on May 7, 2023, the United States has the sixth highest incarceration rate in the world, at 531 people per 100,000. Expenses related to prison, parole, and probation operations have an annual estimated cost of around $81 billion. Court costs, bail bond fees, and prison phone fees amounted to another $38 billion in costs annually.

Since reaching its peak level of imprisonment in 2009, the U.S. has averaged a rate of decarceration of 2.3% per year. This figure includes the anomalous 14.1% drop in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. There is significant variation among state prison population declines. Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York have reduced their prison populations by over 50% since reaching their peak levels. Twenty-five states have reduced their prison populations by 25% since reaching their peaks. The federal prison population downsized 27% relative to its peak in 2011.

Although debtor&#x27;s prisons no longer exist in the United States, residents of some U.S. states can still be incarcerated for unpaid court fines and assessments . The Vera Institute of Justice reported in 2015 that the majority of those incarcerated in local and county jails are there for minor violations and have been jailed for longer periods of time over the past 30 years because they are unable to pay court-imposed costs.

== History ==


In the 18th century, English philanthropists began to focus on the reform of convicted criminals in prison, whom they believed needed a chance to become morally pure to stop or slow crime. Since at least 1740, some of these philosophers have thought of solitary confinement as a way to create and maintain spiritually clean people in prisons. As English people immigrated to North America, so did these theories of penology.

Spanish colonizers in Florida also brought their own ideas of confinement, and Spanish soldiers in St. Augustine, Florida, built the first substantial prison in North America in 1570.

Some of the first structures built in English-settled America were jails, and by the 18th century, every English-speaking North American county had a jail. These jails served a variety of functions, such as a holding place for debtors, prisoners-of-war, and political prisoners, those bound in the penal transportation and slavery systems; and those accused but not tried for crimes. Sentences for those convicted of crimes were rarely longer than three months and often lasted only a day. Poor citizens were often imprisoned for longer than their richer neighbors, as bail was rarely refused.

One of the first prisons in America was founded in 1790 by the Pennsylvanian Quakers, to make a system they viewed as less cruel than dungeon prisons. They created a space where imprisoned people could read scriptures and repent as a means of self-improvement. This was known among prison reformers as the Pennsylvania System, which focused on reform, rehabilitation of the prisoner, and saving prisoners&#x27; souls through religious instruction. Another system was subsequently developed by warden Elam Lynds at New York&#x27;s Auburn State Prison, which focused on leasing prison labor for commercial purposes and profit, with brutal treatment of prisoners who received no compensation for their labor. This approach became known as the Auburn System, and was utilized in a significant number of states as well as parts of Canada.

In 1841, Dorothea Dix claimed that prison conditions in the U.S. were, in her opinion, inhumane. Imprisoned people were chained naked and whipped with rods. Others, who were criminally insane, were caged, or placed in cellars or closets. She insisted on changes throughout the rest of her life. While focusing on the insane, her comments also resulted in changes for other inmates. Late in the 1800s, Superintendent Zebulon Brockway also changed the landscape of prison life by introducing institutionalized learning programs to inmates for rehabilitation purposes at the Elmira Reformatory in New York. As Monroe County Penitentiary Superintendent, Brockway implemented a points-based behavior system that identified low risk offenders and allowed them to participate in education programs which was later included industrial/trade schools, moral education, and academia (Gehring, 1982).

Following the Civil War and during the Progressive Era of America, new concepts of the prison system, such as parole, indeterminate sentencing, and probation, were introduced. These concepts were encoded into legislative statutes in efforts to maintain the systems of racial capitalism that were formerly supported by unpaid slave labor. These legal frameworks became mainstream practices resulting in mass incarceration and legal discrimination of African Americans and other marginalized groups in America. At this time, there was an increase in crime, causing officials to handle crime in a more retributive way. Many Sicilian Americans were harshly affected by this. However, as the crime rate declined, the prison system started to focus more on rehabilitation.

On June 18, 1971, President Richard Nixon declared drug abuse &quot;public enemy number one&quot; in a message to Congress. His message also called for federal resources to be used for the &quot;prevention of new addicts and the rehabilitation of those who are addicted.&quot; Following this, the media began using the term &quot;War on Drugs&quot;. According to author Emily Dufton, Nixon &quot;transformed the public image of the drug user into one of a dangerous and anarchic threat to American civilization.&quot;

The presidency of Ronald Reagan saw the expansion of federal efforts to prevent drug abuse and prosecute offenders. Reagan signed the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, which established mandatory minimum sentences and expanded penalties for marijuana possession. He also signed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986. Support for Reagan&#x27;s crime legislation was bipartisan. The 1980s saw a dramatic rise in the prison population, especially among non-violent offenders and people convicted of drug offenses.

Researcher Valerie Jenness writes, &quot;Since the 1970s, the final wave of expansion of the prison system, there has been a huge expansion of prisons that exist at the federal and state level. Now, prisons are starting to become a private industry as more and more prisons are starting to become privatized rather than being under government control.&quot;

==Incarcerated population==

As of 2023, 59% of incarcerated people are in state prisons; 12% are in federal prisons; and 29% are in local jails. Of the total state and federal prison population, 8% or 96,370 people are incarcerated in private prisons. An additional 2.9 million people are on probation, and over 800,000 people are on parole. At year-end 2021, 1,000,000 people were incarcerated in state prisons; 157,000 people were incarcerated in federal prisons; and 636,000 people were incarcerated in local jails.

Approximately 1.8 million people are incarcerated in state or federal prisons or local jails. There are over 1 million people who are incarcerated in state prisons. There are 656,000 people incarcerated for violent offenses, 142,000 for property offenses, 132,000 for drug offenses, and 110,000 for public order offenses. The percentage breakdown of people in state prisons by offense-type is as follows: 63% of people are incarcerated for violent offenses, 13% for property offenses, 13% for drug offenses, and 11% for public order offenses.

The federal prison population is approximately 209,000. 148,000 of these people are incarcerated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Of these people, there are 69,000 people incarcerated for drug offenses, 61,000 for public order offenses, 11,000 for violent offenses, and 6,000 for property offenses. The percentage breakdown of people incarcerated by offense-type is as follows: 47% of people are incarcerated for drug offenses, 42% for public order offenses, 7% for violent offenses, and 4% for property offenses. A further 60,000 people are incarcerated by the U.S. Marshals Service. Of these people, there are 21,000 incarcerated for drug offenses, 14,000 for immigration offenses, 9,000 for weapons offenses, and 7,000 for violent offenses.

Finally, 619,000 people are incarcerated in local jails. Jail incarceration accounts for a third of all incarceration. Over 80% of people incarcerated in local jails have not yet been convicted.

== Demographics ==

=== Race and ethnicity ===

Racial and ethnic disparities are a significant feature of the American prison system. These disparities accumulate across the criminal legal system. The National Academies of Sciences explains:

&quot;Blacks are more likely than whites to be confined awaiting trial (which increases the probability that an incarcerative sentence will be imposed), to receive incarcerative rather than community sentences, and to receive longer sentences. Racial differences found at each stage are typically modest, but their cumulative effect is significant.&quot;

Broader socioeconomic inequality and disparities at each stage of the criminal legal process result in the disproportionate imprisonment of people of color. In 2021, people of color constituted over two-thirds (69%) of the prison population. Nationally, one in 81 African American adults are serving time in America&#x27;s state prisons. Black Americans are imprisoned at 5 times the rate of white people, and American Indians and Hispanic people are imprisoned at 4 times and 2 times the white rate, respectively. Black and Hispanic people make up 33% of the U.S. population but 56% of the incarcerated population. 

Although significant gaps remain, there have been reductions in imprisonment disparities over the past decades. The extent of decarceration has varied by race and ethnicity, but all major racial and ethnic groups experienced decarceration since reaching their highest levels. The Black prison population has decreased the most. Since 2002, the year it reached its peak levels, the number of Black people in prison declined from 622,700 to 378,000 (a 39% decrease). Since 1998, the year the white prison population reached its peak, the number of white people in prison declined from 533,200 to 356,000 (a 25% decrease). Since 2011, the year the Hispanic prison population reached its peak, the number of Hispanic people in prison declined from 347,300 to 273,800 (a 21% decrease). Since 2010, the year the American Indian prison population reached its peak, the number of American Indians in prison declined from 23,800 to 18,700 (a 21% decrease). Finally, since 2016, the year the Asian prison population reached its peak, the number of Asian people in prison declined from 18,000 to 14,700.

=== Gender ===

In 2013, there were 102,400 adult females in local jails in the United States, and 111,300 adult females in state and federal prisons. Within the U.S., the rate of female incarceration increased fivefold in a two-decade span ending in 2001; the increase occurred because of increased prosecutions and convictions of offenses related to recreational drugs, increases in the severities of offenses, and a lack of community sanctions and treatment for women who violate laws. In the United States, authorities began housing women in correctional facilities separate from men in the 1870s. According to the ACLU, &quot;More than half of the women in prisons and jails (56%) are incarcerated for drug or property offenses, and Black women are two times as likely to be incarcerated as white women.&quot; Black women tend to receive longer sentences and harsher punishments than white women for committing the same crimes. According to Angela Davis (2003), in many situations, white women are put in mental institutions, whereas black women are sent to prison for the same crime.

However, since the early 2000s, the incarceration rates for African American and Hispanic American women have declined, while incarceration rates have increased for white women. Between 2000 and 2017, the incarceration rate for white women increased by 44%, while at the same time declining by 55% for African American women. The Sentencing Project reports that by 2021, incarceration rates had declined by 70% for African American women, while rising by 7% for white women. In 2017, the Washington Post reported that white women&#x27;s incarceration rate was growing faster than ever before, as the rate for black women declined. The incarceration rate of African American males is also falling sharply, even faster that white men&#x27;s incarceration rate, contrary to the popular opinion that black males are increasingly incarcerated.

In 2011, it was reported that 85 to 90% of women incarcerated were victims of sexual and domestic violence, which is significantly higher than the national average of 22.3% of women in the United States. Women who face sexual or domestic violence are more likely to commit crimes themselves and become incarcerated. The history of black women experiencing higher rates of abuse than white women provides one of many explanations for why African American women have faced higher rates of incarceration than white women.

In 2013, there were 628,900 adult males in local jails in the United States, and 1,463,500 adult males in state and federal prisons. In a study of sentencing in the United States in 1984, David B. Mustard found that males received 12 percent longer prison terms than females after &quot;controlling for the offense level, criminal history, district, and offense type,&quot; and noted that &quot;females receive even shorter sentences relative to men than whites relative to blacks.&quot; A later study by Sonja B. Starr found sentences for men to be up to 60% higher when controlling for more variables. Several explanations for this disparity have been offered, including that women have more to lose from incarceration, and that men are the targets of discrimination in sentencing.

=== Youth ===

Through the juvenile courts and the adult criminal justice system, the United States incarcerates more of its youth than any other country in the world, a reflection of the larger trends in incarceration practices in the United States. This has been a source of controversy for a number of reasons, including the overcrowding and violence in youth detention facilities, the prosecution of youths as adults and the long term consequences of incarceration on the individual&#x27;s chances for success in adulthood. In 2014, the United Nations Human Rights Committee criticized the United States for about ten judicial abuses, including the mistreatment of juvenile inmates. A UN report published in 2015 criticized the U.S. for being the only nation in the world to sentence juveniles to life imprisonment without parole.

According to federal data from 2011, around 40% of the nation&#x27;s juvenile inmates are housed in private facilities.

The incarceration of youths has been linked to the effects of family and neighborhood influences. One study found that the &quot;behaviors of family members and neighborhood peers appear to substantially affect the behavior and outcomes of disadvantaged youths&quot;.

Nearly 53,000 youth were incarcerated in 2015. 4,656 of those were held in adult facilities, while the rest were in juvenile facilities. Of those in juvenile facilities, 69% are 16 or older, while over 500 are 12 or younger. As arrest and crime rates are not equal across demographic groups, neither is prison population. The Prison Policy Initiative broke down those numbers, finding that, relative to their share of the U.S. population, &quot;black and American Indian youth are over represented in juvenile facilities while white youth are under represented.&quot;, Black youth comprise 14% of the national youth population, but &quot;43% of boys and 34% of girls in juvenile facilities are Black. And even excluding youth held in Indian country facilities, American Indians make up 3% of girls and 1.5% of boys in juvenile facilities, despite comprising less than 1% of all youth nationally.&quot;.

=== Students ===
The term &quot;school-to-prison pipeline&quot;, also known as the &quot;schoolhouse-to-jailhouse track&quot;, is a concept that was named in the 1980s. The school-to-prison pipeline is the idea that a school&#x27;s harsh punishments—which typically push students out of the classroom—lead to the criminalization of students&#x27; misbehaviors and result in increasing a student&#x27;s probability of entering the prison system. Although the school-to-prison pipeline is aggravated by a combination of ingredients, zero-tolerance policies are viewed as main contributors. Additionally, the &quot;School to Prison Pipeline disproportionately impacts the poor, students with disabilities, and youth of color, especially African Americans, who are suspended and expelled at the highest rates, despite comparable rates of infraction.&quot;

In 1994, the Gun-Free Schools Act was passed. It required that students have at least a year long suspension from school if they brought a weapon to school. Many states then adopted the Zero-tolerance policy which lead to an increase in suspensions, mainly for Black and Hispanic kids.

At the same time these policies were growing, school districts adopted their own version of the &quot;broken windows theory&quot;. The broken windows theory emphasizes the importance of cracking down on small offenses in order to make residents feel safer and discourage more serious crime. For schools, this meant more suspensions for small offenses like talking back to teachers, skipping class, or being disobedient or disruptive. This led to schools having police officers in schools, which in turn led to students being arrested and handled more harshly.

Zero-tolerance policies are regulations that mandate specific consequences in response to outlined student misbehavior, typically without any consideration for the unique circumstances surrounding a given incident. Zero-tolerance policies both implicitly and explicitly usher the student into the prison track. Implicitly, when a student is extracted from the classroom, the more likely that student is to drop out of school as a result of being in class less. As a dropout, that child is then ill-prepared to obtain a job and become a fruitful citizen. Explicitly, schools sometimes do not funnel their pupils to the prison systems inadvertently; rather, they send them directly. Once in juvenile court, even sympathetic judges are not likely to evaluate whether the school&#x27;s punishment was warranted or fair. For these reasons, it is argued that zero-tolerance policies lead to an exponential increase in the juvenile prison populations.

The national suspension rate doubled from 3.7% to 7.4% from 1973 to 2010. The claim that Zero Tolerance Policies affect students of color at a disproportionate rate is supported in the Code of Maryland Regulations study, that found black students were suspended at more than double the rate of white students. This data is further backed by Moriah Balingit, who states that when compared to white students, black students are suspended and expelled at greater rates according to the Civil Rights Data Collection, that has records with specific information for the 2015–2016 school year of about 96,000 schools. In addition, further data shows that although black students only accounted for 15% of the student population, they represented a 31% of the arrests. Hispanic children share this in common with their black counterparts, as they too are more susceptible to harsher discipline like suspension and expulsion. This trend can be seen throughout numerous studies of this type of material and particularly in the south. Furthermore, between 1985 and 1989, there was an increase in referrals of minority youth to juvenile court, petitioned cases, adjudicated delinquency cases, and delinquency cases placed outside the home. During this time period, the number of African American youth detained increased by 9% and the number of Hispanic youths detained increased by 4%, yet the proportion of White youth declined by 13%. Documentation of this phenomenon can be seen as early as 1975 with the book &quot;School Suspensions: Are they helping children?&quot; Additionally, as punitive action leads to dropout rates, so does imprisonment. Data shows in the year 2000, one in three black male students ages 20–40 who did not complete high school were incarcerated. Moreover, about 70% of those in state prison have not finished high school. Lastly, if one is a black male living post-Civil Rights Movement with no high school diploma, there is a 60% chance that they will be incarcerated in their lifetime.

=== Elderly ===
The percentage of prisoners in federal and state prisons aged 55 and older increased by 33% from 2000 to 2005 while the prison population grew by 8%. The Southern Legislative Conference found that in 16 southern states, the elderly prisoner population increased on average by 145% between 1997 and 2007. The growth in the elderly population brought along higher health care costs, most notably seen in the 10% average increase in state prison budgets from 2005 to 2006.

The SLC expects the percentage of elderly prisoners relative to the overall prison population to continue to rise. Ronald Aday, a professor of aging studies at Middle Tennessee State University and author of &quot;Aging Prisoners: Crisis in American Corrections&quot;, concurs. One out of six prisoners in California is serving a life sentence. Aday predicts that by 2020 16% percent of those serving life sentences will be elderly.

State governments pay all of their inmates&#x27; housing costs which significantly increase as prisoners age. Inmates are unable to apply for Medicare and Medicaid. Most Departments of Correction report spending more than 10 percent of the annual budget on elderly care.

The American Civil Liberties Union published a report in 2012 which asserts that the elderly prison population has climbed 1300% since the 1980s, with 125,000 inmates aged 55 or older now incarcerated.

=== LGBT people ===

LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender) youth are disproportionately more likely than the general population to come into contact with the criminal justice system. According to the National Center for Transgender Equality, 16 percent of transgender adults have been in prison and/or jail, compared to 2.7 percent of all adults. It has also been found that 13–15 percent of youth in detention identify as LGBT, whereas an estimated 4–8 percent of the general youth population identify as such.

According to Yarbrough (2021), higher rates of poverty, homelessness, and profiling of transgender people by law enforcement are the cause of the higher rate of imprisonment experienced by transgender and gender non-conforming people. LGBT youth not only experience these same challenges, but many also live in homes unwelcoming to their identities. This often results in LGBT youth running away and/or engaging in criminal activities, such as the drug trade, sex work, and/or theft, which places them at higher risk for arrest. Because of discriminatory practices and limited access to resources, transgender adults are also more likely to engage in criminal activities to be able to pay for housing, health care, and other basic needs.

LGBT people in jail and prison are particularly vulnerable to mistreatment by other inmates and staff. This mistreatment includes solitary confinement (which may be described as &quot;protective custody&quot;), physical and sexual violence, verbal abuse, and denial of medical care and other services. According to the National Inmate Survey, in 2011–12, 40 percent of transgender inmates reported sexual victimization compared to 4 percent of all inmates.

=== Mentally disabled ===
In the United States, the percentage of inmates with mental illness has been steadily increasing, with rates more than quadrupling from 1998 to 2006. Many have attributed this trend to the deinstitutionalization of mentally ill persons beginning in the 1960s, when mental hospitals across the country began closing their doors. However, other researchers indicate that &quot;there is no evidence for the basic criminalization premise that decreased psychiatric services explain the disproportionate risk of incarceration for individuals with mental illness&quot;.

According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, over half of all prisoners in 2005 had experienced mental illness as identified by &quot;a recent history or symptoms of a mental health problem&quot;; of this population, jail inmates experienced the highest rates of symptoms of mental illness at 60 percent, followed by 49 percent of state prisoners and 40 percent of federal prisoners. Not only do people with recent histories of mental illness end up incarcerated, but many who have no history of mental illness end up developing symptoms while in prison. In 2006, the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that a quarter of state prisoners had a history of mental illness, whereas 3 in 10 state prisoners had developed symptoms of mental illness since becoming incarcerated with no recent history of mental illness.

According to Human Rights Watch, one of the contributing factors to the disproportionate rates of mental illness in prisons and jails is the increased use of solitary confinement, for which &quot;socially and psychologically meaningful contact is reduced to the absolute minimum, to a point that is insufficient for most detainees to remain mentally well functioning&quot;. Another factor to be considered is that most inmates do not get the mental health services that they need while incarcerated. Due to limited funding, prisons are not able to provide a full range of mental health services and thus are typically limited to inconsistent administration of psychotropic medication, or no psychiatric services at all. Human Rights Watch also claims that corrections officers routinely use excessive violence against mentally ill inmates for nonthreatening behaviors related to schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. These reports found that some inmates had been shocked, shackled and pepper sprayed.

Mental illness rarely stands alone when analyzing the risk factors associated with incarceration and recidivism rates. The American Psychological Association recommends a holistic approach to reducing recidivism rates among offenders by providing &quot;cognitive–behavioral treatment focused on criminal cognition&quot; or &quot;services that target variable risk factors for high-risk offenders&quot; due to the numerous intersecting risk factors experienced by mentally ill and non-mentally ill offenders alike.

To prevent the recidivism of individuals with mental illness, a variety of programs are in place that are based on criminal justice or mental health intervention models. Programs modeled after criminal justice strategies include diversion programs, mental health courts, specialty mental health probation or parole, and jail aftercare/prison re-entry. Programs modeled after mental health interventions include forensic assertive community treatment and forensic intensive case management. It has been argued that the wide diversity of these program interventions points to a lack of clarity on which specific program components are most effective in reducing recidivism rates among individuals with mental illness. Inmates who have a mental illness tend to stay for longer days in jail compared to inmates who don&#x27;t have a mental illness. Inmates with mental illness may struggle to understand and follow prison rules. Inmates with mental illness will usually get in trouble with more facility violation rules. Suicide is the leading cause of death in many prisons. People who have a serious mental illness tend to die by suicide more often in prison.

=== Immigrants and foreign nationals ===
The United States government holds tens of thousands of immigrants in detention under the control of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). These immigrants seek asylum into the United states and are detained prior to release into the United States or deportation and removal from the country. During 2018, 396,448 people were booked into ICE custody: 242,778 of whom were detained by CBP and 153,670 by ICE&#x27;s own enforcement operations.

The BOP receives all prisoner transfer treaty inmates sent from foreign countries, even if their crimes would have been, if committed in the United States, tried in state, DC, or territorial courts. Non-US citizens incarcerated in federal and state prisons are eligible to be transferred to their home countries if they qualify.

=== Class and poverty===
The poor in the United States are incarcerated at a much higher rate than their counterparts in other developed nations. According to a 2015 study by the Vera Institute of Justice, jails in the U.S. have become &quot;massive warehouses&quot; of the impoverished since the 1980s.

A December 2017 report by Philip Alston, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, asserted that the justice system throughout the U.S. is designed to keep people mired in poverty and to generate revenue to fund the justice system and other governmental programs.

Sociologist Matthew Desmond of Princeton University writes that the &quot;overwhelming majority&quot; of prisoners and former prisoners of the U.S. prison system, which &quot;has no equal in any other country or any other epoch,&quot; are extremely poor. And they stay poor as prison jobs pay an average wage of between 14 cents and $1.41 an hour. He notes that the carceral state also &quot;disappears&quot; the incarcerated poor by erasing them from poverty statistics and national surveys, &quot;which means there are millions more poor Americans than official statistics let on.&quot;

== Features of the criminal justice system ==

=== Duration ===
Many legislatures continually have reduced discretion of judges in both the sentencing process and the determination of when the conditions of a sentence have been satisfied. Determinate sentencing, use of mandatory minimums, and guidelines-based sentencing continue to remove the human element from sentencing, such as the prerogative of the judge to consider the mitigating or extenuating circumstances of a crime to determine the appropriate length of the incarceration. As the consequence of &quot;three strikes laws&quot;, the increase in the duration of incarceration in the last decade was most pronounced in the case of life prison sentences, which increased by 83% between 1992 and 2003 while violent crimes fell in the same period.

=== Violent and nonviolent crime ===

In 2016, there were an estimated 1.2 million violent crimes committed in the United States. Over the course of that year, U.S. law enforcement agencies made approximately 10.7 million arrests, excluding arrests for traffic violations. In that year, approximately 2.3 million people were incarcerated in jail or prison.

As of September 30, 2009, in federal prisons, 7.9% of sentenced people were incarcerated for violent crimes, while at year end 2008 of sentenced people in state prisons, 52.4% had been jailed for violent crimes. In 2002 (latest available data by type of offense), 21.6% of convicted inmates in jails were in prison for violent crimes. Among unconvicted inmates in jails in 2002, 34% had a violent offense as the most serious charge. 41% percent of convicted and unconvicted jail inmates in 2002 had a current or prior violent offense; 46% were nonviolent recidivists.

From 2000 to 2008, the state prison population increased by 159,200 imprisoned people, and violent offenders accounted for 60% of this increase. The number of drug offenders in state prisons declined by 12,400 over this period. Furthermore, while the number of sentenced violent offenders in state prison increased from 2000 through 2008, the expected length of stays for these offenders declined slightly during this period.

In 2013, &quot;The Week&quot; reported that at least 3,278 Americans were serving life sentences without parole for nonviolent crimes, including &quot;cursing at a policeman and selling $10 worth of drugs. More than 80 percent of these life sentences are the result of mandatory sentencing laws.&quot;

In 2016, about 200,000, under 16%, of the 1.3 million people in state jails, were serving time for drug offenses. 700,000 were incarcerated for violent offenses.

Nonviolent crime was the main driver of the increase in the incarcerated population in the United States from 1980 to 2003. Violent crime rates had been relatively constant or declining over those decades. The prison population was increased primarily by public policy changes causing more prison sentences and lengthening time served, for example through mandatory minimum sentencing, &quot;three strikes&quot; laws, and reductions in the availability of parole or early release.

Perhaps the single greatest force behind the growth of the prison population has been the national &quot;War on Drugs&quot;. The legislation for &quot;The War on Drugs&quot; can be traced back to the United Nation&#x27;s Convention on Psychotropic Substances in 1971 causing regulation and classification of substances deemed to fit the criteria set by the World Health Organization. The criteria used by the World Health Organization that if the substance has the capacity to produce a state of dependence, and central nervous system stimulation or depression that results in hallucinations or disturbances in motor function or thinking or behavior or perception or mood. If the World Health Organization finds that the substance meets such criteria, the substance was placed under international control. After the substances were identified all governments with the necessary facilities should take similar action facilitating the campaign and creating a guideline for The War on Drugs. Following this convention, the United States enacted The Federal Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act on May 1,1971 outlining the findings of the United Nations and implementing policies that coincided with the request of the United Nations. The War on Drugs initiative expanded during the presidency of Ronald Reagan. During Reagan&#x27;s term, a bi-partisan Congress established the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, galvanized by the death of Len Bias. According to the Human Rights Watch, legislation like this led to the extreme increase in drug offense imprisonment and &quot;increasing racial disproportions among the arrestees&quot;. The number of incarcerated drug offenders has increased twelvefold since 1980. In 2000, 22 percent of those in federal and state prisons were convicted on drug charges. In 2011, 55.6% of the 1,131,210 sentenced people in state prisons were being held for violent crimes (this number excludes the 200,966 imprisoned people being held due to parole violations, of which 39.6% were re-incarcerated for a subsequent violent crime). Also in 2011, 3.7% of the state prison population consisted of imprisoned people whose highest conviction was for drug possession (again excluding those incarcerated for parole violations of which 6.0% were re-incarcerated for a subsequent act of drug possession).

=== Pre-trial detention ===
In 2020, the non-profit Prison Policy Initiative issued a report, &quot;Mass Incarceration: The Whole Pie 2020&quot;, that said, based on the most recent census data and information from the Bureau of Prisons, an overwhelming majority of inmates in county and municipal jails were being held pre-trial, without having been convicted of a crime. The Pre-Trial Justice Institute noted, &quot;Six out of 10 people in U.S. jails—nearly a half million individuals on any given day—are awaiting trial. People who have not been found guilty of the charges against them account for 95% of all jail population growth between 2000–2014.&quot;

In 2017, 482,100 inmates in federal and state prisons were held pre-trial.

Advocates for decarceration contend the large pre-trial detention population serves as a compelling reason for bail reform anchored in a presumption of innocence. &quot;We don&#x27;t want people sitting in jails only because they cannot afford their financial bail,&quot; said Representative John Tilley (D) of Kentucky, a state that has eliminated commercial bail and relies on a risk assessment to determine a defendant&#x27;s flight risk.

In March 2020, the Department of Justice issued its report, noting the county and municipal jail population, totaling 738,400 inmates, had decreased by 12% over the last decade, from an estimated 258 jail inmates per 100,000 U.S. residents in 2008 to 226 per 100,000 in 2018. For the first time since 1990, the 2018 jail incarceration rate for African Americans fell below 600 per 100,000, while the juvenile jail population dropped 56%, from 7,700 to 3,400.

In 2018, sixty-eight percent of jail inmates were behind bars on felony charges, about two-thirds of the total jail population was awaiting court action or held for other reasons.

=== Prison education ===

Prison education encompasses any type of educational program offered within a prison, including literacy programs, high school or GED equivalent programs, vocational education, and tertiary education. In the early 1800s, tutors began to enter prisons and the idea of punishment began to shift towards rehabilitation. By the early 1990s, there were over 350 prison education programs nationwide. In 1994, Bill Clinton signed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act into law, which barred incarcerated people from receiving Pell Grants. This caused the number of educational programs to quickly decline due to a lack of federal funding.

The Civil Rights Act of 1960 prompted the collection of employment data and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act required collection of data for school funding. However, the true depth of inequality in education was not known despite several significant education policies being enacted because inmates were excluded from federal surveys. Studies in the 1990s by psychologists, social justice advocates, scholars, and researchers showed that inmate exclusion grossly inflates education attainment rates as the prison population grows and the Pell Grant ban severely impacted the reintegration of formerly incarcerated people to reintegrate back into society. This resulted in the restoral of federal Pell Grant funding for Prison Education Programs (PEP) and legislation like California bill SB416 that protects incarcerated students from predatory lending.

Prison education has proven to lower recidivism rates and increase employment for graduates upon release. A 2013 study conducted by the RAND Corporation found that correctional education led to a significant reduction in recidivism rates, and those who participated in prison education programs showed &quot;43% lower odds of recidivating than inmates who did not.&quot; That same study showed that individuals who received vocational education and training saw a 28% increase in employment following incarceration, and those who participated in strictly academic educational programs saw an 8% increase in employment.

=== Recidivism ===

A 2002 study survey, showed that among nearly 275,000 prisoners released in 1994, 67.5% were rearrested within 3 years, and 51.8% were back in prison. However, the study found no evidence that spending more time in prison raises the recidivism rate, and found that those serving the longest time, 61 months or more, had a slightly lower re-arrest rate (54.2%) than every other category of prisoners. This is most likely explained by the older average age of those released with the longest sentences, and the study shows a strong negative correlation between recidivism and age upon release. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, a study was conducted that tracked 404,638 prisoners in 30 states after their release from prison in 2005. From the examination it was found that within three years after their release 67.8% of the released prisoners were rearrested; within five years, 76.6% of the released prisoners were rearrested, and of the prisoners that were rearrested 56.7% of them were rearrested by the end of their first year of release.

=== Comparison with other countries ===


With around 100 prisoners per 100,000, the United States had an average prison and jail population until 1980. Afterwards it drifted apart considerably. The United States has the highest prison and jail population (2,121,600 in adult facilities in 2016) as well as the highest incarceration rate in the world (655 per 100,000 population in 2016). According to the World Prison Population List (11th edition) there were around 10.35 million people in penal institutions worldwide in 2015. The U.S. had 2,173,800 prisoners in adult facilities in 2015. That means the U.S. held 21.0% of the world&#x27;s prisoners in 2015, even though the U.S. represented only around 4.4 percent of the world&#x27;s population in 2015.

Comparing other English-speaking developed countries, whereas the incarceration rate of the U.S. is 655 per 100,000 population of all ages, the incarceration rate of Canada is 114 per 100,000 (as of 2015), England and Wales is 146 per 100,000 (as of 2016), Australia is 160 per 100,000 (as of 2016) and Ireland is 82 per 100,000 (as of Aug 2022). Comparing other developed countries, the rate of Spain is 133 per 100,000 (as of 2016), Greece is 89 per 100,000 (as of 2016), Norway is 73 per 100,000 (as of 2016), Netherlands is 69 per 100,000 (as of 2014), and Japan is 48 per 100,000 (as of 2014).

According to a 2021 report by the Prison Policy Initiative, every state has a higher incarceration rate than &quot;virtually any independent democracy on earth.&quot; Louisiana has the highest incarceration rate at 1,094. In 2012, &quot;The Times-Picayune&quot; described the state as the prison capital of the world.

A 2008 &quot;New York Times&quot; article, said that &quot;it is the length of sentences that truly distinguishes American prison policy. Indeed, the mere number of sentences imposed here would not place the United States at the top of the incarceration lists. If lists were compiled based on annual admissions to prison per capita, several European countries would outpace the United States. But American prison stays are much longer, so the total incarceration rate is higher.&quot;

The number of incarcerated individuals in U.S. jails and prisons jumped 500% in the three decades following the implementation of tougher sentencing laws associated with the War on Drugs and the &quot;tough on crime&quot; movement. The U.S. incarceration rate peaked in 2008 when about 1 in 100 US adults was behind bars. This incarceration rate exceeded the average incarceration levels in the Soviet Union during the existence of the Gulag system, when the Soviet Union&#x27;s population reached 168 million, and 1.2 to 1.5 million people were in the Gulag prison camps and colonies (i.e. about 0.8 imprisoned per 100 USSR residents, according to numbers from Anne Applebaum and Steven Rosefielde). In &quot;The New Yorker&quot; article &quot;The Caging of America&quot; (2012), Adam Gopnik writes: &quot;Over all, there are now more people under &#x27;correctional supervision&#x27; in America—more than six million—than were in the Gulag Archipelago under Stalin at its height.&quot;

==Operational==
=== Prison systems ===

The American prison system is one of significant heterogeneity. In fact, it would be misleading to suggest that the U.S. has one &quot;criminal justice system.&quot; Instead, there are thousands of systems across federal, state, local, tribal levels. In 2023, there were a reported &quot;1,566 state prisons, 98 federal prisons, 3,116 local jails, 1,323 juvenile correctional facilities, 181 immigrant detention facilities, and 80 Indian country jails, as well as military prisons, civil commitment centers, state psychiatric hospitals, and prisons in the U.S. territories.&quot;

Despite the country&#x27;s disparate systems of confinement, the U.S. prison system may be generally identified with four main institutions: state prisons, federal prisons, local jails, and juvenile correctional facilities. State prisons are run by state departments of correction, holding sentenced people serving time for felony offenses, usually longer than a year. Federal prisons are run by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons and hold people who have been convicted of federal crimes and pretrial detainees. Local jails are county or municipal facilities that incarcerate defendants prior to trial, and also hold those serving short sentences, typically under a year. Juvenile correctional facilities are operated by local authorities or the state and serve as longer-term placements for youth who have been adjudicated as delinquent and ordered by a judge to be confined.

===Security levels===

In some, but not all, states&#x27; department of corrections, inmates reside in different facilities that vary by security level, especially in security measures, administration of inmates, type of housing, and weapons and tactics used by corrections officers. The federal government&#x27;s Bureau of Prisons uses a numbered scale from one to five to represent the security level. Level five is the most secure, while level one is the least. State prison systems operate similar systems. California, for example, classifies its facilities from Reception Center through Levels I to V (minimum to maximum security) to specialized high security units (all considered Level V) including Security Housing Unit (SHU)—California&#x27;s version of supermax—and related units. Jails operated by county and local governments are typically smaller than prisons and less able to manage security issues raised by overcrowding. Due to the variety of prisoners incarcerated in jails, from defendants awaiting trial, to people serving short sentences for minor crimes, to people with significant histories of escape attempts or violence, jails often have multiple levels of security within a single facility, as compared to prisons which often have specialized facilities for each security level.

Supermax prison facilities provide the highest level of prison security. These units hold those considered the most dangerous inmates, as well as inmates that have been deemed too high-profile or too great a national security risk for a normal prison. These include inmates who have committed assaults, murders, or other serious violations in less secure facilities, and inmates known to be or accused of being prison gang members. Most states have either a supermax section of a prison facility or an entire prison facility designated as a supermax. The United States Federal Bureau of Prisons operates a federal supermax, A.D.X. Florence, located in Florence, Colorado, also known as the &quot;Alcatraz of the Rockies&quot; and is widely considered to possibly be the most secure prison in the United States. A.D.X. Florence has a standard supermax section where assaultive, violent, and gang-related inmates are kept under normal supermax conditions of 23-hour confinement and abridged amenities. A.D.X. Florence is considered to be of a security level above that of all other prisons in the United States, at least in the &quot;ideological&quot; ultramax part of it, which features permanent, 24-hour solitary confinement with rare human contacts or opportunity to earn better conditions through good behavior.

In a maximum security prison or area (called high security in the federal system), all prisoners have individual cells with sliding doors controlled from a secure remote control station. Prisoners are allowed out of their cells one out of twenty four hours (one hour and 30 minutes for prisoners in California). When out of their cells, prisoners remain in the cell block or an exterior cage. Movement out of the cell block or &quot;pod&quot; is tightly restricted using restraints and escorts by correctional officers.
Under close security, prisoners usually have one- or two-person cells operated from a remote control station. Each cell has its own toilet and sink. Inmates may leave their cells for work assignments or correctional programs and otherwise may be allowed in a common area in the cellblock or an exercise yard. The fences are generally double fences with watchtowers housing armed guards, plus often a third, lethal-current electric fence in the middle.

Prisoners that fall into the medium security group may sleep in cells, but share them two and two, and use bunk beds with lockers to store their possessions. Depending upon the facility, each cell may have showers, toilets and sinks. Cells are locked at night with one or more correctional officers supervising. There is less supervision over the internal movements of prisoners. The perimeter is generally double fenced and regularly patrolled.

Prisoners in minimum security facilities are considered to pose little physical risk to the public and are mainly non-violent &quot;white collar criminals&quot;. Minimum security prisoners live in less-secure dormitories, which are regularly patrolled by correctional officers. As in medium security facilities, they have communal showers, toilets, and sinks. A minimum-security facility generally has a single fence that is watched, but not patrolled, by armed guards. At facilities in very remote and rural areas, there may be no fence at all. Prisoners may often work on community projects, such as roadside litter cleanup with the state department of transportation or wilderness conservation. Many minimum security facilities are small camps located in or near military bases, larger prisons (outside the security perimeter) or other government institutions to provide a convenient supply of convict labor to the institution. Many states allow persons in minimum-security facilities access to the Internet.

===Correspondence===
Inmates who maintain contact with family and friends in the outside world are less likely to be convicted of further crimes and usually have an easier reintegration period back into society. Inmates benefit from corresponding with friends and family members, especially when in-person visits are infrequent. However, guidelines exist as to what constitutes acceptable mail, and these policies are strictly enforced.

Mail sent to inmates in violation of prison policies can result in sanctions such as loss of imprisonment time reduced for good behavior. Most Department of Corrections websites provide detailed information regarding mail policies. These rules can even vary within a single prison depending on which part of the prison an inmate is housed. For example, death row and maximum security inmates are usually under stricter mail guidelines for security reasons.

There have been several notable challenges to prison corresponding services. The Missouri Department of Corrections (DOC) stated that effective June 1, 2007, inmates would be prohibited from using pen pal websites, citing concerns that inmates were using them to solicit money and defraud the public. Service providers such as WriteAPrisoner.com, together with the ACLU, planned to challenge the ban in Federal Court. Similar bans on an inmate&#x27;s rights or a website&#x27;s right to post such information has been ruled unconstitutional in other courts, citing First Amendment freedoms. Some faith-based initiatives promote the positive effects of correspondence on inmates, and some have made efforts to help ex-offenders reintegrate into society through job placement assistance. Inmates&#x27; ability to mail letters to other inmates has been limited by the courts.

===Conditions===

The non-governmental organization Human Rights Watch claims that prisoners and detainees face &quot;abusive, degrading and dangerous&quot; conditions within local, state and federal facilities, including those operated by for-profit contractors. The organization also raised concerns with prisoner rape and medical care for inmates. In a survey of 1,788 male inmates in Midwestern prisons by &quot;Prison Journal&quot;, about 21% responded they had been coerced or pressured into sexual activity during their incarceration, and 7% that they had been raped in their current facility.

In August 2003, a &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; article by Wil S. Hylton estimated that &quot;somewhere between 20 and 40% of American prisoners are, at this very moment, infected with hepatitis C&quot;. Prisons may outsource medical care to private companies such as Correctional Medical Services (now Corizon) that, according to Hylton&#x27;s research, try to minimize the amount of care given to prisoners to maximize profits. After the privatization of healthcare in Arizona&#x27;s prisons, medical spending fell by 30 million dollars and staffing was greatly reduced. Some 50 prisoners died in custody in the first 8 months of 2013, compared to 37 for the preceding two years combined.

The poor quality of food provided to inmates has become an issue, as over the last decade corrections officials looking to cut costs have been outsourcing food services to corporations such as Aramark, A&#x27;Viands Food &amp; Services Management, and ABL Management. A prison riot in Kentucky has been blamed on the low quality of food Aramark provided to inmates, which was tainted with worms and human feces. A 2017 study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that because of lapses in food safety, prison inmates are 6.4 times more likely to contract a food-related illness than the general population.

Also identified as an issue within the prison system is gang violence, because many gang members retain their gang identity and affiliations when imprisoned. Segregation of identified gang members from the general population of inmates, with different gangs being housed in separate units often results in the imprisonment of these gang members with their friends and criminal cohorts. Some feel this has the effect of turning prisons into &quot;institutions of higher criminal learning&quot;.

Many prisons in the United States are overcrowded. For example, California&#x27;s 33 prisons have a total capacity of 100,000, but they hold 170,000 inmates. Many prisons in California and around the country are forced to turn old gymnasiums and classrooms into huge bunkhouses for inmates. They do this by placing hundreds of bunk beds next to one another, in these gyms, without any type of barriers to keep inmates separated. In California, the inadequate security engendered by this situation, coupled with insufficient staffing levels, have led to increased violence and a prison health system that causes one death a week. This situation has led the courts to order California to release 27% of the current prison population, citing the Eighth Amendment&#x27;s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. The three-judge court considering requests by the &quot;Plata v. Schwarzenegger&quot; and &quot;Coleman v. Schwarzenegger&quot; courts found California&#x27;s prisons have become criminogenic as a result of prison overcrowding.

In 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court case of &quot;Cutter v. Wilkinson&quot; established that prisons that received federal funds could not deny prisoners accommodations necessary for religious practices.

According to a Supreme Court ruling issued on May 23, 2011, California – which has the highest overcrowding rate of any prison system in the country – must alleviate overcrowding in the state&#x27;s prisons, reducing the prisoner population by 30,000 over the next two years.
Solitary confinement is widely used in U.S. prisons, yet it is underreported by most states, while some do not report it at all. Isolation of prisoners has been condemned by the UN in 2011 as a form of torture. At over 80,000 at any given time, the U.S. has more prisoners confined in isolation than any other country in the world. In Louisiana, with 843 prisoners per 100,000 citizens, there have been prisoners, such as the Angola Three, held for as long as forty years in isolation. A June 2023 study by Solitary Watch found that over 120,000 people on any given day are in solitary confinement in the United States.

In 1999, the Supreme Court of Norway refused to extradite American hashish-smuggler Henry Hendricksen, as they declared that US prisons do not meet their minimum humanitarian standards.

In 2011, some 885 people died while being held in local jails (not in prisons after being convicted of a crime and sentenced) throughout the United States. According to federal statistics, roughly 4,400 inmates die in U.S. prisons and jails annually, excluding executions.

As of September 2013, condoms for prisoners are only available in the U.S. State of Vermont (on September 17, 2013, the California Senate approved a bill for condom distribution inside the state&#x27;s prisons, but the bill was not yet law at the time of approval) and in county jails in San Francisco.

In September 2016, a group of corrections officers at Holman Correctional Facility have gone on strike over safety concerns and overcrowding. Prisoners refer to the facility as a &quot;slaughterhouse&quot; as stabbings are a routine occurrence.

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) requested health data from 54 state and territorial health department jurisdictions. 32 (86%) of 37 jurisdictions that responded reported at least one confirmed COVID-19 case among inmates or staff members. As of April 21, 2020, there were 4,893 cases and 88 deaths among inmates and 2,778 cases and 15 deaths among staff members.

===Conditions for Women===

The conditions for women, especially Black women, are often poor. Many prisons are known to do less to help Black women get out of the prison system. Because prisons are male dominated, a larger portion of the resources are allocated towards them. Another major issue that women face in prisons is sexual assault, which often comes from guards. Though this is a major issue for women, these types of assaults do not usually get the attention that they need, and the victims are often left not being taken care of.

Based on Angela Davis&#x27; &quot;Are Prisons Obsolete?&quot;, the prison industrial complex and mass incarceration is shaped by gender. There are significant differences in the treatment of imprisoned men and women. Women endure physical, mental, and emotional trauma as they are forced to endure sexual abuse and a lack of resources for their intimate needs. In prison, women are dehumanized and treated like objects in a way that has become normal. Like many other socio-political issues, women seem to be left out of the conversation when it comes to prison reform. Again, not many people consider the experiences that women have endured in their time of imprisonment. Women were degraded to an extreme extent, and sexual abuse was often brought on by the guards and officers who are supposed to watch over them. They are sexualized, and often sent to prison for a longer duration than men.

The petty crimes of women are also not met with the same intensity of murder charges for men. According to Davis, &quot;masculine criminality has always been deemed more &quot;normal&quot; than feminine criminality&quot; (Davis, 2011). When a woman commits a crime, it is not as common and so it is practically considered psychotic. Because of this, &quot;deviant women have been constructed as insane&quot; (Davis, 2011). Women are treated as if their crimes are more irrational because of their gender, and their sentencing can be harsher as a result. Women are even more inclined to be imprisoned in psychiatric hospitals than men, and prescribed psychiatric treatment.

===Privatization===

Prior to the 1980s, private prisons did not exist in the U.S. During the 1980s, as a result of the War on Drugs by the Reagan Administration, the number of people incarcerated rose. This created a demand for more prison space. The result was the development of privatization and the for-profit prison industry.

A 1998 study was performed using three comparable Louisiana medium security prisons, two of which were privately run by different corporations and one of which was publicly run. The data from this study suggested that the privately run prisons operated more cost-effectively without sacrificing the safety of inmates and staff. The study concluded that both privately run prisons had a lower cost per inmate, a lower rate of critical incidents, a safer environment for employees and inmates, and a higher proportional rate of inmates who completed basic education, literacy, and vocational training courses. However, the publicly run prison outperformed the privately run prisons in areas such as experiencing fewer escape attempts, controlling substance abuse through testing, offering a wider range of educational and vocational courses, and providing a broader range of treatment, recreation, social services, and rehabilitative services.

According to Marie Gottschalk, a professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania, studies that claim private prisons are cheaper to run than public prisons fail to &quot;take into account the fundamental differences between private and public facilities,&quot; and that the prison industry &quot;engages in a lot of cherry-picking and cost-shifting to maintain the illusion that the private sector does it better for less.&quot; The American Civil Liberties Union reported in 2013 that numerous studies indicate private jails are actually filthier, more violent, less accountable, and possibly more costly than their public counterparts. The ACLU stated that the for-profit prison industry is &quot;a major contributor to bloated state budgets and mass incarceration – not a part of any viable solution to these urgent problems.&quot; The primary reason Louisiana is the prison capital of the world is because of the for-profit prison industry. According to &quot;The Times-Picayune&quot;, &quot;a majority of Louisiana inmates are housed in for-profit facilities, which must be supplied with a constant influx of human beings or a $182 million industry will go bankrupt.&quot;

In Mississippi, a 2013 &quot;Bloomberg report&quot; stated that assault rates in private facilities were three times higher on average than in their public counterparts. In 2012, the for-profit Walnut Grove Youth Correctional Facility was the most violent prison in the state with 27 assaults per 100 offenders. A federal lawsuit filed by the ACLU and the Southern Poverty Law Center on behalf of prisoners at the privately run East Mississippi Correctional Facility in 2013 claims the conditions there are &quot;hyper-violent&quot;, &quot;barbaric&quot; and &quot;chaotic&quot;, with gangs routinely beating and exploiting mentally ill inmates who are denied medical care by prison staff. A May 2012 riot in the Corrections Corporation of America-run Adams County Correctional Facility, also in Mississippi, left one corrections officer dead and dozens injured. Similar riots have occurred in privatized facilities in Idaho, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Florida, California and Texas.

Sociologist John L. Campbell of Dartmouth College claims that private prisons in the U.S. have become &quot;a lucrative business&quot;. Between 1990 and 2000, the number of private facilities grew from five to 100, operated by nearly 20 private firms. Over the same time period the stock price of the industry leader, Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), which rebranded as CoreCivic in 2016 amid increased scrutiny of the private prison industry, climbed from $8 a share to $30. According to journalist Matt Taibbi, major investors in the prison industry include Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Fidelity Investments, General Electric and The Vanguard Group. The aforementioned &quot;Bloomberg report&quot; also notes that in the past decade the number of inmates in for-profit prisons throughout the U.S. rose 44 percent.

Controversy has surrounded the privatization of prisons with the exposure of the genesis of the landmark Arizona SB 1070 law. This law was written by Arizona State Congressman Russell Pearce and the CCA at a meeting of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) in the Grand Hyatt in Washington, D.C. Both CCA and GEO Group, the two largest operators of private facilities, have been contributors to ALEC, which lobbies for policies that would increase incarceration, such as three-strike laws and &quot;truth-in-sentencing&quot; legislation. In fact, in the early 1990s, when CCA was co-chair of ALEC, it co-sponsored (with the National Rifle Association) the so-called &quot;truth-in-sentencing&quot; and &quot;three-strikes-you&#x27;re-out&quot; laws. Truth-in-sentencing called for all violent offenders to serve 85 percent of their sentences before being eligible for release; three strikes called for mandatory life imprisonment for a third felony conviction. Some prison officers unions in publicly run facilities such as California Correctional Peace Officers Association have, in the past, also supported measures such as three-strike laws. Such laws increased the prison population.

In addition to CCA and GEO Group, companies operating in the private prison business include Management and Training Corporation, and Community Education Centers. The GEO Group was formerly known as the Wackenhut Corrections division. It includes the former Correctional Services Corporation and Cornell Companies, which were purchased by GEO in 2005 and 2010. Such companies often sign contracts with states obliging them to fill prison beds or reimburse them for those that go unused.

Private companies which provide services to prisons combine in the American Correctional Association, a 501(c)3 which advocates legislation favorable to the industry. Such private companies comprise what has been termed the prison–industrial complex. An example of this phenomenon would be the Kids for cash scandal, in which two judges in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, Mark Ciavarella and Michael Conahan, were receiving judicial kickbacks for sending youths, convicted of minor crimes, to a privatized, for-profit juvenile facility run by the Mid Atlantic Youth Service Corporation.

The industry is aware of what reduced crime rates could mean to their bottom line. This from the CCA&#x27;s SEC report in 2010:

Marie Gottschalk claims that while private prison companies and other economic interests were not the primary drivers of mass incarceration originally, they do much to sustain it today. The private prison industry has successfully lobbied for changes that increase the profit of their employers. They have opposed measures that would bring reduced sentencing or shorter prison terms. The private prison industry has been accused of being at least partly responsible for America&#x27;s high rates of incarceration.

According to The Corrections Yearbook, 2000, the average annual starting salary for public corrections officers was $23,002, compared to
$17,628 for private prison guards. The poor pay is a likely factor in the high turnover rate in private prisons, at 52.2 percent compared to 16 percent in public facilities.

In September 2015, Senator Bernie Sanders introduced the &quot;Justice Is Not for Sale&quot; Act, which would prohibit the United States government at federal, state and local levels from contracting with private firms to provide and/or operate detention facilities within two years.

An August 2016 report by the U.S. Department of Justice asserts that privately operated federal facilities are less safe, less secure and more punitive than other federal prisons. Shortly after this report was published, the DoJ announced it will stop using private prisons. On February 23, the DOJ under Attorney General Jeff Sessions overturned the ban on using private prisons. According to Sessions, &quot;the (Obama administration) memorandum changed long-standing policy and practice, and impaired the bureau&#x27;s ability to meet the future needs of the federal correctional system. Therefore, I direct the bureau to return to its previous approach.&quot; The private prison industry has been booming under the Trump Administration.

Additionally, both CCA and GEO Group have been expanding into the immigrant detention market. Although the combined revenues of CCA and GEO Group were about $4 billion in 2017 from private prison contracts, their number one customer was ICE.

===Labor===

About 18% of eligible prisoners held in federal prisons are employed by UNICOR and are paid less than $1.25 an hour. Prisons have gradually become a source of low-wage labor for corporations seeking to outsource work to inmates. Corporations that use prison labor include Walmart, Eddie Bauer, Victoria&#x27;s Secret, Microsoft, Starbucks, McDonald&#x27;s, Nintendo, Chevron Corporation, Bank of America, Koch Industries, Boeing and Costco Wholesale.

Initially, laws passed during the era of the New Deal prohibited the use of prison labor with the exception of state institutions. However, lobbying by corporations eventually allowed them to use prison labor by 1979, and by 1995 businesses won exemptions from minimum wage laws.

It is estimated that one in nine state government employees works in corrections. As the overall U.S. prison population declined in 2010, states are closing prisons. For instance, Virginia has removed 11 prisons since 2009. Like other small towns, Boydton in Virginia has to contend with unemployment woes resulting from the closure of the Mecklenburg Correctional Center.

In 2010, Prisoners in Georgia engaged in the 2010 Georgia prison strike to garner more rights.

In September 2016, large, coordinated prison strikes took place in 11 states, with inmates claiming they are subjected to poor sanitary conditions and jobs that amount to forced labor and modern day slavery. Organizers, which include the Industrial Workers of the World labor union, asserted that it was the largest prison strike in U.S. history.

Starting August 21, 2018, another prison strike, sponsored by Jailhouse Lawyers Speak and the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee, took place in 17 states from coast to coast to protest what inmates regard as unfair treatment by the criminal justice system. In particular, inmates objected to being excluded from the 13th amendment which forces them to work for pennies a day, a condition they assert is tantamount to &quot;modern-day slavery&quot;. The strike was the result of a call to action after a deadly riot occurred at Lee Correctional Institution in April of that year, which was sparked by neglect and inhumane living conditions.
According to a 2022 report by the ACLU, prison labor produces $11 billion worth of goods and services annually, with inmates often being forced to work dangerous jobs with no labor protections and little training, and are compensated with pennies per hour or sometimes nothing at all.

In 2023, a nation-wide movement had called to close the &#x27;slavery loophole&#x27; in the 13th Amendment, allowing an exception for punishment of crime. According to constitutional scholars, the 13th amendment had been violated as most US states forced inmates to work for no or marginal compensation.

===Cost===

Judicial, police, and corrections costs totaled $212 billion in 2011 according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In 2007, around $74 billion was spent on corrections according to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. Despite federal statistics including statements made by former Attorney General Eric Holder, according to research on corrections expenditure published in the ▲Church white paper &quot;On Security&quot;, Federal Prisons and Detention FY15 Requested Budget was just $8.5 billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;▲Church2014/12&quot;&gt;White Paper on Security Fact Sheet. December 1, 2014. Retrieved October 16, 2020. &quot;▲Church Publishing.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Federal Bureau of Prisons&#x27; spending was $6.9 billion counting 20,911 correctional officers of 43,297 positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;2013/12/21/bop&quot;&gt;Federal Prison System Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) FY 2015 Budget Request At A Glance. December 21, 2013. Retrieved September 2014. &quot;The United States Department of Justice.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Total U.S. States&#x27; and Federal Prisons and Detention including county jail subsidies was only $56.9 billion. Adding local jails&#x27; spending, $64.9 billion was spent on corrections in nominal 2014 dollars.

In 2014, among facilities operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the average cost of incarceration for federal inmates in fiscal year 2014 was $30,619.85. The average annual cost to confine an inmate in a residential re-entry center was $28,999.25.

State prisons averaged $31,286 per inmate in 2010 according to a Vera Institute of Justice study. It ranged from $14,603 in Kentucky to $60,076 in New York.

In California in 2008, it cost the state an average of $47,102 a year to incarcerate an inmate in a state prison. From 2001 to 2009, the average annual cost increased by about $19,500.

Housing the approximately 500,000 people in jail in the U.S. awaiting trial who cannot afford bail costs $9 billion a year. Most jail inmates are petty, nonviolent offenders. In the early 1990s, most nonviolent defendants were released on their own recognizance (trusted to show up at trial). Now most are given bail, and most pay a bail bondsman to afford it. 62% of local jail inmates are awaiting trial. This rate varies from state to state. As of 2019, Illinois has the highest rate with 89% of inmates in local jails unconvicted.

To ease jail overcrowding over 10 counties every year consider building new jails. As an example Lubbock County, Texas has decided to build a $110 million megajail to ease jail overcrowding. Jail costs an average of $60 a day nationally. In Broward County, Florida supervised pretrial release costs about $7 a day per person while jail costs $115 a day. The jail system costs a quarter of every county tax dollar in Broward County and is the single largest expense to the county taxpayer.

The National Association of State Budget Officers reports: &quot;In fiscal 2009, corrections spending represented 3.4 percent of total state spending and 7.2 percent of general fund spending.&quot; They also report: &quot;Some states exclude certain items when reporting corrections expenditures. Twenty-one states wholly or partially excluded juvenile delinquency counseling from their corrections figures and fifteen states wholly or partially excluded spending on juvenile institutions. Seventeen states wholly or partially excluded spending on drug abuse rehabilitation centers and forty-one states wholly or partially excluded spending on institutions for the criminally insane. Twenty-two states wholly or partially excluded aid to local governments for jails. For details, see Table 36.&quot;

, the cost of medical care for inmates was growing by 10 percent annually.

According to a 2016 study by researchers at Washington University in St. Louis, the true cost of incarceration exceeds $1 trillion, with half of that falling on the families, children and communities of those incarcerated.

According to a 2016 analysis of federal data by the U.S. Education Department, state and local spending on incarceration has grown three times as much as spending on public education since 1980.

Three articles written in the early 2000s claim that increasing incarceration has a negative effect on crime, but this effect becomes smaller as the incarceration rate increases. Higher rates of prison admissions increase crime rates, whereas moderate rates of prison admissions decrease crime. The rate of prisoner releases in a given year in a community is also positively related to that community&#x27;s crime rate the following year.

A 2010 study of panel data from 1978 to 2003 indicated that the crime-reducing effects of increasing incarceration are totally offset by the crime-increasing effects of prisoner re-entry.

According to a 2015 study by the Brennan Center for Justice, falling crime rates cannot be ascribed to mass incarceration.

===Society===

Within three years of being released, 67% of ex-prisoners are re-arrested, and 52% are re-incarcerated, according to a study based on 1994 data. Former inmate Wenona Thompson argues &quot;I realized that I became part of a cycle, a system, that looked forward to seeing me there. And I was aware that ... I would be one of those people who fill up their prisons&quot;.

In 1995, the government allocated $5.1 billion for new prison space. Every $100 million spent in construction costs $53 million per year in finance and operational costs over the next three decades. The government spends nearly $60 billion a year for prisons, and in 2005, it cost an average of $23,876 a year to house a prisoner. It takes about $30,000 per year per person to provide drug rehabilitation treatment to inmates. By contrast, the cost of drug rehabilitation treatment outside of a prison costs about $8,000 per year per person.

In 2016, over 6 million Americans had lost their right to vote for conviction of a felony. In addition, people who have been recently released from prison are ineligible for welfare in most states. They are not eligible for subsidized housing and must wait two years for eligibility for Section 8. It can be difficult for people to find employment, as employers often check a potential employee&#x27;s criminal record. Formerly incarcerated individuals may experience employment discrimination, and frequently have smaller social networks. This contributes to their struggle finding employment upon release into the community.

In &quot;The New Jim Crow&quot; in 2011, legal scholar and advocate Michelle Alexander contended that the U.S. incarceration system worked to bar Black men from voting. She wrote &quot;there are more African Americans under correctional control – in prison or jail, on probation or parole – than were enslaved in 1850, a decade before the Civil War began&quot;. Alexander&#x27;s work has drawn increased attention in the years since.

Yale Law Professor, and opponent of mass incarceration James Forman Jr. has countered that 1) African Americans, as represented by such cities as the District of Columbia, have generally supported tough on crime policies. 2) There appears to be a connection between drugs and violent crimes, the discussion of which, he says, New Jim Crow theorists have avoided. 3) New theorists have overlooked class as a factor in incarceration. Black people with advanced degrees have fewer convictions, and Black people without advanced education have more.

=== Family ===

Incarceration of an individual does not have a singular effect: it affects those in the individual&#x27;s tight-knit circle as well. For every mother that is incarcerated in the United States there are about another ten people (children, grandparents, community, etc.) that are directly affected.  Moreover, more than 2.7 million children in the United States have an incarcerated parent. That translates to one out of every 27 children in the United States having an incarcerated parent. Approximately 80 percent of women who go to jail each year are mothers. This ripple effect on the individual&#x27;s family amplifies the debilitating effect that entails arresting individuals. Given the general vulnerability and naivete of children, it is important to understand how such a traumatic event adversely affects children. The effects of a parent&#x27;s incarceration on their children have been found as early as three years old. Local and state governments in the United States have recognized these harmful effects and have attempted to address them through public policy solutions.

==== Impact on children ====
The effects of an early traumatic experience of a child can be categorized into health effects and behavioral externalizations. Many studies have searched for a correlation between witnessing a parent&#x27;s arrest and a wide variety of physiological issues. For example, Lee et al. showed significant correlation between high cholesterol, migraines, and HIV/AIDS diagnosis to children with a parental incarceration.  Even while adjusting for various socioeconomic and racial factors, children with an incarcerated parent have a significantly higher chance of developing a wide variety of physical problems such as obesity, asthma, and developmental delays.  The current literature acknowledges that there are a variety of poor health outcomes as a direct result of being separated from a parent by law enforcement.  It is hypothesized that the chronic stress that results directly from the uncertainty of the parent&#x27;s legal status is the primary influence for the extensive list of acute and chronic conditions that could develop later in life.  In addition to the chronic stress, the immediate instability in a child&#x27;s life deprives them of certain essentials e.g. money for food and parental love that are compulsory for leading a healthy life. Though most of the adverse effects that result from parental incarceration are regardless of whether the mother or father was arrested, some differences have been discovered. For example, males whose father have been incarcerated display more behavioral issues than any other combination of parent/child.

There has also been a substantial effort to understand how this traumatic experience manifests in the child&#x27;s mental health and to identify externalizations that may be helpful for a diagnosis. The most prominent mental health outcomes in these children are anxiety disorders, depression (mood), and post-traumatic stress disorder(PTSD). These problems worsen in a typical positive feedback loop without the presence of a parental figure. Given the chronic nature of these diseases, they can be detected and observed at distinct points in a child&#x27;s development, allowing for research to determine if additional health services can be used to intervene in their lives and prevent increased risk of future health challenges. Murray et al. have been able to isolate the cause of the expression of Anti-social behaviours specific to the parental incarceration.  In a specific case study in Boston by Sack, within two months of the father being arrested, the adolescent boy in the family developed severe aggressive and antisocial behaviors.  This observation is not unique; Sack and other researchers have noticed an immediate and strong reaction to sudden departures from family structure norms. These behavioral externalizations are most evident at school when the child interacts with peers and adults. This behavior leads to punishment and less focus on education, which has obvious consequences for future educational and career prospects.

In addition to externalizing undesirable behaviors, children of incarcerated parents are more likely to be incarcerated compared to those without incarcerated parents. More formally, transmission of severe emotional strain on a parent negatively impacts the children by disrupting the home environment. Societal stigma against individuals, specifically parents, who are incarcerated is passed down to their children. The children find this stigma to be overwhelming and it negatively impacts their short- and long-term prospects.

=== Health ===
With rising levels of mass incarceration, the prison population faces significant health issues while incarcerated. Health surveys of inmates show that the prison population faces higher rates of chronic and infectious diseases, mental illness, and substance use disorders than the general U.S. population. Based on analysis of the 2002-4 Survey of Inmates in Local Jails, incarcerated individuals had higher rates of hypertension, diabetes, myocardial infarction, asthma, arthritis, cervical cancer, and hepatitis. The prison environment exacerbates chronic health conditions since they cannot be properly addressed and due to the stress of social isolation. In addition, low-income and POC populations are often more susceptible to poor health outcomes due to social determinants of health prior to incarceration such as poor nutrition, lower average levels of education, higher levels of community violence and drug use, and lower rates of healthcare access.

The incarcerated population also has lower rates of health literacy. A 2016 study found that over 60% of patients had inadequate health literacy in a sample of formerly incarcerated individuals. According to the Health Resources &amp; Services Administration, health literacy is the ability to obtain, process, and understand health information to make appropriate health decisions. In the incarcerated population, low health literacy is linked with decreased confidence in taking medications, increased likelihood of emergency department visits, and difficulty self-managing chronic health conditions.

===Policy solutions===
There are four main phases that can be distinguished in the process of arresting a parent: arrest, sentencing, incarceration, and re-entry. Re-entry is not relevant if a parent is not arrested for other crimes. During each of these phases, solutions can be implemented that mitigate the harm placed on the children during the process. While their parents are away, children rely on other caretakers (family or friends) to satisfy their basic need. Solutions for the children of incarcerated parents have identified caretakers as a focal point for successful intervention.

====Arrest phase====

One in five children witness their parent arrested by authorities, and a study interviewing 30 children reported that the children experienced flashbulb memories and nightmares associated with the day their parent was arrested. These single, adverse moments have long-reaching effects and policymakers around the country have attempted to ameliorate the situation. For example, the city of San Francisco in 2005 implemented training policies for its police officers with the goal of making them more cognizant of the familial situation before entering the home. The guidelines go a step further and stipulate that if no information is available before the arrest, that officers ask the suspect about the possibility of any children in the house. San Francisco is not alone: New Mexico passed a law in 2009 advocating for child safety during parental arrest and California provides funding to agencies to train personnel how to appropriately conduct an arrest in the presence of family members. Extending past the state level, the Department of Justice has provided guidelines for police officers around the country to better accommodate for children in difficult family situations.

====Sentencing phase====

During the sentencing phase, the judge is the primary authority in determining the appropriate punishment. Consideration of the sentencing effects on the defendant&#x27;s children could help with the preservation of the parent-child relationship. A law passed in Oklahoma in 2014 requires judges to inquire if convicted individuals are single custodial parents, and if so, to authorize the mobility of important resources so the child&#x27;s transition to different circumstances is monitored. The distance that the jail or prison is from the arrested individual&#x27;s home is a contributing factor to the parent-child relationship. Allowing a parent to serve their sentence closer to their residence allows for easier visitation and a healthier relationship. Recognizing this, the New York Senate passed a bill in 2015 that would ensure convicted individuals be jailed in the nearest facility.

In 1771, Baron Auckland wrote in &quot;Principles of Penal Law&quot; that: &quot;Imprisonment, inflicted by law as a punishment, is not according to the principles of wise legislation. It sinks useful subjects into burdens on the community, and has always a bad effect on their morals: nor can it communicate the benefit of example, being in its nature secluded from the eye of the people.&quot;

====Incarceration phase====
While serving a sentence, measures have been put in place to allow parents to exercise their duty as role models and caretakers. New York allows newborns to be with their mothers for up to one year. Studies have shown that parental, specifically maternal, presence during a newborn&#x27;s early development are crucial to both physical and cognitive development. Ohio law requires nursery support for pregnant inmates in its facilities. California also has a stake in the support of incarcerated parents, too, through its requirement that women in jail with children be transferred to a community facility that can provide pediatric care. These regulations are supported by the research on early child development that argue it is imperative that infants and young children are with a parental figure, preferably the mother, to ensure proper development. This approach received support at the federal level when then-Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates instituted several family-friendly measures, for certain facilities, including: improving infrastructure for video conferencing and informing inmates on how to contact their children if they were placed in the foster care system, among other improvements.

====Re-entry phase====
The last phase of the incarceration process is re-entry back into the community, but more importantly, back into the family structure. Though the time away is painful for the family, it does not always welcome back the previously incarcerated individual with open arms. Not only is the transition into the family difficult, but also into society as they are faced with establishing secure housing, insurance, and a new job.  As such, policymakers find it necessary to ease the transition of an incarcerated individual to the pre-arrest situation. Of the four outlined phases, re-entry is the least emphasized from a public policy perspective. This is not to say it is the least important, however, as there are concerns that time in a correctional facility can deteriorate the caretaking ability of some prisoners. As a result, Oklahoma has taken measurable strides by providing parents with the tools they need to re-enter their families, including classes on parenting skills.

=== Caretakers ===

Though the effects on caregivers of these children vary based on factors such as the relationship to the prisoner and his or her support system, it is well known that it is a financial and emotional burden to take care of a child. In addition to taking care of their nuclear family, caregivers are now responsible for another individual who requires attention and resources to flourish. Depending on the relationship to the caregiver, the transition to a new household may not be easy for the child. The rationale behind targeting caregivers for intervention policies is to ensure the new environment for the children is healthy and productive. The federal government funds states to provide counseling to caretaking family members to alleviate some of the associated emotional burden. A more comprehensive program from Washington (state) employs &quot;kinship navigators&quot; to address caretakers&#x27; needs with initiatives such as parental classes and connections to legal services.

=== Employment ===
Felony records greatly influence the chances of people finding employment. Many employers seem to use criminal history as a screening mechanism without attempting to probe deeper. They are often more interested in incarceration as a measure of employability and trustworthiness instead of its relation to any specific job. People who have felony records have a harder time finding a job. The psychological effects of incarceration can also impede an ex-felon&#x27;s search for employment. Prison can cause social anxiety, distrust, and other psychological issues that negatively affect a person&#x27;s reintegration into an employment setting. Men who are unemployed are more likely to participate in crime which leads to there being a 67% chance of a person with a previous felony conviction being charged again. In 2008, the difficulties males with a previous felony conviction in the United States had finding employment lead to approximately a 1.6% decrease in the employment rate alone. This is a loss of between $57 and $65 billion of output to the U.S. economy.

Although incarceration in general has a huge effect on employment, the effects become even more pronounced when looking at race. Devah Pager performed a study in 2003 and found that white males with no criminal record had a 34% chance of callback compared to 17% for white males with a criminal record. Black males with no criminal record were called back at a rate of 14% while the rate dropped to 5% for those with a criminal record. Black men with no criminal background have a harder time finding employment than white men who have a history of criminal activity. While having a criminal record decreases the chance of a callback for white men by 50%, it decreases the callback chances for Black men by 64%.

While Pager&#x27;s study is greatly informative, it does lack some valuable information. Pager only studied white and Black men, which leaves out women and people of other races. It also fails to account for the fact that applying for jobs has largely shifted from applying in person to applying over the Internet. A study conducted at Arizona State University in 2014 accounts for this missing information. This study was set up similarly to the Pager study, but with the addition of female job applicants, Hispanic job applicants, and online job applications. Men and women of white, Black, and Hispanic ethnicities account for 92% of the U.S. prison population.

The Arizona State University study also found that incarceration decreased employment opportunities. The findings indicated that the presence of a criminal record reduced callbacks by approximately 50%. Hispanic women with a prison record fared most favorably in receiving a phone call back from potential employers, while African American women had modest results, and white women received the poorest results, having the lowest probability of receiving a phone call from a potential employer.

For men with a criminal record, white men fared most favorably, being 125% more likely to receive a call back from an employer than black men, and 18% more likely than Hispanic men. Males with a prison record were less likely than males without a prison record to receive a callback. However, the effects of incarceration on male applicants applying online were nearly nonexistent. In fact, the study found that &quot;there was no effect of race/ethnicity, prison record, or community college [education] on men&#x27;s success in advancing through the [online] hiring process&quot;. The Arizona State University study also had results that contradicted Pager&#x27;s study.

Effects of other types of incarceration, such as shorter stays in local county jails, can also affect employment at both the individual and macro level. At the community level, for example, jail incarceration has been found to diminish local labor markets, especially in areas with relatively high proportions of Black residents.

=== Environmental ===
Mass incarceration in the United States has created numerous environmental justice concerns, including both the environmental footprint of prisons and incarcerated individuals&#x27; exposure to environmental harm.

Prisons around the United States contribute to the water contamination of surrounding bodies of water. Prisons also contribute high amounts of air pollution which affects individuals incarcerated within the prison, surrounding communities, and the ecosystems in the surrounding area. Prisons around the country violate the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act frequently. The Environmental Protection Agency is supposed to monitor prisons in the United States. However, prisons often fail to provide Environment Impact Statements to the EPA each year, making it difficult to fully understand their environmental impact. Prisons also require a large amount of energy since they run 24 hours a day.

Many prisons around the United States are built on or close to superfund sites which expose incarcerated individuals to environmental toxins such as high levels of lead and copper. Some prisons in the United States are also built next to landfills, toxic waste sites, and old mining sites. Since prisons are not strictly regulated, the existence of these prisons inherently validates toxins to be prevalent in the environment. Incarcerated individuals are forced to breathe and consume these toxins with no government protection.

Another concern that incarcerated individuals face is not having access to adequate heating and cooling during extreme weather conditions which are only becoming more common due to climate change. As summers continue to get hotter, many prisons do not have air conditioning, and numerous incarcerated individuals die from extreme heat as a result. Although prisons are supposed to provide fans and ice to individuals during extreme heat events, they do not always follow through. During the winter, prisons do not have proper heating. Many incarcerated individuals complain that the Department of Corrections does not provide supplies such as blankets during cold weather, and they have to depend on donations or suffer with nothing. Environmental justice and energy justice activists argue the lack of adequate heating and cooling in prisons is a form of &quot;cruel and unusual punishment,&quot; which violates their Eighth Amendment.

There has been a growing movement to make prisons more sustainable through numerous &quot;green prison&quot; programs. Green prisons promote sustainable living while also focusing on the incarcerated individual&#x27;s rehabilitation which will hopefully lead to low recidivism rates. This includes reducing waste and transitioning to renewable energy sources. However, there has been some pushback to the spread of green programs within prisons as environmental justice activists argue they only reinforce mass incarceration.

==Criticism==


High rates of incarceration may be due to sentence length, which is further driven by many other factors. Shorter sentences may even diminish the criminal culture by possibly reducing re-arrest rates for first-time convicts. The U.S. Congress has ordered federal judges to make imprisonment decisions &quot;recognizing that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation.&quot;

Critics have lambasted the United States for incarcerating a large number of non-violent and victimless offenders; half of all persons incarcerated under state jurisdiction are for non-violent offenses, and 20% are incarcerated for drug offenses (in state prisons; federal prison percentages are higher). &quot;Human Rights Watch believes the extraordinary rate of incarceration in the United States wreaks havoc on individuals, families and communities, and saps the strength of the nation as a whole.&quot; The population of inmates housed in prisons and jails in the United States exceeds 2 million, with the per capita incarceration population higher than that officially reported by any other country. Criminal justice policy in the United States has also been criticized for a number of other reasons. In the 2014 book &quot;The Divide: American Injustice in the Age of the Wealth Gap,&quot; journalist Matt Taibbi argues that the expanding disparity of wealth and the increasing criminalization of those in poverty have culminated in the U.S. having the largest prison population &quot;in the history of human civilization&quot;. The scholars Michael Meranze and Marie Gottschalk contend that the massive &quot;carceral state&quot; extends far beyond prisons, and distorts democracy, degrades society, and obstructs meaningful discourse on criminal punishment. More recently, scholars have argued that a system of mass incarceration necessarily interferes with a free society &quot;characterized by industry, discovery, and creation.&quot;

Some scholars have linked the ascent of neoliberal, free market ideology in the late 1970s to mass incarceration. Sociologist Loïc Wacquant argues that the &quot;explosive growth&quot; of the incarcerated poor can be seen as part of the &quot;punitive regulation&quot; of poverty in the neoliberal era to mitigate societal fallout from economic deregulation, welfare state retrenchment, increasing inequality and the imposition of workfare and underpaid, precarious employment on the marginalized urban &quot;postindustrial proletariat&quot;. In this, he posits that the expansive prison system has become a core political institution, and that this &quot;overgrown and intrusive penal state&quot; is &quot;deeply injurious to the ideals of democratic citizenship.&quot; Academic and activist Angela Davis argues that prisons in the U.S. have &quot;become venues of profit as well as punishment;&quot; as mass incarceration has increased, the prison system has become more about economic factors than criminality. Professor of Law at Columbia University Bernard Harcourt contends that neoliberalism holds the state as incompetent when it comes to economic regulation but proficient at policing and punishing, and that this paradox has resulted in the expansion of penal confinement. According to &quot;The Routledge Handbook of Poverty in the United States&quot;, &quot;neoliberal social and economic policy has more deeply embedded the carceral state within the lives of the poor, transforming what it means to be poor in America.&quot; Historian Gary Gerstle reasons that while it may seem contradictory that the notions of market freedom and the establishment of a robust market economy occurred simultaneously with the reality of mass incarceration during the neoliberal period, neoliberals and even the classical economic liberals who preceded them &quot;had long argued for the need to ringfence free markets, limiting participation to those who could handle its rigors.&quot; Only then could they operate &quot;freely&quot;.

The sociologists John Clegg and Adaner Usmani assert that the high incarceration rates are partly the result of anemic social policy. As such, resolving the issue will necessitate significant redistribution coming from economic elites. They add that mass incarceration is &quot;not a technical problem for which there are smart, straightforward, but just not-yet-realized solutions. Rather they argue, it is a political problem, the solution of which will require &quot;confronting the entrenched power of the wealthy.&quot;

Another possible cause for this increase of incarceration since the 1970s could be the &quot;war on drugs&quot;, which started around that time. More elected prosecutors were favored by voters for promising to take more harsh approaches than their opponents, such as locking up more people.

Reporting at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association (August 3, 2008), Becky Pettit, associate professor of sociology from the University of Washington and Bryan Sykes, a UW post-doctoral researcher, revealed that the increase in the United States&#x27;s prison population since the 1970s is having profound demographic consequences that affect 1 in 50 Americans. Drawing data from a variety of sources that looked at prison and general populations, the researchers found that the boom in prison population is hiding lowered rates of fertility and increased rates of involuntary migration to rural areas and morbidity that is marked by a greater exposure to and risk of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV or AIDS.

Guilty plea bargains concluded 97% of all federal cases in 2011.

, two state prison systems, Alabama and South Carolina, segregated prisoners based on their HIV status. On December 21, U.S. District Court Judge Myron Thompson ruled in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on behalf of several inmates that Alabama&#x27;s practice in doing so violated federal disabilities law. He noted the state&#x27;s &quot;outdated and unsupported assumptions about HIV and the prison system&#x27;s ability to deal with HIV-positive prisoners.&quot;

In 2022, the bi-partisan Federal Prison Oversight Act was introduced which would require the Department of Justice&#x27;s Inspector General to conduct detailed inspections of each of the Bureau of Prisons&#x27; 122 facilities and would create an independent Justice Department position to investigate complaints. This was introduced shortly after corruption and abuse was discovered at a federal prison complex in Atlanta with the hopes that it would prevent such occurrences in the future.

===Department of Justice &quot;Smart on Crime&quot; Program===
On August 12, 2013, at the American Bar Association&#x27;s House of Delegates meeting, Attorney General Eric Holder announced the &quot;Smart on Crime&quot; program, which is &quot;a sweeping initiative by the Justice Department that in effect renounces several decades of tough-on-crime anti-drug legislation and policies.&quot; Holder said the program &quot;will encourage U.S. attorneys to charge defendants only with crimes &quot;for which the accompanying sentences are better suited to their individual conduct, rather than excessive prison terms more appropriate for violent criminals or drug kingpins…&quot; Running through Holder&#x27;s statements, the increasing economic burden of over-incarceration was stressed. , the Smart on Crime program is not a legislative initiative but an effort &quot;limited to the DOJ&#x27;s policy parameters&quot;.

===Strip searches and cavity searches===
The procedural use of strip searches and cavity searches in the prison system has raised human rights concerns.

== References in popular culture ==
In relation to popular culture, mass incarceration has become a popular issue in the Hip-Hop community. Artists like Tupac Shakur, NWA, LL Cool J, and Kendrick Lamar have written songs and poems that condemn racial disparities in the criminal justice system, specifically the alleged practice of police officers targeting African Americans. By presenting the negative implications of mass incarceration in a way that is widespread throughout popular culture, rap music is more likely to impact younger generations than a book or scholarly article would. Hip hop accounts of mass incarceration are based on victim-based testimony and are effective in inspiring others to speak out against the corrupt criminal justice system. The soul singer Raphael Saadiq&#x27;s 2019 album, &quot;Jimmy Lee&quot;, thematizes racial disparities in mass incarceration as well as other societal and family issues affecting African Americans.

In addition to references in popular music, mass incarceration has also played a role in modern film. For example, Ava DuVernay&#x27;s Netflix film &quot;13th,&quot; released in 2017, criticizes mass incarceration and compares it to the history of slavery throughout the United States, beginning with the provision of the 13th Amendment that allows for involuntary servitude &quot;as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted&quot;. The film equates mass incarceration with the post-Civil War Jim Crow Era.

The fight against mass incarceration has also been a part of the larger discourse in the 21st century movement for Black Lives. #BlackLivesMatter, a progressive movement created by Alicia Garza after the death of Trayvon Martin, was designed as an online platform to fight against anti-Black sentiments such as mass incarceration, police brutality, and ingrained racism within modern society. According to Garza, &quot;Black Lives Matter is an ideological and political intervention in a world where Black lives are systematically and intentionally targeted for demise. It is an affirmation of Black folks&#x27; contributions to this society, our humanity, and our resilience in the face of deadly oppression.&quot; This movement has focused on specific racial issues faced by African Americans in the justice system including police brutality, ending capital punishment, and eliminating &quot;the criminalization and dehumanization of Black youth across all areas of society.&quot;

==Federal prisons==

The Federal Bureau of Prisons, a division of the United States Department of Justice, is responsible for the administration of United States federal prisons.

==State prisons==
Imprisonment by the state judicial systems has steadily diminished since 2006 to 2012, from 689,536 annually to 553,843 annually.

==Military prisons==
Across the world, the U.S. military operates several detention facilities. At year-end 2021, a total of 1,131 prisoners were held under military jurisdiction.

<text>Vaxholm is a city, urban area and the seat of Vaxholm Municipality, Stockholm County, Sweden. It occupies the islands of Vaxön and Kullö in the Stockholm archipelago. The name Vaxholm comes from Vaxholm Fortress, which was constructed in 1549 on the adjacent islet of Vaxholmen.

For historical reasons it has always been referred to as a &quot;city&quot;, despite the small number of inhabitants, which as of 2020 total was 6,151. Vaxholm Municipality prefers to use the designation &quot;Vaxholms stad&quot; (City of Vaxholm) for its whole territory, including 64 islets in the Stockholm archipelago, a usage which is somewhat confusing.

==History==

Vaxholm Fortress was originally constructed by Gustav Vasa in 1548 to defend Stockholm against shipborne attacks from the east. The fortress lies in the middle of the Kodjupet strait, one of two main routes into Stockholm from the open sea.

The town of Vaxholm, which lies adjacent to the fortress but on the western side of the Kodjupet strait, was established in 1558, when King Gustav Vasa bought some farms from Count Per Brahe the Elder. It later received rights as a merchant town (&quot;köping&quot;) and in 1652 was granted the Royal Charter. The designated coat of arms reminds of the fortifications as well as shipping industry.

In 1849, the &quot;Djurgårdens Ångbåts-Aktie-Bolag&quot; introduced a steamboat service from Stockholm to Vaxholm. Through a number of acquisitions and mergers, this company became that known today as &quot;Waxholmsbolaget&quot;. As a consequence and in the 1860s, Vaxholm became a popular resort town, especially for bathers, and many wooden summer houses were built by people from Stockholm.

It was not until 1912 that houses were allowed to be built from materials other than wood, giving the town a distinctive appearance. In 1926 the town got its first fixed land connection via the single-lane &quot;Pålsundsbron&quot; bridge that links to the Bogesundslandet peninsular to the south of the town. This was followed in 1965 by the wider &quot;Vaxholmsbron&quot; bridge that links to the island of Kullö to the north-west of the town, carrying on its way to the mainland.

Until 2020, the urban area of Vaxholm, as defined by Statistics Sweden, was entirely contained within the island of Vaxön. However in that year, the urban area was redefined to include the adjacent island of Kullö.

==Transportation==
Vaxholm is situated on an island, but is linked to the Swedish mainland by a series of road bridges, and a bus service connects the town to Stockholm city. The &quot;Waxholmsbolaget&quot; and other ferry lines also provide boat services to central Stockholm and many of the other islands of the Stockholm archipelago, using a mixture of classic steamers and modern fast passenger ferries.

The car ferry connects Vaxholm to the island of Rindö across the Kodjupet strait. The Kastellet ferry, an electrically powered cable ferry provides passenger access to Vaxholm Fortress on its islet in the middle of the Kodjupet.

==Sports==
The following sports clubs are located in Vaxholm :
* IFK Vaxholm
* Vaxholms IBF
* Vaxholms TK
* IK Waxholm
* Waxholms KK

<text>Upplands Väsby () is a locality and the seat of Upplands Väsby Municipality, Stockholm County, Sweden with 48,907 inhabitants in 2020.

==History==
The municipality has a long history with clear traces of settlements from the pre-Christian times in several places. The first traces of human culture have been found during excavations of Hammarby ridge, about 400 meters south of the current Glädjen junction, where the excavation of the burial ground Ekebo found a bronze axe from around 600 to 700 BC. Upplands Väsby has a low topography and the people lived by fishing, seal and waterfowl hunting. Several finds of foreign coins testify to the extensive trade with foreign countries. They include Arabic coins found at Great Wäsby castle grounds.

At Runsa and Skavsta&#x27;s prehistoric fortifications, known as hill forts. Traces of aboriginal burial grounds are found in many places in the form of mounds, stone circles, standing stones, or minor bumps. The graves are sometimes the shape of a ship, as at Runsa, one of Sweden&#x27;s most famous stone circles. It is 56 meters from the bow and stern and was made in 400-500 AD. Other cemeteries in the form of large burial mounds exist near Löwenströmska Hospital and Runby, called Zamores Hill after the timpanist Antonin Zamore, a North African who came to Sweden in the late 1700s and who lived on the Runby Lower farm, now called the homestead. The largest cemetery is the Great Wäsby Castle ättebacke with around 200 burial mounds.

In the early 1900s, Upplands Väsby was a small station community. The town&#x27;s railway station was completed in 1865, situated on the rail line between Stockholm and Uppsala, built between 1863 and 1866. Around the station, a society grew. Anton Tamm had bought up all the land that the present society is built on. In 1903 Tamm, at the time was CEO of Optimus, established the first major industry, Väsby Werkstäder. The company manufactured brass and copper, including Optimus products. Väsby Werkstäder was bought in 1917 by Finspongs Metallverk AB. Over the years, the company changed its name many times, but was popularly always called Messingen. They were later Swedish Metal Works and Granges-Weda and offered die casting and plastic manufacturing.

==Upplands Väsby today==
The municipality now has the character of a modern suburban town, situated between Stockholm and Uppsala. The distance to the city centre of Stockholm is twenty-five kilometers and to the centre of Uppsala forty-five km. Travel to Stockholm Central Station takes 27 minutes (10 stations) by commuter train. Travel time to Arlanda Airport is seven minutes by local train, which also connects Upplands Väsby with Uppsala. From Upplands Väsby are many renowned music artists: Europe, Therion, H.E.A.T., Candlemass and IFA Wartburg have lived there, as well as John Norum and Yngwie Malmsteen. Even the actors Shima Niavarani and Shebly Niavarani have lived and attended school in Upplands Väsby. Some famous writers who lived in Upplands Väsby are Carl Jonas Love Almquist, P. C. Jersild, and Alexander Ahndoril.

==Settlement==

<text>Täby () was previously a trimunicipal locality, with 76,700 inhabitants in 2024. However, as from 2016, Statistics Sweden has amalgamated this locality with the Stockholm urban area. It is the seat of Täby Municipality in Stockholm County, Sweden. It was also partly located in Danderyd Municipality (the Enebyberg area) and a very small part in Sollentuna Municipality.

Täby kyrkby in the northern part of Täby Municipality forms on the other hand part of the Vallentuna urban area.

<text>Södertälje ( , ) is a city in Södermanland and Stockholm County, Sweden and seat of Södertälje Municipality. As of 2020, it has 73,872 inhabitants. Södertälje is located at Mälarens confluence in to the Baltic Sea through the lock in the Södertälje Canal. Since year 2000, it is the largest city located entirely within the province of Södermanland.

==History==
===Ancient history===
It is estimated that the first people reached the area around what is today Södertälje during the Stone Age, about 4000 BC. They formed settlements around 3000 BC, when the peasant culture is believed to have reached the area. Around 1500 to 400 BC, the strait between Lake Mälaren and the Baltic Sea narrowed due to the post-glacial rebound. Thereafter boats had to be towed over the sand ridge, which created job opportunities. Trade and service emerged.

Ansgar passed through Södertälje on his voyages to Birka in his efforts to Christianize Sweden in 829. Södertälje was first mentioned in historical sources in 1070, when Adam of Bremen mentioned the town in a description of the road between Skara and Birka in his work . However, the area was inhabited long before then. Södertälje received city privileges in the 1300s.

The castle Telge Hus was built at Slottsholmen during the 1300s. From here, Telgehus county was administered between the years 1318 and 1527. The county included Öknebo, Hölebo and parts of Svartlösa districts. Archaeological excavations have shown that the castle was surrounded by a moat. It is still partially visible on Slottsholmen&#x27;s northwestern shore.

Originally, the city was simply called Tälje (several spellings are known; including &quot;Telge&quot;, &quot;Talje&quot;, and &quot;Tælga&quot;). In 1622, the prefix &#x27;south&#x27; was added to distinguish from the then recently founded town of Norrtälje, located 110 km northeast of the city. Statistics Sweden started using the modern spelling in 1900.

The city first used St. Olof in its coat of arms. At the beginning of the 17th century, he was replaced by Ragnhild of Tälje (). After her pilgrimages to Rome and Jerusalem, her relics are said to have been buried in Södertälje.

Duke Charles (Who subsequently became King Charles) actively invested in Södertälje as a commercial and maritime city during his time as Duke of Södermanland, which contributed to growth. A port was built just south of the city. It was not until the 1740s that the city began with industrial manufacturing in addition to shipping and trade.

=== 1800s to 1950===

Södertälje already had a port, but during the 19th century it became necessary to extend it to be able to receive larger vessels. In 1819 the Södertälje Canal was inaugurated after 13 years of construction. Just over forty years later, in 1860, rail traffic between Södertälje and Stockholm commenced. The Western Main Line for trains between the east and west coast of Sweden opened in 1862, with a station in the city.

Around this time Södertälje became known as a seaside resort for Stockholmers. In 1849 the Södertälje Bathing Facilities in Badparken park was opened, with both a cold bath facility and a hot bath house. The bathhouses and the Societetshus venue have been demolished, but the Bath hotel at Järnagatan street, Strandhotellet hotel, Stadsparken park and Villa Bellevue still remain from the resort era, which lasted for almost a hundred years until 1945.

The tradition of selling the local pretzels, , is several hundred years old. They had their heyday during the resort era, i.e. around the beginning of the 19th century onwards. They were typically sold by older women, often referred to as (English: Pretzel ladies). The pretzels were primarily sold to tourists, especially at the city&#x27;s railway stations. The sale of pretzels, among other aspects of the resort town, was described in the magazine (English: Swedish Family Journal) in 1881.

By the 1900s, Södertälje&#x27;s population had grown to over 8,000 people. Around the turn of the century several large factories were established in the city: Svenska Centrifug AB (1896), AB Södertelge Verkstäder (1897), Baltic (1906), Aktiebolaget Astra Apotekarnes Kemiska Fabriker (Astra) (1913), Tobaksmonopolet (1915) och Wedaverken (1917). Perhaps most interesting is the formation of VABIS, Vagnfabriks-Aktiebolaget in Södertelge (1891). In 1911 it merged with Scania and formed Scania-Vabis. Nowadays, however, the company only uses the name Scania AB.

===From 1950 until today===

In the 1950s, conditions in Södertälje&#x27;s central parts were considered outdated. As the city grew, and modern apartment buildings were constructed in the outskirts, the city centre was still predominantly consisted of relatively small wooden houses. Hence, the city council decided on a major renovation of the central areas, where many buildings around the pedestrian section of Storgatan high street (including adjacent Nygatan and Köpmangatan streets) were demolished. Some of the buildings were moved to the Torekällberget City Museum. However, many of the 17th–19th century buildings around Olof Palmes plats, Marenplan, Saltsjötorget and Stortorget were preserved.

In 1960, Södertälje was still a fairly small town with a largely homogeneous population of 33,000 inhabitants. In the 1960s, however, the demographics of the city changed radically. The industrial boom and the structural transformation led to economic development and increased investments in the city&#x27;s industries. The large companies Scania-Vabis and Astra were in high demand of labour. Recruitment was primarily made from parts of the country that were severely affected by the industrial boom, mainly Norrland. When the manpower from other parts of the country was insufficient, foreign labour was brought in. Most of the migrant workers came from Finland, but also Greece, Italy and Yugoslavia.

During the 1970s, immigration from Finland declined, while many Christian Assyrians/Syriacs settled in Södertälje, mostly from Tur Abdin, Turkey. At the end of the 1990s, many Iraqis (the majority of which are ethnic Assyrians) arrived, and now Assyrians constitute the largest immigrant group. In total, about 39 percent of the city&#x27;s population are first or second generation immigrants. In 2013, there were reports in the media that a parallel society founded by the Assyrian/Syriac minorities had emerged, with norms, rules and a banking system without control from society. Swedish law enforcement allocated extensive resources. A trial against the mafia-like organisation (English: The Södertälje network) ended in 2013.

Södertälje also has a growing population of about 1,500 Mandaeans, most with Iraqi origins.

Construction of Almnäs garrison started in 1970. Svea Engineer Corps and the Engineering Troops Cadet School (INGKAS) relocated to Almnäs. They were joined by Swedint, the Armed Forces International training school, in 1984. During the 1990s, the Life Guards were also present at Almnäs. After 1996, the armed forces underwent a major reorganisation and left Almnäs altogether in 2004. The area is now a business park.

Many of the city&#x27;s modern attractions were built in the 1980s. A museum based on the book by French writer Arthur Good was built. The museum is called Tom Tits Experiment after the author&#x27;s pen name Tom Tit. The new bath house opened in 1987, and is now one of the most visited bathing facilities in the country. During the 2010 and 2020 centuries, several infrastructure projects were completed or started. Further widening of the canal and the lock was initiated, as well as the upgrade of the railway around Södertälje Hamn railway station to increase capacity.

===Administrative history===

The City of Södertälje was transformed to a city municipality during the Swedish municipal reforms of 1862. The city grew and subsequently incorporated Västertälje parish in 1946 and Östertälje parish in 1963. The city municipality expanded further in 1967, until it became the seat of the present-day Södertälje Municipality.

Within the Church of Sweden, Södertälje was part of Södertälje City parish. It incorporated the western part of in 1946, and received the name (English: Södertälje parish). It has since also incorporated the parish of Tveta. Between 1973 and 2010, part of the city was part of Västertälje parish. The eastern part of Södertälje still belongs to Östertälje parish.

Until 1971, the city belonged to the judicial district Södertälje Council Court. In 1971, it was changed to Södertälje District Court.

==Cityscape==
During the 1600s, the city was hit by two major fires; in 1630 and 1650. After the fire in 1650, the devastation was vast. All important buildings except the church were destroyed; including the school and town hall. After the fires, extensive urban planning was implemented under the leadership of Anders Torstensson, where the old irregular medieval neighbourhoods were replaced by a grid plan of streets. The 1650s plan remained largely in place until the redevelopment of the city centre in the 1960s, and still characterises many parts of the central areas. Most of the older buildings have disappeared due to city fires or demolition.
The central parts of Södertälje are today mainly the neighbourhood around what is commonly referred to as called Gågatan, which is the pedestrian part of Storgatan street. Stortorget was originally the absolute centre of the city. The reason that the area would subsequently expand (mainly in a southerly direction) is largely due to the fact that the Central Railway Station was placed near the city park. Unlike most other cities in the country, no railroad has ever been drawn through Södertälje&#x27;s central parts, which meant that very little central area had to be designated for tracks. Another interesting detail is that the old Södertälje largely consisted of wooden houses. It is commonly believed that this is because Södertälje never has been a major administrative centre, such as a county capital or episcopal see. For a trade city, it wooden structures were considered sufficient. The original wooden buildings are especially well preserved in the areas around Fredsgatan and Västgötagatan streets. The older wooden houses that previously existed in the central parts have largely been moved up to Torekällberget, which is Södertälje&#x27;s open-air city museum. The first apartment building in stone was built as late as 1865. The property was at Järnagatan 8, next to Saltsjötorget square, and was built by industrialist DJ Ekeberg. When Järnagatan was lowered in 1907, the basement level became the areas that are occupied by shops today.

Södertälje&#x27;s old City Hotel is situated on Saltsjötorget square. It was built to accommodate the high demand for rooms that arose during the time the city was a seaside resort. The City council decided to commission a new hotel on the site. Architect Ernst Haegglund was hired to design the building. The square also houses the old building for Svensk-Engelska Mineralolje AB, which was completed between 1931 and 1932 after drawings by architect Albin Stark. Between 1991 and 2008, the building served as city hall. The current city hall was built on the opposite side of the central station. The new building was designed by BSK Arkitekter, and inaugurated in the autumn of 2008 by King Carl XVI Gustaf. The building serves both as municipal offices and cultural centre.
The Central Railway Station is situated behind the City Hotel. It is one of few Swedish railway stations with two station houses. The first building is entirely in brick, and was designed in 1860 by Adolf W. Edelsvärd. The yellow station building was added in the 1910s and was designed by Folke Zettervall. Today, only the yellow building is used for ticket sales. The older station house is occupied by a bar, café and convenience store. The open square between the two station houses, the bus station and the railway tracks is called Stationsplan.

To the west of the station, across Järnagatan lies Villa Bellevue. During the era when Södertälje was a seaside resort, it was one of the city&#x27;s most notable buildings. It was built in 1871 by the royal pastry chef Davidsson, after drawings by architect Ernst Jacobsson. The new city hall is situated next-door to the property. Villa Bellevue is located on the border between the city centre and the centrally located neighbourhood of Mariekälla, which is named after one of the city&#x27;s water springs. On Parkgatan, which is a parallel street to the district&#x27;s main street Mariekällgatan, lies Villa Walhall. The villa was built in 1875 by engineer Ludvig Jerving. Villa Walhall and Villa Bellevue were considered so typical of the resort town Södertälje that they were described and depicted in a series of articles in the magazine in 1881.

Most restaurants and bars are located around Lake Maren. Marenplan square (formerly called Stadshamnen port), served as Södertälje&#x27;s most important port until the construction of Mälarhamnen port in 1880. When Marenplan served as city port, ships carrying goods would moor there, and sell their merchandise to individuals and traders waiting at the quay. Boat traffic to inner Maren continued until 1963, when the Maren Bridge between Strandgatan and Lotsudden was built. The bridge was only intended as a temporary solution, and became demolished in 1993. The Maren Bridge subsequently replaced a pedestrian and bicycle bridge. The initial plan was to have the bridge removed during the summer months to allow boats to moor in inner Maren seasonally. The bridge subsequently became year-round fixed link. The Sorbonne house lies where Lotsudden and Marenplan meet. It was built in 1905, and served as studio for photographer David Sorbon until 1928. The building was completely renovated in 1985–86, to accommodate several residential apartments and a restaurant.
Just above Marenplan lies the square Olof Palmes plats, which was named after the murdered Prime Minister Olof Palme. Among the buildings on the square is the old bank palace that used to belong to Södertälje Sparbank. Like many other buildings in Södertälje, the city&#x27;s patron saint Ragnhild of Tälje (Swedish: ) is depicted on the facade. The importance of Olof Palmes plats was especially high when it served as hub for the city buses, which have since been moved to the Central Railway Station. The streets Storgatan, Badhusgatan and Järnagatan begin at Olof Palmes plats.

Most department stores and high street shopping are located on (English: the Pedestrian street), which is the pedestrian part of Storgatan that runs between Torekällgatan and Stortorget. The pedestrian street is dominated by modern department stores, built during the 1960s. The largest are (architect Erik and Tore Ahlsén), , and (which initially was a Domus department store). A notable exception to the otherwise modern structures is Skandinaviska Enskilda Bankens bank palace, which was built between 1901 and 1902 at the initiative of the tobacco trader TH. Gustafsson. The local architect Tore E: son Lindhberg made the drawings. In 1939, the facade was modernized, and subsequently restored when the building was completely renovated in 1975.
The hospital on Orionkullen was built 1777–78. Until 1823, the building served as lazaretto of the Royal Order of the Seraphim. After 1823, the building became a private residence. From 1844, the buildings were used as city hall and for higher education. In 1907 the council administration moved from Orionkullen, allowing the educational institution to expand. As the school faculty moved to the new secondary school building at Erik Dahlberg&#x27;s road, a girls&#x27; school moved in. The girls&#x27; school at Orionkullen closed in 1968. The building is home to a cultural centre today.

The area where the secondary school moved is east of the canal, the Museum of Biology and the present day city hospital. After the 1960s upper secondary school reform, the institution became a Gymnasium Secondary school. Close to the school lies Mälarparken, which is home to the professional Miniature golf course. They local team has won several championships. The city council offices were also located by the park before moving to the intersection of Nygatan/Torekällgatan. Södertälje&#x27;s current hospital is across the street from the secondary school. It houses one of the county&#x27;s six trauma centres. It opened in 1907, but has been expanded and renovated on several occasions, most recently in 2017.

As the land post-glacial rebound made Södertälje Canal shallower, it became increasingly difficult for merchants to get between Lake Mälaren and the Baltic Sea to sell their goods. It was decided to build a square in Södertälje, where they could meet to and hold markets. The location of the square was carefully selected so it would be located equidistant between the city&#x27;s ports at Baltic Sea and Lake Mälaren. This way, merchants did not have to drag their goods longer than was absolutely necessary. The main square in Södertälje is thus not primarily designed as a trading place for the city&#x27;s inhabitants themselves. For hundreds of years, Stortorget was very important because of the lively square trade held there. At that time, Stortorget was regarded as the city&#x27;s centremost place. In modern times, when most trade is conducted in stores, the importance of the square has diminished. Marenplan has increasingly taken over the role as the most central location in the city. The most famous building on Stortorget is perhaps the old yellow wooden City Hall building, which was opened in 1735. The City Hall originally stood on the west side of the square. It was temporarily relocated to Västra Kanalgatan during the redevelopment of the city centre in the 1960s. Since 1982, the City Hall has been in its present location. Today it houses art galleries and a café. Across the square lies the current Södertälje District Court, which was designed by Åke Lindqvist, and built by Anders Diös.
On the northern side of Stortorget square is (English: Church of Ragnhild of Tälje) from the 1100s–1300s. It is the main church in Södertälje parish in the Diocese of Strängnäs. After many renovations, the church is today a large building with three arches. The oldest parts consist of grey brick walls that comprise the lower parts of the bell tower and the two westernmost compartments of the longhouse. Renovations were made after the city fire in 1650. Further additions were made in the 1670s, when the Cronberg-Hackerska choir in the middle of the southern wall. It was probably designed by Erik Dahlbergh, and is now used as a baptismal chapel. During the fires during the Russian Pillage of 1719–21, it was one of few buildings that survived. A major restoration under the direction of architect B. Romare took place between 1960 and 1961. A few years after this, two of the windows next to the baptismal chapel received new stained glass windows by F. Heybrock. The exterior of the church was repaired in 1986–1987, with the facades partially receiving their current colour scheme.

Above Stortorget and Gågatan lies Nygatan street, which is almost exclusively home to modern buildings. Among them, Roxyhuset (English: the Roxy house) is worth mentioning. The building was designed by architect Björn Hedvall, and was completed in 1939. Its lower level housed a cinema until 1992, when it moved to Lunagallerian on Storgatan street. After this, the Roxy House was partially renovated, and a convenience store, restaurant and nightclub moved in. Nygatan street is also home to Södertälje&#x27;s old Telegraph station. It was built 1939–1940, after drawings by U. Ahlbom. Around the time the telegraph station was put into operation, automation of the Swedish telephone network began. The station was subsequently closed after just 30 years. Below the station lies Torekällskolan school. It is the oldest of the city&#x27;s schools that is still in use. Since its opening in 1869, it has been rebuilt on numerous occasions.
Holmfastvägen road begins in the city&#x27;s central parts, and connects to the area Geneta in the western parts of the city. The road originally went all the way to Näsby, next to Lake Måsnaren. It was built during the 11th century, thus marking the early importance of the area around Södertälje. A large runic inscription called the Holmfast Inscriptions (Swedish: ) describe the construction by Viking Holmfast, including reinforcing the land and building bridges. Archaeologists find it likely that Holmfast&#x27;s old bridges remain under the roadway. Around the engraving, which is located in close proximity to the road, have today been cleaned up and put up signs from the Swedish National Heritage Board with translations of the inscription.

Retail parks are a fairly new feature in Södertälje. Until the early 2000s, the only really large collection of shops, apart from local neighbourhood centres, was in the eastern part of the city. With the construction of , just east of Weda, availability of shops increased. The area around Scaniarinken previously contained some shops, but has subsequently been extended to form . Some shops are also located around Hansaplan in the area Södra, close to Södertälje Hamn railway station.

===Bridges===

Until 1924, when the upgraded canal opened, there was just one single bridge connecting the eastern and western parts of the city. It was a swing bridge, near the old lock, at Mälarehamnen. It was built in 1910 at Södertelge Verkstäder. After it was replaced by a more modern bridge, the old swing bridge was moved to Stäksundet in the province of Uppland.
At times there was also an iron bridge that was rolled out over the lock itself. It was also possible to use rowing boats to cross. Boat services were usually operated women, predominantly dalkullor. A crossing would cost 2–5 öre, depending on season. The rowing boats could carry up to around five people. At the narrowest place, the distance across was just 12 metres. Embarking by Viksgatan street was especially popular. Many were willing to pay to avoid having to walk to the swing bridge and back again if they lived around the areas of Tältet or Hagaberg. During the winter, simple footbridges supported by pontoons were laid out – making the crossing free of charge.
There are currently three places where it is possible to cross the canal on foot or by car, plus two railway bridges. The northernmost link is the Mälarbron bridge, which has three predecessors: the swing bridge from the 19th century, and another swing bridge that was used between 1910 and 1924. Both stood about 150 meters south of the current Mälarbron bridge. In 1924, the first bascule bridge opened. It was often referred to as simply or (English: &quot;the Bascule bridge&quot; or &quot;the Country Road Bridge&quot;). It was a double flap bridge with two fixed bridge vaults on each side. Ragnar Hjort made the architectural design. After World War II, it could no longer handle the increased traffic volume. Hence, the current Mälarbron was commissioned, and opened in 1971. It is equipped with a control tower. Today the bridge together with the whole route from Landsort in to Mälaren is remote controlled from the locks in Södertälje.

The most central crossing is at the canal lock, and consists of the two bridges Marenbron, which crosses Lake Maren, and Slussbron, which crosses the canal itself. In 1963, the first bridge over the Maren was built. It was intended as a temporary link, and was subsequently demolished in 1993. The Marenbron was later replaced by a pedestrian and bicycle bridge. The initial plan was to have it removed during the summer, allowing small boats to reach the inner parts of the lake. It did however become a year-round fixed link. In September 2003, a referendum among the residents of Södertälje Municipality was held, where they could decide if they wanted a new car bridge to be commissioned at the site. The costs were estimated to 40 million Swedish krona. At the referendum, 56.5 percent voted no and 39.4 percent favourably, meaning no new car bridge was built. Suggestions to build an arch bridge or bascule bridge for pedestrians and cyclists have been brought forward. It would allow boats to pass under and reach the inner parts of Lake Maren in the centremost parts of the city. Pedestrians have also been able to cross the canal itself by walking across the lock gates.
The Saltsjöbron and E4-bron bridges constitute the southernmost crossing for cars and pedestrians. They run between the districts of Södra and Viksängen in Södertälje&#x27;s southern parts. Saltsjöbron is a bascule bridge, and the road that goes across it is called Viksängsleden. It is equipped with a bicycle and pedestrian path. E4-bron is a vertical-lift bridge, crossed by the eponymous E4 Motorway, and marks the southern fork with E20. It was built in the 1960s, together with the motorways around the city. Saltsjöbron was built in 2002 to relieve the E4-bron, and to provide an alternative in case of mechanical failure after one occurred in 1990.

Parallel to Saltsjöbron and E4-bron lays the railway bridge predominantly used by local and freight trains. It opened in the summer of 2010, and is hence the youngest bridge in the city. It replaced the old railway bridge from 1921, which was located immediately east of the current bridge. The old bridge was replaces as it was unable to handle heavy trains, nor deep-going maritime vessels. It was also too noisy. The distance between the bridge pillars on the new bridge is wider, to enable the canal to be broadened further. The old railway bridge had a small pedestrian path. After it was demolished in autumn of 2010, pedestrians must cross at Saltsjöbron instead. The old railway bridge replaced an even older bridge from 1860 that crossed around the area of Tältet. That bridge was demolished in the 1920s, when Saltskog railway station had been closed and replaced Södertälje Södra railway station (subsequently renamed Södertälje Hamn).

The Igelsta Bridge is the southernmost of the city&#x27;s bridges. It is the main route for long distance and regional trains across Södertälje Canal. It is 2140 meters long, reaches as high as 48 meters above the canal, making it Sweden&#x27;s tallest and longest railway bridge (after the Swedish part of the Øresund Bridge). Igelstabron spans between Pershagen and Hall. The bridge forms part of the Grödingebanan on the Western Main Line and opened in 1995. Södertälje Syd railway station is located on the bridge&#x27;s eastern abutment.

====Accidents and incidents====
On 13 February 2016, all four members of the English rock band Viola Beach (along with their manager Craig Tarry) were killed during their first overseas tour when their car fell from a bridge in Södertälje. The Swedish Police Authority opened an inquiry and found that Tarry, who was driving, had no traces of alcohol nor drugs in his blood. They also found that Tarry had engaged the brakes before reaching the bridge, ruling out the possibility that he had fallen asleep, and authorities said the incident ultimately remained &quot;completely inexplicable&quot;.

===Church buildings===

Södertälje belongs to the Diocese of Strängnäs within the Church of Sweden. A total of eight church buildings are located within Södertälje. The oldest and most important to this day is &quot;Sankta Ragnhilds kyrka&quot; (English: Church of Ragnhild of Tälje) from the 1100s–1300s, which is located on the main square Stortorget. Further churches belonging to Södertälje parish are (St. Michael&#x27;s Church) in Geneta, (Hovsjö Church) and (Lina Church) in Lina Hage. Lina kyrka was designed by Tallius Myhrman. It is renowned for its design, and has been depicted in several Swedish architecture magazines.
The main church in Östertälje parish is (All Saints&#x27; Church) in Östertälje. The parish also operates (Hagaberg&#x27;s chapel) on the grounds of Hagaberg Folk high school. It was built in 1894 as a chapel on Vartofta farm in Västergötland. The chapel was moved to its present location in 1914, after having been dismantled and transported by train. In the centre of the Brunnsäng area lays the church Brunnsäng kyrka, which is the youngest in the city. There is also a chapel at Södertälje hospital.

There are several congregations not affiliated with the Church of Sweden in the city. The Catholic Church in Sweden has &quot;Sankt Ansgar&#x27;s&quot; church by Mälarbron. The associated parish has members from a vast hinterland around the city. There is a sizable community of Orthodox Christians in Södertälje. The Syriac Orthodox Church has two bishops in the city, besides five Syrian Orthodox churches, two soccer teams and a TV channel that airs programs in Neo-Aramaic, Arabic and English. The minority group of Sweden Finns have services in the Finnish language within the Church of Sweden. There is also a Finnish-speaking Pentecostal congregation.

==Transportation==
===Roads===
The E4 and E20 Motorways have their southern fork after which they form separate roads at Saltskog junction in Södertälje. Other major roads passing through the city are Riksväg 1 (to Trosa and further south), and Länsväg 225 (to Nynäshamn via Ösmo). These towns, plus Mariefred, Stockholm, Trosa and Gnesta, are served by regular buses. Riksväg 57 (to Katrineholm via Flen ) also begins in Södertälje.

===Trains===

Given the many railways that go to or through Södertälje, services are both frequent and diverse. International trains to cities like Oslo and Copenhagen call in Södertälje, in addition to local, regional and national services. There are four stations within the urban area of the city: Södertälje Centrum (central station), Södertälje Syd, Södertälje Hamn and Östertälje.

Due to its topography and the fact that it is divided by a canal, it has been difficult to build good train connections in and through the city. Despite this, Södertälje is one of the largest railway hubs in Sweden. When the railway to Södertälje was commissioned, it was decided that the main line would not be drawn through what was then the immediate city centre. The decision was one of the factors behind the urban planning of the area Mariekälla, just south of the Järnatullen city toll.

The railway station in Södertälje became (English: Södertälje Upper). Its initial name of caused confusion as it was then well outside the city, which was resolved by the name change. The central station was named (English: Södertälje lower). In 1885, the stations&#x27; names were changed again, with Södertelge upper being named Saltskog, and Södertelge nedre becoming Södertälje Central. Both railway stations opened in October 1860, together with the railway to Stockholm. The railway would subsequently become extended further south towards Katrineholm and Gothenburg and become the Western Main Line. The railway Norra Södermanlands Järnväg through the northern part of the province of Södermanland opened in 1895, which meant that Södertälje also got a railway connection to Eskilstuna. Södertelge Öfre opened with a simple wooden station building with two platforms and a warehouse. A modern stone building replaced the old station in 1885. 
The Central Railway Station stands out by having two station buildings. The oldest is entirely in red brick, and was designed by the railway architect Adolf W. Edelsvärd. The yellow building was added in the 1910s and was designed by Folke Zettervall . In October 1921, the station Södertälje Södra opened together with the new double track through the city. Södertälje Södra replaced the old railway station in Saltskog, whose station house was demolished in 1947 or possibly earlier. 

The next traffic diversion occurred in 1994, when the Igelsta Bridge opened. Unlike the other bridges in Södertälje, it is built on sail-free altitude above the canal. Södertälje Syd railway station (English: Södertälje South) is located on its western abutment. It is the city&#x27;s current station serviced by long distance inter-city and high-speed rail. The old railroad below the bridge is used by commuter trains. Platforms are located both on the bridge, and on the old tracks below. The waiting hall is situated on a concourse level between the tracks. After Södertälje Syd opened, the stations in the city once again changed their names. Södertälje Södra became Södertälje Hamn (English: port), and the Central Station became Södertälje Centrum. Igelsta station had previously changed name to Östertälje.

Today, Södertälje is a railway hub for Svealandsbanan, the Western Main Line and Nyköpingsbanan . Both the more recent Grödingebanan for long-distance trains and the old main line run in the direction towards Stockholm. The many railways that pass through Södertälje mean that it is possible to travel to Sweden&#x27;s three major cities (Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö) without changing trains.

===Waterways===
The first functioning canal through Södertälje was built between 1806 and 1819 after drawings by water engineering engineer Eric Nordewall. The canal has since been extended and broadened on several occasions. Within the scope of the Mälarprojektet initiative, the canal was expanded between 2016 and 2020 to handle vessels that are 160 meters long and 23 meters wide. The project encompassed a longer and wider lock, and dredging of the sides of the canal to make them straighter. The width of the water surface was thus kept unchanged.

Every day, over 40 boats pass through Södertälje canal, carrying more than 5 million metric tonnes of goods each year. Of these, about 4 million tonnes are shipped into Lake Mälaren, and 1 million tonnes to the Baltic Sea. Primarily, coal, cement, iron, limestone and chalk are carried through the canal. The port of Södertälje also acts as a transhipment terminal from rail to trucks and ships.

The port of Södertälje consists of four wharfs: Sydhamnen, Oljehamnen, Igelsta, and Uthamnen. Sydhamnen primarily handles containers and roll-on/roll-off cargo, including imported cars. The oldest wharf is Uthamnen. Here, smaller quantities of odd bulk cargo are handled, mainly road salt. Combustible goods are primarily transported to the Igelstahamnen to the Igelsta heating plant. Oljehamnen handles imports of gas, liquid chemicals, oil and similar products. Since the 1950s, the port of Södertälje has been important for the Swedish import of cars. About 80,000 cars are handled per year, which corresponds to about 30 percent of total national car imports. Cars shipped to Södertälje are of Volkswagen, Škoda, Audi, Ford, Porsche, Opel and Mercedes brands.

===City buses===
Owing to Södertälje&#x27;s location close to a county border, both SL and Sörmlandstrafiken operate buses in the city. The city bus network consists of around fifteen bus lines. They use the Central Railway Station as hub. Before Järnagatan street became pedestrian, most buses would use that round through the city centre. Most now take Nygatan street. In addition to regular city buses, there are special services adapted to pensioners and people with disabilities known as Närtrafiken buses. Night services operate all night both weekends and weekdays. The city is served by two circular bus routes, one on each side of the canal.

==Economy==

Södertälje is particularly known for its two large companies, Astra Zeneca and Scania. Measured in sheer number of companies, the retail, wholesale and restaurant sectors dominate, with about 1,000 companies. The building and construction industry has about 600 companies in the Södertälje, and some 450 companies in the consultancy sector. In total, there are over 4,000 businesses in the city. Södertälje has a high number of small businesses with five or fewer employees.

=== Large corporations===
Aktiebolaget Astra, Apotekarnes Kemiska Fabriker was founded in 1913 by pharmacist Adolf Rising. Initially, the company had only ten employees, but already developed strongly during the first years. The company started with only five employees, but grew exponentially in its first years of trading. One of the reasons was an increased need for medication due to the first world war. The company merged with its British competitor Zeneca in 1999, and formed the pharmaceutical group Astra Zeneca. The company&#x27;s pill factory in Gärtuna in south-eastern Södertälje is the largest of its kind in the world, employing over 3,200 people.
In 1891, Vagnfabriks-Aktiebolaget i Södertelge (abbreviated VABIS) started as manufacturier of railway cars, petrol engines, automobiles, trucks, motor-powered draisines, motorboats and marine engines. In 1911 they merged with Maskinfabriks-aktiebolaget Scania and formed &quot;Scania-Vabis&quot;. The company only uses the name Scania AB today. The head office remains in its original location, by Saltskogsfjärden south of the city centre of Södertälje. Together with its subsidiaries, Scania currently employs over 9,000 people in Södertälje, making the Group the largest employer.

===Retail trade===
Most retail shopping is available in the city centre; predominantly on Storgatan and Järnagatan streets, but also adjacent areas. The &quot;Kringlan&quot; department store was one of the first modern department stores when it opened in 1965.
The name Kringlan (English: The Pretzel) is a reference to the long-lasting local tradition of selling pretzels in Södertälje. Other department stores include &quot;Luna&quot; and &quot;Telgehuset&quot;. Retail shopping outside the city centre is mainly located in Moraberg on the eastern side of the canal, as well as Vasa Handelsplats in the western part. Larger stores are also located around Hansaplan in the Södra area.

==Education==

KTH Royal Institute of Technology has a campus in Södertälje, where they conduct university education within Mechanical engineering, Logistics and other subjects all the way up to Master&#x27;s level including Master of Science in Engineering. Education is given in cooperation with the city&#x27;s two large corporations Scania AB and AstraZeneca. In 2018, KTH moved in to a newly built campus in &quot;Södertälje Science Park&quot; drawn by the architect firm White. The Royal Institute of Technology has 1,200 students and hired researchers in Södertälje.

Several universities conduct higher education at the learning centre Campus Telge. When it started it was located in Mariekälla, but moved to new premises that previously housed the headquarters of Astra AB in 2015. Both individual courses and whole university programmes are offered within a variety of subjects, meaning students can study at the campus all the way until graduation. Education within Yrkeshögskolan (English: Higher Vocational Education) is also held.

Hagabergs folkhögskola started as a Bible Institute in 1910, and became a folk high school in 1957. It is run by the Swedish Evangelical Mission. Around 250 students study at the academy, of which 20 reside at the boarding school. The curriculum mostly centres on studies of Christian theology. The general introductory course for students pursuing a career within the Church of Sweden, as well as , which is mostly non-religious and supplements normal secondary school education.

In 2017, Södertälje had 13 secondary schools, five of which were municipal and eight operated as charter schools.

==Culture==

Södertälje&#x27;s primary theatre is Oktoberteatern at Marenplan, which has a number of new productions each year. The venue opened in 1928. It originally contained a cinema called Castor, but was turned in to a theatre after a renovation in 1984. Södertälje is also home to Sweden&#x27;s only professional Finnish-language theatre group; Teatteri Kipinä.
One of the most popular cultural centre around the city is Kulturhuset i Ytterjärna (English: The Cultural Centre in Ytterjärna). The complex houses a theatre, café, conference rooms and offices. It opened in 1992, and won second prize for Sweden&#x27;s most popular modern building in 2001. During construction, special attention was paid to the acoustics of the premises, which has resulted in many concerts being held here. The concert hall has about 500 seats, and together with other anthroposophical activities receives about 30,000 visitors annually. Other cultural activities include exhibitions on architecture and garden art.

The stages Estrad and Trombon at the City Hall often show theatre as well as concerts and film. The association Molto has organised concerts and creative activities for youth since 2008. A recurring tradition in Södertälje is the local revue &quot;Täljerevyn&quot;, which makes humorous cabarets about the city, local traits and politics every year.

===Museums===

Torekällberget open-air museum (colloquially referred to as just or simply ) with the city museum Södertälje Stadsmuseum, is one of the most popular sights to visit in the city. The museum first opened in 1929 when the landmark windmill and a few other buildings were moved to the site. In connection with the redevelopment of the city centre in 1961, many old buildings were moved to Torekällberget. The museum is divided into the environments &quot;Staden&quot; (English: the City) and &quot;Landet&quot; (English: the Countryside). The urban environment is built around the main square Tenngjutartorget, where markets often are held. The square is surrounded by buildings from the 1700–1800s. Several species of domestic animals are kept at the museum. The environment conveys a picture of life in rural farms around Södertälje in the 1800s and earlier. There is also a stage where ballroom dancing and performances are often arranged during the summer months.

The vehicle museum Marcus Wallenberg-hallen (English: The Marcus Wallenberg Hall) is situated by Saltskogsfjärden, next to the headquarters of Scania AB. The museum is named after the industrialist Marcus Wallenberg Jr. The collections include a number of older vehicles and environments; like the first mass-produced car in Sweden from 1903. It also features railway cars that were owned by the Swedish State Railways, used between the late 1800s until the early 1900s. Exhibited objects have been restored to their original condition. A little less than half of the museum consists of newer vehicles manufactured during the 2000s.
Södertälje is home to a large science museum based on the book &quot;La Science Amusante&quot; by French writer Arthur Good. The museum is called &quot;Tom Tits Experiment&quot; after the author&#x27;s pen name Tom Tit. It started as a temporary exhibition at Södertälje Hall of Arts (Swedish: Södertälje Konsthall), but became so popular that it was turned in to a permanent museum. The museum is located in an old industrial building at Storgatan street. Today, it is the largest Science centre in Sweden. It occupies four floors, and has a park that is open during the summer season. The exhibitions contain more than 400 science experiments. Tom Tits Experiment received around 190,000 visitors in 2018.

 (English: Saltskog manor) was the home of the industrialist and mecenate Carl Fredrik Liljevalch. Today it serves as a museum. The farm dates back to the 16th century. Liljevalch acquired it in 1881. Previously, the farm had been owned by the families Lovisin, Gyllenstierna, Dufva and Tamm. Liljevalch did however became the first to actually settle there permanently. He took an active part in the daily activities on the farm, and aspired that Saltskog gård would serve as a textbook example of ideal farming. He undertook extensive renovations of the farm and the estates to make them a cultural centre filled with art. An extension was made to the main building; and a smaller villa was added, together with a barn, stables and outhouses. The garden contains several unusual species of trees and is designed as an English landscape garden. Two new commemorative rune stones were carved. Today, the manor is run by a non-profit association. They have restored much of the premises in their original condition. There are several artist studios and exhibition halls. Concerts, lectures and exhibitions are held all year round. During the summer season, theatre is also performed in the gardens.
 (English: The Museum of Biology) was donated to the city by patron Carl Fredrik Liljevalch. The building is in Art Nouveau style, and located on Erik Dahlbergs road. It opened to the public in 1913, thus making it the oldest museum in the city. The exhibitions were created by Gustaf Kolthoff and his son Kjell Kolthoff, and show animals and birds from the province of Sörmland (where Södertälje is located) in their natural environments. In total, there are over 100 different species on display. Kjell Kolthoff painted the large dioramas that have remained to this day. The museum was completely renovated and reopened in 1983.

The world&#x27;s oldest propeller-driven steamship which still has its original engine is S/S Ejdern. It was originally built by Götaverken in Gothenburg in 1880. During its first years, Ejdern operated in the Gothenburg archipelago, Lake Roxen, and several ports in central Sweden. Since 1906, it has had its home port in Södertälje. The first route from the port in Södertälje was to Mörkö, and cargo hauls in eastern Lake Mälaren . Between 1914 and 1957, the boat had one single owner, Rickard Fredmark. He sold the boat to the City of Södertälje. At that time, the ship was unprofitable and in very poor condition. The city subsequently decided that the boat was to be scrapped. In 1964 the boat was donated to an association for the preservation of old boats. Enthusiasts of this particular vessel broke out and formed (English: The Museum Association S/S Ejdern), who still own the boat today. Since 1976 they operate museum routs around Södertälje. From 1984, the boat is once again coal powered. S/S Ejdern has a capacity of 90 people, and often operates the route to Adelsö and Viking city Birka.
Wendela Hebbes hus (English: Wendela Hebbe&#x27;s house) is a museum of Wendela Hebbe, who was the first female professional journalist in Sweden. She became employed at the newspaper &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; in 1841, where she wrote about theatre and music, and translated books. Besides being a journalist, she also wrote fairy tales. The building is a yellow wooden house, with two floors. It first stood at Snäckviken, close to the headquarters of Astra AB. The property was purchased by Lars Johan Hierta in 1863 to serve as a summer house for Wendela, her daughter Signe and the jointly unrecognised son Edvard Faustman. After being acquired by Södertälje Municipality it was moved to its present location between the canal and Marenplan in the city centre, and underwent extensive renovations. The venue houses a restaurant and a museum section with furniture and paintings from the Hebbe and Faustman families. It also acts as a cultural centre, hosting theatres and exhibitions.

 (English: Södertälje Museum of Arts) showcases various exhibitions of paintings, sculptures and other artistic installations. The museum opened in 1968, and relocated to its current premises in Luna in 1978. In 2015, Grafikens Hus (English: House of Graphics) decided to relocate to the city from nearby Mariefred, meaning there would be two art museums in Södertälje.

===Libraries===
Södertälje&#x27;s city library was originally run by an independent association, but was taken over by the city council in 1945. It moved to its present location in 1978. Lectures, courses and theatre are also held at the premises. The library has branches in Hölö, Järna, Enhörna, Hovsjö and Mölnbo. The libraries in Enhörna, Hölö and Mölnbo are combined school and public libraries.

==Sports==

In basketball, Södertälje BBK or SBBK is one of the best in the country, and &quot;Södertalje KINGS&quot; became Swedish Champions in 2013, 2014 and 2015. In total SBBK has won 10 golds for the male team &quot;Södertalje KINGS&quot; and 12 golds for the female team &quot;Telge Basket&quot;. SBBK has in total 132 Swedish Championships since the star in 1968. Täljehallen is the home for SBBK.

The city is home to Södertälje SK, a classic and successful ice hockey team currently playing in Sweden&#x27;s second-highest league – HockeyAllsvenskan – with Scaniarinken as their home arena. Assyriska FF and Syrianska FC are also two successful football clubs started in 1974 and 1977. They play at the same arena; Södertälje Fotbollsarena.

The Södertälje Rugbyklubb was formed in 1968. The Södertälje Storm Rugby League club are a pioneering Rugby league team, playing in the Swedish National Rugby League, which was formed in 2015.

There is an indoor swimming arena in which elite training and races are held, named &quot;Sydpoolen&quot; (English: the South pool).
==Climate==
Södertälje, and the rest of Stockholm region has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) and displays four distinct seasons. Due to the city&#x27;s high northerly latitude, daylight varies widely from more than 18 hours around midsummer, to only around 6 hours in midwinter. Södertälje has much warmer and sunnier weather than other locations at the same latitude mainly because of the influence of Gulf Stream.

Summers have an average daytime high temperatures of and lows of around , but there are periods of heat waves and many days with temperatures above +). Winters are cold, though sometimes milder with temperatures ranging from , while spring and autumn mainly cool.

Annual precipitation is with light to moderate rainfall throughout the year. Snow mainly occurs from December through March, but snow cover duration varies between winters.

<text>Nynäshamn is a locality and the seat of Nynäshamn Municipality, Stockholm County, Sweden with 13,510 inhabitants in 2010.

While interest in the area as a potentially useful port grew from the mid-19th century, it was only with the opening of the railway station to Stockholm in 1901 that Nynäshamn started to develop.

During the early 20th Century, Nynäshamn also became well known as a spa town, though most such facilities were closed down before the end of World War I. Main industries arrived through Telegrafverkets verkstäder (the factories of the Government owned telephone company) in 1916 and an oil refinery built in 1928-29 by Axel Ax:son Johnson &amp; Co. The latter still remains though under different ownership and under the name Nynas.

Nynäshamn was the venue of the Olympic sailing regatta in 1912.

Nynäshamn, which lies about 60 km south of Stockholm, is well known for being one of the places on the Swedish mainland from where ferries to the island Gotland depart. This is a hugely popular destination for Swedes of all ages in the summer months. The Polferries terminal also offer regular routes to Gdańsk in Poland. Several cruise ships on tours in the Baltic Sea also stay in the harbour, because they are too large to go into Stockholm.

A harbour party is hosted each summer, as well as local craft fairs. During these events a steam train often runs routes to and from Stockholm. During the summer months, the harbour is packed with boats of all sizes, and bustles with both visitors and locals. There are a number of eateries and boutiques with locally made produce. The main town is mainly modern and the buildings uninteresting generally. A library and one screen cinema is centrally located, and a limited amount of shops catering to mainly to local trade.

Many people in Nynäshamn live in apartment blocks, situated in estates, although there are none more than 10 stories high. There are also plenty of villas scattered throughout the town, and terraced houses. Life in Nynäshamn is generally relaxed, in contrast to the bustle of Stockholm. The surrounding nature and sea provides plenty of photographic opportunities, once you get out of the town centre. Crime is low.

Nynäshamn is served by Stockholm commuter rail (Pendeltåg) and several bus routes.

Popular singer Meja, and ice hockey player Kent Nilsson were born in Nynäshamn.

<text>Norrtälje is a locality and the seat of Norrtälje Municipality, Stockholm County, Sweden with 17,275 inhabitants in 2010. It is one of the largest towns in Roslagen.

== History ==

Norrtälje’s early history dates back to the Iron Age. Around 225 ancient monuments have been found within what is now the city. Three ancient castles are assumed to have stood in the former villages Nordrona, Solbacka and Knutby. Norrtälje traces its more recent history to 1219, when the location was first mentioned as Tälje. After some time, the name officially became Norrtälje, to distinguish it from the other Tälje in the province, Södertälje.

The town of Norra Tällie was founded by King Gustav II Adolf in 1622, as were several other towns after the outbreak of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, The city arms were created as an upside down anchor as early as 1622 when the charter was granted.

In 1719, large parts of the central town were burnt down by a Russian army during the Russian Pillage of 171921. The new stone church was not finished until 1726, and it was another four years before the city hall was completed.

Norrtälje had a railway station on the narrow gauge Roslagsbanan from 1884 to 1969. It is now served by SL buses as a part of the system of public transport in Stockholm.

Norrtälje has a first class industrial heritage displayed in the Pythagoras Mechanical Workshop Museum, based in the premises of a former hot bulb engine factory.

== Climate ==
Norrtälje has a humid continental climate with some maritime influence. Summers are highly variable and can be either very warm or quite subdued. The official station number assigned to Norrtälje was 8644 and there was an downtown weather station in operation until 1984.

The chart below is from Svanberga, a village close to Norrtälje. Its more inland location makes it a bit more prone to cold snaps than the town itself, although high temperatures are similar. Even so, Norrtälje remains quite a bit colder than Stockholm and coastal areas further south throughout the year and is more likely to have snow cover. The distance from the open sea to the urban area also affects the local climate, with less maritime moderation than in other coastal towns.

* BKV Norrtälje
* Norrtälje IK
* HK Ceres
* Roslagens GK

<text>Nacka () is the municipal seat of Nacka Municipality and part of Stockholm urban area in Sweden. The municipality&#x27;s name harks back to a 16th-century industrial operation established by the Crown at Nacka farmstead where conditions for water mills are good. However, and somewhat confusingly, that spot is not densely populated today and the municipal seat is on land that once belonged to Järla farmstead on the other side of Lake Järla.

==Events==
On 9 December 2014, Stockholm police raided a data center in a former bomb shelter under a hill in Nacka municipality. Although it was rumored the raid targeted popular torrent site The Pirate Bay, officials from The Pirate Bay have revealed that this is false.

<text>Lidingö (), also known in its definite form Lidingön and as Lidingölandet, is an island in the inner Stockholm archipelago, northeast of Stockholm, Sweden. In 2023, the population of the Lidingö urban area on the island was 48,162. It is the seat of government of the Lidingö Municipality, Stockholm County.

Lidingö&#x27;s qualities have attracted affluent residents such as Björn Ulvaeus, Agnetha Fältskog, Anni-Frid Lyngstad and Benny Andersson of ABBA. Exclusive regions include the coastal region between and the east tip of the island, Gåshaga, as well as the east tip of the northern part of the horse shoe, called . Notwithstanding the fact that many middle-class Swedes have moved to the island, (due to rental apartment construction projects), the inhabitants of the municipality remains the third wealthiest in Sweden after Danderyd and Täby.

==History==
===Runic inscriptions===
Two runic inscriptions have been found on Lidingö. The latest, listed in Rundata as the Uppland Runic Inscription Fv1986 84, was found in 1984 under a 10 cm thick layer of soil and moss in an uninhabited region. The inscription is from the Viking Age, around 800–1050 AD. The inscription has been translated as:

:&quot;Åsmund carved runes in memory of his grandfather Sten, father of Sibbe and Gerbjörn...a great monument over a good man.&quot;

The figures show large snakes and on top, a Maltese cross, a typical motif for the late Viking Age rune stones.

===Later history===

Approximately 300 to 400 years after the carving of the runes, the inhabitants of Lidingö had established small farms. Lidingö is first mentioned in writing in 1328, in the will of Jedvard Filipsson, in the sentence &quot;curiam in Lydhingø&quot; meaning a &quot;Lidingö farm&quot;.

Bo Jonsson (Grip) (early 1330s – 20 August 1386) bought the entire island between 1376 and 1381. In approximately 1480, the island was taken over by the Banér family from Djursholm. On 29 August 1774, Johan Gabriel Banér (1733–1811) also from Djursholm, sold the entire island and the land was divided into 25 farms.

In the east part of Lidingö, the Långängen-Elfvik nature reserve, which includes of open farmland and most of the forest land on Elfvik, has, preserved within its boundaries, one of the largest old farms, the Elfviks farm. Most of the original houses, built from the end of the 18th century to mid‑19th century, have been saved and restored. The farm is still active with beef cattle, sheep, and horses and is run by Lidingö Municipality.

The first church was built in 1623.

The IBM educational center for northern Europe, was built close to the Elfvik farm in the early 1960s. The centre was later converted to a hotel.

<doc id="1021722" wikidata="Q3183470" url="?curid=1021722" title="Sigtuna">
<text>Sigtuna is a locality situated in the eponymous Sigtuna Municipality, in Stockholm County, Sweden with 9,689 inhabitants in 2020. It is the namesake even though the seat of the municipality is in another locality, Märsta.
Sigtuna is for historical reasons still often referred to as a .

Sigtuna is situated at the bay Skarven, stretching around Upplands-Bro and a part of Lake Mälaren. Present-day Sigtuna, a harbour town that was established around 980, developed about east of Old Sigtuna, which, according to Old Norse religion, was previously the home of the widely revered god Odin.

==Etymology==
The name of Sigtuna was moved from what is presently called Signhildsberg. The meaning of &quot;Sigtuna&quot; is contested. According to one theory, it is a compound name where the second element is -&quot;&quot; and the first one is either of two closely related dialectal words, viz. &quot;sig&quot; meaning &quot;seeping water&quot; or &quot;swamp&quot; or &quot;sik&quot; meaning &quot;swamp&quot;. As a basis for this interpretation, a brook south of Signhildsberg has been mentioned, or the fact that the estate was surrounded by marshy terrain. 

Another theory considers the name to be an ancient prestigious &quot;wander toponym&quot;, meaning &quot;strong fortress&quot;, like the Celtic toponym &quot;Segodunum&quot;, from Proto-Germanic *&quot;&quot;, Old Norse &quot;Sigtún&quot;, cf. Proto-Germanic *&quot;&quot;- &quot;victory&quot;: Gothic &quot;&quot;, Old Norse &quot;&quot;, Old English &quot;&quot;, Old Frisian &quot;sige, sīge&quot;, Old High German &quot;&quot;.

== History ==
Sigtuna was founded on what was then the shore of Lake Mälaren just over 1,000 years ago. It took its name from an ancient royal estate (see Uppsala öd) several kilometers to the west (see Fornsigtuna). Various sources claim King Eric the Victorious as founder while others claim King Olof Skötkonung.

It operated as a royal and commercial centre for some 250 years, and was one of the most important cities of Sweden. During a brief period at the end of the 10th and beginning of the 11th century, Sweden&#x27;s first coins were minted here. St. Mary&#x27;s Church, built in the 13th century by the Dominican order as a monastery church, still remains largely intact. The Dominican monastery played an important role in the Swedish Middle Ages and produced many important church officials, among them many Swedish archbishops. Many church and monastery ruins still stand, including St. Pers Church (&quot;S:t Pers kyrkoruin&quot;) dating the 1100s, St. Olof Church (&quot;S:t Olofs kyrkoruin&quot;) dated from around the middle of the 11th century, and St. Lars Church (&quot;S:t Lars kyrkoruin&quot;) dating from the middle of the 13th century.

In 1187, Sigtuna was attacked and pillaged by raiders from across the Baltic Sea, possibly from Curonia, or Estonians from the island of Saaremaa (Oeselians), or Karelians and Novgorodians, 
Archaeological excavations have not verified the traditions of destruction of the town. Normal life in Sigtuna continued until the town started to slowly lose its importance during the 13th century due to navigability problems caused by post-glacial rebound.

The current coat of arms can be traced to the town&#x27;s first known seal, dating from 1311. According to a legend (possibly inspired by the town arms), Sigtuna was once the Royal seat, but this cannot be confirmed. The crown may also symbolize the large royal mint which was located in the town. Since 1971 the coat of arms has been valid for the much larger Sigtuna Municipality.

In the late 19th century Sigtuna still hosted only about 600 people, and was the smallest town in Sweden. The town remained insignificant until the second half of the 20th century. Much of the population growth can be related to Stockholm Arlanda Airport (IATA: ARN), situated some 10 km from Sigtuna.
== Tourist attractions ==
Sigtuna has a medieval-style town centre with restaurants, cafes and small shops. The old church ruins, Viking runestones and the old main street (&quot;Stora gatan&quot;) are popular attractions for tourists, especially in the summertime. The small streets with low-built wooden houses lead up to several handicrafts shops and the old tiny town hall (&quot;Sigtuna Rådhus&quot;). There are restaurants and &quot;Sigtuna Stadshotell&quot;, a hotel in the town centre.

<doc id="1021731" wikidata="Q506250" url="?curid=1021731" title="Stockholm Municipality">
<text>Stockholm Municipality or the City of Stockholm ( or ) is a municipality in Stockholm County in east central Sweden. It has the largest population of the 290 municipalities of the country, but one of the smallest areas, making it the second most densely populated. It is also the most populous municipality in the Nordic countries.

Although legally a municipality with the official proper name , the municipal assembly () has decided to use the name (&quot;City of Stockholm&quot; in English) whenever possible. This is purely nominal and has no effect on the legal status of the municipality.

Geographically, the city comprises the Stockholm City Centre and two suburban areas, Söderort (South Stockholm) and Västerort (West Stockholm). Administratively, it is subdivided into 14 districts (sometimes incorrectly called &quot;boroughs&quot; in English), which are administered by district councils ().

==History==
When the first local government acts came into force in Sweden in 1863, the City of Stockholm was one of the then 89 cities of Sweden. A first city council was elected. The area roughly corresponded with today&#x27;s &quot;Innerstaden&quot;. Large areas were annexed in 1913, 1916 and 1949. The city was outside Stockholm County until 1968, having its own governor. The local government reform of 1971 made Stockholm a unitary municipality like all others in the country.

==Geography==
Geographically, the City of Stockholm comprises the central part of the capital (Innerstaden or &quot;Stockholm City Centre&quot;) as well as the southern and western suburban parts (Söderort or &quot;South Stockholm&quot; and Västerort or &quot;West Stockholm&quot; respectively). Of the municipal population, all but 200 people are considered living in the Stockholm urban area, a &quot;tätort&quot; further extending into ten other municipalities.

==Demography==
===Population development===
===Education===
The share of highly educated persons, according to Statistics Sweden&#x27;s definition: persons with post-secondary education that is three years or longer, is 42.4% (national average: 27.0%).

===Residents with a foreign background===
On the 31 of December 2017 the number of people with a foreign background (persons born outside of Sweden or with two parents born outside of Sweden) was 311,401, or 32.79% of the population (949,761 on the 31 of December 2017). On the 31 of December 2002 the number of residents with a foreign background was (per the same definition) 189 938, or 25.05% of the population (758,148 on the 31 of December 2002). On 31 December 2017 there were 949,761 residents in Stockholm, of which 234,703 people (24.71%) were born in a country other than Sweden. Divided by country in the table below - the Nordic countries as well as the 12 most common countries of birth outside of Sweden for Swedish residents have been included, with other countries of birth bundled together by continent by Statistics Sweden.

==Politics==

===National===
These are the election results from the 1973 onwards in the City of Stockholm. The municipality forms one of three municipal constituencies for the Riksdag along with Gothenburg and Malmö. In the Statistics Sweden reports from 1988 to 1998 the exact decimals of the Sweden Democrats were not reported since only parties near the 4% nationwide threshold were reported on.

====Riksdag====
Blocs

This lists the relative strength of the socialist and centre-right blocs since 1973, but parties not elected to the Riksdag are inserted as &quot;other&quot;, including the Sweden Democrats results from 1988 to 2006, but also the Christian Democrats pre-1991 and the Greens in 1982, 1985 and 1991. The sources are identical to the table above. The coalition or government mandate marked in bold formed the government after the election. New Democracy got elected in 1991 but are still listed as &quot;other&quot; due to the short lifespan of the party. &quot;Elected&quot; is the total number of percentage points from the municipality that went to parties who were elected to the Riksdag.

===Local===
The municipality is governed by a Municipal assembly (&quot;kommunfullmäktige&quot;) with 101 members. These are elected through municipal elections, held in conjunction with the Parliamentary elections every four years. The council meets twice a month and the meetings are open to the public. The council elects a Municipal executive committee (&quot;kommunstyrelse&quot;), with 13 members representing both the political majority and the opposition, with the responsibility of implementing policies approved by the assembly. The political organisation also includes eight governing full-time Commissioners (&quot;borgarråd&quot;) and four Commissioners representing the opposition. The work is headed by the Commissioner of Finance (&quot;finansborgarråd&quot;, sometimes called Mayor), who also chairs the executive committee. The current Commissioner of Finance is Karin Wanngård, representing the Social democrats.



===Municipal elections 1994–2014===
Stockholm Party is a local party, which was represented in the City Council 1979–2002.

===Municipal Election 2018===
On September 9, 2018 Stockholm held Municipality Elections
===Board of Commissioners since 2006===

*Sten Nordin (m), Commissioner of Finance (after 2008) (&quot;finansborgarråd&quot;)
*Mikael Söderlund (m), Commissioner of Building and Traffic (&quot;byggnads- och trafikborgarråd&quot;)
*Ulla Hamilton (m), Commissioner of Environment and Real Estate (&quot;miljö och bostadsbolagsborgarråd&quot;)
*Lotta Edholm (fp), Commissioner of Education (&quot;skolborgarråd&quot;)
*Madeleine Sjöstedt (fp), Commissioner of Culture and Sports (&quot;kulturborgarråd&quot;)
*Kristina Alvendal (m), Commissioner of Housing and Integration (&quot;bostads- och integrationsborgarråd&quot;)
*Ulf Kristersson (m), Commissioner of Social Services (&quot;socialborgarråd&quot;)
*Ewa Samuelsson (kd), Commissioner of Senior Citizen&#x27;s Service (&quot;äldrevårdsborgarråd&quot;)
*Carin Jämtin (s), Commissioner in Opposition (&quot;oppositionsborgarråd&quot;)
*Roger Mogert (s), Commissioner in Opposition (&quot;oppositionsborgarråd&quot;)
*Ann-Margarethe Livh (v), Commissioner in Opposition (&quot;oppositionsborgarråd&quot;)
*Yvonne Ruwaida (mp), Commissioner in Opposition (&quot;oppositionsborgarråd&quot;)

===District Councils===
The municipality is subdivided into 13 districts. These districts are sometimes incorrectly referred to as &quot;boroughs&quot; in English. They are, however, no legal entities or juristic persons of their own, but committees of the municipality itself. These districts are administered by District Councils, &quot;stadsdelsnämnder&quot;, which carry responsibility for primary school, social, leisure and cultural services within their respective areas. The members of these councils are not directly elected by the inhabitants of the respective districts, but rather appointed by the &quot;kommunfullmäktige&quot; (municipal assembly).

Effective January 1, 2007 the number of district councils was reduced from 18 to 14 through a number of merges. Maria-Gamla stan and Katarina-Sofia now form Södermalm borough, Enskede-Årsta and Vantör now form Enskede-Årsta-Vantör, Hägersten and Liljeholmen now form Hägersten-Liljeholmen, and Kista and Rinkeby now form Rinkeby-Kista.

== Twin Towns - Sister Cities==
The policy of Stockholm is to have informal town twinning with all capitals of the world, its main focus being those in northern Europe. Stockholm does not sign any formal town twinning treaties, although other cities claim to have established such treaties in the past which are still valid.

The cities claiming to have been twinned with Stockholm are:

<doc id="1021739" wikidata="Q829843" url="?curid=1021739" title="Márk Rózsavölgyi">
<text>Márk Rózsavölgyi (; born Mordecai Rosenthal; 14 August 1787 – 23 January 1848) was a Hungarian composer and violinist. He has been called &quot;the father of csárdás&quot;.

== Life and music ==
Rózsavölgyi was born to a poor tradesman&#x27;s family in Balassagyarmat, where his bust (made by Jelena Veszely in 1973) can be found in the Palóc-parkland. His family is believed to have had klezmer connections.

From the ages of 11 to 19 he worked as a clerk in Vienna, Pressburg (now Bratislava), and Prague, teaching himself to play the violin. Returning to Pest, he dedicated himself to music, composing in the Hungarian traditional styles, including the verbunkos. his first works were published in Pest in 1811; eventually he published over 200 works. In 1812, he was appointed conductor of the orchestra at the German Theater in Pest.

Basing himself in Pest, he travelled through the Habsburg Empire for many years, including extended stays in Baja and Temesvár (now Timișoara, Romania).

In 1824, he was made a regular salaried member of the Philharmonic Society of the county of Veszprém, and his name &quot;Rosenthal&quot; was Magyarized to &quot;Rózsavölgyi&quot; (both mean &#x27;rose valley&#x27; in German (or Yiddish) and Hungarian respectively) on the occasion of his election. (This name change was not however officially recognised until 1846). He gave several official concerts during the coronation ceremonies at Pressburg in 1825; and in 1835 he appeared at the Court Opera House in Vienna on the occasion of the Diet of Pressburg. Two years later, at the opening of the new National Theater of Pest, the Hungarian Orchestra of that city played a work composed by him for the occasion, and he subsequently became a regular member of that orchestra.

During the 1840s he formed his own band, and performed before Franz Liszt in May 1846 in Pest. Liszt used some of Rózsavölgyi&#x27;s melodies in his own Hungarian Rhapsodies (nos. 8 and 12). After 1846 his health began to decline.

A number of famous Romani musicians, including Patikárus, Sárközi, Farkas, and others, were pupils of Rózsavölgyi. After his death, the Hungarian nationalist poet Sándor Petőfi sang his praises in a long poem, reproaching the Hungarian people for permitting the last years of the artist to be clouded by financial difficulties.

Rózsavölgyi died in relative poverty in Pest, and was buried there in the Jewish cemetery.

His son Julius (Gyula) founded a music publishing company in 1850, which still exists in Budapest. Another son, Leopold, became a doctor.

<text>José Sócrates Carvalho Pinto de Sousa (born 6 September 1957), commonly known as José Sócrates (), is a Portuguese politician who was the prime minister of Portugal from 12 March 2005 to 21 June 2011. For the second half of 2007, he acted as president-in-office of the Council of the European Union.

Sócrates grew up in the industrial city of Covilhã. He joined the centre-left Socialist Party in 1981 and was elected as a member of parliament in 1987. Sócrates entered the government in 1995, as secretary of state for Environment in the first cabinet of António Guterres. Two years later, he became Minister of Youth and Sports (where he helped to organize Portugal&#x27;s successful bid to host UEFA Euro 2004) and in 1999 became Minister for Environment. Sócrates prominence rose during the governments of António Guterres to the point that when the prime minister resigned in 2001, he considered appointing Sócrates as his successor.

In opposition, José Sócrates was elected leader of the Socialist Party in 2004 and led the party to its first absolute majority in the 2005 election. By then, Portugal was experiencing an economic crisis, marked by stagnation and a difficult state of public finances. Like the preceding centre-right government, Sócrates implemented a policy of fiscal austerity and structural reforms. Among the most important reforms were the 2007 Social Security reform and the 2009 labour law reform. His government also restructured the provision of public services, closing thousands of elementary schools and dozens of health care facilities and maternity wards in rural areas and small cities. Despite austerity, Sócrates&#x27; government intended to boost economic growth through government-sponsored investments, namely in transportation, technology and energy as well as in health and school infrastructure. The government launched several public–private partnerships to finance such projects. Internally, Sócrates was accused of having an authoritarian style and of trying to control media, while internationally he completed the negotiations of Lisbon Treaty and had close ties with leaders such as the prime minister of Spain José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero and the president of Venezuela Hugo Chavez. The first Sócrates government was initially able to reduce the budget deficit and controlling public debt, but economic growth lagged.

In 2008–09, with the Great Recession starting to hit Portugal and facing recession and high unemployment, austerity was waned as part of the European economic stimulus plan. Nevertheless, support for Sócrates and the Socialists eroded and the ruling party lost its majority in the 2009 election. The second government of José Sócrates faced a deterioration of the economic and financial state of the country, with skyrocketing deficit and growing debt. Austerity was resumed in 2010 while the country entered a hard financial crisis in the context of the European debt crisis.

On 23 March 2011, Sócrates submitted his resignation to President Aníbal Cavaco Silva after the Parliament rejected a new austerity package (the fourth in a year), leading to the 2011 snap election. Financial status of the country deteriorated and on 6 April Sócrates caretaker government requested a bail-out program which was conceded. The €78 billion IMF/European Union bailout to Portugal thus started and would last until May 2014. Sócrates lost the snap election held on 5 June 2011 and resigned as Secretary-General of the Socialist Party. For most of his political career, Sócrates was associated with several corruption cases, notably Independente University and Freeport cases.

On 21 November 2014 he was arrested in Lisbon, accused of corruption, tax evasion, and money laundering, becoming the first former Prime Minister in the history of the country to be thus accused. On 24 November Sócrates was remanded in custody on preliminary charges of corruption and tax fraud. He was held in Évora prison until 4 September 2015 when he left the prison for a relative&#x27;s house in Lisbon, where he remained under house arrest until 16 October 2015. That day, a judge released him from house arrest, allowing him to await the end of the investigation in freedom, although remaining forbidden from leaving the country or contacting other suspects of the case. The police investigation, known as &quot;Operation Marquis&quot; continued until his indictment in October 2017. In 2018, Sócrates abandoned the Socialist Party.

==Biography==

===Early years===
José Sócrates was born in Porto on 6 September 1957, and was registered as a newborn in Vilar de Maçada, Alijó municipality, in northeastern Portugal, since the locality was his family ancestral homeland. However, the young José Sócrates lived throughout his childhood and teen years with his father, a divorced building designer, in the city of Covilhã, Beiras e Serra da Estrela, in central inland Portugal, in the Centro region. His parents are Fernando Pinto de Sousa (Vilar de Maçada, Alijó, 15 November 1926 – Porto, 18 July 2011) and wife and remote relative Maria Adelaide de Carvalho Monteiro (b. Vilar de Maçada, Alijó, 8 October 1931). He has two younger siblings, António Carvalho Pinto de Sousa, born circa 1962, and Ana Maria Carvalho Pinto de Sousa, died in 1988. He is a descendant of the illegitimate daughter of António José Girão Teixeira Lobo Barbosa (Porto, Sé, 9 January 1715 – Alijó, Vilar de Maçada), Fidalgo of the Royal Household and Knight of the Order of Christ.

===Education===
José Sócrates studied in Covilhã&#x27;s basic and secondary schools, until the age of 18. Then, in 1975, he went to Coimbra in order to attend a higher education institution. He earned in 1979 his 4-year &quot;bacharelato&quot; degree as a civil technical engineer from the &quot;Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Coimbra&quot; (in 1988 incorporated into the &quot;Instituto Politécnico de Coimbra&quot;). From 1987 to 1993, he took law classes at &quot;Universidade Lusíada&quot;, a private university in Lisbon, but failed to graduate. In 1994/95, already a well-known politician, he briefly attended the &quot;Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa&quot; where he completed some academic disciplines in order to get a CESE diploma (a complementary diploma to his &quot;bacharelato&quot; degree because until 1999 the polytechnic institutions did not offer &quot;licenciatura&quot; degrees), but instead, under circumstances which would provoke a controversy in 2007, he earned in 1996 the &quot;licenciatura&quot; (licentiate degree) in civil engineering from the &quot;Universidade Independente&quot;, a private university in Lisbon which was shut down by Portuguese authorities in 2007/2008. He also has an MBA degree awarded in 2005 by ISCTE, a public university institute in Lisbon, that he obtained after had attended successfully the first year of a 2-year master&#x27;s degree program of ISCTE that he did not complete. After his tenure as prime minister of Portugal ended in 2011, Sócrates and his elder son, moved to Paris where Sócrates attended the Institut d&#x27;Etudes Politiques de Paris (known as SciencesPo). In 2013, SciencesPo awarded him his master&#x27;s degree in political science. His 2013 book &quot;Confiança do Mundo – Sobre a Tortura Em Democracia&quot; was based on his masters thesis there; however, there was some dispute as to its authorship.

===Political career===
José Sócrates was one of the founders of JSD (the youth branch of PSD – Portuguese Social Democratic Party) before changing his political affiliation and applying for membership in the PS – Portuguese Socialist Party. He has been a member of the Socialist Party since 1981. José Sócrates served as a technical engineer for the Covilhã City Council, and has been elected a member of the Portuguese Parliament since 1987, representing the Castelo Branco electoral district. While serving as the chairperson of the Castelo Branco Federation of the Socialist Party (1983–1996), he was elected to the Party&#x27;s National Secretariat in 1991. José Sócrates was ousted by the Board of the Guarda Municipality in 1990 and 1991, after being warned several times because of poor quality of construction projects and lack of monitoring of the construction works. Sócrates was threatened with disciplinary action for wrongdoings in the technical direction of particular works of whose projects he was the author, but despite being ousted from this capacity, he was never penalized. In addition, as a Member of the Parliament, Sócrates was not allowed by law to work as a technical engineer between 1987 and 1991. From 1989 to 1996, he served as a member of the Covilhã Municipal Assembly. He served as spokesperson on environmental affairs for the Socialist Party from 1991 to 1995. In 1995, he entered government as secretary of state for Environment in the first government of António Guterres. Two years later, Sócrates became Minister for Youth and Sports and was one of the organizers of the EURO 2004 cup in Portugal. He became Minister for Environment in Guterres&#x27; second government in 1999. Following the elections of 2002 (won by José Manuel Durão Barroso), Sócrates became a member of the opposition in the Portuguese Parliament. Meanwhile, he also had a program of political analysis, hosted jointly with Pedro Santana Lopes on RTP. After the resignation of Ferro Rodrigues as party leader in 2004, he won a bid for the post of secretary-general against Manuel Alegre and João Soares, winning the vote of nearly 80% of party members on 24 September 2004. After the victory of his party in the 2005 legislative election, Sócrates was called on 24 February by President Jorge Sampaio to form a new government – the XVII Constitutional Government. After the 2009 legislative election, held on 27 September 2009, José Sócrates was elected for a second term as prime minister of Portugal. He was also a Member of the Portuguese Council of State as the prime minister.

===Personal life===

==== Family and residence ====
Sócrates is divorced from Sofia Costa Pinto Fava, an engineer, with whom he has two sons, José Miguel Fava Pinto de Sousa (b. 1993) and Eduardo Fava Pinto de Sousa (b. 1995). Sofia is a daughter of José Manuel Carvalho Fava, an architect, and Clotilde Mesquita (daughter of Armando Mesquita and Palmira da Costa Pinto), engineer and sister of Alexandre Mesquita Carvalho Fava and Mara Mesquita Carvalho Fava. 

Sócrates lives in Lisbon, although he used to be a registered elector of the municipality of Covilhã, the place where he voted until the law was changed (since after the mid-2000s every person votes in one&#x27;s residential area). Since late 2018, he has been living in Ericeira.

====Health and well-being====
José Sócrates had photos of himself taken during his morning jog at places like the Red Square in Moscow, Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s Copacabana, Luanda, and Lisbon. In January 2008, a smoking ban came into force in Portugal&#x27;s public buildings and on public transport, but Sócrates was reported to have been smoking in May during a private state flight to Venezuela where he met Hugo Chávez. He has since admitted it was a mistake, apologized and promised to quit smoking. In addition, he claimed he was not aware he was breaking the law when he did so. However, by 2012, after he had left the spotlight, the Portuguese newspaper &quot;Diário de Notícias&quot; reported he was no longer a non-smoker.

==== Fandom ====

He is a supporter of SL Benfica.

==Prime minister of Portugal==
After the Portuguese legislative election of 2005, Sócrates was called on 24 February by President Jorge Sampaio to form a new government. Sócrates and his first government – the XVII Constitutional Government – took office on 12 March 2005.

After the Portuguese legislative election of 2009, held on 27 September 2009, José Sócrates was elected for a second term as prime minister of Portugal. The new government was sworn into office on 26 October 2009.

On 5 June 2011, after the 2011 legislative election, the Social Democratic Party led by Pedro Passos Coelho won, forcing Sócrates&#x27; resignation as Secretary-General of the Socialist Party and as prime minister of Portugal.

===José Sócrates&#x27; cabinet===
Sócrates headed the government beginning on 12 March 2005, comprising the XVII and XVIII &quot;Governos Constitucionais&quot; (17th and 18th Constitutional Governments).

====Membership====
====Major policies====

=====Administrative reforms=====
The XVII &quot;Governo Constitucional&quot; government, headed by Prime Minister José Sócrates, tried to create new rules and implement reforms aiming at better efficiency and rationalized resource allocation in the public sector, fighting civil servant overcapacity (&quot;excedentários&quot;) and reducing bureaucracy for both citizens and companies (e.g.: &quot;empresa na hora&quot;, &quot;PRACE – Programa de Reestruturação da Administração Central do Estado&quot;, and SIMPLEX – Programa de Simplificação Administrativa e Legislativa), among others. Since the XVII &quot;Governo Constitucional&quot; government (with José Sócrates as prime minister and Teixeira dos Santos as minister of finance) Portugal&#x27;s fiscal policy improved with a steady increase of the number of taxpayers and the growth of the receipt amount from State taxation. However these policies had little effect, and the country&#x27;s public debt and deficit were both out of control by 2010, along with a record high unemployment rate. João Bilhim directed in 2005 the committee responsible for the Programme for Restructuring the State&#x27;s Central Administration (PRACE) but was said to be disappointed with the results. Several reforms and measures implemented in 2006/2007 by the government (XVII &quot;Governo Constitucional&quot; – headed by Prime Minister José Sócrates), resulted in improved welfare system financial sustainability but reduced income expectations of future pensioners up to 40%. In addition, economically active people must work for more years before retirement than formerly. A sustainability factor was also introduced, giving employees the option of working longer or receiving slightly lower pensions, as life expectancy forecasts increase. After the Portuguese regionalization referendum of 1998 where the &quot;No&quot; to regionalization of the mainland into eight administrative regions was victorious, the XVII &quot;Governo Constitucional&quot; government announced in January 2009 its firm intention of starting again a regionalization process for Portugal. According to this governmental project, mainland Portugal was to be regionalized into five regions with a wide range of administrative autonomy, using the already established NUTS II system: Alentejo, Algarve, Lisbon and Tagus Valley, Central Portugal and Northern Portugal. The transformation of the Portuguese public administration from a traditional one to an information technology-based multiplatform service, was praised by the European Commission through its European Union benchmark for the sector, that consecutively placed Portugal in the first position of the ranking in 2009 and 2010.

=====Technological plan=====

One of the government&#x27;s main policies was the &quot;Plano Tecnológico&quot; (Technological Plan), aimed at increasing Portugal&#x27;s competitivity through the modernization of its economy. The plan consisted of three key areas: knowledge, technology and innovation. A low-cost Intel-based netbook for use by children announced by Sócrates&#x27;s government cabinet, named &quot;Magalhães&quot; (after Fernão de Magalhães) and packaged and assembled for the Portuguese school-age children and the low-to-middle income economy export market by the Portuguese company J.P. Sá Couto, headquartered in Matosinhos, Norte region, was among the government&#x27;s innovations under the Technological Plan. Governmental efforts in the technological domain also included state support of a Portuguese factory that was owned by the German-based semiconductor company Qimonda AG, in Vila do Conde, Norte region, when the parent company filed a bankruptcy petition with the local court in Munich, Germany, in early 2009. Qimonda Portugal was at the time one of the top Portuguese net exporters.

The European Innovation Scoreboard of 2010 placed Portugal-based innovation in 15th position, as a result of an impressive increase in innovation expenditure and output.

=====Educational reforms=====
The government allocated more resources for education policy and reorganised the sector aiming more choice and better quality in professional technical education. Enhanced and improved professional technical education programs were implemented in 2007 in an effort to revitalize this sector which had been almost discontinued after the Carnation Revolution of 1974. Other education reforms included more financial support for students (in all educational levels), systematic teaching and school evaluation, the compulsory closing of some problematic and unreliable private higher education institutions (like the Independente University and Moderna University) by the Minister for Science, Technology and Higher Education, Mariano Gago, and a will to rank and benchmark the higher education institutions through a newly created state-run agency (the &quot;Agência de Acreditação e Avaliação do Ensino Superior&quot;). During the XVII &quot;Governo Constitucional&quot;, the pan-European Bologna Process was fully implemented in Portugal.

On the other hand, the government created a policy of certification and equivalence of qualifications for adult people with low levels of formal education who want a 4th, 6th, 9th or 12th grade equivalence without returning to school (for example, through this process, called &quot;Novas Oportunidades&quot;, adults—18 years old and older—with the 9th grade might be granted an equivalence to the 12th grade after a process ranging from a part-time 3-month programme or a 1-day-per-week 8-month programme; those who have less than 9th grade have a similar programme to get the 9th grade certification and can then apply to the 12th grade programme). The curricula do not include any classical high school discipline or a traditional examination process. These diplomas are awarded based on vaguely construed life experience. Some critics alleged this policy was an effort to make up the poor national statistical indicators on education, with little impact on the quality of the work force&#x27;s qualification of Portugal in the European Union context.

According to the OECD&#x27;s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), the average Portuguese 15-year-old student was for many years underrated and underachieving in terms of reading literacy, mathematics and science knowledge in the OECD, nearly tied with the Italian and just above those from countries like Greece, Turkey and Mexico. However, since 2010, PISA results for Portuguese students improved dramatically. The PISA 2009 report states that the average Portuguese 15-year-old student, when rated in terms of reading literacy, mathematics and science knowledge, is placed at the same level as those students from the United States, Sweden, Germany, Ireland, France, Denmark, United Kingdom, Hungary and Taipei, with 489 points (493 is the average). However, a couple of weeks later, the Portuguese Ministry of Education announced a 2010 report published by its office for educational evaluation GAVE (Gabinete de Avaliação do Ministério da Educação) which criticized the results of PISA 2009 report and claimed that the average Portuguese teenage student had profound handicaps in terms of expression, communication and logic, as well as a low performance when asked to solve problems.

=====Transportation developments=====
Prime Minister José Sócrates and his government team supported the decision of building new transportation infrastructure such as a new airport for Lisbon and a high speed rail network. For months the government of Prime Minister José Sócrates insisted the country&#x27;s only option for a new airport was in the Ota region north of Lisbon. But a powerful lobby, headed by local business honchos and given the imprimatur of the Portuguese president Aníbal Cavaco Silva, forced Sócrates&#x27;s Government into reversal, by bringing an alternative site for the new airport – the Portuguese Air Force&#x27;s shooting range in Alcochete east of Lisbon. A study commissioned by a group of businesspeople said the Alcochete site would save taxpayers as much as €3bn in construction costs, and would have less of an environmental impact. The government argued that Ota was a key piece of its overall transport strategy, which included highspeed rail lines to Spain, but even so recognized that the project wasn&#x27;t finalized and that a debate on the pros and cons of both sites would be worthwhile. Then the government commissioned a technical study to the state-run civil engineering laboratory () comparing both locations one to each other. Following the conclusions of that study, on 10 January 2008 Prime Minister José Sócrates announced the option Alcochete as the most rational choice for a new airport for Lisbon.

=====Other=====
In 2007, the XVII &quot;Governo Constitucional&quot;, headed by Prime Minister José Sócrates, legalised abortion in Portugal after a referendum. Voters were being asked to decide whether to make abortion legal in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy, if carried out at the woman&#x27;s request in a registered clinic. Despite the turnout for a referendum being too low (40%; 50% needed) to be legally binding, José Sócrates said: &quot;Our interest is to fight clandestine abortion and we have to produce a law that respects the result of the referendum.&quot; This socialist government cabinet also announced its intention to legalize same-sex marriage at some point during its mandate. Same-sex marriage in Portugal was legalized on 17 May 2010.

Also, in 2009, through the Decree-Law 91/2009, the rights of fathers and mothers were equalled under the law (see also Fathers&#x27; rights).

After a sharp increase of the violent crime rate in Portugal during the XVII &quot;Governo Constitucional&quot; government (2005–2009), the minister of internal administration, Rui Pereira, announced in February 2009 the expansion of the police force through the recruitment of 2,000 new police officers, 7,000 new state-of-the-art police weapons, 1,000 bulletproof vests, among other measures.

Until 2010, for stock held for more than twelve months the capital gain was exempt. The capital gain of stock held for shorter periods of time was taxable on 10%. From 2010 onwards, for residents, all capital gain of stock and other assets above €500 is taxable on 20%. Investment funds, banks and corporations are in general exempted of capital gain tax over stock.

====Presidency of the Council of the European Union====

José Sócrates, as prime minister of Portugal, presided over the rotative presidency of the Council of the European Union for the period July–December 2007. In this post, Sócrates and his team focused on the EU-Brazil (1st EU-Brazil summit) and EU-African Union (2007 Africa-EU Summit) relations, as well as in the approval of the Treaty of Lisbon. The Portuguese Parliament voted to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon on 23 April 2008. After the Irish referendum on 12 June 2008, Prime Minister José Sócrates said he saw the Irish &quot;No&quot; to the treaty as a &quot;personal defeat&quot; after it was signed by EU leaders in the Portuguese capital. A second referendum was held in Ireland in 2009, and the outcome was the approval of the Treaty of Lisbon by all EU member states, including Ireland.

====Economic crisis====

From 2005 to 2010, José Sócrates&#x27; cabinet faced increasing challenges due to economic and financial downturn. Portuguese economy was in crisis since 2002 owing to stagnation and high unemployment; in the late 2000s, Europe&#x27;s sovereign debt crisis led to huge deficits and even higher rampant unemployment in Portugal. International financial markets compelled the Portuguese Government, like other European governments, to make radical changes in economic policy. Thus in September 2010, the Portuguese Government announced a fresh austerity package following other Eurozone partners, aiming to halve its budget deficit by 2011 with a series of tax hikes and salary cuts for public servants. In 2009, the deficit had been 9.4%, one of the highest in the Eurozone and way above the European Union&#x27;s Stability and Growth Pact 3% limit. The Portuguese Government earlier targeted a 2011 shortfall of 5.1% but a growing crisis sparked by chronic budget expenditure, massive debt and deficit problems, forced Portugal to take even more difficult measures. In September, pressure from the International Monetary Fund, Ecofin, OECD and the main opposition party, forced Sócrates&#x27; cabinet to adopt successive packages of radical austerity measures, contrary to what had been promised during the previous electoral campaigns.
A report published in January 2011 by the &quot;Diário de Notícias&quot;, a leading Portuguese newspaper, demonstrated that in the period between the Carnation Revolution in 1974 and 2010, the democratic Portuguese Republic governments have encouraged over expenditure and investment bubbles through unclear public-private partnerships. This has funded numerous ineffective and unnecessary external consultancy and advising committees and firms, allowed considerable slippage in state-managed public works, inflated top management and head officers&#x27; bonuses and wages, causing a persistent and lasting recruitment policy that has boosted the number of unnecessary public servants. The economy has also been damaged by risky credit, public debt creation and mismanaged European structural and cohesion funds for almost four decades. Apparently, the Prime Minister Sócrates&#x27;s cabinet was not able to forecast or prevent any of this when symptoms first appeared in 2005, and later was incapable of doing anything to ameliorate the situation when the country was on the verge of bankruptcy in 2011.

On 6 April 2011, having already resigned as prime minister, Sócrates went on television to announce that Portugal, facing bankruptcy, would request financial assistance from the IMF (at the time managed by Dominique Strauss-Kahn) and the European Financial Stability Facility, as Greece and the Republic of Ireland had already done. The announcement was made 48 hours after Sócrates had categorically denied the move would be needed.

====Fall of government====
On 23 March 2011, Sócrates resigned following passage of a no confidence motion sponsored by all five opposition parties in parliament over spending cuts and tax increases. Before the vote, Sócrates had stated that he would resign if the vote for further austerity measures didn&#x27;t pass. As a result, a general election was held on 5 June 2011.

The Portuguese government fell a day before an EU summit was due to take place to finalise the EU&#x27;s response to countries requiring a bailout in the future.

After losing the Portuguese legislative election of 2011, held on 5 June 2011, he resigned from Secretary-General of the Socialist Party.

==Controversies==

===Sócrates–Independente affair===
In March 2007, &quot;Universidade Independente&quot; (UnI), a private university in Lisbon, was placed under investigation for alleged irregularities on several matters.

In that same month, Sócrates&#x27; &quot;licenciatura&quot; degree in civil engineering by &quot;Universidade Independente&quot; was put under enormous public scrutiny. Journalists found that qualifications awarded did not follow procedure and that four of the five academic disciplines were given in the private university by the same professor, António José Moraes, a socialist government appointee. A fifth academic discipline, &quot;technical English&quot; was given by the Independente&#x27;s rector. A strong case was built up related to possible false declarations by José Sócrates regarding his university degree, and the way he was awarded this degree in civil engineering. Among other issues, the Independente degree in civil engineering was not an accredited degree, a civil engineering department was not yet established at that university, one examination was sent by fax and Sócrates&#x27; diploma was issued on a Sunday, a day on which the university was always closed.

Some Portuguese news media professionals stated that Sócrates or members of his staff, through phone calls, threatened court action against journalists and tried to stop the reportings on his &quot;licenciatura&quot; degree awarded by UnI. On 9 April 2007, &quot;Universidade Independente&quot; was closed by government officials after an investigation reported several serious irregularities in the running of this private university.

Under heavy pressure, Sócrates provided his version of the facts on Wednesday 11 April 2007 in a live broadcast interview for the RTP 1 TV channel and RDP radio. The prime minister stated he was not favoured by the &quot;Universidade Independente&quot; to obtain the degree, declared he had been the target of &quot;catty accusations&quot;, and defended the authenticity of the degree, though admitting he is not a fully chartered civil engineer. In his official biography at the Portuguese Government&#x27;s official website Sócrates claimed to have already obtained the qualification of engineer. He later admitted that this was a &quot;lapse&quot;, and the government website altered his CV, downgrading &quot;civil engineer&quot; to &quot;diploma in civil engineering&quot;. In the interest of accuracy, he should have used &quot;&quot;licenciado em engenharia civil&quot; instead of &quot;engenheiro&quot;&quot;. Before he had been granted the degree, he presented himself as an &quot;engineer&quot; when he was solely a &quot;technical engineer&quot;. Portuguese Parliament documents with official information on Sócrates personal data were found, proving such inconsistencies. Sócrates and his staff replied to this by stating that it was probably a misunderstanding in the parliamentary services. After having the &quot;licenciatura&quot; diploma he used the title &quot;engineer&quot; in several official documents, despite the fact that his unaccredited degree in civil engineering from &quot;Universidade Independente&quot; was not legally recognized to allow for the use of the title &quot;engineer&quot;; a profession which is regulated in Portugal by the &quot;Ordem dos Engenheiros&quot;.

José Sócrates was fiercely criticised by members of Portugal&#x27;s democratic opposition in the Parliament regarding both proved and unproven issues related with this controversy. Nicolau Santos, a television journalist and a director of &quot;Expresso&quot; newspaper, criticised the controversial series of fait-divers published in &quot;Público&quot; and claimed that despite the extensive coverage of details, Público&#x27;s investigation lead to &quot;no definitive conclusion&quot; and might be connected with other issues. In the same tone, several other media personalities, like SIC Notícias&#x27; journalist Ricardo Costa, also suggested controversially that SONAE corporation, the parent company of Público newspaper, was behind the beginning of the controversy due to a failed takeover bid of SONAE&#x27;s telecommunications operator over the largest Portuguese telecom – Portugal Telecom. The complexity of the takeover bid involving the largest Portuguese telecom, prompted State intervention by the &quot;Autoridade da Concorrência&quot; (The Portuguese Competition Authority).

It was found that a close friend of Sócrates, Armando Vara, was also awarded a diploma by the &quot;Universidade Independente&quot; days before he was appointed to a high ranking banking administration position in the state-run Caixa Geral de Depósitos, which in turn was strictly opened to candidates holding at last one academic degree in any subject.

====Investigation====
State authorities investigated the affair and archived the file on the grounds that the suspicions of falsification and irregularities allegedly attributed to José Sócrates turned out to be formally impossible to prove. On the other hand, the &quot;Universidade Independente&quot; was investigated by education state authorities, which resulted in the compulsory closing of that private university in October 2007, due to lack of academic rigour and teaching quality, along with generalized managerial and financial chaos in the institution.

===&quot;Magalhães&quot; computer===
A low-cost Intel Classmate PC-based netbook for use by children, announced and sponsored by Sócrates&#x27; cabinet, named &quot;Magalhães&quot; (after Fernão de Magalhães), assembled by the Portuguese company J.P. Sá Couto, was at the centre of a controversy on 7 October 2008, when the company was suspected of €5 million worth of tax evasion. J.P. Sá Couto dismissed all the accusations regarding alleged fiscal fraud within the company. Other major controversy regarding &quot;Magalhães&quot; computer were the legal issues about public contracting procedure in the agreement involving the Government and the company J.P. Sá Couto. The case led to an investigation that raised other similar issues involving other governmental agreements and public contracts.

===Freeport outlet controversy===
Since 2005, and, especially again in 2009, it was suggested by some Portuguese and British media that José Sócrates allegedly waived environmental restrictions, following intervention by one of his uncles and a cousin, to grant the British company Freeport a licence to build the Alcochete mall, a gigantic emporium near the Tagus river, developed in part on protected land outside Lisbon in 2002, when he was Minister for Environment of the PM António Guterres&#x27; cabinet.
Portuguese authorities have meanwhile insisted José Sócrates was not under investigation, nor was he a suspect, while UK&#x27;s Serious Fraud Office refused to confirm the veracity of reports emanating in Portugal. José Sócrates also stated the Freeport project was in due compliance with all legal requirements at the time. Júlio Eduardo Coelho Monteiro, a businessman who is an uncle of José Sócrates, told the Portuguese newspaper Sol how he established contact between his nephew and Freeport&#x27;s representatives.

In a DVD held by the British police and released in March 2009 by the Portuguese media, Charles Smith, a consultant hired to handle the licensing of the Freeport of Alcochete, clearly stated that José Sócrates &quot;was corrupt&quot; and that he received, through a cousin, money to give the green light to the project for the &quot;outlet&quot;. The recording revealed by TVI is only part of a conversation of 20 minutes that alongside Charles Smith also included John Cabral, an official of the consultant, and Alan Perkins, director of Freeport. It was the latter who, without knowledge of the other two, has recorded the event, where Smith and Cabral were questioned about the money that left the company to be used for the payment of &quot;gloves&quot; to the current prime minister. Charles Smith is one of two defendants in the case Freeport, commercial space on the process of Freeport Alcochete, related to alleged suspicions of corruption in the amendment to the Special Protection Area of the Tagus estuary (ZPET) decided three days before the elections of 2002, through a decree-law, when José Sócrates was Minister of Environment.

The conversation now revealed took place in 2006 with the aim of explaining the large outgoing amounts of money from the company&#x27;s headquarters in London at the time of approval of the project. According to some sources contacted in London by TVI, José Sócrates remains the main suspect of British police. The British police are now set to send to the Portuguese authorities the 25 volumes of all research done in this process in England. The Serious Fraud Office, which investigates major financial fraud in Britain, has seen its activity limited due to the lack of cooperation of the Portuguese authorities in investigating the case. The first official meeting took place only on 17 November 2008 in The Hague, the headquarters of Eurojust, a body which is designed to facilitate judicial cooperation in the EU. Judge Cândida Almeida, director of DCIAP (Central Department for investigation and prosecution), which coordinates the department&#x27;s prosecutor who investigates the case, refused a joint research proposal by the English. Then she became aware of the DVD. The prosecutor dropped the evidence, arguing that it did not comply with Portuguese law.

The Eurojust tried to distance itself from the scandal involving its head, José da Mota, a Portuguese, who allegedly put pressure on prosecutors in order to stop a corruption probe involving Portuguese Prime Minister José Sócrates. Two magistrates dealing with the so-called Freeport affair accused José Mota of having tried to persuade them to side-line the investigation at the request of the Portuguese premier and the minister of justice. The premier and Mr Mota&#x27;s relationship goes back to the late nineties, when they worked in the same government as state secretaries for environment and justice respectively. In 2002, when the new EU body was formed (Eurojust), Mr Mota was transferred to The Hague as Portugal&#x27;s representative to Eurojust. He was elected head of the judicial co-operation body in 2007, at a time when the so-called Freeport case had already started in Portugal.

On 22 May 2012, Alan Perkins, a Freeport manager between 2005 and 2006, said, under oath in court, that illegal payments had been made to the minister of the Environment. At the time, the minister of the Environment was José Sócrates.

===&quot;Face Oculta&quot; scandal===

Another corruption case involving Sócrates was the &quot;Face Oculta&quot; scandal. On 28 October 2009 the police began investigating a business group headquartered in Ovar. Armando Vara, one of the suspects, was reported to have had &quot;talks&quot; with Sócrates. Sócrates denied any involvement, claiming that he was only talking to a friend.

In February 2011 the company TMN, that belongs to Portugal Telecom, claimed that, because of an informatics-related problem, all the information and data about the case and related to Armando Vara (ex-vice-president of BCP), Rui Pedro Soares (ex-manager of PT), Mário Lino (ex-minister) and Paulo Penedos (ex-assistant of PT) had disappeared. David Dinis, editor of the &quot;Diário de Notícias&quot; newspaper, quit his job because of pressure from the director, João Marcelino, to stop this information being spread by the press.

Sócrates was not indicted as part of the &quot;Face Oculta&quot; probe, but investigation of corruption charges continued under &quot;Operation Marquis&quot;.

===Corruption investigation===
In November 2014, José Sócrates was arrested on suspicions of corruption and money-laundering, having come to light that a close friend was holding millions of euros for his benefit. Sócrates claimed that he merely borrowed money from his friend, but there were no records of the amounts loaned, which admittedly funded a luxurious lifestyle in Paris after Sócrates left the government. This came to light during the government&#x27;s &quot;Operation Marquis&quot; investigation. He was originally held pending the conclusion of this investigation. Sócrates was imprisoned in the jail at Évora until September 2015 when he was remanded to house arrest at a relative&#x27;s house in Lisbon. He was freed from house arrest in October 2015, but was constrained to remain in Portugal and prohibited from contacting other suspects in the case, pending completion of the investigation. In 2017, Sócrates was formally indicted on corruption charges including bribery, money laundering and tax fraud.

The charges of document forgery, tax evasion, money laundering and misuse of political office were based upon three transactions:
* Sonae&#x27;s takeover black knight bid for Portugal Telecom and the subsequent white knight takeover defense through a proposed merger with Brazilian telecom operator Oi involving Portugal Telecom&#x27;s CEO Zeinal Bava,
* the Vale do Lobo expansion project, and 
* the development of a high-speed railway line.

On 9 April 2021, a Portuguese judge dismissed the corruption charges against Sócrates, upholding lesser charges of money laundering and falsifying documents.

<text>The Salar Jung Museum is an art museum located at Dar-ul-Shifa, on the southern bank of the Musi River in the city of Hyderabad, Telangana, India. It is one of the notable National Museums of India. Originally a private art collection of the Salar Jung family, it was endowed to the nation after the death of Salar Jung III. It was inaugurated on 16 December 1951.

It has a collection of sculptures, paintings, carvings, textiles, manuscripts, ceramics, metallic artefacts, carpets, clocks, and furniture from Japan, China, Burma, Nepal, India, Persia, Egypt, Europe, and North America. It is one of the largest museums in the world.

== History ==
A nobleman of the Salar Jung family of Hyderabad, Nawab Mir Yousuf Ali Khan, Salar Jung III (1889–1949) served as Prime Minister of Hyderabad during the Nizam&#x27;s rule in Hyderabad state. He spent a substantial amount of his income, over a period of thirty-five years, collecting artefacts from all across the world.

After the Nawab died in 1949, the collections were left behind in his ancestral palace Diwan Devdi. The collection was formerly exhibited there as a private museum, named Salar Jung Museum, which was inaugurated by Jawaharlal Nehru on 16 December 1951.

Old timers believe that the present collection constitutes only half of the original art wealth collected by the Nawab. His employees siphoned off part of it, since the Nawab depended upon his staff to keep a vigil.

The state decided to shift the museum to a new building and after a design competition, Mohammed Fayazuddin was selected as the architect of the new building.

The foundation stone was laid by Jawaharlal Nehru in 1963, and in 1968, the museum shifted to its present location at Dar-ul-Shifa, and is administered by a board of trustees with the governor of Telangana as &quot;ex officio&quot; chairperson under the Salar Jung Museum Act of 1961. Some more art pieces were lost or stolen during the shifting of the museum from Dewan Devdi to the present site.

In 2003, the museum signed a memorandum of understanding with the National Mission for Manuscripts, and was declared a manuscript conservation centre.

In 2006, a fire broke out in an auditorium in the museum premises. However, it was quickly extinguished and none of the artefacts were damaged. After the incident, fire safety facilities were upgraded.

== Collections ==
Collection at the Salar Jung Museum can be broadly classified into Indian Art, Middle Eastern Art, Far Eastern Art, European Art and Children&#x27;s Section. Other than this a founder gallery is created which is dedicated to Salar Jung Family.

=== Indian Art ===
Indian Collection can be categorised into following galleries Indian Bronze, Indian Textile, Indian Sculpture, Minor arts of South India, Miniature Paintings, Ivory Carvings arms and armour, Metal Ware and Jade Carving.

==== Indian Miniature Painting ====
The history of miniature painting can be traced to 14th century. Before the invention of paper, the art was practised on cloth or certain kinds of leaves. The museum houses manuscripts on leaves from 15th- and 16th-century Gujrat. It holds a range of miniature paintings from Mughal, Rajasthani, Thanjavur, Malwa and Deccan schools. Notable works of miniature painting are:
* &quot;The Birth of the Prince&quot;, which captures the spirit of a significant event and depicts both Persian and Indian influence
* From the Mughal school, showing European influence is &quot;Madonna with Child&quot;, from the 16th century
* An important painting from the Mughal school of the 17th century is &quot;Prince with a Hawk&quot;. This is among the earliest of Mughal artistic works that depict facial features of Persians
* A Mughal miniature painting which shows the style in full bloom is &quot;King with Nobles&quot;

The Deccan school with centres at Golconda, Bijapur, Bidar, Gulbarga and Ahmednagar, also produced some fine pieces of miniature painting which were strongly influenced by Mughal and Persian miniature-painting styles. Some noteworthy examples of both paintings and manuscripts in the museum: &quot;Bhog Bal&quot;, dated from 16th century, is one of the most prominent of the manuscripts; a painting showing Jamshed Quli and Ibrahim Quli in conversation is a good example of Golconda School; an interesting painting from Bijapur School is &quot;Elephants in a Fight&quot;. There are several paintings of Yoginis and from Ragamala.

==== Modern Painting ====
Salar Jung III hand acquired few Modern Paintings but majority of the paintings in collection were collected by the museum in 1962. In India Ravi Verma was the pioneer of the Modern School, he worked with oil medium depicting Indian mythology and classic themes. The museum has two of his works, &quot;Stolen Interview&quot; and &quot;The Kerela Beauty&quot;. Other masters of the Modern School whose works are presented in the museum are Varma and Abdur Rahman Chughtai, M. F. Husain, K.K. Hebbar, Rabindranath Tagore, Abanidranath Tagore Chugtai and Nandalal Bose

==== Ivory Carving ====

The Museum contains important examples of ivory carvings in different forms, such as furniture, mats, lamps, handles of daggers, chess and chausars. The chessman and chausar are interesting elements, the pawns being depicted as soldiers, while the king and queen are riding on elephants. These painted pieces belong to North India.

The most notable element is the ivory carved chair gifted to Tipu Sultan by Louis XVI. The backrest of the chair is a fine lattice pattern and the armrest is carved as a lion head. Ivory lamp also deserves a special mention owing to its intricate craftsmanship and is the only ivory carving example from Mysore.

The &quot;Founder&#x27;s Gallery&quot; houses portraits of Salar Jung III, as well as other members of the Salar Jung family.

The Indian block includes jade-crafted daggers of Jahangir, Nur Jahan and Shah Jahan; and weapons belonging to Aurangzeb, Tipu Sultan, Muhammad Shah, Bahadur Shah and Abul Hasan Qutb Shah.

Indian sculptures from the Gandhara and Chola periods are also displayed.

==== Jade Collection ====

Salarjung Museum&#x27;s Jade Collection is one of the largest collection of jade displayed for public in India. The collection as per a publication from 1979 of Salar Jung Museum suggests that there were 984 objects with varying degree of craftsmanship. Most of the artefacts are from the Mughal Empire and some from the Asaf Jah Dynasty.
=== Western ===

In 1876, on a trip to France the unique &quot;double sculpture&quot;, &quot;Mephistopheles and Margaretta&quot; was acquired by Salar Jung I. He also traveled to Rome, where he purchased a marble statue called &quot;Veiled Rebecca&quot;. The Salar Jung family had a history of collecting art, and eventually the collections of Salar Jung I, II and III all ended up in the Salar Jung Museum.

European art from British, French and Italian artists are displayed. Among works on show are some by the notable artists Canaletto, William-Adolphe Bouguereau and Francesco Hayez. The furniture collection includes pieces from the time of King Louis XIV and Napoleon. Salar Jung III collected about 43,000 artefacts and 50,000 books and manuscripts out of which only few are displayed in today&#x27;s museum.

=== Eastern ===
The Eastern block houses Japanese artworks, porcelain pieces, samurai swords and sculptures from China, Japan, Tibet and Burma.

=== Quran collections ===
The museum has a famous Quran collection, from around the world in different fonts and designs, called the Quran Written with Gold and Silver. There are many more collections of religious books, as well as Arabic Quran.

=== Clocks ===
A variety and array of clocks are in the clock room. There are ancient sundials in the form of obelisks to huge and modern clocks of the twentieth century. Others in the range vary from miniature clocks which need a magnifying glass to view closely, to stately grandfather clocks from place such as France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Britain, including the musical clock Salar Jung bought from Cook and Kelvey of England.

The variety of clocks includes the bird cage clocks, bracket clocks, grandfather clocks, skeleton clocks, etc. The museum also has examples of the clocks of the contemporary period of Louis XV, Louis XVI, and Napoleon 1st of France.

The Indian Parliament has declared the museum an Institution of National Importance.

=== Coins ===
There is a collection of about 600 coins the from VijayNagar dynasty to Bahmani empire, Moghul empire and Modern India. A few coins are 2300 years old. Some Punch Mark coins from Kushan dynasty are also preserved. The coins are made of silver, copper, lead.

== Facilities ==
The museum building, semicircular in shape with 38 galleries, spread on two floors, displays only a part of the original collection. The ground floor has 20 galleries and the first floor has 18 galleries. The exhibits on different subjects are displayed in separate galleries. Each gallery is huge and has many artefacts on display including ones dating back to the 4th century. There are plans for a new Islamic Gallery, where Islamic artefacts and manuscripts of the Qur&#x27;an will be displayed.

Apart from the galleries, there is a reference library, reading room, publication and education section, chemical conservation lab, sales counter, cafeteria etc.

<text>In universal algebra, a variety of algebras or equational class is the class of all algebraic structures of a given signature satisfying a given set of identities. For example, the groups form a variety of algebras, as do the abelian groups, the rings, the monoids etc. According to Birkhoff&#x27;s theorem, a class of algebraic structures of the same signature is a variety if and only if it is closed under the taking of homomorphic images, subalgebras, and (direct) products. In the context of category theory, a variety of algebras, together with its homomorphisms, forms a category; these are usually called &quot;finitary algebraic categories&quot;.

A &quot;covariety&quot; is the class of all coalgebraic structures of a given signature.

== Terminology ==
A variety of algebras should not be confused with an algebraic variety, which means a set of solutions to a system of polynomial equations. They are formally quite distinct and their theories have little in common.

The term &quot;variety of algebras&quot; refers to algebras in the general sense of universal algebra; there is also a more specific sense of algebra, namely as algebra over a field, i.e. a vector space equipped with a bilinear multiplication.

== Definition ==

A &quot;signature&quot; (in this context) is a set, whose elements are called &quot;operations&quot;, each of which is assigned a natural number (0, 1, 2, ...) called its &quot;arity&quot;. Given a signature &quot;σ&quot; and a set &quot;V&quot;, whose elements are called &quot;variables&quot;, a &quot;word&quot; is a finite rooted tree in which each node is labelled by either a variable or an operation, such that every node labelled by a variable has no branches away from the root and every node labelled by an operation &quot;o&quot; has as many branches away from the root as the arity of &quot;o&quot;. An &quot;equational law&quot; is a pair of such words; the axiom consisting of the words &quot;v&quot; and &quot;w&quot; is written as .

A &quot;theory&quot; consists of a signature, a set of variables, and a set of equational laws. Any theory gives a variety of algebras as follows. Given a theory &quot;T&quot;, an &quot;algebra&quot; of &quot;T&quot; consists of a set &quot;A&quot; together with, for each operation &quot;o&quot; of &quot;T&quot; with arity &quot;n&quot;, a function such that for each axiom and each assignment of elements of &quot;A&quot; to the variables in that axiom, the equation holds that is given by applying the operations to the elements of &quot;A&quot; as indicated by the trees defining &quot;v&quot; and &quot;w&quot;. The class of algebras of a given theory &quot;T&quot; is called a &quot;variety of algebras&quot;.

Given two algebras of a theory &quot;T&quot;, say &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, a &quot;homomorphism&quot; is a function such that
: formula_1
for every operation &quot;o&quot; of arity &quot;n&quot;. Any theory gives a category where the objects are algebras of that theory and the morphisms are homomorphisms.

== Examples ==
The class of all semigroups forms a variety of algebras of signature (2), meaning that a semigroup has a single binary operation. A sufficient defining equation is the associative law:
: formula_2

The class of groups forms a variety of algebras of signature (2,0,1), the three operations being respectively &quot;multiplication&quot; (binary), &quot;identity&quot; (nullary, a constant) and &quot;inversion&quot; (unary). The familiar axioms of associativity, identity and inverse form one suitable set of identities:
: formula_3
: formula_4
: formula_5

The class of rings also forms a variety of algebras. The signature here is (2,2,0,0,1) (two binary operations, two constants, and one unary operation).

If we fix a specific ring &quot;R&quot;, we can consider the class of left &quot;R&quot;-modules. To express the scalar multiplication with elements from &quot;R&quot;, we need one unary operation for each element of &quot;R&quot;. If the ring is infinite, we will thus have infinitely many operations, which is allowed by the definition of an algebraic structure in universal algebra. We will then also need infinitely many identities to express the module axioms, which is allowed by the definition of a variety of algebras. So the left &quot;R&quot;-modules do form a variety of algebras.

The fields do &quot;not&quot; form a variety of algebras; the requirement that all non-zero elements be invertible cannot be expressed as a universally satisfied identity (see below).

The cancellative semigroups also do not form a variety of algebras, since the cancellation property is not an equation, it is an implication that is not equivalent to any set of equations. However, they do form a quasivariety as the implication defining the cancellation property is an example of a quasi-identity.

== Birkhoff&#x27;s variety theorem ==

Given a class of algebraic structures of the same signature, we can define the notions of homomorphism, subalgebra, and product. Garrett Birkhoff proved that a class of algebraic structures of the same signature is a variety if and only if it is closed under the taking of homomorphic images, subalgebras and arbitrary products. This is a result of fundamental importance to universal algebra and known as &quot;Birkhoff&#x27;s variety theorem&quot; or as the &quot;HSP theorem&quot;. &quot;H&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, and &quot;P&quot; stand, respectively, for the operations of homomorphism, subalgebra, and product.

One direction of the equivalence mentioned above, namely that a class of algebras satisfying some set of identities must be closed under the HSP operations, follows immediately from the definitions. Proving the converse—classes of algebras closed under the HSP operations must be equational—is more difficult.

Using the easy direction of Birkhoff&#x27;s theorem, we can for example verify the claim made above, that the field axioms are not expressible by any possible set of identities: the product of fields is not a field, so fields do not form a variety.

== Subvarieties ==
A &quot;subvariety&quot; of a variety of algebras &quot;V&quot; is a subclass of &quot;V&quot; that has the same signature as &quot;V&quot; and is itself a variety, i.e., is defined by a set of identities.

Notice that although every group becomes a semigroup when the identity as a constant is omitted (and/or the inverse operation is omitted), the class of groups does &quot;not&quot; form a subvariety of the variety of semigroups because the signatures are different.
Similarly, the class of semigroups that are groups is not a subvariety of the variety of semigroups. The class of monoids that are groups contains formula_6 and does not contain its subalgebra (more precisely, submonoid) formula_7.

However, the class of abelian groups is a subvariety of the variety of groups because it consists of those groups satisfying , with no change of signature. The finitely generated abelian groups do not form a subvariety, since by Birkhoff&#x27;s theorem they don&#x27;t form a variety, as an arbitrary product of finitely generated abelian groups is not finitely generated.

Viewing a variety &quot;V&quot; and its homomorphisms as a category, a subvariety &quot;U&quot; of &quot;V&quot; is a full subcategory of &quot;V&quot;, meaning that for any objects &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; in &quot;U&quot;, the homomorphisms from &quot;a&quot; to &quot;b&quot; in &quot;U&quot; are exactly those from &quot;a&quot; to &quot;b&quot; in &quot;V&quot;.

== Free objects ==
Suppose &quot;V&quot; is a non-trivial variety of algebras, i.e. &quot;V&quot; contains algebras with more than one element. One can show that for every set &quot;S&quot;, the variety &quot;V&quot; contains a &quot;free algebra FS on S&quot;. This means that there is an injective set map that satisfies the following universal property: given any algebra &quot;A&quot; in &quot;V&quot; and any map , there exists a unique &quot;V&quot;-homomorphism such that .

This generalizes the notions of free group, free abelian group, free algebra, free module etc. It has the consequence that every algebra in a variety is a homomorphic image of a free algebra.

== Category theory ==

Besides varieties, category theorists use two other frameworks that are equivalent in terms of the kinds of algebras they describe: finitary monads and Lawvere theories. We may go from a variety to a finitary monad as follows. A category with some variety of algebras as objects and homomorphisms as morphisms is called a finitary algebraic category. For any finitary algebraic category &quot;V&quot;, the forgetful functor has a left adjoint , namely the functor that assigns to each set the free algebra on that set. This adjunction is monadic, meaning that the category &quot;V&quot; is equivalent to the Eilenberg–Moore category Set&quot;T&quot; for the monad . Moreover the monad &quot;T&quot; is finitary, meaning it commutes with filtered colimits.

The monad is thus enough to recover the finitary algebraic category. Indeed, finitary algebraic categories are precisely those categories equivalent to the Eilenberg-Moore categories of finitary monads. Both these, in turn, are equivalent to categories of algebras of Lawvere theories.

Working with monads permits the following generalization. One says a category is an algebraic category if it is monadic over Set. This is a more general notion than &quot;finitary algebraic category&quot; because it admits such categories as &quot;CABA&quot; (complete atomic Boolean algebras) and &quot;CSLat&quot; (complete semilattices) whose signatures include infinitary operations. In those two cases the signature is large, meaning that it forms not a set but a proper class, because its operations are of unbounded arity. The algebraic category of sigma algebras also has infinitary operations, but their arity is countable whence its signature is small (forms a set).

Every finitary algebraic category is a locally presentable category.

== Pseudovariety of finite algebras ==
Since varieties are closed under arbitrary direct products, all non-trivial varieties contain infinite algebras. Attempts have been made to develop a finitary analogue of the theory of varieties. This led, e.g., to the notion of variety of finite semigroups. This kind of variety uses only finitary products. However, it uses a more general kind of identities.

A &quot;pseudovariety&quot; is usually defined to be a class of algebras of a given signature, closed under the taking of homomorphic images, subalgebras and finitary direct products. Not every author assumes that all algebras of a pseudovariety are finite; if this is the case, one sometimes talks of a &quot;variety of finite algebras&quot;. For pseudovarieties, there is no general finitary counterpart to Birkhoff&#x27;s theorem, but in many cases the introduction of a more complex notion of equations allows similar results to be derived.

Pseudovarieties are of particular importance in the study of finite semigroups and hence in formal language theory. Eilenberg&#x27;s theorem, often referred to as the &quot;variety theorem&quot;, describes a natural correspondence between varieties of regular languages and pseudovarieties of finite semigroups.

<text>Sound localization is a listener&#x27;s ability to identify the location or origin of a detected sound in direction and distance.

The sound localization mechanisms of the mammalian auditory system have been extensively studied. The auditory system uses several cues for sound source localization, including time difference and level difference (or intensity difference) between the ears, and spectral information. Other animals, such as birds and reptiles, also use them but they may use them differently, and some also have localization cues which are absent in the human auditory system, such as the effects of ear movements. Animals with the ability to localize sound have a clear evolutionary advantage.

== How sound reaches the brain ==

Sound is the perceptual result of mechanical vibrations traveling through a medium such as air or water. Through the mechanisms of compression and rarefaction, sound waves travel through the air, bounce off the pinna and concha of the exterior ear, and enter the ear canal. In mammals, the sound waves vibrate the tympanic membrane (ear drum), causing the three bones of the middle ear to vibrate, which then sends the energy through the oval window and into the cochlea where it is changed into a chemical signal by hair cells in the organ of Corti, which synapse onto spiral ganglion fibers that travel through the cochlear nerve into the brain.

== Neural interactions ==

In vertebrates, interaural time differences are known to be calculated in the superior olivary nucleus of the brainstem. According to Jeffress, this calculation relies on delay lines: neurons in the superior olive which accept innervation from each ear with different connecting axon lengths. Some cells are more directly connected to one ear than the other, thus they are specific for a particular interaural time difference. This theory is equivalent to the mathematical procedure of cross-correlation. However, because Jeffress&#x27;s theory is unable to account for the precedence effect, in which only the first of multiple identical sounds is used to determine the sounds&#x27; location (thus avoiding confusion caused by echoes), it cannot be entirely used to explain the response. Furthermore, a number of recent physiological observations made in the midbrain and brainstem of small mammals have shed considerable doubt on the validity of Jeffress&#x27;s original ideas.

Neurons sensitive to interaural level differences (ILDs) are excited by stimulation of one ear and inhibited by stimulation of the other ear, such that the response magnitude of the cell depends on the relative strengths of the two inputs, which in turn, depends on the sound intensities at the ears.

In the auditory midbrain nucleus, the inferior colliculus (IC), many ILD sensitive neurons have response functions that decline steeply from maximum to zero spikes as a function of ILD. However, there are also many neurons with much more shallow response functions that do not decline to zero spikes.

== Human auditory system ==

Sound localization is the process of determining the location of a sound source. The brain utilizes subtle differences in intensity, spectral, and timing cues to localize sound sources.

Localization can be described in terms of three-dimensional position: the azimuth or horizontal angle, the elevation or vertical angle, and the distance (for static sounds) or velocity (for moving sounds).

The azimuth of a sound is signaled by the difference in arrival times between the ears, by the relative amplitude of high-frequency sounds (the shadow effect), and by the asymmetrical spectral reflections from various parts of our bodies, including torso, shoulders, and pinnae.

The distance cues are the loss of amplitude, the loss of high frequencies, and the ratio of the direct signal to the reverberated signal.

Depending on where the source is located, our head acts as a barrier to change the timbre, intensity, and spectral qualities of the sound, helping the brain orient where the sound emanated from. These minute differences between the two ears are known as interaural cues.

Lower frequencies, with longer wavelengths, diffract the sound around the head forcing the brain to focus only on the phasing cues from the source.

Helmut Haas discovered that we can discern the sound source despite additional reflections at 10 decibels louder than the original wave front, using the earliest arriving wave front. This principle is known as the Haas effect, a specific version of the precedence effect. Haas measured down to even a 1 millisecond difference in timing between the original sound and reflected sound increased the spaciousness, allowing the brain to discern the true location of the original sound. The nervous system combines all early reflections into a single perceptual whole allowing the brain to process multiple different sounds at once. The nervous system will combine reflections that are within about 35 milliseconds of each other and that have a similar intensity.

=== Duplex theory ===

To determine the lateral input direction (left, front, right), the auditory system analyzes the following ear signal information:

In 1907, Lord Rayleigh utilized tuning forks to generate monophonic excitation and studied the lateral sound localization theory on a human head model without auricle. He first presented the interaural clue difference based sound localization theory, which is known as Duplex Theory. Human ears are on different sides of the head, and thus have different coordinates in space. As shown in the duplex theory figure, since the distances between the acoustic source and ears are different, there are time difference and intensity difference between the sound signals of two ears. We call those kinds of differences as Interaural Time Difference (ITD) and Interaural Intensity Difference (IID) respectively.

From the duplex theory figure we can see that for source B1 or source B2, there will be a propagation delay between two ears, which will generate the ITD. Simultaneously, human head and ears may have a shadowing effect on high-frequency signals, which will generate IID.

* Interaural time difference (ITD) – Sound from the right side reaches the right ear earlier than the left ear. The auditory system evaluates interaural time differences from: (a) Phase delays at low frequencies and (b) group delays at high frequencies. 
* Theory and experiments show that ITD relates to the signal frequency formula_1. Suppose the angular position of the acoustic source is formula_2, the head radius is formula_3 and the acoustic velocity is formula_4, the function of ITD is given by: formula_5. In above closed form, we assumed that the 0 degree is in the right ahead of the head and counter-clockwise is positive.
* Interaural intensity difference (IID) or interaural level difference (ILD) – Sound from the right side has a higher level at the right ear than at the left ear, because the head shadows the left ear. These level differences are highly frequency dependent and they increase with increasing frequency. Massive theoretical researches demonstrate that IID relates to the signal frequency formula_1 and the angular position of the acoustic source formula_2. The function of IID is given by: formula_8
* For frequencies below 1000 Hz, mainly ITDs are evaluated (phase delays), for frequencies above 1500 Hz mainly IIDs are evaluated. Between 1000 Hz and 1500 Hz there is a transition zone, where both mechanisms play a role.
* Localization accuracy is 1 degree for sources in front of the listener and 15 degrees for sources to the sides. Humans can discern interaural time differences of 10 microseconds or less.

For frequencies below 800 Hz, the dimensions of the head (ear distance 21.5 cm, corresponding to an interaural time delay of 626 μs) are smaller than the half wavelength of the sound waves. So the auditory system can determine phase delays between both ears without confusion. Interaural level differences are very low in this frequency range, especially below about 200 Hz, so a precise evaluation of the input direction is nearly impossible on the basis of level differences alone. As the frequency drops below 80 Hz it becomes difficult or impossible to use either time difference or level difference to determine a sound&#x27;s lateral source, because the phase difference between the ears becomes too small for a directional evaluation.

For frequencies above 1600 Hz the dimensions of the head are greater than the length of the sound waves. An unambiguous determination of the input direction based on interaural phase alone is not possible at these frequencies. However, the interaural level differences become larger, and these level differences are evaluated by the auditory system. Also, delays between the ears can still be detected via some combination of phase differences and group delays, which are more pronounced at higher frequencies; that is, if there is a sound onset, the delay of this onset between the ears can be used to determine the input direction of the corresponding sound source. This mechanism becomes especially important in reverberant environments. After a sound onset there is a short time frame where the direct sound reaches the ears, but not yet the reflected sound. The auditory system uses this short time frame for evaluating the sound source direction, and keeps this detected direction as long as reflections and reverberation prevent an unambiguous direction estimation. The mechanisms described above cannot be used to differentiate between a sound source ahead of the hearer or behind the hearer; therefore additional cues have to be evaluated.

=== Pinna filtering effect ===
Duplex theory shows that ITD and IID play significant roles in sound localization, but they can only deal with lateral localization problems. For example, if two acoustic sources are placed symmetrically at the front and back of the right side of the human head, they will generate equal ITDs and IIDs, in what is called the cone model effect. However, human ears can still distinguish between these sources. Besides that, in natural sense of hearing, one ear alone, without any ITD or IID, can distinguish between them with high accuracy. Due to the disadvantages of duplex theory, researchers proposed the pinna filtering effect theory. The shape of the human pinna is concave with complex folds and asymmetrical both horizontally and vertically. Reflected and direct waves generate a frequency spectrum on the eardrum, relating to the acoustic sources. Then auditory nerves localize the sources using this frequency spectrum.

These spectrum clues generated by the pinna filtering effect can be presented as a head-related transfer function (HRTF). The corresponding time domain expressions are called the head-related impulse response (HRIR). The HRTF is also described as the transfer function from the free field to a specific point in the ear canal. HRTFs are usually recognized as LTI systems:

formula_9
formula_10

where L and R represent the left ear and right ear respectively, formula_11 and formula_12 represent the amplitude of the sound pressure at the entrances to the left and right ear canals, and formula_13 is the amplitude of sound pressure at the center of the head coordinate when listener does not exist. In general, an HRTF&#x27;s formula_14 and formula_15 are functions of source angular position formula_2, elevation angle formula_17, the distance between the source and the center of the head formula_3, the angular velocity formula_19 and the equivalent dimension of the head formula_20.

At present, the main institutes that work on measuring HRTF database include CIPIC International Lab, MIT Media Lab, the Graduate School in Psychoacoustics at the University of Oldenburg, the Neurophysiology Lab at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and Ames Lab of NASA. Databases of HRIRs from humans with normal and impaired hearing and from animals are publicly available.

=== Other cues ===

The human outer ear, i.e. the structures of the pinna and the external ear canal, form direction-selective filters. Depending on the sound input direction, different filter resonances become active. These resonances implant direction-specific patterns into the frequency responses of the ears, which can be evaluated by the auditory system for sound localization. Together with other direction-selective reflections at the head, shoulders and torso, they form the outer ear transfer functions. These patterns in the ear&#x27;s frequency responses are highly individual, depending on the shape and size of the outer ear. If sound is presented through headphones, and has been recorded via another head with different-shaped outer ear surfaces, the directional patterns differ from the listener&#x27;s own, and problems will appear when trying to evaluate directions in the median plane with these foreign ears. As a consequence, front–back permutations or inside-the-head-localization can appear when listening to dummy head recordings, or otherwise referred to as binaural recordings. It has been shown that human subjects can monaurally localize high frequency sound but not low frequency sound. Binaural localization, however, was possible with lower frequencies. This is likely due to the pinna being small enough to only interact with sound waves of high frequency. It seems that people can only accurately localize the elevation of sounds that are complex and include frequencies above 7,000 Hz, and a pinna must be present.

When the head is stationary, the binaural cues for lateral sound localization (interaural time difference and interaural level difference) do not give information about the location of a sound in the median plane. Identical ITDs and ILDs can be produced by sounds at eye level or at any elevation, as long as the lateral direction is constant. However, if the head is rotated, the ITD and ILD change dynamically, and those changes are different for sounds at different elevations. For example, if an eye-level sound source is straight ahead and the head turns to the left, the sound becomes louder (and arrives sooner) at the right ear than at the left. But if the sound source is directly overhead, there will be no change in the ITD and ILD as the head turns. Intermediate elevations will produce intermediate degrees of change, and if the presentation of binaural cues to the two ears during head movement is reversed, the sound will be heard behind the listener. Hans Wallach artificially altered a sound&#x27;s binaural cues during movements of the head. Although the sound was objectively placed at eye level, the dynamic changes to ITD and ILD as the head rotated were those that would be produced if the sound source had been elevated. In this situation, the sound was heard at the synthesized elevation. The fact that the sound sources objectively remained at eye level prevented monaural cues from specifying the elevation, showing that it was the dynamic change in the binaural cues during head movement that allowed the sound to be correctly localized in the vertical dimension. The head movements need not be actively produced; accurate vertical localization occurred in a similar setup when the head rotation was produced passively, by seating the blindfolded subject in a rotating chair. As long as the dynamic changes in binaural cues accompanied a perceived head rotation, the synthesized elevation was perceived.

In the 1960s Batteau showed the pinna also enhances horizontal localization.

=== Distance of the sound source ===
The human auditory system has only limited possibilities to determine the distance of a sound source. In the close-up-range there are some indications for distance determination, such as extreme level differences (e.g. when whispering into one ear) or specific pinna (the visible part of the ear) resonances in the close-up range.

The auditory system uses these clues to estimate the distance to a sound source:
* Direct/ Reflection ratio: In enclosed rooms, two types of sound are arriving at a listener: The direct sound arrives at the listener&#x27;s ears without being reflected at a wall. Reflected sound has been reflected at least one time at a wall before arriving at the listener. The ratio between direct sound and reflected sound can give an indication about the distance of the sound source.
* Loudness: Distant sound sources have a lower loudness than close ones. This aspect can be evaluated especially for well-known sound sources.
* Sound spectrum: High frequencies are more quickly damped by the air than low frequencies. Therefore, a distant sound source sounds more muffled than a close one, because the high frequencies are attenuated. For sound with a known spectrum (e.g. speech) the distance can be estimated roughly with the help of the perceived sound.
* ITDG: The Initial Time Delay Gap describes the time difference between arrival of the direct wave and first strong reflection at the listener. Nearby sources create a relatively large ITDG, with the first reflections having a longer path to take, possibly many times longer. When the source is far away, the direct and the reflected sound waves have similar path lengths.
* Movement: Similar to the visual system there is also the phenomenon of motion parallax in acoustical perception. For a moving listener nearby sound sources are passing faster than distant sound sources.
* Level Difference: Very close sound sources cause a different level between the ears.

=== Signal processing ===

Sound processing of the human auditory system is performed in so-called critical bands. The hearing range is segmented into 24 critical bands, each with a width of 1 Bark or 100 Mel. For a directional analysis the signals inside the critical band are analyzed together.

The auditory system can extract the sound of a desired sound source out of interfering noise. This allows the listener to concentrate on only one speaker if other speakers are also talking (the cocktail party effect). With the help of the cocktail party effect sound from interfering directions is perceived attenuated compared to the sound from the desired direction. The auditory system can increase the signal-to-noise ratio by up to 15 dB, which means that interfering sound is perceived to be attenuated to half (or less) of its actual loudness. 

In enclosed rooms not only the direct sound from a sound source is arriving at the listener&#x27;s ears, but also sound which has been reflected at the walls. The auditory system analyses only the direct sound, which is arriving first, for sound localization, but not the reflected sound, which is arriving later (law of the first wave front). So sound localization remains possible even in an echoic environment. This echo cancellation occurs in the Dorsal Nucleus of the Lateral Lemniscus (DNLL).

In order to determine the time periods, where the direct sound prevails and which can be used for directional evaluation, the auditory system analyzes loudness changes in different critical bands and also the stability of the perceived direction. If there is a strong attack of the loudness in several critical bands and if the perceived direction is stable, this attack is in all probability caused by the direct sound of a sound source, which is entering newly or which is changing its signal characteristics. This short time period is used by the auditory system for directional and loudness analysis of this sound. When reflections arrive a little bit later, they do not enhance the loudness inside the critical bands in such a strong way, but the directional cues become unstable, because there is a mix of sound of several reflection directions. As a result, no new directional analysis is triggered by the auditory system.

This first detected direction from the direct sound is taken as the found sound source direction, until other strong loudness attacks, combined with stable directional information, indicate that a new directional analysis is possible. (see Franssen effect)

== Specific techniques with applications ==
=== Auditory transmission stereo system ===
This kind of sound localization technique provides us the real virtual stereo system. It utilizes &quot;smart&quot; manikins, such as KEMAR, to glean signals or use DSP methods to simulate the transmission process from sources to ears. After amplifying, recording and transmitting, the two channels of received signals will be reproduced through earphones or speakers. This localization approach uses electroacoustic methods to obtain the spatial information of the original sound field by transferring the listener&#x27;s auditory apparatus to the original sound field. The most considerable advantages of it would be that its acoustic images are lively and natural. Also, it only needs two independent transmitted signals to reproduce the acoustic image of a 3D system.
=== 3D para-virtualization stereo system ===
The representatives of this kind of system are SRS Audio Sandbox, Spatializer Audio Lab and Qsound Qxpander. They use HRTF to simulate the received acoustic signals at the ears from different directions with common binary-channel stereo reproduction. Therefore, they can simulate reflected sound waves and improve subjective sense of space and envelopment. Since they are para-virtualization stereo systems, the major goal of them is to simulate stereo sound information. Traditional stereo systems use sensors that are quite different from human ears. Although those sensors can receive the acoustic information from different directions, they do not have the same frequency response of human auditory system. Therefore, when binary-channel mode is applied, human auditory systems still cannot feel the 3D sound effect field. However, the 3D para-virtualization stereo system overcome such disadvantages. It uses HRTF principles to glean acoustic information from the original sound field then produce a lively 3D sound field through common earphones or speakers.

===Multichannel stereo virtual reproduction===
Since the multichannel stereo systems require many reproduction channels, some researchers adopted the HRTF simulation technologies to reduce the number of reproduction channels. They use only two speakers to simulate multiple speakers in a multichannel system. This process is called as virtual reproduction. Essentially, such approach uses both interaural difference principle and pinna filtering effect theory. Unfortunately, this kind of approach cannot perfectly substitute the traditional multichannel stereo system, such as 5.1/7.1 surround sound system. That is because when the listening zone is relatively larger, simulation reproduction through HRTFs may cause invert acoustic images at symmetric positions.

== Animals ==
Since most animals have two ears, many of the effects of the human auditory system can also be found in other animals. Therefore, interaural time differences (interaural phase differences) and interaural level differences play a role for the hearing of many animals. But the influences on localization of these effects are dependent on head sizes, ear distances, the ear positions and the orientation of the ears. Smaller animals like insects use different techniques as the separation of the ears are too small. For the process of animals emitting sound to improve localization, a biological form of active sonar, see animal echolocation.

===Lateral information (left, ahead, right)===

If the ears are located at the side of the head, similar lateral localization cues as for the human auditory system can be used. This means: evaluation of interaural time differences (interaural phase differences) for lower frequencies and evaluation of interaural level differences for higher frequencies. The evaluation of interaural phase differences is useful, as long as it gives unambiguous results. This is the case, as long as ear distance is smaller than half the length (maximal one wavelength) of the sound waves. For animals with a larger head than humans the evaluation range for interaural phase differences is shifted towards lower frequencies, for animals with a smaller head, this range is shifted towards higher frequencies.

The lowest frequency which can be localized depends on the ear distance. Animals with a greater ear distance can localize lower frequencies than humans can. For animals with a smaller ear distance the lowest localizable frequency is higher than for humans.

If the ears are located at the side of the head, interaural level differences appear for higher frequencies and can be evaluated for localization tasks. For animals with ears at the top of the head, no shadowing by the head will appear and therefore there will be much less interaural level differences, which could be evaluated. Many of these animals can move their ears, and these ear movements can be used as a lateral localization cue.

=== In the median plane (front, above, back, below) ===

For many mammals there are also pronounced structures in the pinna near the entry of the ear canal. As a consequence, direction-dependent resonances can appear, which could be used as an additional localization cue, similar to the localization in the median plane in the human auditory system.
There are additional localization cues which are also used by animals.

=== Head tilting ===

For sound localization in the median plane (elevation of the sound) also two detectors can be used, which are positioned at different heights. In animals, however, rough elevation information is gained simply by tilting the head, provided that the sound lasts long enough to complete the movement. This explains the innate behavior of cocking the head to one side when trying to localize a sound precisely. To get instantaneous localization in more than two dimensions from time-difference or amplitude-difference cues requires more than two detectors.

=== Localization with coupled ears (flies) ===

The tiny parasitic fly &quot;Ormia ochracea&quot; has become a model organism in sound localization experiments because of its unique ear. The animal is too small for the time difference of sound arriving at the two ears to be calculated in the usual way, yet it can determine the direction of sound sources with exquisite precision. The tympanic membranes of opposite ears are directly connected mechanically, allowing resolution of sub-microsecond time differences and requiring a new neural coding strategy. Ho showed that the coupled-eardrum system in frogs can produce increased interaural vibration disparities when only small arrival time and sound level differences were available to the animal&#x27;s head. Efforts to build directional microphones based on the coupled-eardrum structure are underway.

===Bi-coordinate sound localization (owls)===
Most owls are nocturnal or crepuscular birds of prey. Because they hunt at night, they must rely on non-visual senses. Experiments by Roger Payne have shown that owls are sensitive to the sounds made by their prey, not the heat or the smell. In fact, the sound cues are both necessary and sufficient for localization of mice from a distant location where they are perched. For this to work, the owls must be able to accurately localize both the azimuth and the elevation of the sound source.

=== Dolphins ===

Dolphins (and other odontocetes) rely on echolocation to aid in detecting, identifying, localizing, and capturing prey. Dolphin sonar signals are well suited for localizing multiple, small targets in a three-dimensional aquatic environment by utilizing highly directional (3 dB beamwidth of about 10 deg), broadband (3 dB bandwidth typically of about 40 kHz; peak frequencies between 40 kHz and 120 kHz), short duration clicks (about 40 μs). Dolphins can localize sounds both passively and actively (echolocation) with a resolution of about 1 deg. Cross-modal matching (between vision and echolocation) suggests dolphins perceive the spatial structure of complex objects interrogated through echolocation, a feat that likely requires spatially resolving individual object features and integration into a holistic representation of object shape. Although dolphins are sensitive to small, binaural intensity and time differences, mounting evidence suggests dolphins employ position-dependent spectral cues derived from well-developed head-related transfer functions, for sound localization in both the horizontal and vertical planes. A very small temporal integration time (264 μs) allows localization of multiple targets at varying distances. Localization adaptations include pronounced asymmetry of the skull, nasal sacks, and specialized lipid structures in the forehead and jaws, as well as acoustically isolated middle and inner ears.

The role of Prestin in sound localization:

In the realm of mammalian sound localization, the Prestin gene has emerged as a pivotal player, particularly in the fascinating arena of echolocation employed by bats and dolphins. Discovered just over a decade ago, Prestin encodes a protein located in the inner ear&#x27;s hair cells, facilitating rapid contractions and expansions. This intricate mechanism operates akin to an antique phonograph horn, amplifying sound waves within the cochlea and elevating the overall sensitivity of hearing.

In 2014 Liu and others delved into the evolutionary adaptations of Prestin, unveiling its critical role in the ultrasonic hearing range essential for animal sonar, specifically in the context of echolocation. This adaptation proves instrumental for dolphins navigating through turbid waters and bats seeking sustenance in nocturnal darkness.

Noteworthy is the emission of high-frequency echolocation calls by toothed whales and echolocating bats, showcasing diversity in shape, duration, and amplitude. However, it is their high-frequency hearing that becomes paramount, as it enables the reception and analysis of echoes bouncing off objects in their environment. A meticulous dissection of Prestin protein function in sonar-guided bats and bottlenose dolphins, juxtaposed with nonsonar mammals, sheds light on the intricacies of this process.

Evolutionary analyses of Prestin protein sequences brought forth a compelling observationa singular amino acid shift from threonine (Thr or T) in sonar mammals to asparagine (Asn or N) in nonsonar mammals. This specific alteration, subject to parallel evolution, emerges as a linchpin in the mammalian echolocation narrative.

Subsequent experiments lent credence to this hypothesis, identifying four key amino acid distinctions in sonar mammals that likely contribute to their distinctive echolocation features. The confluence of evolutionary analyses and empirical findings provides robust evidence, marking a significant juncture in comprehending the Prestin gene&#x27;s role in the evolutionary trajectory of mammalian echolocation systems. This research underscores the adaptability and evolutionary significance of Prestin, offering valuable insights into the genetic foundations of sound localization in bats and dolphins, particularly within the sophisticated realm of echolocation.

==History==

The term &#x27;binaural&#x27; literally signifies &#x27;to hear with two ears&#x27;, and was introduced in 1859 to signify the practice of listening to the same sound through both ears, or to two discrete sounds, one through each ear. It was not until 1916 that Carl Stumpf (1848–1936), a German philosopher and psychologist, distinguished between dichotic listening, which refers to the stimulation of each ear with a different stimulus, and diotic listening, the simultaneous stimulation of both ears with the same stimulus.

Later, it would become apparent that binaural hearing, whether dichotic or diotic, is the means by which sound localization occurs.

Scientific consideration of binaural hearing began before the phenomenon was so named, with speculations published in 1792 by William Charles Wells (1757–1817) based on his research into binocular vision. Giovanni Battista Venturi (1746–1822) conducted and described experiments in which people tried to localize a sound using both ears, or one ear blocked with a finger. This work was not followed up on, and was only recovered after others had worked out how human sound localization works. Lord Rayleigh (1842–1919) would do these same experiments and come to the results, without knowing Venturi had first done them, almost seventy-five years later.

Charles Wheatstone (1802–1875) did work on optics and color mixing, and also explored hearing. He invented a device he called a &quot;microphone&quot; that involved a metal plate over each ear, each connected to metal rods; he used this device to amplify sound. He also did experiments holding tuning forks to both ears at the same time, or separately, trying to work out how sense of hearing works, that he published in 1827. Ernst Heinrich Weber (1795–1878) and August Seebeck (1805–1849) and William Charles Wells also attempted to compare and contrast what would become known as binaural hearing with the principles of binocular integration generally.

Understanding how the differences in sound signals between two ears contributes to auditory processing in such a way as to enable sound localization and direction was considerably advanced after the invention of the stethophone by Somerville Scott Alison in 1859, who coined the term &#x27;binaural&#x27;. Alison based the stethophone on the stethoscope, which had been invented by René Théophile Hyacinthe Laennec (1781–1826); the stethophone had two separate &quot;pickups&quot;, allowing the user to hear and compare sounds derived from two discrete locations.

<doc id="1021755" wikidata="Q7933846" url="?curid=1021755" title="Virgilia (plant)">
<text>Virgilia is a genus of Southern African trees in the family Fabaceae that is known for its very fast growth (4.5 m in 2 years) and a tendency to fall over as it matures (15 years or so). The common name in South Africa (in Afrikaans) is , meaning &#x27;choice tree&#x27;. Valued as useful ornamental trees by gardeners, the genus&#x27;s two species are also known as tree-in-a-hurry, Cape lilac, blossom tree and pink blossom tree.

==Taxonomy==

The genus was described by Jean Louis Marie Poiret and published in Encyclopédie Méthodique in 1808. Most botanists feel that the two species are simply forms and should be lumped under one species, &quot;Virgilia oroboides&quot;. That would mean that the current &quot;V. divaricata&quot; is simply a darker form limited to the forested region of Knysna, South Africa. &quot;Virgilia oroboides&quot; had a number of synonyms, while both &quot;V. oroboides&quot; and &quot;V. divaricata&quot; had both been named &quot;V. capensis&quot; by different authors.

===Species===
Below is a list of offers species of the genus &quot;Virgilia&quot; accepted as of July 2014, sorted alphabetically. For each one, the binomial name followed by the author is indicated, abbreviated according to the conventions and uses.

*&quot;Virgilia divaricata&quot; 
*&quot;Virgilia oroboides&quot; 

==Description==
These are small to medium sized trees, up to 15 to 20 meters tall, filling space easily in the garden. The tree has shiny green, fern-like, pinnate foliage and displays attractive pea-like, mauve/pink, fragrant flowers (which smell like bubblegum) during warmer months that will be followed by dark, leathery seed pods.

==Cultivation==
Growing in full sun to partially shade, they prefer well drained soils; some will then grow 2m in the first season. They will tolerate wind and have dense foliage growing close to the ground, so they are useful as pioneer species for privacy and wind protection, despite having a comparatively short life (15 years). Popular in the UK since the 18th century or so, they are also now commonly present in the USA and Australia.

<text>Virgin Digital was an online music store operated in the United Kingdom and United States by the Virgin Group. It launched on 2 September 2005 in the UK, and was refreshed in November 2006 to run through web browsers, rather than the former Virgin Digital Player. The site closed down in late 2006 in the US, while the UK store closed in October 2007.

Virgin Digital offered individual tracks at £0.79 and most albums for about £6.49. Its subscription service, Digital Music Club, cost £9.99 per month. It had the singular distinction of being among the largest collected online music library, with over two and a half million downloadable tracks.

Purchased tracks could be transferred to other devices and burned to CDs. Subscription tracks were tethered to the PC (up to 3) and could be transferred to a portable music player, although this required the premium subscription service, at £14.99 per month. Song previews were 30 seconds in the Music Store, although full length tracks were available to subscribers.

A chat function was considered to let subscribers communicate while browsing, downloading or listening to tracks.

==Closure==
Virgin Digital originally operated in both the United Kingdom and United States. The US store was discontinued in late 2006, and this website now redirects to Napster.

On Friday 21 September 2007, an announcement appeared on the Virgin Digital UK website stating the following: &quot;Dear customer, we regret to announce that the Virgin Digital service is due to close. We will be taking no new customers from today, Friday 21 September.&quot;

The UK store finally closed on Friday 19 October 2007. Virgin have stated on their website that the decision to close Virgin Digital was so that the company could concentrate on offering digital media through Virgin Media, which has its own music store operated by OD2.
