<text>Adrian College is a private United Methodist liberal arts college in Adrian, Michigan. The college offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees in 92 academic majors and programs. The 100 acre (0.40 km2) campus contains newly constructed facilities along with historic buildings. Adrian College is affiliated with the United Methodist Church and is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. The spring 2020–21 enrollment was 1,677 students.

==History==
The college has its origin as a theological institute founded by Wesleyan Methodists at Leoni, Michigan, in 1845. This institution merged with Leoni Seminary, another Methodist school, in 1855 to form Michigan Union College. In 1859, that institution closed and its assets were transferred to Adrian &quot;through the efforts of the antislavery leader and educator, Rev. Asa Mahan, who was elected first president of the new Adrian College&quot;. The college was chartered by the Michigan Legislature on March 28, 1859. In the early stages of the Civil War the college volunteered itself as a base for the formation of Michigan regiments for the Union side. The current Valade Hall building sits on the site of the former base camp for these soldiers.

A marker designating the college as a Michigan Historic Site was erected by the Michigan Historical Commission. The inscription reads:

Chartered on March 28, 1859, Adrian College traces its origins back to a Wesleyan Methodist theological institute founded at Leoni, Michigan in 1845. This institution later became Michigan Union College. Strongly antislavery in its sentiments, the school was moved to Adrian in 1859 through the efforts of the antislavery leader and educator, Rev. Asa Mahan, who was elected first president of the new Adrian College. The college was transferred to the Methodist Protestant Church in 1868, and here for 71 years, leaders of this denomination were trained. In 1939 a denominational union of American Methodism resulted in the establishment of the Methodist Church. Adrian College is affiliated with this great church body.

An additional marker commemorating Camp Williams and the Fourth Michigan Volunteer Infantry as a Michigan Historic Site was erected by the Michigan Historical Commission. The inscriptions read:

Camp Williams
At the outbreak of the Civil War in early 1861, the trustees of Adrian College offered the use of campus buildings and grounds to the Fourth Michigan Volunteer Infantry for training. This became known as Camp Williams. The city of Adrian donated money to build a mess and dining hall. By early June ten companies of the Fourth had arrived and started their training. The 1,025 soldiers came from Adrian, Ann Arbor, Dexter, Jonesville, Hudson, Sturgis, Monroe, Hillsdale, Tecumseh, and Trenton. On June 21 nearly 30,000 people came to town to see the Fourth depart for Washington. The ladies of Adrian presented Colonel Dwight Woodbury with the regimental flag. Sewn into the flag was &quot;The Ladies of Adrian to the Fourth regiment Defend It.&quot;

Fourth Michigan Volunteer Infantry
In spring 1861 the Fourth Michigan Volunteer Infantry departed Adrians&#x27; Camp Williams for service in the Civil War. The regiment was assigned to the Army of the Potomac and saw action in forty-one engagements, including Gaines Mills, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and Petersburg. The Fourth was one of the few regiments to lose more men in battle than from disease. Out of 1,399 men, 307 died from May 1862 through June 1864. Three colonels died in battle defending their regimental flag: Dwight Woodbury, at Malvern Hill, Virginia; Harrison Jeffords in The Wheatfield at Gettysburg; and George Lumbard at The Wilderness, Virginia. In 1864 the reorganized Fourth trained here, at Camp Williams, once more.

==Campus==

The original campus was built in the mid-19th century. It would be almost a century later that President John Dawson began a major construction phase of the campus, including most of the residence halls, academic buildings, a student union, and the administration building. More recently, current President Jeff Docking has introduced many plans to revitalize Adrian College and its campus, including the construction of new buildings, renovation of old ones, and programs related to athletics. Many of these initiatives are grouped under his &quot;Renaissance I and II Projects&quot; and include the new facilities such as: Arrington Ice Arena, a Multi-Sport Performance (Football) Stadium, Ritchie Marketplace (Dining Hall) Expansion, Athletic Training Laboratory &amp; Human Performance Lab, College View North Apartments, Indoor Baseball &amp; Softball Practice Facility, Terrace at Caine Student Center, and a new Grounds and Maintenance Facility. The college has also undertaken extensive renovation projects which include: the renovation of Rush Hall into a state-of-the-art million dollar multimedia facility, Robinson Planetarium renovations, Peelle 207 Lecture Hall, Spencer Hall Center for Music, Downs Hall (the oldest and most historic building on campus) and the current renovation and upgrade of Jones Hall (Business) and Peelle Hall (Science).

The college is making renovations and expansions to the Science, Business, Visual Arts, and Performing Arts departments.

==Academics==
Adrian College offers over 90 majors and pre-professional programs. It also offers six graduate programs using a unique 4+1 structure for current students.

<doc id="1008060" wikidata="Q7816981" url="?curid=1008060" title="Tom Murphy (playwright)">
<text>Tom Murphy (23 February 1935 – 15 May 2018) was an Irish dramatist who worked closely with the Abbey Theatre in Dublin and with Druid Theatre, Galway. He was born in County Galway, Ireland and later lived in Dublin.

Murphy&#x27;s first successful play, &quot;A Whistle in the Dark&quot;, was performed at the Theatre Royal Stratford East in London in 1961 and caused considerable controversy both there and in Dublin when it was later given its Irish premiere at the Abbey having initially been rejected by its artistic director.

==Life==
Murphy was born in Tuam, County Galway, the youngest of ten children. His elder siblings gradually emigrated to Birmingham until he was left alone with his mother. He played at centre half back for the Galway Vocational Schools Gaelic football team in the early 1950s. He attended Archbishop McHale College in Tuam, was an apprentice at the Tuam Sugar Factory and later became a metalwork teacher at Archbishop McHale College.

He began writing in the late 1950s: &quot;In 1958, my best friend said to me, why don&#x27;t we write a play? I didn&#x27;t think it was an unusual question, because in 1958 everyone in Ireland was writing a play&quot;. His second play, &quot;A Whistle in the Dark&quot;, was written in his Tuam kitchen on his free Friday and Saturday nights. It was entered into a competition for amateur plays, which it won, and was eventually produced in London in 1961, having been rejected by the Abbey Theatre. 

Though Murphy was religious as a boy, his 1975 play &quot;The Sanctuary Lamp&quot; was produced in the Abbey Theatre and received a hostile reception due to its anti-Catholic nature, with theatregoers walking out and much negative criticism in the media. After this controversy, Murphy worked as a farmer for some years.

Murphy died on 15 May 2018. He is survived by his wife, actress Jane Brennan, and his three children by his first wife Mary and a granddaughter. The President of Ireland Michael D. Higgins said: &quot;The importance of Tom Murphy’s contribution to Irish theatre is immeasurable and outstanding. We have had no greater use of language for the stage than in the body of work produced by Tom Murphy since his earliest work in the 1960s.&quot;

==Writing career==
Considered by many to be one of Ireland&#x27;s greatest playwrights, Tom Murphy was honoured by the Abbey Theatre in 2001 by a retrospective season of six of his plays. His plays include the historical epic &quot;Famine&quot; (1968) which deals with the Great Famine of Ireland between 1846 and spring 1847, the anti-clerical &quot;The Sanctuary Lamp&quot; (1975), &quot;The Gigli Concert&quot; (1983) and for many his masterpiece, the lyrical &quot;Bailegangaire&quot; and the bar-room comedy &quot;Conversations on a Homecoming&quot; (both 1985).

His work is characterised by a constant experimentation in form and content from the apparently naturalistic &quot;A Whistle in the Dark&quot; to the surreal &quot;The Morning After Optimism&quot; and the spectacularly verbal &quot;The Gigli Concert&quot;. Recurring themes include the search for redemption and hope in a world apparently deserted by God and filled with suffering. Although steeped in the culture and mythology of Ireland, Murphy&#x27;s work does not trade on familiar clichés of Irish identity, dealing instead with Dostoyevskian themes of violence, nihilism and despair while never losing sight of the presence of laughter, humour and the possibilities of love and transcendence. His works are often described as being filled with rage, with Murphy himself stating &quot;There is a rage in me which I think is a natural thing. It was in me when I was 24 or 25, scribbling with my stub of a pencil. And it&#x27;s still there in everything I do. Rage not against the unfairness of life – life is of course unfair – but against the inequalities, the arrogance of power.&quot;

Younger playwrights whose work shows an indebtedness to him include Conor McPherson, Martin McDonagh and Gary Mitchell. His latest plays include &quot;The Wake&quot; (1997), &quot;The House&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Alice Trilogy&quot;, which premiered in 2005 at the Royal Court Theatre in London with Juliet Stevenson in the eponymous role. In 2006 Murphy directed the Irish premiere of the same play at the Peacock Theatre in Dublin with Jane Brennan in the lead role. In 2009, his play, &quot;The Last Days of a Reluctant Tyrant&quot; premiered at the Abbey Theatre.

His play &quot;The Sanctuary Lamp&quot; was performed at the Arcola Theatre in Dalston, London from 10 March to 3 April 2010, directed by Murphy himself.

He wrote one novel, &quot;The Seduction of Morality&quot; (1994).

<text>U.S. Route 140 (Pennsylvania &quot;Legislative Route 42&quot;) was a U.S. highway connecting Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to Baltimore, Maryland. The route was deleted from the system in 1979; today the road&#x27;s route is followed by portions of Pennsylvania Route 97, Maryland Route 97, and Maryland Route 140.

Though it had no historical significance in the battles fought at Gettysburg, it became important as the route to take to view the historic battlefields and cemetery there.

==Route description==
===Baltimore to Westminster===
US 140 began at the intersection of US 1 (North Avenue) and Pennsylvania Avenue in Baltimore. Pennsylvania Avenue continues southeast from the intersection and would have connected US 140 with US 40, which then followed Franklin Street through downtown Baltimore. US 140 headed northeast on Pennsylvania Avenue three blocks to Fulton Street, where the U.S. Highway joined Reisterstown Road at its southern end. US 140 intersected Gwynns Falls Parkway and MD 26 (Liberty Heights Avenue), which were both boulevards. US 140 itself became a divided highway and passed along the edge of Druid Hill Park to Park Circle, which was then a traffic circle, where the highway met the southern end of MD 129 (Park Heights Avenue) and also Druid Park Drive. From Park Circle, US 140 became an undivided street that followed MD 140&#x27;s out of the city of Baltimore.

US 140 continued along MD 140&#x27;s modern course all the way to Reisterstown. In the center of Pikesville, the U.S. Highway met Old Court Road at staggered intersections, neither of which were the modern course of the crossroad. Old Court Road heading east, which was part of MD 133, used what is now Walker Avenue to connect with modern Old Court Road; Old Court Road west from US 140 used Naylors Lane. North of Pikesville, the U.S. Highway met the eastern end of MD 400 (Mount Wilson Lane), which led to Mount Wilson State Hospital. US 140 intersected MD 130 (Greenspring Valley Road) and the Greenspring Valley Branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad in Garrison, then passed under the Western Maryland Railway and over Gwynns Falls at Owings Mills. The U.S. Highway met the southern end of MD 30 (Hanover Pike) in the center of Reisterstown, where the highway turned northwest onto Westminster Pike.

US 140&#x27;s course out of Reisterstown featured sharper corners than MD 140&#x27;s modern course; the U.S. Highway used Amy Brent Way through the I-795–MD 140 interchange and the paralleling road east of the Woodfield Court intersection. US 140 veered northwest from the present alignment, briefly following Glen Falls Road before crossing the North Branch of the Patapsco River—Liberty Reservoir had not yet been created—on a road that no longer exists. The highway continued along Old Westminster Pike on the southbound side of modern MD 140. In Finksburg, US 140 intersected MD 91, which followed what is now MD 879 (Old Gamber Road and Cedarhurst Road). The U.S. Highway briefly followed modern MD 140 then Old Westminster Pike, which now acts as a service road for northbound MD 140. Near the hamlet of Sandyville, US 140 began to follow Old Westminster Pike on the southbound side of MD 140.

===Westminster to Gettysburg===
Shortly before the highway entered the town of Westminster, it met the northern end of MD 683 (Poole Road). The U.S. Highway entered Westminster as Main Street, which had an intersection with MD 559 (Manchester Avenue) immediately after its junction with MD 32 (Washington Road). US 140 and MD 32 continued northwest to the center of town. There, the highways had in rapid succession an intersection with MD 31 (Railroad Avenue), which headed toward Manchester; a grade crossing of the Western Maryland Railway (now Maryland Midland Railway); and an intersection with the northern end of MD 27 (Liberty Street). US 140, MD 31, and MD 32 followed Main Street two more blocks before US 140 split north onto Pennsylvania Avenue; MD 31 and MD 32 continued on Main Street to where they diverged toward New Windsor and Taneytown, respectively.

US 140 followed Pennsylvania Avenue north out of Westminster and continued along Littlestown Pike. The U.S. Highway followed what is today MD 97 with only minor deviations through an intersection with MD 496 (Bachman Valley Road) and Union Mills before entering Pennsylvania south of Littlestown. US 140 followed its modern course along Queen Street through Littlestown, where it had a grade crossing of the Pennsylvania Railroad line between Frederick and Hanover and intersected PA 194 (King Street). The U.S. Highway followed Baltimore Pike all the way to its and US 140&#x27;s northern terminus in Gettysburg at US 15 (now US 15 Business). US 15 headed south on Steinwehr Avenue and north along Baltimore Street toward the central square of Gettysburg, where the U.S. Highway intersected US 30.

==History==
US 140 was first signed with the inception of the U.S. Highway numbering system in 1926. The route received numerous realignments over the years. In 1977, plans were made for US 140 to be decommissioned, with the route to be replaced by MD 140 between Baltimore and Westminster, MD 97 between Westminster and the Pennsylvania state line, and PA 97 between the Maryland state line and Gettysburg. This proposal was made in order to eliminate short routes from the U.S. Highway System. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials approved the removal of the US 140 designation on October 28, 1977. At one point, the section between MD 30 in Reisterstown and Westminster was to become a part of MD 9, which would continue northwest to Emmitsburg; MD 140 was to be designated between Baltimore and Reisterstown. In December 1978, the borough of Littlestown protested the renumbering of US 140 to PA 97. US 140 was decommissioned on January 1, 1979 and became MD 140 between Baltimore and Westminster, MD 97 between Westminster and the state line, and PA 97 within Pennsylvania.

The only freeway bypass of the original US 140 is Interstate 795, which runs from Reisterstown to the Baltimore Beltway. Regardless of the bypass, Maryland Route 140 is still the most direct route from Baltimore to the historical sites of Gettysburg.

<doc id="1008063" wikidata="Q3180373" url="?curid=1008063" title="Kuroyume">
<text>was a Japanese rock band formed in Nagoya in May 1991. They quickly achieved success with their 1994 major label debut album &quot;Mayoeru Yuritachi&quot;, which reached number three on the Oricon Albums Chart. Following the departure of guitarist Shin in 1995, vocalist Kiyoharu and bassist Hitoki remained the only official members. Each of their five subsequent albums reached the top seven on the chart, with &quot;Feminism&quot; (1995) and &quot;Fake Star&quot; (1996) both topping it. Their 1996 single &quot;Pistol&quot; earned them an MTV Video Music Award. Kuroyume had a definite influence on the visual kei scene, being credited as inspiration to many bands of the late 1990s and as one of the creators of Nagoya kei.

On January 29, 1999, Kuroyume indefinitely suspended all activities due to the severely strained relationship between Kiyoharu and Hitoki. They officially disbanded with a final live performance on January 29, 2009. However, the duo reunited only a year later in January 2010. They produced two further top-seven studio albums, before disbanding again in 2015.

==History==

===1991–1993: Formation and independent years===
Kuroyume was formed in 1991 by vocalist Kiyoharu, bassist Hitoki, drummer Eiki (all three former members of Garnet), and former Geracee guitarist Shin. After a year of performing live, Eiki left the band in June 1992 and they released &quot;Chuuzetsu&quot; the following month on Haunted House Records. The mini-album &quot;Ikiteita Chuzetsuji...&quot; (remastered from a previously released January 1992 demo tape) followed that December. Its 4,000 copies sold out by pre-order.

Kuroyume&#x27;s first full-length studio album, &quot;Nakigara o...&quot;, was released in June 1993 and clearly showed the group progressing in a more melodic direction by leaning further toward the goth side of things and doing away completely with any semblance of metal music. The song &quot;Shin&#x27;ai Naru Death Mask&quot; from their first mini album had been re-recorded, and the band&#x27;s first promotional music video was filmed for the song. Hiro, former drummer of The Star Club, joined the band in July 1993, but left only three months later. Kuroyume would utilize support drummers for the rest of their career. Hitoki would later say that after Eiki had left, they looked for someone who was &quot;good and cool, but when we thought of &#x27;Kuroyume&#x27;, there was no one who would fit in as an official member.&quot;

During this era, Kuroyume are credited as creators of the Nagoya kei scene alongside Rouage and Laputa. According to Fanatic Crisis guitarist Shun, Kuroyume and were the &quot;big two&quot; of Nagoya kei at the time.

===1994–1996: Success===
Shortly after signing with Toshiba EMI in early 1994, Kuroyume released &quot;For Dear&quot; in February as their major label debut single. The album &quot;Mayoeru Yuritachi -Romance of Scarlet-&quot; was released in March 1994 and reached number three on the Oricon Albums Chart. Two promotional videos were filmed, one for the single and another for album track &quot;Autism&quot;. In August 1994, the mini album &quot;Cruel&quot; and its lead single &quot;Ice My Life&quot; introduced a pop rock side. The band now dressed more conservatively, being reminiscent of 1980s New Romantic fashion and seeming to give off a more palatable image to mainstream buyers. The music on &quot;Cruel&quot; was more pop-friendly. According to Hitoki, he and Kiyoharu had planned from the beginning of the band to be [hard]core at first, pop later&#x27;, and this is when it all came together.&quot; The bassist suggested each member was afraid of the change, but with the initial sales of &quot;Mayoeru Yuritachi&quot; around 30,000 copies, &quot;I think Kiyoharu in particular was thinking about what we should do to sell more copies. He took the brunt of things, arguing with the manufacturer and with the office.&quot;, &quot;There are bands that either go along with [what the record label says] or those that don&#x27;t, depending on their basic values, but Kuroyume did not. I think we were able to change our concept, sound production, and visual aspects each time because we didn&#x27;t get on board and take a million-seller kind of route.&quot;

In February 1995, guitarist Shin left the group and formed the band Vinyl with former D&#x27;erlanger vocalist Dizzy. From this point on, Kuroyume continued as a duo, while utilizing support musicians. Shin had been the main composer of music in the band. Hitoki later revealed that &quot;Cruel&quot; was initially planned to be recorded with Shin taking lead as the band self-produced, but the guitarist never left his bedroom. When they began working on the follow up, the band was unable to get in contact with Shin and it was suggested that they continue without him. The two albums following this rearrangement, May 1995&#x27;s &quot;Feminism&quot; and May 1996&#x27;s &quot;Fake Star ~I&#x27;m Just a Japanese Fake Rocker~&quot;, continued the more mainstream rock of &quot;Cruel&quot;, with the latter of the two having an edgier production and presenting a more fashionable image. &quot;Feminism&quot; was named one of the top albums from 1989–1998 in a 2004 issue of the music magazine &quot;Band Yarouze&quot;. In September 1996, Kuroyume won the MTV Japan International Viewer&#x27;s Choice Award at the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards for the song &quot;Pistol&quot; from &quot;Fake Star&quot;. From this point onward, the band and particularly Kiyoharu were recognized on a national level.

===1997–1999, 2009: Breakup===
1997 heralded another transformation for Kuroyume, who were a punk influenced rock &#x27;n roll band both visually and musically for the album &quot;Drug Treatment&quot; released that June. April 1998&#x27;s &quot;Maria&quot; became their highest-charting single when it reached number two on the Oricon chart. In May 1998, they released what would become their last studio album, &quot;Corkscrew&quot;. On January 29, 1999, Kuroyume announced the indefinite suspension of all activities. Hitoki had asked to quit the band about two years earlier, but Kiyoharu told him it was &quot;impossible&quot; as tickets for a tour had already been sold, so they decided to do their last tour. Hitoki later said that he wanted to quit music around 1999; by having achieved major success, &quot;I began to see the dirty side of the music industry and the picture of the world. These aspects gradually built up inside me, and at that time, I could no longer enjoy music in its purest form.&quot; &quot;I still think that if you really want to make only the kind of music you like, it is impossible to make it [on a major record label].&quot;, &quot;When you are working and money is involved, there are always things that cannot be done solely from the artist&#x27;s point of view, and there is the possibility of &#x27;selling one&#x27;s soul&#x27; in the process. At the time, I felt that I had had enough of that conflict, and I no longer wanted to do music itself. I also felt guilty about not being able to spend time with my family because I was on tour a lot.&quot;

Kiyoharu later said the reason for the breakup was due to the severely strained relationship between Hitoki and himself. The two musicians were not on speaking terms and only communicated thorough their manager. The vocalist revealed that he purposely did not attend their rehearsals and, when the venue only had a single dressing room, he would enter the venue just before the show was to begin and would leave as soon as it was over in order to avoid running into Hitoki. The two had also been recording material in the studio separately; with Kiyoharu claiming he would lower the bass on songs, Hitoki would then raise it, only for Kiyoharu to turn it down again. When asked what caused their relationship to get so bad, Kiyoharu said it was because Hitoki prioritized his family over the band. &quot;I think it was the year after our major label debut, or maybe the year after that. He got married at the time when we were just getting started.&quot;, &quot;One time, he refused to appear on &quot;Music Station&quot;, saying he couldn&#x27;t because he had a family vacation planned that day (laughs). I was like, &#x27;Huh? What are you thinking?&#x27; I had heard of such stories about foreign artists, but I thought, &#x27;This is Japan! But Kiyoharu also acknowledged that Hitoki might have been frustrated as the vocalist took the lead in producing their music, &quot;I think he was frustrated that he could not do what he wanted to do.&quot;

Kiyoharu went on to form the rock band Sads in 1999. They released numerous material until taking a hiatus in 2003, and returning in 2010. Hitoki formed a unit called Hitoki-PiranhaHeads in 2000 which had several line-ups and various name changes. In 2004, he joined Super Drop Babies with former Kuroyume guitarist Shin.

On Kiyoharu&#x27;s 40th Birthday, October 30, 2008, it was announced that Kuroyume would officially be disbanded with a concert on January 29, 2009. On that day, the band held their last concert at the Nippon Budokan in front of 13,500 people. Hitoki said he and Kiyoharu had not spoken at all in the ten years since Kuroyume had stopped activities.

===2010–2015, 2025: Reunions===
On January 29, 2010, it was announced that Kuroyume would be revived and that they had begun recording a new album. It was initiated by the 2009 death of Masato Tōjō, former editor-in-chief of the music magazine &quot;Fool&#x27;s Mate&quot;, who was a supporter of Kuroyume since their indie days. The band signed to the Avex Trax record label, the same label that housed Kiyoharu&#x27;s solo work and Sads. Their first single since reforming, &quot;Misery&quot;, was set to be released on January 29, 2011, but was pushed to February 9. &quot;Fuck the Border Line&quot;, a tribute album to Kuroyume, was released on February 9. It features covers of the band&#x27;s songs by popular modern visual kei acts, such as Abingdon Boys School, Plastic Tree, The Gazette, Sid and Cascade. The duo then proceeded to release the singles &quot;Alone&quot; and &quot;Heavenly&quot; on May 25 and August 24, respectively. Following the relative success of these two singles, they released an album entitled &quot;Headache and Dub Reel Inch&quot; on November 2, 2011. &quot;Alone&quot; was selected by Capcom to be used in the advertisement campaign for &quot;Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D&quot;.

On March 26, 2014, Kuroyume released a single entitled &quot;Reverb&quot;, which peaked at the 11th position on Oricon charts. It was selected by Koei Tecmo and was used for the advertising campaign of &quot;Samurai Warriors 4&quot;.

In September 2016, four trademark rights related to Kuroyume were auctioned off by the Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau due to the rights holder&#x27;s (Kiyoharu&#x27;s Full Face Records) debt and failure to pay taxes. All four were sold to the same unknown winner; one sold for 681,000 yen, and the other three were sold for 200,000 yen. Kiyoharu&#x27;s manager said the singer wanted to buy the rights back from the unknown winner.

As part of Kiyoharu&#x27;s celebrations for his 30th anniversary in music, Kuroyume performed at the Tokyo Garden Theater on February 9, 2025.

<text>Joana Prado Belfort (born June 22, 1976) is a Brazilian-American businesswoman and former model.

==Early life==
Prado was born in São Paulo, daughter of engineer Jair Prado and Mercedes Prado and sister of Tiago Prado. While she was studying administration and foreign trade in college, she was model and girl advertising for brands like 775, Sexy Machine, and M.Officer.

Prado holds dual Brazilian and American citizenship.

==Career==
Prado worked as a model and during this period she also studied business administration with an emphasis on foreign trade. She was advertising girl of some brands like: 775, Sexy Machine, M.Officer and others. She began working on TV as a stage assistant for Luciano Huck&#x27;s Program H, at Rede Bandeirantes, later creating a character called Feiticeira (&quot;Sorceress&quot;), which made her known worldwide. At first, Prado had many difficulties with accepting the character, due to the conservative upbringing she received from her parents. She decided to leave her university education and take theater classes with Beto Silveira in order to better understand and incorporate the character, who later became Brazil&#x27;s greatest sex symbol in the 90&#x27;s.

Prado also became a reporter on a TV sports show called &quot;In Shape with Feiticeira&quot; on TV Bandeirantes, where she interviewed athletes from various sports about their daily training and interests. At the same time she participated in a radio show called &quot;Pânico&quot; as part of the broadcasting staff. Prado posed three times for the Brazilian &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, with the first time being the most sold issue ever (1,234,288 copies).

With the absolute success of her TV character, Prado began to appear in numerous advertising campaigns. In March 2002 she left TV Bandeirantes and went to SBT, where she participated in the second edition of reality show &quot;The House of Artists&quot;. On this reality show she re-established her relationship with the MMA fighter Vitor Belfort, whom she had already dated for 7 months in the year 2000. Prado finished fourth overall in the show.

After leaving the program Prado dedicated a year of her life to study radio, communication, and television, and in 2003 she was hired by RecordTV to join the Note &amp; Anote program as a reporter, where she worked for two years until her first son, Davi, was born.

In 2006 Prado returned to work on TV Bandeirantes, but this time as a reporter in the Pra Valer show, by Claudete Troiano, where she worked until the birth of Vitória, the couple&#x27;s second child. In the meantime, Prado encouraged Belfort to get himself back into shape as a MMA contender.

In 2009, Prado became pregnant with Kyara, the couple&#x27;s third and last child, and started presenting the web show called Absoluta, aimed at pregnant women. The goal of the show was to provide information about what to do and do not during pregnancy and to encourage natural birth, which is rare in Brazil. Kyara&#x27;s live birth on this program attracted a record number of viewers for a web show.

In 2014 Prado built the FortFit Academy in Barra da Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro. Currently known as Belfort Gym, the venture is a success with more than 500 customers practicing various types of activities such as CrossFit, martial arts, spinning, and Pilates, among others.

In 2017, Prado began investing in a new venture in Coconut Creek, Florida, the Belfort Fitness Lifestyle, a new gym model with a low investment and high profit concept.

Currently, Prado lives in Florida with her husband and three children. She runs the career of Vitor Belfort in cooperation with their team and lawyers. She also takes care of the family businesses, including real estate holdings and the gyms in Brazil and the USA.

<text>John Lewis Gilbert III (born July 13, 1928) is an American show business personality who has worked mainly on television game shows. Originally a nightclub singer and entertainer, he has hosted and announced a number of game shows from various eras, dating as far back as the 1950s. He is known primarily for his work as the announcer and audience host for the syndicated version of the quiz show &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; since its revival in 1984.

==Early life and education ==
John Lewis Gilbert III was born on July 13, 1928 in Newport News, Virginia. He began performing by singing as a boy in his hometown Lutheran Church choir. Although his parents had never worked in the theatrical profession themselves, his grandmother had been a church singer.

While he was still in high school, Gilbert decided to take up a professional singing career and learned from an opera teacher. He never sang opera independently, but was the regular vocalist with Shelly Harmon and His Orchestra, a group that toured the Virginia area.

==Career==
===Stage and early television career===
A few years after graduating from high school, Gilbert resided in Florida for three months working as an emcee, during which he received on-the-job training and learned to walk on stage, speak in front of a public crowd, and tell jokes and stories.

The Dead End Kids, a group comprising young actors such as Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, and Gabriel Dell, were organizing a revue. Gilbert joined the group and played throughout the southwestern United States for 16 weeks. When they played in Norfolk, Virginia, Gilbert got special billing.

In the 1950s, Gilbert joined the United States Army&#x27;s Seventh Army Special Services in Germany, and was cast as the lead in &quot;&quot;, an original musical comedy inspired in part by the Samuel Taylor Coleridge poem &quot;Kubla Khan&quot;, which chronicles Marco Polo&#x27;s trip to China. The company toured throughout Western Europe, performing for servicemen and civilians alike.

After resigning from the service and returning to the U.S., Gilbert continued singing and hosting in clubs. One day, a manager of a well-known group in Philadelphia asked Gilbert if he was interested in auditioning for television. He said yes, and received his first television assignment as a singer and emcee on WDSU in New Orleans.

===Hosting===
Gilbert went to New York City, where he quickly signed with the William Morris Agency and in 1958 received his first job on national television—as the host of a newly created game show, &quot;Music Bingo&quot;. The show ran for three years, airing first on NBC and then on ABC. His popularity on that show led him to record an album and several singles. Gilbert went on to emcee the local game show &quot;Words and Music&quot; on KTLA-TV in Los Angeles.

Gilbert was later contacted by Avco Broadcasting to host his own local talk/variety show, &quot;The Johnny Gilbert Show&quot;, which aired on WLWD-TV (now WDTN) in Dayton, Ohio, and three other Avco stations in Ohio and Indiana. The show was a 90-minute, live telecast running 5 days a week. It included celebrity guests and a 60-person studio audience. He hosted it for two years until he left Dayton on short notice for New York, where he became the host of the Metromedia-produced game show &quot;Fast Draw&quot;. His slot was then given to Phil Donahue, who at that time was a reporter in WLWD-TV&#x27;s news department.

After his year-long run on &quot;Fast Draw&quot;, Gilbert was contacted by Bing Crosby Productions to host the game show &quot;Beat the Odds&quot;, produced in Los Angeles by Bill Carruthers. After that, he hosted a local, weekday version of &quot;Dialing for Dollars&quot; on Los Angeles&#x27;s KCOP-TV.

=== Announcing ===

In 1963, Gilbert was selected by Mark Goodson to replace Don Pardo as the announcer and audience host for the original Bill Cullen-hosted version of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; when it moved from NBC to ABC. He hosted the show for the absent Cullen on June 19, 1964. Gilbert also served as the announcer and audience host for Dinah Shore&#x27;s syndicated daily talk show, which ran from 1974 to 1980.

When Merv Griffin decided to reintroduce his quiz show &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; to television in 1984 as a daily syndicated program, the new version&#x27;s host, Alex Trebek, convinced Griffin to hire Gilbert as announcer and audience host; Trebek had met Gilbert at a dinner party in the early 1980s and was impressed with his voice. Gilbert has held these two roles ever since. He has become well known for opening each of the show&#x27;s nightly episodes with the announcement, &quot;This is &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;&quot; After that opening line, he would introduce the two new challengers for the episode followed by the defending champion, stating the total winnings of the latter, before introducing the host. His additional duties have included announcing the fee plugs for the sponsors of the show (until 1996) and announcing consolation prizes offered to non-winning contestants (until 2002). As audience host, Gilbert handles warm-up duties, exciting the crowd before the commencement of taping.

In 2017 Gilbert was honored by Guinness World Records for having the longest career as a game show announcer for a single show, after 32 years with &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; This was commemorated with a rare on-screen appearance by Gilbert just before the Final Jeopardy! segment of the episode aired September 28, 2017 (season #34, show #7599, Austin Rogers&#x27;s 3rd win). He has also lent his announcements to most of the &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; video games since 1992, including a few game versions in which he voiced all of the clues and effectively hosted the entire game off-screen instead of Trebek.
Gilbert briefly considered retirement after Trebek&#x27;s death but chose to continue in the role. In recent years, Gilbert has handled much of his announcer load remotely, with a member of the Clue Crew providing in-studio announcements that are replaced with Gilbert&#x27;s in post-production. Since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Gilbert began doing his announcements in a studio built for him at his home. Since December 19, 2023, he also appears during the show&#x27;s opening titles. 

Alex Trebek died in 2020, and his final episodes aired in January 2021. Gilbert is the only person the daily syndicated &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; employed upon its 1984 launch to remain a part of the program&#x27;s cast or crew through 2024.

In addition to announcing for &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, Gilbert has worked as a guest announcer on its sister show, &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;. He announced on the episode that aired on April Fools&#x27; Day in 1997, as well as a few weeks of episodes in 2010 following the death of the show&#x27;s longtime announcer, Charlie O&#x27;Donnell. Gilbert also guest announced on &quot;Wheel&quot; in late 1995, when O&#x27;Donnell was ill, and on the daytime show in 1988 before the death of then-regular announcer Jack Clark.

Other game shows for which Gilbert has announced over the decades include &quot;The $1,000,000 Chance of a Lifetime&quot;, &quot;The $25,000 Pyramid&quot;, &quot;The $100,000 Pyramid&quot;, &quot;Anything for Money&quot;, &quot;Blackout&quot;, &quot;Camouflage&quot;, &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;, &quot;Dream House&quot;, &quot;Every Second Counts&quot;, &quot;Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Go&quot;, &quot;Headline Chasers&quot; (produced by Griffin), &quot;Jackpot&quot;, &quot;Jeopardy! The Greatest of All Time&quot;, &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot;, &quot;Make Me Laugh&quot;, &quot;Perfect Match&quot;, &quot;The Quiz Kids Challenge&quot;, &quot;Sports Challenge&quot;, &quot;Supermarket Sweep&quot;, &quot;Tic-Tac-Dough&quot;, &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot;, and &quot;Yours for a Song&quot;. He substituted for Gene Wood on several Goodson-Todman game shows, including &quot;Family Feud&quot;, the CBS version of &quot;Card Sharks&quot;, and &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot;. He succeeded Rich Jeffries (another part-time substitute for Wood) as permanent announcer of Chuck Woolery&#x27;s game show &quot;Love Connection&quot; during the 1988–89 season.

===Other roles===
Gilbert&#x27;s voice was heard on the CBS television special &quot;Circus of the Stars&quot;, in &quot;People&#x27;s Choice Awards&quot; and &quot;Emmy Awards&quot; ceremonies, and on episodes of the animated series &quot;The Angry Beavers&quot; and &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot;. He announced a fictional episode of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; in the &quot;Ellen&#x27;s Energy Adventure&quot; show at EPCOT Center&#x27;s Universe of Energy attraction, and appeared in a subplot of the 1992 movie &quot;White Men Can&#x27;t Jump&quot; in which a character played by Rosie Perez attempts to pass the &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; audition. Gilbert also lent his voice to an announcer in a 1989 episode of the TV series &quot;227&quot; and announced in &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; episode &quot;Questions and Answers&quot; (season 7, episode 17, on February 8, 1992) and in the &quot;Cheers&quot; episode &quot;What Is...

<doc id="1008081" wikidata="Q1132451" url="?curid=1008081" title="Nissan Sunny">
<text>The is an automobile built by the Japanese automaker Nissan from 1966 till 2004. In the early 1980s, the brand changed from Datsun to Nissan in line with other models by the company. Although production of the Sunny in Japan ended in 2004, the name remains in use in China and GCC countries for a rebadged version of the Nissan Almera.

In North America, the later models were known as the Nissan Sentra; in Mexico, the Sunny is known as the Nissan Tsuru, which is Japanese for the bird species &quot;crane&quot;. The latest versions of the Sunny were larger than the early models, and may be considered compact cars. Earlier versions (through at least the B11 series) were subcompact cars. All Sunnys through the 1982 model year (excepting the L-engined Sunny Excellents) used Nissan A engine motors. It was designed to compete with the Toyota Corolla.

The &quot;Sunny&quot; name has been used on other Nissan models, notably various export versions of the Nissan Pulsar model line. The Sunny has been imported and later manufactured worldwide under numerous names, and body styles, in economical, luxury and performance packages. Some configurations appear to be unique based on bodystyle appearances, but sharing a common platform. The Sunny was sold in Japan at a dedicated dealership sales channel called &quot;Nissan Satio Store&quot;, and rebadged versions later appeared at the other Japanese networks.


== First generation (B10; 1966) ==
The first Datsun Sunny, exported as the Datsun 1000, was launched in September 1966 with two body styles, a two-door sedan (B10) and a van/station wagon (VB10). The Sunny was an all-new product built on a dedicated platform called the &quot;B&quot; series that benefited from Nissan&#x27;s production of small cars since before the war and combined engineering efforts from newly acquired Aichi Manufacturing that met the goals set by Japan&#x27;s Ministry of International Trade and Industry &quot;national car&quot; program. These were available in both a &quot;Standard&quot; and &quot;Deluxe&quot; version, featuring drum brakes, conventional leaf springs at the rear and wishbone type independent front end. The front end used a single transverse leaf spring. In Japan the car was sold at a dealership sales channel established just for the Sunny, called &quot;Nissan Satio Store&quot;. The Sunny was introduced in the same year as the Toyota Corolla and Subaru 1000.

In December 1965, Nissan held a national campaign in Japan to name its newest product in a mail-in ballot, and after receiving over eight million submissions, the name Sunny was chosen after having been suggested 3,105 times and was announced on 19 February 1966 by Yoshisuke Ayukawa, Nissan Motors founder.

The car featured a four-cylinder in-line engine, the A10, with a total displacement of 988 cc and a four-speed gearbox. The 1968 model, introduced in October 1967, added to the lineup the four-door sedan (B10) in both DeLuxe and Standard form. February 1968 saw the release of the new coupé (KB10). Marketed as the &quot;Sunny Coupé&quot; in Japan, it was available in a wide variety of levels from &quot;Standard&quot;, to &quot;GL&quot; (&quot;Grand Luxe&quot;). The range of factory options and accessories was by this time vast. Total horsepower in the initial model was claimed to be at 6,000 rpm. The engine displacement was kept below 1.0-litre to keep it in the lowest Japanese road tax bracket and encourage sales.

It introduced a new approach for Nissan in the 1960s where all mainstream products shared a similar appearance, as demonstrated in the larger Nissan President and Nissan Bluebird.

The only other country that seems to have received the coupé is Australia, where it was marketed as the &quot;Datsun 1000 Coupé&quot;. It was well equipped, and was available only in the Deluxe level of trim. The Australian Deluxe model came standard with many inclusions that were available only as options in the Japanese model. The engine in the coupé had higher compression, a different Hitachi carburettor, and a dual outlet exhaust manifold. These changes increased its power output to ; a or 6.5 percent increase over the lesser models. Unlike the sedans and wagons, the coupé was only ever made in right drive.

July 1969 saw the release of the slightly different (cosmetically) 1970 model year, which left the 1969 model year run at only nine months. No additional models were added, and production ceased in December 1969, cutting the 1970 model year run at only six months.

=== B20 series (Sunny Truck) ===
The Datsun Sunny truck debuted in February 1967 and was the light commercial truck variation of the B10 passenger models. It was based on the VB10 van chassis, and is a body style which is sometimes referred to as a &quot;coupé utility&quot;, as the bed is not separate from the passenger area. The introduction of a pickup truck based on the Sunny gave &quot;Nissan Saito Store&quot; and &quot;Nissan Cherry Store&quot; Japanese dealerships the opportunity to sell a commercial vehicle that was originally only offered at &quot;Nissan Store&quot;. The 520 series Datsun Truck shared its platform with the Datsun Bluebird, plus the larger Nissan Junior sharing an engine with the Nissan Cedric; Nissan decided to duplicate the success it had with a Bluebird-based pickup truck for the new Sunny platform. The Sunny was engineered by newly acquired Aichi Machine Industry Co., Ltd., and gave the new acquisition the ability to demonstrate their profitability to their new Nissan owners. The Sunny truck dimensions were in compliance with Japanese Government dimension regulations and the small displacement engines reduced the annual road tax obligation. The B20 used the same wheelbase and running gear as does the Datsun Sunny VB10 van, and shared its dimensions.

== Second generation (B110; 1970) ==
The second-generation Nissan Sunny (B110) was launched in January 1970 and was known as the Datsun 1200 in export markets. This new model was slightly larger in all dimensions to match its market rival, the equally popular Toyota Corolla. The two companies continued a game of one-upmanship which had started when Toyota gave the Corolla an 1,100 cc engine and prominently featured the additional displacement over its Sunny rival. Predictably, Nissan responded by giving the second generation Sunny a 1,200 cc engine and a somewhat controversial marketing campaign with the theme &quot;the car next to me looks small.&quot;

The Datsun 1200 featured MacPherson strut front suspension with optional disc brakes and an economical 1.2-litre A12-series engine, an enlarged version of the A10 used in the B10-series Sunny. A five-door station wagon was added to the Sunny range in addition to the three-door wagon. In April 1970 a GX (Grand Luxury) trim with twin-carburetor engine was added for the Japanese market. In January 1972 a minor facelift occurred in the Japanese market with a new hood, grille and other small modifications and equipment fitting. In August 1972 the GX-5 model was added in Japan, which improved on the GX by fitting a direct-fifth (non-overdrive) five-speed manual transmission. The Sunny Coupé 1200GX was offered as an alternative to the Toyota Corolla Levin and Toyota Sprinter Trueno, which were performance package trim levels on the more economical Corolla and Sprinter models. For the 1973 model year, US models were re-specified with energy-absorbing bumpers, fire-resistant interiors and other government-mandated safety items.

The B110 made its racing debut at the Fuji 200-mile race on 23 November 1970 in the TS1300 class, a class dominated by the Toyota Corolla; only one works Nissan challenged Toyota yielding a victory for driver Makoto Suzuki.

In Australia and New Zealand, the Datsun 1200 was highly regarded for its effectiveness as a rally car. The Datsun 1600 generally rated highest among entry-level Datsuns, and the 1200 a close second. The 1200 also took road racing victories, such as winning Class A (for cars costing less than AU$1960) at the 1970 Bathurst 500.

In South Africa, the B110 was sold through 1976. A pick up derivative, featuring a 1400 cc engine, was sold until 2008 when emissions laws forced the end of its production. Over 275,000 were sold to customers who appreciated the rugged rear-wheel-drive design.

In New Zealand, a special edition Datsun 1200 SSS four-door sedan with twin side-draft Dell&#x27;Orto 40 mm carburetors, different camshaft, 5-slot aluminium wheels and cosmetic changes in both exterior and interior, it was assembled and marketed locally, about 800 were made. The 1200 was popular in New Zealand, where it was contract-assembled at a two factories (sedans at Campbell Industries in Thames; three-door wagons at Motor Holdings, Waitara). A small number of Deluxe sedans and more numerous coupes were imported from Japan. The car remained in NZ production well into 1974 as Nissan NZ was unsure how the public would react to the oddly styled 120Y successor.

===Europe===
In the UK the Datsun 1200 was the first Japanese car to sell in large numbers, being the company&#x27;s best seller there when its sales soared from just over 6,000 cars in 1971 to more than 30,000 a year later. The 120Y model, launched there in the autumn of 1973, helped take the brand from strength to strength, as did the smaller Cherry models. It was well equipped for its price with disc brakes and reclining front seats. This model established Datsun as the top Japanese exporter of cars to the United Kingdom.

In Portugal, Entreposto Comercial assembled the 1200 locally from 1972 until 1974. It was very successful in the Portuguese market, and dominated the local racing and rally scene. The 1200 was so popular in competition that a single-car racing series, the &quot;Troféu Datsun 1200&quot; (&quot;Datsun 1200 Trophy&quot;), was instituted and ran for several years. To capitalize on its competition success, a sporty Datsun 1200 S1 two-door sedan was also derived by Nissan&#x27;s local affiliate. The S1 made use of the free-flow exhaust from the Troféu cars, a modified camshaft, increased compression ratio, modified valves with double springs, polished cylinder head and manifold headers, and double carburetors. Power increased from the of the standard car to . Cosmetically, it received side stripes, wider wheels and tires, a sports steering wheel by De Moura, and a centre console with additional instrumentation.

In North America (US and Canada), over 133,000 Datsun 1200s were sold in the three model years they were available, 1971 through 1973. Coupé total sales were 89,541 and two-door sedan total sales were 43,761. The New York Yankees used a Datsun 1200 as a bullpen car in the 1970s.

The Datsun 1200 was rated the most fuel-efficient vehicle in the United States by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1973, in overall driving pattern. as rated by the government at The Sunny, however, was only rated the most fuel efficient as the EPA had not yet tested the Honda Civic. At its United States introduction, it had and of torque. These values dropped in 1972 as various power-sapping anti-smog measures were introduced.

=== PB110 series Coupé ===

In April 1971, halfway through the model year, the Sunny Excellent (PB110 series) coupé debuted for the Japanese market. It was based on the B110, but with new hood, fenders and grille, and featured a SOHC 1.4-litre Nissan L engine. The front overhang was extended to accommodate the larger P510 type radiator and the wheelbase by . The engine position was retained in the same position as the original A-series engine which further assisted the handling even though the engine was heavier. No changes were necessary to the firewall. The PB110 was offered in both GL (single carburetor) and GX models (twin carburetor). The larger PB110 was generally not exported.

At the Tokyo Motor Show, 19 October 1972, a Sunny Excellent with Nissan&#x27;s two-rotor Wankel rotary engine was exhibited, but never entered production. &quot;Wheels&quot; magazine drove this car on the race track.

=== B120 series (Sunny Truck) ===
The B120 commercial truck debuted in February 1971, based on the B110 passenger car chassis. The B120 used the same wheelbase and running gear of the Datsun 1200 sedans, coupé and wagon models. Initially it used the same stainless steel grille as the 1200 sedan, and the rectangular gauges of the Standard model B110s. Both regular (B120) and long-bed (GB120) models were offered. After the 1200 car series ceased production the B120 continued. In certain markets such as South Africa, the B120 was actually badged as the &quot;120Y&quot; and sold as part of the updated 120Y range. It was assembled locally and marketed in New Zealand during the 1980s in two trims: &quot;RoadStar&quot; and &quot;SportStar&quot;. It was capable of . B120s were not sold in North America, partly due to the US &quot;Chicken Tax&quot; and partly because perceptions of vehicle size meant that the 620/720 series were considered small pickups.

In 1978, in the Japanese market, the B121 model replaced the B120, with the most notable change being a switch to a plastic grille of the type used by the B110 coupé. Also notable was a change to upscale round instrumentation. The B120 was particularly successful in South Africa. In 1977, for instance, it was the most sold commercial vehicle of any type there. It continued in production there long into the 21st century. It received a very mild facelift in 1978, with a new grille and taillight treatment, as well as interior upgrades.

In November 1989, an updated B122 and GB122 (longbed) models replaced the B121. Prominent among changes was a switch from round headlights to rectangular ones (along with a new grille to accommodate this change). Other significant changes include:
* front disc brakes
* catalytic converters
* conforming (emission controlled) A12 engine were installed in the RB122 and RGB122 models.

=== B140 series (Bakkie) ===

The Sunny Truck was sold in South Africa for a total of 37 years after having been launched there in 1971. The B140 variation, with 1.4-litre A14 engine, was manufactured up until 2008 by Nissan South Africa as the Nissan LDV 1400 (Light Delivery Vehicle). The 1400 Bakkie saw many changes in its long career. The main ones were a five-speed manual gearbox, power assisted disc brakes, and a roof height extension to accommodate taller South Africans. The 1400 Bakkie was replaced late in 2008 by the NP200, a rebadged Dacia Logan Pick-Up. A major departure for the Nissan bakkie is that the new model is front-wheel drive (FWD), whereas the original was rear-wheel drive (RWD) – a major selling point of the vehicle in South Africa where it was the only RWD bakkie in its class for many years. A long-standing marketing credo was &quot;put the power where the load is&quot;. 

== Third generation (B210; 1973) ==
Exported as the Datsun 120Y and Datsun B210 (in North America), the third generation (1973–1978) Sunny was extremely popular as it debuted during the 1973 oil crisis. It was first shown on 1 May 1973 in Japan, as the 1.2 or the 1.4-litre Excellent. Both engines were offered in two different levels of output, from the lowest powered 1.2 to the Excellent GX Coupé. Six body styles were offered: the four-door sedan, two-door sedan, two-door fastback, three-door wagon, five-door wagon, and a three-door van. The coupé retained its fastback styling, but now featured a full hatchback door rather than the small trunk lid of the previous generation Sunny. The wagon and van were not offered in North America. In 1975, Japan models were fitted with emission control technology, called Nissan NAPS to be in compliance with Japanese Government emission control regulations enforced that year.

The related Sunny Excellents continued until 1976 as PB210 models, at first fitted with a 1.4-litre L14 engine. American market B210s were the first Sunnys to have the larger collision bumpers, due to the USA&#x27;s safety standards at the time. Other markets continued with the more tightly fitted chrome bumpers. In most markets, the B210 line featured as the only engine option a re-designed A12 engine. As usual for Japan, the wagon (three- and five-door models alike) was marketed as a van for commercial use, where it was only available with the lowest-powered 1.2 engine (VB210). The van, in its lowest standard equipment level, came equipped with a three-speed manual gearbox with a column-mounted shift lever.

This chassis formed the basis for the S10 underpinning the Nissan Silvia coupé, which allowed Nissan to sell the Sunny Coupé at two Nissan Japanese dealership networks. The Sunny was exclusive to &quot;Nissan Satio Store&quot;, while the Silvia was exclusive to &quot;Nissan Prince Store&quot;, alongside the Nissan Skyline.

=== Facelift (B211) ===
B211 is the chassis code for the minor facelift of the B210, introduced in February 1976. It included a changed grille and other minor changes, such as new wing mirrors and hubcaps. The most important differences were under the hood, where the engines had been upgraded to meet Japan&#x27;s 1976 emissions standards. The Sunny Excellent now only came fitted with the larger 1.6-litre engine, with the more compact A14 engine replacing the L14 and being installed in the regular bodied model (HB211). The Excellent&#x27;s chassis code changed from PB210 to GB211 and was now considered a trim-level option for the regular B211 rather than as a separate model. Although regular production in Japan as well as sales in most countries ended in late 1977 for the 1978 model year, the B210 series continued to be produced by Nissan South Africa through 1980. The van models were not replaced until later.

=== Export markets ===


==== North America ====
The Datsun B210 continued to be the fuel-economy leader in North America and it was one of the least expensive cars available. This was in part due to the light metal; small A13 or A14 engine with OHV technology and a very basic vinyl interior used in its construction. Introduced for 1974 with a 1.3-litre four, this was replaced by a larger and more powerful 1.4-litre version for 1975. This engine remained in use, continuing to be installed in the next generation B210. At the time, their body styles were popular with buyers – mainly the hatchback coupé as the sedans were considered by some to be less appealing. Datsun dealers were instructed to describe the coupé as having &quot;the image of a Mini-Z-Car&quot;. The 1978 B210 (American model) with five-speed transmission was rated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency at highway fuel economy.

&quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; was somewhat critical of the B210 in their 1975 test . They criticized the &quot;modest performance&quot; of the &quot;peppy&quot; engine, but were impressed with its fuel economy. B210 pricing started at US$2,849 that year. The &quot;Datsun Honeybee&quot; was a special edition sedan consisting mostly of appearance parts. Nonetheless, the Honeybee is now considered a collector&#x27;s car among Datsun enthusiasts.

US-market models were fitted with these A-series engines (years given are model years):
* 1974: A13 engine, 1.3 L (1288 cc) OHV I4
* 1975–1978: A14 engine, 1.4 L (1397 cc) OHV I4. Power in 1975 was (SAE Net) in 49-state versus California trim - the regular version took leaded fuel and depended on an EGR system for air cleaning, while the unleaded California cars have a catalytic converter. Gross horsepower ratings are 80 and 78 respectively.

A highly modified &quot;ground effect&quot; 120Y fastback coupé is the fastest Datsun/Nissan in the world. Tom Burkland&#x27;s &quot;411 To Bonneville&quot; held the B/BFCC record at Bonneville from August 1985 to August 2011 with a speed of . SCTA records

==== Oceania ====
Despite earlier misgivings, the 120Y, when finally launched in New Zealand in 1974, proved popular with Nissan NZ. It eventually assembled some cars in a temporary CKD plant in the Auckland suburb of Mount Roskill, before the new plant in Wiri was completed later in the decade. Four-door sedans and three-and five-door wagons were built locally and were supplemented by some coupés imported built-up from Japan.

The 120Y was assembled from kits in Melbourne, Australia and boasted disc brakes (although not power assisted), alternator, 4 speed gearbox, radial tyres, radio and mud flaps as standard, most of which were options on other makes. The modest performance and strictly conventional design were offset by excellent fuel economy and a better standard of build. The 120Y was sharply criticized by magazines such as &quot;Wheels&quot; of Australia, which felt that it offered no true improvement on its predecessor. That was not surprising given that the B110 platform was carried over, but used a slightly revised A12 engine. Like some Nissans of this period, it was considered overstyled. In New Zealand and Australia there was also the &quot;Datsun 120Y SSS&quot; limited edition B210, which had minor aesthetic differences to the regular B210 and same engine upgrades as in B110 1200 SSS (twin carbs, camshaft).

==== South Africa ====
In the South African market the B210 was assembled locally from December 1975 until 1983, replacing the previous &quot;Datsun 1200&quot;. South African &quot;Y-series&quot; cars, as they were called locally, also featured &quot;L14&quot; and &quot;L16&quot; engine options, as well as two special editions of B210 coupé, badged as the 140Z and 160Z. The 140Z featured a high performance camshaft, freeflow exhaust and twin 40 mm Dell&#x27;orto carburettors, while the 160Z featured twin Hitachi (SU type) carburetors. Both had four-speed transmissions. The standard 120Y has the 1171 cc &quot;A12&quot; engine as already used in the 1200, with at 6000 rpm. The well-equipped 140Y GX had a 1428 cc &quot;L14&quot; motor and was also available as a two-door liftback coupé. The only other bodywork available at the time of introduction was a four-door sedan; later a four-door wagon joined the lineup. All South African Datsun Y&#x27;s received the longer Sunny Excellent front sheet-metal, allowing the fitting of the &quot;L14&quot; engine. In October 1976, a version of the 140Y with a three-speed automatic transmission appeared, which had a engine.

During 1978 the Y-series received a facelift, which mostly consisted of a retouched front grille. Datsun-Nissan South Africa also decided to fit the bigger &quot;L16&quot; engine. This motor, now with DIN ratings, produced in GX specifications and in the 160Z. The 140Y sedan received the new &quot;A14&quot; engine, while the 140Y station wagon retained the earlier &quot;L14&quot; unit. The 160Z appeared in November 1978, with 120 cars built that year, and 121 built in 1979.

==== Europe ====
When introduced in the UK, the 120Y quickly gained popularity, further strengthening Datsun&#x27;s position, helping it to gain second place amongst foreign imports. The car&#x27;s popularity was helped by high equipment levels for a car of this size, while also being competitively priced as well as Datsun cars have a reputation for being reliable, while at the same time UK-manufactured cars were in short supply due to the regular strikes and stoppages affecting British car plants. British Leyland was particularly hard hit by these crises, while at the same time several of its model ranges were gaining a reputation for being unreliable and badly-built.

== Fourth generation (B310; 1977) ==

This was the last Sunny sold under the &quot;Datsun&quot; brand in Japan. The final rear-wheel-drive Sunny from model year 1978 to 1982 featured numerous variants, including a fastback station wagon as well as more squared-off, utilitarian models with three and five doors, a coupé, and two- and four-door sedans. They were first introduced in October 1977, going on sale on 21 November in Japan. The design received a certain amount of criticism, with &quot;Car Styling Quarterly&quot; calling it old-fashioned and dumpy at the rear, while the plastic detailing was referred to as overworked. It was, however, recognizable as a Nissan house design. This generation was also the last Sunny to utilize the front engine and rear-wheel drive layout.

At home they only received the new A12A engine and the slightly larger A14, although the Van continued to receive the earlier, smaller, A12 engine. The &quot;Excellent&quot; trim package was discontinued as the top level model, and the B211 van continued to be built for a little while longer. In Japan in February 1978 the Sunny Coupé 1400SGX-E and the 1400GX-E appeared, as a replacement for the previous Sunny Excellent Coupé. The &quot;E&quot; denotes multiport fuel injection, an option offered only in Japan.


These models appeared with Datsun 120Y, 130Y&quot;, &quot;140Y and 150Y badges in some markets (reflecting the engine size) though Sunny was increasingly used for export, too. The North American version was marketed as the Datsun 210. The B310 was known for its high equipment levels and build quality at the time. It was available with the same A-series engines as its predecessor although the B210&#x27;s optional 63-series five-speed transmission was replaced with the more compact and lighter 60-series unit, with a standard gear pattern. On all body variants except the Van and &quot;squareback&quot; wagon, the leaf spring rear suspension was replaced by a more advanced coil spring four-link configuration, while the front had struts with coilover springs. Other than that, the chassis was very similar to that of the B210, albeit with a beefier front suspension and a relocated fuel tank in the sedans. It was now beneath the floor of the trunk, freeing up more space for luggage. The body was designed to provide fewer moisture traps, helping protect the car against rust, while added width meant additional space, particularly for the rear seat passengers.

In October 1979, the B310 was given a mild facelift, with a smoothed off front end, a grille with square headlamps, and a redesigned dashboard. The vans retained the old design, but their chassis codes (unlike the passenger models) changed from 310 to 311 to reflect that they met new emissions standards in place for light commercials. At the end of November 1980 the A12A and A14 engines were replaced by the marginally larger A13 and A15 versions in the Japanese markets (with available fuel injection for the A15). The slow-selling two-door sedan was reduced to the low-cost 1300 CT and DX models. At the end of 1981 passenger car versions of the B310 were replaced by the front-wheel drive B11 Sunny, although the Vans continued to be built for a few more years. With the end of passenger car production in October 1981, the Van models chassis codes was changed and they became the VB312 series.


In North America, the only wagon offered was the fastback version. In Japan, this fastback wagon was a special model called the &quot;Sunny California&quot;, aimed at private buyers unlike the square-backed 3-and 5-door Sunny Van (although for the Japanese market these vans were always fully glazed and usually had a back seat) meant for the long-standing Japanese commercial wagon market. In most other markets the more traditional two-box wagon was offered, either alone or alongside the fastback, and some countries where &quot;no rear side glass&quot; was part of a legal definition of a &quot;light truck&quot; got panelled-in versions of the three-door. The van versions also differed in that they retained the leaf spring suspension from the B210, and in most markets had a more spartan interior trim with vinyl covered seats. The five-door van was discontinued in November 1982 when the new and even boxier Nissan AD range was introduced. In July 1983, the AD appeared in a three-door version, meaning that the VB310 was finally retired.

This model marked the first and only time the &quot;Sunny&quot; name was used in Australia. This chassis, along with the A10 chassis on the 160J/Violet/Stanza formed the basis for the S110 chassis on the Nissan Silvia.

In most markets, the A12 engine was the only, or most common engine offered. However B310s in various markets were fitted with the following A-series engines (JIS outputs are for the Japanese market, others indicated):
* A12 (1171 cc), JIS at 6000 rpm, DIN (Europe)
* A12A (1237 cc), JIS at 6000 rpm
* A13, (1270 cc Short Deck Engine), JIS at 6000 rpm
* A14, JIS at 6000 rpm, DIN at 5600 rpm (Europe)
: A14E, fuel injection and JIS at 6400 rpm
* A15 (from late 1980), JIS at 5600 rpm, DIN at 5200 rpm (Europe)
: A15E, fuel injection and JIS at 6000 rpm

=== Datsun 210 (1979) ===
In North America, the Datsun 210 engine line ups were as follows:
* 1979: A12A (late introduction) or A14
* 1980–1982: A12A, A14 or A15
The 210 was available in North America as a two- or four-door sedan, a five-door wagon (the sloping fastback style), or as a three-door hatchback coupé. At the time of introduction all models, excepting the wagon with the automatic transmission, received the carryover 1.4 litre A14 engine with . The automatic wagon (soon all wagons) received the somewhat larger A15 engine with .

New for 1981, the special &quot;210 MPG&quot; model was a small-port A14 (losing three horsepower in the process) with five-speed overdrive transmission and achieved per US standards. For 1981, this was the only 1.4 available. All other versions excepting the standard 1.2 received the larger 1.5. Even the most powerful 1.5-litre option produced only , being strangled by the required desmogging equipment. The smallest 1.2 was only available as a four-speed, two-door sedan with very basic equipment. The 1.2 Standard was only available with a four-speed manual transmission and produces .

The 210 continued to be available until April 1982, when it was replaced by the Sentra, a rebadged version of the B11 Sunny.

=== YLN 302/303 ===
In Taiwan, Yue Loong continued building the B310 series until the 1990s as a lower priced alternative to more modern Sunnys. Originally introduced as the YLN 302, with SD or DX equipment (Standard, DeLuxe) it underwent a facelift in 1981 in parallel with Nissan&#x27;s Sunny, becoming the YLN 303. After another facelift (in 1989), it became the YLN 303S. The station wagon was also offered in Taiwan, as the YLN 303W. The Yue Loong-built B310s were only ever available with the 1.2-litre A12 engine.

== Fifth generation (B11; 1981) ==

Introduced in late 1981 (at the Tokyo Motor Show), the B11s were the first front-wheel-drive Sunnys, predating by a year and a half the switch to front-wheel drive by their main Toyota Corolla rival, and were exported to the United States as the Nissan Sentra from the 1982 model year onwards. European sales began in May 1982, with this version of the Sunny going on sale at a time when front-wheel drive was quickly becoming the most popular layout on family cars in Europe. The B11 series shared its engines and much of its underpinnings with the Nissan Pulsar (N12) which launched around the same time, effectively providing the hatchback body style in this size class which in the European market was becoming the widely preferred configuration. Because the Sunny and Cherry/Pulsar had grown substantially to fill this market need, the supermini size class was filled by the Nissan Micra/March that also launched the same year. Ultimately, the Sunny and Cherry/Pulsar lines converged in the European market for the N13 generation in 1986.

The chassis code returned to the original &quot;B&quot; designation, then added &quot;11&quot; to signify a new start. The B11 was the first Sunny to be available with a diesel engine, the CD17 of 1.7 litres. Most markets received 1.3 or 1.5-litre four-cylinder engines, although for some markets with strict taxation (such as Greece), the 1-litre E10 engine was also available. The 1.3 and 1.5 as sold in Europe have respectively.

The fuel injected 1.5 L turbo was introduced to Japan only September 1982, offered only in the 3-door hatchback body style, and was called the &quot;Sunny Turbo Leprix&quot;, and was rarely exported. The installation of a turbo on the top level model enabled Nissan to offer a performance version without unduly increasing emission tax liability for Japanese buyers, while offering higher fuel efficiency and lower emissions than a larger, conventionally tuned engine. The turbo and the diesel were both later additions to the lineup, having been presented in September 1982. The Sunny Turbo Leprix was sold in the United Kingdom as the &quot;Sunny Maxima Coupe&quot;, alongside the &quot;Sunny Maxima&quot; sedan.

A further spin-off from the Sunny line was the Nissan Laurel Spirit (in Japanese), which was essentially a rebadged and better equipped Sunny sedan designed to capitalize on the premium image of the larger Nissan Laurel. The Laurel Spirit was exclusive to &quot;Nissan Store&quot; which sold the Laurel, while the Sunny remained exclusive to &quot;Nissan Satio Store&quot;. The Laurel Spirit was offered in four trim packages, starting with the LT, LT-G, LF, XJ, and the XJ-E denoting a fuel injected &quot;E15E&quot; engine. In 1983 the top level XJ was installed with a turbocharger, designated as the Laurel Spirit Turbo XJ.

The Laurel Spirit was exported as the &quot;Nissan Sunny Maxima SGL&quot;, which was sold in limited numbers in the United Kingdom. This was not in any way related to the much larger &quot;Bluebird Maxima&quot; (which was simply just sold as the &quot;Maxima&quot; in the United States). The &quot;Sunny Maxima&quot; line consisted only of upgrades such as a sunroof, enhanced exterior trim, only available with a five-speed manual, chrome tailpipe, dual waveband radio meeting United Kingdom radio authority specifications, and deluxe carpeted floor mats. The B11 Sunny was originally sold in the United Kingdom in 1.3 DX, 1.3 GL, 1.5 DX, 1.5 GL, 1.5 GL Auto, 1.5 SGL and 1.5 SGL Spirit variants.

In 1982, the Sunny platform was used to introduce a new MPV body style in Japan, called the Nissan Prairie. It was introduced at &quot;Nissan Store&quot; locations and went on to be sold globally, although this concept did not take off in Europe until the huge success of the Renault Scénic in the late 1990s.

The B11 series was regarded as one of Nissan&#x27;s most modern ranges at the time, and was the first to abandon the Datsun name formally (though a small &#x27;Datsun&#x27; still appeared on boot lids for the first two years). The wagon was known in its home market as the &quot;Nissan Sunny California&quot;, and Nissan installed the turbocharged engine in October 1983 for Japanese customers only. It was launched in late 1981 and continued into 1985. After the succeeding B12 had been presented, the B11 Sunny soldiered on as the &quot;Sunny 130Y&quot; as a lower-cost alternative in certain export markets, including Malaysia; production there continued well into the nineties. While a hatchback version was available for a little while in Japan (and very briefly in North America), this body style was built in comparably small numbers as the Pulsar generally replaced the hatchback in most markets. The two-door sedan was only sold in North America, with Sentra badges.

The station wagon model remained in production until 1990, as no estate version of the next generation Sunny was produced.

===Foreign production===
====Latin America====
The B11 was sold as the Nissan Tsuru in Mexico, a nameplate used until 2017 when it was discontinued and replaced with the Versa. It was the first car sold as a Nissan in Mexico. Also, the three-door hatchback coupé was known as the Nissan Tsuru Samurai. For 1986, the 1.5 L engine was replaced by the 1.6 L and for 1987 the Tsuru Samurai received a sporty version called the Nissan Ninja Turbo which included a low boost turbocharger with carburetor and prominent Ninja stickers on the low side of the doors. The regular Sunny Coupé was also sold as the &quot;Nissan Ninja&quot; in 1987, equipped with the E16S while the locally developed turbocharged version of that engine (E16T) with .

Mexican-made B11s were exported to other Latin American markets as well. They entered Chile in 1987 (replacing the Japanese-made Sunny which had been on sale since 1983), carrying &quot;Sunny&quot; badging. In Chile it was mainly sold with the E13 and E15 engines, although a handful of the turbocharged 1.6 were also delivered as the &quot;Sunny Ninja Turbo&quot; and the 1.7-litre diesel was available in the sedan model for a few years. The B11 Sunny was the most sold car in Chile in 1989 and 1990 and continued to be available alongside the B12 as well as the B13 Sunnys; these were sold as the &quot;Sentra&quot; and the &quot;V16&quot; so as to separate them in the marketplace. The B11 was available in Chile until August 1991.

==== Taiwan ====
As usual, Nissan&#x27;s Taiwanese subsidiary Yue Loong assembled a local version of the B11 Sunny. It was available as a four-door sedan or a five-door wagon, with 1.2-, 1.3-, and 1.5-litre engines. It was marketed as the YLN 311 SD or GX, depending on equipment levels. Taiwanese Sunnys were fitted with the larger bumpers as used in the North American markets; it is unknown why this is the case.

=== Nissan AD ===

A five-door station wagon on Sunny basis meant for use as a delivery van was also introduced. This had different bodywork from the Sunny California wagon and was called the Nissan AD Van in the domestic market. It was also exported to many countries, usually with &quot;Sunny Van&quot; badging. It used the E15S, the E13S, and the CD17 diesel engine.

== Sixth generation (B12; 1985) ==

Introduced in September 1985 at the Tokyo Motor Show, the B12 was not as widely exported, apart from the station wagon model and to some extent the RZ-1 coupé. This line is characterized by its squared-off styling, which was rather unfashionable by the mid-1980s. The angular styling was insisted upon by Nissan&#x27;s design chief at the time and contributed to the automaker&#x27;s increasingly poor sales of the period. A four-wheel-drive variant was introduced during this generation.

In October 1986, European markets saw the B11 Sunny replaced by a rebadged N13 Pulsar in hatchback and saloon form (the hatchback replacing the previous N12 Pulsar, which had been sold as the Cherry in this market). These were sold alongside the B12 Sunny estate and coupé. In some markets, such as Greece, the N13 Pulsar retained the &quot;Cherry&quot; nameplate. In the UK the B12 was sold as the Nissan Sunny Estate with a 1.6L engine. The B12 Coupé (RZ-1) was also imported, with either 1.6 L or 1.8 L 16v engines.

When first introduced, Japanese-market Sunnys received 1.3 or 1.5-litre E-series petrol inline-four engines, or the 1.7-litre CD17 diesel unit. In mid-September 1987, the E15 was replaced by the new GA generation, cleaner and with more power. This was also the first Sunny to become available with optional anti-lock brakes. A twin-cam 1.6 was also added, at first only to the sporting 306 hatchback but later also in the four-door sedans. Abroad, a few other engine variations were also available, up to a 1.8-litre twin cam in Europe.

The &quot;Sunny California&quot;-style fastback was the only B12 wagon; the more upright B11 &quot;Sunny Van&quot; continued in those markets where it was previously offered. The station wagon continued in its second generation as the Nissan Wingroad and the commercial AD Van.

In Kenya (East Africa), the B12 was imported and marketed as Sunny and came with a 1.3- or a 1.5-litre petrol engine. The 1.3-litre version is assembled locally (1.3 SLX).

In Mexico the B12 Sunny was known as the Nissan Tsuru II (as the preceding generation was simply called Tsuru) and equipped with a 1.6-litre petrol engine. This model was later also exported to Canada where it carried &quot;Sentra&quot; badges.

The B12 series Sentra remained the mainstream C-segment Nissan in North America throughout its run, although the models available dwindled over the years. At launch, sedans were available in two-door base or XE or 4-door XE or GXE models, along with two trim levels each of the coupé and FWD wagon, a short-overhang three-door hatchback and an AWD wagon; by 1990 only one model each of the coupé, four-door sedan and FWD wagon, plus two two-door sedans (one with the same trim as the others and one extra-basic price leader) remained.

In Malaysia, it was known as the Nissan Sentra Super Saloon (early version) and came with the E16 engine. It was often used as a taxi and rental car. The B12 was replaced there by the Pulsar N13 in 1987. The Sentra badge was also used in a few other markets such as the Philippines and New Zealand.

=== Laurel Spirit ===
In Japan, the Nissan Laurel Spirit continued to be offered at &quot;Nissan Store&quot; locations as a Sunny-based companion to the larger, more luxurious Nissan Laurel, with all-wheel-drive added to the Laurel Spirit&#x27;s option list. The styling of the Laurel Spirit drew heavily from the larger Laurel, to further distance it from its more humble Sunny counterpart, and included the hood ornament from the Laurel to the smaller car. To help set it apart from its lower-priced brethren, the Laurel Spirit was only available with four-door bodywork in higher equipment levels, and not with the 1.3-litre engine.

=== Sunny RZ-1 (Coupé) ===

In February 1986, Nissan introduced the Sunny RZ-1 coupé, with RZ representing &quot;Runabout Zenith-1&quot;, as Nissan was already using the &quot;Z&quot; for its sports car, the Fairlady Z. The Sunny RZ-1 replaced the Sunny Turbo Leprix coupé. The RZ-1 was sold in Mexico as the Nissan Hikari, which is Japanese for &quot;bright&quot; or &quot;sunny&quot;. It was marketed as a completely different model from the Tsuru (Sunny sedan) and it was Nissan&#x27;s sports flagship car as it was even offered with a low-boost Turbo.

As with previous B series Sunny generations, the chassis was common with the wagon and sedan, with specific appearance to the RZ-1, while maintaining the traditional fastback associated with the Sunny Coupé. The Sunny hatchback and sedan were introduced with a square appearance, while the RZ-1 was more angular, with a more sharp appearance. The interior could only accommodate four people, with a black mask between the front headlights, retaining the strong slant angle, adding blistered front and rear over the wheels, and a wrapped around window treatment for the rear hatch, that had hit a different personality hatchback and sedan. The angular approach was also used on the Nissan EXA, which appeared internationally at the same time, and earlier on the Nissan Leopard.

Initially, the engines offered to Japanese customers were the E15S type (1500 cc straight-four SOHC), and the E15ET type (a turbocharged, fuel injected version of the same), but in August 1986 the CA16DE type (1600 cc straight-four DOHC) was added. Nissan introduced something called the &quot;TWINCAM series&quot; and the &quot;TWINCAM NISMO&quot;, this included special suspension and aero parts that offered Japanese customers a customized specification, offering special interior appearances, including power windows that were not available on lower trim packages. In export markets it was mostly sold as the &quot;Sunny Coupé&quot;, but export markets generally did not receive the higher trim packages available in Japan.

In Europe, the Sunny Coupé was also available with the larger, 1.8-litre 16V twin cam CA18DE engine. In an unusual move, this was more powerful than any option available in Japan, where such a model was seen as a possible threat to sales of the Silvia series. A limited number were also manufactured in South Africa with this engine, carrying Sentra badging.

== Seventh generation (B13; 1990) ==

The B13 was introduced in 1990 and retained much of the B12&#x27;s design language and packaging but in a more rounded, up-to-date body. It was particularly successful in the United States where the sporting two-door Sentra SE-R was marketed by Nissan of America as a latter-day BMW 2002. The car continued in production in Mexico until 2017, where it was sold as &quot;Tsuru&quot;, for domestic and export markets. The Tsuru was quite popular among cab drivers for its reliability and low maintenance costs. The Mexican-built Tsuru was exported to Chile and Peru, where it was sold as the Nissan V16 to distinguish it from the B11 and B12 which were both still available. In Taiwan, it is known as the Nissan 331. The Nissan Sunny California wagon was discontinued and replaced with the Wingroad, a small family wagon based on the Sunny AD commercial delivery van.

In Mexico, the Nissan Tsuru was until 2017 the best-selling car in its category, as it is much bigger and has cheaper maintenance than its direct competitors: the Pointer and the Chevrolet Chevy C2. The 2007 model was available in two trims; GS 1 (base) and GS 2. Both trims use a 1.6-litre 16-valve (GA16DNE) engine producing and can be equipped with an automatic gear-box and air-conditioning (Tsuru GS 2). A new Nissan Tsuru GS 1 costed approximately . It was discontinued in May 2017, due to the car not being compliant with new Mexican car safety regulations. A special edition called &quot;Buen Camino&quot; was sold to celebrate the end of the Tsuru in Mexico. According to Nissan, there are no plans for a successor for the Tsuru, with the Versa being sold as a 2018 model as its successor.

In Malaysia it was known as the Sentra Super Saloon and was offered in two version, both fitted with the GA16DE engine.

In Japan, the Laurel Spirit was renamed the Presea, continuing to be a luxury-based Sunny companion to the Laurel, both exclusive to &quot;Nissan Store&quot; locations.

The Sunny Sports Coupé was replaced by the ovoid NX internationally.

== Eighth generation (B14; 1993) ==
The B14 Sunny and Sentra appeared in December 1993 and were produced until 1998, and featured four-wheel-drive variants. Other than Japan, this variant was produced in Karachi, Pakistan through a joint venture between Ghandhara Nissan and Nissan Japan till 2001 for the local and export markets.

In this generation, the station wagon was supplied to Mazda under an OEM deal as the Familia Van. The Nissan Wingroad range appeared as a spin-off of the Sunny line in Japan, denoting a highly specified station wagon that replaced the Nissan Sunny California. Both the Familia and the Wingroad had different front and rear ends compared to the wagon that was exported. The luxury version of the Sunny, called the Presea, continued to be offered at &quot;Nissan Store&quot; Japanese dealerships.

Nissan Mexico sold versions of this as the Sentra with a 1.6 engine GA16DE from 1995 to 1997, GA16DNE from 1998 to 2000 and 2.0 engine (SR20DE) in the GSS version (top of the line). Asian market cars, including Middle East nations, were also available with the 1.4-litre GA14DE engine.

Thailand and other selected Asian countries had this model of B14 from 1994 until 2000 with a few minor changes along the way. First minor change shows when the rear changes to split the red strip into two sides, next the face changes in a few years with a small ridge in the middle of the hood and a chromium decoration on the hood tip, finally the last minor change, the tail light style changes from two layers of white/red to be the three layers red/white/red. The two variants of engines are either 1.5 (in the first generation) or 1.6 litres&#x27; displacement (available only after some minor changes).

All models were equipped with multi-link beam suspension for the rear.

=== Nissan Lucino ===

In 1995, Nissan reintroduced the 200SX nameplate in United States and Canada to designate a two-door version of the Sentra (B14 chassis, a front wheel drive car), known in Japan and Mexico as Lucino, replacing the Sentra coupé and NX (discontinued in 1993). The 200SX came in base, SE, and sportier SE-R models. All shared their front-end appearance, front-drive chassis, dashboard, and many dimensions with the Sentra and Japanese-market Lucino. Base and SE editions shared the Sentra&#x27;s twin-cam GA16DE engine four-cylinder engine. The SE-R inherited the 140-horsepower 2.0 L SR20DE engine used in the previous 2-door Sentra SE-R. All three came with a 5-speed manual transmission or 4-speed automatic, and were equipped with dual airbags. Antilock brakes were optional in the SE and SE-R.

== Ninth generation (B15; 1998) ==

The B15 series was the last Sunny, produced from October 1998 to the end of 2004. A facelift was launched in May 2002. In 2004 in Japan, the Nissan Tiida (C11) and Nissan Bluebird Sylphy (G11) replaced the Sunny, marking the end of an almost 40 year long production life.

While earlier North American-market Nissan Sentras were very similar to their Japan-market B-series Nissan Sunny twins, the B15 Sentra (2000–2006) is diverged greatly from the B15 Sunny. The Sentra B15 took styling cues from the Nissan Bluebird Sylphy (G10/N16), while the Sunny B15 body had a more traditional squared-off three-box sedan design.

In Japan, the B15 Sunny was offered with 1.3, 1.5, 1.6, and 1.8-litre petrol or 2.2-litre diesel engines. In North America, the B15 Sentra was offered with 1.8, 2.0 and 2.5-litre engines, and carried on the B-series Sunny/Sentra lineage with the B16 Sentra.

The Wingroad station wagon and the badge engineered Mazda Familia Van (1.3, 1.5 and 1.8-litre) continued to be spun off from the main Sunny range. A facelift for the Wingroad in 2002 gave it a new front end treatment, though the rear was much the same. The two-door variant was discontinued internationally.

Renault Samsung Motors, a South Korean Automaker planned to use this vehicle for their R-Car project. However, Renault acquired Samsung Motors and announced that the R-Car would be rebranded as the SM3, although it ended up being based on the related Nissan Bluebird Sylphy.

== Other versions ==
Although the Nissan Pulsar and Bluebird Sylphy ranges (N-series family) were a separate model line with different heritage from Sunny (B-series family), for various reasons the Sunny name was—in some markets—applied to various Pulsar/Sylphy vehicles.

=== N13 (1987–1991) ===
The Nissan Sunny name was used on the Nissan Pulsar (N13) in Europe from 1987 to 1991, which was introduced as a replacement for both the Nissan Sunny B11 Sunny and N12 Cherry.

=== N14 (1991–1995) ===
The Nissan Pulsar N14 series was introduced in 1990 in Japan and in 1991 for Europe, badged as the Nissan Sunny. It was replaced by the Nissan Almera N15 in 1995 which was itself a rebadged version of the Nissan Pulsar N15 series.

=== N16 (2000–2011) ===
Although the Bluebird Sylphy G10 did not spawn a Sunny range in Japan, it was sold as the Sunny Neo in Thailand and as the Sunny in Hong Kong, Kenya, Singapore, Sri Lanka and the People&#x27;s Republic of China, where it is produced by the Dongfeng Motor Company, a joint venture with Nissan. Also, the N16 series was sold in parts of Latin America and in Europe as the Nissan Almera. The N16 series was also sold in Bangladesh through Pacific Nissan dealers in the EX Saloon trim, from 2001 to 2011, with two minor facelifts.

In Sri Lanka, Nissan sold the Bluebird Sylphy G10 as the Nissan Sunny N16 in two trims: EX saloon and Super Saloon. While there were differences in measurements and exteriors, the interiors were mostly the same. Nissan offered various models with different nameplates like Bluebird, Sylphy, and Cefiro, each having modified specifications. It&#x27;s important to note that these nameplates didn&#x27;t exactly match the global models with the same names. The EX saloon had a black grill and was offered with the 1.3 L QG13DE engine. 

From the 2007 model year, its platform changed to the Renault Samsung SM3, that is sold in parts of Europe as the Almera Classic. Also since 2007, the Renault Samsung SM3 is sold as the Nissan Sunny in the Middle East, with a solitary trim that comes with a 1.5-litre engine.

=== N17 (2011–2020) ===
The N17 series Sunny was unveiled at the 2010 Guangzhou International Motor Show in China. Sales began in 2011. It was also sold in the Indian and many Middle Eastern markets under the same name. Other names include the Almera in Southeast Asia and the Versa in Americas.

=== N18 (2020–present) ===
The N18 series Sunny was unveiled in the United Arab Emirates at the Dubai International Motor Show in November 2019.

<doc id="1008089" wikidata="Q12060453" url="?curid=1008089" title="Holy Brook">
<text>The Holy Brook is a channel of the River Kennet that flows through the English town of Reading. While of considerable historical significance, the origin and nature of the brook is still unclear. It is probable that some parts of the channel are natural, while other parts were created in medieval times by the monks of Reading Abbey to supply water mills and fish ponds. John Speed&#x27;s map of Reading (c.1610) shows the brook flowing in the open air throughout, but a map from 1835 shows the town centre section to have been largely culverted by then, as is the case now.

The Holy Brook leaves the main channel of the Kennet at a brick structure known as the Arrowhead near the village of Theale, and flows to the north of the main channel until rejoining it just downstream of the centre of Reading. The channel is some in length, of which approximately are culverted.

== Course ==

For the first stretch of its route, the channel forms the boundary between the Reading suburbs of Beansheaf Farm, Fords Farm, Calcot, Southcote and Coley Park (all to the north of the brook), and the Kennet flood meadows (to the south). At Calcot, the brook passes Calcot Mill, one of two water mills that were driven by the brook and which originally belonged to the abbey. In this area the channel gives its name to the nearby civil parish of Holybrook. In some stretches, especially behind Coley Park, the brook is noticeably embanked along the hillside above the lower water meadows, demonstrating its artificial origins. Once past Coley Park the Holy Brook flows through the Victorian suburb of Coley, before reaching the town centre. At Coley, an overflow weir diverts excess water back to the Kennet, at a point which was once the site of a lido.

In the centre of Reading, the Holy Brook is culverted for several stretches, only showing itself intermittently. The channel can clearly be seen where it flows under one of the entrances to the Oracle shopping centre, where it has given its name to the &#x27;Holy Brook Mall,&#x27; the lower of the two enclosed shopping malls within the centre. It is also visible for about 10 metres in the rear yard of the Purple Turtle bar and for a couple of metres outside the front door of Reading Central Library. The culverted sections of the Holy Brook involve a number of different construction techniques from various ages. The most notable section, behind the buildings on Castle Street, is grade II listed and built of ribbed limestone blocks that may be reclaimed stone from Reading Abbey. Other sections include brick vaults, iron-girder roofing, concrete culverts, and modern corrugated steel construction.

At its eastern end, once it has passed under the Central Library, the Holy Brook re-emerges into the open, at a point where it once formed the southern boundary of Reading Abbey. Here the brook provided the driving force for the Abbey Mill, of which only vestiges remain, as well as supplying water to the Abbey&#x27;s necessarium. Today the brook passes between the backs of modern office blocks before re-entering the north channel of the River Kennet where the latter makes a right-angle turn immediately to the south of the ruins of the Abbey church.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measures the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish, and chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations. Chemical status is rated good or fail.

<doc id="1008091" wikidata="Q3506674" url="?curid=1008091" title="Switch (ad campaign)">
<text>Switchers was an advertising campaign launched by Apple Computer on June 10, 2002. It featured what the company referred to as &quot;real people&quot; who had &quot;switched&quot; from the Microsoft Windows platform to the Mac. An international television and print ad campaign directed users to a website where various &quot;myths&quot; about the Mac platform were &quot;dispelled&quot;. The television commercials were directed by Errol Morris.

==Switchers==
A young woman who appeared in the commercials, Ellen Feiss, became an internet celebrity. Feiss was a friend of Morris&#x27;s son Hamilton Morris, who also appeared in a commercial.

Localized versions of the commercials, with local &quot;switchers&quot;, aired in Iceland and Japan.

Certain ads featured celebrities, such as Tony Hawk, DJ Q-Bert, Yo-Yo Ma, Kelly Slater, Will Ferrell and members of De La Soul.

==Campaign==
The Switch campaign, while distinctive, was not very effective, and was gradually phased out in 2003. This can be somewhat blamed, however, for the Macintosh lineup as the iMac G3 was becoming obsolete while the new iMac G4 that was showcased was considerably more expensive than comparable Wintel offerings. The advertising concept of the Mac&#x27;s advantages over the PC was dropped in favor for the Get a Mac campaign in 2006.

Due to the simplicity of the ad, many parodies surfaced on the net shortly after the campaign started. Most of the parodies lamented features they had lost due to the switch, such as the ability to play popular computer games and use of the right mouse button. In what seemed like a parody, but was not, Microsoft&#x27;s marketing team created a web page titled &quot;Confessions of a Mac to PC Convert&quot;, but Microsoft removed it for being fraudulent and misleading, even to the point of having a stock photograph used.

The background music of the Switch Ads is &quot;Spit&quot; by John Murphy. The music was produced for TBWA Chiat Day by Kendall Marsh of Mental Music Productions, Sherman Oaks, CA.

<doc id="1008093" wikidata="Q7511074" url="?curid=1008093" title="Siena Heights University">
<text>Siena Heights University (SHU) is a private Catholic university in Adrian, Michigan. It was founded by the Adrian Dominican Sisters in 1919.

==History==
The institution was founded for women in 1919 as St. Joseph&#x27;s College by the Adrian Dominican Sisters. In 1939, it was renamed as Siena Heights College, after Saint Catherine of Siena.

In 1969, it became coeducational. In 1998, after expansion of graduate studies, it was renamed Siena Heights University. The sisters minister in 29 states, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and in seven countries outside the United States.

The college seal uses the Dominican Shield of the International Order of Preachers, consisting of four white and four black gyrons or triangles. These symbolize the unity of a body of people working together for the common good. The &quot;cross fleury&quot; (or cross with fleurs de lis at each end) superimposed on the gyrons, signifies victory, duty and self-sacrifice. The sable (or black of the shield) symbolizes wisdom, silence, fortitude and penance. The light color signifies peace, purity, charity and sincerity. The motto surrounding the shield, &quot;Laudare, Benedicere, Praedicare,&quot; means &quot;to praise God, to bless His people and to preach His gospel&quot;. The shield may also be surrounded by the six- or eight-pointed star that is the distinguishing symbol of St. Dominic.

Siena Heights remains affiliated with and sponsored by the Dominican Sisters of Adrian, Michigan. It is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.

==Campuses==
The main campus has 55 acres with 17 buildings in Adrian, Michigan. SHU is across town from Adrian College. The main campus has the distinction of being the first all wireless college or university in the state of Michigan. There are satellite campuses in Dearborn, Benton Harbor, Monroe, Battle Creek, Kalamazoo, Lansing, Jackson, and online.

==Academics==
The university has more than 40 academic programs of study between the College of Arts and Sciences, the College for Professional Studies, and the Graduate College. Its most popular undergraduate majors, in terms of 2021 graduates, were:
::Business Administration &amp; Management (95)
::Criminal Justice/Safety Studies (46)
::Registered Nursing/Registered Nurse (38)
::Community Organization &amp; Advocacy (36)
::Accounting (34)
::Health Services/Allied Health/Health Sciences (30)
::Radiologic Technology/Science – Radiographer (30)

Siena Heights also provides classes for high school students through dual enrollment. This gives juniors and seniors who meet certain criteria to get college credit and experience while still in high school, getting students a step closer to going to college and learning about college life and class work. The student-to-faculty ratio is 12:1.

==Athletics==
The Siena Heights athletic teams are called the Saints.

<text>The Battle of Đồng Xoài () was a major battle fought during the Vietnam War as part of the Viet Cong (VC) Summer Offensive of 1965. It took place in Phước Long Province, South Vietnam, between June 9 and 13, 1965.

In 1964, South Vietnamese General Nguyễn Khánh had overthrown General Dương Văn Minh in a military coup. Khánh took control of the South Vietnamese government and its military junta, but he implemented laws that limited the freedoms of the civilian population, and this alienated the South Vietnamese people. After a falling-out with the Catholic faction within his own government, Khánh became increasingly reliant on the Buddhist movement in order to retain control. Consequently, on February 20, 1965, Khánh was ousted and was forced to emigrate.

The political instability in Saigon gave North Vietnamese leaders an opportunity to step up their military campaign in the south. They believed that the South Vietnamese government&#x27;s power relied on the country&#x27;s strong military, so the North Vietnamese People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and VC launched the Summer Offensive of 1965 to inflict significant losses on South Vietnamese forces. In Phước Long Province, the PAVN/VC summer offensive culminated in the Đồng Xoài campaign.

The fight for Đồng Xoài began on the evening of June 9, 1965, when the VC 272nd Regiment attacked and captured the Civilian Irregular Defense Group and U.S. Special Forces camp there. The Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) Joint General Staff responded to the sudden assault by ordering the ARVN 1st Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment, 5th ARVN Infantry Division to retake the district of Đồng Xoài. The ARVN forces arrived on the battlefield on June 10, but in the vicinity of Thuận Lợi, the VC 271st Regiment overwhelmed the South Vietnamese battalion. Later that day, the ARVN 52nd Ranger Battalion, which had survived an ambush while marching towards Đồng Xoài, recaptured the district. On June 11, the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion arrived to reinforce the South Vietnamese position; as the paratroopers were searching the Thuận Lợi rubber plantation for survivors from the 1st Battalion, the VC caught them in a deadly ambush.

On June 13, U.S. Army General William Westmoreland, fearing that the VC might secure enough area to establish a large base in Phước Long Province, decided to insert elements of the U.S. 173rd Airborne Brigade into a major battle for the first time. By then, however, the VC had already withdrawn from the battlefield, and the U.S. paratroopers were ordered to return to base without having engaged with the North Vietnamese.

== Background ==
In January 1964, General Khánh ousted General Dương Văn Minh as the leader of South Vietnam&#x27;s military junta in a bloodless coup. Although Khánh had made considerable efforts to consolidate his power, opposition to his rule began to grow as he tightened censorship laws, banned protests and allowed police arbitrary search and imprisonment powers. Khánh drafted a new constitution, which would have expanded his power within the military junta. In response to Khánh&#x27;s political manoeuvres the South Vietnamese people, predominately Buddhists, held large demonstrations in the cities calling for an end to the draconian laws which had limited the people’s political freedom. Fearing that his power could be weakened by those demonstrations, Khánh immediately repealed his constitution and new police powers. He promised to reinstate civilian rule and remove members of the Catholic-based Cần lao from power.

Internally, the concessions made by Khánh had the effect of unsettling Catholic officers such as Nguyễn Văn Thiệu and Trần Thiện Khiêm, because they were concerned by what they perceived to be the handing of power to Buddhist leaders. Subsequently, Khiêm fell out with Khánh over policy issues along religious lines, even though an alliance between both men had enabled Khánh to remove Minh from power. As military support for his regime diminished, Khánh had to rely upon civilian Buddhist activists to maintain power. For the Americans, Khánh&#x27;s increased reliance on the Buddhists was a cause for concern, because the Buddhists favoured a political resolution to the conflict with the Communists. Thus, by the end of 1964 the Americans looked for someone to overthrow Khánh, in order to continue the military effort against the Communists. On February 20, 1965, Khánh was finally removed from power, and he was forced to leave South Vietnam.

From the Communist perspective, even though South Vietnam was plagued by political instability, it still had a strong army to resist the VC. So shortly after the Binh Gia campaign, North Vietnamese leaders reached a resolution to launch a summer offensive, to destroy the regular units of the South Vietnamese military. During the early stages of the Communist summer campaign, VC forces in Quảng Ngãi Province successfully destroyed a South Vietnamese task force, led by the ARVN 51st Infantry Regiment, in the village of Ba Gia. Following their victory at Ba Gia, the VC turned its attention to the Mekong Delta region. To prepare for their next offensive, Major-General Le Trong Tan was given the task of directing VC military operations in the provinces of Phước Long, Bình Phước. For the first time, the newly created VC 273rd and 274th Regiments was ordered to join the 271st and 272nd Regiments on the battlefield; their objective was to destroy the regular units of the South Vietnamese military and eliminate the strategic hamlets to enlarge what North Vietnam viewed as liberated zones and that, in view of the forced relocation, the compulsory labor, the fund diversion by corrupt officers and the burning of old villages implied, were labelled by Noam Chomsky &quot;virtual concentration camps&quot;.

== Prelude ==
Since May 1965, the VC offensive in Phước Long Province had been in full-swing. Beginning on May 10, the VC 271st Regiment, supported by the 840th Battalion and local sapper units, attacked the district town of Phước Long, capital of the province. Simultaneously, the VC 272nd Regiment overran South Vietnamese government positions in the sub-sector of Phước Bình. During their brief occupation of Phước Long district, the VC destroyed several major strategic hamlets in the surrounding areas, such as Ba Ra, Thuan Kiem, Thuan Loi, Phu Rieng, Da Kia, Bu Dop, Duc Bon and Song Be.

In response to the VC occupation of Phước Long district, the ARVN 36th Ranger Battalion was ordered by the ARVN Joint General Staff to recapture government positions there. On May 11, two companies from the battalion sustained heavy casualties in battles with VC units positioned along Inter-Provincial Road 13 and National Highway 14. On May 12, the Viet Cong 271st Regiment and other support units withdrew from Phuoc Long district.

In the Phước Bình sub-sector, the VC 272nd Regiment were able to overrun South Vietnamese government positions within 25 minutes, and they claimed to have killed 115 South Vietnamese soldiers in the process. At 9 am on May 11, the ARVN 34th Ranger Battalion was airlifted into a small town located about 14 kilometres away from Phước Bình in the south-east. As the ARVN 34th Ranger Battalion marched upward towards Phước Bình, the VC 272nd and 273rd Regiment was ordered to destroy the Rangers. However, by the time the 272nd Regiment arrived at the South Vietnamese staging area, the Rangers had already pulled out and successfully recaptured Phước Bình. Meanwhile, on May 15, the VC 274th Regiment defeated two South Vietnamese Regional Force companies along Route 20 and destroyed 20 vehicles in the process.

After those operations in Phước Long district and Phước Bình sub-sector, the VC 9th Division was ordered to attack Đồng Xoài. In 1965, Đồng Xoài was a district town situated at a road junction which connected Inter-Provisional Road 13, National Highway 1 and Highway 14. The district was defended by 200 local Vietnamese soldiers drawn from the 327th and 328th Militia Companies, and the 111th Regional Force Company. They were supported by one armoured squadron (6 armoured vehicles) and two 105 mm howitzers. There were also 400 soldiers from 3 companies of the Civilian Irregular Defense Group, 11 United States Army Special Forces personnel and nine men of Seabee Team 1104. Prior to the battle, the U.S Special Forces had assumed control of Đồng Xoài&#x27;s defences; they stepped up guard and patrol activities, and ordered the construction of new defensive fortifications around the district headquarters, the Special Forces Camp and the armoured and artillery positions on the eastern side of the district.

== Battle ==
On the evening of June 9, 1965, the VC made final preparations for their assault on Đồng Xoài. While the VC assembled their formations, U.S.-led forces inside the Special Forces Camp were suddenly placed on alert, forcing the VC to commence their attack 70 minutes earlier than scheduled. At 23:30, VC heavy mortar rounds began to fall on South Vietnamese and American positions around Đồng Xoài, soon followed by an infantry assault led by the 272nd Regiment. During the initial assault, the VC sustained heavy casualties as they tried to navigate through the surrounding minefields and barb wire fences, which they had failed to pick up during previous reconnaissance missions. At about 01:30, two helicopter gunships from the U.S. Army&#x27;s 118th Aviation Company were dispatched to support the Special Forces Camp, they fired on the VC around the compound, and returned to base only after their weapons load was emptied. At around 2:30 am, the Americans and a few of the Cambodian soldiers retreated to the district headquarters, where other local troops were holding out. Meanwhile, at Biên Hòa Air Base, all flight crews of the 118th Aviation Company were on the flightline preparing for combat assault at first light. By that time, however, the VC had captured the Special Forces compound, and they began massing for an attack on the district headquarters.

While fighting raged inside the district, all flyable aircraft from the 118th Aviation Company flew out from Biên Hòa to Phước Vinh, a small town about 30 kilometres from Đồng Xoài. From Phước Vinh the first contingent of the ARVN 1st Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment, was airlifted into the battlefield. At around 08:00, the UH-1 formations of the 118th Aviation Company descended on the landing zone near the Thuận Lợi rubber plantation, about 4 kilometres north of Đồng Xoài; they immediately began to receive fire from bunkers and foxholes surrounding the area. The South Vietnamese command believed the landing zone near Thuận Lợi would be ideal to land their troops, because it was distant enough that the VC would not find and engage them immediately. However, the VC had anticipated the South Vietnamese would land troops in the area, and had prepared for an ambush. As a result, after U.S. helicopters had departed from the landing zone, soldiers of the VC 271st Regiment immediately turned their attention on the South Vietnamese. Within 15 minutes the main body of the ARVN 1st Battalion was completely destroyed.

At around 11:55, the last remaining soldiers of the ARVN 1st Battalion were disembarked near the original landing zone in Thuận Lợi, and they too were put out of action within three minutes of touching down on the field. During the afternoon, the VC had managed to destroy parts of the district headquarters building using their 57 mm recoilless rifle. Second Lieutenant Williams then ordered 14 Americans inside the building, along with an equal number of Vietnamese women and children, to retreat to the artillery position located east of the town where they continued their resistance. Late in the afternoon on June 10, the U.S. 118th Aviation Company was joined by other elements of the 145th Combat Aviation Battalion in their final sorties for the day; airlifting the ARVN 52nd Ranger Battalion from Phước Vinh into Đồng Xoài, with the objective of recapturing the road junction and the Special Forces Camp. Following their last mission, the 118th Aviation Company immediately returned to Biên Hòa. During the first day of heavy fighting, every helicopter in the unit had sustained damage, including the loss of one helicopter and its entire crew.

At 15:20, the ARVN 52nd Ranger Battalion were discharged on a landing zone about 3 kilometres south of Đồng Xoài. As the Rangers marched towards the town centre, their lead company was decimated in an ambush mounted by elements of the VC 271st Regiment. Undeterred by the strength of the VC, they continued their march towards the district. On the night of June 10, the battalion began attacking VC positions around the Special Forces Camp, and they gradually recaptured the compound and much of the town. The VC eventually launched a counter-attack in an attempt to win back the lost ground, but they failed to dislodge the soldiers of the ARVN 52nd Ranger Battalion. The next morning, on June 11, the 118th Aviation Company was back at full strength in Phước Vinh. Like the previous day, they flew air-support and airlifted further reinforcements from the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion. After the Airborne troopers were dropped off on a soccer field, the 118th Aviation Company started large-scale evacuation of South Vietnamese casualties. In contrast to the previous day, the 118th Aviation Company encountered only isolated rear guard actions.

Just before the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion landed on the battlefield, the VC had intercepted a radio conversation between the aforementioned unit and the 52nd Ranger Battalion in the district centre; several months earlier the 7th Airborne Battalion was involved in the Battle of Binh Gia, so they vowed to avenge the loss of their comrades. Thus, from the soccer field, the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion marched up to Thuận Lợi, against only light opposition. The Airborne arrived at the area where the first group of the ARVN 1st Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment, was dropped off and they collected seven survivors and 55 bodies. In the afternoon, as elements of the 7th Airborne Battalion moved through the Thuận Lợi rubber plantation to search for remnants of the second group of the ARVN 1st Battalion, the VC 271st Regiment started attacking the Airborne in a manner which had characterised earlier ambushes. Taking advantage of the poor weather conditions that had limited U.S. air strikes, as well as their numerical superiority, the VC broke the South Vietnamese formation into small groups and destroyed many of them. On the next day, the strength of the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion was reduced from 470 to just 159 soldiers.

After the defeat of the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion, U.S. General William Westmoreland concluded that the VC still had the strength to continue the attacks on Đồng Xoài. In contrast, South Vietnamese forces within the vicinity of Đồng Xoài were severely depleted, and did not have sufficient strength to defeat the VC. Furthermore, there was only one remaining battalion in South Vietnam’s strategic reserve, and it may not be enough to drive the VC out from the area if it was committed.

Westmoreland was unwilling to leave the VC with a position from which they could dominate Phước Long Province. So, on June 13, he made the decision to insert U.S. combat forces from 173rd Airborne Brigade. Subsequently, 738 men of the 1st Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment, were flown out to the staging area in Phước Vinh. Elements of the 3rd Battalion, 319th Field Artillery Regiment also followed later in the day. Upon arrival at Phước Vinh, the U.S. Army task force waited for five days, but it soon became apparent that the VC had withdrawn from the area and had no intention of holding territory. On June 18, the 1/503rd Infantry was ordered to return to base.

== Aftermath ==
In this battle both sides of the conflict had paid a heavy price to achieve their objectives. After the battle, search parties found several hundred VC bodies within small arms range of the Special Forces compound and district headquarters, and another 126 VC bodies inside these compounds. Numerous other VC casualties had been evacuated or incurred in the fighting beyond the town&#x27;s borders. In their efforts to recapture the district town of Đồng Xoài, the South Vietnamese military lost 416 soldiers killed in action, 174 wounded and 233 missing. Total casualties sustained by U.S. military personnel included 29 soldiers killed or wounded, and 13 missing. According to Vietnam&#x27;s official account of the Đồng Xoài campaign, from May to July 1965, they claimed to have put 4,459 enemy soldiers (including 73 Americans) out of action. Furthermore, 1,652 weapons of various kinds were captured, 390 weapons and 60 vehicles were destroyed, 34 aircraft and 3 helicopters were shot down.

Even though the VC had won a victory over the regular ARVN units, according to ARVN estimates, they suffered considerable casualties. VC soldiers usually sought to evacuate their dead and wounded comrades, but they struggled to evacuate their casualties as conditions on the main roads deteriorated during the rainy season. The Đồng Xoài campaign marked the rapid maturity of the VC 9th Division as a fighting force. For their efforts during the battle, the VC 272nd Regiment received the title of &#x27;Đồng Xoài Regiment&#x27;.

Six days after large-scale fighting in Đồng Xoài had concluded there was another change of government in Saigon. South Vietnamese Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ was appointed prime minister and executive chairman of the government by the military junta and General Nguyễn Văn Thiệu became a figurehead president. Unlike previous leaders, Kỳ and Thiệu were more interested in fighting the Communists, and they intended to stop the Buddhist factions from interfering with their decision-making processes. However, due to Kỳ&#x27;s lack of experience in civil government, the Americans were not entirely pleased with the formation of a new government with him as the leader. In contrast, Thiệu&#x27;s appointment to the office of president was considered to be a positive development by the American Embassy and military command, because he possessed the political skills required by Saigon’s political establishment. Nonetheless, Kỳ&#x27;s ascension to the position of prime minister had effectively ended the cycle of military coups which had plagued Saigon since the downfall of Ngô Đình Diệm.

In a significant contrast to the political scene in South Vietnam, the North Vietnamese government were more occupied with their military effort. The North Vietnamese Transportation Group 559, then under the leadership of Major-General Phan Trong Tue, was ordered to open new transportation and communication lines through southern Laos and South Vietnam to facilitate the movement of troops and material through the Pathet Lao-occupied section of the Ho Chi Minh trail. They were supported by 1,500 workers from the Ministry of Transportation and 7,600 volunteers. By the end of 1965, the strength of Group 559 had grown to 24,400 personnel organised in six battalions of motor vehicles, one battalion of boats, 18 battalions of combat engineers, four battalions of anti-aircraft artillery and guard units. In addition to the expansion of their logistical abilities, the North Vietnamese also decided to establish five infantry divisions and one artillery in South Vietnam. Thus, the stage was set for a major military struggle with American and other allied forces.

<text>Peter Farrelly and Bobby Farrelly, collectively referred to as the Farrelly brothers, are American screenwriters and directors. They have made eleven films together, including &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot;.

==Early life==
The brothers were raised in Cumberland, Rhode Island, and are of Irish descent. Following college, they pursued careers as television writers, notably for &quot;Seinfeld&quot;.

==Themes==
Each of the brothers&#x27; first four films (&quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;, &quot;Kingpin&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot;, and &quot;Me, Myself &amp; Irene&quot;) has a plot centering on a road trip. These trips all originate in Rhode Island, except for &quot;Kingpin&quot;, which begins in Pennsylvania. Their films make frequent use of slapstick and toilet humor, and are often populated with blunt, profane working-class characters in small roles. Many of their films contain flashback scenes that show how a character was affected by a traumatic event. The brothers are also noted for their soundtracks, which typically feature distinctive selections of classic and contemporary power pop and folk rock songs.

Sports are a common feature of their films and they have often cast sports stars (particularly from New England teams) for bit parts and cameo appearances, including Cam Neely, Johnny Damon, Roger Clemens, Brett Favre, Anna Kournikova, and Tom Brady.

The brothers have been praised and critiqued for the way they use the subject of disability in their films. Peter Farrelly has commented: Peter Farrelly has published books, including &quot;Outside Providence&quot; and &quot;The Comedy Writer&quot;.

<doc id="1008130" wikidata="Q169896" url="?curid=1008130" title="Status of Gibraltar">
<text>Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory, located at the southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula, is the subject of a territorial claim by Spain. It was captured in 1704 during the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714). The Spanish Crown formally ceded the territory in perpetuity to the British Crown in 1713, under Article X of the Treaty of Utrecht. Spain later attempted to recapture the territory during the thirteenth siege (1727) and the Great Siege (1779–1783). British sovereignty over Gibraltar was confirmed in later treaties signed in Seville (1729) and the Treaty of Paris (1783).

Reclamation of the territory became government policy under the dictatorial regime of Francisco Franco, and this policy has remained in place under successive governments following the Spanish transition to democracy. The Gibraltarians themselves reject any such claim and no political party or pressure group in Gibraltar supports union with Spain. In a referendum in 2002 the people of Gibraltar rejected a joint sovereignty proposal on which Spain and the United Kingdom were said to have reached &quot;broad agreement&quot;. The British Government now refuses to discuss sovereignty without the consent of the Gibraltarians.

In 2000, a political declaration of unity was signed by the members of the Gibraltar Parliament; according to the Gibraltar government, &quot;In essence the declaration stated that the people of Gibraltar will never compromise, give up or trade their sovereignty or their right to self-determination; that Gibraltar wants good, neighbourly, European relations with Spain; and that Gibraltar belongs to the people of Gibraltar and is neither Spain&#x27;s to claim nor Britain&#x27;s to give away.&quot;

Spain insists on a bilateral agreement with the UK over sovereignty, whereas the UK will only discuss sovereignty if Gibraltar is included in the discussions.

The United Nations understanding of the positions of each party is set out in their 2016 report. The UN currently lists Gibraltar as a Non-Self-Governing Territory.

==Capture of Gibraltar and the Treaty of Utrecht==
Gibraltar was captured in 1704 by a force led by Admiral Sir George Rooke representing the Grand Alliance on behalf of the Archduke Charles, pretender to the Spanish Throne. After the battle, almost all of the inhabitants decided to leave. Spanish attempts to regain the territory in the Twelfth Siege of Gibraltar failed, and it was eventually ceded to the Kingdom of Great Britain by Spain in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht as part of the settlement of the War of the Spanish Succession. In that treaty, Spain ceded to Great Britain &quot;the full and entire propriety of the town and castle of Gibraltar, together with the port, fortifications, and forts thereunto belonging ... for ever, without any exception or impediment whatsoever.&quot;

Should the British Crown ever wish to relinquish Gibraltar, a reversion clause holds that the territory would first be offered to Spain, &quot;And in case it shall hereafter seem meet to the Crown of Great Britain to grant, sell or by any means to alienate therefrom the propriety of the said town of Gibraltar, it is hereby agreed and concluded that the preference of having the sale shall always be given to the Crown of Spain before any others.&quot;

Furthermore, the Treaty stipulates &quot;that the above-named propriety be yielded to Great Britain &quot;without any territorial jurisdiction&quot;, and without any open communication by land with the country round about&quot; (although there is dispute over whether this disclaims territorial jurisdiction over Gibraltar, or over the &quot;country round about&quot;) and that no overland trade between Gibraltar and Spain is to take place, except for emergency provisions in the case that Gibraltar is unable to be resupplied by sea. The British Government and the Government of Gibraltar have argued that the membership of both Gibraltar and Spain in the European Union (EU) — Gibraltar was included as a Special member state territory when the United Kingdom joined the EU in 1973; Spain joined the EU in 1986 – superseded such restrictions as the EU is committed to free movement of goods and services. The effect of Brexit on Gibraltar is unclear.

==Differing positions ==
The United Nations regards Gibraltar as a Non-Self-Governing Territory administered by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Its report of February 2016 sets out the differing views of the various parties relating to Gibraltar.

The &quot;Gibraltar Constitution Order 2006&quot; (UK) established a form of government for Gibraltar, with the governor of Gibraltar being responsible for the conduct of external affairs, defence, internal security and for certain appointments to public office, and the Government of Gibraltar being responsible for all other matters. The UK believes that as an independent territory, recognised by the United Nations, Gibraltar enjoys the individual and collective rights that are set out in the 2006 constitution and the right of self-determination.

Spain disputes the legality of the 2006 constitution and claims that it does not change the status of Gibraltar as a British colony with only the UK having right to discuss Gibraltar matters at the international level.

The territorial government of Gibraltar, based on law in the 2006 constitution, collects its own taxes and budgets its costs and capital expenditure, with maximum personal tax rates of 28% and company tax of 10%. Spain notes that the European Commission is investigating the tax regime of Gibraltar and that Spain considers Gibraltar a tax haven. The UK believes Gibraltar meets all EU laws relating to anti-money-laundering, direct taxation and financial supervision.

Gibraltar has a robust financial regulation system with anti-tax-evasion agreements including exchange of tax information agreements with 79 countries including all the EU countries, except Spain which has not responded. The UK asked for Gibraltar to be subject to an EU evaluation of its anti-money-laundering controls. Spain recalls that crimes of tobacco smuggling and money-laundering from Gibraltar had been noted in an EU anti fraud report in 2014.

Crossing the land border between Gibraltar and Spain is subject to checks. Spain stresses that checks are not politically motivated, it being necessary to ensure strict compliance with EU border regulations to counter the common illicit trafficking issues and that Spain complies with the recommendations from the EU to improve the border crossing. The location of the checkpoint does not conform to the border recognised by Spain. The airport is a military area where civilian aircraft are permitted to operate. Spain claims the airfield is occupied illegally by the UK. The UK claims its sovereignty extends over the isthmus area on which the airfield is built. The UK also claims a three-mile limit in the territorial waters around Gibraltar whereas Spain claims maritime rights to all areas except inside the ports on Gibraltar. UK claims of incursions of Spanish vessels into Gibraltar territorial waters are considered by Spain to reflect routine activity of Spanish ships in their own waters.

In 2004 a system of trilateral discussion began with Spain, the UK and Gibraltar participating. The discussions ended in 2010 with the UK and Gibraltar asking for their continuance from 2012 to 2014. Spain stating they believed the forum no longer existed and that only &quot;ad hoc&quot; discussions on local issues should take place with Campo de Gibraltar also included.

In 2015 the UK reaffirmed its claim to sovereignty, that Gibraltar had its right to self-determination set out in the 2006 constitution and that the UK would not enter into any sovereignty discussions unless Gibraltar agreed and further that the UK was committed to safeguarding Gibraltar, its people and its economy. The UK claimed sovereignty over land extended over the sea to a limit of three miles or to the median line under the UN convention on the Law of the Sea. Any discussion must include Gibraltar as their constitution gave them sole powers over many issues.

Gibraltar claimed it remained the last colony in Europe only because the Government of Spain insisted the inalienable principle of self-determination should not apply to Gibraltarians, with Spain blocking the annual request for Gibraltar to be removed from the UN list of non-self-governing territories. The Gibraltarian government asserts that Gibraltar has been effectively decolonised.

===British position===
In his evidence to the UK Parliament Foreign Affairs Committee in 2008, Jim Murphy MP, Minister of State for Europe stated:

The UK Government will never enter into an agreement on sovereignty without the agreement of the Government of Gibraltar and their people. In fact, we will never even enter into a process without that agreement. The word &#x27;never&#x27; sends a substantial and clear commitment and has been used for a purpose. We have delivered that message with confidence to the peoples and the Governments of Gibraltar and Spain. It is a sign of the maturity of our relationship now that that is accepted as the UK&#x27;s position.

The British Government has ruled out the independence of Gibraltar because, according to the British view, under the Treaty of Utrecht it would require Spanish consent, and has ruled out Gibraltar&#x27;s integration into the United Kingdom.

The option of integration was rejected on 26 June 1976, when the British Government issued the Hattersley Memorandum ruling out integration in order to &quot;avoid innovations which might result in prolongation of the frontier restrictions imposed by Spain.&quot;

===Gibraltarian position===
Gibraltar argues that the Spanish claims are baseless, pointing to the right to self-determination of all peoples, guaranteed and enshrined by the UN, according to the UN Charter. Its article 1 states that &quot;The Purposes of the United Nations are ... to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples.&quot;

To the same section 2 of Resolution 1514 (XV) states: &quot;All peoples have the right to self-determination; by virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development.&quot;

Furthermore, resolution 2231 (XXI) itself recalls and demands implementation of Resolution 1514(XV) (guaranteeing Gibraltar&#x27;s right to self-determination) and therefore it believes that the Spanish claim for its territorial integrity (which would not be affected by Gibraltar&#x27;s decolonisation) cannot displace or extinguish the rights of the people of Gibraltar under resolution 1514(XV) or under the Charter. From this point of view, any additional right that Spain could claim by virtue of the &quot;reversionary&quot; clause contained in the Treaty of Utrecht is overruled and annulled under article 103 of the UN Charter: &quot; In the event of a conflict between the obligations of the Members of the United Nations under the present Charter and their obligations under any other international agreement, their obligations under the present Charter shall prevail.&quot;
Finally, it is argued that there is in fact no principle in International Law or UN doctrine that can displace the inalienable right to self-determination. In this regard, in 2008, the UN 4th Committee rejected the claim that a dispute over sovereignty affected self-determination, affirming it to be a basic human right.

The Gibraltar Government has also argued that Gibraltar is a British territory and therefore by definition not an integral part of any other state, implying that Spain&#x27;s territorial integrity cannot be affected by anything that occurs in Gibraltar: &quot;Even if integration of a territory was demanded by an interested State it could not be had without ascertaining the freely expressed will of the people, the very sine qua non of all decolonisation.&quot;

In a referendum held in Gibraltar in September 2002, Gibraltarian voters rejected even partial Spanish sovereignty.

Gibraltarians seem to remain distrustful of Spain despite improved relations. In 2022, following increased pressure from the Spanish government, Chief Minister Fabian Picardo said &quot;Gibraltar will never be Spanish&quot;.

===Spanish position===
The traditional Spanish position is based on territorial integrity, as per UN Resolution 1514 (XV) (1960), which according to Spain, complements and constrains the right to self-determination:

&quot;Any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.&quot;
During the 1960s, the UN General Assembly passed five resolutions on the issue (2231 (XXI), &quot;Question of Gibraltar&quot; and 2353 (XXII), &quot;Question of Gibraltar&quot;). The resolutions on the decolonisation of Gibraltar focused on the &quot;interests&quot; and not the &quot;wishes&quot; of the Gibraltarians. The latter resolution states that:
any colonial situation which partially or completely destroys the national unity and territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and especially with paragraph 6 of Resolution 1514 (XV) of the General Assembly [...] Invites the Governments of Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to resume without delay the negotiations provided for in General Assembly Resolutions 2070 (XX) and 2231 (XXI), with a view to putting an end to the colonial situation in Gibraltar and to safeguarding the interests of the population.

From such a point of view, Gibraltarians are seen as mere &quot;settlers&quot; from the United Kingdom and other countries and only their interests, not their wishes (as the right to self-determination would involve), need be safeguarded. The point of view that they were settlers is supported by the fact that following the 1704 capture of Gibraltar by Anglo-Dutch troops, only around 70 out of the original 5,000 Spanish inhabitants chose to remain in Gibraltar. Therefore, Spain has insisted that the Gibraltar dispute is a purely bilateral matter with the United Kingdom and has ignored the role and will of the Gibraltarians.

The first formal proposal on how to achieve the return of Gibraltar to Spain was made on 18 May 1966 by the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Fernando Castiella. The proposal comprised three clauses:

# &quot;The cancellation of the Treaty of Utrecht and the subsequent return of Gibraltar to Spain.&quot;
# &quot;The stay of the British base in Gibraltar, its use being subject to a specific Anglo-Spanish agreement.&quot;
# &quot;A &#x27;Personal Statute&#x27; for Gibraltarians, under United Nations guarantee, protecting their cultural, social and economic interest in Gibraltar or anywhere else in Spain, including their British nationality. An &#x27;appropriate ... administrative formula&#x27; should be also agreed.&quot;

The proposal was rejected by the British Government and by the Gibraltarians, which overwhelmingly voted to remain under British sovereignty in a referendum held in 1967 (12,138 to 44).

As a result, the UN General Assembly, during its twenty-third session, adopted resolution 2429 of 1968 (XXIII), denounced the 1967 referendum and requested the United Kingdom not to delay negotiations.

The Spanish government also claims that, under their interpretation of Article X of the Treaty of Utrecht, said clause only grants the British Crown properties inside of Gibraltar (i.e. its port, fortifications and castle), but the land in and of itself would still be property of Spain and it would still be subject to Spanish law.

No further advance for the Spanish claims was achieved for the following forty years. In view of that, the Spanish position seems to have softened, being redirected towards some form of temporary or permanent arrangement to achieve joint sovereignty, which has been proposed by Spain and discussed with the British Government. Such a proposal was put forward by the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Fernando Morán, in 1985. The details of the proposal were not made public, but information released showed an offer on a treaty with the United Kingdom in order to &quot;re-integrate&quot; Gibraltar with Spain, while preserving Gibraltarians&#x27; way of life. They would keep their British nationality, as well as their existing political and labour rights, self-government and institutions. Morán proposed that a condominium or leaseback arrangement should be agreed, over a 15 or 20-year period. This proposal was not formally rejected by Douglas Hurd, the British Foreign Secretary, until 1993.

In 1997 a second proposal was made by the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abel Matutes, foreseeing a hundred-year period of joint sovereignty before a definite transfer to Spain. A similar scheme was provisionally agreed between the Spanish and British governments in the spring of 2002, but this was eventually abandoned, after sustained opposition by the Gibraltarians that included the Gibraltar sovereignty referendum of 2002.

Spain reported to the UN in 2016 that:
*the UK was refusing to negotiate on sovereignty
*the land occupied by the UK was greater than that ceded by the Treaty of Utrecht
*it was the restoration of Spanish territorial integrity that was the key, not self-determination
*the 2006 constitution had not changed the international status of Gibraltar, with the local authorities having no right to interfere in the negotiations about the (according to Spain) illegal occupation of Spanish territory
*Spain would not agree to any situation that was detrimental to people in the area or to the finances of Spain or the EU
*the border checks were EU regulated and designed to stop illegal trafficking of tobacco that was costing the region tax revenue, and that Gibraltar was operating as a tax haven
*Spain was happy to discuss sovereignty issues with the UK and to have four-way &quot;ad hoc&quot; discussion on local issues

== Resolution discussions ==

Spain insisted that the Gibraltar dispute is a bilateral matter purely between the United Kingdom and Spain. This principle appears to have been reflected in the United Nations resolutions on the decolonisation of Gibraltar in the 1960s, which focused on the &quot;interests&quot; of the Gibraltarians. Speaking to the UN C24 in 2006, the chief minister of Gibraltar, Peter Caruana, stated that &quot;It is well known and documented and accepted by all that, since 1988, Gibraltar has rejected the bilateral Brussels Process, and will never be content with it.&quot;

With the 2004 return of a centre-left government in Spain, a new Spanish position was adopted and, in December 2005, the governments of the UK, Spain and Gibraltar agreed to set up &quot;a new, trilateral process of dialogue outside the Brussels Process&quot; with equal participation by the three parties, any decisions or agreements to be agreed by all three. This was ratified by the 2006 Cordoba Agreement. After meetings in Malaga (Spain), Faro (Portugal), and Mallorca (Spain), the Spanish foreign minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos went to Gibraltar in July 2009 to discuss a range of mutual issues. This was the first official Spanish visit since Gibraltar was ceded. The issue of sovereignty was not discussed.

From 2010 Spain has claimed that the trilateral dialogue is finished and reverted to the original call for a bilateral agreement with the UK with four way &quot;ad hoc&quot; meetings which would include Campo de Gibraltar.

==Gibraltar political development==
The Gibraltarians have sought a more modern status and relationship with the United Kingdom reflecting and expanding the present level of self-government.

A new constitution order was approved in a referendum in 2006, which moved Gibraltar to a more Crown dependency-like relationship with the UK, rather than the previous colonial status. The new constitution came into effect in January 2007. Gibraltar is classified as a British overseas territory.

In a letter to the UN the British representative, Emyr Jones Parry, writes: &quot;The new constitution provides for a modern relationship between Gibraltar and the United Kingdom. I do not think that this description would apply to any relationship based on colonialism.&quot;

Chief Minister Peter Caruana addressed the UN Special Committee on Decolonization regarding the new constitution in 2008. He put forth Gibraltar Government&#x27;s view that &quot;As far as we are concerned, the decolonisation of Gibraltar is no longer a pending issue.&quot;

Parallel with this, the Government of Gibraltar has engaged in talks with Spain to resolve other disputes, setting aside the issue of sovereignty.

==Areas of contention==
===Isthmus===

The territory of Gibraltar contains an section of the isthmus that links the Rock with Spain. It is argued by Spain that this section of the isthmus was never ceded by Spain; rather, it was gradually occupied &quot;de facto&quot; by the British.

The growth of Gibraltar onto the southern half of the isthmus began with the construction of two forts in the northernmost part of the ceded territory. In 1815, Gibraltar suffered a yellow fever epidemic. This led to a Spanish concession so a temporary quarantine health camp could be built on the isthmus. After the plague was over, the British did not remove the camp. In 1854, a new epidemic prompted more health camps, which eventually gained Gibraltar these extra 800 metres of land. The occupation of the isthmus culminated in 1938-1939 with the construction of the aerodrome during the Spanish Civil War.

The Treaty of Utrecht did not mention British sovereignty over Gibraltar beyond the fortified perimeter of the town as it was in 1713. However the Treaty ceded the town &quot;together with the port, fortifications, and forts thereunto belonging&quot;, which included several forts along the line of the current frontier. The United Kingdom further claims title to the southern half of the isthmus based on continuous possession over a long period.

The territory north of the current border had been occupied by Spain in the 1730s, during the construction of the so-called Spanish Lines or more properly Lines of Contravallation of Gibraltar.

===Territorial waters===

Both the United Kingdom and Spain have ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 1982, which governs countries&#x27; oceanic territorial claims. Both countries made statements regarding Gibraltar in their declarations upon ratification of the Convention. The Spanish statement was:

2. In ratifying the Convention, Spain wishes to make it known that this act cannot be construed as recognition of any rights or status regarding the maritime space of Gibraltar that are not included in article 10 of the Treaty of Utrecht of 13 July 1713 concluded between the Crowns of Spain and Great Britain. Furthermore, Spain does not consider that Resolution III of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is applicable to the colony of Gibraltar, which is subject to a process of decolonization in which only relevant resolutions adopted by the United Nations General Assembly are applicable.

The British government responded to the Spanish statement in their own statement:

With regard to point 2 of the declaration made upon ratification of the Convention by the Government of Spain, the Government of the United Kingdom has no doubt about the sovereignty of the United Kingdom over Gibraltar, including its territorial waters. The Government of the United Kingdom, as the administering authority of Gibraltar, has extended the United Kingdom&#x27;s accession to the Convention and ratification of the Agreement to Gibraltar. The Government of the United Kingdom, therefore, rejects as unfounded point 2 of the Spanish declaration.

However, Articles 309 and 310 of the Convention state that &quot;No reservations or exceptions may be made to this Convention unless expressly permitted by other articles of this Convention&quot;, and that if a signatory state makes a declaration upon ratification, that declaration must &quot;not purport to exclude or to modify the legal effect of the provisions of this Convention in their application&quot; to that state.

The dispute over territorial waters, which was rekindled in 2013 following a fishing dispute seems likely to become more important with the discovery of a British treasure ship, HMS &quot;Sussex&quot;, and the Black Swan Project controversy.

Questions about the waters have previously been asked in the House of Commons, and answered as follows:
Under international law, States are entitled, but not required, to extend their territorial sea up to a maximum breadth of 12 nautical miles. Where the coasts of two States are opposite or adjacent, the general rule is that neither is entitled, unless they agree otherwise, to extend its territorial sea beyond the median line. The UK Government considers that a limit of three nautical miles is sufficient in the case of Gibraltar.

The Government of Gibraltar for its part holds that there is no economic or social need for more than three nautical miles of territorial water, limited to two nautical miles to the west in the Bay of Gibraltar due to the median line between British and Spanish land.

At the end of 2008, the European Commission included most of the territorial waters that surround Gibraltar under a marine conservation area known as the &quot;Estrecho Oriental&quot; that will be maintained by Spain. The UK initiated legal proceedings with the support of Gibraltar, which were initially rejected by the General Court on procedural grounds. A 2011 appeal was dismissed, again on procedural grounds. The European Court of Justice had again ruled against that appeal in 2012.

There have been disputes concerning Spanish patrol boats inside these claimed territorial waters. In May 2009 there was a number of Spanish incursions into British-claimed waters around Gibraltar, including by a Spanish Navy fisheries protection vessel, leading to intervention by police and a diplomatic protest by the UK.

Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, vessels passing through the Strait of Gibraltar do so under the regime of transit passage, rather than the more limited innocent passage allowed in most territorial waters.

===Economy===
The Spanish government argued that Gibraltar&#x27;s tax schemes harm the Spanish economy. In January 2005, the European Commissioner for Competition requested the UK (responsible for Gibraltar&#x27;s external relations) to abolish Gibraltar&#x27;s tax-exempt company regime by the end of 2010 (at the latest) on the basis that it constitutes illegal state aid that could distort competition. 

The Spanish government wanted to increase the exchange of fiscal information in order to prevent Gibraltar banks being used for tax evasion and money laundering. The British government wanted concrete evidence of wrongdoing to warrant an investigation as Gibraltar has always complied with all international and EU requirements to prevent such activity. In 2009 Gibraltar had signed a number of Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs), with jurisdictions including the UK, USA and Germany, Gibraltar was listed in the OECD &quot;white list&quot;. It is currently listed as &quot;largely compliant&quot; by the OECD&#x27;s Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes.

Gibraltar had not signed a mutual agreement directly with Spain to exchange fiscal information, until in 2019, &quot;the International Agreement on Taxation and Protection of Financial Interests between Spain and the United Kingdom on Gibraltar&quot; was signed by all three countries. This agreement covers such issues as tax co-operation between the authorities in Gibraltar and Spain, the criteria for tax residence of individuals and companies and procedures for administrative cooperation.

There have been claims that some Gibraltarian motorboats are engaging in drugs and tobacco smuggling. However, since 1996 there has been a law in Gibraltar controlling fast launches licensing their ownership and importation and prohibiting the entry of unlicensed craft into Gibraltar waters. In 2014, inspectors from the EU&#x27;s fraud office OLAF wrote to the Spanish governments urging an investigation of tobacco smuggling, amid revelations that Gibraltar, with a population of less than 30,000, imported 117 million packets of cigarettes in 2013. In 2015, Spanish authorities broke up a major tobacco smuggling operation, seizing 65,000 packs of cigarettes, five boats, two firearms, communications equipment and €100,000 cash. Authorities estimated the group was smuggling 150,000 packs of contraband tobacco into Spain every week.

===Military importance===
Military control of the Strait of Gibraltar has historically been the most important use of Gibraltar, allowing Britain to defend its trade lanes to the East. The British admiral Lord Fisher stated that Gibraltar was one of the five keys that locked the world, together with Dover, Alexandria, Cape of Good Hope and Singapore, all of which have been controlled by Britain at one point.

Its military relevance has reduced with the construction in 1953 of the US Naval Station Rota (the biggest Allied base in the area) and with the end of the Cold War, but it is still an important position as more than one quarter of the global maritime traffic transits through the strait every year. Controlling the strait is of vital importance to NATO. The task of controlling the strait has been traditionally assigned by NATO to the UK, but the recent advances that Spain has made in its armed forces and the bases Spain has in the zone have made NATO reconsider this. However, the tense relations that Spain had with the American administration under George W. Bush and the special friendship of the US with the UK have caused NATO to take a more favourable position towards the UK and Morocco for control of the strait.

==Re-emergence of dispute==

===1953: Rekindling the dispute===
In May 1954, despite objections by Spain, Queen Elizabeth II visited Gibraltar. Spanish dictator Francisco Franco had renewed claims to The Rock. British National Archives files from 1953 show that Franco claimed that Spain had been promised The Rock in return for staying neutral during the Second World War. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) conducted a full review of their files to see whether Franco&#x27;s claim had any foundation. Said Spanish communiqué did exist; however, a confidential memo called it &quot;a flimsy and unconvincing document&quot;, and the Government put an end to the dispute by refusing to comment on the claims.

===1967 and 2002 referendums===
In a 1967 referendum on sovereignty organised by the British Government, 99.6% of voters voted to remain under British sovereignty.

In a second referendum on sovereignty held in November 2002 by the Government of Gibraltar, 187 voted yes (1%) and 17,900 voted no (99%) on the proposal of sharing sovereignty with Spain. The question put was:

On the 12 July 2002 the Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, in a formal statement in the House of Commons, said that after twelve months of negotiation the British Government and Spain are in broad agreement on many of the principles that should underpin a lasting settlement of Spain&#x27;s sovereignty claim, which included the principle that Britain and Spain should share sovereignty over Gibraltar.
Do you approve of the principle that Britain and Spain should share sovereignty over Gibraltar?

Spanish reaction varied from questioning the validity of the process, to observing that no Spanish government has done enough to make joint sovereignty or integration with Spain an attractive prospect.

It is reported that Spanish &quot;secret funds&quot; were used to create a favourable opinion in Gibraltar to the Spanish sovereignty claim. How the money was spent remains uncertain.

===Spanish restrictions===

After the 1978 Spanish constitution became law, Spain was still reluctant to re-open the border because of the consequences it might have. However the border was re-opened in 1984, allowing free access between both sides, although Spain did not open ferry services until later. Further problems have been encountered regarding the airport, as it is placed on disputed neutral land. Under the Lisbon Agreement of 1980:

Both Governments have reached agreement on the re-establishment of direct communications in the region. The Spanish Government has decided to suspend the application of the measures at present in force.

This was to include reinstatement of a ferry service between Gibraltar and Algeciras. This was finally reinstated after 40 years, on 16 December 2009, operated by the Spanish company Transcoma.

At the end of 2006, the restrictions on the airport were removed as a result of the Córdoba Agreement (2006) and direct flights from Madrid by Iberia started operation.

On 22 September 2008, however, Iberia announced that it would cease its flights to Madrid by 28 September due to &quot;economic reasons&quot;, namely, lack of demand. This left Gibraltar without any air links with Spain, until May 2009 when Air Andalus opened a service. Air communications with Spain ceased again in August 2010, when Air Andalus lost its licence.

Spain demonstrated opposition to Gibraltar&#x27;s membership of UEFA, which Gibraltar joined in 2013.

===Disputes prior to Brexit===
2000 – An issue of contention was the repair of the nuclear powered submarine, . The Government of Spain expressed its concern about the effective safety for the inhabitants of Gibraltar and the some 250,000 people living in the &quot;Campo de Gibraltar&quot;, the adjacent area in Spain.

The inhabitants of the area saw this repair as a precedent of future repair operations in Gibraltar rather than the one-off emergency the British Government has claimed (no other nuclear submarine has been repaired in Gibraltar since). On the other hand, the Government of Gibraltar accused Spain of using this incident as an excuse to justify its 300-year-old sovereignty claim to Gibraltar. Despite many protests, the Government of Gibraltar allowed the work to be done after employing its own experts to confirm it could be undertaken safely. The submarine was in Gibraltar for a year before leaving, during which the repair was completed without incident.

Subsequently, Spanish politicians have complained about every nuclear submarine visit to Gibraltar, and have tried unsuccessfully to get a reassurance that this would totally stop. There have been no further protests against nuclear submarines in Gibraltar. Commenting, the Government of Gibraltar said: &quot;Nuclear submarine visits to Gibraltar are a matter for the UK and Gibraltar. Visits for operational or recreational purposes are welcomed by the Gibraltar Government ... To our knowledge, it is not the position of the present Spanish Government or any previous Spanish Government, that it is opposed to visits by nuclear submarines.&quot;

2002 – In the months that predated the referendum called by the Gibraltar government on the joint sovereignty agreement disagreements could be categorised as:
* Control of the military installations. Spain wished to control the military installations of the territory, even in the event of joint sovereignty. This pretension was considered unacceptable by the British Ministry of Defence.
* The referendum itself. Both the Spanish and British governments stated that the referendum had no legal effect, but it clearly indicated the democratically expressed will of the people of Gibraltar to &quot;not be Spanish&quot;. As the British Government is committed to respect those wishes, the idea of a joint sovereignty deal has been abandoned.

2004 – A visit by The Princess Royal in June 2004, the brief return of HMS &quot;Tireless&quot; in July 2004, together with the Tercentenary Celebrations of the capture of The Rock were subjects of complaint by the Spanish Government.

A new round of talks on a tri-lateral basis were proposed in October 2004 to discuss regional co-operation. In February 2005 the first talks took place at a meeting held in Málaga and subsequently in Portugal and London.

This is the first sign of formal recognition of the Government of Gibraltar, and has been generally welcomed. The main issues of the talks have been a new agreement on the airport, the pensions of the Spanish workers that worked in Gibraltar during the 1960s, and the removal of Spanish restrictions on telecommunications.

2006 – Those issues were successfully resolved in September 2006 in the Córdoba Agreement. The process continues.

2007 – A bulk carrier, the , ran aground south of Europa Point in Gibraltar and broke up on the reef in August 2007, generating accusations of pollution in Spain and claims not only against the Government of Gibraltar but also against that of Spain. Its cargo was scrap metal and the vessel&#x27;s fuel was promptly drained. The Government of Gibraltar claimed in December 2007 that the operation did not represent a material risk to the environment since the vessel had been defuelled and only small, remnant amounts of fuel remained in the engines themselves. The Spanish branch of Greenpeace claimed that, as late as February 2008, fuel spills from the New Flame had polluted Spanish beaches around the Bay of Gibraltar. Official Spanish sources played this down stating that the fuel reaching the beaches of Algeciras was in &quot;insignificant amounts&quot;.

2009 – The dispute over British-claimed territorial waters gained prominence with deliberate incursions by Spain, triggering angry headlines in the UK tabloid press. In December 2009, four armed Civil Guard officers were detained after three landed in Gibraltar in pursuit of two suspected smugglers, who were themselves arrested. The Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba personally telephoned Chief Minister Peter Caruana to apologise, stating that there were &quot;no political intentions&quot; behind the incident. The Chief Minister was prepared to accept it had not been a political act. The Spanish officers were released by the police the following day, who said that &quot;Enquiries established that the Guardia Civil mistakenly entered Gibraltar Territorial Waters in hot pursuit and have since apologised for their actions.&quot;

2012 – Queen Sofía of Spain cancelled plans to travel to the United Kingdom to participate in the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II. The cancellation was a protest in response to a planned visit to Gibraltar by Prince Edward. The Spanish government also lodged a protest to the planned visit by Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex. Relations between Britain and Spain reportedly &quot;returned to a state of growing confrontation&quot; following the election of Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy of the People&#x27;s Party in December 2011. Additional protests followed in August 2012 after Gibraltar abrogated an accord that allowed Spanish fishing boats to operate in its waters.

2013 – Disagreements between Spain and the United Kingdom Government re-surfaced in July 2013, initially after the Gibraltar Government placed a number of concrete blocks in the sea off the coast of Gibraltar, intending to form an artificial reef. The Spanish Government protested however stating that it had a negative impact on fishing in the area, restricting access for Spanish fishing vessels. At the end of July the Spanish Government introduced extra border checks for people going in and out of the territory into Spain. The British Government protested as the checks were causing major delays of up to seven hours while people waited to cross the border, and on 2 August the Spanish Ambassador was summoned to the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London to discuss these developments.

On 2 August 2013, Spanish foreign minister José Manuel Garcia-Margallo gave an interview to Spain&#x27;s &quot;ABC&quot; newspaper. He announced possible plans to introduce a 50 euro border crossing fee for people going to and from Gibraltar, in response to the creation of the artificial reef. Plans to close Spanish airspace to Gibraltar bound flights were also reported, as were plans for an investigation by Spanish tax authorities into property owned by around 6,000 Gibraltarians in neighbouring parts of Spain. The Spanish foreign minister also mooted plans to changes in the law meaning British online gaming companies based in Gibraltar would have to base servers in Spain, meaning that they would come under Madrid&#x27;s tax regime.

The British Foreign office responded to these comments: &quot;The prime minister has made clear that the UK government will meet its constitutional commitments to the people of Gibraltar and will not compromise on sovereignty.&quot;

===Effect of Brexit===
After the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, despite a strong vote to remain in Gibraltar, on 23 June 2016, Spain reiterated its position that it wanted to jointly govern Gibraltar with the United Kingdom and said it would seek to block Gibraltar from participating in talks over future deals between the UK and EU. The European council released a series of guidelines on negotiations for withdrawal, with core principal number 22 stating that any agreement affecting Gibraltar needed the agreement of Spain suggesting that Spain had been given a veto while the United Kingdom re-iterated its commitment to Gibraltar.

===EU Withdrawal Agreement===

On 18 October 2018, Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez announced that he had reached an agreement with Britain, declaring that a special protocol about Gibraltar was being prepared along with the UK Government and was hopeful to reach a good agreement for both parties. However, on 19 November 2018, the Spanish Government threatened not to support the Brexit Agreement Draft because they say that an article was added without their consent that could be misunderstood and leave Spain without a say over Gibraltar. On 22 November 2018, PM Sánchez and PM May discussed the problem but the Spanish PM declared that &quot;our positions remain far away. My Government will always defend the interests of Spain. If there are no changes, we will veto Brexit.&quot; On 24 November 2018, Spain agreed not to veto the Brexit deal in exchange for a tripartite statement of the European Commission President and the European Council President, the UK Government and the EU Member States saying that no deal would be reached about Gibraltar without Spain&#x27;s consent. The European statement also declared that the EU does not consider Gibraltar to be part of the United Kingdom.

<doc id="1008133" wikidata="Q1368300" url="?curid=1008133" title="Peter Farrelly">
<text>Peter John Farrelly (born December 17, 1956) is an American film director, screenwriter, producer and novelist. Along with his brother Bobby, the Farrelly brothers are mostly famous for directing and producing quirky comedy and romantic comedy films such as &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;; &quot;Shallow Hal&quot;; &quot;Me, Myself and Irene&quot;; &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot;; and the 2007 remake of &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot;.

Farrelly solo-directed and co-wrote the comedy-drama &quot;Green Book&quot; (2018), which won the Audience Award at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2018, the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay, and the Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay.

==Early life and education==
Farrelly was born in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, to Mariann (née Neary), a nurse practitioner, and Robert Leo Farrelly, a doctor. His grandparents were Irish immigrants, and he also has Polish ancestry. He was raised in Cumberland, Rhode Island. He graduated from Kent School in 1975 and from Providence College where he studied accounting. In 1986 he earned a master&#x27;s in fine arts from Columbia University.

==Career==
===Writer===
Farrelly decided to pursue writing full-time, which prompted him to quit his sales job and relocate to Cape Cod, Massachusetts, where he got a job as a waiter. On one of the tables he was waiting, Farrelly struck up a conversation with a writing professor from UMass Amherst, who encouraged Farrelly to apply to graduate school. Farrelly said he did not think his chances were good, considering he did poorly in college but the professor said not everything is judged by grades. With what would later be &quot;Outside Providence&quot;, Farrelly submitted the work and was pleasantly surprised that he was accepted. He studied writing for a time at UMass Amherst, but was ultimately dissatisfied with the program, and transferred to Columbia University in New York City, which Farrelly said he found very satisfying. He later became interested in screenwriting, which led him to directing. He made this career decision after many of his screenplays sold but were not produced.

He is a published novelist, with works including &quot;Outside Providence (1988)&quot; and &quot;The Comedy Writer (1998)&quot;.

===Producer and director===
Together with his brother, Bobby Farrelly, he has written, directed, and produced several comedy films including &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot;, &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;, &quot;Kingpin&quot;, &quot;Shallow Hal&quot;, &quot;Me, Myself &amp; Irene&quot;, &quot;Stuck on You&quot;, and &quot;Fever Pitch&quot;. They also conceived the 1992 &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode &quot;The Virgin&quot; (Season 4.Episode:10).

In 2006, Farrelly directed the Man Laws series of television commercials for the Miller Lite beer brand, which featured actor Burt Reynolds, American football player Jerome Bettis, climber Aron Ralston, and professional wrestler Triple H.

Peter worked on a film entitled, &quot;Movie 43&quot;, which was released in 2013 and produced by the siblings&#x27; long-time producer Charles B. Wessler. He produced the anthology film and directed two of its segments.

In 2011, the Farrellys produced and directed &quot;Hall Pass&quot;.

The brothers produced and directed &quot;The Three Stooges&quot; in 2012.

In 2012, Peter and his brother announced that the filming of &quot;Dumb and Dumber To&quot; would begin in 2013. The film was released on November 14, 2014.

In 2016, Audience announced that &quot;Loudermilk&quot;, a new half-hour scripted comedy co-created by Farrelly and Bobby Mort, would receive a straight-to-series order. In 2018, the show was renewed for season 2, and in 2021 a third season was aired on Amazon Prime Video.

In 2018, Farrelly directed &quot;Green Book&quot;, which won the Toronto International Film Festival&#x27;s People Choice Award. At the 91st Academy Awards, he won the Oscars for Best Original Screenplay and Best Picture.

In 2020, Farrelly directed alongside his brother, and co-wrote the Quibi comedy series &quot;The Now&quot;, starring Bill Murray, Dave Franco, O&#x27;Shea Jackson Jr., Daryl Hannah, and Jimmy Tatro.

===Board member===
Farrelly is a board member of Direct Sports Network (formerly DeskSite).

== Personal life ==
Farrelly is married to Melinda Kocsis and has a son, Bob, and a daughter, Apple. He has two sisters, Beth and Cindy, and a third sister, Kathy, who died in 2017. Peter lives in California, while brother Bobby lives in Massachusetts.

In 1998, Farrelly&#x27;s colleagues told &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine that he and his brother Bobby &quot;liked to use ruses to get people to look at Farrelly&#x27;s penis&quot; as a joke. Those who had been tricked into seeing Farrelly&#x27;s genitals include film executive Tom Rothman and actress Cameron Diaz. In 2019 after the story resurfaced, Farrelly stated: &quot;I did this decades ago, and I thought I was being funny, and the truth is I&#x27;m embarrassed, and it makes me cringe now. I&#x27;m deeply sorry.&quot;

==Philanthropy and honors==
Farrelly is a long-time supporter of disability rights. In 2020, he and his brother Bobby received the Morton E. Ruderman Award for Inclusion of People with Disabilities. Past winners include Michael Phelps and Marlee Matlin. He won the 2015 Lifetime Achievement Award bestowed by Media Access Awards.

<text>George William Allan, , (January 9, 1822 – July 24, 1901), was a Canadian lawyer and politician. He served as the 11th Mayor of Toronto and later as Speaker of the Senate of Canada.

==Life and career==
Allan attended Upper Canada College and served with the Bank Rifle Corps when it helped put down the 1837 Upper Canada Rebellion. He went on to study law and was called to the bar in 1846 when he also married his first wife, Louisa Maud Robinson.

Allan travelled extensively before beginning his law practice. He toured Europe, the Nile River, Syria, the Holy Land, Turkey, and Greece giving him a lifelong appreciation of travel and winning him election to the Royal Geographical Society.

He was a Toronto alderman from 1849 until 1855, when he was elected the 11th Mayor of Toronto. In 1858, he entered national politics representing York on the Legislative Council until Canadian Confederation. In 1867 he was nominated to the Senate of Canada as one of its first members and sat as a Conservative. In 1869 he was appointed government trustee for municipal bond fund of the Toronto and Nipissing Railway. He was chairman of the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce for many years and was Speaker from 1888 until 1891. He remained in the Upper House until his death in 1901.

Allan&#x27;s interests included education, science, culture and art. He was the most important patron of the artist, Paul Kane, enabling him to live a life as a professional artist, and presided over such bodies as the Royal Canadian Institute, the Ontario Society of Artists, the Toronto Conservatory of Music and the Ontario Historical Society. He served as chancellor of Trinity College. He donated to the city of Toronto a piece of land which formed the nucleus of Allan Gardens. He was also active in the Synod of the Church of England and was president of the Upper Canada Bible Society. He died in 1901, aged 79, at his residence, Moss Park, in Toronto.

==Family==
Allan&#x27;s father was William Allan, of York (Toronto). William Allan was a pioneer who settled what was then the Township of York during John Graves Simcoe&#x27;s term as governor. William Allan eventually became the city&#x27;s first postmaster and was appointed to the Legislative Council of Upper Canada. He was a supporter of the Family Compact and was also a member of the Orange Order in Canada.

Allan&#x27;s mother was Leah Tyrer Gamble, daughter of Dr. John Gamble. She died in Toronto on October I7, 1848, aged 58.
After the death of Allan&#x27;s first wife, Louisa Robinson, he married Adelaide Schreiber, with whom he had 6 children: George William Allan, Jr., Arthur, Bingham, Maye, Maude, and Audrey.

<text>August Sangret (28 August 1913 – 29 April 1943) was a French-Canadian soldier, convicted and subsequently hanged for the September 1942 murder of 19-year-old Joan Pearl Wolfe in Surrey, England. This murder case is also known as the &quot;Wigwam Murder&quot;.

The murder of Joan Pearl Wolfe became known as &quot;the Wigwam Murder&quot; due to the fact the victim had become known among locals as the &quot;Wigwam Girl&quot; through her living in two separate, improvised wigwams upon Hankley Common in the months preceding her murder, and that these devices proved to have been constructed by her murderer.

This case marked the first occasion in British legal history in which a murder victim&#x27;s skull was introduced as evidence at trial, and has been described by true crime author Colin Wilson as &quot;the last of the classic cases.&quot;

==Early life==

===Sangret===
August Sangret was born in Battleford, Saskatchewan, on 28 August 1913. He was of mixed race; being part French Canadian and part Cree Indian. Little is known of Sangret&#x27;s early life, but his family was poor, his early years were blighted with illnesses, and at least one of his siblings died at an early age from tuberculosis. Sangret received no schooling in his childhood, and was unable to read, or to write beyond signing his own name. Nonetheless, he has been described as being modestly intelligent, and in possession of an excellent memory. In addition to English, Sangret spoke the Cree language fluently, and learned some of the traditional skills of his ancestors in his youth, some of which were honed throughout the years he worked as a farm labourer in the town of Maidstone in the 1920s. As a result of this outdoor work, Sangret developed a lithe, muscular physique.

At the age of 17, Sangret received the first of many diagnoses that he had contracted a venereal disease. On this first occasion, upon medical advice, he had unsuccessfully attempted to cure himself using a potassium permanganate solution, before admitting himself to a Battleford hospital to undergo extensive treatment for a bladder obstruction. This would prove to be the first of at least six occasions in which Sangret would receive treatment for a contracted venereal disease, attesting to his sexual promiscuity, although the remaining five instances would occur between 1938 and 1942.

Throughout the 1930s, Sangret accrued an extensive criminal record, which included six months served in gaol for a violent assault committed in 1932, a three-month sentence served in 1938 for threatening to shoot a woman, and numerous convictions for both vagrancy and theft. He was regularly unemployed, and enlisted to serve in the Battleford Light Infantry in 1935. This militia regiment trained for just two weeks each year, and Sangret served with this regiment until 1939.

===Wolfe===

Joan Pearl Wolfe was born in Tonbridge, Kent, on 11 March 1923, the youngest of three children born to Charles Frederick and Edith Mary (&quot;née&quot; Groombridge) Wolfe, who had married in 1920.

In April 1930, Joan&#x27;s father died at the age of 34. Her mother remarried a man named Leslie John Wood in January the following year; they had a daughter in December 1931. The family moved to live in Tunbridge Wells where Joan attended a Catholic convent school in nearby Mark Cross, her tuition fees reportedly paid by a wealthy aunt. She attended this convent school until aged 16, becoming fluent in the French language, and although outwardly pious and known to regularly wear a conspicuous crucifix about her neck, she apparently lacked any serious religious commitment.

Joan&#x27;s step-father, Leslie, was known locally as proficient chess player but was an eccentric figure who suffered from insomnia and was prone to sudden public outbursts of both paranoia and hostility. In August 1939, when Joan was 16 years old, she returned from school one day to find her step-father lying dead on the floor of their sealed kitchen: he had committed suicide by gassing himself. Her mother subsequently remarried for a second time in 1942; this time to a man named Charles Watts.

With her mother&#x27;s approval, Wolfe became engaged to an affluent young man from Tunbridge Wells shortly before her 16th birthday in 1939. Reportedly, Joan&#x27;s fiancé lavished his attention and affections on her, although later the same year, while still engaged, Wolfe first ran away from home. On this first occasion, her mother reported her daughter missing to police, and Joan was discovered approximately one month later in the town of Aldershot. She was driven back to Tunbridge Wells by her fiancé&#x27;s mother, although shortly after the outbreak of World War II, Wolfe chose to call off her engagement and instead travel to London to train as a storekeeper in an aircraft factory.

After one month, Wolfe left this employment, but did not inform her mother of this fact. It is at this stage in her life in which Wolfe&#x27;s behaviour is believed to have become increasingly irresponsible and promiscuous, and she is known to have subsequently engaged in casual affairs with several soldiers between 1940 and 1942, most of whom served with the Canadian Army. Wolfe&#x27;s behaviour from 1940 onward attests to her being gullible, extremely naïve, prone to flights of fancy, yet apparently yearning for stability. Her naïvety may have been compounded by her heavily chaperoned convent upbringing. These facts are evidenced not only in her behaviour, but in the content of the numerous letters she is known to have written to her final lover, who would ultimately prove to be her murderer. Moreover, until her death, she neither drank, smoked or used any profane language in her vocabulary.

Although little beyond subsequent trial testimony is known of Wolfe&#x27;s relationship with her mother, the evidence which exists attests to Edith Watts being a simple, caring woman, gradually driven to despair by her eldest daughter&#x27;s increasingly unpredictable and irresponsible behaviour; however, Wolfe herself may have found her mother&#x27;s attitude somewhat overbearing. Nonetheless, via letter and in person, Edith is known to have repeatedly implored her daughter to return to or remain at home, and to revert to a stable, respectable lifestyle. In addition, contrary to Wolfe&#x27;s claims that those in positions of authority had seldom made any serious efforts to help her, the police—occasionally at Edith&#x27;s urging—did intervene on several occasions out of concern for her welfare, and she was repeatedly offered various forms of assistance, but would inevitably revert to her somewhat nomadic lifestyle.

Despite her wayward lifestyle, Joan did maintain sporadic written correspondence with her mother between 1940 and 1942, and she is known to have infrequently returned home to Tunbridge Wells for brief periods—twice in the company of Canadian soldiers she was dating—to visit her family, before opting to return to Godalming or Guildford. She is known to have held several menial forms of employment from 1940 onward; alternately residing in cheap lodgings or sleeping rough. Wolfe is also known to have formed a close friendship with an elderly lady named Kate Hayter in the village of Thursley while she lived and worked in Godalming. According to Wolfe, Hayter allowed her sleep at her bungalow, and to both wash and change her clothes, when she was unemployed.

On each occasion Edith wrote to or spoke with her daughter, she would argue with Joan as to her irresponsible and promiscuous lifestyle. By 1942, the relationship between mother and daughter had deteriorated and, in May, Edith wrote a final letter to her daughter, informing her she was &quot;finished with you. I have been more than fair to you; forgiven you for things no other mother would have done ... You said something about repaying me for all I have done for you ... Joan, I shall be paid in full the day you come and truthfully say, &#x27;Mum, I&#x27;m going to be a good girl&#x27;. Joan, that will be the happiest day of my life.&quot;

==War years==
On 19 June 1940, nine months after Canada had proclaimed her intention to join the war effort, Sangret chose to enlist as a full-time soldier in the Regina Rifle Regiment. Shortly thereafter, his regiment was transferred to Dundurn Camp. His career as a soldier is marred with several blemishes, and he was repeatedly punished for both minor and major infractions of military discipline, including several instances in which he was reported absent without leave (although no record exists of Sangret ever being returned to barracks against his will). Throughout his military service, he never advanced beyond the rank of private.

Sangret&#x27;s regiment was deployed to Britain on 24 March 1942. He was initially stationed in Fleet, Hampshire, before being posted to Aldershot and, on 13 July, to Jasper Camp. This final posting was in the market town of Godalming, and Sangret became one of an estimated 100,000 soldiers stationed in the vicinity of Witley and Thursley in 1942. At Jasper Camp, Sangret enrolled in a newly formed 12-week educational course for soldiers lacking in elementary education. While stationed in Godalming, Sangret became acquainted with Joan Pearl Wolfe.

The same year Sangret&#x27;s regiment was posted to Britain, Joan Wolfe became engaged to a Canadian soldier named Francis Hearn, who returned to Canada on 15 July, having previously promised to marry her (which he had likely known was improbable due to his imminent posting to Canada). Wolfe is known to have thereafter worn a ring given to her by Hearn, and to have occasionally referred to herself as his wife. On one occasion, she is known to have falsely informed a female acquaintance she and Hearn had married in London, and that she and he were both &quot;heartbroken&quot; at his being posted back to Canada.

===Acquaintance and courtship===
On 17 July 1942, the day after Hearn left for Canada, Joan Wolfe and August Sangret met for the first time in a pub in Godalming. According to Sangret, he had first noted Wolfe when she walked toward a bar and ordered a lemonade, to which he had asked her when she subsequently sat near him whether she was able to purchase &quot;anything stronger&quot;, and Wolfe—whom he described as being &quot;rather scruffy&quot; and downcast in spirit—had simply replied that she &quot;didn&#x27;t drink anything stronger&quot;. He and Wolfe had then begun to talk, and later walked through a local park, before engaging in intercourse in a field close to the River Wey. The two then parted company, having arranged to meet again. As would often subsequently occur, Wolfe did not keep her next date, but Sangret and a fellow soldier named Hartnell did by chance encounter her outside a Godalming fish and chip shop on 21 July. Wolfe had apparently agreed to date Hartnell on this evening, but became notably upset when Hartnell suggested tossing a coin to determine whether he or Sangret should &quot;have her&quot; that evening. In response, Hartnell simply left Wolfe and Sangret, and the pair were briefly detained by police, before being released. Sangret took Wolfe to the undergrowth close to Witley Camp that evening, and on this date, upon being informed by Wolfe she had &quot;nowhere to stay&quot;, constructed the first wigwam for he and Wolfe to meet. Sangret described this first temporary shelter as being &quot;a little shack with limbs and stuff.&quot; He spent the night with Wolfe in this device, returning to barracks at 6 a.m., having given Joan his photograph, address, and arranging to meet her in Godalming that evening. He later furnished this spartan pine structure with army blankets.

Sangret and Wolfe subsequently met on a regular—yet unreliable—basis in which he would meet her at approximately 7 p.m., then return to barracks to answer the 10 p.m. , before returning to the wigwam (which he referred to as &quot;the shack&quot;) to spend the night with her. Early in their courtship, this first wigwam he had constructed was discovered, and Wolfe evicted from the structure; in response, Sangret constructed a second, larger device for he and Wolfe to meet in his off-duty hours, again constructed using the traditional skills of his Cree ancestors he had honed in his youth, and again located close to his base on Hankley Common (then an army training ground regularly used for military exercises). Each structure was devised from long poles, saplings and branches covered by sheets of birch bark and bracken. The tools used for constructing these shelters included a small, crooked knife that is unique to the Cree.

On 23 July, Wolfe was admitted to hospital, having fainted in a Guildford street. She informed Sangret of this fact in a letter, imploring him to visit her (Sangret did attempt to visit on this date, but missed official visiting hours and was thus refused entry). Three days later, she wrote a second letter to Sangret, reading in part:

(Although pathologists who later examined Wolfe&#x27;s body were unable to determine whether she had been pregnant at the time of her death, had she been so at the time she wrote this letter on 26 July, Sangret—having known Wolfe for just nine days—could not have fathered the child. If Wolfe was indeed pregnant, the father of the child would likely have been Francis Hearn.)
When Wolfe was released from hospital on 28 July, the couple continued to spend a great deal of time together within the wigwam he had constructed. On 31 July, she briefly obtained employment in a factory constructing barrage balloons, earning £2 10s per week, but lost this job as a result of poor timekeeping just three days later; she then informed Sangret of her desire to return to her mother&#x27;s home, but was unwilling to do so until she had received written permission from her mother. When she received no reply from her mother, Wolfe briefly drifted to London in search of work, but returned to the wigwam after approximately three days. Shortly thereafter, the couple were discovered by a soldier attached to the military police named Donald Brett. Brett instructed Sangret to dismantle the wigwam, and Wolfe—residing on army territory—to move away from the area. Sangret did deconstruct this first wigwam, and almost immediately constructed a second device just 800 yards from where he had built the first. This second device was constructed by Sangret in mid- to late-August, using birch saplings and tied with parcel string he had stolen from barracks, although he later claimed he and Wolfe had lived in this second wigwam for just two nights, before the pair had scoured the village of Witley on 23 August, in an unsuccessful search for lodgings.

That same evening the pair had searched for lodgings, Sangret was detained by the military police, and Wolfe escorted by the Surrey Police to a Guildford hospital (where she would remain until 1 September) in order that she would be in a safe and secure environment. At 11 a.m. the following morning, Sangret was arrested by the military police upon the charge of illegally keeping a girl within the camp precincts. The pair were allowed to talk with one-another via telephone, and Joan emphasised to a civilian policeman present that the pair intended to wed. Sangret himself is known to have visited his commanding officer on 24 August, seeking official permission to marry Joan, although he was informed he would need both her mother&#x27;s approval due to her technical status as a minor, and official permission from the Canadian government. (Sangret was provided with a formal marriage application form, but never sought assistance from his colleagues in completing and returning this document.)

On one occasion in which Sangret visited Wolfe at the Guidford hospital prior to her absconding on 1 September, he was informed by Wolfe herself that doctors who had examined her were &quot;uncertain&quot; whether she was pregnant.

==September 1942==
On 1 September, Wolfe obtained a one-day pass to leave Guildford hospital, informing the matron of her intentions to visit the cinema and shop for new clothes. She never returned to the hospital; instead returning to Sangret, before spending the night sleeping alone in the waiting rooms at Guildford railway station.

Wolfe subsequently moved into an abandoned cricket pavilion in Thursley on or about 3 September, with Sangret providing her with an army-issue blanket and water-bottle stolen from his barracks on this date. In this pavilion, Wolfe would spend extended periods of time, often composing romantic poetry and letters (several of which were smattered with religious overtones), and making childlike drawings of the home into which she evidently envisioned herself and Sangret moving following their marriage. One of these drawings was made on the wall of the cricket pavilion, with a caption reading &quot;Our little Grey home in the West.&quot; Beneath this caption, an inscription read: &#x27;J. Wolfe now Mrs. Sangret. England. September 9, 1942&#x27;.

Throughout the two weeks in which Joan Wolfe resided within the abandoned cricket pavilion, Sangret visited her with increasing frequency; often when he should have been at base. He regularly brought food for he and Joan to eat together as they discussed their future plans, including the marriage Wolfe evidently yearned for. When they could not meet, Wolfe would send letters to Sangret that would be read to him by a Sergeant Charles Hicks, who would then compose Sangret&#x27;s replies. The tone and style of Wolfe&#x27;s letters to Sangret is typically naïve, yet optimistic, and is reminiscent of the letter she had composed on 26 July, with repeated references to her time spent in his company, her hopes for marriage, her general loneliness (which Wolfe is known to have referred to as her &quot;penance&quot;), and her desire to be in his company. On at least one occasion, however, Wolfe does hark toward her frustration at Sangret&#x27;s apparently repeated accusations of infidelity, to which she wrote: &quot;You know I am in a safe place now anyway, and you will not be able to accuse me of going out with other soldiers. I have never done it since I have known you anyway, but you are so damned jealous you think it; but still we will forget all that now and look forward to the future, when we are married.&quot;

As had been the case in July, Wolfe did obtain employment on more than one occasion in the final weeks of her life, but would invariably be fired after a matter of days or weeks due to her unreliability as an employee. To earn money on the numerous occasions she was unemployed, Wolfe—occasionally accompanied by Sangret—would gather blackberries on Hankley Common, which Sangret would sell to his army colleagues for up to 7 shillings. Evidently, Wolfe spent some of this money on knitting provisions, as she is known to have knitted several baby clothes in the final weeks of her life.

On two successive days in the week before her murder, Wolfe was seen by a local resident named William Featherby picking blackberries on the edge of the common, and cooking vegetables over an open fire. On the second of these two occasions, Sangret had been inside the pavilion. The last known individual to see Joan Wolfe alive was a woman named Alice Curtis, who observed Wolfe, in the company of a &quot;dark-complexioned&quot; soldier with black hair, walking towards the hamlet of Brook on Sunday, 13 September.

===Disappearance===
By 14 September, the relationship between Sangret and Wolfe had lasted 60 days. On this date, Joan Pearl Wolfe disappeared. According to Sangret&#x27;s subsequent trial testimony, as he returned from the pavilion to barracks that morning, Joan had informed him of her intentions to return to Kate Hayter&#x27;s Thursley residence. That evening, Sangret and a fellow soldier named Joseph Wells decided to visit a Thursley pub. On two occasions that evening, Sangret is known to have left Wells alone in the pub as he returned to the cricket pavilion. Each time he returned, he explained to Wells he had been searching for Wolfe out of concern for her welfare. On one of these occasions, he did not return for over 30 minutes.

In an apparent effort to construct an alibi, Sangret visited the home of Kate Hayter on 15 September, inquiring whether she had seen Joan, and leaving the pink baby clothes Wolfe had knitted in the weeks prior to her murder in Hayter&#x27;s possession. The same evening, he informed Wells his water-bottle and knife were missing, and that he suspected both items were in Wolfe&#x27;s possession.

Sangret is known to have given several conflicting explanations as to Wolfe&#x27;s whereabouts to his army colleagues in the weeks following her disappearance: to some, he claimed Joan had simply returned home and the &quot;wedding is off&quot;; to others, he claimed Joan was in hospital. Furthermore, he is also known to have visited his Provost Sergeant, Harold Wade, on 21 September, ostensibly seeking official assistance in his search for Wolfe. To Wade, Sangret confided he and Joan had &quot;quarrelled&quot; after he had informed her of his indifferent attitude to marriage. In response to this explanation, Wade questioned Sangret as to why he should be so concerned as to Joan&#x27;s whereabouts, given that he evidently had no intentions of marrying her. To this, Sangret had replied: &quot;If she should be found, and anything has happened to her, I don&#x27;t want to be mixed up with it.&quot;

Within weeks of Wolfe&#x27;s disappearance, Sangret had begun casually dating local women. As had been the case when he corresponded via letter with Joan Wolfe, he asked his army colleagues to compose his replies due to his illiteracy. One of these colleagues to compose letters for Sangret was a sapper named Clarence Bear, whom Sangret asked to write a letter to a woman with whom he intended to spend an upcoming period of leave. When Bear voiced his concerns as to the implications this behaviour may have upon his relationship with Joan Wolfe, Sangret had replied, &quot;She&#x27;ll never find out.&quot;

==Discovery==
At 10:20 a.m. on 7 October 1942, two Royal Marines named William Moore and Geoffrey Cooke, patrolling a section of Hankley Common known as Houndown Wood on a routine military exercise, passed a high mound of earth which had been purposely bulldozed to simulate training upon rough terrain for tank crews. Protruding through the soil of a freshly dug patch of earth on a slope, Moore observed what appeared to be an exposed human arm. Looking closer at the hand of this exposed limb, he further noted that the flesh upon two of the fingers and the thumb had been gnawed away by rats or other vermin, and that a foot also protruded from the earth.

Moore and his colleague did not interfere with the body, but immediately returned to base to report their find to their sergeant. Subsequently, Lieutenant Norman McLeod inspected the site of their discovery, and immediately called the police. The first officers at the scene were Superintendents Richard Webb and Thomas Roberts of Surrey Police; both men deduced the experience of Scotland Yard was required, and cordoned off the area until the arrival that afternoon of Detective Chief Inspector Edward Greeno and Detective Sergeant Fred Hodge.

At the request of Superintendent Webb, Dr. Eric Gardner, pathologist to the Surrey County Coroner, and forensic pathologist Dr. Keith Simpson were both summoned to conduct the excavation of the remains. Both men arrived at the crime scene the following day.

The victim was dressed in a green-and-white summer frock with a lace collar and woollen ankle-socks. Her underclothes had not been removed, suggesting that she had not been subjected to a sexual assault prior to her murder. She was lying face down in a shallow, makeshift grave which had later been disturbed by a passing military vehicle, possibly a half-track, which had loosened the soil and exposed her arm and foot. The left arm was folded beneath the chest, with the exposed right arm notably outstretched, indicating the victim had likely been dragged to the location where she lay.

The body itself was badly decomposed, with the head, chest and abdominal cavity described by Simpson as being a &quot;seething mass of maggots&quot;, which had eaten much of the soft body tissue, including the head and neck, save for a small section of scalp and hair. A headscarf was found knotted around the victim&#x27;s neck, but the knot itself was extremely slack, instantly enabling both men to dismiss strangulation as the cause of death; instead, both men strongly speculated the cause of death had been the extensive blunt trauma to the skull, which had &quot;all but collapsed&quot; in the attack. The extent of decomposition indicated that the victim had likely died between five and seven weeks prior to her discovery. Furthermore, the murderer had dragged his victim uphill to the location where he had buried her; this conclusion was further supported by the presence of three parallel scrapes upon the skin of the right ankle, which corresponded with tears in the right sock.

The body was removed and taken to Guy&#x27;s Hospital, to await a formal autopsy.

===Autopsy===
On the evening of 8 October, Dr. Simpson conducted an autopsy upon the victim, ascertaining that the body was that of a Caucasian female, approximately 17 to 20 years old and 5 feet, 4 inches in height. Her cropped hair was naturally sandy brown in colour, but had been bleached blonde several weeks before her death.

Having carefully reconstructed the skull by wiring together all 38 fragments that could be found, Simpson clearly revealed a large impact site at the rear of the skull measuring five inches in length and one-and-three-quarter inches in breadth, further affirming his earlier conclusions at the crime scene. This injury, coupled with a fracture to the victim&#x27;s right cheek bone, led Simpson to conclude that the victim had died as a result of a single, heavy blow to back of the head, inflicted while the victim was lying face down. The weapon which had delivered this fatal injury was a pole or bough of wood, and the blow from this weapon had caved in the skull. The commensurate positioning of the fracture to the cheek bone further supported the conclusion the victim had been killed as she lay face down on the ground. These injuries would have induced rapid unconsciousness, and death would have resulted within minutes.

Numerous knife wounds were also discovered on the forehead, right forearm and right hand of the body, most likely inflicted before the victim had died. The positioning of the knife wounds on the skull indicated the victim had been facing her attacker throughout this initial assault; this was further supported by the wounds in the right forearm, which suggested the victim had raised her hands to protect herself from these knife blows (no flesh remained on the left hand or forearm to identify potential similar wounds). The head wounds had been inflicted on the left section of the skull and forehead, consistent with the attacker being a right-handed individual. Curiously, the tissues around the stab wounds in the victim&#x27;s forearm and hand had been pulled outwards as the knife had been extracted—indicating the end of the blade had a curved or hooked point, resembling a parrot&#x27;s beak. Three of the wounds located on the top of the reconstructed skull were particularly distinctive, being circular countersunk holes, further supporting this conclusion.

In addition to these knife and blunt trauma injuries, the victim&#x27;s jaw had also been broken and three teeth dislodged, although it was impossible to determine whether these injuries had been sustained through a fall or her being struck in the face. Furthermore, Simpson concluded all these injuries had been inflicted while the victim was alive and most probably conscious. In his view, Dr. Simpson concluded that, in view of the trauma sustained, the victim had received several stab wounds to the head as she faced her attacker, and that she had attempted to ward off these blows with her hands and arms before attempting to run from her assailant; she had then either stumbled to the ground or fainted, likely dislodging three of her teeth in the fall, before her murderer had inflicted the fatal blow to her skull, with this blow also shattering her cheek bone.

The extent of saponification of body fats in the remaining breast and thigh tissue of the victim, in conjunction with the continuous presence of heat generated by maggot infestation, led Dr. Simpson to revise the length of time the victim had lain undiscovered to one month, meaning the victim had died in early- to mid-September. Moreover, the extensive infestation of maggots indicated she had lain exposed to the elements for a minimum of 24 hours before her murderer had buried her body.

===Search of Hankley Common===
On 12 October, a search team consisting of 60 police constables discovered a heavy, tapered bough of birchwood approximately 350 yards from the burial site. This bough had been sharpened at both ends, and was found just 16 yards from a military tripwire. Upon closer inspection, investigators noted several short strands of blonde human hair crushed into the bark, strongly indicating Wolfe had fallen to the ground at this location before her murderer had used this bough to inflict the vast depressed fracture to her skull. (This theory would be supported by Dr. Simpson, who confirmed the dimensions of this bough perfectly matched the cavity within the victim&#x27;s skull, and that the hair samples upon the instrument matched those retrieved from her scalp.)

Three days later, within a 400-yard radius of the burial site, these officers also discovered numerous personal artefacts belonging to the victim including her shoes and purse, a handbag containing a rosary, a bar of soap, and a distinctive elephant charm. In a dell above where the tripwire and bough had been discovered, officers discovered a crucifix, a National Registration Card issued to one Joan Pearl Wolfe, a blank document issued by the Canadian Army to men requesting permission to marry, and a letter written by Wolfe to a Canadian soldier named August Sangret, informing him of her pregnancy, and her hopes of his agreeing to marry her. Also found were a further fragment of the victim&#x27;s skull, and a tooth.

The personal possessions belonging to the victim were identified by Edith Watts as belonging to her daughter. Furthermore, Superintendent Richard Webb had earlier recognised Wolfe&#x27;s name, having interviewed her in both July and August after she had been taken into custody due to concerns for her welfare, due to her living on the common in makeshift shelters. On both occasions, she had worn a distinctive green-and-white dress like that discovered upon the body, and at Webb&#x27;s own instigation, Wolfe had been sent to hospital. Furthermore, Webb was able to recall her companion had been the Canadian soldier mentioned in the letter discovered close to her body.

==Interrogation==
Following the identification of Wolfe&#x27;s body, Chief Inspector Greeno and Superintendent Richard Webb informally interviewed Sangret at the Godalming army camp where he was stationed on 12 October. In this interview, Sangret freely admitted to having dated Wolfe, but insisted he had not seen her since 14 September, when she had failed to keep a date with him. He had not taken their relationship too seriously, being more interested in a woman he had earlier met in Glasgow. Furthermore, although he had not reported Wolfe as missing to police, he had reported her disappearance to his Provost Sergeant. When shown articles of Wolfe&#x27;s clothing, Sangret formally identified these garments as belonging to her.

Upon interviewing Sangret&#x27;s army colleagues, Inspector Greeno learned of the alternating and conflicting explanations he had given to these men as to Wolfe&#x27;s disappearance, and that his demeanour had alternated between bouts of unperturbedness and anxiety over the previous weeks. Moreover, one colleague remarked to Greeno that, upon learning of the discovery of Wolfe&#x27;s body, Sangret had seemed &quot;on edge&quot;.

===Statement===
Greeno subsequently requested permission from the army to take Sangret to Godalming police station to conduct a formal interview. This request was granted, and Sangret was taken to this police station later that day.

At Godalming police station, Sangret was asked whether he would tell all he knew of Wolfe, and his association with her. In response, he casually replied, &quot;Yes, all right.&quot; The subsequent 17,000-word verbal statement Sangret delivered would prove to be the then-longest statement ever made in British criminal history; taking a policeman four days to compose in longhand in interview sessions totaling almost 19 hours. These interviews were conducted between 12 and 16 October (on 15 October, no interviews were conducted due to Inspector Greeno being occupied with other police matters). In addition to formally interviewing Sangret on these dates, Greeno had Sangret show investigators the various locations he mentioned in his statement, such as Kate Hayter&#x27;s bungalow, and the locations of the two wigwams he had constructed. Throughout the days in which he was questioned, Sangret remained at the police station.

In his statement, Sangret discussed in exhaustive detail his relationship with Wolfe, and his actions following her disappearance. He did concede to having had an argument with Wolfe regarding his reluctance to marry her on the final occasion he had seen her, but denied having either caused her any harm, or any knowledge of her current whereabouts. When questioned as to the whereabouts of his army-issue knife, Sangret claimed he had given this instrument to Wolfe.

After completing his statement on the morning of 16 October, Sangret was released, pending further inquiries. Prior to his release, however, Sangret is known to have informed Greeno: &quot;I suppose you have found her. Everything points to me. I guess I shall get the blame,&quot; before burying his head in his hands.

==Later discoveries and arrest==
Following his formal questioning, Sangret was returned to barracks. His army blanket and uniform had been confiscated at Godalming police station, and sent to a Dr. Roche Lynch at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital to undergo Benzidine testing. Dr. Lynch was able to conclude that both the trousers and blanket had recently been washed in a basic and clumsy manner, and that each garment bore evidence of bloodstains. Furthermore, Lynch was able to deduce that the positioning of the bloodstains within the army blanket was consistent with where blood would have seeped from Wolfe&#x27;s head and arm wounds, had she been wrapped in this garment.

On 27 November 1942, a distinctive knife with a hooked point resembling a parrot&#x27;s beak was discovered by a Private Albert Brown, hidden in a waste pipe within the wash-house at Witley barracks. Brown had discovered this instrument when tasked with clearing a blocked drain; he and a colleague immediately handed this knife to Harold Wade, who in turn forwarded the weapon to the Surrey Police. (Subsequent eyewitness testimony would indicate Sangret had excused himself to wash his hands in this wash-room on 12 October, immediately prior to his initial, informal questioning by Inspector Greeno. He had been alone in the wash-room for between three and four minutes, although the water had been cut off at the time.)

The knife itself was not of Canadian issue, but British Army (although subsequent trial testimony would confirm such a model of knife had been issued to the Canadian Army until 1939). A Canadian soldier named Samuel Crowle had found this knife embedded in a tree close to one of the wigwams Sangret had earlier constructed in mid-August; he had intended to keep the knife due to its unique blade, but had been advised by a colleague to deliver it to a Corporal Thomas Harding, who had in turn handed the knife to Sangret on 26 August, suspecting the knife had belonged to him, given that Crowle had informed him he had found the knife near a wigwam &quot;with some people talking inside&quot;.

Dr. Lynch subjected the knife to similar testing to which he had previously subjected Sangret&#x27;s army blanket and uniform, although this knife—having been immersed in a drainage system for over six weeks—bore no evidence of bloodstains, hair samples or fingerprints. Nonetheless, Doctors Eric Gardner and Keith Simpson each independently examined the weapon on 3 December and concluded only such a knife could have inflicted the wounds discovered on Wolfe&#x27;s skull and arm.

On 6 December, Inspector Greeno interviewed Sangret at the Aldershot barracks where he had recently been transferred, before requesting he accompany investigators to Hankley Common to pinpoint the locations he and Wolfe had lived and frequented. Sangret agreed to this request, although he resolutely refused to enter or even glance in the direction of Houndown Wood. Upon returning to Godalming police station, Sangret agreed to submit to a second formal interview, in which Greeno focused largely upon issues regarding the knives he and Wolfe had owned. In this statement, Sangret stated Wolfe had been in possession of a black-handled knife with a hooked point, which she had been given by Francis Hearn. Shortly after 4 p.m. that afternoon, Sangret was formally charged with the murder of Joan Pearl Wolfe. He was held on remand at Brixton Prison, to await committal hearings.

===Committal hearings===
Formal committal hearings were held in Guildford between 12 and 20 January 1943, and saw 21 members of the Canadian Army testify as eyewitnesses to Sangret&#x27;s relationship with Wolfe; his conflicting and indifferent accounts as to her whereabouts following her disappearance; his being in possession of the knife alleged to have been used in her murder; and his movements on critical dates. In addition, Doctors Simpson, Gardner and Lynch each testified as to their collective forensic findings upon Wolfe&#x27;s body and Sangret&#x27;s clothing and army blanket. Also to testify at these committal hearings was Inspector Greeno, who read in full Sangret&#x27;s voluminous statements to the court before testifying as to Sangret&#x27;s admission prior to his initial release from custody that he had deduced these official matters were in motion due to her body being found.

On 20 January, Mr Justice Macnaghten declared enough evidence had been presented to warrant Sangret being brought to trial, and set a date of 24 February for the trial to commence at the Surrey County Hall.

==Trial==
The trial of August Sangret for the murder of Joan Pearl Wolfe began at the Surrey County Hall on 24 February 1943. He was tried before Mr Justice Macnaghten and a jury. The clerk of assize opened proceedings on this date by asking Sangret to stand to hear a formal recitation of the charge, and to state his plea. Sangret formally stated his plea of not guilty to the charge against him; the Clerk then informed the jury: &quot;It is for you to say whether he is guilty or not guilty, and to hearken to the evidence.&quot;

In his opening statement on behalf of the Crown, Eric Neve outlined the prosecution&#x27;s intention to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Sangret had murdered Wolfe—whom he referred to as &quot;the Wigwam Girl&quot;—on or about 14 September 1942. Neve then defined for the jury the very definition of the crime of murder, before outlining the relationship between the decedent and the accused; quoting from letters exchanged between the two and harking to the two wigwams Sangret had constructed on Hankley Common and in which he had lived with the decedent in the weeks prior to her murder. Neve further outlined the prosecution&#x27;s contention that Sangret had constructed these wigwams with the same distinctive knife he had subsequently used in her murder, before displaying Exhibits 3 and 4: the birch bough used to inflict the substantial fracture to the rear of her skull, and the distinctive black-handled knife with a hooked point, which he had attempted to conceal at Witley barracks.

Neve further outlined that Sangret had told several conflicting stories of Wolfe&#x27;s whereabouts in the weeks she had been missing, and that forensic experts would testify that only a distinctive knife such as Exhibit 4 could have inflicted the wounds discovered on Wolfe&#x27;s forehead. Furthermore, Neve stated that bloodstains had been discovered on Sangret&#x27;s trousers and army blanket, and that Dr. Roche Lynch would testify as to the positioning of the bloodstains found upon the army blanket being consistent with where blood would have seeped from Wolfe&#x27;s head and arm wounds, indicating Sangret had initially wrapped her body in this garment.

Sangret&#x27;s lawyer, Linton Thorp, rejected the prosecution&#x27;s contention that the knife alleged to have been the murder weapon had belonged to Sangret in his opening speech for the defence; emphasising his client&#x27;s insistence that he had never owned such a knife and adding that the knife in question was of British Army issue as opposed to Canadian. Furthermore, Thorp added that a knife found some 23 paces from the murder scene had been discarded by a policeman who had initially attached no importance to the find, and that repeated searches to relocate this knife had been unsuccessful.

Thorp further elaborated on Sangret&#x27;s insistence he had loved Wolfe; informing the jurors that several letters written by Wolfe had been found in his possession at the time of his arrest and that, following her disappearance, Sangret had made efforts to locate her. Moreover, Thorp emphasised that Wolfe&#x27;s history of liaising with soldiers in the two years prior to her murder, coupled with her solitary and nomadic lifestyle, meant any number of the 100,000 soldiers stationed in the vicinity of Witley and Thursley could have been her actual murderer.

===Witness testimony===
Formal witness testimony began on the first day of the trial, with 17 prosecution witnesses called to testify on this date, including the Detective Superintendent of the Surrey Constabulary, who formally introduced into evidence the birch bough murder weapon found on Hankley Common the previous October, and the knife forwarded to Surrey Police by Provost Sergeant Harold Wade. Also to testify was Wolfe&#x27;s mother, Edith Watts, who formally identified her daughter&#x27;s crucifix, purse, and elephant charm which had all been found in and around the dell where her daughter had been attacked, and Sergeant Charles Hicks, who testified as to his regularly reading Wolfe&#x27;s letters to Sangret, then composing his replies. Hicks further testified that Sangret had only informed him of Wolfe&#x27;s disappearance on 27 September.

The second day of the trial saw a further 20 prosecution witnesses called to testify, most of whom were military personnel summonsed to testify as to Sangret&#x27;s conduct with Wolfe prior to her murder, his evident reluctance to commit to the marriage Wolfe had evidently yearned for, his infidelity throughout his relationship with Wolfe, and the differing and contradictory explanations he had given as to her disappearance. One of these witnesses was Provost Sergeant Harold Wade, who testified that Sangret had only informed him of Wolfe&#x27;s disappearance on 21 September, and that Sangret had informed him of the final conversation he had had with Wolfe prior to her disappearance on this date. According to Wade, when Wolfe—weeping openly—had asked Sangret whether he &quot;care[d] to marry [her] or not&quot;, Sangret had responded, &quot;No, I don&#x27;t&quot;. Upon hearing this, Wade testified he had advised Sangret to simply forget her, to which Sangret had replied the reason for his visit was that, had anything happened to Wolfe, he did not wish to be involved in the matter.

Also called to testify on this date was Private Samuel Crowle, who had found the knife introduced as Exhibit 4 close to the second wigwam Sangret had constructed on Hankley Common the previous August. Crowle formally identified the knife as being that which he had discovered on the common and had briefly retained before handing to his superior due to its distinctive blade and a &quot;little nick&quot; he had noted the knife bore. In addition to Crowle&#x27;s testimony, an American soldier named Raymond Deadman also testified on 25 February as to his becoming acquainted with Wolfe in the week prior to her murder, and to his observing Sangret&#x27;s possessive nature. In response to questioning by Eric Neve, Deadman explained he had become acquainted with Wolfe on 4 September, and that she had introduced him to Sangret on this date. The following day, he had walked across the common in her company, before they had encountered Sangret, who, Deadman testified, had become angry at seeing her in his company. According to Deadman, Sangret then chided a visibly nervous Wolfe for leaving &quot;the shack&quot; without his permission.

One of the final witnesses to testify on the second day of the trial was Private Joseph Arsenault, who had been stationed at Witley Camp between July and October 1942, and had become acquainted with Sangret. Arsenault testified as to his observing Sangret, alone, cleaning his trousers in the camp wash-room in an effort to remove dark stains he (Arsenault) had seen on the garment. In response to cross-examination by Linton Thorp, Arsenault conceded he could not pinpoint the precise date he had seen Sangret washing his trousers in the wash-room, and that the date in question could have been anytime he had been stationed at Witley Camp.

The knife the prosecution contended had inflicted the distinctive injuries to Wolfe&#x27;s forehead was introduced in evidence as Exhibit 4, with Corporal Thomas Harding testifying as to his handing this weapon to Sangret on 26 August. In response to questioning by his defence, Sangret denied he had ever seen the knife introduced into evidence, and claimed he had never being given such a weapon by Corporal Harding. Furthermore, Sangret described the knife he had used to construct both wigwams as belonging to Wolfe. This weapon, he claimed, had both a marlin spike and a can opener, and he had been informed by Wolfe that the knife had been given to her by Francis Hearn. In addition, Sangret insisted he had never taken his own army-issue knife off barracks.

Two of the prosecution&#x27;s main witnesses were Drs Keith Simpson and Eric Gardner, who testified on the second and third days of the trial respectively. Both pathologists testified as to the recovery of Wolfe&#x27;s body—which they noted had been &quot;covered, rather than buried&quot;—and their subsequent examination of her remains, both in situ on the common, and—with regards to Dr. Simpson—at Guy&#x27;s Hospital. With the aid of enlarged photographs of the wounds discovered upon Wolfe&#x27;s skull, Dr. Simpson testified that only a knife such as that with the &quot;peculiarities&quot; of the one discovered hidden in the waste pipe at Witley barracks could have inflicted the distinctive circular wounds discovered upon Wolfe&#x27;s skull. In relation to the partially extracted muscle tissue and ligaments discovered in the victim&#x27;s right forearm and hand, Simpson confirmed such trauma could only have occurred through a distinctive, hooked blade retaining the tissue upon extraction.

Against overruled objections from Linton Thorp, Dr. Simpson then retrieved Wolfe&#x27;s skull from a cardboard box to demonstrate for the jury just how this knife fitted the wounds discovered in Wolfe&#x27;s skull, and how the channel tracts to the right of each wound again matched the dimensions of Exhibit 4. Simpson also explained to the jury how the positioning of these wounds indicated she had likely been facing her right-handed attacker when these wounds were delivered. Although both Simpson and Gardner conceded the knife introduced as Exhibit 4 may not have been the actual murder weapon as opposed to another, precise replica issue, both pathologists dismissed the possibility that any standard-issue American or Canadian Army knife presented before them could have created these distinctive, countersink wounds. (No other soldier stationed at Witley Camp had been in possession of such a weapon.)

Following the testimony of Dr. Gardner, Dr. Roche Lynch took the witness stand to discuss the results of the Benzidine tests he had conducted upon Sangret&#x27;s army blanket, uniform, water-bottle, and the knife discovered at Witley barracks. Lynch testified that both the uniform and blanket had recently been washed, albeit clumsily. Nonetheless, through conducting Benzidine tests upon each garment, he had concluded each bore evidence of bloodstains, whereas no blood had been discovered on the knife or water-bottle.

In cross-examination of Dr. Lynch, Linton Thorp did succeed in getting Lynch to concede the washing of the garments in question prior to their examination meant he (Lynch) could not definitively state these stains had originated from human blood. Thorp then attempted to suggest these stains, if sourcing from human blood, may have been caused through human scratching through lice infestation; Dr. Lynch countered this assertion by stating it would be physically impossible to produce such extensive staining through scratching.

===Defence testimony===
On 26 February, Linton Thorp called Sangret to testify on his own behalf (this testimony would last until 1 March). In response to questioning from his counsel, Sangret chronologically discussed his two-month courtship with Wolfe, the improvised homes he had built for her, and their marriage plans. In a direct contradiction to the earlier testimony of several of his colleagues and Provost Sergeant Harold Wade (whom he contended were simply lying), Sangret claimed he had fully intended to marry Wolfe, and denied either arguing with her on the final occasion he had seen her on 13 September, or ever refusing to marry her. In relation to the knife Corporal Thomas Harding had given to him on 26 August, Sangret emphatically denied he had been given the knife the prosecution contended he had used in her murder on this date, and insisted he had been given a distinctly different, Canadian-issue knife introduced into evidence as Exhibit 34.

Upon completion of defence counsel questioning, Sangret was subjected to an intense cross-examination by Eric Neve, who repeatedly raised the inconsistencies, contradictions and &quot;convenience&quot; in Sangret&#x27;s claims—both in his trial testimony and the two statements he had given to Inspector Greeno—as opposed to the witness testimony and forensic evidence presented. These questions related to such issues as Sangret&#x27;s accounts of his whereabouts both before and after Wolfe&#x27;s disappearance; his evident infidelity in light of his claims of his intentions to marry her; his claims he had never argued with Wolfe; his denial of ever being in possession of the knife introduced into evidence; and the numerous, differing, earlier explanations he had given to his colleagues and his Provost Sergeant as to Wolfe&#x27;s disappearance.

===Closing arguments===
The trial of August Sangret lasted nine days, and saw 52 witnesses testify on behalf of the prosecution, with only Sangret himself testifying in his own defence. Following the conclusion of Neve&#x27;s cross-examination of Sangret on 2 March, both prosecution and defence attorneys delivered their closing arguments to the jury. In the closing argument delivered by the prosecution, Eric Neve outlined the testimony presented by forensic experts, investigators and Sangret&#x27;s fellow servicemen on behalf of the prosecution; all of which Neve asserted, when combined, sufficiently proved Sangret had slain &quot;this unfortunate girl&quot; before vainly attempting to establish an alibi and conceal the murder weapon.

Following the prosecution&#x27;s closing argument, Linton Thorp argued on behalf of the defence. In his closing argument, Thorp reiterated his client&#x27;s love for Wolfe, and stated that all evidence and testimony presented by the prosecution was circumstantial. Thorp further emphasised to the jury that no conclusive proof existed that Sangret had murdered Wolfe.

Upon completion of both counsels&#x27; closing arguments, Macnaghten delivered his final instructions to the jury: &quot;That the girl was murdered is not in dispute; that she was murdered by some man is also quite plain. The only question you have to determine is: Have the Crown satisfied you beyond all real doubt that the prisoner, August Sangret, is the man who murdered her? I can only conclude by saying what I said at the beginning: when dealing with a case of circumstantial evidence, you must be satisfied beyond all doubt before you find the prisoner is guilty.&quot;

Following this final instruction from Macnaghten, the jury retired to consider their verdict, taking Wolfe&#x27;s skull and the knife alleged by the prosecution to have inflicted the preliminary stab wounds to her body to assist in their deliberations.

==Conviction==
The jury deliberated for two hours before announcing they had reached their verdict: Sangret was found guilty of Wolfe&#x27;s murder, although this verdict was accompanied with a strong recommendation as to mercy. Passing sentence, Mr Justice Macnaghten donned his formal black cap and made the following speech:

Before Macnaghten passed this death sentence, Sangret was asked by the clerk of assize whether he wished to address the court. In response, Sangret declared: &quot;I am not guilty, sir. I never killed that girl.&quot;

===Appeal===
Following his conviction, August Sangret uncustomarily filed a notice of appeal against his sentence on his own behalf, without first consulting his defence counsel. His appeal was heard on 13 April before three judges in the Court of Appeal: the Lord Chief Justice (the Viscount Caldecote), Mr Justice Humphreys, and Mr Justice Lewis. As was customary, both original counsels were present at this hearing, although as Sangret&#x27;s appeal had been filed without his first consulting with his defence counsel, neither Linton Thorp or his co-counsel, Laurence Vine, were able to challenge either the trial conduct or the verdict beyond the contents of Sangret&#x27;s personal appeal (in which he had simply stated his disagreement with the guilty verdict, proclaimed his innocence, and claimed that he had not owned the knife identified as being used in Wolfe&#x27;s murder). Nonetheless, Thorp did emphasise the jury&#x27;s strong recommendation to mercy.

The same day they had convened to hear Sangret&#x27;s appeal, the Court of Appeal upheld his conviction, ruling there had been no evidence presented to attest to either trial misconduct or Sangret&#x27;s innocence, adding they had further chosen to summarily dismiss the appeal due to &quot;the abundance of evidence the appellant was the murderer of the girl&quot;, further stating there had been &quot;no possible ground on which the verdict could be disturbed&quot;. Issues relating to the jury&#x27;s recommendation to mercy were lodged with the Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison, who shortly thereafter upheld Sangret&#x27;s death sentence.
==Execution==
August Sangret was held in the condemned cell at Wandsworth Prison, to await execution. He was hanged by Albert Pierrepoint at 9 a.m. on 29 April 1943. The official cause of death upon Sangret&#x27;s death certificate reads: &quot;Injury to brain and spinal cord consequent upon judicial hanging.&quot;

Following his execution, Sangret was interred in an unmarked grave inside the grounds of Wandsworth Prison. Prior to his burial on the afternoon of 29 April, Dr. Keith Simpson performed an autopsy on Sangret&#x27;s body, during which he found a tattoo on his arm bearing Joan Wolfe&#x27;s name.

==Aftermath==
* The Canadian Army authorities did not protest Sangret&#x27;s conviction and sentencing, having passed the civil authority pertaining to cases involving their serving personnel charged with treason, murder, manslaughter, rape or treason-felony while stationed in the United Kingdom to the British courts shortly after Canada had joined the Second World War.
* Private August Sangret was posthumously inducted onto a 3 May 1943 list of Canadian servicemen who had died while serving overseas. Sangret&#x27;s entry onto this list simply reads: &quot;Royal Canadian Service Corps. – Sangret, August, Pte. L27572.&quot; Officially, his death is listed within the Regina Rifle Regiment as having occurred while &quot;serving with other units&quot;. 
* A plaque within the grounds of the Brookwood Military Cemetery commemorates Private August Sangret; he is one of 18 people convicted of murder and executed by hanging who is commemorated upon this memorial. Sangret&#x27;s entry can be found on Panel 23, Column 3. 
* Each individual convicted of murder is commemorated within the Brookwood Military Cemetery due to the fact their respective regiments failed to discharge the condemned person prior to their execution. Therefore, officially, each condemned man was executed while still a serving member of the armed forces.
* Although Joan Wolfe&#x27;s lifestyle had been called into question at the trial, one prosecution witness defended her character and intentions: Superintendent Richard Webb of the Surrey CID, who had questioned Wolfe after she had been brought into custody on 23 August due to concerns for her welfare. Like others in authority before him, Webb had noted her as being &quot;in need of protection&quot; and, on the occasion he had seen her, had observed her as being &quot;somewhat dirty&quot;. Webb testified to having repeatedly spoken with Wolfe in great detail; noting her soft-spoken and quiet manner. In defence of her character, Webb conceded that, although her lifestyle was somewhat immoral, she had been fiercely loyal to any one soldier at a time, in the hope he would marry her and provide her with the eventual security and stability she desired.
* In his memoirs, published in 1960, Inspector Edward Greeno confided his conducting the formal interview with Sangret at Godalming police station on 12 October had subsequently proven illegal, as Sangret had been held without charge for five days—four days longer than the law of habeas corpus allowed. Greeno confided he had been extremely concerned this issue may have been raised in court, adding that, prior to trial, he had been contacted by then-Assistant Commissioner Sir Norman Kendal on this very issue. However, for reasons unknown, neither Linton Thorp or his co-counsel, Laurence Vine, chose to raise this issue at Sangret&#x27;s trial or subsequent appeal.
* Despite his conceding the case against Sangret may have been &quot;flung out [of court] then and there&quot; had Sangret&#x27;s defence raised the issue of his breaching the law of habeas corpus, Greeno nonetheless reiterated his conviction of Sangret&#x27;s guilt in what he recollected as being &quot;nearly the perfect crime: a murder not only unsolved, but undiscovered.&quot; Greeno did, however, theorise as to Sangret&#x27;s motive:I had interviewed thousands of people in this case, and seventy-four of them went into the witness-box. The case was so watertight that, as Sir Norman Kendal said later, Sangret&#x27;s appeal against the death sentence was almost a farce. One small doubt remained: Sangret murdered the girl because she was expecting his child—but was she? Was she expecting anybody&#x27;s child? The doctors didn&#x27;t think so on the occasion that the police sent her to hospital, and when her body was found, it was too late to tell. But this is certain: Sangret did murder her. He confessed before he died ... It is never announced when a murderer confesses. But why not? There are always cranks and crackpots to argue that some wicked policeman has framed some poor fellow. So why make an official secret of the fact that the policeman did his job?

==Media==
* The case of &quot;the Wigwam Murder&quot; has twice been dramatised by British radio scriptwriter and screenwriter Harry Alan Towers. Firstly as &quot;The Case of the Hunted Hunter&quot; in the radio crime drama series, &quot;Secrets of Scotland Yard&quot;.
* The second radio crime drama focusing upon &quot;the Wigwam Murder&quot; was broadcast in 1952 under the title of &quot;The Brass Button&quot; as part of the syndicated series &quot;The Black Museum&quot;.
* Discovery Channel (UK) have also broadcast an episode detailing the case of August Sangret as part of the series &quot;Crime Museum UK&quot;. This episode is entitled, &quot;Strange Weapons&quot;, and was first broadcast in 2014.
* The &quot;Crime Museum U.K.&quot; episode pertaining to the &quot;Wigwam Murder&quot; has also been broadcast via radio under the same title of &quot;Strange Weapons&quot;.
* &quot;Catching History&#x27;s Criminals&quot;, a BBC forensics series, has also broadcast an episode featuring the case of August Sangret. This episode, entitled &quot;Instruments of Murder&quot;, was first broadcast on 2 July 2015.
* The sole book exclusively devoted to the case of August Sangret, M. J. Trow&#x27;s &quot;The Wigwam Murder&quot;, calls into question the validity of Sangret&#x27;s guilt. Trow argues Sangret had no motive to murder Wolfe, due to his impending overseas deployment.

<text>The Comedy Writer is a 1998 novel by American filmmaker Peter Farrelly.

The story revolves around Henry Halloran, a young man who quits his sales job in New England and moves to Los Angeles to pursue his dream of becoming a comedic screenwriter. Henry&#x27;s pursuit is an arduous one, involving many humiliating rejections, low-paying waitstaff jobs to pay the bills, and a grating, unwanted female roommate.

Because many of the exploits of the protagonist are similar or identical to Peter Farrelly&#x27;s own life, it is believed that this novel is partly (or mostly) autobiographical.

<doc id="1008145" wikidata="Q172221" url="?curid=1008145" title="Slovenia national football team">
<text>The Slovenia national football team () represents Slovenia in men&#x27;s international football and is controlled by the Football Association of Slovenia, the governing body for football in Slovenia. The national squad is under the global jurisdiction of FIFA and is governed in Europe by UEFA. It competes in the three major professional tournaments available to European nations: the FIFA World Cup, UEFA Nations League and the UEFA European Championship. Slovenia played its first official match in 1992, one year after the country gained independence from Yugoslavia. The majority of Slovenia&#x27;s home matches are played at Stožice Stadium in Ljubljana.

Slovenia have qualified for a major tournament four times, twice for the FIFA World Cup and twice for the UEFA European Championship. They failed to progress from the group stage of these tournaments in their first three appearances, before finally doing so at UEFA Euro 2024, when Slovenia qualified for the knockout stages by drawing all three group stage matches and being one of the best third-place teams. At the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Slovenia achieved their first (and so far only) victory in a major tournament, defeating Algeria 1–0. Other noteworthy results include a 1–0 win over Italy in 2004, which was Italy&#x27;s only defeat in the entire 2006 World Cup campaign (qualifiers and the final tournament).

Boštjan Cesar holds the record for most appearances for Slovenia, having played 101 times between 2003 and 2018. Zlatko Zahovič scored 35 goals for Slovenia and is the record holder for most goals scored.

==History==

===Origins and pre-independence years (1921–1991)===
Before Slovenia&#x27;s independence in 1991, the national football team of Slovenia existed only as a regional team, not officially recognised by FIFA. On 23 June 1921, the Slovenian capital of Ljubljana hosted a match between France and a selection of players from Slovenian clubs. One of the guests at the match was acting FIFA president Jules Rimet, who later initiated the first FIFA World Cup tournament. The French team won the match 5–0 and, although the match was not official by international standards, it was, at least in Slovenia, generally accepted as the first appearance of the Slovenia national team. In the following decades, Slovenia played several unofficial friendly matches, including in 1956 against China, in 1968 against Austria, in 1990 against Bosnia and Herzegovina and in 1991 against Croatia.

===Independence, first victory and first qualifiers (1992–1998)===
In 1992, one year after Slovenia&#x27;s independence from Yugoslavia, the Football Association of Slovenia was admitted to UEFA and FIFA. In the same year, on 3 June, Slovenia played its first FIFA-recognised game, a friendly match against Estonia in Tallinn. The match ended in a 1–1 draw, with the first official goal for the team being scored by Igor Benedejčič. The first coach was Bojan Prašnikar. On 7 April 1993, the two teams played another friendly, and this time Slovenia achieved its first international victory by winning the match 2–0.

In 1994, managed by Zdenko Verdenik, Slovenia debuted in official competitions as the team competed in the UEFA Euro 1996 qualifiers. Slovenia played in Group 4 and finished in fifth place out of six teams, with eleven points. In the opening match of the qualifiers, Slovenia drew 1–1 at home against 1994 World Cup finalists Italy. In 1998 World Cup qualification, Slovenia was drawn with Denmark, Croatia, Greece and Bosnia and Herzegovina, finishing in last place after registering just one point in eight matches.

===Golden generation (1998–2002)===

====UEFA Euro 2000 campaign====
In July 1998, Srečko Katanec was appointed as the new manager of the team. Under his guidance, Slovenia finished the UEFA Euro 2000 qualifiers in second place, only behind Norway. Zlatko Zahovič scored eight of Slovenia&#x27;s twelve goals in the qualifiers. In the additional play-offs, Slovenia faced Ukraine. The first leg was played in Ljubljana, which Slovenia won 2–1 after trailing 1–0. Zahovič scored Slovenia&#x27;s first goal, and Milenko Ačimovič scored a goal from the halfway line late in the match to make the score 2–1. The second match was played in snowy conditions in Kyiv. Serhii Rebrov scored from the penalty spot in the 68th minute to give Ukraine a lead, while Slovenia equalised eight minutes later with a goal by Miran Pavlin. The 1–1 draw meant that Slovenia won 3–2 on aggregate and qualified for its first major tournament.
At Euro 2000, Slovenia were drawn into Group C, together with Spain, FR Yugoslavia and Norway. In the first game, Slovenia played against Yugoslavia and took a 3–0 lead after one hour of play, with Zahovič scoring twice and Pavlin once. However, Yugoslavia made a comeback as they scored three goals in just six minutes for a 3–3 draw, despite playing with only ten players after Siniša Mihajlović was sent off. The second game against Spain was played in Amsterdam. Spain took a 1–0 lead with a goal by Raúl, but Slovenia equalised after one hour of play as Zahovič scored his third goal of the tournament. Just a minute later, Spain were leading again as Joseba Etxeberria scored the winning goal. In the last match of the group stage, Slovenia played against Norway and still had a chance to progress to the quarterfinals. The match finished in a goalless draw and Slovenia won its second point of the tournament, but were eliminated.
====2002 FIFA World Cup campaign====
For the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, Slovenia were drawn into a group with Russia, FR Yugoslavia, Switzerland, Faroe Islands and Luxembourg. In its first five qualifying games, Slovenia won only one match (away at Luxembourg). Underdogs Faroe Islands held them to a 2–2 draw, after the Slovenes were leading 2–0 with less than five minutes remaining. In the next five matches, Slovenia won four, including a last minute victory over Russia. The team finished in second place without a single defeat and advanced to the play-off stage, where they faced Romania. Slovenia came from a goal down to win the first game 2–1 with the goals from Ačimovič in the first half and Milan Osterc in the second half. In the second leg in Bucharest, Slovenia took the lead with a goal scored by Mladen Rudonja. The final result was 1–1, and Slovenia qualified for its second consecutive major tournament and first ever World Cup.

At the World Cup, Slovenia played in Group B with Spain, Paraguay and South Africa. In the first game, Slovenia faced Spain in a Euro 2000 rematch. Spain took the lead in the first half with a goal from Raúl. Juan Carlos Valerón scored Spain&#x27;s second goal with fifteen minutes remaining. A few minutes later, Sebastjan Cimirotič scored the first World Cup goal for Slovenia to cut the lead in half, before Fernando Hierro scored in the 87th minute for a 3–1 Spanish victory. The match is notable due to the conflict between manager Katanec and star player Zahovič, after which Katanec announced his retirement after the tournament, while Zahovič was expelled from the team and sent home. Slovenia lost the two remaining matches against South Africa (1–0) and Paraguay (3–1) and finished last in the group with three defeats.

===Decline (2003–2007)===
After the resignation of Katanec, Prašnikar took over the team on a four-year contract. The team underwent major changes, with several key players retiring from the national team.

In the Euro 2004 qualifying campaign, Slovenia played against France, Israel, Cyprus and Malta. The team finished in second place with four wins out of eight games, however, they lost both matches against France without scoring any goals. In the play-offs, Slovenia played against its biggest rivals, Croatia. The first leg was played in Zagreb, where Croatia took the lead as Dado Pršo scored a goal in the fifth minute, while Slovenia equalised in the 22nd minute with a goal by Ermin Šiljak, for the final score of 1–1. In the second leg, Pršo scored the only goal of the game 15 minutes into the second half. Croatia qualified for Euro 2004 by winning 2–1 on aggregate, despite Šiljak scoring a total of nine goals in the whole campaign and becoming the top goalscorer of the whole Euro qualification tournament.

In May 2004, Prašnikar was replaced by Branko Oblak. Under Oblak&#x27;s management, Slovenia played in the 2006 World Cup qualifiers. Grouped with Italy, Norway, Scotland, Belarus and Moldova, the team started with victories over Moldova and Italy and a draw against Scotland, but still finished in fourth place after securing only five points in the remaining seven matches. With the victory over Italy, Slovenia became the only team to beat the eventual world champions, as Italy did not lose another game during the entire campaign (qualifiers and the final tournament).

Grouped with the Netherlands, Romania, Bulgaria, Belarus, Albania and Luxembourg in Euro 2008 qualifying, the team started out with defeats to Bulgaria and Belarus, thus significantly reducing their chances to qualify, and as a result, in November 2006, Oblak was dismissed by the Football Association of Slovenia. During his two-year stint as the manager, Oblak used over forty different players.

In January 2007, Matjaž Kek was appointed as the new manager of the national team. He led Slovenia in the remainder of the Euro 2008 qualifiers, where Slovenia finished in sixth place, only above Luxembourg.

===2010 World Cup campaign (2008–2011)===

For the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, Slovenia were drawn into a group with the Czech Republic, Poland, Northern Ireland, Slovakia and San Marino. In its opening match, Slovenia held Poland to a 1–1 draw in Wrocław, before winning two consecutive home games against Slovakia and Northern Ireland. Slovenia then won only one point in two games against the Czech Republic and lost away to Northern Ireland, and thus fell to fifth place in the group. However, the team greatly improved its form and won the last four games without conceding a single goal. As runners-up, Slovenia qualified for the play-offs, where they were drawn against Russia. The first leg was played in Moscow. The match ended in a 2–1 win for the home side, and in the second leg, held in Maribor, Slovenia defeated Russia 1–0 with a goal by Zlatko Dedić. Slovenia advanced to the finals due to the away goals rule. The top scorer of the national team during the qualifying campaign was Milivoje Novaković with five goals.

At the World Cup, Slovenia played in Group C alongside England, Algeria and the United States. In the opening game against Algeria, Slovenia achieved its first ever World Cup win after Robert Koren scored the only goal in the match. In their second game against the United States, Slovenia were leading 2–0 at half-time with goals from Valter Birsa and Zlatan Ljubijankić, however, Landon Donovan and Michael Bradley scored in the second half for the United States. In their last match of the group stage, Slovenia lost to England 1–0 with a goal by Jermain Defoe. As the United States defeated Algeria with a late goal, Slovenia dropped to third place and were eliminated from the tournament.

After the 2010 World Cup, Slovenia achieved their highest ever position in the FIFA World Rankings, as the team was ranked 15th in October 2010. However, Slovenia started the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifiers with an unexpected home defeat against Northern Ireland. Two defeats against Italy and a home defeat against Estonia meant that Slovenia finished only in fourth place in the group, behind Italy, Estonia and Serbia.

===Katanec&#x27;s second spell and management changes (2011–2018)===
In October 2011, the Football Association of Slovenia appointed Slaviša Stojanović as the new manager. He led the team in only nine matches, including the first four matches of the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, where Slovenia recorded one victory and three defeats. He was sacked by the end of 2012 and was replaced by Katanec, who had previously led the team between 1998 and 2002. Under his leadership, Slovenia lost at home to Iceland, before winning four consecutive games to finish third in the group, two points behind Iceland. 

In the qualifiers for UEFA Euro 2016, Slovenia came close to directly qualifying for the tournament for the first time. The team lost a decisive game away to Switzerland. Slovenia led 2–0 with less than 15 minutes remaining, but the Swiss then scored three times to win 3–2. As the third-placed team, Slovenia advanced to the play-offs, where they were eliminated by Ukraine 3–1 on aggregate. The qualifiers for the 2018 World Cup were similar, as Slovenia narrowly lost two decisive away matches against Slovakia and England. After the defeat at Wembley Stadium, where Harry Kane scored the only goal of the match in the 94th minute, Katanec announced his resignation as the manager. In December 2017, Tomaž Kavčič became the new manager.

In 2018, Slovenia competed in the inaugural edition of the UEFA Nations League. In accordance with the FIFA World Rankings, the team competed in the third-tier League C along with Bulgaria, Cyprus and Norway. After the poor run of results, in which Slovenia obtained only one point in the first four matches, Kavčič was sacked. He became the manager with the shortest tenure in Slovenian history, leading the team in only seven games. As Slovenia finished last in the group, they were relegated to the bottom tier League D, but UEFA changed the system for the next edition and the team remained in League C.

===Kek&#x27;s second spell, Nations League promotion, and Euro 2024 (2019–present)===
Kek was appointed as the manager for the second time in November 2018. Slovenia failed to make a breakthrough during the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifiers, losing both games against Austria and obtaining only one point against North Macedonia. Despite the unexpected 2–0 home victory against Poland, Slovenia finished fourth in the group. However, in the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League C, Slovenia remained undefeated in all six games against Greece, Moldova and Kosovo. Under the leadership of team captain Jan Oblak, Slovenia held Greece to a 0–0 draw in both matches and also obtained all twelve available points against Moldova and Kosovo, thus securing first place in the group and promotion to League B for the 2022–23 edition. In the 2022 World Cup qualifiers, Slovenia once again failed to qualify for the main event; they started the campaign with a 1–0 home victory against Croatia with a goal by Sandi Lovrić, which was Slovenia&#x27;s first victory over their neighbours after failing to beat them in the previous eight official matches. After two narrow defeats against Russia and a surprising defeat to Cyprus, Slovenia finished fourth in the group with four wins in ten matches, behind Croatia, Russia and Slovakia.

In 2022, Slovenia made their maiden appearance in League B of the Nations League, and avoided relegation after finishing third in a group with Serbia, Norway and Sweden. Benjamin Šeško scored three of Slovenia&#x27;s six goals in the competition, including a goal in the decisive 1–1 away draw to Sweden that secured a crucial point on the last matchday.

In the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifiers, Slovenia finally ended its major tournament drought and qualified for the Euro finals for the first time in 24 years. Šeško was once again one of the key players, scoring five goals in nine appearances, including a goal in the decisive home game against Kazakhstan on the final matchday, which Slovenia won 2–1 in front of 16,432 spectators, a record home attendance for the Slovenia national team. The team finished the qualifiers in second place, behind only Denmark, with a record tally of 22 points from 10 games. In addition, it was also the first time that Slovenia directly qualified for a major tournament without having to play an additional play-off.

At the Euro finals in Germany, Slovenia advanced from the group stage for the first time at a major tournament after drawing all three matches in their group against Denmark, Serbia and England, before being eliminated in the round of 16 on penalties by Portugal, finishing the tournament undefeated after regular time.

===Nickname and mascot===
The Slovenia national team does not have an official nickname and was the only team at the 2010 World Cup and the 2024 European Championship without one. During the 2010 World Cup qualifiers, Slovenian journalists and the Football Association of Slovenia tried to choose a nickname for the team, but the process failed to gain the support of fans. In 2010, the Slovenian web portal Siol organized a fan vote and the nickname &quot;Kekci&quot;, a reference to the Slovenian fictional child character Kekec and the then national team manager Matjaž Kek, finished in first place. However, the nickname was never officially adopted by the Football Association of Slovenia. &quot;Kekci&quot; is still occasionally used by the Slovenian media when referring to the national team.

During the 2010 World Cup, some foreign media articles used the nickname &quot;Zmajčeki&quot; () when referring to the Slovenian national team, however, this was the old nickname of Slovenian club Olimpija Ljubljana when they competed in the Yugoslav football system. Because Olimpija had a long tradition in the former Yugoslav First League, football fans and the media in the countries of the former Yugoslavia still use this nickname today when referring to the Slovenian team.

In 2002, Slovenia received an official mascot for its appearance at the 2002 World Cup. The mascot, called Trigi, is based on a round shape representing the Earth or a ball, with a stylized depiction of Triglav, the highest Slovenian mountain, on its head in a green, white and blue colour combination.

===Kits and colours===
Until 1993, Slovenia played its matches in white, blue and red, which are the traditional colours of the country. In 1993, the board of the Football Association of Slovenia decided to change the main colours to green and white, inspired by NK Olimpija from the capital city of Ljubljana.

In December 2009, the board voted to change the kit&#x27;s colours to white for home matches and blue for away matches. The new colours came into effect in April 2012, when a new all-white home kit with a blue and green trim was unveiled. The new away kit, introduced a couple of months earlier, was all-blue with a white and green trim. In 2016, the all-green version returned as an away kit, while the light blue kit became the new home kit. In 2022, the new Slovenian kits were selected through an online fan vote for the first time. The home colours were again changed to all-white and the away colours to all-blue.

For their World Cup appearances in 2002 and 2010, the Slovenian kit featured a stylized depiction of Triglav. Since 2010, the depiction has been used on each new kit set.

====Kit suppliers====
Nike has been the team&#x27;s kit provider since 2007. Previously, the kit providers were Puma, Adidas, Uhlsport, and Kappa.

===Home stadium===
Slovenia&#x27;s home matches have been held at ten venues in eight cities. Since 2010, most matches have been played in Ljubljana at the Stožice Stadium, with a seating capacity of 16,038. The final training sessions and physical preparation of the team before domestic matches are held at the National Football Centre Brdo in Predoslje.

The first home stadium of Slovenia was the Bežigrad Stadium, located in the Bežigrad District in Ljubljana. It was the main stadium of the national team until 2004, when UEFA banned it due to insufficient infrastructure. In the same year, the newly built Arena Petrol in Celje became the new main venue of the team for the next three years. For the 2010 World Cup qualifiers, Slovenia moved to the recently renovated Ljudski vrt stadium in Maribor, where the team remained undefeated in their six home matches during the qualifying campaign (five wins and a draw), consequently qualifying for the main tournament. Stožice were built in 2010, and since then the venue has hosted most of the national team&#x27;s home matches. The venue also holds the record for the highest home attendance of the Slovenia national team, as 16,432 spectators gathered for the final match of the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifiers against Kazakhstan on 20 November 2023, which saw Slovenia qualify for the Euros. The attendance record was later equaled in March 2024, when Slovenia defeated Portugal in a friendly match, ending their eleven-game winning streak.

Other venues where Slovenia played at least one home match are the Bonifika Stadium in Koper, Fazanerija City Stadium in Murska Sobota, Domžale Sports Park in Domžale, Nova Gorica Sports Park in Nova Gorica, Stanko Mlakar Stadium in Kranj, and ŽŠD Ljubljana Stadium in Ljubljana.

===Rivalries===
Slovenia&#x27;s main football rivals are its neighbours Croatia. The matchup between the two sides is known as the Neighbourhood derby (, ). As of March 2022, they have faced each other twelve times (eleven official matches and one unofficial match). One of the most notable matches between Slovenia and Croatia took place in 2003, where the two teams met in the qualifying playoffs for UEFA Euro 2004. After a 1–1 draw in the first match in Zagreb, Slovenia then lost 1–0 at home and failed to qualify for its third consecutive major tournament. In March 2021, Slovenia finally managed to win a game against Croatia after failing to do so in the previous nine matches, as they won 1–0 at home during the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.

<text>Pseudowintera is a genus of woody evergreen flowering trees and shrubs, part of family Winteraceae. The species of &quot;Pseudowintera&quot; are native to New Zealand. Winteraceae are magnoliids, associated with the humid Antarctic flora of the southern hemisphere. Horopito can be chewed for a hot, peppery taste.

*&quot;Pseudowintera axillaris&quot;, is known as the lowland horopito. It is a shrub or small tree growing up to eight metres tall in lowland and lower montane forests from 35° to 42° South. In the South Island it grows West of the Main Divide.
*&quot;Pseudowintera colorata&quot;, or mountain horopito, is an evergreen shrub or small tree (1–2.5 m) commonly called pepperwood because its leaves have a very hot bite. Its yellow and green leaves are blotched with red; new leaves in the spring are bright red. It is widespread throughout New Zealand, from lowland forests to higher montane forests, and from 36° 30&#x27; South as far southwards as Stewart Island / Rakiura. Because of its various uses, both medicinal and culinary, the name horopito when used in common speech normally refers to the colorata species.
*&quot;Pseudowintera traversii&quot;, or Travers horopito, is a compact shrub up to one metre tall. It grows naturally only in the northwest corner of the South Island, from Collingwood to Westport.

==Cultivation==
Horopito spreads naturally through regrowth on cleared land but may often be found in domestic gardens as a decorative plant. Planting for commercial purposes has begun in recent years.

==Pharmaceutical use==
Horopito contains a substance called &quot;sesquiterpene dialdehyde polygodiali&quot;, otherwise known as &quot;polygodial&quot; that has a number of biological properties including antifungal, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antiallergic and insecticide effects. Polygodial has been tested as a very effective inhibitor of Candida albicans. Horopito was used traditionally by Maori for a variety of medicinal purposes including treatment of: fungal skin infection, stomach pain, diarrhoea and as an analgesic. Early European settlers to New Zealand also used horopito for medicinal purposes.

==Culinary use==
Horopito leaves are used in cooking in a variety of ways. Horopito is now being used as a seasoning in modern New Zealand cuisine. Typically the leaves are dried and then ground to form a powder. The powder may be used wherever black pepper is used and applied directly to meats, mixed with oils, used to make condiments (e.g. with mustard), in vinegars, biscuits and even ice-cream.

<doc id="1008162" wikidata="Q1197283" url="?curid=1008162" title="Linguolabial consonant">
<text>Linguolabials or apicolabials are consonants articulated by placing the tongue tip or blade against the upper lip, which is drawn downward to meet the tongue. They represent one extreme of a coronal articulatory continuum which extends from linguolabial to subapical palatal places of articulation. Cross-linguistically, linguolabial consonants are very rare. They are found in a cluster of languages in Vanuatu, in the Kajoko dialect of Bijago in Guinea-Bissau, in Umotína (a recently extinct Bororoan language of Brazil), and as paralinguistic sounds elsewhere. They are also relatively common in disordered speech, and the diacritic is specifically provided for in the extensions to the IPA.

Linguolabial consonants are transcribed in the International Phonetic Alphabet by adding the &quot;seagull&quot; diacritic, , to the corresponding alveolar consonant, or with the apical diacritic, , on the corresponding bilabial consonant.
== Description ==

Linguolabials are produced by constricting the airflow between the tongue and the upper lip. They are attested in a number of manners of articulation including stops, nasals, and fricatives, and can be produced with the tip of the tongue (apical), blade of the tongue (laminal), or the bottom of the tongue (sublaminal). Acoustically they are more similar to alveolars than bilabials. Linguolabials can be distinguished from bilabials and alveolars acoustically by formant transitions and nasal resonances.

==List of consonants==
==Linguolabials as a diachronic stage in sound shifts==
In Vanuatu, some of the Santo–Malekula languages have shifted historically from bilabial to alveolar consonants via an intermediate linguolabial stage, which remains in other Santo and Malekula languages. 

While labials have become linguolabial before nonrounded vowels in various languages (e.g. Tangoa, Araki, Nese), the sound shift went further in languages such as Tolomako, which shifted the linguolabials to full alveolar consonants: *b &gt; *[p] &gt; &quot;p̈&quot; &gt; &quot;t&quot; [t]; *m &gt; &quot;m̈&quot; &gt; &quot;n&quot; [n]. Thus, POc *bebe &gt; (spelled in Tangoa or in Araki) later became in Tolomako. Likewise, POc *tama &gt; (cf. Tangoa , Araki ) &gt; Tolomako .

<text>MS &quot;National Geographic Endeavour&quot; was a small expedition ship operated by Lindblad Expeditions for cruising in remote areas, particularly the polar regions.

== History ==
The ship was originally a fishing trawler built in 1966 as &quot;Marburg&quot;, and converted to carry passengers in 1983. First named &quot;North Star&quot;, then &quot;Caledonian Star&quot;; she received her present name in June 2001.

On March 2, 2001, the ship was struck by a 30-metre-high rogue wave while crossing the Drake Passage. The wave smashed the windows of the bridge and ruined the navigation and communications equipment, but did not cripple the ship. She was assisted by the Argentine Navy ocean fleet tug ARA &quot;Alferez Sobral&quot; and reached Ushuaia three days later.

When &quot;National Geographic Endeavour&quot; was retired, the piano was donated to the Tomas de Berlanga school in Santa Cruz, Galapagos. The bridge ceiling, notched with polar bear sightings from her time in Svalbard, is with Sven Lindblad. The model, valuable art and other mementos were saved. Some items were transferred to &quot;National Geographic Endeavour II&quot;.

&quot;National Geographic Endeavour&quot; was scrapped on 6 May 2017.

<doc id="1008170" wikidata="Q161426" url="?curid=1008170" title="Oryza sativa">
<text>Oryza sativa, having the common name Asian cultivated rice, is the much more common of the two rice species cultivated as a cereal, the other species being &quot;O. glaberrima&quot;, African rice. It was first domesticated in the Yangtze River basin in China 13,500 to 8,200 years ago.

&quot;Oryza sativa&quot; belongs to the genus &quot;Oryza&quot; and the BOP clade in the grass family Poaceae. With a genome consisting of 430Mbp across 12 chromosomes, it is renowned for being easy to genetically modify and is a model organism for the study of the biology of cereals and monocots.

== Description ==

&quot;O. sativa&quot; has an erect stalk stem that grows tall, with a smooth surface. The leaf is lanceolate, long, and grows from a ligule long.

== Classification ==

The generic name &quot;&quot; is a classical Latin word for rice, while the specific epithet &quot;sativa&quot; means &quot;cultivated&quot;.

&quot;Oryza sativa&quot; contains two major subspecies: the sticky, short-grained &quot;japonica&quot; or &quot;sinica&quot; variety, and the nonsticky, long-grained &quot;&quot; rice variety. &quot;Japonica&quot; was domesticated in the Yangtze Valley 9–6,000 years ago, and its varieties can be cultivated in dry fields (it is cultivated mainly submerged in Japan), in temperate East Asia, upland areas of Southeast Asia, and high elevations in South Asia, while &quot;indica&quot; was domesticated around the Ganges 8,500–4,500 years ago, and its varieties are mainly lowland rices, grown mostly submerged, throughout tropical Asia. Rice grain occurs in a variety of colors, including white, brown, black (purple when cooked), and red.

A third subspecies, which is broad-grained and thrives under tropical conditions, was identified based on morphology and initially called &quot;javanica&quot;, but is now known as &quot;tropical japonica&quot;. Examples of this variety include the medium-grain &#x27;Tinawon&#x27; and &#x27;Unoy&#x27; cultivars, which are grown in the high-elevation rice terraces of the Central Cordillera Mountains of northern Luzon, Philippines.

Glaszmann (1987) used isozymes to sort &quot;O. sativa&quot; into six groups: &quot;japonica&quot;, &quot;aromatic&quot;, &quot;indica&quot;, &quot;aus&quot;, &quot;rayada&quot;, and &quot;ashina&quot;.

Garris &quot;et al.&quot; (2004) used simple sequence repeats to sort &quot;O. sativa&quot; into five groups: &quot;temperate japonica&quot;, &quot;tropical japonica&quot; and &quot;aromatic&quot; comprise the &quot;japonica&quot; varieties, while &quot;indica&quot; and &quot;aus&quot; comprise the &quot;indica&quot; varieties. The Garris scheme has held up against newer analyses as of 2019, though one 2014 article argues that &quot;rayada&quot; is distinct enough to be its own group under &quot;japonica&quot;.

== Genetics ==

/ is a gene that regulates the overall architecture/growth habit of the plant. Some of its epialleles increase rice yield. An accurate and usable simple sequence repeat marker set was developed and used to generate a high-density map. A multiplex high-throughput marker assisted selection system has been developed but as with other crop HTMAS systems has proven difficult to customize, costly (both directly and for the equipment), and inflexible. Other molecular breeding tools have produced rice blast resistant cultivars. DNA microarray has been used to advance understanding of hybrid vigor in rice, QTL sequencing has been used to elucidate seedling vigor, and genome wide association study (GWAS) by whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been used to investigate various agronomic traits.

In total, 641 copy number variations are known. Exome capture often reveals new single nucleotide polymorphisms in rice, due to its large genome and high degree of DNA repetition.

Resistance to the rice blast fungus &quot;Magnaporthe grisea&quot; is provided by various resistance genes including &#x27;, &#x27;, and &quot;&quot;. &quot;O. sativa&quot; uses the plant hormones abscisic acid and salicylic acid to regulate immune responses. Salicylic acid broadly stimulates, and abscisic acid suppresses, immunity to &quot;M. grisea&quot;; success depends on the balance between their levels.

&quot;O. sativa&quot; has a large number of insect resistance genes specifically for the brown planthopper. , 15 R genes have been cloned and characterized.

<text>David McKie (born 1935) is a British journalist and historian.

He was deputy editor of &quot;The Guardian&quot; and continued to write a weekly column for that paper until 4 October 2007, called &quot;Elsewhere&quot;. Until 10 September 2005, he also wrote a second weekly column, under the pseudonym &quot;Smallweed&quot; (and occasionally under anagrams, such as &quot;Dame Wells&quot;, and &quot;Lee Laws MD&quot;). He continues to contribute to the paper on an occasional basis, including a piece about his premature death being falsely reported in this article, and a 2021 letter defending &quot;The Guardian&quot; and editor Peter Preston in 1983 returning documents which led to the imprisonment of whistleblower Sarah Tisdall.

His book &quot;Jabez: The Rise and Fall of a Victorian Scoundrel&quot;, a biography of the Victorian era politician and swindler Jabez Balfour, was shortlisted for the Saga Award for Wit, also known as the Silver Booker, as well as the Whitbread Book Award for biography. &quot;Great British Bus Journeys&quot; was shortlisted for a Dolman Best Travel Book Award in 2007.

<text> (, &quot;Direct (Elections) Now&quot;) was a 1984 civil movement in Brazil which demanded direct presidential elections.

==Participants==
The movement brought together diverse elements of Brazilian society. Participants came from a broad spectrum of political parties, trade unions, civil, student and journalistic leaderships. Politicians involved included Ulysses Guimarães, Tancredo Neves, André Franco Montoro, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Mário Covas, Teotônio Vilela, Dante de Oliveira, José Serra, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Eduardo Suplicy and Leonel Brizola. The movement also included artists such as Milton Nascimento, Fernanda Montenegro, Gilberto Gil, Bruna Lombardi, Fafá de Belém, and Chico Buarque de Holanda. Journalists such as Henfil, Osmar Santos and Eliel Ramos Maurício covered the assemblies for periodicals &quot;Diário de Sorocaba&quot; and &quot;Folha de Itapetininga&quot;. Football team Corinthians, already well known for activism with their Corinthians Democracy movement, printed &quot;&quot; on the back of their jerseys. Sectors of the Catholic Church, as well as other religions, also supported the movement.

==First public protest==
The first public protest for the &quot;Diretas&quot; occurred in the emancipated town of Abreu e Lima, in Pernambuco, on March 31, 1983. Periodicals of the state of Pernambuco organized members of the PMDB party in the city, followed by protests in the capital of the state of Goiás, Goiânia, on June 15, 1983, as well as the Charles Miller Plaza, in front of &quot;Pacaembu Stadium&quot;, on November 27, 1983, in São Paulo.

==Economic situation==
The growth of the movement coincided with a deepening economic crisis, with an annual inflation of 239% in 1983. This led to the mobilization of class entities and unions. The movement linked representatives from diverse political backgrounds under the common cause of direct elections for president. Many &quot;pro-status quo&quot; politicians, sensitive to their base, had also formed a block of disagreement within the National Renewal Alliance Party (ARENA), the pro-government party, when the Democratic Social Party (PDS) was founded.

The following year, the movement gained critical mass and was able to mobilize openly. On the anniversary of the city of São Paulo (January 25), the first major assembly of the campaign for direct elections for president took place on Praça da Sé, a major public square adjacent to the São Paulo Cathedral, was made possible by André Franco Montoro, governor of São Paulo.

By this time the Military Regime had lost much prestige with the majority of the population. Low ranking members of the military, whose wages had fallen in real terms due to inflation, began voicing their discontent to their superiors.

On April 16, shortly before the vote in Congress which would enable direct elections for president, a final demonstration took place in São Paulo in the Anhangabaú Valley, where an estimated crowd of over 1.5 million people attended, in the largest political demonstration ever seen in Brazil.

During April 1984, President Figueiredo increased press censorship and promoted arrests and police violence. Nonetheless, a vote on the amendment (known as Dante de Oliveira law, after its author) took place on April 25, 1984. Despite 298 votes in favor, with 65 against, 112 pro-government deputies abstained, leaving the Chamber without a quorum, as a result of which the bill died.

Despite the bill&#x27;s failure, the movement became a catalyst for various opposition forces and a voice for popular discontent. The re-democratization process ended with the return of civil power in 1985 and the approval of a new constitution in 1988, which called for the direct presidential elections in 1989, which were won by Fernando Collor de Mello, the first democratically elected president since 1961.

<text>Volver a Empezar (English title: &quot;Starting Again&quot;) is a Mexican telenovela produced by Emilio Larrosa for Televisa in 199495. It originally released on the Mexican television network Canal de las Estrellas.

Yuri and Chayanne starred as protagonists, while Rafael Sánchez Navarro and Claudia Silva starred as antagonists.

==Plot==
The telenovela revolves around the story of Mexican diva Renata or &quot;Reny&quot; and Puerto Rican singing legend Chayanne. Other significant characters include Lalo, Tony, Sandra, Poncho and Jessica. Reny is a 26-year-old whose father leaves her a fortune upon dying. Reny who is an aspiring singer, dreams of someday meeting Chayanne. Chayanne is (in real life and in the telenovela) an international singing star and teen idol.

Reny’s dream comes true when her boyfriend, Santiago, a music producer, arranges a meeting to happen after one of Chayanne&#x27;s concerts. As the drama unfolds, Reny becomes increasingly famous, and her bond with Chayanne evolves into romance.

However, Santiago becomes increasingly jealous and angry. Reny becomes afraid of Santiago and starts seeing him less often. Santiago&#x27;s lawyer, Tony, starts to develop an interest in Reny. While this plays out, Reny’s sister Sandra also becomes jealous of her success and the fact that their father left the family fortune to Reny.

Unknown to viewers for most of the telenovela is that Sandra suffers from a degenerative mental illness, which explains Reny’s father not leaving the fortune to Sandra. Sandra and Santiago create a diabolic plan where they will make Reny have an accident during one of her concerts. Their plan succeeds, leaving Reny paralyzed and with amnesia after her fall.

Eventually, she recovers and begins to walk again, and plans to return to the show business under the name of Chaquira. She uses this pseudonym to not tip off her enemies as to who she really is and that she&#x27;s still alive.

Through all of this, and before Reny’s accident, a fan of hers, Lalo, becomes her friend and falls in love with her. This causes tension with Jessica, who has just broken up with Poncho. Jessica becomes enemies with Reny and her attraction towards Lalo fuels Poncho&#x27;s anger and jealousy.

Chayanne had to leave Reny because of his professional compromises. During this time, Tony started to move in on her. He became her greatest ally and protector during the time she was in her wheelchair, and a great deal of love grows between them.

Tony ended up protecting Reny from Santiago, who himself ends up paralyzed and jailed. Jessica moved to Guadalajara, Jalisco after finding she was suffering a terrible disease, Lalo purposely gets himself killed in a motorcycle crash, and Chayanne decides that he and Reny should stay only as good friends due to their busy singing careers.

Sandra gets committed to a mental hospital. Reny starts using her real name again and makes a big comeback into the musical world where she goes on a tour. At the end, Tony marries her and they have a family together.

<text>Andrew Law (1749–1821) was an American composer, preacher and singing teacher. He was born in Milford, Connecticut. Law wrote mostly simple hymn tunes and arranged tunes of other composers. In 1781, he was granted the first authorial copyright in the United States, though there is some debate about which work the grant applied to. His works include &quot;Select Harmony&quot; (1778), a &quot;Collection of Best Tunes and Anthems&quot; (1779), and &quot;The Art of Singing&quot; &quot;in Three Parts&quot; (1792–96). He was among the first American composers to put the melody in the soprano instead of the tenor part, and was also one of the first Americans to write about music. Andrew Law was a pioneer of the FASOLA (Shape note) system of musical notation which simplified lessons in reading music during the Singing School era of New England music. FASOLA singing is also known as &quot;Shape Note Singing&quot;. He published &quot;Essays on Music&quot; in 1814. Andrew Law died in 1821.

<doc id="1008195" wikidata="Q377270" url="?curid=1008195" title="Dihydrocodeine">
<text>Dihydrocodeine is a semi-synthetic opioid analgesic prescribed for pain or severe dyspnea, or as an antitussive, either alone or compounded with paracetamol (acetaminophen) (as in co-dydramol) or aspirin. It was developed in Germany in 1908 and first marketed in 1911.

Commonly available as tablets, solutions, elixirs, and other oral forms, dihydrocodeine is also available in some countries as an injectable solution for deep subcutaneous and intra-muscular administration. As with codeine, intravenous administration should be avoided, as it could result in anaphylaxis and life-threatening pulmonary edema. In the past, dihydrocodeine suppositories were used. Dihydrocodeine is available in suppository form on prescription. Dihydrocodeine is used as an alternative to codeine and similarly belongs to step 2 of the WHO analgesic ladder.
It was first described in 1911 and approved for medical use in 1948. Dihydrocodeine was developed during the search for more effective cough medication, especially to help reduce the spread of tuberculosis, pertussis, and pneumonia in the years from c.a. 1895 to 1915. It is similar in chemical structure to codeine.

== Medical uses ==
Approved indication for dihydrocodeine is the management of moderate to moderately severe pain as well as coughing and shortness of breath. As is the case with other drugs in this group, the antitussive dose tends to be less than the analgesic dose, and dihydrocodeine is a powerful cough suppressant like all other members of the immediate codeine family (see below) and their cousins hydrocodone, oxycodone and ethylmorphine, whole opium preparations, and the strong opioid hydromorphone.

For use against pain, dihydrocodeine is usually formulated as tablets or capsules containing 15–16 mg or 30–32 mg with or without other active ingredients such as aspirin, paracetamol (acetaminophen), ibuprofen, or others.

Controlled release dihydrocodeine is available for both pain and coughing, as indicated below, as waxy tablets containing 60 to 120 mg of the drug. Some formulations, intended for use against coughing and the like, have other active ingredients such as antihistamines, decongestants and others. 

Other oral formulations, such as packets of effervescent powder, sublingual drops, elixirs and the like are also available in many locations.

Injectable dihydrocodeine is most often given as a deep subcutaneous injection. Dihydrocodeine appears to be superior to tramadol in treating pain.

== Side effects ==
As with other opioids, tolerance and physical and psychological dependence develop with repeated dihydrocodeine use. All opioids can impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery if taken in large doses.

Itching and flushing and other effects of blood vessel dilation are also common side-effects, due to histamine release in response to the drug using one or more types of receptors in the CNS or other responses elsewhere in the body. First-generation antihistamines such as tripelennamine (Pyrabenzamine), clemastine (Tavist), hydroxyzine (Atarax), diphenhydramine (Benadryl), cyproheptadine (Periactin), brompheniramine (Dimetapp), chlorphenamine (Chlor-Trimeton), doxylamine (NyQuil) and phenyltoloxamine (Percogesic Original Formula) not only combat the histamine-driven side-effects, but are analgesic-sparing (potentiating) in various degrees. The antihistamine promethazine (Phenergan) may also have a positive effect on hepatic metabolism of dihydrocodeine as it does with codeine. Higher doses of promethazine may interfere with most other opioids with the exception of the pethidine family (Demerol and the like) by this or other unknown mechanisms.

As with all drugs, side-effects depend on the person taking the medication. They can range in severity from mild to extreme, from headaches to difficulty breathing.

Constipation is the one side-effect of dihydrocodeine and almost all opioids which is near-universal. It results from the slowing of peristalsis in the gut and is a reason dihydrocodeine, ethylmorphine, codeine, opium preparations, and morphine are used to stop diarrhoea and combat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in its diarrhoeal and cyclical forms as well as other conditions causing hypermotility or intestinal cramping. Opium/opioid preparations are used often as a last resort where pain is severe and the bowels are organically loose. It is generally better to treat IBS with a non psycho-tropic opioid such as loperamide hydrochloride which stays contained in the bowel, thereby not causing drowsy effects and allowing many people to work using machines etc. For IBS, hyoscine butylbromide (Buscopan in the UK) and mebeverine hydrochloride (Colofac) can be effective with or without an opium related compound.

== Pharmacology ==
Dihydrocodeine exerts its analgesic action through affinity to predominantly μ-opioid receptor and to lesser extent to κ-opioid receptor and δ-opioid receptor. 30 mg of subcutaneous dihydrocodeine is equianalgesic to 10 mg of morphine. Another source states that dihydrocodeine is twice as strong as codeine and the metabolite dihydromorphine is likewise twice as strong as morphine. 

Dihydrocodeine (DHC) is &quot;O&quot;-demethylated into dihydromorphine (DHM) by CYP2D6 and &quot;N&quot;-demethylated into nordihydrocodeine (NDHC) by CYP3A4, summarily yielding nordihydromorphine (NDHM). Dihydrocodeine and its metabolites form 3- and 6-glucuronides. Due to the multidirectional metabolism, as opposed to tramadol and codeine, CYP2D6 activity probably does not influence DHC analgesia. The analgesia is likely achieved by the action of DHC itself, as well as DHC-6-G. DHC appears not to differ between poor and extensive metabolizers in terms of its pain threshold and pupillary reaction effect in spite of major variation in DHM blood levels. 

DHC-6-G is half as potent as DHC. DHM and DHM-6-G display the highest affinity to μ-opioid receptors, being 70 times as potent as DHC, whereas other metabolites display lesser affinity. DHM-6-G has similar potency as DHM, while DHM-3-G is considerably weaker. Action on δ-opioid receptor is 5-50 weaker compared to μ with the exception of DHC-6-G being twice as strong as DHC. 6-glucuronides possess lesser affinity towards κ-opioid receptors, albeit the affinity of DHC is comparable to codeine, DHM and morphine. 

The primary compounds responsible for analgesia are DHC and DHC-6-G. Although some of the metabolites are far more potent, the concentration of NDHM and NDHM-6-G in urine were minimal, suggesting no significant role in pain relief. 

After oral absorption, the drug is absorbed relatively rapidly with mean peak concentration at 1.7 hours. The mean half-life is 4 hours. The mean bioavailability of orally administered drug is 21%. Metabolite concentrations are high in relation to the parent drug, suggesting extensive first-pass metabolism. Dihydrocodeine tablets may possess an extended-release mechanism, lowering peak concentrations and increasing duration of action. 

== Regulation ==
; Australia :In Australia, dihydrocodeine is a &#x27;pharmacist only&#x27; Schedule 3 drug, only when indicated for cough suppression, and compounded with one or more other therapeutically active substances not exceeding 15 mg dihydrocodeine per dose. Schedule 3 drugs, while still OTC, can only be dispensed after consultation with a pharmacist. It is a Schedule 4 (prescription only) drug when compounded with one or more other therapeutically active substances and not exceeding 100 mg dihydrocodeine per dose. Any Dihydrocodeine preparation not falling within Schedules 3 or 4, including single ingredient dihydrocodeine preparations, are categorised as Schedule 8 (controlled drugs), which can only be dispensed in accordance with the stricter requirements of the state or territory in which they are prescribed (and which vary between states and territories).

; Hong Kong : In Hong Kong, dihydrocodeine is regulated under Schedule 1 of Hong Kong&#x27;s Chapter 134 &quot;Dangerous Drugs Ordinance&quot;. It can only be used legally by health professionals and for university research purposes. A pharmacist can dispense Dihydrocodeine when furnished with a doctors prescription. Anyone who supplies the substance without a prescription can be fined $10000 (HKD). The penalty for trafficking or manufacturing the substance is a $5,000,000 (HKD) fine and life imprisonment. Possession of the substance for consumption, without a licence from the Department of Health, is illegal and carries a $1,000,000 (HKD) fine or 7 years imprisonment.

; Japan : In Japan, dihydrocodeine is available without a prescription; used in cough medicines such as New Bron Solution-ACE. Dihydrocodeine is used as an antitussive in many products as a Dextromethorphan alternative. Medicines in Japan which contain dihydrocodeine are coupled with caffeine to offset the sedative effects and discourage recreational use. Cough medicines containing dihydrocodeine are controlled similarly to dextromethorphan in the United States, in that its sale is strictly limited by purchase quantity and is restricted to persons 20 and older for purchase.

; United Kingdom : In the United Kingdom, dihydrocodeine is a Class B drug; but, it is available over-the-counter in small amounts (less than 8 mg), when combined with paracetamol (see co-dydramol). Dihydrocodeine is listed in Schedule 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 whereby it is exempt from prohibition on possession provided that it is in the form of a single preparation not being designed for injection and less than 100 mg (calculated as free base) or with a total concentration less than 2.5% (calculated as free base). Illegal possession of dihydrocodeine can result in up to 5 years in prison or an unlimited fine.

; United States : In the US, pure dihydrocodeine is a DEA Schedule II substance, although preparations containing small amounts of dihydrocodeine can also be classified as Schedule III or Schedule V, depending on the concentration of dihydrocodeine relative to other active constituents, such as paracetamol (acetaminophen). The DEA&#x27;s ACSCN for dihydrocodeine free base and all salts is 9120. The 2013 annual aggregate manufacturing quota is 250 kilos.

International treaties and the controlled-substances laws of most countries, such as the German &quot;Betäubungsmittelgesetz&quot;, regulate dihydrocodeine at the same level as codeine. Dihydrocodeine-based pharmaceuticals are especially used where chronic pain patients are able to have essentially OTC access to them provided they are registered with the provincial or national government as such a patient.

Controlled-release dihydrocodeine is a non-prescription item in some places, especially the 60 mg strength. A report by the Ivo Šandor Organisation in 2004 listed Andorra, Spain, Gibraltar and Austria as having varying degrees of access to these and other dihydrocodeine, nicocodeine and codeine products.

== Chemistry ==

It is available as the following salts, in approximate descending order of frequency of use: bitartrate, phosphate, hydrochloride, tartrate, hydroiodide, methyliodide, hydrobromide, sulfate, and thiocyanate. The salt to free base conversion factors are 0.67 for the bitartrate, 0.73 for the phosphate, and 0.89 for the hydrochloride.

Dihydrocodeine is the parent drug of a series of moderately strong narcotics including, among others, hydrocodone, nicocodeine, nicodicodeine, thebaine and acetyldihydrocodeine. It is an original member and chemical base of a number of similar semi-synthetic opioids such as acetyldihydrocodeine, dihydrocodeinone enol acetate, dihydroisocodeine, nicocodeine, and nicodicodeine.

Whereas converting codeine to morphine is a difficult and unrewarding task, dihydrocodeine can be converted to dihydromorphine with very high yields (over 95%). Dihydromorphine is widely used in Japan. The dihydromorphine can be quantitatively converted to hydromorphone using potassium tert butoxide.

Dihydrocodeine can be presumptively detected by the Froehde reagent.

== Recreational use ==
As dihydrocodeine can provide a euphoric high when taken in higher-than-therapeutic doses, it is quite commonly used recreationally. The typical recreational dose can be anything from 70 mg to 500 mg, or, in users with tolerance, even more. Potentiators and adjuvants are often included when dihydrocodeine is used in an unsupervised fashion, especially carisoprodol, glutethimide, hydroxyzine and first-generation antihistamines, both to intensify the effect and lessen side-effects such as itching.

==History==
Two famous users of dihydrocodeine were William S. Burroughs, who described it as &quot;twice as strong as codeine and almost as good as heroin&quot; and Hermann Göring, who was a known morphine addict (Hitler referred to him as the &quot;morphinist&quot;), consumed up to 100 tablets (3 grams) of dihydrocodeine per day and was captured by the Allies with a large quantity of the drug in a suitcase, reportedly more than 20,000 tablets. Another account suggest Hermann Göring was taking 20 tablets in the morning and 20 at night to ward off morphine withdrawals. Germany was experiencing a massive shortage of morphine, and as a result Göring used massive amounts of dihydrocodeine. He also used morphine and oxycodone, beginning with therapeutic use of morphine after being wounded in the groin during the November 1923 Beer Hall Putsch in Munich and then used dihydrocodeine in the early 1930s for toothache.

==Society and culture==

===Brand names===
Brand names for dihydrocodeine products include Drocode, Paracodeine, Parzone, Rikodeine, Trezix, Synalgos DC, Panlor DC, Panlor SS, Contugesic, New Bron Solution-ACE, Huscode, Drocode, Paracodin, Paramol (UK), Codidol, Dehace, DHC Continus, Didor Continus, Dicogesic, Codhydrine, Dekacodin, DH-Codeine, Didrate, Dihydrin, Hydrocodin, Nadeine, Novicodin, Rapacodin, Fortuss, Remedeine, Dico, Synalgos-DC (US), and DF-118.

=== Preparations and availability ===
Dihydrocodeine products which can be purchased over the counter in many European and Pacific Rim countries generally contain from 2 to 20 mg of dihydrocodeine per dosing unit combined with one or more other active ingredients such as paracetamol (acetaminophen), aspirin, ibuprofen, antihistamines, decongestants, vitamins, medicinal herb preparations, and other such ingredients. In a subset of these countries and foreign possessions, 30 mg tablets and 60 mg controlled-release tablets are available over the counter and chemists may very well be able to dispense the 90 and 120 mg strengths at their discretion.

In the United States, the most common analgesic brands with dihydrocodeine are: DHC Plus (16 and 32 mg), Panlor SS (32 mg), ZerLor (32 mg), Panlor DC (16 mg) and Synalgos DC (16 mg). These combination products also include paracetamol (acetaminophen) and caffeine. Aspirin is used in the case of Synalgos DC.

Dihydrocodeine is sometimes marketed in combination preparations with paracetamol as co-dydramol (BAN) to provide greater pain relief than either agent used singly (see Synergy § Drug synergy).

In the UK and other countries, 30 mg tablets containing only dihydrocodeine as the active ingredient are available, also a 40 mg Dihydrocodeine tablet is available in the UK as DF-118 Forte.

The original dihydrocodeine product, Paracodin, is an elixir of dihydrocodeine hydroiodide also available as a Tussionex-style suspension in many European countries.

In many European countries and elsewhere in the world, the most commonly found dihydrocodeine preparations are extended-release tablets made by encasing granules of the ingredient mixture, almost always using the bitartrate salt of dihydrocodeine, of four different sizes in a wax-based binder. The usual strengths are 60, 90, and 120 mg. Common trade names for the extended-release tablets are Didor Continus, Codidol, Codi-Contin, Dicodin (made in France and the major product containing the tartrate salt), Contugesic, DHC, and DHC Continus.

Dihydrocodeine is available in Japan as tablets which contain 2.5 mg of dihydrocodeine phosphate and caffeine, the decongestant d,l-methylephedrine HCl, and the antihistamine chlorpheniramine, and packets of granules which effervesce like Alka-Seltzer with 10 mg of dihydrocodeine with lysozyme and chlorpheniramine, marketed for OTC sale as New Bron Solution-ACE. These two formulations may have once contained phenyltoloxamine citrate as the antihistamine component.
Elsewhere in the Pacific Rim, Dicogesic in analogous to Glaxo/Smith-Kline&#x27;s DF-118.

The manufacturer of New Bron Solution-ACE; SS Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, also markets an ibuprofen with dihydrocodeine product called S.Tac EVE, which also includes d,l-methylephedrine HCl, chlorpheniramine, anhydrous caffeine, and vitamins B1 and C. 
The Panlor series is manufactured by Pan-American Laboratories of Covington, Louisiana, and they also market several dihydrocodeine-based prescription cough syrups in the United States.

<text>Elizabeth Barton (1506 – 20 April 1534), known as &quot;The Nun of Kent&quot;, &quot;The Holy Maid of London&quot;, &quot;The Holy Maid of Kent&quot; and later &quot;The Mad Maid of Kent&quot;, was an English Catholic nun. She was executed as a result of her prophecies against the marriage of King Henry VIII of England to Anne Boleyn.

==Early life==
Little is known about Barton&#x27;s early life. She was born in 1506 in the parish of Aldington, about 12 miles from Canterbury, and appears to have come from a poor background. She was working as a servant in 1525 when she said her visions began. This followed her suffering for some months from &quot;an impostume in her stomach, which divers times redounded upwards to her throat and was like to stop her breath&quot;, during which time she could not eat or drink, as well as seizures and periods of paralysis.

==Visions==
On Easter of 1525, at the age of 19, while working as a domestic servant in the household of Thomas Cobb, a farmer of Aldington, who worked for Archbishop William Warham, Barton claimed to have had very vivid visions and to have received divine revelations that predicted events. This included the death of a child living in her household or, more frequently, pleas for people to remain in the Catholic Church. Her revelations followed a similar pattern of Catholic orthodoxy seen in previous &#x27;holy maids&#x27; in the later medieval period. She urged people to pray to the Virgin Mary and to undertake pilgrimages. Thousands believed in her prophecies and both Archbishop William Warham and Bishop John Fisher attested to her pious life.

When some events that Barton foretold apparently occurred, her reputation spread. Barton&#x27;s revelations became publicly known and matters were brought up by Archbishop William Warham. The parish priest, Richard Masters, duly referred the matter to Warham, who appointed a commission to ensure that none of her prophecies was at variance with Catholic teaching. This commission was led by the Benedictine monk, Edward Bocking, Barton&#x27;s spiritual advisor. When the commission decided favourably, Warham arranged for Barton to be received in the Benedictine St Sepulchre&#x27;s Priory, Canterbury, under Bocking’s spiritual direction.

Barton&#x27;s life became very public. Nothing unorthodox was found in her case; her alleged public healing from the Virgin Mary at Court-at-Street (a hamlet near Lympne, Kent) increased attention and brought fame to her and to the Marian Shrine. 

In 1527, Robert Redman published &quot;A marueilous woorke of late done at Court of Streete in Kent&quot; which discussed all of Barton&#x27;s &quot;miracles, revelations, and prophecies&quot; and the controversies leading up to the arrests and executions.

In 1528, Barton held a private meeting with Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, the second most powerful man in England after Henry VIII, and she soon thereafter met twice with Henry himself. Henry accepted Barton because her prophecies then still supported the existing order. She also consulted with Richard Reynolds, a Bridgettine monk of Syon Abbey. He arranged a meeting between Barton and Thomas More, who was impressed by her fervour. Her prophecies warned against heresy and condemned rebellion at a time when Henry was attempting to stamp out Lutheranism and was afraid of possible uprising or even assassination by his enemies.

By 1534, Barton&#x27;s prophecies were less in tune with the interests of Henry VIII, becoming more about political affairs of both state and religion. When the King began the process of obtaining an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon and seizing control of the Church in England from Rome, Barton opposed him. Barton strongly opposed the English Reformation and, in around 1532, began prophesying that if Henry remarried, he would die within a few months. She said that she had even seen the place in Hell to which he would go. Thomas More thought many prophesies were fictitiously attributed to her, and King Henry actually lived for a further 15 years. Remarkably, probably because of her popularity, Barton went unpunished for nearly a year. More, Reynolds &amp; Fisher all warned her against ‘political’ statements and distanced themselves from her. The King&#x27;s agents spread false rumours about mental illness and sexual relationships with priests.

==Arrest and execution==
With her reputation undermined, Barton was arrested by the Crown in 1533 and forced to confess that she had fabricated her revelations. What is known regarding her confession comes from Thomas Cromwell, his agents and other sources affiliated with the Crown.

Friar John Laurence of the Observant Friars of Greenwich gave evidence against Barton and against fellow Observants, Friars Hugh Rich and Richard Risby. Laurence then requested to be named to one of the posts left vacant by their imprisonment. She was condemned by a bill of attainder (25 Hen. 8. c. 12); an act of Parliament authorizing punishment without trial.

Barton was attainted for treason by act of Parliament, on the basis that she had maliciously opposed Henry VIII&#x27;s divorce from Catherine of Aragon, and had prophesied that the king would lose his kingdom. Although Barton claimed God had revealed to her that he no longer recognized Henry VIII&#x27;s monarchy, the act of attainder argued that Barton was at the centre of a conspiracy against the King. Barton was viewed as a false prophet who was encouraged to profess fake revelations to persuade others to go against the monarchy.

On 20 April 1534 Elizabeth Barton was hanged at Tyburn for treason. She was 28 years old. Five of her chief supporters were executed alongside her:

*Edward Bocking, Benedictine monk of Christ Church, Canterbury
*John Dering, Benedictine monk
*Henry Gold, priest
*Hugh Rich, Franciscan friar
*Richard Risby, Franciscan friar

Barton was buried at Greyfriars Church in Newgate, but her head was put on a spike on London Bridge. She is the only woman in history to receive that dishonour.

==Legacy==
Churches such as the Anglican Catholic Church of St Augustine of Canterbury continue to venerate Barton.

==Popular culture==
Barton&#x27;s case is dealt with in the 2009 historical novel &quot;Wolf Hall&quot; by Hilary Mantel, and in its television adaptation, where she is played by Aimee-Ffion Edwards. Barton and her prophecies are also mentioned in Philippa Gregory’s 2014 novel &quot;The King&#x27;s Curse&quot;; the sixth and final book in The Cousins&#x27; War series.

Barton is personally interrogated by Thomas Cromwell, Thomas Cranmer and Nicòla Frescobaldi in &quot;Shaking the Throne&quot; by author Caroline Angus.

In the play &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; by Robert Bolt, Barton is referenced during the interrogation of Thomas More as having been executed (she was executed about 15 months before More).

<doc id="1008202" wikidata="Q420410" url="?curid=1008202" title="Rhodamine">
<text>Rhodamine is a family of related dyes, a subset of the triarylmethane dyes. They are derivatives of xanthene. Important members of the rhodamine family are rhodamine 6G, Rhodamin WT, Texas Red (Sulforhodamin 101), rhodamine 123, and rhodamine B. They are mainly used to dye paper and inks, but they lack the lightfastness for fabric dyeing.

==Use==
Aside from their major applications, they are often used as a tracer dye, e.g. to determine the rate and direction of flow and transport of water. Rhodamine dyes fluoresce and can thus be detected using Fluorometers. Rhodamine dyes are used extensively in biotechnology applications such as fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and ELISA. Rhodamine 123 is used in biochemistry to inhibit mitochondrion function. Rhodamine 123 appears to bind to the mitochondrial membranes and inhibit transport processes, especially the electron transport chain, thus slowing down cellular respiration. It is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), which is usually overexpressed in cancer cells. Recent reports indicate that rhodamine 123 may also be a substrate of multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP), or more specifically, MRP1.

In addition to their major applications, rhodamines are used in dye laser as gain media.

==Other derivatives==
There are many rhodamine derivatives used for imaging purposes, for example Carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA), tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) and its isothiocyanate derivative (TRITC) and sulforhodamine 101 (and its sulfonyl chloride form Texas Red) and Rhodamine Red. TRITC is the base rhodamine molecule functionalized with an isothiocyanate group (−N=C=S), replacing a hydrogen atom on the bottom ring of the structure. This derivative is reactive towards amine groups on proteins inside cells. A succinimidyl-ester functional group attached to the rhodamine core, creating NHS-rhodamine, forms another common amine-reactive derivative. 

Other derivatives of rhodamine include newer fluorophores such as Alexa 546, Alexa 633, DyLight 550 and DyLight 633, HiLyte fluor 555 HiLyte 594, Janelia Dyes JF549 and JF669 have been tailored for various chemical and biological applications where higher photostability, increased brightness, different spectral characteristics, or different attachment groups are needed.

Substituents of the xanthene core are influencing the properties of the xanthene dyes by both electronic and steric effects. Specifically designed substituents also allows xanthenes to bear specific functions activatable upon excitation by visible light, e.g. they could act as photoremovable protecting group for carboxylates and halides, carbon monoxide (thus being a photoCORM), or added as a secondary functionality of fluorescent dyes, e.g. fluorescent pH indicators.

<text>Tintin and I (French: Tintin et moi, also known as Tintin and Me) is a 2003 documentary by Anders Høgsbro Østergaard, about Belgian writer-artist Georges Remi, better known as Hergé, and his creation Tintin. The film is a co-production of Denmark, Belgium, France, and Switzerland.

The film is based on Numa Sadoul&#x27;s revealing interviews with Hergé from the 1970s, and goes into detail about Hergé&#x27;s life and how the success of Tintin affected it. The film is based strongly around Hergé&#x27;s experiences and state of mental health leading up to the writing of &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot;, often heralded as Hergé&#x27;s most personal album. The history of Tintin is examined through Hergé&#x27;s life and the way that he was affected by the growing popularity of his character.

== Theme ==
The underlying theme of the film is the way that Hergé&#x27;s private life affected his work; for example, Bianca Castafiore is a subconscious (or perhaps conscious) reflection of Georges&#x27; first wife, Germaine, and the way that Captain Haddock responds to her reflects the way Georges often felt towards his wife. Specifically, the mothering instinct that Germaine had toward him is shown most explicitly in &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot;. The subject of religion is also discussed, including Georges&#x27; gradual disillusioned view of the Catholic church, and the opposition he came up against due to Wolff&#x27;s sacrifice in &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot;. The influence of Chang on Georges&#x27; work is also highlighted, using reconstructed footage and actual archive footage of their meeting in 1934.

== Format ==
Technically, the film employed a choice of graphic effects to &quot;re-animate&quot; video footage of Hergé speaking, to match up with the audio being played (from the interviews conducted with Sadoul). Panels from the albums were also animated to allow movement through them, the plane crash from &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot; and the Shanghai street scene from &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; both being used in such a manner. Interviews are reconstructed using actors, but the viewer never sees their faces; hands and arms are used, holding the albums, flicking through them, drinking tea and the like.

== Broadcast ==
The film has been broadcast in the UK on BBC Four and in the US on PBS.

==DVD releases==
In Australia, Madman Entertainment released a DVD version of &quot;Tintin and I&quot; in 2007, packaged with &quot;I, Tintin&quot;, an interview with Gérard Valet, a short film called &quot;The Secret of the Clear Line&quot; and a menu-based Hergé biography.

<text>Heinrich Adam (1787 – 15 February 1862) was a German painter.

==Life==
Heinrich Adam, a brother of Albrecht Adam, was born in Nördlingen in 1787. He studied painting in Augsburg and Munich, and distinguished himself as a painter of landscapes and as an engraver. In 1811 he stayed with Albrecht at Lake Como, and painted in watercolours. He also engraved six hunting-pieces, after his brother Albrecht, at Milan, in 1813.

Subsequently, he painted landscapes and views of towns, which are executed with great accuracy. His &quot;Das neue München mit den Bauten König Ludwigs I.&quot; (1839), a view in oils of the Max-Josephs-Platz, surrounded by 14 smaller pictures of new buildings in Munich, mounted together in one frame, is in the collection of the Munich Stadtmuseum. A set of watercolours in a similar format is in the Metropolitan Museum in New York.

He died in Munich in 1862.

<doc id="1008223" wikidata="Q7126166" url="?curid=1008223" title="Palace Gates line">
<text>The Palace Gates line was a short railway branch line in north London running from the main line at Seven Sisters station in Tottenham to Palace Gates (Wood Green) station in Wood Green.

==Opening==
The line was constructed by the Great Eastern Railway (GER) and opened on 1 January 1878 with a temporary terminus at Noel Park and Wood Green station before being opened to Palace Gates (Wood Green) station on 7 October 1878. The line was opened in competition with the Great Northern Railway (GNR) line from King&#x27;s Cross station to provide passenger services from the GER&#x27;s London terminus at Liverpool Street station to the recently opened Alexandra Palace and the developing suburb of Wood Green.

==Extension to Bowes Park==
After the Railways Act 1921 amalgamated the GER, GNR and other railway companies into the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1923, a connection to Bowes Park on the GNR Hertford Loop Line, which runs just north of the site of the terminus station, was made in 1929.

==Decline==
With the nearby GNR built stations at Alexandra Palace and Hornsey providing a more direct route to central London, the catchment areas for the line&#x27;s stations were always fairly small and the opening in 1932 of the first section of the Piccadilly line extension to Cockfosters with stations at Wood Green and Turnpike Lane diminished them further, crucially eroding the line&#x27;s passenger traffic.

In the early 1950s, the line was one of only two branches in the London area still worked by elderly F5, mainly, and F6 2-4-2Ts. The remaining examples of these were called into Stratford Works for withdrawal, in mid-1958. There then being no other suitable locomotives for the Palace Gates line, many of its trains were worked by J68 and J69 0-6-0Ts until sufficient N7 0-6-2Ts became available, following the electrification of suburban services from Liverpool Street station to Chingford and Hertford, in November, 1960. N7 and L1 steam locomotives continued to be used, until September, 1962.

In later years, services ran to North Woolwich rather than Liverpool Street, mainly to the benefit of workers in the docks living in the areas served by the line.

==Closure==
The Palace Gates line was closed to passengers on 7 January 1963. Goods services continued to run until 5 October 1964.

==Remains==
Tracks were removed and the stations demolished and the route of the line has been almost entirely covered by new construction including The Mall Wood Green (Shopping City). The only part of the line that remains is a short section of track within Bounds Green Depot where the line formerly connected to the Hertford Loop Line. A small section of the route can be seen from Avenue Road.

The latest (2015) proposed route for Crossrail 2, sees an option that would closely resemble the Palace Gates Line, running from Seven Sisters/South Tottenham railway station (double-ended station) through either Turnpike Lane and Alexandra Palace stations, or Wood Green Underground station, on its way to New Southgate railway station.

<doc id="1008238" wikidata="Q1133538" url="?curid=1008238" title="Scott Stadium">
<text>Scott Stadium, in full The Carl Smith Center, home of David A. Harrison III Field at Scott Stadium, is a stadium located in Charlottesville, Virginia. It is the home of the Virginia Cavaliers football team. It sits on the University of Virginia&#x27;s Grounds, east of Hereford College and first-year dorms on Alderman Road but west of Brown College and the Lawn. Constructed in 1931, it is the oldest active FBS football stadium in Virginia.

It also hosts other events, such as concerts for bands that can fill an entire stadium, such as the Dave Matthews Band in 2001, the Rolling Stones in 2005, and U2 in 2009. The Virginia High School League held its Group AAA Division 5 and 6 football state championship games at the stadium until 2015. The facility has also hosted the Division I NCAA Men&#x27;s Lacrosse Championship in 1977 and 1982 and the ACC Women&#x27;s Lacrosse Tournament in 2008.

== History ==
Built as a replacement for the old Lambeth Field or &quot;Colonnades,&quot; Scott Stadium bears the name of donor and University Rector Frederic Scott, and held 25,000 spectators at opening. The stadium had a view of the Blue Ridge Mountains and specifically Monticello Mountain out the south end of the stadium. An artificial turf system was installed in 1974, making the long tradition of a mounted Cavalier riding into the stadium with the football team impossible. David A. Harrison III provided a gift allowing natural grass to be reinstalled in the stadium, and the Cavalier has ridden into Scott Stadium every game since 1995 accompanied by orange and blue fireworks.

==Top attendance records==

==Stadium expansion projects==

===1981===
The first expansion to the stadium&#x27;s capacity came in 1981, when upper decks and grass hill seating allowed 40,000 fans.

===2000===
Carl Smith&#x27;s donations helped make the most recent contributions to Scott Stadium in 2000, filling in the upper deck and south end to allow 20,000 additional fans, and installing the pergola, state-of-the-art lighting and large audio/visual tower known as &quot;Hoo-Vision,&quot; as well as a new lighting system placed on towers with &quot;V&#x27;s&quot; built in. The facility&#x27;s official name is a result of this string of donations.

===2009===
Scott Stadium received a new scoreboard and a larger video screen, Hoo Vision.

==Traditions==

Traditionally, men wear coats and ties and women wear sundresses to games, which is also tradition at Clemson, Alabama, Auburn, Georgia, and Ole Miss. Beginning during the 2003 season, however, head coach Al Groh called upon fans to set aside traditional attire for orange clothing. 

The T-shirt movement has been welcomed by many, but ties and sundresses can still be easily spotted at Scott Stadium among students and alumni. Some have compromised by wearing ties with orange dress shirts or orange sundresses. &quot;The Cavalier Daily&quot;, the University&#x27;s daily student-published newspaper, weighed in on the debate in its September 1, 2005, lead editorial. &quot;The Declaration&quot;, an alternative weekly news magazine at the University, also ran a feature story on the debate prior to the 2006 home opener.

==Notable games==

===September 8, 1990: #14 Virginia 20, #9 Clemson 7===
UVa entered this game with an 0–29 record against Clemson. The win was Virginia&#x27;s first-ever victory over an opponent ranked in the top ten. Both goalposts came down when the fans stormed the field; the first actually fell with 48 seconds still on the clock. The win proved to be something of a watershed in UVA football history in that it set the stage for the 1990 squad to begin the season 7–0, rising to #1 in the polls for the first time. In addition, in contrast to Virginia&#x27;s historical futility against Clemson prior to the 1990 game, as of 2013 UVA has beaten Clemson eight times (and tied once) since that 1990 win, although since 2004 the schools no longer play every year due to the Atlantic Coast Conference&#x27;s expansion.

===November 3, 1990: #16 Georgia Tech 41, #1 Virginia 38===
The Yellow Jackets ended Virginia&#x27;s three-week reign at #1 in the polls as they overcame a two-touchdown halftime deficit to win on Scott Sisson&#x27;s 37-yard field goal with 0:07 left. Undefeated Georgia Tech would go on to win the rest of its games to take a share of the National Championship.

===November 2, 1995: #24 Virginia 33, #2 Florida State 28===
This nationally-televised contest was the first Thursday night game played at Scott Stadium and marked Florida State&#x27;s first loss in an ACC game (after winning its first 29). In arguably the greatest victory in Virginia football history, FSU running back Warrick Dunn was stopped inches from the south end zone goal line after taking a direct snap on the game&#x27;s final play. Fans stormed the field and brought down both goalposts, a feat not since repeated at Scott Stadium.

===November 16, 1996: Virginia 20, #6 North Carolina 17===
With Mack Brown&#x27;s squad poised to clinch a spot in the Bowl Alliance, UVA trailed North Carolina 17–3 in the fourth quarter and the Tar Heels were driving for the knockout blow when Antwan Harris picked off a third-down pass and returned it 95 yards for a touchdown. Following quarterback Tim Sherman&#x27;s touchdown scramble on the Hoos&#x27; next drive, kicker Rafael Garcia hit the game-winning 32-yard field goal with 0:39 left. In this installment of the South&#x27;s Oldest Rivalry, Virginia extended North Carolina&#x27;s winless drought in Scott Stadium to 15 years with the 20–17 upset.

===October 15, 2005: Virginia 26, #4 Florida State 21===
Ten seasons after the 33–28 milestone, Virginia&#x27;s 1995 ACC Co-Championship squad was honored in a halftime ceremony. UVA went on to win in a 26–21 upset for its first victory over FSU since the 1995 game. Quarterback Marques Hagans threw for 306 yards and two touchdowns, and Connor Hughes kicked four field goals in the victory.

Following the game a large part of the crowd stormed the field, with some fans climbing the goalposts. The celebration was marred, however, by the fact that 12 people were injured in the stampede accompanying the rush to the field.

===November 29, 2019: Virginia 39, #24 Virginia Tech 30===
The Cavaliers entered the Commonwealth Cup looking to snap a 15-year losing streak versus the Hokies, led by star quarterback Bryce Perkins. In front of a crowd of 52,619, UVA went on to win in a 39–30 upset for its first victory against the Hokies since 2003. Kicker Brian Delaney made both of his attempted field goals, notching a 48-yard field goal in the fourth quarter. Perkins passed for 311 yards and rushed for 164 in the historic victory. By defeating Virginia Tech, the Cavaliers won the ACC Coastal Division and secured a spot in the ACC Championship against the Clemson Tigers.

<text>Benno Rafael Adam (15 July 1812, Munich - 8 March 1892, Kelheim) was a German animal painter.

==Life==
He was the eldest son of the painter Albrecht Adam, and distinguished himself especially by his depictions of game animals, hunting dogs and pets in larger compositions (deer and boar hunting, fox baiting, etc.) He was associated with the Chiemsee artists&#x27; colony.

In addition to his paintings, he illustrated several textbooks and manuals, including &quot;Anleitung zur Rindviehzucht und zur verschiedenartigen Benutzung des Hornviehs&quot; (Guide to Beef Cattle Breeding and the Diverse Use of Horned Cattle) by Heinrich Wilhelm von Pabst, J. G. Cotta, Stuttgart (1851).

In the summer of 1834, he married Josepha Quaglio, the eldest daughter of the painter and architect Domenico Quaglio. Their son Emil Adam also became a painter. Benno Adam&#x27;s brothers were the painters Franz and Eugen Adam.

<doc id="1008245" wikidata="Q3233096" url="?curid=1008245" title="Les Grosses Têtes">
<text>Les Grosses Têtes (;&quot;The Big Heads&quot; or &quot;The Big Brains&quot; in English) is a daily comedy radio programme on the French language RTL radio network. Broadcast since 1 April 1977, the current host since 2014 has been Laurent Ruquier.

Presently broadcast from 15:30 to 18:00 in France and Belgium (on Bel RTL) this show has several regular segments. The first quarter of the show is hard-hitting news and the next quarter deals with cultural issues. Then, for the next 30 minutes the host takes phone calls from listeners. Finally, guests are interviewed and joked about (these jokes are called &quot;gauloises&quot; on the show). Part of the format is when guests are asked questions sent in by the listeners, the most famous being Mme Leprieur.

==History==

In 2000, station managers thought that they could do without the services of their aging top host (&quot;animateur de référence&quot;) and replaced him with Christophe Dechavanne. The rapid loss of listeners showed that the program&#x27;s success was due as much to the audience&#x27;s attachment to the hosts as to its formula, which led to the return of Philippe Bouvard as host and producer of the show the following season. Since then, the show has been hosted by Laurent Ruquier.

==On television==
A TV version aired in 1985 on Antenne 2 to celebrate its 2500th show, followed by another in 1992 for the 5000th show on TF1. A regular TV version aired on TF1 from 1992 to 1997 on Saturday evenings, with the same principles as the radio show. It attracted 11.2 million viewers.

&quot;Les Grosses Tetes&quot; has had many more special TV shows since then on France 2.

==Reception and criticism==
&quot;Les Grosses Tetes&quot; is the most popular show on RTL. Nevertheless it has been criticised for its crude humour with elements of racism, sexism and homophobia.

On 27 March 1996, Philippe Bouvard, Vincent Perrot, and the president of TF1 Patrick Le Lay were fined for having provoked racial hatred by telling a riddle comparing Muslim women to robbers.

The Association of LGBT Journalists investigated the show in 2020, noting homophobic and sexist humour as well as jokes about Romanians and Roma being thieves, and Asian people being responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="1008247" wikidata="Q424989" url="?curid=1008247" title="Klenow fragment">
<text>The Klenow fragment is a large protein fragment produced when DNA polymerase I from &quot;E. coli&quot; is enzymatically cleaved by the protease subtilisin. First reported in 1970, it retains the 5&#x27; → 3&#x27; polymerase activity and the 3’ → 5’ exonuclease activity for removal of precoding nucleotides and proofreading, but loses its 5&#x27; → 3&#x27; exonuclease activity.

The other smaller fragment formed when DNA polymerase I from &quot;E. coli&quot; is cleaved by subtilisin retains the 5&#x27; → 3&#x27; exonuclease activity but does not have the other two activities exhibited by the Klenow fragment (i.e. 5&#x27; → 3&#x27; polymerase activity, and 3&#x27; → 5&#x27; exonuclease activity).

==Research==
Because the 5&#x27; → 3&#x27; exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase I from &quot;E. coli&quot; makes it unsuitable for many applications, the Klenow fragment, which lacks this activity, can be very useful in research. The Klenow fragment is extremely useful for research-based tasks such as:

* Synthesis of double-stranded DNA from single-stranded templates
* Filling in receded 3&#x27; ends of DNA fragments to make 5&#x27; overhang blunt
* Digesting away protruding 3&#x27; overhangs
* Preparation of radioactive DNA probes

The Klenow fragment was also the original enzyme used for greatly amplifying segments of DNA in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process, before being replaced by thermostable DNA polymerases such as Taq polymerase.

==The exo-Klenow fragment==
Just as the 5&#x27; → 3&#x27; exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase I from &quot;E.coli&quot; can be undesirable, the 3&#x27; → 5&#x27; exonuclease activity of Klenow fragment can also be undesirable for certain applications. This problem can be overcome by introducing mutations in the gene that encodes Klenow. This results in forms of the enzyme being expressed that retain 5&#x27; → 3&#x27; polymerase activity, but lack any exonuclease activity (5&#x27; → 3&#x27; or 3&#x27; → 5&#x27;). This form of the enzyme is called the exo-Klenow fragment.

The exo-Klenow fragment is used in some fluorescent labeling reactions for microarray, and also in dA and dT tailing, an important step in the process of ligating DNA adapters to DNA fragments, frequently used in preparing DNA libraries for Next-Gen sequencing. (for instance see )

<doc id="1008249" wikidata="Q1638472" url="?curid=1008249" title="The Hurlingham Club">
<text>The Hurlingham Club is an exclusive private social and athletic club located in the Fulham area of London, England. Founded in 1869, it has a Georgian-style clubhouse set in of grounds. It is a member of the Association of London Clubs.

==History==

===Early history===

The Gun Club was formed in 1860 at the Hornsey Wood Tavern, which stood in what today is Finsbury Park in Harringay, London. The creation of the park in 1867 forced a relocation and Frank Heathcote received the permission of Richard Naylor to promote live pigeon shooting at his Hurlingham estate. His next step was the formation of the Hurlingham Club for this purpose and &quot;as an agreeable country resort&quot;. The club leased the estate from Naylor in 1869 and in 1874 acquired the land outright for £27,500. The pigeon today forms part of the club&#x27;s crest. Until 1905, clouds of pigeons were released in the summer from an enclosure near what is now a tennis pavilion.

The Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII), an early patron, was a keen shot and his presence ensured the club&#x27;s status and notability from the beginning. The club&#x27;s most recent patron was Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.

===Polo===

In 1873, the club published the rules of polo, which are still followed by most of the world to this day. Polo was first played at the club on 6 June 1874. On 18 July 1878, the club along with Ranelagh became the first to play a sports match under floodlights. In 1886, the club hosted the first international polo match between England and the United States. The polo matches for the 1908 Summer Olympics were played at Hurlingham. Three teams entered: Hurlingham, Roehampton Club, and a combined British and Irish team. Roehampton won.

The Westchester Cup was played at the club in 1900, 1902, 1909, 1921 and 1936. Before the Second World War, Hurlingham was the headquarters of British polo. The governing body of British polo is called the Hurlingham Polo Association. However polo is no longer staged at Hurlingham after the size of the club was significantly reduced after the war when the polo fields were compulsorily purchased by the Metropolitan Borough of Fulham to build council housing (the Sulivan Court estate). The Guards Polo Club in Windsor Great Park has succeeded to the status of the leading British polo club.

===Golf===
There is a nine-hole par 3 golf course that is open in winter months.

===Croquet===
Hurlingham has been at the centre of world croquet for many years. The Croquet Association had its headquarters in the club from 1959 to 2002. Top-ranking international competitions are regularly held on the lawns, at one time the finest in the country, though the CA headquarters have since relocated to the Cheltenham Croquet Club.

===Other sports and events===
Other sports include lawn tennis, cricket, bowls, skittles, squash and swimming (with both indoor and outdoor pools) as well as fitness facilities and a gymnasium. Games such as bridge, backgammon and chess are popular indoor pursuits. The club has also hosted the Grand Prix Ball and the Concours d&#x27;Elegance.

==Membership==
Members must be proposed and seconded by two current full members of the club. Since 2018, the waiting list for becoming a member has been closed, but children and spouses of current members are given preference when vacancies do arise.

The club currently has around 13,000 members – of whom around 6,000 have full voting rights.

===Notable members===
Lord Fowler, Lord Temple-Morris, Adam Raphael, novelist and peer Jeffrey Archer, the actor Trevor Eve and his wife Sharon Maughan are all members of the Hurlingham Club. Past members include Walter Buckmaster, the &quot;Carry On&quot; actress Liz Fraser and Air Vice-Marshal Sir William Cushion.

In 2011, Charles Nall-Cain, 3rd Baron Brocket was refused membership owing to his stint in prison.

<text>The chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta), also known as dog salmon or keta salmon, is a species of anadromous salmonid fish from the genus &quot;Oncorhynchus&quot; (Pacific salmon) native to the coastal rivers of the North Pacific and the Beringian Arctic, and is often marketed under the trade name silverbrite salmon in North America. The English name &quot;chum salmon&quot; comes from the Chinook Jargon term &quot;tsəm&quot;, meaning &quot;spotted&quot; or &quot;marked&quot;; while &quot;keta&quot; in the scientific name comes from Russian, which in turn comes from the Evenki language of Eastern Siberia. The term &#x27;Dog Salmon&#x27; is most commonly used in Alaska and refers to the Salmon whose flesh Alaskans use to feed their dogs.

In Japan, chum salmon is also known as the , or simply , while historically it was known in &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot; as up until the Meiji period. In Greater China, it is known academically as the &quot;hook-snout salmon&quot; (), but is more often called the &quot;damaha&quot; fish (), which is borrowed from &quot;dawa ịmaχa&quot;, the Nanai name of the fish used by the Hezhe minority in northern Northeast China.

==Description==
The body of the chum salmon is deeper than most salmonid species. In common with other species found in the Pacific, the anal fin has 12 to 20 rays, compared with a maximum of 12 in European species. Chum have an ocean coloration of silvery blue green with some indistinct spotting in a darker shade, and a rather paler belly. When they move into fresh water the color changes to dark olive green and the belly color deepens. When adults are near spawning, they have purple blotchy streaks near the caudal peduncle, darker towards the tail. Spawning males typically grow an elongated snout or kype, their lower fins become tipped with white and they have enlarged teeth. Some researchers speculate these characteristics are used to compete for mates.

===Sizes===
Adult chum salmon usually weigh from with an average length of . The all-tackle world record for chum recognized by the IGFA is and caught by Todd Johansson on July 11, 1995 at Edye Pass (a channel between Prescott and Porcher Islands in the Hecate Strait) in the North Coast region of British Columbia; while the all-tackle length world record is caught by Vicki D. Martin on October 20, 2021 at Wynoochee River in Washington.

==Life cycle==
Chum live for an average of three to five years, and chum in Alaska mature at the age of five years.

===Spawning===

Most chum salmon spawn in small streams and intertidal zones. Some chum travel more than up the Yukon River. Chum&quot; fry&quot; migrate out to sea from March through July, almost immediately after becoming &quot;free swimmers&quot;. They spend one to three years traveling very long distances in the ocean. These are the last salmon to spawn (November to January) in some regions. In Alaska they are the first to spawn in June and August and are then followed by pink and coho salmon. They die about two weeks after they return to the freshwater to spawn. They utilize the lower tributaries of the watershed, tend to build nests called &quot;redds&quot;, really little more than protected depressions in the gravel, in shallow edges of the watercourse and at the tail end of deep pools. The female lays eggs in the redd, the male sprays milt on the eggs, and the female covers the eggs with gravel. The female can lay up to 4000 eggs.

===Diet===
Juvenile chum eat zooplankton and insects. Recent studies show that they also eat comb jellies. As adults, they eat smaller fish.

==Distribution==
Chum salmon have the largest natural range of any Pacific salmon. Chum are found all around the North Pacific, off the coasts of Japan, Korea, the Russian Far East, British Columbia in Canada, and from Alaska to California in the United States. They undergo the longest migrations within the genus &quot;Oncorhynchus&quot;, far up the Yukon River in Alaska and Canada, and deep into the Amur River basin in Northeast China and Russia. In lesser numbers they migrate thousands of kilometers up the Mackenzie River. In the Arctic Ocean they are found in limited numbers from the Laptev Sea to the Beaufort Sea. In North America chum salmon spawn from the Mackenzie River in the Arctic to as far south as the Umpqua River, Oregon, although they were also reported in the San Lorenzo River near Santa Cruz, California in 1915 and the Sacramento River in northern California in the 1950s. In fall 2017 a half dozen chum salmon were counted in Lagunitas Creek about north of San Francisco, California.

In the open ocean, chum salmon stay fairly high on the water column, rarely diving below . Their typical swimming depths are from the surface during the day, and during the night.

==Commercial use and value==
The registered total harvest of the chum salmon in the North Pacific in 2010 was some 313,000 tons, corresponding to 91 million fish. Half of the catch was from Japan, and about a quarter each from Russia and the United States. In 2010, the chum salmon harvest was about 34% of the total harvest of all Pacific salmon species by weight.

The chum salmon is the least commercially valuable salmon in North America. Despite being extremely plentiful in Alaska, commercial fishers and sport anglers often choose not to target them because of low market value due to the fact that the chum salmon is the least desirable salmon for human consumption. Recent market developments have increased the demand for chum salmon, due to new markets developed from 1984 to 1994 in Japan and Northern Europe. They are a traditional source of dried salmon.

==Conservation==

Two populations of chum salmon have been listed under the Endangered Species Act as threatened species. These are the Hood Canal Summer Run population and the Lower Columbia River population.

==Susceptibility to diseases==
Chum are thought to be fairly resistant to whirling disease, but it is unclear.

<text>John Gabbert Bowman (May 18, 1877 – December 2, 1962) was the tenth Chancellor (1921–1945) of the University of Pittsburgh and the ninth President (1911–1914) of the University of Iowa.

He is best known for initiating and completing the 42-story Cathedral of Learning, the centerpiece of Pitt&#x27;s campus, over the objections of many faculty and community members. At the time, it was the tallest educational structure in the world. He also established the University of Pittsburgh Press and oversaw the institution of controversial athletic policies that resulted in the resignation in popular head football coach Jock Sutherland.

==Early life==
Bowman was born in Davenport, Iowa. He married Florence Ridgway Berry and they had two children.

He also worked as a journalist in Iowa and Illinois, taught in a one-room rural Iowa school and at Columbia University. From Columbia, he worked at the newly founded Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.

==Career==

In 1915, he became the founding director of the American College of Surgeons, where he served until 1921.

Bowman was the first University of Iowa alumnus to become its President, as well as the school&#x27;s first Iowa-born chief administrator. He earned the B.A. degree in 1899, the M.A. in 1904, and the Litt.D. in 1934. He became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity as an undergraduate.

He arrived on campus in 1921. Bowman resigned as chancellor from the University of Pittsburgh in 1945. The trustees named him President Honorarius and awarded him an honorary doctorate of laws.

==Death and legacy==
He died at age 85 on December 2, 1962, in Bedford, Pennsylvania.

He is mentioned in the book, &quot;Jewels in Your Crown: Mining the Treasures Within&quot;.

<doc id="1008268" wikidata="Q2215464" url="?curid=1008268" title="Saltram House">
<text>Saltram House is a grade I listed George II era house in Plympton, Devon, England. It was deemed by the architectural critic Nikolaus Pevsner to be &quot;the most impressive country house in Devon&quot;. The house was designed by the architect Robert Adam, who altered and greatly expanded the original Tudor house on two occasions. The Saloon is considered one of Adam&#x27;s finest interiors. Saltram is one of Britain&#x27;s best-preserved examples of an early Georgian house, and retains much of its original décor, plasterwork and furnishings. It contains the Parker family&#x27;s large collection of paintings, including several by Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723–1792), who was born and educated at Plympton, and was a friend of the Parker family.

The present building was commenced by John Parker (1703–1768) of nearby Boringdon Hall, Plympton, and of Court House, North Molton, both in Devon, together with his wife Catherine Poulett (1706–1758), a daughter of John Poulett, 1st Earl Poulett. It was completed by his son John Parker, 1st Baron Boringdon (1735–1788), whose son was John Parker, 1st Earl of Morley (1772–1840). The Parker family had risen to prominence in the mid-16th century as the bailiff of the manor of North Molton, Devon, under Baron Zouche of Haryngworth.

The Saltram Estate was transferred to the National Trust in lieu of death duties in 1957, and is open to the public.

==Etymology==

The name Saltram derives itself from the salt that was harvested on the nearby estuary and the fact that a &quot;ham&quot;, or homestead, was on the site before the Tudor period.

==History==

The first recorded family to have owned the house is that of Mayhew (&quot;alias&quot; Mayes, Mayhowes, etc.) who were yeoman farmers in the 16th century. The family owned Saltram for about 50 years, their prosperity declining at the end of the century when they began to sell and lease parts of the estate. Their landholdings were considerable – for example, a lease granted by them in 1588 granted the right to farm in Saltram Wood &quot;and all houses, quays and buildings adjoining or upon the same&quot;, and to have fishing rights at Laira Bridge Rock and Culverhole; to hold portions of a quay called Coldharbour; and to have the use of the Mayhowes&#x27; fishing nets.

The next family to own Saltram were the Baggs, who were probably responsible for turning the farmhouse into a mansion. Sir James Bagg, MP for Plymouth (1601–1611) and Mayor of Plymouth, purchased Saltram in about 1614. On his death the house passed to his son James II Bagg (died 1638), Deputy Governor of Plymouth and a vice-admiral closely allied to George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, a favourite of King James I. He is believed twice to have embezzled funds from the Crown, the first occasion having contributed to the failure of Buckingham&#x27;s attack on Cádiz in 1625. For reasons unknown King Charles I twice defended him despite his seemingly obvious culpability. James II Bagg died in 1638 and was succeeded by his son George Bagg, when Saltram was described as comprising &quot;One great mansion house, one stable, three gardens, two acres of orchard, eight acres of meadows&quot; and eight acres more. Despite inheriting his father&#x27;s role as Deputy Governor of Plymouth, George Bagg did not share his father&#x27;s luck and, Bagg having chosen the Royalist side in the English Civil War, Saltram suffered at the hands of the Parliamentarian forces. Following the defeat of the Royalist cause, shortly after 1643 he was forced to compound (pay a fine) in the sum of £582 to secure his landholdings.

Despite having held on to Saltram through the Civil War, the Baggs lost Saltram in 1660, shortly before the Stuart Restoration, when the Commonwealth government transferred it to the former Parliamentarian captain Henry Hatsell in payment of a large debt owed by Bagg. However, after the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, Hatsell was stripped of the house and estate, which were granted to Sir George Carteret in settlement of a loan he had made to the King during the Civil War.

In 1712 George Parker of Boringdon Hall, about two miles north of Saltram, purchased the manor of Saltram, and created the Parker dynasty which reigned over Saltram until its days as a private estate were over.

==Development==

===Inheritance===

John Parker inherited the house in 1743, and along with his wealthy wife Lady Catherine Parker (who largely funded the remodelling), embellished the building with symmetrical Palladian façades which mask the Tudor origins of the house. The interiors of the house were given delicate touches including Rococo ceiling plasterwork in the Entrance Hall, Morning Room and Velvet Drawing Room.

The second John Parker, later 1st Baron Boringdon, succeeded his father in 1768 and a year later married Theresa Robinson. Her husband&#x27;s interests included drinking and gambling but Theresa, her sister, Alice and her brothers Frederick and Thomas took an interest in the house, advising on its decoration by correspondence with Theresa. She is credited with making Saltram a “showpiece of South West England”. The six years until Theresa&#x27;s early death are considered Saltram&#x27;s golden age. The house owns ten portraits by Joshua Reynolds. Robert Adam was commissioned in 1768 to create the Saloon and the Library (the Library is now the Dining Room). Adam created everything from the door handles to the huge plasterwork ceiling. Thomas Chippendale made the furniture and Matthew Boulton made the four candelabras. Theresa and her husband spent £10,000 on the Saloon.

Boringdon also commissioned Nathaniel Richmond to lay out the present parkland which surrounds the house.

===Decline===

The third John Parker, later known as the Earl of Morley, inherited the house just twenty years after his father and took longer again to make any major changes to the house. However, in 1819 he employed the Plymouth architect John Foulston to add the Entrance Porch and create the present Library out of two smaller rooms. His second wife, Frances, continued to develop the artistic legacy of the family by producing her own watercolours and Old Master copies, which are displayed in the house. The Earl of Morley was ambitious and attempted to develop several industrial and engineering projects on the estate, but many were unsuccessful and the family fell heavily into debt.

===Transfer to the National Trust===

Money was so short that Albert Parker, 3rd Earl of Morley, was forced to leave the house between 1861 and 1884, and was only able to return after selling several of the estate&#x27;s most valuable paintings. The family&#x27;s fortunes picked up in 1926 when Edmund Parker, 4th Earl of Morley, inherited several other estates, although the good times were short-lived as the war brought damage from enemy bombing. Eventually in 1957 the house and its contents were accepted in lieu of death duties by HM Treasury, which transferred them to the National Trust.

In May 2024 the house was the featured in an episode the BBC documentary series &quot;Hidden Treasures of the National Trust&quot;.

==Landscape==

The Laira (estuary) is tidal, so the view alternates between water and mud. The completion of the landfill site at Chelson Meadow has created a green space. Views of Plymouth Sound are possible from the first storey of the house and the Castle summerhouse in the gardens.

<text>GameSpy was an American provider of online multiplayer and matchmaking middleware for video games founded in 1999 by Mark Surfas. After the release of a multiplayer server browser for Quake, QSpy, Surfas licensed the software under the GameSpy brand to other video game publishers through a newly established company, GameSpy Industries, which also incorporated his Planet Network of video game news and information websites, and GameSpy.com.

GameSpy merged with IGN in 2004; by 2014, its services had been used by over 800 video game publishers and developers since its launch. In August 2012, the GameSpy Industries division (which remained responsible for the GameSpy service) was acquired by mobile video game developer Glu Mobile. IGN (then owned by News Corporation) retained ownership of the GameSpy.com website. In February 2013, IGN&#x27;s new owner, Ziff Davis, shut down IGN&#x27;s &quot;secondary&quot; sites, including GameSpy&#x27;s network. This was followed by the announcement in April 2014 that GameSpy&#x27;s service platform would be shut down on May 31, 2014.

==History==
The 1996 release of id Software&#x27;s video game &quot;Quake&quot;, one of the first 3D multiplayer action games to allow play over the Internet, furthered the concept of players creating and releasing &quot;mods&quot; or modifications of games. Mark Surfas saw the need for hosting and distribution of these mods and created PlanetQuake, a &quot;Quake&quot;-related hosting and news site. The massive success of mods catapulted PlanetQuake to huge traffic and a central position in the burgeoning game website scene.

&quot;Quake&quot; also marked the beginning of the Internet multiplayer real-time action game scene. However, finding a &quot;Quake&quot; server on the Internet proved difficult, as players could only share IP addresses of known servers between themselves or post them on websites. To solve this problem, a team of three programmers (consisting of Joe &quot;QSpy&quot; Powell, Tim Cook, and Jack &quot;morbid&quot; Matthews) formed Spy Software and created QSpy (or QuakeSpy). This allowed the listing and searching of Quake servers available across the Internet. Surfas licensed QSpy and became the official distributor and marketer while retaining the original programming team. QSpy became QuakeSpy and went on to be bundled with its QuakeWorld update – an unprecedented move by a top tier developer and huge validation for QuakeSpy. With the release of the Quake engine-based game &quot;Hexen II&quot;, QuakeSpy added this game to its capabilities and was renamed GameSpy3D. In 1997 Mark Surfas licensed GameSpy 3D from Spy Software, and created GameSpy Industries.

In 1999, GameSpy received angel investment funding from entrepreneur David Berkus. The company released MP3Spy.com (later renamed RadioSpy.com), a software browser allowing people to browse and connect to online radio feeds, such as those using Nullsoft&#x27;s ShoutCast. GameSpy received $3 million in additional funding from the Yucaipa Companies, an investment group headed by Hollywood agent Michael Ovitz and Southern California supermarket billionaire Ronald Burkle.

The expanding of the company&#x27;s websites included the games portal, GameSpy.com, created in October 1999; the Planet Network (also known as the GameSpy Network), a collection of &quot;Planet&quot; websites devoted to popular video games (such as Planet Quake, Planet Half-Life and Planet Unreal) as well as the genre-related websites, 3DActionPlanet, RPGPlanet, SportPlanet and StrategyPlanet; ForumPlanet, the network&#x27;s extensive message board system; and FilePlanet, which was one of the largest video game file download sites. It also included platform-specific sites (e.g., Planet PS2, Planet Xbox, Planet Nintendo and Planet Dreamcast), but these were consolidated into GameSpy.com; only Classic Gaming remains separate. ForumPlanet and FilePlanet were services offered by GameSpy, and were not part of the Planet Network.

In 2000, GameSpy received additional investment funding from the Ziff Davis publishing division ZDNet.com and from Guillemot Corporation. GameSpy shut down its RadioSpy division, backing away from the online music market which was dominated by peer-to-peer applications such as Napster and Gnutella. In 2001, GameSpy&#x27;s corporate technology business grew to include software development kits and middleware for video game consoles, such as Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 2, Sega&#x27;s Dreamcast and Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox. In March 2007, IGN and GameSpy Industries merged, and was briefly known as IGN/GameSpy before formalizing their corporate name as IGN Entertainment.

Also in 2000, GameSpy turned GameSpy3D into GameSpy Arcade and purchased RogerWilco, MPlayer.com and various assets from HearMe; the MPlayer service was shut down and the RogerWilco technology is improved and incorporated into GameSpy Arcade. GameSpy Arcade was the company&#x27;s flagship matchmaking software, allowing users to find servers for different online video games (whether they be free or purchased) and connect the user to game servers of that game. GameSpy also published the Roger Wilco voice chat software, primarily meant for communication and co-ordination in team-oriented games, where users join a server to chat with other users on the server using voice communication. This software rivaled the other major voice chat software Ventrilo and Teamspeak. The company&#x27;s &quot;Powered by GameSpy&quot; technology enabled online functionality in over 300 PC and console games. In 2005, GameSpy added the PlayStation Portable, and Nintendo DS to its stable supported platforms. In March 2007, GameSpy added the Wii as another supported platform.

=== Shutdown ===
GameSpy Industries (the entity responsible for GameSpy multiplayer services) was bought from IGN Entertainment by Glu Mobile in August 2012, and proceeded in December to raise integration costs and shut down servers for many older games, including &quot;Fairytale Fights&quot; , &quot;Star Wars: Battlefront&quot;, &quot;Sniper Elite&quot;, &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator X&quot;, &quot;Saints Row 2&quot;, and &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot;, with no warning to developers or players, much to the outrage of communities of those games. GameSpy Technologies remained operational as a separate entity since. In February 2013, following the acquisition of IGN Entertainment by Ziff Davis, IGN&#x27;s &quot;secondary&quot; sites were shut down, ending GameSpy&#x27;s editorial operations.

In April 2014, Glu announced that it would shut down the GameSpy servers on May 31, 2014, so its developers could focus on work for Glu&#x27;s own services. Games that still used GameSpy are no longer able to offer online functionality or multiplayer services through GameSpy. While some publishers announced plans to migrate GameSpy-equipped games to other platforms (such as Steam or in-house servers), some publishers, such as Nintendo (who used the GameSpy servers as the basis of its Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection platform for DS and Wii games) did not, particularly due to the age of the affected games. Electronic Arts, in particular, announced 24 PC games, including titles such as &quot;Battlefield 2&quot;, the &quot;Crysis&quot; series, &quot;Saints Row 2&quot; and the &quot;Star Wars: Battlefront&quot; series, would be affected by the end of GameSpy service.

Fan-created mods restored online functionality with alternative servers. One such mod for the PC version of &quot;&quot; was officially incorporated into a patch for the game released by Bungie in May 2014, and Disney helped developers create a similar mod for &quot;Battlefront II&quot; (2005) in 2017. 10 days prior to the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection shutdown, a fan continuation of the project was created named Wiimmfi. By contrast, in 2017, Electronic Arts demanded the takedown of modified versions of &quot;Battlefield 2&quot; and &quot;Battlefield 2142&quot; on alternate servers, distributed by a group known as &quot;Revive Network&quot;, as infringement of their copyrights.

==&quot;The GameSpy Debriefings&quot;==
&quot;The GameSpy Debriefings&quot; was a party-style discussion between editors of GameSpy and IGN Entertainment on (purportedly) that week&#x27;s gaming news. &quot;The GameSpy Debriefings&quot; was the 25th most popular podcast under the category &quot;Games and Hobbies&quot; on iTunes (as of May 1, 2011). It was however infamous for the crew&#x27;s frequent propensity to de-rail the conversation from video games into explicit content or in-depth discussions about nerd culture.

The main crew at the show&#x27;s conclusion of &quot;The GameSpy Debriefings&quot; consisted of:
* Anthony Gallegos, then of IGN Entertainment, previously of 1UP.com, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, and GameSpy
* Ryan Scott, then of GameSpy, previously the executive editor for the 1UP.com Network&#x27;s reviews department, and the reviews editor for both &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; and &quot;Games for Windows: The Official Magazine&quot;
* Scott Bromley, formerly of IGN Entertainment
* Brian Altano, Humor Editor and graphic designer for IGN.com/GameSpy

Frequent guests included:
* Arthur Gies, formerly of IGN Entertainment
* Brian Miggels, formerly of IGN Entertainment and GameSpy
* Will Tuttle, former Editor-In-Chief of GameSpy
* Jack DeVries, former Editor of GameSpy

On July 30, 2011, &quot;The GameSpy Debriefings&quot; ended with an episode consisting of only the main crew. Following its conclusion, they launched a fundraising drive on Kickstarter which resulted in the release of their own popular podcast, The Comedy Button. &quot;The Comedy Button&quot; is similar in content to the later &quot;GameSpy Debriefings&quot;, with a renewed focus on humorous discussions and listener e-mails rather than the in-depth discussion of recent video games like the early &quot;Debriefings&quot;.

 &quot;The Comedy Button&quot; ended with 550 episodes being produced.

<text>Urusei Yatsura were a Scottish rock band formed in Glasgow in 1993.

==History==
Founding members Fergus Lawrie and Graham Kemp met in the summer of 1993, whilst attending the University of Glasgow. They recruited Elaine Graham as bassist, and the line-up was completed with the subsequent addition of Elaine&#x27;s brother, Ian Graham, on drums. They took their band name from the manga &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot;, written by Rumiko Takahashi, and contributed their first recording, &quot;Guitars Are Boring&quot;, to a compilation album released by the Kazoo Club. This was based in Glasgow, and run at one point by the future Franz Ferdinand singer Alex Kapranos. This record in turn brought them to the attention of the BBC Radio DJ John Peel, who brought them in to do a session in 1994. They recorded four Peel Sessions, between Glasgow and Maida Vale Studios, as well as appearing on the Evening Session for Steve Lamacq.

They released three albums: &quot;We Are Urusei Yatsura&quot; (1996), &quot;Slain By Urusei Yatsura&quot; (1998) and &quot;Everybody Loves Urusei Yatsura&quot; (2000). Albums in America and Japan were released under the name of Yatsura for legal reasons. The band had one Top 40 hit single, 1997&#x27;s &quot;Hello Tiger&quot;, which reached number 40 in the UK Singles Chart. Other singles released by the band include &quot;Strategic Hamlets&quot; and &quot;Slain By Elf&quot;.

Urusei Yatsura split in June 2001, leaving Kemp to work on solo material and the other band members to form Projekt A-ko. In 2011, Lawrie formed the three-piece band, Angel of Everyone Murder, with Sarah Glass and Lea Cummings on bass, and released a self-titled double album on Kovorox Sound. The release featured six drone compositions of 15–20 minutes each, made with self-modified guitars he called HALO guitars. In 2012, &quot;Angel of Everyone Murder 2&quot; was released.

In 2016, Rocket Girl released a &#x27;Best of&#x27; album called &quot;You are my Urusei Yatsura&quot;, consisting of recordings they had made for the BBC sessions.

In 2020, a compilation of b-sides and rarities, &quot;Can You Spell Urusei Yatsura - Lost Songs 1993-2000&quot;, was released.

<doc id="1008278" wikidata="Q2314257" url="?curid=1008278" title="Solar minimum">
<text>Solar minimum is the regular period of least solar activity in the Sun&#x27;s 11-year solar cycle. During solar minimum, sunspot and solar flare activity diminishes, and often does not occur for days at a time. On average, the solar cycle takes about 11 years to go from one solar minimum to the next, with duration observed varying from 9 to 14 years. The date of the minimum is described by a smoothed average over 12 months of sunspot activity, so identifying the date of the solar minimum usually can only happen 6 months after the minimum takes place.

Solar minimum is contrasted with the solar maximum, when hundreds of sunspots may occur.

==Solar minimum and solar maximum==
Solar minima and maxima are the two extremes of the Sun&#x27;s 11-year and 400-year activity cycle. At a maximum, the Sun is peppered with sunspots, solar flares erupt, and the Sun hurls billion-ton clouds of electrified gas into space. Sky watchers may see more auroras, and space agencies must monitor radiation storms for astronaut protection. Power outages, satellite malfunctions, communication disruptions, and GPS receiver malfunctions are just a few of the things that can happen during a solar maximum.

At a solar minimum, there are fewer sunspots and solar flares subside. Sometimes, days or weeks go by without a spot.

==Predicting solar minimum cycles==
Their non-linear character makes predictions of solar activity very difficult. The solar minimum is characterized by a period of decreased solar activity with few, if any, sunspots. Scientists from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) also developed a computer model of solar dynamics (Solar dynamo) for more accurate predictions and have confidence in the forecast based upon a series of test runs with the newly developed model simulating the strength of the past eight solar cycles with more than 98% accuracy.
In hindsight the prediction proved to be wildly inaccurate and not representative of the observed sunspot numbers.

During 2008–09 NASA scientists noted that the Sun is undergoing a &quot;deep solar minimum,&quot; stating: &quot;There were no sunspots observed on 266 of [2008&#x27;s] 366 days (73%). Prompted by these numbers, some observers suggested that the solar cycle had hit bottom in 2008. Sunspot counts for 2009 dropped even lower. As of September 14, 2009 there were no sunspots on 206 of the year&#x27;s 257 days (80%). Solar physicist Dean Pesnell of the Goddard Space Flight Center came to the following conclusion: &quot;We&#x27;re experiencing a very deep solar minimum.&quot; His statement was confirmed by other specialists in the field. &quot;This is the quietest sun we&#x27;ve seen in almost a century,&quot; agreed sunspot expert David Hathaway of the National Space Science and Technology Center NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center. However, the activity is still at a higher level than at a grand solar minimum.

==Grand solar minima and maxima==

Grand solar minima occur when several solar cycles exhibit lesser than average activity for decades or centuries. Solar cycles still occur during these grand solar minimum periods but are at a lower intensity than usual. The grand minima form a special mode of the solar dynamo operation.

A list of historical Grand minima of solar activity includes also Grand minima ca. 690 AD, 360 BC, 770 BC, 1390 BC, 2860 BC, 3340 BC, 3500 BC, 3630 BC, 3940 BC, 4230 BC, 4330 BC, 5260 BC, 5460 BC, 5620 BC, 5710 BC, 5990 BC, 6220 BC, 6400 BC, 7040 BC, 7310 BC, 7520 BC, 8220 BC, 9170 BC.

<doc id="1008284" wikidata="Q855673" url="?curid=1008284" title="Pride and Prejudice (1995 TV series)">
<text>Pride and Prejudice is a six-episode 1995 British television drama, adapted by Andrew Davies from Jane Austen&#x27;s 1813 novel of the same name. Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth starred as Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy, respectively. Produced by Sue Birtwistle and directed by Simon Langton, the serial was a BBC production with additional funding from the American A&amp;E Network. BBC1 originally broadcast the 55-minute episodes from 24 September to 29 October 1995. The A&amp;E Network aired the series in double episodes on three consecutive nights beginning 14 January 1996.

Critically acclaimed and a popular success, &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; was honoured with several awards, including a BAFTA Television Award for Jennifer Ehle for &quot;Best Actress&quot; and an Emmy for &quot;Outstanding Individual Achievement in Costume Design for a Miniseries or a Special&quot;. The role of Mr Darcy elevated Colin Firth to stardom. A scene showing Firth in a wet shirt was recognised as &quot;one of the most unforgettable moments in British TV history&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the adaptation &quot;a witty mix of love stories and social conniving, cleverly wrapped in the ambitions and illusions of a provincial gentry&quot;. The series inspired author Helen Fielding to write the popular &quot;Bridget Jones&quot; novels, and their screen adaptations subsequently featured Firth as Bridget&#x27;s love interest, Mark Darcy.

==Plot==
Episode 1
Mr Charles Bingley, a wealthy gentleman from the north of England, settles down at the rented Netherfield estate near Meryton village in Hertfordshire for the autumn. Mrs Bennet, unlike her husband, is excited at the prospect of marrying off one of her five daughters (Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty, and Lydia) to the newcomer. Mr Bennet claims to have no intention of calling on Mr Bingley; unless he does so, his wife and daughters will be unable to socialise with Mr Bingley. Mrs Bennet, perturbed by Mr Bennet&#x27;s refusal to make Bingley&#x27;s acquaintance, declares that she wishes the girls would stop talking about Bingley all together, as they will never meet him anyway. Mr Bennet replies that he wishes he had known that earlier, as he has already paid Mr Bingley a visit. Mrs Bennet and the younger girls are shocked and ecstatic. Bingley takes an immediate liking to Jane at the local country dance, while his best friend Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy, rumoured to be twice as rich as Bingley, declines to dance with anyone, including Elizabeth. Elizabeth&#x27;s poor impression of his character is confirmed at a later gathering at Lucas Lodge, and she and Darcy clash verbally on the two nights she spends at Netherfield, caring for the sick Jane who fell ill after riding there in the rain when invited by Bingley&#x27;s sister.

Episode 2
Mr William Collins, a sycophantic and somewhat dimwitted clergyman, visits his cousins, the Bennets. As Mr and Mrs Bennet do not have a son, he is currently the entailed heir of their estate, Longbourn. He intends to marry a Bennet daughter as an act of benign goodwill, to reassure Mrs Bennet that she and her unwed daughters would not be rendered homeless once Mr Collins inherits the estate. He therefore invites himself for a two-week visit to get to know the family better and select a daughter to marry. However, the Bennet girls judge Mr Collins to be a rather ridiculous man, an &quot;oddity&quot; with many peculiarities of speech and deportment. They nevertheless treat him civilly and take him to balls and social events in Meryton. One day, while on a walk around Meryton, they meet members of a newly arrived militia regiment, including Mr George Wickham. At a social event, Wickham befriends Elizabeth and says that his father was the steward for Darcy&#x27;s late father, and that he originally planned to join the clergy. However, Darcy denied Wickham the church &quot;living&quot; that Darcy&#x27;s father had promised him. At a ball at Netherfield, Darcy asks Elizabeth to dance, which she grudgingly but politely accepts. Mrs Bennet tells Mr Collins that she expects Jane to soon be engaged, so he instead proposes to Elizabeth. She firmly rejects him and is supported in this by Mr Bennet. While Mrs Bennet reacts angrily to this, Elizabeth&#x27;s close friend Charlotte Lucas invites Mr Collins to visit her family at Lucas Lodge.

Episode 3
Elizabeth is stunned and appalled to learn that Charlotte Lucas has accepted Mr Collins&#x27;s marriage proposal. When the Netherfield party departs for London in the autumn, Jane goes to stay with her middle-class London relations, the Gardiners, but she soon notices that the Bingleys ignore her. Elizabeth departs for the Collins&#x27; home in Kent in the spring to visit Charlotte. They live near Rosings, the estate of the formidable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who is Darcy&#x27;s aunt. Elizabeth meets Darcy several times there. Elizabeth learns of Darcy&#x27;s direct responsibility for Bingley being separated from Jane&#x27;s company. Soon after, Darcy unexpectedly tells her that he admires her and loves her, so much so that in spite of her inferior social standing, he proposes marriage. Elizabeth flatly rejects him, noting his arrogant, disagreeable, and proud character, and for his part in her sister&#x27;s failed romance and Mr Wickham&#x27;s misfortune.

Episode 4
Darcy justifies his previous actions in a long letter to Elizabeth: he misjudged Jane&#x27;s affection for Bingley, but exposes Wickham as a gambler who once attempted to elope with Darcy&#x27;s young sister, Georgiana, to obtain her inheritance. Back at Longbourn, Mr Bennet allows Lydia to accompany the militia to Brighton as a personal friend of the militia colonel&#x27;s wife. Elizabeth joins the Gardiners on a sightseeing trip to Derbyshire and visits Pemberley, Darcy&#x27;s estate, during his absence. Greatly impressed by the immense scale and richness of the estate, Elizabeth listens to the housekeeper&#x27;s earnest tales of her master&#x27;s lifelong goodness, to the Gardiners&#x27; surprise. Meanwhile, Darcy refreshes from his unannounced journey home by taking a swim in a lake. After an unexpected and awkward encounter with Elizabeth, Darcy is able to prevent the party&#x27;s premature departure with an unusual degree of friendliness and politeness.

Episode 5
Elizabeth and the Gardiners receive an invitation to an evening at Pemberley, where she befriends Georgiana and Darcy and Elizabeth share significant glances. The next morning, Elizabeth receives two letters from Jane, revealing that Lydia has eloped from Brighton with Wickham. As Elizabeth prepares to return to Longbourn, Darcy arrives and offers help, but upon hearing the news about Lydia, becomes disturbed and leaves in haste. Elizabeth supposes she will never see him again. The Bennets are dismayed by the scandal and unable to locate Lydia, until Mr Gardiner writes that Lydia and Wickham have been found. They are not married, but soon will be under the Gardiners&#x27; care. The Bennets are relieved, but Mr Bennet wonders what it cost Mr Gardiner to get Wickham to marry a girl with no fortune. Elizabeth tells Jane of her last meeting with Darcy, including her ambivalent feelings for him.

Episode 6
After Lydia carelessly mentions Darcy&#x27;s involvement in her wedding, Mrs Gardiner enlightens Elizabeth: Darcy found the errant couple and paid for everything needed to resolve the situation, including a large payment to Wickham. When Bingley and Darcy return to Netherfield in the autumn, Darcy apologises to Bingley for interfering in his relationship with Jane, and gives his blessing for the couple to wed. Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who has long intended for Darcy to marry her sickly daughter Anne, has heard rumours of an engagement between Darcy and Elizabeth. She calls on Elizabeth, demanding that she deny the engagement and renounce Darcy forever. Elizabeth confirms that there is no engagement, but refuses any pledge for the future. When Elizabeth thanks Darcy for his role in Lydia&#x27;s marriage, he says that Lady Catherine&#x27;s story had encouraged him to reaffirm his feelings for Elizabeth. Elizabeth admits the complete transformation of her feelings, and agrees to their engagement, taking her family by surprise. The series ends with a double winter wedding: Jane to Bingley, and Elizabeth to Darcy.

==Casting==
When casting the many characters of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, the producer Sue Birtwistle and director Simon Langton were looking for actors with wit, charm and charisma, who could play the Regency period. Their choices for the protagonists, 20-year-old Elizabeth Bennet and 28-year-old Mr Darcy, determined the other actors cast. Hundreds of actresses between 15 and 28 auditioned for the younger female characters, and those with the right presence were screen-tested, performing several prepared scenes in period costumes and makeup in a television studio. Straight offers were made to several established actors.

Jennifer Ehle was chosen from six serious candidates to play Elizabeth, the second Bennet daughter, the brightest girl and her father&#x27;s favourite. At the time in her mid-20s, Ehle had read &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; when she was 12 and was the only actor to be present throughout the whole filming schedule. Sue Birtwistle particularly wanted Colin Firth, a relatively unknown British actor in his mid-30s at the time, to play the wealthy and aloof Mr Darcy. Birtwistle had worked with him on the mid-1980s comedy film &quot;Dutch Girls&quot;, but he repeatedly turned down her offer as he neither felt attracted to Austen&#x27;s feminine perspective nor believed himself to be right for the role. Birtwistle&#x27;s persistent coaxing and his deeper examination of the Darcy character finally convinced him to accept the role. Firth and Ehle began a romantic relationship during the filming of the series, which received media attention only after the couple&#x27;s separation.

Benjamin Whitrow was cast to play Mr Bennet, Elizabeth&#x27;s distinguished but financially imprudent and occasionally indulgent gentry father. Alison Steadman was cast to play the parvenu Mrs Bennet, Elizabeth&#x27;s mortifyingly affected social-climbing mother. Steadman was offered the role without auditions or screen tests. Elizabeth&#x27;s four sisters, whose ages ranged between 15 and 22, were cast to look dissimilar from each other. Susannah Harker portrayed Elizabeth&#x27;s beautiful older sister Jane, who desires to only see good in others. Lucy Briers, Polly Maberly, and Julia Sawalha played Elizabeth&#x27;s younger sisters – the plain Mary, the good-natured but flighty and susceptible Kitty, and frivolous and headstrong Lydia. Being 10 years older than 15-year-old Lydia, Julia Sawalha, of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; fame, had enough acting experience to get the role without screen tests. Joanna David and Tim Wylton appeared as the Gardiners, Elizabeth&#x27;s maternal aunt and uncle. David Bamber played the unctuous clergyman, Mr Collins, a cousin of Mr Bennet. Lucy Scott portrayed Elizabeth&#x27;s best friend and Mr Collins&#x27;s wife, Charlotte Lucas, and David Bark-Jones portrayed Lieutenant Denny.

The producers found Crispin Bonham-Carter to have the best physical contrast to Firth&#x27;s Darcy and gave him his first major television role as the good-natured and wealthy Mr Charles Bingley. Bonham-Carter had originally auditioned for the part of Mr George Wickham, a handsome militia lieutenant whose charm conceals his licentiousness and greed, but Adrian Lukis was cast instead. Anna Chancellor, of &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; fame, played Mr Bingley&#x27;s sister Caroline Bingley. (Chancellor is also Jane Austen&#x27;s six-times-great-niece.) Mr Bingley&#x27;s other sister and his brother-in-law were played by Lucy Robinson (Louisa Hurst) and Rupert Vansittart (Mr Hurst). Casting the role of Darcy&#x27;s young sister, Georgiana, proved hard as the producers were looking for a young actress who appeared innocent, proud and yet shy, had class and could also play the piano. After auditioning over 70 actresses, Simon Langton suggested Emilia Fox, the real-life daughter of Joanna David (Mrs Gardiner), for the part. Barbara Leigh-Hunt was cast as Darcy&#x27;s meddling aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, without auditions or screen tests.

==Production==
===Conception and adaptation===

Jane Austen&#x27;s novel &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; had already been the subject of numerous television and film adaptations, including BBC television versions in 1938, 1952, 1958, 1967 and 1980. In the autumn of 1986, after watching a preview of Austen&#x27;s &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot;, Sue Birtwistle and Andrew Davies agreed to adapt &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, one of their favourite books, for television. Birtwistle in particular felt that a new adaptation on film would serve the drama better than the previous videotaped &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; television adaptations, which looked too &quot;undernourished&quot; and &quot;unpoetic&quot;. The needs of TV scheduling forced Davies to change his original plan of a five-episode adaptation to six. Birtwistle and Davies then offered the first three scripts to ITV in late 1986 to build on the guaranteed BBC audience, but the recent TV adaptation led to a delay. When ITV announced its renewed interest in 1993, Michael Wearing of the BBC commissioned the final scripts with co-funding from the American A&amp;E Network. Director Simon Langton and the art department joined pre-production in January and February 1994.
Although Birtwistle and Davies wished to remain true to the tone and spirit of the novel, they wanted to produce &quot;a fresh, lively story about real people&quot;, not an &quot;old studio-bound BBC drama that was shown in the Sunday teatime slot&quot;. Emphasising sex and money as the themes of the story, Davies shifted the focus from Elizabeth to Elizabeth and Darcy and foreshadowed Darcy&#x27;s role in the narrative resolution. To portray the characters as real human beings, Davies added short backstage scenes such as the Bennet girls dressing up to advertise themselves in the marriage market. New scenes where men pursue their hobbies with their peers departed from Jane Austen&#x27;s focus on women. The biggest technical difficulty proved to be adapting the long letters in the second half of the story. Davies employed techniques such as voice-overs, flashbacks, and having the characters read the letters to themselves and to each other. Davies added some dialogue to clarify events from the novel to a modern audience but left much of the novel&#x27;s dialogue intact.

=== Filming ===
Director of photography John Kenway used Super 16mm film, which has a slightly smaller widescreen aspect ratio than 16:9, but the series was originally broadcast 4:3 pan and scan.

The budget of about £1 million per episode (totalling US$9.6 million) allowed 20 shooting weeks of five days to film six 55-minute episodes. Production aimed for 10.5-hour shooting days plus time for costume and make-up. Two weeks before filming began, about 70 of the cast and crew gathered for the script read-through, followed by rehearsals, lessons for dancing, horse-riding, fencing, and other skills that needed to be ready ahead of the actual filming. Filming took place between June 1994 and 1 November 1994 to reflect the changing seasons in the plot, followed by post-production until mid-May 1995. Scenes in the same place were grouped in the filming schedule.

Twenty-four locations, most of them owned by the National Trust, and eight studio sets were used for filming. Reflecting the wealth differences between the main characters, the filming location for Longbourn showed the comfortable family house of the Bennet family, whereas Darcy&#x27;s Pemberley needed to look like the &quot;most beautiful place&quot;, showing good taste and the history of the aristocracy.

The first location that the producers agreed on was Lacock in Wiltshire to represent the village of Meryton. Luckington Court nearby served as the interior and exterior of Longbourn. Lyme Hall in Cheshire was chosen as Pemberley but management problems forced production to film Pemberley&#x27;s interiors at Sudbury Hall in Sudbury, Derbyshire.

The producers found Belton House in Grantham, Lincolnshire the best match for Rosings, Lady Catherine de Bourgh&#x27;s estate, which needed to appear &quot;over-the-top&quot; to reflect her disagreeableness. Old Rectory at Teigh in Rutland was chosen as Hunsford parsonage, Mr Collins&#x27;s home. Edgcote House in south-west Northamptonshire served as the interior and exterior of Bingley&#x27;s Netherfield, along with Brocket Hall in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire as the Netherfield ballroom. The London streets were filmed in Lord Leycester Hospital in Warwick, Warwickshire. Wickham&#x27;s and Georgiana&#x27;s planned elopement in Ramsgate was filmed in the English seaside resort Weston-super-Mare in Somerset. Wickham&#x27;s wedding takes place in St Paul&#x27;s in Deptford, London.

=== Costumes and make-up ===
Because &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; was a period drama, the design required more research than contemporary films. The personality and wealth of the characters were reflected in their costumes; the wealthy Bingley sisters were never shown in print dresses and they wore big feathers in their hair. As the BBC&#x27;s stock of early 19th century costumes was limited, costume designer Dinah Collin designed most of the costumes, visiting museums for inspiration while trying to make the clothes attractive to a modern audience (although some costumes, mostly worn by extras, were re-used from earlier BBC productions or hired). Elizabeth&#x27;s clothes had earthy tones and were fitted to allow easy and natural movements in line with the character&#x27;s activity and liveliness. In contrast, Collin chose pale or creamy white colours for the clothes of the other Bennet girls to highlight their innocence and simplicity and richer colours for Bingley&#x27;s sisters and Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Colin Firth participated in the wardrobe decisions and wanted his character to wear darker colours, leaving the warmer colours for Bingley.

The producers imagined Darcy to be dark despite no such references in the novel and asked Firth to dye black his light-brown hair, eyebrows and lashes; they instructed all male actors to let their hair grow before filming and shave off their moustaches. Three brunette wigs were made to cover Ehle&#x27;s short, blonde hair and one wig for Alison Steadman (Mrs Bennet) because of her thick, heavy hair. Susannah Harker&#x27;s (Jane) hair was slightly lightened to contrast with Elizabeth&#x27;s and was arranged in a classic Greek style to highlight the character&#x27;s beauty. Mary&#x27;s plainness was achieved by painting spots on Lucy Briers&#x27;s face; her hair was greased to suggest an unwashed appearance and was arranged to emphasise the actress&#x27;s protruding ears. As Kitty and Lydia were too young and wild to have their hair done by the maids, the actresses&#x27; hair was not changed much. Makeup artist Caroline Noble had always considered Mr Collins a sweaty character with a moist upper lip; she also greased David Bamber&#x27;s hair and gave him a low parting to suggest baldness.

=== Music and choreography ===

Carl Davis had been writing scores for BBC adaptations of classic novels since the mid-1970s and approached Sue Birtwistle during pre-production. Aiming to communicate the wit and vitality of the novel and its theme of marriage and love in a small town in the early 19th century, he used contemporary classical music as inspiration, in particular a popular Beethoven septet of the period, as well as a theme strongly reminiscent of the finale of Beethoven&#x27;s Emperor Concerto. For control over the sound, the music was recorded in six hours by a group of up to 18 musicians and was then fed into tiny earpieces of the screen musicians, who mimed playing the instruments. The actresses whose characters played the piano, Lucy Briers (Mary) and Emilia Fox (Georgiana), were already accomplished pianists and were given the opportunity to practice weeks ahead of filming. Among the songs and movements that were played in the serial were Handel&#x27;s &quot;Air con Variazioni&quot; from Suite No. 5 in E Major HWV 430 and &quot;Slumber, Dear Maid&quot; from his opera &quot;Xerxes&quot; (in 1813 these works by Handel would have been considered quite old-fashioned, adding to the perception that Mary&#x27;s tastes are a bit out of fashion), Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Rondo alla turca&quot;, &quot;Voi che sapete&quot; and other music from his operas &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; and &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Andante favori&quot;, the second movement from Muzio Clementi&#x27;s Sonatina No.4 and the traditional folk song &quot;The Barley Mow&quot;. A soundtrack with Davis&#x27;s themes was released on CD in 1995. The text of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Voi, che sapete&quot; (sung in an English translation) is a particularly meaningful choice: the original Italian is a love song, including the words &quot;You, who know what love is, tell me, is that what I feel in my heart?&quot; Lizzie sings this, and soon after, she graciously &quot;saves&quot; Georgiana from embarrassment at the mention of Wickham, and Darcy further realizes her good heart. This musical theme is soon echoed, after that episode, as Darcy walks along the hall; tell me, is love what I feel in my heart?

Many scenes in the book were set at dances or balls. Jane Gibson based her choreography on &quot;The Apted Book of Country Dances&quot; (1966) by W.S. Porter, which had several late-18th-century dances by Charles and Samuel Thompson such as &quot;The Shrewsbury Lasses&quot;, &quot;A Trip to Highgate&quot; and &quot;Mr Beveridge&#x27;s Maggot&quot;. Although these dances gave the story an impression of authenticity, they were anachronistic, being out of fashion by the time of the story. Some fifteen dances were choreographed and rehearsed before filming. Polly Maberly and Julia Sawalha, the dance-mad Kitty and Lydia, had three days to learn the dances. Three days were allotted for the filming of the ball at Netherfield, whose pace and style concentrated on elegance rather than the community enjoying themselves as at the dance at Meryton. The musicians and dancers had earpieces with music playing to allow dialogue recording. Many wide-shots of Elizabeth&#x27;s and Darcy&#x27;s dance at Netherfield later turned out to be unusable because of a hair in front of a lens so the editors resorted to close-up shots and material provided by a steadicam.

== Themes and style ==

The adaptation received praise for its faithfulness to the novel, which highlights the importance of environment and upbringing on peoples&#x27; development, although privilege is not necessarily advantageous. Describing the adaptation as &quot;a witty mix of love stories and social conniving, cleverly wrapped in the ambitions and illusions of a provincial gentry&quot;, critics noted that Davies&#x27;s focus on sex and money and Austen&#x27;s wry, incisive humour and the &quot;deft&quot; characterisation, prevented the television adaptation from &quot;descending into the realm of a nicely-costumed, brilliantly-photographed melodrama&quot;.
To avoid a narrator, the serial delegates the novel&#x27;s first ironic sentence to Elizabeth in an early scene. The adaptation opens with a view of Darcy&#x27;s and Bingley&#x27;s horses as they race across a field toward the Netherfield estate, expressing vitality; Elizabeth watches them before breaking into a run. While the novel indicates Elizabeth&#x27;s independence and energy in her three-mile trek to Netherfield, the adaptation of this scene also shows her rebelliousness and love of nature.

In what is &quot;perhaps the most radical revision of Austen&#x27;s text&quot;, the BBC drama departs from a late 18th-century vision of emotional restraint and portrays emotions in a &quot;modern&quot; interpretation of the story. The novel leaves Elizabeth and the reader uncertain of Darcy&#x27;s emotions and the adaptation uses additional scenes to hint at Darcy&#x27;s inability to physically contain or verbally express his emotional turmoil. On the other hand, whereas the climax of the novel describes Darcy expressing his ardent love for Elizabeth at length (though Austen leaves his actual words to the reader&#x27;s imagination), the adaptation elides this moment and passes directly to the next lines of dialogue. Scholars argue that activities such as billiards, bathing, fencing and swimming (see the lake scene) offer Darcy to a female gaze; he is often presented in profile by a window or a fireplace when his friends discuss Elizabeth. Many passages relating to appearance or characters&#x27; viewpoints were lifted from the novel.

The novel shows irony with &quot;unmistakable strains of cynicism, ... laughing at human nature without any real hope of changing it&quot;. Laughter in the story, which ranges from irresponsible laughter to laughter at people and laughter of amusement and relief, can also be linked to the sexual tensions among the different characters. Despite their appeal to modern audiences, laughter and wit were seen as vulgar and irreverent in Austen&#x27;s time. The BBC drama made changes &quot;with a view to exposing a character, or adding humour or irony to a situation&quot;. The adaptation comically exaggerates the characters of Mrs Bennet, Miss Bingley and Mr Collins, even showing Mrs Bennet on the verge of hysteria in many of the early scenes.

The serial expands on Austen&#x27;s metaphorical use of landscapes, reinforcing beauty and authenticity. Elizabeth takes every opportunity to enjoy nature and to escape exposure to Mr Collins and Lady Catherine. The most symbolic use of nature in the novel is Elizabeth and the Gardiners&#x27; visit to Pemberley in Derbyshire, where Elizabeth becomes conscious of her love for Darcy. The story makes nature integral in the form of Old England. Elizabeth&#x27;s appreciation of the beauties of Derbyshire elevates Darcy in her and her relatives&#x27; opinion. Darcy&#x27;s gaze through the window works as a movie screen, projecting Elizabeth&#x27;s actions for him and the viewer. His participation in the English landscape is his redemption.

== Reception ==
=== Broadcast ===
Between 10 and 11 million people watched the original six-episode broadcast on BBC One on Sunday evenings from 24 September to 29 October 1995. The episodes were repeated each week on BBC Two. The final episode of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; had a market share of about 40 per cent in Britain, by which time eight foreign countries had bought the rights to the serial. 3.7 million Americans watched the first broadcast on the A&amp;E Network, which aired the serial in double episodes on three consecutive evenings beginning 14 January 1996.

===Home media and merchandise===
The serial was released on VHS in the UK in the week running up to the original transmission of the final episode. The entire first run of 12,000 copies of the double-video set sold out within two hours of release. 70,000 copies had been sold by the end of the first week of sales, increasing to 200,000 sold units within the first year of the original airing. A BBC spokeswoman called the initial sale results &quot;a huge phenomenon&quot;, as &quot;it is unheard of for a video to sell even half as well, especially when viewers are able to tape the episodes at home for free&quot;. The CD soundtrack was also popular, and 20,000 copies of an official making-of book were sold within days. The serial was released on DVD four times, initially in 2000, as a digitally remastered &quot;Tenth Anniversary Edition&quot; in September 2005, and in April 2007 as part of a &quot;Classic Drama DVD&quot; magazine collection. A high-definition transfer was produced from the original negatives and released as a Blu-ray in October 2008. The HD version has not been broadcast on television; the BBC refuses to broadcast anything shot in 16 mm in HD. The same restored version was released on DVD in March 2009. The Blu-ray was released on 14 April 2009.

A 2010 Remastered Edition and a 2014 Keepsake Edition have the same footage, time lengths, and format. The 2014 Keepsake Edition has improved colors. The 2010 Remastered Edition begins with piracy warnings and then movie begins playing. The 2014 Keepsake Edition begins with five compulsory previews which can only be bypassed by skipping forward through each individual preview. The second disc of the Keepsake set also begins with the same five compulsory previews. The 2014 Keepsake Edition has 50&quot; of new bonus materials plus the 1&#x27;45&quot; of bonus materials that was presented in the 2010 Remastered Edition. These bonus materials include interviews with the producer, screenwriter, director, musical composer, and cast members. The cast interviews in both editions do not include interviews with the two main characters, Colin Firth (Mr Darcy) and Jennifer Ehle (Elizabeth Bennet).

In 2010/2011 a restored 4k version was released to streaming and download services such as Amazon. A 4k physical media has yet to be released 

=== Critical reception ===
The critical response to &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; was overwhelmingly positive. Gerard Gilbert of &quot;The Independent&quot; recommended the opening episode of the serial one day before the British premiere, saying the television adaptation is &quot;probably as good as it [can get for a literary classic]. The casting in particular deserves a tilt at a BAFTA, Firth not being in the slightest bit soft and fluffy – and Jennifer Ehle showing the right brand of spirited intelligence as Elizabeth.&quot; He considered Benjamin Whitrow a &quot;real scene-stealer with his Mr Bennet&quot;, but was undecided about Alison Steadman&#x27;s portrayal of Mrs Bennet. Reviewing the first episode for the same newspaper on the day after transmission, Jim White praised Andrew Davies for &quot;injecting into the proceedings a pace and energy which at last provides a visual setting to do justice to the wit of the book. With everyone slinging themselves about at high speed (the dances, in a first for the genre, actually involve a bit of sweat), it looks like people are doing something you would never have suspected they did in Austen&#x27;s time: having fun.&quot;

A few days before the American premiere, Howard Rosenberg of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; considered the adaptation &quot;decidedly agreeable&quot; despite its incidental liberties with Austen&#x27;s novel, and named Elizabeth&#x27;s parents and Mr Collins as the main source of humour. John O&#x27;Connor of &quot;The New York Times&quot; lauded the serial as a &quot;splendid adaptation, with a remarkably faithful and sensitively nuanced script&quot;. He commented on Jennifer Ehle&#x27;s ability to make Elizabeth &quot;strikingly intelligent and authoritative without being overbearing&quot;, and noted how Firth &quot;brilliantly captures Mr Darcy&#x27;s snobbish pride while conveying, largely through intense stares, that he is falling in love despite himself&quot;. O&#x27;Connor praised Barbara Leigh-Hunt&#x27;s portrayal of Lady Catherine as &quot;a marvellously imperious witch&quot; and considered her scenes with David Bamber (Mr Collins) &quot;hilarious&quot;.

However, O&#x27;Connor remarked that American audiences might find the &quot;languorous walks across meadows&quot; and &quot;ornately choreographed dances&quot; of the British production too slow. In one of the most negative reviews, &quot;People Magazine&quot; considered the adaptation &quot;a good deal more thorough than necessary&quot; and &quot;not the best Austen on the suddenly crowded market&quot;. Although the reviewer thought Firth &quot;magnificent&quot;, he rebuked the casting of Jennifer Ehle as her oval face made her &quot;look like Anaïs Nin in period clothes, and that ain&#x27;t right&quot;. The official A&amp;E Network magazine summarised a year later that &quot;critics praised the lavish production, audiences adored it, and women everywhere swooned over Darcy. So much, in fact, that newspapers began to joke about &#x27;Darcy fever.&#x27;&quot; Commendation for the serial continued in the years following its original transmission.

=== Awards and nominations ===
&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; received BAFTA Television Award nominations for &quot;Best Drama Serial&quot;, &quot;Best Costume Design&quot;, and &quot;Best Make Up/Hair&quot; in 1996. Jennifer Ehle was honoured with a BAFTA for &quot;Best Actress&quot;, while Colin Firth and Benjamin Whitrow, nominated for &quot;Best Actor&quot;, lost to Robbie Coltrane of &quot;Cracker&quot;. Firth won the 1996 Broadcasting Press Guild Award for &quot;Best Actor&quot;, complemented by the same award for &quot;Best Drama Series/Serial&quot;. The serial was recognised in the United States with an Emmy for &quot;Outstanding Individual Achievement in Costume Design for a Miniseries or a Special&quot;, and was Emmy-nominated for its achievements as an &quot;Outstanding Miniseries&quot; as well as for choreography and writing. Among other awards and nominations, &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; received a Peabody Award, a Television Critics Association Award, and a Golden Satellite Award nomination for outstanding achievements as a serial.

==Influence and legacy==
As one of the BBC&#x27;s and A&amp;E&#x27;s most popular presentations ever, the serial was &quot;a cultural phenomenon, inspiring hundreds of newspaper articles and making the novel a commuter favourite&quot;. With the 1995 and 1996 films &quot;Persuasion&quot;, &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; and &quot;Emma&quot;, the serial was part of a wave of Jane Austen enthusiasm which caused the membership of the Jane Austen Society of North America to jump fifty per cent in 1996 and to over 4,000 members in the autumn of 1997. Some newspapers like &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; explained this &quot;Austen-mania&quot; as a commercial move of the television and film industry, whereas others attributed Austen&#x27;s popularity to escapism.

While Jennifer Ehle refused to capitalise on the success of the serial and joined the Royal Shakespeare Company at Stratford-upon-Avon, the role of Mr Darcy unexpectedly elevated Colin Firth to stardom. Although Firth did not mind being recognised as &quot;a romantic idol as a Darcy with smouldering sex appeal&quot; in a role that &quot;officially turned him into a heart-throb&quot;, he expressed the wish to not be associated with &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; forever and was reluctant to accept similar roles. He took on diverse roles and co-starred in productions such as &quot;The English Patient&quot; (1996), &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; (1998), &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot; (2001 – although this film is essentially an adaptation of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; in which Firth effectively reprises the role of Darcy), &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; (2003), &quot;Love Actually&quot; (2003) and &quot;Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason&quot; (2004).

&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; continued to be honoured years later. A 2000 poll of industry professionals conducted by the British Film Institute ranked the serial at 99 in the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes of the 20th century, which the BFI attributed to its &quot;managing to combine faithfulness to the novel with a freshness that appealed across the generations&quot;. &quot;Radio Times&quot; included the serial in their list of &quot;40 greatest TV programmes ever made&quot; in 2003. It was also named by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; as one of the 20 best miniseries of all time. In 2007, the UK Film Council declared &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; one of the television dramas that have become &quot;virtual brochures&quot; for British history and society. Lyme Hall, Cheshire, which had served as the exterior of Pemberley, experienced a tripling in its visitor numbers after the series&#x27; broadcast and is still a popular travel destination.

===Lake scene===

The adaptation is famous for a scene in its fourth episode where a fully dressed Darcy, having emerged from a swim in a lake at Pemberley, accidentally encounters Elizabeth. While many critics attributed the scene&#x27;s appeal to Firth&#x27;s sexual attractiveness, Andrew Davies thought that it unwittingly &quot;rerobed, not disrobed, Austen&quot;. When Davies wrote the scene (it was not part of Austen&#x27;s novel), he did not intend a sexual connection between Elizabeth and Darcy but to create &quot;an amusing moment in which Darcy tries to maintain his dignity while improperly dressed and sopping wet&quot;. The BBC opposed Davies&#x27;s plan to have Darcy naked but the producers discarded the alternative of using underpants as fatuous. According to Davies, Firth had &quot;a bit of the usual tension about getting [his] kit off&quot;, the scene was filmed with Firth in linen shirt, breeches and boots. A stuntman, who appears in midair in a very brief shot, was hired because of the risk of infection with Weil&#x27;s disease at Lyme Park. A short underwater segment was filmed separately with Firth in a tank at Ealing Studios in west London.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; declared the lake scene &quot;one of the most unforgettable moments in British TV history&quot;. The sequence also appeared in Channel 4&#x27;s Top 100 TV Moments in 1999, between the controversial programme &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; and the Gulf War. &quot;The New York Times&quot; compared the scene to Marlon Brando shouting &quot;Stella!&quot; in his undershirt in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; and Firth&#x27;s projects began alluding to it – screenwriter-director Richard Curtis added in-joke moments of Firth&#x27;s characters falling into the water to &quot;Love Actually&quot; and &quot;Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason&quot;, and Firth&#x27;s character from the 2007 film &quot;St Trinian&#x27;s&quot; emerges from a fountain in a soaking wet shirt before meeting up with an old love. The creators of the 2008 ITV production &quot;Lost in Austen&quot; emulated the lake scene in their &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; through their contemporary heroine who cajoles Darcy into recreating the moment.

Cheryl L. Nixon suggested in &quot;Jane Austen in Hollywood&quot; that Darcy&#x27;s dive is a &quot;revelation of his emotional capabilities&quot;, expressing a &quot;Romantic bond with nature, a celebration of his home where he can &#x27;strip down&#x27; to his essential self, a cleansing of social prejudices from his mind, or ... a rebirth of his love for Elizabeth&quot;. Linda Troost and Sayre Greenfield wrote that the scene &quot;tells us more about our current decade&#x27;s obsession with physical perfection and acceptance of gratuitous nudity than it does about Austen&#x27;s Darcy, but the image carves a new facet into the text&quot;.

===Bridget Jones===
The fictional journalist Bridget Jones (in reality Helen Fielding of &quot;The Independent&quot;) wrote of her love of the serial in the paper&#x27;s &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot; column during the original British broadcast, mentioning her &quot;simple human need for Darcy to get off with Elizabeth&quot; and regarding the couple as her &quot;chosen representatives in the field of shagging, or rather courtship&quot;. Fielding loosely reworked the plot of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; in her 1996 novel of the column, naming Bridget&#x27;s uptight love interest &quot;Mark Darcy&quot; and describing him exactly like Colin Firth. Following a first meeting with Firth during his filming of &quot;Fever Pitch&quot; in 1996, Fielding asked Firth to collaborate in what would become a multi-page interview between Bridget Jones and Firth in her 1999 sequel novel, &quot;The Edge of Reason&quot;. Conducting the real interview with Firth in Rome, Fielding lapsed into Bridget Jones mode and obsessed over Darcy in his wet shirt for the fictional interview. Firth participated in the editing of what critics called &quot;one of the funniest sequences in the diary&#x27;s sequel&quot;. Both novels make various other references to the BBC serial.

Andrew Davies collaborated on the screenplays for the 2001 and 2004 &quot;Bridget Jones&quot; films, in which Crispin Bonham-Carter (Mr Bingley) and Lucy Robinson (Mrs Hurst) appeared in minor roles. The self-referential in-joke between the projects convinced Colin Firth to accept the role of Mark Darcy, as it gave him an opportunity to ridicule and liberate himself from his &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; character. Film critic James Berardinelli would later state that Firth &quot;plays this part [of Mark Darcy] exactly as he played the earlier role, making it evident that the two Darcys are essentially the same&quot;. The producers never found a way to incorporate the Jones-Firth interview in the second film but shot a spoof interview with Firth as himself and Renée Zellweger staying in character as Bridget Jones after a day&#x27;s wrap. The scene, which extended Bridget&#x27;s Darcy obsession to cover Firth&#x27;s lake scene in &quot;Love Actually&quot;, is available as a bonus feature on the DVD.

For almost a decade, the 1995 TV serial was considered &quot;so dominant, so universally adored, [that] it has lingered in the public consciousness as a cinematic standard&quot;. Comparing six &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; adaptations in 2005, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; gave 9/10 to the 1995 serial (&quot;what may be the ultimate adaptation&quot;) and the 2005 film adaptation, leaving the other adaptations such as the 1940 film behind with six or fewer points. The 2005 film was &quot;obviously [not as] daring or revisionist&quot; as the 1995 adaptation but the youth of the film&#x27;s leads, Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen, was mentioned favourably over the 1995 cast, as Jennifer Ehle had formerly been &quot;a little too &#x27;heavy&#x27; for the role&quot;. The president of the Jane Austen Society of North America noted in an otherwise positive review that the casting of the 2005 leads was &quot;arguably a little more callow than Firth and Ehle&quot; and that &quot;Knightley is better looking than Lizzy should strictly be&quot;. The critical reception of Macfadyen&#x27;s Darcy, whose casting had proven difficult because &quot;Colin Firth cast a very long shadow&quot;, ranged from praise through pleasant surprise to dislike. Several critics did not observe any significant impact of Macfadyen&#x27;s Darcy in the following years. Garth Pearce of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; noted in 2007 that &quot;Colin Firth will forever be remembered as the perfect Mr Darcy&quot;, and Gene Seymour stated in a 2008 &quot;Newsday&quot; article that Firth was &quot;&#x27;universally acknowledged&#x27; as the definitive Mr Darcy&quot;.

<doc id="1008286" wikidata="Q260479" url="?curid=1008286" title="Holzkirchen, Upper Bavaria">
<text>Holzkirchen is a market town in Bavaria, Germany. With a population of over 16,000 (2008) it is the largest town in the Miesbach district.

Holzkirchen is located on the Alpenvorland in the county of Miesbach. 

==History==
Holzkirchen was established as a Markt in the 13th century.

Holzkirchen was the location of one of the main transmitting stations for Radio Free Europe. Transmissions started in 1951 and provided the people of Eastern Europe with news from Western Europe. The transmitters had a strength of up to 135 Kilowatts and was upgraded to 150 Kilowatts in 1967. The relay transmitters were decommissioned in 1990. Final decommissioning of the Holzkirchen array was in 2004. 
There were claims that the high-powered transmissions caused illnesses locally . There were also claims that it was so strong that locals could hear the radio programmes through their faucets . Subsequent to the relocation of RFE studios from Munich to Prague, the medium wave transmitter was shut down in 2001, following which the short wave transmissions continued on reduced power. The final transmissions were made in 2005, after which the transmission equipment was packed up to be sent to the Philippines and the masts were scrapped.

Nowadays Holzkirchen is well known as a location for pharmaceutical research and production. The European center of Sandoz and HEXAL are located in the industrial zone.

== Public transport ==
=== Trains ===
The traffic hub Holzkirchen has with the railway line Munich–Holzkirchen and the railway line Munich East–Deisenhofen a good connection to Munich (including an S-Bahn connection (S3), which departs every 20 minutes). The Railway Line Holzkirchen–Lenggries (German) and the connection towards Schliersee are operated once an hour by the Bayerischen Oberlandbahn (BOB) and give direct connections to Tegernsee, Lenggries und Bayrischzell. On the railway line called Mangfallbahn to Rosenheim, services have been operated once an hour since December 2013 by the company called &#x27;Meridian&#x27;, which is a subsidiary of Transdev Germany (before Meridian, the railway line was operated by the DB Regio AG) via Bad Aibling. Mondays to Fridays Meridian operates nine services, which connect Rosenheim and Munich Central Station via Holzkirchen.
=== Buses ===
The following routes of the Oberbayernbus and the MVV Buses stop at the station or at the Zentraler Omnibus-Bahnhof (ZOB).

<doc id="1008287" wikidata="Q599892" url="?curid=1008287" title="Bowfell">
<text>Bowfell (named &quot;Bow Fell&quot; on Ordnance Survey maps) is a pyramid-shaped mountain lying at the heart of the English Lake District, in the Southern Fells area. It is the sixth-highest mountain in the Lake District and one of the most popular of the Lake District fells for walkers. It is listed in Alfred Wainwright&#x27;s &#x27;best half dozen&#x27; Lake District fells.

==Topography==
The Southern Fells include the highest ground in England, a horseshoe which begins with Scafell and Scafell Pike in the west and then curves around the north of Upper Eskdale to take in Great End, Esk Pike, Bowfell and Crinkle Crags.

In addition to Eskdale, Bowfell has a footing in two other well known valleys. It stands at the head of Great Langdale — its east ridge dividing the two branches of Mickleden and Oxendale — while to the north is the Langstrath branch of Borrowdale. From all of these valleys Bowfell presents a striking profile with a conical top resting upon a wider summit plateau.

To the north-west of Bowfell the main ridge drops to the depression of Ore Gap, named after its reddish soil, rich in haematite. Below the col on the northern side is Angle Tarn. This round waterbody occupies a corrie beneath Hanging Knotts, small trout lurking in its depths. Its outflow is a tributary of the Langstrath Beck, making for Stonethwaite. To the south of Ore Gap runs Yeastyrigg Gill, the main headwater of Lingcove Beck, flowing into the fastness of upper Eskdale. Beyond the Gap the ridge makes the stony three-tiered climb to the white-rocked summit of Esk Pike.

Southward of Bowfell the ridge falls steeply to Three Tarns, the col separating it from Crinkle Crags. The depression takes its name from a number of small pools, often two, but sometimes more after rain. Busco Sike flowing to the east is the longest feeder of Oxendale Beck in Great Langdale.

Bowfell sends out two subsidiary ridges to the east. The Band is a descending rigg starting from the southern end of the summit plateau. It is this ridge which divides Oxendale from Mickleden, making straight for Stool End Farm on the valley floor. The Band has a minor top about halfway down named White Stones, although most guidebooks do not consider it notable. The second ridge begins at the northern end of the summit plateau and crosses Rossett Hause, a sharp depression at the head of Rossett Gill, to make for Rossett Pike. The continuation of this ridge provides the connection to the Central Fells, forming the northern wall of Great Langdale as it crosses Martcrag Moor, bound for the Langdale Pikes.

==Geology==
The predominant rocks on Bowfell are the volcaniclastic sandstones of the Seathwaite Fell Formation, with interbeds of andesite outcropping near the summit. The pebbly sandstone and breccias of the Pavey Ark Member also cross the fell.

==Summit==
The summit area is a ridge running north–south with the final pyramid near the south-west corner and crags on three sides. The southern face is formed by Bowfell Links, a wall of rock scarred by nine vertical gullies and with corresponding tongues of scree at its foot, all of which are loose rock channels. The eastern face includes Flat Crag, Cambridge Crag and the Bowfell Buttress, the latter two providing good climbing. Flat Crag includes the Great Slab, a tilted sheet of rock. At the base of Great Slab a spring gushes forth from the bare rock: Wainwright claims, &quot;And no water anywhere else tastes better.&quot; Below these faces runs the Climber&#x27;s Traverse, a narrow path providing a high-level walking route to the summit from the highest point of The Band. This largely horizontal line contours around beneath many of Bowfell&#x27;s steeper crags, finally reaching the summit via a rocky route known as the River of Boulders, running parallel to the Great Slab. Finally on the north- east corner of the summit ridge is Hanging Knotts, a complex series of faces and outcrops looking down upon Angle Tarn.

The highest point carries not so much a cairn as a rearrangement of some loose rock at the apex of the pyramid. Every major group of fells in Lakeland is seen from this vantage-point — the Helvellyn range from end to end and the Langdale Pikes across Langdale — according to Wainwright, the piece of the view is Scafell Pike towering above Eskdale.
*Panorama

==Ascents==
The Band provides the most popular means of ascent. Other routes from Langdale climb via Rossett Gill and Three Tarns. Bowfell can be reached from Stonethwaite via Angle Tarn although the way is long. Equally time-consuming although perhaps more picturesque is the long march up Eskdale from Brotherikeld, gaining the ridge at either Ore Gap or Three Tarns. Indirect climbs can also be made via Crinkle Crags, Esk Pike or Rossett Pike. The summit can also be reached from the top of Wrynose Pass by following the Right of Way starting close to the Three Shire Stone and heading in a northwesterly direction. The route takes in the summits of Cold Pike and Long Top.

<text>Bastos is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. The population is 20,953 (2020 est.) in an area of 172 km2.

==History==
The name originated from Henrique Bastos, who owned a farm in the area. And it was these same lands that the foundation of the city occurred on June 18, 1928, by Senjiro Hatanaka, sent by the Japanese government to look for land to receive the waves of Japanese immigrants.

The municipality was created by state law in 1944.
After cycles of crops such as coffee, cotton, sericulture, from 1957, the council found its economic vocation: the laying poultry. The city has the largest flock of laying hens in the country and thus is the municipality with the highest production of eggs from Brazil, so the self-titling of &quot;capital of the egg.&quot; Bastos is also the headquarters of the Brazilian city of the Egg Festival. This festival brings together not only an exhibition of innovations and products used in the poultry industry, as well as concerts and entertainment for the general population and the region of Bastos.

<doc id="1008296" wikidata="Q650500" url="?curid=1008296" title="Batatais">
<text>Batatais is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil.

==History==
The settlement became a town and an independent municipality on March 14, 1839, when it was separated from Franca. It became a city in 1875. Washington Luís, president of Brazil around 1929, was the city mayor in 1899.

==Geography==
The city has an area of . The elevation is 862 m. The city is in Brazil&#x27;s sugarcane belt.

== Population ==

In 2020 the population is about 62,980. The population is mostly formed by Italian-Brazilians. There is commemorated the &quot;San Gennaro Party&quot; that is an example of culture predominance.

== Theories on the origin of the name ==
There are at least four theories for the meaning of the name &quot;Batatais&quot;: 
*The most accepted one is based on historical reports, linked to the Native Americans that lived there and their agricultural activity. The Bandeirantes may have found a large culture of purple sweet potatoes (Batatais sounds like &quot;Batatas&quot;, &quot;potatoes&quot;).
*Another version came from the Native American language spoken there, and the name came from the word &quot;BAITATA&quot;, which means according to some experts &quot;river running through the rocks&quot;, meaning the waterfalls that exists there.
*A third version also from the Native American language spoken there says that the name came from the word &quot;MBOITATA&quot;, snake of fire, which on the native belief was the god that protects the field from fires. This version can be also verified due to some small gas fields that exists around the city, which may generate fireballs due to the heat occasionally. 
*Some recent studies also brings another possible version: Batatais or Batatal was an expression used by the old miners to describe the place where gold can be found at the surface. As this region was part of the old way to the Goias mines, it is possible that the city was a rest place for the travelers.

<doc id="1008301" wikidata="Q1799543" url="?curid=1008301" title="Labret">
<text>A labret is a form of body piercing. Taken literally, it is any type of adornment that is attached to the lip (labrum). However, the term usually refers to a piercing that is below the bottom lip, above the chin. It is sometimes referred to as a &quot;tongue pillar&quot; or a &quot;soul patch piercing&quot;.

==Pronunciation==

The traditional pronunciation of &quot;labret&quot; in anthropology is . It derives from the Latin &quot;labrum&quot; &quot;lip&quot; and the diminutive suffix &quot;-et.&quot; However, many in the body-piercing industry give it the pseudo-French pronunciation , though the French word is in fact borrowed from the English.

==Anthropology==
The labret was a traditional piercing among the American Northwest Coast Indians, where it was related to status:

&quot;access to labrets. After 3,000 BP, a divergence in labret wear in north and south coasts. In the north from 1500 - 3500 BP, more labrets worn by males. After 1500 BP, labrets worn by females. In the south, between 2000 - 3500 BP, worn by males and females, but from 2000 BP on, labrets generally disappear and are replaced by cranial deformation by free males and females of whatever class (e.g. elite or commoner). So, for 4,000 years on the northwest coast, it was important to distinguish certain individuals in a very direct manner; either by cranial deformation or by labret wear. Gender and geographical region may also be identified by these methods.&quot;

When a mask was being made to represent someone of high status, that mask would likewise have a labret.
The wearing of labrets was widely observed among Tlingit women of high status at the time of European and American arrivals in Southeast Alaska. The Russian term for the Tlingit, &quot;Koloshi&quot;, derived from an Alutiiq word for labret.

Based on analysis of the history and social context of the labret (lip plug) on the Northwest Coast of British Columbia over the last 5,000 years, Marina LaSalle asserts that &quot;while simple correlations of the labret with &#x27;status&#x27; and &#x27;gender&#x27; are not wrong, nonetheless they betray the complexity of body ornamentation which, though manifested materially, is highly contextual&quot; and that &quot;the labret is a symbol and expression of social identity that continues to hold significant meaning for the descendants of this heritage.&quot;

==Types of labret piercings==
In contemporary styles, there are several different labret variations based on precisely where the piercing is positioned on the lower lip. These include a vertical labret (pierced with a curved barbell through the top of the lower lip rather than in front of the lip tissue), snake bites (dual piercings close together reminiscent of fangs), spiderbites (dual piercings very close together on the same side of the face), and a lowbret, which is placed as low as possible toward the chin.
The initial piercing is usually done at 1.2, 1.6 or 2.0 mm diameter. After initial healing, the piercing can be (gradually) further stretched. Some people choose to stretch to sizes over 10 mm, and the jewelry worn at these larger sizes is usually a round or oval &#x27;labret plug&#x27;.

<doc id="1008305" wikidata="Q132208" url="?curid=1008305" title="Joe Johnson (basketball)">
<text>Joe Marcus Johnson (born June 29, 1981) is an American former professional basketball player. Nicknamed &quot;Iso Joe&quot;, he played college basketball for the Arkansas Razorbacks. After two years with Arkansas, he declared for the 2001 NBA draft where he was drafted 10th overall by the Boston Celtics.

Johnson was a seven-time NBA All-Star and also played for the Phoenix Suns, Atlanta Hawks, Brooklyn Nets, Miami Heat, Utah Jazz and Houston Rockets, while also representing the United States national team. While playing for the Hawks, he earned the nickname &quot;Iso Joe&quot; for his skills on isolation plays. He is one of 50 NBA players to score 20,000 career points.

==Early life==
Born in Little Rock, Arkansas, Johnson was a member of the William E. Thrasher Boys &amp; Girls Club as a youngster and attended Little Rock Central High School, a school that had produced other athletes including Baseball Hall of Famers Brooks Robinson and Bill Dickey, as well as football player Fred Williams and collegiate football coach Houston Nutt. His senior season at Central, Johnson led the Tigers to their 18th state championship and was named Arkansas Mr. Basketball.

==College career==
In his freshman season at Arkansas in 1999–2000, Johnson was named to the SEC All-Freshman team and SEC All-Tournament team after averaging 16.0 points, 5.7 rebounds, 2.2 assists and 2.0 steals per game. Johnson led Arkansas to the 2000 SEC men&#x27;s basketball tournament championship.

In his sophomore season in 2000–01, Johnson was named to the All-SEC second team and SEC All-Tournament team, while also receiving honorable mention All-American honors. In 30 games, he averaged 14.2 points, 6.4 rebounds, 2.6 assists and 1.4 steals per game.

==Professional career==

===Boston Celtics (2001–2002)===
Following his sophomore season at Arkansas, Johnson declared for the 2001 NBA draft where he went on to be selected with the 10th overall pick by the Boston Celtics. Through the first half of the 2001–02 season, Johnson played 48 games for the Celtics and made 33 starts, as he averaged 6.3 points, 2.9 rebounds and 1.5 assists per game. He was later traded to the Phoenix Suns on February 20, 2002, along with Randy Brown, Milt Palacio and a first-round pick in exchange for Rodney Rogers and Tony Delk.

===Phoenix Suns (2002–2005)===
Johnson became a force with Phoenix as he averaged 14.0 points per game in his three and a half seasons with the Suns, becoming a clutch three-point shooter as he averaged 39.3% from the three-point arc during his tenure with the Suns.

During the 2004–05 campaign, Johnson and the Suns posted a 62–20 record. Johnson&#x27;s three point accuracy improved dramatically between 2004 and 2005, shooting 30.5% on threes in 2004 and 47.8% in 2005, and shooting .556 in the 2005 playoffs. In the 2005 NBA playoffs, Johnson required surgery to repair a left orbital bone fracture sustained following a dunk attempt against the Dallas Mavericks in the second round. Johnson missed the remainder of the series against the Mavericks as well as the first two games of the Western Conference Finals against the San Antonio Spurs. When he returned, Johnson wore a face mask for protection. The Suns fell to the eventual NBA champion Spurs, 4 games to 1.

===Atlanta Hawks (2005–2012)===

In the summer of 2005, Johnson became a highly touted restricted free agent and expressed a desire to leave the Suns to assume a larger role on the Atlanta Hawks. Johnson grew upset with Phoenix&#x27;s initial offers to re-sign him feeling they were well below his market value. This rift eventually led to Johnson requesting the Suns not match Atlanta&#x27;s $70 million offer. On August 19, 2005, a deal was finalized and Johnson was involved in a sign-and-trade deal with the Hawks for future teammate Boris Diaw and two future first-round draft picks.

In his first season as a Hawk, Johnson led Atlanta in several categories: points (20.2 per game), assists (6.5), steals (1.26), three-point field goals made (128) and minutes (40.7). He was one of only five players in the league to average at least 20 points and six assists in the 2005–06 season, along with Allen Iverson, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James and Gilbert Arenas. Johnson was also the only Hawk to play in all 82 games in 2005–06.

Johnson scored a career-high 42 points on March 7, 2006, against the Golden State Warriors and recorded a career-high 17 assists on March 13, 2006, against the Milwaukee Bucks. He recorded his first career triple-double on February 1, 2006, with 15 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists against the Charlotte Bobcats.

Johnson continued his development in the 2006–07 season, when he averaged 25.0 points, 4.4 assists, 4.2 rebounds and 1.1 steals per game. His scoring average ranked ninth in the league. Johnson also shot a career-best 47.1% from the field and was subsequently named to the 2007 Eastern Conference All-Star team, replacing the injured Jason Kidd.

In 2008, Johnson made the 2008 All-Star Game as a reserve. He also was named Eastern Conference Player of the Month twice during the season. Johnson averaged 21.7 points per game on the season, leading the Hawks to their first playoff appearance in nine years. In Game 4 of the Hawks&#x27; first-round matchup against the Boston Celtics, Johnson scored 35 points, including 20 in the 4th quarter, leading the Hawks to a 97–92 victory.

Despite finishing with the worst record (37–45) among the 2008 NBA Playoffs contingent, the Hawks played very even with the heavily favored and eventual NBA champion Boston Celtics, taking the Eastern Conference No. 1 seed all the way to Game 7. The year marked a turning of the page for the Atlanta franchise, once considered among the least successful in pro sports.

The following year, Johnson registered his second career triple-double on December 23, 2008, in a Hawks win against the Oklahoma City Thunder, with 20 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists. He eclipsed the 10,000-point plateau for his career with his first basket during a 110–107 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks on January 31, 2009, a bank shot assisted by Marvin Williams. On March 19, 2010, Johnson hit a game-winning buzzer beater in overtime against the Charlotte Bobcats.

On July 8, 2010, Johnson re-signed with the Hawks to a six-year, $123.7 million contract, which, at the time, made him the NBA&#x27;s highest-paid player. The signing occurred during one of the most star-studded free agency summers in league history, highlighted by LeBron James’&quot;Decision&quot; TV special. Among others who signed high-profile deals were Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade, Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire, Paul Pierce, Ray Allen and Dirk Nowitzki.

===Brooklyn Nets (2012–2016)===
On July 11, 2012, Johnson was traded to the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for Jordan Farmar, Anthony Morrow, Jordan Williams, Johan Petro, DeShawn Stevenson and a 2013 first round draft pick. After a slow start to the 2012–13 season, Johnson began to pick up his play in December, with a 32-point game against the Golden State Warriors on December 7 and a game-winning buzzer beater in double overtime against the Detroit Pistons on December 14. After scoring 33 points in a road win over the Oklahoma City Thunder on January 2, he hit another game winner in double overtime two days later to beat the Washington Wizards. In a 113–111 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks on February 19, Johnson made the game-tying three-pointer with just under three seconds to go in regulation and went on to hit the game-winning pull-up jump shot in overtime. With this win, the Nets snapped a thirteen-game losing streak against the Bucks. The next game the Nets played, Johnson injured his left heel and was forced to miss three games. He made his return on March 1 against the Dallas Mavericks.

On November 15, 2013, Johnson made his first game-winning basket of the season against the Phoenix Suns as he went in for a layup to give the Nets their first road win of the 2013–14 season. On December 16, 2013, Johnson recorded a career-high 10 three-pointers in a 130–94 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. In the third quarter, Johnson scored 29 points on 10-of-13 shooting from the field including 8-of-10 three-pointers. On January 2, 2014, after the Nets were down by sixteen points, Johnson made his second game-winning basket of the season to lead the Nets to a 95–93 win to give Oklahoma City Thunder its second home loss of the season. Johnson later earned his seventh All-Star game selection.

In just the second game of the 2014–15 season on November 1, Johnson scored a season-high 34 points on 14-of-23 shooting to help the Nets defeat the Detroit Pistons, 102–90. On February 25, in a game against the New Orleans Pelicans, he became just the seventh player in NBA history to record 18,000 career points and 1,600 career three-pointers made.

On November 14, 2015, in a loss to the Golden State Warriors, Johnson appeared in his 1,072nd NBA regular season game, matching Michael Jordan for 77th on the all-time list. On November 28, in a loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers, he extended his streak of making at least one field goal to 900 regular season games, the longest active streak. He extended that streak to 919 games on January 6, 2016, in a loss to the Toronto Raptors. Three days later, he hit two three-pointers against the Detroit Pistons, thus surpassing Peja Stojaković for 11th on the career three-pointers list. On January 24, in a win over the Oklahoma City Thunder, he became the 31st player in NBA history to reach 40,000 minutes. On February 5, he recorded season highs of 27 points and 11 assists in a 128–119 win over the Sacramento Kings. On February 8, he recorded 12 points and 8 assists against the Denver Nuggets, and hit a buzzer-beating three-pointer to lift the Nets to a 105–104 win. In that game, he passed Scottie Pippen for 52nd place on the NBA&#x27;s all-time scoring list. In the following game two days later, Johnson failed to score against the Memphis Grizzlies, going scoreless in a regular season game for the first time since December 6, 2003, ending the NBA&#x27;s longest active streak with at least one field goal. He had a basket in 937 straight games. On February 25, Johnson was waived by the Nets in a buyout agreement.

===Miami Heat (2016)===
On February 27, 2016, Johnson signed with the Miami Heat.

===Utah Jazz (2016–2018)===
On July 8, 2016, Johnson signed a two-year, $22 million contract with the Utah Jazz. He joined the Jazz with the intention being to come off the bench behind Gordon Hayward.

He made his debut for the Jazz in their season opener on October 25, scoring a team-high 29 points in a 113–104 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers. With Hayward&#x27;s return to line-up on November 6 to face the New York Knicks, Johnson came off the bench for the first time since December 9, 2003. On February 8, 2017, Johnson highlighted a 27-point performance with six three-pointers on eight attempts in a 127–94 win over the New Orleans Pelicans. On April 15, 2017, Johnson scored a team-high 21 points off the bench and hit a game-winning floater at the buzzer to give the Jazz a 97–95 win over the Los Angeles Clippers in Game 1 of their first-round playoff series. Eight days later in Game 4, Johnson again paced the Jazz with 28 points off the bench to give them a 105–98 victory and tie the series with the Clippers at 2–2. The Jazz went on to eliminate the Clippers with a 104–91 victory in Game 7, closing out the first-round series 4–3 to earn the franchise&#x27;s first postseason series victory since 2010.

Johnson missed 21 games early in the 2017–18 season while dealing with a right wrist injury.

He also made his lone shot in that appearance, making him the second player along with Dirk Nowitzki to score a basket with the same team at the age of 20 and at the age of 40. His sole appearance for the Celtics in 2021 would be the final appearance of his NBA career. It was his first NBA action in 1,669 days, with his last appearance before that point coming in the 2018 NBA playoffs with the Rockets on May 28, 2018.

<doc id="1008314" wikidata="Q7056797" url="?curid=1008314" title="North Southwark and Bermondsey (UK Parliament constituency)">
<text>North Southwark and Bermondsey was a parliamentary constituency which returned one Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The constituency was created for the 1997 general election.

Minor boundary changes occurred for the 2010 general election; the constituency was renamed Bermondsey and Old Southwark.

==Boundaries==

The London Borough of Southwark wards of Abbey, Bricklayers, Browning, Burgess, Cathedral, Chaucer, Dockyard, Newington, Riverside, and Rotherhithe.

As the name suggests, the seat incorporated large parts of the old Metropolitan Borough of Bermondsey and Metropolitan Borough of Southwark, within the modern London Borough of Southwark (which is much larger than historic Southwark).

The seat was created in 1997 and was primarily the successor seat to the old Southwark &amp; Bermondsey constituency which existed from 1983 until 1997. Before that the core of the seat was the Bermondsey constituency in which incarnation a notorious by-election took place in 1983.

For the 2010 general election it was replaced by a renamed but barely altered Bermondsey and Old Southwark.

==History==
For the detailed history of the equivalent constituency prior to 1997, see Southwark and Bermondsey.

Southwark North and Bermondsey was unusual for an Inner London constituency in that the area was represented by a Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament (MP) for over twenty-five years. Many commentators felt that this unusual state of affairs was entirely down to the circumstances of the 1983 Bermondsey by-election. Prior to this, the seat had a long history of representation by Labour MPs, but in the early 1980s the local Labour Party was dominated by the far left. The sitting MP Bob Mellish was directly opposed to their approach and accepted an invitation to sit on the board directing the regeneration of London Docklands.

Bermondsey Constituency Labour Party selected its secretary Peter Tatchell. A magazine article he had written about direct action was used by a Social Democrat MP to embarrass Labour Party leader Michael Foot who impetuously denounced Tatchell and stated that he would not be endorsed, but the party was forced to accept him when Mellish resigned from the House of Commons, triggering a by-election widely regarded as one of the dirtiest in history. Tatchell came in for immense local and national vilification and in a shock result the Liberal candidate Simon Hughes established that his party had the best chance of the other candidates, and monopolised the anti-Tatchell vote.

Hughes continued to win the seat, at times being the only Liberal Democrat MP in London. The Labour Party had a strong desire to re-take the seat, which was often predicted to change hands on a uniform swing occurring in elections. However Hughes repeatedly defied the national trend and held the seat. On one memorable occasion, during the results of the 1997 general election he was told on air by Jonathan Dimbleby that Labour had gained the seat, only for the result to re-elect Hughes with a good majority.

In local elections, the London Borough of Southwark was run by the Liberal Democrats until 2010, with Conservative support as the Lib Dems did not have a majority. Labour won majority control of the council in the May 2010 elections. Following Boundary Commission changes to both sides of the Thames, it altered slightly in shape, but changed its name to Bermondsey and Old Southwark. At the 2015 general election, Labour in the person of Neil Coyle finally re-gained the seat in a shock result, bringing Simon Hughes&#x27;s 32-year parliamentary career to an abrupt end.

== Members of Parliament ==

The seat&#x27;s only MP was Simon Hughes, who sat for the various Bermondsey seats since a by-election in 1983 until his defeat in 2015, as a Liberal MP until 1988 and as a Liberal Democrat after that.

<doc id="1008323" wikidata="Q881739" url="?curid=1008323" title="Blarney Castle">
<text>Blarney Castle () is a medieval stronghold in Blarney, a town in Cork, Ireland. Though earlier fortifications were built on the same spot, the current keep was built by the MacCarthy of Muskerry dynasty, a cadet branch of the Kings of Desmond, and dates from 1446. The Blarney Stone is among the machicolations of the castle.

==History==
===Development===
The castle originally dates from before 1200, when a timber house was believed to have been built on the site, although no evidence remains of this. Around 1210 this was replaced by a stone fortification. It was destroyed in 1446 but subsequently rebuilt by Cormac Láidir MacCarthy, Lord of Muscry, who also built castles at Kilcrea and Carrignamuck.

The castle was besieged during the Irish Confederate Wars and was seized in 1646 by Parliamentarian forces under Lord Broghill. However, after the Restoration, the castle was restored to Donough MacCarty, who was made 1st Earl of Clancarty.

During the Williamite War in Ireland in the 1690s, the 4th Earl of Clancarty (also named Donough MacCarty) was captured, and his lands (including Blarney Castle) were confiscated by the Williamites.

The castle was sold and changed hands several times — Sir Richard Pyne, the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, owned it briefly — before being purchased in the early 18th century by Sir James Jeffreys, governor of Cork City.

===Blarney House===

Members of the Jefferyes family later built a large house near the 15th-century keep. This house was destroyed by fire, and in 1874 a replacement mansion, known as Blarney House, was built overlooking the nearby lake. The house was built in a Scottish baronial style by John Lanyon of Lanyon, Lynn and Lanyon architects.

In the mid-19th century, the Jefferyes and Colthurst families were joined by marriage, and the Colthurst family still occupies the demesne. In May 2008, the present estate owner, Sir Charles St John Colthurst, Baronet, succeeded in a court action to eject a man who had lived on his land for 44 years. The man&#x27;s great-grandfather had been the first to occupy the estate cottage.

==Tourism==
Blarney Castle is now a partial ruin with some accessible rooms and battlements. At the top of the castle lies the Stone of Eloquence, better known as the Blarney Stone. Tourists visiting the castle may hang upside-down over a sheer drop to kiss the stone, which is said to give the gift of eloquence. There are many versions of the origin of the stone, including a claim that it was the Lia Fáil — a numinous stone upon which Irish kings were crowned.

Surrounding the castle are extensive gardens. There are paths touring the grounds, with signs pointing out the various attractions such as several natural rock formations with fanciful names such as &quot;Druid&#x27;s Circle&quot;, &quot;Witch&#x27;s Cave&quot; and the &quot;Wishing Steps&quot;. The grounds include a poison garden with numerous poisonous plants, including wolfsbane, mandrake, ricinus, opium poppies and cannabis. Blarney House is also open to the public.

<text>A play-by-post role-playing game (or sim) is an online text-based role-playing game in which players interact with each other and a predefined environment via text. It is a subset of the online role-playing community which caters to both gamers and creative writers. Play-by-post games may be based on other role-playing games, non-game fiction including books, television and movies, or original settings. This activity is closely related to both interactive fiction and collaborative writing. Compared to other roleplaying game formats, this type tends to have the loosest rulesets.

==History==
Play-by-post roleplaying has its origins on the large computer networks and bulletin board systems of major universities in the United States in the 1980s. It drew heavily upon the traditions of fanzines and off-line role-playing games. The introduction of IRC enabled users to engage in real-time chat-based role-playing and resulted in the establishment of open communities.

Development of forum hosting software and browser-based chat services such as AOL and Yahoo Chat increased the availability of these mediums to the public and improved accessibility to the general public.

==Rules==

Unlike other forms of online role-playing games such as MUDs or MMORPGs, the events in play-by-post games are rarely handled by software and instead rely on participants or moderators to make decisions or improvise. Players create their own characters and descriptions of events and their surroundings during play. Results of combat, which may include Player versus player encounters, may be determined by chance through dice rolls or software designed to provide a random result. The results of random chance may need to be provided to the players in order to avoid disputes that may be a result of cheating or favoritism. Alternatively a forum may be diceless and rely on cooperation among players to agree on outcomes of events and thus forgo the use of randomisers.

In the latter case, combat and other measures are handled by requiring players to avoid detailing the results of their actions, and thus leave an opening for a response by other involved players. Consider the following possible post from a character named Bob attacking Joe:


This post makes the assumption that Joe takes no further action to avoid the attack from Bob and that he will drop as a result. These types of actions are often called &quot;autohits&quot; as they &quot;automatically hit&quot; without allowing for a response by the affected character, and there may be rules against such actions (commonly referred to as the &#x27;no power playing&#x27; rule). Alternatively, Bob may be required to write something like the following:


This allows Joe to respond to the action without contradicting the post.

Depending on the rules established on the forum, role-playing and story can be pushed forward through moderation by a gamemaster, specific rules (often existing role-playing game systems), or by mutual agreement between players.

Some games allow members of any writing proficiency to join, while others may require members to provide a sample of writing for review before allowing participation. In addition, a minimum word-count for each post may be required in order to encourage more detailed writing. Forums that cater to all levels of role-playing may have specific sections for various difficulty levels.

==Characters==

In general, each player plays and develops his or her own character. Characters may be original creations of the player, or may be based on a character taken from canon if the setting and rules provide this option. Each community may have its own rules regarding the process of character creation and either allow characters to be liberally created and used with minimal review, or require characters to undergo a review process in which administrators examine the character application and decide whether to approve or reject the application.

In many cases, characters are regarded as belonging to the players who created them, and others are not allowed to make drastic changes to them without the creator&#x27;s prior consent (referred to as god-modding).

In addition to standard characters, games may also incorporate non-player characters (NPCs). Some NPCs have recurring roles, while others appear only briefly to aid in the writing of a scene. The use and control of NPCs varies widely among role-playing games.

==Setting==

Games vary in the degree to which the setting is established; some go as far as to include a virtual &quot;world&quot; to roleplay in, while others allow players to improvise the setting as they progress. Settings may be derived from novels, TV shows or movies (often resulting in collaborative fan-fiction) or may be original and unique to the game.

==Style==
Play-by-post games are frequently written in the third person perspective due to the fact that multiple players must share each scene, each with his or her character as the focus of attention. Common online game terms such as &quot;OOC&quot; (&quot;Out of character&quot;) or &quot;OOG&quot; (&quot;Out of Game&quot;) are used to differentiate in-character from personal posting.

The opening message or post of each scene typically lays down the scenario and describes a scene, or continues from a previously started scene. Threads then become an ongoing story in which players periodically advance the plot by reading the latest reply and then responding with what their character does and how the environment changes in response. These replies are often open-ended so that other players can continue.

==Mediums==

=== Message-board role-playing ===
Internet forums (aka Play-By-Message-Board or PBMB, Forum Role-Playing or simply Forum-Games) are the most common medium for Play-by-Post gaming. Forums may provide features such as online dice rolling, maps, character profiling and game history. Using a forum (as opposed to a live-chat interface) allows players to re-read what they have previously written at a later date, and to read posts made by players in other threads. Many online services provide free game hosting specifically for gamemasters, or provide general forum services that can be used for role-playing purposes (such as Proboards or Invisionfree).

As an asynchronous collaborative editing tool, forums lack safeguards to prevent two writers from posting simultaneously and contradicting each other. House Rules may require players to take turns sequentially in order to avoid such conflicts, or players may require posts to be edited or deleted to rectify the situation which may result in dispute and intervention from a moderator if one is available. To avoid this, many boards offer guides and tips on roleplay etiquette. 

Many message boards are listed in roleplay directories, such as TopRPsites to make them easy to find.

Twitter and Tumblr are also very popular mediums for Roleplaying.

=== Play-by-post role-playing ===
Play-by-post role-playing is generally devoted to advancing a single overarching storyline that all board members participate in, rather than many different non-related stories proceeding in separate threads [the latter being known as &quot;multi-genre&quot;]. They vary in organization, but the primary formation includes a full set of rules governing role-playing, out-of-character conduct, combat between players, threads detailing a set storyline (often contributed to by plot-advancing, staff-organized events, or player role-plays), character approval forums, and a full staff with admin(s) and moderators. Larger boards set in a single setting are often organized by cutting up the setting into separate forums, each based on locations within the setting.

Many message board based games, such as NationStates, establish a hierarchy of moderators to manage plot, pacing and continuity. To keep story threads organized the message board is often organized into forums based on geographical location within the game setting. Other message boards, however, may choose to sort their board on genre.

===Play-by-email===
Play-by-email (PBeM) games are played as other play-by-mail games, using email as the postal medium. Players email their actions to the gamemaster or to each other using a mailing list. Play-by-email games are often slow, since the players must wait for each post before replying, but have the advantage that replies may be tailored to the players, allowing the gamemaster to keep information secret from the other players.

This should not be confused with simming style of post or email games. Sims are more collaborative storytelling, where each player tells a portion of the story, usually utilizing other characters in the area as they wish in order to complete their portion of the story. PBeM games more closely resemble table-top role playing games where players react to gamemaster presented scenarios, and characters actions are controlled by individuals.

===Play-by-chat===
Online Chat Rooms may be used in a similar fashion as forums for role-playing purposes. Unlike forums, posts are displayed to the screen in real-time and thus may increase the pace at which responses are written. Play-by chat games require users to be present for the duration of a scene which may last several hours. The game may be supplemented by external character profiles or may rely on users to provide information about their character upon request or upon entering a room. Discord has become a major medium for play-by-chat games due to its rapidly-increasing popularity and its user-friendly administrative features that allow users to create private chat rooms (known on the site as &quot;servers&quot;) in very little time. Discord servers listing roleplay servers have also become popular and many have thousands of members.

Real-time interaction between characters in chat rooms are similar to those encountered in MUDs but lack automated features of MUDs such as combat resolution and item descriptions. Players in chat rooms are required to describe objects and events through manually written text.

===Play-by-internet===
Play-by-internet (PBI) refers to fully automated games which take place using server-based software. Play-by-internet games differ from other play-by-post games in that, for most computerized multiplayer games, the players have to be online at the same time, and players can make their moves independently of any other players in the game. The turn-time is usually fixed. A server updates the game after the turn-time has elapsed evaluating all the player&#x27;s moves sent to the server. The turn-time duration can be hours, days, weeks or even months.

===Play-by-wiki===

A play-by-wiki game is played using wiki software instead of a forum. Because players&#x27; previous posts are editable and the gamemaster takes responsibility as the overall editor of the story, plot holes can be avoided and writing skills may not be as important for each writer.

Wiki space provides not only a means of communication, but also a permanent archive and a designated off-topic discussion area for each page. Players can edit posts freely because records are automatically maintained and changes can be easily undone. Sites such as Wetpaint are commonly used for this.

===Role-playing blog===
The role-playing blog (RPB) is a game which is played out online using posts within a blog or weblog. Unlike message board role-playing, a role-playing blog is generally restricted to one gaming group, and the blog contains static files such as maps, archives, and character sheets specific for that group. RPBs often incorporate mixed elements of message board role-playing, play-by-chat, as well as play-by-email styles, allowing players to mix and match the style of play that they prefer. Popular blog sites used to host these games are Tumblr and LiveJournal.

The style of role-playing on Tumblr often comes in the format of a &#x27;main blog&#x27;, the headquarters of the game, and multiple character blogs from which each player posts. The main blog often advertises for players through the tags of Tumblr. The main blog is where applicants to the game apply by filling out an application on the main blog, and where other such administration of the game occurs. The Roleplay game creator is often referred to as the &quot;Admin&quot; short for &quot;Administrator&quot; and players may be required to run major plots and game changes by the Admin before proceeding, making the Admin function in a way that a traditional GM might have. Players role-play by reblogging each other&#x27;s posts and adding paragraphs of interaction from their own character to the end, each of which are called &#x27;paras.&#x27; Often seen are text posts with dialogue and an accompanying .gif image expressing the character mood or intended expression of emotion. Though, recently .jpg icons have risen in popularity in some games.

The style of role-playing on Livejournal style RPB&#x27;s is maintained through &quot;community&quot; blogs that connect &quot;character blogs or journals.&quot; Character Blogs/Journals are generally written in first-person character driven context. These character journals are then open to all players of the community to interact on a first person style of writing. Interaction on the &quot;Community&quot; blog is done mostly in third person storybook fashion. RPB&#x27;s on a &quot;livejournal platform&quot; are frequently run by an individual referred to as MOD (moderator). MOD&#x27;s are in charge of creating the community/game setting, character limitations, rules, style of play, frequency of play and general worldly game views. MOD&#x27;s are also in charge of creating worldly events for game play response for individually plotted characters.

===Role-playing Google documents===
Somewhat similar to blogs and wikis, Google&#x27;s documents can have permissions set to allow users to access and modify a document online. This allows multiple users to edit the document at the same time, meaning that others can modify the story online. There is also a revision history that can be split allows commenting on particular words or phrases, or even a general comment, as well as a chat bar for that particular document. Since this form of role-playing is relatively new, it&#x27;s not a common way of role-playing, and it has drawbacks in the content being editable by anyone with permissions.

==Player-player combat==
In diceless games where randomisers are not used to determine the outcome of combat, the onus is on players to come to an agreement. Disputes may arise from players in competitive engagements if neither player is able to come to a compromise that is acceptable to both. Players may write their characters in a way that makes them overly powerful or invulnerable, a practice referred to as &quot;power-gaming&quot;, &quot;god-modding&quot;, or &quot;superhero syndrome&quot;. In such cases, a moderator may be required to review the conflict and make a ruling as to what should be accepted as the final result. In some rulesets, the winner of a contest may be a foregone conclusion agreed upon out-of-character and the battle itself a ceremonial description of each character&#x27;s prowess. In other systems, the only rule may be that the first character to yield or surrender is the loser of the combat. No matter the case, some sort of player consent to wins and losses is required in this type of role-playing game.

For this reason, text-based role-playing games tend to be focused slightly more on story and player-character interactions, negotiations, and relationships rather than combat. Combat-focused games tend to flow more smoothly in more rules based role-playing platforms and venues such as MUDs, D&amp;D-style games, or video games, where character building or playing skill rather than consent determines the winner of a combat, and play-by-post games usually focus on exploration, negotiation, or romance storylines where characters aren&#x27;t usually directly opposing one another.

<doc id="1008328" wikidata="Q963648" url="?curid=1008328" title="Birigui">
<text>Birigui is a city in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. The city is located on the northwest of the state and has 124,883 inhabitants (IBGE/2020) and 530.9 km2 of area.
The name &quot;Birigui&quot; comes from the Tupi–Guarani language and means &quot;little fly&quot;. It refers to the Lutzomyia fly, very common at the area.
The city is known for its children&#x27;s footwear industry.

==History==

As the major cities of the region, Birigui, emerged and grew from the Northwest Railway, built at the beginning of the century. In the beginning was a key in the clearing, located between the kilometers 259 and 261 that in 1908 happened to be a point of stop of locomotives. The town was founded on December 7, 1911 by Mr. Nicolau da Silva Nunes, an entrepreneurial Portuguese native of the Parish of Moutamorta, Trás-os-Montes.

The founder maintained in the future city the denomination given by the workers of the local railroad. The name Birigui originated in the Tupi-Guarani language, the Indians used this word as the meaning of &quot;fly that always comes&quot; to a tiny hematophagous mosquito that bothered everyone and was quite frequent in the region.
Nicolau da Silva Nunes met the region attracted by a newspaper article, on the first visit he was charmed by the exuberance and fertility of the lands of the region, especially those that involved the key of Birigui. He bought 400 bushels for himself and his representatives, Antonio Gonçalves Torres and Afonso Garcia Franco, and when he returned to Sales de Oliveira, the city where he lived, he placed the lots on sale.

Nicolau da Silva Nunes envisioned that those forests, the fertile land and the clear waters emanated progress. The only difficulty in his enterprise was his neighbors, the Crowned Indians.
To avoid frightening his customers, he used trickery, he asked, until they had erased the Indians&#x27; trail and moved in two wagons to demonstrate security.
However, neither the hostility of the Indians nor the presence of the small mosquito discouraged the first inhabitants. The first residents who accompanied the founder were Francisco Galindo Romero, Manoel Inacio, Francisco Galindo de Castro and his wife, Dona Antonia Real Dias, the first woman to live here.
The first house was erected made of mud, at the confluence of the present Silvares and Founders&#x27; Streets. Lucas Scarpin, Antonio Simões, Faustino Segura, Ricardo Del Nery, João Galo, France Contel and Giuzeppe Fonzar were some of the pioneers.
In 1912, Birigui gains another inhabitant, José Cordeiro, a typical bandeirante captain who leaves Lençóis Paulista with his expedition and joins the town. Manuel Bento da Cruz founded the company of Lands, Timber and Colonization São Paulo, with as pioneers Roberto Clark and James Mellor.

With the passage of time, the crop is occupying what was bush. Our coffee cycle is coming. With this rampant progress, Birigui achieved his emancipation on December 8, 1921, only ten years after its foundation. In February 1922 the first town hall of Birigui was elected, a month later Archibald Thomas Clark took office as the first mayor.

==Economy==

<doc id="1008330" wikidata="Q2077201" url="?curid=1008330" title="Life on Mars (song)">
<text>&quot;Life on Mars?&quot; is a song by the English musician David Bowie, first released on his 1971 album &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;. Bowie wrote the song as a parody of Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;My Way&quot;. &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; was recorded on 6 August 1971 at Trident Studios in London, and was co-produced by Bowie and Ken Scott. Bowie&#x27;s backing band consisted of guitarist and string arranger Mick Ronson, bassist Trevor Bolder, drummer Mick Woodmansey and Strawbs member Rick Wakeman on piano. &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; is primarily a glam rock ballad, with elements of cabaret and art rock; it has a complex structure that includes chord changes throughout. The lyrics are about a girl who goes to a cinema to escape reality, and include surreal images that reflect optimism and the effects of Hollywood.

On 22 June 1973, at the height of Bowie&#x27;s fame as Ziggy Stardust, RCA Records issued &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; as a single in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number three. To promote the single, photographer Mick Rock filmed a video that shows Bowie in make-up and a turquoise suit singing the song against a white backdrop. Bowie frequently performed &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; during his concerts and the song has appeared on numerous compilation albums. Scott remixed the song in 2003 and 2016, the latter being a &quot;stripped down&quot; mix.

&quot;Life on Mars?&quot; is considered by commentators as one of Bowie&#x27;s finest songs, and one of the greatest songs of all time. Critics have praised Bowie&#x27;s vocal performance and growth as a songwriter. The song&#x27;s title was given to the British television series &quot;Life on Mars&quot;, and films and other television programmes have included &quot;Life on Mars?&quot;. Artists including Barbra Streisand, and Nine Inch Nails members Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, have recorded cover versions of the song; and following Bowie&#x27;s death in 2016, &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; was frequently chosen as a tribute to the artist.

==Background and writing==
In early 1968, David Bowie&#x27;s publisher David Platz was sharing a London office with another music publisher named Geoffrey Heath. One day, Heath arrived with an acetate disc of the 1967 French song &quot;Comme d&#x27;habitude&quot;, which was composed by Claude François and Jacques Revaux, and sung by François. Heath, who had a limited option for the song&#x27;s British rights, asked Platz for a songwriter to write English lyrics for &quot;Comme d&#x27;habitude&quot;. Platz suggested Bowie, who had translated other songs for him. Bowie&#x27;s manager Kenneth Pitt believed Bowie was a more-competent lyricist than a composer, and that if Bowie wrote &quot;to a strong melody composed by someone else&quot;, it would guarantee him a hit. Bowie&#x27;s translation, which was titled &quot;Even a Fool Learns to Love&quot;, was influenced by his recent work as a mime artist and included a reference to his 1967 track &quot;When I Live My Dream&quot;. In a 2002 interview with Michael Parkinson, Bowie said that he &quot;wrote some really terrible lyrics [to it]&quot;.

After Bowie recorded an unreleased demo of &quot;Comme d&#x27;habitude&quot; in February 1968, the song&#x27;s French publishers rejected him, primarily due to his obscurity. Soon after, songwriter Paul Anka bought the rights to &quot;Comme d&#x27;habitude&quot; and rewrote it as &quot;My Way&quot;, which was recorded and made famous by American singer Frank Sinatra in 1969. The success of &quot;My Way&quot; prompted Bowie to write &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; as a parody of Sinatra&#x27;s recording. He told Parkinson: &quot;That really made me angry for so long—for about a year... eventually I thought, &#x27;I can write something as big as that, and I&#x27;ll write one that sounds a bit like it&#x27;.&quot; Bowie acknowledged &quot;My Way&quot;&#x27;s influence in the liner notes for &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;, which state &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; was &quot;inspired by Frankie&quot;.

Using &quot;My Way&quot; as a basis, Bowie wrote &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; relatively quickly. In the liner notes for the 2008 compilation &quot;iSelect&quot;, Bowie wrote he began humming the melody in a park in Beckenham, Kent; after returning home to Haddon Hall and writing the rest of the song that afternoon on piano, which he mainly used to compose other songs. Bowie believed using &quot;Comme d&#x27;habitude&quot; as a basis was not &quot;theft&quot; but &quot;a statement of rightful ownership&quot;. One &quot;Melody Maker&quot; reviewer said &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; was written after &quot;a brief and painful affair&quot; with actor Hermione Farthingale. While on tour in 1990, Bowie introduced the song by saying; &quot;You fall in love, you write a love song. This is a love song.&quot; Bowie&#x27;s original handwritten lyrics were vastly different—save for the chorus—from the finished recording; they were more akin to the tone of &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;″s other Nietzsche-inspired numbers: &quot;There&#x27;s a shoulder-rock movement and the trembling starts / And a great Lord signs in vain / What can you buy when there&#x27;s no-one to tell you / What a bargain you made...&quot;

==Recording==
===Early demo===
Bowie recorded a demo of &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; in June 1971. According to biographer Nicholas Pegg, the demo is one minute and fifty-three seconds long, and has Bowie alone on vocals and piano. This early demo contains only the first verse and chorus, and several lyrical variations from the finished track, including &quot;It&#x27;s a simple but small affair&quot;; &quot;Her mother is yelling no, and her father has asked her to go&quot;; and &quot;It&#x27;s a time for the lawman beating up the wrong guy&quot;. The demo would later be released as part of the 2022 box set &quot;Divine Symmetry: The Journey to Hunky Dory&quot;. According to biographer Marc Spitz, Bowie had recorded demos of &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; and other &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; tracks &quot;Oh! You Pretty Things&quot; and &quot;Andy Warhol&quot; around this time, which inspired Bowie&#x27;s new manager Tony Defries to look into securing a new record contract, eventually signing him to RCA Records.

===Studio version===

Work on &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; began at Trident Studios, London, on 8 June 1971. &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; was recorded on 6 August, the final day of the sessions. According to O&#x27;Leary, Bowie and co-producer Ken Scott considered the track to be &quot;the Big One&quot;, and saved it for the end of the sessions. In July that year, Defries sent a letter to comedian and jazz pianist Dudley Moore, asking him to play piano during a session. There is no evidence Moore replied; although the song on which Defries wanted Moore to play is unknown, biographer Kevin Cann said it was most likely &quot;Life on Mars?&quot;. Keyboardist, session musician and member of the Strawbs Rick Wakeman played piano on the track; he had played Mellotron on Bowie&#x27;s 1969 self-titled album. In 1995, Wakeman said he met with Bowie in late June 1971 at Haddon Hall, where he heard demos of &quot;Changes&quot; and &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; in &quot;their raw brilliance [...] the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life [...] I couldn&#x27;t wait to get into the studio and record them&quot;. Wakeman played the same 1898 Bechstein piano that was used by the Beatles for &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, and later by Queen for &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;. According to Wakeman; &quot;I remember leaving [the studio] and saying to a couple of friends that I met that evening in a local pub that I&#x27;d just played on the best song that I&#x27;d ever had the privilege to work on&quot;.

Along with Wakeman on piano, the backing band consisted of guitarist Mick Ronson, bassist Trevor Bolder and drummer Mick Woodmansey. Ronson also composed the song&#x27;s string arrangement, which according to Woodmansey, was the first he had ever undertaken. Woodmansey said Ronson &quot;was very nervous about it. We had a whole string section at Trident with the proper BBC session players who, if one note was not written properly, would turn their noses up and you wouldn&#x27;t get a good sound out of them. So Mick was really nervous, but when they played the parts they realized these rock&#x27;n&#x27;rollers might not be guys we want to be in the studio with, but the parts are good. They took it on and really went with it.&quot; Ronson&#x27;s wife Suzi said he composed the arrangement while sitting in the studio bathroom. In 2016, Woodmansey told &quot;NME&quot; &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; was the first time he realised the &quot;calibre&quot; of Bowie&#x27;s songwriting, saying; &quot;It had just gone to another level of quality... it was something really special&quot;. He also noted it was a bit scary because there was nothing around like that [at the time]&quot;. Bowie recorded his vocal performance in one take. Regarding Bowie&#x27;s talent as a vocalist, Scott stated: &quot;He was unique. [He was] the only singer I ever worked with where virtually every take was a master.&quot;
==Composition==
===Music===
Biographer David Buckley described &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; as a &quot;soaring, cinematic ballad&quot;. The song has been classified as glam rock, while Michael Gallucci of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; said the melody &quot;bridges cabaret and art rock&quot;. &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; has a complex structure; the verses are primarily in the key of F major but chords change throughout, including C7 (&quot;told her to go&quot;), F (&quot;but her friend&quot;), and later on, C9 to A (&quot;lived it ten times&quot;). The pre-chorus sections range from F major to B major, which is dominant throughout the choruses; Bolder&#x27;s bassline has a rising chromatic scale of E to E to F to G. Bowie delivers his vocals passionately during the choruses and almost nasally in the verses.

&quot;Life on Mars?&quot; begins with a single piano note, which is followed by a rest, and Bowie starts singing on the third beat. The chord sequence of &quot;My Way&quot; is used for the opening bars of &quot;Life on Mars?&quot;. Bolder&#x27;s bass begins at the lyric &quot;sunken dream&quot;. Instruments begin to build at the pre-chorus; strings and bass crash on the downbeat, Wakeman continues a run of chords on piano, while the intensity of Bowie&#x27;s voice grows, changing from D to B (&quot;focus on/SAI-LORS&quot;). He briefly weakens his B note for &quot;OH man&quot; before changing from E to B on &quot;law-man&quot;. The final climax begins at the word &quot;Mars&quot;, a B note he holds for three bars. Afterwards, another sequence plays before the next verse begins.

Ronson based his string arrangement on the bassline Bolder worked on during rehearsals for the track. The other instruments act as a counterpoint to the strings during the chorus: according to O&#x27;Leary, drummer Woodmansey plays a &quot;snare-medium tom fill to echo a descending violin line&quot;, while Wakeman adds &quot;dancing&quot; replies on piano. At the second verse&#x27;s &quot;Ibiza&quot; line, Ronson plays recorder. Bowie noted Wakeman &quot;embellished the piano part&quot; of his original melody and Ronson &quot;created one of his first and best string parts&quot; for the song. Author Peter Doggett describes Ronson&#x27;s string arrangement as &quot;gargantuan&quot;, and Christopher Sandford said &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; would be best remembered for the &quot;lush, orchestral arrangement&quot; of &quot;Life on Mars?&quot;.

Towards the song&#x27;s end, Ronson performs a short, &quot;vibrato-saturated&quot; guitar solo that was recorded in one take. The strings then play &quot;grand sweeps&quot; before a climactic tom-roll, which Doggett and O&#x27;Leary compared to the timpani in the main theme of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968), while Pegg and Sandford compare it to the poem &quot;Also sprach Zarathustra&quot;. After a false ending, Wakeman&#x27;s piano plays the chorus melody &quot;off in the distance&quot;. Then, according to O&#x27;Leary; &quot;a phone rings, the song&#x27;s manufacturers grumble, we&#x27;re left awake and alone&quot;. According to Pegg, the telephone bell rang during an earlier, scrapped take that was still present at the end of the tape; Bowie decided to keep it for the final mix. Co-producer Ken Scott explains that Ronson became annoyed and audibly cursed during the prior take when the telephone rang, and so in the final mix Scott quickly faded out the earlier take at that point.

===Lyrics===

According to British radio station BBC Radio 2, &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; has &quot;one of the strangest lyrics ever&quot;, consisting of a &quot;slew of surreal images&quot; like a Salvador Dalí painting. Spitz said the song has a theme of optimism. In the song, a &quot;girl with mousy hair&quot; visits a cinema to escape from reality. Sandford writes it &quot;sets up a complex parallel world in which the cinema becomes life&quot;. After the girl becomes &quot;hooked to the silver screen&quot;, Bowie uses an array of images that are typical of films, naming Mickey Mouse, John Lennon, &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot;, Ibiza and the Norfolk Broads.

At the time of &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;&#x27;s release, Bowie summed up &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; as &quot;A sensitive young girl&#x27;s reaction to the media&quot;. In 1997, he said; &quot;I think she finds herself disappointed with reality... that although she&#x27;s living in the doldrums of reality, she&#x27;s being told that there&#x27;s a far greater life somewhere, and she&#x27;s bitterly disappointed that she doesn&#x27;t have access to it.&quot; Doggett writes a key motif throughout the song is Hollywood, which he describes as &quot;a manufacturer of dreams and stars that have become stale with repetition&quot;. This is evident in the line &quot;the film is a saddening bore—she&#x27;s lived it ten times or more&quot;, which Sandford calls &quot;a neat, if well-worn trick, blurring the art-life divide&quot;. The Hollywood influence is also present in the line &quot;look at those cavemen go&quot;, which is borrowed from the song &quot;Alley Oop&quot;, a 1960 hit for American doo-wop band The Hollywood Argyles.

The identity of the &quot;girl with the mousy hair&quot; has been debated. Some journalists and commentators have said the girl is Farthingale. According to Pegg, however, there is no evidence to support this claim. Farthingale has rejected this theory, telling Pegg: &quot;I don&#x27;t actually have mousy hair... I wasn&#x27;t a person who lived at home with my parents, and I didn&#x27;t live a fantasy life in films. Nothing about me fits into any of the words.&quot;

===Title===
Although Bowie was fixated on becoming Ziggy Stardust at the time of its recording, &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; has no connection with the planet Mars; the title is a reference to the intense media coverage of the contemporaneous US-Soviet Union race to reach the planet. Doggett states the media interest inspired headlines around the world that asked &quot;Is there life on Mars?&quot; According to Perone, the science fiction-influenced character Ziggy Stardust and his backing band The Spiders from Mars originated in the &quot;fleeting image&quot; of &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; and the &quot;androgynous outcast&quot; who is portrayed in Bowie&#x27;s album &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; (1970).

==Release==

RCA Records released &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; on 17 December 1971, with &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; as the fourth track on side one, sandwiched between &quot;Eight Line Poem&quot; and &quot;Kooks&quot;. Eighteen months later, at the height of Bowie&#x27;s Ziggy Stardust fame, RCA released &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; as a single in the UK on 22 June 1973, with the catalogue number RCA 2316 and the 1970 track &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; as the B-side. Cann wrote the song was released as a single due to its &quot;strong reception&quot; on the Ziggy Stardust Tour. RCA had reissued &quot;Space Oddity&quot; as a single in the US in December 1972.

Shortly before its release as a single, a promotional video for &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; was filmed at Blandford West Ten Studio in Ladbroke Grove, West London, on 13 June 1973. The video was directed and filmed by photographer Mick Rock, who had earlier directed the videos for &quot;John, I&#x27;m Only Dancing&quot; and &quot;The Jean Genie&quot;. The video for &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; depicts a Bowie wearing heavy make-up and a turquoise suit that was designed by Freddie Buretti. Bowie mimes to the song against a white backdrop. According to Rock, the video &quot;wasn&#x27;t so much an idea as a moment in time&quot;, saying he &quot;wanted to do something that looked a little bit like a painting&quot;. Bowie later said the final result has a &quot;strange floaty, pop-art effect&quot;. In 2016, the video was remastered and reedited by Rock.

&quot;Life on Mars?&quot; has been released on a variety of compilation albums, including &quot;The Best of Bowie&quot; (1980) featuring an alternative edit; &quot;Changesbowie&quot; (EMI, 1990); &quot;The Singles Collection&quot; (1993); &quot;The Best of David Bowie 1969/1974&quot; (1997); &quot;Best of Bowie&quot; (2002) and &quot;iSelect&quot; (2008). A 2003 remix of the track by co-producer Ken Scott was included on some versions of the 2014 compilation album &quot;Nothing Has Changed&quot;. In 2015, &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; was remastered for the box set &quot;Five Years (1969–1973)&quot;, which was released in CD, LP and digital formats. Following Bowie&#x27;s death in 2016, a new mix of &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; by Scott was released for the compilation &quot;Legacy (The Very Best of David Bowie)&quot; and also as a digital single. The 2016 remix is &quot;stripped down&quot;, and has only strings, piano and Bowie&#x27;s vocals.

The 2022 multi-disc box set &quot;Divine Symmetry: The Journey to Hunky Dory&quot;, which comprises home demos, BBC radio sessions, alternate mixes, and other live and studio recordings from 1971, includes several versions of &quot;Life on Mars?&quot;: the June 1971 demo, the 2015 remaster of the August 1971 master, the 2016 remix (in stereo and, for the first time, 5.1 surround sound), and a 2021 mix by Scott allowing the ending with the telephone bell and Ronson&#x27;s cursing to be heard fully.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Hunky Dory&quot; was met with very positive reviews from several British and American publications. &quot;Billboard&quot;, classifying it under their &quot;Top Album Picks&quot;, named &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; as one of the strongest songs on the album. Reviewers have generally considered &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; one of the best tracks on &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;. According to Gallucci, &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; is one of the tracks that &quot;painted a portrait of an artist who couldn&#x27;t be labelled because he himself had little idea of who or what he was at the time&quot;. Dave Thompson of AllMusic describes it as &quot;a masterpiece of fragmented thought and displaced vision&quot;, and one of Bowie&#x27;s &quot;most astonishing&quot; songs. Other reviewers have classified the track as giving a strong representation of Bowie&#x27;s growth as a songwriter. On the eve of the song&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 2021, Matt Neal of ABC News wrote; &quot;the song stands as an epitaph to [a] remarkable musician&quot;.

Retrospectively, reviewers and commentators have praised &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; as one of Bowie&#x27;s finest songs. Pegg called it Bowie&#x27;s &quot;1971 masterpiece&quot; and O&#x27;Leary called it &quot;the &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; of Bowie&#x27;s songs: young man&#x27;s bravura&quot;. Doggett and Rob Sheffield considered Bowie&#x27;s vocal performance on the song to be one of his best. Spitz described it as &quot;one of the best pop songs ever written&quot;. Publications including &quot;Digital Spy&quot;, &quot;Mojo&quot; and &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; have also considered &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; Bowie&#x27;s greatest song. &quot;Digital Spy&quot; stated it has &quot;perhaps become [Bowie&#x27;s] signature song—filled with surreal cut-up lyrics..., it married vivid imagery with a tender, heartbreaking melody&quot;. In 2008, &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; number nine in a list of Bowie&#x27;s 30 best songs. 

Following Bowie&#x27;s death in 2016, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; one of the 30 most-essential songs of Bowie&#x27;s catalogue. In 2018, readers of &quot;NME&quot; voted the song as Bowie&#x27;s second-best track behind &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot;, and the publication&#x27;s staff placed it seventh a list of Bowie&#x27;s 40 best songs. In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Alexis Petridis placed it fourth in his list of Bowie&#x27;s 50 greatest songs, calling it a &quot;no-further-questions masterpiece&quot;. In 2021, staff of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; listed &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; as one of Bowie&#x27;s 20 essential songs in 2021. In a list ranking every Bowie single, &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; placed &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; at number six. In 2020, Tom Eames of British radio station Smooth Radio listed it as Bowie&#x27;s second-greatest song behind &quot;Heroes&quot;.

===Accolades===
&quot;Life on Mars?&quot; has appeared on numerous best-of lists. Neil McCormick, chief rock critic of &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, has ranked &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; the greatest song of all time in two different lists compiling the 100 Greatest Songs of All Time. In the first list, he called &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; a:

In 2007, &quot;Q&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; third in a list compiling the &quot;10 most perfect songs ever&quot; behind Jeff Buckley&#x27;s version of Leonard Cohen&#x27;s &quot;Hallelujah&quot; and the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;. &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; has also appeared in lists of the best songs of the 1970s; it was ranked at number 25 by &quot;NME&quot;, and number one by &quot;Pitchfork&quot;. In 2021, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked it number 105 on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

==Commercial performance==
Upon release as a single, &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; entered the UK Singles Chart at number 21, peaking at number three in mid-July behind &quot;Welcome Home&quot; by Peters and Lee and &quot;I&#x27;m the Leader of the Gang (I Am)&quot; by Gary Glitter. &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; remained on the chart for thirteen weeks. In West Germany, the song peaked at number 39 on the Official German Charts. In the wake of the massive commercial success of Bowie&#x27;s 1983 album &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;, &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; returned to the UK chart for one week, peaking at number 97.

In April 2007, over 30 years after its initial release, &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; re-entered the UK singles chart at number 55, largely because of its use in the British television series &quot;Life on Mars&quot;. Two years later, it charted at number 67 on the Australian ARIA charts. Following Bowie&#x27;s death in 2016, &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; charted around the world, reaching the top five in France and Ireland. In the US, it peaked at number seven and twelve on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Euro Digital Song Sales and Hot Rock &amp; Alternative Songs charts, respectively. The song also charted in Finland (12), Italy (33), Belgium Wallonia (40), Sweden (44), Switzerland (48), Portugal (63) and the Netherlands (95).

==Live performances==

David Bowie frequently performed &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; during his concert tours. Live recordings from 1972&#x27;s Ziggy Stardust tour have been released on the 2003 30th-anniversary bonus disc of &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; and on the bootleg album &quot;Santa Monica &#x27;72&quot; (1994), which received an official release as &quot;Live Santa Monica &#x27;72&quot; in 2008. On the 1973 leg of the Ziggy Stardust Tour, the song was performed in a medley with &quot;Quicksand&quot; and &quot;Memory of a Free Festival&quot;. Additionally, a live performance was recorded during the 1976 Isolar Tour on 23 March 1976 as part of a medley with &quot;Five Years&quot;; this recording was included on the album &quot;Live Nassau Coliseum &#x27;76&quot;, which has been released as part of the 2010 reissues of &quot;Station to Station&quot;, in the 2016 box set &quot;Who Can I Be Now? (1974–1976)&quot;, and as a stand-alone album in 2017. Bowie performed the song on the American television programme &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; on 5 September 1980.

A performance from the Serious Moonlight Tour, which recorded on 12 September 1983, was released on Bowie&#x27;s album &quot;Serious Moonlight (Live &#x27;83)&quot;, which was initially released as part of the 2018 box set &quot;Loving the Alien (1983–1988)&quot; and separately the following year. The filmed performance also appears on the concert video &quot;Serious Moonlight&quot; (1984). After the Sound+Vision Tour in 1990, Bowie did not perform &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; until 23 August 1999, when he sang it in a recorded-for-television performance that was released on &quot;VH1 Storytellers&quot; (2009). A year later, Bowie performed the song at Glastonbury Festival on 25 June 2000; this performance was released in 2018 on the album &quot;Glastonbury 2000&quot;. The song was a mainstay of Bowie&#x27;s Hours, 2000 and Heathen tours, while a November 2003 performance from his final A Reality Tour was released on &quot;a DVD of the tour&quot; in 2004 and in 2010 of the album &quot;A Reality Tour&quot;. Bowie&#x27;s final performance of &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; was on 8 September 2005, when he sang it with the indie rock band Arcade Fire at Radio City Music Hall, New York City, at that year&#x27;s Fashion Rocks event. Bowie was introduced by singer Alicia Keys and was accompanied by his longtime pianist Mike Garson. A recording of this performance was released via iTunes.

==Cover versions and appearances in media==

&quot;Life on Mars?&quot; has appeared in numerous television series. The British series &quot;Life on Mars&quot; was named after and heavily featured the song, which is included on the series&#x27; soundtrack album. Actor Jessica Lange sang the song with a deep German accent on the fourth-season premiere of the FX television series &quot;American Horror Story: Freak Show&quot;. Lange played a character whose surname is Mars; she wears an ice-blue trouser suit and heavy matching eye shadow in her performance, echoing Bowie&#x27;s video. The &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Waters of Mars&quot; (2009) takes place on the first human base on Mars, which is named &quot;Bowie Base One&quot;. Showrunner Russell T Davies said the base&#x27;s name is a reference to &quot;Life on Mars?&quot;.

The song has been featured in several film soundtracks. The original soundtrack of the 1996 film &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot; features &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; during the epilogue, although for copyright reasons, the song was replaced by Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Your Song&quot; on the international DVD release. Seu Jorge recorded a Portuguese cover for the 2004 film &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot;, while Bowie&#x27;s original is included on the film&#x27;s soundtrack album. &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; also appears in &quot;Loverboy&quot; (2005) and &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; (2012), and on the soundtrack of &quot;Factory Girl&quot; (2006). The song also appears in the 2015 musical &quot;Lazarus&quot;, which was written by Bowie and playwright Enda Walsh near the end of Bowie&#x27;s life. It is sung by the character Girl, who was played by Sophia Anne Caruso in the New York and London productions. For the musical, the song&#x27;s arrangement was downplayed to avoid it becoming a Broadway &quot;showstopper&quot;. &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; also features in the soundtrack to the first trailer for Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s 2021 film &quot;Licorice Pizza&quot;, and in the film itself.

A multitude of artists has covered &quot;Life on Mars?&quot;. American singer Barbra Streisand covered the song for her 1974 album &quot;ButterFly&quot;. Bowie condemned Streisand&#x27;s cover; in 1976, he said it was &quot;[b]loody awful. Sorry, Barb, but it was atrocious.&quot; In his book &quot;The Complete David Bowie&quot;, Pegg panned a 2005 easy listening version by the British group G4, calling it &quot;heroically gruesome&quot;. ABBA member Anni-Frid Lyngstad recorded a Swedish version titled &quot;Liv på Mars?&quot; for her 1975 solo album &quot;Frida ensam&quot;. A version by Belgian singer Jasper Steverlinck reached number one in the Belgian charts in 2003. In 2019, Nine Inch Nails members Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross covered the song on their soundtrack to the HBO television series &quot;Watchmen&quot;. The dark ambient piano cover is heard during the end credits of the episode &quot;An Almost Religious Awe&quot;. Reznor, who was friends with Bowie, said composing the cover was a daunting task, and that he and Ross were ultimately &quot;very proud&quot; of the result.

Following Bowie&#x27;s death in 2016, &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; was one of the most-widely selected of Bowie&#x27;s songs for tribute performances. A version by Nicholas Freestone, organ scholar at St Albans Cathedral in Hertfordshire, became a viral hit after a video of Freestone&#x27;s performance was posted on Facebook and YouTube. New Zealand singer-songwriter Lorde performed &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; with Bowie&#x27;s final touring band at the 2016 Brit Awards in February 2016. Her cover was widely acknowledged as one of the finest performances in tribute to Bowie. Later that year, the song was performed at the 2016 Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo. &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; has also been used for space-related events. In 2018, the song was played on the radio of Elon Musk&#x27;s Tesla Roadster, which was launched into space aboard the test flight of the Falcon Heavy rocket. A cover version by English singer Yungblud was used at the end of NASA TV&#x27;s live coverage of the landing of the Mars 2020 rover.

On November 30, 1894, the Asheville Farm School officially opened on , with 25 students attending. A professional staff of three offered the first three grades of elementary instruction.

In 1923, the school graduated its first high school class. A Presbyterian church was started at the school in 1925 so students and teachers would no longer have to walk three miles to Riceville; it was also named for Warren Hugh Wilson, former superintendent of the Presbyterian Church&#x27;s Department of Church and Country Life.

The first post-high school programs offering vocational training began in 1936. In 1942, the Asheville Farm School merged with the Dorland-Bell School in Hot Springs, North Carolina, to become a coed secondary school. It was named Warren H. Wilson Vocational Junior College and Associated Schools.

After World War II, the public education system in North Carolina improved dramatically and the need for the high school diminished. The last high school class graduated in 1957. In 1952, the college became one of the first in the South to desegregate, when it invited Alma Shippy, an African American from Swannanoa, North Carolina, to attend. Sunderland dorm residents voted 54–1 to allow Shippy to become a student and live in their dorm.

The school was a junior college until 1967 when it became a four-year college, Warren Wilson College, with six majors on offer. In 1972, the National Board of Missions deeded the WWC property to the college&#x27;s Board of Trustees. With its expansion of programs and to a four-year curriculum, Warren Wilson enrolls students of many different geographic and socioeconomic backgrounds. This is in contrast to the original student population of underprivileged mountain youth for basic education.

The eighth president, Lynn Morton, was the first female president in the college&#x27;s history. She is a native North Carolinian and was formerly provost and vice president of academic affairs at Queens University in Charlotte, North Carolina. She was succeeded in June 2023 by Damián J. Fernández.

==Academics==
===Undergraduate===
The foundation of the school&#x27;s undergraduate curriculum establishes that all students earn 128 hours of academic credit, work 8–15 hours per week for the school, and complete the Community Engagement Commitment. Students earn $9.05 per hour that goes directly towards their tuition. Unlike other schools in the Work College Consortium, students at Warren Wilson do not receive traditional pay checks.

Required subjects include Artistic Expression, History and Political Science, Language and Global Issues, Literature, Mathematics, Natural Sciences, Philosophy and Religious Studies, and Social Sciences to graduate and receive a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree. In addition to traditional liberal arts majors such as biology and English, undergraduates have the option of majoring in Outdoor Leadership or Environmental Studies. The Natural Science Undergraduate Research Sequence (NSURS) is the undergraduate research and presentation that is required for all Bachelor of Science degrees given by the college.

==== Work program ====
WWC has more than 70 work crews that are supported by students who commit to working 120, 180, or 240 hours each semester, helping to cover a portion of the cost of attendance. Work Crews contribute in different areas, assuming administrative, academic, custodial, land management duties on campus. :

==== Community engagement ====
Community engagement is a required activity to graduate.

=== Graduate degree programs===
The college offered a Master of Fine Arts degree in Creative Writing. A Master of Arts program focused on &quot;critical craft theory and history&quot; was offered from 2017 to 2022 in association with the Center for Craft in Asheville, N.C.

==Athletics ==
The Warren Wilson athletic teams are called the Owls. The college is a provisional member of the NCAA Division III ranks, primarily competing in the Coast to Coast Athletic Conference (C2C) for most of its sports since the 2022–23 academic year; while its men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming teams compete in the Sun Coast Swimming Conference (SCSC). All varsity teams except cycling are competed under the USCAA, while collegiate cycling is governed by USA Cycling (USAC). At one point, the college also had football and baseball teams, although they have not existed for multiple decades.

The Owls previously competed as an NCAA D-III Independent from 2020–21 to 2021–22, and as an NAIA Independent within the Association of Independent Institutions (AII) of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) from 2010–11 to 2011–12. Warren Wilson was also a member of the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA), primarily competing as a founding member of the Eastern Metro Athletic Conference (EMAC) for most of its sports from 2018–19 to 2019–20; 

Warren Wilson competes in 20 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, cyclocross, lacrosse, mountain biking, road cycling, soccer, swimming, and tennis; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, cyclocross, lacrosse, mountain biking, road cycling, soccer, swimming, and tennis. The college also has club teams for timber sports and paddling.

===NCAA Division III===
In March 2019, it was announced that the college will be joining the NCAA Division III membership process, and in April 2020, the Owls were admitted as Division III provisional members for three years. They have been seeking to join a conference during the transition.

On July 27, 2022, Warren Wilson was invited to join the C2C, beginning in the 2022–23 academic year.

===Accomplishments===
The mountain biking team finished on the podium for 14 consecutive years at collegiate national championships until 2016, when they won the team omnium in Varsity Division II. In 2017 they finished fourth, for a 16th consecutive year on the podium. Although the mountain biking team was formed in the 1990s, the road and cyclocross teams were not added until much later. They did not compete at the national championship level until the 2013–14 and 2014–15 academic years, respectively. In 2016, the cyclocross team placed fourth in the DII team omnium at nationals and third in the team relay.

The men&#x27;s basketball team won the USCAA DII national title in 2013.

The women&#x27;s cross-country team won the USCAA national title in 2000.

== Campus construction projects==
A new academic building, Myron Boon Hall, constructed on the site formerly occupied by Carson Hall, was completed in May 2018. Lord Aeck Sargent was the prime architect and lead designer of the building. PFA Architects, of Asheville, was the associate architect and collaborated with Lord Aeck Sargent in all phases. H&amp;M Constructors led the building&#x27;s construction effort. The building is LEED Gold Certified. It has six classrooms of varying sizes, and larger meeting spaces similar in size to the existing Canon Lounge in Gladfelter, to offer more spaces for large community events.

The college&#x27;s pool has been closed since 2014 when repairs to structural beams were deemed too expensive. Demolition and construction of a new pool structure began in 2017. Buncombe County contributed $300,000 to the project, with the understanding that local swim teams would also be able to use the pool. Construction encountered major setbacks. Although originally planned to be completed for the 2017–18 swim season, work on the internal aspects of the pool were still underway as of May 2023. The project has since stalled and not moving forward to the disappointment of many in the community.

<doc id="1008338" wikidata="Q2242035" url="?curid=1008338" title="Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia (1924–2016)">
<text>Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia ( / &quot;Aleksandar P. Karađorđević&quot;; 13 August 1924 – 12 May 2016) was the elder son of Prince Paul, who served as Regent of Yugoslavia in the 1930s, and his wife, Princess Olga of Greece and Denmark.

==Birth and education==
Alexander was born at White Lodge, Richmond Park, United Kingdom. As a nephew of Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent (née of Greece and Denmark), he was a first cousin of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, Prince Michael of Kent, and Princess Alexandra of Kent; he was also a first cousin once removed of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. He was educated at Ludgrove School.

==Marriages and family==
He took part in the ship tour organized by Queen Frederica and her husband King Paul of Greece in 1954, which became known as the “Cruise of the Kings” and was attended by over 100 royals from all over Europe. On the royal yacht &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, he met his future wife. On 12 February 1955, Alexander married Princess Maria Pia of Savoy, daughter of King Umberto II of Italy and of his wife, Princess Marie José of Belgium. The marriage took place at Cascais in Portugal where the bride&#x27;s father was living in exile. The couple had met on 22 August 1954 during the royal cruise of the &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, hosted by King Paul and Queen Frederica of Greece.

Alexander and Maria Pia have twin sons born in 1958:
* Prince Dimitri Umberto Anton Peter Maria of Yugoslavia (born 18 June 1958)
* Prince Michael Nicolas Paul George Maria of Yugoslavia (born 18 June 1958)
Another set of twins was born five years later, this time a girl and a boy:

*Prince Sergius &quot;Serge&quot; Wladimir Emanuel Maria of Yugoslavia (born 12 March 1963); married Sophia de Toledo on 6 November 1985. They divorced in 1986. He was remarried to Eleonora Rajneri on 18 September 2004. He has a child named Umberto Emmanuel Dimitri, with Christiane Galeotti, born in 2018.
*Princess Helene Olga Lydia Tamara Maria of Yugoslavia (born 12 March 1963); married Thierry Gaubert on 12 January 1988. The couple divorced and she remarried to Stanislas Fougeron on 12 March 2018. 
Alexander and Maria Pia divorced in 1967, and in 2003 she married Prince Michel of Bourbon-Parma, himself divorced from Princess Yolande de Broglie-Revel.

On 2 November 1973, Alexander married in a civil ceremony in Paris Princess Barbara Eleonore Marie of Liechtenstein (9 July 1942), daughter of Prince Johannes of Liechtenstein (first cousin once removed to Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein) and Countess Karoline of Ledebur-Wicheln (aunt of Hans Adam&#x27;s late wife Marie, Princess of Liechtenstein). On 28 October 1995 Prince Alexander and Princess Barbara were married in the Orthodox faith in
Oplenac, and had issue:

* Prince Dušan Paul of Yugoslavia (born 25 September 1977), married in a civil ceremony Valerie DeMuzio on 3 July 2018 in New York, USA. On 25 May 2019 they were married in the Orthodox faith in Oplenac, Serbia.

==Flying career==
The Prince wished to serve in the British Royal Air Force during World War Two, but was initially prevented by his father&#x27;s political affiliations. He was eventually commissioned in the RAF through the intervention of Prince George, Duke of Kent, his uncle. After the war, he sought employment as a pilot joining British European Airways in 1951, and subsequently engaging also in many aeronautic competitions.

==Associations==
Alexander was one of the four founding members of the Serbian Unity Congress. He was patron of the Center for Research of Orthodox Monarchism.

On 17 February 2008, Alexander issued a statement condemning the declaration of independence by Kosovo.

On the occasion of Prince Alexander&#x27;s 90th birthday on 13 August 2014, a celebration of his life in words and pictures appeared in that month&#x27;s UK magazine &quot;Majesty&quot;.

==Death==
Prince Alexander died on 12 May 2016 in Paris, where he and his wife had lived for many years. He was buried at Oplenac, Serbia, with his parents and brother, his coffin being carried by Serbian Air Force fighter pilots.

<doc id="1008340" wikidata="Q312765" url="?curid=1008340" title="Vicente Yáñez Pinzón">
<text>Vicente Yáñez Pinzón () (c. 1462 – after 1514) was a Spanish navigator and explorer, the youngest of the Pinzón brothers. Along with his older brother, Martín Alonso Pinzón (&quot;c.&quot; 1441 – &quot;c.&quot; 1493), who captained the &quot;Pinta&quot;, he sailed with Christopher Columbus on the first voyage to the New World, in 1492, as captain of the &quot;Niña&quot;.

==Personal life==
Pinzón was born in Palos de la Frontera on the Atlantic coast of Huelva, youngest of the three prominent sons of seaman Martín Pinzón and his wife Mayor Vicente. His birth year is uncertain; it is generally given as c. 1462; Juan Gil concludes from legal documents that his two daughters were over the age of 20 in 1509, that it certainly cannot be later than 1469. 1469 would be quite a late date, given that there is record of him being a corsair or privateer (with his older brother Martín Alonso) in Mediterranean waters between 1477 and 1479 when other towns failed to provide Palos with an adequate supply of grain in wartime.

He married twice: first to Teresa Rodríguez, by whom he had two daughters, Ana Rodríguez Pinzón and Juana González Pinzón; second, probably in 1509, to Ana de Trujillo, who some surviving documents refer to as &quot;Ana Núñez de Trujillo&quot;.

It would appear that he was based in Palos at least up to and including the time of Columbus&#x27;s first voyage (1492); by 1495 he was living in nearby Moguer; after the economic failure of his 1499–1500 expedition, he appears to have moved no later than 1502 to Seville. He may have moved there to escape creditors. Historian Juan Gil, researching Pinzón&#x27;s family life, found strong circumstantial evidence that his first wife left behind a mansion in Triana, across the river from Seville: her own property, not his, which passed into the hands of their daughters.

The last primary record of him is in 1514, in Seville or Triana. According to the chronicler Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés, he died that year, probably at the end of September. It is not known precisely where he is buried, though Oviedo expressed confidence that it was in the cemetery of Triana.

==Career==

In 1499, Pinzón sailed to the South American coast. Pinzón eventually disembarked on the shore called &quot;Praia do Paraíso&quot;, in present-day Cabo de Santo Agostinho of the state of Pernambuco, or further northwest, in what is today Fortaleza (capital of the Brazilian state of Ceará). According to the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) between the Crown of Castile and Portugal, Castile (later Spain) could make no claim, but the place was named &quot;&quot;Cabo de Santa María de la Consolación&quot; by Pinzón. He also sighted the Amazon River and ascended to a point about fifty miles from the sea. He called it the &quot;Río Santa María de la Mar Dulce&quot;&quot; (&quot;River of Saint Mary of the Fresh Water Sea&quot;) on account of the vastness of the fresh water river mouth, and he thus became the first European explorer to discover an estuary of the Amazon River. Pinzón is also considered the discoverer of the Oiapoque River.

In 1505, Pinzón was named commander-in-chief and &quot;corregidor&quot; of the city of Puerto Rico, now called &quot;San Juan&quot;. This was to be the first step in the colonization of the island called &quot;Borinquén&quot; by its inhabitants and &quot;San Juan Bautista&quot; by the Spanish (now called &quot;Puerto Rico&quot;). However, Pinzón did not fulfill this commission. In 1508, he travelled with Juan Díaz de Solís to South America. No record exists of Pinzón after 1514.

==Legacy==
In 1832, botanists Mart. &amp; Zucc. published &quot;Pinzona&quot;, a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Dilleniaceae and named in honour of Vicente Yáñez Pinzón.

Together with his brother, Vicente Yáñez Pinzón is the namesake of Pinzón Island in the Galápagos.

On November 19, 1999, a statue of Pinzón and his brother was dedicated in Palos de la Frontera, Spain, on the occasion of the fifth centennial of the discovery of Brazil and of the brotherhood with the city, Cabo de Santo Agostinho, Brazil.

<doc id="1008344" wikidata="Q1759350" url="?curid=1008344" title="Boituva">
<text>Boituva is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of Sorocaba. The population is 62,170 (2020 est.) in an area of 248.97 km2. The elevation is 637 metres. 

It is known as the &quot;National Skydive Capital&quot;. In Tupi, Boituva means &quot;many snakes&quot;.

==History==
The first inhabitants that formed the settlement called at that time Boituva Fields, began settling here in the late 18th century according to official history.

Some scholars affirm that the pioneers of Boituva arrived by train, the former Sorocabana Railway. Others, however assert that the first inhabitants were ex-workers of the then extinct iron smeltery on Ipanema farm, thus closed, forcing them to acquire neighboring lands.

In the second or third decade Boituva gained fame – and is known until today – as &quot;The Land of Pineapple&quot;, since the first culture on a large scale was pineapple. The quality of the fruit was such that it was awarded a gold medal in a national level exposition, realized in São Paulo, thus emerging the Boituvana variety of pineapple.

The political-administrative emancipation of Boituva occurred on September 6, 1937, the date of which is now commemorated with the celebration known as Boituvana.

On 11 May 2022 a LBK Serviço Aéreo Especializado, operating for Skydive4Fun, Cessna 208 Caravan registration PT-OQR, during initial climb from Boituva-Centro Nacional de Páraquedismo Airfield, SP (SDOI) crashed in a field due to a loss of engine power and come to rest inverted next to a transmission tower. Two of the 16 occupants died of their injuries sustained in the accident.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia Telefônica Brasileira until 1973, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

==Hymn ==

(Music and lyrics by Roberto Resendo Camargo)

:No antigo bairro &quot;Campo de Boituva&quot;, desbravadores chegando aqui
:Chamaram-te &quot;Mboy-tuba&quot; - muitas cobras, na lingua indígena tupí
:A terra abençoada e prometida da fé que faz a força do labor
:Da hospitalidade e o dom de bem servir
:Ao próximo com muito amor!

:(Chorus)
:Boituva, boituva, terra onde reside a paz...
:Quem chegou ficou, quem partiu chorou,
:E não te esquece nunca mais!

:O trem de ferro da &quot;Sorocabana&quot; fez o progresso chegar aqui...
:Na época a cidade criou fama com as lavouras do abacaxi,
:Depois o algodão e hoje a cana, são frutos do teu solo produtor,
:Uniram-se a industria e o comércio aos ideais do agricultor.

:(Chorus)

:As chácaras, o camping, as fazendas, os grandes haras, tudo isso faz
:Àqueles que procuram o aconchego, em teu sossego buscar a paz...
:O centro do civil paraquedismo, O polo do turismo e do lazer...
:Boituva nós sentimos ufanismo: é ótimo seu filho ser.

:(Chorus)

:O povo te dedica uma semana: a &quot;Boituvana&quot; que é tradição...
:A &quot;Águia da Castelo&quot; se engalana e te proclama com emoção.
:E ao comemorar seis de setembro, relembra teu passado triunfal,
:E faz do seu presente uma certeza:
:Que hoje és glória regional!

:(Chorus)

<doc id="1008347" wikidata="Q2133873" url="?curid=1008347" title="Blarney">
<text>Blarney () is a suburban town within the administrative area of Cork City in Ireland. It is located approximately north-west of the city centre. It is the site of Blarney Castle, home of the legendary Blarney Stone. Blarney is part of the Dáil constituency of Cork North-Central. It is surrounded by the suburban villages of Tower, Cloghroe and Kerry Pike, all on the outskirts of Cork City.

==Tourism==
Blarney town is a major tourist attraction in Cork. Mostly people come to see the castle, kiss the stone, and to shop at the Blarney Woollen Mills.

===Blarney Stone===

By kissing the Blarney Stone at Blarney Castle, it is claimed that one can receive the &quot;Gift of the Gab&quot; (eloquence, or skill at flattery or persuasion). The legend has several suggested roots, involving members of the MacCarthy dynasty – builders and original owners of Blarney Castle.

===Blarney Woollen Mills===
Built in 1823, Blarney Woollen Mills was originally known as Mahony&#x27;s Mills. It was a water-powered mill, producing mainly tweeds and woollens. After closing in the early 1970s, the mills was re-invented by local entrepreneur Christy Kelleher as a gift store servicing tourists visiting the village.

===Square===

&quot;The Square&quot; in the centre of the village is a grass field where Blarney locals and townspeople sometimes congregate during the summer. Several attempts to develop the square, over the years, have always been met with stiff objection from the locals. Previously, the square was used for markets.

==Transport==
Blarney formerly had its own narrow gauge railway station. The Cork and Muskerry Light Railway linked Blarney (CMLR) railway station with Cork; it opened in 1887 but closed on 29 December 1934. As of 2016, a proposed new station at Blarney (originally due for service some years previously on the Dublin-Cork railway line) remained in the proposal phase.

The town is served by a number of Bus Éireann services, including the number 215 bus every half an hour from Mahon Point via Cork city centre and the number 235 bus from Cork city at a lesser frequency.

The nearest airport is Cork Airport.

==Economy and media==
The Blarney economy is dependent on the largely US tourism trade, with numerous hotels and guest houses in the area to serve demand.

The Muskerry News is the local paper for Blarney and surrounding areas and is printed monthly. Local radio stations that can be picked up in the Blarney area are RedFM, C103, 96FM and CUH FM.

==Demographics==
Originally administered by Cork County Council, following the 2019 Cork boundary change, Blarney is within the administrative area of Cork City Council.

As of the 2022 census, the town of Blarney had a population of 2,779. Of these, 85% were white Irish, 0% white Irish travellers, 7.5% other white ethnicities, less than 1% black, 2.5% Asian, with less than 1% other ethnicities or no stated ethnicity.
In term of religion, Blarney was 77% Catholic, 4.3% other stated religion, 18% no religion, with less than 4.3% not stating a religion.

==Education==
There is a Roman Catholic mixed primary school, &quot;Scoil Chroí Íosa&quot;, which caters for approximately 300 pupils and was formed following the amalgamation of the former boys and girls schools in August 2012.

&quot;Gaelscoil Mhuscraí&quot; is an Irish language primary school in the village. Established in 2002, as of the 2022 school year, it had approximately 170 pupils.

Blarney is also the home of a secondary school called &quot;Scoil Mhuire Gan Smál&quot; which was established in the 1950s. As of August 2022, it had over 800 students enrolled.

==Sport and leisure==

In sport, the local soccer club, Blarney United FC, has playing facilities close to the village, with both a traditional grass pitch and an all-weather pitch. The pitches are supported by changing facilities, a meeting room and a hospitality room. The senior team competes in the Premier Division of the Munster Senior League. The town&#x27;s GAA club, Blarney GAA, were All-Ireland Intermediate Hurling Champions in 2009 and Cork-County Intermediate Hurling Champions in 2008. Blarney also fields a Camogie team, which was established again in 1999. The local cycling club was re-formed in 2010.

In music, the Blarney Brass and Reed Band was formed in 1981 by a group of locals who wished to form a community musical group spanning multiple age groups. The band has a music education program and won events at the South of Ireland Band Championships in 2010 and 2011.

The local Scouting Ireland group, the 45th Cork (Blarney), has a particular emphasis on camping and hillwalking.

<text>The Porsche 911 GT1 is a car designed and developed by German automobile manufacturer Porsche AG to compete in the GT1 class of sportscar racing, which also required a street-legal version for homologation purposes. The limited-production street-legal version developed as a result was named the 911 GT1 &quot;Straßenversion&quot; (&quot;Street version&quot;).

== History ==

With the revival of international sportscar racing in the mid-1990s through the BPR Global GT Series (which then morphed into the FIA GT Championship) Porsche expressed interest in returning to top-level sportscar racing and went about developing its competitor for the GT1 category. Cars in this category were previously heavily modified versions of road cars, such as the McLaren F1 and the Ferrari F40. Porsche originally modified the 993 GT2 into an EVO version and homologated it as a GT1 car, but it proved to be uncompetitive against the other cars in its class.

=== 911 GT1 ===

Despite using the 911 moniker, the car barely had anything in common with the existing 911 at the time, only sharing the front and rear headlamps with the production sports car. However, its frontal chassis is based on the 993-generation 911, while the rear subframe was derived from the 962C Group C prototype along with its water-cooled, twin-turbocharged and intercooled, 4 valves per cylinder flat-six engine fuel fed by Bosch Motronic 5.2 fuel injection, which was longitudinally-mounted in a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, compared to the rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout of a conventional 911. The engine generated a power output of about . In comparison, the 993 generation 911 GT2, which was otherwise the company&#x27;s highest-performance vehicle at the time, used an air-cooled engine with only two valves per cylinder.

The 911 GT1 made its debut in the BPR Global GT Series (the FIA championship&#x27;s predecessor) at the Brands Hatch 4 hours, where Hans-Joachim Stuck and Thierry Boutsen won comfortably, although they were racing as an invitational entry and were thus ineligible for points. They followed up by winning at Spa, and Ralf Kelleners and Emmanuel Collard triumphed for the factory team at Zhuhai.

The 1996 911 GT1 clocked at a top speed of exactly on the legendary Mulsanne Straight in the practice sessions of the 1996 Le Mans 24 Hours Race.

=== 911 GT1 Evo ===
Towards the end of the 1996 season, Porsche made revisions to the 911 GT1 in preparation for the 1997 season. The front end of the car was revised including new bodywork which featured headlamps that previewed the all-new generation of the (996) Porsche 911 which would be unveiled in 1997. The revised car was known as the 911 GT1 Evo (or Evolution). The car had the same engine as the 1996 version, but its new aerodynamic elements allowed the 1997 version to be considerably faster than the 1996 version with improved acceleration, the top speed was still around on the La Sarthe Circuit (in the race, the GT1 Evo attained a top speed of 326 km/h). At Le Mans the works cars led the race but did not last the full distance; a privately entered 1996 specification GT1 managed 5th overall and third in the GT1 class.

=== 911 GT1-98 ===
For the 1998 season, Porsche developed an all-new car, the 911 GT1-98. Designed to match the also new Toyota GT-One and the Mercedes-Benz CLK LM, the 911 GT1-98 featured bodywork that bore more of a resemblance to traditional sports-prototypes than the previous two models. A new sequential gearbox was installed to reduce shift time. Engine control also moved to a TAG Electronic Systems TAG 3.8 ECU. As per the regulations, a street-legal version of the 911 GT1-98 was made but it is believed that only one variant was produced which was still sufficient to satisfy the new regulations.

During the 1998 FIA International GT season, the 911 GT1-98 struggled to match the pace of the Mercedes, which also was improved, with the main reason being down to the air-restrictor rules which were regarded as unfavourable to the turbocharged engine (the Mercedes had a naturally aspirated V8 engine). The Michelin tyres of the factory team and especially the Pirelli of the private Zakspeed team were also considered inferior to the Bridgestone tyres of the Mercedes.

At the 1998 Le Mans, however, it was a different story. The BMW V12 LM retired with wheel bearing trouble, and the Mercedes CLK-LM cars had oil pump troubles in the new V8 engines that replaced the former V12. The Toyota GT-One, which was considered to be the fastest car, also suffered gearbox reliability problems.

The 911 GT1-98, despite being slower than the Toyota or the Mercedes, fulfilled Porsche&#x27;s slim hopes, taking both first and second place overall thanks to reliability, giving Porsche its record-breaking 16th overall win at Le Mans, more than any other manufacturer in history.

At the Petit Le Mans race in Road Atlanta, the 911 GT1-98 of Yannick Dalmas made a spectacular backward flip and landed rear first before hitting the side barriers, similar to what would later happen to a BMW V12 LMR at the same race in 2000, and the Mercedes-Benz CLR at Le Mans in 1999.

The GT1 &#x27;98 was set up with higher downforce in the race than the previous two years, which reduced its maximum speed to . However, in the 1998 Le Mans 24 Hours test days, the car hit on the Mulsanne Straight on a lower downforce setup.

=== 1999 ===
With Mercedes dominating FIA GT1 in 1998, all other entries including Porsche withdrew for the 1999 season. The GT1 class was cancelled, and the FIA GT Championship was contested with GT2 cars. Having won the 1998 24 Hours of Le Mans, Porsche could have entered at Le Mans, but they opted not to try to defend their 1998 victory against the new entrants from other manufacturers.

Champion Racing brought a 911 GT1 Evo to America to race in the American Le Mans Series, but was only allowed to do so as an LMP (Le Mans Prototype) class entry, where it proved uncompetitive against actual prototypes such as the BMW V12 LMR.

=== Gunnar G-99 ===
Following Champion&#x27;s purchase of a 911 GT1 Evo for 1999, Gunnar Racing offered a custom race car to the team with intentions to race in 2000. The car, known as the Gunnar G-99, was a custom-built 911 GT1 with an open cockpit. The chassis was made from scratch yet remained nearly identical to the 911 GT1 mechanically, even using the bulk of the body parts. A large rollbar was put over the open cockpit to help protect the driver. A 3.6-litre flat-6, from a Porsche 911 GT3, was used in place of the standard 911 GT1 unit.

However, Champion would instead turn to buy a Lola B2K/10, so the Gunnar G-99 was temporarily abandoned. The car would resurface in the Rolex Sports Car Series in 2002, yet would not be allowed to race until it had a roof again. Therefore, Gunnar Racing rebuilt the car with a near-identical GT1 roof, and briefly competed in 2003. The car would take a best finish of second in class twice before being retired due to lack of funding and due to the ban on SRP cars in favour of Daytona Prototypes.

== Street-legal version ==
Regulations for the GT1 category stipulated that to be eligible, a total of 25 cars must be built for road use.

Porsche developed two prototype cars, both fully road-legal versions. The first was delivered in early 1996 to the German Federal Ministry of Transport, Building, and Urban Development for compliance testing, which it passed. The second prototype vehicle is in the hands of a Bahrain-based private car collector Khalid Abdul Rahim. These two cars feature 993 style front headlights.

The production car - dubbed &quot;911 GT1 &quot;Straßenversion&quot;&quot; - was a run of approximately 20 units which were built in 1997 and featured 996 style front headlights. The majority of the production model was finished in Arctic Silver or Fern White, but three cars were finished in unique colours: Polar Silver, Indian Red, and Pastel Yellow.

A single car - the 911 GT1-98 &quot;Straßenversion&quot; - was built in 1998 to homologate the all-new racing version under the new FIA regulations.

The engine had to be slightly de-tuned to meet European emissions laws, although its at 7,000 rpm and of torque at 4,250 rpm proved to be more than adequate; the car could accelerate to from a standstill in 3.9 seconds on its way to a top speed of .

&quot;Auto, Motor und Sport&quot; tested the street-legal version in 1997 with the following results:

*0- : 2.1 seconds
*0- : 3.9 seconds
*0- : 5.4 seconds
