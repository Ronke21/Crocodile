<text>Botucatu is a city in the southeastern region of Brazil and is located from São Paulo, the capital of the state of São Paulo. It has an estimated population of 148,130 (as of 2020) in an area of . It lies on the top of a plateau ( high). Botucatu became a village in 1855, and a city in 1876.

The region has humid-subtropical weather, with dry, cold winters and hot, wet summers. During winter the temperature rarely falls below . During most of the year, mainly at night, a breeze blowing over São Paulo plateau, from which Botucatu elevates about , cools the city and surroundings; this cold everyday wind from the high plateaus is where the city got its name from.

Botucatu&#x27;s biggest employer is UNESP, one of the three São Paulo state universities, one of the top universities in all of Latin America and part of several World Top Universities list, making the city an important center for medical research and education. In particular, the city has two campuses, one centered on biomedical sciences, including a school of medicine, an Institute of Biosciences and school of veterinarian sciences, and the other centered on agricultural sciences. The leading industrial company is Embraer through a subsidiary, Neiva, that has a multipurpose plant there but primarily manufacture the EMB 202 &quot;Ipanemão&quot; crop spraying aircraft. Along with Rondonópolis and Ribeirão Preto, it is one of the centers of the large Brazilian airborne spraying industry. The city has also two bus bodyworks builders, the Brazilian and the Basque Irizar. Besides UNESP, there are other private colleges.

The city boasts a higher than usual elementary and mid-level educational network, including public and private institutions. It is also an important center for &quot;organic&quot; agriculture being the site of a recognized certification body.

== History ==

The city of Botucatu, herein referred as such for being the seat of an archdiocese, has experienced many changes during a century and a half of existence, the most substantial being the arrival of the state university in 1960.

The modern name Botucatu derives from the old Tupi name &quot;ybytukatu&quot; meaning &quot;good wind&quot;, and was applied in 1720 when the land here was parceled up and granted to settlers. Local legends survive that predate the period of structured settlement, however, relating to the time when Botucatu was the focus of a transit crossing along the route connecting the Atlantic coast with the Peruvian lands.

In the nineteenth century Old Botucatu was a place full of romantic characters such as coffee barons, musicians and poets and hinterland explorers. One of these is Conde (count) de Serra Negra, who is locally considered the father of Lawrence of Arabia and Rhett Butler, who is said to be buried there. Of note, Botucatu&#x27;s municipal council has declared war on Great-Britain on two distinct occasions, with no actual consequences.

In April 2014 opened the first mall in the city.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia Telefônica Brasileira until 1973, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<text>Dragonheart (stylized as DragonHeart) is a 1996 fantasy adventure film directed by Rob Cohen and written by Charles Edward Pogue, based on a story created by him and Patrick Read Johnson. The film stars Dennis Quaid, David Thewlis, Pete Postlethwaite, Dina Meyer, and Sean Connery as the voice of Draco the Dragon.

It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and various other awards in 1996 and 1997. The film received mixed reviews, with critics praising the premise, visual effects, and character development but panning the script as confusing and clichéd. It was a box-office success, earning $115 million worldwide. It was dedicated to the memory of Steve Price and Irwin Cohen.

== Plot ==
In 984 A.D. The knight Sir Bowen mentors Saxon prince Einon. While suppressing a peasant rebellion, Einon&#x27;s father Freyne is killed by the rebels. Peasant girl Kara later accidentally wounds Einon&#x27;s heart. Einon&#x27;s Celtic mother Aislinn asks a dragon to save his life. The dragon makes Einon promise to be a just ruler and replaces Einon&#x27;s wounded heart with half his own. However, Einon proves oppressive by enslaving the former rebels that killed Freyne and forcing them to rebuild a castle. Einon also has Kara&#x27;s father, who led the insurgents, blinded. Believing that the dragon&#x27;s heart has corrupted Einon, Bowen swears vengeance on him and all dragons by hunting them down.

Twelve years later, Bowen has become a skilled dragonslayer. Monk Brother Gilbert witnesses Bowen&#x27;s prowess and follows him to record his exploits. Meanwhile, Kara asks that Einon free her father after years of slavery; Einon instead kills him. 

Bowen stalks a dragon to its cave, not knowing that it is the one who saved Einon. The confrontation ends in a stalemate, during which the dragon states that he is the last of his kind; they agree not to kill each other and instead form a partnership to defraud villagers with staged dragon &quot;slayings&quot;. Bowen later names the dragon after the Draco constellation, unaware of Draco and Einon&#x27;s connection, through which they feel each other&#x27;s pain.

Kara, seeking revenge on Einon, is imprisoned after a failed assassination attempt. Realizing that she is responsible for his near-death, Einon tries seducing Kara and making her his queen. Despising what Einon has become, Aislinn helps Kara escape the castle. Kara tries to rally her village against Einon, but they sacrifice her to Draco instead. After Draco takes Kara to his lair, Einon arrives to recapture her and fights Bowen. He nearly kills Bowen, but Draco intervenes and reveals his half-heart to Einon, making him flee in fear. Kara asks Bowen to help overthrow Einon, but the disillusioned knight refuses.

Bowen reunites with Gilbert at another village while Kara tries exposing Bowen and Draco, appalled by their actions. The villagers do not believe her until after the staged slaying while Draco plays dead. He bolts when the villagers decide to carve him up for meat, revealing the scam. Then they surround Bowen, Kara, and Gilbert, wanting to eat &quot;them&quot; instead; Draco rescues the trio and takes them to Avalon, where they take shelter among the tombs of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.

Draco reveals that he hoped to change Einon&#x27;s nature by saving him, reuniting the races of Man and Dragon, and earning a place in the constellation—the Dragon&#x27;s Heaven. Draco fears that his choice has cost him his soul, and that his spirit is doomed to disappear upon death like he never existed. After hearing that Kara and even Gilbert intend to oppose Einon, Draco agrees to help. When a vision of Arthur reminds him of his knightly honor, Bowen also agrees.

Bowen, Kara, Gilbert, and Draco organize and train the villagers into an army. They are nearly victorious against Einon&#x27;s forces when Gilbert strikes Einon in the heart with an arrow. However, Draco, feeling Einon&#x27;s pain, falls from the sky and is captured. Realizing that he is immortal as long as Draco lives, Einon is determined to keep Draco imprisoned. Knowing their connection, Aislinn attempts to kill Draco at his request, but Einon intercepts and kills her.

The rebels invade Einon&#x27;s castle to save Draco. Bowen throws Einon from atop a tower in the ensuing fight. He then tries freeing Draco, who begs Bowen to kill him and end Einon&#x27;s reign. Einon rises and charges towards them, forcing a reluctant Bowen to throw an axe into Draco&#x27;s exposed half-heart, killing him and Einon.

Draco&#x27;s body dissipates as his soul joins his fellow dragons to become a new star in the constellation. Bowen and Kara go on to lead the kingdom into an era of justice and peace, with Draco&#x27;s star shining brighter than ever in troubled times.

==Cast==
* Dennis Quaid as Sir Bowen, a knight who becomes a dragonslayer and then allies with Draco. Director Rob Cohen was impressed with Quaid, telling producer Raffaella De Laurentiis &quot;[Quaid] &quot;is&quot; a knight of the old code&quot;. Cohen called Quaid &quot;obviously intelligent and fun to work with&quot; and said that he &quot;really [thought] he was Bowen&quot;. Quaid underwent rigorous training for the role, mostly practicing sword fighting. Quaid and Cohen both wanted Bowen&#x27;s sword technique to have an &quot;Eastern flavor&quot;, so Quaid trained with Japanese sword master Kiyoshi Yamasaki.
* Sean Connery as the voice of Draco, the last remaining dragon. Cohen felt it was &quot;very important that [the dragon&#x27;s] personality be derived from the actor who was going to play the voice&quot; and said that Connery was the only actor he had in mind for the role. He described Connery&#x27;s voice as &quot;unique&quot; and &quot;instantly recognizable&quot;, but said that it was &quot;what [Connery] stood for in life as an actor and as a man that most related to what I wanted for Draco&quot;. Connery did the voice recording for Draco in three sessions. To help animate Draco&#x27;s facial expressions, Cohen and the ILM animators took close-up shots of Connery from his previous films, categorized the clips according to what emotion he was expressing, and put them in separate tapes for easy reference.
* David Thewlis as King Einon, a tyrant who shares part of Draco&#x27;s heart. Cohen cast Thewlis based on his performance in &quot;Naked&quot;, stating, &quot;what makes a villain scary is the brain, not the brawn&quot;.
** Lee Oakes as young Einon
* Dina Meyer as Kara, a peasant girl who seeks revenge on Einon for killing her father. Meyer was the second actress Cohen interviewed for the role. Cohen said that he needed an actress who was &quot;strong and someone who could, in the end, handle herself with these double viking axes and look believable&quot;. Sandra Kovacikova plays Kara as a child.
* Pete Postlethwaite as Brother Gilbert of Glockenspur, a monk and aspiring poet who joins Bowen and Draco in the revolt against Einon. Cohen wanted Postlethwaite for the role based on his performance in &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot;, feeling that &quot;anyone who was assured in a dramatic role could take Brother Gilbert and make it real and charmingly funny&quot;.
* Jason Isaacs as Lord Felton, Einon&#x27;s second in command. He hires Bowen to slay a dragon running rampant around his village but refuses to pay after learning more of Bowen.
* Julie Christie as Queen Aislinn, Einon&#x27;s mother. Cohen found Christie through David Thewlis&#x27; casting agent.
* Peter Hric as King Freyne, Einon&#x27;s father and Aislinn&#x27;s husband.
* Brian Thompson as Brok, Einon&#x27;s knight who served alongside Einon&#x27;s father when he was king.
* Terry O&#x27;Neill as Redbeard, Kara&#x27;s father.
* Wolf Christian as Hewe, a one-eyed villager who is part of the peasant rebellion.
* John Gielgud as the uncredited voice of King Arthur, who speaks to Bowen during his visit to Avalon.

===Writing===
In 1988, Patrick Read Johnson came up with the idea for &quot;Dragonheart&quot; and pitched it to producer Raffaella De Laurentiis a year later. Johnson proposed the film&#x27;s concept to De Laurentiis, describing it as &quot;&quot;The Skin Game&quot; with a dragon in it...or &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Dragon&quot;&quot;. He wanted &quot;the idea of a dragon and a knight conning villages for money&quot; because he thought the concept was &quot;not only funny, but kind of sweet&quot;. According to Johnson, before the film was ever called &quot;Dragonheart&quot; and had the element of the shared heart, it began with the premise of

Johnson&#x27;s manager Melinda Jason also managed screenplay writer Charles Edward Pogue, who previously wrote for David Cronenberg&#x27;s remake of &quot;The Fly&quot; and was working on adapting &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; for Disney. When meeting for drinks in Bora Bora, Johnson pitched the idea for &quot;Dragonheart&quot; to Pogue, and he agreed to work on the film. Johnson already had the story&#x27;s beginning and end in mind but not much of the middle, so he and Pogue collaborated on the script, developing the characters and the Old Code while working the Arthurian myth into the story. Pogue described the story&#x27;s themes as &quot;a disillusioned man&#x27;s struggle to recapture his idealism&quot; and &quot;the attempt to maintain one&#x27;s passion in the cesspool of the world&quot;. Creating the backstory of the dragon culture and spiritual afterlife proved challenging for Pogue; he had to think of Draco&#x27;s motivations and why he clings to life rather than letting Bowen kill him and end his despair. Pogue solved the issue by making Draco fear going to Hell without a soul for sharing his heart with Einon. Then Bowen re-enters Draco&#x27;s life, and he sees hope and a chance for redemption through Bowen, with Draco unaware that the fateful decision he&#x27;s been avoiding for years is now closer than he knows. According to Pogue, the screenplay for &quot;Dragonheart&quot; is among his best work, and it moved countless people to tears; he completed the first draft in only two months. After he, Johnson, and De Laurentiis made revisions, Pogue finished the script in 1990. They submitted it to Universal Pictures on a Friday. Two days later, on Monday morning, Universal gave Johnson the green light to start making the film as the script produced a strong emotional response from studio executives.

===Casting===
During his time location scouting in Spain, Johnson created the character of Draco. He and Pogue shaped it for Sean Connery, a client of Creative Artists Agency (CAA) at the time, who was Johnson&#x27;s only choice in mind to voice Draco. Johnson wanted to &quot;animalize&quot; Connery&#x27;s voice by giving it &quot;deep resounding rumbles, and make the vocabulary such that it didn&#x27;t sound quite human&quot;. Instead of how it is heard in the final film, &quot;it wasn&#x27;t just gonna be Sean Connery&#x27;s voice coming out of the dragon&quot;.

After completing location scouting, CAA sent numerous English and Irish actors to meet with Johnson for the Bowen role, including Gabriel Byrne, Timothy Dalton, and Pierce Brosnan. English actresses sent for the part of Kara included Elizabeth Hurley and Patsy Kensit. Johnson then met the then-up-and-coming Liam Neeson, and the two hit it off, with Johnson noting how Neeson could be both brooding and funny, but much to Johnson&#x27;s chagrin, the studio refused to believe Neeson could pull off the action hero role since he had just completed &quot;Darkman&quot;. Wanting a big-name lead actor for the film, Universal sent the script to actors like Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, and Arnold Schwarzenegger as potential Bowen candidates. The studio even suggested that Whoopi Goldberg voice Draco instead of Connery. Other actors considered to replace Neeson included Harrison Ford, Mel Gibson, and Patrick Swayze, Cohen&#x27;s first choice for Bowen before Dennis Quaid accepted the role. With the castings of Quaid as Bowen and Meyer as Kara, Johnson said:

Johnson also claimed that Cohen shooting the scenes with Lee Oakes as young Einon first greatly hindered David Thewlis&#x27;s performance; Oakes spoke with a thick Northern English accent, forcing Thewlis to mimic the child actor&#x27;s accent.

=== Production ===
After Universal approved the screenplay and gave the go-ahead on the film, Johnson and De Laurentiis scouted Spain for filming locations. Johnson described &quot;Dragonheart&quot; as a phenomenon that took off in Hollywood since it was &quot;a movie that everybody wanted to be in, and everybody wanted to score, and everybody wanted to be the cinematographer of, and everybody wanted to direct&quot;. For a campfire scene test, Johnson had the then-unknown Clive Owen fill in for Liam Neeson as Bowen opposite an animatronic Draco made by Jim Henson&#x27;s Creature Shop.

As the Creature Shop did tests for Draco, Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) did CGI tests for &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. Universal believed waiting would be better as the CGI technology could benefit &quot;Dragonheart&quot;. Additionally, according to Johnson, Universal saw the Creature Shop test footage as the pretext for the final film&#x27;s quality. The studio went behind his back, trying to remove him from the project and give it to an A-list director since Johnson only had one film to his name at the time. Raffaella De Laurentiis tried to negotiate the budget to one the studio would accept at around $21 million. Still, Universal wouldn&#x27;t take an amount lower than $23 million and would ironically end up spending roughly triple the amount on the film. When Universal ended his contract, Johnson was only paid and given credit for writing the story and acting as executive producer. For his desired direction for the film, Johnson said:

Then Richard Donner was approached as Universal sought a replacement director. Donner spent roughly six months working on the film before moving on to other projects. The studio declined Kenneth Branagh after deciding the amount he asked to star in and direct the film was too expensive. De Laurentiis hoped to make John Badham, Rob Cohen&#x27;s then-partner, interested in handling &quot;Dragonheart&quot; and sent him the script; according to Cohen, Badham &quot;didn&#x27;t respond&quot; to the material. After working with De Laurentiis on &quot;&quot; in 1993, Rob Cohen agreed to take over as director, and Universal announced his attachment to the film in January 1994.

=== Creative direction ===
Since &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; was released and Universal Studios sought to have Draco made with CGI like the dinosaurs, there had to be script alterations per Draco&#x27;s allowed screen time based on the film&#x27;s budget. As a result, Draco would appear less often than in the original script, which included a sequence with Bowen flying around on Draco&#x27;s back.

According to Pogue, the film production became troublesome after Rob Cohen&#x27;s hiring; Pogue felt Cohen &quot;had neither the poetry in his soul nor the panache to bring &quot;Dragonheart&quot; to the screen&quot;. One of Cohen&#x27;s first changes to the film was setting it during the 10th century Dark Ages rather than the sophisticated &quot;Robin Hood-era&quot; 12th century Middle Ages. He felt the possibility of dragons existing during the mostly unrecorded period would be more believable and appropriate for his grittier vision. While streamlining the script with Pogue, they removed one of Bowen and Draco&#x27;s scams as Cohen felt that doing three would be too expensive and reduced the number of battles. Other changes to the script under Cohen&#x27;s direction include:

* Reducing Queen Aislinn to &quot;a glorified bit player&quot;.
* Changing the unseen old scarred dragon from male to female.
* Cutting a scene between Gilbert and Bowen by a riverbank where they discuss their goals and motivations.

Also removed were scenes showing the developing love story between Bowen and Kara, which the final film only alludes to without proper resolution. For example, Kara and Bowen declare their love for each other, during which Bowen asks Kara for her &quot;lady&#x27;s favor&quot;. Kara reveals Einon raped her and therefore has nothing to give Bowen, so Bowen kneels and gives her a chaste kiss on the hand. Cohen reportedly removed the scene because he felt Kara should be more of an action-oriented character swinging axes around and didn&#x27;t believe she would make &quot;sappy speeches&quot;. Pogue however said that Cohen cut the scene because he couldn&#x27;t get the desired performance, which involved having Kara and Bowen in an intimate embrace instead of the hand kiss, and conflicted with Dina Meyer. This issue also made Cohen cut a scene with the peasant army gifting Bowen a suit of armor they make for him, overwhelming Bowen with emotion, which Pogue considered Dennis Quaid&#x27;s best scene. Then Cohen&#x27;s desire to showcase Draco as the film&#x27;s main attraction caused the deletion of vital &quot;connective tissue&quot; scenes, making the film feel inconsistent and rushed. Pogue also said the film suffered because Universal aimed to turn &quot;Dragonheart&quot; into a kids&#x27; movie as the dark and weighty elements were either removed or dumbed down. As Johnson said: &quot;They messed with the script and started adding things like, &#x27;Ready or not here I come! It&#x27;s Draco!&#x27; I mean, we never had that stuff in our script! All this cheesy crap that just juvenilized the picture&quot;.

Another change Cohen made to the script that was a bone of contention to Pogue was the lack of logic in adding the pigs to the swamp village scene. In Johnson&#x27;s words:

Pogue explains that Draco uses the scams he and Bowen do to &quot;pick at Bowen&#x27;s conscience and test his morality&quot;. Each village they go to is more poverty-stricken than the last. This point would come to a head and serve Bowen&#x27;s character arc in the swamp village; its people are beyond impoverished, and Bowen feels he can no longer justify the scams as a way to be a thorn in Einon&#x27;s side. When Cohen added the pigs to the scene, Pogue told De Laurentiis it would make everyone look stupid since the villagers were supposed to be starving. They are trying to eat a seemingly dead Draco for an easy meal before turning on Bowen, Kara, and Gilbert for being the victims of a cruel joke, yet the pigs surrounding the villagers would&#x27;ve sustained them. Pogue and De Laurentiis brought the illogical nature of adding the pigs to Cohen&#x27;s attention, but he forcibly dismissed their concerns. The pigs stayed in the film, and the elements that would serve Bowen&#x27;s arc became pointless.

According to Johnson, the script changes also damaged Einon; Johnson envisioned Kenneth Branagh or a similar actor in the role as a quiet and confident villain with a sense of unpredictability who&#x27;d go crazy upon realizing his and Draco&#x27;s fates are connected. To Johnson, the script revisions turned Einon into a continuously shouting brat and a character stripped of potential development.

In the &quot;Making of Dragonheart&quot; featurette on DVD, Cohen says he was aware of the project for years before getting the directing job and that Johnson was merely involved with the script. Johnson said that he harbored no ill will for Cohen taking over the project, but that changed when he &quot;started hearing the horror stories about how Chuck Pogue was being treated, and then I started seeing Rob taking credit for things that weren&#x27;t his to take credit for&quot;. Cohen also took credit for Draco&#x27;s design and Sean Connery being Draco&#x27;s voice actor. Johnson cites an article from &quot;Cinescape&quot; magazine, &quot;where Rob is again asked about the origin of the project and he basically tries to sell the idea that I was some film student that somehow got attached to this great project that somehow pre-existed my involvement&quot;.

===Dragon design and animation===
After leaving &quot;Alien 3&quot;, sculptor Gary Pollard supervised and sculpted the first Draco design, a wyvern with a long snout and a crown of feather-like horns. To stay within the budget Universal was willing to shell out with Johnson directing, the developers approached Jim Henson&#x27;s Creature Shop to create the Draco through traditional means. The dragon model was done within eight weeks, including a quarter-scale puppet and a full-size head that could speak with real-time lip sync through camera speed manipulation. Then the crew went to Shepperton Studios in England to begin shooting the film, starting with the campfire scene. The team faced difficulties in keeping within the budget. The test didn&#x27;t convince Universal that Draco could have enough dynamic movement.

After &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;&#x27;s theatrical release, the CG dinosaurs convinced De Laurentiis to bring Draco to life with CGI. Universal hired several effects companies to do Draco animation tests. Due to time constraints, ILM did a screen test for &quot;Dragonheart&quot; using a &quot;stretched out&quot; version of the Tyrannosaurus from &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. The test impressed Universal, so they attached ILM to the film in May 1994.

Rob Cohen hired Phil Tippett, a visual effects producer specializing in creature design and character animation, to animate Draco for &quot;Dragonheart&quot;. Tippett states that his studio&#x27;s responsibilities for &quot;Dragonheart&quot; differed from what they did for &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; since Draco would have more screen time (23 minutes for Draco instead of six and a half for the dinosaurs). They were primarily responsible for Draco&#x27;s actual look and design, storyboards, blocking, and action sequence timing. Tippett worked closely with sculptor Peter Konig in designing Draco. Konig crafted between 20 and 30 maquettes before Cohen approved the final design. Konig improved the ones Cohen said &quot;[felt] right&quot;, adding forearms as Cohen wanted Draco to use his hands. Cohen&#x27;s ideas for Draco&#x27;s design stemmed from the traditional Chinese guardian lion, which Cohen describes as having &quot;a lion-like elegance, a fierceness&quot;, and that it is &quot;ultimately a proud...visually powerful creature&quot;. As Draco had to emote, Tippett infused human features into Draco&#x27;s face to make it mammalian rather than reptilian; his muzzle was designed to be a mixture of a highland gorilla and a human mouth to accommodate his dialogue. Draco&#x27;s face was designed to resemble Sean Connery&#x27;s after his casting. Cohen also drew ideas from nature, such as the boa constrictor&#x27;s jaw structure, horses&#x27; musculature, and retractable teeth. Tippett also considered how Cohen would frame the scenes involving Draco, the size difference between Draco and the human actors, and what he would do throughout the film. Tippett and his crew created a five-foot model of Draco for lighting reference and an articulated model used as a reference for Draco&#x27;s poses.

It took five months for four modelers to make Draco&#x27;s digital model with ILM&#x27;s Alias software. Originally, Draco&#x27;s scales and wings would have an iridescent quality; it is visible in some scenes but mostly not. His wingspan was initially calculated as 125 ft to support his body but halved to 72 ft to be practical enough to fit on the sets. His eyes were also more detailed and dilated. Those were some of the design elements dropped because of software issues, running out of time, and wanting to make Draco as realistic as possible and not too fantastical. To aid animators so that Draco&#x27;s performance resembled Connery as much as possible, Cohen made an extensive library of reference footage with hundreds of Connery images from his filmography up to that point, categorized by his displayed emotion.

&quot;Dragonheart&quot; is the first film to use ILM&#x27;s Caricature software, developed to help lip-sync Draco&#x27;s animation to Sean Connery&#x27;s voiceover work; programmer Cary Phillips received the Academy Scientific and Technical Achievement Award for creating the software. The film is notable for having the first realistic CG dragon in film, and Draco is the first dragon ILM made capable of human speech.

===Filming===
Pre-production on &quot;Dragonheart&quot; began on January 17, 1994, while principal photography began that July in Slovakia, scheduled to end in November. During sequences with Draco and Bowen, visual effects supervisor Scott Squires and his teams used what they called a &quot;monster stick&quot;—a pole with a bar and two red circles at the top—as an indicator for where Draco&#x27;s eyes would be for Quaid&#x27;s reference. They also set up speakers through which Cohen would read Draco&#x27;s lines for Quaid, which Quaid said that it &quot;helped [him] out a lot&quot;.

While filming the scenes involving Draco in flight, the crew used a microlight for reference and edited the footage to &quot;put Draco over the top of that and remove any traces of the aircraft&quot;.

Although Draco is fully CGI-rendered, some scenes use full-sized models of some of his body parts. One of them was Draco&#x27;s foot, used to pin Bowen to the ground, and the other was Draco&#x27;s jaw during the scene where Bowen gets trapped inside it. While the foot was a non-moving prop, the jaw had moving parts, and a puppeteer operated it.

In January 1995, editor Peter Amundsen delivered the film&#x27;s first cut to Cohen with a length of 2 hours and 18 minutes. After going through the reels, they shortened the film to two hours and seven minutes. In mid-March, they completed the final cut with 182 CG shots. According to Cohen, they spent an additional 13 months working on the film after making the final cut. He was in Rome to shoot &quot;Daylight&quot; on-location during this period and had to review animation sequences with ILM, giving them his comments and instructions through a satellite hookup.

===Music===

After reading the script, Jerry Goldsmith personally requested Johnson to let him score &quot;Dragonheart&quot; when Johnson was set to direct the film. Goldsmith never got to write any music for the film as things fell through during production, and he left the project when Universal let Johnson go.

Randy Edelman composed the score, beginning in the late fall of 1995 and finishing by the start of 1996. The main theme song, &quot;The World of the Heart&quot;, and its companion track, &quot;To the Stars&quot;, were used in many film trailers such as &quot;Two Brothers&quot;, &quot;Mulan&quot;, &quot;Anna and the King&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Young Black Stallion&quot;, and &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot;, among others. Clip montages at the Academy Awards feature the &quot;Dragonheart&quot; theme, as do the closing credits of the U.S. broadcasts of the Olympic Games, making it a well-known film score. MCA Records released the film&#x27;s soundtrack album on May 28, 1996, containing 15 music tracks.

==Release==
===Box office===
Released on May 31, 1996, &quot;Dragonheart&quot; collected $15 million during its opening weekend, ranking in third place at the box office behind &quot;Twister&quot; and &quot;&quot;. The film grossed $115 million against the budget of $57 million.

===Home media===
&quot;Dragonheart&quot; was released on VHS on November 19, 1996, and on DVD as a &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; on March 31, 1998. A THX certified widescreen VHS version would debut on September 9, 1997. The film was later released on HD DVD on May 29, 2007. &quot;Dragonheart&quot; and &quot;Dragonheart: A New Beginning&quot; were released on a one-disc print known as &quot;2 Legendary Tales&quot; on March 2, 2004. &quot;Dragonheart&quot; was released on Blu-ray Disc on March 27, 2012. Shout! Factory released the film in 4K on Blu-ray on February 28, 2023.

===Merchandising and marketing===
The film&#x27;s first official trailer featured Enya&#x27;s song &quot;Pax Deorum&quot; from her album &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot;.

Kenner released a toy line based on the main characters and additional dragons that weren&#x27;t shown or mentioned in the film. Revell (under their Promodeler line) produced and released only 5000 units of a limited edition vinyl model kit of Draco and Bowen, sculpted by John Dennett. In 1996, Topps released trading cards for the film, and the comics division published a two-issue comic adaptation.

==Other media==
===Novelization===

Charles Edward Pogue wrote a 262-page novelization, &quot;Dragonheart&quot;, published by The Berkley Publishing Group in June 1996. The first edition shows Pogue as the sole author, but the book is frequently listed with Johnson as co-author.

Based on his original screenplay, with &quot;several new inspirations that weren&#x27;t in any of the various drafts&quot;, it is faithful to his vision of &quot;Dragonheart&quot; as the transcendent film it should have been. It was released in several languages and five editions in the U.S. to widespread critical acclaim. Readers praised Pogue&#x27;s writing and how the book develops the story, setting, and characters more than the film, noting its darker and more serious tone than the film&#x27;s.

In 1999, Adriana Gabriel adapted the film into a junior novelization.

===Video game===
After its release, &quot;Dragonheart&quot; spawned a spin-off 2D hack and slash game for the PlayStation, Saturn, PC, and Game Boy called &quot;&quot;, made by Acclaim Entertainment.

==Reception==
Based on reviews from 30 critics compiled retrospectively, Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 50% with an average rating of 5.7 out of 10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;Dragonheart&quot; gives us medieval action, a splendidly mulleted Dennis Quaid, and Sean Connery as a talking dragon -- and, unfortunately, a story that largely fails to engage&quot;. On Metacritic — which assigns a weighted mean score — the film has a score of 49 out of 100 based on 27 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars: &quot;While no reasonable person over the age of 12 would presumably be able to take it seriously, it nevertheless has a lighthearted joy, a cheerfulness, an insouciance, that recalls the days when movies were content to be fun. Add that to the impressive technical achievement that went into creating the dragon, and you have something to acknowledge here. It isn&#x27;t great cinema, but I&#x27;m glad I saw it&quot;. Jami Bernard of &quot;The New York Daily News&quot; described the film as &quot;a movie for people young enough to keep dragons in the menageries of their imaginations&quot;. He went on to say that &quot;the dragon is the most believable part of the whole movie&quot;. Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a positive review, but criticized the fact that Sean Connery provided Draco&#x27;s voice, saying that &quot;if only Sean Connery didn&#x27;t have such a wonderfully distinctive voice, Draco might live and breathe as his own creature&quot;.

Despite the lukewarm reception, Rob Cohen is very fond of the film: &quot;&quot;Dragonheart&quot; pointed the way. There would be no &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; without &quot;Dragonheart&quot;. We were the first to do a full CG acting character. But it&#x27;s been very interesting. There&#x27;s a great love for that film among a certain audience. And I get a lot of reactions from very unexpected quarters to that film, with people who saw it when they were young, or kids or teenagers, or women who are now of an advanced age that love it, and New Age people who found the spirituality in it very moving. I&#x27;m very proud of it&quot;.

===Accolades===
==Legacy==
In the years following its release and strong home media sales, &quot;Dragonheart&quot; gained a following and is considered a cult classic. The character of Draco also gained popularity, often being ranked as one of cinema&#x27;s most memorable dragons, with fans noting him as ILM&#x27;s best work on the heels of &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and praising Sean Connery&#x27;s vocal performance. In 2006, Draco was ranked no. 6 on a Top 10 list of movie dragons by Karl Heitmueller for MTV News.

=== 20th anniversary ===
On various days throughout the year in Toronto, the AMC Yonge &amp; Dundas 24 theater screens a fully restored &quot;20th anniversary edition&quot; of &quot;Dragonheart&quot; with never-before-seen footage, enhanced visual effects, and a digitally remastered soundtrack. On May 31, 2016, celebrating the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary, a retrospective article was published on the making of &quot;Dragonheart&quot; featuring Scott Squires and Phil Tippett, among others who worked on the film.

=== Sequel and prequels ===
A direct-to-video sequel to the film, &quot;&quot;, was released in 2000, followed by three prequels: &quot;Dragonheart 3: The Sorcerer&#x27;s Curse&quot; in 2015, &quot;&quot; in 2017, and &quot;&quot; in 2020.

==Potential remake==
In a 2013 MTV interview about his then-upcoming film &quot;5-25-77&quot;, &quot;Dragonheart&quot; creator Patrick Read Johnson expressed a desire to remake the film with Sean Connery and Liam Neeson, his original choice for Bowen, before Universal fired Johnson from the project. In April 2016, Matthew Feitshans, screenwriter of the &quot;Dragonheart&quot; prequels, said that Universal wanted to use the prequels to keep the film series&#x27; momentum up, mentioning the possibility and hopes of them leading to a big-budget remake of the original film. In 2018, Patrick Read Johnson reiterated that he was still interested in the project.

<text>Playwrights Horizons is a not-for-profit American Off-Broadway theater located in New York City dedicated to the support and development of contemporary American playwrights, composers, and lyricists, and to the production of their new work.

Under the leadership of artistic director Adam Greenfield and former managing director Leslie Marcus, Playwrights Horizons encourages the new work of veteran writers while nurturing an emerging generation of theater artists. Writers are supported through every stage of their growth with a series of development programs: script and score evaluations, commissions, readings, musical theater workshops, Studio and Mainstage productions.

==History==
Playwrights Horizons was founded in 1971 at the Clark Center Y by Robert Moss, before moving to 42nd Street in 1977 where it was one of the original theaters that started Theater Row by converting adult entertainment venues into off Broadway theaters. The current building was built on the site of a former burlesque, which previously served as the off-Broadway Maidman Playhouse between 1960 and 1966.

André Bishop served as Artistic Director from 1981 to 1991, followed by Don Scardino who served through 1995. Tim Sanford served as Artistic Director from 1996 until July 2020, serving as &quot;outgoing Artistic Director&quot; during the 2020-2021 season. Adam Greenfield took over as Artistic Director in July 2020. 

Playwrights Horizons has worked with over 375 writers and is the recipient of numerous awards and honors. In 2005, it was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation, which was made possible through a donation by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.

Playwrights Horizons&#x27; auxiliary programs include the Playwrights Horizons Theater School, which is affiliated with NYU&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts, and Ticket Central, a central box office that supports the off-Broadway performing arts community.

<doc id="1011180" wikidata="Q897232" url="?curid=1011180" title="Bragança Paulista">
<text>Bragança Paulista is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. The population is 170,533 (2020 est.) in an area of 512.6 km². The elevation is 817 m.

The city is famous for its traditional sausages, with several establishments claiming to sell the &quot;real Bragança sausage&quot;. Bragança has become a commuter town due to its proximity to São Paulo and Campinas. As a result, real estate is developing at a fast pace and several gated communities have sprung up all over town.

The city is served by Arthur Siqueira Airport dedicated to general aviation.

==History==
The city was founded in December 15, 1763 as a settlement next to a small chapel and was originally called Conceição do Jaguari. The founders were Antonio Pires Pimentel and his wife, Ignácia da Silva Pimentel. By February 1765, the settlement was officially recognized and renamed as Distrito de Paz e Freguesia de Conceição do Jaguari. In October of 1767, the location was elevated to the condition of village and renamed as Village of New Bragança (Nova Bragança, after Bragança, Portugal). By 1856, the village of Nova Bragança was broken off from the township of Atibaia, becoming the town of Bragança.

== Transport ==

=== Highways ===

* Rodovia Fernao Dias (BR-381) - São Paulo to Belo Horizonte

* Rodovia Captain Balduíno (SP-8) - Pinhalzinho, Pedra Bela, Socorro, Lindóia and Águas de Lindóia, forming part of BR 146, which connects Bragança Paulista to the city of Patos de Minas.

* Rodovia Benevenutto Moretto (SP-95) - Tuiuti, Amparo. Pedreira and Jaguariúna.

* Rodovia Alkindar M. Junqueira (SP-63) - Itatiba (Jundiaí) (Campinas)

* Rodovia Padre Aldo Boline (SP-63) - Piracaia

* João Hermenegildo Oliveira Bypass - Connects Rodovia Fernão Dias near Vargem

* Rodovia D. Pedro I (SP-65) - which connects the Rodovia Anhanguera in the Campinas section to the Rodovia Presidente Dutra in the Jacareí section. (The highway does not pass through Bragança Paulista, but cuts through the Estância de Atibaia, a neighboring city to the south).

== Sports ==
In sports, the most notable football (soccer) team in the city is Bragantino, which plays at Estádio Nabi Abi Chedid, and was the 1990 Campeonato Paulista champion and 1991 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A runner-up.

The area also has a purportedly good golf course and residential community, Quinta da Baroneza Golf Course.

== Attractions ==
One of the town&#x27;s main attractions is Taboão Lake (Lago do Taboão), which houses a number of bars and restaurants. The lakeside is crowded on weekends with many people both inside and outside the bars. 

==Geography==
=== Climate ===
Bragança Paulista has a subtropical climate with hot summers and dry winters.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia Telefônica Brasileira until 1973, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

==Notable people==
*Prika Amaral, Brazilian guitarrist and front woman of thrash metal band Nervosa
*Suzane von Richthofen, Brazilian murderer.

<text>Kirklees Stadium, currently known as the John Smith&#x27;s Stadium for sponsorship reasons, is a multi-purpose stadium in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, England. Since 1994, it has been the home ground of Huddersfield Town Association Football Club and Huddersfield Giants Rugby League Football Club, both of whom moved from Leeds Road.

The stadium was a venue for the Rugby League World Cup in 1995, 2000, 2013 and 2021, in addition to the 1999 Rugby Union World Cup. It is owned by both clubs, as well as Kirklees Council. Its naming rights have passed from constructors Alfred McAlpine to pharmaceutical company Galpharm International in 2004, then to John Smith&#x27;s Brewery eight years later.

==Stadium==
During planning and construction, the stadium was referred to as the Kirklees Stadium which is still its official name. It was built by Alfred McAlpine, designed by Populous and was awarded the RIBA Building of the Year award for 1995.

The decision to build a new stadium for Huddersfield Town and Huddersfield Giants was made in August 1992. Construction began the following year and it was completed in time for the 1994–95 season, enabling the clubs to move to their new base after 86 years at Leeds Road and 114 years at Fartown respectively, with the Rugby club sharing Leeds Road from 1992 to 1994.

When the stadium opened only the two side stands (the Riverside and Kilner Bank stands) were ready. The South Stand was opened in December 1994. Construction on the North (Panasonic) Stand began in 1996 and it was completed in 1998, bringing the overall capacity of the stadium to approximately 24,500. The estimated cost of construction was £40 million.

A ski slope will be built next to the stadium.

===Ownership===
Initially, the stadium was owned by a consortium made up of Kirklees Metropolitan Council, Huddersfield Town A.F.C. and Huddersfield Giants in a 40:40:20 proportion. Following the purchase of Huddersfield Town A.F.C. from the administrators in 2003, Ken Davy became chairman of both sports clubs, which were owned by companies he controls, Sporting Pride. The present ownership of the stadium is Kirklees Metropolitan Council 40%, Huddersfield Town FC 40%, and Huddersfield Giants 20%. The current Managing director of the stadium company is Gareth Davis who succeeded Ralph Rimmer in 2010. On 24 December 2009, Huddersfield Town announced that 40% of the shares owned by Huddersfield Sporting Pride would be transferred to the football club, owned by current chairman Dean Hoyle, but the deal was delayed due to a rent dispute between Davy and Hoyle. The deal was finally completed on 3 September 2013.

=== Sponsorship ===
From 1994 until 2004 the stadium was known as the Alfred McAlpine Stadium. Alfred McAlpine had been the main construction contractor and its name was part of the payment contract for ten years. The company elected not to renew its sponsorship which was taken up by Galpharm Healthcare, leading to the new name. Individual stands are sponsored by local businesses. On 19 July 2012, it was announced that the brewery firm, Heineken had bought the sponsorship rights for the stadium using their domestic John Smith&#x27;s Brewery as the beneficiary, and as such the stadium was renamed as The John Smith&#x27;s Stadium on 1 August as part of a five-year deal. In December 2016, this was extended for a further five years.

==Layout==
===North Stand===
Capacity – 2,750 (seating)
The North Stand, known as the Big Red Stand for sponsorship reasons, is located behind the goal post at the north end of the ground. It has two tiers and houses 16 hospitality boxes and is completely seated. The lower tier contains temporary seats that can be removed for concerts or other events.
===East Stand (Kilner Bank)=== 
Capacity – 7,000 (seating)
The East Stand known as the Kilner Bank Stand is a large single tier stand that runs along the side of the pitch and is completely covered seating. The stand also holds the TV gantry. It gets its name from the fact the stand is built under and partly into the large hill named Kilner Bank behind it.
===South Stand===
Capacity – 4,054 (seating)
The Magic Rock Brewing Stand as it is known for sponsorship reasons is an all seated stand built into a bank and is completely covered as well as having the big screen. The stand is generally the away stand for visiting fans in both football and rugby, for football, it used to be completely for away fans but it is now shared with home fans with segregation netting. From 2017–18 a new segregation system was implemented with away fans given 2,500 tickets instead of 2,000.

===West Stand (Riverside)===
Capacity – 10,365 (seating)
The West stand is the main stand and is known as the Core Stand for sponsorship or Riverside Stand. It has two tiers and 26 hospitality boxes and incorporates the player changing rooms, tunnel, dug out, ticket office and club shop. It takes its name from the River Colne that passes behind it, a footbridge crosses over the river to the car parks and estates behind the ground.

==Events==
===Football===
It hosted its first match on 20 August 1994 when Huddersfield Town lost 1–0 to Wycombe Wanderers in the Second Division. Only the two touchline stands had been completed, and 13,334 spectators attended. Simon Garner scored the goal for the visitors.

On 4 June 1999, it hosted England under-21 in a 2000 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification Group 5 match against Sweden, a 3–0 win for England.

On 20 August 2017, it held its first Premier League game, with Huddersfield&#x27;s Aaron Mooy scoring the only goal of a 1–0 win over Newcastle United in front of a crowd of 24,128.

The record for a football match is 24,263 for a Premier League match between Huddersfield Town and Liverpool on 20 October 2018.

===Rugby League===
Rugby League World Cup matches were held at the stadium in 1995, 2000 and 2013. Seven Great Britain rugby league internationals have been held at the ground, from 1998 to 2007. Since the Great Britain team was split into home nations, it has hosted four England rugby league internationals, including a 42–0 win over Ireland in the group stage of the 2013 World Cup, in front of 24,375 spectators. It was the ground&#x27;s first sell-out crowd, and its record attendance.

On 29 January 2019, it was announced that the John Smith&#x27;s Stadium would play host to a quarter-final of the 2021 Rugby League World Cup.

The results of international matches are as follows;

The stadium has held semi-finals of the Challenge Cup and the finals of the now defunct Regal Trophy competition were held there in 1995 and 1996. Wigan Warriors won on both occasions. The stadium has also hosted three of Bradford Bulls&#x27; World Club Challenge matches, from 2002 to 2006. The Huddersfield Giants attendance record at the venue stands at 15,629 for a match against rivals Leeds Rhinos on 10 February 2008.

===Rugby Union===
Despite Huddersfield not being a strong rugby union area, the stadium has been used for four full cap international rugby union matches. It hosted three qualifying matches for the 1999 Rugby World Cup and one match in the pool. Two of the matches saw teams pass 100 points: England beat the Netherlands 110–0 in a qualifier and New Zealand defeated Italy 101–3 in the pool.

===Concerts===
The first concerts at the stadium were on 25 and 26 July 1995 by American band R.E.M., attended by around 80,000 people and providing a £3 million boom to local businesses. The Eagles, Bryan Adams and the Beautiful South also performed there in the 1990s, followed four years later by Bon Jovi in June 2001.

After three years with no performances, Blue played at the stadium on the 31 July 2004 with Girls Aloud and Darius supporting, in an event to reveal Galpharm&#x27;s new sponsorship of the venue. The following two summers, Elton John and Lulu in 2005, and Bryan Adams again in 2006, performed. After a gap of twelve years, Little Mix were booked to perform in July 2018 followed by Take That in June 2019. Green Day, Weezer and Fall Out Boy appeared in June 2022 after the concert was postponed by two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Muse performed at the stadium in June 2023 as part of their Will of the People World Tour.

<doc id="1011185" wikidata="Q316297" url="?curid=1011185" title="Baldassare Longhena">
<text>Baldassare Longhena (1598 – 18 February 1682) was an Italian architect, who worked mainly in Venice, where he was one of the greatest exponents of Baroque architecture of the period.

==Biography==
Born in Venice, Longhena studied under the architect Vincenzo Scamozzi and after Scamozzi&#x27;s death completed his monumental Procuratie Nuove in St. Mark&#x27;s Square, a complex of imposing residences and offices for officials of the Venetian Republic that gives the square its appearance today.

His best-known work is the elegantly decorated Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute begun in 1631 to thank the Virgin for the city&#x27;s deliverance from the plague. This two domed church on the peninsula between the Canal Grande and the Zattere is one of the city&#x27;s best-known landmarks. The main entrance, modeled on the Roman triumphal arch, was later copied in successive churches and cathedrals, in Venice and elsewhere.

He designed many other churches in the city, among them the Chiesa dell&#x27;Ospedaletto and Santa Maria di Nazareth built between 1656 and 1680, although the façade of the latter church was designed by Giuseppe Sardi (1624–1699). He also designed the Palazzo Belloni Battagia and the Palazzo Giustiniani Lolin, both facing the Canal Grande.

One of his largest designs was the Chioggia Cathedral, executed between 1624 and 1647. On the completion of the cathedral he designed two other palaces on the Grand Canal of Venice, Ca&#x27; Rezzonico and Ca&#x27; Pesaro, both completed after his death.

Between 1641 and 1680 he designed the new library, the grand staircase, the monastery façade, the Novitiate building, the sick-room and the guest-rooms of the San Giorgio Maggiore monastery.

Baldassare Longhena died at Venice in 1682.

==Critical reception==
Longhena developed the style of his master Vincenzo Scamozzi and Andrea Palladio. As Branko Mitrović states in his book on renaissance architecture: &quot;Scamozzi...adjusted the central intercolumnation of the main portico so that the edges of columns can be seen from the end of a circular hall. Visually, this is a way to suggest from inside that there is another formal space beyond the entrance door... Baldassare Longhena used a similar system of non-orthogonal axes in Santa Maria della Salute in Venice. As with Palladio, it is unclear whether Longhena intended to form such visual axes or whether they are a by-product of his complex geometries.&quot;

<doc id="1011188" wikidata="Q620724" url="?curid=1011188" title="Lop Desert">
<text>The Lop Desert, or the Lop Depression, is a desert extending from Korla eastwards along the foot of the Kuruk-tagh (meaning Dry Mountain) to the former terminal Tarim Basin in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China. It is an almost perfectly flat expanse with no topographic relief. Lake Bosten in the northwest lies at an altitude of , while the Lop Nur in the southeast is only 250 m lower.

The desert lies within a sediment basin that was separated from the Taklamakan basin in the Pliocene and lowered towards the east by a tectonic dip-slip fault.
The rivers Tarim and Konqi used to flow in the rift valley between both basins towards the south until they dried up around 1971 at Tikanlik. The road 218 from Korla to Qakilik follows the river beds. The desert is bounded in the west by this road, in the north by the Kuruk Tagh mountain range, in the east by the Bei Shan range (between Barkol Tagh and Bogda Shan), in the southeast by the Kumtag Desert and in the south by the Aqikkol valley.

==Geography==
The Lop Desert is on the whole flat, but with three slightly more depressed areas which might form lakes if filled with water - the Lop Nur dried basin, Kara-Koshun dried basin and the Taitema Lake basin. These formed, at one time or another, the terminal lakes of the Tarim-Konque-Qarqan river system. The Tarim River changes its course through time, and therefore the location of the terminal lake also changes, causing some confusion amongst the early explorers as to the exact location of Lop Nur, and the lake was thus referred to as the &quot;Wandering Lake.&quot;

In the past Lop Nur was a huge marsh in the eastern part of Xinjiang. Now the region is a broad, unbroken expanse of clay intermingled with sand. The clay, mostly of a yellow or yellow-grey color, is hard and thickly sprinkled with fine gravel. There are benches, flattened ridges and tabular masses of consolidated clay (yardangs) that are in a distinctly defined laminae, three stories being sometimes superimposed one upon the other, while their vertical faces are abraded, and often undercut, by the wind. The formations themselves are separated by parallel gullies or wind furrows, 6 to 20 feet deep, all sculptured in the direction of the prevailing northeast to southwest wind. There is no drifting sand or sand dunes, except in the south towards the outlying foothills of the Altyn-Tagh.
==Climate==
The climate of Lop Desert is extremely arid, a study in 1984 gives a mean annual precipitation of generally less than , in another study in 2008 it was recorded as . In the depression centre below in elevation, aridity can be expected to be much more extreme. Relative humidity of the atmosphere frequently dropped to zero, with air temperature as high as . Annual evaporation was estimated in 1984 to be between and in 1984, meaning that a lake with about in water depth will dry out within less than two years if cut off entirely from its feeding source. In 2008 the annual evaporation was reported as .

Historically there were periods when the area was more favorable to farming and settlement than today. Studies showed that the area experienced seven major climate changes since the end of the Pleistocene.

==Lop Nur==

There are numerous indications that suggest the presence of an extensive lake in this region which is now completely desiccated. These indications include salt-stained depressions of a lacustrine appearance; traces of former lacustrine shorelines, more or less parallel and concentric; the presence in places of vast quantities of fresh water mollusc shells (species of &quot;Lymnaea&quot; and &quot;Planorbis&quot;); the existence of belts of dead poplars; patches of dead tamarisks and extensive beds of withered reeds, all of these are always on top of the yardangs, never in the wind-etched furrows.

In &quot;Hanshu&quot; (the Book of Han, a history of China completed in 111), where it was called Puchang Hai (蒲昌海), the lake was suggested to be of a great size, with a dimension of 300 to 400 &quot;li&quot;, roughly , in length and breadth. It was also called Yan Ze (鹽澤) in &quot;Shiji&quot;, which means &quot;salt marsh&quot;, indicating that the lake was salty. The lake had already shrunk considerably by the Qing dynasty. It had shifted its location to Kara-Koshun by the latter half of the nineteenth century, then back again to Lop Nur in 1921 through human intervention. The building of dams by Chinese garrisons in the twentieth century blocked the water from the rivers feeding in to Lop Nur and it is now primarily salt flats. The dried-up Lop Nur basin is covered with a salt crust from thick.

==Flora and fauna==
Natural vegetation is sparse in the region and poor in the number of species. A scientific expedition to the Lop Nur region in 1979-1982 collected only 36 species of plants, belonging to 13 families (mainly Chenopodiaceae and Compositae) and 26 genera. The expedition also collected only 127 species of animals (23 mammals, 91 birds, 7 reptiles, and 1 amphibian).

Archaeologist Sven Hedin who travelled in the region in the late nineteenth as well as the twentieth century was able to travel by boat up the rivers to the lake and saw a multitude of wildlife. However, many wild animals, such as tiger, wolf and wild hog which had been found by former explorers, have now disappeared. Nevertheless, it is still one of the last refuges of wild Bactrian camel (Camelus ferus) in the world. These wild camels may be found in the reed oases on the north edge of the desert. Poplars forests and tamarix shrubs used to be extensively distributed along the lower Tarim River Valley forming the so-called &quot;Green Corridor&quot;, but as the lower Tarim River has been drying since 1972 due to the construction of dams, they have greatly deteriorated and some have disappeared. The Lop Nur Wild Camel National Nature Reserve was created in 2001 to preserve wild Bactrian camels and other wildlife in the region.

==Sand storms==
The whole of this region is swept bare of sand by the terrific sand storms (burans) of the spring months and the particles of wind-blown sand act like a sand blast. Abrasion of the rocks forms yardangs. The desert itself is abraded, filed, eroded and carried bodily away into the network of lakes in which the Tarim River wanders. The sand also blows across the lower, constantly shifting waterways of the Tarim River and deposits itself onto gigantic dunes that choke the eastern end of the Taklamakan Desert. The extreme weather and ever moving sand dunes have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people. The esteemed biologist Peng Jiamu disappeared in the desert in 1980.

<doc id="1011189" wikidata="Q1362631" url="?curid=1011189" title="Run for Cover (Gary Moore album)">
<text>Run for Cover is the fifth solo studio album by Northern Irish guitarist Gary Moore, released on 2 September 1985. It is often considered his breakthrough album.

The album includes the top 5 single &quot;Out in the Fields&quot; and a re-recording of the song &quot;Empty Rooms&quot;, originally from Moore&#x27;s previous album &quot;Victims of the Future&quot;, which became one of Moore&#x27;s biggest solo successes, reaching No. 23 on the UK charts.

The album features many of Moore&#x27;s musical friends, including Deep Purple bassist/vocalist Glenn Hughes, Paul Thompson of Roxy Music and Phil Lynott from Thin Lizzy. Lynott and Moore trade lead vocals on &quot;Out in the Fields&quot;, while Lynott sings alone on &quot;Military Man&quot;, an old Grand Slam track. &quot;Out in the Fields&quot; is about the turmoil in their native Ireland. Lynott also provided vocals for a re-recording of the Thin Lizzy classic &quot;Still in Love with You&quot;, on which Moore originally played guitar; the track was initially issued as a B-side of &quot;Out in the Fields&quot;, but is included on later remastered versions of the album.

<text>Frank Elmore Ross (April 2, 1874 – September 21, 1960) was an American astronomer and physicist. He was born in San Francisco, California and died in Altadena, California. In 1901 he received his doctorate from the University of California. In 1905 he became director of the International Latitude Observatory station at Gaithersburg, Maryland. In 1915 he became a physicist for Eastman Kodak Company at Rochester, New York. He accepted a position at Yerkes Observatory in 1924 and worked there until his retirement in 1939.

His first important work was the calculation of the first reliable orbit of Saturn&#x27;s moon Phoebe in 1905, and he also calculated orbits for Jupiter&#x27;s satellites Himalia and Elara. When working for Eastman Kodak he investigated photographic emulsions and the design of wide-angle lenses for astronomical use.

At Yerkes Observatory he was the successor to the late E. E. Barnard, inheriting Barnard&#x27;s collection of photographic plates. Ross decided to repeat the same series of images and compare the results with a blink comparator. In doing so, he discovered 379 new variable stars and over 1000 stars of high proper motion. Some of the high–proper motion stars turned out to be quite nearby, and many of these stars (such as Ross 154) are still widely known by the catalog number he gave them.

During the opposition of Mars in 1926 he photographed the planet in different colors, using the Mount Wilson 60-inch telescope. The following year he obtained ultraviolet pictures of Venus, which showed structure in its cloud cover for the first time.

In 1935, he published an article describing the design of a two-lens system to correct for the coma aberration of parabolic mirrors, including those at the 60-inch and 100-inch telescopes at Mount Wilson Observatory. Such a corrector is since known as the Ross corrector.

The crater Ross on Mars is named after him, and the crater Ross on the Moon is jointly named after him and James Clark Ross. He was awarded the Franklin Institute&#x27;s John Price Wetherill Medal in 1928.

<doc id="1011196" wikidata="Q10510479" url="?curid=1011196" title="Palm Trees and Power Lines">
<text>Palm Trees and Power Lines is the second studio album by American rock band Sugarcult, released on April 13, 2004 through Fearless and Artemis Records. A year after the release of their third studio album &quot;Start Static&quot; (2001), Kenny Livingston became their new drummer. Shortly afterwards, they started writing new material for the follow-up album. Recording started in March 2003 and ended in September 2003, in between various tours. Sessions were held at Full Kilt Studio and Third Stone Recording, both in North Hollywood, California, with producer Gavin MacKillop. &quot;Palm Trees and Power Lines&quot; is a pop-punk and power pop album that recalled the work of Blink-182.

&quot;Palm Trees and Power Lines&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics, some praising the quality of songwriting, while others felt that the music was uninspiring and lacked originality. It peaked number 46 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Following the album&#x27;s recording, the band went on a headlining tour of the United States and supported Good Charlotte in Japan and the United Kingdom. Following another support slot, this time for MxPx and Simple Plan, &quot;Memory&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single in March 2004. The band then went on headlining stints of the US and Japan, leading into an appearance on the Warped Tour. She&#x27;s the Blade&quot; was released as the second single form the album in August 2004.

==Background and production==
Sugarcult released their third studio album &quot;Start Static&quot; in August 2001, which had two successful singles &quot;Stuck in America&quot; and &quot;Bouncing Off the Walls&quot;, through Ultimatum Music in the United States and Epitaph Records in Europe. Drummer Ben Davis went to rehab and was replaced by Lefty drummer Kenny Livingston in September 2002; Davis officially left the group by Thanksgiving. With Livingston&#x27;s arrival, the group was impressed by his skill level and inspired the members to improve their own skills on their respective instruments. The band then rented a rehearsal room and spend each day working on new material, writing all of the songs that would later feature on their next album in less than two months. The band supported &quot;Start Static&quot; with two years of tours, running into February 2003. By this point, frontman Tim Pagnotta had accumulated 16 new songs, with which he was hoping to expand on the &quot;moodier&quot; tracks from &#x27;Start Static&quot;.

Pre-production was done at Studio 9 in Los Angeles, lasting for three weeks. Recording took place between March and June 2003 at Full Kilt Studio and Third Stone Recording in North Hollywood, California with Gavin MacKillop producing the proceedings. From May to September, the group went on a number of tours across Japan and Europe, with mixing and further recording sessions sprinkled in between. John Nooney, Mauro Rubbi and Trent Slatton, the latter of whom also did programming, served as the Pro-Tools engineers during the sessions. Wesley Seidman acted as assistant engineer at Third Stone Recording. Additional production was then done by Pagnotta.

Several friends contributed instrumentation or vocals: Tim Cullen of Summercamp (additional backing vocals), Alain Johannes (additional guitar), Nooney and Ariel Rechtshaid of the Hippos (keyboards). Mixing was split across a few people at different studios: Tom Lord-Alge at South Beach Studio (&quot;She&#x27;s the Blade&quot;, &quot;Crying&quot;, &quot;Memory&quot;, &quot;Back to California&quot; and &quot;Over&quot;), Mark Trombino at Chalice Recording Studios (&quot;Worst December&quot; and &quot;Champagne&quot;) with assistance from Alan Mason, Mackillop (&quot;Destination Anywhere&quot;, &quot;What You Say&quot;, &quot;Head Up&quot; and &quot;Counting Stars&quot;), and Evan Frankfort (&quot;Sign Off&quot;). Brian Gardner mastered the recordings at Bernie Grudman Mastering in Hollywood, California.

==Composition==
Musically, the sound &quot;Palm Trees and Power Lines&quot; has been described as pop punk and power pop, drawing comparisons to Blink-182. The title for the album was the result of DeSantis standing in the studio&#x27;s back alley, look up at the skyline, where all he could see was palm trees and electrical lines, a view that Pagnotta saw as a combination of &quot;beauty and harsh reality co-existing.&quot; It is named after the scenery in California where the band members live. Retaining the format of &quot;Start Static&quot;, &quot;Palm Trees and Power Lines&quot; consists of several uptempo rock songs with ballads placed throughout.
All of the lyrics were written by Pagnotta, while all of the music was credited to Pagnotta and the band. He would show a rough sketch of a song to the rest of the group, at which point they&#x27;d flesh it out. The tracks talk about the preceding two and half years of Pagnotta&#x27;s life as a touring musician, touching on the theme of being a traveller, determination to return home provoked by a relationship, with psychological and social struggles. All of the material that ended up on the album was written over a six-week period. DeSantis referred to the album as a &quot;document of the end of our innocence; we had toured for over 2 years non-stop and kind of became alienated from our old selves&quot;.

===Tracks 1–5===
&quot;She&#x27;s the Blade&quot; was written when Pagnotta was playing his guitar in his bedroom. He was noodling with a chord progression that he thought was reminiscent of a transcending keyboard part – which he had admiration for Elvis Costello&#x27;s attempts at this, namely on his track &quot;Radio Radio&quot;. Pagnotta began singing melody lines over his chosen progression until he came up with the lyric &quot;She&#x27;s the blade and you&#x27;re just paper&quot;, with the rest of the song falling into place afterwards. DeSantis visited Pagnotta and the pair worked on guitar parts, one of which eventually became a keyboard part that Rechtshaid would play on the final recording. Early versions of the song included an intro guitar riff but was scrapped in favour of Livingston&#x27;s count-in. Similarly the track used to have a middle section of 12-bars that Pagnotta referred to as &quot;bad classic rock&quot;, which was removed at MacKillop&#x27;s insistence.

&quot;Crying&quot; was written over the course of six months, with Pagnotta only having a guitar riff for the pre-chorus and main chorus for long period of time. He said the bridge section was reminiscent of U2, specifically the use of a floor tom to keep time, as heard on some U2 songs on their &quot;War&quot; (1983) album. He added a guitar solo to the track, three days prior to it being mixed. Though Pagnotta disliked it, MacKillop kept it in the final mix. Cullen is singing harmonies on the song; during the recording of this, and since he felt the ending was too sparse, Pagnotta came up with a lyric for the song&#x27;s outro. &quot;Memory&quot; was first song finished for the album, dating at least a year prior to when they recorded it. Pagnotta wrote it about a person he met while touring in Boston, Massachusetts. During this time he had just gotten out of a relationship and was cautious about starting another. He began daydreaming about how a relationship with the person from Boston wouldn&#x27;t work. He then picked up his guitar and started strumming chords, writing what would ultimately become &quot;Memory&quot;.

Pagnotta kept &quot;Worst December&quot; a secret for sometime, he reasoned that as the lyrics were &quot;a bit confessional in regards to a relationship&quot;, he worried that his partner would find the lyric sheet and they&#x27;d &quot;have to confront our issues.&quot; The music of the track was influenced by Bright Life, a band from the group&#x27;s hometown, who Pagnotta applauded for the usage of open chords in their material. Livingston keeps time in the song using the edge of his tom, resulting in a clock-like ticking sound which gave the track &quot;a nice ambient space.&quot; It ties into one of the two lyrical themes (space), with the other about being away from home. &quot;Back to California&quot;, which had a similar structure to &quot;Stay Together for the Kids&quot; by Blink-182, was written about returning home from touring solely to break up with a partner. When Pagnotta showed the track to Livingston, the pair started talking about Jimmy Eat World&#x27;s use of hand percussion, which found its way into the song&#x27;s intro. It featured several stacked vocal parts and call-and-response harmonies during the chorus, which Pagnotta heard when listening to Carpenters albums during his childhood.

===Tracks 6–12===
During an off-day in the first week of pre-production, Pagnotta arrived at the studio early and began playing drums while vocalising melodies. He based this off the group Spoon, whose music arrangements revolved around the drums and vocals. He began singing what would become &quot;Destination Anywhere&quot;; when Livingston arrived at the studio the pair started fleshing out the remainder of the song. At the group&#x27;s next practice session bassist Airin Older came up with a riff that Pagnotta said was a mix between &quot;New Year&#x27;s Day&quot; by U2 and several Motown tracks, while DeSantis added stabs in the vein of British mod music. Upon MacKillop hearing it, he remarked it sounded like INXS, to which the band was &quot;all shocked in horror.&quot; The vocals for the track had to be re-recorded twice over as MacKillop thought it need to come across as intimate-sounding; a moog riff was added in the bridge.

&quot;Champagne&quot; is about Pagnotta&#x27;s relationship with the group&#x27;s former drummer Davis. He started writing it before Davis&#x27; departure when he noticed how different Davis was acting since he became an alcoholic. It bounces between first-and-third person views; Pagnotta referred to it as the Cars &quot;on steroids.&quot; It was the last track finished during recording, and was mixed by Trombino, which Pagnotta felt added a denser layer to the song that they hadn&#x27;t thought about. &quot;What You Say&quot; resulted from an in-the-moment jam session between Livingston and Pagnotta. It was compared to the Foo Fighters; the guitar riff specifically recalled the one heard in &quot;Breed&quot; by Nirvana. &quot;Over&quot; existed as a verse section for a few weeks; Pagnotta didn&#x27;t feel it was fleshed out enough to share with the rest of the band. When the band was recording drums, Pagnotta showed Livingston and MacKillop a complete chorus section. The trio worked on it and planned to record it the following day, which by then they tracked it in 30 minutes. DeSantis suggested a rhythm break before the last chorus, which was then added to the track.

&quot;Head Up&quot; evolved out of an idea that was written backstage during a show while in Belgium. The opening act was playing onstage upstairs while Pagnotta was downstairs attempting to track the idea into his recorder. Unable to hear the key of the chords, he recorded a tiny bit and fleshed out the song during soundcheck with the rest of the band the following day. It talks about remaining positive when you&#x27;re doing something that other people may not like, something that Pagnotta felt after dropping out of education to focus on music. The chord progression for &quot;Counting Stars&quot; existed for about two months, during this time Pagnotta was unable to come up with any melodies or lyrics. Pagnotta said he received test results from his doctor saying he was ill, only for further results nine days later to say he was okay. Between these results he wrote the lyrics to &quot;Counting Stars&quot;, which acted as &quot;an apology for anything I may have done wrong to hurt the world, people, friends.&quot; On the final recording, a friend of the band contributed what Pagnotta referred to as&quot;sounds with his guitar that sounded like animals dying.&quot; The closing track, &quot;Sign Off&quot;, was written by Pagnotta as he sat on the end of his bed. He explained that partway through the making of the album he felt lonely, confused and sad while questioning his life. It was recorded in the back room at the studio solely by Pagnotta, with some overdubs from MacKillop.

==Release==
On September 24, 2003, Sugarcult mentioned on their website that their next album would appear in February 2004. Between October and December 2003, the group embarked on a headlining US tour with support from Story of the Year, Plain White T&#x27;s, Jackson and Denver Harbor. During the stint, they played a number of new songs from their forthcoming album. Partway through the excursion, on November 20, 2003, the album&#x27;s title &quot;Palm Trees and Power Lines&quot; was revealed. Prior to the tour taking place, an acoustic version of &quot;Memory&quot; was included on the Fearless Records-helmed compilation &quot;Punk Goes Acoustic&quot;. On December 15, 2003, the album was given an updated release date – March 2004. Following this, the group supported Good Charlotte on their tour of the United Kingdom, before supporting them again on a tour of Japan in January 2004. During the same month, the band filmed a music video for &quot;Memory&quot;. On January 15, the band signed to Fearless Records. In January and February, the band supported MxPx and Simple Plan on their co-headlining US tour. On February 25, the album&#x27;s track listing was revealed. The music video for &quot;Memory&quot; was posted online on March 11, 2004. The song was released to radio on March 16; the CD single featured &quot;Blackout&quot; and an acoustic version of &quot;Memory&quot;.

After being originally scheduled for release on March 9, &quot;Palm Trees and Power Lines&quot; was eventually released on April 13. The artwork continues the Californian theme of the title with an actress in front of the palm trees and electrical lines that make up the album&#x27;s namesake. Though DeSantis claimed it wasn&#x27;t wholly a tribute to California, he explained that with the band frequently touring other countries &quot;you sort of have a concept of home, and the more you&#x27;re gone ... it becomes even more blurry, but it is home nonetheless. And California represents that for us.&quot; Ultimatum Music sold the rights to &quot;Palm Trees and Power Lines&quot; to Artemis Records, who partnered up with Fearless Records. Pagnotta explained they need a larger amount of label staff to handle the album; Ultimatum had downsized its operations while the group now worked with the same people at Artemis that had helped for &quot;Static Static&quot;. Epitaph wasn&#x27;t interested in the album, after struggling to break the band in the UK/Europe, resulting in Rykodisc handling the release for that region. The Japanese edition, released through independent label Maximum10, featured &quot;Blackout&quot; as a bonus track.

The group had to cancel the first week of touring for the album due to Pagnotta suffering from tinnitus. When touring restarted, the band did a round of acoustic shows; their headlining US tour continued into May, when they embarked on a Japanese tour. Following the release, the band performed on the Warped Tour between mid July and mid August. &quot;She&#x27;s the Blade&quot; was released to radio on August 31; the CD single featured a Mark Trombine mix of &quot;Destination Anywhere&quot;, a live version of &quot;Stuck in America&quot;, and the music video for &quot;She&#x27;s the Blade&quot;. The computer-generated video sees the group acting as doctors and operating on a girl; Pagnotta likened the clip to &quot;Weird Science&quot; (1985). In October and November, the group supported Green Day on their headlining US tour. The group closed the year supporting Blink-182 on their European tour. The band headlined the US Take Action Tour in February and March 2005, followed by another support slot for Green Day on their Japanese tour. They released their first video album, &quot;Back to Disaster&quot;, in November 2005, which featured footage from the previous few years of touring.

==Reception==

&quot;Palm Trees and Power Lines&quot; was met with mixed reviews from music critics. AllMusic reviewer Johnny Loftus said it &quot;might not be as direct&quot; as their past releases, &quot;meaning they want to trade a bit of the bubblegum for some mall-punk songwriting cred&quot;. He added that the &quot;hooks are more murky [...] perhaps the bandmembers are aiming for some &#x27;seriousness&#x27; this time around&quot;. &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; writer Mike Diver felt that the band had toned down the &quot;cheese and upped its angst&quot;, saying that have a &quot;collective ear for a pop tune&quot; that their contemporaries lacked. Though he summarised the album as &quot;throwaway stuff for sure,&quot; it was a &quot;blast while it lasts&quot;. Azeem Ahmad of &quot;musicOMH&quot; said the album was not &quot;original, there&#x27;s no question about that. But its brilliance lies in the fact that the best of other influences have been thrown into the equation, making a finished product that is pretty damn good&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot;″ Stephen Haag felt that it &quot;strives for the growth attained by the above-mentioned band, but comes up short&quot;. He explained that the reason was all the &quot;too much damn moping&quot;. He added that acts like Sugarcult are not &quot;popular for their introspection; they&#x27;re popular for their guitar hooks and general catchiness&quot;.

DJ of CMU Daily wrote that while it had &quot;few surprises on this long player, but there&#x27;s plenty of satisfying tracks and much evidence of a progression in the Californian band&#x27;s sound&quot;. The staff at &quot;Modern Fix&quot; saw it as a &quot;strong&quot; effort from the band, who &quot;keeps it sweet with some dreamy lyrics for the younger fans, while touching on a hard edge for the older listeners&quot;. &quot;Melodic&quot; writer Andrew Ellis said that apart from a &quot; few obligatory ballads which are just ok, this sweetheart of a CD shows that the band deserves to become an even bigger player in the game of major label rock&quot;. &quot;Rock Hard&quot; writer Marcus Schleutermann thought that the tracks were &quot;just as casual as the album title&quot;. He praised the band&#x27;s &quot;knack for beautiful vocal melodies and well-rounded arrangements, [...] but in this form it all sounds too good, boring to me and interchangeable&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewer Christian Hoard thought that for each &quot;woozily nostalgic or promisingly toothy moment [...] there&#x27;s a torrent of youthful wallowing on its way. The craftsmanship on Palm Trees shows Sugarcult are moving toward adulthood, but for now they&#x27;re still mad for sadness&quot;. The staff at &quot;Spin&quot; wrote that there was &quot;something kinda sweet about pop-punk bands that express their everydude empathy by being as uninspired as the kids they would love to reach&quot;.

&quot;Palm Trees and Power Lines&quot; sold 22,000 copies, reaching number 46 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

<text>Leonard Talmy is Professor Emeritus of linguistics and philosophy and Director Emeritus of the Center for Cognitive Science at the University at Buffalo in New York. Born on June 17, 1942, he received his Ph.D. in Linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1972. 

He is a prominent American linguist who has helped found and develop the area of cognitive semantics. His research has covered typologies and universals of semantic structure; the interaction between semantic structure and lexical, morphological, and syntactic structure; the relation of this to discourse, diachrony, culture, and evolution; and the implications of all this material for conceptual organization and cognitive theory. His pioneering and innovative work has been highly influential globally, with over 35,000 citations of it.

His work was the basis for the first, second, and third &quot;Talmyan Semantics Conference&quot; in China in 2019, 2020, and 2021. He was the recipient of the 2012 Gutenberg Research Award and 10,000 Euro prize from the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, Germany, for outstanding contributions to research in the area of linguistics. In 2011, he was honored as one of the three &quot;Founding Fathers&quot; of cognitive linguistics at the 10th Biannual Conference of the International Cognitive Linguistics Association. And he was elected a Fellow of the Cognitive Science Society in its 2002 inaugural selection of Fellows.

<text>The Desert of Hami (, Uyghur: Қумул Қумлуқи) is a section of the Gobi Desert in Xinjiang, China that occupies the space between the Tian Shan system on the north and the Nan-shan Mountains on the south, and is connected on the west with the Desert of Lop.

==Przhevalsky, 1879==
&quot;This classic account is that of Nikolai Przhevalsky, who crossed the desert from Hami (or Khumul) to Suchow in the summer of 1879.&quot;

The middle of the desert rises into a plateau across, which reaches an average elevation of and a maximum elevation of . On its northern and southern borders it is overtopped by two divisions of the Bey-san (Pe-shan) Mountains, which are isolated hills or groups of hills only a few hundred feet higher than the plateau. They are separated from the Kuruk-tagh by a well-marked bay of the former Central Asian Mediterranean (Lop Nur).

Between the northern division and the Karlyk-tagh range (or east Tian Shan), there is an undulating barren plain, in altitude and from north to south, sloping downwards from both north and south towards the middle, where lies the oasis of Hami (2,800 ft). Similarly, from the southern division of the Bey-san, a second plain slopes down for to the valley of the river Bulunzir (or Su-lai-ho), which comes out of China, from the south side of the Great Wall, and finally empties itself into the lake of Kalachi (or Kara-nor). From the Bulunzir the same plain continues southwards at a level of to the foot of the Nan-shan Mountains. The total breadth of the desert here, from north to south, is .

Its general character is that of an undulating plain, dotted over with occasional elevations of clay, which present the appearance of walls, table-topped mounds and broken towers (jardangs), the surface of the plain being strewn with gravel and destitute of vegetation. The swelling or undulating plain between these two ranges of the Bey-san measures about across and is traversed by several stretches of high ground having generally an east–west direction.

==Futterer, 1896==
Karl Josef Futterer, who crossed the same desert twenty years after Przhevalsky, agrees generally in his description of it, but supplements the account of the latter explorer with several particulars. He observes that the ranges in this part of the Gobi are much worn down and wasted, like the Kuruk-tagh farther west and the tablelands of Southeast Mongolia farther east, through the effects of century-long insolation, wind erosion, great and sudden changes of temperature, chemical action and occasional water erosion. Vast areas towards the north consist of expanses of gently sloping clay, intermingled with gravel. He points out also that the greatest accumulations of sand and other products of wind scouring do not occur in the deepest parts of the depressions but at the outlets of the valleys and glens, and along the foot of the ranges which flank the depressions on the south. Wherever water has been, desert scrub is found, such as tamarisks, &quot;Dodartia orientalis&quot;, &quot;Agriophyllum gobicum&quot;, &quot;Calligonium sinnex&quot;, and &quot;Lycium ruthenicum&quot;, but all with their roots elevated on little mounds in the same way as the tamarisks grow in the Taklamakan and the desert of Lop.

Farther east, towards central Mongolia, the relations, says Futterer, are the same as along the Hami-Su-chow route, except that the ranges have lower and broader crests, and the detached hills are more denuded and more disintegrated. Between the ranges occur broad, flat, cauldron-shaped valleys and basins, almost destitute of life except for a few hares and a few birds, such as the crow and the pheasant, and with scanty vegetation, but no great accumulations of drift-sand. The rocks are severely weathered on the surface, a thick layer of the coarser products of denudation covers the flat parts and climbs a good way up the flanks of the mountain ranges, but all the finer material, sand and clay has been blown away partly southeast into the Ordos, partly into the Chinese provinces of Shen-si and Shan-si, where it is deposited as loess, and partly west, where it chokes all the southern parts of the basin of the Tarim. In these central parts of the Gobi, as indeed in all other parts except the desert of Lop and Ordos, the prevailing winds blow from the west and northwest. These winds are warm in summer, and it is they which in the desert of Hami bring the fierce sandstorms or burans. The wind does blow also from the northeast, but it is then cold and often brings snow, which clears the air of the usual dust haze.

In summer, great heat is encountered here on the relatively low (3000–4600 feet), gravelly expanses on the north and on those of the south (4000–5000 feet); but on the higher ground between, which in the Pe-shan ranges ascends to , there is great cold even in summer, and a wide daily range of temperature. Above the broad and deep accumulations of the products of denudation which have been brought down by the rivers from the Tian Shan ranges (e.g. the Karlyk-tagh) on the north and from the Nanshan on the south, and have filled up the cauldron-shaped valleys, there rises a broad swelling, built up of granitic rocks, crystalline schists and metamorphosed sedimentary rocks of both Archaic and Palaeozoic age, all greatly folded and tilted up, and shot through with numerous irruptions of volcanic rocks, predominantly porphyritic and dioritic. On this swelling rise four more or less parallel mountain ranges of the Pe-shan system, together with a fifth chain of hills farther south, all having a strike from west-northwest to east-northeast. The range farthest north rises to above the desert and above sea-level, the next two ranges reach above the general level of the desert, and the range farthest south or an absolute altitude of , while the fifth chain of hills does not exceed in relative elevation.

All these ranges decrease in altitude from west to east. In the depressions that border the Pe-shan swelling on north and south are found the sedimentary deposits of the Tertiary sea of the Han-hai, but no traces of those deposits have been found on the swelling itself at altitudes of 5600 to . Hence, Futterer infers, in recent geological times no large sea has occupied the central part of the Gobi.

==Inhabitants ==
Beyond an occasional visit from a band of nomad Mongols, this region of the Pe-shan swelling is entirely uninhabited. And yet it was from this region, according to Grigory Grum-Grshimailo (1889-1890 explorer), that the Yue-chi (Yuezhi), a nomadic people akin to the Tibetans, proceeded when, towards the middle of the second century BC, they moved westwards and settled near Lake Issyk-kul; and from here proceeded also the Shanshani, or people who some two thousand years ago founded the state of Shanshan or Lofi-lan. The ruins of this town were discovered by Sven Hedin in the desert of Lop in 1901. Here, says the Russian explorer, the Huns gathered strength, as also did the Turks (Ch. &quot;Tukiu&quot;) in the sixth century, and the Uighur tribes and the rulers of the Tangut kingdom. But after Genghis Khan, in the 12th century, drew away the peoples of this region, and no others came to take their place, the country went out of cultivation and eventually became the barren desert it is now. During the Hun time, and probably into the Middle Ages, the present desert was a lush steppe grassland able to support sustainable seasonal nomadic horse husbandry on a large scale.

<text>Gateshead International Stadium (GIS) is a multi-purpose, all-seater venue in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, England. Originally known as the Gateshead Youth Stadium, the venue was built in 1955 at a cost of £30,000. It has since been extensively re-developed on three occasions. Its capacity of around 11,800 is the greatest in the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, the third-largest in Tyne and Wear (behind St James&#x27; Park and the Stadium of Light), and the sixth-largest in North East England.

The main arena is principally used for athletics. The inaugural athletics competition at the redeveloped venue, the 1974 &quot;Gateshead Games&quot;, was instigated by Brendan Foster, a Gateshead Council employee at that time. By breaking the world record in the men&#x27;s 3,000 m, Foster brought international publicity to the new stadium and began a tradition of athletics competitions at the venue, which has since hosted the British Grand Prix (2003–10) and the European Team Championships in 1989, 2000 and 2013. It is the only venue to have hosted the latter event three times. Five world records have been set at the stadium, including two by pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva and a tied 100 metres record by Asafa Powell in 2006.

Although Gateshead International Stadium primarily caters for athletics, it is the current or former home to teams in several sports. It has been used by Gateshead F.C. and its predecessors since 1973. It was home to the Gateshead Thunder rugby league club during their spell in the Super League and the replacement Gateshead Thunder club played home games in the main arena, which was known as the Thunderdome when used by that team until the club relocated to Newcastle in 2015. Gateshead Harriers Athletic Club, which includes Foster and Jonathan Edwards among its life members, are the oldest tenants, having used the site since 1956. The stadium has also been used as a concert venue by numerous musical artists including Little Mix, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Bon Jovi, Bryan Adams and Tina Turner.

==History and development==

The stadium is built on the site of two large chemical works opened in 1827 and 1834. These works initially thrived, but by the early part of the 20th century both were in terminal decline, and were demolished in 1932 to leave behind a 2-million-tonne heap of spoil. This land, approximately east of the centre of Gateshead, was cleared in 1942 but continued to lie derelict until the mid-1950s.

In early 1955, Gateshead Council began work on transforming this land. The Gateshead Youth Stadium, built on the site of the old chemical works, was opened by Jim Peters on 27 August 1955. Costing £30,000, the original venue contained little more than a cinder running track and an asphalt cycling track, though floodlights and a seating area were added soon after. On 1 July 1961, the arena hosted its first major competition—the Vaux Breweries International Athletics Meet—but according to sportswriter John Gibson, the Youth Stadium remained &quot;little more than a minor track with a tiny grandstand and open terraces&quot;.

According to author Thomas Telfer, by the turn of the 1970s, the town of Gateshead was suffering from &quot;the classic symptoms of decay in its inner-city areas&quot;. The response during the 1960s had been a programme of systematic derelict land reclamation and environmental improvement. While these measures did not have an immediate positive impact on the perception of the town, Gateshead Council pressed ahead by looking to develop existing infrastructure with a view to overall regeneration. One such opportunity was identified at the Gateshead Youth Stadium, where the council believed that investment might raise the region&#x27;s profile and bring international recognition. In April 1974, Gateshead Council inaugurated a &quot;Sport and Recreation&quot; department. In July 1974, the council appointed Brendan Foster—a former schoolteacher turned athlete and a native of Tyne and Wear—as the Council&#x27;s sport and recreation manager. Foster, who according to Gibson became &quot;the father of Gateshead athletics&quot;, had been forced to train in Edinburgh during 1973 as a result of the poor condition of the Youth Stadium track. In December 1973, he had been invited to a civic reception to celebrate his breaking of the two-mile world record earlier that year at Crystal Palace. At this reception, Foster was told that a new synthetic track was being laid at Gateshead Youth Stadium. His response was a promise that, if the Council was serious, he would run at the stadium and break a world record (Foster later offered an explanation of that promise: &quot;You know how it is when you&#x27;ve had a few drinks—you promise the world!&quot;). When the track was laid in early 1974, Foster became convinced of the Council&#x27;s sincerity. He was interviewed for the managerial position and, upon appointment, became the &quot;driving force&quot; behind the programme of improvements to the Youth Stadium, which included the building of the main, covered Tyne and Wear stand in 1981 and three accompanying stands; the venue was renamed the Gateshead International Stadium. This first tranche of improvements cost around £8 million, and Foster&#x27;s proposal to commemorate the re-opening with an athletic event was approved, allowing for the first &quot;Gateshead Games&quot; to be held in 1974.

The success of the first Gateshead Games, and their subsequent annual renewal, raised the profile of the stadium and caused Gateshead Council to further their financial investment. During the 1980s, additions were made to the site infrastructure, including the building of an indoor sports hall, outdoor football pitches and a gymnasium. In 1989 the running track was again relayed and Gateshead confirmed its reputation as a top-class athletics venue by hosting the Europa Cup (forerunner to the European Team Championships). In the 21st century, the site has been the subject of two major re-development projects. The first was completed in 2006, when two artificial outdoor football pitches, indoor athletic training facilities, sports science provisions and conferencing rooms were added at a cost of £15 million. The revamped stadium, funded by collaboration between One NorthEast, Sport England and Gateshead College among others, was opened on 12 May 2006 by Sebastian Coe.

A second tranche of development, undertaken in two stages, was approved in November 2009. This included a general refurbishment and improvement of the existing facilities at the stadium, adding cover, better toilet and new refreshment facilities to the exposed East Stand, improving wheelchair access, adding extra catering and conferencing facilities and a new media and management centre. This was funded by collaboration between Gateshead Council, local development funds and Gateshead College. The covering of the 4,000-seat East Stand with a new canopy roof was completed in July 2010, immediately prior to Gateshead hosting a Diamond League event. The second stage of the re-development—the building of the corporate and media facilities—commenced on 6 September 2010 and was completed on time in summer 2011. The total cost of the work was estimated to be £7.6 million.

A third programme of expansion was initially mooted in 2008. The aim of this programme was to expand the stadium into an all-embracing &quot;sports village&quot;, replete with an ice rink, indoor golf course, restaurants and shops. Gateshead Council invited tenders in August 2008 from commercial organisations interested in undertaking the development. A formal draft development brief was compiled and published in November 2009. A report to Council in December 2009 noted that there had been &quot;a reasonable level of interest at the preliminary stage&quot; from private investors, but that only one detailed proposal had been submitted, which had been declined by the Council on financial grounds. The report also noted concerns that the original centrepiece of the proposed village, the ice rink, may have been deterring investors and that a similar proposal to redevelop land at the Stadium of Light in Sunderland was detracting from what councillors had hoped to be a unique feature of the proposed village. The result was that a fresh proposal was raised to remove the ice rink from the brief in an attempt to &quot;stimulate the market&quot;. A public consultation was undertaken and in May 2010 the council reported that 327 of the 375 responses received were in favour of the amended proposal. As a result, notice was given to developers that the council intended to market the site and ten responses were received.

==Structure and facilities==

Gateshead International Stadium and its facilities occupy of land. The main athletics arena at Gateshead International Stadium is an all-seater, bowl-shaped arena consisting of four stands of seats. The precise capacity of the venue is uncertain; some sources claim it to be 11,750, others 11,762 and some provide a figure of 11,800. The main stand is the Tyne and Wear Stand, a steep, cantilevered structure seating 3,300 spectators. This stand contains toilet and catering facilities and a bar area. Opposite is the East Stand, a 4,000-seat structure that was uncovered until 2010, when a cantilevered canopy roof was added. A bespoke design by Fabric Architecture, the roof is a structure incorporating five barrel vault forms. Part of the same improvement plan added toilet and catering facilities to the East Stand. The South Terrace, sometimes referred to as simply the South Stand, consists of a continuous, uncovered bank of seating in eight blocks with access through four turnstiles. The North Terrace is opposite and consists of two blocks of uncovered seating separated by a large scoreboard.

The athletics track in the main arena was laid in 2003 and is an International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) standard 400m eight-lane oval. It is a polymer synthetic tartan track with a depth of . The sprint straight consists of eight lanes and is situated in front of the Tyne and Wear Stand, adjacent to the long and triple jump area. A height-adjustable water jump, for use in steeplechase racing, is located on the inside of the track. Floodlights allow athletics events to be held at night. The inner track area, which is floodlit, is an IAAF standard-sized grass surface used for athletics field events, rugby and football. When used for the latter, the pitch dimensions are .

The main arena is supplemented by other facilities. To the rear of the North Terrace are two third generation artificial pitches that are UEFA licensed, fully floodlit and full-sized for use in competitive rugby, football and American football. Alongside them are two grassed and one sand-dressed playing areas, which are also floodlit. Behind the Tyne and Wear Stand is an indoor sports hall, which contains a playing area marked out for various sports including badminton, netball and tennis. A retractable indoor athletics facility was previously housed alongside the sports hall, consisting of a long synthetic sprint straight and areas for throwing and jumping events, but its mechanical operation proved problematic and a more modern structure replaced it in 2006. This facility has a sprint straight in an hall, throwing and jumping facilities, a weights room and gymnasium.

==Athletics==

The first major athletic event held at the stadium was the Vaux Breweries International Athletics meet in July 1961. According to its sponsors, the highlight of this meet was the team three-mile race, won by the Blackpool and Fylde Athletic club who were awarded a gold tankard as their prize. Attracted by a prize fund of £500 and the imminent AAA Championships in London, the event attracted several athletes from New Zealand, including reigning 5000m metre Olympic champion Murray Halberg and Peter Snell, the reigning 800m Olympic champion. Watched by a capacity crowd of 10,000 spectators, the men won their respective races; Halberg placed first in the mile with a time of 4:03:70 and Snell led a New Zealand one-two in the 880-yard event, finishing ahead of teammate Gary Philpott in 1:50:40.

When the comprehensive refurbishment of the stadium was completed more than a decade later, Brendan Foster (by this time a Gateshead Council employee) proposed an international athletics meet. On 3 August 1974, the first &quot;Gateshead Games&quot; were staged in front of around 10,000 spectators. Four weeks before he won the European 5000m title at the 1974 European Athletics Championships in Rome, Foster kept his earlier promise to run in the men&#x27;s 3000m and won the race in a new world-record time of 7:35:20. According to journalist John Gibson, Foster&#x27;s performance gave the meet, broadcast live by Tyne Tees Television, &quot;landmark status&quot;. A plaque commemorating the record was later placed at the entrance to the stadium.

The Gateshead Games became an annual event, which gave the stadium credibility as a major sporting venue. In his managerial capacity with Gateshead Council, Foster was increasingly able to attract athletes to the games. In 1977, Foster had to intervene when BBC Radio Newcastle provided the wrong Ethiopian national anthem which, when played, offended Miruts Yifter sufficiently that he and his teammates started off towards Newcastle International Airport. The intervention worked—in the end, Foster asked Yifter and his teammates if they would sing the anthem themselves, which they did in the middle of the stadium—and Yifter returned to outclass a field including Steve Ovett over 5000m. The track was resurfaced by Regisport in 1982 and the venues&#x27; profile was further raised in the summer of 1983, when Gateshead-born athlete Steve Cram faced Sebastian Coe over 800m in the Gateshead Games. In front of a reported crowd of 15,000 who were &quot;shoehorned into the bowl&quot; and millions more watching on BBC&#x27;s Sunday Grandstand, Cram prevailed to spark &quot;pandemonium&quot; in his final race before winning the gold medal at the 1983 World Athletics Championships in Helsinki.

In 1989, Gateshead hosted the Europa Cup. The men&#x27;s competition was won for the first time by a Great Britain team captained by Linford Christie and which included Kriss Akabusi and Jack Buckner; the event was described a decade later as having had an &quot;invigorating effect&quot; on those who were in attendance. Four years later, on 30 July 1993, a stadium-record crowd of 14,797 watched Christie, by this time the reigning 100m Olympic champion, in action again – this time against his old rival Carl Lewis in a race where both men were reportedly paid £100,000 irrespective of the result. Christie won in a time of 10.07 seconds, ahead of Jon Drummond in second and Lewis, who finished &quot;a distant third&quot;. The 100m race was the highlight of the &quot;high profile&quot; Vauxhall Invitational meet, which was televised in the UK by ITV and watched by around 10 million viewers. Michael Johnson, John Regis and Steve Cram competed in various events at the Vauxhall Invitational.

In August 1998, Gateshead was selected to host the 2000 Europa Cup after the European Athletic Association switched the event from original host venue Martinique to avoid athletes travelling long distances in an Olympic year. This made Gateshead the first venue to host the event twice. On 16–17 July 2000, spectators at Gateshead once again saw Great Britain&#x27;s men&#x27;s team take the title, this time by half a point from Germany in second place; the British victory came despite missing ten first-choice team members. The women&#x27;s event was won by Russia, who defeated second-placed Germany by thirteen points.

Foster&#x27;s &quot;Gateshead Games&quot; had become the British Grand Prix by 2003, and on 13 July 21-year-old Yelena Isinbayeva set a new world record of 4.82m in the women&#x27;s pole vault event. Isinbayeva&#x27;s achievement in the last event of the meet was so unexpected that only 1,000 of the 10,000 spectators witnessed it, the rest having left early. For her achievement, she was given a bonus cheque for $50,000. On 27 June 2004, Isinbayeva returned to Gateshead. This time the event organisers decided to schedule the pole vault event earlier and were rewarded when Isinbayeva defied extremely windy conditions to post a new record mark of 4.87m. Isinbayeva was the second woman to set a world record in the pole vault at Gateshead; Daniela Bartova did so in 1995. In 2006, a crowd of 8,500 saw Asafa Powell equal the world record of 9.77 seconds in the men&#x27;s 100m. The official, un-rounded time of 9.762 seconds was then the fastest time ever recorded. The meet was also notable for the return to competition of Dwain Chambers after his ban for using performance-enhancing drugs, and for Eliud Kipchoge breaking Foster&#x27;s stadium record over 3000m that had stood for more than three decades.

In 2010, the British Grand Prix at Gateshead was chosen as one of the inaugural fourteen Diamond League events, but although competitors included Tyson Gay, Powell, Jessica Ennis and Vincent Chepkok, the attendance was unusually poor, causing the local press to wonder whether Gateshead&#x27;s contract for the marquee event would be renewed. Those fears were to prove well-founded when UK Athletics agreed to a three-year contract to stage the event at the Alexander Stadium in Birmingham. The move prompted one reporter to lament that &quot;the switch is a major blow to both Gateshead International Stadium and North-East sport in general, but can hardly be regarded as a major surprise given the dwindling support for major athletics events in the region.&quot;

This loss was mitigated somewhat by the European Athletic Association&#x27;s decision to award Gateshead the 2013 European Team Championships, the successor to the Europa Cup. In doing so, Gateshead became the only stadium to host the European Team Championships on three occasions. The championships were held on 22–23 June 2013 amid very wet and windy conditions. On the first day of competition, Mo Farah ran a 50.89 second final lap in winning the men&#x27;s 5000m to help the home team into third place on 181 points, behind Russia (194 points) and Germany (195 points). Despite a strong start, the Great Britain team were unable to make up the deficit on the second day of competition and finished in third place overall on 338 points, behind runners-up Germany (347.5 points) and the champions Russia (354.5 points).

Due to redevelopment of Birmingham’s Alexander Stadium for the 2022 Commonwealth Games, the British Grand Prix Diamond League fixture was set to return to Gateshead in 2020 for the first time in 10 years. The meeting was originally scheduled to take place on 16 August but was rescheduled to 12 September and then cancelled, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom.

==Tenants==

===Gateshead Football Club===

The stadium was briefly used by former Football League members Gateshead A.F.C. after leaving Redheugh Park in 1973, but the club went bust later in the year. The following year South Shields football club relocated to Gateshead and were renamed Gateshead United; they played at the Gateshead Stadium from 1974 to 1977 when it folded and Gateshead F.C. was formed.

Gateshead F.C. have been tenants since their formation in 1977. In May 2008 Gateshead hosted Buxton in a promotion play-off and won 2–0 in front of 1,402 spectators, the largest crowd to watch the club at the ground in 14 years. That record was broken a year later when 4,121 saw Gateshead defeat Telford United 2–0 on 9 May 2009 to win promotion to the Conference Premier league. The current record attendance for a competitive fixture stands at 8,144, set on 4 May 2014 when Gateshead played host to Grimsby Town in the second leg of the Conference Premier play-off semi-final. Gateshead won 3-1 to progress to the final at Wembley Stadium where they were beaten 2-1 by Cambridge United. The defeat consigned the club to a 55th consecutive season outside the Football League. Gateshead F.C. continue to play at Gateshead Stadium but, according to North East Life magazine, it is &quot;a fine but inappropriate stadium ... as a football ground it can be a soulless home&quot;. In 2009, chairman Graham Wood unveiled plans to move to a new, purpose-built 9,000 capacity ground on Prince Consort Road in the centre of Gateshead. Detailed proposals were published soon after, and Wood told local media in 2012 that he expects the move to increase crowds and alleviate the financial constraints on him as he continues to bankroll the club; it is estimated that crowds would need to reach 3,000 regularly for the club to operate profitably from Gateshead Stadium. According to the original proposal, the stadium was expected to be ready for the 2012–13 season, but financing has been difficult and the proposed move is now on hold.

===Gateshead Harriers===

Gateshead Harriers are an athletic club based at Gateshead International Stadium. Founded in 1904 as Gateshead St Mary&#x27;s Church Running Club, they were initially a men-only club until allowing the admission of women in 1951. The club moved to the Gateshead Youth Stadium in 1956, making the Harriers the stadium&#x27;s oldest tenant. In 2006 they won promotion to the first division of the British Athletics League and were the only club from the north-east of England to compete at that level. After a six-year stay in the division, the Harriers were relegated to division two in August 2012 after failing to win enough points at the final meet of the season at Eton to prevent a bottom-two league finish. Club officials received over 100 new applications for membership in the aftermath of the 2012 London Olympics.

At least one Gateshead Harrier has taken part in every Olympics and Paralympics held since 1972. Notable alumni include Brendan Foster, who joined the club aged 17 and later claimed that &quot;my first aim was to be the best runner of Gateshead Harriers&quot;. Foster, inducted into the England Athletics Hall of Fame in 2010 and recently voted the eleventh &quot;greatest Geordie&quot; in a local poll, later became the president of Gateshead Harriers and remains so as of 2012. Current world triple-jump record holder Jonathan Edwards, another member of the England Athletics Hall of Fame, joined Gateshead Harriers in 1991. Edwards was a member of the club when he set his record mark in winning gold at the 1995 World Championships in Helsinki, when winning Olympic gold at the 2000 Sydney Games and a second world title a year later in Edmonton. Both Foster and Edwards are honorary life members of the club.

===Gateshead Thunder===

In 1998, Gateshead was awarded a rugby league franchise after a three-way contest with Cardiff and Swansea. The result was Gateshead Thunder, who played in Super League IV in 1999. The Thunder played at Gateshead International Stadium and the club had, according to sports journalist Andy Wilson, &quot;an enjoyable and surprisingly successful season&quot; which included home and away wins against St. Helens and a sixth-place finish in the table – missing out on the playoffs by two points. Despite these performances, which attracted an average crowd of 3,895 to Gateshead Stadium, the franchise lost £700,000 in its first year and in November 1999 the Rugby Football League (RFL) approved a merger with the Hull Sharks. The result was the formation of Hull FC, and when the authorities refused permission for the merged clubs to enter a Hull-based team into the RFL&#x27;s second tier, the franchise moved almost in its entirety to Hull, ending Gateshead&#x27;s Super League participation after a single season; according to Wilson, the Thunder was &quot;left to die, provoking bitter resentment&quot; from supporters.

There have been some highlights, including winning Championship 1 in 2008 and a run to the quarter-final of the Challenge Cup in 2009 which ended in a 66–6 defeat to Super League side St Helens. However, the Thunder went through a 64-game losing streak spanning two-and-a-half years before winning against Workington Town on 29 August 2012.

Relations between the Thunder and Gateshead Council were strained at times, with a possible move to Kingston Park Newcastle upon Tyne, first mooted, and rejected, in 2006. In 2008, the club committed itself again to Gateshead Stadium for the immediate future, however, in March 2014 The Journal reported that talks had begun between Thunder&#x27;s managing director Keith Christie and representatives of Newcastle Falcons with a view to the Falcons taking over the rugby league club. Falcons&#x27; owner Semore Kurdi confirmed that a bid had been made to purchase Gateshead Thunder on 20 March 2014, though he refused to elaborate on whether he intended to relocate the club if that bid was accepted. The takeover was confirmed on 23 May 2014, though it was announced that the club would continue to play at the International Stadium. In January 2015 Gateshead Thunder were officially renamed Newcastle Thunder and relocated to Kingston Park. Keith Christie told the BBC that the move was &quot;a business decision&quot; designed to build a new fan base for the club.

In May 2024 the club announced an immediate return to Gateshead from Kingston Park.

===Gateshead Senators===

The Gateshead Senators (originally the Gateshead International Senators) are an American football club formed in 1988 when the Newcastle Senators, who played at Northern Rugby Club, moved across the Tyne to play at the Gateshead International Stadium. The club has had mixed fortunes but their most successful season came in 1999. Having won eight of their nine games in the regular season, the team won the Division One North title and advanced to the end-of-season playoffs. After beating the Merseyside Nighthawks 43–0 in the quarter-finals, the Senators defeated the Essex Spartans 33–19 in the semi-finals to reach the championship final. At the Saffron Lane Stadium in Leicester, the Senators faced the Bristol Aztecs. In a tight encounter, the Senators claimed the Division One British American Football League title with a 7–2 victory. The club reached the playoffs again in the next three seasons but were unable to replicate that success, and after a season voluntarily spent in Division Two in 2003, returned to Division One North in 2004. They continue to play in that division, and in the 2012 season failed to make the playoffs after recording five wins and five defeats in their ten games.

The Senators were a tenant at Gateshead Stadium from 1988 to 2011. In 2012, the club announced plans to move away from Gateshead for the start of the 2012 season to create &quot;a better game-day experience&quot; and they now play at the Monkton Stadium.

==Concert venue==

Gateshead International Stadium has been used for many years as a concert venue. On 31 July 1982, The Police performed at the stadium as part of their Ghost in the Machine Tour, with U2 as a supporting act. Reports in the local press suggested that The Police seemed disappointed that the stadium was only half full and cited high ticket prices and poor weather as possible causes. On 16 June 1992 Guns N&#x27; Roses, supported by Soundgarden and Faith No More, performed at the stadium. This time the weather was hot and sunny which helped ensure that the concert, part of the Use Your Illusion Tour, was a sell-out. American rock group Bon Jovi have played twice at the stadium. The first occasion was on 27 June 1995, while supported by Skin, on their These Days Tour. The group returned to Gateshead on 22 August 2000 as part of their Crush Tour. Another artist who has performed multiple times at Gateshead International Stadium is Tina Turner. As part of her Foreign Affair: The Farewell Tour, Turner performed twice on consecutive nights (21–22 July 1990) and attracted a total of 60,000 spectators. Turner performed for a third time at the stadium as part of her Wildest Dreams Tour on 12 July 1996. Most recently the venue played host to Little Mix on 26 July 2018 as part of their Summer Hits Tour. Other artists to have played at the stadium include Bryan Adams, Rod Stewart, Simple Minds and Simply Red.

==Transport==
Gateshead International Stadium is east of Gateshead Town Centre and is on the A184 Felling Bypass, with access to a car park at Neilson Road. Journey time by car from Gateshead town centre is approximately five minutes and a further five minutes travel from Newcastle upon Tyne. A footpath runs adjacent to the Felling bypass and the journey by foot from Gateshead town centre takes some fifteen minutes. A journey east to Heworth Interchange also takes around fifteen minutes. Two designated cycle routes run past the stadium. These are Hadrian&#x27;s Way, which provides access from Tynemouth in the east and Wylam in the west, and the Keelman&#x27;s Way, which runs along the south bank of the River Tyne towards Blaydon-on-Tyne.

The stadium is well served by public transport. It has its own Tyne and Wear Metro station, the Gateshead Stadium Metro station. This is at Shelley Drive, some five minutes&#x27; walk from the ground. Trains run direct from this station to all other Metro destinations; trains to South Shields and South Hylton stop at platform one while trains travelling towards St James and Airport stop at platform two. The Gateshead Stadium Metro station is open seven days a week and at peak times seventeen trains per hour stop there. The nearest mainline railway station is Newcastle Central Station, around away, though local rail travel calls at Heworth Interchange. Go North East operate the 93/94 &quot;East Gateshead Loop&quot; bus service, which provides access to the stadium from the Team Valley, Gateshead Interchange, Heworth Interchange and Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Sheriff Hill. This bus runs every Twenty minutes during the day and every hourly during evenings.

<text>Andrea Costa (29 November 1851 – 19 January 1910) was an Italian politician, among the founders of socialism in Italy, and the first socialist deputy in Italian history. He was also initiated on September 25, 1883 to the Masonic Lodge &quot;Rienzi&quot; in Rome and progressively become 32nd-degree Mason and adjunctive Great Master of the Grande Oriente of Italy.

Costa was arrested in the failed Bakuninist 1874 Bologna insurrection as its main Italian organizer. Costa left the country and was arrested in France. He continued to agitate in Romagna. In a letter, &quot;To My Friends and to My Adversaries&quot;, he defended himself against charges of reformism or anti-revolutionarism but effectively broke from his anarchist past. The Russian socialist Anna Kulischov, who had met Costa in Paris in 1876 and was another former Bakuninist, is believed to have spurred his transition from anarchism to socialism.

Costa founded the Revolutionary Socialist Party of Romagna in 1881 with a small regional following. Costa became the first Italian socialist elected to the Italian Parliament the next year. In 1892, he called the Genoa Congress, which established the Italian Workers&#x27; Party, which was later renamed as the Italian Socialist Party.

He was later a politician and mayor of Imola and died there in 1910.

His close friend and masonic brother Giovanni Pascoli wrote the funeral inscription dedicated to him, whom he knew together with Alceste Faggioli when he was a university student.

The parents of Benito Mussolini gave him the middle name &quot;Andrea&quot; in Costa&#x27;s honour, alongside fellow Italian socialist Amilcare Cipriani.

<doc id="1011231" wikidata="Q7883540" url="?curid=1011231" title="Undercroft">
<text>An undercroft is traditionally a cellar or storage room, often brick-lined and vaulted, and used for storage in buildings since medieval times. In modern usage, an undercroft is generally a ground (street-level) area which is relatively open to the sides, but covered by the building above.

== History ==
While some were used as simple storerooms, others were rented out as shops. For example, the undercroft rooms at Myres Castle in Fife, Scotland, of were used as the medieval kitchen and a range of stores. Many of these early medieval undercrofts were vaulted or groined, such as the vaulted chamber at Beverston Castle in Gloucestershire or the groined stores at Myres Castle. The term is sometimes used to describe a crypt beneath a church, used for burial purposes. For example, there is a 14th-century undercroft or crypt extant at Muchalls Castle in Aberdeenshire in Scotland, even though the original chapel above it was destroyed in an act of war in 1746.

Undercrofts were commonly built in England and Scotland throughout the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries. They occur in cities such as London, Chester, Coventry and Southampton. The undercroft beneath the Houses of Parliament in London was rented to the conspirators behind the Gunpowder Plot.

== Modern usage ==
In modern buildings, the term undercroft is often used to describe a ground-level parking area that occupies the footprint of the building (and sometimes extends to other service or garden areas around the structure). This type of parking is, however, discouraged by some urban design guidelines, as it prevents the ground floor from having activities (shops, restaurants or similar) that provide for a lively streetscape.

<doc id="1011237" wikidata="Q1944489" url="?curid=1011237" title="San Pedro Garza García">
<text>San Pedro Garza García (also known as San Pedro) is a city-municipality in the Mexican state of Nuevo León and part of the Monterrey Metropolitan area. It is a contemporary commercial suburb of the larger metropolitan city of Monterrey between Puente de la Unidad and the Alfa Planetarium, including areas surrounding Calzada del Valle/Calzada San Pedro. In 2018 it was evaluated as having the best quality of life in Mexico.
It has luxury shopping malls, large green areas, as well as important colleges and hospitals. 
Cerro de Chipinque and Chipinque Ecological Park are notable aspects of the city. The city hosts the head offices of companies like ALFA, Cemex, Gamesa, Vitro, Pyosa, Softtek and Cydsa.

==Geography==

The municipality has an area of and is primarily urban, located adjacent to the southwest side of Monterrey. It sits in a valley surrounded by mountains, most notably La Loma Larga and Sierra Madre Oriental.

===Chipinque Ecological Park===

On the slopes of Cerro de Chipinque, within the Cumbres de Monterrey national park, is the Chipinque Ecological Park, with 1,791 hectares, covering altitudes from 730 to 2,200 meters with representative flora and fauna. The annual average temperature is 21 °C.

The Chipinque Ecological Park aims to conserve biodiversity through integrated management that ensures the conservation of its natural resources, which in turn promotes respect and appreciation of the ecosystem and geography of the place.

On the 25th anniversary of the park, the Chipinque brand was redesigned, which revitalized the relationship that visitors have with the park.

==Government==
The Municipal President (Mayor) of San Pedro is Mauricio Fernandez, a candidate of PAN (National Action Party).

San Pedro Garza Garcia was founded in 1596. The land was converted into a large plantation called &quot;Los Nogales&quot; which produced crops like corn, wheat, and beans.

During the 18th century, the plantation often went by the name of &quot;San Pedro&quot;, in honor of Saint Peter.

The city was elevated to the status of &quot;Villa&quot; (town) on December 14, 1882, when it was given the name Garza García, in honor of the governor of Nuevo León, Genaro Garza García.

In 1988, the mayor at the time, Alejandro Chapa Salazar, gave the city its current name, adding the reference to what it was called centuries before.

==Education==
===Higher education===
The city is home to the Catholic university, Universidad de Monterrey (UDEM), which offers bachelor&#x27;s degree and master&#x27;s degree programs. The Instituto Tecnológico de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM) has two of its graduate schools in San Pedro. The Escuela de Graduados en Administración y Dirección de Empresas (EGADE), ITESM&#x27;s Graduate School of Business, and the Escuela de Graduados en Administración y Política Pública (EGAP), the Graduate School of Politics and Public Administration. Both campuses are located in Valle Oriente. There are no public universities in San Pedro.

===Elementary and secondary education===
San Pedro has 40 public pre-schools, elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools. The city also has 39 private schools. However, whereas public schools only offer one type of education (e.g., only middle school, or only elementary school), private schools offer multiple types (mostly K-9th and K-12). If counted individually by type of education provided, private schools function as 88 different schools, more than twice the number of public schools.

<doc id="1011239" wikidata="Q695344" url="?curid=1011239" title="Whitetip reef shark">
<text>The whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon obesus) is a species of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae, and the only member of its genus. A small shark that does not usually exceed in length, this species is easily recognizable by its slender body and short but broad head, as well as tubular skin flaps beside the nostrils, oval eyes with vertical pupils, and white-tipped dorsal and caudal fins. One of the most common sharks found on Indo-Pacific coral reefs, the whitetip reef shark occurs as far west as South Africa and as far east as Central America. It is typically found on or near the bottom in clear water, at a depth of .

During the day, whitetip reef sharks spend much of their time resting inside caves. Unlike other requiem sharks, which rely on ram ventilation and must constantly swim to breathe, this shark can pump water over its gills and lie still on the bottom. At night, whitetip reef sharks emerge to hunt bony fishes, crustaceans, and octopus in groups, their elongate bodies allowing them to force their way into crevices and holes to extract hidden prey. Individuals may stay within a particular area of the reef for months or years, frequently returning to the same shelter. This species is viviparous, in which the developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection to their mother.

Whitetip reef sharks are rarely aggressive towards humans, though they may investigate swimmers closely. However, spear fishers are at risk of being bitten by one attempting to steal their catch. This species is caught for food, though ciguatera poisoning resulting from its consumption has been reported. The IUCN has assessed the whitetip reef shark as Vulnerable, noting its numbers are dwindling due to increasing levels of unregulated fishing activity across its range. The slow reproductive rate and limited habitat preferences of this species renders its populations vulnerable to overfishing.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==

The whitetip reef shark was first described by the German naturalist Eduard Rüppell as &quot;Carcharias obesus&quot;, in the 1837 &quot;Fische des Rothen Meere&quot; (&quot;Fishes of the Red Sea&quot;). His choice of the specific epithet &quot;obesus&quot; was curious, given that this shark is actually quite slender. Later in 1837, Johannes Müller and Friedrich Henle moved this species into its own genus &quot;Triaenodon&quot;, from the Greek &quot;triaena&quot; meaning &quot;trident&quot;, and &quot;odon&quot; meaning &quot;tooth&quot;. As Rüppell did not originally designate a holotype, in 1960 a 31-cm-long specimen caught off Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, was made the species lectotype. Other common names for this shark include blunthead shark, light-tip shark, reef whitetip shark, and whitetip shark.

Once placed in the family Triakidae, the whitetip reef shark is now recognized by most authors as belonging to the family Carcharhinidae on the basis of morphological characters, such as a full nictitating membrane, well-developed precaudal pit, strong lower caudal fin lobe, and scroll-like intestinal valves. Morphological and molecular phylogenetic analyses suggest the whitetip reef shark is grouped with the lemon sharks (&quot;Negaprion&quot;) and the sliteye shark (&quot;Loxodon&quot;) in occupying an intermediate position on the carcharhinid evolutionary tree, between most basal genera (&quot;Galeocerdo&quot;, &quot;Rhizoprionodon&quot;, and &quot;Scoliodon&quot;) and the most derived (&quot;Carcharhinus&quot; and &quot;Sphyrna&quot;).

==Distribution and habitat==
The whitetip reef shark is distributed widely across the entire Indo-Pacific region. It was once thought to have existed in the Atlantic Ocean, based on fossil teeth found in North Carolina dated to the Miocene epoch, although subsequent research has suggested that the teeth are of a mackerel shark, and that the whitetip has never colonized the Atlantic. In the Indian Ocean, whitetip reef sharks can be found off of northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa and all along the East African coast, from the Horn of Africa to the Red Sea and along the Indian subcontinent (including Sri Lanka). They are found near many major island chains as well, including Madagascar, Mauritius, Mayotte, the Comoros, the Aldabra Group, the Seychelles and the Chagos Archipelago. 

In the western and central Pacific Ocean, whitetips occur off South China, Taiwan, and the Ryukyu Islands, south to the Philippines and throughout the entire Coral Triangle, including the coastlines of Indonesia, East Timor and Papua New Guinea. Their range continues south to the northern Australia and the Great Barrier Reef. Whitetips are also found around numerous Pacific atolls and islands, including Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia, north to Hawaii and south to the Pitcairn Islands. They have also been sighted near Midway and Johnston Atolls and Laysan. In the Eastern Pacific, they may be found off the west coasts of Costa Rica and Panama south to the Galápagos Islands, and as far north as Isla Isabel, Isla Socorro, and the southern tip of Baja California (Cabo San Lucas and Cabo Pulmo National Marine Park).

Associated almost exclusively with coral reef habitats, whitetip reef sharks are most often encountered around coral heads and ledges with high vertical relief, and additionally over sandy flats, in lagoons, and near drop-offs to deeper water. They prefer very clear water, and rarely stray far from the bottom during the day. The species is most common at a depth of . On occasion, they may enter water less than 1 m deep when foraging; there is an exceptional record of a whitetip reef shark being captured from a depth of off the Ryukyu Islands.

==Description==
A relatively small species, few whitetip reef sharks are longer than . The maximum length this species attains is often given as , though this was originally based on visual observations and may be dubious. The maximum reported weight is . The whitetip reef shark has a slim body and a short, broad head. The snout is flattened and blunt, with large flaps of skin in front of the nares that are furled into tubes. The eyes are small and oval with vertical pupils and prominent ridges above, and are often followed by a small notch. The mouth has a distinct downward slant (imparting a disgruntled expression to the shark), with short furrows at the corners. There are 42–50 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 42–48 tooth rows in the lower jaw. Each tooth has a single narrow, smooth-edged cusp at the center, flanked by a pair of much smaller cusplets.

The first dorsal fin is positioned well back on the body, closer to the pelvic than the pectoral fins. The second dorsal and anal fins are large, about half to three-quarters as high as the first dorsal fin. The broad, triangular pectoral fins originate at or slightly before the level of the fifth gill slit. There is no ridge between the first and second dorsal fins. The lower lobe of the caudal fin is half the length of the upper, which has a strong notch near the tip. The dermal denticles are small and overlapping, usually with 7 horizontal ridges, giving the skin a smooth feel. The coloration is grayish to brownish above and white below, with a pattern of scattered small, dark spots unique to each individual. The tips of the first dorsal fin and upper caudal fin lobe, and sometimes also the second dorsal fin and lower caudal fin lobe, are bright white.

==Biology and ecology==

The whitetip reef shark is one of the three most common sharks inhabiting the reefs of the Indo-Pacific, the other two being the blacktip reef shark (&quot;Carcharhinus melanopterus&quot;) and the grey reef shark (&quot;Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos&quot;). The habitat preferences of this species overlap those of the other two, though it does not tend to frequent very shallow water like the blacktip reef shark, nor the outer reef like the grey reef shark. The whitetip reef shark swims with strong undulations of its body, and unlike other requiem sharks can lie motionless on the bottom and actively pump water over its gills for respiration. This species is most active at night or during slack tide, and spends much of the day resting inside caves singly or in small groups, arranged in parallel or stacked atop one another. Off Hawaii, these sharks may be found sheltering inside underwater lava tubes, while off Costa Rica they are often seen lying in the open on sandy flats.

Whitetip reef sharks generally remain within a highly localized area; only rarely do they undertake long movements, wandering for a while before settling down somewhere new. One study at Johnston Atoll found that none of the sharks examined had moved more than away from their original capture location over periods of up to a year. Another study at Rangiroa Atoll in French Polynesia found that, after more than three years, around 40% of the originally tagged sharks were still present on the same reef where they were first captured. An individual shark may rest inside the same cave for months to years. The daytime home range of a whitetip reef shark is limited to approximately ; at night this range increases to . These sharks are not territorial and share their home ranges with others of their species; they do not perform threat displays.

Important predators of the whitetip reef shark include tiger sharks (&quot;Galeocerdo cuvier&quot;), Galapagos sharks (&quot;Carcharhinus galapagensis&quot;), and possibly also silvertip sharks (&quot;Carcharhinus albimarginatus&quot;), though they usually occur at depths greater than those favored by whitetip reef sharks. An long whitetip reef shark has also been found in the stomach of a giant grouper (&quot;Epinephelus lanceolatus&quot;), though these groupers are unlikely to be significant predators of this species due to their rarity. Known parasites of the whitetip reef shark include the copepod &quot;Paralebion elongatus&quot; and the praniza (parasitic) larvae of the isopod &quot;Gnathia grandilaris&quot;. While resting during the day, these sharks have been observed being cleaned by the wrasse &quot;Bodianus diplotaenia&quot; and the goby &quot;Elacatinus puncticulatus&quot;. Unusually, there is also a report of seven whitetip reef sharks adopting a cleaning posture (mouth agape and gills flared) in the midst of a swarm of non-cleaning hyperiid amphipods; the mechanical stimulation from the moving amphipods are thought to have evoked this behavior through their similarity to actual cleaner organisms.

===Feeding===

With its slender, lithe body, the whitetip reef shark specializes in wriggling into narrow crevices and holes in the reef and extracting prey inaccessible to other reef sharks. Alternatively, it is rather clumsy when attempting to take food suspended in open water. This species feeds mainly on bony fishes, including eels, squirrelfishes, snappers, damselfishes, parrotfishes, surgeonfishes, triggerfishes and goatfishes, as well as octopuses, spiny lobsters, and crabs. The whitetip reef shark is highly responsive to the olfactory, acoustic, and electrical cues given off by potential prey, while its visual system is attuned more to movement and/or contrast than to object details. It is especially sensitive to natural and artificial low-frequency sounds in the 25–100 Hz range, which evoke struggling fish.

Whitetip reef sharks hunt primarily at night, when many fishes are asleep and easily taken. After dusk, groups of sharks methodically scour the reef, often breaking off pieces of coral in their vigorous pursuit of prey. Multiple sharks may target the same prey item, covering every exit route from a particular coral head. Each shark hunts for itself and in competition with the others in its group. Unlike blacktip reef sharks and grey reef sharks, whitetip reef sharks do not become more excited when feeding in groups and are unlikely to be stirred into a feeding frenzy. Despite their nocturnal habits, whitetip reef sharks will hunt opportunistically in daytime. Off Borneo, this species gathers around reef drop-offs to feed on food brought up by the rising current. Off Hawaii, they follow Hawaiian monk seals (&quot;Monachus schauinslandi&quot;) and attempt to steal their catches. A whitetip reef shark can survive for six weeks without food.

===Life history===

Like other members of its family, the whitetip reef shark is viviparous; once the developing embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment for the remainder of gestation. Mature females have a single functional ovary, on the left side, and two functional uteruses. The reproductive cycle is biennial.

===Mating===
Mating is initiated when up to five males follow closely behind a female and bite at her fins and body, possibly cued by pheromones indicating the female&#x27;s readiness. Each male attempts to seize the female by engulfing one of her pectoral fins; at times two males might grasp a female on both sides simultaneously. Once engaged, the sharks sink to the bottom, whereupon the male (or males) rotates one of his claspers forward, inflates the associated siphon sac (a subcutaneous abdominal organ that takes in seawater that is used to flush sperm into the female), and attempts to make contact with the female&#x27;s vent. In many cases, the female resists by pressing her belly against the bottom and arching her tail; this may reflect mate choice on her part. The male has a limited time in which to achieve copulation, as while he is holding the female&#x27;s pectoral fin in his mouth he is being deprived of oxygen. On the other hand, if the female is willing, the pair settles side-by-side with their heads pressed against the bottom and their bodies at an upward angle.

After a gestation period of 10–13 months, females give birth to litters of 1–6 (usually 2–3) pups. The number of offspring is not correlated with female size; each female produces an estimated average of 12 pups over her entire lifetime. Parturition occurs from May to August (autumn and winter) in French Polynesia, in July (summer) off Enewetak Atoll, and in October (summer) off Australia. Females give birth while swimming, making violent twists and turns of their bodies; each pup takes under an hour to fully emerge. The newborns measure long and have relatively longer caudal fins than adults. This shark develops slowly compared to other requiem sharks; newborns grow at a rate of per year while adults grow as a rate of per year. Sexual maturity is reached at a length of around and an age of 8–9 years, though mature males as small as long have been recorded from the Maldives, suggesting regional variation in maturation size. On the Great Barrier Reef, males live to 14 years and females to 19 years; the maximum lifespan of this shark may be upwards of 25 years. In 2008, a whitetip reef shark produced a single pup through possibly asexual means at the Nyiregyhaza Centre in Hungary; previous instances of asexual reproduction in sharks have been reported in the bonnethead (&quot;Sphyrna tiburo&quot;) and the blacktip shark (&quot;Carcharhinus limbatus&quot;).

==Human interactions==
Unlike its Oceanic cousin, the white tip reef shark is more harmless and is seldom aggressive unless provoked. They are also fearless and curious, as the whitetip reef sharks may approach swimmers closely to investigate. However, these sharks readily attempt, and quite boldly, to steal catches from spear fishers, which has resulted in several people being bitten in the process. In some places, local whitetip reef sharks have learned to associate the sound of a speargun discharge or a boat dropping anchor with food and respond within seconds. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File lists two provoked and three unprovoked attacks to this species. Whitetip reef sharks are well-suited to ecotourism diving, and with conditioning they can be hand-fed by divers. In Hawaiian mythology, the fidelity (i.e. &quot;loyalty&quot;) of whitetip reef sharks to certain areas of the reef for years at a time may have inspired belief in &quot;ʻaumākua&quot;, the spirits of family ancestors that take animal form and protect their descendants.

The whitetip reef shark is taken by fisheries operating off Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Madagascar, and likely elsewhere, using longlines, gillnets, and trawls. The meat and liver are eaten, though sharks from certain areas present a substantial risk of ciguatera poisoning (especially the liver, which contains a much higher concentration of the toxin than the meat). The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Vulnerable, as its numbers have dropped in recent decades due to increasing, and thus far unregulated, fishing pressure in the tropics. Its restricted habitat, low dispersal, and slow reproduction are factors that limit this shark&#x27;s capacity for recovering from overfishing. On the Great Barrier Reef, populations of whitetip reef sharks in fishing zones have been reduced by 80% relative to no-entry zones. Furthermore, populations in no-take zones, where boats are allowed but fishing prohibited, exhibit levels of depletion comparable to fishing zones due to poaching. Demographic models indicate that these depleted populations will continue to decline by 6.6–8.3% per year without additional conservation measures. In June 2018 the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the whitetip reef shark as &quot;Vagrant&quot; under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.

<text>USS &quot;Sarda&quot; (SS-488), a &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the sarda, a game fish of the central, southwestern, and western Pacific Ocean.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Sarda&quot;′s construction was financed by bonds purchased during the Seventh War Loan by the residents of Lynn, Massachusetts. Her keel was laid down on 12 April 1945 at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 24 August 1945 sponsored by Mrs. Heffernan, the wife of James J. Heffernan, Congressman from New York.

Since World War II had ended in mid-August 1945, just weeks before &quot;Sarda&quot;′s launch, &quot;Sarda&quot; no longer was needed for wartime service, and the decision as to whether to commission or scrap her had to be made. &quot;Sarda&quot;’s prospective commanding officer — Commander Chester W. Nimitz, Jr., son of Admiral Chester W. Nimitz — grew frustrated with the debate over the fate of his submarine. During the months of waiting, he received a small plaque from his father inscribed &quot;Illegitimi non Carborundum&quot; — &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Bastards Grind You Up.&quot;

During the period between launching and commissioning, &quot;Sarda&quot; was fitted out with an extra large conning tower to permit installation of experimental equipment. She eventually was commissioned on 19 April 1946 with Commander Nimitz in command.

==Service history==
===1946–1959===
After commissioning, &quot;Sarda&quot; conducted her shakedown cruise in the Caribbean Sea, then returned north to commence experimental work from New London, Connecticut. There, she joined Submarine Division 22 of Submarine Squadron 2, and for the next four years tested new equipment for the Underwater Sound Laboratory at Fort Trumbull in New London and evaluated new ship control procedures. In the fall of 1949, she was transferred to Submarine Division 21, and her primary mission was shifted from test and evaluation work to school ship duties. She continued that work through the 1950s, interrupting it only for type training; mine planting exercises; antisubmarine warfare exercises; fleet exercises; occasional participation in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) or joint United States-Canada exercises off the coasts of the Atlantic Provinces and northern New England; and, from January to June 1957, operations in the Caribbean Sea and from the Guiana and Brazilian basins for the United States Hydrographic Office. On her return, she resumed her primary function, training submarine school students.

===1960–1964===
In the early 1960s, &quot;Sarda&quot; continued training work, but devoted more time to providing services to antisubmarine warfare units conducting exercises. During the winter of 1960, she provided services to 92 surface ships and 14 air squadrons participating in annual training exercises in the Caribbean. In early 1961, she became the first American submarine to complete 11,000 dives. During the winter of 1962, she again returned to the Caribbean for an extended stay and, when not employed in servicing United States Atlantic Fleet air and surface antisubmarine warfare units, she tested and evaluated acoustic torpedoes. In the winter of 1963, she deployed to the Mediterranean Sea, where she operated with the United States Sixth Fleet, and, on her return to New London in late May 1963, she resumed school ship duties.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
In April 1964, &quot;Sarda&quot; was declared to be surplus to U.S.Navy needs. She spent May 1964 in port at New London preparing for inactivation, and on 1 June 1964 she was decommissioned. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on the same day, and her hulk was sold for scrapping in March 1965.

==Commemoration==
&quot;Sarda&quot;′s name plate is on display at the Freedom Park in Omaha, Nebraska.

<text>Value investing is an investment paradigm that involves buying securities that appear underpriced by some form of fundamental analysis. Modern value investing derives from the investment philosophy taught by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd at Columbia Business School starting in 1928 and subsequently developed in their 1934 text &quot;Security Analysis&quot;.

The early value opportunities identified by Graham and Dodd included stock in public companies trading at discounts to book value or tangible book value, those with high dividend yields and those having low price-to-earning multiples or low price-to-book ratios.

Proponents of value investing, including Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett, have argued that the essence of value investing is buying stocks at less than their intrinsic value. The discount of the market price to the intrinsic value is what Benjamin Graham called the &quot;margin of safety&quot;. Buffett further expanded the value investing concept with a focus on &quot;finding an outstanding company at a sensible price&quot; rather than generic companies at a bargain price. Hedge fund manager Seth Klarman has described value investing as rooted in a rejection of the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH). While the EMH proposes that securities are accurately priced based on all available data, value investing proposes that some equities are not accurately priced.

Graham himself did not use the phrase &quot;value investing.&quot; The term was coined later to help describe his ideas. The term however has also led to misinterpretation of his principles - most notably the notion that Graham simply recommended cheap stocks. Columbia Business School is the current home for value investing.

==History==
===Early predecessors===
The concept of intrinsic value for equities was recognized as early as the 1600s, as was the idea that paying substantially above intrinsic value was likely to be a poor long-term investment. Daniel Defoe observed in the 1690s how stock for the East India Company was trading at what he believed was an elevated price of over 300% more than face value, &quot;without any material difference in Intrinsick [&quot;sic&quot;] value.&quot;

Hetty Green (1834-1916) was retrospectively described as &quot;America&#x27;s first value investor.&quot; She had a habit of buying unwanted assets at low prices, which she held, as she stated in 1905, &quot;until they go up [in price] and people are anxious to buy.&quot; 

The investing firm Tweedy, Browne was founded in 1920 and has been described as &quot;the oldest value investing firm on Wall Street&quot;. Founder Forest Berwind &quot;Bill&quot; Tweedy initially focused on shares of smaller companies, often family owned, which traded in lower numbers and lower volume than stock for larger companies. This niche allowed Tweedy to buy stocks at a significant discount to estimated book value due to the limited options for sellers. Tweedy and Benjamin Graham eventually became friends and worked out of the same New York City office building at 52 broadway. 

Economist John Maynard Keynes is also recognized as an early value investor. While managing the endowment of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge starting in the 1920s, Keynes first attempted a stock trading strategy based on market timing. When this method was unsuccessful, he turned to a strategy similar to value investing. In 2017, Joel Tillinghast of Fidelity Investments wrote:
:Instead of using big-picture economics, Keynes increasingly focused on a small number of companies that he knew very well. Rather than chasing momentum, he bought undervalued stocks with generous dividends. [...] Most were small and midsize companies in dull or out of favor industries, such as mining and autos in the midst of the Great Depression. Despite his rough start [by timing markets], Keynes beat the market averages by 6 percent a year over more than two decades.

Keynes used similar terms and concepts as Graham and Dodd (&quot;e.g.&quot; an emphasis on the intrinsic value of equities). A review of his archives at King&#x27;s College found no evidence of contact between Keynes and his American counterparts and Keynes is believed to have developed his investing theories independently. Keynes did not teach his concepts in classes or seminars, unlike Graham and Dodd, and details of his investing theories became widely known only decades after his death in 1946. There was &quot;considerable overlap&quot; of Keynes&#x27;s ideas with those of Graham and Dodd, though their ideas were not entirely congruent.

===Benjamin Graham===

Value investing was established by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd. Both were professors at Columbia Business School. In Graham&#x27;s book &quot;The Intelligent Investor&quot;, he advocated the concept of margin of safety. The concept was introduced in the book &quot;Security Analysis&quot; which he co-authored with David Dodd in 1934 and calls for an approach to investing that is focused on purchasing equities at prices less than their intrinsic values. In terms of picking or screening stocks, he recommended purchasing firms which have steady profits, are trading at low prices to book value, have low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios and which have relatively low debt.

===Further evolution===
However, the concept of value (as well as &quot;book value&quot;) has evolved significantly since the 1970s. Book value is most useful in industries where most assets are tangible. Intangible assets such as patents, brands, or goodwill are difficult to quantify, and may not survive the break-up of a company. When an industry is going through fast technological advancements, the value of its assets is not easily estimated. Sometimes, the production power of an asset can be significantly reduced due to competitive disruptive innovation and therefore its value can suffer permanent impairment. One good example of decreasing asset value is a personal computer. An example of where book value does not mean much is the service and retail sectors. One modern model of calculating value is the discounted cash flow model (DCF), where the value of an asset is the sum of its future cash flows, discounted back to the present.

== Quantitative value investing ==
Quantitative value investing, also known as &quot;Systematic value investing&quot;, is a form of value investing that analyzes fundamental data such as financial statement line items, economic data, and unstructured data in a rigorous and systematic manner. Practitioners often employ quantitative applications such as statistical / empirical finance or mathematical finance, behavioral finance, natural language processing, and machine learning.

Quantitative investment analysis can trace its origin back to &quot;Security Analysis&quot; by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd in which the authors advocated detailed analysis of objective financial metrics of specific stocks. Quantitative investing replaces much of the ad-hoc financial analysis used by human fundamental investment analysts with a systematic framework designed and programmed by a person but largely executed by a computer in order to avoid cognitive biases that lead to inferior investment decisions. In an interview, Benjamin Graham admitted that even by that time ad-hoc detailed financial analysis of single stocks was unlikely to produce good risk-adjusted returns. Instead, he advocated a rules-based approach focused on constructing a coherent portfolio based on a relatively limited set of objective fundamental financial factors.

Joel Greenblatt&#x27;s magic formula investing is a simple illustration of a quantitative value investing strategy. Many modern practitioners employ more sophisticated forms of quantitative analysis and evaluate numerous financial metrics, as opposed to just two as in the &quot;magic formula&quot;. James O&#x27;Shaughnessy&#x27;s What Works on Wall Street is a classic guide to quantitative value investing, containing backtesting performance data of various quantitative value strategies and value factors based on Compustat data from January 1927 until December 2009. 

==Value investing performance==

===Performance of value strategies===
Value investing has proven to be a successful investment strategy. There are several ways to evaluate the success. One way is to examine the performance of simple value strategies, such as buying low PE ratio stocks, low price-to-cash-flow ratio stocks, or low price-to-book ratio stocks. Numerous academics have published studies investigating the effects of buying value stocks. These studies have consistently found that value stocks outperform growth stocks and the market as a whole, not necessarily over short periods but when tracked over long periods, even going back to the 19th century. A review of 26 years of data (1990 to 2015) from US markets found that the over-performance of value investing was more pronounced in stocks for smaller and mid-size companies than for larger companies and recommended a &quot;value tilt&quot; with greater emphasis on value than growth investing in personal portfolios.

===Performance of value investors===
Since examining only the performance of the best known value investors introduces a selection bias (as typically investors might not become well known unless they are successful) a way to investigate the performance of a group of value investors was suggested by Warren Buffett in his 1984 speech The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville. In this speech, Buffett examined the performance of those investors who worked at Graham-Newman Corporation and were influenced by Benjamin Graham. Buffett&#x27;s conclusion was that value investing is on average successful in the long run. This was also the conclusion of the academic research on simple value investing strategies.

From 1965 to 1990 there was little published research and articles in leading journals on value investing.

==Well-known value investors==
===The Graham-and-Dodd Disciples===
====Ben Graham&#x27;s students====
Benjamin Graham is regarded by many to be the father of value investing. Along with David Dodd, he wrote &quot;Security Analysis&quot;, first published in 1934. The most lasting contribution of this book to the field of security analysis was to emphasize the quantifiable aspects of security analysis (such as the evaluations of earnings and book value) while minimizing the importance of more qualitative factors such as the quality of a company&#x27;s management. Graham later wrote &quot;The Intelligent Investor&quot;, a book that brought value investing to individual investors. Aside from Buffett, many of Graham&#x27;s other students, such as William J. Ruane, Irving Kahn, Walter Schloss, and Charles Brandes went on to become successful investors in their own right.

Irving Kahn was one of Graham&#x27;s teaching assistants at Columbia University in the 1930s. He was a close friend and confidant of Graham&#x27;s for decades and made research contributions to Graham&#x27;s texts &quot;Security Analysis&quot;, &quot;Storage and Stability&quot;, &quot;World Commodities and World Currencies&quot; and &quot;The Intelligent Investor&quot;. Kahn was a partner at various finance firms until 1978 when he and his sons, Thomas Graham Kahn and Alan Kahn, started the value investing firm, Kahn Brothers &amp; Company. Irving Kahn remained chairman of the firm until his death at age 109.

Walter Schloss was another Graham-and-Dodd disciple. Schloss never had a formal education. When he was 18, he started working as a runner on Wall Street. He then attended investment courses taught by Ben Graham at the New York Stock Exchange Institute, and eventually worked for Graham in the Graham-Newman Partnership. In 1955, he left Graham’s company and set up his own investment firm, which he ran for nearly 50 years. Walter Schloss was one of the investors Warren Buffett profiled in his famous Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville article.

Christopher H. Browne of Tweedy, Browne was well known for value investing. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Tweedy, Browne was the favorite brokerage firm of Benjamin Graham during his lifetime; also, the Tweedy, Browne Value Fund and Global Value Fund have both beat market averages since their inception in 1993. In 2006, Christopher H. Browne wrote &quot;The Little Book of Value Investing&quot; in order to teach ordinary investors how to value invest.

Peter Cundill was a well-known Canadian value investor who followed the Graham teachings. His flagship Cundill Value Fund allowed Canadian investors access to fund management according to the strict principles of Graham and Dodd. Warren Buffett had indicated that Cundill had the credentials he&#x27;s looking for in a chief investment officer.

====Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger====
Graham&#x27;s most famous student, however, is Warren Buffett, who ran successful investing partnerships before closing them in 1969 to focus on running Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett was a strong advocate of Graham&#x27;s approach and strongly credits his success back to his teachings. Another disciple, Charlie Munger, who joined Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway in the 1970s and has since worked as Vice Chairman of the company, followed Graham&#x27;s basic approach of buying assets below intrinsic value, but focused on companies with robust qualitative qualities, even if they weren&#x27;t statistically cheap. This approach by Munger gradually influenced Buffett by reducing his emphasis on quantitatively cheap assets, and instead encouraged him to look for long-term sustainable competitive advantages in companies, even if they weren&#x27;t quantitatively cheap relative to intrinsic value. Buffett is often quoted saying, &quot;It&#x27;s better to buy a great company at a fair price, than a fair company at a great price.&quot;

Buffett is a particularly skilled investor because of his temperament. He has a famous quote stating &quot;be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy.&quot; In essence, he updated the teachings of Graham to fit a style of investing that prioritizes fundamentally good businesses over those that are deemed cheap by statistical measures. He is further known for a talk he gave titled the Super Investors of Graham and Doddsville. The talk was an outward appreciation for the fundamentals that Benjamin Graham instilled in him.

====Michael Burry====
Dr. Michael Burry, the founder of Scion Capital, is another strong proponent of value investing. Burry is famous for being the first investor to recognize and profit from the impending subprime mortgage crisis, as portrayed by Christian Bale in the movie &quot;The Big Short&quot;. Burry has said on multiple occasions that his investment style is built upon Benjamin Graham and David Dodd’s 1934 book &quot;Security Analysis&quot;: &quot;All my stock picking is 100% based on the concept of a margin of safety.&quot;

====Other Columbia Business School value investors====
Columbia Business School has played a significant role in shaping the principles of the &quot;Value Investor&quot;, with professors and students making their mark on history and on each other. Ben Graham’s book, &quot;The Intelligent Investor&quot;, was Warren Buffett’s bible and he referred to it as &quot;the greatest book on investing ever written.”
A young Warren Buffett studied under Ben Graham, took his course and worked for his small investment firm, Graham Newman, from 1954 to 1956. Twenty years after Ben Graham, Roger Murray arrived and taught value investing to a young student named Mario Gabelli. 
About a decade or so later, Bruce Greenwald arrived and produced his own protégés, including Paul Sonkin—just as Ben Graham had Buffett as a protégé, and Roger Murray had Gabelli.

===Mutual Series and Franklin Templeton disciples===
Mutual Series has a well-known reputation of producing top value managers and analysts in this modern era. This tradition stems from two individuals: Max Heine, founder of the well regarded value investment firm Mutual Shares fund in 1949 and his protégé legendary value investor Michael F. Price. Mutual Series was sold to Franklin Templeton Investments in 1996. The disciples of Heine and Price quietly practice value investing at some of the most successful investment firms in the country. Franklin Templeton Investments takes its name from Sir John Templeton, another contrarian value oriented investor.

Seth Klarman, a Mutual Series alum, is the founder and president of The Baupost Group, a Boston-based private investment partnership, and author of &quot;Margin of Safety, Risk Averse Investing Strategies for the Thoughtful Investor&quot;, which since has become a value investing classic. Now out of print, &quot;Margin of Safety&quot; has sold on Amazon for $1,200 and eBay for $2,000.

===Other value investors===
Laurence Tisch, who led Loews Corporation with his brother, Robert Tisch, for more than half a century, also embraced value investing. Shortly after his death in 2003 at age 80, Fortune wrote, &quot;Larry Tisch was the ultimate value investor. He was a brilliant contrarian: He saw value where other investors didn&#x27;t -- and he was usually right.&quot; By 2012, Loews Corporation, which continues to follow the principles of value investing, had revenues of $14.6 billion and assets of more than $75 billion.

Michael Larson is the Chief Investment Officer of Cascade Investment, which is the investment vehicle for the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the Gates personal fortune. Cascade is a diversified investment shop established in 1994 by Gates and Larson. Larson graduated from Claremont McKenna College in 1980 and the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago in 1981. Larson is a well known value investor but his specific investment and diversification strategies are not known. Larson has consistently outperformed the market since the establishment of Cascade and has rivaled or outperformed Berkshire Hathaway&#x27;s returns as well as other funds based on the value investing strategy.

Martin J. Whitman is another well-regarded value investor. His approach is called safe-and-cheap, which was hitherto referred to as financial-integrity approach. Martin Whitman focuses on acquiring common shares of companies with extremely strong financial position at a price reflecting meaningful discount to the estimated NAV of the company concerned. Whitman believes it is ill-advised for investors to pay much attention to the trend of macro-factors (like employment, movement of interest rate, GDP, etc.) because they are not as important and attempts to predict their movement are almost always futile. Whitman&#x27;s letters to shareholders of his Third Avenue Value Fund (TAVF) are considered valuable resources &quot;for investors to pirate good ideas&quot; by Joel Greenblatt in his book on special-situation investment &quot;You Can Be a Stock Market Genius&quot;.

Joel Greenblatt achieved annual returns at the hedge fund Gotham Capital of over 50% per year for 10 years from 1985 to 1995 before closing the fund and returning his investors&#x27; money. He is known for investing in special situations such as spin-offs, mergers, and divestitures.

Charles de Vaulx and Jean-Marie Eveillard are well known global value managers. For a time, these two were paired up at the First Eagle Funds, compiling an enviable track record of risk-adjusted outperformance. For example, Morningstar designated them the 2001 &quot;International Stock Manager of the Year&quot; and de Vaulx earned second place from Morningstar for 2006. Eveillard is known for his Bloomberg appearances where he insists that securities investors never use margin or leverage. The point made is that margin should be considered the anathema of value investing, since a negative price move could prematurely force a sale. In contrast, a value investor must be able and willing to be patient for the rest of the market to recognize and correct whatever pricing issue created the momentary value. Eveillard correctly labels the use of margin or leverage as speculation, the opposite of value investing.

Other notable value investors include: Mason Hawkins, Thomas Forester, Whitney Tilson, Mohnish Pabrai, Li Lu, Guy Spier and Tom Gayner who manages the investment portfolio of Markel Insurance. San Francisco investing firm Dodge &amp; Cox, founded in 1931 and with one of the oldest US mutual funds still in existence as of 2019, emphasizes value investing.

==Criticism==
Value stocks do not always beat growth stocks, as demonstrated in the late 1990s. Moreover, when value stocks perform well, it may not mean that the market is inefficient, though it may imply that value stocks are simply riskier and thus require greater returns. Furthermore, Foye and Mramor (2016) find that country-specific factors have a strong influence on measures of value (such as the book-to-market ratio). This leads them to conclude that the reasons why value stocks outperform are country-specific.

Also, one of the biggest criticisms of price centric value investing is that an emphasis on low prices (and recently depressed prices) regularly misleads retail investors; because fundamentally low (and recently depressed) prices often represent a fundamentally sound difference (or change) in a company&#x27;s relative financial health. To that end, Warren Buffett has regularly emphasized that &quot;it&#x27;s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price, than to buy a fair company at a wonderful price.&quot;

In 2000, Stanford accounting professor Joseph Piotroski developed the F-score, which discriminates higher potential members within a class of value candidates. The F-score aims to discover additional value from signals in a firm&#x27;s series of annual financial statements, after initial screening of static measures like book-to-market value. The F-score formula inputs financial statements and awards points for meeting predetermined criteria. Piotroski retrospectively analyzed a class of high book-to-market stocks in the period 1976–1996, and demonstrated that high F-score selections increased returns by 7.5% annually versus the class as a whole. The American Association of Individual Investors examined 56 screening methods in a retrospective analysis of the financial crisis of 2008, and found that only F-score produced positive results.

=== Over-simplification of value ===
The term &quot;value investing&quot; causes confusion because it suggests that it is a distinct strategy, as opposed to something that all investors (including growth investors) should do. In a 1992 letter to shareholders, Warren Buffett said, &quot;We think the very term &#x27;value investing&#x27; is redundant&quot;. In other words, there is no such thing as &quot;non-value investing&quot; because putting your money into assets that you believe are overvalued would be better described as speculation, conspicuous consumption, etc., but not &quot;investing&quot;. Unfortunately, the term still exists, and therefore the quest for a distinct &quot;value investing&quot; strategy leads to over-simplification, both in practice and in theory.

Firstly, various naive &quot;value investing&quot; schemes, promoted as simple, are grossly inaccurate because they completely ignore the value of growth, or even of earnings altogether. For example, many investors look only at dividend yield. Thus they would prefer a 5% dividend yield at a declining company over a modestly higher-priced company that earns twice as much, reinvests half of earnings to achieve 20% growth, pays out the rest in the form of buybacks (which is more tax efficient), and has huge cash reserves. These &quot;dividend investors&quot; tend to hit older companies with huge payrolls that are already highly indebted and behind technologically, and can least afford to deteriorate further. By consistently voting for increased debt, dividends, etc., these naive &quot;value investors&quot; (and the type of management they tend to appoint) serve to slow innovation, and to prevent the majority of the population from working at healthy businesses.

Furthermore, the method of calculating the &quot;intrinsic value&quot; may not be well-defined. Some analysts believe that two investors can analyze the same information and reach different conclusions regarding the intrinsic value of the company, and that there is no systematic or standard way to value a stock. In other words, a value investing strategy can only be considered successful if it delivers excess returns after allowing for the risk involved, where risk may be defined in many different ways, including market risk, multi-factor models or idiosyncratic risk.

<text>The TSEC/KL-7, also known as Adonis was an off-line non-reciprocal rotor encryption machine. The KL-7 had rotors to encrypt the text, most of which moved in a complex pattern, controlled by notched rings. The non-moving rotor was fourth from the left of the stack. The KL-7 also encrypted the message indicator.

==History and development==
In 1945, the Army Security Agency (ASA) initiated the research for a new cipher machine, designated MX-507, planned as successor for the SIGABA and the less secure Hagelin M-209. In 1949, its development was transferred to the newly formed Armed Forces Security Agency (AFSA) who named the machine AFSAM-7, which stands for Armed Forces Security Agency Machine No 7.

It was the first rotor crypto machine, developed under one centralized cryptologic organisation as a standard machine for all parts of the armed forces, and the first cipher machine to use electronics (vacuum tubes), apart from the British ROCKEX, which was developed during World War 2. It was also the first cipher machine to use the re-entry (re-flexing, not to be confused with reflector) principle, conceived by Albert W. Small, which re-introduces the encryption output back into the encryption process to re-encipher it again, so that some symbols are ciphered more than once.

In 1953, AFSA&#x27;s successor, the U.S. National Security Agency, introduced the machine in the US Army and Air Force, the FBI and CIA. In 1955, the AFSAM-7 was renamed TSEC/KL-7, following the new standard crypto nomenclature. It was the most widely used crypto machine in the US armed forces until the mid-1960s and was the first machine capable of supporting large networks that was considered secure against known plaintext attack. Some 25,000 machines were in use in the mid-1960s. From 1956 on, the KL-7 was also introduced to all NATO countries.

The KL-7 used two encryption procedures, codename POLLUX and ADONIS. The POLLUX procedure sent the message indicator (i.e. start position of the rotors) in clear, and ADONIS sent the message indicator in encrypted form.

==Description==
The KL-7 was designed for off-line operation. It was about the size of a Teletype machine and had a similar three-row keyboard, with shift keys for letters and figures. The KL-7 produced printed output on narrow paper strips that were then glued to message pads. When encrypting, it automatically inserted a space between five-letter code groups. One of the reasons for the five letter groups was messages might be given to a morse code operator. The number of five letter groups was easily verified when transmitted. There was an adaptor available, the HL-1/X22, that allowed 5-level Baudot punched paper tape from Teletype equipment to be read for decryption. The standard KL-7 had no ability to punch tapes. A variant of the KL-7, the KL-47, could also punch paper tape for direct input to teleprinters.

==Product details==
Each rotor had 36 contacts. To establish a new encryption setting, operators would select a rotor and place it in a plastic outer ring at a certain offset. The ring and the offset to use for each position were specified in a printed key list. This process would be repeated eight times until all rotor positions were filled. Key settings were usually changed every day at midnight, GMT. The basket containing the rotors was removable, and it was common to have a second basket and set of rotors, allowing the rotors to be set up prior to key change. The old basket could then be kept intact for most of the day to decode messages sent the previous day, but received after midnight. Rotor wiring was changed every 1 to 3 years.

The keyboard itself was a large sliding switch, also called permutor board. A signal, coming from a letter key, went through the rotors, back to the permutor board to continue to the printer. The KL-7 was non-reciprocal. Therefore, depending on the &quot;Encipher&quot; or &quot;Decipher&quot; position of the permutor board, the direction of the signal through the rotors was changed.

The rotor basket had two sets of connectors, two with 26 pins and two with 10 pins, at each end that mated with the main assembly. Both 26 pin connectors were connected to the keyboard to enable the switching of the signal direction through the rotors. Both 10 pin connectors on each side were hard-wired with each other. If a signal that entered on one of the 26 pins left the rotor pack on one of these 10 pins, that signal was redirected back into the rotors on the entry side to perform a new pass through the rotors. This loop-back, the so-called re-entry, created complex scrambling of the signal and could result in multiple passes through the rotor pack, depending on the current state of the rotor wiring.

There was also a switch pile-up under each movable rotor that was operated by cams on its plastic outer ring. Different outer rings had different arrangements of cams. The circuitry of the switches controlled solenoids which in turn enabled the movement of the rotors. The combination of cam rings and the controlling of a rotor by several switches created a most complex and irregular stepping. The exact wiring between switches and solenoids is still classified.
The KL-7 was largely replaced by electronic systems such as the KW-26 ROMULUS and the KW-37 JASON in the 1970s, but KL-7s were kept in service as backups and for special uses. In 1967, when the U.S. Navy sailor John Anthony Walker walked into the embassy of the Soviet Union in Washington, DC seeking employment as a spy, he carried with him a copy of a key list for the KL-47. KL-7s were compromised at other times as well. A unit captured by North Vietnam is on display at NSA&#x27;s National Cryptologic Museum. The KL-7 was withdrawn from service in June 1983, and Canada&#x27;s last KL-7-encrypted message was sent on June 30, 1983, &quot;after 27 years of service.&quot;

The successor to the KL-7 was the KL-51, an off-line, paper tape encryption system that used digital electronics instead of rotors.

==Notes==
 Britannica (2005). Proc (2005) differs, saying that, &quot;after the Walker family spy ring was exposed in the mid-1980s (1985)...immediately, all KL-7&#x27;s were withdrawn from service&quot;

<text>, often stylized &quot;3B LAB.☆&quot;, &quot;3B Lab.Star&quot;, or &quot;3B Lab.s&quot;, is a Japanese punk rock group. Its members are Okahira Kenji who used to be in 19, Chiba Takatoshi who provided musics for Kawahara Ayako, Tamakoshi Masahiro, and Uneoki Shuji.

==History==
This punk rock band was formed in 2001 by Okahira Kenji, Chiba Takatoshi, and Tamakoshi Masahiro. They released their first album a year later under that name and their popularity increased.

Before their debut their name was &quot; 3B Lab☆ &quot; because there were three members (Kenji/Chiba/Tamakoshi) and each member had B-type blood (the &quot; ☆ &quot; represents a star which will brighten the future). Two members, Uneoki Shuji and Shoji, came later on because it was said that they needed some help playing at their lives. This, of course, wouldn&#x27;t make sense if their name was still &quot; 3B Lab☆&quot; with five members, so they added the &quot;s&quot; at the end, and became 3b Lab☆s.

Current members of 3B Lab:

*Kenji Okahira - vocal/harmonica/guitar
*Chiba Takatoshi - leader/bass
*Tamakoshi Masahiro - drums
*Shuji Uneoki - guitar

<text>William Fitzstephen (also William fitz Stephen), (died c. 1191) was a cleric and administrator in the service of Thomas Becket. In the 1170s he wrote a long biography of Thomas Becket – the &quot;Vita Sancti Thomae&quot; (Life of St. Thomas).

Fitzstephen had been Becket&#x27;s personal household clerk for ten years and, when Becket became Chancellor of England, Becket gave his clerk full authority to act in his name in diocesan matters. Fitzstephen became a subdeacon with responsibility for perusing letters and petitions involving the diocese.

Fitzstephen appeared with Becket at the council at Northampton Castle, where the archbishop was disgraced. When Becket was then forced into exile, after refusing to sign the Constitutions of Clarendon, King Henry II accepted a petition, in verse, from Fitzstephen and pardoned him from the banishment meted upon his master. When Becket and the king reconciled, Fitzstephen became his administrator once more. Fitzstephen records that he was among those of Becket&#x27;s advisors who cautioned against excommunicating king Henry. Fitzstephen was with Becket on the day of Becket&#x27;s assassination in Canterbury Cathedral in 1170.

Fitzstephen wrote a biography of Becket, in which he gives a clear description of the differences between the archbishop and the King. This also included an account of London in the 12th century, which was included in the biography as a preface, . The three editions of this work demonstrate a continuing familiarity with the life of the city, and for this reason he is not thought to be the same William Fitzstephen whom Henry appointed to be Sheriff of Gloucester and itinerant justice in 1171.

<text>The Dartmoor line is a railway line in Devon, England. From , the line runs alongside the Tarka Line to the site of the former Coleford Junction where it diverges west to . Previously a heritage line, it is owned by Network Rail.

The route was originally part of the London and South Western Railway&#x27;s route from Exeter to Plymouth, which was opened between 1865 and 1879. In 1968, British Rail closed the line beyond Meldon (two miles beyond Okehampton) as part of the Beeching cuts. The Exeter to Okehampton passenger service was withdrawn by British Rail in 1972. The line itself remained open for freight services from the railway ballast quarry at Meldon.

From 1997 to 2019, the line was operated as a heritage railway by the Dartmoor Railway community interest company. During this time, Great Western Railway ran a public service between Exeter and Okehampton on summer Sundays. Meldon quarry was mothballed in 2011, ceasing the use of the line for freight.

In July 2021, as part of the government&#x27;s Restoring Your Railway programme, the line was transferred to Network Rail ownership, and regular national rail passenger services began in November of the same year.

==History==
===Construction===
The Okehampton Railway, an independent company supported by the London and South Western Railway, was authorised on 17 July 1862 to build a line on the northern margins of Dartmoor from Coleford Junction (north west of Crediton) to . Before the line was built it had been leased to the LSWR and an extension authorised to Lidford. In 1864 it was renamed as the Devon and Cornwall Railway (which was absorbed into the LSWR in 1872, before the new line opened) and construction finally started. It opened slowly in sections: from Coleford Junction to on 1 November 1865; from there to Okehampton Road (later renamed ) on 8 January 1867; to itself on 3 October 1871; and finally to Lydford on 12 October 1874. This allowed trains to run a through service to .

The constructors of the line adopted a policy of navigating around natural obstacles, rather than going over or through them as earlier builders had done. The section from Coleford Junction through to North Tawton is simple and contains a straight section, but the line soon begins to curve as it climbs the edge at Dartmoor, at a 1 in 77 gradient. Okehampton station is located on the edge of the moor, above the town. The high point of the line is about two miles further, reaching near Meldon Viaduct.

The LSWR became a part of the new, larger Southern Railway at the Grouping in 1923. This in turn became the Southern Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948.

===British Rail===

At the peak of services through Okehampton in the 1950s, there were twelve or more daily trains in each direction; on summer Saturdays, this could increase with duplicate Atlantic Coast Express services. In the early 1960s, a car transporter train ran between Surbiton and Okehampton on summer Saturdays, bringing holidaymakers and their cars from the London area.

Trains between Exeter and Plymouth via Okehampton were withdrawn from 6 May 1968, leaving a shuttle service to run between Exeter and Okehampton. The section between Meldon Quarry and was lifted, and between Meldon and Okehampton the line was only retained for freight trains. Okehampton to Exeter passenger services were withdrawn on 5 June 1972.

Between 1972 and 1997, the line was used for railway ballast traffic from Meldon Quarry and occasional freight traffic to the remaining goods yard at Okehampton before its closure. Though the closure of the route was in part to save on the maintenance expenditure of Meldon Viaduct, the structure remained in use as a headshunt for the quarry, given a new layout in 1979 for increased traffic. Occasional charter and special trains were operated to Okehampton and Meldon Quarry during the passenger closure period. The railway reopened to regular passenger services in 1997 with the formation of Dartmoor Railway. 

===Heritage operation===
The Dartmoor line from Coleford Junction to Okehampton was in heritage operation from 1997 to 2019. The origins of the restored Dartmoor Railway lie in British Rail&#x27;s 1994 sale of Meldon Quarry to Camas Aggregates, a multinational quarrying company, along with the railway line up to its junction with Network Rail at Coleford. A collaboration between Devon County Council, West Devon Borough Council and the Dartmoor National Park Authority led to the creation of a plan to restore and regenerate the line and Okehampton station for tourism purposes, with the county council purchasing the station in 1996 for a nominal price from Camas.

Works to refurbish Okehampton station included renovating the station building, raising the platform, restoring the awning, and converting the goods shed into a youth hostel. Part of the building, which saw a grand reopening on 24 May 1997, was leased to a model shop and buffet, and the Dartmoor Railway began operation in 1997 with a fleet of historic locomotives, coaches, and diesel and electric multiple units, including classes 08, 47, 117, 205, 411, 421 and 438. Steam-hauled charter services also visited occasionally. RMS Locotec was contracted to maintain the line and rolling stock.
Meldon Viaduct, an iron truss bridge about further up the line from Okehampton, was designated as a scheduled monument and refurbished shortly after the opening of the heritage railway; a new station of the same name, unrelated to any historic station, was built at its eastern end in 2000 for the heritage railway. The track across the viaduct was lifted in 1990 as the structure was assessed to be too weak to take the weight of a train.

In September 2008, British American Railway Services Ltd, a company created by Iowa Pacific Holdings of Chicago, became the new owner of the Dartmoor Railway community interest company. The company announced its intention to develop freight, passenger and tourist services on the railway. Heritage services ran between Okehampton and Meldon Viaduct, extended to Sampford Courtenay, Bow or the Dartmoor Railway–Network Rail boundary on special event days. The former stations at North Tawton and Bow remain closed to passengers: both are privately-owned and have no public access. Themed trains were introduced for special occasions such as Christmas, with names like The Polar Express and The Train to Christmas Town.

The quarry at Meldon was mothballed in 2011, bringing an end to stone freight trains using the line. Heritage train services ceased in December 2019 and, in February 2020, the railway entered administration. Rolling stock based at Okehampton station was moved to Meldon Quarry, with most offered for resale.

====Public train services====
After the heritage Dartmoor Railway opened in 1997, First Great Western operated a summer Sunday service of four return trips direct from Exeter between May and September, sponsored by Devon County Council. These trains connected with bus services and heritage railway services at Okehampton, Tarka Line rail services at and other national rail services at Exeter.

Devon and Cornwall Railways (a subsidiary of British American Railway Services) announced its intention to operate through services from Okehampton to Exeter in 2010, having made a track access application to Network Rail on 18 March 2010 to operate four return services each weekday between Okehampton and and a further two (plus one on Sundays) as far as . The service would have run under an open access licence.

===Network Rail===

On 19 March 2021, it was announced that the Dartmoor Line would reopen to regular, year-round services by the end of the year as the first project delivered as part of the government&#x27;s &quot;Restoring Your Railway&quot; programme.

Preparatory work began on reopening the railway between Okehampton and Coleford Junction as soon as Government funding was confirmed in March. By May 2021, Network Rail had laid more than of new track, 24,000 concrete sleepers and of ballast, and installed drainage and new fencing. The total cost to reinstate the line was £40.5 million.

In July 2021, Network Rail took over formal ownership of the line from Aggregate Industries, a successor company to Camas, which had been leasing it to the Dartmoor Railway since 1994. It also acquired the northern part of Okehampton station from Devon County Council for £1, leaving the southern side with the council.

The new service started on 20 November 2021, with Great Western Railway running eight trains a day (one every two hours) to , with a journey time of around 40 minutes. On weekdays, five trains, including peak-time commuter services, continue to . The frequency has increased to hourly from May 2022, with more trains serving Exeter Central.

Services are run using s although s and / &#x27;Turbos&#x27; are also cleared to run on the route.

Following the reopening in 2021, plans and funding were announced for a new station named Okehampton Interchange east of Okehampton in November 2023. Funding was approved by the government in June 2024 as part of its Levelling-Up policy and the Devon Metro. The station is expected to be opened in 2026.

==Route==
The station buildings at Bow and North Tawton remain as private residences, while Sampford Courtenay and Meldon Viaduct stations are unused. Beyond Meldon, 11 miles of the former track bed to Lydford can be followed on foot or cycle along what is now called The Granite Way.

==Passenger volume==
The following station usage table shows only the National Rail service operated by Great Western Railway. It does not include the heritage trains operated on the railway up until 2019.

The annual passenger usage is based on sales of tickets in stated financial years from Office of Rail and Road estimates of station usage. The statistics are for passengers arriving and departing from each station and cover twelve-month periods that start in April. Methodology may vary year on year. Usage for the periods 2019–20 and 2020–21 onwards was affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.

The reopened line carried 250,000 in a little over its first year of operation.

<text>John Flavel (c. 1627–1691) was an English Puritan Presbyterian minister and author.

==Life==
Flavel, the eldest son of the Rev. Richard Flavel, described as &#x27;a painful and eminent minister,&#x27; who was incumbent successively of Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, Hasler and Willersey, Gloucestershire (from which last living he was ejected in 1662), was born in or about 1627 at Bromsgrove.

Having received his early education at the schools of the neighbourhood, he entered University College, Oxford, at an early age, and gained a good reputation for talent and diligence.

On 27 April 1650, he was sent by &#x27;the standing committee of Devon&#x27; to Diptford, a parish on the Avon, five miles from Totnes, where the minister, Mr. Walplate, had become infirm. On 17 October 1650, after examination and the preaching of a &#x27;trial sermon,&#x27; he was ordained Mr. Walplate&#x27;s assistant by the classis at Salisbury. He continued to minister at Diptford for about six years, succeeding the senior minister when he died, and endearing himself greatly to the people, not only by his earnestness, but by his easy dealings with them in the matter of tithes.

In 1656 he removed to Dartmouth, though the Diptford emoluments were much greater. On the passing of the Act of Uniformity (1662) he was ejected, but continued to preach in private until the Five Mile Act drove him from Dartmouth. He kept as near it, however, as possible, removing to Slapton, five miles off, and there preached twice each Sunday to all who came, among whom were many of his old parishioners. On the granting of the indulgence of 1671 he returned to Dartmouth, and continued to officiate there even after the liberty to do so was withdrawn. In the end he found himself obliged to remove to London, travelling by sea and narrowly escaping shipwreck in a storm, which is said to have ceased in answer to his prayers. Finding that he would be safer at Dartmouth he returned there, and met with his people nightly in his own house, until in 1687, on the relaxation of the penal laws, they built a meeting-house for him. Just before his death he acted as moderator at a meeting of dissenting ministers held at Topsham. He died suddenly of paralysis at Exeter on 26 June 1691, and was buried in Dartmouth churchyard.
==Family==
Flavel was four times married: first to Jane Randal; secondly, to Elizabeth Morries; thirdly, to Ann Downe; and, lastly, to a daughter of the Rev. George Jeffries.

There is a portrait of him in Dr Williams&#x27;s Library, London.

<doc id="1011270" wikidata="Q4950096" url="?curid=1011270" title="Bourbaki–Witt theorem">
<text>In mathematics, the Bourbaki–Witt theorem in order theory, named after Nicolas Bourbaki and Ernst Witt, is a basic fixed-point theorem for partially ordered sets. It states that if &quot;X&quot; is a non-empty chain complete poset, and 
formula_1 
such that 
formula_2 for all formula_3
then &quot;f&quot; has a fixed point. Such a function &quot;f&quot; is called &quot;inflationary&quot; or &quot;progressive&quot;.

== Special case of a finite poset ==

If the poset &quot;X&quot; is finite then the statement of the theorem has a clear interpretation that leads to the proof. The sequence of successive iterates, 

: formula_4

where &quot;x&quot;0 is any element of &quot;X&quot;, is monotone increasing. By the finiteness of &quot;X&quot;, it stabilizes:

: formula_5 for &quot;n&quot; sufficiently large. 

It follows that &quot;x&quot;∞ is a fixed point of &quot;f&quot;.

== Proof of the theorem ==

Pick some formula_6. Define a function &quot;K&quot; recursively on the ordinals as follows:

:formula_7

:formula_8

If formula_9 is a limit ordinal, then by construction 
formula_10 
is a chain in &quot;X&quot;. Define 
formula_11

This is now an increasing function from the ordinals into &quot;X&quot;. It cannot be strictly increasing, as if it were we would have an injective function from the ordinals into a set, violating Hartogs&#x27; lemma. Therefore the function must be eventually constant, so for some 
formula_12
that is,
formula_13

So letting 
formula_14 
we have our desired fixed point. Q.E.D.

==Applications==
The Bourbaki–Witt theorem has various important applications. One of the most common is in the proof that the axiom of choice implies Zorn&#x27;s lemma. We first prove it for the case where &quot;X&quot; is chain complete and has no maximal element. Let &quot;g&quot; be a choice function on 
formula_15
Define a function 
formula_1 
by 
formula_17

This is allowed as, by assumption, the set is non-empty. Then &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) &gt; &quot;x&quot;, so &quot;f&quot; is an inflationary function with no fixed point, contradicting the theorem.

This special case of Zorn&#x27;s lemma is then used to prove the Hausdorff maximality principle, that every poset has a maximal chain, which is easily seen to be equivalent to Zorn&#x27;s Lemma.

Bourbaki–Witt has other applications. In particular in computer science, it is used in the theory of computable functions.
It is also used to define recursive data types, e.g. linked lists, in domain theory.

<doc id="1011271" wikidata="Q6585127" url="?curid=1011271" title="Blogging in Iran">
<text>Following a crackdown on Iranian media beginning in 2000, many Iranians turned to weblogging to provide and find political news. The first Persian language blog is thought to have been created by Hossein Derakhshan, (in Canada), in 2001. Derakhshan also provided readers with a simple instruction manual in Persian on how to start a blog. In 2004, a census of blogs around the world by the NITLE found 64,000 Persian language blogs. In that year the Islamic government also began to arrest and charge bloggers as political dissidents and by 2005 dozens of bloggers had been arrested.

==History==
Early 2001 was the beginning of emergence of a blogging culture, which rapidly developed. the Iranian government, which had strict controls in place for the print media and had shut down as many as 100 print newspapers. Iran has been listed consistently as among the bottom countries in violation of freedom of the press by Reporters without Borders. Yet the internet provided a new means for widespread readership which was, up until 2004, was mostly unregulated, providing an outlet for mostly youth to express themselves freely. In 2009, due to the contentious nature of the presidential elections, and the rise of the green party movement, internet crackdowns have become far more strict. Despite 43% of the internet is using wordpress to create blogs to express their thoughts on the internet, the Iranian government strictly controls the internet making it tough for anyone to express their view online.

Nonetheless, , according to the CIA world factbook, 8.214 million internet users in Iran, ranked 35th in the world. Blogs range from updates on art and critiquing movies, to following injustices of political prisoners. Diasporic Persian and Iranian blogs have also become a trend as a means to be part of an international online community. Blogs may be used as a virtual means of social protest without assembly, such as when thousands of bloggers renamed their blogs Akbar Ganji for a week in 2005, in support of the arrested critic of the regime. Hossien Derakhshan, the unofficial &quot;godfather&quot; of the blogosphere, set his up in Canada in September 2001. He was later arrested. In 2011, Iranian authorities executed more than 600 people and imprisoned more journalists and bloggers than any other country.

==Scope==
The broad usage of weblogs in Iran was staggering. , the NITLE (National Institute for Technology in Liberal Education)blog census found the number of blogs in Persian surpassed 64,000. Some believe that the influence of these blogs have been exaggerated, in that their authors are predominantly upper and upper-middle class. However, the education system in Iran gives access to education and therefore new technologies, computers and the internet as a whole to large numbers of lower-class people.

==Appeal==
Blogs often give a sense of anonymity.

==Political importance==
Blogging in Iran took on political importance as the regime continued its crackdown on journalists. The Iranian press is highly regulated, especially under the Press Law, which according to the UNHCR, &quot;forbids the publication of ideas that are contrary to Islamic principles or detrimental to public rights.&quot; This includes imprisonment for &quot;propaganda,&quot; which remains undefined, and for offenses that are &quot;an insult to religion.&quot;

Because as many as 100 publications were shut down in the early 2000s, many sought alternative outlets for reporting and freedom of expression. This often came about in critiques of the regime, which was relatively unregulated until 2004. Implicit and explicit condemnation is common, such as is evident in the following excerpts. 
&quot;11 July 2003: On occasion something happens in life that makes you want to believe in miracles. Like today! Coming across a copy of Kieslowski&#x27;s Three colours Blue/ White/ Red among the videos at home- without anyone remembering having borrowed it from a friend... This was one of those majestic miracles that only a higher being can bestow on a special someone like me. Thank You God!&quot; The viewing of movies in ones home is forbidden, as are most western films. More explicit expressions of dissent as also common: &quot;25 November 2002: Every Day new intrigues and tyrannies by our repressive turbaned rulers...And crazy Muslims around the world that bring nothing but carnage and shame...I swear to god...if it weren&#x27;t for clergy like Eshkavari who keep telling us that what they do is not Islam...I would abandon this little faith once and for all&quot;

Iranian officials became concerned that the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine might induce foreign attempts to support a similar revolution in Iran, by building civil society networks and empowering activists as had happened in Ukraine. This was compounded by the 2006 announcement by the U.S. State Department that it was creating a $75 million fund to &quot;reach out to the people of Iran&quot;. This caused the Iranian government to closely monitor foreign support for bloggers and journalists.

In 2004 the government began to arrest and charge bloggers as political dissidents. It also began demanding shutdowns and screening of internet service providers, a big step in restriction that had been relatively unregulated.

In 2005 the BBC World Service Trust started the Iran Media Development Project, to support new media in Iran, following on from earlier projects such as Jadid Media funded by the Netherlands. In 2006 it created a secure training and mentoring website for aspiring Iranian and Afghan bloggers and journalists, with an online magazine edited by Sina Motalebi for the trainees supported by a radio programme for young people in Iran, called ZigZag.

Circa 2006 estimates suggested there were about 500,000 to 800,000 blogs in Iran, though not all were active.

In 2009, internet users and particularly bloggers and online journalists were targeted for arrest and violence after the contested re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad who won by a landslide, inciting fraud allegations. Critical publications were shut down and the largest number of journalists were jailed since the 1979 revolution. The Press Law was also formally extended to &quot;all internet publications&quot; which may include blogs, requiring the authors to get licenses. According to ONI, with the sophisticated system of internet filtering developed by Iran, the websites Blogger and Persianblog are often blocked. Yet in response to the vitality of the Iranian blogosphere, the government decided to pursue other tactics simultaneously, announcing in late 2008 its intention to create thousands of pro government blogs, including one by the president himself. Thus the internet, and in particular blogs became an important front in informal political debate, declarations, and dissatisfaction.

==Hossein Derakhshan==
Born in Iran in 1975, Hossein Derakhshan, commonly referred to as the &quot;blogging godfather&quot; or the &quot;blogfather,&quot; moved to Canada in 2000. His blog became the first Persian blog, and took off in 2001 with his simple instruction manual on how to set up and write a Persian-language blog. In 2003 his blog became highly political, encouraging opposition through writing.

In 2006 he went back to the middle east, visited Egypt and met with Egyptian blogger when the Egyptian blogosphere was also at its peak activity. In the same tour Hissein visited Israel publicly, seeking to mend relations between Iran and Israel, which are sworn enemies. In the same year, he also backed presidential candidate Ahmadinejad. In 2008 he was arrested while visiting family in Iran and was sentenced to 19 and a half years in prison, banned from political party membership for five years, and ordered to repay earnings of around $44,500 for &quot;propagating against the regime&quot; and &quot;co-operating with hostile states.&quot; In 2010 he was temporarily released on bail of 1.5 million dollars.

==Shirin Ebadi nobel peace prize news==
The power of the Iranian blogs was demonstrated in 2003, with the Iranian human rights lawyer Shirin Ebadi winning the Nobel Peace Prize. Because her human rights work had much to do with representing women, children, and dissidents against the regime, the official Iranian news failed to report the win. Several hours later it included in the nightly news a 15-second mention of the win, while failing to report her actual accomplishments aside for &quot;a children&#x27;s charity.&quot; Rather than traditional channels, therefore, the news and reactions to it spread on multiple blogs. Nasrin Alavi, author of We Are Iran, brings the statistics of www.damasanj.com, a website which works out which stories are most talked about in the Iranian blogosphere, which found that Ebadi dominated the top ten Rankings.8 Most were congratulatory, and sought to provide bios and facts on the nature of Ebadi&#x27;s work, which the traditional press had failed to print. 
Bloggers went a step farther when they organized a reception for Ebadi at the Teheran airport upon her return on October 14, 2003. They called for people to celebrate her victory, as well as use the venue to protest the current situation of women&#x27;s rights and oppression. Rather than the media, it was bloggers that provided up to date pictures of the reception to the public. Thousands of people attended, proving that bloggers could translate to actual events. Eventually this forced the government to respond to Ebadi&#x27;s Prize in a more serious light: it cast Ebadi as an apostate and a member of a foreign conspiracy against Iran.

==Bam==
The December 2003 Bam earthquake caused particular outrage and made clear the necessity for blogging as a news source. While the regime was ill-equipped to deal with the disaster where an estimated 30,000 people lost their lives. The aftermath was tremendous in damages, and a lack of journalists to cover the quake. Blogs, therefore, became a central source of information. For example, Dr. Marajan Haj-Ahmadi&#x27;s blog became one of the most read, as she was based in the bordering city of Kerman and was able to report from the area and provide information as to the medical inadequacies. Others included Baba&#x27;s blog, an anonymous ex-newspaper journalist who entered the region to provide accurate news reports from the disaster zone. The survivors of the Bam earthquake also began protesting due to lack of governmental support, which went unreported in the official news but the shooting of two individuals at a Friday prayer was reported by bloggers.

In her book &quot;We are Iran: The Persian Blogs&quot; Nasrin Alavi claims that the earthquake was a turning point for blogs being organizing forces as well as partnering with NGO&#x27;s rather than governmental organizations:

The translation from a virtual page into actual human mobility lent legitimacy to the blogger movement, as well as proving it to be a resilient form of networking that had practical applications. It also proved the fears of the government in that it began to resemble a movement rather than simply disconnected expressions of personal experiences.

===Transition to Facebook===
While blogging remains a key form of political protest, in the 2009 uprisings, Facebook began to take a more central role. The physical, rather than virtual protests spread through word-of-mouth rather than blogs. When possible, instances of police abuse were captured on mobile phone videos and then uploaded to YouTube, most famously the video of Neda Agha Soltan being shot to death in the streets of Teheran. These videos were shared on Facebook, fueling the protests. Originally blocked by the government in 2006, it had been unblocked in 2009, just months before the protests.

==Language: the Use of English and other foreign languages==
More recently, Persian has become just one of many Iranian blog languages. English in particular is used. This is both because it is a relatively well known second language due to high education levels, and to expose the outside world to the goings on in Iran. Several influential bloggers made a plea to other bloggers to use this medium to increase international outrage at the Iranian regime. It also seeks to provide a lens from which to see the Iranian people as separate from their repressive government. Additionally, many blogs being read are written abroad by diasporic communities of Iranians throughout the globe. Many of their families left during the Brain-drain following the Islamic revolution in 1979 and after, creating a dedicated politically motivated and educated author base. These people use their native or adopted languages in addition to Persian.

==Women in blogging==
Some of the most popular Iranian bloggers are women. The outlet often provides a means to escape the need to identify oneself openly, particularly as family honor can be associated with women. The internet provides a means to talk about the restrictions on women, including the mandatory Hijab. Women can communicate with men openly as contributors of commentators on each other&#x27;s blog, even having virtual boyfriends online. They can talk about premarital sex, underground parties, alcohol and other youth activities often frowned upon or considered illegal. It also allows for following fashion trends, music, and feminist news. For example, one blogger addresses the issue of prostitution under the regime, which is formally denied. &quot;22 August 2003: some facts: The rate of runaway girls has grown 20 times between the periods of 1986-1999, with the average age of girls now 14.7...the average age of prostitutes has dropped from 27 to 20 years.&quot; Due to the extremely high education rate of women, females even surpassing males in enrollment in university, access and literacy are readily available. Some popular female bloggers include
2003 student uprisings Iran
In 2003 there were a series of student uprisings throughout the country, despite widespread repression during 1999 riots. largely reported on blogs, providing news and updates for others, while it was not being reported by the press. This allowed for more organized, planned protests. Eventually they too were repressed, but not without using the internet and blogs as a means to defy authority.

<text>Yvan Goll (also written Iwan Goll, Ivan Goll; born Isaac Lang; 29 March 1891 – 27 February 1950) was a French-German poet who was bilingual and wrote in both French and German. He had close ties to both German expressionism and to French surrealism.

==Biography==
Yvan Goll was born at Sankt Didel, Alsace-Lorraine, in what was then in Germany. His father was a cloth merchant from a Jewish family from Rappoltsweiler in Alsace. After his father&#x27;s death when he was six years old, his mother joined relatives in Metz, then a major town of Lorraine in the 1871 German Empire (after 1918 the area was claimed by France). In this predominantly Lorraine/French-speaking western part of Alsace-Lorraine, high school education inevitably involved German. Later he went to Strasbourg and studied law at the university there, as well as in Freiburg and Munich, where he graduated in 1912. In 1913, Goll participated in the expressionist movement in Berlin. His first published poem of note, &quot;Der Panamakanal&quot; (The Panama Canal), contrasts a tragic view of human civilization-destroying nature, with an optimistic ending that evokes human brotherhood and the heroic construction of the canal. However, a later version of the poem from 1918 ends more pessimistically. At the outbreak of World War I he escaped to Switzerland to avoid conscription, and became friends with the dadaists of Zürich&#x27;s Cabaret Voltaire, in particular Hans Arp, but also Tristan Tzara and Francis Picabia. He wrote many war poems, the most famous being 1916&#x27;s &quot;Requiem for the Dead of Europe&quot;, as well as several plays, including &quot;The Immortal One&quot; (1918).

It was in 1917, while in Switzerland that Goll met German writer and journalist Klara Aischmann, better known as Claire Goll. They settled in Paris in 1919 and married in 1921. In his essays, such as &quot;Die drei guten Geister Frankreichs&quot; (The Three Good Spirits of France), Goll promoted a better understanding between the peoples of France and Germany, even though he was personally more attracted to France by the greater liveliness of the art scene there. It was in Paris that his Expressionist style began to develop towards Surrealism, as witnessed in drama and film scenarios he wrote there, such as &quot;Die Chapliniade&quot; (The Chaplinade) and &quot;Mathusalem&quot; (Methusalem). These works blend fantasy, reality, and the absurd, continuing and extending the Expressionist program of arousing audience response by means of shock effects. They also reveal the autobiographical nature of much of Goll&#x27;s writing, but also his tendency to appear in the guise of a persona rather than in the first person.
While in Paris he also worked as a translator into German (Blaise Cendrars and Ulysses, among others) and into French, adapting Georg Kaiser&#x27;s &quot;Fire at the Opera&quot; (&quot;Der Brand im Opernhaus&quot;, 1919) for &quot;Théâtre de l&#x27;Œuvre&quot;. He formed many friendships with artists and his collection &quot;The New Orpheus&quot; was illustrated by Georg Grosz, Robert Delaunay and Fernand Léger. Marc Chagall illustrated a collection of love poems by both Golls, and Pablo Picasso illustrated Yvan&#x27;s &quot;Élégie d&#x27;Ihpetonga suivi des masques de cendre&quot; (1949; &quot;Elegy of Ihpetonga and Masks of Ashes&quot;). Goll also published anthologies of other French and German poets, as well as translations. In 1924 he founded the magazine &quot;Surréalisme&quot;, publishing the first &quot;Manifeste du surréalisme&quot; and quarreled with André Breton and friends. In 1927, he wrote the libretto for a surrealist opera, &quot;Royal Palace&quot;, set to music by composer Kurt Weill. He also wrote the scenario for &quot;Der Neue Orpheus&quot;, a cantata set by Weill, and the opera &quot;Mélusine&quot;, set by Marcel Mihalovici in 1920 and again, this time in German, by Aribert Reimann in 1971.

As Nazi persecution grew in Germany during the 1930s, the theme of the wandering Jew became central to Goll&#x27;s poetry. In 1936, he published an epic poem entitled &quot;La chanson de Jean Sans Terre&quot; (the song of John, King of England), with illustrations contributed by Marc Chagall. &quot;Jean Sans Terre&quot; was the youngest son of Henry II of England; following the battle of Bouvines, John lost the duchy of Normandy to King Philip II of France, which resulted in the collapse of most of the Angevin Empire and contributed to the subsequent growth in power of the Capetian dynasty during the 13th century. The central figure, who wanders the earth in 69 smaller poems, belongs everywhere and nowhere. He looks for love and identity and yet the absence of these things also acts as a kind of freedom. From 1939–1947 the Golls were exiles in New York, where friends included Richard Wright, Stefan Zweig, Henry Miller, Kenneth Patchen, Piet Mondrian, and William Carlos Williams who translated some of Yvan&#x27;s poems. Between 1943 and 1946, Goll edited the French-American poetry magazine &quot;Hémispheres&quot; with works by Saint-John Perse, Césaire, Breton ... and young American poets.

In 1945, the year he was diagnosed with leukemia, he wrote &quot;Atom Elegy&quot; and other death-haunted poems collected in the English language volume &quot;Fruit From Saturn&quot; (1946). This poetic language of this final phase in Goll&#x27;s work is rich in chthonic forces and imagery, the disintegration of matter - inspired by the atomic bomb - alchemy, and the Kabbalah, which Goll was reading at the time. &quot;Love Poems&quot;, written with his wife Claire, appeared in 1947. These poems, written in a pure and lucid style, speak of the poets&#x27; love and their need of each other, but also of jealousy, fear of betrayal, and a clash of temperaments. Goll&#x27;s final works were written in German rather than French, and were collected by the poet under the title &quot;Traumkraut&quot; (a neologism - meaning something like &#x27;Dream Weed&#x27;). Here, in his poetic testament, Goll mastered the synthesis of Expressionism and Surrealism that his work had hinted at most of his life; it was for this reason that he asked his wife to destroy all his previous work. These were eventually edited and brought to publishing by Claire. Goll died aged 58, at Neuilly-sur-Seine, and was buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery opposite the grave of Frédéric Chopin. The epitaph on his tombstone contains the following extract from &quot;Jean Sans Terre&quot;:
In 1953 Claire confronted the poet&#x27;s friend, Paul Celan with the accusation of plagiarism, unjustly claiming that Celan had copied from Yvan Goll&#x27;s &quot;Traumkraut&quot;; Celan committed suicide in 1970.

Claire Goll died in 1977, and bequeathed to the town of Saint-Die-des-Vosges several French manuscripts, the couple&#x27;s library, their works of art and furniture. The set - including a reconstruction of his Parisian apartment - is now on display at the Museum Pierre-Noël.

<text>Stevens High School is the only public high school in Claremont, New Hampshire, United States. It is in the center of the city on the corner of Broad and Summer streets. It was founded in 1868, the result of a $20,000 donation by Paran Stevens to Claremont with the proviso that the city appropriate a like sum. In the early 1990s, the school gained status as the host to one of the earlier Apple Macintosh user groups, primarily attended by high school faculty. Stevens High School is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges as well as the State of New Hampshire Department of Education.

==History==

In the 1850s, the city of Claremont approached the state Legislature asking permission to build a public high school. At the time, public high schools did not exist in New Hampshire. The state agreed, and decided to offer permission to every town in the state so that every town could establish public high schools. Paran Stevens then made his offer to fund 50% of the $20,000 cost of development.

Stevens was a Claremont native who was the manager of the Tremont House hotel in Opera House Square, the precursor to the Moody Hotel. He eventually became the most well-known hotelier in America, managing the New England, Revere House, and the Tremont House in Boston, as well as the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York City, among others. He was the grandfather of British humanitarian Louise Paget.

The centrally-located, nearly two-acre lot on which the building sits originally housed the homestead of politician George B. Upham. The original school building contained four classrooms, a basement for heating and facilities, and a function hall on the top floor. In 1868, the citizens of Claremont voted to name the school after Stevens. Its original enrollment was 98 students, taught by 4 faculty and principal Dr. Nathan Barrows. Stevens established a permanent trust of $10,000 to help with the financial administration of the school.

Stevens died in 1872, leaving his daughters $10 million in inheritance, which allowed his daughter Mary (also known as Minnie) to become a wealthy socialite in London society and marry General Sir Arthur Henry Fitzroy Paget. Stevens added $40,000 to his trust for the high school. He also donated life-size portraits of George Washington and Daniel Webster, which still hang on the walls of the auditorium, and a Chickering concert grand piano. The portrait of Washington is influenced by Gilbert Stuart&#x27;s Lansdowne portrait, and the portrait of Webster is based on one by Albert Gallatin Hoit that originally hung in the Revere House.

Graduates of Stevens High School formally established an Alumni Association in 1882. It has been continually active ever since, holding annual reunions, and claims to be the oldest continually active high school alumni association in the country.

Stevens High School built its first addition in 1909, due to its increased student body of 156. The front of the building was expanded, adding a laboratory, classroom, a manual training room in the basement, and a headmaster&#x27;s office. Enrollment quickly grew to 217 by 1914, and the building was expanded again. Enrollment was at 434 in 1929, and a third subsequent expansion added an annex of fifteen classrooms, a gymnasium, and a remodel of the auditorium and older portions of the building. The building did not need another major renovation until 1962, with the baby boomers entering high school. The student body was nearly 600 at the time, prompting a new cafeteria, improved gymnasium facilities, and twelve new classrooms. The final annex was extended along the back of the building. SHS was an early concert location for the band Aerosmith in 1971.

The school was renovated extensively in the 1990s due to accreditation issues. Its most recent renovation, completed in 2014, cost more than $12.6 million and restored original hardwood floors and other architectural elements, brought the facilities up to code, and addressed many long-standing structural issues.

==Campus==
The school is located in a single building on the corner of Broad and Summer streets in downtown Claremont. The front of the building is the original structure, built in 1868, which consists of three floors of classrooms (including lab facilities for science classes) and administrative offices. It has been renovated several times over the years. Behind this are two expansions, one in the middle that includes three floors of classrooms and a gymnasium, and another annexation in the back, which holds two floors of classrooms and the cafeteria. The school has no student parking facilities and relies on the city&#x27;s parking spaces along the median in front of the building, as well as street parking along Broad Street and Summer Street. Owing to its central location, the school does not have its own athletic fields, and instead has an agreement with the city of Claremont to use the city&#x27;s facilities at neighboring Monadnock Park and Barnes Park.

==Curriculum==
The school offers five Advanced Placement classes, leading to the AP Exam: Calculus II, Language and Composition, Literature and Composition, U.S. History, and Physics II. During the 2000–2001 school year, Stevens High School moved from a seven period day to a standard 4 x 4 block schedule, though it was changed back during the 2024-2025 school year. All class periods are 45 minutes in length, meeting 7 times per week. One credit is granted for each class that meets daily for a full year. One half credit is granted for a class that meets daily for one semester. A minimum of 20 credits is required for graduation along with 48 hours of community service. With approval from faculty and administrations, juniors and seniors are allowed to take one course (per Dartmouth term) at nearby Dartmouth College, provided they have already exhausted curricular alternatives at the high school. Stevens also offers courses in conjunction with the local Sugar River Regional Technical Center, and specific courses that offer credit within the Community College System of New Hampshire

==Athletics and extracurricular activities==
Stevens High School&#x27;s colors are red and black, and its mascot is the cardinal. The school&#x27;s recognized fight song is &quot;Glory to Stevens&quot;, sung to the melody of &quot;Glory to Dartmouth&quot;, the fight song of nearby Dartmouth College. Its varsity sports include baseball, football, softball, basketball (boys and girls), golf, spirit team, cross country, skiing, swimming, field hockey, soccer (boys and girls), tennis, track &amp; field, and bowling (co-ed).

The school&#x27;s extracurricular activities include Amnesty International, Interact, Color Guard, Jazz Band, Stevenaires, St. Paul&#x27;s Summer Program, Key Club, Literary Club, Fall Production, Comedic Acting, Senior Play, Honors Theater, Musical Theater, National Honor Society, Environmental Club, Envirothon Team, Newspaper (Journalism), Student Council, Peer Outreach, Project Challenge, Boy&#x27;s State, Girl&#x27;s State, Granite State Challenge, and Quiz Bowl.

<text>Paul Leicester Ford (March 23, 1865 – May 8, 1902) was an American novelist and biographer, born in Brooklyn, the son of Gordon Lester Ford and Emily Fowler Ford (a granddaughter of Noah Webster and lifelong friend of Emily Dickinson).

==Life and work==
Ford was the great-grandson of Noah Webster and the brother of historian Worthington C. Ford. He wrote of the lives of George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and others, edited the works of Thomas Jefferson, and wrote a number of novels which had considerable success, including &quot;The Honorable Peter Stirling&quot;, &quot;Story of an Untold Love&quot;, &quot;Janice Meredith&quot;, &quot;Wanted a Matchmaker&quot;, and &quot;Wanted a Chaperon&quot;.

Ford&#x27;s edition of &quot;The Writings of Thomas Jefferson&quot; is still regarded as one of the monuments of American historical scholarship, setting the standard for documentary editing for half a century until the appearance of the first volume of &quot;The Papers of Thomas Jefferson&quot;, edited by Julian P. Boyd. Ford&#x27;s edition remains valuable for its accuracy of transcription from original manuscripts and its careful annotation of the documents chosen for publication. The Ford edition appeared in two versions, a 10 volume edition published between 1892 and 1896 and a 12 volume limited numbered edition issued in 1904, known as the &quot;Federal&quot; edition.

Ford was an elected member of the American Philosophical Society.

Ford was a close personal friend of George Washington Vanderbilt II. He often visited Vanderbilt at Biltmore Estate where they read, played chess and enjoyed the outdoors. Vanderbilt dedicated a stained glass window to Ford at the church Vanderbilt had built at Biltomre, the Cathedral of All Souls (Asheville, North Carolina). 
Ford was murdered in his Manhattan home by his brother Malcolm Webster Ford, at one time the most famous amateur athlete in the United States, who then committed suicide.

<doc id="1011288" wikidata="Q1494558" url="?curid=1011288" title="Garshuni">
<text>Garshuni or Karshuni (Syriac alphabet: , Arabic alphabet: ) are Arabic writings using the Syriac alphabet. The word &quot;Garshuni&quot;, derived from the word &quot;grasha&quot; which literally translates as &quot;pulling&quot;, was used by George Kiraz to coin the term &quot;garshunography&quot;, denoting the writing of one language in the script of another.

==History==
Garshuni originated in the seventh century, when Arabic was becoming the dominant spoken language in the Fertile Crescent, but the Arabic alphabet was not yet fully developed. There is evidence that writing Arabic in Garshuni influenced the style of modern Arabic script.

After this initial period, Garshuni writing has continued to the present day among some Syriac Christian communities in the Arabic-speaking regions of the Levant and Mesopotamia, who commonly use the Sertâ script.

==Characteristics==
The Syriac alphabet has three principal varieties:
* Estrangelâ (the Classical Syriac script),
* Madnhâyâ (the Eastern Syriac script, often called &quot;Assyrian&quot; or &quot;Nestorian&quot;),
* Sertâ (the Western Syriac script, often called &quot;Jacobite&quot; or &quot;Maronite&quot;).

The Syriac alphabet is extended by use of diacritics to write Arabic Garshuni.

==Similarities==
Occasionally, other languages such as Turkish, Persian, Sogdian, the Kurdish languages and Malayalam have been written in the Syriac alphabet, and these are sometimes also referred to as &quot;Garshunis&quot;. With several additional characters, the Malayalam version is better known as Karsoni and had been in use till early 20th century among the Keralite Syriac Christian clergymen and followers.

For the analogous Jewish practice of writing Arabic in Hebrew letters, see Judeo-Arabic languages.

Today, Assyrians use the word &#x27;garshuni&#x27; when referring to a spoken language written using something other than its corresponding script, i.e. spoken Assyrian written using Latin script.

<text>The Moldova national football team () represents Moldova in men&#x27;s international football and is administered by the Moldovan Football Federation, the governing body for football in Moldova. Moldova&#x27;s home ground is Zimbru Stadium in Chișinău and their head coach is Serghei Cleșcenco. Shortly before the break-up of the Soviet Union, they played their first match against Georgia on 2 July 1991.

Two of their three best results in the 2020s came during the qualifiers for UEFA Euro 2024, with a win over Poland (3–2) in Chișinău, coming back from a 0–2 deficit, and a draw against Czech Republic (0–0) in Chișinău. In 2007, Moldova upset Hungary 3–0 in Chișinău in Euro 2008 qualifying. Another notable result was a 5–2 win over Montenegro during 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying. The team has never qualified for the final stages of the UEFA European Championship nor the FIFA World Cup since first entering qualifying in 1994.

Following Moldova&#x27;s 4–0 defeat to England in September 1997, British writer and comedian Tony Hawks travelled to Moldova to challenge and beat all 11 Moldovan international footballers at tennis. The feature film version of the book of the same name, &quot;Playing the Moldovans at Tennis&quot;, was filmed in and around Chișinău in May and June 2010 and was released in the spring of 2012.

==History==
===1990s===
The Moldovan Football Federation was founded in 1990. However, the national football team of Moldova did not play an official international match until 1991, when Moldova lost 4–2 to Georgia. Alexandru Spiridon was the first player to score a goal in the team&#x27;s history.

Moldova entered the 1992 Jordan International Tournament, a tournament consisting of friendly matches. Moldova obtained its biggest win to date, a 5–0 victory against Pakistan, in which Serghei Alexandrov scored four goals, this being Moldova&#x27;s first hat-trick. Moldova&#x27;s second hat-trick was scored by Iurie Miterev in a 3–1 win against Congo in the same tournament.

Moldova became an UEFA member in 1993 and a FIFA member in 1994. Moldova&#x27;s first match recognised by FIFA was a 1–1 draw against the United States. Moldova&#x27;s first attempt to qualify for an international tournament was in UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying, its first competitive match being a 1–0 win over Georgia. The Moldovans beat Georgia twice and Wales once, placing 4th out of 6 and failing to qualify. Moldova&#x27;s following qualifying campaign, their first attempt to qualify for the FIFA World Cup, was the 1998 qualifiers, but they lost all matches, placing last in the group. Moldova also placed last in UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying. The Moldovans obtained 4 draws, two with Northern Ireland, one each with Turkey and Finland.

===2000s===
In 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification Moldova lost 6–0 against Sweden, which stood as its biggest defeat for almost 20 years. Moldova was the second-last team in the group above Azerbaijan, which it beat 2–0. In UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying the Moldovans beat Austria and Belarus, placing above the latter in the group. Moldova finished last in 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification, however it drew with Norway and Scotland.

In a 2006 friendly against Lithuania, Serghei Cleșcenco scored his 11th and last goal, remaining Moldova&#x27;s top goalscorer until 2023. In UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Moldova finished fifth in the seven-team Group C with 12 points, beating Bosnia and Herzegovina 1–0 and Hungary 3–0. Following these qualifiers Moldova placed 37th in April 2008 FIFA Ranking, the highest position it ever reached. In 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification the Moldovans placed last in the group. They drew with Greece once and Luxembourg twice. Between the games for these qualifiers Moldova beat Armenia 4–1 in Yerevan in a friendly match.

===2010s===

Moldova beat Finland 2–0 in Euro 2012 qualifying, placing only above San Marino. The Moldovans finished only above San Marino again in 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying, but they beat Montenegro 5–2 and drew with Ukraine and Poland. During UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying Moldova achieved a 1–1 draw against Russia at Moscow during UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying. The equalising goal was Alexandru Epureanu&#x27;s last international goal, who went on to become the first Moldovan with 100 appearances for the national team. In the same competition, Moldova suffered a humiliating 0–1 defeat against the Liechtenstein on home ground, placing last in the group. In 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification the Moldovans placed last in the group again, only obtaining two draws with Georgia.

In the inaugural season of the UEFA Nations League, the Moldovans played in League D, the competition&#x27;s lowest division. They placed third in their group, above San Marino. Moldova&#x27;s victory over them was its first competitive win since 2014. In UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying Moldova suffered another disappointing result, a 0–1 loss to Andorra, finishing last in the group. 

===2020s===
Moldova was the best third-placed team of 2018–19 UEFA Nations League D and obtained promotion to 2020–21 UEFA Nations League C due to a revamp of the competition&#x27;s format. Moldova obtained only one point, a draw with the Kosovo, placing last in its group. Thus, Moldova had to play the relegation play-outs. Between the matches for the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League, Moldova suffered a 6–0 defeat to Italy in a friendly match, which equalled Moldova&#x27;s worst defeat at the time.

In 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification Moldova obtained only one point, a draw with the Faroe Islands. Moldova also suffered its worst defeat ever during these qualifiers, a 8–0 loss against Denmark. During these qualifiers Moldova placed 181st in October 2021 FIFA Ranking, the lowest position it ever reached. After losing to Kazakhstan on penalties in 2020–21 UEFA Nations League relegation play-outs, the Moldovans were relegated to 2022–23 UEFA Nations League D. Moldova was tied on points with Latvia, but because of a lower goal difference placed second, failing to achieve promotion.

The UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying was a watershed moment for Moldova. The Moldovans came agonisingly close to a historic Euro debut, acquiring ten points in a group of five; the Moldovans also gained an impressive feat by being undefeated at home throughout the qualification, including a historic shock 3–2 comeback win over Poland and were one win away from qualifying for UEFA Euro 2024. However, a denting away loss to the Czech Republic in the final matchday killed off Moldova&#x27;s qualification hopes, as they finished fourth and were eliminated due to an inferior record. Ion Nicolaescu scored his 11th and 12th international goals in the 3–2 win against Poland, becoming Moldova&#x27;s top goal scorer. With 4 goals in the competition, he became the first Moldovan to be the top goal scorer of a qualifying group.

<doc id="1011294" wikidata="Q40467" url="?curid=1011294" title=".il">
<text>.il is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) of Israel, administered by the Israel Internet Association and managed by NIC - ISRAEL which hosts the DNS root server and manages the Israeli Internet Exchange, that supports IPv4 and IPv6.

The .il top-level domain is one of the earliest registered ccTLDs. When Israel registered it, on 24 October 1985, it was the third registration of any ccTLD, after .us and .uk, which were registered earlier that year.

As of 19 August 2023 there are 285,060 domain names registered under the .il ccTLD in Israel.

==Top-level domains in Hebrew script==
On 19 May 2020, ICANN approved the use of the codice_1‎ domain, that was proposed in 2012. It was delegated on 11 February 2021, and since 22 November 2022 it is possible to register domain names in full Hebrew script.

Unlike the structure of .il, domain names registered under . may be either directly at second-level (for example: ) or at third-level under one of these second-level domains:

* codice_2: Academic institutions; equivalent to .ac.il.
* codice_3: Government and Governmental System; equivalent to .gov.il.
* codice_4: Israel Defense Forces; equivalent to .idf.il.
* codice_5: Municipal Government; equivalent to .muni.il.

There will not be a Hebrew-script equivalent to these second-level domains:

* codice_6
* codice_7
* codice_8
* codice_9

As a more private initiative the top-level domain (&quot;com&quot;) was registered by VeriSign in 2016. It has as of 2020 many thousand second-level domains, mostly in Hebrew script, some in Latin script.

==Second-level domains==

Domain names ending with .il will always be in the third level under one of these second-level domains:

* codice_10: Academic Institutions; administration delegated to the Inter-University Computation Center.
* codice_6: Commercial Entities; administration delegated to five private registrars.
* codice_7: Non-commercial Organizations; administration delegated to five private registrars.
* codice_9: Israeli Internet service providers; available only to licensed providers by the Israel Internet Association.
* codice_8: Schools and Kindergartens
* codice_15: Government and Governmental System; administration delegated to Ministry of Finance.
* codice_16: Municipal Government
* codice_17: Israel Defense Forces; administration delegated to the army&#x27;s Center of Computing and Information Systems.

Registration of other second-level domain names directly under .il is not supported.

Hebrew third level domains such as codice_18 are available since 2010.

<text>Don&#x27;t Give Up on Me is a studio album by American R&amp;B/Soul singer Solomon Burke, recorded and released in 2002 on Fat Possum Records. The album won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album. It is noteworthy for the contributions of original and previously unreleased compositions by top-rank songwriters, the effect of which placed Burke back in the public eye for a time. Guest stars are Daniel Lanois, who plays electric guitar on &quot;Stepchild&quot;, and The Blind Boys of Alabama, who feature on backing vocals for &quot;None of Us Are Free&quot;. &quot;None of Us Are Free&quot; was also featured at the end of the sixth episode (&quot;Spin&quot;) of the second season of &quot;House&quot;. &quot;Fast Train&quot; was featured during the ending montage of the season three finale of &quot;The Wire&quot;.

The title track, written by the team of Dan Penn and Carson Whitsett with Hoy Lindsey, gained popularity (and introduced Burke to a new generation) when it was used several times on the popular primetime teen soap opera &quot;The O.C.&quot; as one of the signature song of adult couple Sandy and Kirsten Cohen, played by Peter Gallagher and Kelly Rowan. It became a staple of Burke&#x27;s live performances and has been covered by Joe Cocker, as well as Peter Gallagher, who also performed the song on &quot;The O.C.&quot;

<doc id="1011302" wikidata="Q336215" url="?curid=1011302" title="Passing (juggling)">
<text>Passing is the act of juggling between two or more people. It is most commonly seen as a subset of toss juggling.

==Passing==
Passing can be performed with three or more juggling props but is most commonly performed with six objects such as balls, rings or clubs. &quot;This is the basic part of team juggling and it requires two pretty smooth jugglers.&quot; Jugglers can perform passing one person standing behind the other, back to back, or side by side but the most usual stance is where the jugglers face each other.

==Props==

Clubs are the prop of choice for passing because of the larger surface area available for catching (most often the handle), the variety of possible tricks that can be performed and the higher visibility of the props for an audience. Rings are sometimes chosen for numbers passing because of their light weight and reduced chance of collisions in the air during a passing pattern. Balls are not commonly used for passing with the exception of beginners and for bounce juggling passing.

== Technique ==
Passing technique varies depending on the prop being used and the position of the jugglers. The standard passing pattern, where the jugglers face each other and are each juggling three props requires a high degree of competence in the solo juggling of that prop. This standard pattern can be described as the props travelling in a rectangle or box shape. Throws across the short end of the box are self throws by each juggler and throws to the other person are parallel throws to the other person. Throws from one juggler to the other are by convention usually thrown from the right hand and caught by the other juggler with the left hand. The tempo of the throws to the other juggler are usually a two count: that is a juggler will throw one prop to themselves from their right hand and then the next prop in the right hand to the other juggler. This is sometimes called every others. The throwing and catching technique for each type of prop is specific to that type of prop.

Beginners usually start with ball passing but often move on to ring and then club passing. Club passing is the most popular because the props allow for a greater latitude in where they are caught, the range of tricks available are much greater than other props and the patterns available are more visual.

==Passing patterns==

A passing pattern is a sequence of throws and catches using a certain number of props which is repeated continuously. An example would be the standard 6 club passing pattern between two jugglers with the throws on a two count tempo. Passing patterns, however, vary in complexity from the simple: where only two jugglers pass three objects (usually three clubs which is called &#x27;running three&#x27;), to many jugglers passing numerous clubs in complex patterns. Patterns differ from tricks which are instead a throw or catch which is different to the throws and catches within a pattern. An example would be where a single prop is thrown high to the other juggler at the correct time so that it the other juggler can catch it in the space available and the jugglers then return to the pattern they were juggling.

===6 clubs===
A basic variation in the pattern depends on how often the &quot;self throw&quot; is replaced with a pass. For practice, Besmehn recommends what may be called &#x27;six-count&#x27;: &quot;Use four balls of one color and two of another color...every time an odd-colored ball reaches your right hand, pass it.&quot; Klutz recommends the same pattern: &quot;It helps ... if one of you counts out loud every time a toss leaves your right hand[s] ... On a pre-arranged number, say three [six beats], instead of tossing across to your &quot;own&quot; left hand, throw your bag ... over to your friend&#x27;s &quot;left&quot; hand.&quot; Siteswap: &lt;333333p|333333p&gt;
;Four-count, or &quot;Every others&quot;: One of the most basic forms of passing is called four-count. In four-count, every fourth throw—that is, every second right-handed throw—is a passing throw. Siteswap: &lt;3333p|3333p&gt;
;Three-count, or &quot;Waltz&quot;: In three-count, every third throw is a pass. &quot;When you can pass every third ball consistently, try passing every other ball.&quot; This means that the passing throw alternates from the left hand to the right hand, with the same club being passed each time. Siteswap: &lt;333p|333p&gt;
;Two-count, &quot;Solids&quot;, or &quot;Everies&quot;: Every right-handed throw is a pass. This is a fast-paced pattern which can be maintained for a long period of time with practice. &quot;The pattern goes pass, self throw, pass, self throw, pass, and so on.&quot; &quot;Instead of just tossing across to your partner on every third [right hand] throw, toss every right hand bag across.&quot; Siteswap: &lt;33p|33p&gt;
;One-count, or &quot;ultimates&quot;, also referred to as a &quot;thunder shower&quot;:Every throw is a pass. Effectively, two separate juggling patterns are formed: One between the left hand of the first juggler, and the right hand of the second, and vice versa. This is a very quick pattern which is rarely maintained for long periods. It requires equal skill with both hands. Siteswap: &lt;3p|3p&gt;
Other popular patterns are;
;Pass Pass Self: Literally where both people perform &quot;Pass, Pass, Self&quot;. Siteswap: &lt;3p3p3|3p3p3&gt;
;Book Ends:Where both people perform &quot;Pass, Self, Pass, Self, Pass&quot;. The hand you are passing with should change hands after three passes with no selves in between. Siteswap: &lt;3p33p33p|3p33p33p&gt;
;Jim&#x27;s: Jim&#x27;s patterns are a variant of passing where one juggler passes crosses (diagonally) whilst the other passes straights. This leads to interesting complexities such as hurries (where one hand will throw receive a pass and throw again whilst the other holds a club). Jim&#x27;s can be applied to most if not all patterns, although the six club Pass Pass Self pattern leaves the person throwing straights never passing with the left hand.
;Chocolate Bar: The Chocolate bar is a variant on the one-count passing pattern where you alternate between self-throws and passes. The pattern is two passes followed by two self-throws. It allows passers to get practice passing ultimates while at the same time getting the occasional break.

===7 clubs===
;7 Singles:Similar to the 6 club two-count but with a change in rhythm and speed to accommodate the extra object. The second person (starting with three clubs) makes their first passing throw when their partners’ first club is halfway between the two jugglers. 7 club passing is therefore an offset or asynchronous passing pattern, unlike 6 club passing which is a synchronous passing pattern (both jugglers passing at the same time).
;7 Doubles:Same rhythm as 7 singles but passes are made as doubles which reduces the speed of the juggling.
;7 four-count: Similar to 6 club four-count but each pass is made as a triple and the passes are asynchronous.
;Popcorn: Each person performs the same routine but the first person starts halfway through the second persons routine. Each perform &quot;Right hand crossing self triple, left hand single, Right hand double parallel pass, left hand single, right hand single&quot;. The first person (with four clubs) throws their tramline double pass and waits till the return one is halfway across before they throw their first double. The second person waits till the first persons double is halfway across before making their triple.

==Tricks==
There are many tricks that can be performed over the pattern, including varying the throwing method (under the leg, behind the back, spinning the wrong way, not spinning at all) and the throwing height (which requires the other person to fill in while waiting to catch it). Club pass juggling may include tosses without a flip, &quot;floaters&quot;, or tosses with a double or triple flip, &quot;spinners&quot;. It is also possible to pass with more than two people, and with more than three clubs each.

==Starting==
Two conventions are commonly used:
;Slow start:Both jugglers begin with self-throws, as if they had just received an incoming pass. Thus for four-count, each juggler will make four self-throws and pass on the fifth.
;Fast start:Both jugglers begin with a pass.

Slow start is generally preferred by beginners, but fast start is more popular amongst confirmed passers.
;Asynchronous start:One jugglers throws a pass, the other juggler waits or throws self throws first.

This happens when 1 juggler has more objects at the start, for example when 2 jugglers pass 7 objects.

==Rhythms==
There are three main types of rhythm. The first is the usual where each hand throws with equal time between each other. The second is sometimes referred to as a galloped rhythm, when the left hand only throws after a little after the right hand has thrown. The third is synchronous, when both hands throw at the same time.

==Collisions==
A collision is when two or more clubs hit each other in the air. Usually they are unrecoverable. There are ways of avoiding collisions. For example, in 6 club Ultimates, both throwing &quot;from in to out&quot; can prevent the clubs from colliding. Other ways are to make one person throw wider than they would normally do.

==Records==

As for solo juggling, world records for passing are kept. The rules generally require that two-count passing be used, and that the number of successful catches be four times the number of props, in order for a passing attempt to be successful. Current world records are as follows:
* 14 clubs for 16 passes caught by Dominik Harant and Manuel Mitasch in 2015. ()
* 13 clubs for 30 passes caught by Manuel Mitasch and Dominik Harant in 2013. ()
* 12 clubs for 77 passes caught by Daniel Ledel and Dominik Harant in 2012. 
* 11 clubs for 237 passes caught by Manuel Mitasch and Christoph Mitasch in 2010.()
* 10 clubs for 682 passes caught by Daniel Ledel and Dominik Harant in 2011.
* 9 clubs for 1392 passes caught by Manuel Mitasch and Christoph Mitasch in 2007.()

Three-person club passing records with publicly available video evidence:
*18 clubs for 18 passes caught by Manuel Mitasch, Daniel Ledel, and Dominik Harant in 2013 ()
*17 clubs for 106 passes caught by Manuel Mitasch, Daniel Ledel, and Dominik Harant in 2016 ()
*16 clubs for 151 passes caught by Manuel Mitasch, Daniel Ledel, and Dominik Harant in 2016 ()
*15 clubs for 180 passes caught by Manuel Mitasch, Daniel Ledel, and Dominik Harant in 2016 ()

<doc id="1011307" wikidata="Q3139221" url="?curid=1011307" title="V. S. Achuthanandan">
<text>Velikkakathu Sankaran Achuthanandan (born 20 October 1923), popularly known by his initials V. S., is an Indian politician who was the Chief Minister of Kerala from 2006 to 2011. At 82, he was the oldest person to have assumed the office. He is affiliated to the Communist Party of India (Marxist). He served as the chairman of Administrative reforms in Kerala with state cabinet rank from 2016 to 2021. He has served as Leader of the Opposition for 15 years which makes him the longest serving Leader of the Opposition in Kerala Legislative Assembly. 

Achuthanandan was a member of the CPI(M) Politburo from 1985 until July 2009, when he was reverted to the Central Committee of the party owing to his ideological dispositions.

Achuthanandan initiated various actions as the Chief Minister, including the demolition drive in Munnar which claimed back acres of illegally occupied land, the demolition drive in Kochi M. G. Road which claimed back the long lost &quot;shoulder&quot; of the road, anti-piracy drive against film-piracy, his struggle against the Lottery mafia in the state. He was instrumental in convicting former minister R. Balakrishna Pillai on charges of corruption. Achuthanandan also took the lead in promoting free software in the state, and especially in adopting free software in the public education system of the state.
== Early life ==
Born on 20 October 1923 to Sankaran and Accamma in Punnapra, Alappuzha, Travancore (part of present-day Kerala state, India), he lost his mother when he was four years old and subsequently lost his father at the age of 11. This forced him to quit his studies after finishing 7th standard in school. He started working by helping his elder brother in a village tailoring shop. Later he took up the job of meshing coir to make ropes at a coir factory.

Achuthanandan was in the forefront of the land struggles in Kerala starting with the Alappuzha declaration in 1970 demanding implementation of the Land Reforms Act passed by the EMS Government in 1967. Later his activities as the leader of the Opposition in the Kerala Assembly had evoked good public response.

== Political life ==
He entered politics through trade union activities and joined State Congress in 1938. In 1940, he became a member of the Communist Party of India (CPI). During his 40 years as a politician he was imprisoned for five years and six months and was in hiding for four and half years. He was a state secretariat member of the CPI in 1957. He is the only living among the 32 members who left the CPI National Council in 1964 to form the Communist Party of India (Marxist). He was the Secretary of the Kerala State Committee between 1980 and 1992. He was a member of the CPI(M) Polit Bureau since 1985 until he was removed as a party disciplinary action. He is the senior most leader of CPI(M) in India.


== Chief Minister of Kerala (2006-2011) ==
During the assembly elections held in Kerala in April–May 2006, VS Achuthanandan defeated Satheesan Pacheeni of the United Democratic Front by a margin of 20,017 votes in Malampuzha constituency in Palakkad district. He was sworn in as Chief Minister of Kerala on 18 May 2006, with his 21-member cabinet. Aged 82 years and 7 months at time, he was the oldest Chief Minister of Kerala, and one of the oldest in the whole of India. It is noticeable that he had been denied a party ticket to contest elections just two months before he was sworn in. He became the 11th Chief Minister of Kerala. On 12 July 2009, the CPI(M) Polit bureau and Central Committee removed him from the PB for his stands taken in relation to the accusation and legal procedures against Pinarayi Vijayan in his reported involvement in the Lavlin bribery.

=== 2011 Assembly election ===

The 2011 Kerala Legislative Assembly election, proved to be one of the closest in Kerala&#x27;s history, with the UDF beating the LDF by a margin of 4 seats. After this election, Achuthanandan was considered the man behind the Uprising of LDF after the 2009 Parliament and 2010 Municipal election losses. The CPI(M) denied a seat to Achuthanandan for the 2011 assembly election. Protests took place across the state and even on social networking sites such as Twitter, Facebook and via SMS.
In what can be considered as a near repeat of the 2006 pre-election build-up, the Politbureau of CPI-M impressed upon the state leadership to permit VS Achuthanandan to contest elections for the April 2011 Assembly election in Kerala. VS Achuthanandan contested from the Malampuzha Constituency and won with a margin of around 25,000 votes.

===Removal of personal staff===

On 12 May 2013, three of his personal staff V.K. Sasidharan (additional private secretary), A. Suresh (personal assistant) and K. Balakrishnan (press secretary) were ousted by the Politburo, which was entrusted by the CPI(M) central committee to decide on the action to be taken against them. They were expelled on charges of leaking information to media, according to CPI(M). With the decision, Achuthanandan&#x27;s arch-rival and Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI(M)) state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan appears to have won. The state committee of the party where Vijayan has a huge majority also wanted Achuthanandan to be removed from the post of leader of opposition but this was not done. &quot;This is a clipping of the wings of Achuthanandan&quot;, said K.M. Shahjahan.

=== 2016 Assembly elections ===

Achuthanandan was appointed Chairman of the Administrative Reforms Commission on 3 August 2016.

=== Statement on Islamization of Kerala ===
In 2010, the 86-year-old CPI (M) veteran, while talking to reporters in New Delhi on Saturday, said the Popular Front, under scanner for chopping off the hand of a college lecturer, was indulging in communal and divisive activities with the aim of turning Kerala into a Muslim majority state.

== Major achievements ==
In 2006, under the leadership of Achuthanandan government decided to develop and operate an International Container Transshipment Terminal (ICTT), Vallarpadam. Though it is a central government project, Achuthanandan government has taken strong steps to take over land required for road and rail lines for the project. The International Container Transshipment Terminal, Kochi was inaugurated on 11 February 2011, it is the first transshipment terminal in India and the first container terminal to operate in a SEZ.
The Technopark in Kollam was initiated, planned and constructed during Achuthanandan government. The plan for setting up the first district IT park in Kerala at Kollam was announced in January 2009. The Foundation stone was laid by Achuthanandan in February 2009. The park was set up expecting employment to the tune of 20,000 and investments of 800 crores. 
The first phase of park was inaugurated by Achuthanandan on 15 February 2011.


In 2009, Achuthanandan ministry started the work of Infopark Cherthala in Alappuzha. The project was inaugurated by 
Achuthanandan on 10 January 2011. With the state&#x27;s IT sector witnessing a phenomenal growth, it has become necessary to expand Infopark, Kochi, to the satellite towns of the city. Infrastructure development at the IT parks at Infopark Cherthala, Infopark Ambalappuzha and InfoPark Thrissur, which are the satellite units of Infopark, Kochi, were progressing fast. Achuthanandan laid the foundation stone of the second phase of Infopark at Kakkanad. The project is developed on 160 acres.
In 2008, Achuthanandan government proposed an International airport in Mattannur, Kannur. Two years later, Achuthanandan laid the foundation stone for the Kannur International Airport at the project site marking the formal commencement of construction activities on 17 December 2010 at a function attended by the then Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel.

In 2008, Achuthanandan government approved the Kochi Metro rail project in a cabinet meeting held on 2 January 2008 and sent to Central Government for ratification.

=== The drive to reclaim paddy land ===
The anti-reclamation stir launched by the Kerala State Karshaka Thozhilali Union (KSKTU) at Mankompu in 1996–97, under the leadership of Achuthanandan created much controversy. This stir was claimed to be highlighting the serious problem of the massive conversion of paddy fields into another type of land, affecting the food security of Kerala. But this soon developed into a crop destruction drive. The protest got the sobriquet following the violent methods and crop destruction resorted to by the KSKTU cadre. The stir attracted lot of public attention and Achuthanandan was forced to express his disapproval of any destruction of crops. 15 years later, in November 2011, a UDF Minister, who is politically opposed to Achuthanandan, justified this struggle. Janata Dal Socialist leader and minister for Agriculture, K.P. Mohananan said such a struggle was necessary as conversion of paddy fields to another type of crops is a serious concern.

==Personal life==
On 20 October 2023, Achuthanandan turned 100.

<doc id="1011310" wikidata="Q14478653" url="?curid=1011310" title="V. R. Parton">
<text>Vernon Rylands Parton (2 October 1897 – 31 December 1974) was an English chess enthusiast and prolific chess variant inventor, his most renowned variants being Alice chess and Racing Kings. Many of Parton&#x27;s variants were inspired by the fictional characters and stories in the works of Lewis Carroll. Parton&#x27;s formal education background, like Lewis Carroll&#x27;s, was in mathematics. Parton&#x27;s interests were wide and he was a great believer in Esperanto.

Parton&#x27;s early education stemmed from his father&#x27;s schools, where he also assisted. Parton&#x27;s father was principal of Cannock Grammar School and a small international boarding school for children. After completing mathematics at Chester Teaching College, Parton returned to his father&#x27;s school to give private instruction to older children in Latin, French, German, English, shorthand, typing, bookkeeping, and mathematics. In the 1920s he was left in charge of the school while his father returned to teach in state schools. Ill health cut short Parton&#x27;s teaching career.

In 1960 Parton moved from Cannock to Liverpool, into a terraced house near Penny Lane, and published a series of nine monographs from 1961 to 1974 (also 1975 posthumously) detailing his inventions. He died from emphysema at age 77 in Liverpool on 31 December 1974. The same year, variant inventor Philip M. Cohen created the variant &quot;Parton Chess&quot; in his honour.

==Some chess variant inventions==
===Cubic chess===

In this 6×6×6 3D variant by Parton, boards are denoted A (bottom level) through F (top level). Each side has six pieces: king (K), queen (Q), bishop (B), unicorn (U), knight (N), and rook (R); and twelve pawns.

====Game rules====
Pieces move the same as in Raumschach, except that pawns move capture one step forward (either orthogonally, diagonally, or vertexally), but not directly upward or downward. As in chess and Raumschach, the objective is checkmate.
*White&#x27;s starting setup: KAa1, QAb1, BAc1, UAd1, NAe1, RAf1; pawns on Aa2–f2 and Ba1–f1
*Black&#x27;s starting setup: KAf6, QAe6, BAd6, UAc6, NAb6, RAa6; pawns on Aa5–f5 and Ba6–f6

====Variation====
Parton made a variation of cubic chess for the same gameboard: In compulsion cubic chess, capture is compulsory, there are no checks, and the object is of the opposing king.
===Alice chess===

Parton&#x27;s most famous chess variant, played on two adjacent chessboards. A piece that completes its move on one board automatically &quot;vanishes strangely off its board to appear suddenly on the other board, magically out of thin air!&quot; A move in Alice chess has two basic stipulations: the move must be legal on the board on which it is played, and the square transferred to on the opposite board must be vacant. (Consequently, capture is possible only on the board upon which a piece currently stands.)

From D. B. Pritchard&#x27;s &quot;Popular Chess Variants&quot; (2000): This wonderful game, appropriately named after Lewis Carroll&#x27;s eponymous heroine, was the inspiration of Vernon Parton. If you pass over every other game in this book, don&#x27;t miss this one. Still, alas, little known, Alice chess, now almost a half-century old, continues to attract converts. The body of Alice players grows steadily. 
===Mad Threeparty chess===
This variant is for three players on a 10×10 board. Each player has a standard set of pieces in their own colour, including an extra but no pawns.
====Game rules====
The board starts empty. Players take turns, in clockwise rotation around the board, placing one of their pieces on any vacant square. Kings are placed last, but must not be placed in check.

The two kings of each player are marked differently. (For example, of a player&#x27;s two kings, one might be marked with a .) Each player attacks the king of the opponent to their left, and the king of the opponent to their right. It is not permitted to check the opponents&#x27; other kings.

The first player to checkmate a king wins the game.
===Tweedle chess===

Also known as twin orthodox chess or double-king chess, each player has two kings and two queens on a 10×10 board. A player wins by checkmating either one of the opposing kings.

====Game rules====
The normal chess rules apply, except that kings and rooks can only castle &quot;short&quot; (i.e. with kings shifting two squares toward the nearest corner), and pawns can move one or two steps at any stage.

====Comments====
&quot;While his pair of Queens will provide the player&#x27;s main hopes for victory, his twin monarchs King Tweedledee and King Tweedledum jointly provide his sequence of headaches!&quot; Parton makes note that the only way a player can escape mate from a fork on his two kings is by capturing the checking piece.

Boyer remarked that the variant yields &quot;magnificent games&quot; because there are two directions of attack and two points to defend.
===March Hare chess===

In this variant, a player first moves one of their own pieces, &quot;and then &#x27;meddles&#x27; with his opponent&#x27;s men&quot;. 
====Game rules====
For each turn, a player makes : he first moves one of his own pieces, then one of his opponent&#x27;s.
When in check, a player must get out of check immediately on his turn by moving one of his own men. (If he cannot legally do so, he loses the game.)
===Cheshire Cat chess===

====Game rules====
In this variant, all normal chess rules apply, except: Whenever a piece moves from its square, then that particular square &quot;disappears&quot;.

Parton suggests using checker pieces to mark &quot;disappeared&quot; squares. Once vanished, a square may not be occupied again; however, pieces may move disappeared square(s), including giving check through them.

Since castling is impossible in Cheshire Cat Chess (pieces which normally clear a path for castling cause needed squares to &quot;disappear&quot;), Parton permits the kings to be moved like queens once per game, on their first move.

====Variation====
The game can also be played using a regular 8×8 board and set, but Parton suggests the 10×10 board with two extra rooks in the corners as &quot;best&quot;.
===Co-regal chess===
In this variant, the queens are subject to check and checkmate the same as kings.
====Game rules====
Checkmate of the opponent&#x27;s king or queen wins the game. The queen moves and captures as a normal queen, but may not put itself in check. The queen may pass over attacked squares.

Amplified rules by NOST

A queen, the result of a pawn promotion, is royal. A queen may check a king from a distance, but may not check a queen. Both kings and queens may castle .

====Comments==== 
&quot;It will be seen that difficulties for a &#x27;checkmate&#x27; of the hostile Queen must chiefly arise from her great mobility which enables her to escape to safety with some degree of ease, in contrast with the King&#x27;s poor slow power to move out of grave dangers. Victory in Co-regal will be in general achieved by checkmate of the enemy King. [...] A player must acquire two new habits at least. He must crush all his desires to make some brilliant Queen sacrifice. When he attacks the hostile co-regal Queen, he is obliged to give the polite word &#x27;check&#x27; as warning!&quot; 

====Sample game====
Walter Whiteman vs. Rib Orrell: 1.e4 Nf6 2.Nc3 e5 3.Nf3 Bc5 4.Bc4 Ng4 5.0-0 Nxf2+ 6.Rxf2 Bxf2+ 7.Kxf2 0-0 8.d3 d6 9.Ng5 Be6 10.Bxe6 fxe6+ 11.Ke1 h6 12.Nxe6+ Qh4+ 13.g3+ Qxh2 &quot;Black threatens 14...Qg/h1 mate since a K move is illegal as it exposes the Q to check. If 14.Qg4 (only legal move for Q) Rf2 15.Ne2 (forced: Qxg7 is not mate—it&#x27;s illegal!) Rxe2+ and mate in three.&quot; 
===Racing Kings===

This game was the original &quot;Dodo chess&quot; before being renamed. The rules are the same as Dodo chess, but there is a different board setup.

====Sample game====
R. Betza vs. J. Leitel: 1.Bd4 Be4 2.Kh3 Ka3 3.Nxc1 Rxc1 4.Be2 Nb3 5.Bh8? Ka4 6.Kg4 Ka5 7.Qh6 Rc6 8.Qe3 Rxe2 9.Qxe4 Qxh8? 10.Qxc6 Qc3 11.Qh6 Rxe1 12.Rxe1 Qxe1 13.Kf5 Qe7 14.Qe6 Qb7 15.Kg6 Nc5 16.Qf7 Ka6 17.Kh7 Ka7 18.Rg8 (18.Kg8 only draws) 

Parton suggests also that play can be extended to a &quot;double course&quot;, where a player wins by being first to go to the eighth rank and then return to the first. 
===Dodo chess===

Played on a regular chessboard, this variant is a simple race game: the first player to reach a square on the last with his king is the winner.

====Game rules====
Checking is not permitted, neither is exposing one&#x27;s own king to check. Captures are allowed, however, as in normal chess.

&quot;By way of compensating for the first move (always an advantage in a race game) if White gets there first but Black follows on the next move the game is a draw.&quot; 
===Kinglet chess===
Also known as imperial fiddlesticks, there is no checking or checkmate in kinglet chess – kings are treated like any normal piece. The winner is the first player to capture all the opponent&#x27;s &quot;kinglets&quot; (i.e. pawns or Fiddlesticks).
====Additional rules====
When reaching the last rank, a kinglet promotes to a king. If a player is forced to promote his last kinglet, he is then without any kinglets so automatically loses. All pieces including kings are subject to capture. Stalemate is a draw.

====Comments====
&quot;The idea contains some interesting problems in tactics. The balance between rushing to capture Fiddlesticks [pawns] quickly and fear of becoming defenceless thereby, (loss of major pieces) seems to be subtle and delicate.&quot; 
====Variations====
Parton suggests two &quot;less subtle&quot; variations in &quot;Curiouser and Curiouser&quot;, one based on Progressive chess where players make an increasing number of moves per turn, and the other based on Marseillais chess where players move two pieces per turn, at least one of which must be a kinglet (or, the same kinglet may be moved twice).
===Looking-glass chess===
Two separate games ensue in this Parton creation. A player may make any normal move on either board, and then must make the &#x27;looking-glass&#x27; (reflected) move on the other board to complete his turn.

====Game rules====
To illustrate, if White opens with 1.Nf3 on board A, then he must play on board B to complete his turn (see diagram). If a reflected move would put the player in check, then the first move may not be made.

The move of a king or queen must be mirrored on the other board, even if this means moving the king several squares. (For example, in the diagram if White captures 2.Nxe5/A Nxd5/B and Black recaptures 2...Qxd5/B, then Black&#x27;s reflected move is: 2...Kxe5/A.)

Castling is normal, but then the reflected move must be executed to &#x27;castle&#x27; the queen. (E.g. if White castles kingside, then reflected queenside castling results in the queen on b1 and the rook on c1.) 
===Gryphon chess===

Also known as complicacious chess, at the end of a move, the moved piece transforms to a piece of a different type (the next in the series: ). So after moving a pawn, the pawn transforms to a knight of the same colour. After moving a knight, it becomes a bishop; and so on. Kings do not transform.
====Game rules====
A player may have no more than four knights, four bishops, four rooks, or two queens on the board at any one time, but may have as many as fifteen kings. Checkmating any one of the enemy kings wins the game.

====Comments====
&quot;It will be seen at once that a complicacious pawn reaches the status of kingship in five moves, whereas a complicacious Rook does so in two moves. [...] Naturally, a player will not capture the enemy Queen! Neither will he desire to move his own Queen, to provide the necessary target for his opponent to win by.&quot; 
====Variations====



In &quot;circular&quot; Gryphon chess, players have one king for the entire game as in normal chess. But the transformation sequence is changed and made circular: . (So, a piece can transform any number of times without limitation.) Again, no more than four knights, four bishops, four rooks, or two queens are permitted in play at any one time.

In &quot;simplified&quot; Gryphon chess, players start with their king and eight pawns. &quot;The pawns change through the regular Gryphon order and terminate in kingship. Until a player has captured an enemy piece, he is forbidden to move his king sideways or backwards.&quot; 
===Mock chess===

To win the game, a player must capture all his opponent&#x27;s pieces, including the king. &quot;A proper pseudomorph to Chess, for it has no elements of check and mate whatever in its basis. Kings are now merely treated like any other chessman.&quot; 

====Game rules====
If a player can capture, he must do so. If more than one capture are possible on his turn, he may choose which one to make. Only one capture per turn may be made.

On its first move, a pawn must advance squares—unless the pawn&#x27;s first move is a capture.
===Contramatic chess===
The normal rules for check and checkmate are contradicted—a player may check the enemy king, but may move his own king check. A player wins when his opponent cannot escape check.
====Game rules====
Players start with kings positioned as shown. White places his remaining pieces anywhere he likes on his side of the board, then Black does the same. White moves first.

Checking the opponent is not allowed. (If a player has no move other than to give check, then he loses.) A player may make a move putting his own king in check from enemy piece(s)—unless the move would also give check to the opponent. When a player is in check, his opponent must remove the check on his next turn or lose the game.

====Observations====
Kings tend to move more than any other piece. Kings cannot occupy adjacent squares, since it would result in giving check to the opponent (in violation of the rules). Captures are rare, since capturing the opponent&#x27;s men reduces the chance of putting one&#x27;s own king in check.
====Variation==== 
In Complete Contramatic chess (also known as C.C.C.) each player has kings – a normal (orthodox) king in addition to the regular &quot;contramatic&quot; king. There are two ways to win: putting one&#x27;s own contramatic king into inescapable check, or checkmating the enemy orthodox king. Players place the orthodox kings last, after other pieces are placed.

====Observations====
A contramatic king can move to a square adjacent to the enemy orthodox king (since the orthodox king may be checked as in normal chess, and the contramatic king may put itself into check). But an orthodox king may move adjacent to the enemy contramatic king (since it is not allowed to check an opponent&#x27;s contramatic king, or to put one&#x27;s own orthodox king into check).
===Idle Kings&#x27; chess===

====Game rules====
Players play without kings until after Black&#x27;s 12th move, when White places his king on any open square (but not in check), and Black does the same.

====Additional rule====
After kings are placed the game continues normally, except that kings may not move, unless in check.
===Unirexal chess===

Also known as The Black King&#x27;s Complaint, Unirexal variants are those with only one king on the board. &quot;The black king disappeared, explains Parton, because he was fed up with always being mated in problems.&quot; 

====Game rules====
Black has a second queen instead of a king, and must checkmate White in a reasonable number of moves (agreed to before the game), otherwise White wins. 
====Variation====

Black has 20 knights, but no king. If Black does not checkmate White within 50 moves, he loses. 
===Decimal Rettah chess===

This is Parton&#x27;s first chess variant invention. The idea sprang from a dislike for weak kings: &quot;The king ought to be strong, not feeble, by aesthetic standards: he is the centre around which turns the whole game itself. In consequence, my Rettah monarch is the most powerful of all pieces.&quot; 

Each player has two rettahs (kings) and two queens on a 10×10 board. There is no checkmate; a player wins by capturing both opponent&#x27;s rettahs.

====Game rules====
A rettah [ spelled backwards] moves and captures as a Q+N compound. If a rettah is attacked, the attacking piece must be captured immediately. (If more than one piece is able to capture, the player may choose. An attacked rettah will always have the option to capture.) If a rettah is attacked by two pieces simultaneously, the attacked rettah must capture one of them (the player may choose which).

Pawns can move up to three steps on their first move. There is no &quot;en passant&quot;. If players agree, pawns can also move one step diagonally forward (to facilitate opening lines). A pawn promotes to rettah, but only if a rettah of the same colour was previously captured. There is no castling in Decimal Rettah.
====Variations====
Parton gives several variations, although Decimal Rettah is &quot;possibly the earlier version and arguably the better&quot; . In Absolute Rettah chess, only a rettah may capture a rettah. (So a successful tactic involves attacking a rettah with a piece guarded by one&#x27;s own rettah.) In Giveaway Rettah, Decimal or Absolute Rettah are played according to Suicide chess rules. In Rettah chess (one rettah; pawns move only one step forward) and Double Rettah chess (two rettahs; no forced capture; win by checkmating a rettah), play is on a regular 8×8 board.

====Sample game====
Decimal Rettah, &quot;a game of assault and sacrifice&quot;, received high praise from Boyer who published the following sample game [the game uses an alternate initial setup NBKQRRQKBN and incorrect interpretation of the capture rule, requiring that only a rettah may capture its attacker]:


===Identific===
In this variant, the identity of chess pieces becomes known as play proceeds. 
====Game rules====
Players first place their 12 counters (draughtsmen) on any squares of their choosing on their own half of the board. (Either White places all his counters first, followed by Black; or one per turn if the players prefer.)

After all counters have been placed, White moves any one of his counters as a regular chess piece of his choosing, then immediately replaces that counter with the corresponding chess piece. Black does similarly on his turn. These &quot;moves of identification&quot; obey the following rules: 
After each player has identified one chess piece, on subsequent turns players may choose to identify an additional piece from those still in-hand, or move one of their chess pieces already on the board. Chess pieces move, capture, give check/checkmate as normal, and may capture enemy counters.

A player&#x27;s fourth identified piece must be his king. (Or the players can agree on a different schedule, for example, the sixth identified piece.) Players might also want to prevent the early identification of queens, for example, by requiring at least five identifications, or by limiting identification of queen to a player&#x27;s last-remaining counter.
===Synchronistic chess===
&quot;A variant designed, part tongue-in-cheek, to achieve absolute equality.&quot; 
&quot;[...] to eliminate altogether that inequality between White and Black, by the simple idea that White and Black shall always play their corresponding moves simultaneously!&quot; 

====Game rules====
For each turn players decide their moves, write them down secretly, then disclose them. They adjust the position accordingly, using the following rules of resolution when needed:
In Synchronistic Chess, simultaneous checkmate is possible. 
===Damate===

Also known as Damate Game, the game is a synthesis between draughts and chess. 
====Game rules====
A king has no and is considered a normal ; a player wins by eliminating all the opponent&#x27;s men. The pieces move normally, except that pawns have no initial two-step option, and besides their normal one-step move straight forward, can move one step diagonally forward. A piece captures an enemy piece by it: 
As in draughts, jumping is always mandatory, multi-jumps are possible, and the multi-jump chosen must capture the maximum number of pieces possible. (If more than one jumping sequence captures the maximum, the player may choose.) The pieces captured in a multi-jump are not removed from the board until the end of the turn.

A pawn promotes to queen when it crosses the centre line of the board. A pawn jumping over the centre line both promotes and immediately ends the turn (i.e. no further jumps are allowed). 
===Dunce&#x27;s chess===
Also known as Advancing chess, the game has simple rules: Moves, captures, and checks are restricted to straight forward or diagonally forward directions. (Sideways or backwards is not permitted.) Pawns do not promote. The game is won by checkmating or stalemating the opponent.

====Variations====


===Semi-queen chess===

Also known as half-queen&#x27;s chess, the game introduces two additional pawns and two new pieces per side, the &quot;ugly-named Biok and Roshop&quot;. 
====Game rules====
The Biok makes non-capturing moves like a bishop, and captures like a rook. The Roshop makes non-capturing moves like a rook, and captures like a bishop.

As a result, the Roshop &quot;has the great advantage of being able to change from one colour system of squares to the other when required&quot; .
====Variation====

Parton defines an extension having no additional pawns and a pair of Bioks and Roshops per player.
===Black and White chess===
Also known as Black and White Marseillais chess, this game follows a simple rule: each player makes two moves per turn, first with a standing on a white (light) square, then with a man standing on a black (dark) square. Some resolutions are provided:
Castling can be done on either the first or second move of a turn. A man can be moved in a turn if square colour requirements are met. (For example, with a white pawn on a2 and a black bishop on b4, White&#x27;s turn can consist of a3 followed by axb4.)

<text>Ian Cochrane (7 November 1941 – 7 September 2004) was a British novelist and creative writing teacher. His novels are known for dark humour and tragic endings.

==Biography==
Cochrane was born in Moylarg and grew up in rural Antrim in Northern Ireland. He said, &quot;We lived in a little house right out in the country, with seven of us sleeping in one bedroom. But I don&#x27;t think I realised we were living in poverty.&quot;

Later the family moved into one of the new council houses built after the Second World War, but Cochrane continued to attend the old two-roomed country school. This school had a female teacher at one end for the younger children and a male &quot;master&quot; at the other end for the older ones. The master in this case was the progressive R.L. Russell (author of &quot;The Child and His Pencil&quot;, 1935), who encouraged young Cochrane to write and gave him the confidence to escape to better things.

Cochrane moved to London in the late 1950s and after abandoning a variety of jobs was eventually able to live as a full-time writer. Stories began to appear in literary magazines and anthologies such as Faber&#x27;s &quot;Introduction 4&quot; (1971) and &quot;Penguin Modern Stories&quot; (1972). Cochrane&#x27;s first novel, &quot;A Streak of Madness&quot;, was published in 1973, and his second, &quot;Gone in the Head&quot; (1974), was a runner-up for the Guardian Fiction Prize.

Much of his early life is echoed in his novels, but when asked if they were autobiographical, he said: &quot;It&#x27;s not science fiction, it&#x27;s in the real world that I&#x27;m living in. It isn&#x27;t just autobiographical, but I draw from my own experience.&quot;

There was a naturalness about the writing, a conversational authenticity, which he felt was a gift, like being able to play an instrument. He said, &quot;When I&#x27;m working hard on something, I feel the typewriter can&#x27;t go fast enough, with all the feelings and the dialogue going through me.&quot;

Although he taught creative writing for a time and had been working on a book on the subject, he was doubtful whether ultimately it was something that could be learned. He said, &quot;The people who do well are the people who can say: &#x27;Yeah, I knew that.&#x27; I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s not a benefit, because they might be really good writers and not know that they&#x27;re good writers.&quot; Acquaintances say that his attitude was that if the talent existed, it could be encouraged, much as his own had been encouraged by his teacher in Antrim. Many attest to his untiring generosity with help and advice.

His 1972 marriage to Maggie Ogilvie ended amicably in 1979. Maggie Ogilvy remarried to Charles Manicom, and bore him a daughter, Charlotte. Cochrane remained a close friend of Maggie. Charles Manicom was happy to let Cochrane remain part of the family. Cochrane helped raise Charlotte. Cochrane and Charlotte were devoted to each other. That the arrangement worked so well is a tribute to the good nature and love of all concerned.

Cochrane had little time for organised religion, especially of the triumphalist proselytising sort. In later life he became interested in Buddhism, but he was fundamentally a humanist.

Cochrane would put himself out not only for friends but for anyone in need, sometimes at considerable risk to himself. On one occasion, in 1987, he was in an Oxford Street underground station late at night when he saw a group of eight to ten men beating up two others. He said, &quot;They were punching and kicking one in particular, really laying into him. There were a lot of other people around but everyone else was just letting it happen. They probably would have killed that bloke if I hadn&#x27;t stepped in.&quot; In this incident he received severe, lasting injuries that badly affected his ability to write and involved him in long, largely fruitless proceedings with the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board.

His resilience kept him going despite ill health and increasing blindness, and he continued to write novels even when publishing fashions made it increasingly difficult to publish anything quirky and original.

All Cochrane&#x27;s novels were well received by critics. A new edition of &quot;F for Ferg&quot; was published in 2018 by Turnpike Books and a publication launch at the Seamus Heaney HomePlace involved a discussion of Cochrane&#x27;s work with Maurice Leitch, Cochrane&#x27;s friend and fellow novelist, Jan Carson, a contemporary novelist, and the academic Eamonn Hughes. His later fiction was more difficult to publish, and by his death all his works were out of print.

Ian Cochrane&#x27;s voice was distinctive in modern British fiction. Many readers found his novels to be funny, bawdy, blasphemous, touching and sad. He is said to express the feelings of the marginalised: the young, the unemployed, and people nearly insane or unrespectable. His portrayal of their clashes with parents, priests, bosses and officials reveal all the absurdity, selfishness and hypocrisy of their supposed betters.

His books&#x27; titles have a jokey craziness, such as &quot;Jesus on a Stick&quot; (1975) or &quot;Ladybird in a Loony-bin&quot; (1977). &quot;F for Ferg&quot; (1980) is a typical Cochrane novel. It documents the antics of some lads who hang around factory gates looking for ways to have fun. They decide to involve the boss&#x27; son, the Fergus of the title, in a romantic hoax with someone else&#x27;s girlfriend. It starts in a comic vein but ends with horribly fatal consequences.

Another classic Cochrane novel is &quot;The Slipstream&quot;. This novel is about the escapades of a group of Portobello wasters who attempt to rob the poor-box in the local church while one of their number distracts the priest with elaborate fake confessions. This novel also ends with the characters reaping more than they planned.

Cochrane&#x27;s characters are often feckless, but treated with sympathy and humanity. Cochrane&#x27;s exceptional ear for dialogue grants his characters the gift of life.

<text>Royal Air Force Kai Tak or more commonly RAF Kai Tak is a former Royal Air Force station situated in Hong Kong, at Kai Tak Airport, Kowloon. It was established by the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1927 and used for seaplanes. The RAF flight operated a few land based aircraft as well as having spare aircraft for naval units.

It was also the location of HMS &quot;Nabcatcher&quot;, a Royal Navy Mobile Operational Naval Air Base, (MONAB) VIII, which was there between 1945 and 1947. At the start of April 1947, it was decommissioned and concurrently re-commissioned as HMS &quot;Flycatcher&quot;. At the end of December, HMS &quot;Flycatcher&quot; was officially decommissioned at Kai Tak, although the Royal Navy retained lodger rights.

The lodging facilities ceased to operate following the official decommissioning of RAF Kai Tak on 30 June 1978, at which point all RAF units and responsibilities were transferred to RAF Sek Kong.

== Royal Navy ==

=== Beginnings (1939–1941) ===

On 24 May 1939, the control of all Fleet Air Arm squadrons and flights was transferred to the Admiralty, while the Royal Air Force (RAF) granted lodger rights at Kai Tak. No. 715 Catapult Flight, which had been established at RAF Kai Tak in 1936, was by this point engaged in operations with Supermarine Walrus amphibious maritime patrol aircraft on Royal Navy cruisers, using Kai Tak as its shore base. 715 Naval Air Squadron represented the sole Royal Navy presence at the station at the onset of the Second World War in September 1939. On 21 January 1940, this squadron was integrated into 700 Naval Air Squadron, which assumed responsibility for all catapult aircraft operations.

On 8 December 1941, the Imperial Japanese Army began Battle of Hong Kong soon after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The colony resisted for two weeks before surrendering on 25 December 1941.

=== HMS &quot;Nabcatcher&quot; (1945–1947) ===

HMS &quot;Nabcatcher&quot; was a Royal Navy (RN), Mobile Operational Naval Air Base (MONAB) at Kai Tak airfield. HMS &quot;Nabcatcher&quot; was also known as MONAB VIIII and Royal Naval Air Station Kai Tak (or RNAS Kai Tak).

On 26 September, MONAB VIII was established at Kai Tak airfield as RNAS Kai Tak, HMS &quot;Nabcatcher&quot;. This unit was designed to operate in a manner akin to those in Australia, providing shore facilities for disembarked squadrons and ultimately overseeing a Fleet Requirements Unit (FRU). Concurrently, the Royal Air Force began its operations at this site. It was decided that the station would be used collaboratively, comprising two camp and maintenance areas. The airfield was partitioned, with the RAF occupying the eastern section, which contained pre-war airfield infrastructure, while the Royal Navy used the western, undeveloped area for the deployment of MONAB equipment. It was established that the RAF would retain sole authority over Air Traffic Control.

Personnel and equipment for Mobile Naval Air Base VIII had assembled in May 1945, at RNAS Middle Wallop (HMS &quot;Flycatcher&quot;) in Hampshire. This mobile air base was called a Fighter Support MONAB and its technical components were Mobile Maintenance (MM) No. 7, Mobile Servicing (MS) Nos. 13 and 14, with Mobile, Storage, and Reserve (MSR) No. 9, which provided support for Seafire, Corsair, and Firefly fighters.

MONAB VIII was commissioned as HMS &quot;Nabcatcher&quot; on 1 July 1945, with Captain V. N. Surtees, , RN, serving as the commanding officer. That month personnel boarded SS &quot;Majola&quot;, which departed for Sydney, Australia. The stores, equipment, and vehicles were loaded onto the , which departed on 7 July. The announcement of the Surrender of Japan was while at sea, leading to the celebration of V-J Day during the voyage. With the conclusion of the war, MONAB VIII was deemed unnecessary for operations in Australia. The MONAB was scheduled for transfer to Hong Kong, where it would be established at Kai Tak airport to assist in the reopening of the airfield and to offer shore-based support to the British Pacific Fleet units stationed in the region.

The advance contingent of MONAB VIII was transported aboard the escort carrier , which set sail from Australia for Hong Kong on 5 September. The SS &quot;Empire Chieftain&quot; reached Sydney two days prior, on 3 September and departed for Hong Kong on 15 September. Mobile, Storage, and Reserve (MSR) No. 9 embarked on the escort carrier for its journey to Hong Kong, which commenced on 28 September. 1701 Naval Air Squadron headquarters was established at HMS &quot;Nabcatcher&quot; on 1 November 1945 and 721 Naval Air Squadron, a Fleet Requirements Unit arrived on 11 January 1946 on the escort carrier .

In August 1946, there was a reduction in the naval presence at the station, 1701 Naval Air Squadron disbanding on 27 August, with its Sea Otter aircraft transferred to 721 Naval Air Squadron, the FRU. The same day MONAB VIII was no longer recognised as an independent command, being downgraded to the status of RN Air Section Kai Tak. The ships account for &quot;Nabcatcher&quot; was maintained at , the Royal Naval base in Hong Kong.

At the beginning of October, the aircraft carrier docked in Hong Kong, where it disembarked its squadrons, 806 Naval Air Squadron with Seafire F Mk XV fighters and 837 Naval Air Squadron flying Firefly FR.I fighter reconnaissance aircraft. The squadrons re-embarked at the beginning of November, with 837 Naval Air Squadron returning to the ship on 4 November followed by 806 Naval Air Squadron two days later.

On 8 November 1946, command of HMS &quot;Nabcatcher&quot; was transferred to Commander (A) W. H. N. Martin, RN, who also assumed the role of Fleet Aviation Officer (FAO) for the British Pacific Fleet. On 27 November, more Seafire F Mk XV fighter aircraft arrived at the station when 802 Naval Air Squadron disembarked from and they were joined by 806 Naval Air Squadron from HMS &quot;Glory&quot; on 19 December.

=== HMS &quot;Flycatcher&quot; (1947) ===

The two Seafire squadrons remained at RNAS Kai Tak until 12 February 1947, then rejoined their aircraft carriers. HMS &quot;Nabcatcher&quot; resumed its primary function of conducting FRU flights until 1 April, when a further administrative shift took place. &quot;Nabcatcher&quot; was decommissioned and the Air Section was re-commissioned as HMS &quot;Flycatcher&quot;, a name associated with the two MONAB formation stations in the United Kingdom, while accounts continued to be managed by HMS &quot;Tamar&quot;.

The RN Air Section at Kai Tak marked the conclusion of its operations with the arrival of its final disembarked squadron on 20 October 1947. On this date, Seafire F Mk XV fighters from 804 Naval Air Squadron flew ashore from the aircraft carrier , subsequently re-embarking on 4 November. A decision had been made to terminate the operations of the RN Air Section; the Fleet Requirements Unit was officially disbanded on 31 December and HMS &quot;Flycatcher&quot; was decommissioned on 31 December. Following these events, the facilities of the RN Air Section at Kai Tak were downgraded to a &#x27;care and maintenance&#x27;, with an 18-month notice period established for potential reopening but this was never pursued, although the rights to disembark Royal Navy squadrons at the airfield were preserved.

=== Lodger facilities (1948–1978) ===

The initial deployment of a Royal Navy squadron ashore following the transfer of the airfield to the Royal Air Force occurred during the Malayan Emergency. On 5 November 1949, 800 Naval Air Squadron, with Seafire FR Mk.47 fighters, disembarked from the Colossus class and re-embarked on 3 December. The squadron returned on 13 March 1950, remaining on land for a duration of one month before re-embarking on 10 April.

Sea Venom FAW.22 jet fighters of 891 Naval Air Squadron disembarked from the aircraft carrier on 17 May 1958. The squadron remained deployed until 3 June before returning to the carrier. This deployment marked the sole occasion when Royal Navy jet aircraft used the historic runway 12/30. A new runway, 13/31, was inaugurated in September 1958, extending into Kowloon Bay on reclaimed land. This new runway was on the south-eastern side of the airfield, distinct from the other two runways.

In December 1958, two squadrons from the &quot;Centaur&quot;-class light fleet carrier deployed detachments to Kai Tak. On 12, three Whirlwind HAS.7 anti-submarine helicopters from 820 Naval Air Squadron were deployed, followed by five Sea Venom FAW.21 jet fighter aircraft from 809 Naval Air Squadron on 19 December. Both groups rejoined HMS &quot;Albion&quot; on 5 January 1959. HMS &quot;Albion&quot; returned in July 1960, during which a detachment of four Sea Venom FAW.22 jets from 894 Naval Air Squadron was disembarked for a week-long stay. Later that same year, several Whirlwind HAS.7 anti-submarine helicopters from 848 Naval Air Squadron were landed from HMS &quot;Bulwark&quot; on 9 November and they re-embarked on 21 November.

On 23 October 1963, disembarked a contingent consisting of four Buccaneer S.1 aircraft from 801 Naval Air Squadron and four Sea Vixen FAW.1 aircraft from 893 Naval Air Squadron for a brief period, with both units re-embarking on 7 November. On 22 December, HMS &quot;Albion&quot; landed a detachment of three Whirlwind HAS.7 anti-submarine helicopters from 846 Naval Air Squadron, which departed on 12 January 1964. In March of the same year, the Fairey Gannet AEW.3 aircraft from ‘B’ flight of 849 Naval Air Squadron were disembarked from the lead ship of her class on the 28 and re-embarked on the 13 of the following month.

HMS &quot;Centaur&quot; returned to Hong Kong in September 1964, disembarking de Havilland Sea Vixen FAW.1 from 892 Naval Air Squadron on the 19, followed by, this time, the Fairey Gannet aircraft from ‘B’ flight of 849 Naval Air Squadron on the 25, both of which re-joined the carrier on 14 October.

849 Naval Air Squadron&#x27;s &#x27;D&#x27; flight returned to RAF Kai Tak on 23 February 1965, having flown its Fairey Gannet AEW.3 from RAF Seletar in Singapore in anticipation of the aircraft carrier &#x27;s arrival. The squadron embarked on the on 11 March. Three years later, on 23 March 1968, the same flight disembarked from HMS &quot;Eagle&quot; for a short period, rejoining the vessel on 6 April.

The final Royal Navy helicopter squadron to operate from RAF Kai Tak was the Westland Wessex HU.5 troop transporter equipped 847 Naval Air Squadron, which arrived on 28 September 1970 after flying in from RNAS Sembawang (HMS &quot;Simbang&quot;), Singapore. They departed to return to RNAS Sembawang on 23 October, just under a month later. The last Royal Navy aircraft to utilise the landing rights at RAF Kai Tak were two Fairey Gannet AEW.3 airborne early warning (AEW) aircraft from &#x27;D&#x27; flight of 849 Naval Air Squadron, which were put ashore from HMS &quot;Eagle&quot; on 14 October 1971 and re-embarked on 27.

The lodger facilities were discontinued after the formal closure of RAF Kai Tak on 30 June 1978.

== Royal Air Force ==

From 1968 to 1978 it was used by various RAF helicopter units, as well as the Royal Hong Kong Auxiliary Air Force.

== Royal Hong Kong Auxiliary Air Force ==

The civilian Royal Hong Kong Auxiliary Air Force was based at Kai Tak between 1 May 1949 and 1 April 1993, supported by the Royal Air Force. It comprised the Hong Kong Auxiliary Air Force Wing (which was previously the Hong Kong Auxiliary Squadron) between 24 November 1953 and December 1954 which controlled the Hong Kong (Fighter) Squadron, Hong Kong Fighter Control Unit and the Hong Kong Air Traffic Control Centre.

The Hong Kong Auxiliary Flight was formed on 15 September 1949 operating Spitfire F.24&#x27;s and Auster AOP.6&#x27;s, it was expanded into the Hong Kong Auxiliary Squadron on 1 October 1950, with the addition of Harvard IIb&#x27;s. On 24 November 1953 the auxiliary squadron was split into the Hong Kong (Fighter) Squadron and the Hong Kong Auxiliary Air Force Wing. The new (Fighter) Squadron gained the Auster T.7 and was disbanded during December 1954.

The RAF left Kai Tak and moved most other operations to RAF Sek Kong on 30 June 1978. From 1993 the civilian Government Flying Service replaced the Royal Hong Kong Auxiliary Air Force at Kai Tak.

<text>Graig Nettles (born August 20, 1944), nicknamed &quot;Puff&quot;, is an American former Major League Baseball third baseman. During a 22-year baseball career, he played for the Minnesota Twins (1967–1969), Cleveland Indians (1970–1972), New York Yankees (1973–1983), San Diego Padres (1984–1986), Atlanta Braves (1987), and Montreal Expos (1988).

Nettles is regarded as one of the best defensive third basemen of all time, winning Gold Glove Awards in 1977 and 1978. Despite his relatively low career batting average, he was a clutch offensive contributor, particularly with runners in scoring position. In addition, he set an American League record for career home runs by a third baseman. His 68.0 Wins Above Replacement (WAR) is the highest among all players with a batting average of .250 or lower.

Nettles was a six-time All-Star player. As a part of four pennant-winning Yankee teams, Nettles enjoyed his best season in 1977 when he won the Gold Glove Award and had career-highs in home runs (37) and runs batted in (107) in leading the Yankees to the World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers.

==Early life==
Nettles was born and raised in San Diego, California. Nettles&#x27; unusual first name derives from his mother&#x27;s dislike of the names Greg and Craig – and her combining the two to produce &quot;Graig.&quot; &quot;My dad was away at the war, so he didn&#x27;t have any say.&quot; The name also led to confusion for baseball card companies; the error-prone inaugural 1981 Fleer baseball card set includes an error card where his name is spelled &quot;Graig&quot; on the front, and &quot;Craig&quot; on the back.

Nettles graduated from San Diego High School in 1962, then attended San Diego State College on a basketball scholarship, where he played for both the Aztecs&#x27; basketball and baseball teams. In 1964 and 1965, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Alaska Goldpanners of the Alaska Baseball League, helping to lead the team to two league championships.

==Career==
The Minnesota Twins drafted Nettles in the fourth round (79th overall) of the 1965 Major League Baseball draft. He made his MLB debut with the Twins on September 6, 1967 as a pinch hitter for Jackie Hernández, flying out in his only at bat. Nettles played his first full major league season with the Twins in 1969, and batted .222 with seven home runs and 26 RBI in 96 games.

On December 10, 1969, the Twins traded Nettles with Dean Chance, Ted Uhlaender, and a player to be named later (PTBNL) to the Cleveland Indians for Luis Tiant and Stan Williams. After playing three seasons with the Indians, Nettles was acquired with Jerry Moses by the New York Yankees for John Ellis, Charlie Spikes, Rusty Torres and Jerry Kenney at the Winter Meetings on November 27, 1972. The Indians traded Nettles due to a feud between Nettles and manager Ken Aspromonte.

Nettles was named the AL player of the month for April 1974, as he set the AL record for home runs in a month with 11. On September 7, 1974, Nettles was caught using a bat that had six superballs inside it. He said that he had received the bat from a Yankees fan in Chicago and did not know that the bat had been altered.

On September 14, 1974, Nettles and his brother Jim homered in the same game, joining a select club that includes Bret and Aaron Boone, José and Héctor Cruz, Felipe and César Crespo, Al and Tony Cuccinello, Joe and Dom DiMaggio, and Rick and Wes Ferrell. The seven sets of brothers hit their homers playing for opposing teams.

Nettles began the 1975 season batting .287 with 14 home runs and 56 RBI in 86 games. He was named the starting third baseman for the AL in the 1975 MLB All-Star Game, the first All-Star selection of his career. Nettles finished the season with a .267 average, 21 home runs and 91 RBI in 157 games. He also led the AL in sacrifice flies, with 11.

During a brawl in a game against the Boston Red Sox on May 20, , Nettles, who was on second base at the onset of the brawl, tackled Boston pitcher Bill Lee from behind. When it appeared that the dust had settled and the brawl was over, Lee confronted Nettles for tackling him from behind and said something about Nettles’s sister. The fracas resumed when Nettles swung at Lee. More players joined in the fray and Nettles broke Lee&#x27;s collarbone when they went down in the pile. Despite the incident, Nettles was not suspended. For the season, he batted .254 with an AL-leading 32 home runs and 93 RBI in 158 games.
Nettles enjoyed his best season in 1977, when he picked up his first of two Gold Glove Awards, and batted .255 while setting career-highs with 37 homers and 107 RBI in 158 games, helping lead the Yankees to a World Series victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. The following season, Nettles earned his second Gold Glove to help the Yankees bring back-to-back World Series championships to the Bronx.

During Game 3 of the 1978 World Series at Yankee Stadium, with the Dodgers leading the series two games to none, Nettles made some spectacular plays at the hot corner to stop potential run-scoring hits and help the Yankees win a crucial game in the series. New York went on to win the next three contests and clinch the world championship.

In July 1980, Nettles hit his 267th career home run, the most among AL third basemen. He was limited to 89 games in 1980 because of hepatitis, which plagued him all year long.

In the fall of 1982, George Steinbrenner, the Yankees owner, stated that Nettles &quot;is in the twilight of his career, and if he never plays another game for me, he has earned more than what I have paid him.&quot; This comment insulted Nettles and led to his growing dissatisfaction with the Yankees. The dissatisfaction continued when the Yankees acquired Toby Harrah in February 1984, intending to platoon him with Nettles at third base. In response, Nettles arrived at the Yankees&#x27; spring training camp in Florida at the very deadline for players to report. On March 30, 1984, the Yankees traded Nettles to the San Diego Padres for Dennis Rasmussen and a PTBNL. Nettles had wanted to play closer to his San Diego home, and his approval of the trade was required given his years of service.

Nettles famously described his career with the Yankees by stating, &quot;[w]hen I was a little boy, I wanted to be a baseball player and join the circus. With the Yankees I have accomplished both.&quot;

Nettles was involved in the infamous 1984 &quot;San Diego Padres–Atlanta Braves Beanball Game&quot;, while playing for the Padres during a Braves home game on August 12, 1984. Nettles charged the mound and attempted to tackle Braves relief pitcher Donnie Moore after Moore intentionally beaned Nettles. Nettles missed and then was thrown to the ground by Braves first baseman (and former longtime Yankee teammate) Chris Chambliss who then sat on him. In 1985, after teammate Eric Show surrendered Pete Rose&#x27;s record-breaking 4,192nd hit, Nettles declared, &quot;The Birch Society is going to expel Eric for making a Red famous,&quot; in reference to Show&#x27;s association with the John Birch Society, a notorious anti-Communist organization. 

The Padres declined to offer Nettles a contract after the 1986 season, making him a free agent. He signed with the Braves for the 1987 season as a non-roster player, making the Braves&#x27; 24-man Opening Day roster. Nettles re-signed with the Braves for the 1988 season. The Montreal Expos purchased Nettles&#x27; contract on March 24, 1988.

In his 22-season career, Nettles hit .248 with 390 home runs and 1,314 RBI in 2,700 games. He had a career fielding percentage of .964, exceptional for the hot corner (third base). After retiring at age 43, Nettles coached for the Yankees (1991) and Padres (1995).

Nettles first became eligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame on the 1994 ballot, where he gained 8.3% of the vote. He fell to 6.1% in 1995, rose back up to 7.9% in 1996, but then fell to 4.7% in 1997 and was removed from the ballot, although it is possible he could be elected through the Veterans Committee. His 67.9 wins above replacement according to Baseball-Reference is the highest of all third basemen not in the Hall of Fame.

==After baseball==

Nettles resides in Lenoir City, Tennessee, a suburb of Knoxville. Graig and his wife Ginger have four children: Michael (deceased), Barrie, Tim, and Jeff. Jeff was selected by the Yankees in the 47th round (1,389th overall) of the 1998 Major League Baseball draft.

Nettles managed and played for the St. Lucie Legends of the Senior Professional Baseball Association in 1989. He also played for the league&#x27;s Bradenton Explorers. Nettles batted .301 and played in a total of 62 games; 10 for St. Lucie and 52 for Bradenton. Nettles managed the Bakersfield Blaze of the California League in 1996 to a 39–101 record.

Nettles served as a consultant for &quot;The Bronx Is Burning&quot;, a television drama that documented the 1977 Yankees.

On March 21, 2008, Nettles announced that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer in late November 2007 and would undergo surgery at Manhattan&#x27;s Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center on April 8. His brother had been diagnosed with prostate cancer earlier in 2007.

==Legacy==
Tommy John remembered Nettles for his great sense of humor, writing: &quot;Graig Nettles was great with the one-liners, the zingers...He was the team&#x27;s pressure valve...Every clubhouse needs a guy like that, the guy with the acerbic wit who can take your mind off a bad situation.&quot;

Nettles wrote a controversial book, &quot;Balls&quot;, a memoir of his baseball career written in collaboration with Peter Golenbock. In the book, Nettles criticized Steinbrenner and some players as well. When the book&#x27;s advance promotion came to Steinbrenner&#x27;s attention in March 1984, Nettles was summarily traded to his hometown San Diego Padres.

In 1991, Nettles was also inducted by the San Diego Hall of Champions into the Breitbard Hall of Fame honoring San Diego&#x27;s finest athletes both on and off the playing surface.

As of 2010, Nettles holds the single-season major league record for assists by a third baseman, and is tied with Brooks Robinson for second-most all-time. His 412 assists in 1971 broke the record of 405 shared by Harlond Clift in 1937 and Robinson in 1967. In 1973, his first year as a New York Yankee, he recorded 410 assists, breaking Clete Boyer&#x27;s franchise record of 396 in 1962; Robinson would tie this mark in 1974. To date, Nettles and Robinson have four of the six 400-assist seasons by a third baseman in Major League history.

Nettles is mentioned in the video for Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s 1985 song &quot;Glory Days.&quot; At the end of the video, Springsteen&#x27;s character, a pitcher, tells a teen that he lost an imaginary game playing against the San Diego Padres because &quot;Nettles got me, bottom of the ninth.&quot;

<doc id="1011332" wikidata="Q10531432" url="?curid=1011332" title="Predicate variable">
<text>In mathematical logic, a predicate variable is a predicate letter which functions as a &quot;placeholder&quot; for a relation (between terms), but which has not been specifically assigned any particular relation (or meaning). Common symbols for denoting predicate variables include capital roman letters such as formula_1, formula_2 and formula_3, or lower case roman letters, e.g., formula_4. In first-order logic, they can be more properly called metalinguistic variables. In higher-order logic, predicate variables correspond to propositional variables which can stand for well-formed formulas of the same logic, and such variables can be quantified by means of (at least) second-order quantifiers.

== Notation ==
Predicate variables should be distinguished from predicate constants, which could be represented either with a different (exclusive) set of predicate letters, or by their own symbols which really do have their own specific meaning in their domain of discourse: e.g. formula_5.

If letters are used for both predicate constants and predicate variables, then there must be a way of distinguishing between them. One possibility is to use letters &quot;W&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Z&quot; to represent predicate variables and letters &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;..., &quot;U&quot;, &quot;V&quot; to represent predicate constants. If these letters are not enough, then numerical subscripts can be appended after the letter in question (as in &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, &quot;X&quot;3). 

Another option is to use Greek lower-case letters to represent such metavariable predicates. Then, such letters could be used to represent entire well-formed formulae (wff) of the predicate calculus: any free variable terms of the wff could be incorporated as terms of the Greek-letter predicate. This is the first step towards creating a higher-order logic.

== Usage ==

If the predicate variables are not defined as belonging to the vocabulary of the predicate calculus, then they are predicate metavariables, whereas the rest of the predicates are just called &quot;predicate letters&quot;. The metavariables are thus understood to be used to code for axiom schema and theorem schemata (derived from the axiom schemata). 

Whether the &quot;predicate letters&quot; are constants or variables is a subtle point: they are not constants in the same sense that formula_6 are predicate constants, or that formula_7 are numerical constants.

If &quot;predicate variables&quot; are only allowed to be bound to predicate letters of zero arity (which have no arguments), where such letters represent propositions, then such variables are &quot;propositional variables&quot;, and any predicate logic which allows second-order quantifiers to be used to bind such propositional variables is a second-order predicate calculus, or second-order logic.

If predicate variables are also allowed to be bound to predicate letters which are unary or have higher arity, and when such letters represent &quot;propositional functions&quot;, such that the domain of the arguments is mapped to a range of different propositions, and when such variables can be bound by quantifiers to such sets of propositions, then the result is a higher-order predicate calculus, or higher-order logic.

<doc id="1011333" wikidata="Q1040839" url="?curid=1011333" title="Love Psychedelico">
<text>, sometimes abbreviated as , is a Japanese rock duo formed in Tokyo in 1997. Consisting of vocalist and rhythm guitarist Kumi and lead guitarist Naoki, they have been signed to Victor Entertainment their entire career. Their first studio album, &quot;The Greatest Hits&quot; (2001), was a major success, debuting at number one and selling over two million copies. They are popular not only in Japan, but also in Hong Kong and Taiwan.

== History ==
Love Psychedelico was formed in January 1997 by vocalist Kumi and guitarist Naoki Sato, who met as members of the music club at Aoyama Gakuin University in Tokyo. Kumi stated that the two hit it off immediately as Naoki was the first person she had met that had the same passion for music as her. The group&#x27;s original name was &quot;Love Psychedelic Orchestra&quot;, but the third word was eventually dropped and its first letter added to the end of the second word. It went through several member lineups, with people coming and going, until Kumi and Naoki were the only two remaining. In 1997, a song they submitted to an FM radio station garnered the attention of various music executives, who began to offer them recording contracts in 1999.

Love Psychedelico signed with major record label Victor Entertainment and released &quot;Lady Madonna (Yūutsu Naru Spider)&quot; as their debut single on April 21, 2000. It is the first song that the duo ever wrote together. Their first album, &quot;The Greatest Hits&quot;, was released on January 11, 2001. Naoki explained that it was created as a demo to recruit more band members, but the label liked it and released it largely as it was. They only re-recorded the vocals and acoustic guitar. The album sold one million copies in three days, and went on to sell over two million. It won Best Rock Album of the Year at the 15th Japan Gold Disc Awards, while Love Psychedelico were also recipients of New Artist of the Year. The duo visited America that March when they headlined Japan Nite at South by Southwest. They also toured the club and bar circuit in the United States, garnering largely positive reactions. American cities the band has said to have enjoyed playing were Nashville, Austin, and Kumi&#x27;s childhood home of San Francisco. &quot;Love Psychedelic Orchestra&quot;, their second album, followed a year later on January 9, 2002, and sold 800,000 copies. Love Psychedelico were nominated for Best Rock Video at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards Japan.

The group&#x27;s third album, &quot;Love Psychedelico III&quot;, was released on February 25, 2004 and later certified Double Platinum for sales of 500,000. It was the first album that the band produced themselves, and they have continued to self-produce all of their subsequent recordings. In November, they went on their first tour of Asia, with concerts in South Korea and Hong Kong. The following year saw the February 9, 2005 release of the duo&#x27;s first compilation album, &quot;Early Times&quot;. It received a positive response in Taiwan, where they held a concert in June of that year.

&quot;Golden Grapefruit&quot;, their fourth studio album released on June 27, 2007, was the first recorded at the band&#x27;s private studio of the same name. Love Psychedelico made their first televised music program appearance on &quot;Bokura no Ongaku&quot; to promote it. They were interviewed by their friend Yoko Ono for the show. In 2008, the compilation album &quot;This is Love Psychedelico&quot; was released in the United States on May 20 by HackTone Records. David Gorman, president of the label, wanted a contract with the band after hearing a record he got from an acquaintance in 2005. It was released in Japan on June 18. Love Psychedelico are featured on the song &quot;Mood&quot; from Curly Giraffe&#x27;s 2009 self-cover album &quot;Thank You for Being a Friend&quot;.

The band released their fifth album &quot;Abbot Kinney&quot; on January 13, 2010. Named after Abbot Kinney Boulevard, where HackTone Records was located, it was created based on their experiences living on the West Coast of the United States for a few months in 2008, and inspired by West Coast rock and country music. They also wrote the August 2010 single &quot;This Is Love&quot; for the boy band SMAP. The duo&#x27;s album &quot;In This Beautiful World&quot; was released on April 17, 2013. The album&#x27;s tour saw American percussionist Lenny Castro as part of their backing band. The following year saw the first acoustic Love Psychedelico concert in Japan to only feature the duo of Kumi and Naoki. The group also covered &quot;Hikari&quot; for the 2014 Hikaru Utada tribute album &quot;Utada Hikaru no Uta&quot;. 2015 marked the 15th anniversary of Love Psychedelico&#x27;s debut. They celebrated by releasing &quot;The Best I&quot; and &quot;The Best II&quot; compilation albums in February and holding an anniversary tour from May to July, where they were supported by Yukihiro Takahashi on drums. An Asian tour followed in November, which included a performance at the Clockenflap festival in Hong Kong and a one-man anniversary live in Taiwan.

&quot;Love Your Love&quot;, the band&#x27;s seventh studio album, was released on July 5, 2017. 2019 saw Kumi and Naoki take their &quot;Two of Us&quot; acoustic performances as a duo on the road for the first time with a national tour. In 2020, Love Psychedelico celebrated their 20th anniversary with four releases, including the compilation album &quot;Complete Singles 2000–2019&quot;. A tour was also planned, but it was postponed until May 2021. They also provided Takuya Kimura with the song &quot;My Life&quot; for his 2020 album &quot;Go with the Flow&quot;. The band&#x27;s first album in five years, &quot;A Revolution&quot;, was released on October 5, 2022. In 2024, they collaborated with Glim Spanky on the song &quot;Ai ga Michiru Made&quot; for their &quot;All the Greatest Dudes&quot; compilation album.

==Musical style==

Stylistically, Love Psychedelico&#x27;s music is reminiscent of the British Invasion of the late 1960s. Both members have cited The Beatles and Led Zeppelin as influences, though the influence of American folk and blues is also present. Kumi has named Janis Joplin and Sheryl Crow as influences, while Sato likes Bob Dylan. When writing songs, Naoki first brings the guitar riffs and the duo imagine the groove and beat and &quot;just keep jamming until we feel, &#x27;this is it&#x27;.&quot; Naoki explained, &quot;In the 60&#x27;s, rock n&#x27; roll music was dance music, or that&#x27;s my understanding. It&#x27;s important that the music makes the body move, so in order to get the groove going, we just keep jamming.&quot; Kumi said that they work on one song at a time, and although she has an idea of what she wants the album to look like as a whole, people are not required to listen to their albums in their entirety. They sometimes have song titles that are similar to already famous songs, such as &quot;Lady Madonna&quot; and &quot;Your Song&quot;. The duo have described this as a coincidence that &quot;just happens&quot;. Love Psychedelico have self-produced all of their recordings since 2004&#x27;s &quot; Love Psychedelico III&quot;. Almost all of their material is recorded at their own private studio, Golden Grapefruit Recording Studio.

An identifiable trait of Love Psychedelico&#x27;s music is their mix of Japanese and English lyrics and Kumi&#x27;s pronunciation of them. While mixing the two languages is common in popular Japanese music, Kumi&#x27;s singing is marked not only by fluent English pronunciation, but also an English-inflected pronunciation of Japanese. (Her spoken Japanese does not display the same affectations.) According to Andrew Moody, this pronunciation makes the group&#x27;s songs difficult to reproduce in karaoke performances in contrast to bands such as Superfly, who have a similar stylistic approach but without the English-affected Japanese. Additionally, Kanara Ty wrote that Love Psychedelico&#x27;s English proficiency allows them to produce &quot;well-thought out lyrics&quot; in the language, which sets them apart from the other Japanese artists who use English without having such a command of it. Kumi has said that most of her thoughts come to her in both languages, and that she and Naoki write lyrics together by gathering them from the sound of each song.

==Classification==
Classification is an important element that will ensure athletes can compete in a fair situation.

A certain committee will give athletes who can take part in this sport an eight-level-score specific to basketball, ranging from 1 to 4.5. Lower scores represent a larger disability. The sum score of all players on the court cannot exceed 14.

==Teams==

===Men&#x27;s===
===Women&#x27;s===
==Competition format==
Teams consisted of twelve players, of whom five were on court at any one time. Each player was rated between 0.5 and 4.5 points based on the extent of their disability, with 4.5 representing the least physical limitation. The sum of the rates of all players on court at any time was limited to 14.5 points per team.

As their Olympic Counterpart,the Games were played in four periods of ten minutes, with extra time periods of five minutes added as necessary to resolve a tied game.

<doc id="1011338" wikidata="Q612007" url="?curid=1011338" title="Nick Broomfield">
<text>Nicholas Broomfield (born 1948) is an English documentary film director. His self-reflective style has been regarded as influential to many later filmmakers. In the early 21st century, he began to use non-actors in scripted works, which he calls &quot;Direct Cinema&quot;. His output ranges from studies of entertainers to political works such as examinations of South Africa before and after the end of apartheid and the rise of the black-majority government of Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress party.

Broomfield generally works with a minimal crew, recording sound himself and using one or two camera operators. He is often seen in the finished film, usually holding the sound boom and wearing the Nagra tape recorder.

== Early life and education ==
Nicholas Broomfield was born in 1948. He is the son of photographer Maurice Broomfield (1916-2010) and Sonja Lagusova (1922-1982). His mother was a Czech Jew.

From 1959 to 1965, Broomfield was educated at Sidcot School, a Quaker boarding independent school for boys (now co-educational), near the village of Winscombe in Somerset in south west England. He gained higher-level education at University College Cardiff (which became Cardiff University in 1999), where he studied law, and the University of Essex, where he studied political science. Subsequently, he studied film at the National Film and Television School in London. Broomfield&#x27;s early style was conventional cinéma vérité: the juxtaposition of observed scenes, with little use of voice-over or text.

== Career in documentaries ==
After more than a decade of working as a filmmaker, Broomfield altered his film style, appearing on-screen for the first time in &quot;Chicken Ranch&quot; (1983). After several arguments regarding the budget and nature of the film, he decided that he would make the documentary only if he could experiment by filming the very process of making the film—the arguments, the failed interviews and the dead-ends.

This shift in film-making style was strongly influenced by Broomfield&#x27;s struggles in trying to gain distribution for his earlier documentary, &quot;Lily Tomlin&quot;, which chronicled the American comedian&#x27;s one-woman show &quot;The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe&quot;. Tomlin claimed the film was a spoiler for her show and filed suit for $7 million in damages. The documentary was shown on public television but not widely released. Eventually Broomfield&#x27;s documentary was incorporated into the video release of the one-woman show.

Broomfield became known for this self-reflective film-making style: making films that were also about the making itself as well as the ostensible subject. His influence on documentary could be seen in the work of younger filmmakers of the first decade of the 21st century: according to &quot;The Guardian,&quot; Michael Moore, Louis Theroux and Morgan Spurlock each demonstrated similar styles in their recent box-office hits. Such filmmakers have been classified as &quot;Les Nouvelles Egotistes&quot;; others have likened Broomfield&#x27;s work to the Gonzo journalism of American Hunter S. Thompson.

&quot;Kurt &amp; Courtney&quot;, about American musicians Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love, was selected for the 1998 Sundance Film Festival. Its screening was cancelled by the festival after Love threatened to sue, as the film was released after Cobain&#x27;s death. A previous film, &quot;Soldier Girls&quot;, which Broomfield co-directed with Joan Churchill, won first prize at the BAFTA Film Awards a few years previously.

=== Direct Cinema ===
In 2006, Broomfield changed his style again, adopting techniques of what he calls &#x27;Direct Cinema&#x27;: using non-actors to play themselves in dramas with a screenplay. He completed a drama called &quot;Ghosts&quot; for Channel 4; this was inspired by the 2004 Morecambe Bay cockling disaster, when 23 Chinese immigrant cockle pickers drowned after being cut off by the tides. &quot;Ghosts&quot; won an award and helped raise nearly £500,000 to help the victims&#x27; families.

In &quot;Battle for Haditha&quot; (2007), Broomfield worked with ex-Marines and Iraqi refugees, as well as known actors. The film was shot sequentially, enabling the cast to build their characters as the story progressed. It also used real locations, and a very small documentary-style film crew. Although working from a detailed script, Broomfield allowed the actors to improvise and add dialogue. Broomfield based his script on research with the Marines of Kilo Company who took part in the fighting on that day, the survivors of the massacre, and the six-thousand page NCIS government report. &quot;Battle for Haditha&quot; won two international awards.

== Withdrawn films ==

The first of the two &quot;Juvenile Liaison&quot; films was withdrawn from circulation by the BFI executive.

Broomfield explains in &quot;Juvenile Liaison 2&quot;, shot fifteen years after the original, that many of the original film&#x27;s participants withdrew their consent following an early screening in Blackburn library. In interviews, some of the original participants claim to have been persuaded to withdraw their consent by Blackburn police. This lack of consent resulted in the BFI (the film&#x27;s financial backers) withdrawing the film from circulation. Both films have been widely available since at least 1990, including via mainstream streaming services. The BFI production board who originally voted to finance the film, all resigned in disgust at the BFI executive taking the decision to effectively ban the film except for screenings for specialized groups, such as social workers.

Broomfield (and Joan Churchill)&#x27;s next film, &quot;Tattooed Tears&quot;, was shot in California in 1978. It won the California State Bar Award among other awards for promoting justice. Broomfield and Churchill continued the struggle to get &quot;Juvenile Liaison&quot; released, which is why they made &quot;Juvenile Liaison II&quot; in 1990.

== Commercials ==
In 1999, Broomfield made a series of five commercials for Volkswagen. Each of these featured Broomfield with his trademark sound boom &quot;investigating&quot; rumours about the soon-to-be released Volkswagen Passat.

== Personal life ==
He has two sons: Barney and Charlie Broomfield.

Broomfield told the BBC that he professes irreligion. He said, &quot;I believe that there&#x27;s a goodness out there, and I think there&#x27;s goodness in everybody. We should probably all try and have a good dig around and find out where it is.&quot;

<doc id="1011342" wikidata="Q956303" url="?curid=1011342" title="Ghosts 'n Goblins (video game)">
<text>Ghosts &#x27;n Goblins, known as in Japan, is a 1985 platform video game developed and published by Capcom for arcades. It is the first game in the &quot;Ghosts &#x27;n Goblins&quot; franchise, and it has been ported to numerous home platforms.

It was a major commercial success across arcades and home systems. It was among the top ten highest-grossing arcade games of 1986 in Japan and the US, the year&#x27;s sixth best-selling computer game in the UK, and NES version sold over cartridges worldwide. It initially received generally positive reviews from critics. It is often cited as one of the most difficult games of all time, and retrospectively it has been considered one of the greatest video games ever made.

==Gameplay==

The player controls a knight named Sir Arthur, who must defeat zombies, giants (referred to as &quot;big men&quot;), demons, cyclopes, dragons, and other monsters to rescue Princess Prin-Prin, who has been kidnapped by Astaroth (also called the Devil or Great Satan, to distinguish him from another boss demon named Satan), king of Demon World. Along the way, the player can pick up new weapons, bonuses, and extra suits of armor that can help in this task.

The player can only be hit twice before losing a life, which results in having to restart the level, or starting at the checkpoint if the player has reached it. Furthermore, the player will lose a life if a level is not completed within a set time limit. After defeating the final boss (The Devil), the player must then replay the entire game on a higher difficulty level to reach the genuine final ending.

==Ports==
&quot;Ghosts &#x27;n Goblins&quot; was ported to Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Commodore 16, Game Boy Color, IBM PC compatibles, NEC PC-8801, Nintendo Entertainment System, and ZX Spectrum.

=== Consoles===
The Famicom version was released on June 13, 1986, and was the first Famicom game to utilize a 128 KB cartridge. The North American NES version was released on November 1, 1986, and in Europe in 1989. The Famicom/NES version was programmed by Micronics and published by Capcom. A hidden in-game credits screen verifies that it was scored by the original composer, Ayako Mori. Upon defeating the game a second time, the player is given the following message:

The Famicom/NES ports served as the basis for the Game Boy Color version, which utilized passwords to allow the player to access certain levels. Allister Brimble scored this version.

===Computers===

The Commodore 64 version, released in 1986, contains music by Mark Cooksey, which borrows from Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s Prelude Op. 28, No. 20. Due to the limited resources on the Commodore 64, it was somewhat different from the arcade version as it only features certain levels. In 2015, Ghosts&#x27;n Goblins Arcade, a fan-made version more closely matching the original arcade game, was ported to C64.

The version for Commodore 16/116 and Commodore Plus/4, also released in 1986 by Elite Systems, was even more limited than the C64 version. It was written to work on a Commodore 16, which had only 16 KB of RAM. Therefore, this version features only two levels and no music. In addition, the remaining two levels and the gameplay are simplified.

A version for the Amiga was released in 1990. While the hardware of the Amiga allowed an almost perfect conversion of the arcade game, it failed to emulate the success of the Commodore 64 version. The player starts the game with six lives, and no music plays unless the Amiga was equipped with at least 1 megabyte of RAM. The standard configuration of an Amiga 500 had 512 kilobytes.

Mark Cooksey scored the C64, Amiga and ST versions. David Whittaker scored the Amstrad CPC version.

==Reception==

===Commercial performance===
The arcade game was a major hit. In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Makaimura&quot; on their October 1, 1985 issue as being the second most-popular arcade game for the previous two weeks, before it went on to be the fourth highest-grossing table arcade game during the first half of 1986 and the overall tenth highest-grossing table arcade game of 1986.

In the United States, advance sales topped a thousand arcade units prior to release in the region, with test units each earning about $400 per week. &quot;Ghosts &#x27;n Goblins&quot; went on to become America&#x27;s ninth highest-grossing arcade game of 1986. In the United Kingdom, it had a slow start, initially appearing mainly at pubs and clubs rather than major amusement arcades in late 1985, before the game went on to become a major arcade hit by 1986.

The NES version was a best-seller, with 1.64 million units sold worldwide. On home computers, it was the top-selling game in the United Kingdom for two months during July–August 1986, and it went on to become the sixth best-selling game of 1986 in the UK. The success of &quot;Commando&quot; (1985) and &quot;Ghosts &#x27;n Goblins&quot; have been credited as the products &quot;that shot&quot; Capcom to &quot;8-bit silicon stardom&quot; in the mid-1980s.

===Critical reception===
The arcade game received a positive review from Clare Edgeley of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; magazine in 1985. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; called the NES version of &quot;Ghosts &#x27;n Goblins&quot; &quot;an excellent example of what the [NES] can do ... while hardly groundbreaking, [it] represents the kind of game that made Nintendo famous&quot;.

&quot;Ghosts &#x27;n Goblins&quot; was runner-up in the category of Arcade Game of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards. In the 1986 &quot;Famitsu&quot; Best Hit Game Awards, the Famicom version received the &quot;Best Port&quot; award.

The NES version of &quot;Ghosts &#x27;n Goblins&quot; was rated the 129th best game made on a Nintendo system in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; Top 200 Games list. Writing in 2007, Marcel van Duyn of &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; gave the game 7 out of 10 stars, declaring that it provided &quot;appeal and enjoyment&quot; to fans of the series, while criticising its platforming and finding that it was &quot;less fun than its contemporaries&quot;.

The game is often cited as an example of one of the most difficult games of all time, due to its extremely hard level design and the fact that the player dies within two hits while the enemies can spawn unexpectedly all over the map. Moreover, the player must play through all of the levels again at a higher difficulty setting unlocked after completing the levels regularly in order to beat the game, without any way to save. &quot;Gamerant&quot; named it the 5th hardest video game of all time. In a 2011 review, Lucas Thomas of &quot;IGN&quot; opined that the game was so hard it would be a &quot;waste of time&quot; for most players, as they would not be able to justify the eight-dollar price tag the game had at the time.

==Legacy==
===Sequels===
&quot;Ghosts &#x27;n Goblins&quot; was followed by a series of sequels and spin-offs eventually becoming Capcom&#x27;s 8th best-selling game franchise, selling over 4.4 million units. Its sequels include &quot;Ghouls &#x27;n Ghosts&quot;, &quot;Super Ghouls &#x27;n Ghosts&quot;, &quot;Ultimate Ghosts &#x27;n Goblins&quot; and &quot;Ghosts &#x27;n Goblins Resurrection&quot; in addition to producing the &quot;Gargoyle&#x27;s Quest&quot; and &quot;&quot; spin-off series. Though originating as an arcade title, the franchise has been featured on a variety of PC and video game consoles with a later entry in the series, &quot;Ghosts &#x27;n Goblins: Gold Knights&quot;, being released on the iOS. Additionally, the franchise frequently makes cameo appearances — the character of Arthur in particular — in other Capcom titles, the latest of which being &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite&quot; (in which Firebrand, the Red Arremer that protagonizes the &quot;Gargoyle&#x27;s Quest&quot; spin-off, also appears).

===Re-releases===
The NES version was also re-released for download for Nintendo&#x27;s Virtual Console in North America on December 10, 2007 (Wii) and October 25, 2012 (Nintendo 3DS) and in the PAL region on October 31, 2008 (Wii) and January 3, 2013 (Nintendo 3DS) while the Wii U version was released in both regions on May 30, 2013. The arcade version was released on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console Arcade in Japan on November 16, 2010, the PAL region on January 7, 2011 and in North America on January 10, 2011.

The original arcade version of the game was also included in the compilation &quot;Capcom Generations Vol.2: Chronicles of Arthur&quot; for the PlayStation (in Japan and Europe) and Sega Saturn (in Japan only), which also contained &quot;Ghouls &#x27;n Ghosts&quot; and &quot;Super Ghouls &#x27;n Ghosts&quot;. The three games (based on their &quot;Capcom Generation&quot; versions) were later collected as part of &quot;Capcom Classics Collection&quot;. The game was also featured in the compilation &quot;Capcom Arcade Cabinet&quot; for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

The Game Boy version was included in the Classic NES series for the Game Boy Advance, but only in Japan.

Nintendo re-released the NES version of &quot;Ghosts &#x27;n Goblins&quot; as part of the company&#x27;s NES Classic Edition.

The NES version of &quot;Ghosts &#x27;n Goblins&quot; was re-released on Nintendo Switch Online upon launch, while an SP version, which allows immediate access of the final level, was added to the service on December 13, 2018.

<doc id="1011346" wikidata="Q5192491" url="?curid=1011346" title="Cuddebackville Dam">
<text>The Cuddebackville Dam was a concrete dam on the Neversink River in Deerpark, Orange County, New York near the town of Cuddebackville, New York, removed in October, 2004 to benefit aquatic life. It was the first dam removed in New York State for environmental reasons.

==History==
The Cuddebackville Dam is actually two different dams that are separated by a small island. The original structure was built in the 1820s to divert water from the Neversink River into the Delaware and Hudson Canal (D&amp;H Canal). The second structure was built in 1903. The Cuddebackville Dam was six feet high and across. The dam was built to divert water to turbines to generate electricity. The water was diverted into a feeder canal connected to a small hydropower plant. The plant was abandoned in 1945 because modern power lines were built to draw electricity from farther away. The dam fell into ownership of the Orange County. The dam was removed in October, 2004 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in partnership with the Nature Conservancy to benefit the aquatic life in the area. Removal of the dam caused a change in the hydrology of the Neversink River and impeded the flow of water into the D&amp;H Canal feeder. This led to the withering of the one mile long segment of the D&amp;H Canal at Cuddebackville which had remained watered up to that time.

==Effect on aquatic life==
The Neversink River is the home to a rich diversity of aquatic life, some of which are on the list of federally endangered species. The river is also known for its pristine water conditions. In addition to being a home to endangered species the river is an internationally famous site for fly-fishing. However, all of these qualities were being threatened by the Cuddebackville Dam. In particular, two species were under threat, the Dwarf Wedge Mussel and the American Shad.

===Dwarf wedgemussel===
The Neversink River contains a large population of sea mussels and the richest diversity of freshwater mussels in the upper Delaware River Basin. However, one of the seven species of mussels found in the Neversink River, the dwarf wedgemussel, is on the federal list of endangered species. This situation was not being aided by the mussels being collected by the abandoned Cuddebackville Dam. The collection of mussel species near the dam was resulting in the Neversink River&#x27;s mussel population being primarily concentrated in one area, instead being well distributed throughout the river. Before the removal of the dam, not one dwarf wedgemussel could be found beyond the dam. This was making the mussels highly susceptible to extinction. A catastrophic flood, oil spill, chemical spill, or epidemic could have resulted in local extinction of the mussel populations in the Neversink River. The threat that the dam posed on the mussel life, particularly the Dwarf Wedge Mussel was one of the primary reasons for its removal.

===American shad===

The Cuddebackville Dam also caused problems for the fish in the Neversink River. The dam restricted the upstream movement of the American shad and the trout in the river. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation had reported cases of schools of 100 to 1000 fish attempting to migrate up the Neversink River, only to be blocked by the dam.

==Removal==
In order to protect the endangered aquatic life in the Neversink River the dam was removed in October, 2004. The project was a combined effort of the Nature Conservancy and the Army Corps of Engineers. Dams had previously been removed for environmental reasons in other states. However, the Cuddebackville Dam was the first dam in the state of New York to be removed solely for environmental reasons. The cost of the removal process was about $2.2 million. The Nature Conservancy covered 35% of this expense, the Army Corps of Engineers covered the rest.

===The Nature Conservancy===
The Nature Conservancy is known primarily for buying land that might be threatened by development due to its environmental sensitivity. The removal of the Cuddebackville Dam marked a turning point in the organization, in which they broadened their scope to protecting an endangered species by protecting an entire ecosystem. The Nature Conservancy&#x27;s interest in the situation began in 1993, three years after the Dwarf Wedge Mussel was discovered and placed on the federal endangered species list. In 1993, the Nature Conservancy purchased 170 upland acres of land on the Neversink River and created the Neversink Preserve in order to protect the newly discovered species of mussel. Over time they have purchased more land so that the Neversink Preserve covers . However, the Nature Conservancy found that the purchasing and protecting of the land was not enough to protect the Dwarf Wedge Mussel due to the complexity of their life cycle and the interference of the Cuddebackville Dam.

===Army Corps of Engineers===
The removal of the Cuddebackville Dam marked a change in purpose of the Army Corps of Engineers. The organization for over a century has been building dams and has focused on development. However, the removal of the Cuddebackville Dam marks a new trend of the Army Corps of Engineers removing dams and having an awareness of the environmental impact of the structures that they build. This also shows a changing mindset in the upcoming generation of engineers who in general may be more opposed to dam construction than their predecessors. The project also marks the first time that the Army Corps of Engineers has worked with a nonprofit organization like the Nature Conservancy since a federal law was passed in 1999 allowing such a partnership.

<text>Haan () is a town in the district of Mettmann, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is situated at the western edge of the Bergisches Land, 12 km southwest of Wuppertal and 17 km east of Düsseldorf. In 1975, Gruiten was incorporated into Haan.

==History==

Haan&#x27;s origins date back to around 2200 BC. At that time, a hail-shaped settlement was founded in today&#x27;s city center, which is equipped with a rampart, palisade fence and hedging strips. Accordingly, the name &quot;Haan&quot; should be derived from Hagen, with a reorganization analogous to grove.

From 718 AD Haan was close to the Saxon-Franconian border running between Sonnborn and Elberfeld (both today in Wuppertal). Since today&#x27;s Kaiserstrasse was a route for the Franconian troops to the east, a marketing system (sutlers) was created in Haan to supply the soldiers.

Even before the early High Middle Ages, Haan belonged to the Archdiocese of Cologne together with Hilden and, even after the formation of the county and later the Duchy of Berg, was initially one of the enclaves within this territorial area. Already around 850, a pre-Romanesque chapel or church was built on the old church square, which Archbishop Wichfried von Köln consecrated in 935. At that time this church was subordinate to the main church in Hilden.

In 1386 the road from Hilden via Haan to Elberfeld, today&#x27;s federal road 228, was first mentioned in a document. The first evidence of the grinding and weaving trade, which was widespread in Haan until the 20th century, can be dated back to 1589 and 1724 respectively.

In the second half of the 16th century the church of Haan was reformed by the Evangelicals.

Until 1806, Haan, Obgruiten and Gruiten belonged to the Amt Solingen, Ellscheid to the Amt Mettmann within the Duchy of Berg. In 1808, the towns of Haan, Ellscheid, Millrath (today Erkrath), Gruiten, Schöller and Sonnborn (both today Wuppertal) came under French rule and were united to form &quot;Mairie Haan&quot;. In 1815 this Mairie was placed under Prussian administration and rededicated to a Prussian mayor&#x27;s office. [6] At that time, the Mayor&#x27;s Office (no real office, in German: Bürgermeisterei) of Haan included the following seven special household parishes: Parish Haan, Honschaft Ellscheid, Honschaft Millrath, Honschaft Gruiten, Honschaft Schöller, Honschaft Obgruiten and Kirchspiel Sonnborn.

In 1841, with the completion of the Elberfeld — Gruiten — Düsseldorf railway line, Haan was connected to the ever-expanding rail network. Another connection followed in 1867 with the Ohligs-Gruiten line.

In the same year, Sonnborn retired from the Haan mayor&#x27;s office (Bürgermeisterei). In 1894, Haan left the mayor&#x27;s office and Millrath, Gruiten and Schöller henceforth formed the mayor&#x27;s office which later included Amt Gruiten.

In 1899 Haan got connection to the tram connection from Benrath (today to Düsseldorf) via Hilden to Vohwinkel (today to Wuppertal). City rights were granted to Haan in 1921.

At the turn of 1944/1945, World War II left visible traces in the cityscape when residential areas in Upper and Middle Haan were bombed on New Year&#x27;s and New Year&#x27;s Day. 70 people were killed. On April 16, 1945, US-American troops entered Haan, which were replaced by British forces in July 1945.

In 1956, the Catholic parish replaced its neo-Gothic church from 1869 with the modern St. Chrysanthus and Daria church.

Since July 14, 2017, Haan has had the addition of the name &quot;Garden City&quot; to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia in accordance with section 13 (3) of the municipal code. The city had previously described itself as a “garden city”. In the 19th century, deep garden areas were assigned to the residential buildings; Seed trading played an important role in the urban economy.

<text>Ross Bass (March 17, 1918 – January 1, 1993) was an American Congressman and United States Senator from Tennessee.

==Early life==
Bass was the son of a circuit-riding Methodist minister in rural Giles County, attended the local public schools, and graduated from Martin Methodist Junior College, Pulaski, Tennessee in 1938.

He joined the United States Army Air Forces and served as a bombardier in Europe during World War II, reaching the rank of captain. After his 1945 discharge Bass opened a flower shop in Pulaski, the county seat. He was named postmaster of Pulaski in 1946, serving until 1954.

==United States Representative==

In 1954, Bass was elected as a Democratic U.S. Congressman from Tennessee&#x27;s 6th District, which included Pulaski. He was reelected four times. Bass signed onto the 1956 anti-desegregation Southern Manifesto, but was the only Democratic Representative from the rural South to vote for the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The only other Southern Representatives to vote for the bill were from large cities—Richard Fulton from Nashville, Tennessee, Charles Weltner from Atlanta, Georgia, Claude Pepper from Miami, Florida and four Representatives from Texas (Jack Brooks, Henry B. Gonzalez, J. J. Pickle and Albert Thomas). Bass also voted in favor of the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1962.

==United States Senator==
In 1963, Senator Estes Kefauver died in office. Governor Frank G. Clement made no secret that he wanted to run in the special election due in 1964 for the final two years of Kefauver&#x27;s term. To that end, he appointed one of his cabinet members, Herbert S. Walters, to serve as a caretaker until the special election. However, Clement&#x27;s plan backfired when Bass defeated him in the Democratic primary held in August.

In November, Bass defeated the Republican nominee, Howard Baker by only 51,575 votes the closest that a Republican had come to winning election to the Senate from Tennessee at the time. Since the election was for an unexpired term, and in the Senate seniority is a very important consideration when being considered for committee assignments, office assignments, and the like, Bass was sworn in as soon as the election results could be certified in order to give him a slight seniority advantage over other freshmen Senators elected in 1964. Bass became Tennessee&#x27;s junior Senator (the senior Senator at that time being Albert Gore, Sr.) and prepared to run for a full term in 1966. Bass voted in favor of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

However, this race proved problematic for Bass. Clement still desired the seat for himself, especially since he could not run for reelection as governor in 1966 (in those days, Tennessee governors were barred from immediately succeeding themselves). He wanted to avoid being forced out of politics, as he had once before when faced with term limits the first time in 1958. Due to a large Republican crossover vote, Bass lost the August 1966 Democratic primary to Clement, even though he received 10% more votes than in the previous election. Clement went on to lose resoundingly to Baker in the general election.

==Later political career==
Bass subsequently made two attempts to re-enter politics. He ran for the 1974 Democratic nomination for governor, but finished fifth in a nine-candidate field—well behind the eventual winner, Ray Blanton.

In 1976 he entered the Democratic primary for his former House seat and won the nomination. The district, however, had been significantly redrawn since his previous service. Bass found himself running in a large amount of territory that he did not know and that did not know him. Much of this area was located in suburban territory near Memphis and Nashville that had turned heavily Republican, at least at the national level. Bass lost badly — by almost 29 points — to the incumbent Republican representative, Robin Beard.

==Personal life==
His first marriage to Avanell K Bass ended in divorce in 1967. He married Judy Bobo, of Nashville, in 1975; they divorced in 1979. In 1992 he married Jacqui Colter, who outlived him. After his divorce in 1979, he moved to Florida, where he lived in Miami Shores until his death from lung cancer in 1993, aged 74.
His first cousin is actor Dewey Martin.

<text>[[Wheelchair Rugby]] at the [[2004 Summer Paralympics]] was held at the Helliniko Indoor Arena. 89 athletes participated in the competition, with teams from eight countries taking part.

While wheelchair rugby was designated as a mixed sport, with both men and women eligible to participate in the competition, no female athletes took part.

New Zealand&#x27;s victory in the gold medal game represented the first time that a country from outside North America had won a Paralympics or World Championships title in the sport.

The wheelchair rugby competition in Athens was featured in the 2005 documentary film, &quot;Murderball&quot;.

== Medalists ==

==Classification==
Wheelchair rugby players were given a classification based on their upper body function. A committee gave each athlete a 7-level score ranging from 0.5 to 3.5, with lower scores corresponding to more severe disability. During the game, the total score of all players on the court for a team cannot exceed 8 points. However, for each female player on court, their team gets an extra 0.5 points over the 8 point limit.

==Teams==

Eight teams took part in this sport. Each team could have up to 12 athletes, but no more than 11 of the team members could be male. Listed below are the eight teams qualified for the Athens Paralympics.

== Tournament ==
=== Competition format ===
The eight teams were divided into two even groups and participated in a single round robin tournament. The top two teams from each group went on to compete for 1st through 4th place, while the last two teams from each group competed for 5th through 8th place.

<text>Leo Burnett Worldwide, Inc., also known as Leo Burnett Company, Inc., is an American advertising company, founded on August 5, 1935, in Chicago by Leo Burnett.

In September 2002, the company was acquired by Publicis Groupe, the world&#x27;s third largest advertising agency holding group and one of the largest agency networks.

==History==
Leo Burnett Company, Inc., was founded on August 5, 1935, in Chicago by Leo Burnett, who had three accounts to start. In 1944, the agency opened a branch office in New York City. In February 1967, the founder transferred all of his voting stock to a charitable organization. Billings were then &quot;nearing $250 million&quot;.

On March 20, 1967, the agency completed its acquisition of D.P. Brother &amp; Co. On June 8, 1971, the founder died at the age of 79. 

On November 3, 1999, Burnett and D&#x27;Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles announced the creation of BDM. BDM was quickly renamed Bcom3. Roy Bostock was named chairman and Roger Haupt was named CEO. 

In 2000, Leo Burnett Kreasindo Indonesia is founded. In September 2002, Bcom3 was acquired by Publicis Groupe. 

Brazil-based independent advertising agency Tailor Made was acquired by Publicis in 2011 and merged with Leo Burnett Brazil to form Leo Burnett Tailor Made. At that time, clients included Fiat, Procter &amp; Gamble, Emirates and Chrysler.

Andrew Swinand became CEO in 2017.

== Clients ==

===Foods===
The Pillsbury Doughboy was created for the Pillsbury Company by Rudy Perz, a copywriter for Leo Burnett.

Agency employee Tom Rogers created the character Charlie the Tuna for StarKist Tuna. The ad campaign added the phrase &quot;Sorry Charlie&quot; to the American lexicon. StarKist still uses the spokesfish to represent the brand.

StarKist&#x27;s relationship with the Leo Burnett Company began in 1958 and continued after Heinz bought StarKist in 1963. For Heinz, the agency produced a series of television ads emphasizing the thickness of their ketchup brand, including a memorable ad featuring the Carly Simon song &quot;Anticipation&quot;.

The Jolly Green Giant and Sprout advertising icons came out of the agency. The Minnesota Valley Canning Company originally created the Jolly Green giant character as a large, cave-man looking character to draw attention to the size of their Le Sueur peas. The Leo Burnett agency was hired to make the Jolly Green Giant more friendly-looking. In 1972, the Jolly Green Giant was joined by Sprout to appeal to children.

Hamburger giant McDonald&#x27;s began operations in India in 1996 and recruited Leo Burnett (India).

===Other products===
In 1961, the agency created the &quot;Dependability&quot; campaign for the Maytag brand. The campaign featured actual consumer testimonials on the reliability of their appliances. The campaign evolved into a radio call-in show in Canada where an appliance repairman would offer advice to customers. In 1967, the &#x27;Ol Lonely character debuted on television. Jesse White played the role of the lonely Maytag repairman until 1989 when he was replaced by actor Gordon Jump.

The agency guided Philip Morris (now part of Altria Group) in building Marlboro into a global brand, with an emphasis on manliness as typified by the image of the Marlboro Man on the American Frontier. Previously the brand was &quot;a feminine brand.&quot;

Burnett created the popular brand mascot Morris the Cat for 9Lives cat food. Several dozen television commercials featuring the &quot;finicky&quot; eater were produced from 1969 until Burnett ended their relationship with parent company Heinz in 1994.

==Controversy==

===Pokémon===
In the English dub of the &quot;Pokémon: The Johto Journeys&quot; episode &quot;The Whistle Stop&quot;, originally aired December 2, 2000, the character James gets partially swallowed by his Victreebel, and while struggling utters garbled dialogue consisting of the phrase &quot;Leo Burnett and 4Kids are the Devil!&quot; backmasked. Eric Stuart, James&#x27; English voice actor at the time, later explained that this was in protest of the companies&#x27; decision to stop compensating Pokémon voice actors for the use of their audio clips in promos for the show. This scene was redubbed in later home releases.

===North Face===
In 2019, Brazilian-based subsidiary Leo Burnett Tailor Made engaged in product placement on Wikipedia, in which they placed images advertising The North Face products on Wikipedia, and advertised that they had done so in a video posted on YouTube. Once this was discovered, Wikipedia volunteers removed the images, and the Wikimedia Foundation released a statement condemning Leo Burnett Tailor Made&#x27;s use of Wikipedia for product placement.

The North Face posted a response as a reply on Twitter, stating that they had ended the campaign and that &quot;We believe deeply in Wikipedia’s mission and apologize for engaging in activity inconsistent with those principles.&quot;

<doc id="1011371" wikidata="Q2975734" url="?curid=1011371" title="Keyser Söze">
<text>Keyser Söze ( ) is a fictional character and the main antagonist in the 1995 film &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;, written by Christopher McQuarrie and directed by Bryan Singer. According to the main protagonist, petty con artist Roger &quot;Verbal&quot; Kint (Kevin Spacey), Söze is a crime lord whose ruthlessness and influence have acquired a mythical status among police and criminals alike. Further events in the story make these accounts unreliable; in a twist ending, a police sketch identifies Kint and Söze as one and the same. The character was inspired by real-life murderer John List, and the spy thriller &quot;No Way Out&quot;, which features a shadowy KGB mole who may or may not actually exist.

The character has placed on numerous &quot;best villain&quot; lists over the years, including AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains. Spacey won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, turning him from a character actor into a star. Since the release of the film, the character has become synonymous with infamous criminals. Analysis of the character has focused on the ambiguity of his true identity and whether he even exists inside the story&#x27;s reality. Though the filmmakers have preferred to leave the character&#x27;s nature to viewer interpretation, Singer has said he believes Kint and Söze are the same person.

== Concept and creation ==

Director Bryan Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrie originally conceived of &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; as five felons meeting in a police line-up. Eventually, a powerful underworld figure responsible for their meeting was added to the plot. McQuarrie combined this plot with another idea of his based on the true story of John List, who murdered his family and started a new life. The name was based on one of McQuarrie&#x27;s supervisors, though the last name was changed. McQuarrie settled on Söze after finding it in a Turkish-language dictionary; it comes from the idiom , which means &quot;to talk unnecessarily too much and cause confusion&quot; (literally: to drown in words).

Keyser Söze&#x27;s semi-mythical nature was inspired by Yuri, a rumored KGB mole whose existence nobody can confirm, from the spy thriller &quot;No Way Out&quot;. Kint was not originally written to be as obviously intelligent; in the script, he was, according to McQuarrie, &quot;presented as a dummy&quot;. Spacey and Singer had previously met at a screening for Singer&#x27;s film &quot;Public Access&quot;. Spacey requested a role in Singer&#x27;s next film, and McQuarrie wrote the role of Kint specifically for him. McQuarrie said he wanted audiences to dismiss Kint as a minor character, as Spacey was not yet well-known. Spacey made it more obvious that the character is holding back information, though the depth of his involvement and nature of his secrets remain unrevealed. McQuarrie said that he approved of the changes, as it makes the character &quot;more fascinating&quot;.

== Fictional history ==

&quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; consists mostly of flashbacks narrated by Roger &quot;Verbal&quot; Kint (Kevin Spacey), a con artist with cerebral palsy. Kint was arrested after an apparent drug-related robbery gone wrong which resulted in the destruction of a freighter ship and the deaths of nearly everyone on board. He has been granted immunity from prosecution provided he assists investigators, including Customs Agent David Kujan (Chazz Palminteri), and reveals all details of his involvement with a group of career criminals who are assumed to be responsible for the bloodbath. While Kint is telling his story, Kujan learns the name Keyser Söze from FBI agent Jack Baer (Giancarlo Esposito) and orders Kint to tell him what he knows.

Kint states that Söze was believed to be of Turkish origin, but some have said that he was half German through his father.

According to Kint, Söze began his criminal career as a small-time drug dealer. Horrifically though, one afternoon while Söze is away from home, rival Hungarian gangsters attempt to intimidate him by taking his family hostage and raping his wife, then, when he returns home, slitting the throat of one of his children right before his eyes. Determined to show these &quot;men of will&quot; what will really was, Söze shoots and kills his own family and all but one of the Hungarians, letting the last leave so he can tell his cohorts what happened. Once his family is buried, Söze massacres the Hungarian Mafia, their families, their friends, and even people who owe them money. He goes underground, never again doing business in person, operating instead through oblivious underlings.

Söze&#x27;s ruthlessness is legendary; Kint describes him as having had enemies and disloyal henchmen brutally murdered, along with everyone they hold dear, for the slightest infractions. Over the years, his criminal empire flourishes, as does his legend. Remarking on Söze&#x27;s mythical nature, Kint says, &quot;The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn&#x27;t exist&quot;, a line borrowed from Charles Baudelaire.

In Kint&#x27;s story, he and several other criminals meet after being jailed on a trumped-up hijacking charge and work together as thieves for hire. After a botched robbery, they are blackmailed by Söze, through Söze&#x27;s lawyer Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), into destroying a rival Argentinean gang&#x27;s $91-million drug shipment. All but Kint and a Hungarian, Arkash Kovash (Morgan Hunter), are killed in the attack. However, as no drugs were ever found at the scene, Baer and Kujan believe the true purpose of the attack was to eliminate an informant on the ship named Arturo Marquez, a fugitive whom the Argentineans were attempting to sell to Hungarian mobsters. Marquez, had he survived, was one of the exceedingly rare people who could have positively identified Söze, having actually seen his face.

Kujan confronts Kint with the theory that Söze is corrupt ex-police officer Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), one of the criminals involved. Kujan&#x27;s investigation of Keaton, which had been ongoing for three years, is what had involved him in the case in the first place.

In the film&#x27;s final scene, it is revealed that Kint&#x27;s story is a fabrication, comprising strung-together details culled from a crowded bulletin board in a messy office. Kovash describes Söze to a sketch artist: the drawing faxed in to the police resembles Kint. Kujan pursues Kint, who has already been released, his limp gone. Kujan misses Kint by moments as the latter gets into a car driven by &quot;Kobayashi&quot;.

== Reception and legacy ==

A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Keyser Söze the &quot;perfect postmodern sociopath&quot;, and Quentin Curtis of &quot;The Independent&quot; described him as &quot;the most compelling creation in recent American film&quot;. Jason Bailey of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; identified the role as turning Kevin Spacey from a character actor to a star. Kevin Spacey received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance.

The character placed 48th in the American Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains&quot; in June 2003. &quot;Time&quot; placed him at #10 on their list of most memorably named film characters and #5 in best pop culture gangsters. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked the character #37 in their list of the 100 greatest characters of the past 20 years, #6 in &quot;most vile villains&quot;, and #12 in the best heroes and villains. &quot;Ask Men&quot; ranked him #6 in their list of top ten film villains. &quot;Total Film&quot; ranked him #37 in their best villains and #40 in best characters overall. MSN ranked him #4 in their list of the 13 most menacing villains. &quot;Empire&quot; ranked him #41 in their &quot;100 Greatest Movie Characters&quot; poll.

=== Analysis ===

In an interview with &quot;Metro Silicon Valley&quot;, Pete Postlethwaite quoted Bryan Singer as saying that all the characters are Söze. When asked point blank whether his character is Söze, Postlethwaite said, &quot;Who knows? Nobody knows. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s good about &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;.&quot; Spacey has also been evasive about his character&#x27;s true identity. In an interview with &quot;Total Film&quot;, he said, &quot;That&#x27;s for the audience to decide. My job is to show up and do a part – I don&#x27;t own the audience&#x27;s imagination.&quot; Singer said the film is ambiguous about most of the character&#x27;s details, but the fax sent at the end of the film proves in his mind that Kint is Söze.

Bryan Enk, writing for UGO, states that the myth-making story of Söze&#x27;s origins is a classic ghost story that would be right at home in horror fiction. Writing about psychopaths in film, academic Wayne Wilson explicitly likens Söze to Satan and assigns to him demonic motives. Wilson states that Söze allows himself to be caught just to prove his superiority over the police; this compromises his ultimate goal of anonymity, but Söze cannot resist the urge to show off and create mischief. In &quot;The Journal of Nietzsche Studies&quot;, Lewis Call states that Söze&#x27;s mythological status draws the ire of the authoritarian government agents because he &quot;represents a terrifying truth: that power is ephemeral, and has no basis in reality.&quot; According to Call, Söze&#x27;s intermediaries – the &quot;usual suspects&quot; themselves – are more useful to the police, as they represent an easily controlled and intimidated criminal underworld, in direct contrast to Söze himself.

Hanna M. Roisman likens Kint to Odysseus, capable of adapting both his personality and his tales to his current audience. Throughout his tale, Kint adapts his confession to Kujan&#x27;s revealed biases. Roisman draws direct parallels to Odysseus&#x27; tales to the Phaeacians: like Odysseus, Kint allows his audience to define him and his narrative. Appealing to Kujan&#x27;s arrogance, Kint allows himself to be outwitted, humiliated, and broken by his interrogator; Kint further invents a mythical villain that he credulously believes in and gives Kujan the privileged perspective of the skeptic. Kint thus creates a neo-noir thriller inside of a neo-noir thriller and demonstrates the artificiality of storytelling. Benjamin Widiss identifies post-structural elements to the film, such as the lack of a clear protagonist throughout much of the film. This extends to ambiguity over Kint&#x27;s role as author or reader, and whether he is Kint pretending to be Söze or the reverse.

Söze was also subject to detailed fan analysis and debate. Fans contacted Singer personally and quizzed him on explanations for the film&#x27;s complicated plot. Fan theories about Söze&#x27;s identity became a popular topic on Internet forums. After the film&#x27;s festival premiere, the ambiguity of Söze&#x27;s identity and how to pronounce his name were used in the film&#x27;s marketing. Pronunciation had previously been an issue for distributor Gramercy Pictures, who used, &quot;Who is Keyser Söze?&quot; to demonstrate both proper pronunciation and stoke speculation. The ad campaign was later highlighted by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; as &quot;question of the year&quot; for 1995.

== In popular culture ==
Since the release of the film, the name &quot;Keyser Söze&quot; has become synonymous with a feared, elusive person nobody has met. In June 2001, &quot;Time&quot; referred to Osama bin Laden as &quot;a geopolitical Keyser Söze, an omnipresent menace whose very name invokes perils far beyond his capability&quot;. 

In his 1999 review of &quot;Fight Club&quot;, which was generally negative, film critic Roger Ebert commented, &quot;A lot of recent films seem unsatisfied unless they can add final scenes that redefine the reality of everything that has gone before; call it the Keyser Söze syndrome.&quot; 

The restaurant Moe&#x27;s Southwest Grill features a salsa named &quot;Who is Kaiser Salsa?&quot; 

=== Television ===
In season 01 episode 09 of Netflix series &quot;Cobra Kai&quot;, main character Samantha Larusso, while grounded, asks Robbie Keen “Did you just pull a Keyser Söze?” After Robbie successfully manipulated Samantha&#x27;s mom into letting her leave the house to drive him home.

During episode six of the first season of &quot;Billions&quot;, the character &quot;Dollar&quot; Bill Stearn invokes Keyser Söze&#x27;s name when metaphorically &quot;murdering&quot; his own family. 

In the third season of the American comedy fantasy show &quot;The Good Place&quot;, main character Eleanor Shellstrop talks about her mother, saying “When the time comes, she will rip this guy off and disappear like Keyser Söze—right after he admitted to groping all those people,” making a veiled reference to the sexual misconduct allegations against Kevin Spacey. 

In the second season of the Irish comedy &quot;Derry Girls&quot;, which is set in the 1990s, several characters go to see &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;. The theater gets evacuated before the film ends, and Ma Mary obsesses about finding out who Keyser Söze is. 
In the episode &quot;The Puppet Show&quot; of the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, a character asks, &quot;Does anyone else feel like they&#x27;ve been Keyser Söze&#x27;d?&quot;, referring to a sense of having been definitively manipulated and outmaneuvered. 
In Season 10, episode 3 of &quot;NCIS&quot;, Tony DiNozzo asks the killer, when they confront him, &quot;Did you Keyser Söze us?&quot;

In the fifth season (2009) of House episode eleven, in relation to House&#x27;s attempt to mock his team, in a confrontation with Wilson, House quotes Keyser Söze: &quot;Why don&#x27;t you hang out in the video store and tell everyone Kevin Spacey&#x27;s is Keyser Söze. And by the way, that ending really made no sense at all.&quot;

In the fourth season of HBO Max&#x27;s &quot;Veep&quot; (Ep. 9 - Testimony) Dan Egan was being deposed by Congress and began to compare and liken Gary Walsh (President Selina Meyer&#x27;s bagman) to Keyser Söze. Amid the comparison, Egan asked to clarify if the parties taking the testimony had seen &quot;Usual Suspects&quot;. The parties had not seen &quot;Usual Suspects&quot;, and Dan gave up on the metaphor as it would have been lost and he would have spoiled the great film.

=== Music ===
At the end of his verse on &quot;I Shot Ya (Remix),&quot; released in 1995, Fat Joe refers to himself with the alias Keyser Söze; in the last line, he raps &quot;Bullets be blazing through these streets filled with torture/Joey Crack, a.k.a. Keyser Söze.&quot; 

In 1996, punk band Link 80 used the character as the basis of the opening song (titled &quot;Verbal Kint&quot;) on their debut album &quot;17 Reasons&quot;.

In his 2020 song &quot;Darkness&quot;, which heavily references the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas, Eminem compares the shooter to Keyser Söze in the line &quot;Scopes for sniper vision, surprise from out of nowhere as I slide the clip in from inside the hotel leanin&#x27; out the window, going Keyser Söze. Finger on the trigger, but I&#x27;m a licensed owner, with no prior convictions, so law says sky&#x27;s the limit so my supply&#x27;s infinite, strapped like I&#x27;m a soldier.&quot;

In the 2013 remix of I&#x27;ll Be Gone, Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park refers to himself as Keyser Söze in the line &quot;Enjoy it now because after long, Keyser Söze, I&#x27;ll be gone.&quot;

Lord Infamous, of Memphis rap group Three 6 Mafia, often took on the nickname and alter-ego “Keyser Soze” in the years following the release of the film.

In their 1999 Song &quot;Take The Long Way Home&quot; of The Bloodhound Gang they refer to Keyser Söze in the line &quot;Make it up as you go Keyser Söze&quot;.

<doc id="1011379" wikidata="Q1047485" url="?curid=1011379" title="Multilevel security">
<text>Multilevel security or multiple levels of security (MLS) is the application of a computer system to process information with incompatible classifications (i.e., at different security levels), permit access by users with different security clearances and needs-to-know, and prevent users from obtaining access to information for which they lack authorization.

There are two contexts for the use of multilevel security. One context is to refer to a system that is adequate to protect itself from subversion and has robust mechanisms to separate information domains, that is, trustworthy. Another context is to refer to an application of a computer that will require the computer to be strong enough to protect itself from subversion, and have adequate mechanisms to separate information domains, that is, a system we must trust. This distinction is important because systems that need to be trusted are not necessarily trustworthy.

==Trusted operating systems==
An MLS operating environment often requires a highly trustworthy information processing system often built on an MLS operating system (OS), but not necessarily. Most MLS functionality can be supported by a system composed entirely from untrusted computers, although it requires multiple independent computers linked by hardware security-compliant channels (see section B.6.2 of the Trusted Network Interpretation, NCSC-TG-005). An example of hardware enforced MLS is &quot;asymmetric isolation&quot;. If one computer is being used in MLS mode, then that computer must use a trusted operating system. Because all information in an MLS environment is physically accessible by the OS, strong logical controls must exist to ensure that access to information is strictly controlled. Typically this involves mandatory access control that uses security labels, like the Bell–LaPadula model.

Customers that deploy trusted operating systems typically require that the product complete a formal computer security evaluation. The evaluation is stricter for a broader security range, which are the lowest and highest classification levels the system can process. The Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) was the first evaluation criteria developed to assess MLS in computer systems. Under that criteria there was a clear uniform mapping between the security requirements and the breadth of the MLS security range. Historically few implementations have been certified capable of MLS processing with a security range of Unclassified through Top Secret. Among them were Honeywell&#x27;s SCOMP, USAF SACDIN, NSA&#x27;s Blacker, and Boeing&#x27;s MLS LAN, all under TCSEC, 1980s vintage and Intel 80386-based. Currently, MLS products are evaluated under the Common Criteria. In late 2008, the first operating system (more below) was certified to a high evaluated assurance level: Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) - EAL 6+ / High Robustness, under the auspices of a U.S. government program requiring multilevel security in a high threat environment. While this assurance level has many similarities to that of the old Orange Book A1 (such as formal methods), the functional requirements focus on fundamental isolation and information flow policies rather than higher level policies such as Bell-La Padula. Because the Common Criteria decoupled TCSEC&#x27;s pairing of assurance (EAL) and functionality (Protection Profile), the clear uniform mapping between security requirements and MLS security range capability documented in CSC-STD-004-85 has largely been lost when the Common Criteria superseded the Rainbow Series.

Freely available operating systems with some features that support MLS include Linux with the Security-Enhanced Linux feature enabled and FreeBSD. Security evaluation was once thought to be a problem for these free MLS implementations for three reasons:

# It is always very difficult to implement kernel self-protection strategy with the precision needed for MLS trust, and these examples were not designed to or certified to an MLS protection profile so they may not offer the self-protection needed to support MLS.
# Aside from EAL levels, the Common Criteria lacks an inventory of appropriate high assurance protection profiles that specify the robustness needed to operate in MLS mode.
# Even if (1) and (2) were met, the evaluation process is very costly and imposes special restrictions on configuration control of the evaluated software.

Notwithstanding such suppositions, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 was certified against LSPP, RBACPP, and CAPP at EAL4+ in June 2007. It uses Security-Enhanced Linux to implement MLS and was the first Common Criteria certification to enforce TOE security properties with Security-Enhanced Linux.

Vendor certification strategies can be misleading to laypersons. A common strategy exploits the layperson&#x27;s overemphasis of EAL level with over-certification, such as certifying an EAL 3 protection profile (like CAPP) to elevated levels, like EAL 4 or EAL 5. Another is adding and certifying MLS support features (such as role-based access control protection profile (RBACPP) and labeled security protection profile (LSPP)) to a kernel that is not evaluated to an MLS-capable protection profile. Those types of features are services run on the kernel and depend on the kernel to protect them from corruption and subversion. If the kernel is not evaluated to an MLS-capable protection profile, MLS features cannot be trusted regardless of how impressive the demonstration looks. It is particularly noteworthy that CAPP is specifically &quot;not&quot; an MLS-capable profile as it specifically excludes self-protection capabilities critical for MLS.

General Dynamics offers PitBull, a trusted, MLS operating system. PitBull is currently offered only as an enhanced version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, but earlier versions existed for Sun Microsystems Solaris, IBM AIX, and SVR4 Unix. PitBull provides a Bell LaPadula security mechanism, a Biba integrity mechanism, a privilege replacement for superuser, and many other features.
PitBull has the security base for General Dynamics&#x27; Trusted Network Environment (TNE) product since 2009. TNE enables Multilevel information sharing and access for users in the Department of Defense and Intelligence communities operating a varying classification levels. It&#x27;s also the foundation for the Multilevel coalition sharing environment, the Battlefield Information Collection and Exploitation Systems Extended (BICES-X).

Sun Microsystems, now Oracle Corporation, offers Solaris Trusted Extensions as an integrated feature of the commercial OSs Solaris and OpenSolaris. In addition to the controlled access protection profile (CAPP), and role-based access control (RBAC) protection profiles, Trusted Extensions have also been certified at EAL4 to the labeled security protection profile (LSPP). The security target includes both desktop and network functionality. LSPP mandates that users are not authorized to override the labeling policies enforced by the kernel and X Window System (X11 server). The evaluation does not include a covert channel analysis. Because these certifications depend on CAPP, no Common Criteria certifications suggest this product is trustworthy for MLS.

BAE Systems offers XTS-400, a commercial system that supports MLS at what the vendor claims is &quot;high assurance&quot;. Predecessor products (including the XTS-300) were evaluated at the TCSEC B3 level, which is MLS-capable. The XTS-400 has been evaluated under the Common Criteria at EAL5+ against the CAPP and LSPP protection profiles. CAPP and LSPP are both EAL3 protection profiles that are not inherently MLS-capable, but the security target for the Common Criteria evaluation of this product contains an enriched set of security functions that provide MLS capability.

==Problem areas==
Sanitization is a problem area for MLS systems. Systems that implement MLS restrictions, like those defined by Bell–LaPadula model, only allow sharing when it obviously does not violate security restrictions. Users with lower clearances can easily share their work with users holding higher clearances, but not vice versa. There is no efficient, reliable mechanism by which a Top Secret user can edit a Top Secret file, remove all Top Secret information, and then deliver it to users with Secret or lower clearances. In practice, MLS systems circumvent this problem via privileged functions that allow a trustworthy user to bypass the MLS mechanism and change a file&#x27;s security classification. However, the technique is not reliable.

Covert channels pose another problem for MLS systems. For an MLS system to keep secrets perfectly, there must be &quot;no possible way&quot; for a Top Secret process to transmit signals of any kind to a Secret or lower process. This includes side effects such as changes in available memory or disk space, or changes in process timing. When a process exploits such a side effect to transmit data, it is exploiting a covert channel. It is extremely difficult to close all covert channels in a practical computing system, and it may be impossible in practice. The process of identifying all covert channels is a challenging one by itself. Most commercially available MLS systems do not attempt to close all covert channels, even though this makes it impractical to use them in high security applications.

Bypass is problematic when introduced as a means to treat a system high object as if it were MLS trusted. A common example is to extract data from a secret system high object to be sent to an unclassified destination, citing some property of the data as trusted evidence that it is &#x27;really&#x27; unclassified (e.g. &#x27;strict&#x27; format). A system high system cannot be trusted to preserve any trusted evidence, and the result is that an overt data path is opened with no logical way to securely mediate it. Bypass can be risky because, unlike narrow bandwidth covert channels that are difficult to exploit, bypass can present a large, easily exploitable overt leak in the system. Bypass often arises out of failure to use trusted operating environments to maintain continuous separation of security domains all the way back to their origin. When that origin lies outside the system boundary, it may not be possible to validate the trusted separation to the origin. In that case, the risk of bypass can be unavoidable if the flow truly is essential.

A common example of unavoidable bypass is a subject system that is required to accept secret IP packets from an untrusted source, encrypt the secret userdata and not the header and deposit the result to an untrusted network. The source lies outside the sphere of influence of the subject system. Although the source is untrusted (e.g. system high) it is being trusted as if it were MLS because it provides packets that have unclassified headers and secret plaintext userdata, an MLS data construct. Since the source is untrusted, it could be corrupt and place secrets in the unclassified packet header. The corrupted packet headers could be nonsense but it is impossible for the subject system to determine that with any reasonable reliability. The packet userdata is cryptographically well protected but the packet header can contain readable secrets. If the corrupted packets are passed to an untrusted network by the subject system they may not be routable but some cooperating corrupt process in the network could grab the packets and acknowledge them and the subject system may not detect the leak. This can be a large overt leak that is hard to detect. Viewing classified packets with unclassified headers as system high structures instead of the MLS structures they really are presents a very common but serious threat.

Most bypass is avoidable. Avoidable bypass often results when system architects design a system before correctly considering security, then attempt to apply security after the fact as add-on functions. In that situation, bypass appears to be the only (easy) way to make the system work. Some pseudo-secure schemes are proposed (and approved!) that examine the contents of the bypassed data in a vain attempt to establish that bypassed data contains no secrets. This is not possible without trusting something about the data such as its format, which is contrary to the assumption that the source is not trusted to preserve any characteristics of the source data. Assured &quot;secure bypass&quot; is a myth, just as a so-called High Assurance Guard (HAG) that transparently implements bypass. The risk these introduce has long been acknowledged; extant solutions are ultimately procedural, rather than technical. There is no way to know with certainty how much classified information is taken from our systems by exploitation of bypass.

==Debate: &quot;There is no such thing as MLS&quot;==
Some laypersons are designing secure computing systems and drawing the conclusion that MLS does not exist.
An explanation could be that there is a decline in COMPUSEC experts and the MLS term has been overloaded by two different meanings / uses. These two uses are: MLS as a processing environment vs MLS as a capability. The belief that MLS is non-existent is based on the belief that there are no products certified to operate in an MLS &quot;environment&quot; or mode and that therefore MLS as a &quot;capability&quot; does not exist. One does not imply the other. Many systems operate in an environment containing data that has unequal security levels and therefore is MLS by the Computer Security Intermediate Value Theorem (CS-IVT). The consequence of this confusion runs deeper. NSA-certified MLS operating systems, databases, and networks have existed in operational mode since the 1970s and that MLS products are continuing to be built, marketed, and deployed.

Laypersons often conclude that to admit that a system operates in an MLS environment (environment-centric meaning of MLS) is to be backed into the &quot;perceived&quot; corner of having a problem with no MLS solution (capability-centric meaning of MLS). MLS is deceptively complex and just because simple solutions are not obvious does not justify a conclusion that they do not exist. This can lead to a crippling ignorance about COMPUSEC that manifests itself as whispers that &quot;one cannot talk about MLS,&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s no such thing as MLS.&quot; These MLS-denial schemes change so rapidly that they cannot be addressed. Instead, it is important to clarify the distinction between MLS-environment and MLS-capable.

* MLS as a security environment or &quot;security mode&quot;: A community whose users have differing security clearances may perceive MLS as a data sharing capability: users can share information with recipients whose clearance allows receipt of that information. A system is operating in MLS Mode when it has (or could have) connectivity to a destination that is cleared to a lower security level than any of the data the MLS system contains. This is formalized in the CS-IVT. Determination of security mode of a system depends entirely on the system&#x27;s security environment; the classification of data it contains, the clearance of those who can get direct or indirect access to the system or its outputs or signals, and the system&#x27;s connectivity and ports to other systems. Security mode is independent of capabilities, although a system should not be operated in a mode for which it is not worthy of trust.
* MLS as a &quot;capability&quot;: Developers of products or systems intended to allow MLS data sharing tend to loosely perceive it in terms of a capability to enforce data-sharing restrictions or a security policy, like mechanisms that enforce the Bell–LaPadula model. A system is MLS-capable if it can be shown to robustly implement a security policy.

The original use of the term MLS applied to the security environment, or mode. One solution to this confusion is to retain the original definition of MLS and be specific about MLS-capable when that context is used.

==MILS architecture==
&quot;Multiple Independent Levels of Security&quot; (MILS) is an architecture that addresses the domain separation component of MLS. Note that UCDMO (the US government lead for cross domain and multilevel systems) created a term Cross Domain Access as a category in its baseline of DoD and Intelligence Community accredited systems, and this category can be seen as essentially analogous to MILS.

Security models such as the Biba model (for integrity) and the Bell–LaPadula model (for confidentiality) allow one-way flow between certain security domains that are otherwise assumed to be isolated. MILS addresses the isolation underlying MLS without addressing the controlled interaction between the domains addressed by the above models. Trusted security-compliant channels mentioned above can link MILS domains to support more MLS functionality.

The MILS approach pursues a strategy characterized by an older term, MSL (&quot;multiple single level&quot;), that isolates each level of information within its own single-level environment (System High).

The rigid process communication and isolation offered by MILS may be more useful to ultra high reliability software applications than MLS. MILS notably does not address the hierarchical structure that is embodied by the notion of security levels. This requires the addition of specific import/export applications between domains each of which needs to be accredited appropriately. As such, MILS might be better called Multiple Independent Domains of Security (MLS emulation on MILS would require a similar set of accredited applications for the MLS applications). By declining to address out of the box interaction among levels consistent with the hierarchical relations of Bell-La Padula, MILS is (almost deceptively) simple to implement initially but needs non-trivial supplementary import/export applications to achieve the richness and flexibility expected by practical MLS applications.

Any MILS/MLS comparison should consider if the accreditation of a set of simpler export applications is more achievable than accreditation of one, more complex MLS kernel. This question depends in part on the extent of the import/export interactions that the stakeholders require. In favour of MILS is the possibility that not all the export applications will require maximal assurance.

==MSL systems==
There is another way of solving such problems known as multiple single-level. Each security level is isolated in a separate untrusted domain. The absence of a medium of communication between the domains assures no interaction is possible. The mechanism for this isolation is usually physical separation in separate computers. This is often used to support applications or operating systems which have no possibility of supporting MLS such as Microsoft Windows.

==Applications==
Infrastructure such as trusted operating systems are an important component of MLS systems, but in order to fulfill the criteria required under the definition of MLS by CNSSI 4009 (paraphrased at the start of this article), the system must provide a user interface that is capable of allowing a user to access and process content at multiple classification levels from one system. The UCDMO ran a track specifically focused on MLS at the NSA Information Assurance Symposium in 2009, in which it highlighted several accredited (in production) and emergent MLS systems. Note the use of MLS in SELinux.

There are several databases classified as MLS systems. Oracle has a product named Oracle Label Security (OLS) that implements mandatory access controls - typically by adding a &#x27;label&#x27; column to each table in an Oracle database. OLS is being deployed at the US Army INSCOM as the foundation of an &quot;all-source&quot; intelligence database spanning the JWICS and SIPRNet networks. There is a project to create a labeled version of PostgreSQL, and there are also older labeled-database implementations such as Trusted Rubix. These MLS database systems provide a unified back-end system for content spanning multiple labels, but they do not resolve the challenge of having users process content at multiple security levels in one system while enforcing mandatory access controls.

There are also several MLS end-user applications. The other MLS capability currently on the UCDMO baseline is called MLChat , and it is a chat server that runs on the XTS-400 operating system - it was created by the US Naval Research Laboratory. Given that content from users at different domains passes through the MLChat server, dirty-word scanning is employed to protect classified content, and there has been some debate about if this is truly an MLS system or more a form of cross-domain transfer data guard. Mandatory access controls are maintained by a combination of XTS-400 and application-specific mechanisms.

Joint Cross Domain eXchange (JCDX) is another example of an MLS capability currently on the UCDMO baseline. JCDX is the only Department of Defense (DoD), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) accredited Multilevel Security (MLS) Command, Control, Communication, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) system that provides near real-time intelligence and warning support to theater and forward deployed tactical commanders. The JCDX architecture is comprehensively integrated with a high assurance Protection Level Four (PL4) secure operating system, utilizing data labeling to disseminate near real-time data information on force activities and potential terrorist threats on and around the world&#x27;s oceans. It is installed at locations in United States and Allied partner countries where it is capable of providing data from Top Secret/SCI down to Secret-Releasable levels, all on a single platform.

MLS applications not currently part of the UCDMO baseline include several applications from BlueSpace. BlueSpace has several MLS applications, including an MLS email client, an MLS search application and an MLS C2 system. BlueSpace uses a middleware strategy to enable its applications to be platform neutral, orchestrating one user interface across multiple Windows OS instances (virtualized or remote terminal sessions). The US Naval Research Laboratory has also implemented a multilevel web application framework called MLWeb which integrates the Ruby on Rails framework with a multilevel database based on SQLite3.

==Trends==
Perhaps the greatest change going on in the multilevel security arena today is the convergence of MLS with virtualization. An increasing number of trusted operating systems are moving away from labeling files and processes, and are instead moving towards UNIX containers or virtual machines. Examples include zones in Solaris 10 TX, and the padded cell hypervisor in systems such as Green Hill&#x27;s Integrity platform, and XenClient XT from Citrix. The High Assurance Platform from NSA as implemented in General Dynamics&#x27; Trusted Virtualization Environment (TVE) is another example - it uses SELinux at its core, and can support MLS applications that span multiple domains.

<text>John Wesley Shipp (born January 22, 1955) is an American actor known for his various television roles. He played the lead Barry Allen on CBS&#x27;s superhero series &quot;The Flash&quot; from 1990 to 1991, and Mitch Leery, the title character&#x27;s father, on the drama series &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; from 1998 to 2001. Shipp has also played several roles in daytime soap operas including Kelly Nelson on &quot;Guiding Light&quot; from 1980 to 1984, and Douglas Cummings on &quot;As the World Turns&quot; from 1985 to 1986 (which earned him his first Daytime Emmy Award). He portrayed Barry Allen&#x27;s father Henry, Earth-3 Flash Jay Garrick, and Earth-90&#x27;s Barry Allen / The Flash on the CW&#x27;s &quot;The Flash&quot; series.

==Early life==
Shipp was born in Norfolk, Virginia. His father was a farmer who returned to school when Shipp was young, and after attending the seminary in Wake Forest, North Carolina, he became the pastor of a small church outside Wake Forest. Shipp later gave a keynote speech to the graduating class of Wake Forest Rolesville High School Class of 1999 to recount the tale of his father&#x27;s attempts to integrate the community in the late 1960s.

Shipp attended Butler High School in Louisville, Kentucky and then attended Indiana University.

==Career==
Shipp began his career with a regular role on the daytime soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, playing Dr. Kelly Nelson from 1980 to 1984. Shipp followed this with more roles in daytime, playing Douglas Cummings on &quot;As the World Turns&quot; from 1985 to 1986 (which earned him his first Daytime Emmy Award in 1986), and Martin Ellis on &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; in 1987 (for which he won his second Daytime Emmy Award), followed by Blanchard Lovelace on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; in 1989, and Carter Jones on &quot;All My Children&quot; in 1992. He also had guest appearances on primetime series, such as playing a peeper on an episode of &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; in 1983.
Shipp won the title role of Barry Allen/The Flash on the CBS series &quot;The Flash&quot;, which aired in the 1990–91 season. He followed this with the recurring role of Lucky on the NBC series &quot;Sisters&quot; from 1994 to 1995. Shipp also appeared on stage in the 1990s, starring in Erik Jendresen&#x27;s &quot;The Killing of Michael Malloy&quot; in 1993. In 1998, he was cast as Mitch Leery, the father of the lead character Dawson, on The WB drama series &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;; Shipp remained part of the series&#x27; main cast through its first four seasons, exiting in 2001.

In November 2010, Shipp returned to daytime in the short-term role of villainous Eddie Ford on &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, who was killed off in a murder mystery in mid-December. In the summer of 2011, he guest-starred on the Lifetime series &quot;Drop Dead Diva&quot;, playing the ex-husband of the character played by comedian Kathy Griffin. Shipp filmed three episodes of the MTV series &quot;Teen Wolf&quot; as the abusive father of Daniel Sharman&#x27;s character, which aired during the summer of 2012. Also in 2012, he starred in the independent film &quot;Hell and Mr. Fudge&quot;, with Mackenzie Astin and Eileen Davidson.

Shipp returned to involvement with The Flash in the 2010s. He was cast in a &quot;mysterious&quot; role on The CW series &quot;The Flash&quot; in early 2014, which was later revealed to be the recurring role of Henry Allen, Barry&#x27;s father. In the second-season finale of &quot;The Flash&quot;, Shipp played Jay Garrick, an alternate universe counterpart of The Flash, and, later, as his earlier incarnation of Barry Allen. He also guest starred as Eobard Thawne, Barry&#x27;s archenemy, in the animated series &quot;&quot;.

In 2015, Shipp also began lending his voice to the unique role of Sheriff Burns on the podcast drama &quot;Powder Burns&quot;. It ran from 2015 to 2018, and was written and produced by David A. Gregory, and was recognized by the Voice Arts Awards and the Audio Verse Awards.

Shipp returned to the stage in 2016 as Juror #8 in Judson Theatre Company&#x27;s production of &quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot;. He also performed the same role in a 2017 reading of the play at Brookfield Theatre for the Arts.

<text>KTVQ (channel 2) is a television station in Billings, Montana, United States, affiliated with CBS. Owned by the E. W. Scripps Company, it is part of the Montana Television Network, a statewide network of CBS-affiliated stations. KTVQ&#x27;s studios are located on Third Avenue North in Billings, and its transmitter is located on Sacrifice Cliff southeast of downtown.

Channel 2 began broadcasting as KOOK-TV on November 9, 1953. It was the first station in Billings and the third in the state of Montana, built by radio station KOOK; it was a CBS affiliate from the outset. The Montana Network, the original owner, sold the KOOK stations to Joe Sample in 1956, and they moved into the present KTVQ studios in 1959. Sample&#x27;s acquisitions of KXLF-TV in Butte 1961 and KRTV in Great Falls in 1969 formed the basis of the Montana Television Network; KOOK radio was sold off in 1973, and channel 2 changed its call sign to KTVQ.

While the network was nominally headquartered in Billings, the network&#x27;s split regional news format used Great Falls as a hub. As a result of the newscast style implemented by Sample, channel 2 sank in the local news ratings against the all-local newscasts on competitor KULR-TV. Coinciding with Sample&#x27;s sale of the MTN stations to SJL, Inc., in 1984, the network newscasts shifted to Billings and were eventually phased out altogether. In 1987, KTVQ overtook KULR-TV in local news ratings and became the dominant station in the market.

==History==
The Montana Network, owner of radio station KOOK (970 AM), applied on December 13, 1952, for a construction permit to build a new TV station on channel 2 in Billings, which was granted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on February 4, 1953. The turnaround time was short considering that Robert S. Howard, who owned Scripps-associated radio and newspaper holdings in Utah and Idaho, had also applied for channel 2, but his firm dropped its bid and cleared the way for The Montana Network. KOOK had already revealed it had held an option for two years to build a transmitter site on Coburn Hill. Ground was broken on the studio and transmitter facilities there in early June, and programming from KOOK-TV began on November 9, 1953. It was the third station in the state: Butte&#x27;s KXLF-TV had begun in August, and a second station, KOPR-TV, had started there at about the same time. KOOK-TV was affiliated with CBS, ABC and the DuMont Television Network at launch.

In December 1956, Joseph Sample acquired majority control of KOOK radio and television from its previous ownership, headed by Charles L. Crist, a state representative. A year later, KOOK broke ground on a new radio and television center in downtown Billings, which was completed in 1959; three homes were moved off the property before construction began. By the time the building was completed, a second television station, KGHL-TV (channel 8, now KULR-TV), had begun in 1958.

Sample later expanded his holdings across the state. In 1961, he acquired KXLF in Butte; in 1969, he purchased KRTV in Great Falls, giving his Garryowen Broadcasting coverage of half the state&#x27;s population. The Montana Television Network was formed that same year from these stations and KPAX-TV in Missoula, which was built in 1970. In 1972, seeking to get ahead of a proposed FCC rule that would have barred radio-television cross-ownership, Sample sold KOOK radio; the call letters were retained by the radio station, and the television station changed its call sign to KTVQ on September 1, 1972. The new designation was chosen because the station had exhausted its preferred options, it was available, &quot;Q2&quot; (which became the station&#x27;s moniker) was a branding option, and due to a since-repealed FCC regulation prohibiting TV and radio stations in the same market, but with different ownership, from sharing the same call signs.

In 1968, channel 2 picked up a secondary affiliation with NBC after KULR opted to take a primary affiliation with ABC. The two stations shared NBC programming, though KTVQ retained right of first refusal. In 1979, for instance, KTVQ aired 17 CBS prime time shows and 10 from NBC; ABC shows were all seen on KULR, which rounded out its schedule with five additional shows not cleared by KTVQ. In 1980, KTVQ became a primary CBS affiliate. KOUS (channel 4) launched late that year and immediately took all NBC programming that KTVQ did not clear; NBC fare aired by KTVQ at the time included &quot;The Today Show&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, and several prime time shows, and some of these programs lasted on channel 2 until KTVQ&#x27;s NBC affiliation contract ended in 1982 and KOUS-TV became the NBC affiliate.

After nearly 27 years owning KTVQ and feeling &quot;burned out&quot; with television, Sample sold the Montana Television Network in 1983 to SJL Broadcasting. Evening Post Industries (through its Cordillera Communications subsidiary) bought KTVQ in 1994 for $8.5 million; this reunited the station with the rest of MTN, which Evening Post had purchased in 1986. Scripps closed on its purchase of the Cordillera broadcast properties, including MTN, in 2019.

==News operation==
In 1971, MTN instituted a hybrid local-regional newscast format. The network news was presented from Great Falls, as that was the only place that could receive feeds from all of the MTN stations at the same time; the Billings, Butte, and (from 1977) Missoula stations presented local news inserts into the statewide program. However, in Billings, KTVQ had long been the second-place news finisher behind KULR-TV.

One of Sample&#x27;s last acts as owner of MTN, at the same time he sold the network to Lilly, was to move production of MTN News from Great Falls to Billings in hopes that it would improve MTN&#x27;s laggard position in the Billings news ratings. Ed Coghlan, who had been the lead anchor from Great Falls, was replaced by Dean Phillips. The order of the newscast was changed to put the local inserts first, and MTN&#x27;s long-running &quot;Today in Montana&quot;—which also originated in Great Falls—added news and weather segments aired from Billings. Despite the use of longer interview segments and in-depth reports, Phillips&#x27;s style was often seen as too big-city for Montanans; Vic Bracht of &quot;The Billings Gazette&quot; cited an &quot;arrogance factor&quot; that became known even to people who did not watch MTN. Phillips was replaced by Gus Koernig, and the station&#x27;s ratings immediately improved. In February 1987, both Arbitron and Nielsen found KTVQ to be beating KULR-TV in all time slots. By 1997, KTVQ enjoyed a two-to-one ratings advantage over its competitor for its early evening newscast.

In 1995, President Bill Clinton visited Billings and KTVQ, where he conducted a televised town hall meeting.

In 1990, KTVQ&#x27;s newscasts began to be seen on KXGN-TV (channel 5) in Glendive when that station joined MTN.

<doc id="1011417" wikidata="Q1393223" url="?curid=1011417" title="Fairfield (Lake District)">
<text>Fairfield is a fell in the English Lake District. It is the highest of a group of hills in the Eastern Fells, standing to the south of the Helvellyn range.

==Topography==
There is a marked contrast between the character of the northern and southern flanks of Fairfield. Alfred Wainwright in his influential &quot;Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells&quot; wrote that &quot;From the south it appears as a great horseshoe of grassy slopes below a consistently high skyline...but lacking those dramatic qualities that appeal most to the lover of hills. But on the north side the Fairfield range is magnificent: here are dark precipices, long fans of scree...desolate combes and deep valleys.&quot;

Fairfield has connecting ridges to several other fells and in plan view can be likened to a bow-tie. The top has an east–west axis with ridges running out north and south from each end.

The two southern arms make up the popular walk, the Fairfield horseshoe, which starts in Ambleside and makes a circuit of the valley of Rydale to the south. On the western side, descending from Fairfield are Great Rigg, Heron Pike and Nab Scar while the eastern ridge bears the tops of Hart Crag, Dove Crag, High Pike and Low Pike.

The north-western ridge of Fairfield crosses Deepdale Hause to St Sunday Crag whilst that to the north east is a short rocky spur into Deepdale, dropping over Greenhow End. A fifth line of high ground, less a ridge than a salient in the breast of the fell, runs due west to Seat Sandal across Grisedale Hause.

The northern and eastern faces all loom above the desolate upper Deepdale, which is divided by Greenhow End. This short rocky spur has Hutaple Crag on the west and Scrubby Crag on the east. The corries of Cawk Cove and Link Cove lie on either side, each with a steep headwall formed by the flanks of Fairfield.

==Grisedale Tarn==
North-west of Fairfield is Grisedale Tarn at around . This sizeable tarn has a depth of over and holds brown trout, perch and eels. It is also the legendary resting place of the crown of Dunmail, following his—perhaps equally legendary—defeat in battle at Dunmail Raise. The outflow is to Ullswater, to the north-east along the strath of Grisedale. The south western flank of Fairfield looks down on Tongue Gill, a feeder of Raise Beck and Grasmere.

==Geology==
The volcaniclastic sandstone and lapilli [tuff of the Deepdale Formation overlie the dacitic lapilli tuff of the Helvellyn Formation.

==Summit==
The summit is a rough stony plateau with the high point at the western end above the brink of Cawk Cove. The top is very flat and there are many cairns, including a pair of large windbreaks near the high point.

Guidebook writers warn that it is easy to get lost in mist and that the cautious walker should beware of the presence of precipices to the north and west. The vista is fine, with all of the major fell groups well seen and views down into the abyss of Deepdale only yards away.

Other fells visible at close hand include Helvellyn (with its spectacular arête Striding Edge), Nethermost Pike, Saint Sunday Crag and Cofa Pike (a subsidiary summit of Fairfield).

The view south towards Ambleside and Rydal over Rydal Head is also extensive, with Windermere and Coniston Water in view.

==Ascents==
Fairfield is most commonly climbed as the high point of the Fairfield horseshoe, a walk which has no agreed direction of travel. Coming from Great Rigg, the long grassy ridge heads directly for the summit, whilst the walker arriving from Hart Crag climbs up from Link Hause with a fine view of Scrubby Crag to the right, before the stony traverse of Fairfield summit.

Perhaps the finest indirect ascent is from Patterdale via Birks and St Sunday Crag, following the fine narrow ridge down to Deepdale Hause before ascending rough ground to Cofa Pike. This subsidiary top of Fairfield has a fine peaked profile, quite outdoing its parent until the wide tabletop comes into view behind. A further rock tor is surmounted before the summit windbreaks are reached. From St Sunday Crag onwards the northern crags of Fairfield are seen in their full and wild glory.

Fairfield can be climbed via Grisedale Hause, either up Tongue Gill from Grasmere, from Dunmail Raise or from Patterdale. The path up from the Hause is a rough zigzag up worsening scree. Grisedale Hause can also be reached as a ridge walk from Seat Sandal, or by cutting across the outlet of Grisedale Tarn from Dollywaggon Pike and the Helvellyns. In this way Fairfield forms part of the Threlkeld–Kirkstone Walk, which continues over Fairfield summit to Dove Crag and Red Screes.

A more challenging route climbs out of Deepdale, veering into the lower part of Link Cove before surmounting Greenhow End and The Step. Deepdale Hause can also be gained from this side, but climbs direct out of Link Cove or Cowk Cove are not practicable for walkers.

<text>The Faroe Islands national football team (, ) represents the Faroe Islands in men&#x27;s international football, and is governed by the Faroe Islands Football Association (FSF). The FSF became a member of FIFA in 1988 and UEFA in 1990 and represents the fourth-smallest UEFA country by population.

The team has never advanced to the finals of the FIFA World Cup or UEFA European Championship. They took part in the Island Games in 1989 and 1991 and won both tournaments. The team also took part in the Nordic Football Championship for the first time in 2000–01, the last time the competition was played. In 2024, they made their debut in the Baltic Cup as a guest entrant and placed fourth. In the Faroe Islands, the team is known as the &quot;landsliðið&quot;. Home matches are played at Tórsvøllur.

==History==

===Early years (1930–1988)===
From 1930 to 1988 before joining FIFA, the Faroe Islands gameplay was limited to national friendly matches against Iceland, Shetland, Orkney Islands, Greenland and Denmark U-21. None of these matches was sanctioned by FIFA, nor the Faroe Islands Football Association.

The Faroe Islands tied Iceland for the most successful team at the friendly Greenland Cup tournament with two wins back-to-back in 1983 and 1984.

===International membership and the miracle of Landskrona (1988–1993)===

The FSF gained FIFA membership on 2 July 1988 and the team&#x27;s first official victory was a 1–0 win in a friendly match against Canada the next year. The next year, the FSF joined the UEFA on 18 April 1990.

The Faroe Islands participated in two Island Games, winning both tournaments in 1989 and 1991. They never entered the tournament again, as the opponent teams were considered too weak a match for the Faroese side.

The Faroe Islands made football history on 12 September 1990 when they beat Austria 1–0 in their first-ever competitive international. The game, a Euro 92 qualifier, was played in Landskrona, Sweden because there were no grass pitches on the Faroe Islands at the time. Torkil Nielsen—a chess player and salesman for his local building company—scored the lone game-winning goal. 32-year-old national coach Páll Guðlaugsson became a folk hero overnight and is today remembered by his players as a fearless character who believed, against the odds, that the Faroe Islands could get a result against their bigger nation opponents. In his autobiography, national goalkeeper Jens Martin Knudsen revealed that Guðlaugsson gave a stirring pre-match speech that boosted the team&#x27;s confidence prior to the match against the Austrians. Guðlaugsson told the players, &quot;Think of the Faroese flag. Your flag. Take it with you on that field. Throw yourself into the tackles against those arrogant Austrians with one mission—to win the game for your nation. Tonight you pay back your childhood home. You have the opportunity now and it is an irreparable blow if you don&#x27;t seize it!&quot; The team&#x27;s underdog win remains the story most often retold about Faroese football and sports in the Faroe Islands. The Faroese victory was rated number 10 of all-time football greatest upsets by American sports magazine Soccerphile.

One month later, the Faroe Islands lost 4–1 to Denmark at Parken, Copenhagen. The same team got another good result in the qualifying tournament on 1 May 1991, when they drew 1–1 against Northern Ireland at Windsor Park. However, the Faroe Islands subsequently lost the remaining five matches of the tournament.

===The Allan Simonsen years (1994–2001)===
Since Landskrona, Faroese football continued its upward trajectory, regularly getting good results against stronger teams. However, it was a surprise to many around Europe when—in 1994—Allan Simonsen was appointed the new coach for the Faroese national team. Many thought that after a shining playing career at Borussia Mönchengladbach and F.C. Barcelona, the European footballer of the year in 1977 was too big a name for such a small nation. Allan Simonsen spent seven years at the team&#x27;s helm and is remembered as the coach who lifted the Faroese amateurs to a more professional level of play.

As a coach, he asked the FSF to lengthen the season and the Faroese clubs to screen players for talent. Both requests were granted and have become an essential part of the Faroese national team&#x27;s success at the highest level of the sport.

Under the guidance of Allan Simonsen, the Faroe Islands won two Euro 1996 qualifiers matches against San Marino 3–0 and 3–1. Two years later, in the 1998 World Cup Qualifiers, the team won two 2–1 matches against Malta. In the Euro 2000 qualifiers, they played three draws—Lithuania 0–0, Scotland 1–1, and Bosnia 2–2. In 2002, the team played a 2–2 draw against Slovenia for their most successful 2002 World Cup Qualifying matches until 2018.

===The Henrik Larsen years (2002–2005)===
When looking for a new coach, it was important for the Football Association to secure a well-known and respected name in Europe. They found that in former Danish international and UEFA Euro 1992-winning player, Henrik Larsen, who succeeded his countryman Allan Simonsen as head coach of the Faroe Islands national team.

On 7 September 2002, in the first match with Larsen as a coach, an experienced Faroese team played Scotland at home in a Euro 2004 qualifier. Though the Faroe Islands led Scotland 2–0 at halftime, the game ended in a 2–2 draw.

In the same qualifying tournament on 16 October 2002 at the HDI-Arena in Hannover, the Faroe Islands were close to a big upset against Germany. Unfortunately for the Faroese, the post denied them a draw in the dying seconds of the match, and the game ended 2–1 for the German side. However, the Faroe Islands managed one more draw against Cyprus on 9 October 2004 in the 2006 World Cup Qualifying match.

===The Jógvan Martin Olsen years (2006–2008)===
In 2006, the Faroe Islands finally got their first Faroese coach in Jógvan Martin Olsen from Toftir, who had served as an assistant coach for the Faroese national team for nine years prior to his appointment. That same year, many experienced players who had been regulars on the national squad for years retired from the team, giving Olsen&#x27;s the task of building a new squad with a new generation of players. The team&#x27;s turnover and inexperience affected their results, and the Faroe Islands got zero points in the Euro 2008 qualifier, their first qualification match under Olsen as head coach.

However, in the 2 June 2007 game against Italy, the Faroes netted a 77th-minute goal and surprisingly took the sluggish world champions to the limit after a 2–1 loss. Overall, the Euro 2008 qualifying campaign was disastrous for the young team, as they conceded 43 goals and scored only four (all of which were scored by the same player, Rógvi Jacobsen), and half of which were against Italy en route to losing all twelve matches, of which three of were 6–0 defeats.

During the summer of 2008, the Faroese side played two friendlies. In the 4–3 loss to Estonia on 1 June 2008, and the team is credited with their only official international match in which they scored 3 goals but lost. Later they lost 5–0 to Portugal.

Olsen remained as a coach for the first four qualification matches in the 2010 World Cup Qualifiers. After announcing the squad against the Austrian national team, Olsen announced that he was stepping down after three years in charge. Before this departure, he finally managed to get a big result with the team on 11 October 2008 against Austria. The game ended 1–1, giving the Faroe Islands their first qualifying point in four years.

===The Brian Kerr years and the new generation (2009–2011)===
On 22 March 2009, the Faroese people got a glimpse of their future national team—a new generation of more technical and peaceful players— when they beat the Icelandic national team 2–1 in a friendly match, their first-ever victory over Iceland. Caretaker Heðin Askham managed the Faroese side in this match.

On 5 April 2009, former Republic of Ireland manager Brian Kerr was appointed as head coach of the team. With his charisma and Irish humour, he soon became a favourite among the Faroese football fans.

On 9 September 2009, the Faroe Islands recorded their first competitive win since the 2002 World Cup qualification stage, beating Lithuania 2–1.

On 11 August 2010, the Faroe Islands came close to an away win against Estonia during the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifiers. The Faroes took the lead in the first half with a goal by Jóan Símun Edmundsson, but Estonia managed to turn the match around with two goals in stoppage time.

Two months later, on 12 October 2010, the Faroe Islands drew 1–1 against higher-ranked Northern Ireland at Svangaskarð Stadion, Toftir. Midfielder Christian Holst scored for the Faroes in the 60th minute before Kyle Lafferty equalised 16 minutes later, earning a point for both teams.

On 7 June 2011, the Faroe Islands defeated Estonia 2–0 at Svangaskarð. Captain Fróði Benjaminsen opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the 43rd minute before Arnbjørn Hansen secured the win with a follow-up after another Benjaminsen penalty. It was the Faroe Islands&#x27; first UEFA Euro qualification win since 1995.

The Faroe Islands were drawn against Kerr&#x27;s former employers, the Republic of Ireland, in Group C for the 2014 World Cup Qualifying. The other teams in the group were Germany, Sweden, Austria, and Kazakhstan.

The players liked the Irishman and they described him as a very motivating figure. His pre-match speeches were full of passion and gave the players confidence to go out and play against the very best in Europe. However, on 26 October 2011, the Faroe Islands Football Association (FSF) announced that &quot;it was not possible to agree on a new contract with Brian Kerr&quot;. Brian Kerr stepped down as coach after unsuccessful negotiations with the FSF.

===The Lars Olsen years and double Greek victory (2011–2019)===

On 8 November 2011, the Faroese Football Association announced that an agreement had been reached with the 50-year-old former Denmark captain and European Champion from 1992, Lars Olsen, to become the next coach of the Faroe Islands and the third Dane at the helm, after Allan Simonsen and Henrik Larsen.

On 1 March 2014, for the first time in the Faroe Islands&#x27; history, the team scored four goals in a match. In what was only Gibraltar&#x27;s second match as an official UEFA member, the hosts lost their first-ever home match by the score of 1–4. Faroe midfielder Christian Holst scored twice. On 11 October 2013, Olsen got his first point as the Faroe Islands head coach in a 1–1 draw against Kazakhstan.

On 25 September 2014, Faroese football lost one of its most promising football players, when 22-year-old Gunnar Zachariasen died in a tragic accident on board a Greenlandic fishing trawler, which had docked in Tórshavn in order to unload its cargo. The accident happened when a EUR-pallet stacked with frozen fish fell on top of Gunnar Zachariasen who died instantly. According to Rúni Nolsøe, Zachariasen&#x27;s coach at EB/Streymur, Faroese football had lost a very good football player. He played 11 caps and scored 4 goals for the U21 Faroe Islands team.

On 14 November 2014, the Faroe Islands caused a major international football upset by defeating host Greece 0–1 during the Euro 2016 qualifiers. The Guardian reckoned the win as the biggest upset ever in terms of FIFA Rankings; Greece were ranked 18th, the Faroe Islands 187th, a 169-place difference.

On 13 June 2015, the Faroe Islands stunned the world yet again by defeating the same Greek side in their second meeting of the Euro 2016 qualifying tournament by a score of 2–1. These two wins saw the national team moving from 187th place to 74th place in the FIFA rankings. The team eventually finished fifth in their group with six points, without conceding more than three goals in a match.

On 29 March 2016, the Faroe Islands beat Liechtenstein 3–2 in a friendly match in Marbella, Spain. The opposition scored two late goals in stoppage time, but this was the Faroe Islands&#x27; fourth victory over Liechtenstein since 2000.

On 6 September 2016, the Faroe Islands draw 0–0 against Hungary in a 2018 World Cup Qualifying match at Tórsvøllur.

On 10 October 2016, the Faroe Islands defeated Latvia 2–0 in a 2018 World Cup Qualifying match.

On 3 September 2017, the Faroe Islands defeated Andorra 1–0 in a 2018 World Cup Qualifying match on home soil, beating their own record which was 7 points in a Euro or World Cup qualification; after the victory over Andorra the Faroe Islands reached a record nine points in all competitions.

On 18 November 2019, Lars Olsen led his team to a 0–3 loss against Sweden, in his last international match as the manager for the Faroe Islands. He&#x27;s regarded as the most successful manager in the nation&#x27;s 29-year history, as members of UEFA and FIFA. In the same match, captain Atli Gregersen retired from international duties as well, after winning 59 caps for the national team.

===The Håkan Ericson years (2019–2024)===
On 16 December 2019, the Faroe Islands Football Association announced they had signed a four-year deal with Swedish coach Håkan Ericson.

On 3 September 2020, in what would be his first match in charge, Håkan Ericson&#x27;s side won 3–2 against Malta in a 2020-21 UEFA Nations League match. Only three days later, in what would be the 200th competitive match for Faroe Islands since joining FIFA and UEFA back in 1988, they recorded their second win in a row with a 1–0 win over Andorra, their first double victory since a 2–1 win against Malta on 8 June 1997.

On 17 November 2020, Ericson&#x27;s side won their first-ever competitive tournament, after a 1–1 draw against Malta secured them the top spot and promotion from the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League D, followed by a new record of 12 points in all competitions, beating the previous 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA) record at 9 points.

On 7 June 2021, the Faroese national team recorded their biggest win ever in a 5–1 friendly against Liechtenstein in Tórshavn.

On 26 September 2022, the Faroese national team defied all odds when beating Turkey 2–1 in the last game of the 2022–23 UEFA Nations League campaign. The win pushed their unbeaten record to four games, the longest streak in their history, and the result was arguably their best since the Greek Double victories of 2014 and 2015 respectively, although unlike the double Greek victories, the win against Turkey proved meaningless as Turkey has already won promotion earlier.

As of 26 September 2022, the Faroese national team has thirteen full-time professionals playing in Belgian, Norwegian, Danish, Swedish and Icelandic leagues, compared to the 1990 team who won the Austria game in Landskrona, which was entirely made up of amateurs.

The Faroe Islands played in the 2024 Baltic Cup and on 8 June 2024, they lost their semi-final match 4–1 against Estonia. They then lost 1–0 in the third place playoff against Latvia on 11 June. Ericson was fired on October 16, 2024; Eyðun Klakstein currently serves as interim manager. During Ericson&#x27;s time as manager, the Faroe Islands were able to secure points in almost half of the matches played, which makes him the most successful manager in the nation&#x27;s history. In Klakstein&#x27;s first 2 matches as manager, the Faroes beat Armenia 1-0 and lost 1-0 to North Macedonia, securing their spot in the Nations League C for another season. Klakstein was named permanent manager on February 5, 2025, making him the first Faroese manager of the team since Jógvan Martin Olsen. 

==Stadiums==

Between 1999 and 2011, the Faroe Islands rotated its home matches between two different stadiums, Tórsvøllur and Svangaskarð. Their latest match in Svangaskarð was a 2–0 victory in a UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying match against Estonia on 7 June 2011.

Tórsvøllur has since undergone comprehensive renovation, transforming it into a multifunctional venue for concerts and sports in general, although it is primarily used for football. Floodlights were introduced in 2011, and 6,000 new seats were installed, all under roof. The stadium has been resurfaced with artificial grass and now meets all UEFA and FIFA demands.

Work on Tórsvøllur was completed in 2021.

==Supporters==

Faroe Islands have a main stand for their supporters at Tórsvøllur, which is known as &quot;Skansin&quot;, meaning &quot;fort&quot; in English. Skansin was formed in 2014, following their 1–0 away victory against Greece in Pireaus and the opening of their newly renovated stadium.

As of September 2021, Skansin has 600 members domestically, and stand tickets are sold out every home match. Following Northern Ireland&#x27;s 3–1 victory against Faroe Islands during the Euro 2016 qualifiers on 4 September 2015, Northern Ireland forward Kyle Lafferty stated that he was particularly impressed with the Faroese supporters, as they cheered for their players throughout the entire match, even when the Faroes threw away a likely 1–1 result.

Drums, trumpets and folksongs are an essential part of their support.

<text>Lister or Lyster is an English occupational surname, and may refer to a textile dyer, from the Middle English word &quot;litster&quot;, meaning to dye. It dates back to the 13th century in Scotland with the recording of Aleyn le Littester of Edinburghshire who rendered homage to the Interregnum government in 1296, and to the 14th century in England (Richard le Lyster appears in the Subsidy Tax Rolls of Derbyshire in 1327).

The name probably comes from the Old Norse verb &#x27;lita&#x27;, meaning &#x27;to dye&#x27; and rendered as &#x27;lystare&#x27; in English. The noun for &#x27;dyer&#x27; was &#x27;litster&#x27; (Scottish), &#x27;lit(t)e&#x27; (middle English), or &#x27;lister&#x27; (English). The word was also associated with a &#x27;salmon spear&#x27;, rendered &#x27;lyster&#x27; (Danish) or &#x27;lister&#x27; (English). A 1533 Act of Parliament stated, &quot;No person shall take in any crele, raw web, lister... the young fry of salmon.&quot;

The name took hold in areas of England in the 16th century known for the woollen industry, mainly Yorkshire, but also Lancashire, Lincolnshire and Norfolk.

The name came to Ireland following the Cromwellian campaign of 1649, and took root in County Laois, rendered by the English as Queen&#x27;s County.

==Spelling variants==
The name&#x27;s spellings include Lister (English and Scottish), Lyster (Irish), Lester, Lestor (English), McInlester, McLeister, Laister, Litster (Scottish), Lidster (Scottish), and the rare Ledgister and Ledster (Scottish).

Eswyn Lyster notes that, &quot;It is often said that &#x27;Lister&#x27; is the English name, while &#x27;Lyster&#x27; is Irish, but both spellings are found in Ireland, often in the same family. In England &#x27;Lyster&#x27; is seldom seen (save) to someone whose ancestors moved to Ireland and then returned. In Scotland the spelling (Fife County) is &#x27;Litster&#x27; and &#x27;Lidster&#x27;, and tends to become &#x27;Lister&#x27; in modern times&#x27;.&quot;

Whereas both &#x27;Lister&#x27; and &#x27;Lyster&#x27; rhyme with &#x27;mister&#x27;, in some areas of western Canada &#x27;Lyster&#x27; is rendered as if spelt &#x27;Lester&#x27;.

==Coat of arms and crest==

There is no official registry that recognizes a Lister/Lyster coat of arms, but Listers of Yorkshire-descent use the one granted to John Lyster de Derby. It is a shield divided horizontally in three, the middle being black with three large white five-pointed stars. Six small staggered crosses with bell-bottomed bases are on the white strip at the top, and seven are on the bottom.

The crest which appears atop the coat of arms is a dagger impaling a laurel wreath, from Carlow Ireland (Queen&#x27;s County). This is listed in Fairburn&#x27;s Crests, designated &quot;LYSTER, Ire.&quot;

The family motto is variously &#x27;Retinens vestigia famae&#x27; (Following in the footsteps of fame), or &#x27;Facta, non verba&#x27; (Deeds, not words).

<text>The Soo Line Railroad is one of the primary United States railroad subsidiaries for the CPKC Railway , one of six U.S. Class I railroads, controlled through the Soo Line Corporation. Although it is named for the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railroad (MStP&amp;SSM), which was commonly known as the Soo Line after the phonetic spelling of Sault, it was formed in 1961 by the consolidation of that company with two other CPKC subsidiaries: The Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railway, and the Wisconsin Central Railway. It is also the successor to other Class I railroads, including the Minneapolis, Northfield and Southern Railway (acquired 1982) and the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (Milwaukee Road, acquired at bankruptcy in 1985). On the other hand, a large amount of mileage was spun off in 1987 to Wisconsin Central Ltd., now part of the Canadian National Railway. The Soo Line Railroad and the Delaware and Hudson Railway, CPKC&#x27;s other major subsidiary (before the 2008 DM&amp;E acquisition), presently do business as the Canadian Pacific Railway (CP). Most equipment has been repainted into the CP scheme, but the U.S. Surface Transportation Board groups all of the company&#x27;s U.S. subsidiaries under the Soo Line name for reporting purposes. The Minneapolis headquarters are in the Canadian Pacific Plaza building, having moved from the nearby Soo Line Building.

== System description ==

The company&#x27;s main line begins at Portal, North Dakota, on the Canada–U.S. border, and extends southeast along former MStP&amp;SSM trackage to the Twin Cities (Minneapolis–Saint Paul). Ex-Milwaukee Road trackage takes the Soo Line from the Twin Cities to Chicago via Milwaukee. Between Chicago and Detroit, where the CPKC-owned Detroit River Tunnel connects back into Canada, the Soo Line has trackage rights over the Norfolk Southern Railway and haulage rights over CSX Transportation.

Major branches include a connection from the border at Noyes, Minnesota, to Glenwood and, until it was sold to the Indiana Rail Road in 1983, a line from Chicago to Louisville, Kentucky.

Through trackage rights over the BNSF Railway, the Soo Line also serves Duluth from the Twin Cities.

At the end of 1970, the Soo Line operated of road on of track; that year it reported 8,249 million ton-miles of revenue freight and no passengers.

== History ==

The present Soo Line Railroad was incorporated in Minnesota on October 19, 1949, as the Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railroad, as part of the plan for reorganizing the Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railway (DSA) and subsidiary Mineral Range Railroad. When CP consolidated several subsidiaries on January 1, 1961, it used this company to merge the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railroad and the Wisconsin Central Railway into, and renamed it to the present name, the Soo Line Railroad. The Soo Line gained control of the Minneapolis, Northfield and Southern Railway (MNS), a Twin Cities–area shortline railroad, in June 1982.

Passenger service was mostly eliminated by the 1961 merger, but several trains remained for a few more years. These were a Saint Paul to Duluth daytime train known only as Trains 62 and 63 (discontinued June 1961), the overnight Chicago to Duluth &quot;Laker&quot; and its Saint Paul connection (both discontinued January 15, 1965), the Twin Cities to Winnipeg &quot;Winnipeger&quot; (discontinued March 25, 1967), and the Saint Paul to Portal &quot;Soo-Dominion&quot; that, during the summer, ran through to Vancouver via a connection with Canadian Pacific&#x27;s &quot;The Dominion&quot; at Moose Jaw. It was discontinued in December 1963, and the western Canada cars were handled on the &quot;Winnipeger&quot; for two more summers before they too were pulled. The Soo Line&#x27;s last passenger train was the &quot;Copper Country Limited&quot;, a joint service with the Milwaukee Road inherited from the Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic. This Chicago-Champion-Calumet service was discontinued May 8, 1968. In addition, there were several mixed trains, with additional ones created to enable the discontinuance of the Saint Paul to Portal passenger train. Some mixed train services gained notoriety because passengers were conveyed in one direction only.

In 1984, CP incorporated the Soo Line Corporation in Minnesota as a holding company, exchanging stock in December to give the Soo Line Corporation total control over the railroad. Two months later, on February 19, 1985, the Soo Line purchased the property of the bankrupt Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad and assigned it to a newly created subsidiary, The Milwaukee Road, Inc. This company and the MN&amp;S were both merged into the Soo Line Railroad effective January 1, 1986. To cut costs, the Soo Line created the Lake States Transportation Division (LSTD) on February 10, 1986 to operate the less-important lines, including the ex-Wisconsin Central line between Chicago and the Twin Cities. Unable to implement its proposed labor rule changes, the Soo Line sold the approximately LSTD to a new regional railroad, Wisconsin Central Ltd., in 1987 for $133 million. (The WC folded into the Canadian National Railway in 2001). In 1990, CP gained full control of the Soo Line Corporation, of which it had previously owned about 56% of the common stock. In the 2000s, the Soo line was consolidated into CP.

== Named passenger trains ==
The railroad ran several long distance named trains. 
* &quot;Laker,&quot; Minneapolis, Minnesota – Duluth, Minnesota – Ashland, Wisconsin
* &quot;Soo-Dominion,&quot; Chicago, Illinois – Vancouver, British Columbia
* &quot;Winnipeger,&quot; Saint Paul, Minnesota – Winnipeg, Manitoba

== Presidents ==
The Presidents of the Soo Line Railroad were:
* Leonard H. Murray, 1961–1978, previously President of the Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railway
* Thomas M. Beckley, 1978–1983
* Dennis Miles Cavanaugh, 1983–1986, 1987–1989
* Robert C. Gilmore, 1986–1987
* Edwin V. Dodge, 1989–1996

== Remaining locomotives ==

=== Preserved ===
Some of the railroad&#x27;s diesel locomotives have been preserved: 
* 500, an EMD FP7A, on display in Ladysmith, Wisconsin.
* 700, an EMD GP30, at the Lake Superior Railroad Museum in Duluth, Minnesota. Restored for use on their North Shore Scenic Railroad.
* 703, an EMD GP30, and 991, a Barney and Smith heavyweight passenger car, at the Colfax Railroad Museum in Colfax, Wisconsin.
* 715, an EMD GP30, at the National Railroad Museum in Ashwaubenon, Wisconsin, although it wears a Wisconsin Central Ltd. paint scheme.
* 2500, an EMD FP7A, at the Lake Superior Railroad Museum in Duluth. Also restored for use on their North Shore Scenic Railroad.
In addition, a number of the railroad&#x27;s 145 steel cabooses have been preserved along with soo line 4402 which (as of 2025) has returned to active duty 

== Rail trails ==
* The Soo Line Trail in Minnesota was created from former pieces of the railroad which has extended down into the Lake Wobegon Trail. The trails are enjoyed by walkers, runners, and bikers in the area, and are prized for how flat they are.
* The &quot;Copper Country Limited&quot; railroad lines in Michigan&#x27;s Keweenaw Peninsula, along with former lines owned by the Copper Range Railroad, have been turned into ATV trails. Some, like the Jack Stevens Hancock-Calumet Trail, are multi-purpose and are enjoyably used by hikers and bikers year-round.
* The Wolf River State Trail was created on a section of the Soo Line’s Shawano Subdivision. Tracks were removed in 2001 by Wisconsin Central between Shawano and Crandon, and a segment from White Lake to Crandon later became the Wolf River State Trail. It is open to ATVs, snowmobiles, hikers and horseback riders.

<text>Screamers is a 1995 science fiction horror film starring Peter Weller, Roy Dupuis, and Jennifer Rubin, and directed by Christian Duguay. The screenplay, written by Dan O&#x27;Bannon with a rewrite by Miguel Tejada-Flores, is based on Philip K. Dick&#x27;s 1953 short story &quot;Second Variety&quot;, and addresses themes commonly found in that author&#x27;s work: societal conflict, confusion of reality and illusion, and machines turning upon their creators. The film received generally negative response from critics at the time of its release. A sequel &quot;&quot;, was released in 2009, to mixed reviews.

==Plot==

In the year 2078, the planet Sirius 6B, once a thriving mining hub, has been reduced to a toxic wasteland by a war between the mining company the New Economic Block (N.E.B.) and &quot;The Alliance&quot;, a group of former mining and science personnel. After miners discovered that their mining had released toxic gases, they went on strike, and the N.E.B. hired mercenaries as strike breakers. Five years into the war, Alliance scientists created and deployed Autonomous Mobile Swords (AMS) — artificially intelligent self-replicating machines that hunt down and kill N.E.B. soldiers. Nicknamed &quot;Screamers&quot; after their signature high-pitched noise, they are efficient at killing any target with a heartbeat, so Alliance soldiers wear &quot;tabs&quot; that disguise their heartbeats, thus rendering them invisible to the machines. A fragile stalemate is in effect between the two exhausted, poorly-supplied, and undermanned armies.

An N.E.B. soldier carrying a message to the Alliance compound is killed by screamers. The message guarantees safe passage through N.E.B. territory to discuss a truce. Alliance commanding officer Joe Hendricksson reports this development to his Earth-based superiors, but is told to disregard it as peace negotiations are already underway on Earth. However, Private &quot;Ace&quot; Jefferson, newly arrived from Earth, refutes this claim. Hendricksson is not surprised; he has long suspected that both sides have simply written off Sirius 6B and abandoned their armies.

Deciding the truce offer is the only chance of survival for himself and his soldiers, Hendricksson sets out for a meeting with the N.E.B. commander, accompanied by Jefferson. While traveling through a ruined city they come upon David, a young boy clutching a teddy bear. Unwilling to abandon a defenseless civilian, they bring him along. The following night they are attacked by a never-before-seen reptilian screamer. Hendricksson is alarmed that their Alliance tabs did not protect them.

As the group nears the N.E.B. compound, two enemy soldiers, Becker and Ross, open fire on David, who explodes in a shower of bolts and gears. The soldiers explain to the shocked Alliance men that David was a new &quot;type 3&quot; screamer impersonating a human. Most of the N.E.B. contingent has been wiped out by another &quot;David&quot; screamer that a patrol unwittingly brought into the base; Becker, Ross, and a black marketeer named Jessica are the only survivors.

The group heads to the N.E.B. command center but finds only an empty building and pools of blood. Locating the mainframe computer, Hendricksson learns that the N.E.B. truce offer was just as false as the Alliance message from Earth. The group retreats to the N.E.B. bunker, pursued by &quot;Davids&quot;. They discover that the screamers have &quot;evolved&quot; new versions on their own that are indistinguishable from humans and immune to Alliance tabs. Becker becomes convinced that Ross is a screamer and kills him, only to discover that he was human. The four survivors retreat to the Alliance base, only to find that it had been taken over by &quot;Davids&quot;. As dozens of &quot;Davids&quot; pour out of the bunker&#x27;s entrance, Hendricksson fires a micro-nuclear missile into the bunker, wiping them out. Jefferson rushes to help Becker, who was apparently injured in the blast, but Becker is revealed to be a &quot;type 2&quot; screamer and kills Jefferson. After Hendricksson destroys Becker, only he and Jessica remain. Worrying that Jessica could be a screamer, Hendricksson cuts her hand and is relieved to see blood.

The pair locate an emergency escape shuttle, but discover it can carry only one person. Hendricksson offers the shuttle to Jessica but a second &quot;Jessica&quot; arrives, confirming that she is an even more human-like type of screamer. Hendricksson resigns himself to death, but to his surprise, Jessica shields him, battles her lookalike, and is killed. Just as the second “Jessica” begins screaming to kill Hendricksson, the spacecraft&#x27;s engines kick on and destroy her. With her last breath, the original Jessica confesses her love for Hendricksson, who departs for Earth with the teddy bear carried by the original &quot;David.&quot; As the screen fades to black, the bear slowly begins to move.

==Production==
&quot;Screamers&quot; was stuck in development hell for over a decade before finally being produced. Screenwriter Dan O&#x27;Bannon had completed his adaptation of Dick&#x27;s short story &quot;Second Variety&quot; in 1981 (along with his adaptation of another of Dick&#x27;s short stories, &quot;We Can Remember It For You Wholesale&quot;, which became the 1990 film &quot;Total Recall&quot;). By 1983, O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s screenplay for &quot;Screamers&quot; had been optioned by Tom Naud (SFX designer on the 1981 film &quot;Outland&quot;). However, the production never went ahead as planned. At various times, Charles Fries showed interest in the project, but it was not until the 1990s that &quot;Screamers&quot; went into production. By this time the screenplay had been rewritten by Miguel Tejada-Flores. O&#x27;Bannon was unaware that the film had been made until after its release, when his agent called him to notify him of his screenwriting credit for the film. According to O&#x27;Bannon, they had kept much of the plot and characters from his original script the same while changing much of the dialogue.

The film, directed by Christian Duguay, was made in Canada. Locations included a quarry in Quebec, in Montreal&#x27;s Olympic Stadium, as well as Joliette.

==Release==
It premiered at the 1995 Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 1995. It was released in the United States on January 26, 1996, by Columbia Pictures.

==Reception==

===Critical response ===
The film holds a 29% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 35 reviews.

James Berardinelli gave the film a positive review, awarding it a rating of three stars (out of four). Berardinelli said that the film &quot;oozes atmosphere&quot; and &quot;underlines an important truth: you don&#x27;t need a big budget or big-name stars to make this sort of motion picture succeed.&quot;
Joe Bob Briggs also reacted positively, calling &quot;Screamers&quot; &quot;a pretty dang decent [movie]&quot; and saying, &quot;I loved it. ... Three and a half stars.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars (out of four), remarking that it was &quot;made with a certain imagination and intelligence,&quot; &quot;the dialogue is often effective,&quot; and &quot;what makes the film somewhat intriguing is its &quot;Blade Runner&quot;-like ambiguity: who is, and who isn&#x27;t, a human being.&quot;

&quot;Time Out New York Film Guide&quot; criticized director Christian Duguay&#x27;s &quot;flashy, aimless direction&quot;, saying that the movie &quot;lacks the intelligence to follow through its grim premise&quot;, but added that the film &quot;does offer many ... guilty pleasures&quot; and &quot;the design and effects teams have lent scale and impact to the futuristic locations and sets.&quot;

&quot;The Science Fiction, Horror, and Fantasy Film Review&quot; gave &quot;Screamers&quot; three stars out of four, calling it a &quot;two-thirds excellent and intelligent science-fiction film&quot; that &quot;builds towards a climax that never arrives ... After an impressive build-up, the film blows its third act and falls into cliches.&quot;
&quot;Popcorn Pictures&quot; gave the film two and a half stars out of four, writing: &quot;&quot;Screamers&quot; isn&#x27;t terrible. The scenes inside the refinery are creepy enough with them stalking and being stalked by the Screamers. But the intro and finale are terrible ways to start and end a film respectively. There was a good film waiting to come out here, it&#x27;s a shame only half of it did.&quot;

Rob Blackwelder of &quot;SplicedWire&quot; said, &quot;&quot;Screamers&quot; is inundated with movie clichés, stock characters, stolen premises and scenes that just don&#x27;t make sense.&quot;
&quot;Beyond Hollywood&quot; wrote, &quot;One of the biggest problems with &quot;Screamers&quot; is the near absence of a likeable character, or at least someone who we actually give a damn about escaping those slice-and-dice robots. ... There&#x27;s no doubt &quot;Screamers&quot; could have been a lot better than it is. The whole sequence at the refinery is the best of the movie, managing to elicit both a couple of scare scenes and a lot of creepiness. The rest, unfortunately, doesn&#x27;t live up to that middle section.&quot;

===Box office===
The film earned about $5.7 million in the United States and Canada, on a $20 million budget. It was moderately popular in France, Japan, and the Netherlands. Worldwide box office was approximately $7 million.

==Awards==
==Sequel==

&quot;&quot;, directed by Sheldon Wilson and starring Gina Holden, Jana Pallaske, Greg Bryk, Stephen Amell and Lance Henriksen, was released straight to DVD in 2009.

The sequel is set several years after the events of the original film. Hendricksson died when he deliberately allowed his escape shuttle to burn up in the atmosphere during reentry to Earth. The official determination is that he committed suicide due to post-traumatic stress; but it is strongly implied that he actually did it to prevent the &quot;teddy bear&quot; screamer on board from reaching Earth. Meanwhile, an SOS signal arrives from Sirius 6B. A contingent of seven soldiers, including Hendricksson&#x27;s daughter Victoria Bronte (Holden), is dispatched to the war torn mining planet to investigate. The film features all of the screamers from the original film, as well as a sleeker, longer, and more serpentine screamer with cutting mandibles for a mouth.

As with &quot;Screamers&quot;, critical reaction to &quot;Screamers: The Hunting&quot; was mixed. David Johnson of &quot;DVD Verdict&quot; wrote that &quot;the visual effects were surprisingly effective&quot; and &quot;[p]ractical effects impress as well&quot;, but added, &quot;Unfortunately ... the script defaults to a clichéd finale, and a predictable—though well-executed—final twist ending.&quot; He concluded, &quot;I had a pretty decent time with [&quot;Screamers: The Hunting&quot;] ... [I]f you&#x27;re hankering for a serving of effective sci-fi B-movie shenanigans, you could do a lot worse.&quot;
Scott Foy of Dread Central wrote, &quot;They&#x27;ve basically recycled the first film but dumbed it and dulled it down considerably, doing away with the paranoia and sense of desolation that gave the original some spark in favor of logic gaps and tedious predictability. ... The best that can be said ... is that most of the production values and make-up effects are top notch for a direct-to-DVD production. Too bad they didn&#x27;t put as much work into crafting the screenplay.&quot;
