<text>Nikolay Nikolayevich Beketov (; , Alferovka (now Beketovka), Penza Governorate, Russian Empire – , St. Petersburg, Russian Empire) was a Russian Imperial physical chemist and metallurgist.

He was the father of a well-known Russian architect Alexei Beketov.

==Life and work==

In 1849 Beketov graduated from Kazan University and worked with Nikolay Zinin.

In 1855 he became a junior scientific assistant in the Department of Chemistry at Kharkov University.

In 1859-1887 Beketov was a professor at the same university.

In 1865 he defended his PhD thesis on &quot;Research into the phenomenon of displacement of one element by another&quot; (&quot;&quot;).

In 1886 Beketov moved to Saint Petersburg, where he worked at the academic chemical laboratory and taught at the University for Women.In 1890 Beketov delivered lectures on the &quot;Basics of Thermochemistry&quot; at Moscow State University.
Beketov discovered displacement of metals from solutions of their salts by hydrogen under pressure. He also established that magnesium and zinc displaced other metals from their salts under high temperatures.

In 1859-1865 Beketov proved that aluminum restored metals from their oxides under high temperatures. Later on, Beketov&#x27;s experiments served as a starting point for aluminothermy. 

Beketov&#x27;s biggest merit was his contribution into physical chemistry as an independent science. In 1860 he taught a course on &quot;Relations between physical and chemical phenomena&quot; in Kharkov and a course on &quot;Physical Chemistry&quot; in 1865.

In 1864 a Physical Chemistry Department in Kharkov University was established with his active participation, where students would conduct research and do practical 
work.

In 1886 Beketov was elected a full member of the Petersburg Academy of Sciences.

Beketov&#x27;s students were Alexander Eltekov, Flavian Flavitsky and others. The poet Alexander Blok was his brother&#x27;s grandson.

<text>William Gerard Hamilton (28 January 172916 July 1796), was an English statesman and Irish politician, popularly known as &quot;Single Speech Hamilton&quot;.

==Biography==
He was born in London, the son of William Hamilton, a Scottish bencher of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, and succeeded his father in 1754. He was educated at Winchester, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn and Oriel College, Oxford. With his father&#x27;s fortune he entered political life and became Member of Parliament for Petersfield in Hampshire. His maiden speech, delivered on 13 November 1755, during the debate on the address, which excited Horace Walpole&#x27;s admiration, is generally supposed to have been his only effort in the House of Commons. But the nickname &quot;Single Speech&quot; is undoubtedly misleading, and Hamilton is known to have spoken with success on other occasions, both in the House of Commons and in the Irish parliament.

===Political offices===
In 1756 he was appointed one of the commissioners for trade and plantations, and in 1761 he became chief secretary to Lord Halifax, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, as well as MP of the Irish House of Commons for Killybegs (until 1768) and English MP for Pontefract.

He was appointed Irish Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1763, and subsequently filled various other administrative offices. Hamilton was thought very highly of by Samuel Johnson, and it is certain that he was strongly opposed to the British taxation of America. He was close to the Prince Regent, serving as a trusted adviser. In 1784 he exchanged his office as Chancellor of the Exchequer for a pension of £2,000 p.a. Hamilton had held the office for over 20 years, although had treated the role as a largely ceremonial position. He was succeeded by John Foster, who went on to bring in changes credited with greatly boosting the rural Irish economy.

===Ill health and death===
He suffered from a severe paralytic stroke in the winter of 1791–92. This had not been his first, and by August 1792 he remained in a poor state. On 4 March 1793 he received a leave of absence from the House of Commons due to his ill health. He died in London on 16 July 1796, and was buried in the chancel vault of St Martins-in-the-Fields. His death came &quot;just in time to save him from absolute poverty.&quot; He was unmarried.

Two of his speeches in the Irish House of Commons, and some other miscellaneous works—including previously unpublished notes on the Corn Laws by Johnson—were published by Edmond Malone after his death under the title &quot;Parliamentary Logick&quot;.

<doc id="1030215" wikidata="Q3658690" url="?curid=1030215" title="Fauchard">
<text>A fauchard is a type of polearm which was used in Europe from the 11th through the 17th centuries.
In later use fauchards became ornamental and ceremonial (&quot;fauchard de parade&quot;), growing in size until some examples were almost too heavy to carry, let alone use. 
The design consisted of a curved blade atop a long pole, although in some portrayals, it is shown on a shorter pole. The blade bore a moderate to strong curve along its length. The cutting edge was only on the side of the blade, unlike the guisarme or bill. The fauchard was likely developed from the war scythe (and is from the scythe (falx) family in general) with the cutting edge turned opposite, convex instead of concave, so that the weapon was good for both thrusting and slashing attacks.

Pole arms developed from relatively few early tools (axe, scythe/wide-bladed knife, and the pruning hook) and the spear. Thus naming, particularly of early forms, is difficult. Fauchard, as a name, is from early French and may have been used to describe various arms. The sovnya may have been a localized term for the same medieval weapon. In later historical text, the terms glaive (possibly Welsh) and fauchard are used to describe the same weapons. Over time, the form evolved and elements from other pole-arms were included in the fauchard, such as prongs to parry weapons and hook armor, complicating naming further. Some historians use only the classification &quot;glaive&quot; or &quot;fauchard&quot; and ignore the other entirely. 

The form of contemporary Asian pole arms (the Japanese naginata and the Chinese guan dao for example) has led to speculation that one could have influenced the other as regional trade brought the cultures together.

From the &quot;Dictionnaire Encyclopédique Larousse&quot; (1898): Fauchard:
A large iron &quot;hand weapon&quot; (vs. throwing weapon) with the form of a bill, the back, which is opposite to the longest curve, is straight or concave, while the cutting edge is convex. The fauchard differs from the guisarme by the direction of its edge and its point, generally projected in the rear, and of the war scythe by the dimension and the nature of the curves. The very old fauchards generally carry on their backs horizontal bumps or hooks directed from top to bottom and used to pull people by the projections of their armor. The length of the shaft varied between 8 and 12 feet, that of the iron 1 to 2 feet. The fauchard is a weapon of a foot soldier that was in use from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century. It is very difficult to make the exact departure between the fairly recent fauchards, which until the eighteenth century remained in use as a weapon of ramparts, and the war scythes, couteau de breche, etc.

The fauchard was also described in the &quot;Poem of the Combat of the Thirty&quot; (Le Poème du combat des Trente): &quot;Huceton of Clamanban fought with a fauchart / Which was cutting (bladed) on one side, hooked on the other side&quot;.

<text>The Shark 24 is a Canadian-designed 24 ft sailing yacht which has earned itself a reputation of extraordinary reliability and longevity among sailors both in North America and Central Europe. Having been designed by George Hinterhoeller back in 1959 to cope well even with the harshest conditions found in the Great Lakes region, the vessel has proven to be well suited for extended leisure trips as well as for tough racing.

The Shark 24 was awarded International status by World Sailing in 2000.

==History==
George Hinterhoeller grew up in Austria where he sailed the light displacement fin keel sailboats that were common there. By 1959 he had emigrated to Canada and was working for a boat builder in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario. Hinterhoeller decided to design and build a sailboat for himself that was similar to what he had sailed in his youth in Austria. The result was a plywood boat he named &quot;Teeter Totter&quot;. Other sailors saw the resulting boat, and how fast it sailed compared to the heavy displacement boats common on the Great Lakes at the time and asked Hinterhoeller to build similar boats for them. Hinterhoeller modified the design, stretching it out to and started production of what he then called the Shark. The customer who commissioned the fifth hull requested it be built in fibreglass and offered to help Hinterhoeller build it using this new material. The resulting boat was a success and all subsequent Shark produced were built in fibreglass as this resulted in a lighter boat that took far less time to build so was less expensive and required much less ongoing maintenance.

==Design==
The shark is a light displacement cruising and racing sailboat. It has a 7/8 fractional sloop rig, a small cabin and a self-bailing cockpit. The iron fin keel, combined with a transom hung spade rudder, and a flat run aft allows the hull to ride up on its bow wave and plane under the right conditions, giving the Shark more speed than a displacement hull of the same waterline length. It had a displacement-length ratio of 123, extraordinarily low for its time.

The Shark has a V-berth, two quarter berths, and a small galley with sink, stove and icebox. It has sitting headroom under the small deckhouse.

==Events==
===World Championship===

A World Championship Regatta for the Shark 24 class has been continuously contested for over 50 years. The regatta follows a three-year rotation where for two consecutive years the regatta is hosted by the Canadian Shark Class Association in Canada, and the third year it is held in Europe in Austria, Germany, or Switzerland.

<text>Nukulaelae is an atoll that is part of the nation of Tuvalu, and it has a population of 300 (2017 census). The largest settlement is Pepesala on Fangaua islet with a population of 300 people (2017 Census). It has the form of an oval and consists of at least 15 islets. The inhabited islet is Fangaua, which is long and wide. The easternmost point of Tuvalu is Niuoko islet. The Nukulaelae Conservation Area covers the eastern end of the lagoon. A baseline survey of marine life in the conservation zone was conducted in 2010.

==History==
The traditional history of Nukulaelae is that a white-skinned man was the first person to sight the island, but he did not settle as there were no trees. Nukulaelae means &#x27;the land of sands&#x27;. Later, according to tradition, Valoa from Vaitupu discovered Nukulaelae while on a fishing expedition. He returned to Nukulaelae and planted coconut trees and eventually settled on Nukulaelae with his family. On the islet of Tumuiloto was a &quot;malae&quot; named Fagafale where religious rights honouring ancestral spirits were practiced. On the islet of Niuoka is a large stone at a place called Te Faleatua - &#x27;the house of the gods.&#x27;

In 1821 Nukulaelae was visited by Captain George Barrett of the Nantucket whaler &quot;Independence II&quot; He named the atoll ‘Mitchell’s Group’.

Christianity first came to Tuvalu in 1861 when Elekana, a deacon of a Congregational church in Manihiki, Cook Islands became caught in a storm and drifted for 8 weeks before landing at Nukulaelae on 10 May 1861.

The population of Nukulaelae in 1860 is estimated to be 300 people. For less than a year between 1862 and 1863, Peruvian ships, engaged in what came to be called the &quot;blackbirding&quot; trade, came to the islands seeking recruits to fill the extreme labour shortage in Peru, including workers to mine the guano deposits on the Chincha Islands. On Nukulaelae, the resident trader facilitated the recruiting of the islanders by the &quot;blackbirders&quot;. About 200 were taken from Nukulaelae as immediately after 1863 there were fewer than 100 of the 300 recorded in 1861 as living on Nukulaelae.

Peter Laban was an early trader on Nukulaelae in the 1850s, followed by Tom Rose in the 1860s, and later Richard Collins in the 1890s. In 1865 a trading captain acting on behalf of the German firm of J.C. Godeffroy &amp; Sohn obtained a 25-year lease to the eastern islet of Niuoko. For many years the islanders and the Germans argued over the lease, including its terms and the importation of labourers, however the Germans remained until the lease expired in 1890.

In 1896, HMS &quot;Penguin&quot; spent two days at Nukulaelae carrying out a scientific survey of the atoll.

Nukulaelae Post Office opened around 1923.

The atoll was claimed by the United States under the Guano Islands Act from the 19th century until 1983, when claims to the atoll were ceded to Tuvalu.

==Politics==
No candidates contested the sitting MPs Seve Paeniu and Namoliki Sualiki in the 2024 general election that was held on 26 January 2024, so they were automatically returned to parliament.

==Education==
The junior school is Faikimua Primary School.

==Notable local people==

<text>The Beast Reawakens (later prints carried the subtitle Fascism&#x27;s Resurgence from Hitler&#x27;s Spymasters to Today&#x27;s Neo-Nazi Groups and Right-Wing Extremists) is a 1997 book by investigative journalist Martin A. Lee, in which the author discusses old-guard fascists&#x27; strategy for survival and the revival of fascism since 1944. Special attention is given to ODESSA actions during the Cold War, international fascist networks, and political inroads to the right-wing mainstream. The book opens with a quotation from T. E. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot; (1922), a favorite of Hitler&#x27;s favorite commando, SS-Standartenführer Otto Skorzeny.

==Reception==
Joshua Rubinstein, reviewing the book for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called it &quot;a vivid survey of fascist resurgence throughout Europe&quot;. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; described it as a &quot;compelling, intelligent investigation, which reads more like a thriller than a history lesson&quot;.

<text>Media in Seattle includes long-established newspapers, television and radio stations, and an evolving panoply of smaller, local art, culture, neighborhood and political publications, filmmaking and, most recently, Internet media. The Seattle–Tacoma Designated Market Area, as defined by Nielsen Media Research, includes most of Western Washington and the Wenatchee metropolitan area. , it is the 12th largest television market and 11th largest radio market in the United States by population.

Seattle has been at the forefront of new media developments since the 1999 protests of a meeting of the World Trade Organization in Seattle spurred the formation of the city&#x27;s Independent Media Center, which covered and disseminated the breaking news online to a worldwide audience. The location of Microsoft just outside Seattle in nearby Redmond, and the growth of interactive media companies have made Seattle prominent in new digital media.

Seattle&#x27;s major daily newspaper is &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;. The local Blethen family owns 50.5% of the &quot;Times&quot;, the other 49.5% being owned by the McClatchy Company. The &quot;Times&quot; holds the largest Sunday circulation in the Pacific Northwest. The &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; (now online only) is owned by the Hearst Corporation. The &quot;Seattle Daily Journal of Commerce&quot; covers economic news, and &quot;The Daily of the University of Washington&quot;, the University of Washington&#x27;s school paper, is published five days per week during the school year.

The Seattle newspaper landscape changed dramatically in 2009, when the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; ceased print publication. Previously, the &quot;Post-Intelligencer&quot; and &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; had shared a joint-operating agreement under which the &quot;Times&quot; handled business operations outside the newsroom for its competitor. When the &quot;Post-Intelligencer&quot; went online-only as SeattlePI.com, &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; felt the blow financially but continues to be a profit-earning publication and even increased its print circulation in 2009 by 30 percent. Nonetheless, the &quot;P-I&quot;&#x27;s move to online-only resulted in 145 jobs lost at that publication, while &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; cut 150 editorial positions shortly before that, in December 2008. The &quot;Times&quot; reaches 7 out of 10 adults in King and Snohomish Counties. With fewer resources, the &quot;Times&quot; took steps to consolidate some of its news coverage: for example, folding the daily business section into the paper&#x27;s A section. &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; has been recognized for its editorial excellence: The newspaper has been the recipient of nine Pulitzer Prizes. In recent years, the &quot;Times&quot; has begun to partner with other types of media outlets, including collaborations with several local bloggers that are funded by American university&#x27;s J-Lab: the Institute for Interactive Journalism and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.

The most prominent weeklies are the &quot;Seattle Weekly&quot; and &quot;The Stranger&quot;. Both consider themselves alternative papers. &quot;The Stranger&quot;, founded in 1992, is locally owned and has a younger and hipper readership. &quot;The Seattle Weekly&quot;, founded in 1976, has a longstanding reputation for in-depth coverage of the arts and local politics. It was purchased in 2000 by Village Voice Media, which in turn was acquired in 2005 by New Times Media. New Times Media has decreased the &quot;Weekly&#x27;s&quot; emphasis on politics. Other weekly papers are the &quot;Seattle Gay News&quot; and &quot;Real Change,&quot; an activist paper sold by homeless and low-income people. The &quot;Puget Sound Business Journal&quot; covers the local economy. &quot;The Rocket&quot;, a long-running weekly magazine devoted to the music scene, stopped publishing in 2000.
Seattle is also home to several ethnic newspapers. Among these are the African American papers &quot;The Facts&quot; and the &quot;Seattle Medium&quot;; the Asian American papers the &quot;Northwest Asian Weekly&quot;, &quot;Seattle Chinese Post&quot;, and the &quot;International Examiner&quot;; and the &quot;JTNews&quot; (formerly the &quot;Jewish Transcript&quot;). There are also numerous neighborhood newspapers, such as the &quot;Seattle Sun and Star&quot;, the &quot;West Seattle Herald&quot;, the &quot;Ballard News-Tribune&quot;, and the papers of the Pacific Publishing Company, which include the &quot;Queen Anne News, Magnolia News, North Seattle Herald-Outlook, Capitol Hill Times, Beacon Hill News &amp; South District Journal,&quot; and the &quot;Madison Park Times.&quot;

==Satire==
Seattle has a long history of hyper-local satire that stretches from the days of a late-night skit show Almost Live!—which launched the careers of Joel McHale and Bill Nye the Science Guy. A modern satire website, &quot;The Needling&quot;, is described by many as a local version of satire site &quot;The Onion&quot;.

==Television==

The Seattle television market is the 13th largest in the United States; it includes the adjacent cities of Tacoma, Bellevue, Everett, and Bellingham; and additional viewers from British Columbia, Canada (Vancouver and its surrounding area on broadcast and cable).

Seattle is served by numerous television stations. The major network affiliates are KOMO 4 (ABC), KING 5 (NBC), KIRO 7 (CBS), KCTS 9 (PBS), KCPQ 13 (Fox) and KUNS 51 (The CW), which are also seen across Canada via digital cable and satellite providers. Also broadcasting in English are two independent stations (KSTW 11 and KONG 6/16 with the latter run by/with KING TV), KTBW 20 (TBN), KZJO 22 (MyNetworkTV), KBTC 28 (PBS), KWPX-TV 33 (ION), KFFV 44 (MeTV). Most of these can be seen in Canada via digital cable or satellite. There are also two Spanish-language affiliates: KVOS 12 (Univision), which is licensed to Bellingham and Telemundo on the fourth subchannel of KIRO-TV.

Seattle&#x27;s commercial TV stations distinguish themselves from one another in various ways. KING-TV, owned by Tegna Media, has been nominated for 56 Regional Emmy Awards. The station allows viewers to submit their own photo and video content via its website and also highlights the work of average citizens in the community on-air in the recurring feature, &quot;Home Team Heroes.&quot; The former parent company of KOMO, Fisher Communications (which sold its media properties to the Sinclair Broadcast Group in 2013), launched a network of hyperlocal websites in 2009, which include blogs about issues related to community service, news of interest to families, crime news, and news about events occurring around the neighborhood. Finally, KIRO, owned by Cox Enterprises, maintains three reporters in a Washington, DC, bureau to cover news of interest to viewers back in Washington State.

Seattle also has three public television stations. The Seattle Channel, Government-access television (GATV) run by the city, airs public affairs, community service, and arts programming. The station is funded partly by cable television franchise fees and partly by a $5 million grant from Comcast, which will be paid over 10 years to support arts programming. After first focusing on civic programming, the Seattle Channel has become known for its arts programming. As the station&#x27;s on-air priorities have begun to emphasize arts programs, it has shifted much of the government accountability-oriented programming to live streaming on the Internet, best accessed by viewers with high-speed Internet access. KCTS-TV is Seattle&#x27;s PBS member station and operates three feeds: a primary, high-definition, general interest station; KCTS 9 PBS Kids (digital subchannel 9.2), which features children&#x27;s programs; and KCTS 9 Create (digital subchannel 9.3), which features DIY, cooking, arts and crafts, and travel programs. In 2009 KCTS aired 160 episodes in a regularly occurring series on local public affairs, personal finance, economic issues, and business affairs. While KCTS is a popular source for viewing nationally produced PBS shows, it features less programming on local public affairs than the region&#x27;s other two public TV stations. The third public station, SCAN, is Seattle&#x27;s public access cable television network. A 501(c)3 nonprofit, it provides equipment, production facilities, and media instruction for residents of Seattle and other King County communities. Although its funding is limited, SCAN often airs more locally produced public affairs programming each week than all the city&#x27;s broadcast networks combined.

Cable networks based out of the area include Root Sports Northwest, ResearchChannel and UWTV. Seattle cable viewers also receive CBUT-DT 2 (CBC) from Vancouver, British Columbia, often carried on cable channel 99. The 24-hour Northwest Cable News was available on cable until 2017.

==Radio==

Seattle has the thirteenth largest radio market in the United States, though this ranking does not take into account Canadian audiences. The radio market stretches across Puget Sound and Western Washington.

===AM stations===
===FM stations===
Coverage of news and public affairs across Seattle&#x27;s radio dial is inconsistent. KIRO (97.3 FM), which has a newsroom of 30 people, airs 34 hours of news programming per week, with a primary focus on local reporting; counting news analysis segments and related programming, this reaches 91 hours per week. KNWN (1000 AM and 97.7 FM) airs news and commentary 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Kris Bennett Broadcasting, a trio of stations serving the black community, airs 5 hours of local talk radio programming each week.

Many Seattle radio stations are also available through internet radio, with KEXP being the first radio station to offer real-time playlists, broadcast uncompressed CD quality music over the internet 24 hours a day, and offer internet archives of its shows (podcasts). Hollow Earth Radio began as an online-only station, emphasizing local artists outside the mainstream music scene, but in 2017 added a low power FM broadcast capability.

==Internet==
Seattle&#x27;s first significant foray into Internet media came along with Indymedia, a co-op started in 1999 that has since spread to many cities around the world. In the decade since the founding of Indymedia, all of the city&#x27;s mainstream media outlets have established or augmented their online presence, and numerous blogs have sprung up to supplement traditional media. The city hit another first when the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; became the first online-only newspaper in the nation, and as SeattlePI.com, that outlet has experimented with its growth by adding reader blogs and neighborhood-focused blogs. The P-I first began experimenting with blog-driven community engagement with the &quot;Big Blog,&quot; a local news blog whose founding reporter used to hold regular public meet-ups with Seattle residents, a practice now embraced by other local bloggers, as well.

Across the Seattle region, 43% of adults read news online on a regular basis and another 21% read or contribute to blogs. In addition to blogs, other online media outlets that offer wider-ranging coverage include Crosscut, started by &quot;Seattle Weekly&quot; founder David Brewster and more recently acquired by Cascade Public Media, Publicola.net, Investigate West &amp; Seattle Post Globe. Sea Beez, a content-sharing online portal for ethnic media outlets, is in the process of launching a local news site.

Additionally, Seattle offers several locally focused online publications. SportsPressNW, founded by sports columnists Art Thiel and Steve Rudman, focuses on sports. GeekWire, founded in 2011 by former P-I reporters John Cook and Todd Bishop, focuses on the technology and startup industries. Do206 focuses on arts-and-entertainment event listings, news and information was founded by Adam Zacks, founder of the Sasquatch! Music Festival, and Scott Porad, a local technology executive.

In 2018, the online non-profit Cascadia Magazine was launched, &quot;covering people, places and culture of the Pacific Northwest&quot; with both in-depth features and literary works. Stories and authors span Washington, Oregon and British Columbia. It was started by journalist Andrew Engelson. A daily newsletter, begun in 2017, offers curated news briefs about/around the Pacific Northwest from other local news outlets.

Seattle is served by a number of online media outlets: The City of Seattle Information Technology department identified 260 websites focused on Seattle&#x27;s local neighborhoods and communities, including non-traditional, linked news and information outlets. Much of this online activity is driven by the rich hyperlocal news scene in the city, which has seen an exponential growth this past decade. This has been led in the area by sites such as westseattleblog.com and myballard.com, but also old media companies such as KOMO There&#x27;s a pair of articles here and here covering the ad scene for hyperlocal in January 2010.

Seattle&#x27;s online hyperlocal media vary greatly in terms of web traffic, scope, and resources. Some sites are run by journalists first trained in traditional media, such as Next Door Media, a network of 10 neighborhood blogs that nets a combined 1 million page views per month. By comparison, SeattleTimes.com and SeattlePI.com average 45 million and 40 million monthly page views, respectively. Capitol Hill Seattle Blog, another popular hyperlocal blog, commands 200,000 monthly page views, and West Seattle Blog, 900,000. Despite varied audiences, a content analysis conducted by the New America Foundation found that online media are filling gaps in news coverage left by traditional media. The study looked at &quot;Capitol Hill Seattle,&quot; &quot;West Seattle Blog,&quot; &quot;My Ballard,&quot; &quot;Wallyhood,&quot; SeattlePI.com, and SeattleTimes.com, and found that the first four sources (all hyperlocal blogs) devoted a greater percentage of their news coverage to issues specific to Seattle&#x27;s neighborhoods. SeattleTimes.com and SeattlePI.com, on the other hand, covered more metro, national, and international news. The blogs devoted a greater percentage of their coverage to the combined subjects of politics, health, education, employment, social services, and arts and entertainment.

The background to Seattle&#x27;s extensive coverage on the Internet is the city&#x27;s history of flourishing alternative media, ranging from small presses to low power FM radio broadcasting. The independent, volunteer-run KRAB-FM radio, a high powered station that operated on 107.7 MHz in the regular broadcast band, influenced a generation of listeners during the 1960s and 1970s. Later, before Internet radio became practical, a number of very low power, microradio FM stations broadcast on the few FM frequencies not allocated to high power stations. Currently, FCC deliberations and rulings about Internet radio are followed not only by Internet entrepreneurs, but also by those Seattleites who produced and listened to local radio as well as by those who produce and read the numerous local print publications.

== Analysis ==

Friedland (2014) and others have lauded Seattle as a model for the nation and perhaps the world in its robust &quot;civic communication ecology&quot; that attempts to provide high speed Internet access and computer and media training to all, including those with low incomes, that has allegedly contributed to a higher rate of democratic participation than elsewhere. Friedland identified three key features of this:

# &quot;[A] robust, healthy local newspaper [&quot;The Seattle Times&quot;], with a strong online presence that ... will be a hub of connection, rather than the single authoritative fount of knowledge.&quot; 
# &quot;[A] civic communications network [that is] equally accessible to everyone&quot;, subsidized at least initially by municipal investment in neighborhood centers that provide free or low-cost training in computer and media literacy. 
# &quot;[A] larger civic communication ecology [resting] on the foundation of a ... robust micro-ecology, among individuals, niches, groups, and neighborhoods, that generates information from below.&quot;

In this system, news percolates up as well as down with news writing and research being shared between levels in an open and conscious way. This system has been created out of a combination of the high-tech base of the metro area with higher than average education level and incomes but with modest grants (typically a few thousand dollars) for a variety of projects funded by government, J-Lab and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.

<text>Jeffrey Adam Zucker (born April 9, 1965) is an American businessman and media executive. Zucker was the president of CNN Worldwide from 2013 to 2022. He oversaw CNN, CNN International, HLN, and CNN Digital. He was previously CEO of NBCUniversal.
==Early life and education==
Jeffrey Adam Zucker was born on April 9, 1965, into a Jewish family in Homestead, Florida, near Miami, on April 9, 1965. His father, Matthew Zucker, was a cardiologist, and his mother, Arline, was a school teacher.

He was a captain of the North Miami Senior High School tennis team, editor of the school paper, and a teenage freelance reporter (&quot;stringer&quot;) for &quot;The Miami Herald&quot;. Zucker also was president of his sophomore, junior, and senior classes, running on the slogan &quot;The little man with the big ideas.&quot; He graduated from North Miami Senior High School in 1982. Before college, he took part in Northwestern University&#x27;s National High School Institute program for journalism. Zucker went on to Harvard University. He was president of the school newspaper, &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot;, during his senior year. As such, he encouraged the &quot;Crimson&quot;&#x27;s decades-old prank rivalry with the &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot;, then headed by future NBC employee Conan O&#x27;Brien, which culminated in Zucker having O’Brien arrested. Zucker graduated from Harvard in 1986 with a Bachelor of Arts in American history.

==Career==
===NBC and NBCUniversal===
====Early career====
When he was not admitted to Harvard Law School, he began working at NBC by accepting an internship at the 1988 Summer Olympics.

In 1989, he was a field producer for &quot;Today,&quot; and at 26 he became its executive producer in 1992. He introduced the program&#x27;s trademark outdoor rock concert series and was in charge as &quot;Today&quot; moved to the &quot;window on the world&quot; Studio 1A in Rockefeller Plaza in 1994. He is credited with managing the show during its most successful years and launching it into its 16 years of ratings dominance.

====President (2000–2005)====
In 2000, he was named NBC Entertainment&#x27;s president. A 2004 BusinessWeek Profile stated that &quot;During that time he oversaw NBC&#x27;s entire entertainment schedule. He kept the network ahead of the pack by airing the gross out show &quot;Fear Factor&quot;, negotiating for the cast of the hit series &quot;Friends&quot; to take the series up to a tenth season, and signing Donald Trump for the reality show &quot;The Apprentice&quot;. He is credited with the idea to extend &quot;Friends&quot; episodes by 10 minutes and convinced the cast to extend their contracts by two years. The &quot;Friends&quot; era was one of the most profitable ever for NBC. The Zucker era produced a spike in operating earnings for NBC, from $532 million the year he took over to $870 million in 2003.&quot;

Zucker introduced &quot;Las Vegas&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;, and &quot;Scrubs&quot;. He originated the idea of airing &quot;Supersized&quot; (longer than the standard 30-minute slot) episodes of NBC&#x27;s comedies and aggressively programming in the summer months as cable networks began to draw away viewers with original programming from the network&#x27;s rerun-filled summer slate. Bravo changed its programming direction towards reality television, while the newly acquired Spanish network Telemundo was positioned to be more competitive with leading network Univision.

In December 2003, Zucker became president of NBC&#x27;s Entertainment, News &amp; Cable Group as well.

Following the merger with French media empire Vivendi Universal, he became president of the newly formed NBC Universal Television Group in May 2004. Vivendi Universal had acquired Fox Interactive a year earlier in 2003. During Zucker&#x27;s tenure, shows that he championed such as &quot;Father of the Pride&quot; and the &quot;Friends&quot; spinoff &quot;Joey&quot; were considered failures.

====Chief Executive Officer of NBC Universal Television Group====
On December 15, 2005, Zucker was promoted by NBC Universal to Chief Executive Officer of NBC Universal Television Group behind Robert Charles Wright, vice chairman of General Electric and chairman &amp; CEO of NBC Universal. Zucker was responsible for all programming across the company&#x27;s television properties, including network, news, cable, sports and Olympics. His responsibilities also included the company&#x27;s studio operations and global distribution efforts.

====President and CEO of NBC Universal====

On February 6, 2007, Zucker became president and CEO of NBC Universal.

In 2010, in response to a public controversy over the network&#x27;s reported rescheduling of late-night hosts Jay Leno and Conan O&#x27;Brien, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reporters Meg James and Matea Gold wrote that Zucker&#x27;s tenure had led to &quot;a spectacular fall by the country&#x27;s premier television network&quot; and dubbed the intra-network feud and subsequent public relations fallout &quot;one of the biggest debacles in television history&quot;. Under Zucker NBC fell from being the number one rated network to the lowest rated of the four broadcast networks and was occasionally being beaten in the ratings by programming on some of the more popular cable channels.

Days later, &quot;The New York Times&quot; columnist Maureen Dowd wrote that in Hollywood &quot;there has been a single topic of discussion: How does Jeff Zucker keep rising and rising while the fortunes of NBC keep falling and falling? ...many in the Hollywood community have always regarded him as ...a network Napoleon who never bothered to learn about developing shows and managing talent.&quot; She explained that Zucker &quot;is a master at managing up with bosses and calculating cost-per-hour benefits, but even though he made money on cable shows, he could not program the network to save his life.&quot;

Dowd also reported that an unnamed &quot;honcho at another network&quot; stated that &quot;Zucker is a case study in the most destructive media executive ever to exist... You&#x27;d have to tell me who else has taken a once-great network and literally destroyed it.&quot;

On June 2, 2010, the &quot;New York Post&quot; reported that Zucker would be paid between $30 million and $40 million to leave NBC Universal shortly after Comcast completed its 51% acquisition in the company.

===&quot;Katie&quot; producer===
Zucker worked with fellow NBC News alum, former &quot;Today&quot; host Katie Couric, producing her daytime talk show for Disney-ABC Domestic Television, &quot;Katie&quot;. However, Zucker left the show to be the president of CNN Worldwide.

===Career at WarnerMedia===
====President of CNN Worldwide====
Zucker became president of CNN Worldwide on January 1, 2013. His appointment was widely welcomed by the network and its anchors. Anderson Cooper told colleagues that Zucker was &quot;the first CNN president to actually watch CNN&quot;. In December 2013, Zucker stated that his goal for the channel was to offer an &quot;attitude and a take&quot; to viewers, with a larger focus on reality-style documentary series (expanding upon the success of its documentary acquisition &quot;Blackfish&quot;, and new series &quot;Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown&quot;). Zucker explained that he wanted CNN to appeal more to regular viewers of factual networks (such as A&amp;E, Discovery, and History), and make larger investments into the network&#x27;s digital properties.

With the 2014 cancellation of &quot;Piers Morgan Live&quot;, CNN experimented with airing factual programming in primetime as an alternative, with Zucker stating that it would cater to younger demographics than pundit-oriented programs. However, Zucker still insisted that news remained CNN&#x27;s first priority, and that these programs could be preempted for continuing coverage of breaking news events when needed. 2014 saw an increase in daytime and primetime viewership of CNN; by October 2014, CNN had overtaken MSNBC in primetime key demographic viewership, placing second behind Fox News.

During the 2016 presidential election campaign, a large focus was placed upon on-air debates between partisan pundits surrounding issues relating to the candidates (including, in particular, Republican candidate Donald Trump). In an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Zucker stated that aspects of its election coverage were influenced by sports channels (with the &quot;Times&quot; citing, specifically, debates between pundits reminiscent of shows such as ESPN&#x27;s &quot;First Take&quot;, and large outdoor &quot;pre-game&quot; shows for the presidential debates), explaining that &quot;the idea that politics is sport is undeniable, and we understood that and approached it that way.&quot; In 2016, CNN reached a monthly average of 105 million unique visitors to its web and mobile properties.

Leaked secret recordings of conversations between Zucker and Trump&#x27;s lawyer Michael Cohen made in March 2016 show that Zucker wanted to do a weekly show with Trump and offered debate advice to Trump.

On February 2, 2021, Zucker announced he would step down at the end of the year. In August 2021, however, it was reported that he did not plan to leave until the completion of the merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery, Inc.

====WarnerMedia News &amp; Sports====
In March 2019, CNN parent WarnerMedia announced a reorganization in which Zucker would become chairman of the company&#x27;s news and sports division, overseeing Turner Sports, Bleacher Report and AT&amp;T SportsNet, in addition to maintaining his role as head of CNN.

==== Resignation ====
On February 2, 2022, Zucker resigned from CNN. In his resignation letter, Zucker acknowledged that he did not disclose a consensual relationship he had with CNN&#x27;s Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, Allison Gollust, when it began. The relationship was made public in early January 2022 during the network&#x27;s investigation into Chris Cuomo. Following his resignation from CNN, Zucker also resigned from his position as chief of WarnerMedia News &amp; Sports.

===RedBird IMI===
In December 2022, Zucker was named an executive with Redbird IMI, a consortium with majority funding from Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Vice President of the UAE. The consortium is a joint venture between Gerry Cardinale&#x27;s RedBird Capital Partners and International Media Investments, a media investment fund backed by the United Arab Emirates. The position also includes an active role in the XFL, a professional football league partially owned by RedBird.

The consortium&#x27;s planned purchase of &quot;The&quot; &quot;Telegraph&quot;, a prominent British newspaper, has caused controversy in the United Kingdom, as concerns were raised that the newspaper would be coming under the control of an autocratic state. 

In April 2024, RedBird confirmed it would withdraw its takeover plans, stating they were &quot;no longer feasible&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1996, Zucker married Caryn Stephanie Nathanson, then a supervisor for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, with whom he has four children; the two divorced in 2017.

Diagnosed in 1996 and 1999 with colon cancer, Zucker successfully underwent surgery twice and chemotherapy after the first surgery. In July 2018, Zucker took a six-week leave of absence from CNN to recover from heart surgery.

Zucker was an executive in residence at Columbia Business School.

<text>Nukufetau is an atoll that is part of the nation of Tuvalu. The atoll was claimed by the US under the Guano Islands Act some time in the 19th century and was ceded in a treaty of friendship concluded in 1979 and coming into force in 1983. It has a population of 597 who live on Savave islet (2017 Census).

==Geography==
Nukufetau is an atoll with passages through the reef that allow large ships to enter and anchor in the lagoon. Nukufetau consists of at least 33 islets:

* Faiava Lasi
* Fale
* Funaota
* Kongo Loto Lafanga
* Lafanga
* Matanukulaelae
* Motufetau
* Motulalo
* Motuloa (north of Nukufetau)
* Motuloa (south of Nukufetau)
* Motumua
* Niualuka
* Niuatui
* Oua
* Sakalua
* Savave
* Teafatule
* Teafuaniua
* Teafuanonu
* Teafuone
* Temotuloto
* and at least 12 other islands

The biggest island is Motulalo. In the late 19th century, after the coming of the missionaries, the people of Nukufetau lived on Fale islet before shifting to Savave which is on the lagoon side of the Fale settlement.

On Savave islet 331 people live in Aulotu and 191 live in Maneapa (2012 census).

==History==

The traditional history of Nukufetau is that a party of Tongans were the first people to settle. When they landed they found only one &quot;fetau&quot; (or &quot;fetaʻu&quot; in Tongan) tree growing on the atoll, so they called the place Nukufetau – the island of the &quot;fetau&quot;. They planted coconut trees and settled on Fale on the western side of the atoll.

Arent Schuyler de Peyster, of New York, captain of the armed brigantine or privateer &quot;Rebecca&quot;, sailing under British colours, passed through the southern Tuvalu waters in May 1819 sighting Nukufetau.

In 1820 the Russian explorer Mikhail Lazarev visited Nukufetau as commander of the &quot;Mirny&quot;.

The United States Exploring Expedition under Charles Wilkes visited Nukufetau in 1841.
Louis Becke, who later became a writer, operated a store on Nukufetau from February 1881 to August 1881. Becke later wrote a story about a fishing expedition: &quot;The Fisher Folk Of Nukufetau&quot;.

The population of Nukufetau from 1860 to 1900 is estimated to be 250 people.

Alfred Restieaux was a trader on Nukufetau in the late 19th century from 1873 to 1879 and met his wife Litia. He returned sometime in the 1880s; in 1892 Captain Edward Davis, of , recorded Alfred Restieaux and Emile Fenisot as trading on Nukufetau. Restieaux died on Nukufetau in 1911.

Nukufetau Post Office opened around 1925.

During World War II Coastwatchers, who observed and reported on Japanese shipping, had a station on Nukufetau. In 1943 United States Navy Seabees build a deepwater wharf and an airfield on Motulalo, which is the largest islet of Nukufetau. Two intersecting runways of Nukufetau Airfield formed an &quot;X&quot; shape.

B-24s were based at the airfield. The Marine Attack Squadron 331 (VMA-331) also flew Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers from Nukufetau. After the war the airfield was dismantled and the land returned to its owners, however as the coral base was compacted to make the runway the land now provides poor ground for growing coconuts.

There is a shipwreck at the southeast corner of the atoll, but only the bow and parts of the stern remain.

=== Cyclone Pam ===
Nukufetau was affected by storm surges caused by Cyclone Pam in early March 2015, which damaged houses, crops and infrastructure. As of 22 March, 76 people (13 percent of the population) were displaced and were living in 2 evacuation centres. The Situation Report published on 30 March reported that on Nukufetau all the displaced people have returned to their homes. Nukufetau suffered the loss of 90% of crops.

In 2016 a 500-metre seawall was constructed to improve the defences against severe wet weather events. The $8 million cost of the project was paid by the United Nations Development Programme and was carried out by dredging and civil contracting company Hall Pacific.

==Food==
In addition to imported food, food is produced on Fale and on Funaota. The products include pulaka (a root crop), pigs, breadfruit, brown coconuts and germinating nuts.

==Politics==
Enele Sopoaga and Panapasi Nelesoni were re-elected in the 2024 Tuvaluan general election.


==Education==
In 1951 the school that was located on Motumua islet was transferred to Savave and became the government primary school for Nukufetau. It was named the Tutasi Memorial School in honour of its predecessor.

==Notable people==
* Faimalaga Luka (April 15, 1940 – August 19, 2005) represented Nukufetau in the Parliament of Tuvalu. He served as Prime Minister (2001) and as Governor-General (2003-2005).
* Saufatu Sopoanga, Prime Minister of Tuvalu (2002-2004), represented Nukufetau in the parliament for a number of years.
* Enele Sopoaga, the younger brother of Saufatu Sopoanga, was elected to represent Nukufetau in the parliament in 2010, and served as the Prime Minister of Tuvalu from August 2013 until September 2019.

<doc id="1030243" wikidata="Q270080" url="?curid=1030243" title="DR Congo national football team">
<text>The DR Congo national football team (French: &quot;Équipe nationale de football de la République démocratique du Congo&quot;), recognised by FIFA as Congo DR, represents the Democratic Republic of the Congo in men&#x27;s international football and it is controlled by the Congolese Association Football Federation. They are nicknamed &quot;Les Léopards&quot;, meaning The Leopards. The team is a member of FIFA and the Confederation of African Football (CAF).

Congo DR have been ranked as high as 28th in the FIFA Rankings, as Zaire they were the first Sub-Saharan African team to qualify for the FIFA World Cup and twice won the Africa Cup of Nations. They are also one of the most successful teams in the African Nations Championship with 2 titles, along with Morocco. They are currently ranked 63rd in the FIFA Rankings.

Congo DR have previously competed variously as Belgian Congo, Congo-Kinshasa and Zaïre. Their appearance at the 1974 FIFA World Cup was as Zaïre.

==History==

===Early history===
The Congolese Association Football Federation was founded in 1919 when the country was not independent. The team played their first game in 1948 as Belgian Congo against Northern Rhodesia, now Zambia. The team recorded a 3–2 victory at home. DR Congo has been FIFA affiliated since 1962 and has been a member of CAF since 1963. The team&#x27;s first official match was on 11 April 1963, against Mauritania in the L&#x27;Amitié Tournament played in Dakar, Senegal. DR Congo won the match 6–0. The national team appeared in the Africa Cup of Nations for the first time in 1965.

===Glory period===
The Democratic Republic of the Congo had its first international success at the 1968 African Cup of Nations held in Ethiopia, beating Ghana 1–0 in the final. The team&#x27;s biggest ever win came on 22 November 1969 when they recorded a 10–1 home victory against Zambia. Although a handful of Congolese players were playing in Europe (particularly Belgium) during these years, foreign-based players were seldom recalled for international duty; a rare exception was Julien Kialunda who represented Zaire (as the country was by then known) at the 1972 African Cup of Nations while playing for Anderlecht.

The second continental title came at the 1974 African Cup of Nations in Egypt. The Leopards recorded a 2–1 victory against Guinea, another 2–1 victory against rivals Congo and a 4–1 victory against Mauritius. These results carried Zaire through to the semi-finals where they beat hosts Egypt 3–2. In the final, Zaire drew with Zambia 2–2. Therefore, the match was replayed two days later, where Zaire won the game 2–0. Zaire player Ndaye Mulamba was top scorer with nine goals, which remains a record for the tournament. After this, the team returned to Zaire on the Presidential plane, lent to them by Mobutu Sese Seko.

Zaire were the first Sub-Saharan African team to participate in a World Cup, qualifying for the 1974 tournament in place of the 1970 participant Morocco, whom they defeated in the decisive qualifier 3–0 in Kinshasa. Such was the desire to foster an identity of Zaire as a global player that Mobutu paid for advertising hoardings at the World Cup to display messages such as ‘Zaire-Peace’ and ‘Go to Zaire’. At the tournament itself, Zaire did not manage to score any goals and lost all of its games, but gave credible performances against Scotland and Brazil. However, their 9–0 loss against Yugoslavia remains one of the worst World Cup defeats. A bizarre moment came in the match versus Brazil; facing a free-kick 25 yards out, defender Mwepu Ilunga, upon hearing the referee blow his whistle, ran out of the Zaire wall and kicked the ball upfield, for which he received a yellow card. This was voted the 17th greatest World Cup moment in a Channel 4 poll. Ilunga has stated that he was quite aware of the rules and was hoping to convince the referee to send him off. The intended red card would have been a protest against his country&#x27;s authorities, who were alleged to be depriving the players of their earnings. Many contemporary commentators instead held it to be an example of African football&#x27;s &quot;naïvety and indiscipline&quot;.

===Crisis period===
After winning the 1974 African Cup of Nations and participating in the 1974 World Cup, the team was eliminated in the first round of the 1976 African Cup of Nations after recording a draw and two losses in the group stage. Morocco went on to win the tournament. From 1978 to 1986, the country did not qualify for the African Cup of Nations, while not participating in qualification for the 1978 World Cup and 1986 World Cup. In the 1988 African Cup of Nations, Zaire finished last in their group despite having two draws.

===Return to success===
From 1992 to 1996, Zaire, reached three consecutive African Cup of Nations quarter-finals. In 1992 and 1994, they were beaten by Nigeria, and in 1996 they were beaten by Ghana. In 1997, the country returned to its former name of Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the national team was re-branded as the Simbas, a nickname that stuck for the next nine years. DR Congo played their first game on 8 June 1997 in Pointe-Noire which ended in a 1–0 loss to the Republic of the Congo. At the 1998 African Cup of Nations, DR Congo, led by Louis Watunda, surprisingly took third place, beating Cameroon in the quarter-finals and hosts Burkina Faso 4–1 on penalties in their last match after scoring three late goals to tie the encounter 4–4.

At the 2000 African Cup of Nations, the team finished third in their group, and in 2002 were eliminated in the quarter-finals by Senegal. Then, in 2004, DR Congo were eliminated after three straight defeats in the group stages. In 2006, led by Claude Le Roy, having finished second in the group behind Cameroon, the Congolese were eliminated in the quarter-finals by Egypt 4–1.

===Struggles===
DR Congo were drawn in group 10 for qualifications for the 2008 African Cup of Nations, along with Libya, Namibia and Ethiopia. Before the last match day, the Congolese led the group, but they drew 1–1 with Libya in their final match while Namibia beat Ethiopia 3–2. This sent Namibia through to the Finals, while the Leopards were eliminated. DR Congo also failed to qualify for the 2010 World Cup. In 2009, DR Congo won the 2009 African Championship of Nations, a competition reserved to players in domestic leagues, a tournament they would again win in 2016. DR Congo reached the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations finals in South Africa but were knocked out in the group stages after drawing all three matches.

===The Ibengé era: rise and near World Cup miss===
In the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, DR Congo again drew all three group matches but this time finished second in the group behind Tunisia, and therefore advanced to the quarter-finals to play their rivals Republic of Congo, a match in which the Leopards came from two goals down to win 4–2. However, they were knocked out by the Ivory Coast 3–1 in the semi-finals. They ended up finishing third, beating Equatorial Guinea on penalties, after the third place match finished 0–0 in regulation time.

DR Congo under Ibengé improved radically and had an outstanding performance for many decades in a World Cup qualification. During the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification, DR Congo was grouped with Libya, Tunisia and Guinea. DR Congo managed an outstanding performance, beating Libya and Guinea home and away, but missed the chance after losing 1–2 to eventual World Cup qualifier Tunisia in Tunis and drew 2–2 at home to the same opponent.

== Home stadium ==
Stade des Martyrs has been the home of the national team since its establishment and they roughly play their games at Lubumbashi.

<text>John Ponsonby, PC (Ire) (29 March 171316 August 1787) was an Anglo-Irish politician.

==Biography==
Ponsonby was the second son of Brabazon Ponsonby, who was created the Earl of Bessborough in 1739, and his first wife, Sarah Margetson Colvill. He was the grandson of William Ponsonby, 1st Viscount Duncannon.

In 1739, Ponsonby entered the Irish House of Commons for Newtownards, becoming its speaker in 1756. He also served as First Commissioner of the Revenue and he became a member of the Privy Council of Ireland in 1746. In 1761, Ponsonby was elected for County Kilkenny and Armagh, and sitting for the former. In 1768, he stood also for Gowran and Newtownards, and in 1776 for Carlow, but chose each time County Kilkenny, which he represented until 1783. Subsequently, Ponsonby was again returned for Newtownards and sat for this constituency until his death in 1787.

Belonging to one of the great families which at this time monopolized the government of Ireland, Ponsonby was one of the principal &quot;undertakers&quot;, men who controlled the whole of the king&#x27;s business in Ireland, and he retained the chief authority until George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend, became lord-lieutenant in 1767. Then followed a struggle for supremacy between the Ponsonby faction and the party dependent on Townshend, one result of this being that Ponsonby resigned the speakership in 1771.

He married in 1743 Lady Elizabeth Cavendish, daughter of the 3rd Duke of Devonshire, a connection which was of great importance to the Ponsonbys. (His older brother, William Ponsonby, 2nd Earl of Bessborough, had married the Duke&#x27;s eldest daughter in 1739.) His sons, William Ponsonby, 1st Baron Ponsonby of Imokilly, and George Ponsonby, were also politicians of distinction. His daughter Catherine married Richard Boyle, 2nd Earl of Shannon, and was mother to Henry Boyle, 3rd Earl of Shannon.

<text>Lev Andreyevich Artsimovich (Russian: Лев Андреевич Арцимович, February 25, 1909 – March 1, 1973), also transliterated Arzimowitsch, was a Soviet physicist known for his contributions to the Tokamak— a device that produces controlled thermonuclear fusion power.

Prior to conceiving the idea on nuclear fusion, Artsimovich participated in the former Soviet program of nuclear weapons, and was a recipient of many former Soviet honors and awards.

== Biography==

Artsimovich was born on 25 February 1909 in Moscow in the Russian Empire. His family had Polish nobility roots; nonetheless, he was described as Russian by his autobiographer in 1985. His grandfather, a professor, was exiled to Siberia after the Polish uprising against Tsarist Russia in 1863 and married a Russian woman, later settling in Smolensk. His father was educated at Lviv University; his mother was a pianist trained in Switzerland. In 1923, Soviet authorities moved the Artsimovich family (due to suspicion of Anti-bolshevist activity) to Minsk, where he found employment in the railroad industry and started training towards becoming a railroad engineer. After his father found employment at Belarus State University, Artsimovich was able to attend the physics program at Belarus State University, and graduated with a specialist degree in physics in 1928–29. After moving to Moscow, he found employment in Artem Alikhanian&#x27;s laboratory, and joined the staff at the Ioffe Institute in 1930.

Initially, he worked on problems relating to nuclear physics and unsuccessfully defended his thesis for a Candidate of Sciences degree in 1937 and in 1939 at the Leningrad Polytechnical Institute, receiving only a written endorsement from the Ioffe Institute. During his lifetime, Artsimovich was recommended by many leading Soviet physicists to be conferred a Doktor Nauk (a Russian PhD), but the recommendations were later dismissed.

In 1945, Artsimovich joined the Soviet program of nuclear weapons, working on an electromagnetic method of isotope separation of uranium at Laboratory No. 2 along with Isaak Pomeranchuk. He was given Russian espionage files from Soviet agencies on the Manhattan Project&#x27;s electromagnetic method. But the uranium enrichment under Artsimovich failed when it proved too costly since the electricity required for this work could not be produced by the Soviet power grid at that time. Despite being removed by Beria, Artsimovich continued work on gas discharges with support from Kurchatov at his Laboratory No. 2. After 1949, his work focused on the field of nuclear fusion by producing lithium-6 for the RDS-6s device.

From 1951 to his death in 1973, Artsimovich was the head of the fusion power program in the former Soviet Union and became known as &quot;the father of the Tokamak&quot;, a special concept for a fusion reactor. Once Artsimovich was asked when the first thermonuclear reactor would start its work. He replied: &quot;When mankind needs it, maybe a short time before that.&quot;

In 1953, he became an &quot;academician&quot; of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and then a member of its Presidium in 1957. From 1963 to 1973, he was vice-chairman of the Russian chapter of the Pugwash Committee and chairman of the National Committee of Soviet Physicists. In 1966, he visited the United States to deliver a lecture on fusion and Tokamak technology at MIT, and was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He has been a foreign member of German Academy of Sciences at Berlin since 1969. On 1 March 1973, Artsimovich passed away due to cardiac arrest in Moscow. The crater Artsimovich on the Moon is named after him.

<text>George Ponsonby (5 March 17558 July 1817), was a British lawyer and Whig politician. He was Lord Chancellor of Ireland from 1806 to 1807 in the Ministry of All the Talents.

==Background and education==
Ponsonby was the second surviving son of the Honourable John Ponsonby, speaker of the Irish House of Commons (1756–71), and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Cavendish (1723–1796), daughter of William Cavendish, 3rd Duke of Devonshire. He was educated at Kilkenny College and at Trinity College, Cambridge.

==Legal and political career==
A barrister, Ponsonby became a member of the Irish House of Commons in 1776. He sat for Wicklow between 1778 and 1783 and subsequently for Inistioge between 1783 and 1797. From 1798 until the Act of Union in 1801, he represented Galway Borough. Ponsonby was Chancellor of the Irish Exchequer in 1782, afterwards taking a prominent part in the debates on the question of Roman Catholic relief, and leading the opposition to the union of the parliaments.

After 1801 Ponsonby represented County Wicklow and then Tavistock in the Parliament of the United Kingdom; in 1806 to 1807 he was Lord Chancellor of Ireland, and from 1808 to 1817 he was the recognised leader of the opposition in the British House of Commons.

Ponsonby had been selected as the first recognised leader of the opposition, rather than leader of an opposition, when the two leading Whig peers Lord Grenville and Earl Grey, proposed him to Whig MPs. Ponsonby was described by Foorde as &quot;a little-known mediocrity who was related to Lady Grey&quot;. He proved to be a weak leader, but was unwilling to resign and so retained the leadership of the party in the House of Commons until his death. He was succeeded as party leader by George Tierney.

==Personal life==
In Dublin, he was a member of Daly&#x27;s Club.

He married Lady Mary Butler, the daughter of Brinsley Butler, 2nd Earl of Lanesborough and his wife Lady Jane Rochfort. He left an only daughter, Elizabeth, when he died in London on 8 July 1817, who went on to marry Francis Aldborough Prittie, MP, by whom she had six children.

<text>The All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), or Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sabha, is the peasant front of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and works for farmer&#x27;s rights, peasant rights, and anti-feudal movement in India.

This organization is sometimes referred to as All India Kisan Sabha (36 Canning Lane), to distinguish it from the All India Kisan Sabha of Communist Party of India. All India Kisan Sabha (36 Canning Lane) was previously known as All India Kisan Sabha (Ashoka Road).

==History==

After the 1964 split in the Communist Party of India, there were efforts to retain AIKS as a united organization. However, there were tensions between the leftist and rightist factions within the AIKS. But soon, at the 28 August 1967 Central Kisan Council meeting in Madurai, differences arose over the membership figures. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) faction in AIKS accused the Communist Party of India faction of presenting falsely inflated membership data of state units in order to increase their influence in the organization. The dispute led to a walk-out from the Central Kisan Council. Due to the disruptive activities of those leaders, finally, there was a split in the Kisan Sabha, and another Kisan Sabha was constituted in October 1967, after a section of the leadership left the AIKS and formed a separate Sabha.

As a result, the CPI faction constitutes a parallel All India Kisan Sabha of its own by holding their 19th All India Conference at Amravati, Maharashtra, in January 1968. And the CPI(M) faction constitutes All India Kisan Sabha (36 Canning Lane) by holding its 19th All India Conference at Madurai, Tamil Nadu, on January 26–28, 1968. In Madurai, the conference amended its constitution and abolished AIKC as it rarely met. As there was no AIKC, the conference directly elected the CKC and office bearers for the first time. The conference elected A. K. Gopalan as its president, and Hare Krishna Konar was elected the general secretary. The conference also elected a 33-member CKC, including office bearers. On the last evening, a public rally was held at Madurai. A large number of peasants, agricultural workers, and working-class people attended the huge gathering. It was addressed by J. S. Lyallpuri, E. M. S. Namboodiripad, P. Ramamurthi, and others. A decision was taken to shift the central office. The Central Office of the Kisan Sabha was shifted from Delhi, 4 Ashoka Road, in April 1968, to Calcutta, first at 49 Lake Place and then to 36A Beniapukur Road, Calcutta 14.

==National office bearers==
The 35th All India Conference held at Thrissur, Kerala from 13–16 December 2022 elected Vijoo Krishnan as the general secretary of All India Kisan Sabha. National president Ashok Dhawale and finance secretary P. Krishna Prasad retained their positions from the previous Hisar conference.

<doc id="1030281" wikidata="Q1056953" url="?curid=1030281" title="Minsc">
<text>Minsc is a fictional character in the &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; series of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; role-playing video games developed by BioWare and Larian Studios. He originated from the pen-and-paper &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; sessions held by the lead designer of &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;, James Ohlen, and was expanded upon by the game&#x27;s lead writer, Lukas Kristjanson. His video game debut was in &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; as a companion character who can join the player&#x27;s party. He also appears in the sequel, &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II: Shadows of Amn&quot;, the expansion, &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II: Throne of Bhaal&quot;, the 2015 game &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Siege of Dragonspear&quot;, the 2023 game &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&quot;, as well as in promotions relating to the titles. Minsc is voiced by Jim Cummings in his original video game appearances, and by Matt Mercer in &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&quot;.

In the storyline, Minsc is a ranger, originally tasked with serving as a bodyguard to the witch Dynaheir as part of a &quot;dajemma&quot; (rite of passage). When Dynaheir is captured by gnolls, Minsc asks the player to help free her, after which both characters are available to assist the player. Eventually, the player&#x27;s party is captured and when Dynaheir is killed by the mage Jon Irenicus, Minsc teams with the player in the pursuit of justice. A berserker, he has a strong desire to uphold good and be heroic, though with an extreme fervor that causes those around him to regard him as possibly insane. His animal companion is a miniature giant space hamster named Boo, with whom he often consults.

Since his introduction, Minsc has been regarded as one of the best and most popular elements of the &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; games because of his demeanor and attachment to Boo, according to reviewers from IGN, GameSpot, and Eurogamer. Other reviewers from publications such as &quot;CVG&quot; have regarded him as one of the greatest aspects of PC gaming, while game developers have noted a preference for him. The web comic &quot;Megatokyo&quot; added Boo as a character in their publication, while Largo (for whom Boo serves in the comic as his long-suffering conscience) took on aspects of Minsc. His absence from subsequent gaming titles has also been lamented by several publications.

==Conception and creation==

Minsc and Boo originated in pen and paper &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; sessions held by the lead designer of &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;, James Ohlen. Played by Cameron Tofer, associate producer and lead programmer of &quot;MDK2&quot;, Minsc was conceived as an unstable comic relief ranger who carried around a pet hamster named Boo in the Dark Sun campaign setting. The lead writer for &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;, Lukas Kristjanson, expanded upon the character and created dialogue intended to make Minsc funny and memorable to the general audience. During development, some of the character&#x27;s lines were rewritten based on the voice actor&#x27;s readings. As this progressed, the writers noted they were able to interject dialogue more freely for Minsc into the script in a tone suitable for the character. In a 2001 interview, BioWare co-founder Ray Muzyka has stated that among the titles the company has completed, Minsc was his favorite character.

Minsc classifies Boo a &quot;miniature giant space hamster&quot;, a creature first mentioned in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; Spelljammer campaign setting which describes them as giant hamsters bred to paddle wheels for flying ships, which can alternatively be bred in miniature form, looking like a normal hamster. Senior designer David Gaider noted that regardless of what Boo was called, Boo had no powers or abilities beyond those of a regular hamster. He also noted that Boo was handled differently from other creatures that served as familiars that would fight alongside their owners, because of the frailty of hamsters and the impact Boo&#x27;s dying would have on Minsc in the game. In an open discussion with BioWare developers, scriptwriter Drew Karpyshyn described Boo&#x27;s role in the game as &quot;[providing] wisdom and moral support to Minsc&quot;.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; video game series===
In &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;, Minsc is a bald, purple-tattooed ranger from the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; country of Rashemen. Originally a berserker on his &quot;dajemma&quot;, a rite of passage to gain entrance to the Ice Dragon Berserker Lodge, he makes an oath to guard the witch Dynaheir, but runs into trouble when he and Dynaheir are ambushed by gnolls, who capture Dynaheir at their stronghold. He orders the player to halt so that Boo may judge them, and requests that the player help him. Following Dynaheir&#x27;s rescue, the player is given an option to add Minsc and Dynaheir to the party that will eventually fight the main antagonist Sarevok.

At the beginning of &quot;Shadows of Amn&quot;, the player&#x27;s party is captured and imprisoned by the mage Jon Irenicus, who seeks to tap into the player&#x27;s power for his own goals. Dynaheir has been slain, so Minsc offers his services to avenge her. Depending on the player&#x27;s choices, it is possible Minsc adopts a new witch in the party; if he does, and the new witch is downed in battle, Minsc goes berserk. In &quot;Throne of Bhaal&quot;, Minsc is a character that can be summoned to assist the player. In the game&#x27;s epilogue, it is revealed that Minsc has returned to Rashemen and has gained access to the Ice Dragon Berserker Lodge, having become a renowned hero due to his experiences with the player. He forms his own adventuring company, the Justice Fist, where he continues to fight evil. In his later years, he journeys across the Realms and disappears.

Larian Studios, developers for the 2023 sequel &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3&quot;, have confirmed that Matthew Mercer is the voice of Minsc. Minsc appears as a minor antagonist and possible party member. He is implanted with a mind-controlling parasite by the main antagonists of the game and manipulated by a doppelganger impersonating his friend and former companion Jaheira. Minsc takes on the name &quot;The Stonelord&quot; and leads a criminal organization in the city of Baldur&#x27;s Gate. Depending on the player character&#x27;s actions he can be snapped out of his brainwashing and recruited as a companion.

===&quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; novelization===
Minsc is a supporting character in the 2000 novelization of &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II: Shadows of Amn&quot; by Philip Athans. He is depicted as a well-built man with long red hair, a patchy orange beard, and a jagged scar along the right side of his head. He is no longer a warrior, and is physically smaller than the novel&#x27;s protagonist, Abdel. In contrast, Boo is unchanged, and is still referred to by Minsc as his miniature giant space hamster. Held prisoner alongside Abdel at the start of the novel, Minsc is set free and accompanies Abdel until they reach an inn, where he decides to work. Abdel repeatedly shows discomfort for his presence, using Minsc&#x27;s employment as an excuse to leave him behind and steal his sword, though he later returns for his help in securing travel aboard a ship. After Abdel returns to kill his employers, Minsc realizes the inn will close permanently; he and Boo leave to find another place to work.

===&quot;Neverwinter&quot; MMO===
In February 2015, it was announced that Minsc and Boo will appear in &quot;Elemental Evil&quot;, a module to the 2013 massively multiplayer online role-playing game &quot;Neverwinter&quot;. The module was released on March 17, 2015.

===Megatokyo===

Boo appears in the webcomic &quot;Megatokyo&quot;, where he wears strapped-on wings and serves as Largo&#x27;s conscience, although he is often misunderstood as he only squeaks. Largo adapts Minsc&#x27;s personality, including his catchphrase, saying &quot;Go for the beer, Boo!&quot; In number 121, Boo leaves Largo but is unable to get his old job back at BioWare.

BioWare&#x27;s Ray Muzyka praised Boo&#x27;s appearance in the comic, describing it as an &quot;anime-style&quot; depiction of a favorite character. For a limited time Boo plush toys modeled after his appearance in the comic were sold by the artists through the website, though production was initially delayed due to manufacturing errors.

===&quot;Battle for Baldur&#x27;s Gate - Dungeon Mayhem&quot; Expansion Pack===
In September 2019, &quot;Dungeon Mayhem&quot;, a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; inspired card game, released its first expansion pack entitled &quot;Battle for Baldur&#x27;s Gate.&quot; The box contains two character card sets, with one featuring Jaheira and the other with Minsc and Boo.

===References in other media===
Minsc and Boo have also been referenced by non-BioWare games and media. In &quot;Dragon Age: Origins&quot;, the loading screen sometimes displays the advice &quot;If all else fails, go for the eyes&quot;. In &quot;Dragon Age Legends&quot;, random NPC&#x27;s use &quot;Go for the eyes!&quot; as a battle cry. In &quot;Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer&quot;, an &quot;Astral Rodent totem&quot; can be found, with the words &quot;For M&quot; carved on it. In &quot;Mass Effect 2&quot;, a &quot;space hamster&quot; is available for purchase. It gives the player a &quot;knowing smile&quot; when observed. One of the game&#x27;s non-playable characters, Tali, shouts &quot;Go for the optics!&quot; to her combat drone. In &quot;Mass Effect 3&quot; Citadel DLC, Commander Shepard finds their hamster being thrown out by one of their foes, and tells the hamster &quot;Sit tight, little guy. If anyone gives you trouble, go for the eyes!&quot; In &quot;Guild Wars Nightfall&quot;, &quot;Go for the eyes!&quot; is the name of a shout command skill used by the Paragon class.

In July 2014, a comic &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Legends of Baldur’s Gate&quot; was announced for October 2014 release. It&#x27;s set generations after &quot;Throne of Bhaal&quot; and features Minsc as the main character. It&#x27;s written by Jim Zub and pencilled by Max Dunbar. It&#x27;s part of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 40th anniversary celebrations.

On March 8, 2015 at PAX East in Boston, Massachusetts, Minsc was used as an NPC &quot;intern&quot; of the player characters in the &quot;Acquisitions Incorporated&quot; celebrity &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; session, to the apparent delight of players Jerry Holkins and Patrick Rothfuss.

In March 2015, Wizkids provided a limited edition promotional card and die of Minsc and Boo as part of their Dungeons &amp; Dragons Dice Masters set &quot;Battle for Faerûn&quot;.

In July 2017, Wizkids released their seventh D&amp;D Icons of the Realms miniature sets, which features a miniature of Minsc (with Boo sitting on his shoulders) as a Medium-sized and of &#x27;Rare&#x27; rarity rating piece of the set.

In the 2017 game &quot;&quot;, the player can, under certain circumstances obtain a rodentlike creature named Bao which grants one fighting bonuses at the expense of intelligence, along with an ability to blind enemies.

In July 2021, Minsc was depicted on a &quot;&quot; trading card in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; themed set &quot;Adventures in the Forgotten Realms&quot;.

==Promotion==
In an interview with &quot;GameSpy&quot;, Lukas Kristjanson acted as Minsc as he gave details about his character background. When asked about the possibility of Minsc and Boo making cameo appearances later BioWare titles, &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II: Throne of Bhaal&quot; lead developer Kevin Martens stated &quot;Well, Minsc is popular. You like Minsc. We like Minsc. Neverwinter is so far away. That is all that I have to say.&quot;

==Reception==
Dan Tudge, project lead for &quot;Dragon Age: Origins&quot;, noted that prior to working for BioWare he would rush home after work to use the character. UGO.com described Minsc as &quot;a beloved game personality&quot;, and lamented the absence of similar characters in later BioWare titles. IGN named Minsc&#x27;s return in &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II&quot; as an aspect of the game they looked forward to, stating &quot;How can you live without Minsc?!&quot; &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; called him the favorite character of many players of the original &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;, citing his strengths and &quot;appealing personality&quot; as reasons for his popularity. Calling him &quot;everyone&#x27;s favorite lovable oaf&quot;, they praised his early presence in the game&#x27;s sequel. Minsc placed seventh in a &quot;Reader&#x27;s Choice&quot; edition of GameSpot&#x27;s &quot;Ten Best Sidekicks&quot;, which noted that the character&#x27;s demeanor and attachment to Boo as reasons for his appeal. Eurogamer named Minsc the best male supporting character in video games for 2001, noting him as additionally one of the most popular characters of the original &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;.

&quot;CVG&quot; listed him as one of their two-hundred reasons to &quot;Love PC Gaming&quot;, quoting one of his battle cries (&quot;Go for the eyes, Boo!&quot;) for their reasoning. He was listed by MSN Entertainment as one of the &quot;Gaming&#x27;s unsung heroes&quot;, saying he &quot;provides great comic relief and is a fondly remembered man.&quot; GameDaily named him one of the Most Lovable Lummoxes in video gaming, stating &quot;Every good party of adventurers in a CRPG needs a tank...In &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;, the human ranger Minsc is that tank, and a valuable asset to the player&#x27;s quest.&quot; Dakota Grabowski of GameZone listed Minsc as the top BioWare created teammate, commenting &quot;His voice-acting was hands-down one of the best attributes of the &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; series&quot; and that &quot;BioWare will never surpass their creation of Minsc (and Boo!).&quot;. Kimberley Wallace of &quot;Game Informer&quot; considered him to be one of the best BioWare characters, saying &quot;If you played Baldur&#x27;s Gate, one character stood out from the pack. ... Strangely enough, this is what makes you love him all the more.&quot; In 2011, &quot;Empire&quot; ranked him and Boo as the 11th greatest video game character, adding that &quot;Few names bring a wistful smile to the faces of aging PC gamers like that of Minsc and his trusty hamster companion&quot;. &quot;GamesTM&quot; named Minsc one of BioWare&#x27;s 8 most memorable companion characters. Andy Kelly from &quot;PC Gamer&quot; named Minsc as his personal favourite BioWare companion, commenting &quot;Minsc is not as rich or nuanced as many of BioWare&#x27;s more recent creations, but he makes up for it with sheer personality&quot;. In a 2017 article, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; staff included Minsc in their definitive list of the best RPG squad mates around.

<text>Australian radio audiences have had virtually no exposure to pirate radio. There were no broadcasts as part of the World War II propaganda campaigns and commercial as well as community stations alongside the taxpayer funded Australian Broadcasting Corporation were available during the mid to late 1980s and early 1990s - a period when the UK was experiencing a surge in illegal broadcasts during the early days of acid house and the Second Summer of Love. The absence of pirate radio in Australia is primarily attributed to the relatively large number of commercial licences that were issued, particularly after World War II, as well as the existence of public (later renamed community) non-commercial broadcasting licences supported mainly by listener subscription. Additionally, the lack of availability of imported broadcasting equipment and the likely application of severe, legislated penalties including jail for offenders, would also have been a factor.

Amateur radio operators must obtain the appropriate licence of the 16 different types of radiocommunications transmitter (narrowcasting) licences available from the Australian Communications &amp; Media Authority to legally operate on a specific frequency. These licences range in cost from less than $50 up to several thousand dollars.

==Occurrences==
A small number of the total pirate radio stations in Australia are documented.
* 2 May 1948: “D.I.G., the Diggers&#x27; Station” broadcasts an anti-Communist message for 24 minutes, and in the process jams Melbourne commercial station 3UZ for 10 minutes. Over the next 10 days other commercial stations were jammed. Ricardo Blackburn was prosecuted and fined £30. He said he was a member of an organisation of mostly returned soldiers known as Crusaders of Freedom, led by Alec Sutter. Its aim was to encourage trade unionists to attend union meetings and thus outvote the Communists at those meetings.
* Early to mid-1960s: Bruce Jackson and friends from Vaucluse High School were raided by the Postmaster-General&#x27;s Department for operating an AM pirate station that unbeknown to them covered all of Sydney.
* 1966: Radio Prosh transmits from a ship in international waters off Kangaroo Island. Ernie Sigley plays host.The PMG jams the signal from the mainland. A number of protests result but the station is short lived.
* Early 1970s: University students and draft resisters, protesting against conscription in Australia and the Vietnam War, set up pirate radio stations broadcasting on the AM band called &quot;Radio Draft Resistance&quot; at Sydney and Melbourne Universities for short periods of time.
* December 1986: A series of test broadcasts from a radio station calling itself Radio Uranus was heard in Melbourne on 98.4 MHz. They said that they were preparing for a major broadcast on Christmas Eve. The test broadcasts consisted of two people (possibly the station&#x27;s founders) playing music and talking in between tracks. The second test broadcast sounded like they were on a boat, as a boat engine could clearly be heard in the background, and they may have even said that they were on a boat or ship.
* 18–19 November 1989: Radio Uranus was heard once again, with another series of test broadcasts, one on each day, heard on 97.7 MHz. It was not until 5:00 p.m. on 19 November, when the test broadcast ended and a proper broadcast began, that the identity of the station was known. The broadcast consisted of the same format of music and talk as in 1986. According to the presenters, they were using a 10 kW transmitter located in Kinglake, in the outer east of Melbourne. They also hinted a TV broadcast next year, but that never happened. The transmission even featured a cross to their &#x27;stereo cruiser&#x27; located near the city. The broadcast ended suddenly some time after 8:30 p.m. when the presenters interrupted the song being played to say that they were raided. Mentions of rebroadcasts to Fiji suggest HF may have occurred.
* 1990s: Two pirates broadcasting on shortwave from Australia were heard worldwide. The stations were called Radio G&#x27;day and Tasmania Radio Int.
* 1991: An FM pirate radio station called &quot;Radio Heinz&quot; broadcast from Wangaratta, with a power of 50W for three months. The station played entire music albums with voice announcements in between. It gained rapid popularity as an alternative to the 3NE commercial station and WPR-FM community radio station, until it was forced to shut down.
* 1992: A short range radio broadcaster calling itself Rex FM broadcasts in the Ballarat central business district at intermittent intervals over the course of a fortnight. The format is music and talk.
* 30 December 1992: A pirate radio station calling itself 3PPP was heard on the FM band in the inner suburbs of Melbourne from before 10:30 p.m. till some time after midnight. The broadcast featured music and talk.
* 2001: Radio Eureka made several broadcasts with power of approximately 12 Watts on frequency 6235 kHz.
* 2006: March–November. Jason Tresize operated a transmitter on frequency 105.7 MHz of 25 Watts serving the Bendigo region. Although being issued a caution notice, Tresize went on to operate until finally ceasing operations in 2011.
*2007: At the age of 12, Tim Wong See operated a pirate radio station called &#x27;2FT&#x27; from his home in West Pennant Hills before the ACMA shut it down.
* 2008: April–September. 105.7 MHz was heard once again in the Bendigo region. The broadcast consisted mainly of dance music with regular hosts, including live from the &quot;Bathroom Nightclub.&quot;
* 2011: August–November. 105.7 MHz was heard yet again in the Bendigo region, This time on 40 Watts and playing predominately dance music. The station was closed by the Australian Communications &amp; Media Authority consequently having equipment seized.
* 2011: 25 September-5 October. A station was heard in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne on 1485 kHz on several evenings commencing 25 September. The station carried a rebroadcast of My MP, a digital only commercial radio station. On 5 October, the Australian Communications and Media Authority reported that it shut down an unlicensed AM radio station operating on 1485 kHz from Chadstone following a complaint.
* 2011: -December. Andrew Drysdale broadcast ABD Radio from his Chatswood, NSW home until shut down in December, 2011.
* 2015: Terence Sulman operated a transmitter on 101.3 MHz in Portland, Victoria. Sulman was convicted, fined $600 and was ordered to forfeit all radio equipment, after pleading guilty in the Portland Magistrates Court. According to ACMA, Sulman &quot;was trying to offer something like a local commercial radio station, so he sold advertising and sponsorship to local businesses&quot;, hence ACMA&#x27;s decision to seek prosecution.
*2016: 29 February. Dan Morris&#x27;s West Wollongong home was raided by the ACMA to shut down his pirate station IRIE FM. In January he was interviewed for Vice.com in an article, titled &#x27;Meet Australia&#x27;s Preeminent Jamaican Pirate Radio Broadcaster&#x27;. It proved to be his undoing, after the ACMA saw it and investigated. Magistrate Michael Stoddart fined Morris a total of $3,000 and ordered the transmitter be forfeited.
* 2017: 31 January. Following the closure of Radio Australia&#x27;s domestic shortwave service a pirate was heard broadcasting on the newly vacated frequency of 4835 kHz. The content was of a protest nature including audio grabs of Tony Abbott stating there would be no cuts to the ABC&#x27;s funding.
* 2022: July-November. A station was heard in the western suburbs of Melbourne, occasionally operating on the frequency 108.0 MHz during the evenings. The broadcasts mainly consisted of songs by the band Rage Against the Machine, Atlanta rapper 21 Savage and the Soviet band Kino.
* 2019-2025 - Reggae Trojan Radio Newcastle NSW - This pirate radio station has been on air since 2019, originally broadcasting from Lambton, it was moved to a location near to the corner of Elizabeth Street and Maitland Road Tighes Hill. There is a playlist on Spotify called &quot;89.3 Newcastle by Louie Durham&quot; matching music played by the station. The station has been praised by listeners on Reddit as a good alternative to the mainstream stations. After going off-air for some time, Trojan Radio returned in late 2024, pleasing the listeners of Newcastle. However, on 28 February 2025, the Australian Communications and Media Authority finally shut down the station and confiscated the transmitter responsible, ending Trojan Radio 89.3 FM after 6 years of broadcasting, upsetting loyal listeners. Luckily though, the operator behind the station managed to escape a hefty fine.

<doc id="1030285" wikidata="Q8016998" url="?curid=1030285" title="William Ponsonby, 1st Baron Ponsonby">
<text>William Brabazon Ponsonby, 1st Baron Ponsonby (of Imokilly), (15 September 17445 November 1806) was a leading Irish Whig politician, being a member of the Irish House of Commons, and, after 1800, of the United Kingdom parliament. Ponsonby was the son of the Hon. John Ponsonby, the Speaker of the Irish House of Commons and Lady Elizabeth Cavendish, daughter of the 3rd Duke of Devonshire. He was invested as a Privy Counsellor of Ireland in 1784. He served as Joint Postmaster-General of Ireland (1784–1789).

==Political career==
Ponsonby was educated at Pembroke College, Cambridge. He represented Cork City between 1764 and 1776 and thereafter Bandonbridge between 1776 and 1783. He was the leader of a powerful family grouping of between ten and fourteen MPs, the second largest in the Irish House of Commons. During the regency crisis of 1788–89, he gave his support to the Prince of Wales in opposition to William Pitt the Younger. As a consequence, he was dismissed from the Post Office. Thereafter he permanently aligned himself with Charles James Fox and together with his brother George gathered together the various small groups of Irish whigs into a unified opposition. As with their English counterparts, their ultimate objective was to re-establish the influence of the landowning classes at the expense of the crown. Ponsonby became committed to the cause of Catholic Emancipation, as a means of securing a loyal population at a time of radical agitation and potential foreign invasion.

Pitt&#x27;s coalition with the Portland whigs in July 1794 and Earl FitzWilliam&#x27;s consequent appointment as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland gave Ponsonby and his allies an opportunity to regain office. He was on the brink of becoming Irish secretary of state and had sat on the Treasury bench. In 1795, however, he appears to have persuaded FitzWilliam to dismiss John Beresford from his post as first commissioner of the revenue on the grounds of alleged corruption, apparently in revenge for earlier political dealings. The subsequent political crisis led in 1795 to FitzWilliam&#x27;s swift removal from office, Beresford&#x27;s reinstatement, and to Ponsonby&#x27;s humiliating return to opposition.

Ponsonby was a leading opponent of the union between Ireland and Great Britain. In 1783, he stood for Newtownards and County Kilkenny. He chose the latter constituency and sat for it from 1783 until the Act of Union came into force in 1801. He became then part of the Foxite Whig opposition in the Westminster House of Commons, voting against the Addington and Pitt ministries and in favour of the Prince of Wales and Catholic Emancipation. His influence was declining, however, and by 1803 effective leadership of the Irish whigs had passed to his brother George.

==Peerage==
By the time Fox regained office in 1806 as member of Grenville&#x27;s Ministry of All the Talents, Ponsonby&#x27;s health was poor, with the result that his wife urgently pressed his claims for a peerage, arguing that it was merited by his opposition to the Regency Bill and the Union, and by his staunch support for the Foxite whigs at Westminster. As a consequence, he was raised swiftly to the peerage of the United Kingdom on 13 March 1806. He was gazetted as &#x27;Baron Ponsonby, of Imokilly in the County of Cork&#x27;, although other sources generally refer to him as &#x27;Baron Ponsonby of Imokilly&#x27;. He died in Seymour Street, London, on 5 November 1806, and was buried in Ireland.

==Testimonials==
At a personal level Edmund Burke described Ponsonby in a letter to Lord Charlemont as &quot;a manly, decided character, with ... a clear and vigorous understanding.&quot; He was as interested in sport as he was in politics and was said to have kept &#x27;the best hunting establishment in Ireland&#x27; at Bishopscourt, his seat in County Kildare, where it was also reported that he lived &#x27;in the most hospitable and princely style&#x27; (Cokayne, &quot;The Complete Peerage&quot;). In addition, he was easily irritated, especially if his status and pretensions went unacknowledged. Thus, although he took a leading part in creating a whig opposition in Ireland in the 1790s, he overplayed his hand under FitzWilliam, and his effectiveness was thereafter limited.

==Family==

In 1769 Ponsonby married Louisa Molesworth (1749–1824), 4th daughter of the 3rd Viscount Molesworth, and his second wife, Mary Usher. They had five sons, four of whom were men of note and one daughter.

# John Ponsonby, 1st Viscount Ponsonby, was a diplomat
# Hon. Sir William Ponsonby, a major-general in the army was killed at the Battle of Waterloo
# Richard Ponsonby, became bishop of Killaloe and Kilfenora in 1828, Derry in 1831 and Derry and Raphoe in 1834; 
# George Ponsonby was a Member of Parliament and Junior Lord of the Treasury.
# Mary was married to the Prime Minister, Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey.

Ponsonby&#x27;s descendants include Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax, Sir Alec Douglas-Home and Prince William of Wales.

<text>Ferdinand Frédéric Henri Moissan (; 28 September 1852 – 20 February 1907) was a French chemist and pharmacist who won the 1906 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work in isolating fluorine from its compounds. Moissan was one of the original members of the International Atomic Weights Committee.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Moissan was born in Paris on 28 September 1852, the son of a minor officer of the Eastern Railway Company, Francis Ferdinand Moissan, and a seamstress, Joséphine Améraldine (née Mitel). His mother was of Jewish descent, his father was not. In 1864 they moved to Meaux, where he attended the local school. During this time, Moissan became an apprentice clockmaker. However, in 1870, Moissan and his family moved back to Paris due to war against Prussia. Moissan was unable to receive the &quot;grade universitaire&quot; necessary to attend university. After spending a year in the army, he enrolled at the Ecole Superieure de Pharmacie de Paris.

===Scientific career===
Moissan became a trainee in pharmacy in 1871 and in 1872 he began working for a chemist in Paris, where he was able to save a person poisoned with arsenic. He decided to study chemistry and began first in the laboratory of Edmond Frémy at the Musée d’Histoire Naturelle, and later in that of Pierre Paul Dehérain at the École Pratique des Haute Études. Dehérain persuaded him to pursue an academic career. He passed the baccalauréat, which was necessary to study at university, in 1874 after an earlier failed attempt. He also became qualified as first-class pharmacist at the École Supérieure de Pharmacie in 1879, and received his doctoral degree there in 1880.

He soon climbed through the ranks of the School of Pharmacy, and was appointed Assistant Lecturer, Senior Demonstrator, and finally Professor of Toxicology by 1886. He took the Chair of Inorganic Chemistry in 1899. The following year, he succeeded Louis Joseph Troost as Professor of Inorganic Chemistry at the Sorbonne. During his time in Paris he became a friend of the chemist Alexandre Léon Étard and the botanist Vasque. 
His marriage, to Léonie Lugan, took place in 1882. They had a son in 1885, named Louis Ferdinand Henri.

===Death===
Moissan died suddenly in Paris in February 1907, shortly after his return from receiving the Nobel Prize in Stockholm. His death was attributed to an acute case of appendicitis, however, there is speculation that repeated exposure to fluorine and carbon monoxide also contributed to his death. 

=== Awards and honors ===
During his extensive career, Moissan authored more than three hundred publications, won the 1906 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the first isolation of fluorine, in addition to the Prix Lucaze, the Davy Medal, the Hofmann Medal, and the Elliott Cresson Medal. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society and The Chemical Society of London, served on the International Atomic Weights Committee and made a &quot;commandeur&quot; in the Légion d&#x27;honneur.

== Research ==

Moissan published his first scientific paper, about carbon dioxide and oxygen metabolism in plants, with Dehérain in 1874. He left plant physiology and then turned towards inorganic chemistry; subsequently his research on pyrophoric iron was well received by the two most prominent French inorganic chemists of that time, Henri Étienne Sainte-Claire Deville and Jules Henri Debray. After Moissan received his Ph.D. on cyanogen and its reactions to form cyanures in 1880, his friend Landrine offered him a position at an analytic laboratory.

=== Isolation of fluorine ===

During the 1880s, Moissan focused on fluorine chemistry and especially the production of fluorine itself. The existence of the element had been well known for many years, but all attempts to isolate it had failed, and some experimenters had died in the attempt.
He had no laboratory of his own, but borrowed lab space from others, including Charles Friedel. There he had access to a strong battery consisting of 90 Bunsen cells which made it possible to observe a gas produced by the electrolysis of molten arsenic trichloride; the gas was reabsorbed by the arsenic trichloride.

Moissan eventually succeeded in isolating fluorine in 1886 by the electrolysis of a solution of potassium hydrogen difluoride (KHF2) in liquid hydrogen fluoride (HF). The mixture was necessary because hydrogen fluoride is a nonconductor. The device was built with platinum-iridium electrodes in a platinum holder and the apparatus was cooled to −50 °C. The result was the complete separation of the hydrogen produced at the negative electrode from the fluorine produced at the positive one, first achieved on 26 June 1886. This remains the current standard method for commercial fluorine production. The French Academy of Science sent three representatives, Marcellin Berthelot, Henri Debray, and Edmond Frémy, to verify the results, but Moissan was unable to reproduce them, owing to the absence from the hydrogen fluoride of traces of potassium fluoride present in the previous experiments. After resolving the problem and demonstrating the production of fluorine several times, he was awarded a prize of 10,000 francs. For the first successful isolation, he was awarded the 1906 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Following his grand achievement, his research focused on characterizing fluorine&#x27;s chemistry. He discovered numerous fluorine compounds, such as (together with Paul Lebeau) sulfur hexafluoride in 1901.

====Further studies====

Moissan contributed to the development of the electric arc furnace, which opened several paths to developing and preparing new compounds, and attempted to use pressure to produce synthetic diamonds from the more common form of carbon. He also used the furnace to synthesize the borides and carbides of numerous elements. Calcium carbide was a noticeable accomplishment as this paved the way for the development of the chemistry of acetylene. In 1893, Moissan began studying fragments of a meteorite found in Meteor Crater near Diablo Canyon in Arizona. In these fragments he discovered minute quantities of a new mineral and, after extensive research, Moissan concluded that this mineral was made of silicon carbide. In 1905, this mineral was named moissanite, in his honor. In 1903 Moissan was elected member of the International Atomic Weights Committee where he served until his death.

<text>Nikolay Dmitriyevich Zelinsky (; ; – 31 July 1953) was a Russian and Soviet chemist and educator. He was a professor at Moscow University from 1893 and an academician of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union (1929).

Zelinsky studied at the University of Odessa and at the universities of Leipzig and Göttingen in Germany. Zelinsky was one of the founders of theory on organic catalysis. He was the inventor of the first effective filtering activated charcoal gas mask in the world (1915).

==Life==
Nikolai Zelinsky was born on in Tiraspol in a noble family. His father Dmitry Osipovich Zelinsky, who came from hereditary Volhynian nobles, died of rapidly developing consumption in 1863; two years later his mother died of the same disease. The orphaned boy was left in the care of his grandmother M.P. Vasilyeva and he spent his childhood in her village.

At the age of ten, Nikolai Zelinsky entered the Tiraspol district school for two-year courses to prepare for entering the gymnasium. Having completed them ahead of schedule at the age of 11, he entered the second grade of Odessa Richelieu Gymnasium.

After graduating from the gymnasium in 1880, Zelinsky entered the natural science department of the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of the Novorossiysk University, and graduated in 1884. He was given an appointment at the university and was sent to Germany. He did research for two years (1885–1887), first he worked in the laboratory of Johannes Wislicenus in Leipzig. Then he performed a study of a new reaction in the laboratory of Viktor Meyer in Göttingen, which led to severe poisoning himself with mustard gas, which had not been studied enough by that time. In 1887 he was appointed Privatdozent in the Department of Chemistry at the Novorossiysk University. In 1888, he passed the master&#x27;s exam, and in 1889, he defended his master&#x27;s thesis (&quot;On the issue of Isomer in the thiophene series&quot;), and in 1891, he defended his doctoral thesis (&quot;Investigation of the phenomena of isomerism in the series of limiting carbon compounds&quot;).

He was invited to Moscow University on the initiative of Dmitri Mendeleev. He was a professor at Moscow University from 1893 until his death, with the exception of the period 1911–1917. From 1893, he became an extraordinary professor at the Department of Organic Chemistry, and from 1902, he was an ordinary professor.

In 1911, he left the university with a group of scientists in protest against the policy of the tsarist Minister of Education Lev Kasso. From 1911 to 1917, he worked as a professor at the St. Petersburg Polytechnic Institute.
In 1917, he returned to Moscow University. There, he was a professor of the Department of Chemistry (1917–1929) of the Physics and Mathematics Faculty, then he became the head of the Department of Organic Chemistry (1929–1930 and 1933–1938), head of the Department of Petroleum Chemistry (1938–1953), and head of the Laboratory of Antibiotics and Biogenic Bases (1950–1953) of the Faculty of Chemistry. Also, he was the head of the Department of Organic Chemistry of the Chemical Department (1932–1933).

From 1935, he actively participated in the organization of the Institute of Organic Chemistry of the USSR Academy of Sciences, later he headed a number of its laboratories.

On 10 July, 1941 Zelinsky joined the Scientific and Technical Council for the development and testing of scientific works related to military defense, chaired by the authorized State Defense Committee, Professor Sergei Kaftanov. During the Great Patriotic War, he worked in evacuation until the summer of 1943. Zelinsky took part in work to improve the quality of aviation gasolines and lubricating oils. A new process has been developed to produce high octane fuel; new catalysts were found for the processes of aromatization of oil and the production of defense products. Under the leadership of Zelinsky, the process of catalytic cracking of oil was studied in detail with the determination of the chemical nature of its products by spectral methods. Zelinsky also supervised work on finding ways to rationally use the products of primary processing of solid fuels - coal, shale and peat. In this regard, the problem of separation of sulfur from shale resins has become important. Shale accounted for about three-quarters of the fuel reserves of the USSR, but their high sulfur content depreciated them as a raw material for motor fuel. During the war years Zelinsky found a solution to this problem by passing shale oils mixed with hydrogen over platinum or nickel on aluminum oxide at 300 °. Sulfur was removed as hydrogen sulfide. The development of petrochemistry in the USSR has led to a radical reconstruction of the oil refining industry for the production of artificial liquid fuel. As a result of scientific research, it has become possible to use not only liquid, but also solid fossil fuels as a valuable raw material for high-octane motor fuel and high-quality lubricant oils. Thus, the necessary prerequisites were created for processing the richest coal resources of Western Siberia, coal and natural gas from Ukhta and Pechora and other areas remote from the front into motor fuel.

Nikolai Zelinsky died on July 31, 1953. He was buried in Moscow at the Novodevichy Cemetery (Division 1), and a headstone was made by Nilolai Nikoghosyan.

==Scientific activity==
Zelinsky&#x27;s scientific activity was very versatile: his works on the chemistry of thiophene and the stereochemistry of organic dibasic acids are widely known. In the summer of 1891, Zelinsky participated in an expedition to survey the waters of the Black Sea and the Odessa estuaries on the gunboat Zaporozhets, where he proved for the first time that the hydrogen sulfide contained in the water was of bacterial origin. During the period of life and work in Odessa, Nikolai Zelinsky wrote 40 scientific papers.

A number of his works were also devoted to electrical conductivity in non-aqueous solutions and to the chemistry of amino acids, but his main works were related to the chemistry of hydrocarbons and organic catalysis.

In 1895–1907 he was the first to synthesize a number of cyclopentane and cyclohexane hydrocarbons, which served as standards for studying the chemical composition and the basis for artificial modeling of oil and oil fractions.

In 1910 he discovered the phenomenon of dehydrogenation catalysis, which consists in the exclusively selective action of platinum and palladium on cyclohexane and aromatic hydrocarbons and in the ideal reversibility of hydro- and dehydrogenation reactions only depending on temperature. In 1911 he carried out a smooth dehydrogenation of cyclohexane and its homologues into aromatic hydrocarbons in the presence of platinum and palladium catalysts; he widely used this reaction to determine the content of cyclohexane hydrocarbons in gasoline and kerosene fractions of oil (1920–1930), and also as an industrial method for obtaining aromatic hydrocarbons from oil. These Zelinsky’s studies underlie the modern processes of catalytic reforming of petroleum fractions.

Subsequent research led Zelinsky and his students to the discovery of the reaction of hydrogenolysis of cyclopentane hydrocarbons with their transformation into alkanes in the presence of platinized coal and excess hydrogen in 1934.

In 1915, Zelinsky successfully used oxide catalysts for oil cracking, which led to a decrease in the process temperature and an increase in the yield of aromatic hydrocarbons. In 1918–1919, he developed a method for producing gasoline by solar oil and petroleum cracking in the presence of aluminum chloride and aluminum bromide; the implementation of this method on an industrial scale played an important role in providing gasoline to the Soviet state. Zelinsky improved the reaction of catalytic conversion of acetylene into benzene by suggesting the use of activated carbon as a catalyst. Zelinsky and his students also studied the dehydrogenation of paraffins and olefins in the presence of oxide catalysts.

Being a supporter of the theory of the organic origin of oil, Zelinsky conducted a series of studies to connect its genesis with sapropels, oil shale and other natural and synthetic organic substances.

Zelinsky and his students proved the intermediate formation of methylene radicals in many heterogeneous catalytic reactions: in the decomposition of cyclohexane, in the synthesis of hydrocarbons from carbon monoxide and hydrogen on a cobalt catalyst, in the reactions of hydrocondensation of olefins with carbon monoxide and hydropolymerization of olefins in the presence of small amounts of oxide carbon which were discovered by him.

The works of Zelinsky and his scientific team on the adsorption of gases on activated carbons were important for the country&#x27;s defense ability, the creation of a coal gas mask in cooperation with Kumant (1915) and its adoption during the First World War in the Russian and allied armies were significant for the country&#x27;s defense ability.

==Pedagogical activity==
Zelinsky created a large scientific school and its scientists made fundamental contributions to various fields of chemistry. Among his students werw Academicians of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR A. A. Balandin, L. F. Vereshchagin, B. A. Kazansky, K. A. Kocheshkov, S. S. Nametkin, A. N. Nesmeyanov; Corresponding Members of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR N. A. Izgaryshev, K. P. Lavrovsky, Yu. G. Mamedaliev, B. M. Mikhailov, A. V. Rakovsky, V. V. Chelintsev, N. I. Shuikin; professors V. V. Longinov, A. E. Uspensky, L. A. Chugaev, N. A. Shilov, V. A. Nekrasova-Popova and others.

N. D. Zelinsky - one of the organizers of the All-Union Chemical Society named after D. I. Mendeleev; since 1941 he was its honorary member. Since 1921 - an honorary member of the Moscow Society of Naturalists, since 1935 he was its president.

<doc id="1030291" wikidata="Q1195310" url="?curid=1030291" title="Bardiche">
<text>A bardiche , berdiche, bardische, bardeche, or berdish is a type of polearm used from the 14th to 17th centuries in Europe. Ultimately a descendant of the medieval sparth axe or Dane axe, the bardiche proper appears around 1400, but there are numerous medieval manuscripts that depict very similar weapons beginning c. 1250. The bardiche differs from the halberd in having neither a hook at the back nor a spear point at the top. The use of bardiches started in early 14th-century Austria.

In the 16th century the bardiche was associated with the streltsy, arquebusiers of Imperial Russia established by Ivan the Terrible.

==Description==
The blade varied greatly in shape, but was most often a long, cleaver-type blade. The distinction was in how the blade was attached to the pole. The bardiche blade was attached to the pole either via two sockets (one at the top of the pole and one lower, at the base of the blade) or one socket at the top and one surface mount at the base, effectively mounting the heavy blade to the wooden shaft. This construction is also seen in Scottish polearms, such as the Lochaber axe and Jeddart staff, and bardiches are known to have been imported into Scotland in the 16th and 17th centuries. Depending on the design of the particular weapons in question, at times a bardiche may greatly resemble a voulge.

While the blade was often very long for an axe (usually exceeding 2 feet (60 cm)) the shaft was one of the shortest of all polearms; rarely did it exceed 5 feet (1.5 m) in length. It relied more on the weight of its heavy blade to do the damage than a swing from a long pole. This makes the bardiche more similar to the Dane axe, in some respects, than to a true polearm.

==Use==
In pre-imperial Russia and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, this weapon was used to rest handguns upon when firing. It was standard equipment for the streltsy (on foot, mounted, and dragoon units) and also for the infantry of the Commonwealth; a shorter version was invented by John III Sobieski, ruler of the Commonwealth.

<doc id="1030293" wikidata="Q431766" url="?curid=1030293" title="J. Millard Tawes">
<text>John Millard Tawes (April 8, 1894June 25, 1979), was an American politician and a member of the Democratic Party who was the 54th Governor of Maryland from 1959 to 1967. He remains the only Marylander to be elected to the three positions of State Treasurer, Comptroller, and governor.

==Early life and family==
Tawes was born to James and Alice (née Byrd) Tawes in Crisfield, Maryland. He received his early education in the Somerset County, Maryland, public schools, and later attended Bryant and Stratton Business College where he studied banking and accounting. After college, Tawes earned a living working in lumbering and canning firms that were owned by his father, which later expanded into shipbuilding, baking, and banking. Tawes married Helen Avalynne Gibson on December 25, 1915; with her he had two children.

==Maryland political career==
Tawes&#x27; political career began in 1930 when he was elected as clerk of the court for Somerset County, Maryland, narrowly defeating his opponent Harry T. Phoebus by 72 votes. After winning re-election in 1934, Tawes pursued state office. In 1938, he was elected Comptroller of Maryland, defeating Republican rival William G. Jack by 140,000 votes. Under Tawes, the state budget of Maryland nearly quadrupled in just six years. He was re-elected as Comptroller in 1942.

In 1946, Tawes ran for governor of Maryland but lost to William Preston Lane, Jr. in the Democratic primary. Tawes initially retired, but was appointed by Governor Lane to serve as a State Banking Commissioner in 1947. Tawes held that position until 1950, when he was appointed Comptroller to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of James J. Lacy. He was re-elected to the office in 1950 and 1954.

==Governor of Maryland==

In 1958, polling among Marylanders showed that Tawes was quite popular. This led Tawes to announce, for the second time, his candidacy for governor. He faced minor opposition in the primary, and defeated Republican James Devereux, a Congressman and veteran of World War II, by approximately 200,000 votes in the general election. On January 14, 1959, he was sworn in for his first term.

The beginning of Tawes&#x27; term as governor was benefited by the overwhelming Democratic majority present in both houses of the Maryland General Assembly. Seeking to improve the state&#x27;s economy following a recession in 1958, Tawes established extensive departments and agencies that primarily regulated and assisted agriculture, industry, and the economy in general. He also established organizations to deal with the elderly, insurance, savings and loans, and justice. Seeking to improve the highway system, Tawes create the State Roads Commission that added over a thousand miles of major roads and highways to the state. Concerning environmental matters, Tawes established programs to help the oyster population within the Chesapeake Bay, established several island nature reserves, and doubled the size of the state park system. He also worked towards reducing water pollution and saving forests from destruction. Tawes also sought to phase out slot machines in Maryland, which was completed after he left office in 1968.

Regarding education, the state of Maryland saw significant strides in areas including the expansion of the University System of Maryland, the establishment of public educational television channels, and the creation of state agencies encouraging educational loans. Tawes would later remark that the educational strides under his administration should be regarded as the greatest accomplishment.

One of the major constitutional concerns during the Tawes Administration came from the reapportionment of districts within the state. When Maryland was granted an extra Congressional seat following the 1960 census, years of unsuccessful attempts to redraw the state districts resulted in a federal jury of three judges redrawing the boundaries in 1966. Regarding the General Assembly districts, Tawes oversaw the shift of power from the rural areas to the urban. Ever since the American Revolution, representation in the General Assembly was divided evenly for all counties, which meant the more numerous rural counties dominated politically. Following the series of &quot;one man, one vote&quot; decrees by the Supreme Court of the United States, a lower court in Maryland ruled the General Assembly districts unconstitutional. Tawes, a rural county politician himself, called the General Assembly into special session to redraw the districts, resulting in a substantial gain in representation in the State Senate and House of Delegates for the urban areas of the state for the first time.

In the election of 1962, Tawes faced substantial competition in the primary from David Hume, a critic of Tawes&#x27; conservation policies, and businessman George P. Mahoney. While both Hume and Mahoney polled impressively, Tawes managed to retain the Democratic nomination. His challenger in the general election, Congressman Frank Small, Jr., lost to Tawes by a margin of 78,000 votes, primarily due to Small&#x27;s poorly managed campaign. Tawes&#x27; second administration began on January 9, 1963.

The Civil Rights Movement in the United States took place during the Tawes Administration. While Tawes was publicly neither strongly for or against discrimination, Maryland became the first state south of the Mason–Dixon line to enact a public accommodations laws under his administration, and he also directed the state government and its contractors to conduct anti-discriminatory hiring practices.

Many of the themes Tawes began in his first term were continued in his second, including educational reform. The allocation of state aid to educational institutions was recalculated by the legislature during his second term, resulting in increased funds being directed towards the most needy districts. Tawes also managed to establish an educational television network, which he had been campaigning for since his first term.

While Tawes had always maintained a platform of fiscal conservatism, spending by the state government doubled under his administration from approximately $448 million to over $1 billion. His final years in office involved the initiation of the review of the Maryland Constitution of 1867, and the establishment of commissions to remove areas of waste within the government. Both of these measures would not come to fruition until after he left office. Tawes&#x27;s tenure as governor ended on January 25, 1967.

==Later life==
When Tawes left his office as governor, he was given a 1967 Cadillac Fleetwood as a gift from his supporters. Soon after he was elected by the people of Somerset County to represent them in the Maryland Constitutional Convention of 1967/68. Tawes was voted honorary president by the members of the convention, but remained silent during the proceedings as to not give the impression of a conflict of interest. After all, it was Tawes who called for the convention whilst governor.

After the signing of the Constitutional ratifications, Tawes was appointed by his successor, Governor Spiro Agnew, to serve as Chairman of the Board of Natural Resources. Agnew&#x27;s successor, Marvin Mandel, appointed Tawes as Secretary of the newly created Department of Natural Resources, where he served as an advocate for the protection and nurturing of Maryland&#x27;s environment. Tawes&#x27; final service to the state came as Treasurer of Maryland, where he was chosen to fill an unexpired term from 1973 to 1975.

Tawes was found unconscious at his home in Crisfield on June 25, 1979, from what appeared to be a heart attack. After spending nearly an hour attempting to revive him, ambulance personnel and doctors on the scene determined that he could not be saved. He had been admitted to the hospital a month before complaining of chest pains, and two weeks prior due to a mild heart attack.

Following his death, Tawes was reflected upon as a moderate and calm political figure. While publicly seen as weak due to his age and often indirect administration methods, Tawes was capable of pushing legislation through the General Assembly when necessary, though he was not always eager to do so. He was also capable of appealing to both sides of an issue by maintaining a moderate record. Before his death, Tawes noted his proudest accomplishments revolved around leaving a state government that was fiscally sound, and also for improving the education system and establishing community colleges. He is buried in Sunny Ridge Memorial Park in his hometown of Crisfield.

<doc id="1030310" wikidata="Q7197838" url="?curid=1030310" title="Pirate radio in Europe">
<text>Pirate radio in Europe emerged as unlicensed radio broadcasting stations, often operating from offshore vessels or undisclosed land-based locations. The phenomenon began in the mid-20th century and became widespread in the 1960s and 1970s, gaining popularity in countries such as Denmark, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Offering alternative music and content across the British Isles and continental Europe, pirate radio challenged government control of the airwaves in the region until changes in legislation either legalised or shut down these stations. Despite suppression, pirate radio left a lasting cultural impact on European broadcasting.

== Denmark ==
*1958
::Radio Mercur begins transmissions from the MV Cheeta on 2 August.

*1961
::DCR (Danmarks Commercielle Radio) begins transmissions from the MV Lucky Star on 15 September. DCR later united with Radio Mercur.

*1962
::Radio Mercur ends transmissions due to a Danish law that prohibits assistance to illegal broadcasting directed to a Danish audience.

*2006
::Pirat radio 69 was located in the activist house &quot;Ungdomshuset&quot; in Copenhagen from 14 December 2006 to 1 March 2007.

*2012
::Byens Radio started broadcasting in central, Northern and Southern Copenhagen with micro powered radio equipment, inspired by Mbanna Kantako and his family from humanrightsradio.net (Springfield, Illinois, USA). It went on a week-long break starting mid-February 2012 after a detection van was spotted near the broadcasting site. As of 15 May 2012, Byens Radio has been broadcasting for the second longest period of time, for a pirate radio station in Denmark. The longest being Radio Mercur. Though it is the longest lasting non-commercial pirate radio station in the history of Denmark.
::The leftwing activist website Modkraft.dk has evidence that Byens Radio broadcast from 31 December. The police&#x27;s detection van never got close enough to stop the actual broadcasting but only encouraged the activist group behind the radio to move the broadcasting site elsewhere in order to avoid getting evicted. By moving from one base to another several times, the broadcasters were never found. Many newspaper articles and web sites document its existence and some of the original broadcasting is represented online. Byens Radio resumed transmission as of 4 November 2013.

== France (history of pirate radio) ==
The first wave was a political movement based mainly within French territory. Most of these stations were short-lived. The first wave included Radio Verte, Radio Ivre, Radio Active and Radio Lorraine Coeur d&#x27;Acier. A few, such as Radio Verte Fessenheim became licensed stations.
* 1978
In January 1978, the DST arrested eleven people accused of radio piracy. In May, the President of the Republic, Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing asked the government to put an end to pirate radio stations. On 17 May, the Lecat law confirmed the monopoly of state radio stations and toughened the penalties for offenders.

* 1981-1983
The socialist opposition supports the fight of free radios for freedom of expression without promising the end of the monopoly. In 1981, after the election of François Mitterrand, the law of 29 July 1982 on audiovisual communication abolishes the state monopoly and authorizes free radios. In February 1983, 22 stations obtained authorization to broadcast in Paris.
From 1982, a High Authority for Audiovisual Communication was created and replaced in 1986 by the National Commission for Communication and Liberties (CNCL). The frequency authorizations issued by the CNCL in 1987 are the subject of several scandals: several commercial stations to the detriment of free radios and non-commercial associative radios; but also the lack of transparency in the choice of frequencies. A small associative station, Radio Laser, which is one of the radio stations excluded, thus initiates a lawsuit against Radio Courtoisie for &quot;active corruption&quot; of the CNCL and the members of the CNCL are at the same time prosecuted for &quot;confiscation&quot;. Weakened by these controversies, the CNCL was replaced in 1989 by the Superior Council of the Audiovisual which obtains increased competences, a greater independence of action in order to regulate the allocation of frequencies, ensure the quality of transmissions and better legal support to apply these decisions.

== Netherlands==
(See also Belgium)

*1960–1974
::Radio Veronica transmitted in Dutch on AM mediumwave (192 meter, 1562 kHz; later 538 meter, 557 kHz) from the MV Borkum Riff and after 1965 from the MV Norderney in international waters off the coast of Scheveningen, and soon became the most popular radio station in the Netherlands. Broadcasts were targeted to the Netherlands only, transmitting power was deliberately kept moderate to avoid interference with international radio stations. Most broadcasts were recorded on shore in Hilversum. The station operated from April 1960 until August 1974, when the Dutch ratification of the Strassbourg treaty came into effect, after which Radio Veronica—then called VOO—became part of the regular Dutch broadcasting system, but was unable to retain its popularity. Radio Veronica is now an independent radio station

*1964
::Radio Noordzee and TV Noordzee transmitted in Dutch from REM Island, an artificial construction resembling an early offshore oil platform. It was built in the Republic of Ireland and towed into a position off the coast of the Netherlands where it was assembled on site. The two stations were short lived and were forcibly closed by an air and sea attack by the Dutch Armed Forces. However, the funds solicited from the project by the REM island project were later used to launch a legitimate and fully licensed station in the Netherlands.

*1970
::Radio Noordzee Internationaal (RNI) broadcasting on AM, FM and international shortwave from the MV &quot;Mebo II&quot; which was originally anchored off the Netherlands. The ship moved for a time off the coast of south-eastern England where it was jammed by a Royal Navy transmitter. The vessel then returned to the Netherlands. The owners of this station were involved in the Nigerian Civil War: (Biafra) and a complicated involvement with the sale of electronic equipment that featured in the trial of the men responsible for the Pan Am Flight 103 Lockerbie bombing. The end came for the MV &quot;Mebo II&quot; when the owners sold their offshore station to Libya as a revolutionary radio station. In the end Libya blew the vessel up and sank it for target practice.

*1970
::Capital Radio aboard the MV &quot;King David&quot;. No connection to the legal British commercial radio group of the same name.

*1978
::Radio Delmare aboard the MV &quot;Martina&quot;. This vessel also took a generator to &quot;Radio Caroline&quot; then using the MV &quot;Mi Amigo&quot;.

*1981
::Radio Paradijs made test broadcasts only from the MV &quot;Magda Maria (Lieve)&quot; which was anchored off the Netherlands before the station was forcibly closed.

*1984-1987
::Radio Monique aboard Radio Caroline&#x27;s MV Ross Revenge.

*1988-1989
::Radio 819 (originally Radio 558 prior to a frequency change) from the MV Ross Revenge.

*1980–present
::There are still many Dutch pirate radio stations, mostly located in rural areas. It has been claimed that in 2011 approx 50% of all European Pirate Stations are located in the East-Netherlands. Especially the provinces of Overijssel, Friesland and Drenthe have a lot of pirate stations, as well as western Brabant. Most of the pirate radio stations air the so called &quot;pirate music&quot;, traditional Dutch folk music combined with classic English, German and Polka. Most operate on FM, but some can be found particularly 1611 to 1700 kHz. Like many other European countries another hotspot is the 48 meter-band on Shortwave radio. The frequency is 6200-6500 kHz. Some can be found in the American part of the band (6900-7000) but is rare. There are about ~40 Pirate radio stations based in the Netherlands alone.

== Sweden ==
*Early 1950s to 31 May 1952; Black Peter was run by the brothers John and Gunnar Figaro from their home in Lomsjö, a small village in southern Lappland. The transmission was suspected to transmit information from espionage resulting in a major hunt. 
*1958
::Skånes Radio Mercur, later renamed to Radio Syd from the MV &quot;Cheeta&quot; and later the MV &quot;Cheeta II&quot; which was also used at various times by TV Syd and for a time Radio Caroline South while the ship was anchored off South-east England. See: Radio Syd webpages Radio Syd was shut down in January 1966 and the owner, Britt Wadner, moved to Gambia where she started a land based Radio Syd in May 1970 using the antenna from &quot;Cheeta II&quot; .

*1961
::Radio Nord broadcasting in Swedish from the MV &quot;Bon Jour&quot; (later renamed &quot;Magda Maria&quot; and &quot;Mi Amigo&quot;).

<text>The rabbit test, or Friedman test, was an early pregnancy test that required killing and dissecting a rabbit to obtain the results. The test was developed in 1931 by Maurice Friedman and Maxwell Edward Lapham at the University of Pennsylvania.

== Test ==
The hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is produced during pregnancy and can be found in a pregnant woman&#x27;s urine and blood; it indicates the presence of an implanted fertilized egg. An earlier test, known as the AZ test, was developed by Selmar Aschheim and Bernhard Zondek. When urine from a woman in the early months of pregnancy was injected into immature female mice, their ovaries would enlarge and show follicular maturation. The test was considered reliable, with an error rate of less than 2%. Friedman and Lapham&#x27;s test was essentially identical, but replaced the mouse with a rabbit. A few days after the injection, the animal would be dissected and the size of her ovaries examined.

The rabbit test became a widely used bioassay (animal-based test) to test for pregnancy. The term &quot;rabbit test&quot; was first recorded in 1949, and was the origin of a common euphemism, &quot;the rabbit died&quot;, for a positive pregnancy test. The phrase was, in fact, based on a common misconception about the test. While many people assumed that the injected rabbit would die only if the woman was pregnant, in fact all rabbits used for the test died, as they had to be dissected in order to examine the ovaries.

A later alternative to the rabbit test, known as the &quot;Hogben test&quot;, used the African clawed frog, and yielded results without the need to cut the animal open. Modern pregnancy tests continue to operate on the basis of testing for the presence of the hormone hCG in the blood or urine, but they no longer require the use of a live animal.

== In the media ==
* &quot;Rabbit Test&quot;, a 1978 comedy film about the world&#x27;s first pregnant man.
* &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot;, a 1975 song by Aerosmith, contains the lyric &quot;You can&#x27;t catch me &#x27;cause the rabbit done died.&quot;
* &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot;, an episode of the television series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; which aired 30 January 1978 (S5 E20). A major plot point is Hawkeye managing to conduct a rabbit test to determine if Margaret is pregnant &quot;without&quot; killing Radar&#x27;s pet rabbit.
* &quot;Emancipation&quot;, an episode of the television series House, M.D. (S6 E08). The test is mentioned at the beginning of the episode, with House saying: &quot;... a pregnancy test only takes five minutes and we no longer kill rabbits&quot;.

<doc id="1030322" wikidata="Q1325532" url="?curid=1030322" title="Moose test">
<text>The evasive manoeuvre test (; colloquial: moose test or elk test; Swedish: &quot;Älgtest&quot;, German: &quot;Elchtest&quot;) is performed to determine how well a certain vehicle evades a suddenly appearing obstacle. This test has been standardized in ISO 3888-2.

Forms of the test have been performed in Sweden since the 1970s. The colloquial and internationally better-known name for the test was coined in 1997 by the German newspaper &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot; after the Swedish motor magazine &quot;Teknikens Värld&quot; together with the TV-show &quot;Trafikmagasinet&quot; flipped a First generation Mercedes-Benz A-Class in a test ostensibly made to measure the car&#x27;s ability to avoid hitting a moose.

In reality, the test is constructed to simulate, for example, a reversing car or a child rushing out onto the road. This is because it is more likely that the moose will continue across the road than remain in place or turn back, making it more advisable to brake hard and try to slip behind the animal than to swerve in front of it.

==Test specifications==
The test is performed on a dry road surface. Traffic cones are set up in an S shape to simulate the obstacle, road, and road edges. The car to be tested has one belted person in each available seat and weights in the boot to achieve maximum load. In order to qualify as a &quot;pass&quot; the vehicle must successfully navigate the course at .

After coming onto the track, the driver quickly swerves into the oncoming lane to avoid the object and then immediately swerves back to avoid potential oncoming traffic. The test is repeated at an increased speeds until the car skids, knocks down cones, or spins around.

==1997 Mercedes A-Class test==
On 21 October 1997 the journalist Robert Collin from the motor magazine &quot;Teknikens Värld&quot; overturned the new (now First generation) Mercedes-Benz A-Class in the moose test at , while a Trabant—a much older, and widely mocked car from the former East Germany—managed it perfectly.

During an interview in &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot;, Collin tried to explain this test by the example of an evasive manoeuvre for a moose on the road. It was soon called &quot;Elchtest&quot; (moose test).

Mercedes initially denied the problem, but then took the step of recalling all units sold to date (2,600), rebuilding 17,000 cars and suspending sales for three months until the problem was solved by adding electronic stability control and modifying the suspension. The company spent DM 2.5 billion in developing the car, with a further DM 300 million to fix it.

==Ongoing testing==
Swedish automotive magazine &quot;Teknikens Värld&quot; tests &quot;hundreds of cars every year&quot;. with the moose test. It publishes test results since 1983 on their website. The car with the slowest speed to successfully complete the manoeuvre is the Reliant Rialto at .

In July 2005, the Dacia Logan appeared initially to fail the test, but a later investigation concluded that excessive testing had worn the car&#x27;s tyres to failure.

Some current vehicles, such as the 2021–present Mitsubishi Outlander and Volvo XC40 Recharge T4, still fail this test, although after the latest software revision the RAV4 now passes the test.

==Current champion==
The current record holder is the Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 RS Manthey at .

==Actual moose collision testing==
Although the moose test itself is based on the avoidance of hitting an obstruction in the road, testing is also carried out on actual collision with animals in the road. Both Volvo and Saab have a tradition of taking moose crashes into account when building cars. Saab assisted Magnus Gens in creating a crash test dummy moose to simulate moose–vehicle collisions.

The Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute has developed a moose crash test dummy called &quot;Mooses&quot;. The dummy (which is made with similar weight, centre of gravity and dimensions to a live moose) is used to simulate realistic moose collisions.

Australian car manufacturers use crash test kangaroo dummies for similar reasons.

In a 2008 episode of &quot;Mythbusters&quot;, the urban legend that accelerating to hit a moose would cause less damage than braking was investigated and busted using a modified version of Gens&#x27;s model. It was found that regardless of car type and speed, the damage to a vehicle was catastrophic in all cases.

<text>A voulge (also spelled vouge, sometimes called a couteau de breche) is a type of polearm that existed in medieval Europe, primarily in 15th century France.

==Description==
A voulge would usually have a narrow single-edged blade mounted with a socket on a shaft. The weapon could additionally feature shaft reinforcements called langets and rondel protection for the hands at the base of the blade. Troops that used the weapon are called voulgiers. It is a weapon noted to have been used by the Franc-Archers and is also depicted in artwork of their creation. 

There is a popular erroneous definition of the word voulge in modern times, which refers to a pointy cleaver-like weapon blade attached to the shaft with two hoops like a bardiche. This definition is incorrect and started in the 19th century with Viollet le Duc, and the weapon in question is an early form of halberd.

<text>The Potomac Heritage Trail, also known as the Potomac Heritage National Scenic Trail or the PHT, is a designated National Scenic Trail corridor spanning parts of the mid-Atlantic region of the United States that will connect various trails and historic sites in Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and the District of Columbia. The trail network includes of existing and planned sections, tracing the natural, historical, and cultural features of the Potomac River corridor, the upper Ohio River watershed in Pennsylvania and western Maryland, and a portion of the Rappahannock River watershed in Virginia. The trail is managed by the National Park Service and is one of three National Trails that are official NPS units.

Unlike many long-distance hiking trails such as the Appalachian Trail, the Potomac Heritage Trail is an informal route with numerous side trails and alternatives, some in parallel on each side of the river. Currently, many of these are separate, connected to the others only by roads. The PHT crosses the Appalachian Trail near Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, and is concurrent with the American Discovery Trail along the portion of the C&amp;O Canal Towpath between Oldtown, Maryland, and Washington, D.C.

== Initial sections ==
Three substantial sections of the trail were in existence when the Potomac Heritage Trail officially became a National Scenic Trail in 1983. These trails range from hiking-only to multi-use, illustrating the variety of the PHT route.

<text>Johnny Htoo and Luther Htoo (pronounced &#x27;too&#x27;, &#x27;H&#x27; is &quot;silent&quot;; born ) are twin brothers who jointly led the God&#x27;s Army guerrilla group, a splinter group of the Karen National Union, in Myanmar (Burma) during the late 1990s.

==Formation of God&#x27;s Army (1997)==
The Htoo twins are from an area of eastern Burma populated by the Karen ethnic group. The Karen and Burmese army had fought at various times for over fifty years, but in the early 1990s the Burmese army launched a major operation to secure the route of an oil pipeline through the area. In March 1997, a local pastor brought the two illiterate nine-year-olds to the local military chief and said the Lord had spoken to them and they would save the Karen people. According to the legend among followers, the twins then rallied defenders of their village by shouting &quot;God&#x27;s Army!&quot;, leading them to a victory over Burmese troops. Various legends claimed that the brothers had numerous magical powers, including invulnerability to bullets and mines, and that they could hand out magical bullets. Supposedly, they could kill by pointing a rifle at the ground and concentrating. One tale claims that Johnny turned himself into an old man and back when bathing in a river. The legend of the boys was embraced by locals who viewed the existing Karen National Union as corrupt and ineffective. A new rebel group called God&#x27;s Army of the Holy Mountain, or God&#x27;s Army for short, was thus formed under the nominal leadership of the Htoo twins.

==Worldwide attention (1999–2000)==
God&#x27;s Army was situated in mountainous rainforests along the border between Burma and Thailand. They were a band of Christian guerrillas who maintained an austere lifestyle, including abstinence from sexual intercourse, alcohol, milk, eggs and pork. The boys, called &quot;Bu Lu&quot; and &quot;Bu Joh&quot; by their followers, were both chain smokers and were said to know the Bible by heart although they had never studied it.
In October 1999, a group calling themselves Vigorous Burmese Student Warriors seized the Burmese embassy in Bangkok and the situation ended with their departure, at which point they were taken in by God&#x27;s Army.

The Htoos came to worldwide attention in January 2000 when 10 members of God&#x27;s Army seized a hospital in Ratchaburi, Thailand. The group held 700 to 800 patients and staff members hostage for 22 hours. They demanded the Thai government stop shelling Karen positions in Burma and treatment for their wounded. Thai security forces stormed the hospital, killing all 10 of the gunmen. A photograph taken by Associated Press photographer Apichart Weerawong of a long-haired Johnny posing next to his tougher-looking, cigar-puffing brother was circulated around the world after the hospital raid. After the raid, God&#x27;s Army were strenuously pursued by the Tatmadaw (Burmese armed forces) and shunned by other Karen rebels. Luther claimed at the time he had 250,000 invisible soldiers in his command while Johnny had 150,000 of his own. Their flesh-and-blood followers were estimated to be around 500 in 1998, but gradually declined to between 100 and 200 men by early 2000 after many left to find work to support their refugee families. Meanwhile, the Burmese army had 21,000 troops in the area.

==Surrender and life after God&#x27;s Army (2001– )==
The twins surrendered to Thai soldiers in January 2001 and requested sanctuary. By that time, the number of their followers had dwindled to less than 20. They repudiated the stories about being invulnerable but insisted that God had helped them to survive over the years. They were reunited with their family. In July 2006, Johnny Htoo surrendered to Burma&#x27;s military government with eight other members of God&#x27;s Army in two groups.

In 2009, Luther Htoo sought status as a refugee in Sweden and settled in Götene while Johnny Htoo moved to a Thai refugee camp while attempting to go to New Zealand to join his mother and sister. Luther married another Karen refugee in Sweden and fathered a child with her before divorcing. In 2018, Luther Htoo returned to Myanmar after meeting a woman online; as of 2020 both are reportedly unemployed and struggle with alcoholism.

<doc id="1030338" wikidata="Q401700" url="?curid=1030338" title="Ahmedabad Airport">
<text>Ahmedabad Airport, officially Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport , is an international airport serving the twin cities of Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar in Gujarat, India. It is named after Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the first Deputy Prime Minister of India. The airport is the busiest and largest airport in the state of Gujarat, and is the seventh busiest airport in India.

In fiscal year 2023-24, it handled over 11 million passengers, making it the seventh-busiest airport in terms of passenger traffic in India. The airport serves as a focus city for Air India and an operating base for IndiGo. In 2015, the government started the procedure for the privatisation of the airport. The new Dholera International Airport is being developed due to expansion constraints at the current airport.
==History==

The airport was set up in 1937, while international operations began on 26 January 1991. It was categorised as an International airport on 23 May 2000. In March 2004, Air India commenced service to London&#x27;s Heathrow Airport on a Boeing 747. The flight catered to the large Gujarati community in the United Kingdom. The carrier ended it in October 2008. The following June, Air India began a route to Frankfurt using 747s. The link lasted until November 2010.

The new Terminal 2 was inaugurated for handling international passengers in 2010. A statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was also inaugurated at the airport. In August 2016, Air India reinstated direct service to London-Heathrow aboard a Boeing 787. Of the four weekly flights, three continued on to Newark. In March 2017 a 700 kWp rooftop solar plant was commissioned at the airport. Air India stopped operating the London–Newark service in November 2018.

In November 2018, the Central Government cleared a proposal by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) for leasing out six of its airports, including Ahmedabad. The following month, AAI commenced an international competitive bidding process to award Operations, Management and Development (OMD) contracts for the six airports.
Seven companies participated in the bidding process for Ahmedabad airport. These included Adani Enterprises Limited, Sydney, Australia-based AMP Capital Investors (UK) Limited, Autostrade, GMR Airports Limited, I Investments Ltd, PNC Infrastructure Ltd and Sanna Enterprises.

The bidding process that was won by the Adani Group. Subsequent to the selection of Adani Enterprises Limited (AEL) as the “Selected Bidder”, AEL promoted and incorporated the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) – Ahmedabad International Airport Limited (AIAL), as the concessionaire under the Companies Act, 2013 in accordance with the terms of the RFP. AIAL signed the Concession Agreement with AAI for exclusive right to operate, manage and develop Ahmedabad Airport on 14 February 2020.

==Structure==
The airport currently consists of four terminals: domestic, international, an additional terminal for secondary traffic and a cargo terminal as well. The airport has 45 parking bays and both the international and domestic terminals have four aero-bridges each. The new terminal has been modelled based on Singapore Changi Airport.

The new terminal has a half-kilometre-long moving walkway, which connects the two terminals. Airports Authority of India (AAI) will construct a new technical block which will enhance the flight handling capacity and provide better control of flights.

===Runway===
The airport has a single runway that is long.

===Air traffic control tower===
As part of the airport modernisation process, the AAI announced that it would construct a new air traffic control (ATC) building that would include a new airport tower in height.

==Terminals==

===Terminal 1===
Terminal 1 is used for domestic flights and has 32 check-in counters and has an area of .

In December 2018, a new Plaza Premium lounge was opened at Terminal 1 (near Gate 4 on first floor), which caters for Priority Pass and other select bank cards as well as some business class passengers based on airline flown.

===Terminal 2===
Terminal 2 was inaugurated on 5 July 2010 and opened for international flights on 15 September 2010. The terminal won the award for the best Steel Structure at the 2009 edition of the National Structural Steel Design and Construction Awards. The terminal has four aerobridges and 32 check-in counters. With the total floor area of approximately 41,000 sq. meters, this terminal will be able to accommodate around 1,600 passengers at any given time. In November 2018, a new Plaza Premium lounge was opened at the international departures area of Terminal 2, which caters for business class and first class passengers as well as passengers holding Priority Pass and other bank cards. The new apron area can cater for the parking of nine A-321 and four ATR-72 type of aircraft.

===Cargo Terminal===
The airport handled 51,637 tonnes of cargo, inclusive of gold and silver in 2013–14. Sixty per cent of the cargo comes from domestic sources. In 2009, of land was leased for a period of seven years out by the AAI to Gujarat Agro Industries Corporation to set up a center for perishable cargo. However, due to a government policy that prevented third-party operations at airports run by the AAI, the CPC was not in use until July 2014, when the minister of state for civil aviation announced that the government had issued a No Objection Certificate for commencement of operations. In 2014, it was announced that the airport would be getting a dedicated cargo terminal which is expected to come up at Terminal 3.

==Airlines and destinations==

===Passenger===


===Cargo===
==Statistics==
==Future==
Due to growing demands and rise in passenger traffic, the airport will get a third passenger terminal just beside Terminal 1, by shifting the present cargo terminal to beside Terminal 2, which will increase the airport&#x27;s capacity. After that, the airport could not be further expanded due to limited space for the future. To solve this problem, a new airport at Dholera, which is being developed into a new smart city, located south-west from the present airport, is under construction, which will be the biggest airport in Gujarat with two parallel runways. Being developed in three phases, the first phase of the airport will be completed by December 2025.

==Awards==
The airport was awarded as the &quot;Most Improved Airport in the Asia-Pacific Region&quot; by the Airports Council International in 2017. In 2019, it received three awards for the &quot;Best Airport for Customer Service&quot;, &quot;Best Airport for Environment and Ambience&quot; and &quot;Best Airport for Infrastructure and Facilitation&quot; from the Airport Service Quality (ASQ) Survey for 2019 conducted by Airports Council International.

==Accidents and incidents==
*Indian Airlines Flight 113 operating from Mumbai to Ahmedabad crashed on its final approach to the airport on 19 October 1988, killing 130 people including all 6 crew members. The flight was cleared for a visual approach into a foggy airport, when it struck trees and a high-tension pylon at a distance of 5 km from Runway 23, before crashing into a field and bursting into flames.
*Jet Airways Flight 2510, coming in from Indore collapsed on the runway while landing at the airport on 22 July 2010. There were 57 passengers and four crew members on board the ATR flight. Some passengers received minor injuries as the nose wheel reportedly collapsed due to a tyre burst.
*In January 2018, a stray cow on the runway had caused chaos at airport leading to two planes aborting their landings. The cow crept past security at a cargo gate at the airport resulting in a cargo plane being diverted to Mumbai and delaying five domestic flights and several departures. It took over 90 minutes for the security personnel to clear the runway from the cow.

== Fleet ==
As of January 2024, the Air Kiribati fleet consists of the following aircraft:

===Fleet development===

==== Embraer E190-E2 ====
In December 2019, the first Embraer E190-E2, in Air Kiribati livery, was delivered to the airline. The E190-E2 has been certified and registered to the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) since the beginning of 2020.

The Embraer E190-E2 has a maximum range of . It retains cockpit commonality with its predecessor - E190. E190 pilots will only require a 2.5 days transition training with no flight simulator time needed to be able to fly the E190-E2.

Air Kiribati acting CEO Danial Rochford previously pointed out that &quot;the type&#x27;s increased range deemed it a &quot;perfect choice&quot; for the carrier.&quot; Acting CEO Danial Rochford says that the E190-E2 will offer “opportunities to fly from Australia and New Zealand direct to Kiribati”.

The E190-E2 is able to operate every required route in the Air Kiribati network when it receives ETOPS 120 minutes certification and also allow the airline to operate longer-haul domestic and international routes including connections that had so far been beyond the reach of its current fleet of turboprops.

The Kiribati Transport Minister stated: &quot;non-stop operations between the capital Tarawa and Kiritmati (Christmas) island [&quot;sic&quot;] currently requires an international stop in Fiji. With a range of 2,850 nautical miles, the E190-E2 can operate throughout the country with non-stop routes.&quot;

However, the first of 2 Embraer E190-E2&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t taken up and never entered passenger service, eventually ended up with the operator, Pionair Australia.

==== Domestic Twin Otter ====
In December 2007, the Kiribati Government approved a request by Air Kiribati to purchase two Canadian-made Twin Otter aircraft. Each plane is reported to cost US$3.3 million, but Air Kiribati&#x27;s previous CEO Baraniko Baaro reports the purchase is a wise move which will save money currently used for the frequent repairs the aging air fleet requires. In addition, the new planes boast higher fuel efficiency, have room for more passengers and cargo and require less runway length than the current fleet, which may be of benefit on the airstrips of Kiribati&#x27;s outer islands.

==== Regional Dash 8 ====
Air Kiribati has received its first new Dash 8 100 series aircraft, which touched down at Bonriki International Airport from Canada on 31 October 2017.

Tarataake Teannaki (a previous CEO) said &quot;The Dash 8 is expected to fly to Tabiteuea North, pick up passengers from the Southern Gilbert Islands who will be flown to Tabiteuea North via Air Kiribati’s smaller aircraft stationed on the island to pick passengers from the Southern Gilberts and vice versa.

The aircraft is no longer in service.

ATR 72

On 29 May 2002, Air Kiribati received an ATR 72-202, leased from ATRiam Capital. Air Kiribati operated the aircraft until March 2004, when it was returned to ATRiam Capital.

<text>The Natchez Trace Trail is a designated National Scenic Trail in the United States, whose route generally follows sections of the Natchez Trace Parkway through the states of Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi. The Natchez Trace Trail is not a long, continuous footpath, as is the case with other national scenic trails (such as the Appalachian Trail); rather, only a limited number of trail segments along the route, currently over of trail, have been developed for hiking and horseback riding. Moreover, the Natchez Trace Trail, unlike many others that rely heavily on volunteers for trail construction and maintenance, is managed and maintained by the National Park Service. Sections of the trail follow along the Natchez Trace Parkway road shoulder, and cross county and state roads. It was originally intended to be longer and follow most of the Natchez Trace Parkway, but only a portion was built. 

The Natchez Trace Parkway and National Scenic Trail commemorate the historic Natchez Trace, an ancient path that began as a wildlife and Native American trail, and has a rich history of use by colonizers, &quot;Kaintuck&quot; boatmen, post riders, and military men.

== Sections ==
This trail comprises five sections. The table below is ordered from South, Milepost 0 (Natchez) to North, Milepost 444 (near Nashville), but can be sorted differently.

<doc id="1030359" wikidata="Q541211" url="?curid=1030359" title="Anglo-Leasing scandal">
<text>The Anglo Leasing scandal was a government procurement-facilitated corruption scandal in Kenya.

==Origins==
The scandal is alleged to have started when the Kenyan Government wanted to replace its passport printing system, in 1997, but came to light after revelation by a government officer, in 2002.

It was among the many corrupt deals that were inherited from KANU Government, which had ruled Kenya for 24 years. Even though the new NARC Government came to power with a promise to fight corruption, which some effort was put but completely watered-down by the magnitude of the Anglo-Leasing Scandal. Some corrupt civil servants and cabinet ministers happily inherited graft projects and nurtured them. Former Internal Security Minister Christopher Ndarathi Murungaru and former vice-president Moody Awori were said to have been the biggest beneficiaries of this particular scandal.

A sophisticated passport equipment system was sourced from France and forensic science laboratories for the police were sourced from Britain. The transaction was originally quoted at 6 million euros by a French firm, but was awarded to a British firm, Anglo Leasing Finance, at 30 million euros, who would have sub-contracted the same French firm to do the work. The tender was not publicly advertised, and its details were leaked to the media by a junior civil servant. The Anglo-Leasing sales agent was Sudha Ruparell, a 48-year-old woman who is the daughter of Chamanlal Kamani and sister of Rashmikant Chamanlal Kamani and Deepak Kamani. The Kamani family has been involved in various security supplies scandals in the past. In January 2006, the Anglo-Leasing Scandal was given fresh impetus through the publication of John Githongo&#x27;s report. The new revelations indicate that Anglo Leasing Finance was just one of a plethora of phantom entities, including some UK companies, used to perpetrate fraud on the Kenyan taxpayer through non-delivery of goods and services and massive overpricing. Infotalent Systems was a firm owned by the Kamanis and implicated in John Githongo&#x27;s report, with a 5.2 million euro back pay for receiving a security contract worth 59.7 million euros.

==Impact==
The then-British envoy to Kenya, Sir Edward Clay, publicly raised the issue of Anglo-Leasing at a dinner in Nairobi. He subsequently came under pressure from Kenyan politicians to make public his evidence, and was reported to have provided the President, Mwai Kibaki, with a dossier containing details of corruption in the government. However, no one was punished and the case slipped from the public eye.

Kenya&#x27;s minister in charge of the project, Chris Murungaru, was later banned by the UK government from travelling to Britain, on the grounds that it would not be in the public good. It was widely reported that the ban was due to corruption by Mr Murungaru involving, among others, the Anglo-Leasing scam.

On 22 January 2006, John Githongo named Vice-president Moody Awori as one of four top politicians (with Kiraitu Murungi, former justice minister and later energy minister; finance minister David Mwiraria and former transport minister Chris Murungaru) as being involved. He also mentioned that Jimmy Wanjigi had sworn to kill him. Public sympathy for Githongo reached its peak when he released audio recordings of an incriminating conversation with Mwiraria on the internet. He also claimed that President Kibaki was complicit in the affair. Githongo claimed that the money raised would have funded the then government&#x27;s forthcoming 2005 Constitutional Referendum and 2007 Election campaign. These allegations were denied by Awori and Murungaru and an investigation was promised.

In February, in an interview with the BBC, Githongo told of his meeting with Kiraitu, during which the then Justice minister tried to blackmail him over a loan his (Githongo&#x27;s) father is said to owe businessman Anura Pereira. &quot;The minister of Justice was telling me that if I eased off my inquiries, then my father&#x27;s loan matter would be made to go away,&quot; Githongo said. He had an audiotape, which was played on the BBC.

==Githongo&#x27;s exile==
In an interview with Fergal Keane for the BBC&#x27;s Newsnight programme on 8 February 2006, Githongo revealed what he claims is taped evidence proving that Kiraitu Murungi attempted to impede his inquiries. Murungi suggested that a KSh.30 million/= loan to his father by a lawyer A.H. Malik had been bought by Anura Pereira, and might be forgiven in exchange for &#x27;going slow&#x27; on the Anglo Leasing investigation. He reveals that at the end of his investigations, he came to the conclusion that the Anglo Leasing scandal went all the way to the top, and as a consequence his life was in danger. Anglo Leasing, and many other similar deals, were, in part, back-door financing to pay for NARC&#x27;s election bid in 2007.

==Dismissals and resignations==
*On 23 November 2005, President Mwai Kibaki dissolved his cabinet following a humiliating defeat on a referendum on the proposed constitution of Kenya. In the resulting re-shuffle, Murungaru was not re-appointed.
*On 1 February David Mwiraria became the first of those implicated in the report to resign, doing so live on television. He maintained his innocence and claimed that he was resigning to clear his name.
*A day later, Awori refused to resign, saying he saw no reason to. A day later a group of 80 MPs called for the sacking of Awori, threatening street protests if their requests were not met.
*On 13 February, President Kibaki announced that Kiraitu Murungi had resigned to allow full investigation into the allegations. Murungi&#x27;s resignation was announced in a television address by President Kibaki, though he too denies any wrongdoing.

Travel bans have been imposed on key players, and Kenyan authorities would have started freezing the assets of individuals suspected of being involved in corruption in a bid to recover looted state funds.

==Response from Kenyans==
The response of Kenyans has been critical of the Government, both from those who initially voted for it and those who did not. The president has been accused of adding to the problems he promised to solve and making Kenya an embarrassment in the eyes of the world. Most responses have also praised the role played by Githongo in bringing the scandal to light though a minority opinion has criticised him for holding a &#x27;neo-colonial&#x27; attitude, and not remaining in Kenya. The general feeling in the country about this, and other, mega-corruption scandals is that the selfishness of the ruling elite holds Kenya back from developing into a middle income country.

On 17 February 2006, anti-corruption protestors marched through Nairobi despite their demonstration being officially banned. The participants carried banners calling for a conclusion to the Anglo-Leasing scandal and chanted for the resignation of Vice-president Awori.

==British enquiry==
United Kingdom&#x27;s Serious Fraud Office began its probe in July 2007, and was investigating offshore accounts in the British tax havens of Jersey and Guernsey, which were used to transfer more than $30m to a company called Apex Finance between April 2002 and February 2004. The SFO said it decided to halt its probe after the Kenyan government failed to produce evidence that would enable the prosecution of suspects.

==Finance==
Anglo Leasing Finance is an entity associated with Deepak Kamani. The Controller &amp; Auditor General of Kenya has published a report on single sourced security contracts where widespread fraud through non-delivery and overpricing are suspected. The entities used to carry out this fraud are linked:

<doc id="1030383" wikidata="Q683457" url="?curid=1030383" title="German submarine Wilhelm Bauer">
<text>German submarine &quot;Wilhelm Bauer (originally designated U-2540&quot;) is a Type XXI U-boat of Nazi Germany&#x27;s navy (&quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;), completed shortly before the end of World War II. It was scuttled at the end of the war, having never gone on patrol. In 1957, it was raised from the seabed off Flensburg Firth, refurbished, and recommissioned for use by the West-German Bundesmarine in 1960. Finally retired fully in 1983, it is the only floating example of a Type XXI U-boat. It has been modified to appear in wartime configuration and exhibited at the German Maritime Museum in Bremerhaven, Germany.

==Design==
Like all Type XXI U-boats, &quot;U-2540&quot; had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of , a beam of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two MAN SE supercharged six-cylinder M6V40/46KBB diesel engines each providing , two Siemens-Schuckert GU365/30 double-acting electric motors each providing , and two Siemens-Schuckert silent running GV232/28 electric motors each providing .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a submerged speed of . When running on silent motors the boat could operate at a speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate at for ; when surfaced, she could travel at . &quot;U-2540&quot; was fitted with six torpedo tubes in the bow and four C/30 anti-aircraft guns. She could carry twenty-three torpedoes or seventeen torpedoes and twelve mines. The complement was five officers and fifty-two men.

==Construction and wartime service==
Construction of &quot;U-2540&quot; began on 28 October 1944 by Blohm &amp; Voss in Hamburg-Finkenwerder. She was launched on 13 January 1945 and commissioned on 24 February 1945 as part of the 31st U-boat Flotilla for training purposes. In April 1945 the boat went to the front after training at Rønne on Bornholm. Due to the ongoing fuel shortages at the end of the war, the boat was relocated to Swinemünde before being scuttled near the Flensburg lightship on 4 May 1945.

==Salvage, refit and new service==
In June 1957, after more than 12 years on the floor of the Baltic Sea, &quot;U-2540&quot; was raised and overhauled at Howaldtswerke, Kiel. The submarine was commissioned as a research vessel in the &quot;Bundesmarine&quot;, serving from 1 September 1960 until 28 August 1968 as a test boat (class 241). On relaunch she was renamed &quot;Wilhelm Bauer&quot;, after the designer of the first German U-boat, &quot;Brandtaucher&quot;, built in Kiel by August Howaldt in 1850. From May 1970 she again entered service, this time with a civilian crew and served as a testbed for the technical innovations of the Type 206 U-boat. After an underwater collision with the on 6 May 1980 &quot;Wilhelm Bauer&quot; was discharged from use at Eckernförde on 18 November 1980 and finally released from service in 1983.

==Conversion to museum ship==
&quot;U-2540&quot; was put on sale by the Ministry of Defence and acquired by the board of trustees of the German Maritime Museum Association and the German Maritime Museum in Bremerhaven. The boat was restored to its original World War II configuration after its transfer in August 1983 to the Seebeck yard, opening on 27 April 1984 as a museum ship in Bremerhaven, now sponsored by the Wilhelm Bauer Technology Museum association. It has imitation twin 20mm cannon and the bridge is not glazed as it was during service with the &quot;Bundesmarine.&quot;

==In popular culture==
&quot;Whilhem Bauer&quot; was featured in an episode of the documentary series Nazi Megastructures in 2016, with an episode titled &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Killer Subs&quot;, which included the history of the design and construction of the Type XXI submarine.

<doc id="1030384" wikidata="Q724196" url="?curid=1030384" title="Coma (novel)">
<text>Coma is Robin Cook&#x27;s first commercially successful novel, published by Signet Book in 1977. &quot;Coma&quot; was preceded in 1973 by Cook&#x27;s lesser-known novel &quot;Year of the Intern&quot;.

==Plot==
Susan Wheeler is a third-year medical student at Boston Memorial Hospital. She and four other students take rounds in surgery rooms and ICUs, recording post-treatment notations on the patients&#x27; health. Dr. Mark Bellows, a surgery resident in the hospital, is the instructor and this group&#x27;s supervisor.

The book is a journey into the inner workings of a hospital. As these students complete their three-month surgical rotation, the dilemmas and problems faced by a woman in a male-dominated profession are also highlighted.
Susan notices that two patients, Nancy Greenly and Sean Berman, mysteriously went into comas immediately after their surgeries. These were attributed to anesthesia complications. Nancy Greenly became comatose due to her brain receiving insufficient oxygen during surgery. Similarly, Sean Berman, a healthy young man in his 30s, underwent a knee operation. Despite the operation&#x27;s success, Sean failed to regain consciousness. Medically, the odds for such occurrences are one in 100,000; however, such odds seemed resolutely higher at the Boston Memorial Hospital.

Baffled by these two patients, Susan investigates their cases and other recent coma victims. She discovers that the oxygen line to Operating Room 8 has been tampered with to induce carbon monoxide poisoning in patients during surgery, ultimately causing brain death. At the same time, Susan develops a brief, but intimate, relationship with Bellows and discusses her findings with him. After unraveling further details, and evading pursuit by a man hired to kill her, Susan is led to the Jefferson Institute.

The institute is hailed as an intensive care facility designed to reduce high medical costs. Patients declared brain dead or &quot;vegetables&quot; are referred to the institute. Here, Susan finds that patients are suspended from the ceiling by wires in rooms walled by glass, and moved from room to room with little human involvement. The &quot;samples&quot; are kept alive and healthy until a call for an organ comes in. The organ of choice is removed surgically (without family consent) and then sold on the black market.

Howard Stark, chief of the Department of Surgery at Boston Memorial, is revealed as the main antagonist. Stark confronts Susan over her findings, then drugs her, intending to put her in an irreversible coma under the pretext of an appendectomy. However, Bellows disables the &quot;oxygen&quot; line during the operation, thereby preventing a full dose of carbon monoxide poisoning. Stark is arrested, but Susan&#x27;s fate is left in doubt.

==Background==
After Cook&#x27;s first book failed to sell well, he studied the common ingredients of bestsellers and felt that for an unknown writer, mystery thrillers had the best chance of success. He was particularly influenced by &quot;Jaws&quot;, &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; and the novels of Eric Ambler. His original publisher rejected the idea but Little Brown agreed to give Cook a $10,000 advance.

==Critical response==
&quot;Coma&quot;s literary awards and acclaims include a long tenure on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, reaching its high position of #6 in the fiction category. The novel was included in the Fiction category of &quot;&quot;The New York Times&quot; Outstanding Book of the Year&quot; listing (the forerunner to &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; current &quot;100 Notable Books of [Year]&quot; listing) from which the &quot;Best Book of the Year&quot; is selected. &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; also called &quot;Coma&quot; 1977&#x27;s &quot;number one thriller of the year.&quot;

==Adaptations==
The story was made into the highly successful 1978 film &quot;Coma&quot;, directed by Michael Crichton.

The story was adapted again into a two-part television miniseries that aired in September 2012 on the A&amp;E television network.

<doc id="1030397" wikidata="Q1068697" url="?curid=1030397" title="Cheat River">
<text>The Cheat River is a tributary of the Monongahela River in eastern West Virginia and southwestern Pennsylvania in the United States. Via the Ohio River, the Cheat and Monongahela are part of the Mississippi River watershed. Owing to the ruggedness of the surrounding Allegheny Mountains, the Cheat remains largely remote with few settlements or developments along its banks. Its headwaters are in the Cheat-Potomac Ranger District of the Monongahela National Forest.

==Geography==
The Cheat is formed at Parsons, West Virginia, by the confluence of Shavers Fork and Black Fork. Black Fork is fed by the Blackwater River and by the Dry, Glady, and Laurel Forks — these are traditionally referred to as the five Forks of Cheat. (The &quot;High Falls of Cheat&quot; [15 feet/4.6 m high] is a few miles upstream of Bemis on Shavers Fork.) From Parsons the Cheat River flows generally northward through Tucker and Preston counties, past the towns of Rowlesburg and Albright. It then flows through an impressive gorge — Cheat Canyon — northeastwardly from Albright, collecting Big Sandy Creek before entering Monongalia County, where a hydro-electric dam just south of the Pennsylvania border causes it to widen as the Cheat Lake reservoir. It then flows for a short distance through southwestern Fayette County, Pennsylvania, before joining the Monongahela River at Point Marion, Pennsylvania. Upstream of its dam, the Cheat is one of the largest undammed watersheds in the eastern United States.

Cheat Mountain, a high and rugged ridge, runs about southward from its northernmost tip, just a few miles west of the confluence at Parsons.

==Name==
The Delaware (Lenape) Indian name for Cheat was reportedly &quot;Ach-sin-ha-nac&quot;, meaning &quot;stony river&quot;. &quot;Cheat River&quot; is variously reported to have been named for (1) a French explorer (or an Indian) named Cheat or Chaet, (2) an abundance of cheat grass along its banks (possibly a misidentification of frost-killed wheat), or (3) deceptively deep sections containing whirlpools that presumably &quot;cheated&quot; men of their lives by drowning them. None of these theories have strong documentary support, but the latter is the most often cited.

===Historical names===
According to the Geographic Names Information System, the Cheat River has formerly been known as:
*Ach-sin-ha-nac
*Achsinhanac
*Cheal River
*Chealt River
*Eleat River
*Wilmoths River

==History==

===18th century===
In 1756, the Eckarly family became the first white settlers to move into the Cheat River Valley when they lodged at Dunkard&#x27;s Bottom in what is now Preston County, West Virginia. They, and a few in the surrounding region, were soon forced to abandon their homesteads by hostile Indians and no further attempts at settlement were made until after the conclusion of the French and Indian War (1754-1763). In October 1767, Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon completed their famous survey of the Maryland–Pennsylvania border shortly after extending it to a crossing of the Cheat River just above its confluence with the Monongahela. (The party was forced to stop a few miles west at Dunkard Creek near present-day Mount Morris, Pennsylvania. Their Iroquois guides had refused to go any further, having reached the border of their lands with the Lenape, with whom they were engaged in hostilities.) According to George W. Atkinson (1876), &quot;From 1765 to 1774 there were comparatively few attacks made upon the white colonists by the Indians. The Treaty of Paris [1763] resulted in general peace along the frontiers, had been pretty generally adhered to by all the savage tribes. The peace, however, which had for nine years blessed and fostered the frontier settlements, was suddenly broken by the murder of several friendly Indians, in 1774, on the Monongahela and Cheat rivers. This unfortunate aggression on the part of these white men gave rise to a general raid by the Indians upon all the settlements of the frontier.&quot;

The Cheat River Valley was part of a much larger area disputed in the 1770s by the Colonies of Pennsylvania and Virginia. (This was before the parties agreed to extend the Mason–Dixon line westward from Maryland.) Virginia attempted to administer this vast region as the District of West Augusta between 1774 and 1776, after which it subdivided the District into three counties, the Cheat River becoming part of Monongalia County. Meanwhile, Pennsylvania tried to oversee it as part of the overlapping Westmoreland County. After additional surveys, and the resolution of the Virginia-Pennsylvania border dispute in the 1780s, it became established that all but the lowermost 3 miles of the Cheat were within the state of Virginia. The Cheat River country remained part of Monongalia County until 1791 when that county was divided into a smaller Monongalia County and Randolph County.

===19th century===
The Virginia General Assembly authorized the first two ferries on the Cheat in 1806. On January 2, a ferry in Monongalia County was approved on Charles Stuart property to James Stafford property. On January 18, the Assembly authorized the second ferry in Monongalia County from the forge location of Samuel Jackson to Charles Magill property. Another act in 1806 authorized to conduct a lottery to fund the construction of a toll bridge across Cheat River near Dunkard&#x27;s Bottom. Concerned included Michael Kern, John Steally, Augustus Werninger, Ralph Barkshire, and William N. Jarrett. The Assembly also authorized in 1806 the construction of mill dams across the Monongahela River, Cheat River, Tygart Valley River, or the West Fork of the Monongahela River.

Along with the rest of western Virginia, the Cheat River Valley became part of the new state of West Virginia in 1863.

===20th century===

A state militia facility, Camp Dawson, was established on the banks of the Cheat in Preston County in 1909 and continues in operation today.

1985 flood&lt;br&gt;
In November 1985, heavy rains caused a massive flood on the Cheat, essentially wiping out the small town of Albright. The river flow was estimated at 190,000 cubic feet per second, much larger than normal flows ranging from 1,000 to 5,000 cubic feet per second. The massive flood also caused the Cheat River to leave its banks and flood the small town of Rowlesburg. The town lost many businesses, and many families left their homes or the land that they owned. The flood also wiped out the school in Rowlesburg, which caused the consolidation of a high school for the county. The devastation was caused not so much by the steady-state flow of water, but rather by the repeated damming of the river by debris under the various road and railroad bridges that crossed the Cheat. Thus as the flood proceeded down the river, the water would rise behind the obstructed bridge, break through the inadvertent dam, and pick up more debris that would block the river at the next bridge site, repeating the process.

==Pollution==

In the vicinity of Albright, the Cheat has been plagued by pollution, notably acid mine drainage. Although the rocks downstream of Albright have been stained a rust brown, and the river has a very low fish population below Albright, water quality has been making slow improvements since the 1990s. Friends of the Cheat, the local river advocacy organization, has been instrumental in promoting remediation, cleanup, river stewardship, and education.
==Whitewater recreation and the Cheat River Festival (Cheat Fest)==
The Cheat Canyon section of the Cheat River (from Albright to Jenkinsburg, West Virginia), which features Class IV rapids (and Class V rapids at upper levels), has become a favorite destination for whitewater kayaking and rafting.
On the first weekend in May of every year, paddlers gather from many states to attend the Cheat River Festival, also known as Cheat Fest.

Cheat Fest, as of 2024, has been held on the first weekend of May for 30 years, and features local and regional artists, vendors, and musicians/bands over Friday and Saturday. Past artists who have performed at the festival grounds includes The Larry Keel Experience, Vince Herman, Fletcher’s Grove, Donna the Buffalo, and many other regional and national musicians.
A local music festival, Groovin’ With the Grove, is also held annually at the Cheat River Festival grounds.

During the Cheat River Festival, a whitewater race called the Cheat River Massacre-ence takes place in the Cheat River Canyon on the Friday of that weekend. Unlike the overwhelming majority of whitewater races, which employ a staggered start, this race uses a mass start (in which all participants start at the same time). For the first few miles, paddlers must avoid one another, in addition to the whitewater hazards that the river presents. The race, which often attracts over 150 people, is frequently cited as the largest whitewater race in the world.

The Cheat Narrows section of the Cheat River (upstream of Albright) is also utilized by whitewater paddlers, and features Class II and III rapids.

<doc id="1030401" wikidata="Q4152088" url="?curid=1030401" title="Humic substance">
<text>Humic substances (HS) are colored relatively recalcitrant organic compounds naturally formed during long-term decomposition and transformation of biomass residues. The color of humic substances varies from bright yellow to light or dark brown leading to black. The term comes from humus, which in turn comes from the Latin word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;soil, earth&quot;. Humic substances represent the major part of organic matter in soil, peat, coal, and sediments, and are important components of dissolved natural organic matter (NOM) in lakes (especially dystrophic lakes), rivers, and sea water. Humic substances account for 50 – 90% of cation exchange capacity in soils.

&quot;Humic substances&quot; is an umbrella term covering humic acid, fulvic acid and humin, which differ in solubility. By definition, humic acid (HA) is soluble in water at neutral and alkaline pH, but insoluble at acidic pH &lt; 2. Fulvic acid (FA) is soluble in water at any pH. Humin is not soluble in water at any pH.

This definition of humic substances is largely operational. It is rooted in the history of soil science and, more precisely, in the tradition of alkaline extraction, which dates back to 1786, when Franz Karl Achard treated peat with a solution of potassium hydroxide and, after subsequent addition of an acid, obtained an amorphous dark precipitate (i.e., humic acid). Aquatic humic substances were isolated for the first time in 1806, from spring water by Jöns Jakob Berzelius.

In terms of chemistry, FA, HA, and humin share more similarities than differences and represent a continuum of humic molecules. All of them are constructed from similar aromatic, polyaromatic, aliphatic, and carbohydrate units and contain the same functional groups (mainly carboxylic, phenolic, and ester groups), albeit in varying proportions.

Water solubility of humic substances is primarily governed by interplay of two factors: the amount of ionizable functional groups and (mainly carboxylic) and molecular weight (MW). In general, fulvic acid has a higher amount of carboxylic groups and lower average molecular weight than does humic acid. Measured average molecular weights vary with source; however, molecular weight distributions of HA and FA overlap significantly.

Age and origin of the source material determine the chemical structure of humic substances. In general, humic substances derived from soil and peat (which takes hundreds to thousands of years to form) have higher molecular weight, higher amounts of O and N, more carbohydrate units, and fewer polyaromatic units than humic substances derived from coal and leonardite (which takes millions of years to form).

Isolation of HS is the result of an alkaline extraction from solid sources of NOM the adsorption of HS on a resin. A newer view of humic substances is that they are not mostly high-molecular-weight macropolymers but rather represent a heterogeneous mixture of relatively small molecular components of the soil organic matter auto-assembled in supramolecular associations and are composed of a variety of compounds of biological origin and synthesized by abiotic and biotic reactions in soil. and surface waters It is the large molecular complexity of the soil humeome that confers to humic matter its bioactivity in, its stability in ecosystems, soil and its role as plant growth promoter (in particular plant roots).

The academic definition of humic substances is under debate and some researchers argue against the traditional concepts of humification and seek to forgo alkali extract method and to analyze the soil directly.

==Concepts of humic substances==
The formation of HS in nature is one of the least understood aspects of humus chemistry and one of the most intriguing. Historically, there have been three main theories to explain it: the lignin theory of Waksman (1932), the polyphenol theory, and the sugar-amine condensation theory of Maillard (1911). Humic substances are formed by the microbial degradation of dead biota matter, such as lignin, cellulose. ligno-cellulose and charcoal. Humic substances in the lab are resistant to further biodegradation. Their structure, elemental composition and content of functional groups of a given sample depend on the water or soil source and on the specific procedures and conditions of extraction. Nevertheless, the average properties of lab extractes HS from different sources are remarkably similar.

=== Fractionation ===
Historically, scientists have used variations of similar methods for extracting HS from NOM and separation the extracts into HA and FA. The International Humic Substances Society advocates the use of standard laboratory methods for preparation of humic and fulvic acids. Humic substances are extracted from soil and other solid sources using 0.1 M NaOH, under a nitrogen atmosphere, to prevent abiotic oxidation of some of the components of HS. The HA is then precipitated at pH 1, and the soluble fraction is treated on a resin column to separate fulvic acid components from other acid soluble compounds. The fraction of NOM not extracted by 0.1 NaOH is humin. Humic acid plus fulvic acid is extracted from natural waters using a resin column after microfiltration and acidification to pH 2. The humic materials are eluted from the column with NaOH, and humic acid is precipitated at pH 1. After adjusting the pH to 2 fulvic acid is separated from other acid soluble compounds, using a resin column as with solid phase sources. An analytical method for quantifying humic acid and fulvic acid in commercial ores and humic products, has been developed based on the IHSS humic acid and fulvic acid preparation methods.

Scientists associated with the IHSS have also isolated the entire NOM from black water streams using reverse osmosis  The retentate from this process contains both humic and fulvic acids, predominately humic acid. The NOM from hard water streams has been isolated using  reverse osmosis and electrodialysis in tandem.

Extracted humic acid not a single acid; rather, it is a complex mixture of many different acids containing carboxyl and phenolate groups so that the mixture behaves functionally as a dibasic acid or, occasionally, as a tribasic acid. Commercial humic acid used to amend soil is manufactured using these same well established procedures. Humic acids can form complexes with ions that are commonly found in the environment creating humic colloids.

A sequential chemical fractionation called Humeomics can be used to isolate more homogeneous humic fractions and determine their molecular structures by advanced spectroscopic and chromatographic methods. Substances identified in humic extracts and directly in soil include mono-, di-, and tri-hydroxycarboxylic acids, fatty acids, dicarboxylic acids, linear alcohols, phenolic acids, terpenoids, carbohydrates, and amino acids. This suggests humic molecules may form a supramolecular structures held together by non-covalent forces, such as van der Waals force, π-π, and CH-π bonds.

== Chemical characteristics ==
Since the dawn of modern chemistry, humic substances are among the most studied among natural materials. Despite long study, their molecular structure remains debatable The traditional view has been that humic substances are hetero- poly-condensates, in varying associations with clay. A more recent view is that relatively small molecules also play major a role.

A typical humic substance is a mixture of many molecules, some of which are based on a motif of aromatic nuclei with phenolic and carboxylic substituents, linked together;  The functional groups that contribute most to surface charge and reactivity of humic substances are phenolic and carboxylic groups. Humic substances commonly behave as mixtures of dibasic acids, with a pK1 value around 4 for protonation of carboxyl groups and around 8 for protonation of phenolate groups in HA. Fulvic acids are more acidic than HA. There is considerable overall similarity among individual humic acids. For this reason, measured pK values for a given sample are average values relating to the constituent species. The other important characteristic is charge density.
The more recent determinations of molecular weights of HS show that the molecular weights are not as great as once thought.  Reported  number average molecular weights of soil HA are &lt; 6000 but they are highly poly disperse with some components with much larger measure molecular weights and much lower.  Measured number average molecular weights of aquatic HS with HA &lt;= 1700 and FA&lt; 900.  The aquatic HA and FA are also highly poly disperse.  The number of individually distinct components in HS, as measured by mass spectroscopy is in the thousands  The average composition of HA and FA can be represented by model structures.

The presence of carboxylate and phenolate groups gives the humic acids the ability to form complexes with ions such as Mg2+, Ca2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ creating humic colloids.. Many humic acids have two or more of these groups arranged so as to enable the formation of chelate complexes. The formation of (chelate) complexes is an important aspect of the biological role of humic acids in regulating bioavailability of metal ions. 
----Criticism
Decomposition products of dead plant materials form intimate associations with minerals, making it difficult to isolate and characterize soil organic constituents. 18th century soil chemists successfully used alkaline extraction to isolate a portion of the organic constituents in soil. This led to the theory that a &#x27;humification&#x27; process created distinct &#x27;humic substances&#x27; like &#x27;humic acid&#x27;, &#x27;fulvic acid&#x27;, and &#x27;humin&#x27;. However, modern chemical analysis methods applied to unprocessed mineral soil have not directly observed large humic molecules. This suggests that the extraction and fractionation techniques used to isolate humic substances alter the original chemical composition of the organic matter. Since the definition of humic substances like humic and fulvic acids relies on their separation through these methods, it raises the question of whether the distinction between these compounds accurately reflects the natural state of organic matter in soil. Despite these concerns, the &#x27;humification&#x27; theory persists in the field and in even textbooks, and attempts to redefine &#x27;humic substances&#x27; in soil have resulted in a proliferation of conflicting definitions. This lack of consensus makes it difficult to communicate scientific understanding of soil processes and properties accurately.&quot;

==Determination of humic acids in water samples==
The presence of humic acid in water intended for potable or industrial use can have a significant impact on the treatability of that water and the success of chemical disinfection processes. For instance, humic and fulvic acids can react with the chemicals used in the chlorination process to form disinfection byproducts such as dihaloacetonitriles, which are toxic to humans. Accurate methods of establishing humic acid concentrations are therefore essential in maintaining water supplies, especially from upland peaty catchments in temperate climates.

As a lot of different bio-organic molecules in very diverse physical associations are mixed together in natural environments, it is cumbersome to measure their exact concentrations in the humic superstructure. For this reason, concentrations of humic acid are traditionally estimated out of concentrations of organic matter, typically from concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC) or dissolved organic carbon (DOC).

Extraction procedures are bound to alter some of the chemical linkages present in the soil humic substances (mainly ester bonds in biopolyesters such as cutins and suberins). The humic extracts are composed of large numbers of different bio-organic molecules that have not yet been totally separated and identified. However, single classes of residual biomolecules have been identified by selective extractions and chemical fractionation, and are represented by alkanoic and hydroxy alkanoic acids, resins, waxes, lignin residues, sugars, and peptides.

==Ecological effects==
Organic matter soil amendments have been known by farmers to be beneficial to plant growth for longer than recorded history. However, the chemistry and function of the organic matter have been a subject of controversy since humans began postulating about it in the 18th century. Until the time of Liebig, it was supposed that humus was used directly by plants, but, after Liebig showed that plant growth depends upon inorganic compounds, many soil scientists held the view that organic matter was useful for fertility only as it was broken down with the release of its constituent nutrient elements into inorganic forms.
At the present time, soil scientists hold a more holistic view and at least recognize that humus influences soil fertility through its effect on the water-holding capacity of the soil. Also, since plants have been shown to absorb and translocate the complex organic molecules of systemic insecticides, they can no longer discredit the idea that plants may be able to absorb the soluble forms of humus; this may in fact be an essential process for the uptake of otherwise insoluble iron oxides.

A study on the effects of humic acid on plant growth was conducted at Ohio State University which said in part &quot;humic acids increased plant growth&quot; and that there were &quot;relatively large responses at low application rates&quot;.

A 1998 study by scientists at the North Carolina State University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences showed that addition of humate to soil significantly increased root mass in creeping bentgrass turf.

A 2018 study by scientists at the University of Alberta showed that humic acids can reduce prion infectivity in laboratory experiments, but that this effect may be uncertain in the environment due to minerals in the soil that buffer the effect.

== Anthropogenic production ==
Humans can affect the production of humic substances via a variety of ways: by making use of natural processes by composting lignin or adding biochar (see soil rehabilitation), or by industrial synthesis of artificial humic substances from organic feedstocks directly. These artificial substances may be similarly divided into artificial humic acid (A-HA) and artificial fulvic acid (A-FA).

Lignosulfonates, a by-product from the sulfite pulping of wood, are valorized in the industrial fabrication of concrete where they serve as water reducer, or concrete superplasticizer, to decrease the water-cement ratio (w/c) of fresh concrete while preserving its workability. The w/c ratio of concrete is one of the main parameter controlling the mechanical strength of hardened concrete and its durability. The same wood pulping process can also be applied to obtain humus-like substances by hydrolysis and oxidation. A kind of artificial &quot;lignohumate&quot; can be directly produced from wood in this way.

Agricultural litter can be turned into an artificial humic substance by a hydrothermal reaction. The resulting mixture can increase the content of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and total organic carbon (TOC) in soil.

Lignite (brown coal) may also be oxidized to produce humic substances, reversing the natural process of coal formation under anoxic and reducing conditions. This form of &quot;mineral-derived fulvic acid&quot; is widely used in China. This process also occurs in nature, producing leonardite.

===Economic geology===
In economic geology, the term &quot;humate&quot; refers to geological materials, such as weathered coal beds (leonardite), mudrock, or pore material in sandstones, that are rich in humic acids. Humate has been mined from the Fruitland Formation of New Mexico for use as a soil amendment since the 1970s, with nearly 60,000 metric tons produced by 2016. Humate deposits may also play an important role in the genesis of uranium ore bodies.

==Technological applications==
The heavy-metal binding abilities of humic acids have been exploited to develop remediation technologies for removing lead from wastewater. To this end, Yurishcheva et al. coated magnetic nanoparticles with humic acids. After capturing lead ions, the nanoparticles can then be captured using a magnet.

===Ancient masonry===
Archeology finds that ancient Egypt used mudbricks reinforced with straw and humic acids.

<doc id="1030414" wikidata="Q2787296" url="?curid=1030414" title="Adam Pascal">
<text>Adam Pascal (born October 25, 1970) is an American actor, singer, and musician, known for his performance as Roger Davis in the original Broadway and West End productions of Jonathan Larson&#x27;s musical &quot;Rent&quot;, the 2005 movie version of the musical, and the Broadway tour of &quot;Rent&quot; in 2009. He is also known for originating the role of Radames in Elton John and Tim Rice&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot;, for playing the Emcee in the 1998 revival of &quot;Cabaret&quot;, for playing Freddie Trumper in &quot;Chess&quot; at the New Amsterdam Theatre and Royal Albert Hall, and for playing Huey Calhoun in the Broadway company of &quot;Memphis&quot;. More recently, he played William Shakespeare in the Tony Award-winning musical &quot;Something Rotten!&quot;

==Early life==
Pascal was born in The Bronx, New York, and grew up in Woodbury, Nassau County, New York, with his mother, Wendy (née Frishman), and stepfather, Mel Seamon. He was raised Jewish. He graduated from Syosset High School. He then graduated from New York Institute of Technology. Before his interest in music, he was a personal trainer. Although he began as a rock musician playing in a number of bands (such as Mute) formed with his schoolmates, Pascal became drawn to musical theater.

==Career==
===Stage work===
A friend of his from high school (Idina Menzel&#x27;s boyfriend at the time) mentioned &quot;Rent&quot; to him. On a whim, he auditioned and was cast as the HIV-positive rock guitarist Roger Davis. His powerful tenor voice and his performance in &quot;Rent&quot; earned him a Tony nomination, a Theater World award, and an Obie Award. He left the show on November 2, 1997, but went on to reprise Roger when &quot;Rent&quot; opened in London.

The role helped Pascal gain fame on Broadway, and he was cast in the Elton John and Tim Rice musical &quot;Aida&quot; as the Egyptian general Radames with the original and final casts (former &quot;Rent&quot; castmate Idina Menzel would co-star as Amneris in 2001), and Kander and Ebb&#x27;s &quot;Cabaret&quot;, appearing in the show as the Emcee (closing cast). He also participated in several charity performances, including &quot;Chess&quot; in 2003 (playing the American, Freddie Trumper), &quot;Hair&quot; in 2004 (singing &quot;I Got Life&quot;), and the &quot;24 Hour Plays&quot; in 2005. He returned to &quot;Aida&quot; in 2004 to close the run of the show as Radames.

Along with original Broadway &quot;Rent&quot; cast member Anthony Rapp (Mark Cohen), Pascal returned to Broadway to star as Roger in &quot;Rent&quot; from July 30 to October 7, 2007. In January 2009, he and Rapp reprised their originating (and film) roles as Roger and Mark in &quot;Rent: The Broadway Tour&quot;, which played in many cities in North America, as well as stops in Japan and South Korea. At the tour&#x27;s Detroit, Michigan stop in February, Pascal suffered two herniated discs in his neck and was on medical leave for a week. His role was filled in by Cary Shields, who had played &quot;Roger&quot; in the Broadway, Canadian, &quot;Benny&quot; National Tour productions. Pascal made a full recovery and finished up the tour in early 2010. This tour closed on February 7, 2010.

Pascal reprised the role of Frederick Trumper, aka &quot;Freddie, The American&quot; in the London concert version of &quot;Chess&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall on May 12–13, 2008. His &quot;Rent&quot; and &quot;Aida&quot; co-star Idina Menzel played Florence. This performance was recorded; it has been televised, first on American and British television on June 17, 2009, and repeatedly in America on PBS stations as part of that network&#x27;s &quot;Great Performances&quot; series; and has been released on DVD.

Pascal joined the Broadway cast of &quot;Memphis&quot; on October 25, 2011, as Huey Calhoun. He replaced original cast member Chad Kimball in the role. He remained in the &quot;Memphis&quot; cast until the show&#x27;s closure on August 5, 2012.

Beginning April 8, 2013, Pascal starred as Billy Flynn in the long-running Broadway revival of &quot;Chicago&quot;. His last performance as Billy was June 16, 2013.

On November 7, 2016, Pascal joined the Broadway company of &quot;Something Rotten!&quot; as William Shakespeare in the show&#x27;s closing cast. He also played the same role for the entirety of the show&#x27;s first national tour alongside Rob McClure, Josh Grisetti, and Leah Hofmann, who were also in the closing cast of the show.

In late 2021, Pascal began performances as Edward Lewis in the U.S national tour of &quot;Pretty Woman: The Musical&quot;, a role which he had played on Broadway from January 15 to 20, 2019.

Pascal was cast as Ryuk in the English premiere of &quot;Death Note: the Musical&quot; for its concert run at the London Palladium in August 2023. Pascal directed a production of &quot;Rent&quot; for Long island&#x27;s From Stage to Screen, performances ran from July 28 to July 30, 2023. Pascal was set to direct &quot;Something Rotten!&quot; at Stage to Screen on Long Island but it was ultimately cancelled.

On November 4, 2024, it was announced that Pascal will be joining the off-Broadway musical, &quot;Drag: The Musical&quot; as the token straight man, Tom Hutchinson.

===Music===
Pascal believed he was looked upon solely as a Broadway singer, and thus returned to his rock and roll roots with a solo recording contract on Sh-K-Boom Records, which was founded by his &quot;Aida&quot; costar, Sherie Rene Scott and her husband Kurt Deutsch. He has released two solo rock albums, &quot;Model Prisoner&quot; (2000) and &quot;Civilian&quot; (2004), as well as a collaborative rock album &quot;Blinding Light&quot; (2008) with pianist Larry Edoff. He also contributed a cover of Billy Joel&#x27;s &quot;New York State of Mind&quot; to the CD &quot;Broadway Cares: Home for the Holidays&quot; (2001); the end credits song, &quot;Winter Light&quot;, from the movie &quot;Noel&quot; (2004); and the song &quot;Perfect Place&quot; on the album &quot;Listen&quot; which showcases songs written by adolescents who stutter (2009). In &quot;School of Rock&quot;, he played Theo, lead singer of the band No Vacancy, and sang on two songs on the soundtrack.

On July 4, 2006, Pascal took part in the Macy&#x27;s Fourth of July Celebration. He sang during the traditional fireworks display. He also performed in both the fifth- and tenth-anniversary celebrations of &quot;Rent&quot; on Broadway, in 2000 and 2005, respectively.

Pascal formed the band &quot;Me and Larry (Edoff)&quot; in 2006. The two musicians began composing and performing original material and reworked Broadway songs in small venues throughout the US. Pascal won the 2007–2008 Golden Icon Award for Best Small Venue Concert. The band&#x27;s first CD, &quot;Blinding Light&quot;, was released in May 2008 on Pascal&#x27;s own label. The CD is available at concerts and through Amazon and the band&#x27;s website (where a direct digital download is available).

 Pascal is developing a theatrical stage version of the classic 1988 concept album, &quot;&quot; by the progressive metal band, Queensrÿche. The band is one of Pascal&#x27;s musical influences, and has fully endorsed his efforts.

===Film work===
Pascal made his film debut in &quot;SLC Punk!&quot; (1999) and also appeared in &quot;School of Rock&quot; (2003) and &quot;Temptation&quot; (2004). The audio for &quot;Temptation&quot;, a musical, was recorded live on set during filming.

In late 2005, he, along with five others of the principal cast, reprised their roles in the film version of &quot;Rent&quot;, directed by Chris Columbus. Pop idol Justin Timberlake was considered for the role of Roger, but Columbus decided to stick with the original cast members. The film released on November 23, 2005.

In the independent movie &quot;Falling Star&quot; (formerly titled &quot;Goyband&quot;), Pascal stars as a former boy-band icon who is booked to play a show at a Kosher hotel but ends up shocking the guests with his sexy show. Fans were invited to participate in the movie as extras for the concert scenes. His co-stars are Amy Davidson, Cris Judd, Tovah Feldshuh, Dean Edwards, Tibor Feldman, and Natasha Lyonne. &quot;Goyband&quot; originally premiered at the Jerusalem Films Festival in December 2008. Its North American premiere was July 2009, on Long Island. The movie was bought by distributor MarVista Entertainment, which retitled it &quot;Falling Star&quot;.

Pascal also filmed another independent movie, &quot;Wild About Harry&quot;, about a gay couple who try to hide their relationship from family and neighbors in 1973, a few years following the Stonewall Riots.

Pascal reprised his role from &quot;SLC Punk!&quot; in the 2015 sequel, &quot;Punk&#x27;s Dead&quot;.

In 2015, Pascal starred in &quot;Alleluia! The Devil&#x27;s Carnival&quot; as The Agent, one of God&#x27;s top generals in Heaven.

===Television===
Pascal had a guest role as Dennis Hofferman, a murder victim, on an episode of &quot;Cold Case&quot;, with Tracie Thoms, his co-star from the film version of &quot;Rent&quot;, and Laura Bell Bundy, another Broadway star who originated the role of Elle Woods in &quot;Legally Blonde&quot;. The episode, called &quot;Willkommen&quot;, originally aired on April 2, 2006, and revolved around an amateur production of &quot;Cabaret&quot;.

Pascal provided the narration and sang a song, &quot;I&#x27;m Not an Egg Anymore&quot;, in the double-length episode &quot;Tale of the Mighty Knights&quot; for the show &quot;The Backyardigans&quot;.

==Personal life==
On December 19, 1998, Pascal married Cybele Chivian, the daughter of Eric S. Chivian, M.D., Director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at Harvard Medical School, and the granddaughter of writer Joseph Jay Deiss. The couple has two sons. Pascal and Chivian separated in 2021.

<text>Gerrit Zalm (; born 6 May 1952) is a retired Dutch politician of the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and businessman.

Zalm studied Economics at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, obtaining a Master of Economics degree, and worked as a civil servant for the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis from June 1975 until August 1994, and as a professor of Political economy at his alma mater from January 1990 until August 1994. After the 1994 general election, Zalm was appointed Minister of Finance in the Kok I cabinet, taking office on 22 August 1994. After the 1998 general election, Zalm continued his position in the Kok II cabinet. In the 2002 general election, Zalm was elected to the House of Representatives on 23 May 2002. Shortly after the election, party leader and parliamentary leader Hans Dijkstal announced he was stepping down and Zalm was unanimously selected as his successor as leader on 16 May 2002, and became parliamentary leader on 23 May 2002. For the 2003 general election, Zalm served as lead candidate, and following a successful cabinet formation that formed the Balkenende II cabinet was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister of the Netherlands and Minister of Finance, taking office on 27 May 2003. On 27 November 2004 Zalm announced he was stepping down as party leader in favor of and parliamentary leader Jozias van Aartsen. The Balkenende II cabinet fell on 30 June 2006 and was replaced by the caretaker Balkenende III cabinet, with Zalm continuing his offices. In August 2006, Zalm announced his retirement, stating he would not stand for the 2006 general election.

Zalm retired from active politics at 54 and became active in the private sector as a corporate director, and worked as a banker for the DSB Bank, Fortis Bank and ABN AMRO from July 2007 until February 2017. Following his retirement Zalm became active in the public sector as a non-profit director and served on several state commissions and councils on behalf of the government, and worked as a occasional mediator for coalition agreements. Zalm is known for his abilities as a skilful manager and effective debater and as of 2025 continues to comment on political affairs. He holds the distinction as the longest-serving Minister of Finance, with 11 years and 240 days, in Dutch history.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Gerrit Zalm was born on 6 May 1952 in Enkhuizen, Netherlands. Following his graduation from high school (&quot;HBS-A&quot; level) in Enkhuizen, Zalm began a study in economics at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam, from which he graduated in 1975. In the same year he joined the Ministry of Finance. From 1983 he worked for the Ministry of Economic Affairs, where he eventually became a director. In 1988 he was appointed deputy director of the Centraal Planbureau, a state institution that, among other things, calculates the financial effects of government plans. In 1989 he became director of this institute. In that capacity Zalm had, although not formally a politician, a significant influence on politics. From 1990 he also gave lectures at the Vrije Universiteit.

===Politics===
Between 22 August 1994 and 22 July 2002, Zalm, member of the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy, was Minister of Finance in the first and second Wim Kok administrations. The Dutch economy being very healthy during those years, he did not experience large difficulties. However, he did introduce certain standards that are in effect until now, among which the Zalmnorm (Zalm standard) which describes a state policy by which the state does not respond extremely to economic fluctuations but just counteracts them. During the first, short Balkenende administration, Zalm was the acting leader of the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy group in parliament. On 27 May 2003 he started his third term as Minister of Finance, in the second Balkenende administration, also serving as Deputy Prime Minister. On 30 June 2006, he succeeded Laurens Jan Brinkhorst as Minister of Economic Affairs, ad interim, with most tasks delegated to Undersecretary Karien van Gennip. On 7 July 2006 Joop Wijn was appointed as the new Minister of Economic Affairs.

===Banking===
On 26 November 2006, Zalm announced in the Sunday morning talk show &quot;Buitenhof&quot; that he would step down from politics and would probably seek employment in the private sector. Three months after his 2007 retirement from politics, Zalm went to work for DSB Bank, a company that he had criticized in his earlier role as finance minister for what he considered misleading advertising for consumer credit. He initially held the position of chief economist, but quickly became CFO of the faltering bank after the Dutch central bank DNB had threatened to curtail DSB&#x27;s financial autonomy.

On 21 November 2008 it was announced by Prime minister Jan Peter Balkenende that Zalm will be the new CEO of the bank resulting from the merger of ABN and Fortis Netherlands, two recently nationalized banks. This new position came under scrutiny after Zalm&#x27;s previous employer DSB went bankrupt in 2009. The Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) and the central bank both investigated Zalm&#x27;s role in DSB&#x27;s final years, with AFM concluding that he was &quot;not competent&quot; and should be dismissed from ABN AMRO&#x27;s board, while DNB decided to keep Zalm in his position.

===Personal===
Zalm is a fan of the game of pinball and during his second term as Minister of Finance he had a pinball machine in his department. He is an honorary member of the Dutch Pinball Association. In 2004 he had a cameo appearance in the movie &quot;Cool!&quot; by Theo van Gogh. In January 2019, in an episode of the Dutch version of &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, it became known that Zalm is related to rebel leader and pirate Pier Gerlofs Donia, through his mother&#x27;s family.

<doc id="1030420" wikidata="Q1530388" url="?curid=1030420" title="Equidistributed sequence">
<text>In mathematics, a sequence (&quot;s&quot;1, &quot;s&quot;2, &quot;s&quot;3, ...) of real numbers is said to be equidistributed, or uniformly distributed, if the proportion of terms falling in a subinterval is proportional to the length of that subinterval. Such sequences are studied in Diophantine approximation theory and have applications to Monte Carlo integration.

==Definition==
A sequence (&quot;s&quot;1, &quot;s&quot;2, &quot;s&quot;3, ...) of real numbers is said to be &quot;equidistributed&quot; on a non-degenerate interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] if for every subinterval [&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;] of [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] we have
:formula_1
(Here, the notation |{&quot;s&quot;1...,&quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot;} ∩ [&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;]| denotes the number of elements, out of the first &quot;n&quot; elements of the sequence, that are between &quot;c&quot; and &quot;d&quot;.)

For example, if a sequence is equidistributed in [0, 2], since the interval [0.5, 0.9] occupies 1/5 of the length of the interval [0, 2], as &quot;n&quot; becomes large, the proportion of the first &quot;n&quot; members of the sequence which fall between 0.5 and 0.9 must approach 1/5. Loosely speaking, one could say that each member of the sequence is equally likely to fall anywhere in its range. However, this is not to say that (&quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot;) is a sequence of random variables; rather, it is a determinate sequence of real numbers.

===Discrepancy===
We define the discrepancy &quot;D&quot;&quot;N&quot; for a sequence (&quot;s&quot;1, &quot;s&quot;2, &quot;s&quot;3, ...) with respect to the interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] as

:formula_2

A sequence is thus equidistributed if the discrepancy &quot;D&quot;&quot;N&quot; tends to zero as &quot;N&quot; tends to infinity.

Equidistribution is a rather weak criterion to express the fact that a sequence fills the segment leaving no gaps. For example, the drawings of a random variable uniform over a segment will be equidistributed in the segment, but there will be large gaps compared to a sequence which first enumerates multiples of ε in the segment, for some small ε, in an appropriately chosen way, and then continues to do this for smaller and smaller values of ε. For stronger criteria and for constructions of sequences that are more evenly distributed, see low-discrepancy sequence.

===Riemann integral criterion for equidistribution===
Recall that if &quot;f&quot; is a function having a Riemann integral in the interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;], then its integral is the limit of Riemann sums taken by sampling the function &quot;f&quot; in a set of points chosen from a fine partition of the interval. Therefore, if some sequence is equidistributed in [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;], it is expected that this sequence can be used to calculate the integral of a Riemann-integrable function. This leads to the following criterion for an equidistributed sequence:

Suppose (&quot;s&quot;1, &quot;s&quot;2, &quot;s&quot;3, ...) is a sequence contained in the interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]. Then the following conditions are equivalent:
# The sequence is equidistributed on [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;].
# For every Riemann-integrable (complex-valued) function , the following limit holds:

:: formula_3
This criterion leads to the idea of Monte-Carlo integration, where integrals are computed by sampling the function over a sequence of random variables equidistributed in the interval.

It is not possible to generalize the integral criterion to a class of functions bigger than just the Riemann-integrable ones. For example, if the Lebesgue integral is considered and &quot;f&quot; is taken to be in &quot;L&quot;1, then this criterion fails. As a counterexample, take &quot;f&quot; to be the indicator function of some equidistributed sequence. Then in the criterion, the left hand side is always 1, whereas the right hand side is zero, because the sequence is countable, so &quot;f&quot; is zero almost everywhere.

In fact, the de Bruijn–Post Theorem states the converse of the above criterion: If &quot;f&quot; is a function such that the criterion above holds for any equidistributed sequence in [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;], then &quot;f&quot; is Riemann-integrable in [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;].

==Equidistribution modulo 1==
A sequence (&quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, &quot;a&quot;3, ...) of real numbers is said to be equidistributed modulo 1 or uniformly distributed modulo 1 if the sequence of the fractional parts of &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;, denoted by (&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;) or by &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; − ⌊&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;⌋, is equidistributed in the interval [0, 1].

===Examples===

* The equidistribution theorem: The sequence of all multiples of an irrational &quot;α&quot;,
::0, &quot;α&quot;, 2&quot;α&quot;, 3&quot;α&quot;, 4&quot;α&quot;, ...
:is equidistributed modulo 1.
* More generally, if &quot;p&quot; is a polynomial with at least one coefficient other than the constant term irrational then the sequence &quot;p&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is uniformly distributed modulo 1.

This was proven by Weyl and is an application of van der Corput&#x27;s difference theorem.

* The sequence log(&quot;n&quot;) is &quot;not&quot; uniformly distributed modulo 1. This fact is related to Benford&#x27;s law.
* The sequence of all multiples of an irrational &quot;α&quot; by successive prime numbers,
::2&quot;α&quot;, 3&quot;α&quot;, 5&quot;α&quot;, 7&quot;α&quot;, 11&quot;α&quot;, ...
:is equidistributed modulo 1. This is a famous theorem of analytic number theory, published by I. M. Vinogradov in 1948.
* The van der Corput sequence is equidistributed.

===Weyl&#x27;s criterion===
Weyl&#x27;s criterion states that the sequence &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; is equidistributed modulo 1 if and only if for all non-zero integers ℓ,
:formula_4
The criterion is named after, and was first formulated by, Hermann Weyl. It allows equidistribution questions to be reduced to bounds on exponential sums, a fundamental and general method.

====Generalizations====
* A quantitative form of Weyl&#x27;s criterion is given by the Erdős–Turán inequality.
* Weyl&#x27;s criterion extends naturally to higher dimensions, assuming the natural generalization of the definition of equidistribution modulo 1:

The sequence &quot;v&quot;&quot;n&quot; of vectors in R&quot;k&quot; is equidistributed modulo 1 if and only if for any non-zero vector ℓ ∈ Z&quot;k&quot;,

: formula_5

====Example of usage====
Weyl&#x27;s criterion can be used to easily prove the equidistribution theorem, stating that the sequence of multiples 0, &quot;α&quot;, 2&quot;α&quot;, 3&quot;α&quot;, ... of some real number &quot;α&quot; is equidistributed modulo 1 if and only if &quot;α&quot; is irrational.

Suppose &quot;α&quot; is irrational and denote our sequence by &quot;a&quot;&quot;j&quot; = &quot;jα&quot; (where &quot;j&quot; starts from 0, to simplify the formula later). Let &quot;ℓ&quot; ≠ 0 be an integer. Since &quot;α&quot; is irrational, &quot;ℓα&quot; can never be an integer, so formula_6 can never be 1. Using the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series,
:formula_7
a finite bound that does not depend on &quot;n&quot;. Therefore, after dividing by &quot;n&quot; and letting &quot;n&quot; tend to infinity, the left hand side tends to zero, and Weyl&#x27;s criterion is satisfied.

Conversely, notice that if &quot;α&quot; is rational then this sequence is not equidistributed modulo 1, because there are only a finite number of options for the fractional part of &quot;a&quot;&quot;j&quot; = &quot;jα&quot;.
===Complete uniform distribution===
A sequence formula_8 of real numbers is said to be &quot;k-uniformly distributed mod 1&quot; if not only the sequence of fractional parts formula_9 is uniformly distributed in formula_10 but also the sequence formula_11, where formula_12 is defined as formula_13, is uniformly distributed in formula_14. 

A sequence formula_8 of real numbers is said to be &quot;completely uniformly distributed mod 1&quot; it is formula_16-uniformly distributed for each natural number formula_17. 

For example, the sequence formula_18 is uniformly distributed mod 1 (or 1-uniformly distributed) for any irrational number formula_19, but is never even 2-uniformly distributed. In contrast, the sequence formula_20 is completely uniformly distributed for almost all formula_21 (i.e., for all formula_19 except for a set of measure 0). 

===van der Corput&#x27;s difference theorem===
A theorem of Johannes van der Corput states that if for each &quot;h&quot; the sequence &quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot;+&quot;h&quot; − &quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot; is uniformly distributed modulo 1, then so is &quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot;.

A van der Corput set is a set &quot;H&quot; of integers such that if for each &quot;h&quot; in &quot;H&quot; the sequence &quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot;+&quot;h&quot; − &quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot; is uniformly distributed modulo 1, then so is s&quot;n&quot;.

===Metric theorems===
Metric theorems describe the behaviour of a parametrised sequence for almost all values of some parameter &quot;α&quot;: that is, for values of &quot;α&quot; not lying in some exceptional set of Lebesgue measure zero.

* For any sequence of distinct integers &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot;, the sequence (&quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot;&quot;α&quot;) is equidistributed mod 1 for almost all values of &quot;α&quot;.
* The sequence (&quot;α&quot;&quot;n&quot;) is equidistributed mod 1 for almost all values of &quot;α&quot; &gt; 1.
It is not known whether the sequences (&quot;e&quot;&quot;n&quot;) or (&quot;n&quot;) are equidistributed mod 1. However it is known that the sequence (&quot;α&quot;&quot;n&quot;) is &quot;not&quot; equidistributed mod 1 if &quot;α&quot; is a PV number.

==Well-distributed sequence==
A sequence (&quot;s&quot;1, &quot;s&quot;2, &quot;s&quot;3, ...) of real numbers is said to be well-distributed on [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] if for any subinterval [&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;] of [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] we have
:formula_23
&quot;uniformly&quot; in &quot;k&quot;. Clearly every well-distributed sequence is uniformly distributed, but the converse does not hold. The definition of well-distributed modulo 1 is analogous.

==Sequences equidistributed with respect to an arbitrary measure==
For an arbitrary probability measure space formula_24, a sequence of points formula_25 is said to be equidistributed with respect to formula_26 if the mean of point measures converges weakly to formula_26:
:formula_28
In any Borel probability measure on a separable, metrizable space, there exists an equidistributed sequence with respect to the measure; indeed, this follows immediately from the fact that such a space is standard. 

The general phenomenon of equidistribution comes up a lot for dynamical systems associated with Lie groups, for example in Margulis&#x27; solution to the Oppenheim conjecture.

<text>A key generator is a protocol or algorithm that is used in many cryptographic protocols to generate a sequence with many pseudo-random characteristics. This sequence is used as an encryption key at one end of communication, and as a decryption key at the other. One can implement a key generator in a system that aims to generate, distribute, and authenticate keys in a way that without the private key, one cannot access the information in the public end.

Examples of key generators include linear-feedback shift registers (LFSR) and the Solitaire (or Pontifex) cipher.

<doc id="1030429" wikidata="Q5424718" url="?curid=1030429" title="FCC Song">
<text>&quot;FCC Song&quot; is a deliberately controversial and explicit song by British-born Monty Python comic Eric Idle. Idle, who later became a resident of the U.S. state of California, recorded the song in early 2004 in reaction to a fine by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for saying &quot;fuck&quot; on a radio station. The song is also known by its refrain &quot;fuck you very much&quot;. Despite being nominally aimed at the FCC, the lyrics primarily target well-known figures associated with the George W. Bush administration, including Dick Cheney and John Ashcroft among others. Idle stated about the song that

:&quot;...it&#x27;s dedicated to the FCC and if they broadcast it, it will cost a quarter of a million dollars&quot;.

Idle has made the song freely available for download at the Monty Python website. The lyrics&#x27; strong anti-Republican stance has prompted numerous anti-Bush websites to link to the song or to mirror it. The word &quot;fuck&quot; occurs 14 times in the song; the words &quot;bitch&quot; and &quot;dickhead&quot; also appear once each.

An earlier song, &quot;I Bet You They Won&#x27;t Play This Song on the Radio&quot;, written and performed by Idle on &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Contractual Obligation Album&quot; (1980), touched on this subject, but with two major differences: It limited its scorn to radio programmers and it bleeped (using various sound effects) the various obscenities. Accordingly, many programmers did indeed play that song on the radio.

<text>Placer Dome Inc. was a large mining company specializing in gold and other precious metals, with corporate headquarters in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

In August 2005, the company had interests in 16 gold mining operations in 7 countries; it had a market capitalization of $6.7 billion USD (on June 30, 2005). For the year 2004, it had sales of $1,888 million, net earnings of $284 million, and cash from operations of US$376 million.

The company was purchased by Barrick Gold in 2006, and was assimilated into Barrick.

==History==
Placer Dome was formed in Vancouver in 1987, by amalgamating Placer Development Ltd. of Vancouver (founded in British Columbia in 1926), Dome Mines Limited of Toronto (founded in Ontario in 1910, to build the original Dome Mine), and Campbell Red Lake Mines Ltd. of Toronto (founded in Ontario in 1944).

Placer Dome was heavily invested in mines in South Africa prior to the end of apartheid. Sensing that their ability to continue owning mines in post-apartheid South Africa would diminish, they started investing in Australia and Papua New Guinea, and briefly became Australia&#x27;s biggest landlord.

Placer Dome operated the Detour Lake gold mine before selling the property in 1988 while it was being decommissioned. Placer Dome acquired several mining companies over its lifetime: Kiena Gold Mines Ltd. in 1988 (0.92 shares of Placer Dome Inc. for each share of Kiena Gold Mines Ltd.), Sigma Gold Mines Ltd. in 1988 (0.97 shares of Placer Dome Inc. for each share of Sigma Gold Mines Ltd.), Placer Pacific Ltd. in 1997 (0.066 shares of Placer Dome Inc. for each share of Placer Pacific Ltd. held), Getchell Gold Corporation in 1999 (2.45 shares of Placer Dome Inc. for each common share of Getchell Gold Corporation held), AurionGold Ltd. in 2003 (17.5 shares of Placer Dome Inc. for every 100 AurionGold shares, plus US$0.28 per AurionGold share), and East African Gold Mines Ltd. in 2003 ($252.4 million in cash).

In 2002 the first 3.6 tonne, 17 kW, hydrogen-powered hydrail mining locomotive for Placer Dome was demonstrated in Val-d&#x27;Or, Quebec.

== Reputation ==
Placer Dome was generally perceived as more progressive than its competitors in terms of community engagement and environmental concerns, although its rushed context analysis and community engagement in the set up of Porgera Gold Mine resulted in misunderstandings and community tension that led to &quot;war&quot; between the local population and Placer Dome, and also later Barrick Gold, once they bought Placer Dome.
==Operations==
In August 2005 Placer Dome had interests in 16 mining operations in seven countries: Campbell, Musselwhite, and Porcupine in Canada; Golden Sunlight, Turquoise Ridge, Cortez, and Bald Mountain in the United States; Zaldívar and La Coipa in Chile; North Mara in Tanzania; South Deep in South Africa; Porgera in Papua New Guinea; and Osborne, Henty, Kalgoorlie, and Granny Smith in Australia.

In New South Wales Australia, Placer Dome obtained ownership of the defunct Timbarra Gold Mine, where it achieved some local acclaim for setting new, higher State standards for mining rehabilitation.

In Papua New Guinea, at the Porgera Gold Mine, Placer Dome severely contaminated the Porgera river, surrounding rivers and the gulf of Papua. In 2005, Akali Tange Association published their report &quot;The Shooting Fields of Porgera Joint Venture&quot; which documents allegations of murder of local residents by mine security contractors.
==Controversy==
Placer Dome (and now Barrick Gold) are defendants in an ongoing court battle over the highly controversial Marcopper mining disaster, which took place at the Marcopper Mine (run by Marcopper, a Placer Dome subsidiary) on the island of Marinduque, Philippines.

==Takeover==
Barrick Gold acquired 100% of Placer Dome shares on January 20, 2006, and integrated the company into its own. Once Barrick gained over 90% of the company shares it could force people to sell their shares to gain the 100% which it required. March 8, 2006 was the final day for trading of Placer Dome&#x27;s common shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange.

<doc id="1030433" wikidata="Q730065" url="?curid=1030433" title="Shuji Nakamura">
<text>is a Japanese-American electronic engineer and inventor of the blue LED, a major breakthrough in lighting technology. Nakamura specializes in the field of semiconductor technology, and he is a professor of materials science at the College of Engineering of the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB).

Together with Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano, Nakamura received the 2014 Nobel Prize for Physics &quot;for the invention of efficient blue light-emitting diodes, which has enabled bright and energy-saving white light sources&quot;. In 2015, his input into the commercialization and development of energy-efficient white LED lighting technology was recognized by the Global Energy Prize. In 2021, Nakamura, along with Akasaki, Nick Holonyak, M. George Craford, and Russell D. Dupuis, were awarded the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering &quot;for the creation and development of LED lighting, which forms the basis of all solid-state lighting technology&quot;.

==Career==
Nakamura graduated from the University of Tokushima in 1977 with a B.Eng. degree in electronic engineering, and obtained an M.Eng. degree in the same subject two years later, after which he joined the Nichia Corporation, also based in Tokushima. It was while working for Nichia that Nakamura invented the method for producing the first commercial high brightness gallium nitride (GaN) LED whose brilliant blue light, when partially converted to yellow by a phosphor coating, is the key to white LED lighting, which went into production in 1993.

Previously, J. I. Pankove and co-workers at RCA put in considerable effort but did not make a marketable GaN LED in the 1960s. The principal problem was the difficulty of making strongly p-type GaN. Nakamura drew on the work of another Japanese group led by Professor Isamu Akasaki, who published their method to make strongly p-type GaN by electron-beam irradiation of magnesium-doped GaN; however, this method was not suitable for mass production. Nakamura developed a thermal annealing method much more suitable for mass production. In addition, he and his co-workers worked out the physics and pointed out the culprit was hydrogen, which passivated acceptors in GaN.

At the time, many considered creating a GaN LED too difficult to produce; therefore, Nakamura was fortunate that the founder of Nichia, (1912–2002), was willing to support and fund his GaN project. However, the senior Ogawa ceded the presidency to his son-in-law Eiji Ogawa (in 1989). The company under Eiji&#x27;s direction ordered him to suspend work on GaN, claiming it was consuming too much time and money. Nakamura continued to develop the blue LED on his own and in 1993 succeeded in making the device.

Despite these circumstances, once Nakamura succeeded in creating a commercially viable prototype, 3 orders of magnitude (1000 times) brighter than previously successful blue LEDs, Nichia pursued developing the marketable product. The company&#x27;s gross receipt surged from just over ¥20 billion (≈US$200 million) in 1993 to ¥80 billion (≈US$800 million) by 2001, 60 percent of which was accounted for by sales of blue LED products. The company&#x27;s workforce doubled between 1994 and 1999 from 640 to 1300 employees.

Nakamura was awarded a D.Eng. degree from the University of Tokushima in 1994. He left Nichia Corporation in 1999 and took a position as a professor of engineering at UCSB.

In 2001, Nakamura sued his former employer Nichia over his bonus for the discovery as a part of a series of lawsuits between Nichia and Nakamura with Nichia&#x27;s US competitor Cree Inc.; they agreed in 2000 to jointly sue Nichia at the expense of Cree and Nakamura received stock options from Cree. Nakamura claimed that he received only (≈) for his discovery of &quot;404 patent,&quot; though Nichia&#x27;s president Eiji Ogawa&#x27;s side of the story was that he was shocked beyond belief that the court would award Nakamura ¥20 billion, and downplaying the significance of the &quot;404 patent,&quot; opined that the company had adequately compensated him for the innovation through promotions and bonuses amounting to ¥62 million over 11 years and annual salary which was raised to ¥20 million by the time Nakamura quit Nichia.

Nakamura sued for ¥2 billion (&lt;US$20 million) as his fair share for the invention, and the district court awarded him ten times the amount, ¥20 billion (&lt;US$200 million). However, Nichia appealed the award and the parties settled in 2005 for ¥840 million (≈US$8.1 million, less than 5% of the award amount), which was still the largest payment ever paid by a Japanese company to an employee for an invention, an amount only enough to cover legal expenses incurred by Nakamura.

Nakamura has also worked on green LEDs and is responsible for creating the white LED and blue laser diodes used in Blu-ray Discs and HD DVDs.

Nakamura is a professor of Materials at the UCSB. In 2008, Nakamura, along with fellow UCSB professors Dr. Steven P. DenBaars and Dr. James Speck, founded Soraa, a developer of solid-state lighting technology built on pure gallium nitride substrates. Nakamura holds 208 US utility patents as of 5 May 2020.

In November 2022, Nakamura co-founded Blue Laser Fusion, a commercial fusion company, with Hiroaki Ohta, a former president of Tokyo-based drone maker ACSL. In July 2023, Blue Laser Fusion raised $25 million from venture capital firm JAFCO Group and the Mirai Creation Fund, which is backed by Toyota Motor and other investors and managed by the SPARX Group.

==Personal life==
Nakamura is married to Yuki Nakamura.

<doc id="1030440" wikidata="Q4014556" url="?curid=1030440" title="Virino">
<text>The virino is a hypothetical infectious particle once theorized to be the cause of scrapie and other degenerative diseases of the central nervous system. It was thought to consist of nucleic acids within a protective coat of host cell proteins. The hypothesis was never widely accepted, and the causative agents responsible for these diseases are now widely accepted to be prions.

==Origin of the concept==
The virino was described partially to protect the central dogma of molecular biology, which was threatened by the existence of a series of degenerative neurological TSE diseases including kuru, CJD, scrapie in sheep, and BSE in cattle. The central dogma states that nucleic acids act as information carriers, and DNA and RNA make proteins. Proteins alone cannot make DNA. However, studies searching for the transmission agent of scrapie and other TSEs failed to culture bacteria, and tests attacking nucleic acids strands have little effect on the infectivity of TSE solutions. These failures largely rule out a virus as the infective agent. Experiments using electron beams designed to disrupt large molecules have been performed to investigate the size of the agent show that it is very small: much smaller than the smallest known virus.

The virino also has the benefit of explaining the traits of TSEs which resemble nucleic acids: for example, their occurrence in strains, which positively indicates the TSE agent is information carrying, and not merely a toxin.

==History of description==
In 1971, Dickinson, AG and Meikle, VM provided a hypothesis for the replication of the scrapie agent. This hypothesis was based on the discovery of a single autosomal gene controlling the scrapie incubation period in mice and on observations about strains of the scrapie agent. They dubbed the gene sinc for scrapie incubator. This hypothesis proposed that the gene products of each sinc allele contributed to a multimeric protein structure, which then formed a &#x27;replication site&#x27; for the scrapie agent. The replication of the agent would depend on how the particular strain interacted with the replication site and of what the site was composed. The fact that different strains of scrapie were known had suggested the agent was similar to conventional viruses in that it carried a genome composed of nucleic acids. Thus, variants could arise during incubation, giving rise to new strains. No host-encoded properties were found to determine scrapie agent strain differences. This was thought to prove that the genome of the agent could vary independently and, although replicated by normal host mechanisms, was not coded by the host. The term &#x27;virino&#x27; was coined to reflect the small size, immunological neutrality, and virus-like nature of the infectious particles.

Thus, in the nucleotide model proposed by Dickinson, AG, and Outram, GW in 1979, the lifecycle of the scrapie agent included a stage where the genome was bound to host protein, probably a multimeric protein complex, derived from the &quot;sinc&quot; gene. Recalling Enrico Fermi&#x27;s word play on a neutron-like particle, Outram coined the term &#x27;virino&#x27; to describe a small virus. In the virino model, the host protein protects the scrapie agent nucleic acids from degradation and prevents the host from raising an immune response, since the protein/nucleic acid complex is seen as a legitimate part of the host. However, the presumed scrapie-associated nucleic acid has not been identified, and physical or chemical evidence for its presence is lacking.

<text>The Minister for Supplies () was created by the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1939, to assist Ireland through World War II, or the Emergency, as it was referred to by the Government of Ireland. Although the legislation creating the new department was not passed until 21 December 1939, it was given retrospective effect, and was deemed to have come into force on 8 September 1939.

The Minister for Supplies was charged with controlling production, distribution and pricing of vital supplies during the Emergency. According to the historian Bryce Evans, Minister Seán Lemass introduced full rationing in Ireland &#x27;too late&#x27;, ensuring the black market trumped later state attempts at equitable distribution amid the British wartime supply squeeze. Earlier historians had pointed to Lemass&#x27;s successes in stockpiling essential goods.

The minister&#x27;s functions were transferred to the Minister for Industry and Commerce on abolition of the office on 1 August 1945. Lemass had been serving in both positions from 1941.

<text>Interstate 294 (I-294) is a tolled auxiliary Interstate Highway in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Illinois. Forming the southern portion of the Tri-State Tollway in Illinois, I-294 runs from South Holland at I-80/I-94 and Illinois Route 394 (IL 394) to Northbrook at I-94. I-294 is long; are shared with I-80. It serves as a bypass around the city of Chicago.

==Route description==
I-294 begins at the interchange between I-94, I-80, and IL 394 in Lansing. I-94 splits off toward Chicago while I-80/I-294 heads west as an eight-lane tollway and crosses above a railroad track and Thorn Creek in Thornton. The highway crosses under the Chicago Southland Lincoln Oasis, Chicago Road, another railroad track, and State Street through residential areas. I-80/I-294 is between the Thornton Quarry on an elevated area before crossing the quarry on a bridge and passing under another railroad track. The highway then enters East Hazel Crest and has a cloverleaf interchange with IL 1 (Halsted Street) and widens to 10 lanes. Then, I-80/I-294 reenters the residential areas and center cross over Center Avenue, the Canadian National Railway Chicago Subdivision, the Metra Electric, and the Dixie Highway. After crossing under 171st Street, I-80 splits off and heads toward Des Moines, Iowa, and I-294 narrows to eight lanes in Hazel Crest.

After the I-80 split, I-294 heads north and enters Markham. It crosses under 167th Street and goes through the 163rd Street toll plaza. I-294 has a cloverleaf interchange with US Route 6 (US 6; 159th Street) and turns northwest toward an incomplete interchange with I-57. I-294 then enters Posen and has a partial interchange with IL 83 (147th Street). I-294 turns west to cross the Rock Island District and Kedzie Avenue. I-294 turns northwest, and enters Midlothian. It crosses over South Claire Boulevard, Pulaski Road, the Midlothian Turnpike, 135th Street, and the Calumet River. I-294 has an interchange with IL 50 and IL 83 (Cicero Avenue) with a northbound exit and southbound entrance via 127th Street in Alsip. It then passes by warehouses and crosses over Ridgeland Avenue, 115th Street, 111th Street, 107th Street, the tracks of the SouthWest Service, Southwest Highway, Stony Creek, all while entering Worth, Chicago Ridge, and Bridgeview. The tollway enters Justice and has another interchange with US 12/US 20 (95th Street) and IL 43 (Harlem Avenue). I-294 then crosses over 87th Street and Roberts Road. It then goes through the 82nd/83rd street toll plaza. It crosses over 88th Avenue and has an interchange with IL 171 (Archer Avenue), US 45, US 12, and US 20 (La Grange Road). I-294 then crosses the Canadian National Railway Joliet Subdivision, the Illinois and Michigan Canal, the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, the Des Plaines River, the BNSF Railway Chillicothe Subdivision, Santa Fe Drive, and an access road on the Mile-Long Bridge. I-294 then enters Indian Head Park and has an interchange with I-55 and Joliet Road and turns north.
I-294 then passes under Plainfield Road, crosses a small creek, crosses under the Hinsdale Oasis, and enters Hinsdale. I-294 passes under 55th Street, 47th Street, the BNSF Railway Line, and a trail. I-294 then has a cloverleaf interchange with US 34 and enters Oak Brook. I-294 crosses under 31st Street and Cermak Road. I-294 goes through the Cermak Road toll plaza and the Hillside Strangler. It crosses over IL 38 (Roosevelt Road) after the plaza. It enters Hillside and crosses over I-88 and I-290. It then crosses under Saint Charles Road, enters Berkeley, and crosses the Union Pacific West Line. I-294 enters Northlake and crosses over US 20 (Lake Street), IL 64 (North Avenue), and Grand Avenue. It then takes the Grand Avenue Curve, turning northeast as it approaches O&#x27;Hare International Airport. I-294 crosses over the Union Pacific New Line and Wolf Road, briefly enters Bensenville, crosses over the Bensenville Railyard of the Canadian Pacific Railway and Milwaukee District West Line, and US 12/US 45 (Mannheim Road), enters Schiller Park, crosses under the former O&#x27;Hare Oasis, and passes by the Irving Park toll plaza (for southbound lanes). It passes through the Chicago Panhandle, which connects O&#x27;Hare to the rest of the city. It then enters Rosemont, crossing under Balmoral Avenue, I-190 and the Blue Line, and crossing over I-90, having an interchange with each of the three previously mentioned roadways.

I-294 enters Des Plaines, passing by the Touhy Avenue toll plaza (for northbound lanes), and crosses over River Road. It then has a partial interchange with Touhy Avenue. I-294 crosses the Des Plaines River and the Union Pacific Northwest Line, and enters Park Ridge. I-294 has a partial interchange with US 14 (Dempster Street), enters Glenview, and crosses over Northwest Highway and Ballard Road. It has another partial interchange with IL 58 and crosses over the Union Pacific New Line, Central Avenue, IL 21 (Milwaukee Avenue), and Lake Avenue. It has a diamond interchange with Willow Road and enters Northbrook. It crosses under Sanders Road and IL 68 (Dundee Road) and crosses over Sanders Road. It enters Deerfield and terminates at a partial interchange with I-94 just south of Lake-Cook Road, the county line, to which I-294 has full access.

==History==

The portion of the Borman Expressway that was completed from Gary westward and the Kingery Expressway were originally designated as I-80, I-90, and I-294 from shortly after the Interstate Highway program was enacted until about 1965 when the connection between the Borman and the Indiana Toll Road was completed, and I-90 was swapped with I-94 west of that junction (and east of where those routes share the same road in Chicago), cutting back I-294 to its current south terminus (eliminating the Indiana part of I-294).

I-294 was constructed largely before the growth and maturation of the suburbs that run along the corridor. As a result, the vast majority of the interchanges are partial or were configured to have entrance ramps feeding the toll plazas. Long gaps between exit ramps are common, the gap between Cicero Avenue (IL 50/IL 83) and 95th Street (US 12/US 20) being one of the more notable ones. Partial interchanges are located at Roosevelt Road (IL 38; northbound exit, southbound entrance), Irving Park Road (IL 19) (southbound exit, northbound entrance), Touhy Avenue (northbound exit, southbound entrance), Dempster Street (US 14; northbound exit, southbound entrance), and Golf Road (IL 58; southbound exit, northbound entrance).

From 1992 to 1993, the central portion of I-294 between Balmoral Avenue and 95th Street was widened to eight lanes. As part of the project, the 79th Street exit was removed while the 75th Street/Willow Springs Road exit was constructed. It also caused southbound 83rd Street Toll Plaza to relocate north. Several former partial interchanges have been converted to full interchanges, with automated toll collection facilities on the new ramps, such as at 159th Street (US 6; northbound on and southbound off added) and 95th Street (US 12/US 20; southbound on and northbound off added). Between 2006 and 2009, the southern and northern portions of I-294 (IL-394 to 95th Street and I-90 to Lake Cook Road respectively) were fully reconstructed and expanded, bringing the entire highway up to eight lanes.

The Illinois State Toll Highway Authority (ISTHA) and the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) are partnering to construct a new interchange to connect I-294 to I-57. The primary interchange connections between I-294 and I-57 were completed in 2014, while the remaining ramps except for northbound I-57 to southbound I-294 and northbound I-294 to southbound I-57 were completed on September 11, 2022.

The central portion of I-294 between Balmoral Avenue and 95th Street is currently being reconstructed and widened to a five/six-lane cross-section, with the inside shoulder being a flex lane that can be used during emergencies or heavy congestion. The work also includes reconfiguring the interchange with I-88/I-290. It required the demolition of the Hinsdale Oasis. The entire project is scheduled to be completed in 2026.

<doc id="1030458" wikidata="Q1050878" url="?curid=1030458" title="Cathedral (band)">
<text>Cathedral were a doom metal band from Coventry, England. The group gained attention upon release of its debut album, &quot;Forest of Equilibrium&quot; (1991), which is considered a classic of the genre. However, the band&#x27;s sound evolved quickly and began to adopt characteristics of 1970s metal, hard rock and progressive rock. After releasing ten full-length albums and touring extensively for over two decades, Cathedral broke up after the release of &quot;The Last Spire&quot; in 2013.

==History==
===Early history (1989–1991)===
In 1989, Lee Dorrian left Napalm Death because he was reportedly tiring of the punk scene and did not like the death metal direction which Napalm Death was taking. Cathedral was formed after Lee Dorrian and Mark Griffiths (a Carcass roadie) met and discussed their love for bands like Black Sabbath, Candlemass, Pentagram, Trouble, and Witchfinder General. The band was founded in 1989 by Dorrian, Griffiths and Garry Jennings (formerly of thrash metal band Acid Reign). Dorrian was the only founding member to remain with Cathedral for its duration, although Jennings&#x27; departure ultimately proved to be temporary. Cathedral released &quot;The Forest of Equilibrium&quot; through Earache. According to Dorrian, only Winter or Autopsy were doing something similar, sound-wise, at the time.

===The Columbia years (1992–1994)===
After the release of the &quot;Soul Sacrifice&quot; EP, Cathedral signed with Columbia Records. That enabled the successful two-month &quot;Campaign for Musical Destruction Tour&quot; in the United States.
Cathedral&#x27;s experience on Columbia was described by Dorrian as &quot;surreal&quot;. As Dorrian explained,

Cathedral&#x27;s major label debut, &quot;The Ethereal Mirror&quot;, was noted by Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic for its experimentation, upbeat tempos, and groove-laden guitar riffs. After releasing &quot;The Ethereal Mirror&quot; in 1993, Cathedral was dropped by Columbia the following year.

===Back to Earache (1995–2001)===

The band resumed its relationship with Earache Records, which lasted until 2001. During this time, Cathedral released four full-length albums that continued to explore faster rhythms and 1970s-hard rock-influenced guitar riffs before returning to a relatively slow cadence for &quot;Endtyme&quot; in 2001.

===Switching labels (2002–2010)===

Cathedral signed with Spitfire Records and released &quot;The VIIth Coming&quot;. After releasing a single album on Spitfire, Cathedral signed to Nuclear Blast for their final three albums. These albums included the &quot;inspired&quot; and &quot;quirky&quot; but &quot;uneven&quot; &quot;The Garden of Unearthly Delights&quot;, the double-disc &quot;The Guessing Game&quot;, which was touted as the &quot;most psychedelic, progressive material in the band&#x27;s entire catalog&quot; and the &quot;true doom&quot; of the band&#x27;s farewell album, &quot;The Last Spire&quot;.

===&quot;The Last Spire&quot; and split (2011–present)===
While Cathedral had contemplated disbanding in the past, most recently after the release of &quot;The Garden of Unearthly Delights&quot; in 2006, on 6 February 2011, Cathedral announced that they would disband after the release of &quot;The Last Spire&quot; in April 2013. Dorrian explained that &quot;It&#x27;s simply time for us to bow out. Twenty one years is a very long time and it&#x27;s almost a miracle that we managed to come this far!&quot; Cathedral played their last show in Perth, Western Australia during the Soundwave 2012 tour.

Shortly before the release of &quot;The Last Spire&quot;, Dorrian told &quot;Noisecreep&quot; that there will never be a Cathedral reunion, and called that idea &quot;absolutely stupid.&quot; Guitarist Gaz Jennings added that chances of a Cathedral reunion are &quot;very, very slim&quot;, and that he &quot;just can&#x27;t see&quot; it happening in the future. He also stated that Dorrian has &quot;moved on&quot; and does not want to be involved in a reunion. Three out of four of the final members of Cathedral reformed the band Septic Tank after Cathedral&#x27;s break up. 

When asked in July 2020 by &quot;Decibel&quot; magazine about the possibility of a Cathedral reunion, Dorrian said: &quot;To just reform and cash in on the lucrative offers we&#x27;ve been getting ever since we broke up would feel a bit like we&#x27;re just doing it for the cash, which is never what it was about in the first place. Never say never, I guess, but it&#x27;s very doubtful. We ended it for a reason.&quot;

==Musical style==
Cathedral&#x27;s releases have been marked by sharp shifts in style. While &quot;Forest of Equilibrium&quot; was firmly entrenched in a slow, heavy doom sound, elements of 1970s metal and groovier riffs entered its sound beginning with the &quot;Soul Sacrifice&quot; EP. By the time that &quot;The Ethereal Mirror&quot; was released, the band had incorporated references to 1970s music, such as the disco influences heard on &quot;Midnight Mountain&quot;.

As Dorrian explains, the band&#x27;s original sound was a product of the immediate musical environment combined with the band members&#x27; influences:

Beginning with the &quot;Soul Sacrifice&quot; EP, the band began to incorporate a diverse array of 1970s influences into its sound. With 2001&#x27;s &quot;Endtyme&quot;, Cathedral re-introduced the slower, doomy elements that had not been as prevalent on its previous four albums.

&quot;The Guessing Game&quot; represented another development in the band&#x27;s sound, with Cathedral&#x27;s progressive and psychedelic influences coming to the forefront. For Dorrian, the album&#x27;s direction was a result of the fact that:

Remarking on Cathedral&#x27;s penchant for evolving its sound, Dorrian said:

<doc id="1030462" wikidata="Q727249" url="?curid=1030462" title="Carlinhos Brown">
<text>Antônio Carlos Santos de Freitas, known professionally as Carlinhos Brown (Brazilian Portuguese: , 23 November 1962), is a Brazilian singer, percussionist, and record producer from Salvador, Bahia. His musical style blends funk, latin music, R&amp;B, soul music, reggae, and traditional Brazilian percussion.

In 2012, he competed for an Oscar with the song &quot;Real in Rio&quot;, the result of a partnership with Sérgio Mendes for the soundtrack of the film Rio. Among the various awards received throughout his career, a Goya Award, two Latin Grammys and 8 nominations stand out, in addition to the trophy given in recognition of his work as an art educator by ISME - International Society of Musical Education.

==Early life==
He was born in Candeal Pequeno, a neighborhood in the Brotas area of Salvador da Bahia, Brazil, to Renato and Madalena. In 1967 he was still a child when Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil, two 25-year-old musicians from Bahia, started Tropicália, which would radically change Brazilian music.

Osvaldo Alves da Silva, his mentor, introduced him to Brazilian folklore.

==Musical career==

===Early years===
Brown learned to play various percussion instruments as he grew up and in the 1980s he began to collaborate with other artists. In 1984 he played with Luís Caldas&#x27;s band Accordes Verdes, one of the originators of samba-reggae. In 1985, Luís Caldas recorded &quot;Visão de Cíclope&quot;, composed by Carlinhos Brown, and it became one of the hottest songs on Salvador&#x27;s radio stations. Following this, he composed &quot;Remexer&quot;, &quot;O Côco&quot; and &quot;É Difícil&quot; for other artists, and in 1989 he formed part of Caetano Veloso&#x27;s band on the record &quot;Estrangeiro&quot;, penning a song, &quot;Meia Lua Inteira&quot;, that was very successful in Brazil and outside the country. earning him a Caymmi trophy, one of the most important music awards in Bahía, and led to his participation in world tours with João Gilberto, Djavan, and João Bosco.

===Timbalada===

In the late 1980s Brown started to form percussion ensembles to unite the people in his hometown. He simply gathered people in the streets and taught them basic percussion patterns. Candeal is a town whose residents share deep roots in Candomblé, a religion African slaves brought to Brazil. The customs and ceremonies shared in this religion brought a lot of drumming into the everyday lives of those living in Candeal. Carlinhos realized this enriched culture was an opportunity for growth. Eventually this gathering of peoples grew into a band called Timbalada which became so popular along with the other band he composed of Candeal residents – Vai Quem Vem (Who Comes, Goes)- that he had to build a concert stadium to hold all the people who came into town to watch them practice. Timbalada recorded eight albums and toured various countries around the world. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine named their debut album the &quot;best record produced in Latin America in 1993&quot;. Many of the proceeds went towards fixing up the streets of Candeal by repaving roads and renovating houses.

In 1992, Brown appeared on several songs on the album &quot;Ritual Beating System&quot; by the project Bahia Black. Organized by prolific producer Bill Laswell, Bahia Black brought together Brazilian musicians with American jazz players. Also in 1992, Brown composed and performed songs for Sergio Mendes&#x27;s &quot;Brasileiro&quot; album, his songs for that album including &quot;Fanfarra&quot;, &quot;Magalenha&quot; and &quot;Indiado&quot;.

===Solo career ===

On the heels of Timbalada&#x27;s success, in 1996 Brown released a solo album called &quot;Alfagamabetizado&quot;, on which he sang, composed, and played the instruments. That year also saw Brown appearing on the album &quot;Roots&quot; by the Brazilian metal band Sepultura.

In 1997, Brown made a cameo appearance performing the song &quot;A Namorada&quot; in the 1997 American film &quot;Speed 2: Cruise Control&quot;, and appeared on the film&#x27;s soundtrack. He also appeared in a Brazilian movie, &quot;Navalha na Carne&quot; (&quot;Razor in the Flesh&quot;).

In 1998, he collaborated with Bonga and Marisa Monte on the track &quot;Mulemba Xangola&quot; for the AIDS benefit compilation album &quot;Onda Sonora: Red Hot + Lisbon&quot; produced by the Red Hot Organization.

Brown&#x27;s second album, &quot;Omelete Man&quot;, was released in 1998, and was followed by a third album, &quot;Bahia do Mundo, Mito e Verdade&quot;, in 2001.

In 2001, Brown had an infamous appearance at the Rock in Rio festival. Along with his music not being embraced by a crowd of mostly Guns N&#x27; Roses fans, Brown ordered to shut down the firehoses that sprayed the audience with water in the preceding performance by Pato Fu to alleviate the intense Rio de Janeiro heat, making the displeased concertgoers throw water bottles at him during the entire concert.

He released &quot;Carlinhos Brown É Carlito Marrón&quot; in 2003 and collaborated with DJ Dero on the 2004 album &quot;Candyall Beat&quot;. The &quot;Carlito Marrón&quot; album achieved considerable success in Spain, where it was repackaged a year later with extra tracks, achieving a hit single &quot;Maria Caipirinha&quot; (with DJ Dero) on the Spanish charts in 2004. Carlinhos Brown remains active in the Salvador da Bahía community, founding the Pracatum Music School in the Candeal neighborhood in 1994 as a non-profit organization dedicated to education, cultural, and community development programs in the city, including a professional music school. In addition, he has his own recording label, Candyall Records. Brown has also begun painting, and his art works have been well received.

On 10 April 2007, Carlinhos&#x27; album &quot;A Gente Ainda Não Sonhou&quot; was released by SonyBMG. It was recorded in Salvador de Bahia between March 2005 and September 2006. Two songs were co-written with Marisa Monte and Arnaldo Antunes.

Carlinhos Brown is extensively featured in the 2004 documentary &quot;El Milagro de Candeal&quot;. The title is translated as &quot;The Miracle of Candeal&quot; and features the influence and transformation Brown has done for Candeal. What was once considered a dangerous shanty town is now seen as colorful music town.

In 2011, he collaborated with Los Van Van to record the track &quot;Soy Loco Por Tí, América&quot; for the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s most recent charitable album &quot;Red Hot + Rio 2&quot;. The album is a follow-up to the 1996 &quot;Red Hot + Rio&quot;. Proceeds from the sales will be donated to raise awareness and money to fight AIDS/HIV and related health and social issues. More recently, he was featured in Shakira&#x27;s song &quot;LA LA LA&quot; which was the kick off song for the 2014 World Cup in Rio.

In 2012 on 2023, Carlinhos Brown was selected to be a judge in &quot;The Voice Brasil&quot; (Season 1), a reality talent show. His role as a judge continued consecutively for nine years. He has also been a judge on the spinoff show, &quot;The Voice Kids&quot;, throughout its eight seasons.

===Tribalistas===

In 2002 he formed the group Tribalistas with Arnaldo Antunes and Marisa Monte, contributing vocals and drums to their self-titled album &quot;Os Tribalistas&quot;. Their single &quot;Já Sei Namorar&quot; became the number-one song on Brazilian radio stations, and their second single &quot;Velha Infância&quot; met with almost equal success. The album spawned two more hits in Brazil:, &quot;Passe em Casa&quot;, co-written with Margareth Menezes, and &quot;É Você&quot;. In 2003, Tribalistas won the Best Album, Best DVD, and Best Song (for &quot;Já Sei Namorar&quot;) awards from the Multishow of Brazilian Music.

===Social activism===
Carlinhos established the Pracatum School or otherwise known as the Pracatum Project in 1994. Having established a name for himself, he wanted to do more than just write powerful lyrics, he wanted to help his hometown and the children, whom like him, had high hopes with such little resources. The proceeds of this school along with Timbalada went towards improving health reforms, urban development such as paving the streets that once had overflowing sewer water, and renovating unfinished housing projects.

==Family==
He and Raquel Machado (also Raquel Jacobs) have a daughter, Nina De Freitas (b. 1990). His current wife is Helena Buarque and they have four children together: Francisco (also known as Chico; b. 1996), Clara (b. 1998), Cecília (b. 2006) and Leila (b. 2009). He has a son named Miguel (b. 1997) from another relationship.

<doc id="1030463" wikidata="Q159045" url="?curid=1030463" title="Andreas Brehme">
<text>Andreas &quot;Andi&quot; Brehme (; 9 November 1960 – 20 February 2024) was a German professional football player and coach. At international level, he is best known for scoring the winning goal for Germany in the 1990 FIFA World Cup final against Argentina from an 85th-minute penalty kick. At club level, Brehme played for several teams in Germany and also had spells in Italy and Spain.

A versatile attacking full-back with an eye for goal, Brehme was capable of playing anywhere along the flank on either side of the pitch, and was known for his crossing ability, ambidexterity, and his accuracy from free-kicks and penalties, possessing a powerful shot.

==Club career==
Andreas Brehme was born in Hamburg and started his career with the city&#x27;s local side HSV Barmbek-Uhlenhorst.

Brehme played for 1. FC Kaiserslautern from 1981 to 1986, before moving to Bayern Munich, where he played from 1986 to 1988, winning the Bundesliga in 1987. After that, he joined Italian side Inter Milan, playing there from 1988 to 1992, alongside compatriots Lothar Matthäus and Jürgen Klinsmann, and winning the Serie A in 1989 – also being named player of the year – and the UEFA Cup in 1991. Brehme played the 1992–93 season at Real Zaragoza in La Liga, before returning to Germany once again in 1993 to play for Kaiserslautern once again. He won the German Cup with the club in 1996, although they suffered relegation during the same season; nevertheless, Brehme remained with the team even when they were relegated, playing a key role in the side&#x27;s immediate promotion the following season. After subsequently winning the Bundesliga with the club in 1998, Brehme ended his playing career as a footballer after having played 301 matches.

==International career==
As a member of the (West) Germany national team, Brehme took part at UEFA Euro 1984, the 1984 Summer Olympics, the 1986 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 1988, the 1990 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 1992, and the 1994 World Cup; he was named in the team of the tournament at Euro 84, and helped Germany to the semi-finals of Euro 88, on home soil, scoring a goal in the nation&#x27;s 1–1 opening draw against Italy. At Euro 1992, he won a runners-up medal, as Germany lost out 2–0 to Denmark in the final; he was once again named to the team of the tournament. Brehme won a runners-up medal at the 1986 FIFA World Cup, as Germany lost the final to Argentina, yet he won the World Cup in 1990 against the same opponents, later being named to the competition&#x27;s All-star team. In the 1986 World Cup semi-final he scored a deflected free-kick against France, and in the 1990 semi-final he also scored a free-kick goal against England, which also took a deflection off of English defender Paul Parker, however. In the 1990 edition of the tournament, en route to the final, he also previously set up Klinsmann&#x27;s headed goal in Germany&#x27;s opening 4–1 against Yugoslavia, and scored the second goal against the Netherlands with a right-footed curler in the second round. In the 1990 World Cup final, a 1–0 victory over Argentina, he scored the goal, a penalty kick with his right foot. The only other penalty kick, taken in open play for Germany, was against England in a 1986 World Cup warm-up match in Mexico. Brehme scored in the victorious penalty-shootout against Mexico in the 1986 World Cup quarter-finals with his left foot, while he scored his nation&#x27;s first spot-kick in the penalty shoot-out victory against England in the 1990 World Cup semi-finals with his right foot. Brehme&#x27;s last of his 86 caps for the national team came during the 1994 FIFA World Cup, which ended with a disappointing quarter-final exit for his team after a loss against Bulgaria.

==Managerial career==
After retiring from football, Brehme went on to become a coach. He managed his former club 1. FC Kaiserslautern from 2000 to 2002. He then managed 2. Bundesliga side SpVgg Unterhaching. He was then assistant coach alongside Giovanni Trapattoni at VfB Stuttgart, but both were sacked after only a few months at the club.

==Style of play==
An efficient attacking full-back or wing-back, Brehme was regarded as one of the best left-backs of his generation; although he was usually deployed on the left side of his team&#x27;s defensive line, he was a highly versatile player, who was capable of playing anywhere along the flank, on either side of the pitch, and could also play in a more offensive role. He was also used in the centre of the pitch on occasion, as a defensive midfielder. Although he was not particularly quick, he was known for his excellent technical ability, stamina, defensive skills, anticipation, and tactical intelligence, as well as his ability to make attacking runs, which enabled him to cover the flank effectively and contribute at both ends of the pitch.

A set-piece specialist, Brehme is considered to be one of the greatest free-kick takers and crossers of all time, and was known for his ability to strike the ball with power and swerve. However, Brehme&#x27;s most distinctive skill was that he was one of the few players in the world who was genuinely ambidextrous, and could play with both feet equally well, making him very valuable as an outfield player; his ability with either foot led his national team manager Franz Beckenbauer to state: &quot;I have known Andy for 20 years and I still don&#x27;t know if he is right or left-footed&quot;. He was well known for taking penalties (although not exclusively) with his right foot and taking free kicks and corners with his left foot; this made him quite an unpredictable player to read during matches. Although he was reportedly naturally left-footed, it is believed that Brehme felt that his right foot was actually more accurate than his left, but that he had a more powerful shot with his &quot;weaker&quot; left foot. This was shown when, in the 1990 World Cup final, Brehme took the spot kick that won West Germany the trophy, with his right foot, but four years earlier, Brehme scored in the 1986 World Cup quarter-final penalty shootout against Mexico with a left foot piledriver. In addition to his abilities as a footballer, Brehme was highly regarded for his strength of character and composure under pressure, as well as for having the tendency to score &quot;clutch&quot; goals for his team in important games, as demonstrated by his ability to score decisive penalties in World Cup knockout matches, which led him to be considered a &quot;big game player&quot; in the media.

Although he was known to be tenacious player, he also stood out for his professionalism throughout his career, both on and off the pitch. Lothar Matthäus described Brehme as the best player he played with.

==Death==
Brehme died from a cardiac arrest on 20 February 2024 at the age of 63.

<doc id="1030468" wikidata="Q1434924" url="?curid=1030468" title="Value added">
<text>Value added is a term in financial economics for calculating the difference between market value of a product or service, and the sum value of its constituents. It is relatively expressed to the supply-demand curve for specific units of sale. It represents a market equilibrium view of production economics and financial analysis. Value added is distinguished from the accounting term added value which measures only the financial profits earned upon transformational processes for specific items of sale that are available on the market.

In business, &quot;total value added&quot; is calculated by tabulating the &quot;unit value added&quot; (measured by summing unit profit — the difference between sale price and production cost, unit depreciation cost, and unit labor cost) per each unit sold. Thus, total value added is equivalent to revenue minus intermediate consumption. Value added is a higher portion of revenue for integrated companies (e.g. manufacturing companies) and a lower portion of revenue for less integrated companies (e.g. retail companies); total value added is very nearly approximated by compensation of employees, which represents a return to labor, plus earnings before taxes, representative of a return to capital.

== Definition ==
In microeconomics, value added may be defined as the market value of aggregate output of a transformation process, minus the market value of aggregate input (or aggregate inputs) of a transformation process. One may describe value added with the help of Ulbo de Sitter&#x27;s design theory for production synergies. He divides transformation processes into two categories, parts and aspects. Parts can be compared to timeline stages, such as first preparing the dish, then washing it, then drying it. Aspects are equated with area specialization, for example that someone takes care of the part of the counter that consists of glass, another takes care of the part that consists of plates, a third takes care of cutlery. An important part of understanding value added is therefore to examine delimitations.

In macroeconomics, the term refers to the contribution of the factors of production (i.e. capital and labor) to raise the value of the product and increase the income of those who own the said factors. Therefore, the national value added is shared between capital and labor.

Outside of business and economics, value added refers to the economic enhancement that a company gives its products or services prior to offering them to the consumer, which justifies why companies are able to sell products for more than they cost the company to produce. Additionally, this enhancement also helps distinguish the company&#x27;s products from those of its competitors.

== National accounts ==

The factors of production provide &quot;services&quot; which raise the unit price of a product (X) relative to the cost per unit of intermediate goods used up in the production of X.

In national accounts, such as the United Nations System of National Accounts (UNSNA) or the United States National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA), gross value added is obtained by deducting intermediate consumption from gross output. Thus gross value added is equal to net output. Net value added is obtained by deducting consumption of fixed capital (or depreciation charges) from gross value added. Net value added therefore equals gross wages, pre-tax profits net of depreciation, and indirect taxes less subsidies.

== Value added tax ==

Value-added tax (VAT) is a tax on sales. It is assessed incrementally on a product or service at each stage of production and is intended to tax the value that is added by that production stage, as outlined above by unit value added.

<text>There were 40 known prisoner-of-war camps across Canada during World War II, although this number also includes internment camps that held Canadians of German and Japanese descent. Several reliable sources indicate that there were only 25 or 26 camps holding exclusively prisoners from foreign countries, nearly all from Germany.

The camps were identified by letters at first, then by numbers. In addition to the main camps there were branch camps and labour camps. The prisoners were given various tasks; many worked in the forests as logging crews or on nearby farms; they were paid a nominal amount for their labour. Approximately 11,000 were thus employed by 1945.

The largest number of military prisoners of war was recorded as 33,798 by several sources. In addition to POWs, some civilian internees were held in the camps and some estimates include such prisoners.

All POWs were protected by the conditions of the Geneva Convention. There are claims that conditions in the Canadian camps tended to be better than average, and many times better than the conditions of the barracks that Canadian troops were kept in. They were guarded by the Veterans Guard of Canada, mostly men who had been soldiers during WW I. It is believed by some that the lenient treatment foiled many escape attempts before they even started. It is told that a group of German prisoners returned to Ozada camp after escaping because of encountering a grizzly bear. Starting in 1945, all POWs were released and returned to their home countries. None were allowed to remain in Canada, but some later returned as immigrants.

<text>==Israel (from territorial waters)==
All of the offshore stations broadcasting to Israel were operating from within Israeli territorial waters under a strange arrangement that attempted to prevent intrusion by terrorists on the one hand, while turning a blind eye to the illegality of the offshore broadcasting operations taking place on board the anchored ships.

*1973
::Voice of Peace in Hebrew, Arabic and English aboard the MV &quot;Peace&quot; - created with the aim of promoting peace in the Middle East. The station was generally tolerated by the Israeli Government and it was intentionally sunk in international waters on November 28, 1993, following the signing of the Oslo Peace Accords which it was thought was validation of its mission.

*1981
::TV Odelia transmitting from the ship MV &quot;Odelia&quot; - anchored off the coast of Tel Aviv.

*1988
::Arutz Sheva in Hebrew, English and other languages from the MV &quot;Hatzvi&quot; at anchorage off the coast of Tel Aviv.

*1991
::Radio One broadcasting from the MV &quot;Air&quot; anchored off Haifa. The station was eventually given a license in 1995 to broadcast from within Israel.

*1993
::Radio Hof aboard the MV &quot;Hof&quot;.

*1995
::Radio Dan aboard the MV &quot;Kajun&quot;, anchored off the coast of Tel Aviv.

<text>The strict definition of a &quot;pirate radio&quot; station is a station that operates from sovereign territory without a broadcasting license, or just beyond the territorial waters of a sovereign nation from on board a ship or other marine structure with the intention of broadcasting to that nation without obtaining a broadcasting license from that nation (such as Radio Caroline before its present incarnation).

==Cuba==
===Pirate radio by Cuban exiles===
Unlike the sanctioned and fully licensed transmissions by the United States government, a number of groups in exile, mainly based in Florida, have attempted various offshore radio broadcasts to Cuba, from time to time. These stations are mainly short lived and sporadic in transmission times, but because their broadcasts are not licensed by any nation, their signals are considered to be from &quot;pirate radio stations&quot; and the USA has taken various physical and legal steps to close them down at different times.

==Mexico==
===Pirate radio in Mexico===

There are a number of pirate radio stations in Mexico. Radio Insurgente, the voice of the Zapatista movement, operated from 2003 to 2009. The station was unlicensed, but according to the San Andres Accords, the indigenous communities targeted by Radio Insurgente had the right to broadcast their own content. The most recent example of a true pirate radio station in Mexico is La Tremenda 106.5 in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas. It broadcast international contemporary music and news in Spanish and English. It used the fictitious U.S. call sign &quot;KLPR&quot; on its logo. The station began operations in May 2006, was shut down in June 2008 by the federal police in a &quot;violent&quot; take over. It was suspected that the signal was also used for transmitting messages of members of organized crime. Today, there are several other pirate stations in Nuevo Laredo as well.

The border-blaster or other border stations in Mexico do not meet either above definitions of &quot;pirate radio station&quot;, however may be considered as such by some governments.

===Border blasters===

From the earliest days of the history of broadcasting, a number of radio stations licensed in Mexico, became known to the general public as border-blasters. This was due to their excessive use of power which was necessary to reach their intended audience in American cities far north of the border. The traditional border-blasters were AM radio stations; though there are numerous FM radio and even television stations along the border that broadcast to the U.S. from Mexico, the power of FM stations along the border is limited by a U.S.-Mexican agreement.

However, because these stations are licensed by the government of Mexico, they can only be classified as &quot;pirate radio stations&quot; in the same way that the British government classified Radio Luxembourg as a &quot;pirate radio station&quot;. Radio Luxembourg was a licensed station broadcasting with a power and on a frequency that the British authorities objected to, because the intended audience for its programs were located within the United Kingdom. The objection by the government of the United Kingdom to commercial broadcasts from Luxembourg, France and other countries, was primarily based upon its protection of the non-commercial BBC Radio monopoly. Also, the UK at the time required a license for radios, which was limited to UK stations; it still requires a license for television sets. However, the U.S. has never required a license to listen to broadcast radio or TV; today, it even issues routine licenses under the Brinkley Act, originally enacted to silence the border-blaster charlatan John R. Brinkley, for the operation of Mexican stations from studio facilities in the U.S.

==United States==
===Land-based unlicensed broadcasts===

In the United States, the term &quot;pirate radio&quot; implies the unlicensed broadcasting use of any part of the radio spectrum that is reserved for use by governmental, public or commercial licensees by the Federal Communications Commission. This includes the FM, AM and shortwave radio bands.

Compared to authoritarian systems of government which restrict access to the means of communication, the airwaves of the USA are relatively free from direct government censorship. As a result of this difference, the term &quot;pirate radio&quot; has a different interpretation than in countries where access to communication is limited.

In the United States, pirate radio is frequently, but not always, associated with anarchism, which considers governmental spectrum regulatory schemes as favoring the interests of large corporations, due to reasons such as high licensing costs. Therefore, some anarchists consider pirate radio transmissions to be a challenge to that authority.

Pirate radio is also in large part the resulting backlash from Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s Title 47 CFR Part 15, which prohibits certain power broadcasting. NPR and the NAB convinced the FCC to eliminate the class D license in 1979. This kept all new low-power stations from getting a license, and bumped all of the old ones down to secondary status, forcing many more off the air since then. Despite this, an explosion of broadcast translators on FM, technically identical but rebroadcasting other stations, most part of religious broadcasting networks, has occurred since then. This further fueled pirate operators in the 1980s and 1990s.

In 1982, an organization of pirate radio monitoring enthusiasts was formed by Darren Leno. Known as the Association of Clandestine Radio Enthusiasts (ACE) the organization was and remains a very popular conduit for sharing information about North American pirate radio and other unusual radio transmissions.
Because of this severe lack of access, numerous pirate radio operators (such as Stephen Dunifer), as well as other groups petitioned the FCC for a new LPFM service. After many years of trying, this finally was passed around 2000, although it blocked former pirate operators from holding licenses. Lobbied by the commercial radio industry, the U.S. Congress intervened and limited the new service even further, though technical tests later proved this to be baseless, and the added restrictions were lifted.

Although this should mean that pirate radio has seen a decrease, most of the licensees are churches, colleges, and state or local government transportation departments, as the FCC requires the licensee to be a non-profit organization. Pirate radio also continues because legal open spots on the FM dial have been filled in since and because of the 1979 ruling, by both full-power and translator stations.

Part 15 of the FCC rules allows the use of spectrum without a license but emissions pursuant to this rule are not practical for broadcasting due to extremely restrictive power levels which limit range (range varies depending on frequency spectrum). Part 15 is intended to allow for operation of a broad range of electrical devices that emit radio energy either as an intended element of their operation (e.g. garage door openers, FM modulators for iPod auto use) or as a by-product of their operation. Despite the limited range possible under Part 15, some small broadcast stations are operated within its parameters, while others operate claiming to be Part 15 compliant but with signals exceeding what is permitted under the rule.

Because basic radio transmission equipment is relatively easy to obtain in the US and because it is relatively easy to hide, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which has the authority to regulate radio communications, sometimes has difficulty in finding and prosecuting offenders who transmit without a license. Triangulation may be used, but most frequently a spectrum analyzer is driven around the affected area, with a person monitoring where the suspect signal is highest, and another one looking for any obvious signs such as an antenna or small tower (like that used for amateur radio).

The FCC maintains a database of alleged pirate radio broadcasters in the United States on a state-by-state basis which is made available to Congress as a report.

<text>In the United States at the end of World War II, there were prisoner-of-war camps, including 175 Branch Camps serving 511 Area Camps containing over 425,000 prisoners of war (mostly German). The camps were located all over the US, but were mostly in the South, due to the higher expense of heating the barracks in colder areas. Eventually, every state (with the exceptions of Nevada, North Dakota, and Vermont) and Hawaii, then a territory, had each at least a POW camp.

Some of the camps were designated &quot;segregation camps&quot;, where Nazi &quot;true believers&quot; were separated from the other prisoners due to retaliation killings and terror toward POWs they thought were too friendly to their American captors.

After the Armistice of Cassibile, approximately 90% of Italian POWs pledged to help the United States, by volunteering in Italian Service Units (ISU). Due to a labor shortage, Italian Service Units worked on Army depots, in arsenals and hospitals, and on farms. POWs who were a part of the ISU received better housing, uniforms and pay.

At its peak in May 1945, a total of 425,871 POWs were held in the US: 371,683 Germans, 50,273 Italians, and 3,915 Japanese.

<text>Commonwealth Edison, commonly known by syllabic abbreviation as ComEd, is the largest electric utility in Illinois, and the primary electric provider in Chicago and much of Northern Illinois. Its service territory stretches roughly from Iroquois County on the south to the Wisconsin border on the north and from the Iowa border on the west to the Indiana border on the east. For more than 100 years, Commonwealth Edison has been the primary electric delivery services company for Northern Illinois. Today, ComEd is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation, one of the nation&#x27;s largest electric and gas utility holding companies. ComEd provides electric service to more than 3.8 million customers across Northern Illinois. The company&#x27;s revenues totaled more than $7 billion in 2023.

, ComEd has interconnections with We Energies, ITC Midwest, Ameren, American Electric Power, Northern Indiana Public Service, and MidAmerican Energy (MEC).

==History==

===Founding===

The earliest predecessor of Commonwealth Edison was the Isolated Lighting Company, established in early 1881 by George H. Bliss as a subsidiary of Thomas Edison&#x27;s company to sell small Edison-patented generators and lighting systems, each serving one building or several nearby buildings. In 1882, this company was taken over by the Western Edison Light Company, which was chartered by several prominent Chicagoans to not only take over Isolated Lighting&#x27;s role as Edison&#x27;s agent in Chicago, but also to develop a central station electric system. Western Edison installed the first incandescent lighting in a Chicago home, that of stockholder John W. Doane, in 1882, and it was first lit on November 10 of that year.

===Chicago Edison===
In March, 1887, John M. Clark (president of Western Edison), Robert Todd Lincoln, and John B. Drake obtained a franchise from Chicago to distribute electricity in the downtown area, bounded by North Avenue, 39th Street, and Ashland Avenue. They then formed the Chicago Edison Company, which took over all of Western Edison&#x27;s business on July 2, 1887. Chicago Edison&#x27;s first central generating station, designed by chief engineer Frederick Sargent, opened at 139 (later 120) West Adams Street in August, 1888. This first station was intended to serve an area bounded by Harrison Street, Market Street and Water Street (both now Wacker Drive), and Michigan Avenue, and served this area with an Edison-patented direct current system until it closed in 1914 or 1915.

===The Samuel Insull Era===

By 1892, Chicago Edison&#x27;s load had grown to 3,200 kilowatts, the full capacity of its generating station. Its growth showed no sign of slowing, especially with plans in the works to host the 1893 Columbian Exposition. Its president, E. T. Watkins, had resigned the year before, and it was clear that new leadership was needed. In New York City, meanwhile, Thomas Edison had been bought out of his company as it was being consolidated into the General Electric Company. One of Edison&#x27;s associates, Samuel Insull, had however been retained as the second vice-president of General Electric, and was subsequently offered the presidency of the company. Instead, Insull agreed to stay on only long enough to oversee the consolidation of Edison&#x27;s companies.

The board of Chicago Edison wrote to Insull, asking for a recommendation for their president. In reply, Insull applied for the job, saying, &quot;It is the best opportunity that I know of in the United States to develop the business of the production and distribution of electrical energy.&quot; The board accepted his application, and on May 26, 1892, Insull was elected president of Chicago Edison.

Upon his arrival, Insull found that Chicago Edison was one of nearly 30 electric companies operating in Chicago, all competing for business. While prevailing opinion at the time held that competition between the many companies was the best way to improve service and keep prices low, Insull believed that a regulated monopoly, giving exclusive operating rights in a specific territory to one company in exchange for state control over service terms and prices, would be most beneficial for both utilities and customers. While state regulation did not begin until 1914, Insull began forming a monopoly on electric service by acquiring many of his competitors. By 1895, he had acquired enough of them, and their rights to use the different manufacturers&#x27; equipment, that he had obtained a complete monopoly on electric service in Chicago Edison&#x27;s territory.

Insull also initiated construction of a much larger power plant on Harrison Street, west of the Chicago River. While its original capacity of 6,400 kilowatts, twice that of the Adams Street Station and the largest in the United States, seemed wildly optimistic when it opened in August, 1894, Insull believed that the economy of scale provided by such a large station would offset the initial cost. Aside from this point, the size of the station allowed it to replace the Adams Street Station, which had become both overloaded and obsolete. Insull&#x27;s optimism was rapidly justified: the Harrison Street Station reached its original capacity within the first several years, and was expanded to 16,200 kilowatts by 1903, the year Fisk Generating Station put large steam turbines into service.

In 1907, Chicago Edison combined with Commonwealth Electric to form Commonwealth Edison Company. Six years later, it absorbed the independent Cosmopolitan Electric Company, and with that purchase effectively became the sole electric provider in Chicago.

Insull also founded Public Service Company of Northern Illinois, which developed rural electrification in northern Illinois outside Chicago. Public Service and ComEd, along with many other companies, were subsidiaries of Insull&#x27;s Middle West Utilities Company until Middle West&#x27;s collapse during the Great Depression. According to at least one source Insull was also the earliest to develop transmission companies, in the 1920s, a concept that was undermined by the development of Public Utility Commissions, in general, and the Public Utilities Company Holding Act of 1935, in particular. Necessary regulation in that form has been overcome by recent deregulatory measures.

In 1994, ComEd reorganized as a holding company, Unicom Corporation, with ComEd as its leading subsidiary. In 2000, UniCom merged with Philadelphia-based electric company PECO Energy to form Exelon.

===Central Illinois Electric and Gas Company===
In 1967, Commonwealth Edison acquired Rockford-based Central Illinois Electric and Gas Company. CIE&amp;G served the greater Rockford area and also had service territories in the Lincoln, Illinois area. 

===ComEd Transmission===
ComEd currently operates transmission lines at the following voltages: 765kV, 345kV, 138kV, 69kV. 34.5kV is the common sub-transmission voltage in the ComEd service territory. ComEd has major interconnections with MidAmerican Energy, AEP, ATC, Ameren and NIPSCO.

===ComEd Metering===
ComEd currently uses electric meters manufactured by Aclara. 

The company&#x27;s meter seal colors are the following:

Brown, Light Brown (Rust), Pink (Rose), Beige, Yellow and Green for a variety of purposes. Brown is the main color and is used by Metering personnel.

===Deregulation and divestiture===

By 1996, prevailing opinion on the utilities in the United States had changed. Rather than granting one company the exclusive right to generate, transmit and distribute electricity in a specific geographic area, and fixing the rates for that service as one package, it was commonly held that consumers would benefit from opening as much service as possible to competition on an open market. At the federal level, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had issued Order 888, opening access to the national transmission grids. Subsequent orders established an open energy marketplace and set rules for participation in it. However, it was left to the individual states to determine the best way to give their electricity customers access to the grid and the benefits of an open market.

For Illinois, the General Assembly passed the Electric Service Customer Choice and Rate Relief Law of 1997. The law ordered most Illinois electric utilities (including Commonwealth Edison) to provide their customers with the option of buying electricity from other suppliers. It also reduced base residential electric prices by 15%, with a further 5% decrease effective in 2001, and froze the reduced rates for ten years. Finally, it obligated the utilities, at the end of that ten-year period, to obtain their electricity through a competitive process.

These rules made it politically desirable for Commonwealth Edison to divest itself of its generation interests, in an attempt to distance itself from any allegations of bias in the competitive process. It sold its coal-fired generating stations to Midwest Generation in 2000, and sold its nuclear generating stations to Exelon Nuclear, another subsidiary of its holding company, in 2003. In theory, this separated the business of generating and selling power from the business of transmitting and distributing it, though in practice the holding company still manages and profits from both businesses. The distinction was blurred even further by the long-term price agreements that went with the sale of the generating stations, under which ComEd was entitled to purchase power below market rates through the end of the rate freeze.

===The 2007 Rate Case===

In 2006, as the end of the rate freeze drew near, Commonwealth Edison had to accommodate both a fully competitive market and the end of its own price agreements with the purchasers of its former generating stations. The most visible effect of the proposed rates was to increase residential electric rates sharply. This set the stage for a contentious and vigorous public debate about the rationale for electric deregulation.

ComEd&#x27;s proposal had two parts. First, delivery rates, which cover the cost of transporting electricity from the generators to the customer, would rise by 22% on the average. Second, the price of the electricity itself would be determined from a reverse auction, with the winning suppliers bound to supply energy to ComEd&#x27;s customers at some fixed price for a fixed period of time. The net effect was an increase of around 33% in the typical residential electric bill.

The prospect of seeing electric bills rise so dramatically drew much public outcry. It was widely claimed, at the time, that such a dramatic rise in rates was proof that the deregulated environment did nothing to help the consumer and was a sham. The Illinois General Assembly proposed extending the existing rate freeze for several more years in order to give time to develop a better plan. ComEd responded that extending the rate freeze would bankrupt it and that it did not have the ability to obtain electricity at a cost that would support the frozen rates.

In January 2007, the Chicago Tribune reported that Commonwealth Edison was behind Consumers Organized for Reliable Electricity (CORE), an organization that had been arguing against a proposed statewide freeze in electricity rates. The campaign uses a commonly used corporate tactic referred to as astroturfing, in which corporations fund organizations that appears to be grassroots or consumer rights focused to lobby on the corporation&#x27;s behalf with politicians and the public. Illinois then Lieutenant Governor Pat Quinn attempted to force CORE to put ComEd&#x27;s name on the ads in a petition filed with the Illinois Commerce Commission. The Commission ultimately dismissed the petition, but not before CORE agreed to disclose ComEd&#x27;s support of it more clearly.

Ultimately, the General Assembly did not freeze rates, and ComEd&#x27;s new rate plan went into effect on January 2, 2007. However, subsequent concerns about the impartiality of the reverse auction process have resulted in the establishment of the Illinois Power Agency, which will ultimately be responsible for producing and purchasing the energy for Illinois utilities.

As part of the compromise plan to avoid a rate freeze, ComEd devised a means by which a customer might defer payment of the 22% increase, subject to interest of over 3% on the unpaid portion of the increase.

In September 2011, ComEd named the first woman to the CEO post, Anne Pramaggiore. When she was promoted within Exelon, ComEd&#x27;s parent company, Joe Dominguez was named CEO and COO Terence Donnelly was named president while retaining the title COO.

===Corruption scandal===
On July 17, 2020, ComEd agreed to pay $200 million following what had been a several-year federal investigation of suspected illegal lobbying, political graft and sweetheart contract deals which were made in exchange for the company having a near-monopoly on regional power utility. On September 4, 2020, former ComEd Vice-President Fidel Marquez became the first ComEd executive to be criminally charged for his involvement in the scandal. 
====2023 ComEd Four convictions====

On May 2, 2023, ex-ComEd CEO Anne Pramaggiore, former ComEd lobbyist Mike McClain, retired ComEd executive John Hooker and ex-City Club of Chicago president and former ComEd consultant Jay Doherty were each found guilty on nine counts of bribery conspiracy, bribery and willfully falsifying the company’s books. These ComEd associates, who were nicknamed the &quot;ComEd Four&quot; were determined to have made efforts to corruptly influence former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan.

==Smart Grid==
In 2016, ComEd made an investment worth $2.6 billion in what is known as their &quot;Smart Grid.&quot; The plan will modernize the electric grid in Illinois by improving electric lines, installing smart meters and otherwise upgrading what the company says was badly outdated infrastructure. The intent of the Smart Grid plan is to make the Illinois electric grid stronger and more modern, and to eliminate the need for meter readers. Smart grid technology is similar to smartphone technology in that it uses wireless connectivity to update information about power consumption and other events. ComEd lobbyists wrote the law as mandatory Wireless Smart Meter installations to all customers of Illinois. It was passed by the Illinois General Assembly against vehement and persistent opposition from the Attorney General, AARP and informed Illinois citizens. ComEd spent around $16 million convincing General Assembly to over-ride Governor Quinn&#x27;s Veto. When elected, Governor Rauner signed another bill favoring ComEd over the rights of citizens to have a choice to opt out from installation of Wireless Smart Meter. ComEd and the other primary utility company in Illinois have together installed more than 3 million smart meters—digital devices that collect information about how much electricity is used—at customer homes and businesses. The meters send that information to ComEd through wireless technology. ComEd has said that the technology &quot;has avoided 7.6 million outages and generated $1.4 billion in societal savings.&quot;

The Smart Meter replacement project was awarded to Aclara Smart Grid Solutions, with the rollout starting in late 2016 in Chicago. The project was completed in 2019 in the western edge of the ComEd service territory.

On February 28, 2018, Illinois utility regulators authorized ComEd to establish a 10-year electric microgrid demonstration project on the South Side of Chicago. &quot;The Bronzeville Community Microgrid Project will connect with a microgrid at the Illinois Institute of Technology, creating one of the first utility-scale microgrid clusters in the nation, ComEd officials said,&quot; according to &quot;Daily Energy Insider&quot;.

It is also known by its ersatz French hook line, &quot;Inky Pinky Parlez Vous,&quot; or the American variant &quot;Hinky Dinky Parlez-vous&quot;&#x27; (variant: &quot;Parlay voo&quot;). &quot;Inky Pinky&quot; was a Scottish children&#x27;s name for parsnip and potato cakes, but it has been suggested that an onomatopoeic reference to the sound of bed springs is more likely a soldier&#x27;s ribald derivation.

==Origins==
&quot;Mademoiselle from Armentières&quot; has roots in a tradition of older popular songs. Its immediate predecessor seems to be the song &quot;Skiboo&quot;, or &quot;Snapoo&quot;, which was popular among British soldiers of World War I. The tune of the song is thought to have been popular in the French Army in the 1830s. The words told of the encounter of an innkeeper&#x27;s daughter, named Mademoiselle de Bar-le-Duc, with two German officers. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, the tune was resurrected, and again in 1914 when the British and Allied soldiers got to know it.

The &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; of December 4, 1939, reported that the historical inspiration for the song had been a young Frenchwoman named Marie Lecoq, later Marie Marceau, who worked as a waitress at the Café de la Paix in Armentières during the war. Despite the obscenity of many popular versions of the song, it was reportedly quite clean in its original form.

The song&#x27;s first known recording was made in 1915, by music hall baritone Jack Charman.
There are newspaper articles in Australia and New Zealand which indicate that the original words were composed by an Australian called Cecil Winter. https://natlib.govt.nz/records/22356112

The song Mademoiselle from Armentieres, as known in WW1 was penned by Cecil H. Winter in 1915 and 1916, during his time in England and France fighting with the kiwis. He was Australian, having been raised in the Riverina region of New South Wales. He was to take Riverina for his writings of Australian bush poetry culminating in the writing of a book of such poetry (&quot;The Story of Bidgee Queen &amp; Other Verses&quot;,Century Books. 1929). From a young age he wrote for the Australian Bulletin Magazine. He emigrated to New Zealand prior to WW1, living in Bluff, Southland. https://mudcat.org/detail_pf.cfm?messages__Message_ID=2050501

==Use==

&quot;Mademoiselle from Armentières&quot; was considered a risqué song and not for &#x27;polite company&#x27;. When sung on the radio and TV, as in &quot;The Waltons&quot;, typically only the first verse was sung. The lyrics on which this opinion is based are recorded in the Gordon &quot;Inferno&quot; Collection.

It is the third part of the regimental march of Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry. The first two are &quot;Has Anyone Seen the Colonel?&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to Tipperary&quot;.

&quot;Mademoiselle from Armentières&quot; was the name of a 1926 British film directed by Maurice Elvey and starring Estelle Brody.

&quot;Mademoiselle From Armentieres&quot; was the title of a 1927 espionage, thriller novel by Cecil Street, writing under the name &quot;John Rhode&quot;.

During World War II the comic duo Flanagan and Allen had a hit with &quot;If a Grey Haired Lady Says &#x27;How&#x27;s Your Father?&#x27; (That&#x27;s Mademoiselle from Armentieres)&quot;, written by Ted Waite, which refers to the original song.

When Lindisfarne played their song &quot;We Can Swing Together&quot; on stage in the early 1970s, it developed into a lengthy harmonica medley which included a verse and chorus from this as well as several other songs, some also traditional.

&quot;Three German Officers Crossed the Rhine&quot; is a song with a much more ribald set of lyrics, popular on rugby tours but sung to the same tune or to that of &quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot;. It was originally sung in the allied trenches during the First World War.

A reworked version known as the &quot;fart song&quot; or as &quot;an old lady of 92&quot; was popular in schools, particularly in the UK, with lyrics celebrating a flatulent journey including Bristol and Rome.

A reworked version of the melody was used in the Israeli songwriter Haim Hefer&#x27;s song &quot;בחולות&quot; (&quot;Bacholot&quot; or &quot;Bakholot&quot;, &quot;In the Sands&quot;), best known for its performance by the singer Yossi Banai. The song consist of six stanzas telling of a tendency among the narrator&#x27;s family males to take out the beloveds into, and conceive their children in, the titular sands.

In America, most recognize the melody with completely different lyrics, as the theme song for the character Clarabell the Clown on the children&#x27;s TV series &quot;Howdy Doody&quot;.

==Lyrics==
Multiple versions of the song exist. One variation goes as follows:

&lt;poem&gt;Mademoiselle from Armentieres, Parley-voo?
Mademoiselle from Armentieres, Parley-voo?
Mademoiselle from Armentieres,
She hasn&#x27;t been kissed in forty years,
Hinky, dinky, parley-voo.

Mademoiselle from Armentieres, Parley-voo?
Mademoiselle from Armentieres, Parley-voo?
She had the form like the back of a hack,
When she cried the tears ran down her back,
Hinky, dinky, parley-voo.

Mademoiselle from Armentieres, Parley-voo?
Mademoiselle from Armentieres, Parley-voo?
She never could hold the love of man
&#x27;Cause she took her baths in a talcum can,
Hinky, dinky, parley-voo.

Mademoiselle from Armentieres, Parley-voo?
Mademoiselle from Armentieres, Parley-voo?
She had four chins, her knees would knock,
And her face would stop a cuckoo clock,
Hinky, dinky, parley-voo.

Mademoiselle from Armentieres, Parley-voo?
Mademoiselle from Armentieres, Parley-voo?
She could beg a franc, a drink, a meal,
But it wasn&#x27;t because of sex appeal,
Hinky, dinky, parley-voo.

Mademoiselle from Armentieres, Parley-voo?
Mademoiselle from Armentieres, Parley-voo?
She could guzzle a barrel of sour wine,
And eat a hog without peeling the rind,
Hinky, dinky, parley-voo.

The MPs think they won the war, Parley-voo.
The MPs think they won the war, Parley-voo.
The MPs think they won the war,
Standing guard at the café door,
Hinky, dinky, parley-voo.

The officers get the pie and cake, Parley-voo.
The officers get the pie and cake, Parley-voo.
The officers get the pie and cake,
And all we get is the bellyache,
Hinky, dinky, parley-voo.

Mademoiselle from Armentieres, Parley-voo?
Mademoiselle from Armentieres, Parley-voo?
They say they mechanized the war
So what the hell are we marching for?
Hinky-dinky, parley-voo.

The sergeant ought to take a bath, Parley-voo.
The sergeant ought to take a bath, Parley-voo.
If he changes his underwear
The frogs will give him the Croix-de-Guerre,
Hinky-dinky, parley-voo.

You might forget the gas and shells, Parley-voo.
You might forget the gas and shells, Parley-voo.
You might forget the groans and yells
But you&#x27;ll never forget the mademoiselles,
Hinky, dinky, parley-voo.

Mademoiselle from Armentieres, Parley-voo?
Mademoiselle from Armentieres, Parley-voo?
Many and many a married man
Wants to go back to France again
Hinky, dinky, parley-voo.

Mademoiselle from Armentieres, Parley-voo?
Mademoiselle from Armentieres, Parley-voo?
Just blow your nose, and dry your tears,
We&#x27;ll all be back in a few short years,
Hinky, dinky, parley-voo.
&lt;/poem&gt;

== Lyricists ==
There are several claims to having written the lyrics for this song:
* Edward Rowland and a Canadian composer, Gitz Rice
* Harry Carlton and Joe Tunbridge
* British songwriter Harry Wincott
* Alfred Charles Montin supposedly wrote &quot;Mademoiselle from Armentières&quot; while stationed in France. He composed the music for &quot;The Caissons Go Rolling Along&quot; at Fort Sheridan, Ill., shortly before his unit was transferred to Fort Sill. The lyrics for the artillery march were written by Brig. Gen. Edmund L. Gruber, when he was a second lieutenant. Montin was born and raised in Nice, France. He migrated to the United States and started a tour of duty as an army band director in the days when the band was an important regimental organization. Also included in his music career was a tour with the famed John Philip Sousa Band.&quot;

<doc id="1030528" wikidata="Q7103028" url="?curid=1030528" title="Orlando (fictional cat)">
<text>Orlando (The Marmalade Cat) is the fictional eponymous hero of the series (of the same name) of 19 illustrated children&#x27;s books written by Kathleen Hale between 1938 and 1972, issued by various publishers including &quot;Country Life&quot; and &quot;Puffin Picture Books&quot;. The series involves a marmalade cat (most likely a ginger tabby) named Orlando, and his adventures with his family and wife named Grace.

==Background==

The &quot;Orlando (The Marmalade Cat)&quot; books were created by Kathleen Hale for her two children, and Orlando was inspired by their real-life cat Orlando. When &quot;Country Life&quot; first published &quot;Orlando (the Marmalade Cat): A Camping Holiday&quot;, it became an instant success. Kathleen Hale then continued the series, giving Orlando a magic carpet in 1958, and ended the series with &quot;Orlando and the Water Cats&quot; (1972).

==Plot==

Orlando&#x27;s family consist of his wife Grace, and three kittens: Blanche (white), Pansy (tortoiseshell) and Tinkle (black). The family, especially Orlando, get involved in many adventures together and make friends as they do so. They can range from going to the Moon (&quot;Orlando Goes to the Moon&quot;), becoming a replacement judge (&quot;Orlando the Judge&quot;) or to keeping a large black poodle dog (&quot;Orlando (the Marmalade Cat): Keeps a Dog&quot;).

==Characters==
There are many characters in the Orlando series, many of them minor. Some of the minor characters reappear in different books in the series (for example Mr. Cattermole), while others appear once.

===Major characters===

*Blanche - Blanche is one of the 3 kittens, and is pure white.
*Grace - The wife of Orlando, she and the kittens almost always accompany Orlando. She often wears large hats and skirts, and once wore a wedding-dress made of fish on their (Orlando&#x27;s and Grace&#x27;s) wedding day, and in &quot;Orlando&#x27;s Home Life&quot; wore a fur coat in the pattern of a leopard&#x27;s fur. She is a tabby cat, with a small, stubby nose like a ripe apricot.
*Orlando - The hero of the series, he is a marmalade-coloured cat with eyes like two green gooseberries. He sometimes keeps his watch on his tail, and later on in the series he is friends with a living magic carpet named Fatima.
*Pansy - Pansy is one of Orlando&#x27;s and Grace&#x27;s 3 kittens, and she is a tortoiseshell.
*Tinkle - The most mischievous of the kittens, he is a black cat and owns a pet spider. He was responsible for creating the events in &quot;Orlando and the Three Graces&quot;, and is friends with Cupid the brown foal.
*Vulcan - Vulcan is a horse who, along with his wife Venus, first appeared in &quot;Orlando (the Marmalade Cat): Buys a Farm&quot;. He is the creature who made the events in &quot;Orlando (the Marmalade Cat): A Seaside Holiday&quot; possible, as he had found a place to stay in Owlbarrow. Vulcan returned in &quot;Orlando Goes to the Moon&quot;, pulling Orlando&#x27;s moon rocket with Cupid and his wife Venus.

===Minor characters===

*Cattermole - Mr. Cattermole owns a shop for cats that opens after midnight. In &quot;Orlando&#x27;s Home Life&quot;, when Orlando and Grace needed money to send the kittens to school, they made several inventions and gave them to Cattermole. A glimpse of his face can be seen in &quot;Orlando (the Marmalade Cat): A Seaside Holiday&quot;, and he gives Orlando his Moon rocket, space suits and a present for the Man in the Moon in &quot;Orlando Goes to the Moon&quot;.
*Cupid - Cupid is the foal of Vulcan and his wife Venus, and appeared in &quot;Orlando (the Marmalade Cat): A Seaside Holiday&quot;. In the book, he eats a cauliflower, some flowers and a hat. He reappeared in &quot;Orlando Goes to the Moon&quot;, pulling Orlando&#x27;s Moon rocket with Venus and Vulcan.
*Fluffy - Judge Wiggins&#x27; pet cat, he is the villain in &quot;Orlando the Judge&quot; for stealing Mr. Gorgon&#x27;s cheese for his mousetraps. He eventually became a guardian for the Old Mice&#x27;s Home as punishment.
*Wiggins - Wiggins is a judge who owns Fluffy the cat. He appears in &quot;Orlando the Judge&quot;, with a cold.
*Mr Gorgon and Mr Zola - Two men who look very alike, they both love cheese.

==Books==

Books in the series are:

*&quot;Orlando (the Marmalade Cat): A Camping Holiday&quot; (1938)
*&quot;Orlando (the Marmalade Cat): A Trip Abroad&quot; (1939)
*&quot;Orlando&#x27;s Evening Out&quot; (1941)
*&quot;Orlando (the Marmalade Cat) Buys a Farm&quot; (1942)
*&quot;Orlando&#x27;s Home Life&quot; (1942) - In this book, Orlando tells his wife Grace that the kittens should be sent to learn something as soon as possible, or &quot;nobody will want them&quot;. Unfortunately, Orlando and Grace do not have enough money to send them to school, so they give Mr. Cattermole (the owner of a shop especially for cats, which only opens at night) three inventions - cream to stop making cats wet, a &quot;Puss Protector&quot; which makes cars jump over jay-walking cats, and Grace&#x27;s fluffy blankets for invalid cats. Because their inventions becomes a success, they earn enough money from Mr. Cattermole and are then able to send the kittens to school. However, they hated it with a passion, and &quot;did all they could to be expelled&quot;. Pansy was first to be expelled (by presenting half her face to the headmistress), then Blanche (who pretended to faint) and finally Tinkle. Orlando and Grace then decide to get private tutors to educate their kittens in different subjects, and eventually Pansy learns to be an actress, Blanche to be a dancer, and Tinkle a master of the arts (sculpture, painting, music, literature). However, Orlando finds Grace crying into the kitchen sink while washing the dishes, and because she feels old without her kittens, Orlando dismisses all of the teachers (to the kittens&#x27; delight, especially Tinkle&#x27;s as he was painting himself and carving the harp Orlando gave him) and took Grace out, while the kittens secretly write a surprise play for her and Orlando. Orlando takes Grace to a fishmonger&#x27;s, a luxury clothes shop (and orders a fur coat for Grace which arrives the next day) and to visit Mr. Cattermole, who gives them microphones as a mark of his gratitude. The next day, when Grace&#x27;s coat arrives, Orlando&#x27;s family prepare to go to the cat-show, and as Grace adores a pair of Siamese cats, the kittens add this to their surprise play. That night, the kittens perform their play and have 5 acts - the Scarf Dance by Blanche (music by Tinkle), the Hairy Heart, the Whiskered Meringue, a pair of &quot;Siamese&quot; kittens (Blanche partly covered in soot and Tinkle partly covered in flour), and finally a Fan Dance performed by Pansy. Afterwards, Orlando and Grace sing on the rooftops with their microphones, and finally went to bed and &quot;dreamt of Sardines&quot;.
*&quot;Orlando (the Marmalade Cat): His Silver Wedding&quot; (1944) - Also known as &quot;Orlando&#x27;s Silver Wedding&quot;, this book tells the story of Orlando and Grace&#x27;s marriage.
*&quot;Orlando (the Marmalade Cat): Becomes a Doctor&quot; (1944)
*&quot;Orlando&#x27;s Invisible Pyjamas&quot; (1947) - Orlando accidentally loses the fur from his lower part, and hides in the garden so he will not be seen. Grace cleverly knits him a pyjama bottom that looks just like his fur to hide the bareness. After a time he needs to take it off, and finds another layer underneath, which he thinks Grace has made, but it is actually his own fur which has grown back after all. 
*&quot;Orlando (the Marmalade Cat): Keeps a Dog&quot; (1949)
*&quot;Orlando the Judge&quot; (1950) - When Mr. Gorgon suspects Mr. Zola of stealing his cheese, Orlando is in despair that his two friends are arguing. He is then called to Judge Wiggins, who has a cold and is not getting better as his arrogant pet cat named Fluffy takes everything he needs to eat. Orlando eventually takes his place while Grace boils Wiggins some milk, and the kittens investigate the mystery of the missing cheese. At the end of the book, it is revealed that Fluffy stole the cheese for his mouse-trap (for he is frightened of mice), and he eventually becomes a guard for the Old Mice&#x27;s Home as punishment. Mr. Gorgon and Mr. Zola become friends again, and Wiggins&#x27; cold begins to get better.
*&quot;Orlando (the Marmalade Cat): A Seaside Holiday&quot; (1952) - In &quot;A Seaside Holiday&quot;, they stay in the town of &#x27;Owlbarrow&#x27;, a thinly disguised version of Aldeburgh on the coast of Suffolk: many of the illustrations feature landmarks in the town. One hot summer&#x27;s day, Orlando is disappointed that he and his family cannot go on holiday, until unexpectedly their friend Vulcan the Horse visits their house to say that himself (Vulcan), his wife Venus and their foal Cupid are going to go on holiday with Orlando, in a docked boat over in Owlbarrow. There, they meet a lady named Salubrious (Sally for short) and a dachshund named Daisy. They spend the rest of their stay there flying a kite, discovering a &quot;mermaid&quot;, rescuing people (including a queen named Catalpa) from a shipwreck and cheering up the grumpy Mr. Curmudgeon. The book ends with Catalpa living with the now-jolly Curmudgeon, the rescued people gaining a new ship which looks like Orlando (as well as having Sally as their new queen) and both Orlando and Vulcan&#x27;s family going back home. Along with the reprint of &quot;Orlando (the Marmalade Cat): A Camping Holiday&quot; by Puffin, this is the book that is the most easiest to buy, and is published by the Penguin Group as a reprint.
*&quot;Orlando&#x27;s Zoo&quot; (1954)
*&quot;Orlando (the Marmalade Cat): The Frisky Housewife&quot; (1956)
*&quot;Orlando&#x27;s Magic Carpet&quot; (1958)
*&quot;Orlando&#x27;s Country Peepshow&quot; (1959) - this was a &quot;novelty&quot; or &quot;gimmick&quot; book. It consisted of four sections that were joined, and opened to the shape of a merry-go-round, or carousel. Each section contained a cut-out scene with layers like a theatre stage&#x27;s &quot;flats&quot;, or like decoupage. Each section showed a theatre scene, or tableau, of one of the four seasons of Orlando&#x27;s farm, with the scenes showing spring planting, summer growing, autumn harvesting, and winter relaxing at Christmas. 
*&quot;Orlando, the Marmalade Cat, Buys a Cottage&quot; (1963)
*&quot;Orlando and the Three Graces&quot; (1965) - At Christmas, Tinkle receives a magic kit, which contains two sprays. As he wants to give his parents a present, he gives Orlando a box, Pansy and Blanche his pet spider and gives Grace one of the sprays from his magic kit. To do this, he scratches out the word on one of the sprays and replaces it with &quot;TINKLE&quot;. When Grace sprays it on herself, however, two other Graces appear, and do exactly the same things that she does. When Orlando sees her, he hisses and refuses to believe her as he knows he has only one wife. Grace spends the rest of the day crying and the kittens hide in fear. They all eventually go to see Father Christmas for help, and on their way they meet the Dog Star, who gives the cats warm haddock milk except for Tinkle (because he insulted him as soon as they met). As soon as they find Father Christmas, he undoes the spell on Grace, and tells Tinkle that he should have read the label. They go back home safely, and have a wonderful Christmas.
*&quot;Orlando Goes to the Moon&quot; (1968)
*&quot;Orlando and the Water Cats&quot; (1972)

==Legacy==

In 1994, a stamp featuring Orlando the Marmalade Cat was released. A one-penny stamp, it shows Orlando writing what is possibly a letter with a quill. The foreground shows green wallpaper.

<text>De Humani Corporis Fabrica Libri Septem (Latin, &quot;On the Fabric of the Human Body in Seven Books&quot;) is a set of books on human anatomy written by Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564) and published in 1543. It was a major advance in the history of anatomy over the long-dominant work of Galen, and presented itself as such.

The collection of books is based on his Paduan lectures, during which he deviated from common practice by dissecting a corpse to illustrate what he was discussing. Dissections had previously been performed by a barber surgeon under the direction of a doctor of medicine, who was not expected to perform manual labour. Vesalius&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot; presents a careful examination of the organs and the complete structure of the human body. This would not have been possible without the many advances that had been made during the Renaissance, including artistic developments in literal visual representation and the technical development of printing with refined woodcuts. Because of these developments and his careful, immediate involvement, Vesalius was able to produce illustrations superior to any produced previously.

==Books of the collection==
Vesalius arranged his work into seven books.

===Book 1: The Bones and Cartilages===
The first book constitutes about a quarter of the entire collection. It presents Vesalius&#x27; observations on human bones and cartilage, which he collected from cemeteries. It covers the physical appearance of human bones and the differentiation of human bones and cartilage by function. In each chapter Vesalius describes the bones in great detail, explaining their physical qualities in different ways. In the opening chapters, Vesalius &quot;gives general aspects of bones and skeletal organisation, dealing with the differences in texture, strength, and resilience between bone and cartilage; explaining the complex differences between types of joints and reviewing some basic elements of descriptive techniques and terminology.&quot; A major theme of this book is whether Galen described the bones of the human skeleton accurately. When Vesalius lectured on the human skeleton, he also presented the bones of animals to give credibility to Galen&#x27;s observations.
===Book 2: The Ligaments and Muscles===
Here Vesalius describes the structure of the muscles, the agents used in creating movement by the body, and the material used to hold the joints together. Through his observations of butchers cutting meat, he was able to incorporate the skills they used in the dissection of the human body. The order in which to dissect a human body to effectively observe each muscle in the body is laid out. Each illustration displays a deepening view of the human body which can be followed while dissecting a human body. Vesalius also mentions the instruments needed to perform a dissection. Here Vesalius begins to describe how Galen&#x27;s anatomical descriptions do not match his own observations. In order to show respect to Galen, he suggests Galen&#x27;s use of anatomical structure is in fact correct, but not for humans. He even continues to describe some of the structures in the way Galen would.

===Book 3: The Veins and Arteries, Book 4: The Nerves===
In Books 3 and 4, Vesalius describes the veins, arteries, and nerves as vessels, but notes their differing physical structure: veins and arteries contains a hollow channel, but nerves do not. Vesalius describes the route by which air travels through the lungs and the heart. He describes this process as &quot;a tree whose trunks divide into branches and twigs&quot;. He also describes how the body contains four veins (the portal vein, the venae cavae, the artery-like vein [now understood as the Pulmonary Vein], and the umbilical vein) and two arteries (the aorta, and the vein-like artery [now understood as the Pulmonary Artery]) as being the main vessels which branch out into smaller veins and arteries. Vesalius lists some six hundred vessels in his tabulation of arteries, veins and nerves, but fails to mention the smaller vessels located in the hands and feet, the terminal vessels of the cutaneous nerves, or the vessels in the lungs and liver.

===Book 5: The Organs of Nutrition and Generation===
Vesalius gives detailed descriptions of the organs of nutrition, the urinary system, and the male and female reproductive systems. The alimentary and reproductive systems each make up about forty percent of this book, and the description of the renal system and the correct technique for dissecting it makes up the remainder. In the final chapter, the longest chapter of the entire collection, Vesalius gives detailed step-by-step instructions on how to dissect the abdominopelvic organs. In the first half of the book, Vesalius describes the peritoneum, the esophagus, the stomach, the omentum, the intestines and the mesentery. He then goes on to describe the liver, gallbladder, and the spleen. Finally, he describes the kidneys, the bladder, and the ureters. Vesalius was unfamiliar with the anatomy of pregnancy, which lead him to erroneously provide illustrations of a zonary (band-shaped) placenta and fetal membrane in the 1543 edition of &quot;De Fabrica&quot;; Vesalius does so relying on Galenic medicine which used canine reproductive organs rather than human female reproductive organs. The illustrations are corrected in the 1555 edition. The new images depict a discoid placenta and fetal membrane.

===Book 6: The Heart and Associated Organs, Book 7: The Brain===
These books describe the structure and functions of the heart and the organs of respiration, the brain and its coverings, the eye, the organs of sensation, and the nerves of the limbs. A chapter is also devoted to the dissection of the eye. Vesalius describes the organs of the body in great detail by commenting &quot;on the variable strength of the attachment of the pleura to the thoracic walls, the strong attachment of the pericardium to the diaphragm, the shape and orientation of the ventricles of the heart, and the description of the semilunar valves.&quot; He closes each book with a chapter on the correct way to dissect the heart and the brain respectively.

==Galen&#x27;s errors==
Galen, the prominent Greek physician, surgeon and philosopher in the Roman empire, had written on anatomy among other topics, but his work remained largely unchecked until the time of Vesalius. The &quot;Fabrica&quot; rectified some of Galen&#x27;s worst errors, including the notion that the great blood vessels originated from the liver. Other errors rectified included the idea that the human mandible was in two parts (it is, in fact, in one part) and that men had fewer ribs than women. Disproving this decreased Vesalius&#x27; popularity with the Church as it contradicted the Biblical understanding of Adam and Eve. While examining a human corpse, Vesalius discovered that Galen&#x27;s observations were inconsistent with his, due to Galen&#x27;s use of animal (dog and monkey) cadavers. Overall, Vesalius&#x27;s use of human corpses allowed him to rectify approximately 300 of Galen&#x27;s errors. Even with his improvements, however, Vesalius clung to some of Galen&#x27;s errors, such as the idea that veins and arteries carried different respective types of blood. It was not until William Harvey&#x27;s work on the circulation of the blood (&quot;De Motu Cordis&quot;, 1628) that this misconception of Galen&#x27;s would be rectified in Europe.
==Publication==

===1543 edition===
Vesalius had the work published at the age of 28, taking great pains to ensure its quality, and dedicated it to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. The more than 250 illustrations are of great artistic merit and are generally attributed by modern scholars to the &quot;studio of Titian&quot; rather than Johannes Stephanus of Calcar, who provided drawings for Vesalius&#x27; earlier tracts. The woodcuts were greatly superior to the illustrations in anatomical atlases of the day, which were never made by anatomy professors themselves. The woodcut blocks were transported to Basel, Switzerland, as Vesalius wished that the work be published by one of the foremost printers of the time, Johannes Oporinus. Vesalius&#x27; written directions to Oporinus (the &quot;iter&quot;) were so valuable the printer decided to include them. The illustrations were engraved on wooden blocks, which allowed for very fine detail.

===1555 edition===

A second edition was published in 1555. Annotations in a copy of that edition preserved in KU Leuven Libraries have been identified as Vesalius&#x27;s own, showing that he was contemplating a third edition, never achieved.

==Reception==
The success of &quot;Fabrica&quot; recouped the work&#x27;s considerable expense, and brought Vesalius European fame, partly through cheap unauthorized copies. He was appointed physician to the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V; Vesalius presented him with the first published copy (bound in silk of imperial purple, with specially hand-painted illustrations not found in any other copy). To accompany the &quot;Fabrica&quot;, Vesalius published a condensed and less expensive &quot;Epitome&quot;: at the time of publication in 1543, it cost 10 batzen. As a result, the &quot;Epitome&quot; became more widely seen than the &quot;Fabrica&quot;; it contained eight anatomical engravings that condensed visual material from the &quot;Fabrica&quot;, one illustration of the human skeleton taken directly from the &quot;Fabrica&quot;, and two new woodcut plates.

== Human remains ==
During the 16th century, the dissection of human bodies was highly prohibited by the Church. Therefore, in order to combat this opposition, Vesalius had to secretly take the bodies of executed criminals, a process which he explains in &quot;De Humani Corporis Fabrica&quot;. This process of stealing the dead bodies of criminals was a key way for anatomists and artists to study the human body. For example in 1828 the case of Burke and Hare, whereby the bodies were delivered to anatomists for dissection, were murdered specifically for financial gain.

==Surviving copies==
More than 700 copies survive from the 1543 and 1555 editions. Of those, by 2018 some 29 copies were in London, 20 in Paris, 14 in Boston, 13 in New York, 12 in Cambridge (England), and 11 each in Oxford and Rome. John Hay Library at Brown University owns a copy bound in tanned human skin.

Some of the images, even though separated by several pages in the text, make a continuous landscape panorama in the background when placed side-by-side.

In February 2024, a second-edition copy was sold at a Christie&#x27;s online auction for $2,228,000, making it one of the most expensive scientific documents ever to be sold at auction. The copy, which had last been sold in 2007 for €13,200, was found to have been Vesalius&#x27; personal copy. Extensive handwritten annotations in the margins were determined to have been written by Vesalius himself.

==Legacy==
&quot;De Humani Corporis Fabrica&quot;, a 2022 documentary film about the human body by Lucien Castaing-Taylor and Véréna Paravel, was named after the book series.

<text>A physical data model (or [[database design]]) is a representation of a data design as implemented, or intended to be implemented, in a database management system. In the lifecycle of a project it typically derives from a logical data model, though it may be reverse-engineered from a given database implementation. A complete physical data model will include all the database artifacts required to create relationships between tables or to achieve performance goals, such as indexes, constraint definitions, linking tables, partitioned tables or clusters. Analysts can usually use a physical data model to calculate storage estimates; it may include specific storage allocation details for a given database system.

 seven main databases dominate the commercial marketplace: Informix, Oracle, Postgres, SQL Server, Sybase, IBM Db2 and MySQL. Other RDBMS systems tend either to be legacy databases or used within academia such as universities or further education colleges. Physical data models for each implementation would differ significantly, not least due to underlying operating-system requirements that may sit underneath them. For example: SQL Server runs only on Microsoft Windows operating-systems (Starting with SQL Server 2017, SQL Server runs on Linux. It&#x27;s the same SQL Server database engine, with many similar features and services regardless of your operating system), while Oracle and MySQL can run on Solaris, Linux and other UNIX-based operating-systems as well as on Windows. This means that the disk requirements, security requirements and many other aspects of a physical data model will be influenced by the RDBMS that a database administrator (or an organization) chooses to use.

==Physical schema==

&quot;Physical schema&quot; is a term used in data management to describe how data is to be represented and stored (files, indices, &quot;et al.&quot;) in secondary storage using a particular database management system (DBMS) (e.g., Oracle RDBMS, Sybase SQL Server, etc.).

In the ANSI/SPARC Architecture three schema approach, the &quot;internal schema&quot; is the view of data that involved data management technology. This is as opposed to an &quot;external schema&quot; that reflects an individual&#x27;s view of the data, or the &quot;conceptual schema&quot; that is the integration of a set of external schemas.

Subsequently the internal schema was recognized to have two parts:

The logical schema was the way data were represented to conform to the constraints of a particular approach to database management. At that time the choices were hierarchical and network. Describing the logical schema, however, still did not describe how physically data would be stored on disk drives. That is the domain of the &quot;physical schema&quot;. Now logical schemas describe data in terms of relational &quot;tables and columns&quot;, object-oriented &quot;classes&quot;, and XML &quot;tags&quot;.

A single set of tables, for example, can be implemented in numerous ways, up to and including an architecture where table rows are maintained on computers in different countries.

<text>Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe (ABWH) were an English progressive rock band active from 1988 to 1990 that comprised four past members of the English progressive rock band Yes. Singer Jon Anderson left Yes as he felt increasingly constrained by their commercial and pop-oriented direction in the 1980s. He began an album with other members from the band&#x27;s 1970s era: guitarist Steve Howe, keyboardist Rick Wakeman, and drummer Bill Bruford, plus bassist Tony Levin (Bruford&#x27;s bandmate in King Crimson).

The group released their only studio album, &quot;Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe&quot;, in June 1989 which reached number 14 in the UK and number 30 in the US. Their 1989–90 world tour was well-received and spawned two live albums, &quot;An Evening of Yes Music Plus&quot; (1993) and &quot;Live at the NEC – Oct 24th 1989&quot; (2012).

The thirteenth Yes album, &quot;Union&quot; (1991), featured tracks recorded in 1990 and originally intended for a second ABWH studio album, alongside songs recorded by Yes around the same time and a solo track by Howe. This marked the end of Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe and the start of the eight-member Yes formation which lasted until 1992, comprising Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman, Howe, Chris Squire, Trevor Rabin, Tony Kaye, and Alan White.

==History==
===Background and formation===
In 1983, singer Jon Anderson returned to Yes to record lead vocals on their 1983 studio album &quot;90125&quot;, which saw Yes adopt a musical direction that was more commercial and pop-oriented. The line-up during this time included bassist Chris Squire, drummer Alan White, keyboardist Tony Kaye, and guitarist Trevor Rabin, who wrote the majority of &quot;90125&quot;. The release of &quot;90125&quot; saw Yes reach their greatest commercial success. It was followed by their 1987 album &quot;Big Generator&quot;, also a significant commercial success.

In September 1988, Anderson left Yes citing his growing dissatisfaction with the band&#x27;s commercial direction. He had also felt sidelined from the creative process due to the machinations of other band members and producer Trevor Horn. Anderson spent his summer on the Greek island of Hydra writing songs with Vangelis, where he first came up with the idea of making music with other members of the 1971–72 Yes line-up of guitarist Steve Howe, keyboardist Rick Wakeman, and drummer Bill Bruford. The only missing member from that line-up was Chris Squire, who remained in the then-current version of Yes.

=== Studio album ===

On his return trip from Hydra, Anderson met Howe in London who presented him with his musical ideas including the chorus of &quot;Brother of Mine&quot; and &quot;Birthright&quot;. Five weeks were spent producing demo tracks at La Frette Studios in Paris. Anderson asked musician Milton McDonald to help with the project and play additional guitars. Bruford recalled meeting Anderson, Howe, Wakeman, and former Yes manager Brian Lane, at the airport in London. He said, &quot;Oh, we&#x27;re in trouble here. This obviously meant it was some sort of Yes project ... I thought I was just going to put some drums on a Jon Anderson solo record&quot;.

Recording moved to AIR Studios on the island of Montserrat for six weeks. Bruford saw the recording location as &quot;a deal clincher&quot;. It was there when Bruford suggested to have his King Crimson bandmate Tony Levin play bass on the album. Bruford noticed Anderson being &quot;on strong form ... he conducted proceedings without fear of let or hindrance&quot; from the problematic times recording with Yes. When recording was complete, Anderson supervised the album&#x27;s mixing sessions at Bearsville Studios with mixing engineers Steve Thompson and Michael Barbiero.

&quot;Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe&quot; was released on 20 June 1989 through Arista Records, using catalog number AL85-&quot;90126&quot;. The album peaked at number 14 in the UK and number 30 in the US. It went on to reach the top 30 in Canada, Switzerland, Germany, France, Norway, and Sweden. The album sold 750,000 copies.

=== Lawsuit and tour ===
On 31 May 1989, weeks before the release of their album and tour, the group were subject to a suit filed by Yes that wished to prevent Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe from mentioning the name &quot;Yes&quot; in their promotional material, suggesting or calling attention to Yes music, which they argued may cause &quot;confusion in the minds of the public over which group is the real Yes&quot;, and prohibiting Anderson from speaking of his former membership in Yes. The suit was based on a separation agreement entered into by each past and present member of Yes in May 1984 that specified who was entitled to use the Yes name; any &quot;withdrawing partner&quot; from the group could no longer use the name or mention they were in the band before, after a specified date. Yes argued that Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe had &quot;wrongfully converted&quot; the Yes name in an advertisement for &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that promoted their upcoming concert as &quot;an evening of Yes music plus&quot;. Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe filed a response on 5 June; their attorneys called Yes&#x27;s suit &quot;an outrageous attempt ... to stop the media and public from comparing ABWH&#x27;s new recording with theirs&quot;. According to former Yes tour co-ordinator Jim Halley, &quot;the European promoters began splashing the name Yes all over the posters ... in the end they came to an accommodation&quot;. Anderson stressed, &quot;&quot;we&quot; never said we were Yes. It was the record company.&quot; In June 1989, a U.S District Court judge ruled that ABWH could refer to its Yes heritage and material in promoting their tour.

ABWH named the tour An Evening of Yes Music, Plus. Rehearsals took place at Nomis Studios in London.

=== Cancelled second album, merger with Yes and &quot;Union&quot; ===
ABWH and Yes produced a Yes album titled &quot;Union&quot;. The album includes recordings originally intended for separate albums by both groups. Several songs originally intended for the second ABWH album, tentatively titled &quot;Dialogue&quot;, surfaced on the 1990s bootleg &quot;We Make Believe&quot; and the underground &quot;Yesoteric&quot; bootleg compilation. This material included demos by Anderson but without the other three that were subsequently released as part of Jon Anderson&#x27;s &quot;The Lost Tapes&quot; box set series as &quot;Watching the Flags That Fly&quot;.

Songs from the &quot;ABWH&quot; album have been included on subsequent Yes compilations and Yes concerts.

<doc id="1030550" wikidata="Q7765946" url="?curid=1030550" title="The Spirit of St. Louis (book)">
<text>The Spirit of St. Louis is an autobiographical account by Charles Lindbergh about the events leading up to and including his 1927 solo trans-Atlantic flight in the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;, a custom-built, single engine, single-seat monoplane (Registration: N-X-211). The book was published on September 14, 1953, and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1954.

==Summary==
The book covers a period of time between September 1926 and May 1927, and is divided into two sections: &quot;The Craft&quot; and &quot;New York to Paris&quot;. In the first section, &quot;The Craft&quot; (pp. 3–178), Lindbergh describes the latter days of his career as an airmail pilot and presents his account of conceiving, planning, and executing the building of the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; aircraft. He describes the many challenges he faced, including getting financial backing, constructing an aircraft that could carry the necessary fuel and still fly, and completing the project within several months—other pilots were racing to achieve the first solo trans-Atlantic flight and win the $25,000 Orteig Prize.

In the second section, &quot;New York to Paris&quot; (pp. 181–492), Lindbergh gives a detailed hour-by-hour account of his 33-hour solo flight above the Atlantic and northern Europe that began in the early morning hours of May 21, 1927. He describes the numerous challenges presented by navigation, storms, fuel calculation, boredom, and lack of sleep during the course of the flight that would take him over 3,600 miles from Roosevelt Field in Long Island, New York to Le Bourget field in Paris. Throughout the narrative, Lindbergh interjects flashback memories of his childhood in Little Falls, Minnesota, his college years, his early years as an aviator barnstorming across the countryside, his aviation mentors and friends who flew the mail routes with him, and his family—especially his father, who was not only a congressman, but a respected and sage companion to his young son.

As Lindbergh flies through the long, solitary night toward Europe, forcing his sleep-obsessed mind to check and re-check his course, he recalls the night he was flying the mail from St. Louis to Chicago when he first thought of flying across the Atlantic Ocean. Lindbergh believed he could make that flight, and he remembers his nine St. Louis friends who helped him purchase the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; and realize his dream. Lindbergh describes the thrill of spotting the first fishing boats off the coast of Ireland, and then crossing the coast of France, and then following the Seine River all the way to Paris and Le Bourget field.

In addition to an Afterword (pp. 495–501), Lindbergh included an extensive Appendix (pp. 503–562) containing his flight log, a flight map, his journal account of his return to the United States aboard the cruiser USS &quot;Memphis&quot;, an article about the decorations, awards, and trophies he received, engineering data and engine specifications, 16 pages of photographs, various illustrations, and a glossary.

==Background information==

&quot;The Spirit of St. Louis&quot; was the third book length account Lindbergh wrote of his solo trans-Atlantic flight. The first was called &quot;WE&quot; which was published by G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons in July, 1927 less than two months after the flight. He wrote a more expansive account in a book titled &quot;Of Flight and Life&quot;, which covered his entire aviation history. Lindbergh was pleased with the way Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons handled the publication of the latter, and he chose them to publish &quot;The Spirit of St. Louis&quot;. He asked for and received a $25,000 advance and 15 percent royalty from the first copy sold. He arranged for all proceeds to go directly into a trust for his children.

Lindbergh&#x27;s editor, John Hall Wheelock, responded enthusiastically to the first manuscripts he read, writing to Lindbergh how impressed he was &quot;not only by the way you have unfolded your story, but by the extraordinary beauty of the descriptions of sea and air.&quot; When Lindbergh asked Wheelock for more severe criticism, the editor responded with several suggestions that trimmed the book by about 70 pages—mainly flashbacks to his early life, which the editor felt distracted from the main narrative.

Lindbergh hired a literary agent, George T. Bye, who negotiated a serialization deal and motion-picture rights for $100,000 from &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;. Ten installments appeared in that periodical under the title, &quot;33 Hours to Paris&quot;. These installments generated the largest sales in the magazine&#x27;s history. The Book of the Month Club selected &quot;The Spirit of St. Louis&quot; as the main selection in September 1953.

According to the author&#x27;s Preface (pp. ix–xii), Lindbergh worked on the manuscript of &quot;The Spirit of St. Louis&quot; for 14 years. Work began in 1938, 11 years after the last event described in the book, so Lindbergh needed to rely on memory for his early drafts; few detailed records were available to him. The author cites his belief in the future of aviation as his primary motive for the flight, and tried to capture that in his book.

Prior to the publication of &quot;The Spirit of St. Louis&quot; on September 14, 1953, Lindbergh presented an advance copy in August 1953 to Carl B. Allen, who had read the manuscript and provided criticism and suggestions (he is included in the Acknowledgements). Accompanying the inscribed book was a two-page typewritten letter signed by Lindbergh that provides information about some of the challenges the author faced in the writing of the book.

In the months leading up to its publication, Lindbergh and his wife Anne labored over the galley proofs, leaving no detail unnoticed. Charles Scribner would later recall, &quot;He would measure the difference between a semicolon and a colon to make sure each as what it ought to be. To him, every detail in the book has as much significance as if it were a moving part in the airplane.&quot;

Just prior to publication, Lindbergh dedicated the book to his wife, &quot;To A.M.L. Who will never realize how much of this book she has written&quot;. A dark blue dustjacket was prepared by George W. Thompson of a night sky filled with stars. The book&#x27;s endpapers were reproduced from an original aquatint by Burnell Poole titled, &quot;The Epic of the Air&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;The Spirit of St. Louis&quot; was an overwhelming bestseller and generated near universal praise and favorable reviews. The Book of the Month Club alone sold over 100,000 copies in the first year, with several hundred thousand additional copies sold in bookstores and elsewhere. The &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; called it a &quot;stunning, tremendously beautiful reading experience ... a classic of adventure writing.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; noted, &quot;At its exciting best, this book keeps the reader cockpit close to a rare adventure.&quot; And Lindbergh biographer Brendan Gill concluded, &quot;The best authority on Lindbergh is Lindbergh.&quot;

In his book review that appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on September 13, 1953, Quentin Reynolds wrote:
==Later editions==
&quot;The Spirit of St. Louis&quot; continued to be reprinted in a number of editions with a variety of different covers with the copyright being renewed in 1981 by Anne Morrow Lindbergh. Later reprints beginning with the 1993 edition for the Minnesota Historical Society Press, featured an introduction written by Reeve Lindbergh. The latest hardcover and paperback editions are published by Scribner, the modern counterpart of the original, Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons. Scribner&#x27;s 1956 edition bore the iconic 1927 portrait photograph of Lindbergh as a US Air Mail pilot.

There is no commercial audiobook version; however, the Canadian National Institute for the Blind produced a version in the 1980s narrated by Gordon Gould, and the American National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped produced a version narrated by Bruce Huntey.

==Adaptations==
Lindbergh&#x27;s literary agent, George T. Bye, sold the film rights to Warner Bros. for more than a million dollars. The film version of the book was released in 1957, directed by Billy Wilder, and starring James Stewart as Charles Lindbergh.

==Legacy==
A copy of the book flew in space on the first competitive Ansari X Prize flight in 2004, SpaceShipOne flight 16P. The X Prize was inspired by the Orteig Prize that Lindbergh won for his flight.

<doc id="1030551" wikidata="Q1265113" url="?curid=1030551" title="Muttahida Qaumi Movement – London">
<text>The Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) (, ), previously known as Muhajir Qaumi Movement, is a secular political party in Pakistan that was founded by Altaf Hussain in 1984. Currently the party is split between two main factions. MQM-London faction is controlled by Altaf Hussain from London, while MQM-Pakistan is run by Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui based in Pakistan. Its electoral symbol was a kite.

It was founded as a student organization, All Pakistan Muhajir Student Organization (APMSO), in 1978 by Altaf Hussain. APMSO gave birth to the Muhajir Qaumi Movement in 1984. In 1997, the MQM removed the term Muhajir (which denoted the party&#x27;s roots among the country&#x27;s Urdu-speaking community) from its name and replaced it with &quot;Muttahida&quot; (&quot;United&quot;). The MQM is generally known as a party that once held strong mobilizing potential in Karachi, having traditionally been the dominant political force in the city.

The party has kept its influence over Pakistan&#x27;s federal government as a key coalition partner since the late 1980s (1988–1990, 1990–1992, 2002–2007, 2008–2013). However, in 2015, MQM parliamentarians resigned from the National Assembly, Senate and Provincial Assembly of Sindh in protest against a crackdown on party supporters.

In August 2016, after Altaf Hussain&#x27;s 22 August speech, there was military crackdown on the party. Nine Zero, the party headquarters in Karachi, was sealed, the party&#x27;s leaders including Farooq Sattar were arrested, and most elected parliamentarians in the MQM were forced to disassociate themselves from Altaf Hussain. MQM terminated Farooq Sattar&#x27;s party membership for party rules violations, and he then formed his own faction.

== History ==
=== Founding ===

The first political organization of Muhajirs, called All Pakistan Muhajir Student Organization (APMSO), was founded on 11 June 1978 by Altaf Hussain in Karachi University. On March 18, 1984, the APMSO evolved into a proper political organization—Muhajir Qaumi Movement. It was launched to protect the Muhajir community who perceived themselves as the victims of discrimination and repression by the quota system that gave preference to certain ethnicities for admissions in educational institutions and employment in civil services.

=== Late 1986 to 1990 ===
In its early years, MQM drew enormous crowds, the epitome of which was the rally of August 8, 1986 at Nishtar Park, Karachi. Three years into its existence, MQM won the November 1987 local body elections in Karachi and Hyderabad and had several mayors win unopposed. Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) won the highest number of seats in the general election of 1988 and formed a coalition government in the Sindh Province with the help of MQM, which then had a larger mandate in urban Sindh in comparison to PPP whose majority of support came from rural areas of Sindh. A 59-point agreement, called the Karachi Accord, was signed which included statements about protection of the democratic system and political rights, urban development goals, and creating objective criteria for admission to universities and colleges. Within a few months of the agreement, differences surfaced and MQM ministers in the Sindh Cabinet resigned because the agreement was not implemented. Thus, the alliance broke up in October 1989 and MQM joined hands with PPP&#x27;s opponents. During these times MQM made mark for public benefit initiatives. Khidmat-e-Khalq Committee, a social welfare initiative, was founded in 1978 which in 1998 transformed into Khidmat-e-Khalq Foundation (KKF).

=== 1990 to 1999 ===
In the elections of October 1990, MQM emerged as the third strongest party in the country. This time, it made its alliance with Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI) to establish a provincial government in Sindh whereas IJI formed the federal government. During these times, small factions of MQM separated themselves on the main body of the party, and the largest among these factions was MQM Haqiqi (), which was formed by Afaq Ahmad and Amir Khan. It is generally believed that MQM Haqiqi was formed by the collusion of Pakistani Government in power and the Establishment/Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to weaken MQM and was supported by successive federal governments and the military. In the years to come, federal governments switched between forming alliance with MQM and fighting against it to establish greater control over Karachi.

From 1992 to 1994, the MQM was the target of the Pakistan Army&#x27;s Operation Clean-up, The period is regarded as the bloodiest period in Karachi&#x27;s history, with thousands MQM workers and supporters killed or gone missing. Although more than 20 years have passed since the alleged arrest or disappearance of MQM workers, families of the missing people are still hopeful after registering the cases in the Supreme Court of Pakistan. The operation left thousands of Muhajir civilians dead.

The violence gripped urban Sindh politics in the late 1980s after General Zia ul-Haq&#x27;s era, and finally in 1992, the erstwhile government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif passed a resolution in assembly to launch a military operation in Karachi to target 72 &#x27;big fishes&#x27;. The federal government gave the reasoning behind this operation, known as &quot;Operation Clean-up&quot;, as the government&#x27;s attempt to end terrorism in Karachi and to seize unauthorized arms. Operation Clean-Up, which ostensibly sought to eliminate all terrorists irrespective of their political affiliation, began in June 1992. MQM perceived this operation as an attempt to wipe out the party altogether. Political violence erupted while MQM organized protests and strikes. The resulting lawlessness prevailed in the largest metropolitan city of Pakistan, which led to the country&#x27;s president dissolving the National Assembly.

During the 1992 violence Altaf Hussain left the country when a warrant was issued for him in connection with a murder. Since then, the political party is run by Mr Hussain from self-imposed exile in London.

MQM boycotted the subsequent 1993 general elections claiming organized military intimidation but participated in provincial elections. MQM secured 27 seats in provincial assembly, in comparison to its political rival PPP which won 56 seats. This resulted in PPP forming both the provincial and federal governments. Whereas, MQM Haqiqi failed to gain any seats at federal or provincial level. Political violence gained momentum in 1993 and 1994. During the 1994 violence, heavily political killings were reported between MQM, MQM factions, and Sindhi nationalist groups. By July 1995, more than 1,800 people had been assassinated in Karachi. In 1997, MQM boycotted the general elections and officially changed the previously maintained name &#x27;Muhajir&#x27; to &#x27;Muttahida&#x27;().

=== Accusations of violence ===

In the mid-1990s, MQM created widespread political violence and militancy that affected Pakistan&#x27;s Sindh province, particularly Karachi, the port city that is the country&#x27;s commercial capital. In the mid-1990s, the U.S. State Department, Amnesty International, and others accused the MQM and a rival faction, MQM Haqiqi, of summary killings, torture, and other abuses. The MQM-A routinely denied involvement in violence.

The party&#x27;s use of extra-legal activities in conflicts with political opponents have earned it the accusation of terrorism. The party&#x27;s strongly hierarchical order and personalist leadership style led to some critics labelling the MQM as fascist.

=== Jinnahpur Conspiracy ===
During Operation Clean-up, MQM was accused of being anti-Pakistan and of planning a separatist break-away state, Jinnahpur. However, later some senior army officers, Brigadier (R) Imtiaz and General (R) Naseer Akhtar, confessed that Jinnahpur was &quot;nothing but a drama&quot; against MQM for the military operation and there was no map of Jinnahpur.

On October 19, 1992, Pakistani newspapers carried an ISPR press release, conveying Army&#x27;s denial of the knowledge of the Jinnahpur plan. The ISPR, the public relations arm of the Pakistan Army stated, &quot;The Army had no evidence concerning the so-called Jinnahpur plan, it is clarified that the newspaper story in question is baseless. The Army has neither handed over to the government any document or map as reported, nor is it in possession of any evidence concerning the so-called Jinnahpur Plan. It is also factually wrong that the matter was discussed at any meeting of the corps commander.&quot; Asif Zardari who was then President of Pakistan is said to have &quot;said in a court premises in Karachi that the Jinnahpur scandal was created to malign the MQM.&quot;

=== 2001 to present ===
In 2001, MQM boycotted the local body elections but in the 2002 general elections, MQM won 17 out of 272 seats in national assembly.

In the 2008 elections, MQM won 25 seats in the National Assembly of Pakistan and 52 seats in the Provincial Assembly of Sindh.

In 2013, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) filed a Rs 5 billion defamation suit against Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf chairman Imran Khan at the Sindh High Court for issuing statements against MQM chief Altaf Hussain. MQM was also threatened by Taliban.

In June 2014, the Metropolitan Police raided the London home of its leader, Altaf Hussain, on suspicion of money-laundering.

In 2008, &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; released a Global Cities Index which named Mustafa Kamal as Mayor of the Moment, but Kamal gave all credit to Altaf Hussain.

The party has won majority in the local government election of Karachi and Hyderabad and brought its mayor in Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) and Hyderabad Municipal Corporation. The mayor of Karachi, Wasim Akhtar has been put behind bars without any charge by anti terror court and is waiting Sindh High Court to grant him bail in order to resume his office as the mayor of Karachi. MQM has also brought its chairman and vice chairman in the municipal committee of fourth largest city of Sindh Mirpurkhas.

=== Election Boycott 2018 ===
MQM and its leader Altaf Hussain decided to boycott elections in 2018 due to military intervention in political affairs, MQM-P which is a separate party now would instead contest for elections using traditional MQM symbol kite. This would be the second boycott of general elections after 1993 and third boycott of all elections including local bodies election in 2001. The average turnout of Karachi constituencies was 40.4% in 2018 elections comparing to 55 percent in 2013.

== Party structure ==
The party is led by Altaf Hussain under whose supervision, members of the Rabita Committee (also known as Central Coordination Committee) formulate the party&#x27;s political program. It consists of 24 members from Pakistan and 10 from London, United Kingdom. The party&#x27;s Karachi-based organizational operations are held under its Karachi Tanzeemi Committee.

On 20 November 2011, Muttahida Qaumi Movement announced the formation of Central Executive Committee with its members drawn from Azad Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtoonkhawa, Balochistan and Sindh. Addressing a Press Conference, Farooq Sattar, a senior MQM official, told that the purpose of Central Executive Committee is to assist MQM Coordination Committee and the party in organizational matters, policy-making and preparation of manifesto.

MQM has several chapters across the world in the United States, Canada, South Africa, several European countries, and Japan. Currently, the heads of MQM North America are former Federal Minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui and Ibad Rehman.

== Controversy ==
MQM&#x27;s Party leadership faced widespread arrests after Altaf Hussain&#x27;s controversial speech and later attack on ARY channel which faced much criticism from the media and particularly from the establishment which was discontented by his words: &#x27;Pakistan Murdabad&#x27; (Death to Pakistan). On the orders of Chief of Army Staff General Raheel Sharif Paramilitary forces immediately sealed MQM offices including Nine Zero. MQM&#x27;s deputy convenor Shahid Pasha, parliamentary leader Farooq Sattar, Sindh assembly opposition leader Izhar ul Hasan and Rabita Committee members Qamar Mansur and Member National Assembly and ex Hyderabad Mayor Kanwar Naveed Jameel were arrested. Farooq Sattar who was released shortly, later disassociated himself from MQM founder and leader Altaf Hussain saying his statements were unacceptable and later presented and facilitated resolutions in Federal and provincial assemblies against his controversial speech, Farooq also claimed to strip MQM chief from constitution and powers. The crackdown against MQM took a rapid turn when over hundred MQM Unit and Sector offices have been demolished and many MQM workers rounded up.

On August 21, 2016, according to Election Commission of Pakistan, Nadeem Nusrat and not Farooq Sattar was the leader of MQM. and According to Nadeem Nusrat, Minus Altaf formula is not acceptable.

MQM leadership in Sindh Assembly declared that it wants MQM leader Altaf Hussain tried for high treason and also removed Nadeem Nusrat, Convenor of the party along with Wasay Jaleel, Mustafa Azizabadi etc.

On 22 September 2016, MQM convenor Nadeem Nusrat termed the moves of Farooq Sattar against party rules and illegal and emphasized he is an elected Convenor and dissolved entire party infrastructure including Rabita Committee and ordered mass resignation of MQM parliamentarians from assemblies and to contest new elections on their own.

In a media conference the spokesman for the United States State Department, John Kirby, stated that US was aware of the arrests of the MQM leaders and was closely monitoring the events.

=== Naming controversy ===
Although media refers to Muttahida Qaumi Movement as MQM-London, MQM has instructed media to use the original name Muttahida Qaumi Movement only where as Farooq Sattar led faction has adopted the name MQM-Pakistan.

==Karachi Baldia Town factory==
A private garment factory lit on fire and the flames ignited chemicals that were stored in the factory. The Baldia Town factory inferno case took a dramatic turn on Friday 7 February 2015 when a report by Rangers claimed that the MQM was behind the deadly fire that claimed the lives of at least 258 factory workers.
MQM set fire factory to take Extortion money from owners.
A documentary film is prepared on Factory fire name Discount workers in 2020.

== State operations against MQM ==
=== Pakka Qila Operation (26, 27 May 1990) ===
The Pakka Qila Operation was launched by Sindh Police to target MQM workers in Pakka Qilla Hyderabad. Over 250 besieged people were killed during the operation, which carried on for 275 hours before Pakistan army men eventually moved in.

=== Operation Clean-up (1992–1994) ===
Operation Clean-up was started by late general Asif Nawaz after Jinnahpur conspiracy and major kaleem torture case.

=== Operation (1994–1996) ===
During the tenure of Benazir Bhutto, interior minister General Naseerullah Babar conducted a second operation against MQM between 1994 and 1996.

Due to serious doubts over credibility of operation due to fake encounters, extrajudicial killings and rise of killings in Karachi, Benazir Bhutto&#x27;s government was dismissed by the then President of Pakistan, Farooq Ahmed Laghari.

=== Operation (1998) ===
In the aftermath of Hakeem Saeed&#x27;s assassination, governor rule was imposed by Nawaz Sharif in the Sindh province and military operation was initiated against MQM.

=== Karachi targeted action (2013–present) ===
Due to rise in targeted killing, organised crimes of extortion, kidnapping for ransom and the increased crime rate of the city, the Nawaz Sharif government initiated the Karachi operation in 2013 with the intention of creating peace in the city. Even though the interior minister Chaudhry Nisar claimed that the intentions of the operation were apolitical, there have been systematic crackdowns against MQM. In 2015 MQM&#x27;s Headquarter Nine Zero was raided twice by the paramilitary Rangers and many top officials of MQM were taken into custody. On August 22, 2016, the Headquarter was sealed and hundreds of MQM offices were bulldozed.

Many journalists opine that the Army establishment is behind the formation of PSP and MQM-Pakistan. Many MQM officials including Zafar Arif, Kanwar Khalid Yunus, adv Sathi ishaq, Amjadullah khan, Qamar Mansur, and Shahid Pasha have been in detention since four months.

MNA Kanwar Naveed Jameed and MPA Kamran Farooqui have also been arrested by the paramilitary forces.

=== Human rights violations by the state ===
Targeted action between 1994 and 1996 saw gross human rights violations by the state organisations which included kidnapping for random, extrajudicial executions, disappearance, torture, fake encounters etc.

The speeches and images of Altaf Hussain have been banned by the decision of Lahore High Court&#x27;s justice Naqvi and Anti-Terror court has issued arrest warrants of Altaf Hussain numerous times.

Journalists have accepted that targeted operations are only against MQM.

During the Nine Zero raid, MQM worker Waqas Shah was shot down by Ranger&#x27;s 9mm pistol fire from point blank range. The video evidence released on electronic media confirmed the incident.

Farooq Sattar&#x27;s coordination officer Syed Aftab Ahmed was killed while in the custody of paramilitary forces. Initially the force denied torture and stated that he died of a heart attack, but it had to accept after social media publicised videos of torture marks on Aftab&#x27;s body and an autopsy report confirming death due to torture.

As a result of the operation, MQM claims 67 of its workers have been extrajudicially murdered by the paramilitary force, while 150 are still missing and more than 5,000 are imprisoned. The Amnesty International, US State Department, and the United Nations Human Rights Commission have published several documents highlighting gross human rights violations during the targeted operation against MQM.

== Electoral history ==
=== Post split election campaigns ===
MQM took part in local bodies by election from Union Committee 46 Hyderabad which was vacated by the death of counselor as independent candidate. MQM supported independent candidate Asif Baig defeated the candidate of MQM-Pakistan by a healthy margin.

<text>The Atlas XH-1 Alpha is a prototype attack helicopter built by Atlas Aviation (now Denel) of South Africa, which used it as a concept demonstrator for the then-planned Rooivalk project.

==Development==
It was developed from an Aérospatiale Alouette III airframe, retaining that helicopter&#x27;s engine and dynamic components, but replacing the original cockpit with a stepped tandem one, adding a 20 mm cannon under the chin and converting the undercarriage to tail-dragger configuration.

The XH-1 first flew on 3 February 1985, and soon embarked on a rigorous flight test program to examine the feasibility of a dedicated attack helicopter in southern African conditions. The results were ultimately good enough to convince Atlas and the South African Air Force to go ahead with the development of a dedicated attack helicopter, the Denel Rooivalk.

The XH-1 and Rooivalk are completely different aircraft and share no components. The Rooivalk was developed from the later XH-2 prototype.

The sole XH-1 was retired sometime in the late 1980s and was handed over to the South African Air Force Museum, where it remains to this day.

<text>Gernrode is a municipality in the district of Eichsfeld in Thuringia, Germany. Its agricultural land is some of the most productive in the district and it therefore does not have any wooded areas.

==Geography==
Gernrode is located in Upper Eichsfeld in the southern foothills of the Harz. It lies on both sides of the River Wipper, between the Dün and the Ohm Hills, in the centre of the Eichsfelder Kessel (although it is not part of the administrative unit of that name).

==History==
The ending &quot;-rode&quot; indicates that the village was founded sometime between the 8th and the 12th centuries. It is first mentioned, as &quot;Germenroth&quot;, in a document which may date to 1267. At this time it was governed by Haarburg, later by Haarburg-Worbis. During the Middle Ages, the course of the Wipper was changed, making possible the construction of 3 mills in the village. From 1586, Germenrode and Kirchworbis constituted a combined parish. In 1632, during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, troops from Weimar burnt down the church and the majority of the houses. The Catholic Church of St. Stephen, built in 1654 (and enlarged in 1932) has a baroque altar and is one of the largest and finest in Eichsfeld. The parish registers go back to 1662. In 1656, the population was reduced by war and plague to 382. The village recovered through migration from surrounding areas.

In 1802, with the rest of the then County of Eichsfeld, Gernrode became part of Prussia and during the Napoleonic Wars was temporarily part of the Kingdom of Westphalia. In the 18th century, the town&#x27;s economy benefited from flax processing, which was later commemorated in the municipal arms. In 1810, Gernrode had 820 residents.

In 1867, with the construction of the segment of the Halle–Kassel railway between Nordhausen and Arenshausen, Gernrode became the site of one of the 3 stations in Eichsfeld, which, however, was later renamed after Niederorschel because of confusion with Gernrode in the Harz. On 9 December 2007, the station was renamed Gernrode - Niederorschel.

In 1878 a new school was built, followed by a Great Hall. After industrialisation reduced demand for hand weaving and fabric bleaching, the inhabitants found work in plywood production and mechanised weaving near the station, and in cigar factories. Gernrode is today one of the largest settlements in the District of Eichsfeld.

<text>There were a number of Axis prisoner-of-war camps in Italy during World War II. The initials &quot;P.G.&quot; denote &quot;Prigione di Guerra&quot; (Prison of War), often interchanged with the title &quot;Campo&quot; (field or military camp). The Italian Armistice, declared on 8 September 1943, ended the Italian administration of the camps, many of which in the Italian Social Republic of northern and central Italy were resecured by the Germans and used to hold new prisoners and recaptured escapees.

<doc id="1030561" wikidata="Q1812910" url="?curid=1030561" title="Water fuel cell">
<text>The water fuel cell is a non-functional design for a &quot;perpetual motion machine&quot; created by Stanley Allen Meyer (August 24, 1940 – March 20, 1998). Meyer claimed that a car retrofitted with the device could use water as fuel instead of gasoline. Meyer&#x27;s claims about his &quot;Water Fuel Cell&quot; and the car that it powered were found to be fraudulent by an Ohio court in 1996.

== Purported design ==
The water fuel cell purportedly split water into its component elements, hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen gas was then burned to generate energy, a process that reconstituted the water molecules. According to Meyer, the device required less energy to perform electrolysis than the minimum energy requirement predicted or measured by conventional science. The mechanism of action was alleged to involve &quot;Brown&#x27;s gas&quot;, a mixture of oxyhydrogen with a ratio of 2:1, the same composition as liquid water; which would then be mixed with ambient air (nitrogen, oxygen, argon, etc). The resultant hydrogen gas was then burned to generate energy, which reconstituted the water molecules in another unit separate from the unit in which water was separated. If the device worked as specified, it would violate both the first and second laws of thermodynamics, allowing operation as a perpetual motion machine.

Throughout his patents Meyer used the terms &quot;fuel cell&quot; or &quot;water fuel cell&quot; to refer to the portion of his device in which electricity is passed through water to produce hydrogen and oxygen. Meyer&#x27;s use of the term in this sense is contrary to its usual meaning in science and engineering, in which such cells are conventionally called &quot;electrolytic cells&quot;. Furthermore, the term &quot;fuel cell&quot; is usually reserved for cells that produce electricity from a chemical redox reaction, whereas Meyer&#x27;s fuel cell consumed electricity, as shown in his patents and in the circuit pictured on the right. Meyer describes in a 1990 patent the use of a &quot;water fuel cell assembly&quot; and portrays some images of his &quot;fuel cell water capacitor&quot;. According to the patent, in this case &quot;... the term &#x27;fuel cell&#x27; refers to a single unit of the invention comprising a water capacitor cell ... that produces the fuel gas in accordance with the method of the invention.&quot;

== Media coverage ==
In a news report on an Ohio TV station, Meyer showed a dune buggy he claimed was powered by his water fuel cell. He stated that only 22 US gallons (83 liters) of water were required to travel from Los Angeles to New York. Furthermore, Meyer claimed to have replaced the spark plugs with &quot;injectors&quot; that introduced a hydrogen/oxygen mixture into the engine cylinders. The water was subjected to an electrical resonance that dissociated it into its basic atomic make-up. The water fuel cell would split the water into hydrogen and oxygen gas, which would then be combusted back into water vapor in a conventional internal combustion engine to produce net energy.

Philip Ball, writing in academic journal &quot;Nature&quot;, characterized Meyer&#x27;s claims as pseudoscience, noting that &quot;It&#x27;s not easy to establish how Meyer&#x27;s car was meant to work, except that it involved a fuel cell that was able to split water using less energy than was released by recombination of the elements ... Crusaders against pseudoscience can rant and rave as much as they like, but in the end they might as well accept that the myth of water as a fuel is never going to go away.&quot;

== Lawsuit ==

Stanley Meyer&#x27;s invention was later termed fraudulent after two investors to whom he had sold dealerships offering the right to do business in Water Fuel Cell technology sued him in 1996. His car was due to be examined by the expert witness Michael Laughton, Professor of Electrical Engineering at Queen Mary University of London and Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. However, Meyer made what Professor Laughton considered a &quot;lame excuse&quot; on the days of examination and did not allow the test to proceed. His &quot;water fuel cell&quot; was later examined by three expert witnesses in court who found that there &quot;was nothing revolutionary about the cell at all and that it was simply using conventional electrolysis.&quot; The court found Meyer had committed &quot;gross and egregious fraud&quot; and ordered him to repay the two investors their $25,000.

== Meyer&#x27;s death ==

Stanley Meyer died suddenly on March 20, 1998, while dining at a restaurant. His brother claimed that during a meeting with two Belgian investors, Meyer suddenly ran outside, saying &quot;They poisoned me&quot;. After an investigation, the Grove City police agreed with the Franklin County coroner report that ruled that Meyer, who had high blood pressure, died of a cerebral aneurysm. Some of Meyer&#x27;s supporters believe that he was assassinated to suppress his inventions. Philippe Vandemoortele, one of the Belgian investors, stated that he had been supporting Meyer financially for several years and considered him a personal friend, and that he has no idea where the rumors came from.

== Aftermath ==

Meyer&#x27;s patents have expired. His inventions are now in the public domain, available for all to use without restriction or royalty payment. No engine or vehicle manufacturer has incorporated Meyer&#x27;s work.

<doc id="1030564" wikidata="Q7281068" url="?curid=1030564" title="Radio Swan">
<text>Radio Swan was a pirate radio station owned by the CIA, and based in the Swan Islands, a group of islands in the western Caribbean Sea, near the coastline of Honduras. Under the &quot;Radio Swan&quot; and &quot;Radio Americas&quot; names, the station was in operation from 1960 to 1968.

==History==
In 1960, a Central Intelligence Agency cover, the Gibraltar Steamship Company owned and established Radio Swan on Swan Island, a covert black operation to win supporters for U.S. policies and discredit Fidel Castro. The Gibraltar Steamship Company did not own any steamships at the time while under the control of Thomas Dudley Cabot. 

The radio station began acting as a regular commercial broadcaster with sponsors such as Kleenex, Phillip Morris Co., and others lined up, operating with a 50,000-watt transmitter on AM 1165 (early 1960s) and 1160 and on shortwave with a power of 7,500 watts on 6 MHz. The station&#x27;s strategic location allowed it to target Cuba effectively, especially after U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower approved covert action against Castro in March 1960. As early as October 30, 1960, the Castro government sent reconnaissance flights over Swan Island and the Caribbean Coast of Guatemala (CIA 11-3-1960).

Swan Island was claimed by the governments of both the United States and Honduras, although the island was in the &quot;de facto&quot; hands of personnel acting on behalf of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). 

The AM transmitter in use by Radio Swan had been used by Radio Free Europe and was taken to Swan Island by US Navy Seabees of Mobile Construction Battalion 6 on two LSTs. Along with erecting two radio transmission towers, the Seabees built a small facility with an airstrip, dock and quonset hut. At first all broadcasts of this pseudo-commercial radio station were in the Spanish language and it was announced on air as &quot;Radio Swan, la Voz Internacional del Caribe&quot; (&quot;Radio Swan, the International Voice of the Caribbean&quot;), with its initial commercial programming coming on tape recordings from anti-Castro political groups in exile.

Cuba responded to the broadcasts by setting up a jamming station to block the transmissions of Radio Swan and initiated La Voz de INRA, or &quot;The Voice of INRA,&quot; which represented the National Institute of Agrarian Reform with an anti-American message. This action was followed on January 3, 1961, by a break in diplomatic relations between both countries that had been initiated by the US. Following this action, Cuba commenced broadcasting to the US and to the world, with a new international service called Radio Havana Cuba.

In March 1961, Radio Swan stopped selling airtime for political programming, switching to an all-news format infused with coded messages. The station identified itself as supporting anti-Castro forces in Cuba and expanded its broadcasts to fourteen frequencies. The station described itself as &quot;assisting those who are fighting Castro within Cuba&quot; and it began transmitting on fourteen frequencies. The CIA issued a press release claiming its anti-Castro broadcasts were now being beamed by seven radio stations as well as Radio Swan.

A station identifying itself as Radio Swan briefly resumed broadcasts in 1975–1976 on 6.185 MHz. The station used a mailing address in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, and referred to itself as &quot;La Primera Voz Democratica de Latinoamerica&quot; (&quot;The First Voice of Democracy in Latin America&quot;). Since San Pedro Sula is located on the Honduran mainland, it is possible that these broadcasts originated there rather than on Swan Island, though no positive verification has been determined.

==Bay of Pigs invasion broadcasts==
During the Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba, which took place between April 15–19, 1961, it became obvious to all concerned that the purpose of the station was to assist in the landings. But following the abortive invasion, Radio Swan suddenly changed format again. While its tone remained anti-Castro, its programming did not promote an uprising against the Cuban government. The station changed its format and name and Vanguard Service Corporation became new owners of the station. Radio Swan became Radio Americas and it remained on the air until May 1968 when the station closed down and its AM transmitter was transported to South Vietnam to assist in the wars of South-East Asia.

==&quot;The World Tomorrow&quot; radio program==
One of the loyal sponsors who advertised on both Radio Swan and Radio Americas was Herbert W. Armstrong with &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot; radio program. In the January edition of his magazine &quot;The Plain Truth&quot;, a letter to the editor praised Armstrong by claiming that &quot;&quot;... you could not have chosen a better station than Radio SWAN for reaching the Caribbean area. ... It is becoming popular with all those who share in the dislike of Fidel Castro and his communistic dictatorship.&quot; -&quot; Lady, Costa Rica&quot;.&quot;

In the same edition, his Radio Log listed his &#x27;The World Tomorrow&#x27; program as being broadcast by Radio Swan in the English language at 6 p.m. on Sundays and at 9 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. This listing remained unchanged through the edition of January 1962. The February 1962 edition of his Radio Log listed the English-language broadcast at 6:30 p.m. on Sundays over Radio Americas, but on the same frequency as Radio Swan, while the Spanish-language broadcast was listed at the same times as before, but over Radio Swan. In the March edition, the Spanish-language broadcast was also listed as being heard over Radio Americas.

&quot;The World Tomorrow&quot; broadcast was also carried on several other radio stations around the world which also appeared to have a proprietary connection to the CIA.

Kirchworbis is first mentioned in a 1209 document as &quot;Kirchworvece.&quot; Part of the Electorate of Mainz since the Middle Ages, the place became part of Prussia in 1802. After a short affiliation with the Kingdom of Westphalia, Kirchworbis was part of the Prussian Province of Saxony until 1945. During World War II, more than 100 women and men from Poland and Ukraine were brought to Kirchworbis and forced to work on farms, starting in 1940. From 1945 to 1949, Kirchworbis was in the Soviet occupied zone, and was part of East Germany from 1949 until German reunification in 1990.

<text>Stephen Alan Lillywhite (born 15 March 1955) is an English record producer. Since he began his career in 1977, Lillywhite has been credited on over 500 records, and has collaborated with a variety of musicians including new wave acts XTC, Big Country, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Simple Minds, Ultravox, the Psychedelic Furs, Beady Eye, Toyah, David Byrne, Talking Heads and Kirsty MacColl, as well as U2, the Rolling Stones, the Pogues, Blue October, Steel Pulse, the La&#x27;s, Peter Gabriel, Morrissey, the Killers, Dave Matthews Band, Phish, Guster, Counting Crows and Joan Armatrading. He has won six Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year and Producer of the Year, Non-Classical in 2006. In 2012, he was made a Commander of the Order of The British Empire (CBE) for his contributions to music.

==Career==
===Early years===
Lillywhite entered the music industry in 1972, when he worked as a tape operator for PolyGram. He produced a demo recording for Ultravox!, which led to them being offered a recording contract with Island Records. Lillywhite soon joined Island as a staff producer, where he worked with many of the leading new wave musicians, including his brother&#x27;s band, The Members, and guitarist Johnny Thunders, for whom he produced a solo album, &quot;So Alone&quot;. His first commercial success came in August 1978 as the producer of &quot;Hong Kong Garden&quot;, the debut single from Siouxsie and the Banshees which peaked at number 7 in the UK Singles chart. He was soon hired to produce Siouxsie and the Banshees&#x27; debut album &quot;The 
Scream&quot; which was certified silver in the UK. He also produced &quot;Ku Klux Klan&quot;, the first single that Steel Pulse released on Island Records in 1978. In 1979, he scored two hits for Virgin Records with The Members: the Surrey anthem &quot;Sound of the Suburbs&quot; and protest reggae classic &quot;Offshore Banking Business&quot;. Lillywhite along with engineer Hugh Padgham began working with the band XTC in June and July 1979 at Townhouse Studios in London for Virgin Records. The resulting album, &quot;Drums and Wires&quot;, was released on 17 August 1979 and &quot;Making Plans for Nigel&quot;, the single taken from the album, reached #17 on the UK Singles Chart in autumn that year.

===1980s===
In February 1980, the Psychedelic Furs&#x27; self-titled debut album was released, produced by Lillywhite. He also produced Peter Gabriel&#x27;s critically acclaimed third solo album &quot;Peter Gabriel&quot; (also known as &quot;III&quot; or &quot;Melt&quot;), which was released in May 1980 and topped the UK album chart. It established Gabriel as &quot;one of rock&#x27;s most ambitious, innovative musicians&quot; and &quot;raised considerably&quot; Lillywhite&#x27;s profile. During the recording of the album, he pioneered (with Gabriel and engineer Hugh Padgham) the gated reverb drum sound which became a hallmark of Phil Collins&#x27; solo career. Later in the year, &quot;Boy&quot;, the debut album of U2, was released, produced by Lillywhite. Lillywhite&#x27;s collaboration with U2 continued with the albums &quot;October&quot; and &quot;War&quot;. He moved on to produce work by Bruce Foxton (of The Jam), Big Country, XTC, The Chameleons, Toyah, Talking Heads, Eddie and the Hot Rods, Morrissey, The Rolling Stones and the &quot;Shine&quot; album by the former ABBA vocalist Anni-Frid Lyngstad. Lillywhite was also hired by Rush to produce their 1984 album, &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot; but, much to their frustration, withdrew from the project to work with Simple Minds. Alex Lifeson, Geddy Lee, and Neil Peart referred to Lillywhite as a man not of his word for not following through on what had already been scheduled.

In 1987, Lillywhite worked with the Pogues, producing &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot;. His wife, Kirsty MacColl, provided the lead female vocal for the song, which became the band&#x27;s biggest hit. The single narrowly missed being the UK Christmas number one single, but was still one of the biggest selling records that year, and has frequently returned to the holiday charts. MacColl also provided additional vocals during Lillywhite&#x27;s production of Talking Heads&#x27; final album, 1988&#x27;s &quot;Naked&quot;. 

The song &quot;Cotton Fields&quot;, from the Pogues&#x27; 1989 album &quot;Peace and Love&quot; (also produced by Lillywhite), includes a reference to &quot;Steve Lillywhite&#x27;s drunken mix&quot;.

===1990s===
During the 1990s, Lillywhite produced the multi platinum albums &quot;Under the Table and Dreaming&quot;, &quot;Crash&quot;, and &quot;Before These Crowded Streets&quot; by the Dave Matthews Band. In 1991, he continued to produce Morrissey and co-produced songs from U2&#x27;s &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;, working alongside Brian Eno, Daniel Lanois and Flood. That same year he returned to Dublin to produce Engine Alley&#x27;s debut album entitled &quot;A Sonic Holiday&quot;, and Kirsty MacColl again provided additional vocals, this time for the single &quot;Song for Someone&quot;. He also produced Travis&#x27; debut album and the debut (and only) album by The La&#x27;s. In 1996, he produced Phish&#x27;s &quot;Billy Breathes&quot;, and he returned to produce &quot;Joy&quot; in 2009.

Lilywhite was featured as the subject for a BBC Radio 1 documentary series on record producers. In 1999, he produced the US band Guster&#x27;s &quot;Lost and Gone Forever&quot;.

===2000s===
In 2000, Lillywhite was fired from the fourth album by the Dave Matthews Band after band members cited creative differences. In 2001, a number of their recordings emerged on a bootleg album, known now as &quot;The Lillywhite Sessions&quot;; many of the songs from those recordings followed later, on the Dave Matthews Band&#x27;s album &quot;Busted Stuff&quot;. The unfinished tracks appeared online, and the majority of the tracks were re-recorded, without Lillywhite, with Stephen Harris as the preferred choice by the band.

In 2002, Universal Music Group head Lucian Grainge invited Lillywhite to become managing director. Lillywhite signed singer-songwriter Darius Danesh and served as executive producer for his debut album &quot;Dive In&quot;, which spawned three Top 10 hits, and Mercury Records&#x27; first number one in eighteen years. He also signed Razorlight, and also produced Jason Mraz&#x27;s &quot;Mr. A-Z&quot;.

In September 2005, Lillywhite joined Columbia Records as a Senior Vice-president of A&amp;R. During his tenure he signed MGMT. He left the label at the end of 2006. Lillywhite collected consecutive Grammy Awards for Record of the Year with U2&#x27;s &quot;Beautiful Day&quot; and &quot;Walk On&quot;. In 2006, Lillywhite won three more Grammys: Producer of the Year (Non-Classical), Best Rock Album also with U2&#x27;s &quot;How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb&quot;; and a partial win for Album of the Year, also for &quot;How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb&quot;.

In late 2006, he worked with Chris Cornell on his album &quot;Carry On&quot;, and also produced two songs on Switchfoot&#x27;s album, &quot;Oh! Gravity.&quot;. In February 2007, Lillywhite began work with Crowded House on tracks for &quot;Time on Earth&quot;, the band&#x27;s first studio album in fourteen years. The majority of the album was produced by Ethan Johns, but Lillywhite produced four songs with the full touring line-up, including new drummer Matt Sherrod as well as studio guest guitarist Johnny Marr. Lillywhite&#x27;s next project was working with Matchbox Twenty on an EP that comprised a portion of &quot;Exile on Mainstream&quot;, a two-disc album that entered the US charts at No. 3 and Australian charts at No. 1. In 2008, Lillywhite again worked alongside Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois on U2&#x27;s &quot;No Line on the Horizon&quot;. He also worked on Blue October&#x27;s &quot;Approaching Normal&quot;, and rejoined Flood to work with Thirty Seconds to Mars on &quot;This Is War&quot;.

In 2008, Lillywhite produced a number of recordings for the &quot;World Cafe&quot; radio show on NPR. This included sessions at Avatar Studios in New York with Fleet Foxes, She &amp; Him, Bell X1, Dr. Dog, and Mercury Rev.

In November 2009, he began presenting his own weekly radio show on East Village Radio called &quot;The Lillywhite Sessions&quot;.

===2010s===
On 25 May 2010, the official Oasis website announced that Lillywhite was working with Liam Gallagher, Gem Archer, Andy Bell and Chris Sharrock on material for their new band Beady Eye. He co-produced, with the band, the album &quot;Different Gear, Still Speeding&quot;. 

Lillywhite produced an album for Evanescence at MSR Studios from February 2010 to April that year, but was scrapped in early 2011. On his work with Evanescence, Lillywhite said: &quot;what happened was a few people lost their nerve. I don&#x27;t even think it was her [Amy Lee]. It was people at the record company who really had no other band. They were thinking more in terms of the commerce rather than the art.&quot;

In 2011, Bono and the Edge brought Lillywhite in to produce the &quot;Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark&quot; cast recording for Interscope.

In 2012, Lillywhite was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to music.

On 16 July 2012, the &quot;Irish Examiner&quot; reported that Lillywhite was attached to a new television show entitled &quot;The Hit&quot;.

Lillywhite reunited with Thirty Seconds to Mars in 2012, co-producing the band&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams&quot;, alongside Jared Leto.

In 2015, at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards, Lillywhite was awarded his sixth Grammy Award for his work on Juanes&#x27;s album &quot;Loco De Amor&quot;. That same year, he was credited as a producer on Amy Lee&#x27;s cover of Chris Isaak&#x27;s &quot;Baby Did a Bad, Bad Thing&quot; for her &quot;Recover, Vol. 1&quot; EP. The track was originally recorded for Evanescence&#x27;s original third album produced by Lillywhite in 2010 but it was rejected by their label.

In 2016, Lillywhite produced an album by Thai rock band Slot Machine.

In April 2017, musician and writer Jon Regen wrote an article for &quot;The New York Times&quot; profiling Lillywhite and his work bundling recorded CDs with fried chicken in Indonesian KFC restaurants.

Lillywhite worked with a Japanese act for the first time when he co-produced Luna Sea&#x27;s 2019 album &quot;Cross&quot;. In interviews about the album, the producer has stated that he is semi-retired living in Jakarta for the past five years and now only works with select artists.

==Personal life==
Lillywhite was born in Surrey, England. From 1984 to 1994, he was married to Kirsty MacColl; they had two sons, Jamie and Louis. (MacColl died in 2000.) He married Patricia Louise Galluzzi on 29 May 2004; they divorced ten years later. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to music.

<doc id="1030582" wikidata="Q7360622" url="?curid=1030582" title="Role-oriented programming">
<text>Role-oriented programming as a form of computer programming aims at expressing things in terms that are analogous to human conceptual understanding of the world. This should make programs easier to understand and maintain.

The main idea of role-oriented programming is that humans think in terms of roles. This claim is often backed up by examples of social relations. For example, a student attending a class and the same student at a party are the same person, yet that person plays two different roles. In particular, the interactions of this person with the outside world depend on his current role. The roles typically share features, e.g., the intrinsic properties of being a person. This sharing of properties is often handled by the delegation mechanism.

In the older literature and in the field of databases, it seems that there has been little consideration for the context in which roles interplay with each other. Such a context is being established in newer role- and aspect-oriented programming languages such as Object Teams. Compare the use of &quot;role&quot; as &quot;a set of software programs (services) that enable a server to perform specific functions for users or computers on the network&quot; in Windows Server jargon.

Many researchers have argued the advantages of roles in modeling and implementation. Roles allow objects to evolve over time, they enable independent and concurrently existing views (interfaces) of the object, explicating the different contexts of the object, and separating concerns. Generally roles are a natural element of human daily concept-forming. Roles in programming languages enable objects to have changing interfaces, as we see in real life - things change over time, are used differently in different contexts, etc.

<doc id="1030583" wikidata="Q5388694" url="?curid=1030583" title="Erik Lindbergh">
<text>Erik Robbins Lindbergh (born 1965) is an American aviator, adventurer, and artist. He is the grandson of pioneering aviator Charles Lindbergh, the first person to fly non-stop and solo between New York and Paris in 1927. In 2002, Erik Lindbergh honored the 75th anniversary of his grandfather&#x27;s historic flight by retracing the journey in a single-engine Lancair aircraft. The journey was documented by the History Channel, raised over one million dollars for three charities, garnered half a billion media impressions for the X PRIZE Foundation and helped to jump-start the private Spaceflight industry. The flight prompted a call from United States President George W. Bush for inspiring the country after the tragedy of September 11.

==Career==
Erik has a degree in Aeronautical Science from Emery Aviation College, is a commercial rated pilot and flight instructor. owns the Lindbergh Gallery, and is the founder and CEO of Powering Imagination. He also serves on the board of directors of Aviation High School in Seattle, Washington. He lives in a yurt which he built in the Pacific Northwest.

He serves on the board of the X PRIZE Foundation, which administered the Ansari X Prize for the first non-governmental reusable crewed spacecraft, in addition to serving on the NatureBridge Olympic Board of Directors. The X Prize is seen as a major boost for the cause of space tourism, and of private spaceflight in general. It is fashioned after the Orteig Prize, the aviation incentive prize won by Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s transatlantic flight in 1927.
=== Anniversary flight ===

In May 2002, Erik Lindbergh honored the 75th anniversary of his grandfather&#x27;s historic flight by re-tracing the flight across the Atlantic in a small single engine aircraft, a Lancair Columbia 300 dubbed &quot;The New Spirit of St. Louis&quot; which cost US$289,000. Leaving from San Diego, he flew to St Louis, then Farmingdale, New York, and then the most famous portion, the non-stop flight from Republic Airport on Long Island to Le Bourget Airport in Paris on May 2, 2002.

The last portion of the flight was completed in 17 hours and 7 minutes, roughly half the time as the original (33 1/2 hours), but still a challenge as Lindbergh suffers from disabling rheumatoid arthritis and has two artificial knees. The &quot;Mission Control&quot; for the flight was located at the Saint Louis Science Center in St. Louis, Missouri, which as of 2011 maintains multiple exhibits about the flight.

Lindbergh participated in the Flight Across America project, speaking during the opening ceremonies at Paine Field, Everett, Washington on August 11, 2002 and then participating in the closing ceremonies in New York City on the deck of the USS &quot;Intrepid&quot; on September 8, 2002.

===Verdego Aero===

In December 2017, Lindbergh formed VerdeGo Aero with Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University&#x27;s Pat Anderson, and Eric Bartsch.
VerdeGo develops electric propulsion systems for aircraft.

As over 100 companies try to build eVTOL, Lindbergh wants to supply its electric distributed propulsion from 2023: the -H2 powered by one or two piston engines for 2-3-seat aircraft and the
 IDEP-H7 based on a gas turbine for 5-7-seaters.
Its competitors would include Safran, Siemens, Yates Electrospace, motorist MagniX or Swiss H55 formed by Solar Impulse co-founder André Borschberg.
Helicopter-style Articulated rotors provide more control for larger aircraft than multicopter drones&#x27; fixed-pitch propellers, avoiding control lag.

==Personal==
Son of Jon Lindbergh and Barbara Robbins, Erik Lindbergh is the grandson, by his father, of the pioneering aviators Charles Lindbergh and Anne Morrow Lindbergh. His father&#x27;s Lindbergh siblings are Land Morrow Lindbergh (1937–), writer Anne Spencer Lindbergh (1940–1993), conservationist Scott Lindbergh (1942–), and writer Reeve Lindbergh (1945–).

==Writing==
Lindbergh has written the foreword to several books, a monthly column in AOPA Pilot magazine and numerous freelance and op-ed articles.

==Awards, honors, distinctions==
In May 2008 Lindbergh was awarded an honorary doctorate of laws degree from Molloy College in NY for outstanding service to humanity.

<doc id="1030585" wikidata="Q711835" url="?curid=1030585" title="Arthur Wergs Mitchell">
<text>Arthur Wergs Mitchell, Sr. (December 22, 1883 – May 9, 1968), was a U.S. Representative from Illinois and civil rights activist. Representing Illinois&#x27;s 1st congressional district, for his entire congressional career from 1935 to 1943, he was the only African American in Congress. A supporter of the New Deal, Mitchell was the first African American to be elected to the United States Congress as a Democrat.

==Early life==
Mitchell was born to Taylor Mitchell and Emma (Patterson) in Lafayette, Alabama. He left home at 14 to attend the Tuskegee Institute. He worked on a farm and as an office boy to Booker T. Washington while attending the Institute. Mitchell attended Columbia University briefly and qualified for the bar. He then moved to Chicago, Illinois and began to work for the Republican Party. Mitchell switched from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party in 1932 as he was “ambitious and impatient with the entrenched black Republican leadership, [seeking] a chance for personal advancement in the concurrent rise of the national Democratic party.&quot; He was a member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity and served as its 6th International President from 1926–1934.

==Political career==
Mitchell was elected to the House of Representatives in 1934, defeating African American congressman Oscar De Priest, who was a Republican. During the election campaign, Mitchell emphasized his support for the New Deal and President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s public relief programs, in addition to criticizing De Priest&#x27;s opposition to segregation as ineffective. After Mitchell won the election with 53% of the vote, De Priest told him &quot;I congratulate you as [the] first Negro Democratic congressman.&quot;

In Congress, Mitchell introduced bills banning lynching and against discrimination. He filed a lawsuit against the Illinois Central and Rock Island Railroads after he was forced into a segregated train car just before it passed into Arkansas. Mitchell&#x27;s suit was advanced to the U.S. Supreme Court as case &quot;Mitchell v. United States&quot;, which ruled that the railroad violated the Interstate Commerce Act. He voluntarily chose not to seek re-election in 1942. As his last congressional act, Mitchell condemned politicians as preferring the Axis powers over giving Negros any rights, comparing the atrocities of the Nazis and Japanese with lynchings such as those that had recently occurred in Shubuta, Mississippi.

Despite having been elected to Congress in part on campaigning against De Priest&#x27;s civil rights record as weak, Mitchell himself faced accusations by civil rights advocates of making insufficient efforts. In one instance, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People deemed his introduced anti-lynching bill as too lenient.

==After Congress==
He moved to Virginia and became a farmer, working twelve acres (49,000 m²) of property. He died at his home in Petersburg, Virginia, on May 9, 1968.

<text>Fever is a 1982 novel by Robin Cook and is in the category of medical thriller.

==Plot==
Set mainly in the Boston area and in rural New Hampshire, its main characters are a 12-year-old girl, Michelle Martel, with leukemia and her father, Charles Martel, a former allergist turned cancer researcher, as well as her stepmother, Cathryn, and her two older brothers, Chuck and Jean-Paul.

After falling ill one winter morning, Michelle is hospitalized, diagnosed with acute myeloblastic leukemia, and given experimentally high doses of chemotherapy, to which her father objects, since it has no effect on her leukemia and weakens her with side effects. Cathryn, a former receptionist at the fictional Weinberger Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Charles has worked since turning to cancer research, has little medical knowledge and only wants what is best for her stepchildren, and feels torn between her husband and Michelle&#x27;s well-meaning but conventional doctors. Charles then traces Michelle&#x27;s leukemia and a neighbor boy&#x27;s fatal aplastic anemia to benzene dumped into the river flowing past their house by a local rubber and plastic recycling plant owned by the same corporation that owns the Weinberger Institute and the pharmaceutical company that makes a cancer drug he is being forced to study, and discovers that he is surrounded by corruption, as family, colleagues and the authorities turn against him. He ends up valiantly trying an experimental treatment based on his own research on Michelle, desperately trying to save her life, while barricaded in his own home, sought by the police, and fighting off attacks by thugs hired by the recycling plant and its parent company which are condoned by the local authorities.
