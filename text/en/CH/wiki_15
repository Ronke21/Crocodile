<text>This is a list of war apology statements issued by [[Japan]] regarding war crimes committed by the Empire of Japan during World War II. The statements were made at and after the end of World War II in Asia, from the 1950s to present day. Controversies remain to this day with some about the nature of the war crimes of the past and the appropriate person to make the apology. 

==Background==
At the end of the Pacific Theater of World War II, the Imperial Japanese government accepted the terms of the Potsdam Declaration. In 1945, the unconditional surrender of the Empire of Japan was formally confirmed aboard the Allied battleship, USS &quot;Missouri&quot; (BB-63). Once the formal documents were signed, General Douglas MacArthur, representing the Allies, was named the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Japan.

Emperor Hirohito let it be known to General MacArthur that he was prepared to apologize formally to General MacArthur for Japan&#x27;s actions during World War II—including an apology for the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor.

===Apology rebuffed===
In one version of the formal apology, Emperor Hirohito, the Japanese monarch, is reported to have said to General MacArthur: &quot;I come before you to offer myself to the judgment of the powers you represent, as one to bear sole responsibility for every political and military decision made and action taken by my people in the conduct of the war.&quot;

In a second version of the formal apology, Patrick Lennox Tierney claims that he was an eyewitness when the Emperor came to the Allied Supreme Commander&#x27;s headquarters to present this apology. Tierney was in his office on the fifth floor of the Dai-Ichi Insurance Building in Tokyo. This was the same floor where MacArthur&#x27;s suite was situated. Tierney reported that when the emperor arrived, MacArthur refused to admit him or acknowledge him, and the pivotal moment passed.

Many years later, Tierney made an effort to explain his understanding of the significance of what he claimed he had personally witnessed: &quot;Apology is a very important thing in Japan. ... It was the rudest, crudest, most uncalled for thing I have ever witnessed in my life.&quot; Whether true or not—issues which might have been addressed were allowed to remain open, and unanticipated consequences have unfolded across the decades since then.

Some in Japan have asserted that what is being demanded is that the Japanese Prime Minister or even the Emperor himself perform &quot;dogeza&quot;, in which an individual kneels and bows his head to the ground—a high form of apology in East Asian societies that Japan appears unwilling to do. Some point to an act by West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, who knelt at a monument to the Jewish victims of the Warsaw Ghetto, in 1970, as an example of a powerful and effective act of apology and reconciliation similar to &quot;dogeza&quot;.

==History==

===1950s===
* 1957: Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke said to the people of Burma: &quot;We view with deep regret the vexation we caused to the people of Burma in the war just passed.

The Japan of today is not the Japan of the past, but, as its Constitution indicates, is a peace-loving nation.&quot;

===1970s===
* September 29, 1972: Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka said to the people of the People&#x27;s Republic of China: &quot;The Japanese side is keenly conscious of the responsibility for the serious damage that Japan caused in the past to the Chinese people through war, and deeply reproaches itself. Further, the Japanese side reaffirms its position that it intends to realize the normalization of relations between the two countries from the stand of fully understanding &#x27;the three principles for the restoration of relations&#x27; put forward by the Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The Chinese side expresses its welcome for this&quot; (Joint Communique of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China).

Japan has recognized, in the Japan-ROK Joint Communique, of 1965, that the &#x27;past relations are regrettable, and Japan feels deep remorse,&#x27; and in the Japan-China Joint Communique, that Japan is &#x27;keenly conscious of the responsibility for the serious damage that Japan caused in the past to the Chinese people through war and deeply reproaches itself.&#x27; These statements confirm Japan&#x27;s remorse and determination which I stated above and this recognition has not changed at all to this day. 2.

Starting from our regret and resolve not to repeat such things a second time, we have followed a course as a &quot;Peace Nation&quot; since then. This awareness and regret should be emphasized especially in the relationship between our countries and the Korean Peninsula, our nearest neighbors both geographically and historically.

By listening to the opinions of people from various directions, I would like to consider sincerely in what way we can express our feelings to those who suffered such hardship&quot; (Statement by Chief Cabinet Secretary Koichi Kato on the Issue of the so-called &quot;Wartime Comfort Women&quot; from the Korean Peninsula).

It is imperative for us Japanese to look squarely to our history with the peoples of neighboring Asia and elsewhere. Only with a solid basis of mutual understanding and confidence that can be built through overcoming the pain on both sides, can we and the peoples of neighboring countries together clear up the future of Asia-Pacific... On the issue of wartime &#x27;comfort women,&#x27; which seriously stained the honor and dignity of many women, I would like to take this opportunity once again to express my profound and sincere remorse and apologies. With regard to this issue as well, I believe that one way of demonstrating such feelings of apologies and remorse is to work to further promote mutual understanding with the countries and areas concerned as well as to face squarely to the past and ensure that it is rightly conveyed to future generations.

Demands for an apology and compensation have been a recurring topic in Korean, Taiwanese, and Chinese politics. Western nations are also demanding long-overdue actions from the Japanese government, most notably through the United States House of Representatives House Resolution 121 voted in 2007. Criticisms regarding the degree and formality of apology, issued as a statement or delivered person-to-person to the country addressed, and the perception by some that some apologies are later retracted or contradicted by statements or actions of Japan, among others.

In October 2006, Prime Minister Shinzō Abe&#x27;s apology was followed on the same day by a visit of a group of 80 Japanese lawmakers to the Yasukuni Shrine which enshrines more than 1,000 convicted war criminals. Two years after the apology, Shinzo Abe also denied that the Imperial Japanese military had forced comfort women into sexual slavery during World War II. He also cast doubt on Murayama&#x27;s apology by saying, &quot;The Abe Cabinet is not necessarily keeping to it&quot; and by questioning the definition used in the apology by saying, &quot;There is no definitive answer either in academia or in the international community on what constitutes aggression. Things that happen between countries appear different depending on which side you&#x27;re looking from.&quot;

As of 2010, 24% of South Koreans still believe that Japan has never apologized for its colonial rule, while another 58% believe Japan has not apologized sufficiently. 

Some in the Japanese government have expressed exasperation at what level of apology is enough. During an impending visit in 1990 to Japan by South Korean president Roh Tae Woo Japanese cabinet secretary Ozawa Ichiro reportedly said, &quot;it is because we have reflected on the past that we cooperate with [South] Korea economically. Is it really necessary to grovel on our hands and knees and prostrate ourselves any more than we already have?&quot;

In 2013, some right-wing nationalists of Japan accused South Korea of hypocrisy, because in their view Japan had apologized and provided compensation for the sexual slavery it perpetrated during World War II yet South Korea has yet to address the Lai Đại Hàn, reported &quot;sexual slavery&quot; South Korea perpetrated during the Vietnam War. However, South Korea&#x27;s government claimed South Korea–Vietnam relations have &quot;improved&quot; since 1992. This is due to several &quot;apologetic&quot; statements from past presidents of South Korea, as well as the creation of the &quot;Pieta statue&quot; from South Korean non-governmental organizations. Although none of these measures have been given any recognition by Vietnamese officials that the issue is over. 

At the end of 2015, in response to the joint announcement by Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se to &quot;finally and irreversibly&quot; resolve the &quot;comfort women&quot; issue, some of the 46 remaining survivors expressed their discontent over the agreement. &quot;It seems neither government cares about the victims. I don&#x27;t count what they have agreed today. What we want is not monetary compensation but a legal one. We don’t want money. Those who commit crimes must take official, legal responsibility. I will fight until the day I die,&quot; said survivor Lee Yong-soo. However, survivor Yu Hee-Nam said, &quot;I know the government has made efforts to resolve the issue within this year, so I’ll follow their decision.&quot; But she also said the agreement was not satisfactory. &quot;Money is not the issue. We&#x27;ve lived without human rights.&quot;

===Forms of apology===

Washington Coalition for Comfort Women Issues also rebuffed the use of the word () rather than () in Japanese apologies. The coalition said that the expression &quot;in most cases means a sense of apology slightly weightier than &#x27;Excuse me&#x27; [in English]&quot;.

In a paper published by Jeffrey Mok and Mitsuhiro Tokunaga, this is attributed to a mistranslation and misunderstanding of the word . &quot;The use of was clearly appropriate in its formality and degree of imposition. Both the authoritative dictionaries from &quot;Beijing Waiguoyu Xuexiao Japanese-Chinese Dictionary&quot; and &quot;Iwanami Japanese-Chinese Dictionary&quot; categorized as a formal and weighty apologetic word. It was also commonly used as an official and formal way of apology and carried the same degree of regret as other formal forms of apologetic words such as , and (陳謝). It was also noted that the use of was limited to print and was rare. Both and were commonly used as an official and formal apologetic expressions and neither was considered weaker than the other.&quot;

The Japanese government and Prime Ministers have used the expression () that most closely translates in English to &quot;from our heart, most sincere apologies&quot; about this issue.

<text>Richie Baker (born 17 April 1980) is an Irish former footballer. Besides the Republic of Ireland, he has played in the United States.

==Career==

Richie, who served his footballing apprenticeship with Stella Maris, is the brother of Dessie Baker, alongside whom he made numerous appearances for Shelbourne in the late 1990s and early 2000s (decade). Richie made his League of Ireland and Shelbourne debut at the age of 18 against Shamrock Rovers in August 1998. During this period, Baker was an important part of the Irish national team youth teams, playing for the U-18&#x27;s, U-20&#x27;s, and U-21&#x27;s.

He represented his country at the UEFA U-19 Championship in Sweden in 1999 where he won a bronze medal.

Baker is the only player to have won 2 PFAI Young Player of the Year awards.

The highlight of Baker&#x27;s career was arguably his 83rd minute free-kick which earned Shelbourne a 1–0 victory away to Sloga Jugomagnat of the Republic of Macedonia in a Champions League qualifying match on 12 July 2000 []. This represented the first away victory achieved by an Irish side in European competition for almost two decades. Shels won the tie 2–1 but were eliminated by Norwegian champions Rosenborg in the second qualifying round.

Richie won both the League of Ireland championship and the FAI Cup with Shels in 1999/2000 and three further league titles with them in 2001/02, 2003, and 2006. He spent the 2004 season with the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer before returning to Shels for the beginning of the 2005 season. He was sent off in the last game of the 2006 season versus Bohemians but Shels still went on to win the game and clinch the title.

Following Shelbourne&#x27;s financial meltdown at the end of 2006, Baker signed for Drogheda United for the 2007 season. Baker picked up his fifth league title when United were crowned League of Ireland Premier Division champions at the end of the 2007 season. Baker spent two seasons at Drogheda United before financial problems at the County Louth club curtailed his spell. Despite training with Bohemians and Glentoran during 2009 pre-season Baker failed to find a new club to continue professional football. On 9 February 2009 Baker made a return to Shelbourne, now playing in the First Division, for a third spell where he was re-united with his former Shels boss Dermot Keely. He struggled for fitness on his return to Shelbourne but still made 25 league and cup appearances for Shelbourne in 2009, scoring 5 goals.

Baker was not offered a new contract by Shelbourne at the end of the 2009 season and on 4 March 2010 he signed for Bray Wanderers.

Interesting Fact: Richie&#x27;s favourite number is 11. The reason for this is a mystery.

<doc id="1013123" wikidata="Q2900548" url="?curid=1013123" title="Nanase Aikawa">
<text>is a Japanese singer. She publishes her music under the Motorod label, a division of Avex Group.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
She was born in Higashiyodogawa-ku, Osaka, Japan on February 16, 1975. Throughout her school years, Nanase had sung and participated in several singing competitions. When Aikawa auditioned for Sony Music Entertainment at the age of 15, she failed, but met a well-known music producer Tetsuro Oda.

At the age of 17, she dropped out of school, and she contacted Oda to be trained by him. At the age of 20 she released her first single, &quot;Yume Miru Shoujo ja Irarenai&quot; on November 8, 1995.

=== Career ===
After she released her first single on November 8, 1995, she released three more singles, and then her first full album &quot;Red&quot; in 1996, which sold more than two million copies in its first month. That album won her an invitation to perform on Kōhaku Uta Gassen, a New Year&#x27;s Eve singing contest between male and female teams of popular singers sponsored by NHK (one of Japan&#x27;s television networks).

Since then, she has released about one album each year, plus an average of three mini- or maxi-singles. Her second album, &quot;Paradox&quot;, was released in July 1997, selling 1.8 million copies, coinciding with her first concert tour Live Emotion &#x27;97 (consisting of 20 concert dates, and attracting a total of 65,000 fans, according to Avex).

July 1998 saw her third album &quot;Crimson&quot;, and another concert tour with over 40 concert dates. Her 1999 release, &quot;I.D.&quot; was a compilation album, but it debuted at number one on the rock chart, her fourth consecutive album to be released at the number one slot.

Some music-journalists said that a large part of her fan base, during the 1990s, was the Bōsōzoku (motorcycle gang) youthes especially those in the western areas of Japan.

In 2001, she also released a &#x27;mini-album&#x27; (sometime between a full album and a single) with only 7 tracks called the Last Quarter of uncharacteristically soft ballad-style music, recorded during her later months of pregnancy.

It was not until 2003 that she released another album, another compilation, called ID: 2. 

At the 11th Annual Japan Gold Disc Awards, Nanase&#x27;s album &quot;Red&quot; was voted the Best Album (Japanese Rock and Folk music, female vocalist category). Her album &quot;Paradox&quot; was also voted Best Album of the Year at the 12th Annual Japan Gold Disc Awards.
In February 2004, three years after her last original album and many singles, she released &quot;7 Seven&quot;. An album devoted to feelings relating to music and color, with each song dedicated to a certain color. Since then she has released four more singles.

In 2004, her song BYE BYE was covered by the English singer Jennifer Ellison as &quot;Bye Bye Boy&quot;, and Swedish girl group Play as &quot;Girls Can Too&quot;.

As of August 2004, Nanase Aikawa has released six albums, plus two compilation albums and the mini-album, a total of 24 singles, and no less than three separate concerts and two music video collections on video and DVD.

A year later, in February 2005, she released The First Quarter mini-album. This album focused more on ballads and soft music than her well-known rock edge. In November of that same year she released R.U.O.K?!, a mini-album with seven songs. In July 2007, Nanase Aikawa began work on her new album.

Her first music release while working on this album is as part of a limited unit called &quot;Crimson-FANG&quot; for the soundtrack of &quot;Kamen Rider Kiva: King of the Castle in the Demon World&quot;, having performed on the soundtrack on &quot;Kamen Rider Blade&quot; in 2004. The single for &quot;Circle of Life&quot;, was released on August 6, 2008.

Subsequently, Aikawa released her first digital single off her album Reborn entitled PRISM, which was released May 24, 2008. Her thirty-first single, Yumemiru..., a remix of her debut single Yumemiru Shoujo Ja Irarenai was released January 2009.

Aikawa Nanase released tAttoo, on November 11, 2009.

December 8, 2010, is the release date of &quot;Fine Fine Day,&quot; the first single from the &quot;Rockstar Steady&quot; project. A break from her previous image, Rockstar Steady is an all-girl rock band with Aikawa as its singer, and with songs such as &quot;Fine Fine Day&quot; entirely in English . For the music video, Nanase Aikawa went to Paris to work with the fashion film duo of Antoine Asseraf &amp; René Habermacher, who gave the video a lesbian-chic aesthetic.

<text>Joseph Ngwenya (born March 30, 1981, in Plumtree) is a Zimbabwean footballer.

==Career==

===College===
Ngwenya attended the Mzilikazi High School in Bulawayo, leading them to the 1999 Zimbabwe National High School Championship, before moving to the United States in 2000 to attend and play college soccer at Coastal Carolina University. He led the NCAA in scoring with 21 goals and 14 assists and was named a First Team All-American in 2003.

During his college years he also played in the USL Premier Development League for Cape Cod Crusaders who he led to a PDL title, scoring with 17 goals in 13 games.

===Professional===
Ngwenya was drafted third overall of the 2004 MLS SuperDraft by Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer. In his first year with the Galaxy, he played at both forward and midfield and finished the year with four goals in 22 games, most of them coming off the bench. In his second year, he was bothered by injury did not score a goal or an assist. Ngwenya was involved in a 4-person trade on May 12, 2006, which sent him to the Crew, for whom he would play 20 games and score five goals in 2006.

In the period following the 2006 season, Ngwenya went on trial at Getafe in the Spanish first division, but failed to earn a contract. He was traded to Houston Dynamo during the 2007 season for Alejandro Moreno. Ngwenya scored the game tying goal in the 2007 MLS Cup Final which Houston won 2–1 at RFK Stadium.

Following the 2007 MLS season, Ngwenya joined German second division team Alemannia Aachen for an opportunity to train and tryout with the Bundesliga club.

On January 21, 2008, Ngwenya was signed by Austrian Bundesliga club SK Austria Kärnten. After Kärnten dissolved his contract in summer 2008 he gained the chance to train with the first squad of FC Bayern Munich for three weeks. On July 23, 2008, Ngwenya appeared in the unofficial T-Home German Supercup for Bayern Munich against Borussia Dortmund.

After going almost a year without a club on April 6, 2010, Houston Dynamo announced that Ngwenya would be evaluated on a one-week basis for consideration of a return to the team. The Dynamo recognized the need for help at the forward position after Brian Ching sustained a hamstring injury in their home opener against Real Salt Lake. He agreed terms with Houston on April 12, 2010.

Ngwenya remained with Houston for the 2010 season but was not tendered a contract for 2011. He entered the 2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft and was selected by D.C. United with the first pick.

He spent the 2011 season with D.C. United, scoring zero goals in 16 games. At season&#x27;s end, the club declined his 2012 contract option and he entered the 2011 MLS Re-Entry Draft. Ngwenya was not selected in the draft and became a free agent.

Ngwenya signed with USL Pro club Richmond Kickers on April 11, 2013.

It was announced on November 5, 2013, that Ngwenya has signed a contract with USL Pro club the Pittsburgh Riverhounds for the 2014 season.

<text>Dennis J. Bennett (October 28, 1917 – November 1, 1991) was an American Episcopal priest, who, starting in 1960, testified that he had received the Baptism of the Holy Spirit.

Born in England but raised in California, Bennett was a seminal figure in the Charismatic Movement within the Christian church. After proclaiming on April 3, 1960 from the pulpit that he had been baptized in the Holy Spirit, he was asked to resign at St. Mark&#x27;s Episcopal Church, a 2600-member congregation in Van Nuys, California. Bennett was featured in articles in both &quot;Newsweek&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; magazines and rather than subjecting his church to a media frenzy, he did resign his pastorate. He continued his ministry at St. Luke&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Seattle, Washington until 1981. After that Trevor Dearing succeeded him as the rector.

Bennett then left the parish to found and lead the Christian Renewal Association with his wife Rita. He was also instrumental in the 1973 founding of Episcopal Renewal Ministries (now named Acts 29 ministry).

<text>The Order of Angell, known for decades as Michigamua, was a senior honorary society recognizing student leaders and outstanding athletes at the University of Michigan. For most of its history, its practices reflected images of Native Americans drawn from Euro-American popular culture. From Michigamua&#x27;s founding in 1901 until the 1970s, membership was a badge of distinction. From the 1970s on, the society drew rising criticism for admitting only men; for the form of cultural appropriation known as &quot;playing Indian;&quot; and for possessing Native American artifacts. 

By 1999, when women were first admitted, the organization had discarded many of its &quot;faux&quot;-Native American references and practices. But in 2000, protesters took over the group&#x27;s headquarters and demanded its ouster from the campus. Soon afterward, Michigamua lost its official recognition and its meeting room. In 2006-07 it reorganized as the Order of Angell with a vow to foster diversity and draw its members from the broadest possible array of candidates. But critics continued to denounce the Order on the grounds of its secrecy, elitism, and origins in Michigamua. In February 2021, after several current and former BIPOC members of the organization urged that the Order of Angell be dissolved, the active members disbanded the society and declared that it should never be reconstituted.

== History ==

=== Founding and early years ===
The founding of Michigamua in 1901 stemmed in part from a sharp rise in the number of students at Michigan, from some 1,500 in the 1880s to 4,500 by 1910. With the dilution of close relations between students and faculty, students sought community in organizations of their own, including fraternities and sororities, dramatic and musical societies, publications, and athletic teams. Honorary societies arose to recognize the leaders of these groups.

In the academic year 1900-1901, 15 students in a philosophy course taught by Professor Robert Mark Wenley formed the Hot Air Club, a social group that soon declared itself a formal society of seniors that would take, as a founder put it, &quot;an Indian tribe as the means of expression and the name Michigamua.&quot; Members believed &quot;Michigamua&quot; was the name of an actual indigenous tribe of the Great Lakes region and the state&#x27;s namesake. There was no such tribe, though the state&#x27;s name is indeed a variant of the Ojibwe word &quot;gichigami&quot; or &quot;michigami&quot;, meaning &quot;large water&quot;.

The founders were inspired by novels featuring senior societies at Eastern colleges. The best known included three at Yale (Skull and Bones, founded 1832; Scroll and Key, founded 1842; and Wolf&#x27;s Head, founded 1884). Other such groups had emerged at Cornell, Dartmouth, Columbia, and the University of Pennsylvania, among others.

Members defined the group&#x27;s mission as to &quot;fight like hell for Michigan and Michigamua,&quot; which meant simply that Michigamua regarded itself as an embodiment of &quot;school spirit&quot;, to use the expression then coming into vogue. As on other campuses, allegiance to one&#x27;s university or college as a whole was promoted as a corrective to the rancorous loyalties to one&#x27;s class or academic unit that often provoked rowdy and violent &quot;rushes&quot;. Promoting school spirit also partook of the boosterism common to U.S. cities and towns in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

Michigamua maintained its prestige and remained largely free of controversy through the 1960s. Several factors helped it to thrive in the long term. One was the practice of recruiting honorary &quot;sachems&quot; from among the university&#x27;s administrators, prominent faculty and athletic directors, and coaches. These included members of the governing board of regents; four presidents of the university (Harry Burns Hutchins, Alexander Grant Ruthven, Harlan Hatcher and Robben W. Fleming); and the varsity football coaches Fielding H. Yost, Fritz Crisler and Bo Schembechler. Connections to the university&#x27;s upper echelons helped to cement Michigamua&#x27;s place in campus culture. Close contacts also were maintained with upper-level administrators, especially T. Hawley Tapping, head of the university&#x27;s alumni association from the 1930s through the 1950s, and John Feldkamp, &quot;sachem&quot; of Michigamua in 1960-61 and director of the university&#x27;s housing office from 1966 to 1977.

Michigamua&#x27;s longevity also was supported by an alumni body, the &quot;Old Braves Council,&quot; which was founded shortly after World War II. With so many male students in the armed forces, the group&#x27;s wartime rosters dwindled. Then the campus was swamped with military veterans, older on average than students of pre-war years and less interested in undergraduate traditions. So Frederick C. Matthaei, a member of the university&#x27;s governing board and an honorary sachem, worked with his son, Frederick C. Matthaei Jr., a member of the &quot;tribe&quot;, to recruit a full complement of &quot;fighting braves&quot; for 1946-47 and to start a board of alumni to advise new members on traditions, plan alumni gatherings and raise money for the upkeep of the &quot;wigwam&quot;. (Michigamua began to hold some of its activities on Matthaei property a few miles from the university&#x27;s campus. A totem pole dedicated to Michigamua was erected on the property. In 1957 and 1961, Matthaei donated the acreage to the university; it became the site of the Matthaei Botanical Gardens and the Radrick Farm golf course.)

=== Challenges and responses, 1970s-1999 ===
In the 1970s, critics began to challenge Michigamua&#x27;s privileged status. Women argued that the university&#x27;s support violated federal rules against sex discrimination. Native Americans cited state and federal protections against racial bias. The complaints prompted Michigamua to make concessions that changed elements of the organization but preserved its recognition as a sanctioned student body through the 1990s.

The earliest legal complaint came in 1972 from a chapter of American Indians Unlimited (AIU) led by Victoria Barner, a Michigan graduate student and member of the Nisga&#x27;a tribe of British Columbia. Addressing the Michigan Civil Rights Commission, Barner called Rope Day &quot;demeaning and insulting to the Indian culture and heritage.&quot; By sanctioning Michigamua, the university permitted &quot;our culture to be distorted and ridiculed because of our race and national origin&quot;. Replying to Barner, members of Michigamua said the &quot;tribe&quot; was &quot;based on principles that reject any insulting or offensive actions&quot; and promised to &quot;eliminate all public actions of our organization&quot;. The commission ordered Michigamua to stop &quot;playing Indian&quot; in public. From then on, the &quot;tribe&quot; initiated new members without spectators at the university&#x27;s off-campus Radrick Farm property. Meetings in the &quot;wigwam&quot; continued. Later cadres were reported to have &quot;played Indian&quot; in public, breaking the pledge to operate solely in private.

In 1976, Michigamua&#x27;s males-only tradition came under fire from two women students associated with the university&#x27;s student government, the Michigan Student Assembly (MSA). They were Amy Blumenthal, MSA&#x27;s vice president, and Anita Tanay, a former member. Blumenthal and Tanay asserted that by providing facilities and aid to the all-male Michigamua — including its rent-free room in the Union, special privileges to use Radrick Farm, and alleged favoritism in access to football tickets — the university was violating Title IX of the U.S. Education Amendments of 1972, which forbade gender discrimination by educational institutions that received federal funding.

A stand-off ensued among Michigamua, the university, and the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW, later the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services), which then administered Title IX. The issue turned in part on whether Michigamua was an honorary society or a social fraternity. If the former, its single-sex nature would violate Title IX. If the latter, it could stay males-only, since Title IX specifically excluded social fraternities and sororities from its purview. While HEW considered the complaint, university administers decided Michigamua was indeed an honorary society and offered the &quot;tribe&quot; three options — 1) admit women; 2) abandon its status as a recognized student organization and leave the campus; or 3) declare itself a social fraternity and abide by the rules that governed other such organizations, which would likely end its exclusive use of the &quot;wigwam&quot;. Michigamua said it would accept only some version of the third option. The university deferred action pending HEW&#x27;s ruling.

In 1979, more than three years after Blumenthal and Tanay&#x27;s complaint, HEW ruled the university had violated Title IX by recognizing Michigamua as a student group and providing a space to meet, thus rejecting the university&#x27;s claim that Michigamua was independent of the university. HEW also noted that Michigamua was widely understood to be an honorary society, not a social fraternity, so it was subject to Title IX&#x27;s ban on gender discrimination. The university was ordered to enforce changes in Michigamua or risk a loss of federal funding.

Students and administrators worked out a compromise. They would establish the Tower Society, a new honorary organization with two parts — Michigamua for men and Adara (later renamed Phoenix) for leading women students. Michigamua would continue to meet in the &quot;wigwam&quot; while Adara would meet in a room one floor below, and the two groups would hold regular joint meetings. (The Vulcans engineering honorary would later join the Tower Society, with a meeting room two floors below the &quot;wigwam&quot;.)

This arrangement satisfied HEW but not Michigamua&#x27;s critics, especially Native American students. One of them, Grace Pego, had filed a separate civil-rights claim in 1976 shortly after Blumenthal and Tanay made their Title IX complaint. Pego asserted that Michigamua — and thus the university, by supporting it— was violating an amendment to the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 &quot;by denying membership to minorities and ridiculing Native American culture.&quot; The university deflected federal action by pointing to Michigamua&#x27;s induction of numerous African Americans and citing the group&#x27;s assertion that it &quot;holds the American Indian in the highest esteem.&quot; But Native American students and their non-native supporters would echo Pego&#x27;s complaint in the coming years, insisting that Michigamua&#x27;s traditions made a racist mockery of native cultures.

Confronted with such complaints, members of Michigamua usually invoked either of two points of view. Older alumni, echoing the founders, typically argued that Michigamua honored Native Americans. Younger members were more likely to say that critics were mistaking Michigamua&#x27;s practices as commentary on actual Native Americans, when in fact the &quot;tribe&quot; had crafted a subculture of its own out of pop-culture Indian caricatures. The &quot;Michigan Daily&quot; quoted an unnamed member of the 1975 cadre as saying: &quot;Michigamua — unfortunately, maybe — has adopted things from the grade-B movies on TV. I don&#x27;t think anybody in Michigamua considers them to be Indian. It&#x27;s always Michigamua tradition, Michigamua lore, an identity of Michigamua rather than Indian.&quot;

From the 1970s through the 1990s, Michigamua continued to induct new cadres, but its standing had declined. With the departure of Rope Day from the central campus, many Michigan students were no longer even aware of the organization. It also came under scrutiny for hazing activities banned by the Michigan Student Assembly.

In 1988, two new blows challenged Michigamua&#x27;s grip on its traditions. The Michigan Student Assembly voted to withdraw its recognition of Michigamua as an approved student organization, citing critics&#x27; charges of racism and elitism. And the Michigan Civil Rights Commission warned the state&#x27;s universities that any use of Indian names, logos, or mascots violated state civil rights laws.

In response, Michigamua promised in 1989 to drop nearly all &quot;faux&quot;-Native American references. Henceforth its rituals and nomenclature would refer only to University of Michigan traditions. Members would be called &quot;fighting wolves&quot; — a reference to the university&#x27;s team name, the Wolverines — instead of &quot;fighting braves&quot;. The group would refer to itself as a &quot;pride&quot; rather than a &quot;tribe&quot;. There would be no more &quot;Injun talk&quot; in meetings. Only one explicit reference to Native Americans would remain — the name Michigamua itself, with its echo of the Ojibwe language. With these concessions, the group regained recognition as an approved student organization and fended off state penalties.

In the 1990s, Michigamua tried to adjust to a new era in which multiculturalism and gender equality had been embraced as governing principles. By the late 1990s, each class included at least a few members who identified as progressive. The greatest change came in 1999 when, under pressure from university officials who had rethought Title IX&#x27;s applicability to single-sex student organizations, Michigamua admitted its first women members.

=== Tower occupation and aftermath ===
Complaints about Michigamua and racism persisted. The university&#x27;s Native American Student Association (NASA) asserted that &quot;playing Indian&quot; remained a part of the group&#x27;s identity, at least in its name and publications, and that the group continued to improperly possess authentic tribal artifacts. In the spring of 1999, Native American students submitted requests to the administration that echoed earlier demands — better efforts to recruit Native students and faculty; a Native American studies program; courses in the Anishinaabe language; and the end of all recognition of Michigamua. Those demands set the stage for a major escalation in the long-running conflict.

On February 6, 2000, some 20 members of a new group, the Students of Color Coalition (SCC), gained access to the &quot;wigwam&quot; and announced they would stay until the university ejected Michigamua from the campus. University officials allowed a few protesters to remain pending a resolution of the dispute.

The protest attracted significant attention on campus and in the local press. Protesters extracted Native American artifacts — some authentic, some &quot;faux&quot;-Indian souvenirs — from a storage space in the &quot;wigwam&quot; and displayed them on Michigamua&#x27;s meeting table, then invited people in to view the materials. Rallies were held in support of NASA&#x27;s demands. After a report of the occupation appeared in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, the civil-rights activist Al Sharpton announced plans to visit Ann Arbor to support the protesters.

Spokesmen for Michigamua responded to the occupation by saying the current cadre of members wanted to fully understand the protesters&#x27; grievances and remedy past wrongs. &quot;The space is the secondary issue,&quot; said Rishi Moudgil, a leader among the members. &quot;The pain is the primary issue... We are questioning what has happened in the past. We don&#x27;t want to make the same mistakes.&quot; Members apologized for offending Native Americans and said they had never seen, let alone put on display, the Native American objects now on public view. The objects had been stored unseen in an attic, they said, and they agreed to hand them over to university officials. Michigamua alumni took the blame, telling reporters they should have removed the objects from the Union long before. Members held firm on retaining their space in the tower but offered to have it renovated under the supervision of a Native American elder.

Joe Reilly, a Michigan senior, Native American activist, and spokesman for the protesters, said Michigamua had forfeited its credibility by breaking past promises and dragging its heels in making changes. Protesters said they would meet only with top officials of the university.

Ten days after the occupation began, the university&#x27;s president, Lee Bollinger, addressed the protesters&#x27; grievances. Michigamua&#x27;s agreement to turn over native artifacts to the university had put that particular matter to rest, he said. Otherwise, he said, the university would not disallow one student group because its activities offended another; the question must go to the student government, which alone held the power to recognize student groups. As for Michigamua&#x27;s claim on space in the Union Tower, Bollinger said, that merited review by a neutral committee.

As critics and supporters of the occupation traded views in the press, the occupation continued. Sharpton, appearing before SCC supporters, rebuked Bollinger for his claim that Michigamua enjoyed First Amendment protections. &quot;You have a right to call me a n*****,&quot; Sharpton said, &quot;but you don&#x27;t have the right to make me pay for it. We&#x27;re talking about a permanent use of this tower that&#x27;s subsidized by public funds.&quot;

After 37 days, protesters left the &quot;wigwam&quot; with only one key issue resolved — native materials were turned over to the university&#x27;s Museum of Natural History. Soon afterward, members voted to change the organization&#x27;s name to &quot;Michigamua: New Traditions for a New Millenium&quot; and offered to renovate the &quot;wigwam&quot; to remove all native references. But the latter point became moot when the university ruled that no student group should enjoy exclusive access to the tower rooms and ordered Michigamua, Adara, and Vulcans to vacate their rooms. The student government voted again to terminate Michigamua&#x27;s status as a recognized student organization. The group continued to meet in private quarters off campus and to initiate new members.

The stand-off between Michigamua and its critics continued for several years. Protesters demanded the group go entirely out of existence. Once again Michigamua said it had ended all practices to which opponents objected except the retention of its name. Efforts were made to further diversify its membership by race, gender, sexual preference, and political ideology. But some students who were invited to join refused to do so, citing the group&#x27;s controversial past. Early in 2006, three progressive student organizations ousted members who had joined Michigamua. Heated debate culminated in Michigamua&#x27;s announcement in April 2006 that it would undertake a thorough reorganization and choose a new name.

=== Order of Angell ===
In February 2007, members announced that Michigamua would become the Order of Angell, a name selected to honor James Burrill Angell, president of Michigan from 1871 to 1909, renowned for building Michigan into a leading public university. They apologized for Michigamua&#x27;s use of Native American themes and artifacts. Like Michigamua, the Order would select new members from the ranks of student leaders, but with increased efforts to ensure diversity. Rosters would be made public. Their aim would be &quot;to bridge the communication gap between the many groups on campus, to help U-M realize the potential of its diverse reputation.&quot; Its first &quot;prexy&quot;, or president, was Sirene Abou-Chakra, a Lebanese-American student who led the Arab-American Student Association. Other members included the woman president of the Michigan Student Assembly; the leader of Army ROTC; and the co-captain of the men&#x27;s varsity football team. &quot;Our diversity is our strength,&quot; said Andrew Yahkind, the Jewish leader of the LSA Student Government. &quot;I would not have joined this organization if I saw anything that was remotely insensitive.&quot; The Order sought and received recognition as an official student organization. Meetings were held in various locations. The old tower meeting space remained closed.

In 2009, the Order of Angell started Leaders for Life, an annual program aimed at fostering leadership skills among 100 invited sophomores and juniors. Each year until 2019, prominent figures spoke to the question: &quot;Knowing what you know now, what advice would you give to student leaders?&quot; Participants included three presidents of the university; Michigan&#x27;s governor; varsity football coaches; and leaders of businesses, community-welfare organizations, and arts groups. In 2012, Leaders for Life surveyed some 1,200 student leaders of roughly 300 student organizations on campus to identify traits that make for effective leadership among college students. A follow-up survey in 2016 surveyed some 8,000 recent Michigan graduates to see if the traits identified in the initial survey were helpful after graduation.

Members met for weekly discussions and encouraged constructive campus activities without officially sponsoring them. One example was Dance Marathon, a non-profit student organization that staged a major annual fundraising event for children with disabilities and serious illnesses. Another was K-grams, a mentoring program that matched Michigan students with elementary-school students in southeastern Michigan, most notably with a pen-pal project that fostered monthly correspondence between mentors and their mentees.

For several years, the Order of Angell operated with little controversy. Then, in the 2010s, several student groups began to object if their members joined the Order, citing its ancestral ties to Michigamua or its reputation for secrecy or both. Some students declined invitations. Then, in 2019, three student organizations — the United Asian American Organizations, La Casa (a Latinx group), and the renamed Arab Student Association — denounced the Order and forbade its members to join it, saying, as the Arab Student Association put it, &quot;an honest platform for diversity, inclusion, and transparency cannot be built on a foundation of the oppression of the Native community.&quot;

Members defended the Order, saying its roster and mission were matters of public record and that roughly half its members were students of color and roughly half women. They also acknowledged past wrongs committed by Michigamua.

Early in 2021, current members of the Order told alumni by email they were considering disbanding the organization for good — a decision that any year&#x27;s membership could make without interference by alumni — and solicited advice. According to the &quot;Michigan Daily&quot;, the email reported many problems in the 2020-21 academic year, including restrictions on face-to-face meetings during the COVID-19 pandemic. The email read in part: &quot;Dealing with being labeled as racists on social media, the internal push for further reforms, and the inability to engage in oral and in-person traditions have eroded confidence in selecting another Pride.&quot;

The &quot;Daily&quot; reported a letter sent to the Order by current and past members who identified as BIPOC (Black and indigenous people of color). The signatories urged the current members to disband the Order or, failing that, to implement reform measures that would include &quot;a public-facing truth-telling of the history of Order&quot; and cutting all ties to pre-2006 alumni. Since the reorganization of 2006, they said, the Order had failed to &quot;engage in truth, reconciliation, or healing&quot; or &quot;address the deep, systemic fibers of white supremacy that form the foundation of the organization... The power within the organization was always with white students, backed by a powerful cadre of alumni who pulled strings within the Pride.&quot; In meetings, they charged, &quot;students of color often faced a hostile environment riddled with microaggressions and tokenism&quot;.

In March 2021, the Order announced its decision to disband. Members acknowledged predecessors&#x27; efforts to &quot;rectify past harm by eliminating traditions rooted in Indigenous cultural appropriation, changing the name from Michigamua to Order of Angell, and attempting to open conversation channels with communities who expressed dissent to Order&#x27;s continued existence.&quot; But the group&#x27;s &quot;historical lack of transparency and sufficient action&quot; made it impossible to carry out its &quot;core mission to make the Michigan campus a better place for students.&quot; The letter concluded: &quot;In the strongest terms possible, we condemn any attempts to keep the organization alive in secret, restart the group, or build a new one that seeks to erase the history of the Order of Angell.&quot;

== Native American themes ==

Michigamua was not unusual among fraternal organizations in drawing motifs from an idealized past but it was unusual among college honorary societies in its use of Native American themes. White Americans had been masquerading as Indians for various purposes since before the American Revolution. The colonists who posed as Mohawks in the Boston Tea Party of 1773 are only the best remembered of many Americans of the colonial and early national eras who rebelled against authority in Indian costume. A few groups evolved into political organizations, such as the Tammany societies of Philadelphia and New York, named for a Lenape [Delaware] chief named Tamanend. Other Indian-themed groups were purely fraternal, such as the Society of Red Men and its successor, the Improved Order of Red Men. Members found community and camaraderie in gatherings that partook of secret rituals, names, hierarchies and costumes drawn from European-American depictions of Native American life — all elements that would characterize Michigamua from its origins until the late 20th century.

For inspiration, members of Michigamua&#x27;s founding &quot;tribe&quot; searched the university library for ethnographic research and imaginative literature about indigenous peoples. Many such writings embraced the white image of Native Americans as &quot;noble savages&quot; living in harmony with nature and representing the inherent goodness of human beings untainted by European-American civilization. Other writings emphasized Indians&#x27; supposed courage and fierceness. Both sets of ideas informed Michigamua&#x27;s ethos.

== Symbols and traditions ==
&quot;Playing Indian&quot; formed the core of Michigamua&#x27;s identity. Members took &quot;faux&quot;-Indian nicknames betokening some physical or personal trait (for example, &quot;Heap Chatter&quot; for a talkative member) or activity (&quot;Thunder Arm&quot; for a baseball pitcher). They were expected to use the pidgin English (for example, &quot;me heap big chief&quot;) that had evolved in early transactions between English speakers and Native Americans, then was absorbed and modified in the &quot;western&quot; novels and movies of white popular culture. Linguists called the dialect &quot;Native American Pidgin English&quot; and &quot;Hollywood Injun Pidgin.&quot; It bore little if any relation to the actual languages of Native American nations.

Each cadre elected a &quot;sachem&quot; (president), &quot;sagamore&quot; (vice president), &quot;keeper of the wampum&quot; (treasurer), and &quot;wiskinski&quot; (secretary). Titles were drawn from New York&#x27;s Society of St. Tammany (better known as Tammany Hall) and the Improved Order of Red Men.

Michigamua became well known chiefly through rites of initiation held before crowds of spectators every spring. The event was called &quot;Rope Day.&quot; Junior men chosen as new members —&quot;young bucks&quot; — would be summoned to a central spot on the campus where the senior members — &quot;fighting braves&quot; — wearing &quot;faux&quot;-Indian costumes, with their skin stained red, would tie initiates&#x27; wrists to a long rope, then run them through the campus and subject them to physical ordeals, including being doused with water and smeared with red brick dust.

Hazing on Rope Day varied in severity. One member reported in 1919 that &quot;Rope Day used to be very impressive...unique and picturesque. But it...has degenerated until it has become the worst offender in the way of brutal and barbaric tortures.&quot; Early initiates were often &quot;paddled&quot; — struck repeatedly on the buttocks with a wooden paddle. Later cadres scaled back the ordeals. The smearing of red brick dust on the skin of initiates — an example of &quot;redface&quot; practices, which are widely castigated by Native Americans and others as the equivalent of demeaning &quot;blackface&quot; caricatures of Africans and African-Americans — continued into the post-World War II era.

Michigamua was often called a secret society. That was true in some senses and some periods but not in others. Meetings were private, and in some periods officers&#x27; names were kept confidential. But on Rope Day, members&#x27; identities were obvious to large crowds of spectators, and the student newspaper and yearbook often published members&#x27; names.

== Wigwam ==
Until the early 1920s, members met in fraternities or rooms above stores. Then, for a nominal fee, the Michigan Union (whose top officers often belonged to the &quot;tribe&quot;) permitted Michigamua to meet in the room at the top of the Union tower. (Other student groups, including the honor societies Druids and Vulcans, also rented space in the tower.) In the early 1930s, with the backing of Fielding Yost, then the university&#x27;s powerful athletic director, the Union&#x27;s officers granted Michigamua the right, at its own expense, to decorate its room for its exclusive use. 

In 1933, the renovated space was dedicated; it was known as the wigwam. Decorations included curved birchbark coverings on the walls to simulate the interior shape and textures of a stereotypical wigwam as well as &quot;relics and tokens of the race of redskins from whom the founders of Michigan&#x27;s Tribe took their inspiration,&quot; according to the student newspaper, along with animal pelts and plaques inscribed with names of past members. From 1933 on, the tribe paid no rent for the space.

For members, the wigwam enhanced a sense of inclusion in a rarified order. It was the end point of the ritual of Rope Day, with initiates required to &quot;duck-walk&quot; across the campus and up the seven-story tower to the &quot;wigwam&quot;. (This ritual was photographed for a &quot;Life&quot; magazine feature on Rope Day in 1954.) Later, the room fueled contention, since the tribe enjoyed exclusive, rent-free access and because it housed Native American artifacts.

== Activities ==
Apart from Rope Day, Michigamua&#x27;s activities consisted of weekly meetings to discuss campus affairs; outings and parties with dates; and reunions with alumni members, called &quot;Old Braves.&quot; By informal understanding, the group refrained from any effort, as a body, to exert influence on student politics or university policies, though members often claimed to advance worthy aims as individuals working behind the scenes. The main exception to that reluctance to act as a group occurred in 1903-04 when Michigamua supported plans for a unifying social club for all Michigan men — students, faculty, and alumni alike — partly in response to tensions between undergraduate fraternity members and &quot;independents&quot;. Led by the Michigamua member Edward F. Parker, the campaign established the Michigan Union, one of the earliest such organizations in the U.S., with Parker as its first president. Efforts followed to construct a building to house the organization. Completed in 1919, the Michigan Union building, a campus landmark, housed the Union&#x27;s own offices and those of many other student organizations, including Michigamua, as well as facilities for dining, recreation, social events, and meetings.

== Membership ==
Michigamua&#x27;s first cadres chose their successors chiefly based on popularity and &quot;a reputation for originality and class &#x27;deviltry,&#x27;&quot; all to promote &quot;good class fellowship&quot;. But leadership soon emerged as the key criterion. By 1908, an observer reported the group &quot;aims to draw its members, quite in the manner of the Yale senior societies, from the leaders in all prominent undergraduate activities, studious, social and athletic.&quot; Members made efforts to spread invitations roughly equally among fraternity members and &quot;independents&quot;.

To make up each new cadre, graduating seniors every spring would choose ten successors from the junior class. The following fall, those ten would choose more members (from 10 to as many as 25) to make up the full &quot;tribe&quot; for that year. Later, all new members would be chosen in the spring of their junior year to make up the following year&#x27;s membership, with the total limited to 25.

<doc id="1013152" wikidata="Q559940" url="?curid=1013152" title="Dipsy Selolwane">
<text>Diphetogo &quot;Dipsy&quot; Selolwane (born 27 January 1978) is a Motswana former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. He has also played as a striker in Major League Soccer.

==Club career==
Selolwane first played for Gaborone United in the Botswana Premier League. After playing college soccer at Saint Louis University and being named first-team All-American in 2001, Selolwane was drafted 36th overall in the 2002 MLS Superdraft by the Chicago Fire. Selolwane was traded to Real Salt Lake after the 2004 MLS season but failed to make an impact and was released during the 2005 season. In four years of action in MLS, he scored three goals.

He returned to Africa, first to Botswana and then to the South African Premier Soccer League. His first PSL club was Santos, before moving to Jomo Cosmos, after having a very disappointing 2006–07 season&lt; he signed with &quot;Ezenkosi&quot; for the 2007–08 season, but made only two appearances and joined Ajax Cape Town in early 2008. His PSL career flourished at Ajax, where he was converted to a midfielder and earned a July 2010 move to league champions Supersport United.

==International career==
Selolwane is also a significant player for the Botswana national football team. On 28 January 2012, Selolwane converted a penalty, which temporarily equalised the score in the 1:6 loss against Guinea. This was the first ever goal scored by the national team in a major international tournament.

==Personal life==

Selolwane and actor Marang Molosiwa announced that they were having a child in June 2019. This is Selolwane&#x27;s second child. Dipsy shared a photo of himself and his newly wedded bride in 2021.

<doc id="1013154" wikidata="Q5095601" url="?curid=1013154" title="Chicago Fire (WFL)">
<text>The Chicago Fire was an American football team in the short-lived World Football League for one season, 1974.

==Formation==
The team was founded in late October 1973, with building magnate Thomas Origer becoming the first owner to purchase a WFL franchise, for around $400,000.

Chicago was also the first franchise to sign a player, former Notre Dame and Chicago Bears wide receiver Jim Seymour, and then added quarterback Virgil Carter, who also had played for the NFL&#x27;s Bears as well as the Cincinnati Bengals and San Diego Chargers. Another notable Fire player was punter Chuck Ramsey, who would later go on to play with the New York Jets. Jim Spavital, one-time coach of the Canadian Football League&#x27;s Winnipeg Blue Bombers, piloted the Fire.
The radio announcer for the Fire was former Milwaukee Bucks play-by-play man Eddie Doucette, while ex-Chicago Bears lineman Mike Pyle served as the color commentator. Home games were played at Soldier Field in the Loop area.

==1974 season==
Fittingly, the Fire started out hot, winning their first four games and seven of their first nine. Chicago also drew decent-sized crowds to Soldier Field, with an average attendance of 33,858 at their first five home contests. After Virgil Carter threw four touchdown passes in a 32-22 road win over Southern California, the Fire were 7-2 and competitive in the WFL&#x27;s Central Division, which contained the loop&#x27;s two strongest teams in Birmingham (9-0) and Memphis (also 7-2). However, it turned out to be the last game the Fire would ever win, as a rash of injuries triggered a 10-game losing streak. Crowds also began to dwindle, as barely 20,000 showed up to watch the Fire&#x27;s last home game, a 60-17 rout by the Hawaiians, the most points ever scored by one team in a WFL game. 

By late October, Fire owner Origer had had enough. Fed up by the team&#x27;s collapse (as well as bankrupt), Origer said at an emergency meeting in Chicago on October 29 that his club would pull out of the WFL (with three games left in the schedule) if league commissioner Gary Davidson was not fired. Davidson quit, but two weeks later Origer still refused to fly the team to Philadelphia for Chicago&#x27;s final game, forfeiting the contest and giving the Fire a final record of 7-13. Soon after, the club disbanded.

==Legacy==
In 1975, the WFL tried again in the Windy City with the Chicago Winds, who attempted to sign legendary quarterback Joe Namath. But Namath stayed in the NFL, and the Winds were disbanded after just five games (including one game at Soldier Field that drew a crowd of 3,470). The World Football League followed suit a few months later, passing into history.

In 1981, another Chicago Fire club played in the minor-league American Football Association. Led by running back Billy Marek, the new Fire also played at Soldier Field, albeit in front of small crowds: the biggest attendance of the year was estimated at 8,500. Chicago did have a successful season on the field, winning the AFA&#x27;s Western Division with a 8-4 record. In the playoffs, Chicago knocked off Jacksonville, 24-17, in front of 5,000 at Soldier Field, then played in the league championship game, a 29-21 road loss to the West Virginia Rockets on August 30, 1981. They even managed to get one of their games on local television: WGN-TV, scrambling for summer sports programming during the baseball strike, broadcast a Fire game from Soldier Field on June 27, 1981. (Although ratings were higher than that of the Chicago Sting soccer team on WGN, station officials declined to carry any more Fire games.) Financial losses, and the formation of the bigger-budget USFL in 1982, put the Fire out for good.

Chicago&#x27;s current professional soccer team, founded in 1997, also is named the Fire.

<text>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID, ) is one of the 27 institutes and centers that make up the National Institutes of Health (NIH), an agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). NIAID&#x27;s mission is to conduct basic and applied research to better understand, treat, and prevent infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases.

NIAID has on-campus laboratories in Maryland and Hamilton, Montana, and funds research conducted by scientists at institutions in the United States and throughout the world. NIAID also works closely with partners in academia, industry, government, and non-governmental organizations in multifaceted and multidisciplinary efforts to address emerging health challenges such as the H1N1/09 pandemic and the COVID-19 pandemic.

==History==

NIAID traces its origins to a small laboratory established in 1887 at the Marine Hospital on Staten Island, New York (now the Bayley Seton Hospital). Officials of the Marine Hospital Service in New York decided to open a research laboratory to study the link between microscopic organisms and infectious diseases. Joseph J. Kinyoun, a medical officer with the Marine Hospital Service, was selected to create this laboratory, which he called a &quot;laboratory of hygiene.&quot;

Kinyoun&#x27;s lab was renamed the Hygienic Laboratory in 1891 and moved to Washington, D.C., where Congress authorized it to investigate &quot;infectious and contagious diseases and matters pertaining to the public health.&quot; With the passage of the Ransdell Act in 1930, the Hygienic Laboratory became the National Institute of Health. In 1937, the Rocky Mountain Laboratory, then part of the United States Public Health Service, was transferred to Division of Infectious Diseases, part of the NIH.

In mid-1948, the National Institute of Health became the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with the creation of four new institutes. On October 8, 1948, the Rocky Mountain Laboratory and the Biologics Control Laboratory were joined with the NIH Division of Infectious Diseases and Division of Tropical Diseases to form the National Microbiological Institute. In 1955, Congress changed the name of the National Microbiological Institute to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to reflect the inclusion of allergy and immunology research. That change became effective on December 29, 1955.

===List of directors===
The following have been directors of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases:


==Organizational structure==
NIAID is composed of the Office of the Director (OD), four extramural divisions:
# Division of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (DAIDS)
# Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT)
# Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID)
# Division of Extramural Activities (DEA)

and three intramural divisions:
# Division of Clinical Research (DCR)
# Division of Intramural Research (DIR)
# Vaccine Research Center (VRC)

The Dale and Betty Bumpers Vaccine Research Center is composed of four laboratories and two programs:
* Immunology Laboratory
* Viral Pathogenesis Laboratory
* Virology Laboratory
* Vaccine Production Program Laboratory
* Clinical Trials Program
* Translational Research Program

==Research priorities==
NIAID&#x27;s research priorities are focused on:

# &quot;expanding the breadth and depth of knowledge in all areas of infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases&quot;
# &quot;developing flexible domestic and international research capacities to respond appropriately to emerging and re-emerging disease threats wherever they may occur.&quot;

NIAID&#x27;s mission areas are:

; Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS)
: The goals in this area are finding a cure for HIV-infected individuals; developing preventive strategies, including vaccines and treatment as prevention; developing therapeutic strategies for preventing and treating co-infections such as TB and hepatitis C in HIV-infected individuals; and addressing the long-term consequences of HIV treatment.
; Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases (BioD)
: The goals of this mission area are to better understand how these deliberately emerging (i.e., intentionally caused) and naturally emerging infectious agents cause disease and how the immune system responds to them.
; Infectious and Immunologic Diseases (IID)
: The goal of this mission area is to understand how aberrant responses of the immune system play a critical role in the development of immune-related disorders such as asthma, allergies, autoimmune diseases, and transplant rejection. This research helps improve the understanding of how the immune system functions when it is healthy or unhealthy and provides the basis for development of new diagnostic tools and interventions for immune-related diseases.

==Achievements==

NIAID has established a reputation for being on the cutting edge of scientific progress both through its intramural labs and through the research it funds at academic institutions. For example, NIAID collaborations with various partners led to the development of FDA-approved vaccines for influenza (FluMist), hepatitis A (Havrix), and rotavirus (RotaShield).
NIAID also was instrumental in the development and licensure of acellular pertussis vaccines, conjugate vaccines for &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; and &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; type b or Hib, and a preventive therapy for respiratory syncytial virus or RSV (Synagis). Additionally, NIAID partnerships with industry and academia have led to the advancement of diagnostic tests for several important infectious diseases, including malaria (ParaSight F), tuberculosis (GeneXpert MTB/RIF), and norovirus (Ridascreen Norovirus 3rd Generation EIA).

NIAID has done research on mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV. In 1994, a study co-sponsored by NIAID demonstrated that the drug AZT, given to HIV-infected women who had little or no prior antiretroviral therapy (ART), reduced the risk of MTCT by two-thirds.

In 1999, an NIAID-funded study in Uganda found that two oral doses of the inexpensive drug nevirapine—one given to HIV-infected mothers at the onset of labor and another to their infants soon after birth—reduced MTCT by half when compared with a similar course of AZT. Subsequent clinical trials, including some funded by NIAID, showed that AIDS drugs also can reduce the risk of MTCT through breast milk. These and other studies have led to World Health Organization recommendations that can help prevent MTCT while allowing women in resource-limited settings to breastfeed their infants safely.

More recently, NIAID-funded scientists found that testing at-risk infants for HIV and then giving ART immediately to those who test positive dramatically reduces rates of illness and death. HIV-infected infants were four times less likely to die if given ART immediately after they were diagnosed with HIV, when compared with the standard of care (beginning ART in infants when they showed signs of HIV illness or a weakened immune system).

This finding helped influence the World Health Organization (WHO) to change its guidelines for treating HIV-infected infants. The guidelines now strongly recommend starting ART in all children under age 2 immediately after they have been diagnosed with HIV, regardless of their health status.
In 2020, the NIAID Office of Communications &amp; Government Relations&#x27; News &amp; Science Writing Branch published an &quot;HIV Language Guide&quot;, &quot;designed to help NIAID staff communicate with empowering rather than stigmatizing language&quot; and it was quickly recognized that it has value beyond NIAID. A draft of the 2024 update was widely circulated, to incorporate feedback from community groups and was published in April 2024 using person-first language, but was removed from the NIAID website shortly after the second inauguration of Donald Trump in January 2025, with some commentators suggesting this is as a result of language in the guide around transgender and gender nonconforming people being in contravention of President Trump&#x27;s executive order &quot;Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government&quot;.

In 2023, NIAID Office of Data Science and Emerging Technologies (ODSET) created the NIAID Data Discovery Portal to enhance the reuse of data and enable faster development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. The NIAID Data Discovery Portal focuses on the findability of data, aggregating resources across numerous sources, including NIAID-supported repositories and general biomedical repositories.

==Clinical training programs==

NIAID offers three-year fellowships for medical trainees in allergy/immunology and infectious diseases. These Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited fellowships provide intensive clinical training and research mentorship in clinical and basic science laboratories. Both NIAID fellowship training programs include one full year of clinical responsibilities including two or three months of the first year caring for patients at the NIH Clinical Center, the nation&#x27;s largest hospital devoted to clinical research. The subsequent two years are dedicated to research.

===Allergy and immunology===

The Allergy and Immunology Clinical Fellowship Program is open to physicians who are on track to complete an approved internal medicine or pediatric medicine residency program. Fellows are eligible to sit for the Board of Allergy and Immunology certification examination after two years. Kelly Stone is the director of the fellowship training program.

===Infectious diseases===

The Infectious Diseases Fellowship Program is open to physicians who have completed three years of an internal medicine residency program in the United States or Canada. Fellows are eligible to sit for the ABIM Infectious Disease certification examination after two years. Christa Zerbe is currently the program director for the Infectious Diseases Fellowship Program.

<doc id="1013156" wikidata="Q3776662" url="?curid=1013156" title="Pindari Glacier">
<text>The Pindari Glacier is a glacier found in the upper reaches of the Kumaon Himalayas, to the southeast of Nanda Devi and Nanda Kot.

== Geography ==
The glacier is about 9 kilometers long and gives rise to the Pindar River which meets the Alakananda at Karnaprayag in the Garhwal district.

The trail to reach the glacier crosses the villages of Saung, Loharkhet, crosses over the Dhakuri Pass, continues onto Khati village (the last inhabited village on the trail), Dwali, Phurkia and finally Zero Point, Pindar, the end of the trail. Though most of the trail is along the banks of the Pindari River, the river is mostly hidden until after Khati.

The Pindari Glacier trail provides for a round-trip trek that most people find comfortable to complete in 6 days. The Pindari Glacier is also famous for other adventure sports like Ice climbing and Mountain biking.

==Retreat==

Several surveys have mapped the retreat of Pindari over the years. The glacier was first surveyed by G.de P.Cotter in 1906. A 1958 survey by Amber P Tiwari and Jangpangi in connection with International Geophysical Year, recorded a retreat of in the fifty two years since 1906. A 1966 survey recorded a further retreat of and discovered that a branch of the glacier, the Chhanguch branch, had separated and formed a separate ice shelf. As a result of the separation, the glacier lost several thousand cubic meters of ice. Recent studies have shown that the glacier has retreated an additional 1,569.01 meters between 1976 and 2014, possibly because of climate change.
This accelerating retreat, along with the retreat of other Himalayan glaciers, is likely to have an adverse impact on agriculture in the entire Ganges region since the Pindar river feeds the Alaknanda river, a headstream of the Ganges.

<doc id="1013159" wikidata="Q1418353" url="?curid=1013159" title="Multidimensional analysis">
<text>In statistics, econometrics and related fields, multidimensional analysis (MDA) is a data analysis process that groups data into two categories: data dimensions and measurements. For example, a data set consisting of the number of wins for a single football team at each of several years is a single-dimensional (in this case, longitudinal) data set. A data set consisting of the number of wins for several football teams in a single year is also a single-dimensional (in this case, cross-sectional) data set. A data set consisting of the number of wins for several football teams over several years is a two-dimensional data set.

==Higher dimensions==
In many disciplines, two-dimensional data sets are also called panel data. While, strictly speaking, two- and higher-dimensional data sets are &quot;multi-dimensional&quot;, the term &quot;multidimensional&quot; tends to be applied only to data sets with three or more dimensions. For example, some forecast data sets provide forecasts for multiple target periods, conducted by multiple forecasters, and made at multiple horizons. The three dimensions provide more information than can be gleaned from two-dimensional panel data sets.

==Software==
Computer software for MDA include Online analytical processing (OLAP) for data in relational databases, pivot tables for data in spreadsheets, and Array DBMSs for general multi-dimensional data (such as raster data) in science, engineering, and business.

<doc id="1013166" wikidata="Q5304281" url="?curid=1013166" title="Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School">
<text>Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School is a secondary school located at 1410 County Line Road in Ives Estates, an unincorporated area of north Miami-Dade County (Miami address), Florida, US. However, it serves the city of Aventura, northern fringes of North Miami Beach, and the unincorporated areas around the school such as Ives Estates/California Club and Ojus. The school is located on the Miami-Dade side of the Miami-Dade-Broward County line, and is the northernmost high school in the district. Lee Krueger currently serves as principal.

Krop is considered to be a magnet school because it has a &quot;Students Training in the Arts Repertory (STAR)&quot; program. This magnet program is a visual and performing arts program that is open to students in the greater Miami area. Due to the recession of 2008 and ongoing financial issues, the STAR program has had severe cuts in its funding.

The school gained national attention after one of its students, Trayvon Martin, was killed in a controversial shooting.

==History==
Built on a former landfill, construction for Dr. Michael M. Krop High School began in 1996, after the Miami-Dade School Board approved plans to build a new high school in North Miami-Dade County to lessen overcrowding in local secondary schools, including North Miami Beach High School. Various secondary schools in northeast Dade were relieved by Krop. When it first opened it had about 1,500 students. Opening its doors in 1998, Krop began with 9th and 10th grades and eventually added 11th and 12th grades; its first graduating class was the class of 2001. At the time of its opening, Krop had a total enrollment of 1,475 students.

In early 1998, before its opening, the naming of the school some controversy, as letters from members of the community indicated a preference for a more generic name. The school is named after Michael M. Krop (1930-2018), an orthodontist who was first elected to the Miami-Dade School Board in 1980. He retired from the board in 2004, after 24 years of service. Former board members Janet McAliley and Betsy Kaplan stated that they would not support renaming the school after him. On February 17, 1998, the city council of Aventura issued a resolution urging the Miami-Dade County school board to name the new high school in northeast Miami-Dade County &quot;Dr. Michael M. Krop High School.&quot; The Aventura Marketing Council, which included Krop as a member, and the city of North Miami Beach, also passed resolutions favoring the name change.

When Alonzo and Tracy Mourning Senior High Biscayne Bay Campus opened in 2009, it relieved Krop High. Golden Beach, Sunny Isles Beach, and portions of North Miami Beach were rezoned to Mourning from Krop.

In 2012, even though Krop had a strong academic reputation, some parents in the Aventura area promoted the idea of the city starting a public high school. At the time city council refused to go forward with the idea. However, by 2019 Aventura opened a new charter high school, Don Soffer Aventura High School. Colleen Wright of the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; stated that the new school could take students who would otherwise attend Krop.

For a period Krop was overcrowded, but by 2019 the building was at 86% capacity as the school had 2,400 students. In 2019, Wright wrote &quot;Krop’s star power has waned with the opening of other high school options, including Alonzo and Tracy Mourning High School and MAST&quot;.

==Campus==
The school, in Ives Estates, is in proximity to the Miami-Dade County-Broward County line. Audra D.S. Burch and Carol Isensee of the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; described the campus as &quot;sprawling&quot;.

In 1998 the north side of the campus had barbed wire. At the time of opening the area roads were dead-ends.

==STAR Academy==
The STAR Academy is a performing and visual arts program that engenders Krop as a magnet school. Students in the &quot;Students Training in the Arts Repertory (STAR)&quot; program are involved in one or more of its six strands - dance, drama, vocal and instrumental music, visual arts, and television production. Students are accepted into the program through an audition process. Two of the six classes out of a student&#x27;s yearly class schedule are dedicated to the arts each year.

==&quot;The Lightning Strike&quot;==
&quot;The Lightning Strike&quot; is Krop&#x27;s monthly student newspaper.

The newspaper was begun in 1998, when the school opened. It is designed using the page layout software Adobe InDesign and photo editing program Adobe Photoshop.

As of the 2005–2006 school year, the paper was converted to color on the front, middle and back, and is 20 pages each issue.

The newspaper is a member of the High School National Ad Network, Florida Scholastic Press Association, National Scholastic Press Association, Columbia Scholastic Press Association, and Quill and Scroll Honor Society.

<doc id="1013167" wikidata="Q2299057" url="?curid=1013167" title="Kumaon division">
<text>Kumaon (; , ; historically romanised as Kemāon) is a revenue and administrative division in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. It spans over the eastern half of the state and is bounded on the north by Tibet, on the east by Nepal, on the south by the state of Uttar Pradesh, and on the west by Garhwal. Kumaon comprises six districts of the state: Almora, Bageshwar, Champawat, Nainital, Pithoragarh and Udham Singh Nagar.

Historically known as Manaskhand and then Kurmanchal, the Kumaon region has been ruled by several dynasties over the course of history; most notably the Katyuris and the Chands. The Kumaon division was established in 1816, when the British reclaimed this region from the Gorkhas, who had annexed the erstwhile Kingdom of Kumaon in 1790. It was formed into a division of what was then called Ceded and Conquered Provinces, later known as United Provinces. In independent India the state was called Uttar Pradesh. In 2000, the new state of Uttarakhand was carved out of Uttar Pradesh, including Kumaon.

The people of Kumaon are known as Kumaonis and speak the Kumaoni language. Kumaon is home to a famous Indian Army regiment, the Kumaon Regiment. The hill town Nainital is its administrative centre and this is where the Uttarakhand high court is located. Other notable hill towns of Kumaon are Almora, Ranikhet, Pithoragarh, Champawat and Bageshwar. However, all the major cities of the region like Haldwani, Rudrapur, Kashipur,Ramnagar and Tanakpur are concentrated in the southern plain areas of Bhabar and Terai.

== Etymology ==
Kumaon is believed to have been derived from &quot;Kurmanchal&quot;, meaning the land of Kurma (the tortoise avatar of Vishnu, the preserver deity in Hinduism).

According to another theory, the word Kumaon can be traced back to the 5th century BC. The &quot;Kassite Assyrians&quot; left their homeland Kummah, on the banks of river Euphrates, and settled in the northern part of India.

During this time of the British control of the region, between 1815 and 1857, it was also known as &quot;Kemaon&quot;.

== Geography ==

The Kumaon region consists of a large Himalayan tract, together with two strips called the Terai and the Bhabar. The submontane strips were up to 1850 an almost impenetrable forest, given up to wild animals; but after 1850 the numerous clearings attracted a large population from the hills, who cultivated the rich soil during the hot and cold seasons, returning to the hills in the rains. The rest of Kumaon is a maze of mountains, part of the Himalaya range, some of which are among the loftiest known. In a tract not more than 225 km in length and 65 km in breadth there are over thirty peaks rising to elevations exceeding 5500 m.
Rivers such as Gori, Dhauli, and Kali rise chiefly in the southern slope of the Tibetan watershed north of the loftiest peaks, amongst which they make their way down valleys of rapid declivity and extraordinary depth. The principal is the Sharda (Kali Ganga), the Pindari and Kailganga, whose waters join the Alaknanda. The river Sharda (Kali Ganga) forms the international boundary between India and Nepal. The pilgrim route currently used to visit Kailash-Mansarovar goes along this river and crosses into Tibet at Lipu Lekh pass.

The chief trees are the chir pine, Himalayan cypress, pindrow fir, alder, sal and saindan. Limestone, sandstone, slate, gneiss and granite constitute the principal geological formations. Mines of iron, copper, gypsum, lead and asbestos exist, but they are not thoroughly worked. Except in the submontane strips and deep valleys, the climate is mild. The rainfall of the outer Himalayan range, which is first struck by the monsoon, is double that of the central hills, in the average proportion of 2000 mm to 1000 mm. No winter passes without snow on the higher ridges, and in some years, it is universal throughout the mountain tract. Frosts, especially in the valleys, are often severe.

==History==
Prehistoric dwellings and Stone Age implements have been discovered in Almora and Nainital districts. Initially settled by Kol tribals, the region witnessed successive waves of Kiratas, Khasas and Indo-Scythians. Kunindas were the first rulers of the region. They were followed by the Katyuri kings of Khasha origin who controlled the region from 700 to 1200 AD.

Around 1100–1200 AD, after Katyuri kingdom disintegration, Kurmanchal was divided into eight different principalities: Baijnath-Katyur, Dwarhat, Doti, Baramandal, Askot, Sira, Sora, Sui. Around 1581 AD, under Rudra Chand, the whole region was brought together again as Kumaon.

===Kumaon Kingdom===
===Katyuri Raj===
The Katyuri dynasty was a ruling Hindu dynasty of Khasha origin and was founded by Vashudev Katyuri. they established their kingdom and called it Kurmanchal kingdom, they dominated lands of varying extent from the &#x27;Katyur&#x27; (modern day Baijnath) valley in Kumaon, between 7th and 11th centuries AD, and established their capital at Baijnath in Bageshwar district, which was then known as Kartikeyapura and lies in the centre of &#x27;Katyur&#x27; valley. Brahmadev mandi in Kanchanpur District of far western Nepal was established by Katyuri king Brahma Deo, At their peak, the kurmanchal kingdom of Katyuri kings was extended from Sikkim in the east to Kabul, Afghanistan in the west, before fragmenting into numerous principalities by the 12th century.

It is believed that from king Dham Deo and Bir Deo the downfall of this powerful dynasty began. Birdeo used to collect heavy taxes and forced his people to work as his slaves, King Birdeo teased his subjects by his tyranny to the extent that he forcibly married his own maternal aunt Tila. It is said that the Kumaoni folk song &quot;Mami tile dharo bola&quot; became popular from that very day. after death of Birdeo the kingdom was divided between his eight sons and they were able to form their different small kingdoms in the region for a short period of time until Chands emerged in the region defeating most of katyuri principalities and united &quot;Kurmanchal&quot; again as Kumaon.

The Rajwar dynasty of Askot in Pithoragarh, was set up in 1279 AD, by a branch of the Katyuri kings, headed by Abhay Pal Deo, who was the grandson of Katyuri king Brahma Deo. The dynasty ruled the region until it became part of the British Raj through the treaty of Sighauli in 1816.

===Chand Raj===
The Chand dynasty was established by Som Chand in the 10th century, by displacing the Katyuri Kings, who had been ruling the area from the 7th century AD. He continued to call his state Kurmanchal and established its capital in Champawat in Kali Kumaon called so, due to its vicinity to river Kali. Many temples built in this former capital city, during the 11th and 12th century exist today, this includes the Baleshwar and Nagnath temples.
One of the most powerful rulers of Chand dynasty was Baz Bahadur (1638–78) AD, who met Shahjahan in Delhi, and in 1655 joined forces with him to attack Garhwal, which was then under the King Pirthi Sah. Baz Bahadur subsequently captured the Terai region including Dehradun, which was thus separated from the Garhwal kingdom. Baz Bahadur extended his territory east to Karnali river, later Baz Bahadur invaded Tibet and captured several forts including a Hindu pilgrim Kailash Manasarovar. he also built the Golu Devata Temple, at Ghorakhal, near Bhimtal, after Lord Golu, a general in his army, who died valiantly in battle. He also built the famous Bhimeshwara Mahadev Temple at Bhimtal.

Towards the end of the 17th century, Chand kings again attacked the Garhwal kingdom, and in 1688, Udyot Chand erected several temples at Almora, including Tripur Sundari, Udyot Chandeshwar, and Parbateshwar. To mark his victory over Garhwal and Doti, the Parbateshwar temple was renamed twice, to become the present Nanda Devi temple. Later, Jagat Chand (1708–20), defeated the Raja of Garhwal and pushed him away from Srinagar (in Uttarakhand, not to be confused with the capital of present-day Indian Kashmir), and his kingdom was given to a Brahmin.

===Nepalese invasion and its defeat===
In the latter half of the 18th century, the power of Kumaon was on decline, as the king Mahendra Chand was unable to properly administer the country. After the fall of Doti, the Gorkhas decided to invade over Kumaon. The Gorkha forces, under the leadership of Amar Singh Thapa crossed the kali river, and reached the outskirts of Almora via Sor and Gangoli. After facing tough resistance by King Mahendra Chand&#x27;s uncle who was leading the army, and retreating temporarily, the Gorkha&#x27;s returned again and in the ensuing battle Mahendra Chand&#x27;s uncle was killed. Hearing about his uncle&#x27;s death, Mahendra Chandra became frightened and fled to the plains, and Kumaon was annexed to the Gorkha Kingdom.

The Gorkha rule over Kumaon lasted for 24 years. The only architectural advancements during the period was a road connecting kali river to Srinagar via Almora. The Gorkha rule over Kumaon is said to have been cruel and barbaric. The Gorkha&#x27;s only thought of Kumaon and Garwhal (which was conquered some years after the invasion of Kumaon) as frontier states and so proper administration was not practiced. Many Kumaoni people were sold to slavery by Gorkha administrators in Kumaon, who were often left unsupervised by the primary Gorkha leadership. Almora was the largest town of Kumaon during the Gorkha period, and is estimated to have about 1000 houses.

After the Gorkhas started meddling in the territories of Oudh, the Nawab of Oudh, who was then a suzerain of the British Empire, asked for their help, thus paving way for the Anglo-Nepalese War of 1814. The British forces under Colonel Nicholas, consisting of about forty five hundred men and six pounder guns, entered Kumaon through Kashipur and conquered Almora on 26 April 1815. On the same day, Chandra Bahadur Shah, one of the principle Gurkha chiefs, sent a flag of truce, requesting to end hostilities in the region. A negotiation was brought up the following day, under which the Gurkhas agreed to leave the Country, and all its fortified places. The war ended with Nepal signing the Treaty of Sugauli in 1816, under which, Kumaon officially became a British territory.

===British Raj===

Later, the region was annexed by the British. In 1815 the Kumaon region was joined with the eastern half of the Garhwal region as a chief-commissionership on the non-regulation system, also known as the Kumaon Province. It was governed for seventy years by three administrators, Mr. Traill, Mr. J. H. Batten and Sir Henry Ramsay.

There was widespread opposition against British rule in various parts of Kumaon. The Kumaoni people especially Champawat District rose in rebellion against the British during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 under the leadership of the members like Kalu Singh Mahara. In 1891 the division was composed of the three districts of Kumaon, Garhwal and the Tarai; but the two districts of Kumaon and the Tarai were subsequently redistributed and renamed after their headquarters, Nainital and Almora.

The area received international attention after the publication of Man-Eaters of Kumaon, by Jim Corbett, the noted hunter and conservationist, describing the author&#x27;s trials seeking out and killing man-eating tigers. Animals like the Champawat Tiger and the Chowgarh Tigers plagued the area for many years, with the former estimated to have killed over four hundred humans by herself, in Nepal and then Kumaon, in the years 1920–28.

Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s advent sounded a death knell for the British in Kumaon. People now aware of the excesses of British Raj became defiant of it and played an active part in the Indian Struggle for Independence. While staying in Kumaon for 12 days, recovering from the rigors of imprisonment, Gandhi wrote &quot;Anashakti Yoga&quot;, his commentary on the Gita.

Gandhi was revered in these parts and on his call the struggle of Salam Saliya Satyagraha led by Ram Singh Dhoni was started which shook the very roots of British rule in Kumaon.
Many people died in the Saalam Satyagraha due to police brutality. Gandhi named it the &quot;Bardoli of Kumaon&quot; an allusion to the Bardoli Satyagrah. Many Kumaonis also joined the Indian National Army led by Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.

=== Independent India ===
After India became independent in 1947, United Provinces were converted into the newly formed Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. The princely state of Tehri Garhwal joined the Indian Union in 1949, and became a district under the Kumaon division. Three new districts viz. Pithoragarh from Almora, Chamoli from Garhwal and Uttarkashi from Tehri Garhwal were created in 1960. A new revenue division, named Uttarakhand division was carved out from these 3 districts of Kumaon division.

The year 1969 saw major administrative reforms in these hilly regions of Uttar Pradesh, and a new Garhwal division, with its headquarter in Pauri, was formed with the districts of Tehri Garhwal and Garhwal from Kumaon division, and Uttarkashi and Chamoli from Uttarakhand division. The Uttarakhand division too was disestablished the same year, and the remaining district of Pithoragarh was brought back to Kumaon division, hence giving it its present size.

Three new districts were created in the 90&#x27;s, taking the total number of districts in the division to 6. Udham singh nagar from Nainital in 1995, and Bageshwar from Almora and Champawat from Pithoragarh in 1997. Two new districts, Ranikhet from Almora and Didihat from Pithoragarh were announced in 2011 by the then Chief minister of Uttarakhand, Ramesh Pokhriyal, but the districts never came into existence because no official notification was ever released.

==Culture==
===Traditional attire===

Pichaura (पिछोङा) is a traditional attire worn by married Kumaoni women generally for religious occasions, marriage, and other rituals. Traditionally handmade using vegetable dyes, Pichhauras are available in red and saffron. Local designs made in Almora, Haldwani and other parts of Kumaon use silk fabric and accessories made of pearl. It is also contemporarily made using machines. In recent years its popularity has seen a rise, especially in Kumaoni diaspora in other states and countries.

Kumaoni men do wear a Kumaoni cap, which is of black colour. However, during festivals, especially during Kumauni Holi the cap becomes white in colour.

===Folk Art===
Aipan is the most famous folk art of Kumaon. In recent times its popularity has grown. 
Aipan is not only an important folk art of Kumaoni community but other ethnic groups of Kumaon, like Shaukas and Rungs, as well. Hence it also acts as a cultural link between different ethnic communities of Kumaon, therefore has significant importance.

===Folk dances===
Many classical dance forms and folk art are practised in the Kumaon. Some well-known dances include Hurkiya Baul, Jhora-Chanchri and Chholiya. Music is an integral part of the Kumaoni culture. Popular types of folk songs include Mangal and Nyoli. These folk songs are played on instruments including dhol, damau, turri, ransingha, dholki, daur, thali, bhankora, mandan and mashakbaja. A famous Kumaoni folk is Bedu Pako Baro Masa. Music is also used as a medium through which the gods are invoked. &quot;Jagar&quot; is a form of spirit worship in which the singer, or &quot;Jagariya&quot;, sings a ballad of the gods, with allusions to great epics, like Mahabharat and Ramayana, that describe the adventures and exploits of the god being invoked.

Kumaoni Ram Leela is the oldest in the world. It is 150-year-old, due to which UNESCO has declared it world&#x27;s longest-running opera. In addition, the Kumaoni Ram Leela is now a part of the World Cultural Heritage List. With the passage of time, people have experimented with the show, yet the oral traditional has stayed as it always was. This is to say that the Ram Leela in Kumaon is not a staged performance; rather, it is a musical fest, which is made special by the beats of instruments like harmonium, dholak and table. In Kumaon&#x27;s Ram Leela, the focus is more on singing than acting.

Kumaoni holi is the historical and cultural celebration of the Hindu festival of Holi. It is one of the most important festivals for the Kumauni people as it signifies not only the victory of good over evil but also end of the winter season and the start of the new sowing season which holds great importance for this agricultural community of the North Indian Himalayas. It is an amalgamation of the cultural traditions of North India and the local traditions of Kumaon. The uniqueness of the Kumaoni Holi lies in its being a musical affair, whatever its form, be it the Baithki Holi, the Khari Holi and the Mahila Holi all of which start from Basant Panchmi. 
This results in the festivities of Holi lasting for almost two months in Kumaon. The Baithki Holi and Khari Holi are unique in that the songs on which they are based have a combination of melody, fun, and spiritualism. These songs are essentially based on classical ragas. Baithki Holi is also known as Nirvan Ki Holi or Holi of Salvation.

<doc id="1013168" wikidata="Q4646042" url="?curid=1013168" title="95th United States Congress">
<text>The 95th United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, composed of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. It met in Washington, D.C., from January 3, 1977, to January 3, 1979, during the final weeks of Gerald Ford&#x27;s presidency and the first two years of Jimmy Carter&#x27;s presidency.

The apportionment of seats in this House of Representatives was based on the 1970 United States census. Both chambers maintained a Democratic supermajority, and with Jimmy Carter being sworn in as president on January 20, 1977, this gave the Democrats an overall federal government trifecta for the first time since the 90th Congress ending in 1969.

, this was the most recent Congress to approve an amendment (the unratified District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment) to the Constitution. This is the last time the Democratic Party or any political party held a 2/3 supermajority in the House.

This is the last congress to at any point have no female senators (from its beginning, January 3, 1977, until the swearing-in of Muriel Humphrey (D-MN) on January 25, 1978; and again from the departure of both Humphrey and Maryon Allen (D-AL) on November 7, 1978, to the early swearing-in of Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS) on December 23, 1978).

===House of Representatives===
Members of the House of Representatives elected statewide &quot;at-large&quot;, are preceded by &quot;At-large&quot;, and the names of those elected from districts, are preceded by their district numbers.

Many of the congressional district numbers are linked to articles describing the district itself. Since the boundaries of the districts have changed often and substantially, the linked article may only describe the district as it exists today, and not as it was at the time of this Congress.

<text>Michael M. Krop (July 21, 1930 – July 31, 2018) was an American orthodontist from Florida who served as an elected member of the board of education of the Miami-Dade County Public Schools, which oversaw what was then the fourth largest school system in the United States, for 24 years, from 1980 to 2004. By the time Krop&#x27;s service to the School Board ended, it oversaw over 360,000 students and a $4.3 billion annual budget.

==Early life, education, and career==
Born in Pennsylvania, Krop was raised in Pottsville, and received an undergraduate degree from Pennsylvania State University in 1952, and a D.D.S. from the dental school at Temple University in 1956. He served as a dentist in the United States Army for two years, and then attended the orthodontics program at Northwestern University. In 1960, he moved to Miami and entered into private practice there.

==Political activities==
In 1980 Krop ran as a reform candidate, besting four opponents to win his seat. He initially took up mundane, relatively non-controversial issues, seeking increased homework loads for a student population he believed to be underchallenged, and pushing for measures to reduce a rising trend of violence in schools. In November 1987, Krop won a rare unanimous vote to chair the School Board in a special election by the Board, and was reaffirmed in that position the following year.

Krop was elected to chair the School Board four times. This position allowed him to advocate strongly for the needs of minority students, particularly among newly arriving immigrant populations. When the school system was overwhelmed by the immigration of Nicaraguan refugees in 1988-1989, Krop led efforts to address the crisis, and called upon the federal government to provide aid. He also sought to bring greater public exposure to the School Board, initiating &quot;gavel to gavel&quot; television coverage of School Board meetings.

In 1998, Dr. Michael M. Krop High School was named for him. The event triggered some controversy, as some members of the community preferred other names. Former board members Janet McAliley and Betsy Kaplan accused Krop of lobbying to have the school named for him on separate occasions, a charge which Krop denied.

Krop was a stalwart Democrat throughout his service, but the School Board gradually shifted to a more conservative composition. When Krop was first elected, the Board had been entirely composed of Democrats for twenty years. By the end of his tenure, the Board had become a majority-Republican body, but Krop&#x27;s colleagues continued to support his leadership. At the time of Krop&#x27;s retirement from public office, he was the longest-serving elected official in Miami-Dade County.

==Personal life and death==

Krop married Lois, with whom he had two sons and two daughters. He died on July 31, 2018, aged 88.

<text>Charles William Donaldson (4 January 1935 – 22 June 2005) was a British satirist, writer, playboy and, under the pseudonym of Henry Root, author of &quot;The Henry Root Letters&quot;.

==Life and career==
Son of Charles Glen Donaldson (1904–1956) and Elizabeth (née Stockley; d. 1955), Donaldson enjoyed a privileged upbringing in Sunningdale, Berkshire. His father was Managing Director of the Glasgow-based family shipping line, Donaldson Line, which until its sale in the early 1960s, was one of the largest passenger lines in the world. He was educated at Winchester College (where he first met Julian Mitchell) and Magdalene College, Cambridge. He spent some money supporting young writers such as his contemporaries Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath. He completed his National Service in the Royal Navy in the late 1950s, reaching the rank of Sub-Lieutenant.

On his return to civilian life, Donaldson became associated with the set surrounding Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon, and worked as a theatrical producer. He established himself as a central player in the British satire boom of the early 1960s, as co-producer, with Donald Albery, of &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot; (1960), and of dramatisations of J. P. Donleavy&#x27;s &quot;The Ginger Man&quot; (1959) and Spike Milligan&#x27;s &quot;The Bed-Sitting Room&quot; (1963). The pair earned a weekly £2,000 from &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot; while the performers Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Alan Bennett and Jonathan Miller were earning only £75.

In 1968, Donaldson received a substantial inheritance, and in 1971 he left Britain for Ibiza, where he imprudently spent his last £2,000 on a glass-bottomed boat. Before long he was scavenging for food on the beach. Returning to London, he found refuge with a former girlfriend who was running a brothel on the Fulham Road. His experiences there formed the basis of his first novel, &quot;Both the Ladies and the Gentlemen&quot; (1975).

Donaldson&#x27;s fictional letter-writer Henry Root made him a final fortune. Root&#x27;s satirical lampooning of the rich, famous, and influential was published in the books:
*&quot;The Henry Root Letters&quot; (1980) – with letters to, among others, famous football clubs, publishers, chief constables, Margaret Thatcher, politicians, newspaper editors, and, on 17 April 1979, to the First Sea Lord (volunteering his services owing to the &quot;imminent outbreak of hostilities with the Soviets&quot; and concluding &quot;I&#x27;m on red alert here and can leave for my ship at the drop of a bollard&quot;)
*&quot;The Further Letters of Henry Root&quot; (1980)
*&quot;Henry Root&#x27;s World of Knowledge&quot; (1982)
*&quot;Henry Root&#x27;s A-Z of Women: &quot;The Definitive Guide&quot;&quot; (1985)
*&quot;The Soap Letters&quot; (1988)
*&quot;Root into Europe&quot; (1992)
*&quot;Root about Britain&quot; (1994)

Donaldson lived at 139 Elm Park Mansions on Park Walk, Chelsea, London SW10, from which address all the Root letters were sent. Nearby, The Henry Root restaurant has been established in his memory.

Donaldson&#x27;s biographical survey of roguish Britons through the ages, &quot;Brewer&#x27;s Rogues, Villains and Eccentrics&quot; (2002), has been described as &quot;a breathtaking triumph of misdirected scholarship&quot;.

Donaldson also wrote novels including the semi-autobiographical &#x27;Is This Allowed&#x27;. In the 1990s he also had a column in &quot;The Independent&quot;.

The phenomenal success of the Henry Root books, especially the first, enabled Donaldson to resume his earlier chaotic lifestyle, and in the mid-1980s he began using crack cocaine. He continued its use for more than a decade, but insisted he was not addicted.

Donaldson also wrote under other names, including Dr Kit Bryson, Jean-Luc Legris, and Selina Fitzherbert (who &quot;together&quot; wrote &quot;The Complete Naff Guide&quot; (1983) and other related books; Donaldson&#x27;s co-author was Simon Carr, who would write an obituary of Donaldson for &quot;The Independent&quot;), Talbot Church, and Liz Reed.

===Personal life===
Donaldson married Sonia Avory in 1957 and they had a son named Charlie. He left her for Jacki Ellis, then the wife of Jeffrey Bernard, but in due course she left him. A sequence of affairs followed, including liaisons with Sarah Miles and Carly Simon. He left Miles for Simon, whom he described as &quot;the answer to any sane man&#x27;s prayers; funny, quick, erotic, extravagantly talented&quot;, but this did not prevent him from jilting her while they were engaged and returning to Miles. In 1968, Donaldson inherited another fortune and married Claire Gordon. The couple epitomised 1960s Swinging London. He later remembered that &quot;sex, whether in company or not, has been the only department in life in which I have demanded from anyone taking part the very highest standards of seriousness.&quot; Donaldson&#x27;s third marriage, in 1986, was to Cherry Hatrick, who survived him; they separated six months after their marriage.

<text>Julie London (born Julie Peck; September 26, 1926 – October 18, 2000) was an American singer and actress whose career spanned more than 40 years. A torch singer noted for her contralto voice, London recorded over thirty albums of pop and jazz standards between 1955 and 1969. Her recording of &quot;Cry Me a River&quot;, a song she introduced on her debut album &quot;Julie Is Her Name,&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2001. In addition to her musical notice, London was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in 1974 for her portrayal of Nurse Dixie McCall in the television series &quot;Emergency!&quot;

Born in Santa Rosa, California, to vaudevillian parents, London was discovered while working as an elevator operator in downtown Los Angeles, and she began her career as an actress. London&#x27;s 35-year acting career began in film in 1944, and included roles as the female lead in numerous Westerns, co-starring with Rock Hudson in &quot;The Fat Man&quot; (1951), with Robert Taylor and John Cassavetes in &quot;Saddle the Wind&quot; (1958), with Gary Cooper in &quot;Man of the West&quot; (1958) and with Robert Mitchum in &quot;The Wonderful Country&quot; (1959).

In the mid-1950s, London signed a recording contract with Liberty Records, marking the beginning of her professional musical career. She released her final studio album in 1969, but achieved continuing success playing the female starring role of nurse Dixie McCall in the television series &quot;Emergency!&quot; (1972–1979), in which she acted with her husband Bobby Troup. The show was produced by her ex-husband Jack Webb.

==Early life==

London was born Julie Peck on September 26, 1926, in Santa Rosa, California, the only child of Josephine Rosalie Peck (née Taylor; 1905 – 1976) and Jack Peck (1901–1977), who were a vaudeville song-and-dance team. In 1929, when she was three years old, the family moved to San Bernardino, California, where she made her professional singing debut on her parents&#x27; radio program.

Throughout her early life, both London and her mother were admirers of Billie Holiday. London was described by friends and family as a shy child &quot;without much self-confidence&quot;. In 1941, when she was 14, her family moved to Hollywood, California. In her teenaged years, she began to sing in local nightclubs in Los Angeles. She graduated from the Hollywood Professional School in 1945 and worked as an elevator operator in downtown Los Angeles throughout high school.

==Career==
===Discovery and early film roles===
In 1943, London met Sue Carol, a talent agent and then-wife of actor Alan Ladd, while operating the elevator at Roos Bros., (Roos/Atkins), an upscale clothing store on Hollywood Boulevard. Struck by London&#x27;s physical features, Carol facilitated a screen test for the inexperienced actress, and London signed a contract with her. London met &quot;Esquire&quot; photographer Henry Waxman while working her second job as a clerk at a menswear store, and he shot photographs of her that appeared in the magazine&#x27;s November 1943 issue. These photos helped establish her as a pin-up girl during World War II.

She made her film debut while still in high school, appearing under the name Julie London in &quot;Nabonga&quot; in 1944. She later starred in the 1947 film &quot;The Red House&quot; with Edward G. Robinson. After a series of uncredited roles, she signed a contract with Warner Bros. Pictures, appearing in the war film &quot;Task Force&quot; (1949) and the Western &quot;Return of the Frontiersman&quot; (1950). She was cast in the lead role of Pat Boyd in the William Castle-directed &quot;The Fat Man&quot; (1951). London completed shooting the film in August 1950. After Warner Bros. dropped her contract, London was offered a contract with Universal Pictures based on the role, but turned it down, opting instead to focus on her marriage to actor Jack Webb.

===Mainstream films and music===
After divorcing Webb in 1954, London resumed her career, appearing in &quot;The Fighting Chance&quot;, filmed in May 1955 and released by 20th Century Fox. Earlier in 1955, London was spotted singing at a jazz club in Los Angeles by record producer Simon Waronker, who was recommended to her by her friend (and future husband) Bobby Troup. Despite her notable stage fright, Waronker was impressed by London&#x27;s vocals and delivery, and later recalled that &quot;The lyrics poured out of her like a hurt bird.&quot; Waronker convinced London to pursue a recording career, and signed her with Liberty Records. London recorded 32 albums in a career that began in 1955 with a live performance at the 881 Club in Los Angeles. Her debut album &quot;Julie Is Her Name&quot; was released in December of that year, and &quot;Billboard&quot; named her the most popular female vocalist for 1955, 1956, and 1957. She was the subject of a 1957 &quot;Life&quot; cover article in which she was quoted as saying &quot;It&#x27;s only a thimbleful of a voice, and I have to use it close to the microphone. But it is a kind of oversmoked voice, and it automatically sounds intimate.&quot;

London&#x27;s debut recordings (which appeared on her self-titled extended play) were completed under the New York-based Bethlehem Records label. Four additional tracks recorded during these sessions were later included on the album &quot;Bethlehem&#x27;s Girlfriends&quot;, a compilation album released in 1957. Bobby Troup was one of the session musicians on the album. London recorded the standards &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry About Me&quot;, &quot;Motherless Child&quot;, &quot;A Foggy Day&quot;, and &quot;You&#x27;re Blasé&quot;. &quot;Cry Me a River&quot;, London&#x27;s most famous single, was written by her high-school classmate Arthur Hamilton and produced by Troup. The recording became a million-seller after its release on her debut album in 1955.
While her music career earned her public notice, London also continued to appear in films, with lead roles in &quot;Crime Against Joe&quot; (1956), as well as appearing as herself in &quot;The Girl Can&#x27;t Help It&quot; (1956), in which London performs three songs, including &quot;Cry Me a River&quot;. The film was a box-office success, and became one of the top-30 highest grossing films of 1956. London subsequently appeared in a television advertisement for Marlboro cigarettes, singing the &quot;Marlboro Song&quot;. She appeared in several Westerns: In 1957, she appeared in &quot;Drango&quot; playing a Southern belle harboring fugitives, followed by a starring role opposite Gary Cooper in &quot;Man of the West&quot;, in which her character, the film&#x27;s only woman, is abused and humiliated by an outlaw gang. The same year, she appeared as a pending bride in the Western &quot;Saddle the Wind&quot;; London&#x27;s performance received critical acclaim in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. She appeared in &quot;The Wonderful Country&quot; in 1959, in which she plays a downtrodden wife of an army major.

In 1960, London released the album &quot;Julie...At Home&quot;, which was recorded at her residence in Los Angeles. The same year, she released &quot;Around Midnight&quot;, which incorporated a larger backing band in comparison to her previous releases. She released numerous albums on Liberty Records throughout the 1960s, including &quot;Whatever Julie Wants&quot; (1961), &quot;Love Letters&quot; (1962), &quot;The End of the World&quot; (1963), and &quot;All Through the Night&quot; (1965), the latter a collection of songs by Cole Porter.

===Television work and final recordings===

London appeared on numerous television series in the 1960s, including guest appearances on &quot;Rawhide&quot; (1960), &quot;Laramie&quot; (1960), &quot;I Spy&quot; (1965), &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; (1965) and &quot;The Big Valley&quot; (1968). She and second husband Bobby Troup frequently appeared as panelists on the game shows &quot;Tattletales&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, and &quot;Masquerade Party&quot; in the 1970s. On May 28, 1964, she and Troup recorded a one-hour program for Japanese television in Japan. London sang 13 of her classic songs, including &quot;Bye Bye Blackbird&quot;, &quot;Lonesome Road&quot;, and &quot;Cry Me a River&quot;. She released studio albums until the end of the decade, and her final studio album was &quot;Yummy, Yummy, Yummy&quot; (1969), a collection of contemporary songs. After this, London stopped singing professionally. She had lost significant vocal control due to years of smoking and drinking.

===&quot;Emergency!&quot;===

London remained close with ex-husband Jack Webb, and in 1972, he cast her and Troup in his television series &quot;Emergency!&quot;, of which he was executive producer. London played Dixie McCall, Rampart&#x27;s Chief Nurse of The Emergency Room and Troup was cast as emergency room physician Dr. Joe Early, along with her best friend Robert Fuller as Dr. Kelly Brackett, Rampart&#x27;s Chief of Emergency Medicine. They all appeared in the same roles in an episode of the Webb-produced series &quot;Adam-12&quot;.

In 1977, after a six-year run of 128 episodes, &quot;Emergency!&quot; was cancelled despite good ratings. London, the only actress to appear in every episode of the series, was invited back for two of the four TV movie specials, and the show ended in 1979. During this time, London appeared in television advertisements for Rose Milk Skin Care Cream. Later, Webb offered London a position as executive producer of future television projects, but she chose to retire from the television industry to spend more time with her family. She completed &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot;, her last musical recording, for the soundtrack of the Burt Reynolds film &quot;Sharky&#x27;s Machine&quot; in 1981.

==Artistry==
Predominantly a torch singer, London was described by critics as both &quot;sultry&quot; and &quot;low-keyed&quot;. Her recordings were often noted by critics for being &quot;intimate&quot;, typically featuring sparse guitar and bass arrangements. A BBC &quot;Legends&quot; episode noted: &quot;Some singers sing as though they are addressing a crowd; some sing as though they are in a bar with a lot of people—[London] sings as though she&#x27;s in one room, with you—and that&#x27;s the difference.&quot;

Music journalist Lucy O&#x27;Brien stated: &quot;[In] the mid-&#x27;50s...pop [was] in a period of transition from big band swing to small jazz combos; you&#x27;ve got rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll, you&#x27;ve got R&amp;B—and she managed to incorporate all those influences and feed that into her music. She was very much of her time.&quot; As her career progressed into the 1960s, London&#x27;s recordings incorporated more elaborate instrumentation, with her vocals backed by larger ensembles.

==Personal life==

In 1947, London married actor/producer Jack Webb. Their relationship was based partly on their common love of jazz. They had two daughters, Stacy and Lisa. London and Webb divorced in 1954. Julie married Bobby Troup in 1959. Jack Webb died December 23, 1982. Stacy Webb died in a traffic accident in 1996, one day after her mother&#x27;s 70th birthday.

Withdrawn and introverted despite her public persona, London rarely granted media interviews and never discussed the breakup of her marriage to Webb.

==Death==
London was a chain smoker from the age of 16 and at times smoked in excess of three packs of cigarettes per day. She suffered a stroke in 1995 and remained in poor health for the following five years. In late 1999, she was diagnosed with lung cancer but decided to forego treatment due to her weakened physical state. On October 17, 2000, London was rushed from her home to the Encino-Tarzana Regional Medical Center after choking and struggling to breathe. She died in the hospital in the early morning hours of October 18 of what was later determined to be cardiac arrest; she was 74.

London was cremated and buried next to Troup in the Courts of Remembrance Columbarium of Providence at Forest Lawn-Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles. Her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (for recording) is at 7000 Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles.

==Legacy==
London performed &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; in the film &quot;The Girl Can&#x27;t Help It&quot; (1956), and her recording gained later attention for its use in the films &quot;Passion of Mind&quot; (2000) and &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; (2006). The track was ranked number 48 in NPR&#x27;s list of the 50 Greatest Jazz Vocals, and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2001.

Her albums &quot;Julie...At Home&quot; and &quot;Around Midnight&quot; (both released in 1960) were both included in the book &quot;1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die&quot;. She has been named as an influence by several contemporary artists, including Lana Del Rey and Billie Eilish. Music journalist Will Friedwald referred to London as &quot;one of the most influential stylists of the early 20th century.&quot; London also inspired a tribute from Jools Holland and Jamiroquai as part of their music video version of &quot;I&#x27;m in the Mood for Love&quot; shortly after her passing.

Her cover of the Ohio Express song &quot;Yummy Yummy Yummy&quot; was featured on the television series &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; and appears on its soundtrack album. London&#x27;s &quot;Must Be Catchin&#x27; &quot; was featured in the 2011 premiere episode of the series &quot;Pan Am&quot;.

<text>Eliseo Antonio Quintanilla Ortíz (born 5 February 1983) is a Salvadoran former professional footballer.

==Club career==
Nicknamed &quot;Cheyo&quot;, Quintanilla started his professional career at Salvadorian giants FAS, making his professional debut in 1999 at age 16. In 2001, he moved to rivals Águila and while with them, he played in a friendly in Los Angeles.

===Major League Soccer===
The management at Major League Soccer outfit D.C. United watched the game tapes and signed the small playmaker with the club in 2002. Injuries however curtailed his MLS career. He scored just five goals and five assists in two years in the league, missing all of 2004 with an injury, and was subsequently released. In 2004, he was injured at a preseason training camp and was unable to play the entire season.

He returned to play in his native country but in 2008, Quintanilla signed a five-month deal with Costa Rican football club L.D. Alajuelense. After being released he again returned to El Salvador, where he rejoined Águila for two years.

===Europe===
In May 2009, Quintanilla signed to newly promoted Cypriot team Ermis Aradippou for the 2009/2010 season. His stay was somewhat short-lived, only playing 10 domestic league games and scoring one goal in the Cypriot Cup.

On 16 December 2009, Mexican lower league side Correcaminos UAT confirmed acquiring Quintanilla on a six-month contract. Shortly after Correcaminos were eliminated in the quarter-finals, it was announced that Quintanilla would no longer continue with the club. Quintanilla made 17 league appearances and only scored one goal for the club.

In May 2010, Quintanilla signed a one-year contract with Luis Ángel Firpo and on 24 May 2011, Quintanilla signed with Guatemalan club Municipal. Quintanilla scored an amazing goal from a free kick on 1 December 2011 against Marquense. The goal won the &quot;Premios Matador&quot; prize on ESPN Deportes. He received 96%, from the 10 players voting, which broke the voting record for &quot;Premios Matador&quot;.

===Match-fixing ban===
On 20 September 2013, Quintanilla was banned for 6 months due to his involvement with match fixing.

==International career==
Quintanilla made his debut for El Salvador, aged 16 years, in a February 2000 friendly match against Honduras and has, as of December 2011, earned a total of 59 caps, scoring 15 goals. He has represented his country in 19 FIFA World Cup qualification matches and played at the 2007 and 2009 UNCAF Nations Cups, as well as at the 2007, 2009 and 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cups.

On 22 June 2008, Eliseo scored two goals as El Salvador came back in a thriller to defeat Panama, 3–1. With the win, El Salvador advanced to Round 3 in the CONCACAF Zone in the World Cup Qualifiers for Africa 2010.

On 28 March 2009, Quintanilla scored his twelfth, and quite possibly most memorable goal with the national team. The goal came in a World Cup qualification match against the USA and marked the first time in over eleven years that El Salvador had managed to score a goal against them. The match ultimately ended in a 2–2 draw.

<doc id="1013192" wikidata="Q368618" url="?curid=1013192" title="Ramón Núñez">
<text>Ramón Fernando Núñez Reyes (born 14 November 1985) is a former footballer. Núñez plays primarily as an attacking midfielder. He can also play as a winger or as a second striker. In his homeland he is nicknamed &quot;El Principito&quot; meaning &quot;The Little Prince&quot;.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Born in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, Núñez grew up in the United States, coming with his family on his father&#x27;s investor visa in the early 1990s and graduating from W. T. White High School in Dallas, Texas. He was drafted by the Dallas Burn sixth overall in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft after one season of college soccer at Southern Methodist University for which he was named the Missouri Valley Conference freshman of the year.

===MLS career===

In his first year with the Dallas Burn (which later changed their name to FC Dallas), Núñez saw very limited action, playing a total of 107 minutes in eight games. However, he came on strong at the end of his second season, earning a starting role and finishing with five league goals and three assists. After losing a starting spot, he transferred to Chivas USA in August 2007. He was released on a free transfer at the end of the season.

===Deportivo Olimpia===
Soon after, Ramón joined Olimpia of Honduras where he made 34 appearances, finding the net three times. He was a key player in Olimpia&#x27;s lineup and played mostly as an attacking midfielder, providing several assists. He was renowned for his extraordinary vision and was instrumental in Los Leones&#x27;s 2007/08 Clausura triumph, his performances also securing him the player of the season award.

===Puebla===
Núñez&#x27;s excellent form with Olimpia and with the Honduras national football team led to him signing on loan for six months at Mexican Primera División side Puebla. He scored his first goal with Puebla on 18 February 2009 against C.F. Pachuca. He continued to score for &#x27;La Franja&#x27; since then and brought his goal tally up to five goals. He also created five assists throughout the season.

===Cruz Azul===
His performances on loan for Puebia earned Núñez a move to Cruz Azul for the 2009–2010 season, where he scored two goals in the CONCACAF Champions League. He left the club after six months after not making the same sort of impression he made at Puebia. He decided to return to Honduras so he could get regular games to guarantee his spot in the 2010 Honduras World Cup Squad.

===C.D. Olimpia===
Núñez returned to Honduras after leaving Mexico, where he re-joined the nation&#x27;s most successful side in C.D. Olimpia where he scored 5 goals in 11 games for them. After his 6-month contract ended, Núñez wanted to try his luck in Europe after turning down offers to join Mexican Premier League clubs. After becoming a free agent, he left Olimpia to join Leeds initially on a trial basis before signing a permanent contract.

===Leeds United===
In August 2010, Núñez joined English club Leeds United on trial. Núñez scored in his first game for the club in a pre-season friendly victory against Bradford Park Avenue. After impressing manager Simon Grayson during his trial, Núñez&#x27;s trial period was extended at Leeds by a further week. On 31 August 2010, Núñez signed a professional contract with Leeds United until January 2011, when there is an option to extend the contract even further. On 14 September, in order to gain match fitness, Núñez played 90 minutes in Leeds&#x27; 3–1 behind closed doors friendly win against Middlesbrough. Núñez put in an impressive performance, scoring a goal and gaining an assist for Mike Grella. Núñez revealed on 23 September, that he was eligible to play for Leeds&#x27; first team after going to New York to get a green light on the necessary paperwork.

On 28 September, Núñez was named on the bench for Leeds against Preston North End and against Ipswich Town. He made his debut as a second-half substitute against Cardiff City, as Leeds were comprehensively beaten 4–0 at home. Núñez came on as a second-half substitute against Scunthorpe United. On 1 January 2011, manager Grayson revealed that Núñez might get a new contract despite not playing many games.

On 13 January, Núñez signed a new contract extension with Leeds until the end of the 2010–11 season. The extension also includes the option of a further year on the contract.

Despite the new contract and some impressive performances for Leeds United&#x27;s reserve team (including all four goals in the 4–1 victory of Lincoln City on 7 March), Núñez struggled for chances in the Leeds United first team, making do with a place on the bench and a regular spot in Leeds&#x27; reserves.

Leeds chose to exercise the option on Núñez&#x27;s contract and the midfielder has extended his stay at Elland Road for another year.

====Scunthorpe loan====
On 24 March, he joined Scunthorpe United on loan in order to get some more experience in English football. On 2 April, Núñez made his debut in the 6-0 thrashing by Norwich at Carrow Road on 2 April 2011, however after a sending off to a Scunthorpe player Núñez was substituted in the first half. He scored his first goal for Scunthorpe against Crystal Palace on 16 April 2011. After impressing in his first month, Núñez&#x27;s loan was extended until the end of the season. Núñez&#x27;s impressive form continued when he scored an important equaliser for Scunthorpe against Coventry City on 22 April, after the game manager Alan Knill revealed when he signed Núñez he first spoke to him in pidgin English only for Núñez to speak back to him in his broad American accent.

Núñez won a penalty for Scunthorpe against Nottingham Forest, however Scunthorpe lost the match 5-1 and were relegated to League One. Núñez capped a productive loan spell when he scored his third goal of the season in the final match of the season against Portsmouth.

====Return to Leeds====
After his spell on loan at Scunthorpe, Núñez signed a new contract at Leeds on 9 May 2011. After playing five games for Honduras over the summer in the CONCACAF Gold Cup, Núñez was given extra time off before returning to Leeds for pre season training. Núñez played a part in Leeds&#x27; 2011 pre-season matches scoring against Falkirk when his cross was turned in for an own goal in Leeds 2–0 pre-season victory, following this impressive performance up with a goal against Motherwell. He also scored a late equaliser in the 1–1 draw with Norwegian club Sandefjord Fotball.

Núñez was given the number 20 shirt for Leeds United. He came on as a substitute for Leeds the opening day of the season as they crashed to a 3–1 defeat against Southampton. Núñez scored his first goals for Leeds with a brace against Bradford City in the League Cup 3–2 win on 9 August. Núñez made his first ever league start for Leeds on 16 August against Hull City, and scored his 3rd goal of the season during the match- his first league goal for the club. Núñez scored his 4th and 5th goals of the season against Doncaster Rovers in the League Cup on 23 August. After the sale of Max Gradel, Núñez came into the starting lineup against Crystal Palace on 10 September. Núñez dropped to the bench in place of Andy Keogh against Manchester United, he came on as a second-half substitute and managed to miss one of Leeds&#x27; best scoring chances late on in the game.

On 11 October 2011, Núñez signed a new four-year deal with an option of a fifth year with Leeds United. Despite this, he was transfer listed by Neil Warnock at the end of the 2011–12 season. After being put on the transfer list by Leeds, Núñez was linked with a move to Yorkshire Rivals Doncaster Rovers and newly promoted Charlton Athletic. Núñez was not allocated a squad number for the 2012–13 season on 3 August.

Núñez suffered a cruciate ligament injury on 3 September during Leeds United development squad&#x27;s victory against Wigan. The injury would rule him out for the season and hinder his chances of a move away from the club.

Núñez had his contract mutually terminated on 29 January 2013.

===Alajuelense===
On 11 June 2014, Ramón&#x27;s signing with Alajuelense was made public. He was released from the team on 12 November due to disciplinary issues.

==International career==
Núñez was part of the U-20 Honduras national football team at the 2005 World Youth Championship in the Netherlands. In October 2006, Núñez was called up to the senior Honduras national football team for the first time. He made his début for the national side on 9 September 2007 coming in as a substitute in a match against Costa Rica. Ramón made his second and third appearances in September after being called up by Reinaldo Rueda to play in the CONCACAF World Cup Qualifiers. In 2008, Núñez appeared for the U-23 Honduras side at the Men&#x27;s Olympic Football Tournament in Beijing. Ramón Núñez scored two goals for the Honduras national football team after the team was down one goal against Canada on 6 September 2008 to defeat the squad 2–1. Four days later he found the net again in Honduras&#x27; 2–0 match against Jamaica.

Núñez was named in the Honduras 2010 World Cup squad and was given the number 7 shirt, He played in all three of Honduras&#x27; games at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Honduras failed to progress beyond the group stages, with Spain and Chile qualifying for the next stage.

After joining Leeds, Núñez was called up for the Honduras national side to play in a friendly against Guatemala Núñez managed to win his 35th cap in the game and managed to create a goal in Honduras&#x27; 2–0 win Núñez was called up to play against Panama before Christmas. He was then called up for Honduras to play Costa Rica and Guatemala in the Copa América games. 15 January, Núñez scored against Costa Rica in injury time to earn Honduras a 1–1 draw. Núñez scored in his second successive game by scoring in Honduras&#x27; win against Guatemala. On 23 January, Núñez played in the 2011 Copa Centroamericana final and helped Honduras win the tournament after beating Costa Rica 2–1. Núñez won the award for best player of the tournament when he won the MVP. On 21 March, Núñez was called up into the Honduras squad.

In June 2011, Núñez played for Honduras in the CONCACAF Gold Cup, he was used as an impact player and came on as a substitute in each of the first four games. Nunez denied on his Twitter page that he had critisced the Honduras manager Luis Fernando Suárez after the 1–1 match against Guatemala in the Gold Cup. Honduras played Mexico in the semi-final of the Gold Cup with Núñez making his fifth appearance of the tournament as a substitute. However, Mexico beat Honduras 2–0 in extra time to reach the final.

Núñez revealed in August 2011 he turned down a call up for Honduras to feature against Venezuela as it meant he would miss Leeds match against Bradford City. Núñez started against Bradford and scored his first two goals for Leeds.

<doc id="1013210" wikidata="Q813911" url="?curid=1013210" title="Branch (computer science)">
<text>A branch, jump or transfer is an instruction in a computer program that can cause a computer to begin executing a different instruction sequence and thus deviate from its default behavior of executing instructions in order. Branch (or &quot;branching&quot;, &quot;branched&quot;) may also refer to the act of switching execution to a different instruction sequence as a result of executing a branch instruction. Branch instructions are used to implement control flow in program loops and conditionals (i.e., executing a particular sequence of instructions only if certain conditions are satisfied).

A branch instruction can be either an &quot;unconditional branch&quot;, which always results in branching, or a &quot;conditional branch&quot;, which may or may not cause branching depending on some condition. Also, depending on how it specifies the address of the new instruction sequence (the &quot;target&quot; address), a branch instruction is generally classified as &quot;direct&quot;, &quot;indirect&quot; or &quot;relative&quot;, meaning that the instruction contains the target address, or it specifies where the target address is to be found (e.g., a register or memory location), or it specifies the difference between the current and target addresses.

==Implementation==
Branch instructions can alter the contents of the CPU&#x27;s program counter (PC) (or instruction pointer on Intel microprocessors). The program counter maintains the memory address of the next machine instruction to be fetched and executed. Therefore, a branch, if executed, causes the CPU to execute code from a new memory address, changing the program logic according to the algorithm planned by the programmer.

One type of machine level branch is the jump instruction. These may or may not result in the PC being loaded or modified with some new, different value other than what it ordinarily would have been (being incremented past the current instruction to point to the following, next instruction). Jumps typically have &quot;unconditional&quot; and &quot;conditional&quot; forms where the latter may be &quot;taken&quot; or &quot;not taken&quot; (the PC is modified or not) depending on some condition.

The second type of machine level branch is the call instruction which is used to implement subroutines. Like jump instructions, calls may or may not modify the PC according to condition codes, however, additionally a return address is saved in a secure place in memory (usually in a memory resident data structure called a stack). Upon completion of the subroutine, this return address is restored to the PC, and so program execution resumes with the instruction following the call instruction.

The third type of machine level branch is the return instruction. This &quot;pops&quot; a return address off the stack and loads it into the PC register, thus returning control to the calling routine. Return instructions may also be conditionally executed. This description pertains to ordinary practice; however, the machine programmer has considerable powers to manipulate the return address on the stack, and so redirect program execution in any number of different ways.

Depending on the processor, jump and call instructions may alter the contents of the PC register in different ways. An absolute address may be loaded, or the current contents of the PC may have some value (or displacement) added or subtracted from its current value, making the destination address relative to the current place in the program. The source of the displacement value may vary, such as an immediate value embedded within the instruction, or the contents of a processor register or memory location, or the contents of some location added to an index value.

The term &quot;branch&quot; can also be used when referring to programs in high-level programming languages. In these branches usually take the form of conditional statements of various forms that encapsulate the instruction sequence that will be executed if the conditions are satisfied. Unconditional branch instructions such as GOTO are used to unconditionally jump to a different instruction sequence. If the algorithm requires a conditional branch, the GOTO (or GOSUB subroutine call) is preceded by an IF-THEN statement specifying the condition(s). All high level languages support algorithms that can re-use code as a loop, a control structure that repeats a sequence of instructions until some condition is satisfied that causes the loop to terminate. Loops also qualify as branch instructions. At the machine level, loops are implemented as ordinary conditional jumps that redirect execution to repeating code.

In CPUs with flag registers, an earlier instruction sets a condition in the flag register. The earlier instruction may be arithmetic, or a logic instruction. It is often close to the branch, though not necessarily the instruction &quot;immediately&quot; before the branch. The stored condition is then used in a branch such as &quot;jump if overflow-flag set&quot;. This temporary information is often stored in a flag register but may also be located elsewhere. A flag register design is simple in slower, simple computers. In fast computers a flag register can place a bottleneck on speed, because instructions that could otherwise operate in parallel (in several execution units) need to set the flag bits in a particular sequence.

There are also machines (or particular instructions) where the condition may be checked by the jump instruction itself, such as &quot;branch &lt;label&gt; if register X negative&quot;. In simple computer designs, comparison branches execute more arithmetic and can use more power than flag register branches. In fast computer designs comparison branches can run faster than flag register branches, because comparison branches can access the registers with more parallelism, using the same CPU mechanisms as a calculation.

Some early and simple CPU architectures, still found in microcontrollers, may not implement a conditional jump, but rather only a conditional &quot;skip the next instruction&quot; operation. A conditional jump or call is thus implemented as a conditional skip of an unconditional jump or call instruction.

===Examples===
Depending on the computer architecture, the assembly language mnemonic for a jump instruction is typically some shortened form of the word &quot;jump&quot; or the word &quot;branch&quot;, often along with other informative letters (or an extra parameter) representing the condition. Sometimes other details are included as well, such as the range of the jump (the offset size) or a special addressing mode that should be used to locate the actual effective offset.

This table lists the machine level branch or jump instructions found in several well-known architectures:

* x86, the PDP-11, VAX, and some others, set the carry-flag to signal &quot;borrow&quot; and clear the carry-flag to signal &quot;no borrow&quot;. ARM, 6502, the PIC, and some others, do the opposite for subtractive operations. This inverted function of the carry flag for certain instructions is marked by (*), that is, borrow=not carry in some parts of the table, but if not otherwise noted, borrow≡carry. However, carry on additive operations are handled the same way by most architectures.

==Performance problems with branch instructions==
To achieve high performance, modern processors are pipelined. They consist of multiple parts that each partially process an instruction, feed their results to the next stage in the pipeline, and start working on the next instruction in the program. This design expects instructions to execute in a particular unchanging sequence. Conditional branch instructions make it impossible to know this sequence. So conditional branches can cause &quot;stalls&quot; in which the pipeline has to be restarted on a different part of the program.

== Improving performance by reducing stalls from branches ==
Several techniques improve speed by reducing stalls from conditional branches.

=== Branch prediction hints ===
Historically, branch prediction took statistics, and used the result to optimize code. A programmer would compile a test version of a program, and run it with test data. The test code counted how the branches were actually taken. The statistics from the test code were then used by the compiler to optimize the branches of released code. The optimization would arrange that the fastest branch direction (taken or not) would always be the most frequently taken control flow path. To permit this, CPUs must be designed with (or at least have) predictable branch timing. Some CPUs have instruction sets (such as the Power ISA) that were designed with &quot;branch hints&quot; so that a compiler can tell a CPU how each branch is to be taken.

The problem with software branch prediction is that it requires a complex software development process.

=== Hardware branch predictors ===
To run any software, hardware branch predictors moved the statistics into the electronics. Branch predictors are parts of a processor that guess the outcome of a conditional branch. Then the processor&#x27;s logic gambles on the guess by beginning to execute the expected instruction flow. An example of a simple hardware branch prediction scheme is to assume that all backward branches (i.e. to a smaller program counter) are taken (because they are part of a loop), and all forward branches (to a larger program counter) are not taken (because they leave a loop). Better branch predictors are developed and validated statistically by running them in simulation on a variety of test programs. Good predictors usually count the outcomes of previous executions of a branch. Faster, more expensive computers can then run faster by investing in better branch prediction electronics. In a CPU with hardware branch prediction, branch hints let the compiler&#x27;s presumably superior branch prediction override the hardware&#x27;s more simplistic branch prediction.

=== Branch-free code ===
Some logic can be written without branches or with fewer branches. It is often possible to use bitwise operations, conditional moves or other predication instead of branches. In fact, branch-free code is a must for cryptography due to timing attacks.

=== Delay slot ===
Another technique is a branch delay slot. In this approach, at least one instruction following a branch is always executed, with some exceptions such like the legacy MIPS architecture likely/unlikely branch instruction. Therefore, the computer can use this instruction to do useful work whether or not its pipeline stalls. This approach was historically popular in RISC computers. In a family of compatible CPUs, it complicates multicycle CPUs (with no pipeline), faster CPUs with longer-than-expected pipelines, and superscalar CPUs (which can execute instructions out of order.)

<text>In computing, the MSI protocol - a basic cache-coherence protocol - operates in multiprocessor systems. As with other cache coherency protocols, the letters of the protocol name identify the possible states in which a cache line can be.

== Overview ==
In MSI, each block contained inside a cache can have one of three possible states:

*Modified: The block has been modified in the cache. The data in the cache is then inconsistent with the backing store (e.g. memory). A cache with a block in the &quot;M&quot; state has the responsibility to write the block to the backing store when it is evicted.
*Shared: This block is unmodified and exists in read-only state in at least one cache. The cache can evict the data without writing it to the backing store.
*Invalid: This block is either not present in the current cache or has been invalidated by a bus request, and must be fetched from memory or another cache if the block is to be stored in this cache.

These coherency states are maintained through communication between the caches and the backing store. The caches have different responsibilities when blocks are read or written, or when they learn of other caches issuing reads or writes for a block.

When a read request arrives at a cache for a block in the &quot;M&quot; or &quot;S&quot; states, the cache supplies the data. If the block is not in the cache (in the &quot;I&quot; state), it must verify that the block is not in the &quot;M&quot; state in any other cache. Different caching architectures handle this differently. For example, bus architectures often perform snooping, where the read request is broadcast to all of the caches. Other architectures include cache directories which have agents (directories) that know which caches last had copies of a particular cache block. If another cache has the block in the &quot;M&quot; state, it must write back the data to the backing store and go to the &quot;S&quot; or &quot;I&quot; states. Once any &quot;M&quot; line is written back, the cache obtains the block from either the backing store, or another cache with the data in the &quot;S&quot; state. The cache can then supply the data to the requester. After supplying the data, the cache block is in the &quot;S&quot; state.

When a write request arrives at a cache for a block in the &quot;M&quot; state, the cache modifies the data locally. If the block is in the &quot;S&quot; state, the cache must notify any other caches that might contain the block in the &quot;S&quot; state that they must evict the block. This notification may be via bus snooping or a directory, as described above. Then the data may be locally modified. If the block is in the &quot;I&quot; state, the cache must notify any other caches that might contain the block in the &quot;S&quot; or &quot;M&quot; states that they must evict the block. If the block is in another cache in the &quot;M&quot; state, that cache must either write the data to the backing store or supply it to the requesting cache. If at this point the cache does not yet have the block locally, the block is read from the backing store before being modified in the cache. After the data is modified, the cache block is in the &quot;M&quot; state.

For any given pair of caches, the permitted states of a given cache line are as follows:
== State Machine ==

Processor requests to the cache include:
* PrRd: Processor request to read a cache block.
* PrWr: Processor request to write a cache block.

In addition, there are bus side requests. These include:
* BusRd: When a read miss occurs in a processor&#x27;s cache, it sends a BusRd request on the bus and expects to receive the cache block in return.
* BusRdX: When a write miss occurs in a processor&#x27;s cache, it sends a BusRdX request on the bus which returns the cache block and invalidates the block in the caches of other processors.
* BusUpgr: When there&#x27;s a write hit in a processor&#x27;s cache, it sends a BusUpgr request on the bus to invalidate the block in the caches of other processors.
* Flush: Request that indicates that a whole cache block is being written back to the memory.
State Transitions:
* Invalid:
** On a PrRd, BusRd is issued and state changes to Shared.
** On a PrWr, BusRdX is issued and state changes to Modified.
** On a BusRd, BusRdX or a BusUpgr an invalid block remains Invalid.
* Shared:
** On a PrRd, the block remains in the Shared state.
** On a PrWr, BusUpgr is issued and state changes to Modified.
** On a BusRd, the block remains in the Shared state.
** On a BusRdX or BusUpgr, the block transitions to Invalid.
* Modified:
** On a PrRd or PrWr, the block remains in the Modified state.
** On a BusRd, the cache block is flushed onto the bus and state changes to Shared.
** On a BusRdX, the cache block is flushed onto the bus and state changes to Invalid.
** A BusUpgr is not possible. Note that by being in the Modified state in one particular processor, a cache block has to be in the Invalid state in all other processor(s), as the Modified state is allowed in either none or only one processor. This effectively negates the possibility of a BusUpgr on the bus, which would require this block to be in the Shared state in one of the processor(s) that, as seen above, issues a PrWr.

==Usage==

This protocol is similar to the one used in the SGI 4D machine.

==Variants==
Modern systems use variants of the MSI protocol to reduce the amount of traffic in the coherency interconnect. The MESI protocol adds an &quot;Exclusive&quot; state to reduce the traffic caused by writes of blocks that only exist in one cache. The MOSI protocol adds an &quot;Owned&quot; state to reduce the traffic caused by write-backs of blocks that are read by other caches. The MOESI protocol does both of these things.

<text>The MOSI protocol is an extension of the basic MSI cache coherency protocol. It adds the Owned state, which indicates that the current processor owns this block, and will service requests from other processors for the block.

== Overview of States ==
Following are the permitted states of a given cache line:

Modified (M) - Only one cache has a valid copy of the block and the value is likely to be different from the one in main memory. It has almost the same meaning as a dirty state in a write-back cache except for the difference that modified state also implies exclusive ownership of that block. Dirty state just means that the value of the block is different from the one in main memory, whereas, modified implies that the value is different than that of the main memory and that it is cached in only one location.

Owned (O) - Multiple caches may hold the most recent and correct value of a block and the value in main memory may or may not be correct. At a time, only one cache can have the owned state for a block. All the other caches with the same block must be in shared state.

Shared (S) - Cache block is valid, could be shared by multiple caches, and may or may not have the same value as the main memory. Other processors can read from this, but do not have write permissions.

Invalid (I) - Cache block is invalid.

For any given pair of caches, the permitted states of a given cache line are as follows:
== Operations ==

In MOSI protocol, each cache has the following requests:
* PrRd - Processor request to read a cache block.
* PrWr - Processor request to write into a cache block.
* BusRd - Snooped request indicating that there is a read request to a cache block made by another processor.
* BusRdX - Snooped request indicating that there is a write request to a cache block made by another processor that does not have the block.
* BusUpgr - Snooped request depicting that there is a write request to a cache block made by another processor that already has the block in its cache.
* Flush - Snooped request after which the cache block is placed on the bus for a cache to cache transfer.

=== Processor Transactions ===
Looking at the case for processor transactions, when the block is in the Invalid (I) state, either the cache block was never fetched from the memory or it was invalidated. When there is a processor read (PrRd), the state changes from invalid (I) to shared (S), thereby generating a bus read (BusRd). At the same time, if it is a processor write request (PrWr), then the state of the block changes to modified (M) along with a snooped write request (BusRdX).

Once the block is in the Owned (O) state, then a processor read (PrRd) does not generate any snooped signal and the block remains in the same state. Whereas, a write request from the processor (PrWr) results in changing the state of the block from owned (O) to modified (M) along with generating a snooped write request (BusUpgr).

When the block is in the Modified (M) state, neither a processor read (PrRd) nor a processor write (PrWr) request generates a snooped signal since the block already indicates that the most recent and correct value resides only in that cache. Hence, it does not change the state and stays in modified (M) state.

While the block is in the Shared (S) state and there is processor read (PrRd) request, since the value of the cache block is the same in every other processor and in the main memory, there is no bus signal that is generated after a processor read (PrRd). A bus write request (BusUpgr) is generated once there is a processor write (PrWr) request to a block in the shared (S) state because the cache block is now no longer valid in all the other caches and the state of the block changes from shared (S) to being modified (M).

=== Bus Transactions ===
Considering the behavior of the finite state machine to snooped bus transactions, if the cache block is in Invalid (I) state then no snooped bus request will affect the block in any way, so even if it is a bus read (BusRd) or bus write request from a processor that has or does not have the block (BusRdX or BusUpgr), the block remains in the same invalid (I) state and does not generate any further actions.

When the cache block is in the Shared (S) state and there is a snooped bus read (BusRd) transaction, then the block stays in the same state and generates no more transactions as all the cache blocks have the same value including the main memory and it is only being read, not written into. If there is snooped write request (BusRdX or BusUpgr), then the state of the block changes from shared (S) to invalid (I) as the value of the block has been modified in one of the other cache blocks and all the other copies now must be invalidated.

Once the cache block is in the Modified (M) state and there is a bus read (BusRd) request, the block flushes (Flush) the modified data and changes the state to owned (O), thus making it the sole owner for that particular cache block. At the same time, when it is in the modified (M) state, there is never going to be a bus write request (BusUpgr) from another processor as it does not have the cache block. With a write request from another processor that doesn&#x27;t have the block (BusRdX), the block changes its state to invalid (I) as another processor is writing to the block and hence will have the ownership for that block.

While a cache block is in the modified state, there is no possibility of a BusUpgr request from any other processor as none of them will have the block. By the definition of the modified (M) state, only that processor has the block, rest all are invalidated and hence cannot initiate a BusUpgr request.

While in the Owner (O) state and there is a snooped read request (BusRd), the block remains in the same state while flushing (Flush) the data for the other processor to read from it. With a snooped write request (BusRdX), the block changes state to invalid (I) along with flushing (Flush) the data as another processor is writing to it, thereby losing its ownership on that block. Whenever another processor tries to access that block, instead of going to the memory to access it, the processor takes it from other cache which already has that block in the owned (O) state. With a BusUpgr, it just changes the state from owner (O) to invalid (I).

== Comparison to MSI Protocol ==
The obvious difference between the MSI protocol and the MOSI protocol, also known as the Berkeley protocol is the presence of an extra state (owned) in MOSI in addition to having just a modified (M) state.

In the MSI protocol, whenever there is a read miss request to block which is in the modified (M) state, it writes back to the main memory while changing the status of the block to shared (S). But in the case of MOSI protocol, where we have an additional state (owner), whenever another processor requests for a read operation, the block changes from modified to the owned (O) state and so retains the dirty block of cache, thereby removing the need to write back to the main memory immediately.

This deferral can save bus traffic and main memory writes in certain sequences of transactions. Consider for example if a cache is M for processor 1, then processor 2 reads from it, and then processor 1 writes again to it. In MSI, the MS transition of processor 1 from the read leads to one memory write, and then the SM transition leads to a BusUpgr. On MOSI, the MO transition generates no traffic, and the OM transition also generates one BusUpgr as before. MOSI therefore dispensed the initial memory write back and associated bus traffic which MSI would do.

== Comparison to MESI Protocol ==
Both MESI (also known as Illinois) and MOSI protocols, are extensions of the MSI protocol to improve different functionalities. MOSI focuses on reducing write backs and MESI attempts to reduce the number of bus transactions required after a read and write request from another processor. The exclusive (E) state in MESI protocol implies that the cache block is valid, clean (same value as in the main memory) and cached only in one cache whereas the owned (O) state in MOSI protocol implies that the cache block is valid, potentially dirty, writable and could be present in more than one cache (all caches have the same value).

<doc id="1013230" wikidata="Q1467535" url="?curid=1013230" title="MOESI protocol">
<text>Modified Owned Exclusive Shared Invalid (MOESI) is a full cache coherency protocol that encompasses all of the possible states commonly used in other protocols. In addition to the four common MESI protocol states, there is a fifth &quot;Owned&quot; state representing data that is both modified and shared. This avoids the need to write modified data back to main memory before sharing it. While the data must still be written back eventually, the write-back may be deferred .

In order for this to be possible, direct cache-to-cache transfers of data must be possible, so a cache with the data in the modified state can supply that data to another reader without transferring it to memory.

As discussed in AMD64 Architecture Programmer&#x27;s Manual Vol. 2 &quot;System Programming&quot;″, each cache line is in one of five states:

;Modified: This cache has the only valid copy of the cache line, and has made changes to that copy. The cached copy may be further modified freely.

;Owned: This line is one of several copies in the system. This cache does not have permission to modify the copy &quot;but&quot; the line is modified (dirty) relative to main memory, and this cache has the exclusive responsibility for ensuring main memory is eventually updated. The cache line may be changed to the Modified state after invalidating all shared copies, or changed to the Shared state by writing the modifications back to main memory. Owned cache lines &quot;must&quot; respond to a snoop request with data, to ensure the stale copy in main memory is not used.

;Exclusive: This cache has the only copy of the line, but the line is clean (unmodified). It may be written to, changing to the Modified state. 

;Shared: This line is one of several copies in the system. This cache does not have permission to modify the copy. Unlike the MESI protocol, a shared cache line &quot;may&quot; be dirty with respect to memory; if it is, one cache has a copy in the Owned state, and that cache is responsible for eventually updating main memory. If no cache holds the line in the Owned state, the memory copy is up to date. The cache line may not be written, but must be changed to the Exclusive or Modified state first, by invalidating all other cached copies. (If the cache line was Owned before, the invalidate response will indicate this, and the state will become Modified, so the obligation to eventually write the data back to memory is not forgotten.) It may also be discarded (changed to the Invalid state) at any time.

;Invalid: This block is not valid; it must be fetched to satisfy any attempted access.

For any given pair of caches, the permitted states of a given cache line are as follows:

(The order in which the states are normally listed serves only to make the acronym &quot;MOESI&quot; pronounceable.)

This protocol, a more elaborate version of the simpler MESI protocol, avoids the need to write a dirty cache line back to main memory when another processor tries to read it. Instead, the Owned state allows a processor to supply the modified data directly to the other processor. This is beneficial when the communication between two CPUs is significantly better than to main memory. An example would be multi-core CPUs with per-core L2 caches.

While MOESI can quickly share dirty cache lines from cache, it may struggle to quickly share clean lines from cache. If a cache line is clean with respect to memory and in the shared state, then there is no obvious single candidate cache to respond to a read request, so it is normal to let the read request be filled from memory. (This is solved by the MESIF protocol, which may be combined with MOESI to make MOESIF.)

If a processor wishes to write to an Owned cache line, it must notify the other processors which are sharing that cache line. The standard implementation simply tells them to invalidate their copies, moving its own copy to the Modified state when this is complete, but alternatively it may use a write-through policy, telling them to update their copies with the new contents. This is a partial write-through which does not go as far as main memory; the processor&#x27;s own copy remains in the Owned state.

The latter reduces cache traffic &quot;if&quot; there are multiple active readers of e.g. a heavily contended lock; one broadcast write is less communication than separate replies to a thundering herd of read requests. Because these two variants are fully compatible, they may both be used in the same system based on heuristics like the cache&#x27;s estimate of the number of active readers of this cache line.

The ship model in a bottle is a traditional and the most iconic type of impossible bottle. Other common objects include fruits, matchboxes, decks of cards, tennis balls, racketballs, Rubik&#x27;s Cubes, padlocks, knots, and scissors. These may be placed inside the bottle using various mechanisms, including constructing an object inside the bottle from smaller parts, using a small object that expands or grows inside the bottle, or molding the glass around the object.

==Ship in a bottle==

There are two ways to place a model ship inside a bottle. The simpler way is to rig the masts of the ship and raise it up when the ship is inside the bottle. Masts, spars, and sails are built separately and then attached to the hull of the ship with strings and hinges so the masts can lie flat against the deck. The ship is then placed inside the bottle and the masts are pulled up using the strings attached to the masts. The hull of the ship must still be able to fit through the opening. Bottles with minor distortions and soft tints are often chosen to hide the small details of the ship such as hinges on the masts. Alternatively, with specialized long-handled tools, it is possible to build the entire ship inside the bottle.

The oldest surviving ships in a bottle were crafted by Giovanni Biondo at the end of the eighteenth century; two, at least, reproduce Venetian ships of the line. These are quite large and expensive models: the bottles (intended to be displayed upside down, with the neck resting on a small pedestal) measure about 45 cm. The oldest (1784) is in a museum in Lübeck; another (1786) is held by a private collector; the third (1792), that apparently reproduces the heavy frigate PN Fama, is in the Navy Museum in Lisbon. Another old model (1795), from an unknown builder, is kept in a museum in Rotterdam.

Ships in bottles became more popular as folk art in the second half of the nineteenth century, after the introduction of cheap, mass-produced bottles made with clear glass.

A significant collection of ships in bottles is the Dashwood-Howard collection held by the Merseyside Maritime Museum.

==God-in-a-bottle==
God-in-a-bottle, or God-in-the-Bottle, is a symbolisation of the crucifixion of Jesus through the placing in a bottle of carved wooden items, including a cross and often others such as a ladder and spear. The crossbeam of the cross is attached to the vertical beam after both are in the bottle. The bottles were often filled with liquid, latterly sometimes with particles akin to a snow globe. Such bottles were used in 19th-century Irish Catholicism as devotional objects or as talismans akin to witch bottles. They were found elsewhere in Catholic Europe, and are related to older &quot;Passion Bottles&quot;, made by glassblowers in their spare time, where a large variety of small glass symbols of the Passion of Jesus were inserted into a bottle. 

The making of Gods-in-bottles was exported through Irish diaspora, notably to mining communities in Northern England, where scenes with mining tools sometimes replaced the crucifixion. Examples are in the collections of the National Museum of Ireland – Country Life the Irish Agricultural Museum, Enniscorthy Castle museum, and the Beamish Museum in County Durham. Later makers were often Irish Travellers, whose craftworks often recycle discarded objects. Richard Power&#x27;s 1964 novel &quot;The Land of Youth&quot;, set in a fictional version of the Aran Islands, mentions an outcast who uses driftwood for what is &quot;known to generations of children as God-in-a-bottle.&quot; Although the &quot;Offaly Independent&quot; says that in the 1970s &quot;almost every pub in Tullamore&quot; displayed a bottle, by the 21st century they were largely unknown in Ireland. A 2023 episode of &quot;Nationwide&quot; reported on two men in the Irish midlands still practising the tradition.

==Small objects that expand naturally==

One variation of the impossible bottle takes advantage of pine cones opening as they dry out. In constructing the display, a closed, green cone of suitable size is inserted into a narrow-mouthed bottle and then allowed to dry inside the bottle.

Fruits and vegetables inside bottles are grown by placing a bottle around the blossom or young fruit and securing it to the plant. The fruit then grows to full size inside the bottle. This technique is used to put pears into bottles of pear brandy (most famously the French eau de vie Poire Williams).

<doc id="1013237" wikidata="Q773848" url="?curid=1013237" title="Robert Hill (Australian politician)">
<text>Robert Murray Hill (born 25 September 1946) is a retired Australian politician. He is an adjunct professor in Sustainability and Co-Director of the Alliance 21 project at the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney. He is also a Commissioner of the Global Ocean Commission and the 15th Chancellor of the University of Adelaide.

==Early life and family==

Born in Adelaide, Hill studied at Scotch College, Adelaide and the University of Adelaide, where he took degrees in Arts and Law, and later the London School of Economics, where he gained a master&#x27;s degree in law. Hill was a barrister and solicitor before entering politics.

He was Vice-President of the Liberal Party in South Australia 1977–79 and President 1985–87. Like many South Australian Liberals, Hill belonged to the liberal or moderate wing of the Liberal Party. He was also a member of the Liberal Party&#x27;s Federal Executive 1985–87 and 1990–93.

Hill comes from a political family. His father, Murray Hill, was a prominent Liberal member of the South Australian Legislative Council from 1965 to 1988. His daughter, Victoria, is an Australian actress.

==Career==
===Political career===
Hill was elected as a Senator for the State of South Australia, representing the Liberal Party, at the 1980 Federal election. He took his seat in the Senate on 1 July 1981, and served until 15 March 2006.

Following the announcement of the 1987 Senate election results, Hill was one of four senators who received a three-year term as a consequence of which method was chosen to allocate the seats.

After the Liberals&#x27; defeat (their fourth consecutive loss) at the 1990 federal election, Hill became Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (1990–96), and held appointments during these years as Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Defence, Public Administration and Education, Science and Training. In 1994 he was Chairman of the Senate&#x27;s Policy Review Committee.

In 1994 he was unsuccessful in seeking Liberal preselection for the House of Representatives seat of Boothby for the 1996 election. The preselected candidate was instead Andrew Southcott who went on to win the seat at the 1996 election and Hill remained in the Senate until his retirement in 2006.

Following the landslide election victory of the Liberals under John Howard in 1996, Hill became Leader of the Government in the Senate (1996–2006) and Minister for the Environment (1996–98). He was subsequently appointed Minister for the Environment and Heritage (1998–2001) and Minister for Defence (2001–06).

On 1 January 2001, Hill was awarded the Centenary Medal for &quot;service as Minister for Defence&quot;.

In July 2005 the Coalition parties took control of the Senate and Hill became the first Government Leader in the Senate since 1981 to command a majority in the chamber.

In January 2006, Hill announced his resignation from the Ministry and as Leader of the Government in the Senate. He did not specify a reason for his resignation, but said it was his decision to retire and he had not been pushed into it by the Prime Minister. However, one of The Age&#x27;s senior journalists, Michelle Grattan, said on 31 March 2008 &quot;Hill had not really wanted to leave Parliament, but John Howard was anxious to get him out.&quot;

On 15 March 2006, Hill resigned from the Senate and, two days later, was appointed Permanent Representative to the United Nations for Australia, replacing Caroline Millar. He served in that position until May 2009.

The diplomatic appointment made upon his retirement from Parliament was arranged by Foreign Minister and former Liberal leader Alexander Downer. Hill and Downer were factional rivals in their home state of South Australia and Downer was keen to see Hill out of Parliament as part of Downer&#x27;s long-term plan to return to the Liberal Party leadership which never eventuated.

It has been alleged that when Downer was Opposition Leader in 1994 he had failed to back Hill&#x27;s bid to move to the Lower House for the seat of Boothby.

Hill&#x27;s diplomatic appointment had been criticised by then Shadow Foreign Minister and future Prime Minister Kevin Rudd who had doubts about Hill&#x27;s diplomatic skills and said that the Howard Government had used the diplomatic service as &quot;a Liberal Party employment agency&quot; and this had left diplomats without the capacity to realise their ambitions.

Prior to Hill&#x27;s retirement in 2006 he voted for legalizing the abortion drug RU486 which had been banned in Australia up until that point

As Liberal Government Senate leader Hill had expressed the importance of the transition of the Prime Ministership from Howard to his Liberal deputy and heir apparent Peter Costello be smooth. It was a transition that never eventuated when Howard lost government at the 2007 election and Costello refused to succeed Howard as Liberal leader.

===Later career===
Following his return to Australia in 2009, Hill accepted an appointment as adjunct professor in Sustainability at the US Studies Centre at the University of Sydney where he was involved in the development of the $2 million Dow Sustainability Program, funded by the US-based Dow Chemical Company Foundation, to bring together academic and policy experts from Australia and the US to develop action-oriented solutions to a range of sustainability challenges concerning energy, water, food and biodiversity that are technologically innovative, commercially scalable and politically viable.

In July 2009, Hill was appointed by the Australian Government to head the Australian Carbon Trust.

The University of Adelaide announced on 9 April 2010 that Hill had been appointed Chancellor of the University. He completed the second of two two-year terms on 25 July 2014.

On 11 June 2012, Hill was named a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) for &quot;eminent service to the Parliament of Australia, particularly through the development of policy reform in the portfolios of the environment and defence, and to Australia&#x27;s international relations through senior diplomatic representation to the United Nations.&quot;

Hill is an advisory board member of United Against Nuclear Iran and the Counter Extremism Project.

In 2018 it was reported that Hill was a member of the high-level group established to explore reforming the Commonwealth, with an emphasis on the rules of succession for the title of Head of the Commonwealth.

<text>The Ace Aircraft Manufacturing Company was established in Wichita, Kansas in 1929 by Orland Corben to market the world&#x27;s first homebuilt aircraft, a machine of his own design called the Baby Ace. The enterprise did not last long before US regulations changed to restrict homebuilt aircraft, and Corben was forced to stop marketing his design.

He next commenced operations in Madison, Wisconsin in 1931 under the name Corben Sport Plane and Supply Company and produced a prototype sports plane known as the Super Ace. This endeavor soon languished, and the company remained dormant until Paul Poberezny purchased its assets for $US 200 in 1952. This included plans to three aircraft designs and a variety of components.

Poberezny was one of the founders of the Experimental Aircraft Association in 1953 and was approached by &quot;Mechanix Illustrated&quot; magazine the following year to write a series of articles on building an aircraft at home. Their publication caused considerable demand for plans, but Poberezny felt compelled to divest himself of marketing them in order to avoid any potential conflict of interest with his position within the EAA.

Since then, the rights have changed hands several times. They were purchased from Poberezny by Cliff Du Charme of West Bend, Wisconsin, who sold them to Edwin T. Jacob of McFarland, Wisconsin in 1961. Mr. Jacob sold them in 1965 to Thurman Baird of Asheville, North Carolina, who also owned the rights to the American Flea and the Heath Parasol aircraft. The rights were purchased from Baird&#x27;s estate in 1986 by Denny Meadows of Chesapeake, West Virginia, who sold them to the current owner, Bill Wood of Toccoa, Georgia in 1998.

<doc id="1013257" wikidata="Q2266701" url="?curid=1013257" title="Medabots">
<text>Medabots, known in Japan as , is a Japanese role-playing video game franchise created by Rin Horuma (Horumarin) and currently owned by Imagineer. The main series of RPGs focus on collecting and battling with the titular robots. The bulk of the games releases have been on Nintendo platforms, including the Game Boy, GameCube, and the DS, and 3DS handhelds.

The series was adapted into a Japanese anime television series spanning two adaptations. The first was animated by Bee Train while the second, &quot;Medarot Damashii&quot;, was animated by Production I.G. The television series originally aired on TV Tokyo from July 2, 1999, to March 30, 2001. Both series were originally licensed and localized into English by Nelvana and were broadcast on YTV in Canada and Fox Kids and ABC Family in the United States from 2001 to 2004.

A manga series, written by Rin Horuma, was also produced. It was serialized in the children&#x27;s magazine &quot;Comic BomBom&quot; in Japan and then published into collected volumes by Kodansha. The manga based on the first game, &quot;Medarot&quot;, was never translated into English, but the manga based on the sequel, &quot;Medarot 2&quot;, was licensed for an English language release in North America by Viz Media, simply under the title &quot;Medabots&quot;. &quot;Medarot 2&quot;, 3, and 4, have also been translated into English for distribution in Singapore by Chuang Yi.

To date, only &quot;Medabots&quot; (a remake of &quot;Medarot 2&quot; for Game Boy Advance), &quot;Medabots AX&quot;, and &quot;Medabots Infinity&quot; have been released in North America. There have also been plastic models produced by Kotobukiya.

A compilation game &quot;Medarot Classics Plus&quot; was released on November 12, 2020. It features the Kabuto and Kuwagata versions of the first eight mainline games.

==Plot==
In the future, the Medabots are a type of robot that are owned by different people and engage in Robattles. The theories and processes of the Medabots led to their creation at the hands of Dr. Eugene Aki, Professor Hushi, and Dr. Armond. In submission battles, the loser of the battle must give up one of their Medabots&#x27; parts ranging from their head, one of their arms, or their legs.

===&quot;Medabots&quot;===
The series centers around Medabots, artificially intelligent robots, whose purpose is to serve humans in a future time. The series begins with a ten-year-old (nine in the Japanese version) boy named Ikki Tenryō, who wants to become a champion of the World Robattle Tournament. However, Ikki is unable to afford a Medabot and his parents refuse to buy him one. However, he manages to get enough money to buy an outdated model, and, with a bit of luck, he finds a medal in a river that was previously dropped there after the Phantom Renegade thwarted a robbery by members of the Rubberobo Gang. Ikki quickly inserts it into the Medabot he purchased named Metabee. The only problem is that the medal he found gives Metabee a severe attitude problem (a problem rarely seen in a Medabot), which leads Ikki to think he is defective. However, this theory is proven wrong later in the series, as it is revealed that Metabee actually has a rare medal. Ikki and Metabee end up in different robattles while also contending with the Rubberobo Gang members Seaslug, Gillgirl, Squidguts, and Shrimplips who are led by Dr. Armond under his alias of Dr. Meta-Evil. In addition, they also encounter the Medabot Rokusho who was originally owned by Professor Hushi who was presumed dead in a fire.

The rare medals were kept secret by the Medabot Corporation, as very little was known about them. However, a Medabot with a rare medal would be able to call upon an attack called the &quot;Medaforce&quot;. In the manga, the Medaforce is a form of medal mind control, as explained by Dr. Aki in the third graphic novel of Medabots. In the cartoon however, it is shown as a way of increasing the power of the Medabot&#x27;s special skill into a focused beam attack.

Another important aspect is the story of Henry, the store clerk who sold Ikki Metabee. It is revealed that he is, quite obviously, Phantom Renegade. A running gag of the series was Henry almost telling everyone he is the Phantom Renegade, with no one ever discovering this fact. Space Medafighter X is introduced, who is another one of Henry&#x27;s secret identities, the number one Medafighter in Japan. Later, during the World Finals, he rarely shows up to the fights, instead sending substitutes and working behind the scenes. This being because he supposedly started The Ten Days of Darkness, which occurred eight years before the events in the series during the World Robattle Cup when Henry fought as Hikaru Agata with the original Metabee (however, the medal was different). The Medabots went on a rampage during the Ten Days of Darkness which stopped when Henry was forced to kill his Medabot by destroying his medal.

At the end of the second season, it is revealed that Victor (a medafighter for Team Kenya and Warbandit&#x27;s owner) was helping Dr. Meta-Evil to get medals during the tournament. During the finals, Metabee and Warbandit continue to fight, even with their partners lost and their bodies damaged. It is during this event that Dr. Meta-Evil starts his plan using Metabee and Warbandit&#x27;s medals; trapping them both in a dream. However, Ikki manages to get Metabee to wake up from the dream, while the other medabots, free now, help Metabee to fight against Dr. Meta-Evil.

Later in the series, Medabots are found to be actually thousands of years old; remnants of an ancient civilization who called themselves Medalorians. The Medalorians were obsessed with war, and to become more effective warriors they fastened metal armor to themselves. However, their wars decimated the civilization, and the survivors coded their memories onto hexagonal pieces of metal. These, &quot;Medals&quot;, cloned and mass-produced by the Medabot Corporation (a corporation founded by Dr. Aki), are the Medabot equivalent of a brain and soul. The original medals, referred to as rare medals, are kept in storage because of the extreme power they have. After Dr. Meta-Evil was defeated, Professor Hushi was revealed to have been saved from some aliens as he invites Dr. Meta-Evil with him on a space trip ultimately resulting in the disbandment of the Rubberobo Gang.

===&quot;Medarot Damashii (Medabots Spirits)&quot;===
&quot;Medarot Damashii&quot;, a sequel to the original series, follows Ikki and Metabee, as they face a new challenge some time after the events of the original series. Kam Kamazaki, a twelve-year-old boy, has designed one of the most dangerous Medabots in the entire story called Kilobots (or Death Medarot in the Japanese version) who use the X-Medal. These Kilobots have no feelings, since the emotion part of the Medabot medal has been removed, and more strength parts have been replaced instead, and can break the rules in order to win a fight. Because they have no personality, the Medaforce is useless against them. In the first episode, Ikki loses a Robattle to Ginkai and his Kilobot when it cheats and reloads. But he soon meets Nae, a Medabot mechanic and Dr. Aki&#x27;s granddaughter, who gives Ikki new medaparts in order to defeat the kilobot through using a new feature called Action Mode (later Demolition Mode is introduced as well). Throughout the season, Ikki, Erika and their new friend Zuru (who also masks as the Mystery Medafighter) battle several of Kam&#x27;s friends and their Kilobots. The Mystery Medfighter&#x27;s ambition is to rid the world of Kilobots, with the help of his medabot Roks. Eventually, Ginkai re-discovers the true spirit of medafighting and ceases being a rogue medafighter and returns to using Medabots. Eventually Kam realizes the error of his ways and stops trying to develop stronger and more dangerous Kilobots, choosing to remain with his Kilobot Blackbettle, who has a personality installed into her medal.

The series is often criticized for the removal of several supporting characters such as Henry/Hikaru Agata/Phantom Renegade/Space Medafighter X and Arcbeetle, Rokusho, Koji and Sumilidon, Rintaro and Kantaroth, Karin and Neutranurse, Victor and Warbandit, Mr. Referee, the Rubberobo Gang, and the Chick Salesman, as well as for the fact that many of the new Kilobots and Medabots are simply slightly modified versions of the original series without relation to the original characters: Roks (Rokusho), Exor (Sumilidon), Arcdash (Arcbeetle), Unitrix (Warbandit).

==Characters==

* Ikki Tenryou (天領イッキ &quot;Tenryō Ikki&quot;), is a lively and easygoing boy, although a bit timid, he is one of the main protagonists of the series. At first Ikki is unable to afford a Medabot. But after finding a medal in a river, he manages to buy a model, which is named Metabee. However, the medal he found appears to be defective, as Metabee is short-tempered and disobedient. In spite of this, a strong bond grows between them after several robattles. Though Ikki is not a full-fledged Medafighter, he gradually matures through the Robattles he engages in. He is voiced by Michiru Yamazaki in the Japanese version, Samantha Reynolds in the English translation of the first series, and by Julie Lemieux in the &quot;Spirits&quot; anime.
* is one of the main protagonists of the series, a Medabot belonging to Ikki Tenryou. Metabee is a Hercules beetle-type Medabot, specializing in revolver tactics. He possesses a rare medal that allows him to access the Medaforce. Metabee is known to be a rebellious and arrogant Medabot who often causes problems due to his headstrong personality. He is often sarcastic to his owner Ikki, but he shares a close bond with him, and so Ikki trusts him deeply. Metabee is voiced by Junko Takeuchi in Japanese. In the English version, he is voiced by Joseph Motiki.

==Media==
===Video games===
Most games in the series come in two versions: Kabuto (lit. &quot;Rhinoceros Beetle&quot;), in which the player&#x27;s starting Medabot&#x27;s design is based on a Japanese rhinoceros beetle (a &quot;KBT type&quot; Medabot), and Kuwagata, in which it is based on a stag beetle (&quot;KWG type&quot;). Differences beyond the starting Medabot also exist, such as which Medabot parts the player is able to collect, and minor story differences. &quot;Medarot R&quot;, &quot;Medabots Infinity&quot;, and the &quot;Parts Collection&quot; games were only titles to not have been released in two versions.

====Main series====
The main series entries, except &quot;Medabots DS&quot;, are all numbered.

====Spinoffs and side games====
Several spinoffs have been produced, some sticking closer to the RPG formula of the main series while others branch out into other genres.

For &quot;Medarot 1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, and &quot;3&quot;, supplementary games entitled &quot;Parts Collection&quot; were made. These are shorter games with less complicated stories, focusing mostly on battles. Their main draw is that the player is able to collect robot parts and other items within the &quot;Parts Collection&quot; games and transfer them to their respective main series titles.

===Manga===



Written by Horumarin, the &quot;Medabots&quot; manga series was originally serialized in the Kodansha&#x27;s children&#x27;s magazine &quot;Comic BomBom&quot; from 1997 to 2003.

The second series entitled &quot;Medarot 2&quot; was published between 1999 and 2000 and compiled in 4 volumes. This series was licensed for an English language release in North America by Viz Media under the title &quot;Medabots&quot;. the third series &quot;Medarot 3&quot; was released between 2000 and 2001 and compiled in two volumes. The fourth series &quot;Medarot 4&quot; was published in 2001 and compiled in two volumes. The fifth series &quot;Medarot 5&quot; was published between 2001 and 2002 and compiled in two volumes.

===Anime===


The &quot;Medabots&quot; anime series was adapted from &quot;Medarot 2&quot;, with its robotic combat elements inspired by &quot;Plawres Sanshiro&quot;. Produced by NAS and TV Tokyo and animated by Bee Train, the fifty-two episode series originally aired on TV Tokyo from July 2, 1999 until June 30, 2000. A thirty-nine episode sequel to the anime series that was animated by Trans Arts, aired from July 7, 2000 to March 30, 2001.

The Japanese version has received a VHS and DVD release of the first series, while the second series has only received a VHS release. On January 29, 2010, a Region 2 boxset release known as &quot;Medabot DVD BOX 1&quot; was released containing the first thirty episodes, with a second boxset on February 19 finishing with the last twenty-two episodes. Two boxsets for &quot;Damashii&quot; were released on December 30, 2010. This was the Production I.G series&#x27; very first DVD release.

Both series were licensed and localized into English by Canadian entertainment company Nelvana; the first series was divided into two seasons in North America. The first U.S. season originally aired on the Fox Broadcasting Company&#x27;s Fox Kids block from September 1, 2001 to April 27, 2002. &quot;Medabots&quot; was Fox Kids highest-rated new series at the time. As a result of the sale of Fox Family Worldwide (the joint venture with Saban Entertainment that previously operated the Fox Kids program block) to The Walt Disney Company, &quot;Medabots&quot; would begin airing on ABC Family on March 4, 2002. The second U.S. season first aired on ABC Family from July 1 to November 2, 2002, while &quot;Damashii&quot; first aired on the network from September 13, 2003 to May 8, 2004 with later episodes aired as part of the Jetix program block. In Canada, the television series aired on YTV which, along with Nelvana, were owned by Corus Entertainment.

Under the license of Nelvana, the series was released on 12-volume VHS and DVD by ADV Films from 2002 to 2003 that ran throughout the first 52 episodes, along with the first three volumes re-released under ADV Kidz in their Essential Anime DVD lineup in 2005. Distribution was transferred to Shout! Factory, where they&#x27;ve released the first 26 episodes on a 4-DVD box set, that was released in early 2008. Announced at Otakon 2019, Discotek Media released the anime on SD Blu-ray, starting with the first 26 episodes of the English dub with optional closed captions on December 24, 2019. The company also announced plans to release the Japanese version in the future. On June 11, 2020, Justin Sevakis said Discotek Media were unable to find the masters for the English version of &quot;Medabots Spirits&quot; which has prevented the anime from being released on home video in North America. Discotek Media asked fans to help find the masters. On September 15, 2020, it was announced “acceptable” masters have been recovered and would have a physical release. It was released on May 25, 2021.

==Vision and mission==
The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) is committed to improving the public&#x27;s health by supporting the efforts of epidemiologists working at the state and local level to influence public health programs and policy based on science and data.

CSTE promotes the effective use of epidemiologic data to guide public health practice and improve health. CSTE accomplishes this by supporting the use of effective public health surveillance and good epidemiologic practice through training, capacity development, and peer consultation, developing standards for practice, and advocating for resources and scientifically based policy.

CSTE has worked with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on &quot;Case Definitions for Public Health Surveillance&quot; and &quot;Chronic Disease Indicators&quot;.

==Activities==
CSTE is known for the following activities:
* The CSTE Annual Conference. – the largest annual gathering of applied epidemiologists in the nation, including 1,400 attendees in 2015.
* The CDC/CSTE Applied Epidemiology Fellowship – designed for recent master’s or doctoral level graduates in epidemiology or a related field who are interested in public health practice at the state or local level.
* Strengthening Health Systems through Interprofessional Education (SHINE) Fellowships – including three fellowships for bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral graduates: Applied Public Health Informatics Fellowship (APHIF), Health Systems Integration Program (HSIP), Informatics-Training in Place (I-TIPP).
* Steering committees and subcommittees – facilitating a wide array of member-driven public health epidemiology activities and information sharing through 30 subject-specific committees. Activities include the development of resources, manuals, and best practices; the facilitation of workshops, training events, and webinars; multi-partner collaborative projects; and more.
* Federal advocacy – communicating the workforce capacity needs of state, local, and territorial health departments.
* CSTE position statements – effecting national epidemiologic policy and procedural change through a process of review and voting by state representatives.
* Epidemiology Capacity Assessment – surveying all state, local, and tribal epidemiologists every two years to assess capacity in nine program areas: bioterrorism/preparedness, infectious diseases, chronic diseases, maternal and child health, environmental health, occupational health, oral health, substance abuse, and injury.
* State Reportable Conditions Assessment – surveying all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and six territories annually to provide an up-to-date description of reporting requirements for infectious diseases and non-infectious conditions.
* Indicators development – developing, maintaining, and stewarding surveillance indicators for environmental health, occupational health, chronic diseases, injury epidemiology, and other public health areas in order to improve performance of related public health programs.
* Global technical assistance – facilitating consultations and rapid deployment of members for international activities, such as Ebola Virus Disease and influenza epidemiology.

<doc id="1013263" wikidata="Q1513503" url="?curid=1013263" title="Somersault (film)">
<text>Somersault is a 2004 Australian romantic drama film written and directed by Cate Shortland in her feature directorial debut. It was released on 16 September 2004 and screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. It also swept the field at the 2004 Australian Film Institute Awards, winning every single feature film award (13 in total).

Exploring the themes of sexuality, alienation and emotion, &quot;Somersault&quot; is about a 16-year-old girl named Heidi (Abbie Cornish) who flees her Canberra home to the mountain town of Jindabyne in New South Wales. There she meets Joe (Worthington), the son of a local farmer, and gradually forms a relationship with him, despite his difficulty in expressing his feelings. He also seems to be unsure of his sexual orientation, despite having better-than-average luck meeting women.

The soundtrack is written and performed by Australian band Decoder Ring. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2004 the soundtrack was nominated for Best Original Soundtrack Album.

==Plot==

Heidi, a pretty teenager living in the Canberra suburbs, tries to seduce her mother Nicole&#x27;s boyfriend, and flees home when her mother catches her. She takes a bus to a ski resort in the Snowy River National Park where a man lives who once gave her his business card and invited her to contact him if she was ever in town. However, when she phones him, his wife answers the phone and he says that he does not remember her. She tries meeting some boys her age at a club and an older man in a ski shop but nobody wants to help her.

In a bar, a young man called Joe who saw her in the club the previous night buys her a drink. Without anywhere to sleep, he takes her to a motel but leaves for work in the morning. She strikes up a friendship with Irene, the woman who runs the motel who gives her breakfast. She asks for a job but, after Heidi says that her mother is dead, Irene allows her to stay in the room and pay the following day. Heidi calls Joe at his parents&#x27; farm but he doesn&#x27;t return her calls. Irene, knowing she doesn&#x27;t have the money for the room, puts her in her son&#x27;s flat, though she still wants rent in due course. In order to pay for it, Heidi needs a job, and is hired at a petrol station. Joe sees her by accident and they go for a drink and back to her flat. Her co-worker is Bianca and they become friends later on after Bianca&#x27;s mother offers her a lift home, where Joe is waiting at her flat. This begins a tentative dating relationship between the two.

One night, Joe and Heidi encounter some of his friends, who mock her for working in a petrol station. When Joe and Heidi go to a Chinese restaurant, she asks him if he loves her, and when he refuses to make any commitment or even discuss it, she swallows a bowl of hot chili peppers. He drags her to the bathroom to throw up and takes her back to the motel. He then goes to a party where his friends who mocked Heidi are hanging out. After a fight with one of his friends over Heidi, he then visits his neighbour Richard. Joe gets drunk and tells him how much he is obsessed with Heidi. Joe ends up kissing Richard, who is gay. Richard kisses him back but says he doesn&#x27;t think Joe knows what he wants. Joe says nothing and disappears presumably into Richard&#x27;s bedroom. The next morning, Joe drives home and his father is reading the newspaper at the breakfast table. Joe tells his father he&#x27;s drunk and begins to cry. His father ignores his emotional distress.

Meanwhile, Heidi discovers that Bianca&#x27;s father is the man she propositioned in the ski shop. When Heidi tries to leave, Bianca&#x27;s father offers her a ride back home and tells her to stay away from his daughter because Heidi is a bad influence. The next day at work Bianca is cold and distant. When Heidi asks why, Bianca confesses her father told her everything. Angry, Heidi quits by storming out of the petrol station. That evening she goes to the night club and gets drunk. Two young men pick her up and go home with her. Although she is barely conscious, they kiss and undress her. One of the men undresses and is about to have sex with her when Joe comes in. Joe punches him in the face and Heidi and Joe leave. After they leave, Joe condemns Heidi&#x27;s promiscuity and she accuses Joe of not caring for her, which he does not deny and drives off.

The next morning, Irene tells Heidi to leave. Heidi forces Irene to admit that her son is in prison for murder and confesses that her mother was not dead after all. Irene asks Heidi to call her mother and make amends. Later the next day, Heidi has packed up her things and is returning from a walk. Joe is waiting for her and is surprised to learn that Heidi is leaving. As they wait for Heidi&#x27;s mother to come, Joe holds Heidi&#x27;s hand — something he had difficulty doing previously.

The film ends as Heidi&#x27;s mother arrives. Joe tries to give Heidi a kiss goodbye but Heidi stops him and says she&#x27;s glad they met. Heidi embraces her mother, and when they drive off Heidi watches the icy scenery go by.

==Reception==
&quot;Somersault&quot; grossed $2,158,574 at the box office in Australia and was well received by critics. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 84% based on 69 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;A poignant coming-of-age tale marked by a breakout lead performance from Abbie Cornish and a successful directorial debut from Cate Shortland.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 73, based on 21 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton of &quot;At the Movies&quot; both praised the film, giving it 4 stars. In her review, Pomeranz wrote &quot;There&#x27;s no doubting Cate Shortland&#x27;s talent. Her vision for this film is delicate and wrenching, tentatively optimistic. I have images from the film that haunt me still, Heidi’s hands – that ultimate connecting point of us all, her vulnerable body wrapped up against the cold in her pale blue parka, the landscape of that world at the bottom of the mountains&quot;. She gave additional praise to the performances of the cast.

Fenella Kernebone for SBS noted &quot;&quot;Somersault&quot; is a real labour of love for Cate Shortland and every element in the film is carefully considered.&quot; Kernebone awarded the film four stars out of five. &quot;Somersault&quot; premiered at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival, where it was screened as part of the Un Certain Regard and was the only Australian feature film at the festival that year.

<text>Acropomatidae is a family of ray-finned fish in the order Acropomatiformes, commonly known as lanternbellies. &quot;Acropoma&quot; species are notable for having light-emitting organs along their undersides. They are found in all temperate and tropical oceans, usually at depths of several hundred meters. There are about 32 species in as many as 9 genera, although some authorities recognise fewer genera than Fishbase does.

Members of the family are generally small, with some ranging up to 40 cm, but most no more than 15 cm. They have two dorsal fins, the first with seven to 10 spines and the second with possibly a spine in addition to eight to 10 soft rays. The anal fin has two or three spines, and the pelvic fins one spine and five soft rays.

==Timeline of genera==

==Genera==
The following nine genera are currently placed within the family Acropomatidae:

* &quot;Acropoma&quot; 
* &quot;Apogonops&quot; 
* &quot;Caraibops&quot; 
* &quot;Doederleinia&quot; 
* &quot;Kaperangus&quot; 
* &quot;Malakichthys&quot; 
* &quot;Neoscombrops&quot; 
* &quot;Parascombrops&quot; 
* &quot;Synagrops&quot; 
* &quot;Verilus&quot; 

The 5th edition of &quot;Fishes of the World&quot; lists seven valid genera while the &quot;Catalog of Fishes&quot; only recognises five.

==Taxonomy==
The Acriopomatidae is placed in the order Perciformes, the suborder Percoidei and the superfamily Percoidea in the 5th edition of &quot;Fishes of the World&quot;. However, during the 21st Century molecular studies have indicated that a variety of mainly deep-sea fishes which were traditionally placed in the Perciformes, including the Acropomatidae, and in the Trachiniformes in fact from a newly recognised clade which has been named either the Acropomatiformes or Pempheriformes. Within the Acropomatidae phylogenetic work has suggested that the genera &quot;Acropoma&quot; and &quot;Doederleinia&quot; are separate from the other genera in the traditional arrangement of the family with two other recognised lineages being placed in the separate families Malakichthyidae and Synagropidae.

This classification would be as follows:

* Acropmatidae
** &quot;Acropoma&quot;
** &quot;Doederleinia&quot;
* Malakichthyidae
** &quot;Apogonops&quot;
** &quot;Neoscombrops&quot;
** &quot;Malakichthys&quot;
** &quot;Verilus&quot;
* Synagropidae
** &quot;Caraibops&quot;
** &quot;Kaperangus&quot;
** &quot;Parascombrops&quot;
** &quot;Synagrops&quot;

<doc id="1013289" wikidata="Q5106" url="?curid=1013289" title="A Love Supreme">
<text>A Love Supreme is an album by the jazz saxophonist and composer John Coltrane. He recorded it in one session on December 9, 1964, at Van Gelder Studio in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, leading a quartet featuring pianist McCoy Tyner, bassist Jimmy Garrison and drummer Elvin Jones.

&quot;A Love Supreme&quot; was released by Impulse! Records in January 1965. It ranks among Coltrane&#x27;s best-selling albums and is widely considered a masterpiece.

==Composition==

&quot;A Love Supreme&quot; is a through-composed suite in four parts: &quot;Acknowledgement&quot; (which includes the oral chant that gives the album its name), &quot;Resolution&quot;, &quot;Pursuance&quot;, and &quot;Psalm&quot;. Coltrane plays tenor saxophone on all parts. One critic has written that the album was intended to represent a struggle for purity, an expression of gratitude, and an acknowledgement that the musician&#x27;s talent comes from a higher power. The album’s improvisational and spiritual intensity has led some to liken it to glossolalia, or speaking in tongues, as it conveys a profound sense of ecstatic devotion. This sacred quality has led it to become the “central text” of the Saint John Coltrane African Orthodox Church in San Francisco. Coltrane&#x27;s home in Dix Hills, Long Island, may have inspired the album. Another influence may have been Ahmadiyya Islam.

The album begins with the bang of a gong (tam-tam) and cymbal washes on the first track, &quot;Acknowledgement&quot;. Jimmy Garrison enters on double bass with the four-note motif that lays the foundation of the movement. Coltrane begins a solo. He plays variations on the motif until he repeats the four notes thirty-six times. The motif then becomes the vocal chant &quot;a love supreme&quot;, sung by Coltrane accompanying himself through overdubs nineteen times. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, this movement&#x27;s four-note theme is &quot;the humble foundation of the suite&quot;.

In the fourth and final movement, &quot;Psalm&quot;, Coltrane performs what he calls a &quot;musical narration&quot;. Lewis Porter calls it a &quot;wordless recitation&quot;. The devotional is included in the liner notes. Coltrane &quot;plays&quot; the words of the poem on saxophone but doesn&#x27;t speak them. Some scholars have suggested that this performance is an homage to the sermons of African-American preachers. The poem (and, in his own way, Coltrane&#x27;s solo) ends with the cry, &quot;Elation. Elegance. Exaltation. All from God. Thank you God. Amen.&quot;

&quot;A Love Supreme&quot; was categorized by &quot;Rockdelux&quot; as modal jazz, avant-garde jazz, free jazz, hard bop, and post-bop.

==Other performances==
An alternative version of &quot;Acknowledgement&quot; was recorded the next day on December 10 with tenor saxophonist Archie Shepp and a second bassist, Art Davis. This version omitted Coltrane chanting &quot;a love supreme&quot;; he preferred the quartet version with the chant, placing that on the issued album. There are two known live recordings of the &quot;Love Supreme&quot; suite. For years the only known live recording of the &quot;Love Supreme&quot; suite was of a performance at the Festival Mondial du Jazz Antibes in Juan-les-Pins, France, on July 26, 1965. On October 29, 2002, the album was reissued as a remastered deluxe edition by Impulse! Records with this live performance and the alternate takes on a bonus disc. A further iteration with more studio breakdowns and overdubs was issued as a three-disc complete masters edition released by Impulse! on November 20, 2015. The other known live recording of the suite was recorded October 2, 1965, at The Penthouse in Seattle. The set was recorded by saxophonist Joe Brazil. This live performance was released on October 22, 2021, by Impulse! as &quot;A Love Supreme: Live in Seattle&quot;.

==Reception and legacy==

Released in January 1965 by Impulse! Records, &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; became one of the most acclaimed jazz records, and contemporary critics hailed it as one of the important albums of post-war jazz. By 1970, it had sold about 500,000 copies, far exceeding Coltrane&#x27;s usual sales of 30,000, although it never charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It has since been regarded as Coltrane&#x27;s masterpiece and is &quot;without question Coltrane&#x27;s most beloved album&quot;, according to Robert Christgau, who adds that it &quot;cemented &#x27;Trane&#x27;s divine status in Japan&quot;.
&quot;A Love Supreme&quot; was widely recognized as a work of deep spirituality and analyzed with religious subtext, although cultural studies scholars Richard W. Santana and Gregory Erickson argued that the &quot;avant-garde jazz suite&quot; could be interpreted otherwise. According to music professor Ingrid Monson of Harvard University, the album was an exemplary recording of modal jazz. Nick Dedina wrote on the Rhapsody web site that the music ranged from free jazz and hard bop to sui generis gospel music in &quot;an epic aural poem to man&#x27;s place in God&#x27;s plan&quot;. Calling it a &quot;legendary album-long hymn of praise&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said that &quot;Coltrane&#x27;s majestic, often violent blowing (famously described as &#x27;sheets of sound&#x27;) is never self-aggrandizing&quot; and that he is &quot;aloft with his classic quartet&quot;, &quot;soar[ing] with nothing but gratitude and joy&quot; on a compelling journey for listeners. &quot;The Rolling Stone Jazz Record Guide&quot; (1985) said that &quot;each man performs with eloquence and economy&quot;, while calling the album &quot;the masterpiece from the quartet&#x27;s studio work&quot;, &quot;the first comprehensive statement of Coltrane&#x27;s spiritual concerns&quot;, and &quot;the cornerstone of many Coltrane collections&quot;. On the other hand, jazz critic Tom Hull said that he has not much considered the album &quot;spiritual&quot; but rather &quot;the most perfectly plotted single piece of jazz ever recorded&quot;.

&quot;A Love Supreme&quot; has appeared on professional listings of the greatest albums. In 2003, it was ranked number 47 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time; maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list, re-ranking at number 66 in a 2020 reboot of the list. &quot;NME&quot; ranked it number 188 on a similar list in 2013. The manuscript for the album was included in the National Museum of American History&#x27;s &quot;Treasures of American History&quot; collection at the Smithsonian Institution. In 2015, the album was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry due to its &quot;cultural, historic, or artistic significance.&quot; It is Coltrane&#x27;s second album to be included after &quot;Giant Steps&quot; in 2005. It was included in Robert Dimery&#x27;s &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. It was voted number 85 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000).

According to Joachim-Ernst Berendt, the album&#x27;s hymn-like quality permeated modern jazz and rock music. As Christgau explains, the record was &quot;adored by American hippies from the Byrds and Carlos Santana on down, and served as theme music to Lester Bangs&#x27;s wake at CBGB&quot;. Musicians such as Joshua Redman and U2, who mention the album in their song &quot;Angel of Harlem&quot;, have mentioned the influence of the album on their own work. Both Santana and fellow guitarist John McLaughlin have called the album one of their biggest early influences and recorded &quot;Love Devotion Surrender&quot; in 1973 as a tribute. &quot;Every so often this ceases to be a jazz record and is more avant-garde contemporary classical,&quot; said Neil Hannon of the band The Divine Comedy. &quot;I love the combination of abstract piano that&#x27;s all sort of &#x27;clang&#x27;, and weird chords with wailing saxophone over the top.&quot;

In &quot;The Penguin Guide to Jazz&quot;, Richard Cook and Brian Morton gave &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; a rare &quot;crown&quot; rating but asked whether it was &quot;the greatest jazz album of the modern period..or the most overrated?&quot; Miles Davis, Coltrane&#x27;s former bandleader, said the record &quot;reached out and influenced those people who were into peace. Hippies and people like that&quot;.
Christgau, writing in 2020, said, &quot;it&#x27;s meditative rather than freewheeling, with each member of his classic quartet instructed to embark on his own harmonically mapped excursion and the title set to a chanted four-note melody you could hum in your sleep. I&#x27;m on my fourth consecutive play with no signs of tune fatigue as I write, plus my wife loves it. All true, all remarkable. But how much you value it, I expect, depends on how much faith you place in your own spirituality.&quot; He concluded that the next time he will listen to the album &quot;may well depend on who dies when&quot;.

<text>The driftwood catfishes are catfishes of the family Auchenipteridae. The two genera of the former family Ageneiosidae have been placed here, resulting in a grouping of about 125 species in about 22 genera.

These fish are found in rivers from Panama to Argentina, commonly in river flood plains.

All but one species have three pairs of barbels, with the nasal barbels absent. Most species have very small adipose fins. While &quot;Ageneiosus inermis&quot;, also known as the fidalgo, is known to reach in length, most are small, with some species not known at any longer than . The eggs are fertilised internally.

Driftwood catfishes are nocturnal. Some of the smaller species are known to hide in logs and crevices during the day, and come out to feed at night. Some larger species can consume fruits and insects, and are probably omnivorous. Fish of this family seem to feed primarily on insects, but also eat fish, shrimp, fruit, and even filamentous algae and other plant material, at least occasionally.

<text>The SAR 21 (&quot;Singapore Assault Rifle - 21st Century&quot;) is a bullpup assault rifle designed and manufactured in Singapore, chambered for the 5.56x45mm cartridge. First revealed and subsequently adopted by the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) as its standard service weapon in 1999, it was designed and developed over a four-year period to replace the locally license-built M16S1 by the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF), Singapore Army and the former Chartered Industries of Singapore (CIS), presently ST Engineering Land Systems.

Many of its design features are directly intended to address the weaknesses of the M16S1 as encountered operationally by some infantrymen. The rifle is being sold for export use aside from domestic use. In the United States, it was marketed by ST Kinetics via its American subsidiary, VT Systems.

==History==
Since the mid-80s, the SAF had an outstanding requirement to replace the M16S1, in use since 1973, in part due to licensing limitations that prevented Singapore from exporting the M16S1 or making new assault rifles based on it. In 1994, a proposal by the SAF was submitted to MINDEF for options to either procure new weapons (thought was given to purchase the M16A2) or to develop an indigenous rifle. On 19 November 2002, a patent was filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office by Tuck Wah Chee and Felix Tsai with the patent number 6,481,144 B1.

MINDEF officials, after consultations with the SAF, decided against buying weapons off the shelf as it would require soldiers to adjust to the new weapon, choosing instead to develop a weapon, designed and made specifically for ease of use by conscript soldiers of the SAF, who are mostly of slighter physiques. Coupled with the rising costs of maintaining the M16S1s, this made it more justifiable to develop a low-maintenance weapon.

In 2009, criminal charges were filed against former Indian Ordnance Factory Board director Sudipta Ghosh for corruption, among the allegations were an improper partnership with STK over supplying Indian law enforcement with the SAR 21 Modular Mounting System. STK and several foreign firms involved were blacklisted by the Indian Defence Ministry.

On February 19, 2024, the Next Generation SAR (Singapore Assault Rifle) was unveiled by ST Engineering at the Singapore Airshow 2024 event.

==Design==
The SAR 21&#x27;s furniture is made of a rugged, high impact polymer, much of the manufacturing is done utilising CNC machines, with ultrasonic welding for the steel-reinforced receiver halves and the gun barrel being cold hammer forged. It has a long stroke gas system and a two-lug Stoner-style bolt, boasting high reliability. The translucent magazine allows precise assessment of its current ammo load.

The SAR 21 has a built-in Laser Aiming Device (powered by a single &quot;AA-size&quot; battery) which has a 5 position switch that emits a visible or infrared beam at high or low power. It can be set to a steady beam or a momentary beam that is triggered by a pressure switch activated with the user&#x27;s left thumb. The rifle incorporates various patented safety features, such as a Kevlar cheek plate and a high pressure vent that protects the shooter in the event of a chamber explosion or catastrophic failure.

The integral 1.5x optical scope that is built into its carrying handle aids in target acquisition, particularly under low light conditions. The scope is factory-zeroed, and requires minimal further zeroing to suit different users, shortening non-training range time.

===Design issues===
Early users of the weapon in the Singapore Armed Forces experienced many problems due to their unfamiliarity with the bullpup design. Their criticisms (usually compared to the M16S1 rifles they were trained with) include:

*the awkward position of the fire selector (located at the butt, with the action), as opposed to the thumb selector on the M16S1
*the sluggish trigger pull compared with the crisp trigger of the M16S1
*the heavy weight of the weapon
*the increased muzzle blast, due to the muzzle being nearer to the user&#x27;s ears
*being told by instructors that it is a &quot;right-handed only&quot; weapon and left-handed soldiers having to (and are still being taught to) fire with their right hand
*iron sights that chip off easily when weapon is dropped
*lack of internal illumination of the scope (the crosshairs in the scope are virtually invisible in the dark)

Some of these criticisms were addressed with design modifications to the later production models. New weapon handling procedures were also introduced.
*The magazine changing issue was solved with training soldiers to always hold the pistol grip with their master hand. The charging of the weapon and reloading of magazines are to be done by the non-master hand.
*The sluggish trigger pull was improved by using a stiff sliding plate in place of the flexible rod.
*The Steyr AUG styled iron sights were replaced with stockier, hardier ones.

The Kevlar plating on the left side of the weapon butt (where a right-handed user&#x27;s face would typically be) is effective in protecting the user from any internal chamber explosion by directing the resulting force to the right. However, that resultant force would also seriously injure anyone on the right side of the weapon. In the case of a user firing from their left shoulder, this could cause severe injury to their face. As a result, all left-handed SAF soldiers are taught to fire from their right shoulder as a safety measure. The SAR 21 was designed with a small built-in brass deflector to eject spent bullet casings forward, thus reducing the chances of the spent casings hitting a left-handed user&#x27;s face. The rifle is not completely ambidextrous but may be fired from the left shoulder.

===Operation===
Like the M16 rifle, the bolt locks open on an empty magazine. When the magazine is exhausted, it is removed by depressing the catch lever. Clearing the weapon is accomplished by removing the magazine, pulling the charging handle to the rear, and observing the chamber. After loading a magazine into the housing, the weapon is made &quot;ready&quot; by cocking the weapon, and engaging the cross-bolt safety button forward of the trigger guard. The position of the fire selector button (SEMI or AUTO) on the stock may also be adjusted.

The on/off switch for the laser aiming device is located on the left handguard; when holding the weapon at ready, the left thumb rests naturally on it. With sluggish operation due to fouling, the gas regulator setting may be adjusted by turning it with a coin, screwdriver, or any other thin flat object. Alternatively, the gas regulator can be unlatched and turned by hand with aid of its knurled surface.

<doc id="1013306" wikidata="Q2367382" url="?curid=1013306" title="Ultimax 100">
<text>The Ultimax 100 is a Singapore-made 5.56mm light machine gun, developed by the Chartered Industries of Singapore (CIS, now ST Kinetics) by a team of engineers under the guidance of American firearms designer L. James Sullivan. The weapon is extremely accurate due to its constant-recoil operating system and is one of the lightest machine guns in the world.

Work on a new light support weapon for the Singapore Army began in 1978. The weapon is produced by CIS (presently STK—Singapore Technologies Kinetics), initially in the Mark 1 version, later—the Mark 2, and currently, in the Mark 3 and Mark 4 variant. The Ultimax 100 (also called the U 100) is used in significant numbers by the armed forces of Singapore, Croatia and the Philippines. The Mark 3 variant is currently used in the Singapore Armed Forces primarily as a support arm, and is both classified and known by soldiers as the SAW (Squad Automatic Weapon).

==Design details==
The Ultimax 100 is a gas-operated automatic weapon (capable of fully automatic fire only) with a short-stroke gas piston operating system powered by ignited powder gases diverted from the barrel through a port in the gas block. The Ultimax 100 is a locked breech weapon with a rotating bolt that contains seven locking lugs. It fires from an open bolt position. The bolt contains both a spring extractor and a casing ejector. The weapon&#x27;s non-reciprocating cocking handle is located on the left side of the receiver and occupies the forward position during firing. The Ultimax 100 is striker-fired.

The feature that grants the weapon its low recoil (compared to similar light machine guns) is the &quot;constant recoil&quot; principle. The overall design allows the bolt carrier group to travel all the way back without ever impacting the rear, instead stopping gradually along the axis of movement against the resistance of the return springs. Jane&#x27;s International Defence Review correspondent—Andrew Tillman, in an exclusive invitation from ST Kinetics to participate in the Product Improvement Program (PIP, initiated in 1989) to test fire the gun, elaborated:
The magazine catch consists of two tapered pins on a bar, controlled by the magazine release button. The machine gun feeds from a proprietary 100-round synthetic drum magazine (early models also used 60-round drum magazines), or from a modified 20 or 30-round STANAG 4179 magazine (from the M16 rifle). An unusual feature among modern machine guns is the fact the Ultimax was purposely designed to feed from magazines as opposed to belts.

The Ultimax 100 uses a manual safety mechanism that consists of a lever installed on the left side of the receiver (just behind the trigger) with two possible settings: &quot;S&quot;, indicating the weapon is safe, and &quot;F&quot;, continuous fire. An internal safety achieved through the proper arrangement of parts and mechanisms secures against premature detonation. The light machine gun was also designed to mount an M16-type bayonet and either day or night-time optics. The Ultimax 100&#x27;s ergonomics are similar to that of the Thompson submachine gun, specifically the forward grip.

Widespread adoption of the design might have been compromised by its feed system. The original Ultimax 100 was meant to be used with a drum magazine holding 100 rounds. The drum magazine was bulky and difficult to reload without a special mechanism. The shape of the drum magazine also occupied more space compared to M16 magazines or the FN Minimi box holding a belt of 200 rounds. The machine gunner also could not take magazines from other squad members who were equipped with M16s.

M16 magazines were subsequently modified to allow them to be used with the production model Ultimax 100. This was done by drilling two holes right at the left feeding lip of the magazine. This improved the handiness of the weapon and allowed magazines to be loaded in the field.

The system was modified to use only STANAG compatible magazines in the Mk 4 version of the design, which was submitted for the USMC Infantry Automatic Rifle competition. This meant the original drum could no longer be used, making the design closer to the IAR than a light machine gun. This has been rectified in the latest Mk 5 variant which allows the usage of the Beta C-Mag.

==Variants==
* Mark 1: Model with a quick-change barrel (pre-production).
* Mark 2: Equipped with a fixed barrel.
* Mark 3/3A: Quick-change barrel. Currently the Mark 3 variant is available in two different barrel lengths, a standard and short. The short barrel is designed for use with paratroopers and special forces. There is also an optional VIP protection barrel. The barrel on all versions has a slotted flash suppressor and a carrying handle used to transport the weapon and assist in barrel removal. The Ultimax Mark 3 has a three-position gas regulator (early models had a five-position gas adjustment valve) that allows the rate of fire to be controlled and enables reliable operation in various environmental conditions. The gas regulator is usually pre-adjusted prior to operations. Where there is sluggish operation due to fouling, the gas setting may be increased by two clicks using the provided C-tool. The weapon features a standard pistol grip, a vertical forward grip integrated into the forend and a detachable buttstock. The mild felt recoil allows the weapon to be used effectively without the buttstock, using only the pistol and forward grips to support and aim the firearm. The adjustable bipod has a height adjustment mechanism and is secured to the weapon&#x27;s forend, providing stability in a sustained-fire role. The bipod is quick-detachable and can be mounted or removed without the use of tools. The Ultimax 100 features an aperture type rear sight (with range settings for distances up to 1,200 m, graduated every 100 m) placed on a sliding scale and a forward vertical post housed in the front sight base and protected by two metal tabs. The weapon incorporates sheet metal stamping and the use of synthetic components in its design. The drum magazine, buttstock, pistol grip and forend with vertical grip are all made of an impact-resistant polymer. The Mark 3/3A can fire both the American 5.56×45mm M193 cartridge (with 1:12 (305 mm) twist barrel fitted) or the heavier SS109/M855 cartridge (178 mm (1:7 in) twist rate barrel).
* Mark 4: Developed for the United States Marine Corps Infantry Automatic Rifle program, with the addition of a new fire selector module. The Marine Corps did not select the Ultimax and chose an automatic rifle based on the HK416.
* Mark 5: Updated variant of the Mark 4 with a folding stock, Picatinny rails and M16 STANAG 4179 magazine well that will accept 30-round box magazines and the 100-round Beta C-Mag drum.
* STK also developed a vehicle-mounted variant of the weapon for use on the Bronco All Terrain Tracked Carrier and on the Spider Light Strike Vehicle.
* Mark 8: New variant unveiled at the 2012 Singapore Airshow.

<text>Ikram Antaki (July 9, 1948 – October 31, 2000) was a Syrian-Mexican writer.

==Biography==
Antaki was born in Damascus, Syria. Her grandfather served as the last governor of Antioch. At the age of four, she entered a French language Franciscan school, where she remained until obtaining her baccalaureate. Later, she emigrated to France to study comparative literature, social anthropology, and ethnology of the Arab world at the University of Paris VII. In 1975, in her own words, she decided to travel &quot;to the end of the earth,&quot; choosing Mexico as the most distant possible place from her native Damascus. She eventually became a Mexican citizen and lived there for the rest of her life.

Antaki published 29 books in Spanish, French, and Arabic. During her time in Mexico she collaborated with Mexican television channels 11 and 13 and gained popularity due to her participation on &quot;Monitor&quot; radio news show, one of the most popular in the central region of the country. Her opinions were rather unorthodox: on several occasions she remarked that the generation of youth that participated in the movement of 1968 had been the poorest intellectually of 20th-century Mexico, that democracy had no place in the family or the school, and that plebiscites were a fascist invention.

Those who have written about her describe her as an extremely reserved person. She never learned to dance or to swim. Her readers, on the other hand, note the lightheartedness of her writings and lectures, the profundity of her investigations and her own originality.

She died October 31, 2000, in Mexico City, survived by one son, the Mexican author .

<text>Karl Erik Tore Johansson (19 October 1903 – 12 May 1971), better known by the stage name Tor Johnson, was a Swedish professional wrestler and actor. As an actor, Johnson appeared in many B-movies, including some famously directed by Ed Wood. In professional wrestling, Johnson was billed as Thor Johnson and Super Swedish Angel.

==Early life==
Johnson was born on 19 October 1903 in Brännkyrka, Stockholms län, Sweden, the son of Karl Johan Johansson and Lovisa Kristina Pettersson. His death certificate and grave list 1903 as the year of his birth, contradicting published genealogy records.

==Career==

Johnson stood and weighed at his heaviest. He had a full head of blond hair, but shaved it to maintain an imposing and villainous appearance in his wrestling and acting work. He began getting bit parts in films upon moving to California, usually as the strongman or weightlifter, as early as 1934. In the same year, Johnson was one of over 50 wrestlers who took part in a two-month Los Angeles tournament for California&#x27;s version of the world title. His film career ended in the early 1960s, after he appeared in a string of low-budget, poorly-rated films. However, he continued to make appearances on television and made a number of commercials.

Tor Johnson used the ring name Super Swedish Angel to distinguish himself from Nils Phillip Olafsson who used the ring name Swedish Angel. The name was derived from wrestler Maurice Tillet, known as The French Angel.

During his career as an actor, Johnson befriended director Ed Wood, who directed him in a number of films, including &quot;Bride of the Monster&quot; and &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot;; writing for Turner Classic Movies, film critic Donald Liebenson described Johnson&#x27;s performance in &quot;Plan 9&quot; as &quot;gonzo.&quot; Johnson was very friendly to work with; actress Valda Hansen, who worked with Johnson in 1959&#x27;s &quot;Night of the Ghouls&quot;, described him as &quot;like a big sugar bun.&quot; During this period, Johnson appeared as a guest contestant on the quiz show &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;, during which he showed the show&#x27;s host, Groucho Marx, his &quot;scariest face.&quot; Marx ran off the stage in mock terror, then returned and pleaded: &quot;Don&#x27;t make that face again!&quot;

==Death and legacy==
Johnson died of heart failure in San Fernando, California, at the age of 67 andis buried at Eternal Valley Memorial Park, in Santa Clarita, California.

Johnson was portrayed by wrestler George &quot;The Animal&quot; Steele in Tim Burton&#x27;s film &quot;Ed Wood&quot; (1994).

Johnson was featured extensively in the early work of cartoonist Drew Friedman, where Johnson was depicted as &quot;Tor&quot;, a slow-witted, white-eyed lummox based on Johnson&#x27;s persona in Ed Wood&#x27;s films. The first of the one-page comics, &quot;Tor Johnson at Home&quot;, was published in a 1981 issue of Robert Crumb&#x27;s &quot;Weirdo&quot;, and the original artwork was purchased by television writer and producer Eddie Gorodetsky.

A latex mask based on Johnson&#x27;s face, sculpted by Pat Newman for Don Post Studios, is described as &quot;the best-selling Halloween horror mask of the late 1960s-early 1970s&quot;.

<text>The Ace &quot;Baby Ace&quot;, a single-seat, single-engine, parasol wing, fixed-gear light airplane, was marketed as a homebuilt aircraft when its plans were first offered for sale in 1929 — one of the first homebuilt aircraft plans available in the United States. Plans are still available and Baby Aces are still being built. Orland Corben designed a series of aircraft for the Ace Aircraft Manufacturing Company, the Baby Ace, Junior Ace, and Super Ace. Corben&#x27;s name was associated with the aircraft, and it is commonly known as the &quot;Corben Baby Ace&quot;.

==Design==
===Original===
The Baby Ace is a single-seat parasol wing monoplane of conventional taildragger configuration. Individual examples have been configured with tricycle landing gear.

The wing uses a Clark Y-cross-section airfoil; spars and ribs are spruce. The steel-tube parallel wings struts simplified internal wing structure, and enabled the wings to fold back for over-the-road towing.

The fuselage is of fabric-covered tubular construction, and wing struts are steel tube. There is a door in the right side. Streamlining and fairing was largely done with balsa wood.

Its landing gear is a split-axle type, with bungee cord suspension, similar to gear of the Piper Cub. Some are fitted with brakes, using Aeronca-type heel pedals.

===Evolutions===

Under the Corben Sport Plane and Supply Co. (Peru, Indiana), two versions were offered, using the same wings, tails, controls and landing gear: a single-seat. open-cockpit, parasol-wing model (the Baby Ace) and an enclosed, two-seat, high-wing version (Junior Ace).

In 1955 Paul Poberezny, founder of the Experimental Aircraft Association, redesigned the plane with Stan J. Dzik (former Waco Aircraft engineer), calling its version the Model C. EAA sold the rights to the planes to Cliff DuCharme (West Bend, Wisconsin), and the plane was redesigned for production, becoming the Model D (first flight: November 15, 1956). The similarly redesigned two-seat Junior Ace, became the Junior Ace Model E.

===Powerplants===
The first example flew with a Heath-Henderson B-4 modified motorcycle engine. However, a detachable motor mount accommodated an easy change of engines.

Later models utilized various engines -- facilitated by the removeable motor mount -- including the 45-hp Szekely SR-3, 40-hp Salmson AD9, 35-hp Continental A-40, or 30-hp Heath B4. A variety of aircraft powerplants may be used, typically in the 65-100 hp (50-75 kW) range. Most versions flying today use the Continental A65 aircraft engine. Examples have been built using 70 hp Corvair engines.

==Operational history==
The original Baby Ace was built in 1929, in Topeka, Kansas. Designer O.G. (&quot;Ace&quot;) Corben later established the Corben Sportplane Company (Madison, Wisconsin), where six Baby Aces were built, with kits also sold.

The Corben Sport Plane and Supply Co. (Peru, Indiana), began producing the Baby Ace both in kit form and as a complete, flying aircraft. Kits included pre-welded assemblies for the fuselage, controls, tail and landing gear. Two models were offered, using the same wings, tails, controls and landing gear: a single-seat. open-cockpit, parasol-wing model, and an enclosed, two-seat, high-wing version.

In America, state and federal laws banned homebuilding and flight in the uncertified designs by 1938. In 1948, Experimental aircraft were allowed to be built again in America.

In 1952, EAA founder Paul Poberezny bought the rights to the Ace designs for $200, and produced a sub-$800 Baby Ace that was featured in &quot;Mechanix Illustrated&quot; (; some say &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;). The series of articles were in conjunction with a CAA effort to revitalize American aviation by promoting amateur built aircraft. The articles drew intense national interest, resulting in hundreds of the planes being built, with various engines—and elevating then-obscure EAA to national prominence.

To avoid compromising its non-profit status, EAA sold the rights to the planes to Cliff DuCharme (West Bend, Wisconsin), who resumed kit production, with a revised Model D (first flight: November 15, 1956). and a revised Junior Ace Model E.

Subsequently, plans, parts, and kits for both the Baby Ace and Junior Ace became available from Thurman Baird&#x27;s Ace Aircraft Manufacturing Company (Asheville, North Carolina). &quot;Progressive&quot; kits (buy sections as you build) also became available. and remain so, as of 2015.

In 1974, aviation historians John Underwood and Peter Bowers reported 200 Baby Aces were flying, with only one prewar example still active. They noted that only a very few of the Junior Aces had been built before the 1930s CAA crackdown on amateur-built aircraft, with just two of the 1930s two-seaters still flying. However, in 1979, aviation journalist Don Dwiggins estimated the number of flying Baby Aces in the United States and Canada had dwindled to around 70.

A 1958 Baby Ace is currently the oldest Canadian homebuilt aircraft flying.

<text>Sir Gerald David Nunes Nabarro (29 June 1913 – 18 November 1973) was a British businessman and Conservative Party politician who was an MP from 1950 until his death. Nabarro positioned himself on the right of the Conservative Party. Though he never left the backbenches, he was a comparatively high-profile political figure, owing in large part to his eccentric personal style.

==Early life==
Nabarro was born in Willesden Green, Middlesex, the son of Solomon Nunes Nabarro, a retail tobacconist who went bankrupt in 1921, and his wife Lena (died 1921), née Drucquer. He was born to a prominent Sephardi Jewish family, but later converted to Christianity. Until age 14, he was educated at London County Council schools.

==Career==
Nabarro left school at 14, and ran away from home into the Merchant Navy. He later enlisted in the British Army&#x27;s King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps in 1930, rising to the rank of staff sergeant instructor. After some self-education, he was accepted for commissioning as an officer, but believed he had insufficient private means and, having served his time, he was honourably discharged in 1937. He went into the timber-supply industry, where he made his fortune, able to later claim to have served in every grade from labourer to managing director.

He also served in the Territorial Army from 1937, and at the start of the Second World War, he was commissioned as an officer in the Royal Artillery. During the war, he was seconded for special industrial production processes in the United Kingdom. He left full-time military service in favour of industrial employment in 1943, but remained on the Reserve of Officers until 1946.

Nabarro served among many positions outside industry and parliament, including as: a Governor of the University of Birmingham and Convocation Member at Aston University; President of the Road Passenger and Transport Association 1951–55; the Merseyside area of the National Union of Manufacturers 1956–62; the London branch of the Institute of Marketing 1968–70; and the British Direct Mail Marketing Association 1968–72.

Nabarro was also interested in the revival of the Severn Valley Railway (which was partly in his former Kidderminster constituency), and his fascination with the SVR served as the basis of two of his books, &quot;Severn Valley Steam&quot; and &quot;Steam Nostalgia&quot;. In early 1972, he persuaded the SVR, of which he became chairman, to allow him to raise the money to buy the line from Hampton Loade to Foley Park by means of a share issue in a newly created public limited company, Severn Valley Railway (Holdings) Ltd—of which he was also the chairman. Nabarro’s new company then “became responsible for the policy and financial decisions affecting the whole railway, and specifically for financing the purchase of the southern extension from Alveley to Foley Park.” The share issue took place, but after SVR volunteers discovered he planned to sell the Bridgnorth railway station site for hotel and housing development and bring business friends from outside onto the board, it led to a threatened strike by the railway&#x27;s volunteer staff, and his proposals were thrown out at a heated annual general meeting (AGM). Nabarro resigned from the board of directors in May 1973.

==Political career==
At the 1945 general election, Nabarro stood as the Conservative candidate in the Labour-held West Bromwich constituency. The seat was comfortably held by Labour&#x27;s John Dugdale, with a swing of 18.6%, much higher than the national average of 10%.

In the general election of 1950, Nabarro was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Kidderminster, Worcestershire, which he held until 1964. He then retired on health grounds.

Given a clean bill of health later, he was selected as Conservative candidate for the safer constituency of South Worcestershire, neighbouring his old constituency, after the previous MP, Sir Peter Agnew, had retired. He duly won the seat in the 1966 general election, and represented it until he died in office in November 1973. No by-election was held after his death; the seat was still vacant when Parliament was dissolved on 8 February 1974 for the general election later that month.

Through his career, he was the sponsor of various pieces of legislation, claiming credit for the Coroners Act 1954; the Clean Air Act 1956; Thermal Insulation (Industrial Buildings) Act 1957; Oil Burners (Standards) Act 1960; and the introduction of government health warnings on cigarette packets in 1971. He unsuccessfully proposed an amendment to the Life Peerages Bill in 1958 that would have allowed hereditary peers to renounce their peerages, and seek election to sit in the House of Commons. When Anthony Wedgwood-Benn, a Labour MP, sought to do that when forced to vacate his seat at the death of his father, Viscount Stansgate, in 1960, Nabarro was his chief Conservative supporter in the Commons, and the two sponsored the Peerage Act 1963. Subsequently, the act enabled Wedgwood-Benn to re-enter the Commons, and the Earl of Home to do the same when he became Prime Minister in the same year as Sir Alec Douglas-Home. However, that renunciation was perchance, when an unexpected ill-health change of Prime Minister occurred, as renouncement was only permitted within one year of inheritance of a peerage (or within one year after becoming 21 years of age if inheritance occurred before the age of 21 years), or within one year of the start of the Act, or within one month for an inheritor being a Member of the House of Commons.

Nabarro was made a Knight Bachelor for political and public services in the 1963 New Years Honours list.

==Style==
Nabarro characterised himself as an old-style Tory: he opposed the European Economic Community project, as well as drugs, pop music, and pornography, and was critical of students. He was a supporter of capital punishment, and backed Enoch Powell following the latter&#x27;s &quot;Rivers of Blood&quot; speech. Even five years earlier, on 5 April 1963, while appearing on &quot;Any Questions?&quot;, Nabarro asked, &quot;How would you feel if your daughter wanted to marry a big buck nigger with the prospect of coffee-coloured grandchildren?&quot;—remarks which were excised from a repeat of the programme the following week.

Despite humble beginnings, Nabarro had the style of a conservative toff, sporting a Jimmy Edwards-style handlebar moustache, a booming baritone voice, and a Terry-Thomas accent. He enjoyed driving, and owned the personalised number plates NAB 1 to 8, which he attached to his large garage of cars, including three Daimlers. He considered that a Conservative candidate&#x27;s car should be substantial, but not too substantial, and did not own Rolls-Royces or Bentleys.

==Personal life==
On 1 June 1943, Nabarro married Joan Maud Violet im Thurn, the elder daughter of Colonel Bernhardt Basil von Brumsey im Thurn, DSO, of Winchester, a British Army officer of Austrian ancestry. They had two sons and two daughters. His wife survived him and died in 2009.

==Later years==
On the night of 21 May 1971, Nabarro&#x27;s car, a Daimler Sovereign bearing the number plate &quot;NAB 1,&quot; was seen to swerve at speed the wrong way round a roundabout at Totton, Hampshire. It was occupied by Nabarro and his company secretary, Margaret Mason. The police charged him as the driver, but Nabarro insisted it was his secretary, who agreed with his story. During the trial, Nabarro testified that he had spent the week leading up to the accident attending “a meeting of the women’s advisory committee of the New Forest Conservatives at the Grand Hotel in Lyndhurst.” Nabarro stated that he was exhausted from working long hours at the weeklong conference, and after seeing that her employer needed rest, Mrs. Mason had offered to drive the return journey. Despite Mrs. Mason’s testimony that she had been driving while Nabarro slept, a witness positively identified Nabarro as the driver, and he was found guilty by a jury at Winchester Crown Court; the judge pronounced his behaviour &quot;outrageous,&quot; and imposed the penalties of a £250 fine and disqualification from driving for two years. He announced his appeal on the court steps immediately afterwards, accompanied by his private secretary, Christine Holman. Nabarro suffered two strokes in the following year, and was cleared in the delayed second trial, after four new witnesses testified that they had seen a woman driving.

In 1999, &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper speculated that the jury had brought in their verdict to spare Nabarro the horrors of a perjury trial. In response, his son stated that the other occupant was employed as his driver and not as his secretary. He added that his father suffered from diabetes, and had hardly driven for some years before the dangerous driving allegation at his doctor&#x27;s orders. A few months later, having recently announced a decision to retire from the Commons on grounds of health, he died at his home, Orchard House, in Broadway, Worcestershire on 18 November 1973, aged 60. He had suffered a cerebral haemorrhage the week prior.

<doc id="1013331" wikidata="Q5156692" url="?curid=1013331" title="Component Manager">
<text>In Apple Macintosh computer programming, Component Manager was one of many approaches to sharing code that originated on the pre-PowerPC Macintosh. It was originally introduced as part of QuickTime, which remained the part of the classic Mac OS that used it most heavily.

== Technical details ==
A &quot;component&quot; was a piece of code that provided various functions that may be invoked by clients. Each function was identified by a signed 16-bit integer ID code. Non-positive codes were reserved for predefined functions that should be understood by all components—open/close a component instance, query whether a function was supported, etc. The meanings of positive function codes depended on the type of component.

A &quot;component instance&quot; was created by &quot;opening&quot; a component. This called the component&#x27;s open function to allocate and initialize any necessary storage for the instance. Closing the instance got rid of this storage and invalidated all references to that instance.

Components and component instances were referenced by 32-bit values that were not pointers. Instead, they were interpreted as keys into internal Component Manager tables. These references were generated in such a way that, once they became invalid, those values were unlikely to become valid again for a long time. This minimized the chance of obscure bugs due to dangling references.

Components were identified by OSType codes giving their &quot;type&quot;, &quot;subtype&quot; and &quot;manufacturer&quot;. For instance, a component type might be &quot;raster image compressor&quot;, subtypes of which might exist for JPEG, H.261, Sorenson, and Intel Indeo, among others. It was possible to have multiple components registered with exactly the same identification codes, giving alternative implementations of the same algorithm for example using hardware versus software, trading off speed versus quality, or other criteria. It was possible for the applications to query the existence of such alternatives and make explicit choices between them, or let the system choose a default.

Among the options available, a component could &quot;delegate&quot; parts of its functions to another component as a form of subclassing for code reuse. It was also possible for one component to &quot;capture&quot; another, which meant that all accesses to the captured component had to go through the capturing one.

== Mac OS Components ==

Mac OS accumulated a great variety of component types:
* Within QuickTime, there were image codecs, media handlers, media data handlers, video digitizer drivers, file format importers and exporters, and many others.
* The Sound Manager moved to a predominantly component-based architecture in version 3.0: sound output devices were represented as components, and there were also component types for mixing multiple channels, converting between different sample rates and sample sizes, and encoding and decoding compressed formats.
* AppleScript introduced the concept of scripting languages implemented as components.
* ColorSync implemented different colour-matching methods as components.
* QuickDraw GX &quot;font scalers&quot; were renderers for the different font formats.

<doc id="1013334" wikidata="Q471896" url="?curid=1013334" title="In the Pale Moonlight">
<text>&quot;In the Pale Moonlight&quot; is the 143rd episode of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, the 19th of the sixth season. It originally aired on April 15, 1998, in broadcast syndication.

Set in the 24th century, &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; follows the adventures of the crew of the fictional space station &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;; the later seasons of the series follow a war between the United Federation of Planets and the Dominion, a hostile alien empire that has formed an alliance with the nearby Cardassian Union. In this episode, Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) works with former spy Elim Garak (Andrew Robinson) to trick the Romulans into joining the war against the Dominion.

The episode received Nielsen ratings of 4.8 points corresponding to nearly 4.7 million viewers, and is widely regarded as one of the series&#x27; best episodes.

==Plot==
The episode is told in flashback, as Sisko records a personal log entry on the events of the past two weeks.

As the Federation&#x27;s losses in the Dominion War mount, Sisko decides that he must bring the Romulans into the war on the Federation&#x27;s side no matter the cost. Sisko enlists Garak&#x27;s help to find evidence that the Dominion is planning to attack the Romulans, but all of Garak&#x27;s contacts in Cardassian territory end up dead shortly after communicating with him. Garak suggests forging the evidence instead. Hesitant, but motivated by the Dominion&#x27;s recent conquest of Betazed, Sisko obtains permission from Starfleet to proceed.

At Garak&#x27;s request, Sisko secures the release of a forger named Grathon Tolar from a Klingon prison. To obtain an authentic Cardassian data rod, he is forced to trade a large quantity of bio-mimetic gel, a rare, dangerous and strictly regulated material, over Dr. Bashir&#x27;s protests. When Tolar stabs Quark in a drunken altercation, Sisko bribes Quark to drop the matter. Tolar forges a holographic record of a meeting between Dominion leaders discussing plans to invade Romulus. On Garak&#x27;s advice, Sisko arranges a secret meeting with Vreenak, an influential Romulan senator. Sisko gives Vreenak the recording but the senator discovers the forgery and vows to expose the deception. As Sisko faces the possibility that his actions may drive the Romulans to side with the Dominion, he learns that Vreenak&#x27;s ship was destroyed en route home.

Sisko confronts Garak, who admits he planted a bomb on Vreenak&#x27;s ship. Garak explains that when the Romulans search the wreckage and find the rod, any imperfections will be attributed to damage from the explosion and the Romulans will assume that the Dominion assassinated Vreenak to prevent him from bringing the rod back. The recording will implicate the Dominion as planned; Garak tells Sisko he can ease his conscience with the knowledge that the Alpha Quadrant may have been saved, at the cost of the lives of Vreenak and Tolar (whom Garak has also killed) and Sisko&#x27;s self-respect—which Garak calls a bargain. Soon, the Romulans declare war on the Dominion.

At the end of his log entry, Sisko wrestles with having condoned forgery, selling prohibited materials, bribery, and murder for the good of the Alpha Quadrant. After thinking about it, Sisko declares that he can live with it, and that—if he had to—he would do it all again. He then deletes the log.

==Production==

===Writing===

The episode has origins in a discussion the writing staff had about the Vietnam War, which quickly moved onto the Watergate scandal. They began working on an idea in which Jake Sisko discovered some incriminating information regarding Shakaar, the leader of the Bajoran government. If revealed, it would bring down the government during a time of war, which would force Sisko to prevent his son from revealing the information. At this point, the episode was called &quot;Patriot&quot;. The plot then evolved to focus on Sisko instead. Writer Michael Taylor wrote a screenplay which saw Jake Sisko attempting to interview Garak, but following the evasiveness of the Cardassian, he realises that something is amiss. Sisko tells him to back off from Garak, but Jake&#x27;s investigation reveals that the duo were attempting to bring the Romulans into the war against the Dominion. Sisko would tell his son that he would prevent the publishing of the story, but the writing team did not buy into the conflict between those characters.

Ronald D. Moore began working with Taylor to revise the screenplay, dropping Jake from the plot entirely. They were having trouble with the pacing of the story, but Moore realised while drinking late at night that it would work if it was told in flashbacks. He pitched the idea the following morning, and it was accepted by the writing team. The screenplay was entirely re-written. Taylor called the final version &quot;brilliant&quot; but admitted that it had mostly been written by Moore. Moore explained that the story needed something of weight in order to push Sisko along. The writing team discussed having the Dominion take one of the well-known planets of the Federation. Vulcan was considered, but it was felt to be too important and so Betazed was chosen instead. Ira Steven Behr added the final line of the episode, &quot;I can live with it&quot;, as a reference to the 1962 film &quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&quot;. The title of the episode came from the line in the 1989 &quot;Batman&quot; film: &quot;Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?&quot;, but Moore did not know it was original to the film; he assumed it was an old folk saying.

===Direction and casting===
Director Victor Lobl also planned out the mannerisms shown by Brooks as Sisko where he talks directly to the camera. He praised the actor, saying that he delivered exactly what Lobl&#x27;s written direction had described. All of those sequences were shot almost in direct continuity to ensure that the audience believed that it was a single log recording. Lobl had those filmed very tightly, and so there were not many options available in editing as only two angles were filmed for those sequences. The script had called for Sisko to get more and more drunk during those sequences as he descends into the flashbacks; Lobl had expected the studio to pull that idea before filming, but they did not. Lobl also had Sisko begin to remove various parts of his uniform at the same time, which he felt demonstrated that the character was baring his soul about the story.

&quot;In the Pale Moonlight&quot; featured several recurring characters and actors, with Combs as Weyoun, Biggs as Damar and Robinson as Garak. Joining them was McHattie, portraying Senator Vreenak. He made a second appearance in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise in the &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; episode &quot;The Xindi&quot; as an alien foreman.

Executive producer Rick Berman said that when creating &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, he had to obey the rules as set out by franchise creator Gene Roddenberry, and compared the behavior of normal Starfleet officers to that of Boy Scouts. Berman suggested that &quot;In the Pale Moonlight&quot; was the exception. Taylor said that the episode &quot;pushes the boundaries in a realistic way&quot;. In an interview in 2011, when talking about &quot;In the Pale Moonlight&quot;, Robinson compared Starfleet to Americans in general. He said: &quot;we&#x27;re not really willing to take the consequences of our actions, and sometimes we have to do very dirty things, and we have to hurt people, and we pretend that that doesn&#x27;t exist, that Americans would never do that. We dealt with issues like that and I don&#x27;t think... you know... the other shows really went as far as we did.&quot;

==Reception==

===Broadcast===
&quot;In the Pale Moonlight&quot; was first broadcast on April 15, 1998, in broadcast syndication. It received Nielsen ratings of 4.8 percent, placing it in 14th place overall in its timeslot. Among first-run syndication series, it was placed second for the week behind &quot;&quot;, but ahead of &quot;&quot;. This was higher than the share received by &quot;Inquisition&quot;, broadcast in the week prior with a 4.7 percent share and &quot;His Way&quot; in the week afterwards with 4.3 percent.

===Critical reception===
&quot;In the Pale Moonlight&quot; has been one of the best received episodes of the series by fans. A survey conducted by &quot;Syfy&quot; at the end of the series placed the episode as the fans&#x27; favourite, while members of the Official &quot;Star Trek&quot; Fan Club have ranked it among the top ten. Jay Garmon at &quot;TechRepublic&quot; listed it as the best episode of the series in 2012, describing it as being when &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; stood apart from the other series in the franchise and &quot;found a whole new layer of storytelling, depth, and relevance&quot;. Charlie Jane Anders listed &quot;In the Pale Moonlight&quot; as the seventh best episode of the entire franchise, in a list of the top 100 episodes for &quot;io9&quot; in 2014, having placed it in the same position in a top ten of the franchise in 2011. Lexi Watson ranked &quot;In the Pale Moonlight&quot; in first place out of the whole franchise for &quot;Digital Spy&quot; in 2016, saying: &quot;Do [Sisko&#x27;s] good intentions matter? Does the end always justify the means? Everyone will take something different from this episode and ultimately there may not be a right answer. You don&#x27;t get that on &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;.&quot;

Most critics also responded positively to the episode. The review of the VHS release in &quot;Dreamwatch&quot; described the episode as &quot;probably the strongest of the season&quot; and among the best episodes of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;. It called the plot &quot;original&quot;, &quot;daring&quot; and &quot;unexpected&quot;. Frank M. Robinson in his 1999 book, &quot;Science Fiction of the 20th Century&quot;, describes &quot;In the Pale Moonlight&quot; as: &quot;Captain Sisko is forced to betray his ideals to save the lives of millions on a galactic scale at the cost of one petty criminal and one ambassador of an unfriendly nation. On the surface, no contest but Brooks (Sisko) played the role with depth and feeling unusual in a science-fiction series.&quot; He added that the &quot;TV Guide&quot; had described it as one of the best dramatic episodes of the season. Keith DeCandido reviewed the episode for &quot;Tor&quot;, giving it a rating of ten out of ten. He called the fall of Betazed a &quot;masterstroke&quot; because it made the viewer invested in the conflict. He praised the suffering Sisko had for doing what he did, and said that both Brooks and Robinson were &quot;at their best&quot; with two &quot;bravura performances&quot;. In 2003, Mark Jones and Lance Parkin said in &quot;Beyond the Final Frontier: An Unauthorised Review of Star Trek&quot; that the episode was &quot;good&quot; but &quot;not half as shocking and dangerous as some fans would have you believe&quot;. They suggested that similar ideas were used on a number of police procedurals, and were the standard on &quot;&quot;.

In 2013, Zack Handlen, in his review for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, suggested that the most shocking aspect of &quot;In the Pale Moonlight&quot; was that Sisko&#x27;s actions were not shocking but only provided a twist. He said that the script &quot;never overplays Sisko&#x27;s deepening sense of crisis&quot;, and avoided presenting any choices as right or wrong.

In 2013, &quot;The Guardian&quot; recommended this episode as an example of a &quot;smarter version&quot; of &quot;Star Trek&quot; than the film &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;, noting this episode shows the darker side of the franchise.

In 2015, &quot;Geek.com&quot; recommended this episode as &quot;essential watching&quot; for their abbreviated &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; binge-watching guide.

In 2016, &quot;Radio Times&quot; ranked the Sisko&#x27;s deletion of his logs the 27th greatest moment of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; film and television. They note this as case where Sisko gives up his principles, and note it as an example of the moral complexities presented in the show; he tries to weigh his actions against the goal of a victory in the Dominion war.
The episode has been frequently ranked as one of the best episodes of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; and of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise as a whole.

In 2016, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; ranked this episode as the #1 best of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.&quot; In 2018, &quot;Vulture&quot; ranked this episode the third best of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. In 2018, Nerdist ranked this episode the 11th most essential episode of the series. &quot;SciFiNow&quot; ranked this one of the top ten episodes of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, remarking that &quot;This could be the show’s finest hour&quot;&quot;.&quot;
In 2007, &quot;DVD Talk&quot; said of the episode: &quot;Everything from the directing to the writing, to the acting hits all of the right notes. This is an example of &quot;Star Trek&quot; at its best.&quot;
In 2009, &quot;&quot;Time&quot;&quot; rated &quot;In the Pale Moonlight&quot; as one of the top ten moments of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. They called it &quot;chilling&quot;, as Sisko slowly gives up his principles as the war gets more desperate. 
In 2013, &quot;Slate&quot; ranked &quot;In the Pale Moonlight&quot; one of the ten best episodes in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. In 2016, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; ranked &quot;In the Pale Moonlight&quot; the fourth best episode of all &quot;Star Trek&quot;. &quot;Empire&quot; ranked &quot;In the Pale Moonlight&quot; 13th out of the 50 top episodes of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; in 2016. In 2016, &quot;IGN&quot; ranked this the sixth best episode of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; series.
In 2017, &quot;Space.com&quot; rated &quot;In the Pale Moonlight&quot; as the fifth best &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode overall out of its 700+ episodes, behind &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot; (#1), &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot; (#2), &quot;The Menagerie&quot;(#3) and &quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot; (#4). In June 2019, it was rated the fifth best episode up to that time, by &quot;Screen Rant&quot;. &quot;Io9&quot; ranked it as the seventh best episode of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes up to 2011. In 2015, &quot;Geek.com&quot; rated the moment when the Romulans announce to Sisko they determined the data rod was a fake, the 13th best moment in all &quot;Star Trek&quot;. In 2020, &quot;ScreenRant&quot; ranked &quot;In the Pale Moonlight&quot; the tenth best episode of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise television episodes up to that time.

In 2019, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked a character introduced in this episode, Vreenak, as the third most important Romulan of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

In 2020, &quot;SyFy&quot; also recommended watching &quot;In the Pale Moonlight&quot; as background on the Romulans for &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;.

<text>Bruce LaBruce (born January 3, 1964) is a Canadian artist, writer, filmmaker, photographer, and underground director based in Toronto.

==Life and career==
LaBruce was born in Tiverton, Ontario. He has claimed both Justin Stewart and Bryan Bruce as his birth name in different sources. He studied film at York University in Toronto and wrote for &quot;Cineaction&quot; magazine, curated by Robin Wood, his teacher.

He first gained public attention with the publication of the queer punk zine &quot;J.D.s&quot;, which he co-edited with G.B. Jones. He has written and photographed for a variety of publications including &quot;Vice&quot;, the former Nerve.com and &quot;BlackBook Magazine&quot;, and has been a columnist for the Canadian music magazine &quot;Exclaim!&quot; and Toronto&#x27;s &quot;Eye Weekly&quot;, as well as a contributing editor and photographer for New York&#x27;s &quot;Index Magazine&quot;. He has also been published in &quot;Toronto Life&quot;, the &quot;National Post&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

His movie, &quot;Otto; or Up with Dead People&quot; debuted at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. &quot;L.A. Zombie&quot; was banned from the Melbourne International Film Festival in 2010 because, in the opinion of Australian censors, it would have been refused classification. However, the film was subsequently able to screen at OutTakes, a New Zealand lesbian and gay international film festival, in May 2011.

In March 2011, LaBruce directed a performance of Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s opera &quot;Pierrot Lunaire&quot; at the Hebbel am Ufer Theatre in Berlin. This iteration of the opera included gender diversity, castration scenes and dildos, as well as portraying Pierrot as a transgender man. He subsequently also filmed this adaptation as the 2014 theatrical film &quot;Pierrot Lunaire&quot;.

Beginning with &quot;Gerontophilia&quot; in 2013, LaBruce dropped some of the more sexually explicit aspects of his filmmaking style. He retained his traditional interest in exploring sexual taboos, dramatizing an intergenerational relationship between a young man and a senior citizen, but opted to do so within a film that would be more palatable to a mainstream audience.

In 2018, LaBruce directed the short film &quot;Scotch Egg&quot; as part of Erika Lust&#x27;s &quot;XConfessions&quot; series. The short is about a Scottish gay man who has sex with a woman in a gay bar. LaBruce was inspired to create the film after reading a confession sent to &quot;XConfessions&quot; by a heterosexual woman who fantasized about going to a gay bar and having sex with a homosexual man.

His short film collection &quot;It Is Not the Pornographer That Is Perverse...&quot; was released in 2018. The title refers to Rosa von Praunheim&#x27;s film &quot;It Is Not the Homosexual Who Is Perverse, But the Society in Which He Lives&quot; (1971).

In 2024, his film &quot;The Visitor&quot; was selected in the Panorama section at the 74th Berlin International Film Festival where it premiered February 17.

==Themes and style==
According to Courtney Fathom Sell of &quot;South Coast Today&quot;, some of his films explore themes of sexual and interpersonal transgression against cultural norms, frequently blending the artistic and production techniques of independent film with gay pornography.

LaBruce&#x27;s filmmaking style is marked by a blend of explicitly pornographic depictions of sex with more conventional narrative and filmmaking techniques, as well as an interest in extreme topics which mainstream audiences might dismiss as shocking or disturbing taboos. For instance, his films have depicted scenes of sexual fetish and paraphilia, BDSM, gang rape, racially-motivated violence, amputee fetishism, gerontophilia, male and female prostitution, twincest, and zombie and vampire sexuality.

He has frequently been identified with the New Queer Cinema movement that emerged in the 1990s, although at the height of that movement&#x27;s prominence, he rejected the association on the grounds that he felt more personally aligned with the queercore movement. The queercore movement was born in the 1980s and LaBruce was one of the fathers. Noted as the avant-garde and unapologetic gay answer to the punk movement, queercore expressed the very same discontent with society as the punks were stating.

<doc id="1013342" wikidata="Q1774219" url="?curid=1013342" title="Tarzan Boy">
<text>&quot;Tarzan Boy&quot; is the debut single by the Italian-based act Baltimora. The song was written by Maurizio Bassi and Naimy Hackett, and released in 1985 as the lead single from Baltimora&#x27;s debut album &quot;Living in the Background&quot;. The song was remixed and re-released in 1993, and has been covered by several artists throughout the years.

The refrain uses Tarzan&#x27;s cry as a melodic line. The song is rhythmical, with an electronic melody and simple lyrics. Baltimora are often considered a one-hit wonder due to the success they experienced with &quot;Tarzan Boy&quot;. It features a melodic motif that was later named the millennial whoop.

The music video for the song features the frontman for the band&#x27;s performances, Jimmy McShane, who according to some sources did not actually sing the song but rather lip synced it.

==Background==
In a 1985 interview with &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;, McShane said of the song and its success, 

In 1995, McShane announced his intention to re-record &quot;Tarzan Boy&quot; for release as a charity single. All proceeds were to have gone to the Northern Ireland AIDS Helpline and the AIDS clinic at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast, but McShane died of an AIDS-related illness in March 1995 before he could re-record it.

==Chart performance==
&quot;Tarzan Boy&quot; was an international hit, debuting in the top five Italian charts and performing well in several other European countries, including Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, and notably, France, where &quot;Tarzan Boy&quot; was most successful, topping the charts there for five consecutive weeks. In the United Kingdom, it reached number 3 in September 1985. The single had success in the United States (where it was released by EMI), with the single remaining on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart for six months and ultimately peaking at number 13 in early 1986.

In 1993, &quot;Tarzan Boy&quot; was featured on the soundtrack of the American film &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III&quot;, both in its original form and as a new remix by Daniel Abraham. It was released as a single from the soundtrack and would re-enter the Billboard charts at number 68 and peak at number 51 five weeks later. It would spend an additional 12 weeks on the chart, exiting the Hot 100 on 12 June 1993.

==Critical reception==
Upon its release in the US, &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote, &quot;Disco novelty from Italy was a summertime smash in Europe, thanks to a maddeningly catchy swinging-through-the-vines hook.&quot;

==Uses in sports==
From January 2020 to July 2023, AEW wrestler, &quot;Jungle Boy&quot; Jack Perry used &quot;Tarzan Boy&quot; as his entrance music. As of the 2023 Major League Baseball season, &quot;Tarzan Boy&quot; was the walk-on song, or entrance music, played each time Mark Canha came to bat for the New York Mets.

Czech Extraliga team HC Sparta Praha has used the chorus of the song regularly since the 1986–1987 season in its home arenas as the official celebration anthem each time the team scores a goal.

<text>Everardo Elizondo Almaguer is a Mexican economist who has worked for private, public, and academic institutions. By senatorial appointment, he served as deputy governor of the Bank of Mexico —the country&#x27;s central bank— from 1998 to 2008.

==Biography==

He was born in Linares, Nuevo León. After earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree with honors in Economics from the Autonomous University of Nuevo Leon (UANL), he graduated with both a master&#x27;s degree and a Ph.D. in the same discipline at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in the United States. He also completed an International Tax Program diploma from Harvard Law School in 1972.

His professional career started in Monterrey, in the Department of Economic Studies of &quot;Compañía General de Acceptaciones&quot;, a private financial institution which later became Grupo Financiero Serfin (nowadays Banco Santander). From there, he moved to Grupo Alfa, a leader of the Mexican industry in the 1970s, where he served for eight years as director-general for Economic Studies. Afterwards, he created and led a private consultancy for nine years: &quot;Index, Economía Applicada&quot;. He also briefly collaborated as a consultant with the Nuevo León State Government during Sócrates Rizzo&#x27;s administration. In 1992, he joined Grupo Financiero Bancomer (nowadays BBVA) as director of Economic Research.

In 1998, president Ernesto Zedillo invited him to be a member of the Board of Governors of the Bank of Mexico — the central bank— to take the position left by Francisco Gil Díaz as deputy governor. In 2000, the Senate approved his nomination by President Vicente Fox to undertake a full eight-year period, which ended on the last day of December 2008.

Elizondo was also a founder and head of the Graduate School of Economics at the Autonomous University of Nuevo Leon, which later became the Postgraduate Studies Division in Economics. He has lectured several courses there and, since 2009, at the Graduate School of Public Administration (EGAP) of the Monterrey Institute of Technology (ITESM). From 1982 to 1983 he visited the Institute for Latin American Studies at the University of Texas at Austin as a research fellow.

He has worked as an economics and finance columnist for more than 35 years, writing a weekly column that is simultaneously published at &quot;El Norte&quot; and &quot;Reforma&quot;, and makes eventual contributions to &quot;El Economista&quot;, academic books and periodicals. He has been a member of the board of directors of several Mexican institutions, such as Universidad Mexicana del Noreste, Grupo Senda, Farmacias Benavides and Grupo Financiero Banorte, where he is an independent advisor since 1 January 2010. He is also a frequent public speaker in Mexico and abroad.

<text>The Ace &quot;Junior Ace&quot; is a two-seat sports aircraft that has been offered by the Ace Aircraft Manufacturing Company in kit and plans form for home building since the early 1930s. It was designed by Orland Corben.

An evolution of Corben&#x27;s single-seat Baby Ace, it is a parasol wing monoplane of conventional taildragger configuration. Pilot and passenger sit side-by-side, in a cockpit that may be enclosed or left open. The fuselage is of fabric-covered tubular construction and the wings are wood. A variety of powerplants may be used, and the aircraft has a power range of .

Experimental Aircraft Association founder Paul Poberezny widened the fuselage of the Jr Ace, added modern wheels, brakes and increased the span to 34 ft to create the Pober Jr Ace. The company Acro Sport maintains the rights to the design, and sells plans so the aircraft can be amateur-built.

<doc id="1013368" wikidata="Q7618615" url="?curid=1013368" title="Stolen Honor">
<text>Stolen Honor is a 45-minute anti-John Kerry video documentary that was released during the September 2004 election season. It features interviews with a number of American men who contend they were prisoners of war in North Vietnam and suffered increased maltreatment while prisoners as a direct result of Kerry&#x27;s Fulbright Hearing testimony in April 1971. The subtitle of the film is &quot;Wounds That Never Heal&quot;; on the production company&#x27;s website the complete title is given instead as Stolen Honor: John Kerry&#x27;s Record of Betrayal. Its name was based on the book &quot;Stolen Valor: How the Vietnam Generation Was Robbed of Its Heroes and Its History&quot; by B.G. Burkett and Glenna Whitley.

The production company&#x27;s website states that &quot;&quot;Stolen Honor&quot; investigates how John Kerry&#x27;s actions during the Vietnam era impacted the treatment of American soldiers and POWs. Using John Kerry&#x27;s own words, the documentary juxtaposes John Kerry&#x27;s actions with the words of veterans who were still in Vietnam when John Kerry was leading the anti-war movement.&quot;

== Red White and Blue Productions ==
&quot;Stolen Honor&quot; was a project of Red, White and Blue Productions, based in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, whose public affairs are managed by Quantum Communications, a company owned by lobbyist Charlie Gerow, who also acted as publicist for the film. In 2000, Gerow ran on the Republican ticket for Congress. In 2003, he was nominated by President Bush to be a member of the Benjamin Franklin Tercentenary Commission.

Carlton Sherwood, the producer of &quot;Stolen Honor&quot; is a Vietnam War veteran who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1980 for his work for the Gannett News Service. His appointments to several positions by Republican politicians has been cited as evidence of partisan bias and his journalism has been criticized. In 1983 he was responsible for a four-part series on a Washington DC television station which charged the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund with misspending—if not stealing—donated money. The following year, after a GAO audit and threats of a lawsuit, the station broadcast a retraction. &quot;Inquisition&quot;, his investigation of the 1982 tax fraud prosecution of the Reverend Sun Myung Moon (leader of the Unification Church) was published in 1991. The following year the PBS documentary series &quot;Frontline&quot; reported that James Gavin, an aide to Moon, had reviewed the &quot;overall tone and factual contents&quot; of the manuscript and that Sherwood had agreed to his revisions. Sherwood denied that the Unification Church exerted editorial control over the book.

== Interviewees ==
One of the ex-POWs interviewed in &quot;Stolen Honor&quot; is USAF Col. (ret.) Kenneth Cordier, who was dismissed from his role as volunteer member of the 2004 Bush campaign veterans steering committee after it was noticed that he had appeared in the second Swift Boat Veterans for Truth (SBVT) ad. The Bush campaign had denied Democratic charges that it was coordinating with the tax-exempt 527 group.

In October 2004, one of the Marine veterans shown in the film, University of Delaware professor Kenneth J. Campbell, sued Sherwood over his depiction in the film.

== October 2004 media controversy ==
In early October 2004, it was reported that Sinclair Broadcast Group, which owns television stations in nearly one-quarter of the United States, had ordered all of its stations to air &quot;Stolen Honor&quot; in the days leading up to the November 2 presidential election.

These news reports touched off a media firestorm. According to television critic Alessandra Stanley, formerly of &quot;The New York Times&quot;:

&quot;Stolen Honor: Wounds That Never Heal,&quot; the highly contested anti-Kerry documentary, should not be shown by the Sinclair Broadcast Group. It should be shown in its entirety on all the networks, cable stations and on public television. This histrionic, often specious and deeply sad film does not do much more damage to Senator John Kerry&#x27;s reputation than have the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth&#x27;s negative ads, which have flooded television markets in almost every swing state. But it does help viewers better understand the rage fueling the unhappy band of brothers who oppose Mr. Kerry&#x27;s candidacy and his claim to heroism. ... [T]his film is payback time, a chance to punish one of the most famous antiwar activists, Mr. Kerry, the one who got credit for serving with distinction in combat, then, through the eyes of the veterans in this film, went home to discredit the men left behind.&quot; She also said that &quot;Stolen Honor&#x27;s&quot; imagery &quot;is crude, but powerful&quot;. She also made clear however, that &quot;Stolen Honor&quot; had various &quot;distortions... intended to hurt Mr. Kerry at the polls&quot;.

The news of the possible Sinclair broadcast was followed by various complaints that such a broadcast would violate the &quot;equal time&quot; provision of the Communications Act that governs airtime for political candidates.

When questioned about this contention, then current FCC chairman Michael Powell announced the FCC position that a broadcast of this documentary would not be a violation of the equal time provision. However, former FCC chairman, Reed Hundt, contended that Powell was offering &quot;tacit and plain encouragement of the use of the Sinclair airwaves to pursue a smear campaign.&quot;

A spokesperson for Sinclair said that the airing would be followed by a panel discussion, which Kerry would be asked to join. The Kerry campaign declined the invitation. Sinclair did not accept an offer from Michael Moore for free a broadcast of his documentary &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;.

Sinclair&#x27;s then Washington bureau chief, Jon Lieberman, publicly condemned the expected broadcast in an interview in &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;:

It&#x27;s biased political propaganda, with clear intentions to sway this election. For me, it&#x27;s not about right or left—it&#x27;s about what&#x27;s right or wrong in news coverage this close to an election.
Shortly after making this statement to the newspaper, Lieberman was fired. Sinclair Vice President Mark Hyman said, &quot;Everyone is entitled to their personal opinion, including Jon Leiberman. We are disappointed that Jon&#x27;s political views caused him to speak to the press about company business.&quot; Lieberman said of the company that made the film, &quot;It&#x27;s propaganda. It&#x27;s meant to sway the election — we&#x27;ve been told that by people inside the company.&quot; According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reporters, many Sinclair employees said privately that they agreed with Leiberman: &quot;I was glad that someone finally had the guts to say something. Everyone who works there feels the same way and says it in private, but it doesn&#x27;t leave the building.&quot;

== Reception ==
Mark Nevins, a spokesman for the Kerry presidential campaign, stated: &quot;This group is the poor, distant cousin of the Swift Boat Veterans for Bush. It&#x27;s people with questionable backgrounds whose sole mission in life is to smear John Kerry.&quot; (Nevins was making a derisive reference to Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, an anti-Kerry organization.)

According to conservative commentator Deroy Murdock, &quot;It presents POWs who argue that John Kerry&#x27;s fallacious spring 1971 claims that U.S. atrocities occurred &quot;on a day-to-day basis with the full awareness of officers at all levels of command&quot; amplified their agony under America&#x27;s North Vietnamese enemies.&quot;

Reacting to reports that Sinclair was to air &quot;Stolen Honor&quot; shortly before the election, members of the United States Congress asked the FCC to consider the legality of the planned broadcast. The Democratic National Committee filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission. As this controversy made the news, with a number of Sinclair advertisers pulling their ads and Sinclair stock dropping 17% in eleven days, Sinclair announced that it had never intended to air &quot;Stolen Honor&quot; in an hour slot in the first place, indicating that it might instead show clips of the video in a discussion panel format. Ultimately, Sinclair broadcast 4 minutes of excerpts from the film.

In October 2005, Sherwood sued John Kerry and Kerry&#x27;s Pennsylvania campaign manager, Anthony T. Podesta. The suit alleged that the defendants defamed Sherwood by stating in a &quot;widely circulated e-mail&quot; that Sherwood [is] &quot;a disgraced former journalist&quot; who &quot;crawled out of the gutter&quot;. It also alleged &quot;conspiracy and interference with contractual relations&quot;. Podesta responded that Sherwood &quot;had his 15-minute Andy Warhol moment last year. Maybe he wants another.&quot; On August 3, 2006, Sherwood&#x27;s lawsuit was dismissed by a federal judge.

<text>The Pober Super Ace was a single-seat sports aircraft designed as a homebuilt aircraft by Orland Corben in 1935. Originally the &quot;Corben Super Ace,&quot; it was an evolution of the Corben Baby Ace, and closely linked with it throughout their existence.

It was a single-seat parasol wing monoplane of conventional tailwheel configuration. As published, the plans called for an engine from a Ford Model A (some say Ford Model B) to be modified to power the aircraft.

A set of plans and construction articles appeared in &quot;Popular Aviation&quot; between April and October 1935 and were later marketed by Orland Corben.

Rights to the aircraft were sold to Paul Poberezny with the rest of the Corben company&#x27;s assets. Plans are offered for sale by Acro Sport.

<doc id="1013377" wikidata="Q1889403" url="?curid=1013377" title="Pretty Baby (1978 film)">
<text>Pretty Baby is a 1978 American historical drama film directed by Louis Malle, written by Polly Platt, and starring Brooke Shields, Keith Carradine, and Susan Sarandon. Set in 1917, it focuses on a 12-year-old girl being raised in a brothel in Storyville, the red-light district of New Orleans, by her prostitute mother. Barbara Steele, Diana Scarwid, and Antonio Fargas appear in supporting roles. The film is based on the true account of a young girl who was sexually exploited by being forced into prostitution by her mother, a theme which was recounted in historian Al Rose&#x27;s 1974 book &quot;Storyville, New Orleans: Being an Authentic Illustrated Account of the Notorious Red-Light District&quot;. It is also based on the life of photographer Ernest Bellocq, who photographed various New Orleans prostitutes in the early 20th century. The title, &quot;Pretty Baby&quot;, is derived from the Tony Jackson song of the same name, which is featured on the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

The project marked Malle&#x27;s first American film production, as his previous works had been produced in his native France. Filming took place, on-location, in New Orleans in the spring of 1977.

The film was released, theatrically, in the United States in April 1978, and screened at the 1978 Cannes Film Festival, where it was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or, winning the Technical Grand Prize. Ferdinand Morton&#x27;s score also earned the film an Academy Award nomination for Best Music. Although the film itself was mostly praised by critics, it caused significant public outcry and media controversy due to its depiction of child sexual exploitation, as well as the nude and semi-nude scenes featuring Shields, who was 11 years old at the time of filming, and whose character was a child being abused by grown men.

== Plot ==
In 1917, during the final months of legal prostitution in Storyville, the red-light district of New Orleans, Louisiana, Hattie is a prostitute working at an elegant brothel run by the elderly, cocaine-addicted Madame Nell. Hattie has given birth to a baby boy and has a 12-year-old daughter, Violet, who lives in the house. When photographer Ernest Bellocq arrives with his camera, aiming to document the sex workers, Hattie and Violet are the only people awake at the time; Madame Nell agrees to let him photograph them after he offers to pay her.

Bellocq becomes a fixture in the brothel, photographing the women, but mostly Hattie. His photographic activities fascinate the precocious Violet, who believes the man is falling in love with her mother, something which, strangely, makes her jealous. Violet is a restless child, frustrated by the lengthy precision of early photography that one must endure to compose and take photographs.

Nell decides that Violet is old enough for her virginity to be auctioned off. After a bidding war between regulars, Violet is bought by an apparently &quot;quiet&quot; customer. Hattie, meanwhile, wants to escape her lifestyle, marrying a customer and leaving for St. Louis without Violet, whom her new husband believes to be her sister. Hattie promises to return for her daughter once she has settled in and explained everything to her new spouse.

Violet flees the brothel after being punished for engaging in &quot;hijinks&quot; and getting into trouble. She appears on Bellocq&#x27;s doorstep, asking if he will sleep with her and take care of her. He initially says no, but then takes her in and commences a sexual relationship with the girl. In many ways, their relationship resembles one between a sexually abusive parent and child, with Bellocq standing in for Violet&#x27;s absent mother, and Violet seeking to fill that role subconsciously. Bellocq buys Violet a doll, saying that &quot;every child should have a doll.&quot;; she responds with &quot;I&#x27;m a child to you?!&quot;. Bellocq is entranced by Violet&#x27;s beauty, youth, and photogenic face. She is frustrated by Bellocq&#x27;s devotion to his photography and lack of care for her as a dependent, as much as he is frustrated by the reality that she is an adolescent girl.

Violet eventually returns to Nell&#x27;s after quarreling with Bellocq, but local social reform groups are forcing the brothels of Storyville to close. Bellocq arrives to wed Violet, ostensibly to protect her from the wider world.

Two weeks after the wedding, Hattie and her husband arrive from St. Louis to collect Violet, claiming that her marriage to Bellocq is illegal without parental consent. Bellocq does not want to let Violet go; she asks if he will go with her and her family. Upon hearing that Violet does want to go to St. Louis, he tells her to leave, realizing that schooling and a more conventional life are in the girl&#x27;s best interest.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
=== Development ===
Screenwriter Polly Platt developed the idea for the film after meeting with Louis Malle and learning of his love of New Orleans jazz music, which was an integral part of the Storyville red-light district in the city in the early 20th century. Platt based the screenplay on the life of a young girl who was forced into prostitution by her mother, which was recounted in historian Al Rose&#x27;s 1974 book &quot;Storyville, New Orleans: Being an Authentic Illustrated Account of the Notorious Red-Light District&quot;, as well as the life of photographer Ernest Bellocq, who photographed various New Orleans prostitutes in the early 20th century.

=== Casting ===
Following her acclaimed performance as a child prostitute in &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976), the studio was keen on casting Jodie Foster as Violet. However, Malle rejected the idea as he thought the role should be played by a 12-year-old only, and Foster was 14. Brooke Shields, a child model who had made her film debut the year before in &quot;Alice, Sweet Alice&quot; (1976), met with Malle and the film&#x27;s screenwriter, Polly Platt. She described her audition as consisting merely of a conversation with the two, in which they largely asked her questions about her life. To ensure that Shields was intellectually able to navigate the material, Malle and Platt also inquired if she was aware of what prostitution was. Shields, who had grown up in New York City and observed working prostitutes in Times Square, had been informed by her mother what prostitution entailed.

Susan Sarandon, who was cast as Violet&#x27;s mother, commented on Shields&#x27;s casting in the role: &quot;Brooke lived a life that was very similar [to that of her character] ... You know ... The closest thing to a child prostitute (sexually exploited child) would be a child actor-model, in this day and age. Brooke was already an incredibly mature kid and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any secret that she was ... asked to grow up very quickly.&quot;

Platt initially planned for the role of E. J. Bellocq to go to Jack Nicholson, but Malle denounced this. Instead, he offered the role to Keith Carradine, which Carradine was confused by as he bore no physical similarities to Bellocq.

=== Filming ===
&quot;Pretty Baby&quot; was shot on location in New Orleans over a period of four months in 1977. Due to its controversial subject matter, the production stated they were &quot;being very cautious because of the nature of the material and ... following all the rules aimed at safeguarding child performers: teachers, psychological testing, parental cooperation and so forth.&quot;

Screenwriter Polly Platt stated that Malle insisted on continuous rehearsals throughout the shoot, which frustrated much of the cast and crew. Platt described Shields&#x27;s mother, Teri, as &quot;obstreperous&quot; on the set, and claimed she was arrested by police for driving while intoxicated with her daughter in the car, as well as for punching a police officer in the face.

Shields maintained in later years that she &quot;did not experience any distress or humiliation&quot; while filming her nude scenes in the film. What she does remember was trying not to look as if she had &quot;just sucked on a lemon&quot; before her on-screen kiss with then-28-year-old Keith Carradine, adding that the actor was &quot;so kind&quot;. She also recounted being soundly slapped – both on- and off-screen – by Susan Sarandon.

Commenting on the production, Malle stated &quot;&quot;Pretty Baby&quot; was harder than I expected, and in the meantime, I fell in love with America.&quot; After filming was completed, Malle chose to become a U.S. resident and remained there for the remainder of his life.

== Music ==

ABC Records released a soundtrack of the film&#x27;s ragtime score, which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adaptation Score in the &quot;Adaptation Score&quot; category.

== Release ==
=== Marketing ===
Despite Malle&#x27;s concerted effort to make the film sanitized of explicit sex, it received significant salacious pre-publicity leading up to its release, including a lengthy article by Joan Goodman in &quot;New York Magazine&quot;, which described it as &quot;&quot;Lolita&quot;, only in period costume and much more explicit.&quot; Further press attention came in the form of Shields&#x27;s appearance in a pictorial about the film in &quot;Playboy&quot; in March 1978. Malle&#x27;s brother, Vincent, commented that the film&#x27;s pre-publicity was calculated by Malle and &quot;absolutely deliberate. ... It was not something imposed on him by Paramount.&quot;

Film scholar and Malle biographer Nathan Southern wrote that Malle &quot;realized that by leading viewers to expect &quot;sophisticated kiddie porn,&quot; but carrying the film&#x27;s content to the opposite extreme (inexplicitness), the contrast between audience expectations and onscreen realitythe power derived from the modernistic interplay of opposites within the framework of anticipationwould make the film&#x27;s message of relativistic ethos that much clearer in the audience&#x27;s mind.&quot;

According to critic Danny Peary, &quot;Pretty Baby&quot; was released during a period of the 1970s in which &quot;peak public outrage over child abuse, child pornography, and child prostitution, and its critics were right to be disappointed that Malle refused to portray Violet&#x27;s life in a brothel in a negative light ... The sledgehammer &#x27;selling of Brooke Shields as a pubescent sex symbol,&#x27; which gained momentum because of the film, was truly tasteless. At least Malle didn&#x27;t exploit his hot property as much as others did.&quot;

=== Controversy and censorship ===
The subject matter of the film, along with certain scenes resulted in the film being cut, edited or banned in various jurisdictions. The continuing controversy over Shields&#x27;s underage nude scenes resulted in the film being banned in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Saskatchewan (until 1995). Gossip columnist Rona Barrett called the film &quot;child pornography&quot;, with director Malle being described as a &quot;combination of &quot;Lolita&quot;″s Humbert Humbert and the (by that point) controversial director Roman Polanski&quot;. In Argentina, the film, along with another of Paramount&#x27;s releases of the time, &quot;Looking for Mr. Goodbar&quot;, was banned under the regime of Jorge Rafael Videla during that country&#x27;s last civil/military dictatorship, due (in large part) to the &quot;pornographic&quot; content that was present in both films. For five years, the film was also banned by the apartheid regime in South Africa.

Actress Sarandon reflected on the film&#x27;s censorship in a later interview, commenting that the censors &quot;were looking for something. The film was disturbing ... [yet] clearly when you look at it, it doesn&#x27;t have anything graphic. Even at that time, it was pretty tame.&quot;

In addition to the issue of child prostitution, the scenes involving a nude, 12-year-old Shields were undoubtedly controversial. 

The film received an R-rating in the United States, and an R18+ in Australia, from the Australian Classification Board (ACB).

United Kingdom

When the film was submitted to the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) for cinema release, the film ran into legal issues. At the time the Protection of Children Bill, which went on to become the Protection of Children Act 1978, was going through Parliament.

The bill would go on to criminalise the manufacture and distribution of any &#x27;indecent&#x27; images of individuals under the age of 16, in England and Wales.

Given the age of the actress involved, discussion therefore ensued between the head of the BBFC at the time, James Ferman and the films director:

As you know, your film &quot;Pretty Baby&quot; is likely to run into some difficulties in Britain if and when the Protection of Children Bill is enacted into law.  The Bill passed through the Commons last week and is expected to have a fairly easy passage in the Lords, in which case it should receive the Royal Assent some time during July [...] There is no doubt that this Bill will apply to any film which purports to show children under the age of consent engaged in scenes which may be found to be indecent

Ferman went on to comment on the screening that had taken place with Home Office officials and representatives of the DPP, who while acknowledging the merits of the film, expressed a view that the film could fall foul of the bill (if passed), further internal discussion would be and prior to the passage of the bill, and the film was eventually seen after it became law, resulting in two cuts to indecent images being made in July 1978. These proposed cuts were put to the film&#x27;s director, Louis Malle, who was very reluctant to make any changes to his film, although ultimately agreed to the changes made to the film. The film was passed X and released in 1978.

The uncut version was released on DVD in 2006. This same uncut print is the basis of the Region 1 and Region 2 DVD editions worldwide.

=== Home media ===
Paramount Home Entertainment released the film on DVD on November 18, 2003. In 2022, the Australian film label Imprint Films released it for the first time on Blu-ray in a special edition, which included an interview with Shields, in which she recalled shooting the film as well as its controversial reception. Kino Lorber announced in January 2023 the forthcoming release of a North American Blu-ray.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
The movie was met with a lackluster response from moviegoers. It performed poorly in terms of box office revenue, failing to even make it into the top 50 highest-grossing films of both 1978 and 1979. By December 31, 1978, it only generated $4.13 million in theatrical rentals. Despite its $3 million budget, the film was unable to generate enough ticket sales to cover its production costs.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;Pretty Baby&quot; divided critics at the time of its release. In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby wrote: &quot;Mr. Malle, the French director ... has made some controversial films in his time but none, I suspect, that is likely to upset convention quite as much as this one – and mostly for the wrong reasons. Though the setting is a whorehouse, and the lens through which we see everything is Violet, who ... herself becomes one of Nell&#x27;s chief attractions, &quot;Pretty Baby&quot; is neither about child prostitution nor is it pornographic.&quot; Canby ended his review with the claim that &quot;Pretty Baby&quot; is &quot;... the most imaginative, most intelligent, and most original film of the year to date.&quot; Film critic Kenneth Turan praised Shields&#x27;s performance as &quot;chilling,&quot; but felt the film largely boasts a &quot;flat, uninvolving directorial style ... Like its protagonist, &quot;Pretty Baby&quot; is something of a carnival attraction, nothing more.&quot;

&quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; critic Roger Ebert, who gave the film three stars out of four, discussed how &quot;... &quot;Pretty Baby&quot; has been attacked in some quarters as child porn. It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s an evocation of a time and a place and a sad chapter of Americana.&quot; He also praised Shields&#x27;s performance, writing that she &quot;... really creates a character here; her subtlety and depth are astonishing.&quot; 

On the other hand, &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that &quot;the film is handsome, the players nearly all effective, but the story highlights are confined within a narrow range of ho-hum dramatization.&quot; &quot;Mountain Xpress&quot; critic Ken Hanke, looking at the film from the perspective of 2003, said of &quot;Pretty Baby&quot;: &quot;It was once shocking and dull. Now it&#x27;s just dull.&quot;

, review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 71% of 28 critics had given the film a favorable review, with a weighted average of 6.88/10.

=== Accolades ===
The film won the Technical Grand Prize at the 1978 Cannes Film Festival, and was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or. The film&#x27;s original musical score by Ferdinand Morton&#x27;s earned the film an Academy Award nomination for Best Music.

== Controversies and cultural impacts ==
While majoring in French literature at Princeton University, Shields went on to write her senior thesis, &quot;The Initiation: From Innocence to Experience: The Pre-Adolescent/Adolescent Journey in the Films of Louis Malle, Pretty Baby and Lacombe, Lucien&quot; (1987), comparing the themes of lost innocence in both films, as well as its role as a predominant theme across the director&#x27;s filmography. A documentary titled &quot;Pretty Baby: Brooke Shields&quot;, which charts the actress&#x27;s career and partly focuses on the film&#x27;s impact on her, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2023, ahead of a streaming release via Hulu in April 2023.

In 2003, &quot;The New York Times&quot; placed &quot;Pretty Baby&quot; on its list of the &quot;Best 1,000 Movies Ever&quot;.

<doc id="1013378" wikidata="Q774012" url="?curid=1013378" title="Moussier's redstart">
<text>Moussier&#x27;s redstart (Phoenicurus moussieri) is a small passerine bird in the genus &quot;Phoenicurus&quot; (redstarts), formerly classed as a member of the thrush family (Turdidae), but is now classified as an Old World flycatcher (Muscicapidae). It is an endemic resident breeder in the Atlas Mountains of northwest Africa. Its habitat is open woodland in rocky areas from sea level up to 3000 m altitude in the mountains.

It is the smallest redstart, only 12 cm long and 14–15 g weight. The male has a black head with a broad white stripe running above each eye and down the side of the neck. The upperparts are black other than a white wing patch, and the rich chestnut tail, from which it and other redstarts get their names (&quot;start&quot; is an old word for &quot;tail&quot;). The underparts are a rich orange-red. The female has a pale brown head and upperparts, and the underparts are a paler orange than the male, although generally redder than the underparts of the similar but larger female common redstart.

It is named after Jean Moussier (1795–1850) who was an amateur naturalist and a surgeon in the French Army during the Napoleonic Wars.

==Behaviour==
The male&#x27;s song is a mixture of rasping sounds and &quot;svee-svee&quot; notes. The call is a plaintive single note, &quot;wheet&quot;. It is primarily insectivorous, often feeding like a flycatcher, making aerial sallies after passing insects, but also picking and even digging insects out of the ground; more rarely, it will eat small berries. Its nest is built in a bush or on the ground and the clutch is typically 3-6 eggs.
Although largely resident, some show limited migratory behaviour, particularly altitudinal migration by those breeding at high altitudes moving to lower levels in winter. Vagrants have reached north to Great Britain (Dinas Head, Pembrokeshire; April 1988), east to Greece, and south to Mauritania.

==Taxonomy==
The genus name &quot;Phoenicurus&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;phoinix&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, and &quot;-ouros&quot; -&quot;tailed&quot;. The English and specific names commemorate Jean Moussier (1795–1850) who was an amateur naturalist and a surgeon in the French Army during the Napoleonic Wars.

Its relationships are obscure; its biogeography is not matched by any other redstart, while its colour pattern is most similar to the much larger Güldenstädt&#x27;s redstart, which shares the conspicuous white wing patch of the male. It was not included in the study by Ertan (2006), while in the limited sampling by Sangster et al. (2010) it was closest to common redstart.

<doc id="1013385" wikidata="Q3688932" url="?curid=1013385" title="Continental O-200">
<text>The Continental C90 and O-200 are a family of air-cooled, horizontally opposed, four-cylinder, direct-drive aircraft engines of 201 in3 (3.29 L) displacement, producing between 90 and 100 horsepower (67 and 75 kW).

Built by Continental Motors these engines are used in many light aircraft designs of the United States, including the early Piper PA-18 Super Cub, the Champion 7EC, the Alon Aircoupe, and the Cessna 150.

Though the C90 was superseded by the O-200, and many of the designs utilizing the O-200 had gone out of production by 1980, with the 2004 publication of the United States Federal Aviation Administration light-sport aircraft regulations came a resurgence in demand for the O-200.

==Design and development==

The C90 was introduced in 1947 as a follow-on to the A65, which had been in production since 1939.
Many of the designs powered by the C90 are upgraded variants of earlier A65 powered designs, such as the Piper J-3 Cub and PA-11 Cub Special, Aeronca 7AC, and Luscombe 8A. The engine was developed from the earlier O-190 by increasing the stroke inch.

This engine family is considered to be dependable, according to both industry publications and the FAA.

In a cooperative venture, Rolls-Royce produced these same designs in England, under separate certification, with model designations beginning RR, e.g. the Rolls-Royce RR C90-12FH is the equivalent of the Continental C90-12FH; the Rolls-Royce versions are &quot;directly interchangeable with the equivalent models manufactured by Continental.&quot; The Rolls-Royce O-200-A powers the Beagle Pup Series 1, the Rollason Condor, the Bölkow Bo 208 C Junior, the Avions Robin DR 220, the Morane-Saulnier MS-880, plus the Victa Airtourer 100 and the Reims F150 (a version of the Cessna 150 license-built in France by Reims Aviation).

All versions of the C90 and O-200 are four-stroke reciprocating engines and are all similar in size, displacement and weight. These engines are typically fitted with an updraft carburetor, though the C90-8FJ, -12FJ, and -14FJ are equipped with fuel injection systems. They utilize a redundant ignition system requiring no external power, driving two magnetos, each of which fires one spark plug per cylinder. Each cylinder has one intake valve and one exhaust valve, pushrod-activated.

Continental&#x27;s recommended time between overhaul (TBO) for these engines is 1,800 hours of operation or 12 years in service, whichever is reached first. The standard certification for the C90 and O-200 specifies Avgas 80/87 as the minimum fuel grade. Both are eligible for operation on automobile gasoline on the basis of Supplemental Type Certificates.

While the C90 is approved for takeoff power of 95 horsepower (71 kW) for five minutes, the designation is derived from its continuous power rating of 90 hp (67 kW). As noted above, certain models of the C90 replace the usual carburetor with a fuel injection system. In addition, there are models which provide for the installation of a controllable-pitch propeller and one, the C90-12FP, designed for a pusher configuration installation. While having slightly less horsepower than the O-200, many floatplane operators prefer the performance of the C90 over the O-200, due to its higher torque at lower rpm. This is primarily due to the C90&#x27;s camshaft design. The C90 is also known by its military designation of O-205.

The O-200 is an updated and upgraded version of the engine, achieving increased power of 100 hp (75 kW) as a result of higher maximum rpm. The standard and most common model of the engine is the O-200-A; the -B model is designed for a pusher installation, the -C model provides for the installation of a controllable-pitch propeller, and the -D model is a lower-weight version designed for light-sport aircraft.

==Operational history==

An engine designated the IOL-200, an O-200 variant modified with fuel injection and liquid cooling, powered the 1986 nonstop, non-refueled global circumnavigation flight of the Rutan Voyager. The 110-horsepower (82 kW) IOL-200, also referred to as the Voyager 200, was the rear engine and—unlike the forward engine, another modified engine, a Continental O-240 —ran throughout the entire nine-day flight save for a four-minute shutdown due to a fuel problem.

Formula One racer Sharp Nemesis, designed and flown by Jon Sharp, was powered by a &#x27;stock&#x27; O-200. Between 1991 and 1999, the aircraft won 45 of the 48 events in which it was entered, as well as winning three Louis Blèriot medals, four Pulitzer Trophies, and setting 16 speed records in its class. In one of those records, &quot;Nemesis&quot; was clocked at more than 290 mph (467 km/h). By contrast, the O-200 powered Legend Cub cruises at 95 mph (152.9 km/h).

<text>City Harvest Church () or CHC is a pentecostal megachurch located within the Yunnan subzone of Jurong West planning area, Singapore.

Founded in 1989 by Kong Hee, the church officially bases its values on Charismatic and Pentecostal teachings, with emphases on such doctrines as the Great Commandment, the Great Commission and the Cultural Mandate.

City Harvest Church is a congregational member of the National Council of Churches of Singapore. Services are held at its church building in Jurong West and rented hall space at Suntec International Convention Centre.

In 2015, six church leaders and fund or finance managers were found guilty of criminal breach of trust and falsification of accounts. When all six of them appealed against the verdict and sentences, the Appeal Court found them guilty of basic criminal breach of trust and reduced their sentences. The Court also noted that the six were not motivated by personal gain, and no permanent loss was intended or caused to CHC – all the monies were returned to the church with interest.

The church was one of three megachurches to make it to a list of Singapore&#x27;s 10 largest charities, according to a report by &quot;The Straits Times&quot; in 2019.

==Overview==
&quot;The Straits Times&quot; reported that CHC&#x27;s congregation size peaked at 33,000 in 2010 before investigations into its leaders began. In 2012, Global Church Network listed CHC as one of the ten largest churches outside of the US. The church reported that it had a congregation size of 15,654 in 2019 and an average weekly viewership of 17,276 for its online services and resources in 2020.&lt;ref name=&quot;City Harvest Annual Report 2019 / 2020&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, the demographics revealed that 45.1% are men, 54.9% are women, 34.1% are married, and 61.9% are single. 55.9% of them are working adults, while most of the rest are serving the military, non-salaried, students, or children.

The church was founded by Kong Hee and his wife Sun Ho on 7 May 1989 and held its first service at Peace Centre. It first functioned as &quot;Ekklesia Ministry,&quot; a youth department under the legal covering of Bethany Christian Centre, an Assemblies of God church. On 21 December 1992, City Harvest Church was set up as a society. It was registered under the Charities Act on 16 October 1993. 

From 2002, Kong began to teach on the Cultural Mandate and encourage the church members to excel in the marketplace. On 1 November 2005, Kong withdrew himself from the staff payroll and he now serves the church as an honorary founder/senior pastor. Later, in an investigation leading to trial and conviction, it was revealed that Kong had set up a private fund and diverted over $3 million of tithes and pledges to a &#x27;multi purpose account&#x27;. Givers to the account were told this was for the funding of a &#x27;Crossover project&#x27;.

Since 1996, CHC’s mandate was to build a “church without walls” – a church that actively engages the local community. Out of this vision, CHC started many initiatives such as a community arm known as City Harvest Community Services Association (CHCSA) in 1997 and the Crossover Project in 2002. CHCSA is currently involved in elderly services, direct social services, patient care services, as well as youth and community projects. In December 2004, CHC was involved in the humanitarian relief work of the Indian Ocean tsunami. The church has since sent aid and disaster relief workers to the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

==Controversies==
===Criminal Breach of Trust===

Since the beginning of the 21st century, one of the biggest corruption case on the island revolved around City Harvest Church and founders Kong Hee involving a total of S$50 million of funds misused. Six persons from the senior leadership, including its church founder Kong Hee, were convicted of the misuse of millions of dollars of the church&#x27;s money. The court found that the church&#x27;s senior leadership had channeled $24 million from CHC&#x27;s Building Fund into sham bonds in music production company Xtron and glass-maker Firna. The purpose of the restricted Building Fund was specifically for building or investment. They used the money to fund the singing career of Kong&#x27;s wife Ho Yeow Sun, as part of the Crossover Project, a church mission which they said was to evangelise through Ms Ho&#x27;s music. Expenses revealed by court records included a house in Hollywood that cost $28,000 a month in rent; a whole entourage of staff; a $1.9 million paycheck to rapper Wyclef Jean to produce the &quot;China Wine&quot; video; as well as another $500,000 to sweep up her albums when they tanked.

The six appealed the verdict, and on 7 April 2017, the Court of Appeal reduced their sentences by approximately half, based on its finding that “the appellants should only have been convicted of the offence of criminal breach of trust simpliciter under section 406 of the Penal Code”. The judges said it was a situation that involved no personal gain on the part of the six, and that they believed their acts, especially in sham investments would advance the interest of the church.

A Criminal Reference filed by the AGC in a bid to reinstate the original convictions was heard by a five-judge Court of Appeal and dismissed on 1 Feb 2018.

===Sun Ho scandal===
In 2013, a scandal took place involving founding clergy Sun Ho after hackers self-styled &#x27;Messiah&#x27; hacked her official website, following which a police report was made by City Harvest Church. Around the same time, a spam-like email is further published on the Internet suggested another self-styled &#x27;Messiah-Two&#x27; making allegations regarding Sun Ho. The suspected “Messiah”, James Raj, who had prior drug convictions, was arrested the same year for hacking into website of the Prime Minister’s Office.

===S$310 million Suntec investment===
On 6 March 2010, City Harvest Church announced that it had purchased a significant stake in Suntec Convention Centre and will be using its facilities for church services, the project will cost an estimated S$310 million, including shares acquisition, renovation, and rental costs. Church founder Kong Hee said in a statement that the move &quot;allows [the church] to move from a present expensive rental model to a more financially sustainable ownership model for the long term&quot;. However, some brought up the point that as a registered charity, CHC&#x27;s income – expected to include profits and dividends from space rental and tenant leases in Suntec Singapore in the future – is non-taxable. The church has clarified that the investment is indirect, through a wholly owned subsidiary for the purpose of taxation and separate accounting. Questions surfaced among the public whether religious organizations, which are registered as charities, should be allowed to go into business using what are essentially donor funds.

The Commissioner of Charities (COC) sought clarifications on the transaction. The church stated it was under a non-disclosure agreement which required the details of the transaction to remain confidential, but explained that the investment was made through a holding company that is not a charity organization and does not enjoy tax breaks; and had disclosed details of the deal to the COC as well as the Urban Redevelopment Authority upon request. The church also said that there was a &quot;strong and unfounded allegation&quot; floating online that the Management Board and Kong were &quot;deliberately concealing a number of embarrassing facts from its members&quot; with regard to the Suntec investment, saying that the allegation was &quot;furthest from the truth&quot;, and later released a notice stating that Charities and foundations often use donor funds to invest and generate sustainable income for their intended causes.

On 21 July 2012, the church announced details of its investment in Suntec Singapore. A total of 39.2% shareholding was acquired at a total cost of $97.75 million. Public-listed Suntec REIT holds the other 60.8%. The remaining balance in the projected building fund will be used for costs such as equipment, furniture and fittings, periodical shifting costs (due to other events at the venue), committed rentals, optional rentals and refundable rental deposits. In 2013, it was revealed that the church had undertaken a $50m loan with high interests to finance the acquisition of additional shares, as the building fund had largely been exhausted over the years on venue and equipment rentals, while using the Singapore Expo from 2006-2010. If the church is unable to finance the loan, it may in default lose up to 19.2% of its shareholding as part of the loan agreement.

<text>The Sydney Orbital Network is a 110 kilometre motorway standard ring road around and through Sydney, the capital of New South Wales in Australia. It runs north from Sydney Airport, underneath the CBD to the North Shore, west to the Hills District, south to Prestons and then east to connect with the airport. Much of the road is privately owned and financed by tolls.
==History==
Planning for this beltway, orbital or ring road began as early as 1962 under the &quot;County of Cumberland scheme&quot; (CCS) and was talked about as far back as 1944. Then, from 1973 to 1989, things started to take shape with new sections opening-up and then further advancing by 1999. In 2007, the Lane Cove Tunnel opened, completing the orbital network.

==Motorways that make up the orbital road==

The 110 km Sydney orbital consists of several motorways and freeways, they are listed below:
* Eastern Distributor
* Western Distributor 
* Southern Cross Drive
* General Holmes Drive
* M5 Motorway
* Westlink M7
* M2 Hills Motorway
* M4 Motorway 
* M8 Motorway 
* Lane Cove Tunnel
* Gore Hill Freeway
* Warringah Freeway
* Sydney Harbour Tunnel 
* WestConnex 
* NorthConnex 

The major sunken/underground sections of the orbital are:
*Sydney Harbour Tunnel
*Eastern Distributor
*M5 East tunnel
*Epping Tunnel (M2 Hills Motorway, although not really a major tunnel)
*Sunken Section of the M2 Hills Motorway (The trench between Epping Road)
*Lane Cove Tunnel
*WestConnex

The major elevated sections are:
*Parts of the Westlink M7
*Parts of Southern Cross Drive and General Holmes Drive (past the airport)

==Tolling==
The Sydney Orbital Road Network consists of a number of roads built by private companies: tolling is mostly unavoidable when using the road network. A $6.95 toll was added to the M5 East motorway from King Georges Road to Marsh Street on the 5th of July 2020, to coincide with the opening of the M8 tunnel.

==Highway links==
Intercity highways are linked to the Orbital, moving traffic away from the old busy National Routes. They are:

*NorthConnex - linking M1 Pacific Motorway, Newcastle and Brisbane to M2 Hills Motorway
*M4 Motorway - linking Great Western Highway and Bathurst to Westlink M7
*Hume Motorway - linking Melbourne and Canberra to M5 Motorway and Westlink M7
*King Georges Road - linking Princes Highway, Princes Motorway and Wollongong to M5 Motorway

==Proposed or missing freeway/motorway links==
*M6 Motorway – A proposal that links the New M5 Tunnels and the southern suburbs of Sydney, as the M6 Motorway. The only section which was built is the Captain Cook Bridge and its approaches. Land is still reserved north of this point through Sandringham, and south through the Royal National Park. In October 2017, the government announced it will proceed with Stage 1 of the F6 extension, which will run via two 4 km tunnels linking the New M5 tunnels at Arncliffe to President Avenue at Kogarah. In October 2019, the government announced a name change of the extension to M6 Motorway and also confirmed the completion date of Stage 1 would be pushed back to late 2025, with major construction to begin by early 2022.
*Western Harbour Tunnel - linking the WestConnex via the Rozelle Interchange (opened in December 2023) with the North Shore at Cammeray.

==History==
===Monarchy===
The settlement of the region dates back to the 16th century, to the establishment of the Captaincy of São Vicente. In 1568, Brás Cubas, provider of the captaincies of São Vicente and Santo Amaro, received, in donation of sesmaria, 3,000 fathoms of tested land to the sea and 9,000 fathoms of bottom lands to the Meriti River, cutting the paving stone of the village of Jacutinga. Another of the recipients was Cristóvão Monteiro, who gained lands on the banks of the Iguaçu River. The economic activity that gave rise to the occupation of the place was the cultivation of sugarcane. Corn, beans and rice have also become important ancillary products during this period.

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the administrative division of Iguaçu followed ecclesiastical criteria, that is, the church assumed religious and legal administration over the parishes. Thus, Pilar, Meriti, Estrela and Jacutinga, areas that currently occupy part of the territory of Duque de Caxias, belonged to Iguaçu. The region became an important point of passage for riches from the interior: the gold of Minas Gerais, discovered at the time of crisis of the sugar plantation and the coffee of the Paraíba Valley, which represented about 70% of the entire Brazilian economy at the time.

Since the roads on the mainland were few, precarious and dangerous, transportation was mostly done by river. The rivers were not lacking in the region and, due to its location at the Bay of Guanabara, many paths up the mountains towards the interior went through today&#x27;s Duque de Caxias. The Port of Estrela was the most important landmark of this period. Around it grew a camp that, in the 19th century, was transformed into the municipality of Vila da Estrela.

After the decay of mining, the region remained a rest stop, supplying troopers, transshipment and transit of goods. Until the 19th century, local progress was remarkable. However, the relentless deforestation caused the obstruction and overflowing of the rivers, which favored the formation of marshland. The still and polluted waters led to the spread of disease-carrying mosquitoes.

The location was rendered practically uninhabitable, and little remained of the population. The previously fertile lands were covered with mangrove vegetation. In 1850, epidemics arose, forcing to flee to safer places. Many properties were abandoned, and Duque de Caxias would remain in shambles for some decades.

With the introduction of rail transport, the situation has deteriorated considerably. The D. Pedro II Railway linked the capital of the Brazilian Empire to the current municipality of Queimados. The production of the Paraíba Valley began to be disposed of by this route, rivers and land transportation were gradually abandoned and the river ports lost their importance. The region of Equatorial Guinea fell into sharp decline.

With the abolition of slavery in 1888, several changes occurred in the economic and social life of the Baixada Fluminense. The sanitation works were abandoned, there was a delay in the conditions conducive to health and several diseases arose. Among them, Malaria and Chagas disease.

===Republic===
Under the government of Nilo Peçanha, Meriti had a timid improvement in the area of basic sanitation, counting, even, with the arrival of the piped water, in 1916, in the present land of the &quot;Pacificador&quot;. But only in the government of Getúlio Vargas, who created the Sanitation Commission of the Baixada Fluminense, the region has advanced. By 1945, more than 6,000 kilometers of rivers were cleared, taking 45,000,000 cubic meters of land from their beds. With this work, the rivers ceased to be mosquito breeding sites, greatly reducing the number of diseases in the region.

When the railroad hit the Meriti Valley, the region began to suffer the effects of urban sprawl in the city of Rio de Janeiro. With the inauguration of Rio de Janeiro North Railway, on 23 April 1886, the region was definitively linked to the former Federal District. With the inauguration of new stations in 1911 by the Leopoldina Railway, the number of passengers and the number of passengers in Gramacho, São Bento, Actura (Campos Elísios), Primavera and Saracuruna neighbourhoods were multiplied.

However, despite this recovery that the railroad had brought, the lowlands continued to suffer from a lack of sanitation, a factor that stagnated their progress. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the lowlands served to alleviate the demographic pressures of the city of Rio de Janeiro. Statistical data show that in 1910, the population was eight hundred people in Meriti, moving in 1920 to 2920. The rapid population growth caused the fractionation and the subdivision of the former rural properties, at that moment, unproductive. Only in 1924, the first electricity grid was installed in the municipality. With the opening of the Rio-Petrópolis Highway in 1928, Meriti once again prospered. Numerous companies bought land and settled in the region because of the proximity to Rio de Janeiro.

The process of emancipation of the city was related to the formation of a group that organized the Popular Caxiense Union (UPC): journalists, doctors and local politicians. In 1940, the pro-emancipation commission was created: Sylvio Goulart, Rufino Gomes, Amadeu Lanzeloti, Joaquim Linhares, José Basílio, Carlos Fraga and Antônio Moreira. The reaction of the government was immediate and the demonstrators were arrested.

In the 1940s, the federal government promoted the cleaning of more than 6,000 kilometers of rivers and built more than two hundred bridges in the Baixada Fluminense.

The great growth through which Meriti passed, led Federal Representative Manuel Reis to propose the creation of the District of Caxias. On 14 March 1931, through the act of the interventor Plínio de Castro Casado, the District of Caxias was created by State Decree No. 2,559, with headquarters in the former Meriti Station, belonging to the then municipality of Nova Iguaçu. On December 31, 1943, through Decree-Law 1055, it was renamed the Municipality, receiving the name Duque de Caxias. The Duque de Caxias region was created by Decree-Law No. 0556, on the same day, month and year. With the emancipation, the municipality received great incentive in its economy. Several people, mainly from the Northeast Region of Brazil, arrived in Rio de Janeiro in search of work and settled in Duque de Caxias. The executive power was officially installed on 1 January 1944.

After the military dictatorship, a great deal of political, business, trade union, and community leadership, the municipality gained its autonomy in 1985.

Caxias has a hot climate, however, the 3rd and 4th districts (Imbariê and Xerém) are warm because of the green area and the proximity to the Serra dos Órgãos.

<text>Kenneth Henry Acheson (born 27 November 1957) is a British former racing driver from Northern Ireland who competed for RAM Racing in the 1983 and 1985 Formula One seasons. He completed only one of his three race starts, finishing in 12th position in the 1983 South African Grand Prix. In 1985, he was a substitute for Manfred Winkelhock, who was killed in a sportscar race during the season.

==Career==

===Early career===
Born in Cookstown, his father, the owner of an Ulster brickworks, raced in the 1970s on motorcycles and in Formula Ford.

In 1976 he had a test in his father&#x27;s old Crosslé FF1600 at the local Kirkistown Circuit and in no time was lapping within three seconds of the lap record. He entered his first race later in the year, once again at Kirkistown driving his father&#x27;s FF1600 Crosslé. He acquitted himself pretty well and his father agreed to buy a new Crosslé for the 1977 season if Kenny quit smoking.

So, equipped with new machinery, he won the 1977 Northern Ireland FF1600 Championship.

===Further success and Formula 1===
For 1978 he moved to England to contest three of the Formula Ford series. Driving one of Alan Cornock&#x27;s Royales with RMC sponsorship, he won 29 races and all three championships. He also picked up a Grovewood Award at the end of the year.

Moving up to Formula 3 in 1979, he began with a second-hand Ralt but soon ordered a new March 793 in an effort to be more competitive. However he failed to take any Championship wins though he set the fastest lap at the F3 support race for the 1979 British Grand Prix and won three non-championship races.

For 1980 he joined up with Murray Taylor Racing at Stone in Oxfordshire, to contest the Vandervell British F3 Championship. By mid-season Acheson was leading the Championship from Stefan Johansson who was driving for Project 4 Racing. But then Johansson acquired a new Ralt RT3 and closed the gap. At the last race of the Championship, Kenny made a small mistake and Johansson took the title.

Moving up to Formula 2 in 1981, he joined Docking Spitzley Racing driving a Toleman TG280. However his season ended prematurely with a big accident while racing for the lead with Michele Alboreto around the French street circuit at Pau. Running wheel to wheel, Alboreto left Acheson nowhere to go and he crashed heavily, his car ending up in a tree. With both his legs badly broken he was lucky to survive.

Nevertheless, he returned in 1982 with the Ralt Honda team, finishing seventh in the European Championship.

He was given a works F2 drive with Maurer Motorsport in 1983 and, later in the year, made his F1 debut in one of John McDonald&#x27;s RAM March F1 cars with RMC sponsorship RAM March F1 car. In seven races, he failed to qualify the cumbersome car on every occasion before he finally made it onto the grid for the South African GP.

Without a drive in 1984, he returned to the RAM team as to replace Manfred Winkelhock who had tragically been killed racing a Kremer Porsche 962C at Mosport Park. With the more competitive Hart-powered RAM 03 Kenny qualified for both the Austrian and Italian GP but his funds dried up and that was the end of his F1 career.

===Later career===
He also had a brief flirtation with CART that year. He was entered for the Indy 500 in a Lola T800 Cosworth but didn&#x27;t drive. He then crashed his March 83C Cosworth at the Meadowlands before failing to qualify for Elkhart Lake and crashing in practice at Laguna Seca in the Skoal Bandit Lola T800 Cosworth.

For the next few years he made his living in Japan where he raced for Kunimitsu Takahashi&#x27;s Advan-backed Alpha team in Formula 3000 and sports cars. He won the Japanese Sportscar Championship in 1987 and on the back of that, moved back to Europe in 1988 with Sauber-Mercedes and was due to drive at Le Mans, but the team pulled out in practice.

He embarked on a full season with Sauber-Mercedes in 1989 and took a fine second at Le Mans that year driving with Mauro Baldi, the pair going on to win at Brands Hatch and Spa.

At the end of 1989 he was dropped by Sauber despite his performances and instead moved to Nissan for 1990 for the WSPC season. At Le Mans he retired the R90CK with a gearbox failure during the warm-up lap.

For Le Mans in 1991 he was part of the Silk Cut Jaguar team, finishing third in the XJR12. In 1992 he was back at Le Mans, this time with Toyota driving the Tony Southgate designed TS010 and scoring another second, though the following year he failed to finish. When the sportscar World Championship ended, Acheson switched to GT racing in Japan with the SARD team. This led to a final visit to the Sarthe in 1995, when he drove the SARD MC8R, retiring after just 14 laps when the car suffered a total brake failure.

In 1996 Acheson went to the Daytona 24 Hours with the Newcastle United football team liveried Lister Storm, sharing the car with Geoff Lees and Tiff Needell. In the dying moments of the race his Lister was destroyed in a violent crash when he was hit by a slower car. Luckily he walked away from the scene, and he also decided to walk away from racing altogether.

<doc id="1013417" wikidata="Q83543" url="?curid=1013417" title="Seibu Railway">
<text>is a conglomerate based in Tokorozawa, Saitama, Japan, with principal business areas in railways, tourism, and real estate. Seibu Railway&#x27;s operations are concentrated in northwest Tokyo and Saitama Prefecture; the name &quot;Seibu&quot; is an abbreviation of &quot;west Musashi&quot;, referring to the historic name for this area. It and its holding company hold shares of numerous bus, hotel and tourism operations nationwide.

== History ==
&quot;Seibu Railway&quot; was originally the name of a tram service between Shinjuku and Ogikubo, which was transferred to the Tokyo metropolitan government in 1951 and eventually closed in 1962. The Seibu Railway was acquired in 1921 by the Kawagoe Railway, which had operated a train service between Kokubunji and Kawagoe since 1894; the merged company kept the &quot;Seibu&quot; name and expanded its main line to Takadanobaba, forming what is now known as the Seibu Shinjuku Line.

The current Seibu Railway is a product of a 1945 merger between the former Seibu Railway and the Musashino Railway, which was founded in 1912 to operate what is now known as the Seibu Ikebukuro Line. The merger was largely orchestrated by Yasujirō Tsutsumi, a real estate developer who opened the Tamako Railway (now the Seibu Tamako Line) in 1928, became a major shareholder in the Musashino Railway and merged the two in 1940.

In 1944, the Tokyo metropolitan government, under the administration of Shigeo Ōdachi, hired the Seibu Railway and the Musashino Railway to provide a coordinated service to transport night soil from central Tokyo to outlying disposal areas. At the time, night soil was generally transported by truck to Tokyo Bay and disposed of by dumping there, but the progress of World War II led to gasoline and personnel shortages which made this system unsustainable. The sewage service continued through the American occupation until 1951. As a result of this service cooperation, Seibu Railway merged with Musashino Railway to form the current Seibu Railway, effective in September 1945. Tokyu Group president Keita Goto had an intense personal rivalry with Tsutsumi, and unsuccessfully attempted to block both Tsutsumi&#x27;s takeover of the Musashino Railway and its merger with the Seibu Railway.

The former Seibu network based around Shinjuku and the former Musashino network based around Ikebukuro remain operationally separated today. In 1986, Seibu Railway moved its headquarters from the Ikebukuro area to Tokorozawa, Saitama, where the two main Seibu lines intersect.

Tsutsumi became the controlling shareholder in Seibu Railway following the merger through his holding company Kokudo Corporation. After gaining control of Seibu, Kokudo developed the Prince Hotels chain, acquired the baseball team now known as the Saitama Seibu Lions, in addition to continuing its core real estate business throughout the Tokyo area. Seibu Railway had its initial public offering on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1949 but remained under the control of Tsutsumi through Kokudo.

Station numbering was introduced on all Seibu Railway lines during fiscal 2012.

===Delisting and takeover struggle===
Tsutsumi registered Seibu Railway shares owned by Kokudo in the names of various affiliated individuals, often without their permission, so that the true ownership of the company was not readily apparent. Following the death of Tsutsumi in 1964, his third son Yoshiaki Tsutsumi inherited control of Kokudo and continued the practice of falsifying shareholder records. His holdings in Kokudo and Seibu led to his being deemed the &quot;world&#x27;s richest man&quot; by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine for four consecutive years from 1987 to 1990, with estimated net worth of $15–20 billion during the height of the Japanese asset bubble. He was arrested on securities fraud charges in March 2005.

On December 21, 2005, Seibu Railway was delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange. A reorganization of the group, completed in February 2006, created Seibu Holdings to act as a holding company for both the railway and Prince Hotels. Cerberus Capital Management, an American investment fund, became the largest shareholder in Seibu Holdings with a 29.9% share of the new company.

In late 2012 and early 2013, Cerberus proposed that Seibu Railway abolish five non-core lines, along with other restructuring measures throughout the Seibu Holdings group, but management refused to implement these changes. Cerberus then executed a tender offer to increase its stake to 35% as of June 2013, giving Cerberus the power to veto shareholder resolutions. Cerberus had aimed to raise its stake to 44%, bringing it closer to an outright majority, but Seibu management engaged in a massive campaign to thwart the tender offer, including advertising within Seibu trains to passengers who owned stock. The East Japan Railway Company and several financial institutions also planned a support scheme to keep Cerberus from acquiring control of Seibu, but it was ultimately not implemented due to a lack of potential financial benefit for the investors. At the June 2013 shareholder meeting, several proposals by Cerberus were voted down, including the election of outside directors and the abolition of non-core lines.

, Yoshiaki Tsutsumi remains a major investor in Seibu Holdings through his 36% investment in NW Corporation, the second-largest shareholder in the company with a share of around 15%. Tsutsumi refused to respond to the Cerberus tender offer at the urging of Seibu management.

==Railway operations==

As of June 2017, Seibu&#x27;s routes total . They fall into two separate groups. Tokorozawa Station is the crossing point of Ikebukuro Line and Shinjuku Line.

===Ikebukuro Line Group===
The Ikebukuro Line group includes the Ikebukuro Line and its branches. 
=== Shinjuku Line Group ===
The Shinjuku Line group includes the Shinjuku Line and its branches, as well as the Tamagawa Line, which is not a branch of the Shinjuku Line but had been owned by the Shinjuku Line&#x27;s operator before its merger with the Ikebukuro Line operator.
Until May 31, 2017, this list included the . Prior to the formal closure, the freight line between Minami-Ōtsuka Station and Ahina Station had suspended operation since 1963.

<text>Liberal Animation is the debut studio album by the American punk rock band NOFX. It was originally released in 1988 through Wassail Records, which was Fat Mike&#x27;s label before Fat Wreck Chords. Brett Gurewitz produced the record, and even offered to release it on his label, Epitaph Records. The band decided to self-release it instead. It was re-released through Epitaph Records in 1991 with all new artwork. The title is a spoonerism of &quot;animal liberation&quot; and the cover artwork is a reflection of that. Bassist/Singer, Fat Mike has stated many times that he thinks it&#x27;s the worst NOFX album. He wrote the majority of the album on a guitar he bought from Lynn Strait of Snot. The track &quot;Shut Up Already&quot; features a short cover of the Led Zeppelin song &quot;Black Dog&quot;. It is the only full length album by NOFX to feature Dave Casillas on guitar. Amateur style music videos were made for the tracks &quot;Shut Up Already&quot; and &quot;Mr. Jones.&quot;

==Track listing==
==Personnel==
* Fat Mike – vocals, bass
* Eric Melvin – rhythm guitar, acoustic guitar

<text>The Liberty, formally named The Liberty Shopping Centre, is a covered shopping centre in Romford, London, England, the largest such centre in the town. It was originally built in 1968 and underwent a four-year redevelopment completed in 2003. The centre takes its name from the former Liberty of Havering and is owned by the Cosgrave Property Group. It is also the largest indoor shopping centre in the borough of Havering overall and covers of retail space, around 100 shops.

The Liberty has an annual footfall of 23 million, equating to 425,000 people per week. It is linked to The Mercury Mall (formerly known as Liberty 2) by an underpass.

==History==
The Liberty Shopping Centre was first opened in 1968 in a joint deal between Hammerson and Standard Life Investments. In 1999 Hammerson acquired Standards Life&#x27;s 50% interest for £53 million and in 2000 acquired the freehold on the land. In September 2006, Irish property developers, The Cosgrave Property Group acquired the centre from Hammerson for £281 million.

The centre underwent an extensive redevelopment which was completed in 2003 at a cost of £52 million. Previously, the main part of the centre was open-air, with several covered arcades running off from it linking it to other parts of the town centre. The changes undertaken in the 2000s included the covering of the main part of the centre with a glazed roof, and the development of a new car parking facility, plus new large stores for Next and H&amp;M. Several existing stores were remodelled or relocated, or received other modernisations, as part of the redesign, including Boots, BHS and W H Smith.

Once the planning application had been granted for the transformation of the centre, work started in August 2001. In April 2003, the centre achieved practical completion.

<text>Philippe Adams (; born 19 November 1969) is a Belgian racing driver.

== Career==

=== Early career ===
Adams was born in Mouscron, Wallonia, Belgium. He first began in motorsport at the age of twelve, racing karts, before beginning in car racing in 1984. In 1992, Adams competed in the British Formula 3 Championship, finishing second overall in the season. Adams went on to the British Formula Two Series for 1993, winning the championship.

=== Formula One (1994) ===

Adams and his backers agreed with Team Lotus to find $500,000 to earn a pay-drive with them for two rounds of the 1994 Formula One season. Part of the funding for this came from an insurance policy taken out against his Belgian Procar race at Spa alongside the F1 race, which he won. He retired from the Belgian round, but managed to finish 16th in the Portuguese round. In between these two races, regular driver Alessandro Zanardi qualified a strong 13th for his home race. Adams was also intended to race at Jerez, but the team gave the drive back to Zanardi.

=== After Formula One ===
Adams never returned to Formula One opting to return to the national scene, primarily in production car and sportscar racing.

<text>The Aircraft Engineering Corp Ace K-1 was a United States single-seat biplane aircraft designed in 1918 by Alexander Klemin, then professor of Aeronautical Engineering at New York University (NYU). It was the first American civil aircraft to be produced after World War I. Later versions included a nearly faired-in engine installation. The aircraft was re-introduced in 1930 with a re-designed fuselage and strengthened structure as the Ace 300 and Ace 200, fitted with Salmson 9Ad and LeBlond 5D engines, respectively.

One example survives, powered by a Keane Acemotor, and is displayed at the Cradle of Aviation Museum in Garden City, New York.

<text>Li Huasheng (Simplified Chinese: 李华生; Hanyu Pinyin: Lǐ Huáshēng) (1944–2018) was a Chinese artist from Yibin in Sichuan province. He received his first art training in one of Chongqing&#x27;s culture halls. He met Chen Zizhuang in 1972, and studied traditional Chinese painting under him, mastering his style in just four years.

Li&#x27;s fame was so great that in 1980, he was invited to showcase his art for Chinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. In 1985 he was elected an honorary member of the Sichuan Academy of Fine Arts, and the following year was accepted into the Sichuan Academy of Poetry, Calligraphy, and Painting.

Li&#x27;s life has been extensively chronicled in Jerome Silbergeld and Gong Jisui&#x27;s &quot;Contradictions: Artistic Life, The Socialist State, and the Chinese Painter Li Huasheng&quot;, and his life has been said to &quot;[epitomize] the path of the artist in socialist China&quot;.

<text>The 1956 AFC Asian Cup was the inaugural AFC Asian Cup, a quadrennial continental association football competition introduced and organised by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). The final tournament was held in Hong Kong from 1 September to 15 September 1956 as a four-team round-robin competition with no final. It was won by South Korea.

An unusual ruling meant that all games were 80 minutes long, with an extra 30 minutes extra time if the game was drawn at full time (although this didn’t happen due to bad light).
